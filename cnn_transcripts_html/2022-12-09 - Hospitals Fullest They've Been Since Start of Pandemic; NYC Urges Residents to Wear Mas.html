ANA CABRERA, CNN HOST: Just in, new numbers showing an explosion in flu cases in the week after Thanksgiving. In fact, the CDC says more than a third of the hospitalizations and deaths this flu season occurred just last week. 
 
Let's get CNN medical correspondent, Dr. Tara Narula, in here. 
 
Obviously, there was the Thanksgiving gatherings. We still have Christmas and New Year's and Hanukkah all ahead of us. 
 
DR. TARA NARULA, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST: Yes. 
 
CABRERA: How are hospital capacities right now? 
 
NARULA: It's not great right now. So the hospitals had to report their capacity starting in 2020 to help us track COVID. And for the last two years, the capacity was around 70 percent. 
 
This week, it jumped up to 80 percent. And that jump really happened a lot in the last two weeks. We saw about an 8 percent increase in the past two weeks. 
 
The only other time where beds were 80 percent full was last January with the height of Omicron. And at that point, we saw this 80 percent number. 
 
In fact, in some states, it's even worse. Rhode Island, we're talking above 90 percent beds are full. In eight other states above 85 percent. Those states, Oregon, Washington, Massachusetts, and several others. 
 
CABRERA: The numbers we just cited were specific to the flu but it's not just the flu that's leading to these hospitalizations, right? 
 
NARULA: It's multiple factors. So certainly the flu is a big one. We have seen higher hospitalization rates now, according to the director of the CDC, than at any point in the past decade for this time. You just reported on those recent numbers, 120,000 hospitalizations,
 
 overall, over 7,000 deaths. But add to that RSV, which we reported on a lot, particularly in the pediatric population.
 
And then there are other factors. So there are workforce staffing shortages affecting hospitals. And they affect the places where we send patients. 
 
So we send patients to nursing facilities and rehabs. If they don't have the staff, we can't discharge patients from the hospital and you get a backlog. 
 
In addition, there's also a delay in people who didn't get care during the pandemic, who are now seeking care for their procedures or other illnesses.
 
And so all of this together has created this situation where we're just seeing elevated high levels of hospital capacity. 
 
CABRERA: I couldn't believe it but the New York City Health Department actually put out a statement telling people they should be wearing masks again indoors or in crowds outside. They cite COVID and these other issues related to hospital capacity. 
 
And so is that really where we're at? Is that what you would recommend? 
 
NARULA: That's a great question. And I think there's a lot of controversy. And a lot of people tired of wearing masks, for sure. 
 
But I think they're trying to be -- to do this out of an abundance of caution. And they know people will be gathering.
 
And we're not just talking about COVID. We're talking about respiratory infections transmitted by droplets like the flu and RSV and vulnerable populations who may not be vaccinated. 
 
We know one out of five are still not vaccinated for COVID. Many people have not gotten their flu shot. 
 
So it's not just always about protecting yourself but protecting others as well, those people you'll get together with. 
 
CABRERA: Too late to get your flu shot at this point? 
 
NARULA: Not too late. And a good match for the circulating strain so really important to get that flu shot. It takes about two weeks to build up those antibiotics so the sooner the better. 
 
CABRERA: Not too late. 
 
Thanks so much, Dr. Tara Narula. 
 
Now to war in Ukraine and the deepening humanitarian crisis. The staggering human toll and the suffering of civilians overwhelming Pope Francis with emotion. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
POPE FRANCIS: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
 
(CRYING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CABRERA: The pontiff was saying a public prayer for an end to Russia's war when he suddenly stopped, he broke down in tears. It took about 30 seconds before he could resume. 
 
Meantime, in Afghanistan, a U.N. human rights leader expressing serious concerns about what's happening under Taliban rule, noting that women and girls right now are continuing to be systematically excluded from virtually all aspects of life. 
 <br>[13:35:02]
 
This U.N. leader also condemned a public execution that happened this week, the Taliban's first in Afghanistan since taking power last year. 
 
Last month, the Taliban ordered judges to fully impose Sharia Law, a move that has raised fears among human rights advocates. 
 
It's still bad but maybe not as bad as before. What a new inflation report is telling us about rising prices, next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[13:40:15]
 
CABRERA: There's a new measure of the economy today and it's a mixed bag here. Here's the picture, year to year, some improvement, but wholesale prices still rose more than expected last month. 
 
And that is tamping down hopes that Americans will soon get some relief from the highest inflation in decades. 
 
The pessimism also reflected in this new CNN poll that shows more than half of Americans believe the economy is still in a downturn, only 17 percent believe it's starting to recover. 
 
CNN's Harry Enten is here to break down the polling. 
 
But first, Matt Egan is joining us to walk through the new numbers. 
 
It's not all doom and gloom, right? 
 
MATT EGAN, CNN REPORTER: Right. It's not all doom and gloom. 
 
Earlier this year, inflation kept getting hotter and hotter and hotter, right? That was crushing consumers and freaking out economists and investors. That is really not the case anymore. It is cooling off. Now, today's report focuses on whole wholesale inflation. This is
 
 inflation before it gets to consumers. And it showed that wholesale prices jumped 7.4 percent year over year in November. 
 
The good news is this is the fifth straight month of cooling inflation by this measure. Also, this is the lowest annual rate of inflation for this metric in a year and a half. 
 
I think the problem is the pace of improvement has been disappointing. This was hotter than expected. People are still feeling this high cost of living. Maybe not as much at the gas station because they've come down but they're feeling it at the supermarket.
 
And there's nothing about today's report that will dissuade the Federal Reserve from continuing to bump up the cost of borrowing. 
 
CABRERA: They have a big move coming up next week. 
 
Harry Enten, how are Americans feeling? What are they telling us this this poll? 
 
HARRY ENTEN, CNN SENIOR DATA REPORTER: It's an interesting poll. Let's start off here, change of financial situation over the past year.
 
This is the key number, worse off now. And 49 percent of Americans say they are worse off than they were a year ago. Compare that to when we asked this question last year, only 33 percent of Americans said they were worse off. 
 
But also keep in mind that the worse off number, 49 percent, is about equal to about the same, 34 percent better off, 16 percent, which adds up to 50 percent. So kind of a mixed picture, right? 
 
But why are Americans concerned about the economy at this point? It all comes back to the cost of living. So very concerned about cost of living. And 63 percent of Americans say they're very concerned. 
 
The other thing I'll note here is the 42 percent who say rising interest rates. So it's cost of living and as well the rising interest rates, which is why Americans feel not so fond about the economy at this point. 
 
CABRERA: The two biggest concerns cited, the cost of living and interest rates. 
 
So, Matt, how are we seeing that reflected in how people are responding? 
 
EGAN: Well, Ana, we are seeing some signs of financial stress. Vanguard says the share of retirement savers who were taking money out of their 401K due to a financial hardship, that has hit the highest level since they started tracking in 2004. 
 
This Vanguard survey suggests about 25,000 people in October alone took out so-called 401K hardship withdrawals. This is a sign that people need cash. They're having some trouble making ends meet. Also we're seeing another reflection of the spike in interest rates
 
 which, of course, has driven up the cost to get a mortgage. It's impacted home values. 
 
And so a recent report from research firm, Black Knight, finds that over 250,000 people who bought homes this year alone, they already owe more on their mortgage than their home is worth. 
 
CABRERA: Oh, gosh, that's not good news. 
 
I did see today that the home mortgage rates are going down just slightly from the high. That was above 7 percent at one point. 
 
Harry, talk to us now about how this gloomy outlook is affecting people's spending habits. 
 
ENTEN: We asked a very interesting question. As a result of the recent economic conditions, have you bought fewer or different groceries? And 71 percent of Americans said that. Cut back on non-essentials and 71 percent of Americans said that. 
 
And obviously, we're in the holiday season now. And 70 percent of Americans said they cut back on holiday gifts. 
 
So Americans feeling perhaps a little crunch in their wallet. They're perhaps spending differently than they might otherwise if they felt better about the economy. 
 
CABRERA: My kids are hoping Santa still has a bigger budget this year. They're concerned about that. 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
CABRERA: Harry, thank you. 
 
Matt Egan, thank you, as well, my friends.

CABRERA: Just an amazing 48 hours for NFL Quarterback Baker Mayfield. He went from being cut by one team to leading his new team to an unbelievable comeback win. 
 
Let's get to CNN sports anchor, Coy Wire, who is joining us from Philadelphia. We'll get to why he is there in a moment. 
 
But first, let's talk about this storybook win for Baker Mayfield. 
 
COY WIRE, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR: It is unreal. It was a fall from grace for Baker Mayfield. He was a former Heisman Trophy winner, former first overall pick in the NFL draft. 
 
But then he got cut from -- traded from Cleveland to Carolina, cut by Carolina earlier this week.
 
As a fall from grace, he bought his own plane ticket to L.A. in hopes that the Rams would sign him. And it's a good thing they did. 
 
He came in off the bench with about 1:45 to go in the fourth quarter. His team down by six points to the Vegas Raiders. And he leads them on an eight play, 98-yard drive that would result in a game winning touchdown pass from Mayfield to Jefferson. An incredible moment. 
 
Ana, learning an NFL playbook is like learning a new language. I only had to do it once in my career. And he does it three different teams in five months. 
 
Listen to the locker room reaction after Mayfield's incredible drive.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: To be able to come in here 10 minutes ago and help lead us to victor. See you guys on Monday! 
 
Mayfield! 
 
(CHEERING) 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WIRE: There you have it. 
 
Again, from the sports world, this time, from Baker Mayfield, a lesson that you never give up, you keep believing in yourself, Ana. And you always just try to maximize the moments you are given. 
 
CABRERA: Absolutely. I'm rooting for that team all the way. My Broncos are stinking it up this year so now I have a new team to root for and Baker Mayfield.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
CABRERA: You have a great crew behind you. Explain what you are doing there in Philadelphia. 
 
WIRE: Something you can relate to as a former Division I cross-country runner. This is the Army West Point marathon team. And they ran 150 miles through the night and through the elements here to Philadelphia. 
 
We're in front of the Museum of Art, the iconic rocky steps. The traditional running of the game ball tomorrow at 3:00 p.m. at the Army/Navy game.
 
It's so much more than game. Dating back to 1890. So much pageantry, tradition make it one of the greatest sports rivalries in the world. 
 
Ana, it is said this is the only game that's played where everyone playing is willing to sacrifice their life for everyone watching. So a great tribute to them when we watch this game. 
 
And one of those great traditions I talk about is the running of the game ball. They went 150 miles, as I mentioned. We have a little more running to do though. We're going to run up the steps because we hear it is good luck. 
 
Its go Army? 
 
CROWD: Beat Navy!  
 
WIRE: All right. Cue the rocking music. 
 
(LAUGHTER) WIRE: Ana, we'll see you later.
 
Let's go!  
 
CABRERA: I love those guys.
 
Coy, I expect you to run your first marathon in the next year. You've got all this inspiration, right? 
 
Thank you so much. 
 
Just an epic World Cup nail biter ending in heartbreak for top-ranked Brazil. The five-times World Cup champions losing in penalty kicks to a very strong Croatia team that fought until the very end. 
 
Brazil was one of the favorites to win it all, along with their five- star player on that team. And they go home now. And Croatia advances to the semifinals where they will play the winner of the Argentina/Netherlands match later today. 
 
And NASA's currently unmanned mission to get back on the moon and beyond is about to take a little detour. NASA says weather, more specifically a cold front, is now forcing them to move Artemis 1's splash down site this Sunday afternoon. 
 
The Orion spacecraft, which flew farther into space than any spacecraft has done before will now make its triumphant return and hit water off the coast of western Mexico near Guadeloupe Island. 
 
Here on earth, someone just paid an astronomical amount of money for some old bones. Not just any old bones. We're talking about this 200- pound T-Rex skull, dubbed Maximas. It was discovered in South Dakota a couple of years ago. About 76 million years old. 
 
And today, it sold in a Sotheby's auction for a little over $6 million, which is quite the steal apparently considering the auction house was expecting to fetch up to $20 million. Sotheby's said four bidders battled it out in a pretty good back and forth that lasted six minutes. 
 
Well, it is Friday. Doesn't that feel good? 
 
Thank you so much for being with us. We'll see you back here on Monday, hopefully rested and rejuvenated, same time, same place as always. I hope you have a wonderful weekend. 
 <br>[13:55:05]
 
The news continues right after this.
