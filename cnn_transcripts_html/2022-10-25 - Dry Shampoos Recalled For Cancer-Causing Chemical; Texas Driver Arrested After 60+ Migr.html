ANA CABRERA, CNN HOST: We're back now with a big recall to tell you about. Some big-name beauty products being pulled from shelves over a chemical that can cause cancer. Dove, Suave, Nexus, TRESemme, Bed Head and Rockaholic are all part of this. 
 
CNN health reporter, Jacqueline Howard, joins us with details.
 
Jacqueline, the chemical of concern behind this recall is the carcinogen, Benzene. What exactly is it? 
 
JACQUELINE HOWARD, CNN HEALTH REPORTER: That's right. This is a well- known carcinogen. We've known about this chemical for some time. It's a colorless or sometimes appears in light yellow colored chemical. It evaporates into the air quickly. 
 
The way you can be exposed, it can be inhaled, consumed, or you can have exposure to the skin. And this carcinogen has been linked to leukemia, for instance. 
 
Signs or symptoms of Benzene exposure include headaches, tremors, confusion, dizziness, irregular heartbeat.
 
So you can imagine it can be inhaled. So if it is sprayed through a dry shampoo, for instance, as part of this voluntary recall, that's one way of possible exposure -- Ana? 
 
CABRERA: Benzene isn't just used in hair products, though. It's in a lot of things. So where else, and is there broader concern? 
 
HOWARD: Right. Well, I'll first tell you naturally Benzene can be founding in cigarette smoke or crude oil or gasoline, for instance. 
 
But how there might be accidental exposure is sometimes Benzene is used as part of making chemicals for other items like plastics or synthetic fibers. So part of that manufacturing process can lead to possible accidental exposures here, Ana. But the concern is really focused on this voluntary recall. You mentioned the products earlier. That's what I think people should be aware of. 
 
CABRERA: In this case, it's dry shampoo products. Double check your cabinets at home and make sure your products aren't part of the recall. 
 
Thank you very much, Jacqueline Howard. I appreciate it. 
 
To Texas now, where the driver of a dump truck is in police custody after more than 60 migrants were found inside the vehicle. 
 
Stephanie Elam is gathering details for us. 
 
What are you learning, Stephanie? 
 
STEPHANIE ELAM, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Ana, we're talking about more than 60 migrants found inside of this dump truck. This happened in Cotulla, Texas, which is about the midway point if you're driving from the border to San Antonio, about an hour and a half into the drive from the border. 
 <br>[13:35:03]
 
The Texas Department of Public Safety says that they intercepted this human smuggling attempt. They're saying that -- as you look at these images, it's impossible to see how many people are coming out of this truck. 
 
More than 60 of them. They said they were able to take them, they say -- according to one of their tweets, they say the migrants were turned over to U.S. Border Patrol. 
 
At the same time, we do know that the driver of this truck has been arrested. But just the images there are just completely stunning there -- Ana? 
 
CABRERA: Stephanie Elam, thank you. We'll keep watch on that and those developments. 
 
Now this is really scary. Police in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, have released video showing what they believe was an attempted child abduction. 
 
Watch the circled area here. In a second, you'll see a young girl run into the frame, down the sidewalk. She slows down and bends forward as if she's catching her breath before running off again. 
 
Seconds, later a man runs after her from the same direction before turning back and leaving. 
 
Police say this is the second time this suspect has tried to kidnap this girl on her way to school. 
 
They tell us the first time he tried to lure her away with candy before trying to grab her. And the very next morning, he apparently went after her again, what you see in this video of.
 
The investigators do not believe he has any prior connection to the girl or her family. At last check, they are still trying to find him. 
 
Adidas caves to the pressure. Will other companies cut ties with Ye over his anti-Semitic comments? 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[13:41:26]
 
CABRERA: The other shoe has dropped for Kanye West. Sportswear giant, Adidas, has ended its partnership with the rapper, who now goes by the name Ye, after his recent anti-Semitic remarks. It's the latest brand to cut ties with him in recent weeks. 
 
It all began with a string of posts and comments disparaging Jewish people resulting in his Twitter and Instagram accounts being locked. 
 
Adidas was the biggest corporation still working with Ye and had been by his side for more than seven years. 
 
He appeared to think there was no way Adidas would cut him loose, boldly proclaiming this. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
YE, FORMERLY KNOWN AS KANYE WEST, RAPPER: The thing about me and Adidas is like I can literally anti-Semitic (EXPLETIVE DELETED) and they can't drop me. I can say anti-Semitic things and Adidas can't drop me. Now what? 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CABRERA: Well, he got his answer. 
 
CNN's Chloe Melas is here with more.
 
I think a lot of people were wondering what took so long? 
 
CHLOE MELAS, CNN ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER: Well, they called his bluff, right? Here Kanye is out there saying Adidas is never going to drop me, and they certainly did. 
 
As for why it took so long, we don't know but there's a lot of layers there. I think they just said they're going to lose over $200 million in revenue alone just by cutting ties and that's just in the interim. 
 
And it was a very lucrative deal that they had with Kanye. His line of shoes was incredibly successful. 
 
But you've seen a lot of companies distance themselves from him, from Gap. Creative Art Agency, his Hollywood heavyweight agents, have now dropped him as of yesterday. 
 
So you're seeing all this work that he put in for decades, it's all crumbling around him. 
 
You haven't heard him come out and apologize. You haven't heard him come out and say anything. Instead, he's choosing to turn to the conservative social media platform, Parler, saying he's going to buy that platform. 
 
But again, when it comes to Adidas, this is a big moment. And I think that instead of focusing on what took so long for that to happen, they did the right thing cutting ties with him. 
 
CABRERA: So what's the impact when it comes to Kanye, his own sort of financial circumstances? He obviously still has music that's out there on platforms like Spotify and Apple. 
 
Do we expect any changes from the music industry? 
 
MELAS: Well, look, Kanye is an incredibly wealthy person. I believe he's a billionaire, at least he says that he is. So in terms of whether he thinks he's going to be financially impacted, obviously he's going to lose money in the long term here. 
 
But it's unclear as to whether or not this is really sort of shaking him at his roots here. 
 
When you talk about deplatforming him from music platforms, that's an even bigger, more complicated issue.
 
Because you have music artists who are former felons, murderers. You have people who have been accused of things. Look at R. Kelly. Look at Michael Jackson. Whether you choose to listen to somebody's music is one thing. 
 
Things I've read is that, look, Spotify, I think that they have a very clear agenda when it comes to if your music is actually perpetuating hate, if your music itself is inciting hate and violence, that is when they draw the line perhaps and pull it. 
 
But potentially, everything that's going on with Kanye, maybe they will decide to remove his music. But I could see Kanye going out and creating his own music streaming platform. 
 
I think that you have a group of people, who are just diehard Kanye West fans, who are probably going to stick by him, believe it or not, even though it is so shocking, it is so upsetting, it is so controversial what he's done.
 <br>[13:45:02]
 
And the Anti-Defamation League obviously praising these companies for coming out and cutting ties with him. 
 
Again, we still haven't heard from Kanye. He still hasn't said anything about all of these business deals that are just falling apart in front of him. 
 
CABRERA: I did wonder if this could end up being a pivotal moment in the fight against hate, knowing that Kanye is such a powerful cultural sort of icon and then you have such a big brand in Adidas. 
 
We just put up the statement from the anti-defamation league. They certainly hope this could be a learning moment for the country. 
 
MELAS: It is. It is a big moment because, for Kanye to say Adidas can't drop me, and then they did, right? 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
MELAS: So it does show that your actions and your words, they do have consequences, even if you are one of the most powerful people in the music industry. Maybe not for much longer. 
 
CABRERA: OK, thank you so much, Chloe. 
 
A pair of warning signs for the economy today as everyone debates whether we're really headed for a recession. Consumer confidence is falling and red-hot housing prices just lost a lot of momentum. 
 
I want to get to CNN's Matt Egan live from the New York Stock Exchange. 
 
Matt, what are these reports telling us about the state of the economy today? 
 
MATT EGAN, CNN REPORTER: Well, Ana, these reports show that the economy is stumbling a bit. 
 
Let's start with consumer confidence, which is basically how people feel about the economy. 
 
The conference board said that after two straight months of gains, consumer confidence took a hit in October. Inflation concerns went up, vacation plans went down. 
 
You know, this matters. Because the better people feel, the more likely they are to spend. And consumer spending is still the biggest driver of this economy. 
 
Consumers are also feeling a little bit worse about the future. Let me read you a key line from this report. 
 
"Consumer expectations regarding the short-term outlook remained dismal. The expectations index remains below levels associated with recession, suggesting recession risks appear to be rising."  
 
Now, the housing market is clearly getting hit right now by this one- two punch of very high prices and soaring mortgage rates. We learned today that home prices in August went up by 13 percent year over year. That is a big gain. But that is also a big slowdown. 
 
We were seeing 20 percent-plus gains earlier this year. The deceleration between July and August is the largest slowdown since S&amp;P/Case-Shiller started tracking this in 1987. 
 
Ana, bottom line, home prices got unsustainably high. They are now succumbing to gravity. And this correction is not done just yet. 
 
CABRERA: And, Matt, a bunch of CEOs are in Saudi Arabia right now for an investment conference. While some say a recession is likely or coming, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase says that's not even his biggest fear. 
 
EGAN: That's right. Jamie Dimon was speaking to our colleague, Richard Quest, and he said, look, there's a chance for recession in the United States.
 
But that's what he is not concerned about. He's most worried about the geopolitical situation, specifically the war in Ukraine and U.S./China tensions. 
 
CABRERA: OK. Thank you very much, Matt Egan. We didn't have the sot there. I know that's what you were waiting for. 
 
Appreciate you.
 
Minutes from now, President Biden is going to make his case for COVID boosters. He's going to get one himself. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[13:52:43]
 
CABRERA: Just minutes from now, President Biden will receive his latest COVID-19 booster, live on camera. And it'll kick off a new White House push to get Americans to follow suit and get their updated COVID shot, specifically the one that best combats the Omicron variants. 
 
Now, this morning, President Biden's COVID coordinator stressed it's just one essential tool you should take advantage of in the face of a triple threat this winter. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DR. ASHISH JHA, WHITE HOUSE COVID-19 RESPONSE COORDINATOR: We're seeing the rise of three viruses, circulation of three viruses at increasing levels, RSV, Influenza, and COVID. 
 
The good news here is that we're not powerless against this. For two of them we have very high-quality vaccines, both influenza and COVID. 
 
So the first and most important thing people can do is go out and get vaccinated because that will keep people, kids, adults, everybody out of the hospital at very high rates. So that is probably the most important thing. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CABRERA: CNN's Jeremy Diamond is live at the White House for us. 
 
Jeremy, CDC data shows uptake has been very low with this updated booster. How does the administration hope to change that? JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, it's certainly
 
 something they are tracking. It's something they are concerned about. 
 
And it's something they are now going to try and change with a series of new efforts, beginning today, by having the president get this new bivalent COVID booster vaccine, which targets the Omicron variant, very publicly on camera.
 
And also delivering remarks about what the administration is going to be doing to try and increase those numbers. 
 
I think we can put the numbers on the screen right now in terms of the percentage of people who've gotten that updated booster, and it is still very low. 
 
While 68 percent of Americans are fully vaccinated, less than 10 percent of the eligible population has actually gotten that updated booster shot. And that's about 20 million Americans. 
 
The administration does point out that it's about one in five seniors who have gotten that updated booster shot. That's certainly the population that they're most concerned about. 
 
But they will be launching a series of public relations efforts, including targeted television ads for the black, Hispanic communities as well as rural communities as well -- Ana? 
 
CABRERA: OK. Again, the president about to get another COVID booster. 
 
Appreciate that update, Jeremy. 
 
First, he allegedly apologized. Then he denied doing anything wrong. And now "Late Show" host, James Corden, admits he was, in fact, rude to a staffer at New York's well-known Balthazar restaurant. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[13:55:06]
 
JAMES CORDEN, HOST, "LATE SHOW": We sit down, we ordered, and my wife explained that she has a serious food allergy. Right? 
 
So when everybody's meals came, my wife was given the food that she was allergic to. But, no, she hadn't taken a bite of it or anything. No worries. We sent it back. All was good. 
 
As her meal came wrong to the table the third time, in the heat of the moment, I made a sarcastic rude comment, right, about cooking it myself. And it is a comment I deeply regret. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CABRERA: Last week, the owner of Balthazar accused Corden of abusing his staff, calling him a, quote, "tiny cretin of a man," and banned him from the restaurant. And unclear if that ban still holds. 
 
That does it for us today. Thanks for being here. You can always catch me, same time, same place tomorrow. 
 
The news continues right after a quick break.
