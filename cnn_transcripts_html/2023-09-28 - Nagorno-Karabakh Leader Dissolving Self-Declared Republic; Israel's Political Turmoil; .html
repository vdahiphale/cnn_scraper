<br>[14:00:00] 
 
LYNDA KINKADE, HOST, ISA SOARES TONIGHT:  A very warm welcome to the show everyone, I'm Lynda Kinkade in for Isa Soares. Tonight, we're following two 
 
 moving stories out of the United States. As the federal shutdown looms, U.S. House Republicans are attempting to push through the impeachment of 
 
 President Joe Biden. 
 
And later this hour, Biden has his own warning for America, that something dangerous is happening right now. We'll bring you his speech on the state 
 
 of democracy when it happens. Plus, two shooting incidents in Rotterdam leave at least two people dead. We'll have an update on what we know so far 
 
 just ahead. 
 
Well, U.S. House Republicans are holding the first hearing today in the impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden. They claim that he profited 
 
 off his son's business deals and abused his office. The White House denies this and the Republicans have yet to back up their claim with any type of 
 
 proof. 
 
Impeachment inquiries usually start with more evidence, but the Republicans are going forward with it, even though it's less than three days before the 
 
 government runs out of money and shuts down potentially. Well, the U.S. President is set to speak in the battleground state of Arizona this hour 
 
 and honor the legacy of late Republican Senator John McCain. 
 
We'll bring you that live when it happens. But first, I want to bring in CNN legal analyst and former federal prosecutor, Jennifer Rodgers. Good to 
 
 have you with us.  
 
JENNIFER RODGERS, CNN LEGAL ANALYST:  Good to be here. 
 
KINKADE:  So the impeachment hearing inquiry that we're seeing today is happening after almost a year of investigation. The Democrats call this a 
 
 long and discredited lie, Republicans on the other hand are saying that they've got evidence that shows President Joe Biden abused his public 
 
 office to benefit his family financially, specifically his son, Hunter. 
 
But Republicans are yet to provide at least publicly any evidence. What should we make of what's being said so far today at this hearing? 
 
RODGERS:  Well, today's hearing is really just the beginning. It's not a fact-based hearing. They brought in some expert type witnesses who kind of 
 
 laid the groundwork for why they're starting this inquiry and whether it's appropriate to start an inquiry even if they don't have the evidence yet to 
 
 actually impeach the president. 
 
So, nothing new was happening today. They say that they are issuing a lot of subpoenas and they have a lot of evidence to come. But as you've pointed 
 
 out, there have been years of investigation into the Bidens, and I personally think that if they had evidence that demonstrated an abuse of 
 
 power on the part of the current president, they would have made that public. 
 
That said, you know, they do have subpoena power and the ability to hold hearings like this. So, we'll see what they come up with. 
 
KINKADE:  Impeachment offenses are of course, treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors. What are Republicans accusing the president 
 
 of that would constitute any of those? 
 
RODGERS:  They're effectively accusing him of bribery. They're saying that when he was the vice president, that he effectively sold access to himself 
 
 and potentially sold action, official acts that he promised or that he actually did in order that people would pay his son, Hunter Biden. So, it's 
 
 effectively a bribery charge. 
 
The problem is, as we've said, we haven't seen anything to back that up, but that is the allegations that they've been working with. 
 
KINKADE:  So take us through the constitutional and legal questions that Republicans are raising, and how long is this inquiry expected to last? 
 
RODGERS:  I don't know how long it will last, (INAUDIBLE) it's really a political act, it's not a legal act. The rules of evidence don't apply, we 
 
 don't have an impartial judge who rules on events and then make other rulings. And we don't have an impartial jury who is seated to hear the case 
 
 and doesn't know anything about it, and doesn't have any stake in the outcome. 
 
Here, the jurors, of course, are the members of the House, and many of them will vote with their party regardless of what happens in the investigation. 
 
 So, it's a completely different kind of proceeding. And to your question about, you know, what are the constitutional parameters? You know, what 
 
 does the constitution and the law require? 
 <br>[14:05:00] 
 
The answer is, it's not entirely clear. I mean, these members of the house, if they do go to an impeachment vote, will vote on impeachment, and if they 
 
 have the numbers, they'll impeach him even if they actually do not provide any evidence of the allegations that they brought forward. 
 
So, it's just so far removed from the way that our justice system typically works. It's kind of like apples to oranges. But you know, there are some 
 
 Republicans more in the middle who have been skeptical about this whole process. There is a reason that they didn't actually vote to open an 
 
 inquiry in the first place. So, you know, we'll have to see where in particular those Republicans are at the end of process and see whether 
 
 they're willing to go along with an impeachment vote if the evidence hasn't been developed. 
 
KINKADE:  All right, we'll leave it there for now, Jennifer Rodgers, we have had a couple little connection issues just towards the end, but we get 
 
 your point, it's loud and clear, thanks so much. Well, hard-line -- 
 
RODGERS:  Thanks -- 
 
KINKADE:  House Republicans are the ones driving this impeachment inquiry as well as the government shutdown that now seems inevitable. I want to 
 
 bring in our politics senior reporter Stephen Collinson who joins us live from Washington. Good to see you, Stephen.
 
So I want to start with the shutdown because right now, U.S. government is warning workers that they might have to go without pay because this 
 
 deadline to reach a government -- a deal to keep the government open is midnight Saturday. There has been 21 federal government shutdowns in the 
 
 past five decades. Will we see another? 
 
STEPHEN COLLINSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICS REPORTER:  It looks very much like we will. It's almost impossible to work out a scenario how this doesn't 
 
 happen when the money from the government runs out just after midnight on Saturday evening in Washington. The reason for this is, we have an 
 
 inoperable Republican majority in the House of Representatives, both because it is so small, Kevin McCarthy, the sneaky, can only lose four 
 
 votes and still pass a bill. 
 
And because there is this wing of pro-Trump extremists right-wingers who are basically holding the speaker hostage and refusing to vote to keep the 
 
 government open without massive spending cuts, much lower than the Republicans have already agreed for the next year with President Joe Biden. 
 
 So, it looks like the only way this ever get solved is if there is a shutdown and pressure builds on McCarthy, if troops don't start -- if 
 
 troops start losing their paychecks.
 
If the air traffic control system grinds to a halt, then possibly, McCarthy will have outside leverage to bring to bear on some of these extremists. 
 
 But without that, it looks like we're heading into shutdown in a couple of days. 
 
KINKADE:  And I want to turn back if we can to the impeachment hearing underway today. Impeachment offenses as I've said, a treason, bribery, 
 
 other high crimes and misdemeanors. How do you see this hearing inquiry playing out? 
 
COLLINSON:  Well, given that constitutional standard for impeachment which you mentioned, the whole process ought to be one of the most solemn and 
 
 grave constitutional moments, and that's why it's happened very -- and frequently in American history. The hearing we saw today was none of that 
 
 really, apart from the fact that there wasn't any real evidence brought forward by Republicans to back up their charges. 
 
The evidence they did bring didn't back up what they were accusing Biden of. Which is as you said earlier, profiting from his son's business 
 
 affairs. This hearing only will add I think to perceptions of this as an attempt by Trump's allies in the house to revenge for his own double 
 
 impeachments when he was in office, and to try to weaken Biden and to mitigate some of the criminal and other issues hanging over Trump's head as 
 
 he heads into the 2024 election, presume he is the Republican nominee.
 
So, it wasn't really a very serious process, even the witnesses called by the Republicans refuted many of the thrusts of the Republican impeachment 
 
 theory. So, even from a Republican point of view, it didn't seem like a very successful hearing. 
 
KINKADE:  Yes, it certainly hasn't -- witness statements so far have -- seem to have backfired. But I have to ask you about the Republicans as a 
 
 whole because there are plenty Republicans that have come out publicly and said this should not be happening. Ken Buck of Colorado said that 
 
 Republicans are itching for an impeachment, are relying on an imagined history. How quick is that fire for Republicans? 
 
COLLINSON:  Well, the idea would be that voters get alienated by examples of extremism from the Republican Party. And it reminds them of what life 
 
 was like when Donald Trump himself was president. The -- although the extremists are the most powerful sect of the Republican majority, the 
 
 maturity was actually won by more moderate Republicans who won districts in the midterm elections in 2022 for Joe Biden carried as president in places 
 
 like Upstate New York, some areas of California. 
 <br>[14:10:00] 
 
So if those voters begin to see this as an overreach and an example of an extreme Republican Party right out of control. That could hurt the GOP in 
 
 the elections next year, and Republicans and Trump especially have had this big problem in recent elections, in which they have alienated more moderate 
 
 voters in suburban districts in key swing states like Georgia and Michigan. 
 
If that happens again, this could rebound against the Republicans. So it is a risk for them, but right now, all they're concerned about is conducting 
 
 Trump's vengeance and pleasing their most committed supporters. 
 
KINKADE:  And of course, later this hour, U.S. President Biden is going to address the nation, talking about something dangerous happening right now. 
 
 He's talking about the fight for democracy. What do you expect him to say? 
 
COLLINSON:  I think it's an interesting return to a theme that has worked for the president in the past. Especially during the midterm elections in 
 
 fact, last year, when a lot of outside observers and journalists were quite skeptical that with Trump not on the ballot, this idea that America is 
 
 under siege from an anti-democratic Republican Party, which is pushing the return of an increasingly autocratic candidate, Donald Trump. 
 
We were quite surprised, a lot of us there actually worked in the midterm elections. Biden has been having a difficult political time the last few 
 
 weeks, there's been a lot of talk about his age, whether he would get through and fully fulfill a second term, his approval rating is very low. 
 
 The public isn't believing his arguments, the economy is improving. 
 
So what we've seen is the president really getting to give the last week or so, tackling some of those issues head on, and his returning to the 
 
 argument which actually got him into the 2020 election race in the beginning, which is that Donald Trump is a clear and present danger to 
 
 American democracy. This is not a normal election, the issue on the ballot is a survival of American democracy. 
 
And I think that's what you will hear from the president, even though where, you know, this is September 2023 and not September 2024 just a few 
 
 months before the election. It's looking a lot like Trump v. Biden all over again. 
 
KINKADE:  Yes, it certainly is, and we will bring our viewers that speech live when it happens in the battleground state of Arizona. We'll leave it 
 
 there for now, Stephen Collinson, thanks so much. 
 
COLLINSON:  Thanks. 
 
KINKADE:  Well, Dutch police saying there are at least two people dead after two shootings in the city of Rotterdam. I want to go straight to our 
 
 Scott McLean who is tracking this for us from London. So, Scott, police say the shootings happened in two different places, they have a suspect in 
 
 custody. What are you learning? 
 
SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, so two separate locations, Lynda, not far from each other. Both in sort of the river-front area of Rotterdam, 
 
 not far from the city's center. So, police say that it was around mid- afternoon when a first shooting was called in. This is a residential area, what looks to be a low-rise apartment building and the footage that you see 
 
 there that we have from the scene shows emergency crews, looks like they're working on one person, helping one person on the pavement, then you can see 
 
 smoke billowing out of the actual building. 
 
According to CNN's affiliate "RTL", a 32-year-old suspect went into that building and shot dead a 39-year-old woman and injured her 14-year-old 
 
 daughter, who was seriously hurt. He then set fire to that building. Then the second location is the Rasmussen University Medical Center, it's about 
 
 a kilometer and a half or so away, a short drive, maybe 15-minute walk or so. 
 
"RTL" reports that the suspect then went inside of a classroom and shot dead a 46-year-old male teacher. This is the very same medical school where 
 
 the suspect himself was a student. And "RTL" also reports that he did in fact have a previous criminal record, he was convicted of animal abuse back 
 
 in 2021. Now, initially, police reported the suspect was wearing combat clothes, may have been on a motorcycle carrying a handgun. 
 
Where they ended up finding him was hiding underneath of a helipad on the campus of that university medical center. And while police say that this -- 
 
 these two crimes were targeted, the motive here, Lynda, is still far from clear though. 
 
KINKADE:  OK, Scott McLean for us, good to get that detail from your reporting for us from London, thank you. Well, still to come tonight, U.S. 
 
 Army soldier Travis King is back in Texas, we'll tell you the surprising country that played a role in his trip out of North Korea. Plus, more than 
 
 half of Nagorno-Karabakh's population has fled to Armenia. We'll have the latest on that crisis there. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:15:00]
 
KINKADE:  Welcome back. American soldier Travis King is back in the U.S. today. He landed in Texas early Thursday after being released by North 
 
 Korea. Officials in the U.S. thanked several countries including China for their help with his release. Here is CNN's Alex Marquardt with more. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
 
ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The announcement came as a surprise. 
 
MATTHEW MILLER, SPOKESPERSON, UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF STATE:  The United States has secured the return of Private Travis King from the 
 
 Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 
 
MARQUARDT:  Now, the U.S. expects to learn what drove Private Travis King's dramatic escapade into North Korea as well as details on his more-than two 
 
 months in North Korean custody. U.S. officials say multiple countries had undertaken intense diplomacy to free King, and that Sweden which represents 
 
 U.S. interest in North Korea played a pivotal role. 
 
MILLER:  We thank Sweden and the People's Republic of China for their assistance in facilitating that transfer. 
 
MARQUARDT:  King was taken from North Korea to the Friendship Bridge with China in Dandong, where he was met by the American ambassador and defense 
 
 attache. From there, he flew to Chen Yen in China, and then onto the U.S. Airbase Osan in South Korea, before flying back to the United States. 
 
MILLER:  We expect him to arrive in the coming hours. 
 
MARQUARDT:  The U.S. providing no clues as to why the North Koreans decided to expel King now. 
 
(on camera):  Was there anything that the North Koreans asked for or received in exchange? Was there a trade at all? 
 
MILLER:  We did not give them anything, we made no concessions as a part of securing his return.
 
MARQUARDT:  Do you have any idea why they decided to suddenly expel him? 
 
MILLER:  I am going to follow my general here, and not try to get into the heads of foreign governments and certainly not that one. 
 
MARQUARDT (voice-over):  King is set to be in good health, very happy to be free and eager to see his family. A spokesman for his mother saying in a 
 
 statement she quote, "will be forever grateful to the United States Army and all its inter-agency partners for a job well done. King's family had 
 
 previously said they didn't understand why King had done what he did. 
 
JACQUEDA GATES, SIBLING OF TRAVIS KING:  This is really hard on my mom. You know, that's her baby boy. His room is still in her house. 
 
MARQUARDT:  When King fled from the airport in Seoul, South Korea to the DMZ, he had been ordered back to Texas to face discipline after pleading 
 
 guilty in South Korea to assault, for which he was sentenced to 50 days of labor in South Korea. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE) 
 
KINKADE:  Our thanks to Alex Marquardt there. Well, China played a key role in the release of Private Travis King. So, how did this happen? I want to 
 
 bring in CNN correspondent Paula Hancocks who has more on this. It's such an intriguing story, Paula. You know, why did the private run across into 
 
 North Korea? Why did they hold him for two months? 
 <br>[14:20:00] 
 
Why was he released without conditions? And obviously, all the other international countries involved in his release. Take us through what we 
 
 know. 
 
PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  Well, Lynda, as to why he did it certainly, that's something that we're hoping for 
 
 answers, from Travis King himself. We've certainly heard from North Korea why he did it. So Pyongyang saying through state media that he was running 
 
 away from what they called racial discrimination in the United States. 
 
But we haven't heard from Travis King himself. So, that's really North Korea's version of events. Now, over the next days and weeks, certainly, 
 
 Travis King will be questioned about this. Now, we've heard from U.S. officials that the priority at this point is his health, obviously, 
 
 physical and also emotional. We don't know what conditions he's been under for the past couple of months in North Korea. 
 
But they will be interested to know exactly what North Korea asked him, and of course, what information he may have given them. Now, North Korea did 
 
 say that they had carried out what they called an investigation, what everyone else widely believes to be extensive questioning of this army 
 
 private. 
 
They may not have been privy to any specific information, certainly no confidential information, but he is still a U.S. soldier who was stationed 
 
 in South Korea. So, certainly, there would have been extensive questioning of this individual, and that's the sort of thing that U.S. officials would 
 
 like to know about what information potentially did North Korea gauge from him? 
 
There is an overwhelming feeling among many who follow North Korea. That North Korea potentially had what they needed from this individual. They had 
 
 questioned him and they simply wanted then to give him back. It does potentially show that there is very little will on North Korea's side to 
 
 want to engage with Washington or with Seoul. 
 
We've seen Kim Jong-un in Russia, we've seen him get closer to the Russian President Vladimir Putin, and in the past in this situation, a detainee, 
 
 certainly, a U.S. detainee could be used as a bargaining chip to entice a high-level U.S. individual to Pyongyang. We've seen former U.S. Presidents 
 
 go to Pyongyang to try and secure the release of detainees. 
 
There was none of that this time. We heard from North Korea, he would be expelled. They didn't have -- it appears, the interest in having a high 
 
 profile U.S. guest to come to Pyongyang to lobby for someone's release. So, the way that, that is being interpreted in many circles is that it shows 
 
 just how little Pyongyang has a desire to speak to Washington at this point. 
 
KINKADE:  All right, Paula Hancocks, we'll leave it there for now. Paula Hancocks reporting for us in Seoul, South Korea. Thank you. Well, Ukrainian 
 
 air defenses have shot down more than 30 drones as Russian forces launched attacks on southern Ukraine and the Odesa region. That's according to 
 
 military officials. 
 
The action coming during an unannounced visit to Kyiv by NATO Secretary- General Jens Stoltenberg. He issued this assessment of the Ukrainian counteroffensive. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
JENS STOLTENBERG, SECRETARY-GENERAL, NATO:  Today, your forces are moving forward. They face fierce fighting, but they're gradually gaining ground. 
 
 Every meter that Ukrainian forces regains, is a meter that Russia loses.  
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
KINKADE:  Well, NATO has donated billions of dollars worth of weapons to Ukraine, but has stopped short of bringing it into the alliance. Well, 
 
 still to come tonight, the president of Nagorno-Karabakh says the self- declared republic will no longer exist in 2024. I'll be speaking to Armenia's ambassador at-large about the growing crisis there. 
 
Also, ahead, the cleanup begins after Greece is hit by yet another storm. But things could get worse with more rain on the way. We'll have a live 
 
 weather report.  
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 <br>[14:25:00]
 
KINKADE:  Have you with us. Well, we are waiting for U.S. President Joe Biden to deliver an address and issue a stark warning. It will be about 
 
 Donald Trump, the Republican presidential frontrunner, and likely nominee who could face Biden next November. 
 
Specifically, the president will focus on what he calls the danger that Trump poses to America's democracy. Biden will speak at an invent also 
 
 honoring his close friend, the late U.S. Senator John McCain of Arizona. And of course, we will bring that to you live. 
 
Well, the self-declared republic of Nagorno-Karabakh will cease to exist from next year. Its president has signed a decree dissolving state 
 
 institutions from January after Azerbaijan seized control of the region last week. As a reminder, Nagorno-Karabakh lies within Azerbaijan borders, 
 
 but has for decades operated autonomously with a de facto government of its own. 
 
Well, thousands of ethnic Armenians have already fled the state and that number keeps rising. Our Scott McLean reports. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
 
MCLEAN (voice-over):  The satellite images show the scale of the exodus from Nagorno-Karabakh, a seemingly endless snaking line of vehicles 
 
 interrupted only by the military checkpoints along the way. This video released by Azerbaijan shows police handing out water to waiting cars, 
 
 though some inside fear what or who else they might be looking for. 
 
Aid is getting into Nagorno-Karabakh, but the U.S. State Department says it could be days before a mission of international observers is organized. 
 
 That may be too little, too late. 
 
NIKOL PASHINYAN, PRIME MINISTER, ARMENIA (through translator):  Analysis of the situation shows that in the coming days, there will be no Armenians 
 
 left in Nagorno-Karabakh. This is an act of ethnic cleansing. 
 
MCLEAN:  There also won't be anything resembling an independent state either. The president of the break-away Armenian majority region says, the 
 
 self-declared republic of Nagorno-Karabakh ceases its existence. Clearly, not by choice, but due to the current difficult military political 
 
 situation. And to ensure that ethnic Armenians including the militants who lay down their weapons can get out. 
 
Well over half of the Nagorno-Karabakh population has reached Armenia. And officials say the pace has not slowed down. They come packed into cars, 
 
 buses or in the backs of trucks, carrying whatever they can. Some, overwhelmed by their sudden new reality. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  We had horrific days. I could have never imagined that we would come to this point. We're leaving our caravan 
 
 (ph) and going away. 
 
MCLEAN (voice-over):  Zhaklin Avetisyan is a doctor in Armenia, seeing patients soon after they arrive, hungry, stressed, depressed or worse. 
 
DR. ZHAKLIN AVETISYAN (through translator):  The situation is very bad, especially for the children. They mostly have a cold. For example, one 
 
 group came in a open body car. They were under the rain for two days. Imagine how cold and soaked they were. 
 
MCLEAN (voice-over):  Prominent business man, philanthropist and former state minister of the separatist government, Ruben Vardanyan, did not make 
 
 it to Armenia. Video published by Azerbaijan's security services showed him being forcefully led into a cell by masked soldiers. 
 
Now he has been accused of financing terror and involvement with illegal armed groups, though Baku has not presented evidence. And the forces that 
 
 Azerbaijan considers illegal, Armenian separatists considered their legitimate army -- Scott McLean, CNN, London. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
KINKADE:  For more on all this, I want to bring the Armenian ambassador at large, Edmon Marukyan. He joins me now from Armenia. 
 
Good to have you with us. 
 
EDMON MARUKYAN, ARMENIAN AMBASSADOR AT LARGE:  Thank you, thank you. 
 
KINKADE:  Ambassador, tens of thousands of people have now fled the region. According to our interviews, they are hungry, traumatized, some with just 
 
 the clothes on their back. Even a newborn baby, just two weeks old, one of the many fleeing with their family. 
 
How would you describe what's unfolding?
 
MARUKYAN:  So what's happening, it's very well organized, first of all, very well planned and organized and executed ethnic cleansing against 
 
 peaceful people of Nagorno-Karabakh. And at this moment, already 78,000 people crossed the border. 
 
And of course, it is a big humanitarian crisis for Armenia as well because a small country with small resources, it's a very big crisis. We expect 
 
 more and more. 
 
And after this invasion, after Azerbaijani military attack on September 19, Armenian people, people in Nagorno-Karabakh, they cannot imagine how 
 
 they're going to leave their ancestral homeland because of these attacks, because of these violations, mass violations. 
 
And no one guaranteed the rights and securities under any mechanism before we were talking about international mechanism. Under any mechanism, to 
 
 leave and continue (INAUDIBLE) their homeland. 
 
So they are, all of them, they are forced to leave their ancestral land and they are refugees now in Armenia. So to me, as a lawyer, it is a violation, 
 
 it is a crime against humanity. And it is clearly well orchestrated ethnic cleansing committed by the leadership of Azerbaijan. 
 
KINKADE:  Ambassador, the government of the self declared republic Nagorno- Karabakh has been forced dissolve parliament and the president of the region says it will cease to exist from next year. 
 
What does that mean --
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
KINKADE:  -- for those that stay behind?
 
MARUKYAN:  Well, you know what?
 
In what condition is the, you know, the president of the Nagorno-Karabakh sign this document? 
 
In what condition he is?
 
In what condition they are? 
 
So we are talking about people who became hostages in this military attack without -- by any protection, without any right, without any guarantees. 
 
As you know, already, we have illegally detained people from a (INAUDIBLE) bridge and, you know, (INAUDIBLE) the people to human rights, to secure the 
 
 right to life and to protect them from torturers. 
 
But this is happening and they already have more information coming, they have lists of about a couple hundreds people, to detain and bring them to 
 
 Baku prisons. Until now, we have (INAUDIBLE) in Azerbaijan, Azerbaijani prison. Also Syrians (ph) in Azerbaijani prisons, who were kept with 
 
 violation of this (INAUDIBLE) statement. 
 
It was signed in November 2020. 
 <br>[14:35:00]
 
KINKADE:  And just to be clear, Nagorno-Karabakh has been home to Armenians for centuries. But internationally, it's recognized as being part of 
 
 Azerbaijan. The foreign policy advisor to Azerbaijan's president spoke in Brussels on Tuesday. And he had this to say. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HIKMET HAJIYEV, FOREIGN POLICY ADVISER TO THE PRESIDENT:  Azerbaijan doesn't have any (INAUDIBLE) goals and objectives of the sovereign 
 
 territory of the Republic of Armenia. That is not completely out of Azerbaijan's agenda. 
 
Azerbaijan is only intruding there so (INAUDIBLE) integrity and also recent counterterrorism actions on the ground for very limited and local by nature 
 
 and it was a very short period of time that has been engaged. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KINKADE:  So he speaks very fast but basically he was saying that Azerbaijan doesn't have any military objectives. This battle to retake the 
 
 region, though, has claimed the lives of at least 200 people; hundreds more injured, tens of thousands have fled that are nondisplaced. 
 
What is Azerbaijan's objective, as you understand it?
 
MARUKYAN:  So Azerbaijan objectives is the population of the (INAUDIBLE) of Nagorno-Karabakh. So we were talking during the negotiations about people. 
 
 All our questions that we were raising are about people. 
 
They were concentrated on lands so need lands without people because, for them, the people became a problem. Because these people, arguing and 
 
 fighting for their rights, for their freedoms, and it's not now -- I mean, it's already more than 30 years, if we look at collapse of the Soviet 
 
 Union. 
 
So what's happening here, so after the self declaration of independence, they started to bring their statehood (ph) and they built institutions, 
 
 state institutions and about terrorists, they're talking about terrorists. There are no terrorists. 
 
So the (INAUDIBLE) institutions in Azerbaijan talks to this institutions, these military against these institutions. Doesn't matter. Civilian doesn't 
 
 matter. Military, but this attacks are against institutions that these people are building. 
 
So of course, nobody recognized the independence of the Nagorno-Karabakh but the Nagorno-Karabakh always had autonomy, always had self government 
 
 and self-governance. 
 
So what will happen after this?
 
So they just were arguing that you must dissolve everything. And we are not going to guarantee any rights and securities on the international 
 
 mechanism. 
 
That means that these people must leave the territory; otherwise, we already know what's going happen with that. As you said, (INAUDIBLE) were 
 
 killed, wounded; people are in Baku prisons tortured. 
 
KINKADE:  We'll have to leave it there for now but we do appreciate your time. Ambassador Edmon Marukyan of Armenia, thank you very much. 
 
MARUKYAN:  Thank you. Thank you for having me. Thanks.
 
KINKADE:  Well, and on Monday on this show, we will be joined by the Azerbaijan ambassador to the U.K., Elin Suleymanov. We heard his view very 
 
 briefly in this interview but we will have much more from him on the ongoing crisis in Nagorno-Karabakh. 
 
Historic rainfall has shut down parts of central Greece after thousands of people were evacuated. Roads, businesses and homes were underwater. Several 
 
 months of rain came down in less than a day. These communities are still struggling to recover from a deadly storm that just hit two weeks ago.

VASSILIS KOURSOVITIS, HOMEOWNER:  The catastrophe last night was biblical. The river overflowed, the water was two meters high. An oil mill was 
 
 damaged and the oil tanks spilled into the street. 
 
We stayed at our homes to avoid harm. I was afraid; the water had reached here to my chest. I was afraid and I stayed in the house and I kept 
 
 thinking I would drown.

KINKADE:  People there are bracing for even more rain.

KINKADE:  An update on the story we are following. A third victim, a 14 year old girl, has now died of her injuries in the Netherlands shooting. 
 
 She is the daughter of the 39-year-old who was also killed. 
 
Police have a 32-year-old suspect in custody and they say the victims were targeted. The first shooting took place at a house, where a woman and a 
 
 girl were shot and killed. The second at a classroom at the Erasmus University Medical Center. Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte is offering his 
 
 condolences to the victims and their families. 
 
Still to come tonight, should it be harder to remove a prime minister from office?
 
Israel's supreme court is looking at a law critics say personally protects Benjamin Netanyahu.

KINKADE:  Welcome back. I'm Lynda Kinkade. Good to have you with us. 
 
Israel's supreme court heard challenges a new law that makes it harder to declare a prime minister unfit for office. The hearing wrapped up just a 
 
 few hours ago. It is not clear when we will have a ruling. 
 
The law could apply to any prime minister; the critics say it is built to shield the current leader, Benjamin Netanyahu. His efforts to overhaul the 
 
 courts have been met with mass protests. 
 
And Mr. Netanyahu has been on trial for alleged corruption, which he denies. To break down what's at stake, CNN's Hadas Gold joins me now from 
 
 Jerusalem. 
 
Good to have you with us. Netanyahu is obviously facing this ongoing corruption trial. And this law that was passed earlier this year would make 
 
 it harder to remove someone like him, a prime minister, from office. Take us through the arguments and the appeal that happened in the Supreme Court 
 
 today. 
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Of all the cases being heard in the supreme court, this could have the most direct significant personal 
 
 impact on Benjamin Netanyahu and his ability to serve. 
 
It's because his hearing today heard challenges to the law that was passed essentially to help protect Benjamin Netanyahu. This was passed very 
 
 quickly in March and it essentially put down into law that the only way you can remove a prime minister from office for declaring him unfit to serve is 
 
 for physical or mental reasons. 
 
The prime minister can do it themselves or a supermajority in the Israeli cabinet ratified by the Israeli parliament could then remove a prime 
 
 minister from office. If you know anything about Israeli politics, getting a supermajority in the parliament is very difficult to do. 
 
To be clear, there wasn't any sort of settled law before this passed about exactly how you can remove a prime minister from office. But case law had 
 
 suggested the attorney general could do it. 
 
As you noted, Benjamin Netanyahu has been facing an ongoing corruption trial and there were serious possibilities that the attorney general would 
 
 have declared Benjamin Netanyahu unfit for office because of the circumstances surrounding his ongoing corruption trial.
 
Again, he's denied all the charges. But this law was passed, seen very much as protecting Netanyahu. And today in court, we actually heard from the 
 
 lawyers representing the parliament, essentially admitting, yes, sure; this law does help Benjamin Netanyahu. 
 
But they believe it should stand because they say, if the supreme court knocks it down, they argue the supreme court would be doing damage to 
 
 democracy, taking away the millions of votes who voted for Benjamin Netanyahu, wanting him in power. 
 
The petitioners who were arguing for the law to be annulled, they say it is a misuse of constituent power. And the attorney general, a member of the 
 
 government technically, does not necessarily political ally of the prime minister, she's on the opposite end of the government on this. 
 
Lawyers representing her said that a basic law cannot be used as a kind of private resource that removes personal problems from the field of morality 
 
 and criminal law. They are arguing that at minimum if the law is not going to be taken down, at least it should be delayed. 
 
It should only take effect in the next parliament, which could be a few years from now. We do know this case needs to be decided by January when 
 
 some of the justices retire but it is possible we will likely get a decision on this specific case possibly within the next few weeks. 
 
KINKADE:  We will check in with you in the coming weeks with regards to that. Good to have you with us, thanks so much. 
 
We are tracking the aftermath of a deadly wedding hall fire in northern Iraq. The interior minister says 14 people have been arrested amid 
 
 allegations of negligence and corruption. 
 
This comes as funerals have begun. Authorities say illegal building materials fueled the blaze that killed at least 100 people. Scores more 
 
 were injured. I'm going to show you video of the moment the fire began. We need to warn that some viewers may find this disturbing.

KINKADE (voice-over):  It shows a packed venue, celebrating a young couple's marriage. The fireworks shoot up during a dance. That is when the 
 
 wedding turns into a nightmare. 
 
Sparklers light the ceiling on fire and send people running for their lives. The guests say the bride and groom survived but are, obviously, 
 
 devastated.

KINKADE:  Texas governor Greg Abbott is hitting back at criticism surrounding his response to the migrant crisis. He says, while New York 
 
 City officials believe their situation is unsustainable, Abbott says his state has endured it for years. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOV. GREG ABBOTT (R-TX):  But I can tell you, what you're dealing with in New York, what you're seeing and witnessing in the state, is a tiny 
 
 fraction of what is happening every single day in the state of Texas. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KINKADE:  Abbott also defended his efforts to bus migrants to cities in the northeast, saying migrants often choose New York as their destination.

KINKADE:  CNN's David Culver is in Mexico and gives us a glimpse at the difficult journey these migrants are making. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DAVID CULVER, CNN SENIOR U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  We're here in southern Mexico and we're walking with a group of migrants, we actually met 
 
 this group in Guatemala. And they have been making the trek for about 18 days. They're originally from Venezuela. A couple of families and some 
 
 other stragglers who have come together and they've gotten to know each other along the way.
 
Interestingly enough, the reason we're walking right now with them and some of them are trying to hurry up is because they're trying to go around a 
 
 migration checkpoint. They were picked up on the riverbank on the Mexico side. And they were taken in a van.
 
They of course, had to pay and brought to just before the checkpoint, that's when they were all unloaded. And you can see that's where these 
 
 folks are walking behind high grass. And they're finding their way to catch up with that same van but on the other side of the checkpoint.
 
We should point out; we're able to go around it because we can choose any route we're here illegally. They are not in Mexico legally, that they have 
 
 not entered any of the countries since leaving Venezuela legally. Their hope is, of course, like everyone else to get to the U.S.
 
But this just shows you how extensive even what is normally an hour drive and what's going to be a whole day for them turns out to be.

KINKADE:  Our thanks to David Culver. 
 
Still to come, we pay tribute to the beloved Harry Potter star, Sir Michael Gambon.

We end the show with some sad news. Unfortunately, beloved Irish actor Sir Michael Gambon has died at the age of 82. He's known for his extensive 
 
 catalog of work across television, film and radio, his career beginning on stage in the 1960s. 
 <br>[14:55:00]
 
KINKADE:  But it wasn't until the '80s that he became a household name, playing the lead in the miniseries, "The Singing Detective," though it was 
 
 as the Hogwarts' headmaster Dumbledore in the Harry Potter franchise that he will perhaps be best remembered. 
 
(VIDEO CLIP, "HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX") 
 
KINKADE:  In the words of Sir Michael's Dumbledore, "Do not pity the dead. Pity the living and, above all, those who live without love." 
 
I'm Lynda Kinkade. Good to have you with us today. 
 
Before we go, we are waiting to hear from the U.S. president, who is going to deliver an address on what the White House is calling the threat to U.S.
