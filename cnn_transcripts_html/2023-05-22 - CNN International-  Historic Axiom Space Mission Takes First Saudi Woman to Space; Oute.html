MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR:  In Kansas City, Missouri, three people are dead and two more are injured following a shooting at a nightclub early on Sunday. Police say all five victims are believed to be adults. The two people injured remain hospitalized, one in critical condition, the other stable. Police are asking anyone with information to come forward. They are offering a reward of up to $25,000. 
 
Authorities in New York are working to identify the cause of death for two boys. These bodies were found in two different rivers in Manhattan late last week. Police believe 11-year-old Alfa Barrie and 13-year-old Garrett Warren were friends. They were last seen walking together in Harlem sometime between May the 12th and May the 13th. They were each reported missing just a day or two later, the bodies were found more than two miles away from one another. 
 
At least 230 people have been arrested at an annual Jeep gathering in Texas. Authorities say most of those arrested face misdemeanor charges. Large crowds flock to the Crystal Beach event every year in Jeeps and other vehicles to drink and to party. Police say things have been more or less under control this year.

MAJ. RAY NOLEN, GALVESTON COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE:  Overall, it's been a successful event. We've had, you know, about the same number of arrests that we had last year. And we feel like we've got a pretty good handle on the overall safety of it. And we're just trying to get through today and tomorrow and get everybody home safe.

FOSTER:  Still to come, another all-private crew of astronauts launches into space. After the break, we'll tell you which member of the Axiom 2 mission makes history there. Also ahead, a typhoon is growing stronger in the Western Pacific. Our
 
 meteorologist Britley Ritz is tracking where the storm is heading.

BRITLEY RITZ, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  And the latest model rounds are already starting to come in and there has been a slight shift. I'll tell you what that means for Guam with the impacts in terms of rain and wind -- here in just a few minutes. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[04:35:00]
 
FOSTER:  Welcome back to CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Max Foster, if you're just joining us, let me bring you up to date with the top stories in this hour. 
 
In the coming hours, the U.S. president will hold another round of talks on the U.S. debt limit with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. There are only ten days left before the June 1 deadline when the U.S. government could default on its debt. 
 
And Bryan Kohberger, the suspect in the murder of four University of Idaho students is set to appear in court later today. He was indicted last week on four counts of murder and one count of burglary. He's expected to enter a plea for those charges.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Three, two, one, engines full power. And liftoff, Falcon 9. Go, Axiom. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER:  A successful launch for AX-2. The latest all-private spaceflight from Axiom Space. The craft will soon dock with the International Space Station carrying four private astronauts. Among them the first Saudi woman in space. Stem cell researcher, Rayyanah Barnawi will spend the next eight days conducting breast cancer research before returning to earth with the three other crew members. CNN's Carlos Suarez has more on Sunday's launch. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
CARLOS SUAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  The mission commander called it a phenomenal ride into space. The Axiom-2 mission is on its way to the International Space Station after lifting off from Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Sunday. According to Axiom Space it'll take the four-member crew 16 hours to get to the ISS where the crew will spend about eight days. 
 
The stage 1 rocket booster successfully landed at Kennedy Space Center some eight minutes after liftoff. A sonic boom was heard as the rocket landed. Two Americans and two Saudis make up the Axiom-2 crew. Commander Peggy
 
 Whitson is a former NASA astronaut who has spent 665 days in space and served as commander of the International Space Station. She's joined by mission pilot John Shoffner, Ali Alqarni and Rayyanah Barnawi, our mission specialist. Barnawi made history on Sunday, becoming the first Saudi woman in space.

FOSTER:  From a historic flight to one that didn't go smoothly, a passenger on a Frontier Airlines flight that was preparing to leave Denver was cited for assault a flight attendant after being asked to leave the plane. It's unclear why the woman was asked to get off but the airlines say she struck the flight attendant with an intercom phone. The are deal cause the plane to take off nearly 4 hours late, according to Flight Aware tracking data. Police say the passenger had to book another flight home. 
 
Typhoon Mawar is again gaining strength in the Western Pacific. And it's also slowing down as it heads for Guam. The outer bands are already starting to impact the U.S. island territory. The typhoon is currently the equivalent to a category 2 Atlantic hurricane. Heavy rainfall, flooding, damaging winds and high surf are possible as the storm moves ashore in the days ahead. Meteorologist Britley Ritz is at the CNN Weather Center with the latest on the typhoon in his current path -- Britley.
 
RITZ:  Yes, we do have strengthening, and winds are now at 105 miles per hour as the center low continues to deepen. You can tell by the convection, all of that deep red, and the outer bands already starting to move into Guam today. At 125 miles per hour gusts moving north- northwest at 7 miles per hour. So, yes, it slowed down and is taking on this warm ocean water. We're talking about sea surface temperatures that are nearly in the mid-80s Fahrenheit. And that's just fuel for the system to really take hold. 
 
And typhoon warnings for Rota and Guam, in tropical storm warnings for the Northern Islands where winds are already starting to pick up and even more so through the next 24 hours. Winds of 115 miles per hour expected to be a major typhoon just before landfall. Further threatening as it moves back out to sea as it passes the islands within the next 120 hours. We can have winds of 150 miles per hour that will make it a category 4 storm if it comes to that fruition. 
 
Notice the model runs, the latest coming in pushing it further south. The European now starting to differ a bit from the GFS -- the American model. If this is the case for the European, it would make a direct impact to Guam. 
 <br>[04:40:04]
 
The last time that would have happened which would have been back in 2018 would be Maria. And that would push in all of the wind and the water causing storm surge. Four to six feet of storm surge for the islands. And not only that, but heavy, heavy rain. And the island of Guam, bringing in roughly about 10 to 12 inches of rain when it is all said and done. So, the rain really doesn't start to taper back until we move in into the weekend. 
 
So, here's your rainfall totals over the next five days. Notice the purples, that is again, 10 to 15 inches of rain. Folks, we have had quite a few storms since 1945, 27 in the month of May, for the West Pac. Again, this type of Mawar, would be the first landfall in several, several years. So, we can expect that, Max, here in the upcoming 24 hours. 
 
FOSTER:  Indeed, Britley, thank you so much for that. 
 
Now after cutting short her trip to Japan for the G7 Summit, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has returned home and visited the flood ravaged northern region. On Sunday, residents there are cleaning up the damage from the flooding and the mudslides which killed at least 14 people.

 A massive fire has gutted the historic Manila Central Post Office in the Philippines capital. The fire broke out late on Sunday and teams of firefighters battled it for more than seven hours overnight before finally getting it under control. The post office was first built in 1926, then rebuilt in 1946, after it was badly damaged in World War II. It sits near other tourist landmarks. No word on the cause of the fire or any injuries.

FOSTER:  Germany's chancellor has called on North Korea to end its ballistic missile test tests saying they're a threat to peace and security in the region. Chancellor Olaf Scholz made the remarks on Sunday after visiting the Korean Demilitarized Zone that separates the north from the south.

The U.S. State Department says it's deeply troubled by an order by Israel allowing its citizens to establish a permanent presence on private Palestinian land in the West Bank. In a statement on Sunday, the spokesperson says the move is inconsistent with the Israeli government's commitments to the Biden administration. 
 
Meanwhile, the Palestinian Health Ministry says Israeli forces shot and killed three Palestine men during an incursion in a refugee camp in the West Bank city of Nablus. Israel Army radio reported they were killed in an exchange of fire with Israel Defense Forces. The Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade has claimed the three as fighters. 
 
Pakistan's former Prime Minister Imran Khan is lashing out at the law- and-order situation in his country. Speaking to CNN on Sunday, Khan says there is, quote no rule of law and the Pakistani government is violating the constitution and its rights -- and his right. Khan has been involved in a tense standoff with the country's military for months leading to violent protests. For more on this, let's go to CNN's Paula Hancocks who joining us live from Seoul in South Korea -- Paula. 
 
PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Max, Imran Khan was speaking to Fareed Zakaria on CNN this weekend. And he said that what is happening to his country at the moment is an attempt to dismantle democracy. Now he has been criticizing the current government heavily. Also criticizing the army chief. 
 
Imran khan was deposed in April of last year in a no confidence vote. And he has consistently said that he believes the army chief was behind it. He wasn't pained so not to say he was against the military itself. The military is very powerful in Pakistan. And he just wanted to point out that the army chief was the one who was behind trying to get him out of power. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KHAN:  All I know is that the last six months he just worked to remove my government and he's -- he's openly afterwards in an interview claimed that he decided that I was too dangerous for the country and so my government was ousted.
 
Since then, all I have said is that the solution to Pakistan's problems are free and fair elections. Because that's the only thing that will bring political stability in this country. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HANCOCKS:  And those elections at this point are pegged for October. Now, Imran also talked about the fact there were thousands. He said 10,000 workers who had been arrested -- this is in the past couple of weeks with the unrest and protesters against his arrest. And then he was subsequently let out on bail. He says at the moment, he's in Lahore, in his house that is surrounded by police. 
 
And tomorrow, on Tuesday, he is expected to go to Islamabad to face another court case, and to deal with bail in the city. And he said there is an 80 percent chance he believes that he will be rearrested. Now of course, the concern about that is what the protest will look like. He has tremendous support in Pakistan and there are likely to be many that come out on the street if he is rearrested -- Max. 
 
FOSTER:  OK. Paula Hancocks in Seoul, thank you.
