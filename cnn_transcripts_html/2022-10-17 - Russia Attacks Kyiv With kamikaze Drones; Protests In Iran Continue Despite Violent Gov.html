LAILA HARRAK, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome to all of our viewers watching from around the world. I'm Laila Harrak. Head on CNN Newsroom.
 
Iran is experiencing its most intense unrest in decades over the death of Mahsa Amini for a month, and now Iran's President is blaming the U.S. for inciting at all.
 
Plus, Russia's attacks in Ukraine Zaporizhzhia region are targeting schools and other structures with missiles.
 
And China's President is poised to tighten his grip on power. We'll learn how his speech is being received a day after his address to the Communist Party Congress.
 
We begin this hour with new developments out of Ukraine where several explosions have rocked the capital Kyiv. And one official says they were the result of kamikaze drones. CNN's Clarissa Ward is in Kyiv and update us -- updated us on the situation just a short time ago.
 
(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)
 
CLASSIRA WARD, CNN CHIEF ITNERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It started about 6:45 this morning, the second explosion was by far the loudest seeming to indicate that it was in a sort of central location within the city. The mayor of Kyiv, Vitaly Klitschko, on his Telegram channel says that a couple of the blasts occurred in this Shevchenkiv District advising people to essentially stay in their shelters until the air raid was finished and saying that emergency services had been sent to the site.
 
But the more detailed update that we've been given now by Andriy Yermak, the Chief of Staff for the Office of the Presidency is that the Capitol was attacked with in his words, quote, kamikaze drones. And he goes on to say in this statement, the Russians think it will help them. But these actions look like agony. We need more air defense as soon as possible. No time for slow actions, more weapons to protect the sky and destroy the enemy and it will happen. No word yet on casualties of whether anyone was hurt or killed possibly in these attacks, obviously, last Monday's barrage is very fresh in everyone's minds here. So just a reminder that things remain grim and difficult here in the Capitol.
 
(END AUDIO CLIP)
 
HARRAK: Clarissa Ward there. Well, meantime a senior Ukrainian official says Sunday marked a deadly day for civilians in southern and eastern Ukraine. At least 10 civilians were killed and 14 injured, with most of the deaths being reported in the Donetsk region. Russian attacks were also reported in the Zaporizhzhia, Kharkiv and Kherson regions. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy had this update on the situation on the ground.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): The situation on the frontline has not changed significantly over the last day. The key hotspots in Donbas are Soledar in Bakhmut. Very heavy fighting is going on there.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK: And while the fighting grinds on Ukraine's ambassador to the U.S. spoke about the urgent need for more weapons.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
OKSANA MARKAROVA, UKRAINIAN AMBASSADOR TO THE US: We still need all the weapons we're talking about with air defense being a priority after this horrible strikes that we all seen return and not only to select cities but everywhere in Ukraine and especially in Kyiv and infrastructure before the winter.
 
Unfortunately, these systems difficult to produce and they're not ready on the shelves waiting but we're doing everything possible and asking our partners to do everything possible to speed up not only the delivery but also the ordering of the systems.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK: Well meantime in Russia, the ruling political party says it's helping organize the evacuation of families with children from the Kherson region. United Russia says those families will go on quote, holiday in other regions of Russia. Kherson is one of four Ukrainian regions illegally annexed by Russia last month.
 
While Ukrainian forces in the Kharkiv region are now refitting military tanks captured from Russian troops.
 <br>[01:05:00]
 
In one district reclaimed by Ukraine last month, forces could be seen checking the condition of the tanks and marking them with Ukrainian signs. One soldier says the tanks are functional and will be used in future battles.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): The new Russian T-72B3 tank that was captured from the Russian military and we will fight on it and inflict maximum damage to the Russian troops who came to our land, who trample our land. We will free Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK: Well in the southern city of Mykolaiv it's now been months since Ukrainians there have had access to clean drinking water. Some were carrying empty plastic bottles as they stood in line for water on Sunday. Well, despite came from a well at a local tram depot according to the driver who delivered it. The city's regular water supply has been caught off by the war.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): They blew up a water pipeline in some village since then the mayor can't reestablish water supply to our town because active fighting is going on there. Our people can't get there.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (through translator): We haven't had water for around six months. We have technical water from the southern Bug River. But it's only technical water that you can't drink. So we use the technical water and fill up on drinking water.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK: It's been one month since anti-government protesters stormed the streets of Iran after the death of a 22-year-old woman in police custody. Mahsa Amini died last month after being detained by Iran so called morality police for allegedly violating the country's strict dress code for women. CNN obtained this video from the pro-reform activist outlet Iran wire.
 
Her death has ignited one of the biggest uprisings towards Iran Islamist regime in years, and Tehran has responded by unleashing a brutal and deadly crackdown on demonstrators. President Joe Biden says the U.S. stands with Iran citizens and he's calling on Tehran to quote end the violence against its own citizens for exercising their fundamental rights. Mr. Biden's remarks sparked an angry response from Iran's President.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
EBRAHIM RAISI, IRANIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): It is our belief that America is behind the majority of destruction, terror, riots and chaos in the region and the world. It affirms our belief and the world's beliefs that Americans are angered and upset by every innovation, every happiness or good that happens to Iran.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK: While the Biden administration says steps are being taken to sanction Iran's regime while supporting Iranian protesters.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JAKE SULLIVAN, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: We are taking a range of aggressive actions to try to support the protesters in Iran. The first thing that we're doing is trying to hold accountable those brutal officials in the Iranian regime who are cracking down on protesters, killing protesters, beating protesters. We have sanctioned the morale -- the so called morality police. We have sanctioned senior officials who have participated in the brutal crackdown and repression. We've sanctioned the communications minister who is responsible for trying to cut off the internet from Iranians communicating with one another.
 
And then we've taken steps to try to make it easier for brave Iranians, the women and citizens of Iran standing up for their dignity, to be able to talk to one another and to be able to talk to the world.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK: Well, we're also following unrest at a prison in Tehran. Casualties are now reported from Saturday's fire inside a prison where Iran's political dissidents are held. CNN's Nada Bashir reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER (on camera): Well, several prisoners have been confirmed dead and dozens injured after a fire broke out at Iran's notorious Evin prison on Saturday. According to state media, the facility in Tehran has gained infamy for the detention of political prisoners, including human rights activists, lawyers, journalists and professors, as well as foreign nationals.
 
And while CNN is not able to independently verify what caused the fire, some details have emerged from pro-reform organizations. In footage obtained by activist group 1,500 to severe, gunfire and alarms can be heard in the background as flames engulf the prison complex.
 
Meanwhile, pro-reform news outlet Iran wire reported on Saturday that a source within the prison said a revolt had taken place and part of the facility that a fire has subsequently ensued. Now government authorities on Saturday were quick to assert that the situation had been brought under control with a security official telling state media that the fire had started after a group of thugs set fire to a clothing warehouse in the complex, adding that the so called rioters responsible had been separated from other detainees.
 <br>[01:10:11]
 
Of course, while the Iranian regime claims this fire is not connected to the protest movement sweeping the country, it is impossible to ignore the context here. The incident comes at a time when the regime is facing one of its toughest challenges in years, with process not only gaining momentum, but also morphing into a much broader call for regime change. On Saturday, U.S. President Joe Biden expressed his solidarity with the Iranian people, drawing (ph) criticism from Iran's foreign ministry spokesman who said Sunday that Iran remains unfazed by the intervention of foreign politicians and would not give into the U.S. government's quote, cruel sanctions and absurd threats. This of course, as the regime's brutal and deadly crackdown on protesters, and any sign of dissent for that matter continues across the country. Nada Bashir, CNN, London.
 
(END VIDEO TAPE)
 
HARRAK: Nada Bashir just reported. Iranian authorities are blaming the prisoners for setting the fire and say it's not connected to the protest movement. CNN's Fareed Zakaria weighs in on the incident.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
FAREED ZAKARIA, HOST, FAREED ZAKARIA GPS: This is a very tough regime. It has jailed people, it has tortured people, it has, you know, executed people. They are pretty ruthless about political opposition. And it started, you know, from the first days, Khomeini and on his deathbed, and sentenced 4,000 political prisoners to death.
 
So, you know, anything is possible. I'm not quite sure I don't understand the logic of doing it this way, rather than just rounding people up and shooting them or whatever it is, maybe this was a convenient way to do it. But the bottom line is lots of people in Iran not believe it was an accident.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK: I want to bring in Negar Mortazavi, a journalist and host of the Iran Podcast. She joins me now from Washington DC, a very good day, Negar. We are witnessing incredible moments unfold in Iran acts of civil disobedience, nationwide protests and this movement led by women has struck such accord with Iranian society work conditions right for protests.
 
NEGAR MORTAZAVI, JOURNALIST AND HOST, "THE IRAN PODCAST": Yes, indeed. So these protests are building up on mass protests that have been happening over the years, the largest in 2009, with the largest since the 1979 revolution back then the student movement, the 2019 protests in response to hiking gas prices, and then teachers, unions, laborers, oil workers, it's an intersectional community of protesters, and at the core of it, obviously, it's women girls and their allies, who are protesting government corruption with underlying economic, political, social and cultural grievances against the state.
 
HARRAK: Now, obviously, we're also seeing some shocking scenes of merciless, deadly crackdown by the security forces. One month in the government continues to grapple with how to contain this outpouring of public outrage. Are you surprised by that?
 
MORTAZAVI: I'm not surprised. I mean, all of the courage and the bravery of the protesters, there's various demographics, but at the core of it, a lot of young women who are leading these protests are at the very front and center, even school girls, high schoolers who are risking everything, and joining the protests, either inside their schools or out on the street and also being met with brutal violence by the government. It's something we've seen in the past.
 
We saw in 2019. We saw in 2009. This crackdown by the security forces the disruption in internet access, and also the targeting of journalists and political analysts, a political activist is just part of the larger blueprint of the crackdown and the repression of the protesters.
 
HARRAK: Now, earlier, Iranian President Ibrahim Raisi accused President Biden of inciting chaos. Why is the government's default response to deny the grassroots nature of the movement in Iran and not acknowledged the despair that some young people feel about their lives.
 
MORTAZAVI: The government has just shown a very rigid and unresponsive reaction to these protests and also initially to the death of Mahsa Amini in police custody. Immediately the straight tried to put an alternative story on how there was no brutality she wasn't subjected to violence, had an underlying health condition as they claim and that she died of a heart attack which the family has constantly challenged and rejected that state narrative and just refusal to accept responsibility for the years of violence by the morality police and also the very depth of Mahsa Amini custody.
 
It's just been something of a playbook of this unresponsiveness and the grievances and the demands of the protesters that haven't been addressed every time a crackdown happens so people are sent back home with violence. 
 <br>[01:15:08]
 
But then they returned back to the street with added layers of grievances that haven't been addressed in the past.
 
HARRAK: Well, that's a really dangerous situation, because you've got the government that's not willing to back down and you've got the protesters that are determined. I mean, that's a massive impasse.
 
MORTAZAVI: It really is, the state is dealing with a serious crisis of legitimacy. Even if they can crack down and repress with violence, then legitimacy crisis is not going to go away, the demands are not going to go away. The bad situation of the economy, the political repression, many of these protesters don't see any other avenue for political change other than the street. That's why they're on the street. That's why they stay on the street essentially risked their lives and everything that they have.
 
So, it's a very volatile situation. I don't know if this is going to be a turning point, a wake-up call for the government and the authorities but we haven't really seen this in the past. And so far, it seems that they're resorting to violence and crackdown as a response.
 
HARRAK: A final thought from you, how would you define this very moment in Iran?
 
MORTAZAVI: Well, it's hard to speculate as far as what's going to happen next. But in itself, I think the moment is revolutionary, the bravery of these women, the young girls and their allies, and also the individual acts of civil disobedience. Just today an Iranian athlete Elnaz Rekabi entered an international competition on behalf of her country, Iran, and she refused to wear her job. I don't know what's going to happen to her. Can she return back to the country? Will she be expelled from the team? Will she be arrested and put in detention? We don't know. Others, journalists, activists and just individual women are defying and showing this these acts of civil disobedience and saying no to years and decades of discrimination, and state sanctioned violence against women.
 
And it starts with the dress code and family law, marriage, divorce, child custody and every personal and professional aspect. Women have been pushing the limits of the state and have been making slow but gradual progress. So in itself, I see this moment revolutionary, regardless of what comes after.
 
HARRAK: Negar Mortazavi, thank you so much for joining us.
 
MORTAZAVI: Thanks for having me.
 
HARRAK: A series of deadly shootings terrorized a community for more than a year, well now police believe they've caught the man responsible for taking the lives of six people in one California town. We'll have details in just a few moments.
 
Well, plus the tough journey to the US border is becoming even tougher for many Latin American migrants. Why more people are heading north even as dangers mount along the way.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[01:20:00]
 
HARRAK: The UN Refugee Agency is condemning what it calls cruel and degrading treatment of dozens of migrants, who were found naked at the border between Greece and Turkey. The agency says it's deeply distressed by the reports and images of 92 naked men, some of whom were injured.
 
Greek Police say the migrants were pushed in small boats from Turkey into Greece. It's not clear where they came from or how they ended up naked. Turkey and Greece are blaming each other for the situation.
 
Washington is preparing to roll out a new program for Venezuelan migrants seeking to come to the US. Under the program up to 24,000 Venezuelans will be admitted into the U.S. annually. There's been a massive increase of migrants from Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua, trying to cross the U.S. border with Mexico. And as Rafael Romo reports, their journey stretches for thousands of kilometers, with obstacles every step along the way.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) RAFAEL ROMO, CNN SENIOR LATIN AMERICAN AFFAIRS EDITOR: In Panama, they're the target of an air and land military operation. In Colombia, the country's Coast Guard is trying to intercept them in the ocean. And in Guatemala, national police in riot gear tried to stop them, but they lacked the numbers to do so.
 
From South America to the United States trying to stop yet another wave of migrants seems to be a losing battle for all the countries involved. It seems like more than ever, migrants are willing to face any risk and pay ever increasing amounts of money to reach the United States.
 
In Panama the number of migrants who continue crossing the perilous Darien jungle is increasing. By the end of September, over 134,000 migrants had crossed the Colombian border into Panama, already surpassing last year's total of 133,000.
 
This Marine Corps captain in Colombia says that smugglers used to charge $1,000 per person to cross from the Colombian San Andres and Providencia islands to Central American countries like Nicaragua, and the mount that he says has now increased to 4,000.
 
The influx of migrants is not only increasing, the nationalities of those seeking to reach the United States have also changed in the last few years.
 
This Guatemalan immigration official says they routinely detain migrants from countries as close as Cuba and Haiti and as far as Senegal, but these days most seem to be Venezuelan nationals.
 
This man in Caracas who chose not to reveal his identity because he works for the government of Venezuela, says he's desperate to leave his country. He says his government job pays about $5 a week, which forces him to hold two other jobs to make ends meet.
 
He says he's decided to leave. The question is how to get safely to the United States with no visa for any Central American country or his final destination.
 
Cousins Mario Mosqueda (ph) and Jefferson Losada (ph), also from Venezuela, have already made it as far as Guatemala. Venezuela is unlivable, the father of three says. The economic crisis has been very hard. And the truth is that I'm making this sacrifice to give my children a better life. As the United States approaches midterm elections, immigration has once again become --
 
JODEY ARRINGTON, U.S. HOUSE REPUBLICAN: This crisis as a direct result. Let's be very clear a direct result of President Biden's unilateral actions.
 
ROMO: -- a political hot potato with Republican governors from Texas and Florida bussing immigrants to places like New York and Washington DC.
 
RAUL REYES, ATTORNEY AND IMMIGRATION ANALYST: What we have here just is sort of a perfect storm New York shelter systems were overcrowded and overwhelmed before any of these migrants arrived. Meanwhile, at the border, we're seeing the same -- similar situation with a different population of migrants, where their resources are very strained.
 
ROMO: Back in Guatemala, cousins Mario Mosqueda (ph) and Jefferson Losada (ph) press. On in Venezuela, minimum wages not even enough to eat they say before leaving to join a group of other migrants with whom they share the same dream of reaching the United States regardless of the risks involved. Rafael Romo, CNN.

HARRAK: Britain's King Charles visits Aberdeen, Scotland in the coming hours to meet refugee families now making their homes in the city. The King will hear from people who fled Ukraine, Syria and Afghanistan because of war and other challenges and how the government's in Aberdeen is supporting them.
 
He will also attend a musical performance by primary school and university students. Well this will be the king's second trip to Scotland in a week.
 <br>[01:25:01]
 
Last Tuesday, he and the Queen Consort went there to thank people in the community for their kindness and support following Queen Elizabeth death.
 
In the U.S. state of California the search for an accused serial killer has ended with a suspect behind bars. Well now authorities are looking for a motive for the killings. 43-year-old Wesley Brownlee was arrested early Saturday morning. Police say Brownlee was quote out hunting for a new victim when they arrested him.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHIEF STANLEY MCFADDEN, STOCKTON POLICE DEPARTMENT: As officers made contact with him. He was wearing dark clothing and had a mask around his neck. It was also armed with a firearm when he was taken into custody. We are sure we stopped another killing.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK: While police suspect Brownlee of killing, six men and wounding a woman in a series of attacks starting back in April of 2021. And ending with the most recent incident last month. CNN's Camila Bernal has more on the story.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)
 
CAMILA BERNAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): There were two things that helped authorities make an arrest. They say it was thanks to the tips, the help from the community and just old fashioned police work. They say thanks to all of those tips, they were able to zero in on one possible suspect. Once they had that suspect, they started following him. They knew where he lived. They were looking for patterns and they were able to find those patterns. According to authorities, he was out either early in the morning or late at night. He would go to dark places and to parks.
 
And on Saturday at around two in the morning, they say that's exactly what he was doing. He would move around, look, stop and then move again. That's when authorities decided to arrest him. Now local authorities here just being thankful for all the tips and all the help from the community. Here's what the San Joaquin district attorney had to say.
 
TORI VERBER SALAZAR, DISTRICT ATTORNEY, SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY, CALIFORNIA: This crime was solved because we're Stocktonians, because you don't come to our house and bring this kind of reign of terror and not mobilize 350,000 people, 780,000 in this whole entire county mobilized, mobilized and captured this individual, who rave of terror is no longer.
 
BERNAL: And according to police when he was arrested, he was wearing all black, he had a mask around his neck and he had a gun. In terms of motive, we still do not know why this man allegedly did this. This is something that was asked of the police chief and he said he still did not know but we do know he has a criminal record and we are waiting to hear what charges he will be facing. Those will be announced on Tuesday when he has his first court appearance. Camila Bernal, CNN, Stockton, California.

HARRAK: Still ahead, 10 years in power and no end in sight. Xi Jinping's plan to make China great again, has sent up the authoritarian ruler to tighten his grip on power. And a new type of cold war may be making waves in the Arctic. Our Boris Sanchez will tell us why the melting ice cap could heat up international tensions. You're watching CNN Newsroom.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[01:30:45] 
 
HARRAK: Welcome back to our viewers all around the world. I'm Laila Harrak and this is CNN NEWSROOM. 
 
Right now, China's communist leaders and political elite have gathered for Day 2 of the 20th party Congress. Xi Jinping opened this event on Sunday like he has in the past laying out his nationalistic vision for the country's future.
 
But this year is unlike any other because after 10 years in power, Xi is poised to be selected for an unprecedented third term as party leader. 
 
And as CNN's Selina Wang reports, it's a watershed moment for modern China. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SELINA WANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT: China has kicked off its 20th Party Congress. This is the country's most important communist party meeting in decades. Xi Jinping is ripping up the precedent set by modern Chinese rulers before him. Instead of stepping down, he's set to be re-anointed for a 3rd term, setting himself up to be ruler for life. This meeting gives the world a rare glimpse into the black box of Chinese elite politics. 
 
Now more than ever, the world needs to pay attention. That's because increasingly, the fate of China and its relationship with the world hinges on the mind of one man. 
 
It's China's biggest show, and it's all about one man. Xi Jinping kicking off the opening of the Communist Party Congress where Xi is set to be re-crowned as Chinese supreme leader. 
 
His two-hour speech all about China's glowing achievements under his iron rule. The whole country tuning in on a Sunday morning. 
 
Students in class, Buddhist monks, office workers, frontline COVID workers, even a wedding stopped its celebration to watch and sing the national anthem. 
 
Little children glued to their iPads, laptops, and TVs to see Xi. And it's required viewing. Their parents, taking photos to prove to teachers that homework is in progress. 
 
The party congress is the ruling Communists' twice in a decade meeting that sets up policy goals and transfers leadership. But this time, the question isn't who will lead to China, but how he will. 
 
On Taiwan, Xi said China will aim for peaceful unification, but -- 
 
XI JINPING, CHINESE PRESIDENT (through translator): We will never promise to renounce the use of force. 
 
WANG: -- his message met with the loudest and longest applause. Under Xi, China has ramped up its military intimidation of the self-ruled democratic island that Beijing sees as a breakaway province. Tensions with the U.S. are only expected to get worse. 
 
Xi, getting closer to autocrats that share his vision for a new world order, one no longer dominated by America. 
 
While he didn't specifically mentioned the U.S., Xi said -- 
 
XI: China unswervingly oppose any unilateralism, protectionism, hegemony and bullying activities. 
 
WANG: At home, China's draconian zero-COVID policies have wreaked havoc over the economy and peoples' lives. Fights with COVID enforcers, protests for food and supplies, entire cities are still being locked down over a handful of COVID cases. Yet Xi made it clear, zero COVID isn't going anywhere. He defended the
 
 policy as putting lives first. But while it was all order and applause inside the great hall of the people in Beijing, outside just days before, an extremely rare show of opposition. A banner unfurled in the capital that read, "Remove dictator and national traitor Xi Jinping". 
 
A brief glimpse into anger brewing under the surface because all traces of opposition are silenced and erased in Xi's China. 
 
Instead, his vision -- a nation of 1.4 billion people living beautifully and blissfully under Xi Jinping's every word.
 <br>[01:34:54]
 
WANG: Xi Jinping did not mention another country by name in his speech, but he did say China is navigating a grim and complex international situation. Now, it's possible he's referring to the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. 
 
So far, China has refused to condemn Russia's invasion as Xi and Russia have grown closer. Xi Jinping's goal here is to make China great again, to restore what Xi sees as China's rightful place in the world. 
 
This is a leader who sees the China model as an alternative one for the world. So in his third term, U.S.-China tensions are likely to only get worse. 
 
Selina Wang, CNN -- Hong Kong. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HARRAK: I'm now joined by Steven Jiang, CNN's Beijing bureau chief and senior international correspondent, Will Ripley in Taipei, Taiwan.
 
Steven, Mr. Xi is sticking with his unwavering commitment to zero COVID policy. How has that gone down with the people in China? 
 
STEVEN JIANG, CNN BEIJING BUREAU CHIEF: Well, Laila, not only on this issue, but for the entire speech, there is only one type of public reaction allowed in this country. That is with resounding support and enthusiasm. And that's exactly what we have seen in state media, but also on strictly controlled social media platforms. 
 
Now, given how opaque this system here is covering politics is always like reading tea leaves. For example, people noticed how Xi Jinping paused several times during the speech to clear his throat, sipping water. 
 
That got noticed, drawing attention to the issue of his stamina, which, of course, is important given the extraordinary amount of power concentrated in his hands, and the growing list of major decisions he has to make, making his job increasingly physically demanding. 
 
And people also noticed one of the most used terms in his speech was struggle or fight. He talked about fighting COVID, fighting corruption, fighting separatists in Hong Kong and Taiwan and without naming the U.S. fighting unilateralism and hegemony. 
 
Really indicating he's unlikely to back down from any of his hardline policies and positions, including on the increasingly unpopular zero COVID policy. 
 
And another phrase he used in the speech was how China has entered a phase of strategic opportunities and risks, with growing uncertainty. Now, that's slightly different from what was said in previous party congresses. 
 
So Really making people wonder if the leadership's assessment of these external threat environment has changed. Do they now see a growing possibility of conflict or even war that could make them shift the party's top priority to national security and even national security and even possibly, reallocating resources to move the country on to a long term war footing, Laila. 
 
HARRAK: Will Ripley in Taipei. Speaking of not backing down, no new language used by Mr. Xi on the issue of Taiwan. How has that part of his address been received in Taipei, where you are? 
 
WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT; Look as, you know, the Taiwanese leadership always does, they issue rebuttals when Xi Jinping says these things about the self-governing democracy that he wants to reunify with in his generation, which is another way of saying, you know, while he's in power. 
 
But you know, he says he prioritizes peaceful reunification, but if you give Taiwanese people a choice, look at the China model and look at life here in Taiwan. 
 
Neither is perfect, of course. But certainly here, the border have opened whereas in China, they're still closed. Quarantine got done away with here, like much of the world. Still happening in China. 
 
Most people here are vaccinated and boosted. They have a lack of access to effective vaccines for a lot of people in China. That's one of the reasons why a lot of analysts think they might be clinging to zero COVID, because they refuse to purchase more effective foreign made vaccines. They refuse to admit that the leader, Xi Jinping, made any more mistakes, or the communist rulers made any mistakes in their handling of the pandemic. 
 
And in fact, they've used the pandemic in China to step up surveillance and turn the mainland into a de facto police state, whereas here you have one of the most freewheeling Internet, you know, media. I mean the contrasts just go on and on and on. The way the minorities both ethnic and sexual minorities are embraced here, and silenced and assimilated in China. 
 
So it's hard to see, Laila, how people here would willingly choose the peaceful reunification side, which means they have to arm themselves. And Taiwan continues to increase its defense budget. 
 
Of course, it's impossible to compete in terms of the size and the dollars that's spent. You know, in terms of the two militaries, I believe China's defense budget is 15 to 17 times bigger than Taiwan depending on the latest numbers that you're looking at. 
 
However Taiwan is and in fact, as we said a meeting a couple hours ago, with those who are seeking to kind of change the Taiwan military into a more asymmetrically capable defensive unit, basically playing to the strengths of being an island that is relatively easy to defend, as long as you can keep your invaders, you know, off the island itself. 
 <br>[01:39:54]
 
RIPLEY: And so it was interesting going over that military strategy that they're always tinkering and working on here. They hold live fire drills. I attended those a few weeks ago. 
 
You know, this is an island that doesn't want war, but they say they will stand up and defend and protect the democratic system that so many people here, over the course of 70 years, fought for, served prison time for and in many cases, died for. And some have said they would die for it today, if it came under threat. 
 
So nobody hopes it gets to that point, but given the Chinese military drills and all the escalating tensions, it's certainly something that is on people's minds, not dominating their minds though, because frankly, they're out living life. 
 
Unlike many in China, who are still locked down right now, Laila. 
 
HARRAK: Will Ripley, Steven Jiang -- thank you both.
 
Still to come, Typhoon Nesat moves on from the Philippines, but this powerful storm is only expected to get stronger as it churns in the South China Sea. We'll look at which areas could be impacted next.
 
And later, the man who fell to earth. CNN sits down with the skydiver who made history after jumping out of a space capsule in a record breaking free fall.

HARRAK: Nigeria is reeling from some of the worst flooding it's seen in a decade. The toll is just staggering. More than 600 people have died. About 200,000 homes are either damaged or destroyed and 1.3 million people are displaced. 
 
Authorities say this year's rainy season has been heavier than usual. But the federal government also says many state governments were ill prepared. They're being urged to move people to higher ground if needed, and to have more tents relief supplies ready. 
 
We're keeping a close eye on Typhoon Nesat which is moving on from the Philippines in the South China Sea. Right now, top sustained winds are around 140 kilometers an hour, about as strong as a category one hurricane. It could strengthen further in the next 24 hours before approaching southern China and Vietnam later this week.
 
All right. Let's take you to meteorologist Pedram Javaheri for more on this. What are you seeing.
 
PEDRAM JAVAHERI, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Yes Laila, as you noted there. This storm has what it takes to strengthen here in the coming 24 hours, and we're watching it carefully here, because as you'll notice, very much organized in the last few hours as far as the rotation is concerned with the system. 
 
It is poised to move over warmer waters. Surface temperatures here close to 29 degrees Celsius, which is about a degree above that threshold you want to see with a storm that maintains or strengthens in intensity. 
 <br>[01:44:48]
 
JAVAHERI: And you'll notice it produced quite a bit of rainfall across portions of northern Philippines, moved right across the Babuyan Islands, the archipelago of about 24 islands, north of Luzon, here home to about 20,000 people, skirted right around the island in the past 24 hours, and now moving into the open waters of the South China Sea, where again, the initial forecast (INAUDIBLE) does have it in an area conducive for further strengthening. 
 
So if you were to ask me, when is this system going to be strongest? I would say this time tomorrow, but fortunately, that is over open waters. 
 
Notice what happens once you get into say Tuesday into Wednesday. Wednesday into Thursday and beyond that into Friday. Quite a bit of dry air expected to move into the storm system. And also areas of the island of Hainan (ph) right here across the southern southwestern areas, the topography this the landscape takes the mountainous up to 1,800 meters high. That'll help hinder the system as well. 
 
But we do expect to see this system weaken once again, it's a mid week. That could bring in initial impacts there across portions of southern Hainan but notice the cone of the forecast could take it as far south as Deneng (ph) population very high, of course. Could take this far north just Hanoi, Population even higher. 
 
So quite a ways left before we get there, but we know the population density, especially on the northern trajectory, could be problematic. 
 
We'll follow this as it progresses, but right now, it's should spend the next couple of days over open water, Laila. 
 
HARRAK: Pedram Javaheri. Thank you so much. 
 
A new type of cold war may be on the horizon. As we hear from CNN's Boris Sanchez, this time the issue is the melting arctic and which nations will control what could become the world's newest ocean. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SEN. ANGUS KING (D-ME): This new ocean is appearing on our maps and it has all kinds of different implications. And we've been slow to pick up on it, frankly. BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Maine Senator Angus King, says
 
 climate change is unlocking a new crossroads, and potential center of conflict. The arctic, where irreversible trends are leading to a global rush. With world powers seeking untapped energy supplies -- oil and natural gas, minerals, fishing, recreation, and highly-coveted shipping routes. 
 
KING: And if you think about the Mediterranean Sea, there's a thousand years of war to determine the relationships of those countries surrounding the Mediterranean Sea. The question is, can we open the arctic and avoid the conflict? 
 
SANCHEZ: By some estimates, 75 percent of arctic ice has disappeared in the last quarter century. 
 
In fact, some scientists believe we could see summers without any ice blocking the North Pole within the next dozen years. All that extra space means more shipping lanes, and faster shipping times.
 
We could see some shipping routes reduced by up to 15 days. That's a huge economic advantage. 
 
Keep in mind though Russia owns more than half of the coastline in the Arctic. And according to this graphic by the American Security Project, they've been steadily building it up militarily for years, with dozens of new bases and old retrofitted Soviet ones as well. 
 
KING: If there was a conflict with Russia, it's one of the ways that Russia would come at us. I believe, unfortunately, we need to have some response to that. Not in a conflict situation, but just in a defensive situation. 
 
SANCHEZ: CNN got a firsthand look at Russia's northernmost outpost in 2021. And though the Kremlin insisted its intentions for the region were peaceful at the time, that was before the invasion of Ukraine. 
 
There's been speculation of Vladimir Putin might resort to a nuclear weapon to reassert dominance. 
 
KING: And one of the possibilities is exploding it over the Arctic Ocean as a demonstration. 
 
ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: The arctic is crucial to America's foreign policy and national security.
 
SANCHEZ: While King applauds the Biden administration's new national strategy for the region, the co-chair of the Arctic Caucus says more will need to be done. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Russia has, like, 40 icebreakers? We have one. 
 
SANCHEZ: As other nations, not even geographically close to the Arctic, like China and India, lay out their ambitions. Senator King wants a stronger naval presence there, more robust military infrastructure, and a commitment to international treaties. Like the U.N. law of the sea. Steps he believe that could deter a possible war. KING: I don't know. I think the jury is out on that. But it's at least
 
 possible. And I think it would be positive for America and the whole world. 
 
SANCHEZ: Boris Sanchez, CNN -- Washington.

HARRAK: It's been 10 years since Austrian daredevil Felix Baumgartner jumped from the edge of space with a parachute. 
 
Coming up, we'll hear in his own words as he looks back on that death defying experience. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
FELIX BAUMGARTNER: I say what I have to say. Sometimes, you have to go up to understand how small you are. I'm going to say, I'm coming home now. 
 <br>[01:49:45]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HARRAK: It's been 10 years since daredevil Felix Baumgartner did the unthinkable, jumping from a capsule on the edge of space for an incredible freefall and parachuting back to the earth.
 
Part of the Red Bull stratus mission, he fell of 39 kilometers and broke the sound barrier, becoming the first skydiver to go supersonic. CNN world sports Patrick Snell spoke with Baumgartner about the historic jump 10 years on. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BAUMGARTNER: On the 14th of October, 2012, I was all the way up in a capsule, you know, 135,000 feet above the ground, not knowing where this journey was going to go.
 
But it was such a breathtaking moment. I opened that capsule door and stepped outside, you know, And then I looked around when I could see (INAUDIBLE) and also saw the curvature of the earth, you know, knowing, you know, I have to do these people eat into the unknown because nobody ever did a skydive at supersonic speed, that was the first one. And it brings back a lot of good memories. 
 
PATRICK SNELL, CNN WORLD SPORTS: Let's get to that special moment. That historic moment. We see that jaw-dropping image, Felix, we see when the door slides open, that amazing view. 
 
You say at one point, I think you said you wish you could've had more time up there before you jumped from the (INAUDIBLE). I mean to those of us who can only ever dream of being in that place where you were, can you even begin to describe what it's like? 
 
BAUMGARTNER: First of all, believe it or not, I was super happy that the door opened. Because it could also be that the door is freezing. So I cannot open the door. 
 
And once I was outside, I was really trying to inhale that moment. Because we've been working so hard. 
 
Just think about it. When I started skydiving at the age of 16, this is where my journey already started. Without knowing where it goes, you know. But 35 years later, I'm standing there, top of the world, outside of a capsule, in the stratosphere.
 
And I said what I had to say, sometimes I have to go up to understand how small you are. I'm going to say I'm coming home now. 
 
Then I was on my way. I accelerated to 890 miles an hour in just a little bit more than 50 seconds. It was a breathtaking moment. 
 
SNELL: It wasn't all smooth, was it though, because despite breaking the sound barrier, you're there and spinning out of control. At that point, how alarming was it all, and how helpless did you feel? 
 
BAUMGARTNER: That was a very alarming moment because there's no protocol. There's nothing that they teach you, even if you have perfect preparation for all those. I had to find out on myself.
 
How did I do this? by trial and error, you know. Just moving my arms and legs around, trying to figure out what will stop the spin. But you have to keep in mind, at that altitude, it's almost a vacuum. So there's no air. It's like sailing without wind. That means your skills don't work.
 
And around 9000 feet, there's a thicker layer of air that helps you a lot. I was able to use the thicker layer of air to control myself. Once I turned around, I was stable as a rock. 
 <br>[01:54:48]
 
BAUMGARTNER: I was stable as a rock. From that moment on, it was actually the first moment when I started to enjoy my sky dive. And once I opened my parachute, and opened my visor, this was the first moment after seven hours where I was breathing outside air. 
 
Do I was reconnected to the outside world, and that was a very happy moment. 
 
SNELL: And then, we see you make this perfect, perfect landing. And we know that was so important to you. But of course, the realization at that moment that your life changed forever as well at that point, right. 
 
BAUMGARTNER: As a (INAUDIBLE), you never worry about your landing, you trust the land, you know. But know way that the whole world was watching, you want to have the perfect landing you know. That's why I was so worried about my landing. But I nailed it. I was happy when I landed it.
 
The only thing that I didn't know when I landed is, did I break the speed of sound? Because you know, once you freefall, you know your fast, but you have absolutely no indication of how fast you actually are. 
 
So when I landed, the verification guy showed up and took my chest peg off, this big wire box that I was wearing half on my chest. And inside, there was the record verification device. He took it, he disappeared in a tent, he popped in the computer, took about 10 minutes.
 
I was waiting outside, and after 10 minutes, he came out, and said, hey, thumbs up, you are even faster than the speed of sound. And at that moment, I was really happy and satisfied. Because to me, breaking the speed of sound as the first human in history, that was definitely something.

HARRAK: Extraordinary. 
 
Now, in the English Premier League, Liverpool handed defending city champs, Man City, their first loss of the season, and earning a much- needed win. 
 
Man City was the only unbeaten team left in the league when they met Liverpool on Sunday. The match was tied at nil for most of the game until Liverpool, (INAUDIBLE), scored in the 76 minutes and the red sound off, Man City to win one meal.
 
Now Liverpool had a dismal start to the season, but now fans are hoping that this victory was as a turning point. 
 
Tina Turner, the iconic singer known as the queen of rock and roll, has now been immortalized with a barbie doll in her honor. The doll was inspired by her 1984 Grammy winning hit, "What's Love Got To Do With It?" And depicts Turner's outfit from the song's music video.
 
It's available on Mattel's Web site and is part of a collection honoring trailblazing women.
 
Thank you so much for spending this part of your day with me. I'm Laila Harrak, do stay with us. My colleague, Rosemary Church, will be back in just a moment.
