ZAIN ASHER, CNN ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. I'm Zain Asher in New York and this is ONE WORLD. Within the hour, Donald Trump will leave his New Jersey 
 
 golf club bound for Washington, D.C. That's where he's expected to plead not guilty to four federal charges stemming from efforts to overturn the 
 
 2020 election. His arraignment will take place in the same courthouse where hundreds of January 6 rioters were also tried as well. Mr. Trump's 
 
 appearance in about four hours' time is expected to be short. 
 
The process is expected to be similar to court appearances he made in his two other criminal cases. This is the first one, however, involving his 
 
 refusal to accept the outcome of the 2020 election. His former Attorney General, Bill Barr, says Mr. Trump knew that he had lost.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
WILLIAM BARR, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL:  Whether it's criminal or not, someone who engaged in that kind of bullying about a process that is 
 
 fundamental to our system and to our self-government shouldn't be anywhere near the Oval Office.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ASHER:  We're covering this story from all angles for you. Brian Todd is looking at security around the courthouse. But firstly, I begin with 
 
 Jessica Schneider in Washington. Jessica, this is monumental. Here you have a former U.S. President indicted for the third time, expected to appear in 
 
 court today. How do we expect the day to unfold? 
 
JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, we're expecting Trump to leave New Jersey shortly. He'll travel here to Washington, DC, and then 
 
 he'll be arraigned on those criminal charges at 4 PM in the federal courthouse here in DC. Like you said, Zain, this marks his third criminal 
 
 arrest in just about four months. This time, he'll be inside a courthouse that overlooks the U.S. Capitol, of course, the very place where a mob of 
 
 his supporters stormed into to try to stop the certification of the 2020 election. 
 
Now, the appearance this afternoon, it will likely be brief. It will be before a magistrate judge, and it will be very procedural. And then after 
 
 that, this case will move to the judge who has been randomly assigned to this case. The judge is Judge Tanya Chutkan. She actually has ruled against 
 
 Trump in the past. Most recently in 2021, when she actually allowed 700 pages of his White House records to be turned over to the January 6th 
 
 Committee who were investigating. 
 
Notably, what we've seen already happening at the federal courthouse today, sentencings of convicted Capitol rioters. The sentencing have been 
 
 happening throughout the past few months. They've also been happening this morning. One of the judges told one of the defendants that Trump's 
 
 appearance later today would have no bearing on the sentencing or the court proceeding.
 
So, what we're expecting in the coming hours, Trump will leave his New Jersey golf club, he'll fly via his private jet here to Washington, and 
 
 then head just minutes away to the courthouse here in Washington, D.C. So, our Kristen Holmes is following all of his movements. She says that Trump 
 
 will be traveling with his two lawyers, who will handle this case in court, plus he'll be traveling with an array of political advisors. 
 
So, Zain, we do expect that Trump's appearance in court will be fairly routine. He'll be placed under arrest. He'll be booked. He'll get his 
 
 fingerprints, no mug shot though. And then after that short court appearance, Trump does plan to head back to Bedminster on his plane. And we 
 
 might even hear some remarks from him. We hear that he may be planning to give remarks on the tarmac at the airport here in D.C. before he heads back 
 
 to New Jersey. So, it will be a whirlwind of activity for just probably a short court appearance. Zain.
 
ASHER:  All right, Jessica. Stand by. Brian, let me bring you in. So, how do the crowds outside the courthouse compared to Donald Trump's previous 
 
 court appearances and what sort of security are we seeing as well?
 
BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Zain, the crowds that we're seeing out there now are really not too substantial. About a couple of dozen 
 
 protesters, both pro-Trump and anti-Trump protesters, seen outside the courtroom -- the courthouse this morning. You know, again, very peaceful 
 
 protests. The strategy for law enforcement regarding the protesters is, of course, keep them separated, keep the pro-Trump protesters, his supporters, 
 
 separate from the anti-Trump protesters. They've got plans in place to do that so that things don't get out of hand outside the courthouse.
 
But when you talk about the overall security profile here, it is a series of layers. We were told that U.S. Marshals from the Special Operations Unit 
 
 of that agency were patrolling inside the building earlier today. Men with tactical gear and rifles arrived this morning. 
 <br>[12:05:00]
 
The marshals also used their legendary bomb-sniffing dog. His name is Legend, actually, and he's been on patrol inside the building as well. And 
 
 secret service agents were on patrol inside the building in addition to that. And again, when we talk about layers, physically outside, last night 
 
 they put up these kind of bike rack-sized barriers all around the courthouse, again, so that protesters and other people who may want to get 
 
 close will be prevented from doing that. They really have turned this courthouse into a fortress, at least for the next few hours until Former 
 
 President Trump makes his court appearance at 4 PM Eastern and then leaves. 
 
Other, you know, protective measures that were told are going to be taken. I spoke with a Former Secret Service special agent in charge, Matt Doherty, 
 
 about the procedure for the former president himself when he arrives. And without getting into too much detail here, Doherty told us that it's very 
 
 likely that the former president will be taken in, in a separate entrance that's really not too visible to the public, not accessible to the public. 
 
 It's not going to be kind of a sidewalk entrance where you'll be able to see him or we may not see him at all, actually, when he goes in. 
 
So, other than that, we don't want to give too much detail as to where the former president will be taken into today and then taken out as he makes 
 
 his brief court appearance and then leaves. But again, multiple, multiple layers of security. And one other thing that they're doing is they've 
 
 signed a Memorandum of Understanding between all the law enforcement agencies involved in this, and that includes the D.C. Metropolitan Police, 
 
 the Secret Service, the U.S. Capitol Police, the Park Police. 
 
This Memorandum of Understanding allows each of these agencies to kind of overlap and go into the other's jurisdiction if there is a call for backup. 
 
 And that was kind of a lesson learned also from January 6th, where the U.S. Capitol police needed backup in a hurry and they got it from the D.C. 
 
 Metropolitan Police. That kind of layer of security is also in place. They don't anticipate necessarily needing that. Again, just a couple dozen 
 
 protesters out there so far. Zain.
 
ASHER:  Brian, and do stand by. Jessica, let me bring you back in and sort of, if you could zoom out for our audience and sort of look at the big 
 
 picture. A lot of people are talking about what Donald Trump's lawyer is -- what their defense strategy will be in all of this. Some people are saying, 
 
 look, this defense may hinge on freedom of speech. Others are saying, look, it hinges on whether or not Donald Trump actually knew and actually 
 
 believed that the election was stolen, regardless of what he was actually saying. I mean, how do you prove that beyond reasonable doubt here?
 
SCHNEIDER:  Well, you're right about Donald Trump's lawyers hinging on that First Amendment Freedom of Speech defense. That is something that they have 
 
 already from right out of the gate, right after this indictment was handed up, his lawyers were on TV on multiple outlets talking about this was 
 
 Donald Trump saying that there was election fraud and pushing people to investigate it. And he saw affidavit saying the same thing. So, they're 
 
 going to rely on that defense.
 
Now, when it comes to just the overall view of this entire case, you know, Jack Smith actually talked about in the indictment that, yes, Americans, 
 
 Donald Trump included, they have this right to free speech. However, when it crosses into pushing people to engage in criminal conduct, that is where 
 
 it crosses the line. That's when it becomes not speech, but conduct. 
 
So, that will be what the prosecutors will be pressing on. And you talked about -- did Donald Trump, how will they prove that these election fraud 
 
 claims were baseless? Well, he was told repeatedly. And there was also something in the indictment that said that at one point, Sidney Powell, one 
 
 of Donald Trump's lawyers, whose -- CNN has identified as an unnamed co- conspirator listed in the indictment, Donald Trump even called her theories of election fraud, quote, crazy. 
 
So, there seems to be a lot of evidence that the special counsel has gathered here that Donald Trump knew potentially that he lost the election 
 
 and moreover, knew that a lot of these election fraud claims were crazy, baseless. He was told so repeatedly by his Justice Department officials, 
 
 including the former attorney general you just saw there on our air last night talking to our Kaitlan Collins, Bill Barr. He told the president 
 
 repeatedly that all of these claims of widespread election fraud were baseless. 
 
So, you know, the special counsel has been investigating this for months and Jack Smith, the Special Counsel, has said that the investigation is 
 
 ongoing. So, whether or not they have an airtight case, they at least have a lot of evidence here that they've laid out in the indictment and likely 
 
 they've kept out a lot of evidence, as well, that they would present in the coming court dates or even the trial itself, Zain. 
 
ASHER:  There are so many fascinating strands to this, especially when it comes to co-conspirators. We sort of have an idea about who five of them 
 
 may be, but the sixth one is still a mystery. We'll see if there are more charges here. Jack Smith did say that this is an ongoing investigation. 
 
 Jessica Schneider, Brian Todd, live for us there. Thank you so much. And CNN's Special Coverage of the arraignment of Former President Donald Trump 
 
 begins next hour. Do stay with CNN for that. 
 <br>[12:10:00]
 
All right, the streets of Niger's capital were full of cheering crowds on Thursday. They came out to support the militant coup that deposed the 
 
 country's democratically elected president last week. Protesters also slammed sanctions imposed by West African nations to put pressure on coup 
 
 leaders. This was also Niger's Independence Day as well, marking the end of French colonial rule in 1960. 
 
Security concerns remain high in the country. France says it has wrapped up evacuating more than a thousand people from Niger, while the U.S. now says 
 
 it will now evacuate non-emergency personnel from its embassy there. Our David McKenzie has been tracking this story from Johannesburg. So, August 
 
 3rd is actually Niger's Independence Day. Obviously, they're a former French colony today, represents the first time they sort of severed those 
 
 ties from France. And a lot of people are seeing this coup as a way to sever those ties even further. David, walk us through it.
 
DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  I think that might be the case certainly and you saw from our reporters on the ground there a 
 
 lot of anti-French sentiment from those supporters who came in, hundreds perhaps thousands to support the coup leaders who took over last week. You 
 
 know, it's important to note what we don't know. 
 
It's not clear whether the pictures you're seeing here represent a widespread support of the coup nationwide and there is some indication that 
 
 that isn't the case. You've also had growing pressure particularly from regional bloc ECOWAS, who is being far more aggressive in its push to 
 
 return Niger to some kind of democratic rule, to return President Bazoum into power. The Senegalese government is saying that it is willing to send 
 
 troops should that be the eventual outcome of that pressure and the foreign minister saying enough is enough. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
AISSATA TALL SALL, FOREIGN AFFAIRS MINISTER OF SENEGAL (through translator):  Why didn't we do it for Mali? Why didn't we do it for Guinea? 
 
 Why didn't we do it for Burkina? And why are we doing it for Niger? To give one answer, I say it's one coup, too many.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MCKENZIE:  She's of course referring, Zain, to those countries which have also had military coups in recent times. ECOWAS is tightening the screws 
 
 also financially and through trade, sanctioning individuals. For their part, the coup leaders are digging in. At least one of the leaders went to 
 
 Mali to meet with the military leadership there, potentially opening the door to Russian involvement should they consolidate their power in Niger. 
 
There are a lot of nervous capitals around the world. I must say, outside, if you look at the more international scope of this, the U.S. government 
 
 has been in contact with President Bazuma, former adviser to the president, saying that he is still able to take calls, that he is, quote, confident 
 
 and his morale is high. He is under a house arrest with his son and his wife, according to that adviser. 
 
So, you -- in this kind of very fragile period where the pressure is building and everyone is waiting to see whether the coup leaders will 
 
 buckle, diplomats feel that there is a window still to try and negotiate it into this. But that window could be closing fast. 
 
ASHER:  Right, because it's been more than a week since this coup happened, and as you mentioned, you know, time is of the essence if it is going to be 
 
 reversed. Dave McKenzie, live for us there, thank you so much.
 
ASHER:  Ukraine and Russia both say they were targeted by drone attacks overnight. Russia says it shot down seven drones southwest of Moscow. There 
 
 are no reports of casualties or damage to infrastructure. Meantime, Ukraine's air force says it destroyed at least 20 drones targeting Kyiv. 
 
 Here you see explosions over the city as air defenses did their work. But on Wednesday, Ukraine says some Russian drones did hit their marks in the 
 
 southern city of Odessa, damaging a critical port facility as well as a grain elevator. Ukraine's president says these latest strikes show Russia's 
 
 war isn't just an attack on his country and its freedoms.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT:  Moscow is waging a battle for a global catastrophe. These insane people want the world's food market to 
 
 collapse. They need price crises. They need disruptions in supply. Someone there thinks they can profit from this. Someone in Moscow hopes to gain 
 
 something for themselves.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ASHER:  Meantime, Ukraine says more than 10,000 civilians have been killed since the Russian invasion in February of last year, but one official 
 
 believes many more deaths will be confirmed once occupied areas are liberated. 
 <br>[12:15:00]
 
North Korea has reached out following requests for information about the U.S. Army Private Travis King. That's according to the U.N. command which 
 
 says it will not go into additional detail. The U.S. State Department says the call was not substantive and it is not seen as progress in any way. You 
 
 may recall that King was immediately taken into custody when he ran across the border from South Korea into North Korea during a tour of the 
 
 demilitarized zone. He was facing disciplinary action and was scheduled to return to the U.S. the day before this incident. 
 
Meantime, King's family says they know just as much as any of us regarding his exact whereabouts. In an exclusive interview, King's uncle tells CNN 
 
 he's been calling U.S. House members and senators but so far has received no answers.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MYRON GATES, TRAVIS KING'S UNCLE:  Sitting here today, I don't know where he is. The only thing I know is there's a picture of him on the news from 
 
 the backside, and they're saying that Travis King ran across the border. That's the only thing I know. I know nothing else. 
 
LAURA COATES, CNN ANCHOR:  Do you have any reason to believe that Travis would have intentionally run over the border into North Korea to defect in 
 
 that way? 
 
JAQUEDA GATES, TRAVIS KING'S SISTER:  No.
 
MYRON GATES:  No, he had no reason to do that at all. 
 
JAQUEDA GATES:  Look, I love you. I just want you to be home, you know, I really do want you to be home. The same way you left, I want you to come 
 
 back if not even healthier. But all these allegations and stuff, I don't believe them.
 
COATES:  Myron --
 
JAQUEDA GATES:  I'm your big sister, so, I always -- I always knew -- I just can't believe it. 
 
MYRON GATES:  I would say, nephew, we love you. You see, we stand here, we strong. And we're going to continue to fight for you. And we ain't going to 
 
 stop until you come home. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ASHER:  And King's family members say they're working with a non-profit organization founded by negotiator Bill Richardson to help bring Travis 
 
 home.
 
All right, still to come, stories from the victims. A new report about Sudan's civil war accuses both sides of terrible war crimes. And despite a 
 
 lack of evidence and a new Trump indictment, most Republicans still don't think that Joe Biden is actually the legitimate President of the United 
 
 States. The result of the latest poll coming up. Plus, three African teams have now qualified for the knockout stage at the Women's World Cup. A look 
 
 at this historic moment for sport at this hour.

 <br>[12:20:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ASHER:  In what is becoming an increasingly familiar story, we are getting reports of yet another massacre in Sudan. Human rights groups say that at 
 
 least 200 people were killed in West Darfur during attacks on two towns by the paramilitary rapid support forces and its allies. Thousands of people 
 
 were forced to flee to neighboring Chad. Violence has escalated in West Darfur after the Sudanese armed forces and the rapid support forces began 
 
 fighting in April.
 
Some of the people who have spoken to Amnesty International and their eyewitness accounts have been published in a report detailing terrible war 
 
 crimes titled, "Death Came to Our Home". The report accuses both sides of deliberately targeting civilians during the fighting. It details 
 
 allegations of rape, of sexual slavery, especially by the RSF and says that some of the victims were girls who were as young as 12 and it says 
 
 hospitals and other humanitarian facilities have been destroyed, depriving civilians of food and medicine. 
 
Joining us to help sort through all of this is William Carter. He's the Sudan Country Director for the Norwegian Refugee Council. William, this 
 
 report is troubling, to say the least. I mean, obviously, there has been violence across Sudan, but it's particularly terrifying in Khartoum and in 
 
 West Darfur, as well. 
 
I understand that the Norwegian Refugee Council has actually suspended operations in those two areas and that means, obviously, that ordinary 
 
 Sudanese people who work for the Norwegian Refugee Council have had to be laid off, which, you know, is obviously difficult, but it's understandable 
 
 why your organization had to do that. Just explain to us how you are still working to get help to those who need it the most.
 
WILLIAM CARTER, COUNTRY DIRECTOR, SUDAN, NORWEGIAN REFUGEE COUNCIL:  Thanks. Sudan's is stating situation around Sudan, a hugely complex and 
 
 serious humanitarian emergency. I've just come back after 10 weeks of working with some of our other offices around the country that are helping 
 
 to respond to people who are fleeing, particularly from Khartoum to other parts of the country. So, we still have five offices and are trying to 
 
 scale up our humanitarian assistance there, along with other humanitarian organizations and U.N. agencies.
 
So, it's tough to say that Darfur and Khartoum is an easy location to work in right now. Really, there's security challenges, but really, we're faced 
 
 with a lot of bureaucratic impediments in getting supplies and staff back in, that would help resume in Khartoum and Darfur. The report, you know, 
 
 consolidates some chilling -- chilling events which are still ongoing. Khartoum has been relentlessly airstriked. 
 
There is ethnically motivated and systematic killings in the scorched earth campaign in different areas and Amnesty has done a great job at 
 
 consolidating some of those testimonies and there's other satellite imagery and other things coming to the fore. We leave the good work of human rights 
 
 organizations to bring that to light. Imperative that we scale up the humanitarian response, but it is tough and underfunded to do so at the 
 
 moment. 
 
ASHER:  And when you think about the sort of fallout for neighboring countries, I mean, I think there is so much, economic pressure right now 
 
 for places like Chad. You know, obviously Chad borders Darfur and Chad has seen so many thousands of refugees pour into their country. What sort of 
 
 assistance does the international community need to provide for N'Djamena and for actually the neighboring Chadian towns to ensure that they have 
 
 what they need through this crisis, too?
 
CARTER:  This is quickly becoming one of the largest displacement crises in the world. Already last year, there were over 3.5 million internally 
 
 displaced people and that was before this crisis. In the last 100 days or so, another three million people have been internally displaced and almost 
 
 a million people seeking refuge in other countries, particularly Chad, particularly Egypt and South Sudan and some to Ethiopia and elsewhere. It's 
 
 placed incredible strain on already fragile, local economies and communities that are generously hosting them. And we're so grateful for 
 
 countries to keep their borders open so that people can seek safety. 
 
Inside, in Darfur, across the other side of the border from Chad, it's a terrible situation. There are clearly abuses which Amnesty and other human 
 
 rights organizations have documented. 
 <br>[12:25:00]
 
We've also got food insecurity projections, where it's, you know, people will be very vulnerable. The whole market system is beginning to collapse. 
 
 And local food, productivities and supply chains are broken. You know, we had teams inside West Darfur for the last couple of years. There's been 
 
 multiple, to be honest, atrocities happening since the peacekeeping mission, finished there, two, three years ago. 
 
So, we had repetitive emergency responses there. After this crisis, you know, really escalated three months ago, fortunately one of our volunteers 
 
 had been killed, one of our staff there has been killed, and many of our staff sought refuge also in Chad. We've got teams in Chad. We're working 
 
 very hard to get back into Genana and to reestablish operations as soon as possible. But yeah, it's places incredible strain and not to mention the 
 
 trauma of and vulnerability of people who have sought refuge across the border. 
 
ASHER:  Yeah, and as you point out, it's you know the local population and civilians have been targeted, but it's also a difficult environment for 
 
 humanitarian aid workers. As you point out, some of your aid workers have been killed during all of this. William Carter, Sudan Country Director for 
 
 the Norwegian Refugee Council, we have to leave it there, but thank you so much. We appreciate you coming on the program. 
 
All right, still to come, the latest Donald Trump indictment reveals lots of details about the January 6th insurrection and the moments that led up 
 
 to the riot. We'll share with you after the break.

ASHER:  Hello and welcome back to ONE WORLD. Let's catch up on the headlines. Kenya has halted the Worldcoin cryptocurrency project. The 
 
 startup raised security concerns after thousands of people got their eyes scanned in exchange for money. The foreign minister accuses Worldcoin of 
 
 data harvesting and using Kenyans as guinea pigs. 
 
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced that he and his wife Sophie are separating. In an Instagram post, Trudeau said the two have had 
 
 many meaningful and difficult conversations that led to the decision. The couple married in 2005 and have three children together.
 
Greenpeace activists are sending a message to the U.K. Prime Minister. They climbed to the roof of Rishi Sunak's private home in northern England today 
 
 and unfurled a 200-square meters of black fabric. They're upset over his government's plans to issue hundreds of new licenses for oil and gas 
 
 drilling in the North Sea. 
 
All right, now back to our top story. In less than four hours, Donald Trump will make history yet again, as he's arraigned for a third time in just a 
 
 matter of months. He's expected to plead not guilty to charges that he tried to overturn the 2020 election. CNN's Jake Tapper takes a closer look 
 
 at what's in the indictment. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR (voice-over):  The indictment includes some startling details about the alleged willingness of Trump's co-conspirators 
 
 to foment violence. In a meeting on January 4th, one of Former President Trump's senior advisors told co-conspirator number two, John Eastman, his 
 
 plan to undermine the Democratic election would, quote, "cause riots in the streets". The indictment says that Eastman, quote, "responded that there 
 
 had previously been points in the nation's history where violence was necessary to protect the republic", unquote. 
 
And Former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark, co-conspirator number four, expressed a similar sentiment in a meeting on January 3rd when he was 
 
 told by a deputy White House council there would be, quote, "riots in every major city if Trump didn't leave office". According to the indictment, 
 
 Clark responded, quote, "Well, that's why there's an insurrection act", unquote. A reference to the 1807 law empowering the President to use the 
 
 military to suppress any civil disorder. 
 
The indictment mentions how Trump and two co-conspirators spoke at the "Save America" rally in Washington, D.C. a few hours before the official 
 
 counting of electoral votes at the Capitol. Rudy Giuliani, riling up the crowd. 
 
RUDY GIULIANI, FORMER U.S. ASSOCIATE ATTORNEY GENERAL:  Let's have trial by combat.
 
TAPPER (voice-over):  And then President Trump saying flat out, the rules no longer applied. 
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  Fraud breaks up everything, doesn't it? When you catch somebody in a fraud, you're allowed to go by very 
 
 different rules. 
 
TAPPER (voice-over):  The indictment also notes how Trump and his co- conspirators deceived the crowd gathered that morning, encouraging them to believe Vice President Mike Pence had the power to overturn the election 
 
 results. 
 
JOHN EASTMAN, ATTORNEY FOR DONALD TRUMP:  All we are demanding of Vice President Pence is this afternoon at 1 o'clock, he let the legislatures of 
 
 the state look into this so we get to the bottom of it. 
 
TRUMP:  I hope Mike is going to do the right thing. I hope so. I hope so. Because if Mike Pence does the right thing, we win the election. 
 
TAPPER (voice-over):  And then Trump said this.
 
TRUMP:  We fight. We fight like hell. And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore. 
 
TAPPER (voice-over):  And a few hours later, some in the crowd chanted.
 
CROWD:  Hang Mike Pence! Hang Mike Pence! Hang Mike Pence!
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ASHER:  The indictment against Donald Trump says that he deceived the public. However, a new CNN poll shows that most Republicans still believe 
 
 him. The poll shows that 69 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents believe Joe Biden's 2020 win was not legitimate. That's up 
 
 from earlier this year. 
 
Overall, 61 percent of Americans say yes, that Biden did win fair and square, 38 percent believe that he did not. This is among overall 
 
 Americans. Legit or not, Mr. Biden has certainly some room for improvement. Our own poll shows his approval rating is down to 41 percent. Only Jimmy 
 
 Carter had a lower approval rating at this point in his presidency. 
 
As those numbers show you, the gulf between the two parties continues to grow. CNN's Senior Political Analyst, Ron Brownstein has written an article 
 
 about that stalemate for CNN.com. He joins us live now. Ron, thank you so much for being with us. I mean, I think that it is hard for some people in 
 
 our international audience to really understand why these indictments just sort of seem to continue helping Donald Trump. I think it's interesting 
 
 because next year when these trials start, Donald Trump will have to appear in person. 
 <br>[12:35:00]
 
And that means time away from the campaign trail. Does that change things when it comes to his popularity at all? Or are we gonna see a bump in 
 
 numbers like we're seeing right now?
 
RON BROWNSTEIN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, first of all, I mean, the picture now is somewhat more complex. There's no question that within 
 
 the Republican coalition, this is strengthening and that most Republican voters have bought his line of argument from the beginning that, as you 
 
 noted, 70 percent of Republicans saying in the latest poll that Joe Biden did not legitimately win. In another national survey, 60 percent of 
 
 Republicans now call January six legitimate protest and only about 15 to 20 percent believe that Trump has committed crimes on any of the offenses 
 
 facing him. 
 
So, there's no question that within the Republican coalition, his arguments have prevailed and Republican voters have rallied around him on the idea 
 
 that he is being targeted by, quote, "the deep state". On the other hand, beyond the Republican coalition, there is a clear majority of voters in 
 
 multiple polls who say that if he is convicted of a crime, he should not be president again. That is not a surprising result, perhaps, but it is one 
 
 that underscores the importance of whether any of these trials occur before November 24, because that could solidify and crystallize that sentiment 
 
 among voters outside of the core Republican coalition.
 
ASHER:  So, then, when it comes to other candidates who are running, for example, you know, there was so much excitement initially about Ron 
 
 DeSantis, who billed himself as Trump without the drama, you know, I'm going to govern more effectively than Donald Trump, I'm much more electable 
 
 than Donald Trump. You know, he sort of went after, you know, the sort of woke culture, quote unquote, "woke" culture. That didn't work for him. Why 
 
 didn't that break through among Republicans?
 
BROWNSTEIN:  Well, let's stipulate that finding a coalition to beat Trump in the Republican primary is not an easy puzzle to solve. There's somewhere 
 
 between 35 and 40 percent of the electorate that is pretty much with him at this point, no matter what. And that was all that it took for him in 2016 
 
 to win. And he had won a cumulative 40 percent of the vote at the point that he had clinched the nomination in April, 2016.
 
But given that problem, DeSantis has tried to solve it in a very difficult way. I mean, essentially, he has tried to run at Donald Trump from his 
 
 right. You know, I had this image in my head that Donald Trump is this Mack truck driving down the far-right lane of American politics, leaving all 
 
 this room in the other lanes to his left and center. And Ron DeSantis has been trying to pass him on the shoulder, you know, on those six inches to 
 
 his right. 
 
And so, what we see is that DeSantis is failing to consolidate the college- educated, more center-right voters who are the most skeptical of Trump because he's positioning himself so far to the right, and he's not peeling 
 
 away enough of the conservatives who are with Trump. He's kind of boxed himself in at this point. And it'll be interesting to see whether this, 
 
 quote, "reset", allows him to build any more of a broad coalition, because there is a piece of the Republican Party that very much does not want to 
 
 nominate Donald Trump. They are not a majority. The question is that kind of what Witt Ayers, a Republican pollster, calls the "maybe Trump voters" 
 
 who do not view him in a negative way, but are not 100 percent sold on nominating him. 
 
ASHER:  And explain to me the rules among the Republicans who are running for president about when and how they see themselves as being allowed to 
 
 criticize Donald Trump. I mean, you know, I've seen, you know, Mike Pence criticize Donald Trump, especially around the indictments. You know, some 
 
 other candidates have, but the vast majority of them, especially when it comes to the indictments, when they speak out about it, they support Donald 
 
 Trump. They talk about this sort of witch hunt and that it's politically based, et cetera, et cetera. I mean, how does that -- just explain the 
 
 thinking there. How does that help any candidate?
 
BROWNSTEIN:  Yeah, I mean, first of all, the key point is it's not working, right? I mean, the Republicans running against Trump are basically, most of 
 
 them, making the same calculation as in 2016, that something, external events, a meteor from outer space will eventually cause this support to 
 
 crater. And they will be there to pick up the pieces if they don't alienate the diehard Trump supporters by challenging him along the way. The fact 
 
 that he is polling in the 50s, which very few candidates ever have reached, in either party in our primaries, in the modern primary system going back 
 
 to 72, shows that that strategy simply isn't working.
 
Most Republican voters believe that Donald -- they believe, they support his record as president. They believe he won in 2020. If you're going to 
 
 get them to bypass him, despite all the legal, you know, troubles accumulating against him, like snow drifts, you're going to have to give 
 
 them a good reason. And so far, the other candidates have been very shy, gun-shy about doing that. 
 <br>[12:40:00]
 
And I think they are putting themselves in the same position as the Republicans in 2016 of hoping that something comes along and, you know that 
 
 ultimately, there's a straw that breaks the camel's back. 
 
ASHER:  Yeah, I don't know what that something could be. I don't even know what that something could be if three indictments haven't been enough so 
 
 far. 
 
BROWNSTEIN:  Well, maybe the actual trial, you know.
 
ASHER:  Oh, right. Right. Right. Right. Let's see what happens. Go ahead, Ron.
 
BROWNSTEIN:  Go ahead. I was going to say, maybe they're hoping the actual trials do it. But as I say, I mean, the overwhelming evidence in the 
 
 polling is that this strategy is not working. You know, most Republican voters still have a favorable view of Trump. You know, Whittier is that 
 
 pollster I mentioned, you know, points out that for Republican voters who were at least somewhat conflicted about Trump in the beginning, to say that 
 
 he has gone too far now in these indictments is in effect to say that all the people in their life who told this is -- told them this was 
 
 unacceptable and a mistake from the beginning were right. 
 
So, there is kind of a personal, emotional reason for Republicans who were with Trump to stick with Trump, even if they have doubts. And I think that 
 
 is why, is another reason why the other candidates ultimately have to find a- have to give voters a compelling reason not to nominate him. And they've 
 
 just been too, they've been very reluctant to do that outside of figures like Chris Christie and Asa Hutchinson and Will Hurd, who are on the 
 
 periphery of the race.
 
ASHER:  And very quickly, one word answer. Does Trump win in a Trump-Biden rematch in 2024?
 
BROWNSTEIN:  He lost by seven million votes last time. It's hard to see how he ultimately gets over the top. 
 
ASHER:  Although Biden's approval ratings are not great. So, we shall see. 
 
BROWNSTEIN:  And that's right. And that's why they're both -- the weaknesses of each are keeping this neck and neck. 
 
ASHER:  Right. We have to leave it there. Ron Brownstein, thank you so much. We appreciate it. All right. Still to come here. NFL great Tom Brady 
 
 has joined a new business venture and it does not include American football. That story, next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ASHER:  NFL grade Tom Brady has become a minority owner of the British football club, Birmingham City. The seven-time Super Bowl champion entered 
 
 into a partnership with Knighthead Capital Management LLC to buy a stake in the club. He says he's ready for the big change. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TOM BRADY, AMERICAN FOOTBALL QUARTERBACK:  So, here's the deal. I'm officially coming on board at Birmingham City Football Club. And maybe 
 
 you're asking, what do you know about English football, Tom?
 <br>[12:45:00]
 
Well, let's just say I got a lot to learn. But I do know a few things about winning. And I think they might translate pretty well. The road's been long 
 
 for Birmingham. But these fans have never stopped believing. We got a song that says, no matter what, you keep right on to the end of the road. And 
 
 I'll be on that road with you. I'll see you at St. Andrews soon. It's time to get to work. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ASHER:  There's definitely some Ted Lasso parallels there. According to a statement, he'll become the new chairman -- the chairman rather of a new 
 
 advisory board in which he will work in partnership with the club's board. He'll also be a part of the club's leadership team, too.
 
Now, to a truly historic moment in the world of sports. For the first time ever, three African teams have qualified for the knockout stage at the 
 
 Women's World Cup. You've got Morocco, Nigeria, South Africa, each of them advancing to the round of 16. Morocco became the latest to join after 
 
 securing a 1-0 victory against Colombia, a win which shockingly knocked Germany out of the competition. South Africa snuck in a win when it scored 
 
 a game winner in extra time against Italy on Thursday. For more on this, let's bring in our CNN World Sports' Don Riddell.
 
I mean, this is incredible. I mean, obviously, I'm hugely proud of all three African nations, but especially my home country, Nigeria, for doing 
 
 so well in all of this. And there's been so many shockers, the fact that Germany is out, Canada is out. Ultimately, though, I think it makes these 
 
 games that much more interesting to watch. 
 
DON RIDDELL, CNN WORLD SPORT:  Yeah, absolutely. I mean, the World Cup is much more interesting now than it's obviously so much more competitive than 
 
 it has been before.
 
Morocco's win was just absolutely wonderful. Remember they began this tournament with a 6-0 defeat by Germany and they've ended up winning their 
 
 next two games and here they are. This was the big moment against Colombia and Lisa Lamarie keeping a cool to slot this one in. And they had to hope 
 
 that the result in the other game, the other game involving Germany, went their way. 
 
So, there was this kind of scene at the end of the game when they were kind of waiting and waiting and waiting. They weren't sure. Here they are, all 
 
 in the center circle, watching somebody's phone to see the result from the other game. The people in the stadium actually knew before them that 
 
 they've got the result. And these scenes are absolutely wonderful. So, Morocco going through for the first time ever. This is their first World 
 
 Cup. They're one of eight debutant teams at this World Cup. They are the only one of those eight teams still standing. 
 
Let's just kind of show you what happened in the other game because this is of huge significance. Germany, two-time champions, they've always made it 
 
 to at least the quarterfinals. Here they are going down to South Korea. They managed to get an equalizer, but it wasn't enough. Given Morocco's win 
 
 against Colombia, Germany knew they had to win the game and that was as good as it got that goal from Alexandra Popp there. The Germans absolutely 
 
 devastated at the end of this one. They are going home and as you say they're not the only big team going home, either.
 
ASHER:  Yeah, it's Germany, it's Canada, it's Brazil. Can you believe it? Brazil going home, as well. Nigeria in the round to 16 and not Brazil. Oh 
 
 my goodness. I think I've seen it all. Don Ridell, live for us there. Thank you so much. 
 
All right, taking a look now at a viral video. It shows an apparent novice runner finishing in last place at an international competition in China. 
 
 The Somali finished more than 10 seconds behind the winner of the 100- meter race, prompting ridicule, disbelief and anger across social media. 
 
 The chairwoman of the Somali Athletics Federation was suspended by her country over this incident. Among other things, she was accused of engaging 
 
 in an act that defamed the nation. 
 
All right, still to come, a popular diabetes drug used for weight loss is facing a lawsuit over claims of causing severe stomach issues. And Hip Hop 
 
 Star Lizzo speaks out after former dancers make startling accusations in a lawsuit. The response, coming up.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:50:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ASHER:  The makers of two popular diabetes medications are facing a lawsuit. A woman claims she suffered severe stomach problems after taking 
 
 Ozempic and Mounjaro. She says she was never properly warned about possible side effects from the medications. Meg Tirrell has the story.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MEG TIRRELL, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  So, the way medicines like Ozempic work is by mimicking a hormone in the gut known as GLP-1. And this can 
 
 stimulate the body to release insulin, it can curb hunger, and it can slow the emptying of the food from the stomach. Now, that's an on-target effect. 
 
 But CNN recently reported the cases of a few patients taking Ozempic and its sister drug, Wegovy, who had severe forms of that slowed stomach 
 
 emptying called gastroparesis or stomach paralysis. And their doctors believe, that this was caused by the medicines. 
 
Now, there has not been a proven link between these medicines and this effect, but the FDA did tell CNN it has received some reports of 
 
 gastroparesis on these medicines. Now, there is a lawsuit from one woman, separate from the patients that CNN spoke with, claiming that Ozempic and 
 
 another similar drug called Mounjaro, which is approved for Type 2 Diabetes, caused her severe stomach problems. Her legal team writing in a 
 
 lawsuit, quote, "As a result of using defendants Ozempic and Mounjaro, plaintiff was caused to suffer from severe gastrointestinal events and as a 
 
 result sustained severe and permanent personal injuries, pain, suffering, and emotional distress and incurred medical expenses. They are seeking 
 
 damages and claiming that the companies didn't sufficiently warn about these potential risks. 
 
Now, in the drugs prescribing information both for Ozempic and for Mounjaro, the companies do note an effect known as delayed gastric 
 
 emptying, that's sort of slowing of the food from the stomach. But specifically to warn that it could affect the absorption of other 
 
 medications taken at the same time.
 
CNN did reach out to both Novo Nordisk which makes Ozempic and Eli Lilly which makes Mounjaro, the companies provided us statements. Novo Nordisk 
 
 notes that these medicines have been used to treat Type 2 Diabetes and obesity for 15 and 8 years. This class of medicines. They note that they 
 
 have been extensively examined in robust clinical development programs. They also note that this class of drugs are known to cause a delay in 
 
 gastric emptying as noted in the label of each of our GLP-1 receptor agonist medications. They say patient safety is of utmost importance to 
 
 Novo Nordisk. Eli Lilly told us, quote, "Patient safety is Lilly's top priority and we actively engage in monitoring, evaluating and reporting 
 
 safety information for all our medicines." 
 
Now, this is one case from one person at this time. The law firm though does suggest more cases could be coming.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ASHER:  That was Meg Tirrell reporting there. Both drug makers, Nova Nordisk and Eli Lilly, did not mention the lawsuit in their statements to 
 
 CNN. All right, American Hip Hop Star Lizzo has responded to the three former dancers who are suing her. 
 <br>[12:55:00]
 
They claim they were subjected to a hostile work environment and harassment. Lizzo denies the allegations, releasing a statement saying, in 
 
 part, "I cannot accept or allow people to use that openness to make me out to be something I am not. There is nothing I take more seriously than the 
 
 respect we deserve as women in the world. I know what it feels like to be body-shamed on a daily basis, and I would absolutely never criticize or 
 
 terminate an employee because of their weight." Lizzo also says the allegations against her are coming from former employees who have already 
 
 publicly admitted that they were told their behavior on tour was inappropriate and unprofessional. 
 
All right, thank you so much for watching ONE WORLD. I'm Zain Aser. Our special coverage of the arraignment of Donald Trump is up next. You're 
 
 watching CNN.
