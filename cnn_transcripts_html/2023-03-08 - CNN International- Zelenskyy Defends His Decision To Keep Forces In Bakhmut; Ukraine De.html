MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR: Hello, and welcome to CNN Newsroom. I'm Max Foster in London. Just ahead, Ukraine's President doubles down on the need to hold Bakhmut as mercenary say they've seized the entire eastern part of the city.
 
Also ahead, Ukraine vehemently denying any involvement in an attack on the North Stream pipeline last year after report citing new intelligence indicates a pro-Ukrainian group could be to blame.
 
Plus, thousands take to the streets in Georgia's capital Tbilisi clashing over contentious Foreign Agents Bill. More details in just a moment.
 
A bold statement from Russia's Wagner group. The head of the private military company says his fighters are in control of Eastern Bakhmut. The Ukrainian city has been under intense Russian bombardment for months now. The comments came from Yevgeny Prigozhin, who also taunted Ukraine's leaders in a video message and dismiss claims that his forces are taking heavy losses.
 
For its part, Ukraine says its military has killed more than 100 Russian soldiers in just the past day. A spokesman called the Wagner fighters cannon fodder. Meanwhile, NATO Secretary General is not optimistic about the situation predicting Bakhmut could fall in the coming days.
 
Melissa Bell joins us live from Kyiv with the very latest. What do you make of all of these conflicting narratives, Melissa?
 
MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, certainly a fairly chilling message from Yevgeny Prigozhin, Max, that you allude to speaking in that video message released today from that World War II tank monument that we saw his men make it to a couple of days ago suggesting they had managed to inch their way from the river and towards the center of the town. And this time, Yevgeny Prigozhin's message couldn't really be more chilling. Of course, he was answering, Max, Ukrainian official claims that essentially Wagner, his group, was finished as a fighting force, given the toll that Bakhmut has taken on them, given also what we've been hearing from Western officials that they're struggling now to find more convicts to recruit.
 
And so he was replying to that defiantly in front of that monument, but also sending a very chilling message to the Ukrainians saying, get the elderly and the children out and send your fittest most able bodied fighting men in so that we can settle this here and now. So a very direct call from Yevgeny Prigozhin to the Ukrainian authorities, saying, come on, then let's see this off here and now.
 
And, of course, in the context Max, as you say, where the whole world waits to see just how much longer Ukrainian forces can hold on to it, how much longer they will decide to spend lives and time and energy doing so. We have been hearing from them these last few days, not just from President Zelenskyy himself speaking to CNN, but from Ukrainian officials saying that they believe that their strategic ambitions here have been entirely fulfilled.
 
And those were twofold, Max. First of all, degrading Russians war -- Russia's war capability. And specifically, of course, given the toll on Wagner that is an important factor, but mostly gaining time for this spring counter offensive that we know that they're preparing. But certainly, the world looks on to the fate of Bakhmut. And this is also part of Yevgeny Prigozhin's message.
 
If it falls, if and when it falls, be careful because it will be the full might of the Russian army coming through. And the world hasn't yet seen that. So a very chilling message from Yevgeny Prigozhin even as his men look poised to inch their way closer to the town center, Max.
 
FOSTER: OK. Melissa Bell, thank you very much indeed.
 
Well, despite heavy losses and Bakhmut seemingly surrounded by Russian troops, Ukraine's President tells citizens Wolf Blitzer why his forces are keeping up the fight.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
WOLF BLITZER, CNN HOST: Why have you decided not to withdraw from Bakhmut?
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translation): We understand what Russia wants to achieve there. Russia needs at least some victory, a small victory, even by ruining everything in Bakhmut. Just killing every civilian there.
 <br>[08:05:02]
 
They need to put that little flag on top of that to show that society. It's not a victory for them. It's more like, you know, like to support -- to mobilize their society in order to create this idea of that such a powerful army. For us, it's such a difference. This is tactical for us.
 
We understand that after Bakhmut. They could go further. They could go to Kramatorsk, to Sloviansk. It will be an open road for the Russians after Bakhmut to other towns in Ukraine, and the Donetsk direction, in the east of Ukraine. That's why our guys are standing there.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: And Wolf joins us now live. It's a fascinating interview, Wolf, because you really get a sense of why they're holding out for what is really a symbolic city. It doesn't really matter strategically, does it?
 
BLITZER: Well, he disagrees with that assessment. I know the U.S. Defense Secretary, Lloyd Austin says that it's largely symbolic, not strategic, necessarily. But President Zelenskyy in the interview with me, he made it clear that for Ukraine, this is very tactical.
 
If the Ukrainians lose Bakhmut, he said, that opens the door for the Russians to move into other very sensitive areas in eastern Ukraine, and gives them the momentum to take over huge areas. That's why it's so important. President Zelenskyy said, it's so important to maintain Ukrainian control over Bakhmut and that's why they're fighting as hard as they are.
 
And he has no inclination at all to give up and withdraw, as some are suggesting why risk Ukrainian soldiers' lives in an area that you're going to lose anyhow. He doesn't believe they're going to lose it. And that's why he's determined to fight on in Bakhmut.
 
FOSTER: What else struck you about the interview? What else can we expect to see when it plays out in full?
 
BLITZER: He was very grateful to the U.S., especially to President Biden, for that visit, that historic visit to Kyiv in February. He said that was not only important is showing the world that the United States stands with Ukraine. But it was important to show the people of Ukraine, that the United States of America is with Ukraine right now. And that was so important.
 
And he got personal in the -- towards the end of the interview, saying it was even so important for his own children, to see the President of the United States there, walk the streets of Kyiv. Even as those sirens were going off, and we all saw that video. It was so important.
 
He was also very, very sensitive to what's going on here in Washington, with some Republicans suggesting they should -- the U.S. should not give a, quote, blank check to Ukraine. He says he's met with Republican delegations that have come to Ukraine. He formally invited the new Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives Kevin McCarthy.
 
In the interview with me, he invited him to come to Ukraine to see for himself what's going on. Kevin McCarthy, answering questions from our own Manu Raju declined that invitation say there's really no need for him to go. And he criticized President Biden for being slow in providing weapons to Ukraine.
 
On that issue, by the way, President Zelenskyy made it clear that for Ukraine to win, the U.S. says to start providing fighter jets to Ukraine. That will open the door for other NATO allies, other countries providing fighter jets to Ukraine. That would be so significant in -- President Zelenskyy said -- in Ukraine is winning this war.
 
He also wants a longer-range missiles. He said he doesn't need those missiles to attack Russia. He needs those missiles to protect the people of Ukraine who are being slaughtered right now. So he was very sensitive on that issue as well.
 
FOSTER: OK. Wolf Blitzer, thank you so much for joining us from Washington. Be sure to tune in for Wolf's exclusive interview with the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. There's latest day 9:00 p.m. Eastern or 10:00 a.m. Thursday in Hong Kong only here on CNN.
 
Well, Ukraine says it had nothing to do with last year's sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines. Their comments came after a major report citing new intelligence to the pro-Ukrainian group might be to blame. That report was first published by The New York Times. A source familiar with the U.S. intelligence tells CNN the U.S. has not identified the attacker and adds the intelligence assessments cited by The Times was not made with high confidence.
 
More violent protests have erupted in Georgia's Capitol on Tuesday, after lawmakers move to step closer to passing a controversial bill that rights groups say will curtail basic freedoms.
 
Police use water cannon and tear gas on thousands of people after some in the crowd threw stones and petrol bombs. The bill would require some organizations that receive foreign funding to register as foreign agents. Georgia's interior ministry says 66 people were arrested.
 
Salma has been following this for us. Obviously, a very sensitive matter, a huge amount of protest about it. Do you expect we can see more protests?
 <br>[08:10:09]
 
SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes. There have been more demonstrations called today. And I know we just showed those images. And I want to play some of them again, because it just shows you the passion and the anger against this bill on the streets of Georgia today.
 
And why is that? Why is there so much anger about this bill? Well, rights groups believe that it's going to weaken civil society in media, essentially, make it more difficult to be an independent NGO, to be an independent journalist. These very critical checks and balance systems that exist outside the government. Rights groups say it will be harder to do that work, because that bill requires that if you receive 20 percent, or more funding, foreign funding that you have to register with the government. Now how does that play out? Well, the United States, the U.S. Embassy in Tbilisi actually calls it a Kremlin-like bill. They say it gives the government oversight to these independent agencies, that is not necessary and could again, are road the power of civil societies.
 
And there's another important thing to note here. When Russia invaded Ukraine last year, Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia all applied for E.U. membership. Quite quickly after that membership, that pathway to joining the E.U. couldn't be threatened by this bill, because E.U. officials say again, that it could be a violation of E.U. rules, that this could again suppress civil society, suppress that independent media within Georgia.
 
So much so the anger is. But George's own president sided with the protesters. I want you to take a listen to what she said.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SALOME ZOURABICHVILI, GEORGIAN PRESIDENT (through translation): I'm standing here in New York, and behind me is the Statue of Liberty. This is a symbol for which Georgia has always fought and for which we have come to the state. I'm with you, because today you represent free Georgia.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ABDELAZIZ: Now, the president can veto this bill, but there is a parliamentary majority that can overturn that veto. So it's very likely to pass through Georgia's parliament. And the impact of this many fear, is that Georgia rights groups say is being used sort of as a way to circumvent Russian sanctions, to continue to allow the Kremlin to impose its influence in that part in the eastern part of Europe against E.U. movements. So real fears and concerns again on this fault line here between the E.U. and Russia.
 
FOSTER: Salma, thank you.
 
Israeli forces conducted a daylight raid in the occupied West Bank on Tuesday. The operation in Jenin targeted a Hamas militants suspected of killing two Jewish settlers. That man and five other Palestinians were killed.
 
An official with the Israeli Defense Forces say soldiers came under fire when they surrounded the suspects house, and they responded with shoulder fired missiles. A U.N. envoy for Middle East peace says he's alarmed by the events.
 
Elliott Gotkine joins us live from Jerusalem. And again, another daytime raid which is so unusual.
 
ELLIOTT GOTKINE, JOURNALIST: That's right, Max, although they seem to be becoming increasingly common. This is at least the third one that we're aware of happening so far this year. And as you say, in the raids yesterday, and there are actually two that happened, one in Nablus, one in Jenin which was where most of the fighting was happening. As you say Israel was pursuing the man they say, killed the two Israeli brothers in the Palestinian village of Huwara on February the 25th, that they surrounded his residence in which he barricaded himself inside and then fired shoulder fired missiles to kill him. And then in the ensuing gun battle, five more Palestinians were killed.
 
Now Hamas says that the man that Israel was targeting was indeed a member of the militant group, and that he was indeed responsible for killing the two Israeli brothers. And while it also congratulated the fighter martyrs as it described, the other five Palestinians killed, it stopped short of claiming them as members as well.
 
Now in that gun battle, three Israeli soldiers were injured as well. They were not -- they do not suffer life threatening injuries. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed the operation and again warned militant group saying that whoever harms us will pay the price.
 
Over in Nablus, meanwhile, there were two arrests. Israel says that it was the sons of the man that they were targeting in Jenin and they suspect that his children were in some way involved in helping him plan or carry out the attack against the two Israeli brothers.
 
You mentioned the alarm from the U.N.'s Special Coordinator for the Middle East peace process. He also condemned settler violence against Palestinians as well as the Palestinian attacks against Israelis. We also heard from U.S. State Department Spokesperson Ned Price saying that Israel has a legitimate right to defend its people and its territory against all forms of aggression, including those from terrorist groups.
 
And I can tell you that this afternoon there was another incident down by the Gaza Strip. There was an explosive device, according to the IDF, which was activated in their words alongside the border where Israeli troops were. They say that they responded with tank fire towards military posts belonging to the Hamas militant organization.
 <br>[08:15:14]
 
So despite calls and hopes that this meeting miracle that took place in the Jordanian Red Sea border back about the other week and a bit to try to deescalate tensions between Israel and the Palestinians, there seems to be no sign of that for now. Max?
 
FOSTER: OK, Elliott in Jerusalem, thank you.
 
Tens of thousands of people are out in the streets of Greece. Live pictures here of Athens outside the parliament building. Look at that people expressing their anger and frustration over the country's train crash recently, one of the world's -- one of Greece's worst ever.
 
Many labor unions staging mass strikes. At least 57 people were killed when a passenger train carrying more than 350 people collided with a freight train late last month. Some are calling for the Prime Minister to resign.
 
Still to come. days after a deadly kidnapping in Mexico, two American survivors returned to the U.S. What the mother of one of them is saying about the terrifying ordeal.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: It was a medical tourism trip that went horribly wrong. We're learning more details about the attack on four Americans in Matamoros, Mexico on Friday. The group of friends traveled across the border so that one of them could undergo a medical procedure set to be cosmetic surgery.
 
Two of them survived in attacked by armed gunman in the back of the U.S. receiving treatment at the hospital. But sadly, the other two were killed. You can see Latavia Washington McGee, one of the survivors here. Her mother spoke to CNN a few moments ago and shared part of the horrifying experience her daughter went through when the vehicle she was riding in came under attack.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BARBARA MCLEOD BURGESS, MOTHER OF MEXICO KIDNAPPING SURVIVOR: And they came up and hit them and that when they start shooting at the car, shooting inside the van or whatever. And I guess -- the others started run and they got shot at the same time.
 
FOSTER: Yes.
 
BURGESS: Shaeed and Zindell was shot at the same time, and she watched them die.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: CNN Correspondent Rosa Flores joins us live now from Texas. We should clarify here, shouldn't we, that they weren't targeted because they were medical tourists. They just got caught up in this in a horrible way.
 
ROSA FLORES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: You know, what we know from this family is that the friends were very close, and that they traveled from South Carolina here to the Rio Grande Valley first and then crossed over to Matamoros.
 
And Max, we're learning more about the details of just how much time they spent in Mexico before that tragic event happened where they were actually kidnapped. Mexican officials saying that they crossed over at about 9:18 a.m. and then they were lost.
 <br>[08:20:03]
 
They couldn't find the doctor's office, they were trying to communicate with the doctor to get directions to get that medical procedure that they were talking about, and they couldn't find the doctor's office. And then we know, according to Mexican officials that at 11:45, that's when that dramatic video was taken, that shows that the white minivan that they were driving crashed, and then of course, showed that people were being dragged by force onto the bed of a pickup truck. Those dramatic moments happened more than two hours after the Americans had crossed over to Mexico. Now, after that, Mexican authority said that they followed leads, they received a tip yesterday, they followed that tip, that was what led them to the wooden house in the outskirts of Matamoros that led them to the Americans to the -- of the Americans were tragically killed.
 
The other two survived. They were actually brought to the building that you see behind me. This is a hospital here in the Rio Grande Valley of South Texas to get evaluated and also to get treatment. And I should add that one individual has been detained so far, according to Mexican officials, a 24-year-old that was conducting some sort of surveillance with the Americans.
 
But Max, here's the interesting thing. Mexican officials will not say if this individual is connected to the criminal organizations on the Mexican side of the border.
 
FOSTER: What's been interesting to the rest of the world is to learn to the extent of medical tourism between the U.S. and Mexico and the risks associated with it. Of course, this is an extreme version.
 
FLORES: You know, it's fascinating, Max. I grew up here in this area, going to Mexico for medical attention. I mean, that's what people in this area do. A lot of people here don't have money to go to the doctor in the United States, because medical care in the United States is so expensive.
 
But here is the critical detail. I can tell you from growing up here, and also from talking to individuals on both sides of the border, what happens is, individuals who want to go to the Mexican side for medical care, they won't usually call somebody on the Mexican side, we have friends on both sides of the border, to ask about what the temperature is on the Mexican side.
 
If there's anything going on involving cartel activity, people just don't cross the border. But of course, these Americans were from South Carolina far away from the border, unclear if they knew about that type of nuance. Max?
 
FOSTER: OK, Rosa Flores, thank you so much for joining us in Texas, with your insight on that.
 
Now, carefully choreographed event is underway in Beijing where journalists are supposed to be able to openly operate and yet it's still full of state control. We'll have an inside look.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: Right now, China is holding its National People's Congress, a huge political event that welcomes global media, but doesn't give journalists much leeway really. CNN's Selina Wang takes us inside the tightly controlled conference.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SELINA WANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Thousands of government delegates across China are gathering for the biggest annual political meeting known as the Two Sessions. It's the first since China abandoned its zero-COVID policy.
 
But reporters covering the event are still stuck in a COVID bubble, required to stay overnight at a quarantine hotel and get an on-site PCR test.
 
(on-camera): We just left the quarantine hotel. We're now headed to the venue. Everything is highly controlled.
 <br>[08:25:04]
 
(voice-over): The foreign media bus gets dropped off at Tiananmen Square.
 
(on-camera): It is very rare for journalists to get access to this. As you can see, though, there's heavy security, there are guards everywhere. Normally, the Two Sessions is the rare chance for media to get up and close to China's top leadership.
 
Right here on the steps of the Great Hall of the People, this is normally where you will see media trying to doorstop the top leadership. But as you can see, this year, we, the media, were completely separate from the rest of the leaders.
 
(voice-over): The Two Sessions is a carefully choreographed event. The new government shakeups that the rubber stamp parliament will vote on have one unifying goal to strengthen Xi Jinping and the ruling Communist Party's power. And the COVID restrictions are the perfect tool for Beijing to control the message.
 
(on-camera): So media has to apply to get access to specific events. We're not granted approval to all of them. And this is the media area inside the Great Hall of the People. As you can see, it's pretty empty, so it's clearly not an issue of capacity.
 
(voice-over): Some of the events during the week-long meeting allow select reporter questions including Qin Gang's first press conference as China's new foreign minister. He said that conflict with the U.S. is inevitable if Washington does not change course. Qin Gang called Washington's approach, a reckless gamble, accused the U.S. of creating a crisis over Taiwan.
 
Defended China's partnership with Russia as imperative and said it has not supplied weapons to Russia or Ukraine.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: See you at the Two Sessions.
 
WANG (voice-over): Meanwhile, Chinese state media is portraying the legislative meeting as an open event where journalists can freely operate.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Sri Lanka.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm from Loop News. It's an amazing country.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The assemblies also offer journalists the opportunity to put questions to the Chinese premier and ministers.
 
WANG (voice-over): But under these controls, spontaneous run ins with top leaders like the premier and ministers are out of reach. But after today's meeting ended, we had a few minutes to approach some delegates which are a curated group of local representatives.
 
This delegate is part of the Zhuang ethnic minority from the southwestern Guangxi province. She says this is her first time attending the Congress and she feels happy to see her motherland becoming stronger. The rest of the delegates quickly rush out before we have a chance to approach them.
 
The question is how much of these COVID controls will remain in post- pandemic China? It limits access even more to China's already extremely opaque political machine. This much is clear. The communist leadership only wants the world to see one narrative from China. That is the image of unity, strength and victory.
 
Selina Wang, CNN, Beijing.
