KASIE HUNT, CNN ANCHOR: It's Thursday, August 22. Right now on CNN THIS MORNING.
 <br>[06:00:47]

GOV. TIM WALZ (D-MN): Say it with me. We're not going back!
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We're not going back! We're not going back!
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're not going back! We're not going back!
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We're not going back! We're not going back!
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT: Tim Walz headlines night three of the DNC, rallying Democrats with personal stories of his middle-America roots.
 
Plus, Kamala Harris speaks tonight in historic fashion as she will be the first black woman and first Asian American to lead a major party ticket. 
 
And --
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): Let us not forget who assaulted democracy on January 6. He did.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT: Democrats put Trump's role in the January 6 insurrection under the microscope at the Democratic National Convention.
 
And then --
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
OPRAH WINFREY, MEDIA MOGUL: Let us choose common sense over nonsense!
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT: Oprah Winfrey delivers her call to independent and undecided voters to back Kamala Harris. 
 
All right. It is just after 5 a.m. here in Chicago, Illinois, 6 a.m. on the East Coast. A live look at the United Center right here in Chicago. Of course, the home of the Democratic National Convention. 
 
It is quiet now, but a big night tonight. 
 
Good morning, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt. It's wonderful to have you with us.
 
The fourth and final day of the DNC begins. Kamala Harris prepares to make history on that stage behind me and become the first woman of color to accept a major party's presidential nomination.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
(MUSIC: "LET'S GO CRAZY")
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT: It's been a pretty continuous party here in Chicago. Last night, musicians John Legend and Sheila E performing a tribute to Prince. They were just two of the many celebrities who appeared to help introduce Tim Walz.
 
Former players from the high school where he once coached, not celebrities, were onstage as he was formally nominated.
 
And Walz introduced himself last night to Americans on his biggest stage yet with personal stories, including his family's experience with infertility.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
WALZ: It took Gwen and I years, but we had access to fertility treatments. And when our daughter was born, we named her Hope. Hope, Gus and Gwen, you are my entire world. And I love you.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT: I have to say, I mean, what an emotional moment right there. That was Walz's son, Gus, crying, shouting, "That's my dad.: His sister, Hope, was there, also crying. 
 
And those signs in the crowd, they read "Coach Walz." 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
WALZ: You know, you might not know it, but I haven't given a lot of big speeches like this. But I have given a lot of pep talks. So let -- me let me finish with this, team. 
 
It's the fourth quarter. We're down a field goal. But we're on offense, and we've got the ball. We're driving down the field. 
 
We've got 76 days. That's nothing. There'll be time to sleep when you're dead. We're going to leave it on the field. 
 
And as the next president of the United States always says, when we fight --
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We win!
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We win!
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We win!
 
WALZ: When we fight --
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We win!
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We win!
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We win!
 
WALZ: When we fight --
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We win!
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We win!
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We win!
 
WALZ: Thank you! God bless.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT: And now, of course, all eyes turn to Kamala Harris, who in just hours will formally accept her party's nomination for the presidency. 
 
We'll have to see if there's any surprises in store for tonight's program. We had one last night.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
WINFREY: Let us choose loyalty to the Constitution over loyalty to any individual. Let us choose the sweet promise of tomorrow over the bitter return to yesterday.
 <br>[06:05:07]
 
Let us choose honor. And let us choose joy!
 
Let's all choose Kamala Harris!
 
Thank you, Chicago. Thank you, America.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT: Starting to wonder why they didn't save her for the introduction for last -- for tonight. But anyway, joining me now to discuss, Kate Bedingfield, CNN political
 
 commentator, former Biden White House communications director; Bakari Sellers, also a CNN political commentator and former South Carolina state rep; Shermichael Singleton, Republican strategist, CNN political commentator; and Mark McKinnon, former adviser to George W. Bush and John McCain. Of course, the creator of "The Circus" on Showtime is here. Thank you all for being here. 
 
I have to say, that moment with Tim Walz's son. 
 
BAKARI SELLERS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Oh, yes.
 
HUNT: Can we put Gus back up? I mean, it -- I feel like it really stole the show last night. And it -- it said so many things about -- about Tim Walz, about his family in this moment. This, for those who don't know, he struggles with disabilities, has been -- you know, struggled with nonverbal autism. It's just a really, really moving moment.
 
MARK MCKINNON, FORMER ADVISOR TO GEORGE W. BUSH AND JOHN MCCAIN: I've teared up every time I've seen a clip. I tear up thinking about the clip. I mean, it's -- I mean, talking right now about it, I'm tearing up.
 
HUNT: I tear up watching it. I -- it's fair.
 
MCKINNON: It's so powerful, and it's so relatable. I mean, how many people in America have, you know, challenges of some nature? You know, almost all of them do. And -- and it's just so relatable, and -- and it's so authentic. 
 
KATE BEDINGFIELD, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Yes. That's the -- I mean, if -- like if you -- first of all, if you aren't moved by that, I don't know. You've got a heart of stone. I mean, politics aside, like that's -- that's it, man. Like family in that way is just unbelievable.
 
But it is also -- you know, it is about authenticity. And I think we saw that from Walz all night last night. I mean, I think we saw that in the speech he delivered. We obviously saw it in the setup. The students talking about him.
 
And authenticity is -- is one of the most important pieces of successful --
 
MCKINNON: Can I --
 
BEDINGFIELD: -- political communication. And -- and I just think -- I will just say quickly, the frustration with Washington, the disaffection, the disillusionment, some of it is because people feel like the system doesn't work for them. 
 
And some of it is because they feel like so many people in Washington are phony.
 
HUNT: Yes. BEDINGFIELD: And I think that what Walz can -- was able -- what we saw
 
 him do last night and what he's going to, I think, continue to on this campaign, is just connect with people in a real way.
 
MCKINNON: So, when I got the job of doing the media for Bush in 2000, I was first excited then petrified, because it was such a responsibility. So, I went back and studied media for presidential campaigns, going back to the advent of television.
 
And different things happened over time. The revolutions of things that worked and didn't. 
 
And you know, it just got to a point where people were so cynical of anything political, because they know there's a First Amendment. You can say whatever you want. It doesn't have to be true. Politicians are paying for it. 
 
So, the -- the coin of the realm, really, to break through that is authenticity, right? 
 
BEDINGFIELD: Yes.
 
MCKINNON: And I'm telling you --
 
BEDINGFIELD: Yes.
 
MCKINNON: -- in all my experience, I have never seen anything as authentic as that speech last night.
 
BEDINGFIELD: Yes.
 
HUNT: Wow, that is a resounding endorsement. 
 
SELLERS: That's -- that's -- that's also why he reasonable thing why he got chosen. I mean, I think to go back to, you know --
 
HUNT: And what an affirmation of that choice. I mean, she had to kind of go out on a limb on that, right? I mean, it was not the obvious choice.
 
SELLERS: You're excited about that. Walz got him excited.
 
MCKINNON: Yes.
 
SELLERS: But no, I think that Kamala Harris's first choice was to choose her vice president of the United States, her first consequential choice. 
 
And I think the people are seeing -- you know, I told -- I told everybody, frankly, Governor Walz was my fourth choice. 
 
MCKINNON: Yes. 
 
SELLERS: I liked Mark Kelly and Josh Shapiro, and Pete Buttigieg, all before I liked him.
 
MCKINNON: Yes.
 
SELLERS: It was an abundance of riches. 
 
But I think you see why he was chosen. It's that authenticity. "That's my dad" is probably going to be, like, the No. 1 line that sticks out from all the speeches, and it wasn't a speech. Like, Gus is an American hero right now. 
 
HUNT: I mean, don't you just hope that, like, your kid looks at you? 
 
BEDINGFIELD: Yes. 
 
HUNT: Like that? Someday?
 
BEDINGFIELD: Yes. I mean, every parent's -- every child. I mean, yes, that was that is the goal, man. That is winning. Like that is -- that is -- I mean --
 
MCKINNON: Do you have any tissues on the set?
 
HUNT: I know. I need one.
 
BEDINGFIELD: Everything else aside, because that is winning.
 
MCKINNON: And he has never used a teleprompter before.
 
SELLERS: Yes.
 
HUNT: I'm starting to not believe that, I have to say.
 
SELLERS: He said, the two things I don't do well, when he was going through this process. He said, I've never used a teleprompter before. Somebody's going to have to teach me.
 
And I don't debate well. And so, this lines up, that if he did --
 
MCKINNON: Oh, nice expectation setting. Lower that bar.
 
SELLERS: The bar is -- he did -- he did his thing last night. And I think that, when people see that -- and I was concerned, because you have a high, like we had on Tuesday night with Barack and Michelle Obama, you know, two of the greater -- greater pieces of oratory you'll ever see. You know, how do you follow that up as a party, right? How do you -- how do you not have a night that's a dud? 
 
And Governor Walz, he came through.
 
HUNT: Yes. With some help from John Legend.
 
SELLERS: I've got to start pronouncing his name like "walls."
 
SHERMICHAEL SINGLETON, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Kasie, I want to say, just strategically speaking, moments like that, as Republicans attempt to define Harris and Walz, as most Americans, according to data, don't really know who they are. When you have these types of moments that are sort of cemented and
 
 crystallized visually for maybe the few folks in the middle who are kind of undecided, on the fence, it humanizes a person. It's relatable. 
 
And so, when you're trying to draw that contrast, if you can -- if you can make some type of an emotional attachment or an empathetic attachment to a figure, it really makes it more difficult to negatively draw a contrast --
 
MCKINNON: A hundred percent.
 
SINGLETON: -- against that person. So, I just wanted to draw that -- make that assessment there.
 
SELLERS: You're absolutely correct. I think -- I think both of you guys on that side of the table this morning are very correct in the analytical way that you have to approach how you -- how you draw these contrasts.
 
The flip side of this is that Democrats have done a hell of a job of framing J.D. Vance and -- and molding him into this individual who poses some level of inauthenticity. And I don't know if it's fair or not. I don't know J.D. Vance, but that is --
 
MCKINNON: Yes, who do you want coming to Thanksgiving? J.D. Vance or Tim Walz?
 
SELLERS: I think -- I think, you know, I hate this question but it's a question that's asked all the time. 
 
I think the American public today, if you asked 80 percent of them, like, do you want to have a beer with J.D. Vance or do you want to have a beer with Tim Walz? I think he wins that.
 
MCKINNON: A hundred percent. 
 
SELLERS: Now, I don't know where you end up on policy, but a lot of elections are won on that "V" word that I hate to talk about. But it's won on "vibes." 
 
BEDINGFIELD: Yes, and --
 
MCKINNON: You know, again, throwing back to 2000, we did the focus groups. And voters lined up, nine out of ten on key issues with Gore. And we said who do you want to have a beer with? A hundred percent, George Bush.
 
BEDINGFIELD: Yes.
 
MCKINNON: I mean, the beer test is important.
 
BEDINGFIELD: And it's -- and I would say -- and I would say it's a testament to Walz and the Harris campaign, the Harris-Walz campaign, because Republicans did try to come out of the gate pretty tough on Tim Walz. I mean, they tried to, you know -- SELLERS: Yes.
 
BEDINGFIELD: -- question his military service. I mean, they -- it wasn't -- it's not for lack of trying. But, you know, Walz really was able to navigate that effectively. And --
 
MCKINNON: And it's going to be a lot harder now. 
 
HUNT: Well, they're still trying to do it, too, I will say.
 
Mark, when I was on set last night with Chris Wallace, he made this point, saying that, like, the degree and the ways in which they're trying to go after Tim Walz -- I mean, this letter that came out from military members in the -- in Congress, questioning his service, et cetera -- show that they're worried about him. Right? 
 
MCKINNON: Yes. Yes, yes, yes. Exactly. If you want to know where they feel vulnerable, just look where the attacks are coming. 
 
HUNT: Yes. And we've talked about beer. I also kind of wonder if, like, we should have a -- you know, glass that, you know, who do you want to have a glass of wine with, right? 
 
BEDINGFIELD: Yes.
 
HUNT: Because like let's look at what Oprah -- speaking of J.D. Vance -- had to say. Because the thing that has broken through even to Oprah Winfrey, which tells you where kind of her viewers may be on this, is of course, the "childless cat ladies" reference. Watch.
 
We don't have the childless -- wait, here. It's coming. I'm told it's coming.
 
SELLERS: Patience, Kasie. Patience.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
PETE BUTTIGIEG, U.S. TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY: At least Mike Pence was polite. J.D. Vance is one of those guys who thinks, if you don't live the life that he has in mind for you, then you don't count.
 
You know, Senator, when I deployed to Afghanistan, I didn't have kids then. Many of the men and women who went outside the wire with me didn't have kids either. But let me tell you, our commitment to the future of this country was pretty damn physical.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT: OK. So, our control room was up late last night. Sorry. 
 
We don't have that. But Oprah did talk about the childless cat ladies situation with J.D. Vance, which just -- I mean, it shows you how far that has broken through with people. Like, not everything does, right? People are, in many cases, not paying attention.
 
But it seems like, for a lot of people, they know one thing about J.D. Vance. They know that he said that. 
 
BEDINGFIELD: Yes, absolutely. Well, because it's -- I mean, look, first of all, it's something he said. I mean, it's his words, which is -- usually helps a line of criticism get more traction, when you can just point to, this is what the person said, and you don't have to just take the word of whoever's trying to make the argument, you know, that that's what they meant. I mean, he said it. 
 
And it's also -- it's just -- it is such a divisive thing to say. It's like it is almost -- it's unnecessarily rude and divisive and personal. And I think that that -- you know, it tells you a lot about both, certainly, how he views policy as it relates to women, but also just the kind of person he is. It's just a nasty thing to say. 
 
And so, I think that's also why it's gotten so much traction. 
 
MCKINNON: And that's, like, 50 percent of the American population that he's attacking. 
 
BEDINGFIELD: Yes. 
 
MCKINNON: You know? He's attacking 50 percent of the American population.
 
Then you have Kamala, who's worked at McDonald's. And it's one in eight people in America that worked at McDonald's. So --
 
HUNT: One in eight people in America have worked at McDonald's?
 
MCKINNON: One in eight. I looked it up, Kasie. I looked it up.
 
BEDINGFIELD: Dropping the stats.
 
SELLERS: Technically, we need more people to work at Chick-fil-A, because their service is immaculate, but that's completely -- I was going to say, though, that this -- I've been watching the way that Republicans have been approaching the Harris-Walz ticket. 
 
And it's -- I don't want to use the word "weird." But it's -- it's fascinating, because they literally have launched more at Tim Walz than they have at Kamala Harris.
 <br>[06:15:03]
 
They have attacked Tim Walz more than they've attacked Kamala Harris. Now --
 
MCKINNON: To Kasie's point, they're worried.
 
SELLERS: And it's -- and I don't -- I don't -- I don't necessarily understand that the attacks against Kamala Harris are more like spaghetti against a wall. They're all over the place. They're led by -- they're led by Donald Trump. 
 
But the attacks against Governor Walz are like these letters. They're precise. They have ads. They have people coming out and saying this and that and the third. And I just -- it -- it's interesting to see, because his approval rating is still so much higher than J.D. Vance's.
 
HUNT: Shermichael, why do you think that is? 
 
SINGLETON: I mean, look, I think that Republicans do have to focus on the vice president. I think, you know, the ethnic -- she's woman. Ethnicity, rather. She's a woman. I think that does make it a little more difficult. 
 
I mean, I think a lot of voters have been skeptical of the GOP for quite some time on the issues of race. And so, I think that may be a part of how do we go after this candidate without that appearance? 
 
And I think Republicans would be smart to be sort of aware and cognizant of that. 
 
But I will say this. On the issues in places like Bucks County; Erie, Pennsylvania; Luzerne County, those voters there are worried about cost of goods. They're worried about how much it costs to put food on the table, gas in the tank. And all of those things are up over 20 percent.
 
And so if Republicans can stick to that message and continue to remind voters in states such as Pennsylvania, where there are now more registered R's than there are D's for the first time in quite some time, then I think this race will continue to be competitive leading up to November. 
 
BEDINGFIELD: Well, that's such a -- I would say that is such a reflection of how completely Donald Trump has co-opted the Republican Party, because to your point, I mean, there is an economic attack line of attack to make against Kamala.
 
I would refute it. We could go back and forth on it all day.
 
SINGLETON: Yes, of course.
 
BEDINGFIELD: Right? But there is a substantive critique that you could make that you could argue would be effective. 
 
But Donald Trump is incapable of doing that, because he sees a woman. He sees a person of color, and he short-circuits. And the only thing he can do is go to this, you know, hatefulness and vitriol.
 
And -- and you kind of watch the Republican Party just follow him blindly. And it's such an indictment of him, obviously. 
 
HUNT: Well --
 
BEDINGFIELD: But of other Republicans, too.
 
HUNT: Donald Trump last night, Mark, said, quote, "They always say, 'Sir, please stick to policy. Don't get personal.' And yet, they're getting personal all night long, these people," he says talking about the DNC. "Do I still have to stick to policy?" 
 
MCKINNON: Yes. HUNT: Really did not like the Obamas. 
 
MCKINNON: And last night, he said I hate them. I hate Kamala Harris. I hate, I hate, I hate, I hate. All so dark. 
 
You know, the thing that I've been really impressed with, Kate, and I'm interested in your take on this. 
 
The real challenge for Harris is, how does she separate from Biden? I mean, that's -- that's certainly a line of Republican attack. At a time when voters want change, you're kind of the incumbent. 
 
And so, they had, I think they're doing an amazing job. She's doing an amazing job of, you know, sort of patting it on the back, but saying we're going a different way. The freedom agenda of separating from the pure democracy agenda. The joy --
 
BEDINGFIELD: Yes.
 
MCKINNON: -- component. I mean, they -- she has really crafted her own message. 
 
BEDINGFIELD: Yes.
 
MCKINNON: Without, you know -- without dumping the boss, which has been very artful, I think.
 
HUNT: And what Mark is referencing is this reporting from Marc Caputo, who quoted a confidant. It's quoted someone who says a Trump confidant who says Trump says, quote, "This is just the way I am. I hate my opponent. I hate my opponent. Hillary joke, Kamala, it doesn't matter. I just hate them." 
 
And to another adviser, Trump was blunt about taking on Harris: "I'm going to be mean." 
 
BEDINGFIELD: I mean, but we're seeing time and again, people are over it. They don't want that. He had this kind of shock-and-awe value in 2016 where he came on the scene. And it sort of -- it, you know, Democrats were arguing it was hateful and divisive and awful then. But it felt different. And I think that was part of what was appealing to some people. 
 
Remember, but he also, let's -- let's be clear. He also won very, very narrowly in 2016. 
 
And I just -- I think people are over it. They're tired of it. And I think, kind of to Mark's point, what Harris is doing so effectively is presenting this forward-looking message. 
 
She's been in the White House for four years. She has accomplishments to talk about. And she's managing to frame the race, though, as one of hope, possibility, change, which is typically kind of a harder argument for an incumbent to make.
 
HUNT: Yes. BEDINGFIELD: And she's nailing it.
 
SINGLETON: But how --
 
BEDINGFIELD: And in part because people see her as a change.
 
SINGLETON: But how do you make that argument when gasoline is up 51 percent; groceries 22 percent; eggs 47 percent; electricity 32 percent? How do you make that argument of a forward-looking America when people are looking at these prices and realize I have less money in my pocket. 
 
BEDINGFIELD: Because -- I would argue because she has been really effective about telling people who she's fighting for and arguing who Donald Trump is fighting for.
 
SINGLETON: After three and a half --
 
BEDINGFIELD: And it's not about -- and so --
 
SINGLETON: After three and a half years, though, Kate, those issues still persist, which should be the Republican message. 
 
HUNT: I was going to say, that should be -- I mean --
 
SINGLETON: Should be the Republican message.
 
HUNT: That's kind of the problem of the person that's running against you. 
 
All right. Coming up here on CNN THIS MORNING, Bill Clinton makes his 13th DNC appearance, delivering a speech he reworked in just days to try to match the convention's energy.
 
Plus, Oprah Winfrey with her pitch for a vital group of voters in November that Democrats hope to win over. 
 <br>[06:20:05]
 
And this: as the DNC comes to a close, Harris will give the most important speech of her life as she lays out her vision for the future of the nation.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S., 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Bad behavior should result in a consequence. Well, we will make sure he does face the consequence, and that will be at the ballot box in November. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I wonder if those kids had been willing to trade drugs for money. Maybe they would have said no to drugs and yes to life if Mike Dukakis had been president the last eight years. 
 
Don't you ever forget it? Michael Dukakis will never, never, never forget it. 
 
In closing --
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT: "In closing." "In closing" gets the applause, Mark McKinnon. You could see there the -- that red beeping light on the podium in the beginning. That was telling him his time was already up in the beginning of that bite. It was Governor Bill Clinton back in at '88. He went long during one of his first speeches to a DNC crowd.
 
And again, those cheers for the phrase "in closing." 
 
Let's flash forward to this year's DNC. Former President Clinton delivered his 13th speech to a convention audience. He reportedly tore it up and started over on Monday after he heard the first day of the convention and wanted to strike a happier and more joyful tone. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CLINTON: I'll be so happy when she actually enters the White House as president, because she will break my record as the president who spent the most time at McDonald's.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT: He also had some jabs aimed at Donald Trump. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CLINTON: Now, let's cut to the chase. I am too old to gild the lily. Two days ago, I turned 78, the oldest man in my family for four generations. And the only personal vanity I want to assert is I'm still younger than Donald Trump.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT: Mark McKinnon.
 
MCKINNON: The best. What a pro.
 
Not only was he a really, you know, obviously successful president and candidate, he's a good political strategist. I mean, he's -- this guy.
 
And I think the Democrats owe so much to him in terms of the direction of the party when he kind of recentered it with a new Democratic Party. 
 
I think -- I think the Harris-Walz campaign should, you know, look to those lessons. Think about the Sister Souljah moment and make sure that you're appeal -- and he really had such a touch for middle America, right? 
 
SELLERS: Listen, I've been echoing this a lot. Last night, for people who may not know, was -- I don't want to say an audition, because you don't have somebody who was the 42nd president of the United States in audition, but we hadn't heard from Bill Clinton in a very long period of time. 
 
And the question was, does he still have it? Because there are many of us who were talking to the people around Kamala Harris. And we're saying, let the big dog eat, you know? And we want to -- we want to bring him off the porch. We want to send him out there to Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and put them on a -- put him on a bus with Josh Shapiro and, you know, have him in all these diners and stuff.
 
And that's what he wants to do. I mean, Bill Clinton wants to do those things. And I think that this -- this is like his -- it's  one of his last hurrahs. 
 
And I think -- you know, it's so cool. Because if Bill Clinton and Joe Biden and, of course, Barack and Michelle. But if Bill Clinton and Joe Biden can help usher in the first female president of the United States of America, that says a lot for our party. 
 
And, you know, because Hillary has done a lot of work. And Shirley has done a lot of work. And Fannie Lou, they've done a lot of work. And Ella Baker. And like, when are the men going to help us, you know, chip away at this damn glass?
 
BEDINGFIELD: Amen.
 
SELLER: And so now -- now that they're chipping away at the glass with them, I think that it's pretty cool if we can finally break it. What Democrats have to realize, though, is we're still underdogs even today. 
 
BEDINGFIELD: Yes, absolutely. And I think he -- we saw in last night he delivers such an important message, because he connects with people who, you know, have -- who became part of the Democratic coalition in the '90s under Bill Clinton, who -- some who have moved toward -- we saw a move toward Trump in 2016 as kind of, you know, as our politics is realigned.
 
And he showed last night that he really -- he can really still connect with those folks and that he has a good sense of a message that works. 
 
And so, you know, I think it was, you know, to Bakari's point, it's -- it's -- you see, everybody in the Democratic -- in the Democratic church standing up and singing the same hymn. 
 
And that is exciting. 
 
HUNT: Well, speaking of hymns, do we think that Bill Clinton can still do the Macarena? Play the Macarena? I've been looking for an excuse to play this soundbite for literally weeks. Is it in there? I'm told? Yes. Yes. There it is.
 
SELLERS: All right.
 
HUNT: Do you still do the Macarena? Guys, can we get some nats up on this video, please?
 
SELLERS: I'm not sure how the control room found that.
 
HUNT: Please tell me there are nats. 
 
BEDINGFIELD: I think I remember the Macarena. 
 
HUNT: Almost.
 
BEDINGFIELD: I could do the Macarena.
 
HUNT: I could definitely still do the Macarena. There it is. Now it's going to be stuck in my head all day. 
 
Mark McKinnon -- wait, is that Hillary down there doing it? 
 
MCKINNON: Yes, that is. 
 
HUNT: There she is. 
 
BEDINGFIELD: There she is. 
 
HUNT: OK. I'm glad we moved on from this. Anyway --
 
BEDINGFIELD: The '90s, man. 
 
HUNT: Mark McKinnon, Jay -- our friend Jay Mark (ph) wrote -- wrote this about, you know, to Bakari's point, about Clinton. Quote, "It's time to take the big dog off the porch and let him run. Bill Clinton should return to the campaign trail this fall and do what he does best: articulate to Americans why they should vote for Democrats."
