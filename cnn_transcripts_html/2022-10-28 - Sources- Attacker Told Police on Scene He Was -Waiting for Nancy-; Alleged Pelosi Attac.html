JOSH CAMPBELL, CNN SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Now we have been learning, our CNN investigative team looking into the social media footprint of this suspect, it really paints a very chilling and troubling portrait or someone that believed in conspiracy theories. 
 
Some posts on Facebook, he talks about COVID vaccines, he talks about the January 6th committee, as well as 2020 election. He also makes references to Mike Lindell, the MyPillow guy, who has, obviously, been very vocal and spreading election conspiracies, as well. 
 
So again, the motive here, at least according to this individual social media footprint, is coming into focus. Police have him in custody. 
 
We know that Mr. Pelosi remains in the hospital as well. He is expected to make a full recovery. But has undergone treatment. That, according to our colleague, Jamie Gangel.
 
And finally, as you mentioned, what is so chilling are the words that this suspect allegedly spoke as he entered this residence behind me, "Where is Nancy? Where is Nancy?" 
 
It appears he was looking for the speaker of the House, encountering her husband who was here, that they engage in some type of altercation. 
 
Police arriving and tackling that suspect. Both of them going to the hospital. And the suspect being charged with multiple crimes -- guys? 
 
BIANNA GOLODRYGA, CNN HOST: Yes, and that suspect telling police who arrive there at the scene that they're "waiting for Nancy." 
 
Josh Campbell, thank you. 
 
VICTOR BLACKWELL, CNN HOST: Let's bring in CNN's Jeff Zeleny in Atlanta. CNN senior political correspondent, Abby Phillip, also with us. 
 
Abby, let me start with you. Elected officials, law enforcement officials and analysts and experts
 
 we've had on the show say, if this conspirator political rhetoric continues, some day we would reach this moment. 
 
We're see what is on social media. He says he was looking for Nancy. We're now at the moment. 
 
ABBY PHILLIP, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: The moment has arrived for this country. I mean, think this has been years, frankly, in the making, of building and building of accelerating political rhetoric and also, political violence. 
 
I mean, this is -- these conspiracies already produced violence on January 6th and so it's no surprise that would only continue. 
 
Especially because now, the honest truth is that these conspiracies have actually been totally mainstreamed in our political system and this is the consequence of that. It's real. 
 
We've heard these warnings not just from people on the outside but also members of Congress themselves who are scared for their wellbeing, and that of their families.
 
Because they are receiving threats, threats that are not just about free speech, that are about people who intend to do them harm. And in this case, someone was injured seriously enough that he was sent to the hospital. 
 
It's a real warning sign I think for all of us as a nation. 
 
GOLODRYGA: It ties into one of Democrats' main arguments going into the midterms, the preservation and fight for our democracy and the heated rhetoric, not only the polarization and conspiracy theories, but the election deniers, as well, Jeff. 
 
I'm sort of tying this into former President Obama traveling to Georgia. And this has been a message, just preserving and fighting for democracy he's been homed in on and focused on with voters and the message he'll be sending as well. 
 
I'm curious to get your thoughts on how this sits with voters in Georgia. Democracy, preserving democracy is important for voters but that is Trumped by the economy. 
 
JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Sure, democracy is absolutely important to every voter we speak to. But we have to have this conversation at the same time. 
 
I mean, the attack on Paul Pelosi we can't take back. This is the context in which it's happening. 
 
We'll see if former President Obama speaks about this when he delivers a rally speech here tonight in Georgia as he begins his week-long foray into campaigning. 
 
But he's very close to Speaker Nancy Pelosi and very close to Paul Pelosi. And he has been following the news and developments about this. We'll see if he draws a broader lesson from this. 
 
There's no question that these questions of decency and democracy are on the ballot. We're seeing Democrats across the board calling on House Republicans, in particular, to denounce this kind of violence. 
 
We've seen this, of course, on both sides. So we have to be careful in terms of assigning any blame in the particular. 
 
But in the broader connection, no doubt, hatred and denials we've seen contributes to this. So I think it is very much in line with the lesson former President Barack Obama intends to give tonight. 
 
Of course, this is a deep political season. He's trying to rally support for Senator Raphael Warnock, locked in a very close race against Herschel Walker. He'll travel to Michigan and Wisconsin tomorrow. 
 
And who better at the center of this, of course, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, who endured her own foiled kidnapping plot just last year. 
 
So we have seen this throughout as the coarseness of our politics continues to deepen. And all members, as Abby was saying, are very afraid. We hear it from them and with good reason. 
 <br>[14:35:03]
 
BLACKWELL: Those calls, Abby, Jeff mentioned for Republicans specifically to condemn the rhetoric, they are condemning the attack. We're seeing tweets and messages about the attack on Paul Pelosi, well wishes for his health.
 
But if history repeats itself, we won't see the condemnation of the language, of the conspiracies we're seeing on this man's social media. 
 
PHILLIP: Yes, unfortunately, Victor, it doesn't seem like that is coming. 
 
We have to be honest about based on what we know so far. Our reporting is that this individual seemed to have been sharing conspiracies about the last election about -- conspiracies that come out of our politics, about COVID-19, and all of the sort of like rings that emanate from that. 
 
The conspiratorial nature of our politics right now is something that is not being condemned by our political leaders. That's the reality of the situation. 
 
In fact, especially on the right, they are fueling it. Using the anger and disillusionment of conservative voters to push, you know, their political ends and also to push election lies. 
 
And we just have to be up front about the fact that that's happening. It might be advantageous to them in the near term. But in the long term, it's dangerous for everyone. It wasn't just Democrats who are at risk. For example, on January 6th,
 
 Republicans were at risk, too. You saw Kevin McCarthy running and hiding, other lawmakers running and hiding from the mob as they breached the capitol. 
 
The condemnations should have come years ago, and they haven't. They haven't because, at this moment, it works for them. But there are consequences to it for all of us. 
 
GOLODRYGA: There's precedent here. As you mentioned, it's not just Democrats being targeted. In 2017, Steve Scalise was gravely shot. Justice Kavanaugh has been threatened as well. 
 
Jeff, I'm curious if you're hearing at all -- and again, we're hours into this attack -- whether some of the rhetoric -- we heard from McConnell denouncing this attack, as well. 
 
But whether some of the rhetoric and some of the approaches to election deniers and conspiracy theorists may start to change among Republicans and Congress, too. 
 
ZELENY: I'd like to say sure, of course, there will be change. I think there's very little indication of that at all. 
 
We've seen episode after episode over the years, from Steve Scalise to others on both sides, you're right. 
 
But I think these fringe voices -- which Abby is so right when she says they have arrived in the mainstream. They've very much part of the mainstream viewpoint. So, no, I don't think rhetoric will change. 
 
We only have to wait until the next rally that former President Trump will be doing in the next couple days. But, no, I'd be stunned if rhetoric changes. 
 
And it's -- it exists on both sides of the aisle without question. The election denying and conspiracies are coming from one side and they simply are not being denounced. 
 
They've -- if you look at candidates up and down the ballot running for secretary of state and other things, they are embracing these. 
 
So they are absolutely spinning up people, who once upon a team and there has always been fringe believers, but now they have something to latch on to.
 
But I think the short answer to your question here, the bottom line is, no, I'd be surprised if anything changed. 
 
BLACKWELL: Jeff Zeleny, Abby Phillip, thank you both. 
 <br>[14:38:52]
 
GOP Congresswoman Liz Cheney is making good on her promise of fighting election deniers. Next, we'll talk about her new efforts in a pivotal race. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:43:45]
 
BLACKWELL: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband, Paul Pelosi, who was attacked in his home in San Francisco overnight, is in a hospital right now. 
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes, San Francisco's police chief identified the suspect as 42-year-old David DePape. He's known for his embrace on conspiracy theories, including questions over vaccines, election integrity and the January 6th attack. 
 
Congressman Adam Kinzinger, a member of the congressional committee looking into the riots at the capitol, tweeted a short time ago:
 
"A 42-year-old obsessed with January 6th, election conspiracies, religious tones, attacks an 82-year-old man with a hammer. Paul was struggling with him. How terrifying. Thank you to the San Francisco police. Every GOP candidate and elected official must speak out now. 
 
BLACKWELL: Let's go to Arizona now. And on the campaign trail, a Republican is making her voice known in the races for governor and secretary of state. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. LIZ CHENEY (R-WY): I don't know that I have ever voted for a Democrat but if I lived in Arizona, I absolutely would. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLODRYGA: CNN Kyung Lah joins us now from Phoenix. 
 
Kyung, Wyoming Congresswoman Liz Cheney is following through on her promise to prevent election deniers from winning office. And if that means supporting Democrats, that's what she'll do. 
 <br>[14:45:00]
 
KYUNG LAH, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: That's exactly right, Bianna. She's essentially putting her money where her mouth is. 
 
She is throwing in -- and a little perspective here -- on the Phoenix ad market, it's not a ton of money but still half a million dollars from her PAC to Democrats. 
 
She's essentially telling Republicans and Independents, don't vote for the Republicans at the top of the ticket here in the state, Kari Lake, who is running for governor, and Secretary of State Mark Finchem. 
 
Those two have been prolific supporters, prolific liars about the 2020 election, saying that Donald Trump won. They are already saying that they will not accept the results of the 2022 election if they lose. They will if they win, but not if they lose. And so what national Republicans like Liz Cheney are saying is that
 
 this could have profound impact on 2024 and that's why you're see thing huge ad buy -- this reasonable ad buy, excuse me. 
 
BLACKWELL: Kyung, you've also been working on this special report about the growing number of violent threats that public servants face across this country. Tell us about it. 
 
LAH: Let's take a step back, right? It is starting with the rhetoric coming from loud transmitters. And then it creates an environment where people are allowed to be angry. That then turns into threats. 
 
So what we did was we spent time with the people who feel this, who are the victims. Usually, local officials. And we also spent time with the people who say this should be a part of local politics. 
 
Take a listen.

LAH: So words have consequences. 
 
And we spent the time in towns across the country from the west to the east to Midwest talking to the people who are feeling it -- Bianna, Victor? 
 
BLACKWELL: It's awful. It's the work we need people to do so this country can run.
 
And of course, we're watching still out west in San Francisco this attack on Paul Pelosi, a man going into Speaker Pelosi's home looking for the speaker. 
 
GOLODRYGA: Let's be honest. This didn't just happen overnight. 
 
BLACKWELL: No.
 
GOLODRYGA: This has been brewing and developing for years and years.
 
And in your piece, just that few moments there gives you a sense of the tension and the anger throughout the country right now. 
 
BLACKWELL: Kyung Lah, looking forward to seeing that piece on Sunday. 
 
Thank you so much. 
 
You can watch Kyung's special report, "PERILOUS POLITICS, AMERICA'S DANGEROUS DIVIDE." It's Sunday night at 8:00 p.m. Eastern, right here on CNN.
 
GOLODRYGA: Well, pediatric emergency rooms are being flooded with cases of RSV. We'll take you inside a St. Louis hospital fighting the crisis, up next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:53:02]
 
BLACKWELL: We've got new numbers on the skyrocketing cases of RSV across the country overwhelming children's hospitals. 
 
GOLODRYGA: Positivity rates in the U.S. have jumped 17 percent compared to last year's peak. Many facilities already plagued by staffing shortages are reporting full capacity. 
 
CNN's Adrienne Broaddus is in St. Louis Children's Hospital. 
 
Adrienne, what are you seeing there? 
 
ADRIENNE BROADDUS, CNN HEALTH REPORTER: I can tell you, because of a surge in RSV cases, it's impacting everything at this hospital behind us. 
 
For example, we spoke with the medical director. She says folks who show up here at the emergency department may wait hours before they are treated. In fact, she told us some patients leave because the wait is so long.
 
But it's not just happening here. We're seeing this across the country as these pediatric hospitals fill up. 
 
For example, let's take a look at some of the numbers. Fourteen states plus D.C. are more than 80 percent full. Four of those states, more than 90 percent full. We're talking about Rhode Island, Texas, Kentucky, and Minnesota. 
 
Back here in Missouri, weekly RSV cases more than doubled over the past month. And those cases are more than five times higher compared to this time last year. That's all according to the CDC. 
 
Meanwhile, the medical director, Kim Quayle, says on many days here at this hospital, they're at capacity. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KIM QUAYLE, MEDICAL DIRECTOR, ST. LOUIS CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL: If you compare volumes to last year, we're seeing about a 300 percent increase in RSV cases. 
 
So it's just a very striking peak. And we don't even know if we peaked yet. But we are continuing to see very high volumes of this respiratory virus that primarily affects very small infants and young children. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[14:54:57]
 
BROADDUS: And that's not the only challenge. You know, across the country, hospitals have been dealing with staffing shortages. We've seen nurses in other states walk off the job. It's no different here. 
 
The medical director told us, to help fill that void, some administrators are now working with patients at their bedside -- Victor and Bianna? 
 
BLACKWELL: Wow.
 
Adrienne Broaddus, thank you for the report. 
 
GOLODRYGA: Well, just one day officially with the keys and Elon Musk is making major moves already at Twitter, including firing the company's CEO. What happens next? We'll discuss that after the break.
