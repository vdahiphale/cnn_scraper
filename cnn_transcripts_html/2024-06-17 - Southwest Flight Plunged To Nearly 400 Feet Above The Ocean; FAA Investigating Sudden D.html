THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
<br>[09:00:00]
 
PETE MUNTEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: You may remember a similar incident on a United Airlines flight also in Hawai back in December of 2022, the NTSB 
 
 found significant miscommunication in the cockpit.
 
Now, people might be asking if this was a Boeing problem, because this was on a Boeing 737 MAX 8. It is not likely pilot error here. Pilots simply 
 
 outclassed by the busy problem unfolding ahead of them in the cockpit. FAA investigating here, we will wait to hear if the National Transportation 
 
 Safety Board will also throw its weight behind this incident, although that seems very likely. Amara?
 
AMARA WALKER, CNN HOST: Pete, I need your words of comfort before I travel on Sunday. I mean, it just feels like there have been so many negative news 
 
 coming out of the aviation industry lately. You know, also, with the titanium pieces and now this, and all the close calls on the runways. 
 
 Please, give me some support -- some moral support here before I fly on Sunday.
 
MUNTEAN: Aviation continues to be the safest form of travel, especially in the United States. There has not been a fatality on a commercial airliner 
 
 in the U.S. since 2018. That was a single fatality, a freak incident, when a fan blade came off of an engine on a Southwest Airlines flight and killed 
 
 the passenger sitting next to it. 
 
There has not been a fatal crash of a commercial airliner in the U.S. since 2009. The Colgan air crash that caused major reforms across aviation, 
 
 changed the way the pilots were trained, changed the experience requirements for them. There's been really, really significant change here 
 
 in aviation, and no real significant issues that have followed.
 
The big thing here is to separate these incidents out into a few different buckets. The Southwest door plug blow out back on January 5, that was a 
 
 Boeing quality control issue.
 
So many of these other issues really are simply pilot error issues, and they come to light, in part, because we report on them, because that is why 
 
 we are here, we're the fourth estate, but also because there're just simply more people paying attention to these things.
 
WALKER: Yeah. With you, Pete. Thanks for holding my hand. I appreciate it. Good to see you, Pete Muntean. I'm Amara Walker. Connect the World With 
 
 Becky Anderson is next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:05:00]
 
BECKY ANDERSON, CNN HOST: Well, this is a scene in Washington DC as we speak where President Biden is meeting with NATO's Secretary, General Jens 
 
 Stoltenberg, to discuss Ukraine. It's 9 AM in the U.S. Capitol. It is 5 PM here in Abu Dhabi. I'm Becky Anderson. You're watching Connect the World, 
 
 and wherever you are watching, you are more than welcome.
 
Also, happening this, Israel's Prime Minister disbanding the war cabinet on the heels of Benny Gantz's resignation and the Military announced a 
 
 tactical pause along southern Gaza, while continuing that Rafah offensive. Firefighters are struggling to contain wildfires in northern Los Angeles 
 
 just the latest in a month of extreme weather across the world.
 
And the U.S. Surgeon General calling for warning labels on social media platforms as a social media fueled mental health crisis grows amongst 
 
 teens.
 
Well, stock markets in New York will open about 30 minutes from now, and taking a look at the futures markets, if there are any indication, this 
 
 will be a relatively mixed open today. Well, just hours ago, Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu disbanded Israel's six-member war cabinet 
 
 according to an Israeli official.
 
The cabinet was formed just days after the October 7 terror attacks by a mass. Now, this comes as the Prime Minister expressed frustration over a 
 
 new IDF policy of a daily tactical pause to allow more aid into Gaza. The Israeli military spokesperson has just given CNN a direct explanation about 
 
 that new plan, saying, it was introduced to allow the movement of aid, but that the fighting never stopped.
 
Also, today, U.S. envoy, Amos Hochstein, has arrived in Israel to try to defuse tensions along the border with Lebanon, and UN issues a new warning 
 
 about the prospects of a wider conflict. Right. Let's start with the logistics of that. Tactical pause, Paula Hancocks reports from the Israeli 
 
 side of the Kerem Shalom border crossing where she spoke to the IDF spokesperson. Have a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: So, this is the Kerem Shalom crossing and the Israeli military has brought us here to show us that there is aid 
 
 here that is waiting to get into Gaza. They also said, there's more than 1,000 trucks on the other side, just inside Gaza, that is waiting to be 
 
 distributed.
 
Now, the IDF has announced this tactical route, which will be from 8 AM to 7 PM. And, it will be a safe road from the Kerem Shalom crossing, they say, 
 
 and up the Salah al-Din Road, which is the north south artery in Gaza. Now, we have spoken to international aid groups to the UN within Gaza about 
 
 this. And they have said that they have used this route before, they're not sure what's new about this passageway.
 
But, their concern is the lack of police, the lack of law and order within Gaza itself. So, it is very dangerous for them to be able to come and pick 
 
 this aid up. It's something I asked the IDF spokesperson about. Are you going to escort these trucks, the military will escort them?
 
DANIEL HAGARI, ISRAELI MILITARY SPOKESPERSON: This is the war zone and we need to act inside the war zone, and to find inside the complexity, the way 
 
 that find solutions. The first step is to make sure that the word the road is safe, the road will be safe. Military wise, it will be safe in our 
 
 planning, and our attacks, et cetera, et cetera.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: All right, well, let's get you to Paula Hancocks, who has connecting us this hour from Jerusalem.
 <br>[09:10:00]
 
Ben Wedeman is with us in Beirut. So, Paula, just following up on the conversation you were having there with the IDF spokesperson, it's not 
 
 quite clear just whether the this tactical pause as it's being described, will actually allow more aid to get to people who need it most. Did you get 
 
 the thing more from the IDF?
 
HANCOCKS: No, it's not clear, Becky, and it's not clear whether there would be military escorts with these trucks. I asked that a number of times and 
 
 didn't get a response. The issue is, from -- from these international aid organizations point of view, is that, it has become extremely dangerous 
 
 within Gaza, the fact that the lawlessness is one of the issues, of course, the fighting as well.
 
So, they can take the fighting away from that one particular route. But then you still have the issue of trying to keep the humanitarian aid groups 
 
 safe, being able to protect that aid, going in. And that's really the crux of it at this point. Now, we've had heard from the Gaza media office saying 
 
 that as far as they're concerned, there is no tactical pause, they can still see the fighting, they call it, quote, Israeli lies. 
 
But, the IDF was quite clear that the fighting would continue in tandem with this. So, there will still be the fighting in Rafah, which is very 
 
 close to where we were today and very close to where this -- the aid is supposed to be getting to.
 
And what we did see was the Israeli Military was really putting the onus on the UN, the onus on the international groups to be able to distribute this 
 
 aid, despite the fact that there is this -- this lawlessness within the Gaza Strip at this point, saying that they will work together to come up 
 
 with solutions. But of course, eight months in, those solutions presumably should have been talked about a little earlier. Becky?
 
ANDERSON: Paula, the Israeli Prime Minister has disbanded his war cabinet. Why? And what's the likely impact on decision making?
 
HANCOCKS: So, the war cabinet basically existed of three men. So, it was the Prime Minister, the Defense Minister, and then, Benny Ganz, who's the 
 
 opposition leader, who recently resigned, because he said, Netanyahu, the Prime Minister didn't have a day off to plan and did not have decisive 
 
 plans for getting the hostages out for -- for dealing with the northern border with Lebanon as well.
 
So, it's effectively a two-person war cabinet now. So, it's not unexpected that, that would be disbanded. Of course, the question now is, who makes 
 
 the decisions on the day-to-day running of the military strategy in Gaza, for example.
 
Now, an official within the Prime Minister's office said, that, that will be done within the security cabinet. So, a wider cabinet now, rather than 
 
 the war cabinet, and he will -- the Prime Minister will convene smaller groups, if necessary.
 
Now, the assessment from some is that this was to try and prevent the far right elements of his coalition from -- from filling the void, if you like, 
 
 filling the vacuum in that war cabinet, which would have been a difficult situation, and not very popular with certainly the international community 
 
 and the Biden Administration. Becky?
 
ANDERSON: Ben, let me bring you in at this point. We know that Amos Hochstein is in -- is in Israel at present. This is a -- this is a U.S. 
 
 diplomat who has been working. He will say, and I'm sure the Biden Administration will say tirelessly behind the scenes to try and avoid a 
 
 widening of this conflict into Lebanon. What do we know at this point about where -- where his narrative stands? And how close we are to a widening of 
 
 this conflict at this point?
 
BEN WEDEMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, as far as Mr. Hochstein's schedule, and what he's discussing with, all we know is that, he did meet with Prime 
 
 Minister Netanyahu today, and they discussed the situation in Gaza, and on Israel's northern border, and in Lebanon.
 
Now, we haven't heard anything from either the Lebanese Foreign Ministry or the U.S. Embassy here in Beirut, as to whether he will be coming here, but 
 
 I think it's fairly safe to assume he will, even before the war in Gaza.
 
He was traveling regularly to Israel, to Lebanon, to try to work out, for instance, border issues between the two countries. Now, clearly what he's 
 
 going to be focusing on is, trying to head off a possible full scale war between Israel and Lebanon.
 
Now, Prime Minister Netanyahu is under intense pressure from the opposition from members of his own government to take firmer action to Strike 
 
 Hezbollah.
 <br>[09:15:00]
 
And stop the daily back and forth, and fire, between the two sides and allow the more than 50,000 Israelis who have fled their homes in the north 
 
 to return safely.
 
Now, there is this pressure to launch some sort of massive military action against Hezbollah in Lebanon. But, I think the Americans are well aware and 
 
 probably some elements within the Israeli military, that Hezbollah is a serious foe probably the most formidable foe, Israel has faced on its 
 
 border since the October 1973 War.
 
Israel's options are very limited. If it has a ground incursion into southern Lebanon and create some sort of security zone to ensure the safety 
 
 of those northern Israeli communities, it's back to where it was before it pulled out in May of 2000, essentially, occupying Lebanese land having to 
 
 deal with a Lebanese insurgency, no question led by Hezbollah.
 
On the other hand, if it launches massive air campaign against targets within Lebanon, Hezbollah is perfectly capable of responding and striking 
 
 Israeli cities all the way to Tel Aviv, and probably way beyond. So, the price of war for both sides, Hezbollah and Israel, is very high. And I 
 
 think Mr. Hochstein's mission is to convince both sides, don't do it.
 
Now, we have had a period of quiet on the border between the two sides back in November of last year, when there was an eight-day ceasefire in Gaza. 
 
 Hezbollah has made it clear, if the fighting stops in Gaza, Hezbollah will stop firing at Israel. That's probably the best solution. But, as we've 
 
 seen, efforts to reach a ceasefire, led by the United States, haven't really worked at this point. Becky?
 
ANDERSON: Yeah, absolutely. Ben, and thank you, and to viewers, apologies for the ambient sound there in Beirut. Thank you, both. Well, a massive 
 
 fire is burning in Los Angeles County in California. The post-fire as it's called has scorched more than 14,000 acres, that is nearly 6,000 hectares, 
 
 and authorities say, the blaze which started on Saturday is only 2 percent contained so far.
 
The National Weather Service's warning high wind gusts in very dry air could potentially fuel the flames, sound a major heatwave is expected to 
 
 descend upon large parts of the U.S. this week with record breaking heat building from the Midwest and Great Lakes to the northeast.
 
Meteorologist, Allison Chinchar, is at the CNN Weather Center for us. Look, I mean, we would expect temperatures to be rising at this point. But, how 
 
 off trend are these? How unusual is -- are these weather patterns at this point?
 
ALLISON CHINCHAR, METEOROLOGIST, CNN: That's a great question, Becky. And it's also how much of the population is impacted because I think that's 
 
 something that people need to understand, this isn't just a few states here and there that are dealing with it, over 80 percent of the U.S. population 
 
 is expecting temperatures above 90 degrees at some point this week.
 
That's a large swath of the country. Some of them, it's just a few degrees above average. But, for many, it's going to be very significant. That's why 
 
 you're talking nearly 200 places could end up having some high temperature records, that, now the vast majority of them are in the Northeast and the 
 
 Midwest.
 
But, you can see, we've got a few dots down there into the southeast, as well as a few over by the Rocky Mountains. So, this isn't just limited to 
 
 just one particular area. You have all of these excessive heat alerts in effect across numerous states, because of the prolonged nature. Some of 
 
 these areas may even set those records two or even three days in a row.
 
Looking at these temperatures, again, you're talking well above average, some of these spots 10 to 15 degrees even higher than above normal. The 
 
 other thing we're keeping an eye on is down across the Yucatan Peninsula, this low pressure system right here is going to very slowly make its way 
 
 across and back out into the Gulf of Mexico.
 
But, before it does, it is expected to dump a tremendous amount of rain across several of these Central American countries, keeping in mind that 
 
 for many of these, this will be a month's worth of rain in just three to five days. Some of them over the next course of the week may even see more 
 
 than a month's worth of rain.
 
So, this is going to be very significant for this area as we go through the rest of the week. Now, then, the system will make it into the Gulf of 
 
 Mexico, and once it does, it has a 70 percent chance of becoming a tropical system in just the next 48 hours. Then, it begins to make its way off 
 
 towards the United States.
 
Now, regardless of whether or not this becomes a named tropical storm or not, it's expected to provide a surge of moisture for many of the Gulf 
 
 Coast States, including Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, and even Texas. Look at all of this rain. I mean, you are talking in excess of eight to 10 
 
 inches, maybe even as much as a foot of rain.
 <br>[09:20:00]
 
So, again, for metric folks, I mean, you're talking several 100 millimeters of rain in just a few days. So, this is going to be a pretty significant 
 
 system here. That's why, for the next few days, we have what's considered a moderate risk. That's a level three out of four for excessive rainfall and 
 
 flooding for a lot of this area.
 
ANDERSON: Good to have you. Thank you. Well, as Russia continues its offensive in eastern Ukraine, Vladimir Putin getting ready for a landmark 
 
 trip. He is going to North Korea, a live report on that is coming up.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: Well, intense fighting is said to be going on in eastern Ukraine, it's centered on the town of Vovchansk, which you can see near the top of 
 
 the map here along the Russian border. Russia launched a series of fresh attacks there on Sunday, it's among the territory. Ukraine is struggling to 
 
 hold this. Russia pushes forward in the East and in the south.
 
And Ukraine's army chief says, Moscow is trying to make more gains before new military aid arrives in Kyiv. Meantime, the Kremlin says, Russian 
 
 President, Vladimir Putin, is preparing to visit Moscow's newly important ally in North Korea. He leaves Tuesday and he will be there for two days 
 
 before moving on to Vietnam.
 
CNN's Mike Valerio, joins us from Seoul. And Mike, so, newly -- newly minted friends as it were, why? What do we know about the relationship 
 
 between North Korea and Russia, very specifically between these two leaders when it comes to munitions and arms at this point?
 
MIKE VALERIO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, you know, Becky, it's pretty simple, right? It's because they need each other. This whole visit is about what 
 
 each country needs and what each country is going to get. So, what we're acutely watching, Becky, here on the Korean peninsula is, whether or not, 
 
 at the end of this whole thing, when it's said and done, is there going to be any kind of new military agreement between Pyongyang and Moscow.
 
And the last time, you got to go back into the archives, the UN Treaty archives, that there was a Military agreement between Pyongyang and Moscow. 
 
 We're talking about July 6, 1961, between Khrushchev and Kim Il Sung, a mutual defense treaty that said, you know, if something happens to North 
 
 Korea, the USSR will come to its defense.
 
So, people here, and around diplomatic quarters, are acutely attentive and waiting to see if some sort of agreement about military drills, military 
 
 cooperation results from this latest meeting of this new, as you mentioned, strategic partnerships.
 
So, what each country wants? Let's start with North Korea, shall we at the very top of its list, it needs help with satellite/missile technology. 
 
 Becky, for years, it's tried to launch these five satellites. It's only been successful one time in November.
 <br>[09:25:00]
 
They failed a couple of weeks ago, started sending trash balloons after that failure. They also want food, energy help. They need the prestige of 
 
 meeting somebody like Vladimir Putin, a strong leader from their point of view, and they want another ally against the United States and South Korean 
 
 interests. What Russia wants? It's a shorter list in terms of bullet points, but the magnitude is, just as large, if not larger, what they want? 
 
 More ammo from North Korea.
 
South Korean intelligence officials here in Seoul and in Washington, DC, have told us that there's certainly evidence that North Korean ammo has 
 
 ended up already on the battlefield in Ukraine. So, Russia has had shortages of weapons. North Korea is desperate for foreign cash, because of 
 
 all the sanctions it's been under.
 
And then, meanwhile, where we end with this, Becky, we got to forget about -- we cannot, excuse me, forget about China, all roads in this region, 
 
 inevitably lead to Beijing. At the same time while this is all happening, China and South Korea will be meeting, for the first time in years, to talk 
 
 about their mutual security, to maintain the status quo here on the peninsula.
 
If there's some agreement between Russia and North Korea, new military agreement that would certainly raise American eyebrows. China doesn't want 
 
 anything that would add potentially more American troop levels here on the peninsula. So, a lot to watch. A lot that's going to be going on starting 
 
 tomorrow into Wednesday, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Yeah, absolutely. Good stuff. Thank you very much indeed the insight there with Mike Valerio.
 
VALERIO: No problem.
 
ANDERSON: Well, Donald Trump expected to meet today with House Speaker, Mike Johnson, and Richard Hudson, the Chairman of the National Republican 
 
 Congressional Committee. Our source says, they'll meet privately at Mar-a- Lago, which, of course, is Donald Trump's Florida estate.
 
Today's huddle comes just days after the former U.S. President was in Washington to shore up support within the Republican Party ahead of 
 
 November's election. CNN's Arlette Saenz joins us from the White House, and CNN's Lauren Fox is at our Bureau in Washington. What more do we know about 
 
 this private meeting, Lauren? How should it or could it help Johnson?
 
LAUREN FOX, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, I mean, obviously, this is an important meeting for Speaker, Mike Johnson. And it follows one that he had 
 
 back in April with President Donald Trump that down at Mar-a-Lago, and obviously, follows the Congressional Meeting that happened last week.
 
But, it continues to send a message to conservatives within his conference, that, he is very close to the former President, that the former President 
 
 has his back. And that is an important message to send to people like Marjorie Taylor Greene, who just, a couple of weeks ago, tried to oust 
 
 speaker Mike Johnson.
 
She too is close with former President Donald Trump, cares deeply about what his views are, cares deeply about staying in the fold with former 
 
 President Trump. So, this sends a signal to some of those conservatives and his ranks, that, he is still aligned with the President, that the President 
 
 has his backing.
 
It is also clear, though, that, they want to make sure that they are all on the same page ahead of the election, because so much of the future of what 
 
 former President Trump is going to be able to do, if he wins in November, is going to hinge on whether or not Republicans keep the House of 
 
 Representatives and whether or not they take back the United States Senate.
 
Without those two chambers in Congress, it really would significantly limit what Trump could do, even if he's able to win. So, they want to make sure 
 
 that they have a unifying message going into November. They want to make sure that everyone's on the same page.
 
And they want to try to get rid of any message that's out there that the Republican Party is in disarray, or not unified, going into November. 
 
 Becky?
 
ANDERSON: And they will want as much money to do that as possible, both in terms of fundraising for Donald Trump, of course, and for those who are up 
 
 for election across Congress. Arlette, there is major fundraising going on at present over the weekend. Joe Biden was in LA, who's ahead in terms of 
 
 money at this point, Trump or Biden?
 
ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Becky, we are still waiting for the Biden campaign to announce their numbers for the fundraising in the month 
 
 of May, but former President Trump has announced that he raised $141 million during that month, including $53 million that came in the 24 hours 
 
 after his criminal conviction up in New York City.
 
But importantly, the Trump campaign has yet to say how much cash on hands they have. Of course, that figure is important because that's how they 
 
 continue to buy ads, build open up campaign offices, and hire more organizers. The Biden campaign had touted having $192 million cash on hands 
 
 at the beginning of May.
 <br>[09:30:00]
 
So, we're still trying to get that bigger fundraising picture to see who is ahead in the money race, but Biden has led Trump in fundraising for most of 
 
 the year until the month of April that was the first time that Trump surpassed him in raising money.
 
But, this past week, President Biden added to his campaign war chest, when he held this major Hollywood fundraiser featuring former President Obama, 
 
 and also, Hollywood stars like, George Clooney and Julia Roberts. That event brought in $30 million for the campaign, which is the biggest 
 
 Democratic fundraiser in history.
 
And the Biden campaign, during this fundraiser, the President and Obama really warned, in very stark terms, about what a Trump presidency could 
 
 hold if he is re-elected. The President really drilled in on how he could have a further impact on the Supreme Court if he secures a second term, 
 
 saying that, there likely could be two Supreme Court appointments that come up in the next four years.
 
And Biden also criticized the court taking them on directly saying, that, they are more out of kilter today than they have ever been before. It's all 
 
 part of Biden's arguments as he is really trying to sharpen his attacks against Trump, heading into this first debate in just 10 days. 
 
The campaign today actually released a new television ad, which is directly calling Trump a convicted criminal, the first time that they're leaning 
 
 into using the former President's legal woes in their campaign advertisements.
 
What the campaign is trying to do is, frame this as a choice between a divisive figure, a convicted criminal, who they say is only looking out for 
 
 themselves, and versus, President Biden, who is working for the American people. That's the main focus of that ad. But, it's clear that President 
 
 Biden is trying to amp up his attacks on Trump, heading into this first debate, and hoping to put some of that fundraising money that they've 
 
 brought in, to use on the television airwaves with that ad. It's part of a $50 million campaign.
 
ANDERSON: Yeah, absolutely. And he will hope some of that star power works for him. We've been showing some images of him surrounded by celebrities. 
 
 Good to have you, both. Thank you. Well, a new crackdown on illegal e- cigarettes in the United States. The Justice Department is teaming up with the FDA to stop the flood of counterfeit vapes.
 
Details on that are ahead. Plus, the U.S. Surgeon General's urgent call for Congress to require warning labels on social media apps. This is all about 
 
 protecting U.S. teens. I know. Those of you watching outside of the U.S. will be fascinated to hear this. Those stories are just ahead.
 
(VIDEO PLAYING)
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:35:00]
 
ANDERSON: Welcome back. Half past five in the UAE, half past nine on the East Coast. And that means the markets in New York are opening as we speak. 
 
 I will give them a little time just to get underway. But, that is the picture, we've seen a mix look on the futures market, and indeed, these 
 
 have first started all, but flat traders, were very much in a holding pattern, with no interest rate decisions and yet on the horizon.
 
So, perhaps the reason there, the volumes don't look particularly high either. Let's take a quick look at Facebook, and its parent company Meta, 
 
 social media companies are in the spotlight today. That is because the U.S. Surgeon General is calling for urgent action to help protect young people 
 
 against harm from social media use.
 
In the New York Times op-ed on Monday, Vivek Murthy demanded Congress put warning labels on social media apps just like there are for alcohol and 
 
 chocolate. For example, let me let me say that again, alcohol and cigarettes, of course, there are not warning labels on chocolate bars.
 
He called the mental health crisis among young people an emergency, and said, social media is a major contributor. Speaking on NBC, Murthy said, 
 
 labels would help remind parents and adolescents that social media has not been proven safe.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VIVEK MURTHY, U.S. SURGEON GENERAL: Not only have companies not demonstrated that their platforms are safe for kids, but there's growing 
 
 evidence of harm, but warning label would help parents to understand these risks. Many parents don't know that those risks exist.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: This is fascinating. CNN Medical Correspondent, Meg Tirrell, joins me now from New York with more on this story. And as the Surgeon 
 
 General said, the addition of a warning label requires congressional action. So, that begs the question, is there an appetite for this sort of 
 
 action amongst congressional members?
 
MEG TIRRELL, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, we have certainly seen leaders of social media companies hauled in front of Congress for some very 
 
 powerful exchanges. We haven't yet seen legislation introduced along these lines.
 
So, we're going to have to see how Congress reacts to this call. But, the Surgeon General this morning, citing data, showing that as of last summer 
 
 anyway, according to Gallup, kids were spending almost five hours per day on average, using social media.
 
He also cited, a study from the journal JAMA Psychiatry that showed that kids who use at least -- social media for at least three hours a day, have 
 
 double the risk of mental health problems, like, internalizing problems and showing symptoms of anxiety and depression. He also noticed almost half of 
 
 kids, say that, social media makes them feel worse about their bodies.
 
And so, in this op-ed this morning, he says, it's time to require a Surgeon General's warning label on social media platforms stating that social media 
 
 is associated with significant mental health harms for adolescents. Now, he says, this would be something that at least would let parents know that 
 
 this could be a risk for their kids.
 
He said, the data are imperfect right now. But, it's an emergency and he thinks action is warranted. And this really harkens back to 1965 when we 
 
 saw that warning label go on cigarettes.
 
ANDERSON: And this is absolutely fascinating for anybody who's watching who has kids, and those who, you know, people who haven't got kids will totally 
 
 get it as well. This is really frightening stuff. The Surgeon General is calling not only for a health warning, but also, on social media companies 
 
 to be audited.
 
But, what's the likelihood that a policy like this is put in place, and these social media companies are held to account, and I guess, that begs 
 
 the question, account for what? But, we can have that discussion as well.
 
TIRRELL: Yeah, he's calling for a lot of different things in terms of this potential legislation. If anybody in Congress does act on it, in addition 
 
 to the warning, as you said, which requires Congress to act, he's also asking Congress to require social media companies to report data on the 
 
 health impacts of children to the public, and to independent scientists, so that, audits can be done that are independent.
