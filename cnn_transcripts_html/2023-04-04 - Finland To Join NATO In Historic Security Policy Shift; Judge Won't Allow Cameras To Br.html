KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN ANCHOR:  In just hours from now President Trump will go into that building there -- the Manhattan Criminal Court building here in Manhattan where he is facing arraignment here. 
 
First, we want to bring you some other news that is happening across the world.
 
Today, Finland is going to officially join NATO. That is significant. It is set to become the 31st member country of the military alliance known as NATO. The blue and white Finnish flag is going to fly today from this empty flagpole that is just outside the NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. Obviously, this is a blow to Russia in the war against Ukraine. 
 
NATO's secretary general says the move is going to make Finland safer and the alliance stronger.

JENS STOLTENBERG, NATO SECRETARY GENERAL:  This is a historic week. We will raise the Finnish flag for the first time here at the NATO headquarters. It will be a good day for Finland's security, for Nordic security, and for NATO as a whole.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COLLINS:  Finland joining NATO is something that was once unthinkable, but after Russia's invasion of Ukraine it became quite possible and now is happening. 
 
As for Sweden, they are still waiting to be accepted into NATO. 
 
POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR:  It's a really significant move. 
 
All right, believe it or not, Russia became president of the United Nations Security Council on April first, right -- it of those five nations that sit on the Security Council. And Ukraine says it is the world's worst April Fools' joke. The powerful body is charged with maintaining global peace and security. Presidency rotates alphabetically among the 15 member nations. Russia was last president of the council in February 2022 during the run-up to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. 
 
The Security Council president is supposed to stay neutral but now Russia has the power over meetings on Ukraine and can portray the United States and other Western countries as making false accusations against Moscow.
 
DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR:  And this morning Russian state news agencies say that detained Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich is appealing his arrest in Moscow. He was arrested last week on spying charges and ordered to be jailed until May 29. Russian authorities have provided no evidence for the charge and The Wall Street Journal and U.S. officials have denied the allegation. Gershkovich is facing up to 20 years in a Russian penal colony.
 <br>[05:35:02]
 
CNN's Nada (sic) Bashir -- Nada Bashir is live in London with more. Nada, hello to you. How likely is it that Gershkovich wins this appeal?
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER:  Well look, Don, we haven't even had a date set yet for the hearing on this appeal, and as we've seen in past cases of U.S. nationals detained in Russia there is significant concern. 
 
Of course, in the meantime, we have learned more details, according to Russian state media, regarding the conditions Gershkovich is currently facing while in detention, citing a Russian official who is said to have met with the U.S. journalist. 
 
Now according to this Russian official, Gershkovich has been permitted to go on walks, has access to a library, and has so far raised no complaints regarding the conditions he is facing. He has even, according to this Russian official, appeared cheerful during their conversation. But, of course, it is important to underscore that this is being reported by Russian state media. 
 
Gershkovich is, of course, being held at a pretrial detention center in Moscow's notorious Lefortovo prison, set to remain there for at least another eight weeks. 
 
And we know that the U.S. State Department says it is actively working to secure consular access. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken speaking with the Russian foreign minister over the weekend and is set to raise Gershkovich's case again today, this time in Brussels during a meeting of NATO foreign ministers. Don --
 
LEMON:  Nada Bashir live for us this morning in London. Thank you, Nada.
 
COLLINS:  Also this morning, Trump is set to make history here in the United States as he is facing criminal charges. Our next guest says don't underestimate the Manhattan district attorney's case against him.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [05:40:54]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE TACOPINA, ATTORNEY FOR FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Donald Trump gets indicted and his numbers go through the roof. He's raising more money.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There's going to be a new campaign strategy. Get yourself indicted and you raise a lot of money. 
 
TACOPINA:  (Laughing).
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COLLINS:  That is one of Trump's defense attorneys laughing about how much money they have raised, arguing though that this indictment is actually one of the best things that could have happened to his client, the former president, and his presidential run.
 
We should note Trump's campaign claims they raised about $7 million in the five days since he was indicted. That is according to the campaign. We actually haven't seen any FEC filings. 
 
The attention Trump is getting is set to hit a fever pitch today here in Lower Manhattan when he is going to turn himself in in the building behind me, 100 Centre Street. 
 
The judge in this case has rejected overnight the request to broadcast the arraignment live on television -- something that CNN and other media outlets advocated for in the interest of transparency -- but he will allow some photos before the proceedings begin. 
 
In his order overnight, Judge Merchan acknowledged the historical significance of this proceeding that we are about to witness, writing, quote, "That this indictment involves a matter of monumental significance cannot possibly be disputed. Never in the history of the United States has a sitting or past president been indicted on criminal charges. 
 
Mr. Trump's arraignment has generated unparalleled public interest and media attention. The populace rightly hungers for the most accurate and current information available. To suggest otherwise would be disingenuous."
 
Despite that, Don and Poppy, obviously we will not have actually cameras in there but we will have some photos of those moments before he is, of course, at the defendant table.
 
LEMON:  Yes. Those are going to be some very popular photos.
 
Joining us now is CNN political commentator and political anchor for Spectrum News, Mr. Errol Louis. Good morning to you.
 
ERROL LOUIS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, POLITICAL ANCHOR, SPECTRUM NEWS, HOST, "YOU DECIDE" PODCAST, COLUMNIST, NEW YORK MAGAZINE:  Good morning. LEMON:  Errol, you wrote a fascinating piece in New York Magazine. The headline is for your latest piece for New York mag -- you make the case for not understanding Alvin Bragg's chances against Trump. 
 
I just want to -- if we can put some of it up. I think it's fascinating what you write. You say Trump is an expert at distortion and distraction. He's betting that the public will focus on threats, theatrics, public outrage, and so on. You talk about that. Don't fall for it. Bet on Bragg.
 
And then you say, "The more people criticize and second-guess the motive, skills, and strategy of Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg, the more certain it seems that he is about to strike a simple but devastating legal blow against Donald Trump."
 
Explain, please.
 
LOUIS:  Well look, the case -- if you strip away the sort of titillating features -- porn stars and pay-offs, and so forth -- it's really a business records case. It's a pretty straightforward white- collar case of the kind that happens pretty routinely in that office. And Alvin Bragg's office secured last June a 17-count criminal conviction of the Trump Organization for misstating a lot of its taxes, its compensation, and putting false records out there. 
 
And he said at the time this is a two-chapter case. The first chapter was last summer when they got the conviction on all counts. In fact, the CFO of the Trump Organization is in jail this morning behind that case. And then there's the next chapter. What we're seeing right now is the next chapter. 
 
False business records -- we'll know for sure when the indictment is unsealed. But it's not farfetched to imagine that what they discovered in the course of that prior conviction were -- form the basis of this new indictment of Donald Trump itself.
 
HARLOW:  You write, as Don read, "Bet on Bragg." Can you explain how Bragg's previous prosecutions lead you to believe that he very likely may not only be successful but in your words, deal a devastating legal blow?
 
You write about, for example, former New York State Sen. Malcolm Smith.
 
LOUIS:  Oh, sure. We had a -- we had a -- you know, before he got his current job, which is the first job he's ever run for, Alvin Bragg was a prosecutor --
 
HARLOW:  Yes.
 
LOUIS:  -- in the criminal division of the Southern District, working under Preet Bharara. One of his most high-profile cases where he was the lead prosecutor involved this sweeping set of corruption charges that were proved. And a bunch of people went to prison, including the Senate -- the State Senate majority leader Malcolm Smith. It was a big case -- a high-profile case. [05:45:10]
 
So he's done a lot of -- he's used to dealing with public figures and public officials. And then, at the same time, he's done a ton of white-collar cases. Again, he was -- he was the chief deputy attorney general of the state, and so he dealt with lots and lots of white- collar cases. And so you put those two together -- a white-collar -- pretty much case against a public official and you've got somebody who has decades of experience at this kind of work.
 
So I don't know where people get this idea that they're handing out Harvard law degrees to anybody who comes by, but he happens to have one. He's a very smart guy with a lot of experience on exactly what we're going to see unfold this morning.
 
LEMON:  But in conjunction with Judge Merchan, who was an auditor at a real estate firm and also oversaw the cases of Trump Org., Allen Weisselberg, and so on and so forth.
 
LOUIS:  Yes.
 
LEMON:  Trump businesses, I should say.
 
LOUIS:  Yes. I mean, this is -- this is serious stuff. I mean, this is the -- this is the heart of commerce. This is the center of commerce for this country. And so local law, over the centuries, has developed in such a way that misstating things on your business records, trying to cheat the tax man, trying to scam the government out of a procurement. It's taken very seriously and the laws are really pretty strict.
 
And so -- and this is -- this is going to be records-driven. That's the other thing. A lot of folks seem to have the misimpression that Michael Cohen's testimony -- the former lawyer to Donald Trump -- is what the whole case turns on. I find that hard to believe. Again, we'll know for sure after the indictment is unsealed. But Michael Cohen's lawyer says that there's lots and lots of corroborative evidence that's out there. Phone records, financial records, bank records, all of which were discovered probably last year while they were doing the other case.
 
LEMON:  But isn't also the evidence if he were indeed the central figure that they were going to -- just going to rely on and rely on -- rely on that. They would say OK, you need to be quiet, and he's been giving interviews and Lanny Davis has been giving interviews. So I think maybe you're right on the mark.
 
LOUIS:  Michael Cohen's got a podcast. He's got a book.
 
LEMON:  Yes.
 
LOUIS:  He's got a -- he's got a lot to say. He's got a lot of anger. I don't think the case is going to turn on his credibility. Certainly, they wouldn't have brought the case if that were what they were relying on.
 
HARLOW:  Receipts as they call them. 
 
LOUIS:  Yes. We'll see.
 
HARLOW:  Thanks, Errol, very much -- appreciate it. People should read your piece. It's fascinating.
 
So it's election day in your former home --
 
LEMON:  Chicago.
 
HARLOW:  -- Chicago. Those two men -- that is who -- is it Chicagoans? Is that --
 
LEMON:  Chicagoans. 
 
HARLOW:  All right, Chicagoans are going to decide between as they head to the election -- the runoff for mayor of Chicago. What the outcome could mean for the country also, ahead. Plus this --

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[05:52:24]

LEMON:  Oh my gosh.
 
HARLOW:  It's so hard to watch.
 
The team says Smith was taken to the hospital for further scans and testing on his face and his jaw. We'll keep you posted.
 
LEMON:  Yes, wow. Disturbing to watch there. Man.
 
Two Democrats in Chicago making their final pushes. Voters head to the polls today to decide who will be their next mayor. Progressive Brandon Johnson and moderate Paul Vallas locked in a tight runoff election with a focus on the city's spike in violent crime.
 
CNN's Omar Jiminez has the story.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BRANDON JOHNSON, (D) CHICAGO MAYORAL CANDIDATE:  How the heck are you, Chicago?
 
OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  It's a tale of two Democratic ideologies in America's second city. On one side of the race, Brandon Johnson, a progressive local county commissioner who has the support of the powerful teacher's union. 
 
JOHNSON:  The last I checked, Chicago is a union town.
 
JIMENEZ (voice-over):  National progressive figures, like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, have thrown their support behind Johnson.
 
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT):  What I want you to do is not just elect Brandon; I want you to elect him and then work with him to rebuild this city.
 
JIMENEZ (voice-over):  Johnson's opponent is Paul Vallas, a former head of schools in Chicago and Philadelphia who has the support of the police union.
 
PAUL VALLAS, (D) CHICAGO MAYORAL CANDIDATE:  I want to restore the police ranks and return to a constitutional base, consent to create and reinforce (ph) community policing. 
 
JIMENEZ (voice-over):  While both Johnson and Vallas advanced to the runoff, Vallas took home the most votes the first time around by double-digit percentage points and is being endorsed by more moderate Democrats like Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin and former Obama education secretary Arne Duncan. 
 
Much of Vallas' rise has come from an emphasis on public safety.
 
VALLAS:  When I talk to the business groups and the business associations public safety is the dominant issue.
 
JOHNSON:  Which would you prefer? To have your crime solved or your crime prevented.
 
JIMENEZ (voice-over):  It's a mayoral race that could provide key insight to future political battlegrounds, especially on the Democratic side. 
 
Similar dynamics between candidates have played out in mayors' races in the two other biggest cities in the country but with mixed results. In Los Angeles, the more progressive Congresswoman Karen Bass beat out the more moderate Rick Caruso for mayor. While in New York, the more moderate Democrat and former police officer Eric Adams beat out other progressive candidates to emerge from the primary and become mayor. 
 <br>[05:55:10]
 
VALLAS:  We will make Chicago the safest city in America. 
 
JIMENEZ (voice-over):  Now, Chicago voters have a chance to set a new direction for their city.
 
JOHNSON:  A better, stronger, safer Chicago is just moments away.
 
JIMENEZ (voice-over):  And it's a race that could be a lesson for other Democratic hopefuls countrywide.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
JIMENEZ:  Now, to get here they beat out incumbent mayor of Chicago, Mayor Lori Lightfoot. She was the city's first Black woman and the first mayor who identified as gay in Chicago. It was the first time a full-term incumbent had lost reelection in that city in 40 years. 
 
But obviously, as voters head to the polls today a lot on the line.
 
LEMON:  Since Jane Byrne.
 
JIMENEZ:  Since Jane Byrne, yes. You know -- you know Chicago history.
 
LEMON:  (inaudible) you don't get reelected.
 
HARLOW:  I remember you talking about that.
 
LEMON:  Thank you, Omar. I appreciate it.
 
Kaitlan back to where it's all going to be -- the center of attention today or, as you said, history in the making will be said a lot.
 
COLLINS:  Yes, 100 Centre Street. That is where Trump is going to be in a few hours. He's starting the day at Trump Tower ahead of that historic arraignment. Of course, he is doing a last-minute shakeup to his legal team. He's adding someone to his legal team, we should note. We'll tell you what to expect in court. That's ahead.
