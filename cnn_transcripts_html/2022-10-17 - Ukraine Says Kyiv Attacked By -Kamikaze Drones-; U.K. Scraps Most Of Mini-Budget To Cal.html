BECKY ANDERSON, CNN ANCHOR (voiceover): Residents of Kyiv woke this morning to sounds of explosions. Four people were killed, including a pregnant 
 
 woman. This hour, we explore how Russia is sowing terror in Ukraine with Iranian main kamikaze drones. And a deadly fire at Iran's notorious Evin 
 
 Prison, inmates, and their family members describe a chaotic night marked by tear gas and gunshots, plus
 
XI JINPING, PRESIDENT OF CHINA: Speaking in a foreign language.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We will continue to strive for peaceful reunification with the greatest of sincerity and the utmost effort. But we will never 
 
 promise to renounce the use of force and we reserve the option of taking all measures necessary.
 
ANDERSON: A veiled threat from China's President Xi Jinping prepares to tighten his grip on power.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON: It's just after six in the evening here, I'm Becky Anderson, live from Abu Dhabi for you and this is "CONNECT THE WORLD."
 
And we begin with Russia's latest round of attacks hitting Ukraine's capital once again with so-called Kamikaze drones, terrifying moments for 
 
 many and fatal for some. Officials say at least four people were killed including a pregnant woman and her husband in a strike on a residential 
 
 building.
 
And rescuers are still looking for survivors in the rubble. The Kyiv attacks coming in the morning around the time that commuters were getting 
 
 ready to go to work. And they were part of a wider assault on the country's energy infrastructure, people being urged to conserve power to help keep 
 
 the grid stable.
 
Monday's attacks now have Ukraine calling for sanctions against Iran saying it's responsible for "the murder of Ukrainians." Well, government officials 
 
 claimed the Kamikaze drones used to attack Kyiv were Iranian-made. Tehran denies giving Russia weapons to use in Ukraine, but the EU plans to look 
 
 for concrete evidence of Iran's role in Putin's war. And CNN's Clarissa Ward is live in Kyiv. She'll join us in a moment.
 
First, let's get you to our Fred Pleitgen in Dnipro where that power grid, Fred, came under attack, and the officials there as I understand it says 
 
 there is a serious destruction to the infrastructure. What more do we know at this point?
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: You're absolutely right, Becky. They said that there was serious destruction. 
 
 There were rescue crews that were on the scene there. There was a fire apparently for an extended period of time. And that the situation there was 
 
 really pretty dire after that energy infrastructure installation was hit here, as they say, but also by those Russian kamikaze drones.
 
Now, the current situation they say is still very difficult here in the city of Dnipro and also in the outlying areas. The power plant that was 
 
 hit, Becky, was about 40 kilometers away here from the city of Dnipro, in a very industrialized area. And so the authorities here are urging people to 
 
 conserve electricity. And you know it's something that you really can see on the ground here.
 
Last night, also, most of the street lights are off. Most of the lights in general are off as people are trying to conserve energy as that power grid 
 
 keeps getting hit. And Ukrainian authorities have been saying that they are working very quickly to get all the power infrastructure, energy 
 
 infrastructure, and of course, also heating back up and running as fast as possible because of course they understand it's something that's badly 
 
 needed, especially in the region where I am, but also in other regions of Ukraine as well.
 
And so many of them were hit today, we've been focusing a lot on Kyiv. And obviously situation there this morning was definitely one that was 
 
 devastating for the local population there and also, once again, energy infrastructure hit there. But also, for instance, in the Sumi region in the 
 
 northern part of the country where you also had an energy infrastructure hit. 
 
And the Ukrainians are saying this is part of a larger campaign to sow terror against the Ukrainian population and to also devastate the Ukrainian 
 
 population, as the winter approaches. Of course, what we're hearing from Ukrainian officials is they believe that this is -- or they say this is 
 
 something that's definitely not going to work. If anything they say it will strengthen their resolve rather than have the opposite effect, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: OK, let's get Kyiv then, thank you, Fred, where Clarissa Ward is standing by. These kamikaze drones strikes on Kyiv, the use of what we 
 
 understand to be Iranian-made drones.
 <br>[10:05:03]
 
Although the Iranians have refuted any claims that they are providing weaponry to Russia. Ukraine's Foreign Minister, Clarissa, has called for 
 
 sanctions against Iran in response. Just bring us up to date and what we actually know here.
 
CLARISSA WARD, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: So what we know, Becky, is that for the last month, these Shahed kamikaze drones -- so-
 
 called Kamikaze drones have become an increasingly the sort of weapon of choice on the battlefield. I think today was the first time we saw them 
 
 use, was such an effect here in the capital in Kyiv. Ukrainian authorities said that they intersected some 15 of them that were headed towards the 
 
 city of Kyiv, four of them struck with deadly effect, at least four people killed, a residential building hit, we were there at the scene earlier and, 
 
 you know, just awful. The body of an older woman was brought out. Also among the dead, a young couple, the wife reportedly six months pregnant.
 
And essentially what Ukrainian authorities are saying is that these drones are very difficult for their radar systems to detach. They're asking for 
 
 more support in terms of more sophisticated and more widespread anti- aircraft weaponry to help try to repel these kinds of attacks. You've seen now these images on social media, just extraordinary of police and rescue 
 
 workers basically just firing at one of the drones with their -- with their own rifles in a desperate attempt to stop it in its deadly path.
 
But you mentioned also and significantly that the foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, coming out today and saying, OK, enough is enough. We need to see 
 
 sanctions against Iran for supplying these weapons to Russia and for continue doing to increase even the number of these drones that are being 
 
 supplied with such deadly effect here on the ground in Ukraine, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: And this is a change in strategy. We had had discussions about the potential use of these drones some months ago. But it seems 
 
 increasingly this is now Russia's weapon of choice, correct?
 
WARD: I think that's fair to say. And I think that's because it has -- you know, there are a number of advantages. There's obviously the advantage of 
 
 them being difficult to detect with radars, the advantage that they're firing off a lot of anti-aircraft missiles, like very valuable anti-
 
 aircraft missiles in an attempt to take these drones down. But then you also have the kind of palpable effect on the public psyche.
 
I mean, Kyiv had been relatively peaceful for the last few months up until a week ago, you had that last Monday, a barrage of missiles slamming into 
 
 the city, today, for the first time really seeing those drones. And you can hear them, Becky. They have a very loud, kind of whirring sound almost like 
 
 a lawnmower. And of course, that contributes to a palpable sense of fear that people living here on the ground feel.
 
But the mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, who we talked to at the site of one of those blasts was saying, listen, this is quite clearly an attempt to 
 
 attack civilians, to intimidate and cow civilians, and of course, to hit civilian infrastructure. But the effect that it's having is quite the 
 
 reverse, in fact, that people are feeling angrier than they were before. They're feeling more hardened in their resolve to try to win this war once 
 
 and for all.
 
And I just want to note that they have really been hitting this one specific area in downtown Kyiv now last Monday and again today, this is an 
 
 area where there is critical civilian infrastructure. And we don't yet know whether any of today's blasts did successfully cause some kind of damage to 
 
 that infrastructure. This is obviously a key time now as Ukraine prepares to go into what will most likely be a cold winter, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: And I just wanted to finally end by asking you about that. We're eight months in. We are headed towards what could be a very cold winter. 
 
 You talk about the sort of robust nature of people's attitude in Kyiv and elsewhere in Ukraine in the face of these new attacks. How long can that go 
 
 on?
 
WARD: Well, what's extraordinary to see, Becky, and you know, obviously a lot of this is rhetoric, right? A lot of this is propaganda, and it's 
 
 designed to keep morale going. But definitely in conversations that I have been having with people in Ukraine, I think there has been a visible and 
 
 noticeable hardening of their positions.
 <br>[10:00:00]
 
Compromise, concessions do not any longer seem to be even on the table as a remote prospect. They now see this as an existential battle that must be 
 
 won fully and entirely by the Ukrainian army. And obviously, no one wants to see this thing drag out for months or, God forbid years on end. But 
 
 there is this kind of resolute and stubborn feeling that they are willing to do that, they are willing to withstand and sustain that if that's what 
 
 it takes because they are not in the mood to talk about any kind of negotiations that would involve giving away any part of Ukraine's 
 
 sovereignty.
 
ANDERSON: Clarissa Ward is on the ground. Clarissa, it's always a pleasure. Thank you.
 
Well, for more on Russia's war in Ukraine, cnn.com is where you'll find numerous articles including this one on the roll, better risk of plain 
 
 advancing the conflict. The latest news and analysis also there, of course, that is cnn.com.
 
Well, another screeching U-turn as the British government works to restore the country's financial credibility. Just days into the job, new finance 
 
 minister Jeremy Hunt has announced a comprehensive retreat on Downing Street's fiscal plan. The stunning U-turn would raise about $36 billion. 
 
 Have a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JEREMY HUNT, BRITISH FINANCE MINISTER: We will reverse almost all the tax measures announced in the growth plan three weeks ago that have not started 
 
 parliamentary legislation.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, Hunt's key audiences are clearly, the financial markets. In a statement earlier, he admitted no government can control the markets. Nor 
 
 should I, I think he might have added. He called stability the UK's most important priority at the moment and promised to give more details when he 
 
 faced UK lawmakers in Parliament later this morning.
 
Well, the markets are higher and alongside other markets around the world. And this is the state of play the FTSE100 which is, of course, the London 
 
 Stock market up about 1.3 percent. But that just reflects as you can see some rises elsewhere. And NASDAQ doing particularly well today in that 
 
 market full of tech stocks, of course, that up some 3 percent.
 
Well, CNN's Bianca Nobilo is watching all of this in London. And she joins me now. The government once again conceding today that it went, "too far, 
 
 too fast," what more can we expect when we hear from the UK finance minister in the next hour or so?
 
BIANCA NOBILO, CNN HOST &amp; CORRESPONDENT: Well, Becky, it was exceptional that we heard from the new finance minister, Jeremy Hunt, earlier today 
 
 before he addressed the House of Commons because, as you well know, on matters of tax and big government policy, the way things are done is for 
 
 that minister to tell Parliament first before he speaks to the media. But because of the sensitivity of the markets and the economic crisis that the 
 
 UK finds itself in, there was a discussion between the finance minister and the speaker and they decided that actually, it was OK if he comes out first 
 
 thing Monday morning to try and give the markets that reassurance.
 
And we might need a different term other than U-turn because this is a complete dismantling of Liz Truss and her former Chancellor's mini-budget. 
 
 It completely undermines all of the economic principles and platform by which she was elected, which has led many MPs to question what is the point 
 
 of Liz Truss, why she's still there if the key principles which got her into number 10 are now completely dispensed with. It appears that the 
 
 chancellor is now the one in charge. Let's actually take a listen to one of the most powerful elements of that statement earlier.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT: Because these decisions are market sensitive, I've agreed with the speaker, the need to give an early brief summary of the changes, which are 
 
 all designed to provide confidence and stability. Firstly, we will reverse almost all the tax measures announced in the growth plan three weeks ago 
 
 that have not started parliamentary legislation.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NOBILO: And, Becky, let's let that sink in. That is the Chancellor of the Exchequer saying actually pretty much everything that the prime minister 
 
 and the chancellor had said that they wanted to do, we're now ripping up and we're not doing it.
 
So what can we expect later today? Well, interestingly, the leader of the opposition had tabled an urgent question which would usually mean that the 
 
 prime minister had to appear in Parliament to answer it. But what if she won't be doing that? So the leader of the House of Commons will be in her 
 
 place which has led Labour to accuse Liz Truss of being frit the British 19th-century term, meaning frightened which the optics today are suggesting 
 
 that she might be. And then Jeremy Hunt will address the House of Commons in about an hour's time where he will outline in more detail his approach 
 
 to the financial decisions that are ahead, Becky.
 <br>[10:15:01]
 
ANDERSON: Fascinating. All right, well, we will get you that statement from the finance minister in the next hour or so. Thank you.
 
New details on a growing death toll after a fight inside one of Iran's most notorious prisons, Tehran insists there is no link to the wave of anti-
 
 government protests sweeping the country. Plus, the Biden administration is seething over Saudi Arabia's plans to cut oil production ahead of the U.S. 
 
 midterm elections. The latest on that, after this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: The death toll from the fire at Iran's notoriously brutal Evin Prison is rising. News agency aligned with the Iranian government now says 
 
 that eight inmates died and dozens of others were injured. An Iranian official claim Saturday's blaze is not linked to anti-government 
 
 demonstrations that have swept through the country since the death of a 22- year-old woman in police custody. Mahsa Amini died last month after being detained by Iran's so-called morality police for allegedly not wearing her 
 
 hijab properly, well, that is ignited one of the biggest uprisings against Iran's Islamist regime in years. Today marks one month since protesters 
 
 took to the streets. Tehran, meanwhile, has responded by unleashing a brutal and deadly crackdown.
 
President Joe Biden says the U.S. stands with Iran citizens and he is calling on Tehran to "end the violence against its own citizens for simply 
 
 exercising their fundamental rights." Mr. Biden's remarks sparked an angry response from Iran's President.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
EBRAHIM RAISI, IRANIAN PRESIDENT: Speaking in a foreign language.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It is our belief that America is behind the majority of destruction, terror, riots, and chaos in the region and the world. It 
 
 affirms our belief and the world's beliefs that Americans are angered and upset by every innovation, every happiness or good that happens to Iran.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, Nada Bashir is following all of the developments for us from London. First, the fire Evin Prison, do we know how it started and who 
 
 was to blame?
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER: Well, look, we're still looking for clarity on this. It is impossible for CNN to independently verify how that fire was 
 
 caused. But we have, of course, heard some accounts from pro-reform organizations as well as notable former detainees who have been speaking 
 
 out on the situation and even as well as those who have family members and relatives within the prison complex. And we heard from the pro-reform 
 
 organization, IranWire, that news outlet reporting on Saturday, that according to a source within the prison, a revolt had taken place in 
 
 response a fire had ensued.
 <br>[10:20:02]
 
Although of course we also heard from Iranian officials including one security official who told state media that the fire was caused by thugs 
 
 who had let set ablaze to a clothing warehouse on the complex and that the situation had been quickly brought under control. But, of course, we've 
 
 seen that social media video circulating showing the scene of the thick black plumes of smoke emerging from the prison complex, the sound of 
 
 gunfire and alarms in the background, as well as what appears to sound like explosions. 
 
So there is certainly growing concerned around the situation there. Particularly, of course, because even the president is notorious and known 
 
 for holding political prisoners, we're talking about human rights activists, political figures, journalists, writers, professors, some of 
 
 Iran's best and brightest.
 
Now, we've heard from one human rights activist and former even prison detainee tweeting over the weekend, Atena Daemi, who tweeted that she had 
 
 spoken to a female inmate still at even prison who said that tear gas had been fired by some of the prison authorities. Of course, we've also heard 
 
 those reports from IranWire some of those inside the prisons saying they were forced to break windows in order to actually be able to breathe. And 
 
 they -- she also tweeted, everyone is fine according to this one detainee she spoke to, but they're worried about being transferred to other 
 
 prisoners, saying that someone are going without water, gas, or bread and that dozens had reportedly been transferred to an unknown place.
 
Concerning reports, they've also heard a tweet from Hadi Ghaemi, the Executive Director of the Center for Human Rights in Iran. He tweeted that 
 
 no prisoner is safe in Iran, where people are maimed and killed for criticizing the state. Political prisoners and even -- and Iran should be 
 
 freed. All prisoners should have proper medical treatment and access to counsel and families. A special session of the UN Human Rights Council to 
 
 create a UN investigation to hold Iran's leaders accountable is desperately needed.
 
Now that plea for a session of the UN Human Rights Council has also been echoed by Amnesty International and other rights groups. And of course, 
 
 it's impossible to ignore the context here, Becky. The Iranian authorities have been quick to claim that this had nothing to do with the ongoing 
 
 protests that we're seeing spreading across the country. But these demonstrations have really morphed into a call for regime change. And they 
 
 are spreading up and down the country gaining momentum. And of course, in response, the crackdown by the Iranian regime was also intensifying, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Yes. Briefly, and there is no accountability mechanism as far as we can tell at present, so that's something that needs to be -- that needs 
 
 to be corrected. And Iranian authorities accusing the U.S. president of interfering in state matters, is there any evidence to back that accusation 
 
 up?
 
BASHIR: Well, look, Becky, we have seen a response by the U.S. government, President Biden has been clear in his condemnation of that brutal 
 
 crackdown, and also in his support and the support of the U.S. government for peaceful protests, for the rights of Iranian people to protest against 
 
 the regime and for those urgent reforms that are needed within the country. 
 
But it has to be said the Biden administration has been somewhat more cautious in its approach than perhaps the Obama administration was when we 
 
 saw protest sweeping across the country back in 2009. But, of course, the U.S. government has placed sanctions on both Iranian officials they accused 
 
 of perpetrating human rights abuses, as well as institutions, including the morality police, which has long been the culprit of violence against women 
 
 and of course, has come to the fore when we're talking about Mahsa Amini and other women in Iran who have faced the brutal violence of the morality 
 
 police.
 
But it's not just the U.S. government. The EU, of course, taking a hard- line approach considering further sanctions on Iranian officials. The UK has faced new sanctions on Iranian officials. Also, there has been a 
 
 concerted response by the international community, condemning the violence that we're seeing as described by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty 
 
 International, as excessive and lethal force by the Iranian security forces.
 
But the message that we are hearing from human rights organizations, particularly those that are operating in Iran, is that more needs to be 
 
 done to hold the Iranian regime to account. They have tried very hard to block the spread of information. We've seen internet blackouts in pockets 
 
 of the country. But these protests are continuing. They are gaining momentum. And there is a concern now that as the crackdown intensifies, we 
 
 could continue to see deaths also rising up and down the country, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Nada Bashir on the story, Nada, thank you.
 
Coming up next, our Robert Malley, U.S. Special Envoy for Iran joins me and we will discuss the wave of protests sweeping Iran, Tehran's efforts to 
 
 crush those demonstrations, and how the U.S. government is responding and may respond further to the escalation.
 
Also later, I'll speak with exiled Iranian actress, Golshifteh Farahani. She says the anti-government protests aren't just about Iran, they are 
 
 about the world. That is coming up in the next hour.
 <br>[10:25:11]
 
Well, in his nightly address on Sunday, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said relations between Ukraine and Saudi Arabia are the most meaningful lead 
 
 been in decades.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE: Speaking in a foreign language.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And for the past week, it is worth noting the strengthening of contacts with Saudi Arabia. There are significant 
 
 agreements. Among other things, this is the decision of the partners to provide a package of humanitarian support in the amount of $400 million. It 
 
 is very important. Right now, we have the most meaningful relations with Saudi Arabia in 30 years.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, Saudi Arabia's defense minister affirm the kingdom's support for Ukraine this after the U.S. accused the Saudis of helping 
 
 Russia over the recent OPEC Plus decision to cut oil production. The nation's defense minister tweeted Saudi Arabia was astonished by the 
 
 accusations.
 
Well, that move by OPEC Plus to cut oil production could send inflation in the U.S. soaring just weeks before the midterm elections. U.S. President 
 
 Joe Biden told CNN it's time for the U.S. to rethink its relationship with the kingdom. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan says Mr. Biden is 
 
 reassessing that relationship "methodically."
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: I'm not going to get ahead of the president. What I will say is there's nothing imminently moving now. 
 
 So there was time for him to have those consultations to make decisions that are in the best interest of the American people. He has no plans to 
 
 meet with the Crown Prince at the G20 Summit.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, CNN'S Natasha Bertrand has more on the recently strained ties between the U.S. and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER (voiceover): Tensions between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia escalating sharply this week, with U.S. officials 
 
 accusing the Saudis of strong-arming OPEC into cutting oil production and helping Russia maintain its war machine in Ukraine.
 
ANTHONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: The Saudis had conveyed to us both privately, as well as publicly their intention to reduce oil 
 
 production, which they knew would increase Russian revenues and potentially blunt the effectiveness of sanctions. We made clear that that would be the 
 
 wrong direction.
 
BERTRAND: The OPEC Plus decision to cut oil production by as much as 2 million barrels per day has rattled the White House, which now says it is 
 
 reevaluating its relationship with the Saudis, one of the U.S.'s most important Middle East allies. Just months after President Biden traveled to 
 
 Jeddah in an effort to mend an already faltering relationship.
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I am in the process when the -- when the House and Senate get back, they're going to have to -- there's 
 
 going to be some consequences for what they've done with Russia.
 
BERTRAND: Multiple sources also telling CNN that other OPEC Plus members, including the United Arab Emirates and Iraq, oppose the Saudi-led decision. 
 
 Those countries have now indicated to the U.S. that they may not move forward with the kind of huge cuts that Saudi Arabia wants. One of the 
 
 sources said.
 
The Saudis have pushed back against the Biden administration, releasing a rare written statement accusing the U.S. of trying to distort the facts, 
 
 and insisting the decision was based purely on economic considerations.
 
ADEL AL-JUBEIR, SAUDI FOREIGN MINISTER: Saudi Arabia is not siding with Russia. Saudi Arabia is taking the side of trying to ensure the stability 
 
 of the oil markets.
 
BERTRAND: As the Biden administration considers how to punish Saudi Arabia, a senior official tells CNN they've been purposefully vague to keep the 
 
 Saudis guessing. But one option lawmakers are considering is to ban future weapons sales to the country once Congress is back in session.
 
SEN. CHRIS COONS, (D-DE): I think it's unlikely that we will support any additional arms sales to the Saudis. This was a punch in the gut.
 
BERTRAND: There are currently no imminent weapons sales to Saudi Arabia in the pipeline, though, and experts are skeptical that the relationship will 
 
 fundamentally change.
 
JONATHAN LORD, SR. FELLOW &amp; DIRECTOR, CNAS MIDDLE EAST SECURITY PROGRAM: Because of Saudi Arabia's activities in the war in Yemen and the civilian 
 
 casualties they caused, followed by the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, Congress has become more and more critical and controlling of U.S. foreign military 
 
 sales to Saudi Arabia. There's very little coercion left that the U.S. can do in trying to control military sales to Saudi Arabia.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
BERTRAND: Now, a U.S. official told CNN that the OPEC announcement was "a lot of theater and is ultimately unlikely to take the full 2 million 
 
 barrels of oil per day off the market." But the U.S. is looking to OPEC's next meeting in November to see whether the cartel does stay on this path. 
 
 Natasha Bertrand, CNN, Washington.
 
ANDERSON: Just ahead, China's president lays out his vision for the future, make China great again. We'll look at his plan and some of the concerns 
 
 that it's raising.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:30:21]
 
ANDERSON: Well, we are expecting some fireworks in the UK Parliament, Keir Stramer, the Leader of the opposition speaking now. Let's listen in.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PENNY MORDAUNT, BRITISH CONSERVATIVE MP: With apologies -- with apologies to the leader of the opposition and the House, the PM is detained on urgent 
 
 business. And they will -- they will have to make do -- 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I must do the answer of why the Prime Minister not here.
 
MORDAUNT: I'm afraid you will have to make do with me Mr. Speaker. The prime minister has taken the decision to point my right Honourable friend, 
 
 the member for Southwest Surrey, one of the longest serving and most experienced parliamentarians as her chancellor. Their overriding priority 
 
 is to restore financial stability in the face of volatile global conditions. We will take whatever tough decisions are necessary and have 
 
 made changes to the growth plan, which the chancellor -- which the chancellor is waiting to update the House on as soon as this urgent 
 
 question finishes.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
KEIR STRAMER, BRITISH LABOUR PARTY LEADER: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And thank you to the Right Honourable Member for Portsmouth north for answering 
 
 the question put to the prime minister. I guess under this Tory government, everybody gets to be prime minister for 15 minutes. The country -- Mr. 
 
 Speaker, the country is in an economic crisis made in Downing Street. Because they've lost all credibility, government borrowing costs have 
 
 soared, mortgage rates have ballooned, and markets need reassuring. 
 
And there is long-term damage that can't be undone. Once you've crashed a car at a hundred miles an hour, you've damaged it for good, and you're 
 
 going to be paying much more on your insurance for years to come. And it's working people who will pay, left wondering if they can afford to stay in 
 
 their homes if their hopes of owning a home haven't already been crushed.
 
So now it's time for leaders to lead. But where is the prime minister? Hiding away, dodging questions, scared of our own shadow, the latest not 
 
 for turning ah. Now it's time, to be honest about the mistakes they made. But what does the prime minister say? My vision is right. My mission 
 
 remains. I sacked my chancellor but I can't tell you why.
 <br>[10:35:02]
 
And now's the time for consistent messaging. But what do we get? A prime minister saying absolutely no spending reductions, a chancellor saying 
 
 there will be cuts, a prime minister saying she's in charge, a chancellor who thinks he's the CEO and she's just the chair.
 
How can Britain get the stability it needs when all the government offers is grotesque chaos? How can Britain get the stability it needs, when 
 
 instead of leadership, we have this utter vacuum? How can Britain get the stability it needs when the prime minister has no mandate from her party 
 
 and no mandate from the country?
 
MORDAUNT: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Let me start by saying I'm quite -- quietly confident that the leader of the opposition will not have his 15 
 
 minutes. With regards -- with regard to questions raised on economic policy, I will defer to the chancellor, honorable members -- honorable 
 
 members will want time to question him fully and hear the detail I do not wish to eat into that time. Our constituents will want to hear about the 
 
 issues facing them, their bills, mortgages, benefits, and their businesses. So I had wondered just what else the leader of the opposition wish to 
 
 discuss in this UQ that would delay such an important statement.
 
In his -- in his urgent question, he paints a contrast. So let me paint one too. The decision taken by our prime minister would have been a very tough 
 
 one, politically, and personally. Yet she has taken it and she has done so -- she has done so because it is manifestly in the national interest that 
 
 she did. She did not hesitate to do so because her focus is on the well- being of every one of our citizens. It was the right thing to do. And whether you agree with this or not, it took courage to do it.
 
In contrast -- in contrast, what the Right Honourable gentleman has done today, at this most serious moment, took no courage or judgment or gods to 
 
 the national interest. Three years ago, Mr. Speaker -- three years ago when this parliament was paralyzed by Brexit, a general election would have been 
 
 in the national interest and he blocked it. Today, when the country needs some stability and urgent legislation to put through the cost of living 
 
 measures, and while we are in the middle of an economic war leveled at every school and hospital in this country, he now calls for one and weeks 
 
 of disruption and delay.
 
We will take no lectures from the Honourable gentleman on working in the national interest. I could point to his frustration -- I could point to his 
 
 frustration of us leaving the EU and campaigning for a second referendum. I could point to his support for the Right Honourable Member for Islington 
 
 North and his positions on NATO or his arguments against us leaving lockdown or our involvement of the EU Maxine's agency, all against the 
 
 national interest. And nor will we take any lectures on the consistency of policy or messaging. The Right Honourable gentleman has abandoned every 
 
 single one of his pledges during the labor leadership contest.
 
But I think the country also wants to hear what's being said. If I can't hear, they can't hear. So can we please listen to lead those answers coming 
 
 to the House?
 
MORDAUNT:  am Mr. Speaker. Which is why even on -- 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Who's spoken? If you want to go get it to the chair, I'm more than happy to pay for it.
 
MORDAUNT: Which is why, Mr. Speaker, even on our toughest and most disappointing days, I will always be proud to sit on this side of the 
 
 House. We will put the national interest fast. Now, let's get on and hear from the chancellor.
 <br>[10:40:03]
 
BRANDON LEWIS, CHAIRMAN OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY: Well, I think, first of all, I want to hear from the leader of the House, Sir Peter Bottomley.
 
PETER BOTTOMLEY, FATHER OF THE HOUSE: Can I -- can say to my honorable friend, that the leader of the opposition has reversed most of the things 
 
 he said he would do if he became a leader? If you have a short memory, it's only nine months ago when some of his senior colleagues was circling, see 
 
 when there could be a better position than him. And can I push it to the leader of the House, that when circumstances change is ripe for policy to 
 
 change? And if what's announced today leads to a lower rate of inflation, a lower cost of borrowing, and a greater chance this country to get back to 
 
 prosperity. It's worth doing.
 
MORDAUNT: Well, I agree with the father of the house in what he says the honorable -- Right Honourable gentleman, opposite has reversed his position 
 
 on economic justice, social justice, climate change, promoting peace of human rights, common ownership, defending -- 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON: Well, you're listening to the theater of the House of Commons. Let's put it that way. CNN's Bianca Nobilo is back with us live from London 
 
 and a question from the leader of the opposition to the prime minister who was absent today. And so we heard from Penny Mordaunt, who is the leader of 
 
 the House. Did we learn why she was absent out of interest?
 
NOBILO: Detained on urgent business, apparently, Becky. And that absence was so conspicuous. The prime minister usually would take an urgent 
 
 question from the Leader of the Opposition, especially one on the crisis facing the country, which is, of course, its economy and that's exactly 
 
 what Keir Stramer was asking the prime minister or Penny Mordaunt saying why did you change the chancellor when the country is facing this crisis?
 
The fact that Penny Mordaunt who also vide recently and almost successfully to become prime minister was replacing Liz Truss and delivered quite a 
 
 strong performance that seemed to have been liked by the benches behind her will only put Truss's struggles, I think an even sharper relief. And, 
 
 Becky, we should bear in mind that following Penny Mordaunt shortly will be Jeremy Hunt, another person who recently vide to become prime minister 
 
 instead of Liz Truss. Now both of those people give stronger performances than the prime minister has been of late. You can only imagine how that's 
 
 going to deepen her political despair.
 
ANDERSON: One of the things that was pointed out on the floor earlier on as we await to hear from the finance minister is that this -- the likely 
 
 fallout of this massive U-turn will be weaker growth, a slowdown in inflation, and therefore, it is less likely that the Bank of England is 
 
 going to have to tighten interest rates aggressively. And that very much is reflected in the markets today. The stock market is higher, as is the UK 
 
 pen significantly higher from the point at which it collapsed to two weeks or so ago.
 
At this stage -- I mean, I guess we have to wait to hear from Jeremy Hunt at this point. I mean what more is he going to say today that he didn't 
 
 already say this morning? Let's just remind our viewers why it is that he did speak this morning.
 
NOBILO: So, Becky, Jeremy Hunt spoke this morning in fairly exceptional circumstances addressing the media before he addressed the Houses of 
 
 Parliament when it's an issue pertaining to tax in the economy because the speaker and he decided that it was so important that the markets had that 
 
 reassurance that that was OK. So everything happened as it was supposed to. But it is unusual. And actually speaks to the level of crisis, the fact 
 
 that he even needed to do that.
 
In terms of what we might hear from him today, a fleshing out of details. But the key message was absolutely clear, which is that everything 
 
 basically in Liz Truss, in the former Chancellor's mini-budget that hasn't already been through Parliament, and had the rubber stamp from His Majesty 
 
 will be thrown out. So it's a completely different economic direction that he's going to take the country in.
 
And as to whether or not that will buy Liz Truss any more time perhaps. You know, if the markets were more destabilized, then I think the Conservative 
 
 Party would feel like they'd have to act faster to oust her. This time, it might mean that they feel they can be a little bit more strategic but they 
 
 will continue behind the scenes because they think her position is simply not tenable.
 
ANDERSON: Yes, fascinating. Thank you. We will hear from Jeremy Hunt in the next 20 minutes or so.
 
Chinese President touts his accomplishments as he looks ahead to a third term. CNN's Selina Wang will join us next at the opening of the Communist 
 
 Party Congress. That is after this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:47:12]
 
ANDERSON: China's most consequential political meeting in decades is now underway, the week-long Communist Party Congress opened on Sunday with the 
 
 Chinese president poised to take on an unprecedented third term. And Xi Jinping's opening speech he declared victory on several fronts. He said his 
 
 government had saved lives with its zero-COVID policy and restored order in Hong Kong. And he also warned that China would not rule out the use of 
 
 force with Taiwan and shared his plan to renew economic growth in his country.
 
Well, CNN's Selina Wang joining us live from Hong Kong. What are the highlights from his speech and how was it received?
 
SELINA WANG, CORRESPONDENT: Well, Becky, essentially this was a two-hour speech that was a glowing report card about how Xi's decade and power has 
 
 brought China to these new historic heights. And of course, after the speech, China's propaganda machine went into overdrive to praise Xi 
 
 Jinping's leadership. But this picture of progress that Xi painted is in sharp contrast to the serious challenges that China is facing at home.
 
China is still pursuing the zero-COVID strategy where entire cities are still being locked down over just a handful of COVID cases. And despite the 
 
 growing frustrations of people, it's this is upending billions of people's lives, Xi Jinping made clear in his speech that zero-COVID is not going 
 
 away. In fact, he said zero-COVID is a success that has put Chinese people's lives above all else. He also talked about boosting economic 
 
 growth with innovation. He discussed more self-reliance and technology.
 
Now in foreign policy, he didn't directly name any countries in specific but there were a lot of hints of threats from the United States. For 
 
 instance, he said that China opposes any unilateralism hegemony or bullying. And on Taiwan, there was the biggest applause, Becky, when he 
 
 said that China would never renounce the use of force, the biggest applause from the more than 2000 Communist party delegates in the audience. And what 
 
 that indicates is this growing nationalism, aggression, and confidence in Xi's China, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: What's the future of China's premiership look like under Xi?
 
WANG: Well, Xi Jinping's grand vision for China boils down to this simple statement, make China great again, to restore what Xi Jinping sees as 
 
 China's rightful place on the global stage. And to get there in his view is to increase Chinese communist party control over every part of Chinese 
 
 society.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
WANG (voiceover): From a nation of farming villages to sprawling metropolises in recent history no country modernized as rapidly as China.
 <br>[10:50:08]
 
And did just one decade, no person has changed China more than its supreme leader, Xi Jinping. His image inescapable his thinking indoctrinated in 
 
 school children. His key message, make China great again. But above all else, obey and follow his lead.
 
When he took control of the Chinese Communist Party in 2012, there was hope that the relatively low-key leader would make China's economy and society 
 
 more liberal. But Xi had a different vision, restore the country to its former glory, with his Communist Party, thirdly, at its center.
 
RICHARD MCGREGOR, SENIOR FELLOW FOR EAST ASIA, LOWY INSTITUTE: Xi Jinping sits on top of the party, the party sits on top of China and China sits on 
 
 top of the world. That's basically the program.
 
WANG: Xi's China is investing heavily in new technologies, infrastructure, rapidly modernizing the countryside and the military. He's reasserted party 
 
 control over business and society, building the world's most sophisticated surveillance state, quashing people's freedoms during the pandemic with 
 
 brutal lockdowns. Xi Jinping crushed dreams of democracy in Hong Kong oversaw the internment of up to 2 million Uyghurs and other minorities in 
 
 Xinjiang and what Beijing claims are vocational training centers.
 
He's amping up intimidation of Taiwan, vowing to reunite the democratic island with the Mainland. China tells its people these actions are long 
 
 overdue, fueled by the narrative that after 100 years of subjugation by foreign powers in the 19th and 20th centuries, China is finally assuming 
 
 its rightful place in the world. Anyone who disagrees is blamed for trying to undermine China's rise and quickly censored or even jailed.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Here he is going back to his mythical visions of Chinese history when China was the greatest civilization and the rest of the world 
 
 just followed the leadership of China.
 
WANG: That framing has ripple effects around the world. China no longer believes it needs to play by American-led international rules. When the 
 
 U.S. tries to take China on and trade technology or human rights
 
MCGREGOR: That simply reinforces the sense of China under siege from Western powers. I think it has a visceral, emotional, emotional appeal in 
 
 China.
 
WANG: The country is building its own multilateral institutions that are friendlier to autocrats. China grows ever closer to Russia, unified by a 
 
 common foe. And Xi Jinping's China dream, the country is glorious and strong with the Communist Party ruling 1.4 billion people and shaping a new 
 
 world order.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
WANG: At this Communist Party Congress, Becky, the question isn't who is going to lead China but how Xi Jinping is going to rule China. And what 
 
 we're witnessing is him ripping up the precedent set by modern Chinese rulers before him going from collective rule to strong men rule. So in the 
 
 decades ahead, and the years ahead, we're going to see increasingly the fate of China hinging on the mind of one man.
 
ANDERSON: Fascinating. Selina, thank you. We are taking a very short break. We're back after this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:55:13]
 
ANDERSON: Over the weekend, a few lucky skywatchers were able to see a NASA spacecraft pass over Earth. As CNN's Kristin Fisher reports the spacecraft 
 
 named Lucy is on an incredibly long mission in the name of science and the Beatles.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE &amp; DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Lucy is finally in the sky. The NASA spacecraft is on a 12-year mission, covering 
 
 6.4 billion kilometers to fly past eight ancient asteroids. Lucy is the first mission to investigate the Trojan asteroid swarms, which are asteroid 
 
 clusters along Jupiter's orbital path. Armed with cameras, a thermometer, and an infrared imaging spectrometer, Lucy will collect the first high-
 
 resolution images of these asteroids. 
 
The spacecraft gets her name from the Lucy fossil, an ancient human ancestor whose remains transformed the study of hominid evolution. NASA 
 
 hopes its Lucy transforms the understanding of the evolution of the solar system. Both the fossil and the spacecraft's name or knots to The Beatle's 
 
 hit Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.
 
RINGO STARR, FORMER BEATLE: Lucy is going back in the Sky with Diamonds. Johnny-O love that. Anyway, if you made anyone out there Lucy, give them 
 
 peace of love for me.
 
FISHER: And Lucy does indeed carry a diamond as part of a beamsplitter assembly. After making a few flybys of Earth for a gravity slingshot boost, 
 
 Lucy is expected to reach her first objective, an asteroid named Donald Johanson in the asteroid belt between Earth and Jupiter. She will then 
 
 travel to the Trojan asteroids, all named after the heroes of Homer's Iliad.
 
KEITH NOLL, NASA PLANETARY ASTRONOMER: The power of what Lucy is able to do by having so many targets, we can construct all these comparisons between 
 
 all the different varieties and the diversity that we see in the Trojans -- the unexpected diversity, the different colors, the different collisional 
 
 histories. It's really a repository of fossils, as we like to say of things that happened at the earliest stages of solar system evolution.
 
FISHER: This spacecraft a little more than 14 meters from tip to tip, is powered by two giant solar arrays that will expand outward like Chinese 
 
 folding fans. They'll carry Lucy farther away from the sun than any other solar-powered spacecraft. Lucy will never return to Earth, but she won't be 
 
 the last to visit the asteroids. NASA plans to send more. China and Russia are teaming up on an asteroid mission in 2024 and the UAE in 2028.
