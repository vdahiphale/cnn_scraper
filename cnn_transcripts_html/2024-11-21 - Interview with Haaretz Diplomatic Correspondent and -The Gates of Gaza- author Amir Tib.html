BIANNA GOLODRYGA, CNN ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone, and welcome to "Amanpour." Here's what's coming up.
 
The International Criminal Court issues arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his former defense minister, Yoav Gallant, and 
 
 Hamas' Mohammed Deif. So, what does this mean for Israel and its regional war? I ask Israeli journalist Amir Tibon. Then, former U.S. ambassador for 
 
 War Crimes Issues David Scheffer lays out the legal ramifications.
 
And as the death toll in Gaza surpasses 44,000 and civilians there face widespread hunger and disease, humanitarian Arwa Damon joins us from the 
 
 ground.
 
Also, ahead, a certain idea of America. Author Peggy Noonan tells Walter Isaacson about her collection of columns, exploring the essence of the 
 
 United States over the last 25 years.
 
Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Bianna Golodryga, New York City, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour.
 
In a groundbreaking move, the International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former 
 
 Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza. The court says both men bear criminal responsibility for 
 
 causing mass shootings. starvation in Gaza.
 
This is the first time the ICC has targeted the leader of a democratic country and a close ally of the United States. Every member of the ICC, 
 
 which includes the U.K. and many European countries, are now legally obliged to arrest Prime Minister Netanyahu if he sets foot on their 
 
 territory. That's more than 120 countries. The court also issued an arrest warrant for Hamas military leader Mohammed Deif for crimes including 
 
 murder, torture, rape, and hostage taking. Israel says he was killed during an airstrike earlier this year.
 
The court was also seeking warrants for Hamas leaders Yahya Sinwar and Ismail Haniyeh, but they are now dead.
 
Christiane broke in the news of the ICC's plans back in May. Here's what the chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, told her then.

CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR:  Explain to me exactly what you're asking for and who you are charging.
 
KARIM KHAN, ICC CHIEF PROSECUTOR:  Today, Christiane, we've applied for warrants to the Pre-Trial Chamber of the International Criminal Court in 
 
 relation to three individuals that are Hamas members. Sinwar, who's in charge on the ground.
 
AMANPOUR:  That's Yahya Sinwa.
 
KHAN:  Absolutely. Deif who's in charge of the Al Qasem Brigade. And Haniyeh, who's one of their political bureau based in Doha. The charges are 
 
 extermination, murder, taking of hostages, rape and sexual assault in detention. We'll apply for warrants for Prime Minister Netanyahu, and also 
 
 Minister of Defense Gallant for the crimes of causing extermination, causing starvation as a method of war, including the denial of humanitarian 
 
 relief supplies, deliberately targeting civilians in conflict.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLODRYGA:  Netanyahu's office has responded saying that he utterly rejects the absurd and false actions and accusations, calling the body politically 
 
 biased and discriminatory. So, what does this mean for Israel? I'm joined by Israeli author and journalist for Haaretz Amir Tibon to dissect the 
 
 ramifications and the mood in the country right now.
 
Amir Tibon, welcome to the program. Definitely a dark day for Israel, given the historic nature of these charges and arrest warrants. But we do know 
 
 that Karim Khan sought the warrants back in May. So, how much of a surprise is this for the Israeli government, for the Israeli people? The last six 
 
 months, both Israel and the United States, we should note, have been putting extreme pressure on the ICC to avoid just this.
 
AMIR TIBON, DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT, HAARETZ AND AUTHOR, "THE GATES OF GAZA":  Well, Bianna, this is the kind of thing that, even if you expected 
 
 it, is such a gut punch that it's still a shock for Israel as a nation, obviously for the leadership of this country. And while these are arrest 
 
 warrants only, for now, against Netanyahu and former defense, Mr. Gallant, who Netanyahu himself had fired two weeks ago, there is an expectation in 
 
 Israel that it could lead to two things.
 <br>[13:05:00]
 
Number one, potentially more arrest warrants for other people involved in the conduct of the war in Gaza. And number two, that phenomena we have 
 
 already seen in other countries, particularly, you know, in European countries and others of attempts to issue local arrest warrants against 
 
 Israelis involved in the war in Gaza, even regular soldiers, not necessarily high-ranking officers, will receive a boost from this decision 
 
 today.
 
So, this is a cause for great concern for Israel as a country, and also for many, many Israelis individually you can say, people in the military and 
 
 even people who, like I said, played rather minor roles in the war in Gaza. But now look at this news coming from the Hague and ask themselves, can I 
 
 travel for Europe -- to Europe in the coming years?
 
GOLODRYGA:  Yes, as we noted, there are more than 120 signatories to the ICC, the U.S. and Israel not being one of them. But just moments ago, the 
 
 Italian defense minister said that if Benjamin Netanyahu came to their country, they'd have to arrest him. France, Ireland, and Holland have also 
 
 said that they would be obligated to abide.
 
TIBON:  The U.K., of course.
 
GOLODRYGA:  And the U.K. by the ruling. So, talk about the response. We have the public statements made by Prime Minister Netanyahu. Yoav Gallant 
 
 also issued a tweet saying the ICC's outrageous decision will live in infamy. It places the State of Israel and the brutal terrorist organization 
 
 Hamas in the same equation. We have their responses, but what are you reporting and what are you hearing about what's being discussed within the 
 
 government now?
 
TIBON:  So, like you said, on the surface, Israel is speaking in one voice. You hear the leaders of the opposition, Yair Lapid and Benny Gantz, also 
 
 denouncing this decision, and former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett joining rather strongly against the ICC.
 
But the question is, what can Israel do now? And on the legal level, there is an option to appeal. Maybe Israel will try that, of course, by appealing 
 
 you give legitimacy to the decision. So, that's a big question, if you even want to go down that route, and the chances of success are not very high.
 
The other option that Israel will certainly try is to get the United States to apply a lot of pressure and pain on the ICC. And the United States is 
 
 not committed to the ICC. And we've already heard senators from both the Republican and the Democratic Party in the U.S. is threatening to put 
 
 sanctions on the ICC as an institution and on individuals who were involved in this decision, whether it's the prosecutor, Karim Khan, or the judges 
 
 and others.
 
But there is a question of whether that pressure will actually lead to a change in the result, which is the issue of these arrest warrants and the 
 
 fact that more than 120 countries are going to respect them. That's a big if. You would need the U.S. to exert a lot of pressure on the court itself, 
 
 and that could also backfire. The court could say, well, we are not going to let anything ruin our independence.
 
And the other option is that the U.S. would approach these countries individually and tell them, if you respect the decision of the court and 
 
 you go along with respecting these arrest warrants, there will be consequences to your relationship with the United States. And then, what 
 
 would happen is that the ICC, as an institution, would no longer be relevant because if the arrest warrant for Netanyahu is not being honored 
 
 in France, for example, then the arrest warrant against Vladimir Putin, which was issued a year and a half ago, could not be valid in a different 
 
 country that wants closer relations -- closer relationship with Russia.
 
And I have to remind you, the ICC is also conducting investigations right now regarding Venezuela, Sudan. So, this is a very complicated situation. 
 
 And whatever, you know, happens next, it's not going to be an easy solution out of this for Israel. Even if you see massive American pressure, it could 
 
 take time to have an impact and it will have its own consequences on other priorities of the United States.
 
GOLODRYGA:  Yes. And you mentioned Vladimir Putin traveling. I mean, he did recently, I believe, travel to Mongolia, which is a signatory to the ICC, 
 
 and he was not arrested.
 
TIBON:  Yes, yes.
 
GOLODRYGA:  But I get the point.
 
TIBON:  So, again, you know, this is part of the issue here. There's a big question that also has to do with the war in Ukraine, with this 
 
 investigation in Venezuela. And one option is, at the end of the road, this leads to the ICC completely losing its international standing. That is a 
 
 risk also for the court in issuing this arrest warrant.
 <br>[13:10:00]
 
GOLODRYGA:  Well, and the point that you're making here also what differentiates Israel from, let's say, Russia or Venezuela, I mean, Russia 
 
 is a democracy by name only, whereas Israel is a democracy which has its own substantive legal and independent judicial system, which had been one 
 
 of the arguments that both Israel and the United States had been making against these charges and arrest warrants. And yet, that wasn't enough to 
 
 have the ICC come up with a different solution. These arrest warrants have now been made public.
 
What does Israel -- what are their legal options in terms of just appealing it? I mean, could Israel then -- because the -- I believe the attorney 
 
 general himself warned the government of this summer and there had been pressure on an internal investigation within Israel too.
 
TIBON:  Yes. So, the debate here in Israel, before this news broke out for several months, revolved around the question of how does Israel actually 
 
 investigate the war in Gaza to prove to the ICC, and by the way, also the ICJ, the International Court of Justice, in the Hague that there is no need 
 
 for them to intervene because any reports of potential war crimes are being investigated very seriously within our system.
 
And while the urgency of this was presented to the government by our attorney general and by the head legal officer of our military, you didn't 
 
 really see action, at the end of the day, to try to convince the world that actually these things were being taken very seriously inside Israel.
 
And you can see, for example, the example that happened, I think, in March, when you had seven workers of the World Central Kitchen organization killed 
 
 in Gaza accidentally by the IDF. And back then, because most of them were foreign nationals, including, I believe, a British citizen, Australian 
 
 citizen, and there was a lot of pressure from the United States, Israel immediately took action, two officers who were involved in this incident 
 
 were removed from the IDF, there was a serious investigation, and that was a case that showed what Israel could do in order to try to push away 
 
 pressure or criticism around its conduct.
 
The attorney general was really pleading with the government to do much more on that front and to give many more examples like that and to set up a 
 
 National Commission of Inquiry into the October 7 failure, but also into the conduct of the war, there was a lot of debate about it, and eventually 
 
 it never happened. So, I think the attorney general will have a bit of a told you so moment in front of the government, but it doesn't really matter 
 
 at this point because the damage has been done.
 
GOLODRYGA:  You know, earlier this year, following the announcement of the -- Karim Khan seeking these warrants, both Israel and the United States had 
 
 criticized the ICC for, among other reasons, stating that Israel had invited the ICC prosecutor and his staff to visit Israel for meetings with 
 
 officials about these very concerns and that that ultimately didn't result, that didn't happen.
 
Is there a legitimacy in this? What could they have possibly convinced him of otherwise?
 
TIBON:  So, it's interesting, Bianna, because Karim Khan, the prosecutor, actually visited Israel in the beginning of the war, shortly after October 
 
 7th, and I even interviewed him at the time. He met the families of Israeli hostages, kidnapped and held by Hamas. He visited some of the communities 
 
 that were destroyed by Hamas terrorists on October 7th, and I got to interview him for Haaretz and ask him what he saw and what he thought about 
 
 the situation. And he said very clearly that he thinks Hamas, let's say, very likely had committed crimes against humanity.
 
And I can tell you people in the Israeli government we're very positively surprised at the time by his approach during that visit. I believe it was 
 
 in November or December. And there was a sense that this was unprecedented, because Israel does not work with the ICC. And his visit was not official, 
 
 but it was with the knowledge and blessing of the Israeli government because they wanted him to see with his own eyes.
 
Now, what he would later say is that he also asked for arrest warrants against three leaders of Hamas, and therefore, he did take into 
 
 consideration what he saw on the ground in Israel, but Israel completely rejected the equivalence he was making here, trying to compare terrorists 
 
 like Sinwar and Mohammed Deif to the elected leaders of a democratic country. And that was really what it's all about.
 
I think there was a sense here that the prosecutor decided to put the two sides on an equal standing, which is something that Israel and the United 
 
 States completely rejected. And I think, by the way, many other countries also reject.
 <br>[13:15:00]
 
But once the arrest warrants are official, many of those countries will still have to respect them. I think I saw earlier a comment by the Austrian 
 
 foreign minister who criticized the prosecutor and the ICC for issuing these warrants, called them absurd, but at the same time said that his 
 
 country is going to respect international law because there are other interests involved, especially with the Russian case open and situation in 
 
 Ukraine.
 
GOLODRYGA:  Amir, there is a sense that this will now cause a sort of rally around the flag or in this case, a rally around Netanyahu internally for 
 
 increased support among Israelis following this decision by the ICC. Dahlia Scheindlin, who is an Israeli expert, an international public opinion, told 
 
 the guardian this, she said, it will strengthen Netanyahu. Israelis are absolutely rock solid, convinced that the international system in general 
 
 basically exists in order to target and single out Israel unfairly. That kind of sentiment cuts across the board in the Jewish community.
 
Do you agree with that sentiment?
 
TIBON:  I think in the short-term, definitely will. And it makes sense. I mean, I'm -- I've been a very strong critic of his, but I don't want him to 
 
 be arrested going to Italy. I mean, this is -- you know, this is not something that has to do with our own internal politics, that a lot of 
 
 Israelis look at this and say, OK, this is part of a broader attempt to, like you said, single out Israel as a country. So, that's -- I think there 
 
 will be some kind of a short-term impact.
 
But I think after that kind of cools down, there will also be a lot of hard questions about how did we get here and did certain statements, certain 
 
 decisions by our own politicians, especially the more far-right elements of this government contribute to this international attack, you can say, on 
 
 Israeli legitimacy. And there will be hard questions about the warnings from the attorney general and how they were treated by the government.
 
And in general, I think every Israeli is going to ask, how can -- a year after October 7, the biggest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust, and 
 
 after the first few weeks when the whole world really stood up to support Israel and we had just an air train off world leaders coming here all the 
 
 time, how did we get to a place where today we are so isolated?
 
GOLODRYGA:  It's a story we will continue to cover. Amir Tibon, thank you so much for joining the program. Good to see you.
 
TIBON:  Thank you for having me.
 
GOLODRYGA:  Well, as mentioned earlier, all 124 member states of the ICC are now legally obliged to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
 
 and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant if they set foot in their territory. But whether or not they will enforce it is another thing.
 
Vice president of the European Commission, Josep Borrell, says the ruling are not political and must be respected and implemented. Although the U.S. 
 
 is not a signatory, it has been previously welcomed the court's arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin over atrocities committed in 
 
 Ukraine.
 
Yet today, the White House National Security Council says that it fundamentally rejects the body's decision and will be discussing next steps 
 
 with their partners, including Israel. So, how much power does the ICC have? What are the legal ramifications here? David Scheffer is a former 
 
 U.S. Ambassador at Large for War Crimes and Issues, and he joins me from Washington, D.C. David, welcome to the program. First of all, your take on 
 
 this ruling. Are you surprised at all?
 
DAVID SCHEFFER, SENIOR FELLOW, COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS AND FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR-AT-LARGE FOR WAR CRIMES ISSUES:  Thank you very much, Bianna. I 
 
 am not surprised. However, I would've preferred to have seen this unfold somewhat differently from the court. The judges had the opportunity to take 
 
 a very a very thorough look, and they did look at the procedure by which this unfolded. And I think that's where the crux of the matter is for the 
 
 moment.
 
They decided that the arrest warrants should go ahead and be issued. Whereas under the Rome Statute there's something called Article 18, which 
 
 frankly, when I was negotiating the Rome Statute for the United States in the 1990s, I actually drafted Article 18 and got everyone to accept it, 
 
 which is you alert a country which is under scrutiny that they are being investigated and you give them at least a six-month period in which the ICC 
 
 backs off and the country demonstrates that it's taking it seriously and doing its duty under domestic criminal law to look at these types of 
 
 charges.
 
The problem with this case is that just putting the nature of the atrocity crimes aside for a moment or the alleged ones, that kind of notice was not 
 
 given to Israel. Why? Because an earlier notice in 2021 had been given to Israel when the court started to look at the situation in the West Bank. 
 
 And the prosecutor decided, well, you only get one shot at such a notice.
 <br>[13:20:00]
 
I think because of the character of what happened on October 7th, and the answer to that, in the right of self-defense by Israel, to respond to what 
 
 happened on October 7, 2023, that it would have been a reasonable exercise of the prosecutor's discretion to issue a new notice to Israel saying, OK, 
 
 this is serious stuff. This is a whole new background in the region. I'm investigating it afresh. I'm giving you my Article 18 notice. What is your 
 
 response?
 
And that goes to what your first guest really said, which I thought was so helpful, which is the attorney general's warning that, hey, we need to look 
 
 at this ourselves and prove to everyone that we're doing it ourselves as opposed to delaying it.
 
So, I just think it's important for me to point out that procedural issue that I do think there was some slippage in the court's reasoning in issuing 
 
 these arrest warrants, that's aside from the actual character of the alleged crimes.
 
GOLODRYGA:  And is it under the prosecutor's discretion as to how many notices they can give a particular country for actions that they commit? As 
 
 you note that this involved two -- 
 
SCHEFFER:  Yes.
 
GOLODRYGA:  -- one was the West Bank and obviously, this is the war in Gaza following October 7th?
 
SCHEFFER:  You know, it's -- you kind of have to apply a common law notion to the jurisprudence of the ICC. We didn't negotiate that back in the 1990s 
 
 as to how many takes he has or she has to launch an Article 18 notification. We actually didn't decide that. But I think we did give the 
 
 prosecutor discretion and I do think that the proper discretion would have been in May, give -- or even earlier, give Israel that kind of notification 
 
 and at least procedurally enable Israel to position itself with respect to what the prosecutor was investigating.
 
GOLODRYGA:  And once again, to just remind our viewers of the alleged crimes here, it is both warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant's for crimes 
 
 they allegedly committed against humanity during the Israeli offensive in the Gaza Strip, including the use of starvation as a weapon and directing 
 
 attacks against civilians. The court said it didn't find grounds for bringing a charge of extermination. And the full contents of the arrest 
 
 warrants are classified as secret.
 
It's interesting that not only did the United States condemn these arrest warrants, one of the issues in that condemnation was they view a process 
 
 error leading to this decision. Do you know what that process error would be?
 
SCHEFFER:  Yes, exactly what I just described. The United States issued an amicus brief to the court, and as did many governments and parties. The 
 
 judges invited a whole slew of friend of the court briefs during the summer. Israel submitted a brief, the United States has submitted a brief, 
 
 and many of those briefs pointed to the lack of full implementation of Article 18 as it should have been properly interpreted.
 
GOLODRYGA:  OK.
 
SCHEFFER:  So, that's a process issue.
 
GOLODRYGA:  OK. OK. You have said in response to these arrest warrants that the travel itineraries of both Prime Minister Netanyahu and Former Defense 
 
 Minister Gallant will be greatly circumscribed. Do you really envision a scenario where they would be arrested among allied members in countries?
 
SCHEFFER:  You know, I have to say I can envision it. I think we need to take seriously, here in the United States. We need to take seriously that 
 
 those European, Latin American, you know, some of the Pacific nations, which are party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, 
 
 actually take their responsibilities very seriously. Their publics expect them to do so.
 
So, I don't think one should sit here and say, oh, well, if he landed in Italy, how could Italy possibly arrest him? I can envision that happening. 
 
 And so, I think that needs to be taken very seriously by the Israeli officials.
 
GOLODRYGA:  The significance, in your view, of these warrants coming to heads of states of a democratic country?
 
SCHEFFER:  Yes. Well, that's the great issue, isn't it? And that's why Article 18 actually exists. Because if you're a democratic country like 
 
 Israel with a superb judiciary, a great Supreme Court, you can easily respond to such a notification that, you know, some of your leaders are 
 
 being investigated by saying, you know, back off. You know who we are. We're going to do our job and we're going to demonstrate to you that we do 
 
 our job under our national criminal law, et cetera, to demonstrate this.
 <br>[13:25:00]
 
And so, democratic governments can do that. The United States can surely do that if we fall into any particular situation where our military actions on 
 
 the territory of a state party to the court are called into question, we too can, you know, point to what we call under the Rome Statute 
 
 complementarity, that we have the capability to do this. And we're going to demonstrate to you that we're a rule of law, democratic nation, and we know 
 
 what we're doing to ensure that there's no impunity for the commission of genocide, war crimes, or crimes against humanity.
 
GOLODRYGA:  So, when Prosecutor Khan, as he said to Christiane back in May, says no one is above the law as it relates to the request for these 
 
 warrants that he was seeking back at that time, your response is what?
 
SCHEFFER:  Yes, that there's -- there is no such immunity from it. There's no -- I mean, they are within -- I mean, Khan is speaking from a point of 
 
 view of he's got the jurisdiction to issue or seek the issuance of these arrest warrants. Israel, of course, disagrees with that because they don't 
 
 think they have -- the ICC has any jurisdiction over a nonparty state.
 
The problem here is that the Gaza war is on the territory of a state party, the State of Palestine, as recognized as such by the court and by, you 
 
 know, more than 140 countries, the State of Palestine. And so, therefore, he can, I think with considerable confidence, consider the actions of the 
 
 Israeli Defense Forces in Gaza and thus reach a decision that certain arrest warrants are merited with respect to that conduct. He has that 
 
 authority and discretion as he interprets it.
 
GOLODRYGA:  And now, the question is, what, if anything, will the United States do? Obviously, we had President Biden, and we read the statement 
 
 from his administration condemning these arrest warrants, and President Biden had done so earlier. But we're now seeing Republicans, and they will 
 
 have control of the Senate, and there's an incoming Republican administration who are saying, let's take this a step further and actually 
 
 threaten sanctions against the ICC. Is that something you would support?
 
SCHEFFER:  I would express extreme caution about that. And the reason is this, first, back in the early 2000s, under the George W. Bush 
 
 administration, the law, the American Servicemembers' Protection Act was adopted, which had all sorts of sanctions against countries that even dare 
 
 to join the ICC. We found that in our relationships with those countries that was so damaging to our own national security interests that those 
 
 sanctions were lifted under the law. There are no longer any economic or military sanctions under that particular law because it was determined it's 
 
 simply a losing proposition for the United States and all of its many security equities and economic equities that it has around the world.
 
In this case, if there are sanctions, let's say, you know, just as was earlier, you know, years ago against the prosecutor, Bensouda, at the time 
 
 of the ICC. The problem with doing targeted sanctions like that against individuals, for example, is that so many governments, which the United 
 
 States is allied to, is a friend to, they will oppose those sanctions and it complicates our interests with those countries. It's a sort of 
 
 superfluous unnecessary irritant in the relations between the United States and so many countries around the world, which are party to the Rome Statute 
 
 of the United -- of the International Criminal Court. So, you have to be extremely careful. What is -- you have to determine, well, what do we gain 
 
 ultimately?
 
GOLODRYGA:  Yes, and that is the point that Amir Tibon was making earlier in our conversation as well.
 
SCHEFFER:  Yes.
 
GOLODRYGA:  David Scheffer, thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for expertise. We really appreciate it.
 
SCHEFFER:  Thank you.
 
GOLODRYGA:  Well, meantime, the bloodshed in Gaza continues with no end in sight. Israeli strikes in Northern and Central Gaza have killed at least 87 
 
 Palestinians in the last 24 hours. The death toll in the enclave now surpassing 44,000 according to the health ministry there. This after the 
 
 U.S. blocked the latest U.N. draft ceasefire resolution earlier this week, saying that it does not tie an immediate ceasefire to a hostage deal.
 <br>[13:30:00]
 
Joining me for more is former war correspondent Arwa Damon, who is on the ground with her charity, INARA, providing critically needed food and 
 
 medicine to children.
 
Arwa, great to see you. Great to have you on the ground there. And as we noted in the introduction, no real end in sight to this conflict. Barak 
 
 Ravid from Axios says that Israel sent a letter to the U.S. administration saying that they have no intention of starving Palestinians or of 
 
 implementing the controversial so-called Generals Plan in the north. Walk us through the humanitarian situation and what you are seeing there in your 
 
 current visit.
 
ARWA DAMON, PRESIDENT AND FOUNDER, INARA:  Look, this is my fourth time back in Gaza since this all began, and each time I leave, I think that it 
 
 quite possibly could not get worse and yet, it somehow does. And the sense really is that Israel, from the onset, has been saying that its intention 
 
 is not to collectively punish the population or to starve the population or to kill civilians and yet, that is exactly what we see happening on the 
 
 ground.
 
We're in a situation right now where the humanitarian sector in and of itself is on life support. And look, we're not going to put our tools down 
 
 on our own, but we might end up forced into that position quite simply because we're not going to have any tools left. We're not going to have 
 
 anything left to be able to offer the population here.
 
The U.N. actually sent a letter to COGAT highlighting that insecurity, the lack of supplies, and the impact of Israeli strikes on certain locations 
 
 right after humanitarian missions have carried out activities. There are dropped off supplies are severely damaging and is strongly urging, you 
 
 know, Israel to take this very seriously, but it's not -- you know, no one's really all that optimistic that it's going to make that much of a 
 
 difference, because where do I start to even begin to try to describe this situation if we take even the simplest thing?
 
You know, school books for children, notebooks and pencils. You think that that would be easily brought into Gaza so that we can provide kids with at 
 
 least basic supplies in these makeshift tents that they're attending, you know, classes in, but we can't. Bringing in a notebook and a pencil is 
 
 extraordinarily difficult. Bringing in tarps or even finding tarps in Gaza to be able to provide extra protection against the rains that we're all 
 
 expecting to have coming is extraordinarily difficult and very, very hard to find.
 
And speaking of the rain, we're expecting flooding to happen when the rains do come. And a lot of these, you know, makeshift tented areas in these 
 
 camps that have cropped up are in low lying areas. So, they're going to get flooded. Only they're not going to just be flooded with rainwater, they're 
 
 going to be flooded with sewage and waste.
 
And we've been asking the Israelis and locating different alternative sites that, you know, sewage and waste could potentially be moved to, but all of 
 
 those sites get rejected. There are water wells in Gaza City that could potentially be brought back online. But, you know, organizations are unable 
 
 to do that because the well also happens to feed an area like Jabalya, which Israel has effectively been besieging, a siege within a siege, and 
 
 bombing very, very intensely.
 
I mean, I could go on and on and list all of the examples of just how Israel is crippling humanitarian operations here. And one of the big 
 
 concerns, which I'm sure, you know, you and a lot of our viewers may have been hearing a lot of organizations talking about is the looting that has 
 
 been happening.
 
GOLODRYGA:  Yes.
 
DAMON:  It's very important to point out here that this looting takes place in areas that have been under evacuation order that Israel fully controls, 
 
 and we have repeatedly been asking for alternative and safe routes.
 
GOLODRYGA:  Nearly 100 trucks, we should note, carrying food for Palestinians were violently looted just this past weekend after entering 
 
 Gaza. It was one of the worst aid losses in 13 months of the war in the enclave. Did you witness any of this? I mean, I would love to hear from you 
 
 and that you documented so well and in such detail on your Instagram account and on social media, just the relationships that you've built with 
 
 people there on the ground, the connections that you've made, what they are telling you. Can you give us a bit more anecdotally and personally what 
 
 you've experienced from speaking with people?
 
DAMON:  There's a lot of frustration. There's a lot of anger. There's a lot of desperation. And you see this in the adults and you also see this in the 
 
 children. You know, yesterday was World Children's Day. Thursday was World Children's Day. And we had this big event at one of the camps. And we had 
 
 clowns and jugglers and people entertaining the kids. And it was there that you really began to sort of see the way that some of the trauma was 
 
 manifesting itself, especially among the children, because some of them just weren't interacting at all.
 <br>[13:35:00]
 
And you look at them, and it's like, you know, they're there, but their mind is somewhere else. Their eyes are blank. And no matter how the clowns 
 
 would try to draw them out, they just couldn't. And then, you also hear, you know, the children's laughter, some of the other ones, and it just 
 
 sounds like pure magic. And this one mother came up to me and she said, you know, my son, he's just -- he hasn't been the same since two of his 
 
 siblings were killed and he doesn't want to engage because he keeps wanting his two siblings to be there with him and he keeps asking me, you know, 
 
 where are they and why did they have to go?
 
Earlier I was at one of these makeshift learning sites that were supporting and one of the mothers there came up and said, you know, my son is not able 
 
 to join these classes because he is completely withdrawn after everything that he has witnessed and whenever he has to leave the tent, he starts to 
 
 panic because he tells me that even though he knows the tent isn't safe, he believes that outside is even less safe.
 
And when we talk about -- you know, you were mentioning the looting there on the 100 aid trucks, it's important to point out that, you know, the 
 
 population here is very aware of these criminal elements that, you know, are looting the aid. And there is this sense, especially if we look at 
 
 where that aid is being looted, that it's, again, happening in these areas that were under evacuation order by Israel. So, it's areas that are fully, 
 
 you know, hypothetically speaking, under Israeli military control. And there is a lot of evidence that is pointing to the fact that these aid 
 
 trucks that were looted have ended up in warehouses in areas under Israeli control.
 
And so, there's a lot of questions being asked as to, you know, why is Israel allowing this looting to happen? There's a complete and total 
 
 breakdown of any form of rule of law. There have been attempts by aid organizations to use the police force to secure sections of these routes, 
 
 but they've actually been bombed.
 
And, you know, people come up to you and they say, you know, we're hungry. Do you have anything to give us? You know, I need diapers. I need this. I 
 
 need that. And there's nothing that we can offer.
 
GOLODRYGA:  Yes. You mentioned how hard it is just to even bring school supplies into the enclave. And as you mentioned that the weather is only 
 
 going to get more dire now as rains are expected and we're just weeks away from cold temperatures -- colder temperatures as well. Arwa Damon, as 
 
 always, thank you for the work that you continue to do and the stories you continue to bring us. We appreciate it.
 
Well, Donald Trump's return to the White House comes at a divisive time in American society and politics. Back in the '80s, Pulitzer Prize winning 
 
 columnist and author Peggy Noonan was President Ronald Reagan's speechwriter, and she reflects on how the nation has evolved, in her new 
 
 book, "A Certain Idea of America." And she joins Walter Isaacson to discuss.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
WALTER ISAACSON, CO-HOST, AMANPOUR AND CO.:  Thank you, Bianna. And Peggy Noonan, welcome to the show.
 
PEGGY NOONAN, AUTHOR, "A CERTAIN IDEA OF AMERICA" AND OPINION COLUMNIST, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Thank you, Walter. It's wonderful to be here.
 
ISAACSON:  This collection of columns reminds me how when you're writing your columns, you're almost thinking out loud, talking to yourself, talking 
 
 to us, and then processing information. You take it step by step through it. So, let me understand. How are you processing the current moment in the 
 
 current election?
 
NOONAN:  I am processing the current moment as in Mar-a-Lago, the new incoming president is surrounded by people who are afraid to leave his line 
 
 of sight. And so, they are staying all around him and giving some sort of physical sense of the new administration. And it's an interesting picture.
 
In a different way, I think it's very funny, but sometimes White Houses or incoming White Houses are not quite conscious of the fact that they can do 
 
 something that is disturbing to people. Here's what it is. It's like they've got a chef's kitchen and a chef's stove and they've got eight 
 
 burners and they decide to put eight pots on each burner and put them up to full boil and steam the windows and give a sense of holy mackerel, what the 
 
 heck is happening here? If I were to give them advice or they asked for advice, I'd say, gosh, with these cabinet appointments and these 
 
 pronouncements, lower the heat.
 <br>[13:40:00]
 
America's just been through a dramatic election. What it would love to do, love to feel, and what would be very good for Mr. Trump, is to make them 
 
 feel reassured, that mature, non-dramatic people are in charge.
 
ISAACSON:  Wait, wait. Reassure that mature, non-dramatic people are in charge? I mean, Trump is based on drama. That's his entire persona. You're 
 
 asking him to be something totally different?
 
NOONAN:  Well, I am asking them to be shrewdly self-disciplined for once, and that's not too much to ask.
 
ISAACSON:  You know, you with Reagan, you did all of his great speeches. Compare and contrast Ronald Reagan and his rhetoric, which -- a lot of 
 
 which you helped him write, to Donald Trump's rhetoric.
 
NOONAN:  Well, Ronald Reagan was a man who loved words and their concrete meaning and their ability to suggest. So, both sides of what a word is, 
 
 what a sentence is. He had then, something that Reagan had that Trump does not have, is that Reagan, since the 1960s, actually -- meaning 20 years 
 
 before he was president, was seriously emerging as the conservative voice of the brand-new conservative movement in America.
 
So, he knew his stuff. He knew what he wanted to say. He knew what quote from the founders he wanted to use. You well know, Donald Trump, of course, 
 
 has been none of that and has done none of that. He is a man with a completely different background who now and then showed an interest in 
 
 politics and now and then would go make a speech, but he was not the voice of a real philosophical thing.
 
And mostly his sound. I mean, you have to give credit where it's due, his sound is utterly genuine to him. He doesn't try to hide much in a way, you 
 
 know, he tells you, this is what I'm going to do. This is why. We'll figure out the details later, but this is what we're doing. He has more the blunt 
 
 and perhaps uncontexted sound of modern America.
 
ISAACSON:  The book is called "A Certain Idea of America." Great title and sort of derived from Charles de Gaulle. Explain why.
 
NOONAN:  Decades ago, I read Charles de Gaulle's "War Memoirs" and I found it a little masterpiece, actually, not quite in the league of U.S. Grant's 
 
 "War Memoirs" but an impressive book from a deeply impressive man who had an almost mystical -- I think a mystical attachment with his nation, with 
 
 his country and its meaning and history.
 
And what struck me when I read the famous first sentence of his memoir is, all of my life, I've had a certain idea of France. It was so simple. And he 
 
 explained that it was in one part emotional, and in one part based on rational thought. And I will never forget seeing that sentence and 
 
 thinking, do you know that's -- not to compare myself to De Gaulle, of course, which I don't, but that was true of me also.
 
All of my life, I've had a certain idea of America of it's for all its problems, all its flaws, all its failures it was a good nation, a unique 
 
 force in the world, a new thing in the history of man based on a new thought, all people are equal here under the law, and wherever you start 
 
 does not dictate where you will wind up.
 
And to me, this is not a benign -- a gauzy feeling about America, this is a truthful, factual feeling about America. And I do think -- not to go too 
 
 long here, I think the balance of our national conversation about our country has, in the past 10 years, skewed more towards the painfully 
 
 shamed. And I just think, whoa, guys, we got to reorder this a little bit. We got to rebalance here. I feel very protective about America.
 
ISAACSON:  And the America that you've talked about, the America that Ronald Reagan spoke about was fundamentally optimistic the morning in 
 
 America feel. And you've just said that America now kind of feel shamed, there's almost a dystopian vision, and that's everything is going wrong.
 <br>[13:45:00]
 
NOONAN:  Yes.
 
ISAACSON:  Explain. Yes. Unpack that.
 
NOONAN:  Well, I'll tell you what one of my great worries is. There are a lot of families in America that don't work and are not so successfully 
 
 bringing up kids with order and love, this has always been true in America. We're an America of displaced people, always pushing off somewhere else. 
 
 And we've had interesting parenting styles.
 
But when I was a kid in America in the '50s and '60s, coming from a somewhat turbulent family, I always was allowed to have the feeling, 
 
 Walter, that what is in the family is this, but when I open the front door, I go into America, and it's a good place and it won't be unkind to you 
 
 based on your sex or your race. It will be accepting of you, and good to you.
 
What I fear is that, in the past, I don't know how long, 10 or 20 years, we have left kids from turbulent homes thinking, I am not safe here. And guess 
 
 what? I just opened the front door to go out, and I'm not safe there either. It's a rather wicked place.
 
This is actually something that has been on my mind as a working writer for decades. And I feel we're selling those poor kids short and we've got to 
 
 give them a different vision so that they understand they can have a chance here and they can rise here and they can be accepted here and they can be 
 
 part of this big project that we have. So, that has been very much on my mind.
 
ISAACSON:  You've written often about the need, specifically, to teach as a culture, we need to learn how to teach again how young boys should fit in 
 
 and young boys should live. Why are you particularly worried about young boys other than the fact that you have a son and now a new grandson?
 
NOONAN:  Because boys need masculine models. IN some special way, boys need to be taught through the modeling of others how to be a boy and how to be a 
 
 man and what the masculine virtues are and how to be a gentleman and how to be kindly and strong at the same time. This too has been a matter of real 
 
 concern to me. And I feel like we're getting it wrong a bit, and I don't like it that we make -- sometimes these days, boys feel like they're 
 
 nothing, they have no special place, they've lost their place, and it disturbs me.
 
ISAACSON:  We've done that to women for centuries. Isn't this just about a rebalancing?
 
NOONAN:  Yes. It is about a sensitivity. Can't you help everybody at the same time? Do you have to really help the girls at the expense of the boys 
 
 or the women at the expense of the men? We can do it all. We shouldn't ever be categorizing and defining and limiting people by what they were born as. 
 
 It's not good.
 
ISAACSON:  One of the other things you say in the book is you talk to some traditional Republicans, even during the tumultuous first term of Donald 
 
 Trump, and they were looking to sort of the post-Trump era. We get back to real conservatives. I think you said that Reagan's old conservatism was 
 
 philosophically right, but it's not fully in line with the crises of our times. Why is that?
 
NOONAN:  Yes. You know, I'm a little impatient with the what would Reagan do? What would Reagan say? These policies are not Reagan-esque. Look, if 
 
 it's 1962 and John F. Kennedy is president, people around him should not be running around and saying he's doing things different from FDR. FDR's age 
 
 and the immediate political demands of his age were different from John F. Kennedy's. Donald Trump's age and issues are different from Ronald 
 
 Reagan's.
 <br>[13:50:00]
 
I am not really -- I'm not a fan of, OK, philosophically, we've worked out where we stand on this issue, and we will stand there unvaryingly forever, 
 
 no matter what the reality outside. Ronald Reagan -- to give you one example of a difference is that Ronald Reagan, in 1980, was dealing with an 
 
 essentially -- and addressing an essentially healthy country, healthy in its ways and ways of living, I guess. Donald Trump's America is a very 
 
 different America in which people are very disturbed and tormented by a lack of particular kinds of jobs by drugs, by families that seem to cohere 
 
 less.
 
So, you know, as -- what did Lincoln say, as our times are new, we must think anew. I have no problem with thinking anew. But certainly, keep your 
 
 kind of -- whatever kind of conservative you are, Berkian or whatever, keep that present and applicable, because philosophies matter the grounding for 
 
 everything.
 
ISAACSON:  One of the things that echoes through your book is COVID because you've written about it, from the very beginning, early on in COVID, you 
 
 were writing about it. I have a theory about COVID, which is that it turned into a class divide, and there was certain class of people, usually the 
 
 working class people, who had to go to work and were appalled by all the lockdowns and the restrictions. And then, there was sort of an overclass, a 
 
 meritocratic class who said, follow the science. And that divide became a political divide as well that was reflected in this election.
 
NOONAN:  Yes, I think it became a political divide, but also reflected and underlined a political divide that had already been happening. I wrote 
 
 about this somewhat in some very controversial columns. You know, in one I said, and I actually just think this, working class folk who have tough 
 
 lives and have to stock the shop right and drive the truck, they can be pretty tough about life, you know? In part, because they probably came from 
 
 a certain amount of toughness.
 
So, they see this terrible germ coming and they know it's trouble and they're wearing the mask, but they're also seeing the lap top class, that's 
 
 me and you, staying home and, what, being detached from their real lives and detached from their need to simply live their lives, and I think maybe 
 
 detached from a certain commonsense and attached too much to this sort of, we know the science, we're the superior folk stuff, and I thought it was 
 
 painful and I didn't like it. And yes, we're still working it out.
 
I think part of the story of the 2024 election, I've never seen it reflected in a poll, it's only my hunch, is that the American people, a lot 
 
 of them wanted to say, to look at the years 2020, 2024 and say goodbye to all that. Goodbye. We're going to reorder things.
 
ISAACSON:  One of the toughest columns in your book is right after the January 6th attack on Capitol Hill. And you called it a sin against 
 
 history, and you said that Trump was the chief instigator of it, and you said he should be removed from office.
 
NOONAN:  Yes. Whichever comes first, yes.
 
ISAACSON:  After all this, how are we supposed to now make of January 6th and the fact that it rebounded?
 
NOONAN:  Look, I know what I think of January 6th, it was a terrible sin against history, and an American president ginned up these angry young guys 
 
 and said to them, oh, I'll meet you at the Capitol. Oh, we'll catch up with the bad guys there. It was deliberate and mischievous to the point of 
 
 malice, and then as the story played out on our airwaves, on the internet, and on cable TV live, he sat and watched it. It was grossly irresponsible, 
 
 just grossly so.
 
Now, if I were a Trump supporter, I'd say, can you guys relax about this? It was a thousand guys in a nation of 335 million. They weren't all armed 
 
 with guns and looking to shoot somebody, they were acting out and acting up, and the law came down on them. Man, the book was thrown at them. They 
 
 all went to jail. Relax, there are bigger problems. So, that is the answer I often get.
 <br>[13:55:00]
 
ISAACSON:  And which do you believe?
 
NOONAN:  Mine. I'm sorry. You cannot do January 6th. You just can't.
 
ISAACSON:  You're fundamentally optimistic in this book, in the speeches you wrote, other things. What is making you, if anything, optimistic these 
 
 days?
 
NOONAN:  Oh, optimistic. I have faith. I think always prepare for a bad time, but live through each day in a happy way. You're lucky to be here. 
 
 Just lucky to be here. Lucky to be alive. So, enjoy this thing that we have. Have faith in other people. I meet Americans throughout America on my 
 
 travels. They are such a good people. So, I worry about us a lot, but I love us a lot. And there you are.
 
ISAACSON:  Peggy Noonan, thank you for joining us.
 
NOONAN:  Thank you, Walter, very much. It was an honor.
