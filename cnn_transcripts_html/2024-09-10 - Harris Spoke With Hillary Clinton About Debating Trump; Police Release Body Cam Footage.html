BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: Vice President Kamala Harris is about to join a small club of women who have faced former President Donald Trump on a presidential debate stage. 
 
The other, of course, Hillary Clinton, which is why Harris spoke with Clinton over the phone this weekend. 
 
And while we don't know the details of their conversation, the source telling us this says that Clinton has expressed that baiting the former president is one of the best tactics the vice president could do tonight. 
 
Clinton has pointed to this exchange as one of the single lowest debate moments for Trump. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Eighteen hundred nuclear warheads and she's playing chicken. Look -- 
 
UNIDENTIFIED DEBATE MODERATOR: But what might --
 
TRUMP: -- from everything I see, has no respect for this person. 
 
HILLARY CLINTON, (D), FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, that's because he'd rather have a puppet as president. 
 
TRUMP: No puppet, no puppet.
 
CLINTON: And today -- it's pretty clear.
 
TRUMP: No puppet. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KEILAR: Joining us now is Robby Mook, who was Hillary Clinton's campaign manager in 2016. 
 
Robby, tell us how that moment came to be. ROBBY MOOK, FORMER CAMPAIGN MANAGER, HILLARY FOR AMERICA 2016: Well,
 
 as with any debate preparation process for most candidates, you -- the debate is all about a set of moments, right? And so you establish what moments you want to have, prepare for them, and you rehearse them.
 
And I think this has become even more important in debate preparation than ever before because the kinds of voters that are most likely to move in this election tend to get their news predominantly from social media.
 
And so there aren't going to be tuning in to watch this debate tonight live necessarily. But there'll be consuming it over social media. 
 
It's one of the things that's been interesting to me that Donald Trump refuses to rehearse in his debate preparation process because it's very hard to have moments like that unless you actually reverse. 
 <br>[14:35:03]
 
KEILAR: I mentioned our CNN reporting that Harris and Clinton spoke this weekend. Notable, I should mention, that this week, again, Clinton was asked in a "New York Times" interview about whether she had spoken with Harris about the debate. 
 
And I think you saw it, Robby, it was a total dodge. She acted as if she'd been asked another question. But of course, she's been speaking with Harris. It would be malpractice if she wasn't talking to her about the debate.
 
How essential is it that Harris has gotten Clinton's insight on this? 
 
MOOK: Yes, I think you want everybody's insight who's debated Trump? There's only two people who've done general election debates. I'm sure she's consulted with President Biden as well.
 
And look, it's hard -- it's hard to know when a campaign -- what it's really like to be up there on stage all the pressures on you. She has an A-plus team preparing her for this debate. People who've done this for Obama, for Clinton, provided it.
 
But there's nothing quite like being on that stage. And Hillary's the only woman who's debated him in a general election context. We know that Donald Trump does treat women differently.
 
So I think it's a really important perspective to get. 
 
I will also say I think the world has changed a lot in the last eight years. Donald Trump was president and then he was defeated. So this is a very different context than Hillary faced. But her input is still incredibly important. 
 
KEILAR: So looking back and knowing that, as you said, the world, of course, has changed, the political landscape has changed. But looking back with the benefit of experience of 2016, what is the best way for Harris to maximize her performance on the debate stage compared to Trump's? MOOK: Yes. Well, as I said earlier, this is in contrast to eight years
 
 ago. These viral moments, these little clips are so important now. And so she needs to make sure that, not just that she's ready to have these moments, but ready to have the right moments. 
 
She has to drive a contrast with him on looking out for the middle class. She has to surface that she has new economic ideas versus his old, tired, you know, in many cases, unrealistic ideas.
 
And on women's health care, there's a really important contrast for her to draw. So she needs to do all of that. 
 
I would say the thing that is still a problem, since 2016, right up until today, is that Donald Trump's bad behavior antics, racism, sexism is incredibly distracting. 
 
It's very easy to watch the debate and pay attention to those things rather than a really serious case that she or Biden or Hillary we're trying to make. 
 
And I think that is the hardest thing to do. Because even when you're -- when you're baiting him, which I'm sure she's going to try to bring him in to have some of those important contrasts moments. But if he -- if he behaves really badly, sometimes that can spoil it.
 
So it's important that she's going to have to be nimble and really try to break through his bad behavior to a send clear message. 
 
Because, unlike Biden and unlike Hillary, she is still relatively unknown to - you know, based on the polling, to say at least a third of the electorate. 
 
So we need to pay attention to them and make sure that they're learning something new. 
 
KEILAR: Yes, I mean, we all remember that "nasty woman" moment. It grabbed people's attention. But also what does it distract from, right? That's the big question. 
 
Robby, great to have your insights. Thank you so much. 
 
MOOK: Thanks.
 <br>[14:38:35]
 
KEILAR: So next, Miami Dolphins' wide receiver, Tyreek Hill, says he's still shell-shocked as police release body cam footage from his traffic stop. How it escalated so quickly, next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:43:22]
 
SANCHEZ: There are new details emerging about the brief detainment of Miami Dolphins wide receiver, Tyreek Hill. Police receiving -- releasing, rather, body cam video of the encounter showing some intense moments as the NFL star was dragged out of his car, taken to the ground and put in handcuffs. 
 
Watch this.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TYREEK HILL, MIAMI DOLPHINS WIDE RECEIVER: Don't knock on my window. Don't knock on my window.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
UNIDENTIFIED LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER: Why don't you have your seat belt on?
 
HILL: Don't knock on my window. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER: Why don't you have your seat belt on?
 
HILL: Don't knock on my window.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
UNIDENTIFIED LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER: Yo, hold up. (INAUDIBLE)
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
UNIDENTIFIED LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER: -- play games.
 
HILL: What you going to do?
 
UNIDENTIFIED LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER: Get out!
 
What part of (INAUDIBLE) do you not understand?
 
HILL: I'm getting arrested, Drew. I'm getting arrested. I'm getting arrested, Drew.
 
(SHOUTING) 
 
UNIDENTIFIED LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER: When we tell you to do something, you do it.
 
(SHOUTING)
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
UNIDENTIFIED LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER: You do what we tell you.
 
HILL: (EXPLETIVE DELETED)
 
(SHOUTING)
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SANCHEZ: Hill spoke about the incident last night with CNN's Kaitlan Collins. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HILL: I was shocked, man. Like, it's crazy because it all happened so fast, man. But like for me, man, like it just all happened so fast. And I really couldn't like gather everything that was happening. 
 <br>[14:45:04]
 
So it was crazy, you know. And me being a father, me being a husband and all that. And I was just put myself in that situation like, hey, I got to be smart, you know what I'm saying? That's where I really -- I wasn't on that kind of energy. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SANCHEZ: We want to break down everything in the video and with the ongoing investigation with Neill Franklin. He's a retired Maryland State police commander who spent more than three decades in law enforcement.
 
Sir, thank you so much for joining us. 
 
How do you assess how these officers handled the situation based on the video we saw?
 
NEILL FRANKLIN, RETIRED MARYLAND STATE POLICE COMMANDER: I can tell you for sure that the one officer definitely did not act within their training. 
 
One of the first things I want to say about the Miami-Dade Police Department is that they are CALEA certified. 
 
And what that means is that -- for those people who don't know what CALEA means, it's commission on accreditation of law enforcement agencies. It's like this national organization that takes a look, a keen look at policies of a police department and makes very strong recommendations for them.
 
Them, being certified by CALEA, I know for certain that they have a very good program in de-escalation. And that's what we did not see here by the officers that we're there.
 
If anything, we saw, escalation. And if you listen to the language that was being said when they we're trying to get him to sit down on a curb and he says he just had surgery on his knee. 
 
The other officer, the one officer responds saying something to the effect that, what a coincidence, did you just have surgery on your ears? You know, talking about, you know, him not listening to them right away.
 
This is appalling. This is one of the main problems we have in policing today is that police officers are not following their training. They're not using de-escalation techniques that they're trained in. 
 
And in this particular case, as I said before, they actually escalated this situation.
 
SANCHEZ: I'm curious to get your reaction to the south Florida police union describing Hill as uncooperative, saying that that's why he was put on the ground.
 
It's clear that he wasn't pleased with the way that police we're knocking on his window. And at one point, he seems to ignore an order to put the window down.
 
But it doesn't seem like that merits the physical response that we saw there, right? 
 
FRANKLIN: Right. Well, their job is to protect their officers at literally any cost. 
 
So here's the thing. The law does say that we can pull someone, have someone step out of their vehicle, extract someone from their vehicle, if we fear for our safety. That's case law. That supports that. 
 
However, they knew who he was. They had this driver's license. They knew who he was and where he was going to. There was absolutely no reasonable suspicion whatsoever to believe that their safety was at risk.
 
So for them to even have him step out of the car, in my hey opinion, and I've been a trainer -- one of my -- you know, when I was with the Maryland State Police in Baltimore City, that's what I did. I headed up both training divisions for both those agencies. 
 
And what they did was completely against training. And in my opinion, it did not follow case law for the reasoning they used to get him out of the car. Their safety was not a risk.
 
So that comment by the union, they're just trying to cover their officers. That's what they're paid to do. But, in my opinion, it's wrong.
 
SANCHEZ: Neill Franklin, thanks so much for sharing your analysis with us. 
 
FRANKLIN: You're welcome, Boris. 
 
SANCHEZ: Of course. 
 <br>[14:48:56]
 
Still ahead, mandatory evacuations in Louisiana as Tropical Storm Francine churns toward the coast. The expected path it's set to take when we come back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:53:15]
 
KEILAR: Mandatory evacuations are expanding across Louisiana as Tropical Storm Francine is charging toward the Gulf Coast. The storm could strengthen into a hurricane later today, and it is expected to make landfall morrow afternoon. 
 
This is a live look now at Galveston, Texas. Governor Greg Abbott warning people there to be prepared for heavy rain and also flooding. 
 
CNN Meteorologist Elisa Raffa is with us now. She's tracking the storm.
 
And Francine is shifting to the east, is that right? 
 
ELISA RAFFA, AMS METEOROLOGIST: Yes. With each update, it's getting nudged a little bit farther east and -- which means we're worried about the potential for some higher wind gusts in New Orleans. 
 
It's been lashing the Texas coast all day with some of these outer bands and some heavy rainfall rates at sometimes one to two inches per hour. 
 
The center eye of the storm has 65-miles-per-hour winds. It's still a tropical storm sitting about 400 miles south and west of Morgan City, Louisiana. And again, you can see some heavy rain already moving into Louisiana.
 
As we go -- as we have been through the day today, it's been fighting some of this dry air. So it wants to strengthen, but it's trying to beat out that dry air. 
 
We do have some incredibly warm ocean temperatures, which will give it a window to strengthen pretty quickly. And we are expecting a hurricane later on today. 
 
So we're looking at a landfall, possibly a category one, maybe edging on a category two, along the Louisiana coastline. That's where we have hurricane warnings in effect there in the red. 
 
And again, it's starting to nudge a little bit farther east where I'm worried about some higher wind gusts for places like New Orleans.
 
You can see, though, as we start tomorrow morning, already have some outer bands coming into Louisiana. Again, with some of the wind gusts picking up 20, 30, 40 miles per hour by the afternoon and evening. 
 <br>[14:54:59]
 
Here is that eye coming on shore. Look at some of these gusts, 95- miles-per-hour gusts possible for parts of central Louisiana, even New Orleans. Again, 50-, 60-mile-per-hour gusts. 
 
All of this continues to work its way inland as we go into Thursday, bringing with it some of that heavy rain.
 
When it comes to the wind, again, winds up to 74 to 110 miles per hour for a place like Morgan City. We find those tropical storm-force winds again stretching inland. Worried about New Orleans. Again, possibly seeing some of the higher wind gusts out of this, too.
 
Storm surge, five to 10 feet possible along the Louisiana coastline as that ocean water just pushes inland. And then you get the heavy rain as well. 
 
This footprint of heavy rain -- look how far north it stretches, up to the Missouri boot heel. We're really looking at a pretty widespread swath of four to eight inches of rain.
 
But especially for parts of Louisiana, we could find some totals approaching a foot. That would cause considerable flash flooding concerns. Something to watch through the day tomorrow -- Brianna? 
 
KEILAR: All right. We'll be watching.
 
Elisa, thank you so much for that. We appreciate it.
 
And next, we're headed live to Philadelphia where tonight's historic presidential debate will be taking place. Don't go anywhere.
