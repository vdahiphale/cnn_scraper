POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR:  All right, take a look. These are live pictures inside of Dulles International Airport in what is set to be, today, the busiest day to fly. TSA officials say they're expecting agents to screen about three million passengers. This comes as airlines recover after several days of severe weather upended thousands of flights across the country. 
 
Pete Muntean joins us live again this morning at Reagan National. Let's hope for a smooth day.
 
PETE MUNTEAN, CNN AVIATION CORRESPONDENT:  No doubt, Poppy. You know, things a lot smoother today than they were on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. 
 
I just checked Flight Aware about 200 cancellations -- that's what we're holding steady at -- right now across the U.S. One hundred fifty of those are United Airlines, which has canceled more flights than any other airline. Since Saturday, 3,200 cancellations, 7,200 delays. 
 
Even still, though, despite all of these problems the TSA says today will be the busiest day for air travel we have seen since the start of the pandemic. Two point eight two million expected to be screened here and at airports nationwide by the TSA. When you add it all up through the holiday -- through July 5 -- 17.7 million people in total. That's what the TSA is expecting.
 
But AAA takes it one step further. When you add in air travel, add in people traveling by train and by car, 50 million people traveling 50 miles or more between now and after the holiday. That is the biggest we have seen not since 2019, not since last year even though it's bigger than last year -- the biggest since 2005 when AAA started forecasting for the July Fourth holiday travel rush. 
 
Although there's a bit of a word of caution here from TSA -- or AAA, rather. They underscore here that you just have to plan for cancellations and delays -- listen.

ANDREW GROSS, AAA SPOKESMAN:  What you need to remember when you're flying is to be prepared. Expect delays, except cancellations. Get to the airport early. Have the app open on your phone so you're getting all those notifications from the airlines. 
 
Also, pay attention to the weather and pay -- and try and figure out where your plane is coming from because the weather may be great at your airport but maybe the plane is flying in from another city and it could be delayed due to bad weather there.

MUNTEAN:  United Airlines, in a news statement, says it will be fully recovered for this holiday travel rush, although it is saying it's grateful for all of the passengers who have been through so much lately.
 
The FAA, though, warning thunderstorms could throw a wrench into things later today in Miami and Denver, Atlanta -- some big hubs -- and they could see some ground stops -- Poppy, Phil.
 
PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN ANCHOR:  Hey, Pete, as part of my series of "Hey, Pete's A Pilot," this thing happened to a plane. I'd like to ask Pete about it. We showed -- we showed the nose of a Southwest plane that looked like a baseball bat had been taken to it. It was an apparent bird strike.
 
What can you tell us about that?
 
MUNTEAN:  You know, the good news here is that nobody was hurt and these almost always end, really, without much calamity. This flight -- Southwest flight from Las Vegas to Burbank hit a bird on final approach. You can see the Radome -- the nose cone -- of that 737 there crushed in a little bit. 
 
Not that big of a deal, though. There are 1,600 of these in the U.S. every year. Usually, it ends OK for the plane. It doesn't end so well for the bird. They call the leftovers snarge. That's the official term.
 
HARLOW:  Oh my gosh.
 
MATTINGLY:  See? That's why my daily series "Hey, Pete's A Pilot" -- something happened to a plane and I'm going to ask him about it is actually TV gold. 
 
HARLOW:  When we come back from vacation we're going to have a graphic and everything right here, Pete. Thank you.
 
MATTINGLY:  Thanks, buddy.
 
All right. Well, also this morning, trans influencer Dylan Mulvaney speaking publicly about the backlash that ensued after she featured Bud Light beers in two Instagram posts back in April. Mulvaney says the company never reached out to her after the onslaught of threats, bullying, and hate speech.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DYLAN MULVANEY, SOCIAL MEDIA INFLUENCER:  I was waiting for the brand to reach out to me but they never did. And for months now, I've been scared to leave my house. I have been ridiculed in public. I have been followed. And I have felt a loneliness that I wouldn't wish on anyone.
 
For a company to hire a trans person and then not publicly stand by them is worse, in my opinion, than not hiring a trans person at all.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MATTINGLY:  Now, in a statement to The New York Times, a spokesperson for Bud Light said, quote, "As we've said, we remain committed to programs and partnerships we have forged over decades with organizations across a number of communities, including those in the LGBTQ+ community. The privacy and safety of our employees and our partners is always our top priority."
 
Now, since the backlash, Bud Light sales plummeted. It's no longer America's number-one-selling beer. The Times reports that the stock for the parent company Anheuser-Busch has dropped more than 15 percent.
 
HARLOW:  This morning, we are expecting a huge decision -- another one -- from the high court on student loans. This is after the Supreme Court's monumental decision on affirmative action. What it all means for colleges and students. We're going to be joined next by Education Sec. Miguel Cardona. 
 
(COMMERCIAL)
 <br>[07:42:07]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I also believe that while talent, creativity, and hard work are everywhere across this country, not equal opportunity -- it is not everywhere across this country. We cannot let this decision be the last word.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MATTINGLY:  Well, after yesterday's historic Supreme Court ruling, President Biden has directed the Department of Education to analyze practices for promoting a diverse student body. So what does that actually mean? Well, we're going to ask the Education Sec. Miguel Cardona. He joins us now. Mr. Secretary, thanks for your time.
 
I want to start with the idea of this not being the last word. What can the Department of Education do? I know there's been months of preparation for this moment. Tangibly, what can the Education Department and the administration do to address any shortfalls or shortcomings you see from this ruling?
 
MIGUEL CARDONA, EDUCATION SECRETARY:  Yes, and thank you for having me, Phil.
 
Well, first of all, to the students and families who are paying attention to this and realizing this could have an impact on them, my message to them is we need you, we want you. Diverse learning environments make better learning environments. 
 
And then, what we're doing, as the president said, this can't be the last word. Within 45 days, we're going to be providing guidance to college presidents on the Supreme Court ruling. We're analyzing the 200 pages and we're going to make sure we're clear on what it does mean and what it does not mean. 
 
Within three weeks, we're going to have a national summit on education opportunity here at the Department of Education with leaders from around the country, and we're going to be focusing on the Supreme Court decision and what it means for admissions processes.
 
And then, by September, we're going to publish a report that highlights promising practices in college admissions to make sure that our college leaders have resources and tools to make sure that we continue to encourage diversity on our college campuses.
 
MATTINGLY:  You know, the Education Department has as much visibility as any researcher into numbers and data. Do you have an idea of what this -- what affect this will have on admissions in the near term?
 
CARDONA:  Well, right. I mean, I think -- you know, looking at previous cases is a -- is a good way to look at it. In 1996, the courts struck down affirmative action in California. The number of Black and Latino students in top universities there plummeted 50 percent. Now, they recovered but not fully, with different strategies. 
 
But we don't want that trajectory to be the trajectory of this country. Our country is built on diversity and we recognize the importance of making sure that our college campuses reflect the population of our country, and we have work to do there.
 
MATTINGLY:  Do you disagree with Chief Justice Roberts' contention that this isn't the striking down of the precedent in its entirety? Universities can still consider this. Do you think that that's not actually the case?
 <br>[07:45:00]
 
CARDONA:  Look, the Supreme Court made a decision yesterday to take race out of it. However, the legacy status of students still could be considered. Wealth and lineage could still be considered. You know, deeming -- as Justice Jackson said, deeming race irrelevant in law does not make it so in life. 
 
And we have to take into account the fact that while we're working really hard on it, our schools are not providing the equal access. If you look at our data across the country Black and brown students are still not performing at the same levels. We can't ignore that when thinking about providing opportunities. We must work on it. And that's why we're being aggressive around making sure our K-12 schools are making the grade for our students. They deserve an opportunity as well. 
 
MATTINGLY:  Mr. Secretary, I understand the administration's opposition to this ruling and the lead-up to and since. There has also been -- there have also been advocates that have been pushing for this and I want to take a listen to one. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
YUKONG ZHAO, ASIAN AMERICAN COALITION:  This is a historic victory for Asian Americans because our children will no longer be treated as second-class citizens in college admissions. This is a victory for all Americans.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MATTINGLY:  And it has been the Asian American community -- or Asian American students that have been pushing for this -- bringing these cases that ended up reaching the Supreme Court. 
 
What's your response to that? There are numbers that back up the idea that was laid out there.
 
CARDONA:  Yes. I respect the different perspectives that are out there. But to the comments that were made in that recording, students shouldn't feel like second-class citizens. 
 
Well, as the president said yesterday, unfortunately, there's still discrimination. We still have gaps in outcomes. We still have gaps in opportunity. We still have gaps in health care access based on race and place.
 
We need to be honest with ourselves and say we have to address that. And we have to be intentional about strategies that level the playing field. We have students in our schools that have to work twice as hard just to get to the starting block. It's not -- it's not level yet, and that's what this allowed us to do. 
 
And even with affirmative action, the data shows that our student population in college still doesn't reflect the diversity of our country. We have a lot of work to do. This is taking us a step back but we're undeterred. We want to continue to move forward.
 
MATTINGLY:  Mr. Secretary, I do want to you ask -- diversity and equity very central to the president's decision to cancel student loan debt for up to 40 million Americans. The Supreme Court ruling is expected on that today. 
 
The administration has been very coy about whether there is an alternative that is being considered if it gets struck down. Is there an alternative if it gets struck down?
 
CARDONA:  You know, we -- within hours, we're going to be hearing from the Supreme Court on this decision. We're confident in our case. 
 
We believe over 40 million Americans are waiting to get a little bit of respite just like many of our small businesses did recovering from the pandemic. And this is targeted toward middle class. Ninety percent of the dollars go to people making less than $75,000.
 
But to your question, right now my focus is on the case that we put forward. We're prepared and it's in our DNA at the Department of Education to fight for students and to fight for borrowers who, right now, need a little bit of support.
 
MATTINGLY:  All right, Education Sec. Miguel Cardona. A very busy week for you, sir. Thanks for taking the time -- appreciate it.
 
CARDONA:  Thank you.
 
HARLOW:  Yes, great to hear from him. A very busy week, indeed, for him and all of DOE. 
 
Ahead, a police officer in Florida going beyond the call of duty, making a big difference in children's lives. We're going to show you how.

ANDREW SANTOS, RIVIERA BEACH POLICE ATHLETIC LEAGUE PARTICIPANT:  I used to get in trouble at home, had bad grades, talked back to my mom. And ever since I got in here I've been a whole different person.

HARLOW:  South Florida Police Officer Jonathan Nance is more than a man with a badge. He found a way to help to keep children healthy, active, and involved in their community -- and it is working.
 
Our Randi Kaye shows us how he's going beyond the call of duty.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
OFFICER JONATHAN NANCE, RIVIERA BEACH, FLORIDA POLICE:  Go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
 
RANDI KAYE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  In Riviera Beach, Florida, these boys are working out under the hot sun and loving it. Putting them through these drills, Riviera Beach Police Officer John Nance, though the kids simply call him "Coach."
 
NANCE:  Good job, fellas.
 
KAYE (voice-over):  Two years ago, Nance saw a need and started the Police Athletic League.
 
NANCE:  I recognized how high the crime rate was with juveniles.
 
Go!
 
KAYE (voice-over):  So, Nance, with the help of a few of his fellow officers, started taking some of the teens in the community under their wing. Now they mentor about 60 kids all year round teaching them to stay healthy and physically fit. They play basketball, pick up trash in the neighborhood. They even impress the chief of police with their push-up skills. It's all part of building trust and keeping these kids off the streets and out of trouble. 
 
KAYE (on camera):  How do kids respond to you guys being police officers?
 
NANCE:  At the beginning, they're a little nervous but somewhere later they come around and they always want to be next to you, and that's how you know you're building a trust in them. 
 
We've got to have some type of understanding of where these kids come from. Sometimes they're just showing anger because dad is not in their life. Sometimes they're showing anger because something is not going right in school. So we have to sit down and talk with them and let them know that everything is going to be OK.
 
KAYE (voice-over):  The free program includes students from elementary school through high school, like 15-year-old Jamarey Harris.
 
JAMAREY HARRIS, PROGRAM PARTICIPANT:  It just keeps us doing something positive and keeps us out of the streets.
 
KAYE (on camera):  Have you bonded with the officers?
 
HARRIS:  Yes, I have, actually. I love Coach Nance. That's probably my favorite place in the world. 
 
KAYE (voice-over):  Fifteen-year-old Andrew Santos says Coach Nance is like a father to him. He told me the program has helped him make positive changes.
 
SANTOS:  It changed me a lot. I used to get in trouble at home, had bad grades, talked back to my mom. And ever since I got in here I've been a whole different person. 
 
KAYE (voice-over):  Riviera Beach Police Chief Michael Coleman is proud of the work Nance and others in his department are doing.
 
CHIEF MICHAEL COLEMAN, RIVIERA BEACH, FLORIDA POLICE:  It gets into these kids' heart letting them know that he was once their age and he had the same struggles they had in life. So, he broke down the barriers early on by being honest and truthful, and real to them. 
 <br>[05:55:09]
 
When you run a police department you can't arrest yourself out of problems. So you have to have programs like this to eliminate future crime.
 
KAYE (voice-over):  Officer Nance hopes one day these kids pay it forward.
 
NANCE:  It doesn't stop with them. It has to multiply. So in 20 years when they go and be successful and they give back to the community and spend some time with some kids that's when I know I have done my job. 
 
NANCE:  You ready?
 
KAYE (voice-over):  Randi Kaye, CNN, Riviera Beach, Florida.

MATTINGLY:  Well, we're expecting more big decisions from the Supreme Court today after yesterday's ruling against affirmative action. That's coming up ahead.

ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  President Biden, the Congressional Black Caucus said the Supreme Court has thrown into question its own legitimacy. Is this a rogue court?
 
BIDEN:  This is not a normal court. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARLOW:  Good morning, everyone. You just heard that from the President of the United States, very unhappy with the Supreme Court's decision yesterday on affirmative action.
 
MATTINGLY:  And it was a very good question from our own Arlette Saenz but --
 
HARLOW:  It was. 
 
MATTINGLY:  -- it is the question I think, particularly on the political side, that everybody's thinking about right now. But there are also very real legal and policy --
 
HARLOW:  Yes.
 
MATTINGLY:  -- repercussion to come --
 
HARLOW:  That's right.
 
MATTINGLY:  -- all which we're going to explore in the next hour.
 
HARLOW:  This is the law of the land now. It's a very different America for students and universities.
