BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN HOST: We're learning that the mob who attacked two Marines in Turkey are part of a known anti-American group that has assaulted U.S. servicemembers before.
 
More than a dozen members of that group were detained after the Marines were seen on video outnumbered and restrained by people yelling at them to go home.
 
Watch this.

SANCHEZ: This happened after the Americans left their ship for a break in the port city of Izmir yesterday. 
 
CNN Pentagon correspondent, Oren Liebermann, has the latest for us -- Oren? 
 
OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: Boris, 15 people were taken into custody as a result of this attack on two U.S. servicemembers that occurred in the port city of Izmir, Turkey, on Monday afternoon.
 
According to the Navy, these Marines were on the "USS Wasp" that had just pulled into the port city of Izmir after operating in the eastern Mediterranean Sea over the course of the past several weeks.
 
These Marines were on shore leave when they were assaulted and attacked on the streets of Izmir by this mob. And you can see it in this video. 
 <br>[13:34:59]
 
This mob grabs and hangs onto the Marines. One of them even shouts for help. They place a bag over the head of the others servicemember and then began chanting, "Yankee, go home." 
 
According to local authorities, this mob are members of the Turkish Youth Union. That's a nationalist anti-American group that has carried out attacks on U.S. servicemembers in Turkey in the past.
 
There was a similar incident back in November 2021. And this hasn't just been fairly recent. There was one even a decade ago, in 2014, when members of this group, according to authorities there, grabbed a U.S. servicemember and placed a bag over his head. 
 
According to the Navy, there were other Marines nearby who were able to intervene, get these two Marines out of there, take them to a local hospital where they were checked out. According the Navy, both are doing OK. They were then returned to the "USS Wasp." 
 
Local authorities are investigating this, also, along with NCIS. So that investigation continues.
 
Again, according to local authorities there in Turkey, 15 people have been taken into custody. The Marines are doing OK. None of the Marines were detained -- Boris? 
 
SANCHEZ: Oren Liebermann, thank you so much for that report.
 
BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: And now to some of the other headlines that we're watching this hour. 
 
DirecTV is trying to make it up to customers hit by its distribution dispute with Disney. Subscribers can now apply for credits worth at least $20. 
 
The compensation comes amid the ongoing blackout of Disney-owned channels, including ESPN and FX. Disney pulled its networks from the TV provider Sunday as contract negotiations stalled. 
 
Also, new images show that mother nature is far from done with the "Titanic," which sank more than 110 years ago. A part of the ship's iconic bow has fallen off from decay. And it now lies on the sea floor.
 
This area was made famous, of course, in the King of the World scene in the 1997 film, "Titanic." 
 
The expedition crew that took the images also rediscovered a piece of art from the doomed voyage. It is a two-foot-tall bronze statue of Diana, the Roman goddess of nature and hunting, which can be seen in a debris field. It once stood atop the fireplace mantle in the ship's first-class lounge. 
 
And finally, in Australia, several thieves stole more than two dozen guns, not from a home but from a museum. These are historic firearms. And museum officials say the 27 guns can be made operational. Police in New South Wales say the weapons are worth about $130,000.
 
Coming up, Chase says it's investigating a viral glitch that allowed an unknown number of customers to steal money from its ATMs. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[13:41:57]
 
SANCHEZ: You might have seen some of these viral TikTok videos that went viral over Labor Day weekend. Add people believing that they could get free cash from Chase ATMs. 
 
But in reality, this is just a system-wide glitch and the bank says many who took advantage of it were committing fraud and they want a word.
 
KEILAR: Yes, I bet they do. 
 
CNN's Matt Egan has a word for us. 
 
This is -- this is how my kid -- I've had to explain to my kids, Matt, it's not free money. But then these folks went to the ATM and it seemed like it was.
 
Tell us about the glitch and what these videos are about.
 
MATT EGAN, CNN REPORTER: Yes, Boris, Brianna, this is such a bizarre story. So over the weekend, there were these viral videos spreading of people celebrating outside of Chase banks, throwing cash up in the air, even putting Chase cards into their mouth, all because they thought they hit the jackpot.
 
Well, what seems to have happened is they stumbled upon a temporary loophole. So what people did was they started cashing -- they started depositing checks for obscene amounts of money, apparently bad checks. 
 
And next they would withdraw large amounts of money, but smaller than those checks were. And then they got cash and they celebrated. 
 
But what Chase says is that they have been able to quickly fix this issue. And, in some cases, they were actually able to claw back some of the money. 
 
And so some of the people on social media in these TikTok videos, they've actually displayed negative balances. And one user had an ATM error on his account. And it said a negative $40,000 in charges. 
 
Now, Chase is warning people that this is one social media trend that you do not want to follow. 
 
The bank says in a statement, "We are aware of this incident and it has been addressed. Regardless of what you see online, depositing a fraudulent check and withdrawing funds from your account is fraud, plain and simple."
 
But obviously, this situation raises a lot of questions about how this was able to happen in the first place. Why didn't Chase know that these were bad checks? And how were people able to cash them? 
 
Now, a person familiar with the matter tells CNN that this incident occurred on Friday and was quickly addressed. The source said that Chase is still investigating, though, how this happened. 
 
And the bank doesn't know at this point exactly how many customers were involved or even how much money was involved. 
 
Chase is not commenting on whether or not regulators are investigating. Neither the need of the Federal Reserve nor the Comptroller of the Currency would comment to CNN on this. 
 
But, Brianna and Boris, you've got to imagine regulators are going to be determined to get to the bottom of exactly what happened and to prevent it from happening again.
 
SANCHEZ: And between this and Tide pods, I'm really starting --
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
SANCHEZ: -- to think that we should be cautious about the content we consume online.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
SANCHEZ: Matt Egan, thank you so much. 
 
EGAN: Thank you, yes. 
 <br>[13:45:01]
 
SANCHEZ: So a New Hampshire dad is fighting for his life after testing positive for three mosquito-borne viruses, including EEE. Dr. Sanjay Gupta is closely following this story and he joins us next. 
 
Plus, a Russian strike has killed more than 50 people in central Ukraine, injuring hundreds more. We'll take you live to Kyiv for the latest.

KEILAR: All right. It's been five years since the Museum of Modern Arts' latest expansion. In midtown Manhattan, it's a draw for art lovers everywhere, featuring an ever-changing array of contemporary work. 
 
SANCHEZ: Yes, but the MoMA is also steeped in colorful history. 
 
CNN's Richard Quest takes us back to its beginnings.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
RICHARD QUEST, CNN BUSINESS EDITOR-AT-LARGE &amp; CNN HOST "QUEST MEANS BUSINESS" (voice-over): MoMA, the Museum of Modern Art, it was born in turbulent times when MoMA opened days after the 1929 Wall Street crash. 
 
MoMA's idea was simple. New York needed a museum focused on the art of today, not that ancient stuff.
 
GLENN LOWRY, DAVID ROCKEFELLER DIRECTOR, THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: This institution, when it was founded in 1929 by three extraordinary women and Alfred Barr as its young director, actually had a global perspective.
 
Among the first exhibitions here were exhibitions of Mexican art, exhibitions of American primitives, exhibitions of subcontinental Indian art.
 
QUEST: The idea has caught on and within three years, MoMA had outgrown its original home in a 12-story apartment. Moving to a nearby town house and its permanent home, steps from New York's Fifth Avenue.
 
The greatest artists of the 20th century hang on these walls, Jackson Pollock, Jasper Johns, Andy Warhol. They've all made their names on the walls of the MoMA.
 
Today's artists use the MoMA as a launching pad, taking careers to new heights.
 
LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER, ARTIST: I was stunned when MoMA reached out to me to offer me the exhibition. 
 
It was FDR who was on the radio who talked about the purpose and the mission of the Museum of Modern Art. And he distinctly pointed out that, first of all, art belongs to the people.
 
FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Friends of the Museum of Modern Art, the mission of this museum is plain. We are dedicating this building to the cause of peace.
 
QUEST: Today, this museum is considered the epicenter that the modern art world. And it is a position the director, Glenn Lowry, takes very seriously.
 
LOWRY: I worry about everything. I worry about whether anybody will show up at the museum in the morning. Literally, will people bother to come to the museum?
 
I worry about whether it is going to rain or not, because when it rains, more people come to the museum.
 
So I am one of those people that looks at a sunny day and goes, oh, no, not another beautiful day. because I know -- I know that if its bad weather, more people will visit the museums.
 
QUEST: Over its 95-year history, the MoMA has weathered many storms.
 
A devastating fire in the late 1950s wiped out some of its prized treasures.
 
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Many others are scooted to safety by employees undaunted by the fire.
 
QUEST: And recently, the MoMA has undergone expansions, relocations and renovations galore.
 
LOWRY: So I think of the institution not as a fixed entity. Imagine the British Museum, or the Louvre, or the Metropolitan, they are historical institutions. Their responsibility is to tell this very long story in a very measured and ordered way.
 
We are a work in progress.
 
QUEST: Perhaps that is the beauty of The Museum of Modern Art, always changing, always reinventing itself, much like the art that fills its galleries.
 
Richard Quest, CNN, New York.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
SANCHEZ: Richard Quest, as colorful as some of the artwork in MOMA. Thanks so much for that report.

KEILAR: A strike on Ukraine and a new plea for help. Russian missiles killing at least 51 people, injuring over 200. It is one of the deadliest attacks since the start of Russia's war in Ukraine. 
 
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says that they'll never forget this. And that Ukraine badly needs its own missiles to fight back. 
 
Also, a fight over reproductive freedom. Vice President Kamala Harris saying that she will protect those rights and that her opponent can't be trusted on the issue.
 
While former President Donald Trump risks alienating his base with his own position on abortion, his shifting position. And the debate between the two presidential contenders, just one week away. 
 
SANCHEZ: And how long do we have until sea levels rise enough to drown coastal cities? A fleet of ocean robots could help us find out.
 
We're following these major developing stories and many more, all coming in right here at CNN NEWS CENTRAL.
 <br>[13:59:58]
 
KEILAR: Right now, Ukraine is reeling. There's no other way to put it. People there mourning after one of the deadliest single attacks since Russia launched its full-scale invasion more than two years ago.
