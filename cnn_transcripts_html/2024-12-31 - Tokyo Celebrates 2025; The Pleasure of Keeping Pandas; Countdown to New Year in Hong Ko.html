KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN ANCHOR:  -- welcoming 2025.
 
HANAKO MONTGOMERY, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Kristie, let me tell you the Japanese know how to spend the new year right because they have so much traditional delicious Japanese food that they eat with their families. And as you can tell right behind me, the event has just ended, and already there are -- there's nobody here. I mean -- and the place is spotless. And I can tell you, these people probably rushed home so that they can be in their warm beds and so that they can start off the New Year right with sleep and with their families.
 
And speaking of food, Kristie, I actually have one more surprise for you here tonight. You might remember this from last year. I have here Osechi Ryori made by our fantastic, talented producer Yumi. And in here are some of my favorite New Year's cuisine.
 
Actually, I just want to show you this. This is shrimp here. And this shrimp is supposed to represent longevity because, I hope you can see the symbolism, it kind of looks like an old person with a rounded back, and this is just one of my favorite foods to eat on New Year's Day. There's just so much in here. We also have the colors of the Japanese flag. I know this is pink, but this is supposed to be red, white and red to represent the Japanese flag and also to represent prosperity and purity.
 
And, Kristie, again, this is just some of the amazing food that we get to eat on New Year's Day. And I just cannot wait to dig in. Kristie.
 
STOUT:  Thank you for sharing that with me. I love it when you share the New Year's Eve bento box. I don't quite get the symbolism of the shrimp, but I can appreciate it. And someone else who would appreciate it too, because she has got a wicked sense of humor. A very special guest you talked to recently about the year ahead. Tell us about Naomi Watanabe.
 
MONTGOMERY:  Yes, Kristie, Naomi Watanabe was, I think, the funniest interview I've done in a very long time. Of course, So, famous here in Japan. There's not a person in Japan who doesn't know her name. She can literally walk down the street and so many people would recognize her. And now, she is making her debut as a comedian in the United States as well. And it is truly kicking off. This is what she has in store for the new year.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
NAOMI WATANABE, JAPANESE COMEDIAN AND ACTRESS:  OK. One, two, three.
 
MONTGOMERY (voice-over):  In case you can't tell from our killer moves, I'm learning how to dance like Beyonce from the one and only Naomi Watanabe.
 
WATANABE:  Oh, so Beyonce. So, good.
 
MONTGOMERY (voice-over):  There's not a person in Japan who doesn't know this comedian. After impersonating Beyonce in 2008, Watanabe skyrocketed, starring in TV shows, modeling, and launching her own fashion brand, all while sharing the ride with her 10 million followers. And as if that weren't enough, three years ago, Watanabe set her sights on a new challenge, making people laugh in America.
 
WATANABE:  Japan, everybody knows me. This is so happy, but I want more. If I go to the America, if you don't know me, this is so good ecstasy.
 
MONTGOMERY (voice-over):  Watanabe lives in New York City now and has some thoughts about the people.
 
WATANABE:  They speak really fast and they love money, right? New Yorkers, they call money.
 
MONTGOMERY:  And you did your first comedy show. How did that go?
 
WATANABE:  The first time is so nervous. But on stage, I do the perform stand-up style and everybody laughing. I was like, oh, I'm so funny. I'm so genius.
 
MONTGOMERY:  What do you think is the biggest difference between Japanese comedy and American comedy?
 
WATANABE:  Japanese comedian is always duo, duo style. American style is only one person, right? But timing is pay.
 
MONTGOMERY:  What is your goal for 2025?
 
WATANABE:  More stand-up comedy tour. And I want challenge for sketch comedy. Yes, I want more famous.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
MONTGOMERY (on camera):  And as a native New Yorker, Kristie, her comments about New York just totally cracked me up. And as you can tell, sometimes comedy, like for instance, in Naomi Watanabe's case, transcends cultural and language barriers. Kristie.
 
STOUT:  Naomi Watanabe is super cool, hilarious, fun, and I love her sense of style. Thank you for bringing us that interview. Hanako Montgomery joining us live from Tokyo. Happy New Year, my friend. Take care and we'll talk again soon.
 
Now, our next guest, they are young, they are women and they can rock all in the name of girl power. CNN's Mike Valerio introduces us to Indonesia's metalhead trio. They're called Voice of Baceprot.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MIKE VALERIO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  They're the Voice of Baceprot, VOB for short. With Marsya singing lead vocals and on guitar, Siti on drums, Widi on bass. Their mission is to simply rock your world.
 <br>[10:35:00]
 
Three women from Indonesia playing heavy metal in hijabs.
 
VOICE OF BACEPROT:  Hi. We are boys of Voice of Baceprot.
 
VALERIO (voice-over):  They've come a long way from their conservative village in West Java. VOB is Indonesia's first band to play Glastonbury, the iconic U.K. Music Festival. We sat down in our studio and had the chance to chat with VOB as they toured Australia. Our first question, what's next for 2025 ?
 
SITI, VOICE OF BACEPROT, INDONESIAN ROCK TRIO:  In 2025, we want to free ourself up to explore heavier and wilder sound.
 
VALERIO (voice-over):  A wilder sound, but they say their message of girl power grow even stronger.
 
WIDI, VOICE OF BACEPROT, INDONESIAN ROCK TRIO:  The voice of women and people who maybe far from urban centers are also important.
 
MARSYA, VOICE OF BACEPROT, INDONESIAN ROCK TRIO:  Yes.
 
WIDI:  Because something amazing and maybe good can come from anywhere.
 
VALERIO:  Do you feel that you are living proof of that?
 
MARSYA:  Almost. With our music, yes, almost.
 
VALERIO (voice-over):  By embracing heavy metal, a genre traditionally dominated by men, VOB says they're challenging societal norms back home, showing their faith and music can coexist.
 
MARSYA:  We're not going to lie, this journey is not easy and it's so difficult and stressful sometimes. But there will always be a stage for you, girls, and there will always be people who want to appreciate your efforts and support you.
 
VALERIO:  Yes, there are people cheering you on all over the world.
 
WIDI:  We hope that in the next five years we will grow into braver women. And still hold each other close visit more places with our music.
 
MARSYA:  And meet more listeners out there.
 
SITI:  Yay. (END VIDEOTAPE)
 
STOUT:  All right. We need to see them perform live. 2025 to-do list right there. You're watching CNN's New Year's Eve live special. Coming up next. 2024 has been called the year of the panda here in Hong Kong, and I'm going to show you why just ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:40:00]
 
STOUT:  Coming to you live from Hong Kong. I'm Kristie Lu Stout. And we are getting ready to usher in a new year here in Hong Kong. It's less than 20 minutes away. The crowd here behind me, they're all stoked. Guess what? These folks are from Japan. It's already 2025 in Japan, right? Happy New Year.
 
And that means they get to bring in the new year, not just once, but twice. Japan style, Hong Kong style. Joining us now are some Hong Kong guests. We got Yuki and her husband, Hincent. Not, Vincent, Hincent with an H.
 
And, Yuki, you are an influencer. You focus on food. You are a Hong Konger. This is your first time watching the fireworks from this vantage point. What are you looking forward to?
 
YUKI:  I'm like a lot of good food and travel in 2025. Of course.
 
STOUT:  Absolutely. And what about the fireworks display in the countdown? What are you looking forward to?
 
YUKI:  Yes, it's like -- yes, of course, it's the best view from here.
 
STOUT:  We got the best view.
 
YUKI:  Yes, exactly.
 
HINCENT:  Maybe some patterns like smile or 2025.
 
STOUT:  There will be some patterns. I heard there's going to be rainbow smoke with some silver fireworks. So, that's definitely one to look out for. I have to ask you for some foodie know how. What was the best meal you had in 2024?
 
YUKI:  Wow. That's I don't have too many, like but my recent favorites will be like some weekend brunch from, for example, Style from Park Lane, which is with free flow oysters, free flow champagne, free flow caviar.
 
STOUT:  But super fancy.
 
YUKI:  That's crazy, right?
 
STOUT:  Wow. My best meal in the last year was just eggs and pancakes. I was just an American down -- 
 
YUKI:  -- like, yes, simple pleasure, you know, guilty pleasure.
 
STOUT:  Fantastic. New Year's resolution for next year, what you got?
 
YUKI:  I think to learn some new skills like diving, you know. I just had a -- 
 
HINCENT:  Snowboarding, yes.
 
YUKI:  Right. Snowboarding.
 
HINCENT:  To sharpen the snowboarding skills.
 
STOUT:  That's a good one.
 
HINCENT:  But (INAUDIBLE) the next year with a good meal. Dim sum tomorrow.
 
STOUT:  Yes, dim sum tomorrow. That's a giggle.
 
YUKI:  With our family.
 
STOUT:  Hincent, Yuki, thank you so much. Happy New Year. Happy New Year, all you guys.
 
We are going to go to my friend, Will Ripley, who joins us now from Bangkok. He just wrapped up an interview with Lisa from BlackPink. What should got? See, she got so excited. What you got, Will?
 
WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Oh, Kristie. I am a little bit star struck right now. Yes, we just Finished our interview with Lisa. She's really nice. She actually said she's nervous about tonight because she's going to be headlining a countdown for the first time. And it's very fitting that countdown is here at ICONSIAM in Bangkok, where it all began for her when she was 13 years old and auditioning with YG Entertainment which would eventually lead her to BlackPink.
 
And now, this year, she just told me she's coming out with an album in February. She's going to be headlining Coachella again. She did it with BlackPink. Now, she's going to be there solo. It's a great conversation and we're just editing the video a little bit, getting it ready for air, Kristie, and we're going to have it at the top of the next hour for you.
 
I'm not hearing anything. So, I'm not sure if Kristie asked me a second question, but I'm just going to go ahead and toss to my story with Nymphia Wind the Iconic Taiwanese drag queen the first East Asian winner of RuPaul's Drag Race after many. Many seasons of that show, I had a chance to meet speak with her.
 <br>[10:45:00]
 
Unfortunately, it was remote. She was in New York, I was in Taipei. So, we were kind of flip-flopping home, hometowns, home country. She lives there now, I live in her home, hometown. But we had a great time chatting, and here is Nymphia Wind. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
RIPLEY (voice-over):  Ever since making her story as the first East Asian winner in 16 seasons of RuPaul's Drag Race.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Nymphia Wind.
 
RIPLEY (voice-over):  Life and work has been a whirlwind for Taiwanese American drag queen, Leo Tsao, known by the stage name, Nymphia Wind.
 
RIPLEY:  I can tell you're an overachiever.
 
NYMPHIA WIND, TAIWANESE DRAG QUEEN:  I know, like this past year, I've not had a weekend for myself. I'm just like work, work, work.
 
RIPLEY (voice-over):  From Taiwan's presidential office to the Paris Cultural Olympiad, to pride events around the world, Nymphia just might be the hardest working drag queen of 2024.
 
NYMPHIA WIND:  I'm dying. Thank God this is taped. Oh, girl.
 
RIPLEY (voice-over):  Sometimes stopping for just a few hours before jumping on the next plane.
 
RIPLEY:  How are you still standing right now? You need a vacation, girl.
 
NYMPHIA WIND:  I think I'm a workaholic, and I'm just so used to being tired all the time. I'm just like, I just keep going.
 
RIPLEY (voice-over):  That hard work building her brand is paying off.
 
NYMPHIA WIND:  I am the Jiao Fa (ph) of Taiwan, the Banana Buddha. And you know, bananas are a very prominent product of Taiwan. I have to represent.
 
RIPLEY:  So, you have now made the banana your brand?
 
NYMPHIA WIND:  Exactly.
 
RIPLEY:  Since we can't be together in person, Nymphia, I've got the next best thing. So, I kind of feel like we're next to each other right now.
 
NYMPHIA WIND:  Oh, I feel so close to you, Will.
 
RIPLEY (voice-over):  Nymphia makes most of her costumes by hand.
 
RIPLEY:  But they're very pointy. They look dangerous, actually.
 
NYMPHIA WIND:  Do you want to come touch and try? I dare you to edit that in CNN. Edit in my pointy boobs.
 
RIPLEY (voice-over):  With the wind in her sails, Nymphia is setting some serious goals for 2025. NYMPHIA WIND:  I really would love to be a cultural Taiwanese ambassador for Taiwan and the world. I want to show you what Taiwan has to offer because we may be small, but we are beautiful.
 
Taiwan, this is for you.
 
RIPLEY (voice-over):  After getting some well-deserved rest of course.
 
NYMPHIA WIND:  Happy New Year.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
RIPLEY (on camera):  She really needs a vacation. And in fact, I've been following her on Instagram. And I think Nymphia is actually at the South Pole, like at Antarctica right now. I've been following her Instagram story. Well-deserved rest. She's been working very hard this year. And I think Lisa's about to walk behind us in a minute. But I don't know if we'll catch it on the air or not.
 
STOUT:  OK. But let's keep the -- Will, we'll keep the camera rolling for that a little bit, because I want to see Lisa, but your interview with Nymphia, the queen, I mean, she killed it with that final lip sync right on RuPaul's Drag Race. She is amazing.
 
I got something to show you. I'm just going to describe it because I don't think you have a return monitor there, but it's something Nymphia would love. It is yellow. It is her favorite fruit. It does involve duct tape on a board. It did not cost me $6.2 million. A crypto billionaire here in Hong Kong made that purchase. It is a rip off, but it is a homage, and it is another homework assignment that I did for CNN New Year's Eve Live, along with the bedazzled mic. Dear, Will.
 
RIPLEY:  Kristie, I just continue to be -- I'm speechless, because you just keep upstaging the bedazzled mic flag, the banana, what do you not do perfectly, Kristie Lu Stout?
 
STOUT:  No, no, no. No one can upstage you -- no one can upstage Nymphia. I mean, she shared her points with us. And we'll just leave it at that. Will Ripley joining us live from Bangkok. My dear, thank you so much. And we can't wait to see the entire Lisa interview. Take care, Will.
 
Now, you're watching CNN's New Year's Eve live special coming to you from Hong Kong, 2025. As we've been reporting here, as we've been showing you, already being welcomed around the world by major cities, including Tokyo earlier this hour. And before that, as you see on your screen, Sydney, Australia. And we are only around, what, 12 minutes, 11 minutes or so away from the start of the new year here in Hong Kong. And we're also going to see big celebrations in Taiwan, as well as Mainland China.
 
Now, it has been the year of the panda in Hong Kong. The city's gone from two giant pandas at the start of the year to six in just a matter of months, including the surprise arrival of two adorable twin panda babies. And we recently scored exclusive behind the scenes access to Hong Kong's Ocean Park. That's home to the greatest number of giant pandas outside of Mainland China. And yes, I had to go check it out.
 <br>[10:50:00]
 
STOUT (voice-over):  The pleasures of keeping pandas. It's a joy Matt Leung shares with his audience of nearly 100,000 on Instagram and experiences each day at Hong Kong's Ocean Park.
 
MATT LEUNG, ASSISTANT CURATOR, ZOOLOGICAL OPERATIONS, OCEAN PARK HONG KONG:  Being there for them, getting to interact with them. Basically, like, you know, I'm very happy to spend every day here.
 
STOUT (voice-over):  We meet at a newly reopened enclosure where Le Le is center stage.
 
LEUNG:  Le Le is very laid back and very gentle as a male. He is 19 years old this year, which is equivalent to around 57 in human years.
 
STOUT (voice-over):  In August, Le Le became a dad. His mate Ying Ying gave birth to twins, making her the world's oldest known first time panda mother. The twins just marked their first 100 days. Here's exclusive video of the star cubs being cared for like human babies.
 
Now, Matt looks after the adult pandas, which he trains and feeds.
 
LEUNG:  Besides bamboo leaf, we also provide a variety of fruits and veggies. We also give them high fiber biscuits. And this is called wowotou. We put eggs in there.
 
STOUT:  It's almost like a dumpling.
 
LEUNG:  Yes, it smells good too.
 
STOUT (voice-over):  They are national treasures all gifted by the Chinese government, including two new ones from Sichuan. In September, elite police escorted them to their new home, an honor usually reserved for heads of state.
 
PAULO PONG, CHAIRMAN, OCEAN PARK HONG KONG:  So, once they're given to us, they'll stay here permanently. We are honored to have this opportunity to continue our work on panda conservation and education.
 
STOUT:  Why do people love pandas so much?
 
LEUNG:  When they fall around, they're very clumsy. They do whatever they like. That's a very cute thing.
 
STOUT (voice-over):  Cute and clumsy. Yet, these pampered pandas can also stick the landing.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
STOUT (on camera):  OK. the crew, they're making me wear this right now. We got Hong Kong, China, Taiwan, and Singapore just moments away from 2025. So, do you stay with us as we bring you all the big celebrations live. The party continues as the CNN Special New Year's Eve live. I'm Kristie Lu Stout in Hong Kong. I'm going to take a quick break and then we're going to count down to the New Year. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:55:00]
 
STOUT:  Welcome back. You're looking live at Victoria Harbor and the gorgeous skyline here in Hong Kong. Just five minutes to midnight now. We want to welcome you back to CNN Special Coverage of New Year's Eve live. I'm Kristie Lu Stout in Hong Kong.
 
BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN ANCHOR:  And I'm Brianna Keilar at the Marriott Marquis Hotel in New York's Times Square. And all day long CNN is taking you around the world as we celebrate the start of 2025 in style. So, stay with us over the coming hours as we ring in the new year across Asia, the Middle East, Africa, Europe, and the Americas, all the way until the ball drops here in New York.
 
STOUT:  Now, Brianna, in just moments, Hong Kong, as well as Mainland China, Taiwan, Singapore, all hit midnight, and we are counting down the minutes right now. In fact, we're less than three minutes away from midnight.
 
Behind me, you see Victoria Harbour. Pretty soon, you're going to see the countdown clock appear on the conference center behind me. But the magic happens when the fireworks go off because the pyrotechnic displays here, Brianna, are massive.
 
We know that this show is going to be about 12 minutes long. It's going to span 4,000 feet across the Victoria Harbour. The pyrotechnics will be fired from, what, five barges, 16 pontoons. You're going to see fireworks being fired off of the iconic skyscrapers behind me. It's going to be called the Symphony of Happiness. And there's one effect that I'm really looking forward to seeing, and it's going to be rainbow smoke with the glittering silver fireworks mingling with it. So, one to watch, Brianna.
 
KEILAR:  It seems like every year there must be pressure to do something even bigger and better, but they're in Hong Kong and they never disappoint. I mean, this is this amazing show we get to see with kind of a 365 effect there in Victoria Harbour, Kristie.
 
STOUT:  Oh, absolutely amazing panoramic view that you get here from Harbour City, where I am right now. And you're right, every year there is that pressure on the pyrotechnic master to come up with something bigger and better.
 
Last year, the star attraction was, believe it or not, beach balls, summer beach balls, fireworks that look just like those colored beach balls you see in the summertime were dancing through the night sky.
 
I also want to show you a little bit about how this all works, because it's not far from my position where I am right now. At the cultural center, that's where mission control is. And so, what they've done is they've designed the pyrotechnic show to go with music. It all starts with the composition. It starts with a score. They lay out the time code and piece of software, then they compose which fireworks, what types of colors, what type of effects happen when. They lay out the time code and from that mission control there, they send the time code to the barges, the pontiff -- sorry, the pontoons to the tops of the skyscrapers, what have you --
