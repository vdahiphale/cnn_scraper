BIANNA GOLODRYGA, CNN ANCHOR: New CNN polling gives America's read on the incoming president. ONE WORLD starts right now.
 
We'll tell you how the public thinks the transition is going for Donald Trump so far.
 
A forensic match tying Luigi Mangione to the scene of the killing of the UnitedHealthcare CEO. We'll have the latest on the case against the 
 
 suspected gunman.
 
Plus, a promise of peace as Syria counts the costs of more than a decade of war.
 
Hello, everyone. Live from New York, I'm Bianna Golodryga. Zain is off today. You are watching ONE WORLD.
 
Americans think Donald Trump is doing a pretty good job with his transition, and they are optimistic about how his presidency will change 
 
 the country. That's what CNN found in a brand new poll released just moments ago. It shows Trump getting significantly higher approval numbers 
 
 on his transition than when he was preparing for his first term in 2016.
 
Almost half of the country thinks Trump will bring positive change to the country. And only one in five think he will make things worse.
 
And a solid 54 percent of Americans believe Trump will do a good job in his first four years. All these numbers suggest that Trump is enjoying a 
 
 honeymoon with the American people, though his support still lacks with polls found at this point for Joe Biden, Barack Obama, George W. Bush and 
 
 Bill Clinton.
 
CNN's national affairs correspondent, Jeff Zeleny, has been going through the numbers and he joins us now.
 
Jeff, we have seen what appears to be a more disciplined, at least relative to what we saw in 2016, transition period for president-elect Trump. He got 
 
 to work immediately after his election win. What is surprising to you in these numbers, if anything?
 
JEFF ZELENY, CNN NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: And, Bianna, that has been one of the striking things. We really have seen a night and day difference 
 
 the second time around as President-elect Donald Trump is filling his government compared to the first time.
 
And it really underscores that he knows more of what he wants and he knows more of how the job actually works. No incoming president coming from the 
 
 outside or even coming from government is exactly sure what the role of president is. Of course, Donald Trump knows exactly.
 
He also knows that time is short. Yes, he was elected to a second term, a four-year term, but they know that really the first half of that is the 
 
 time to get things done. So that explains some of his quick action and really filling out all of his cabinet or prospective members of his 
 
 cabinet. Some may not get confirmed very quickly.
 
But if you look deeper into these numbers, yes, there's no doubt there's a bit of a honeymoon. There's a bit of optimism in the eyes of some American 
 
 voters. There's also a bit of an exhale that people are ready to move on from the election. Some are predictable partisan splits between Republicans 
 
 and Democrats, but it's the independents, of course, that are also so interesting.
 
But you mentioned one of those numbers. Let's take a closer look at that. About seven in 10 Americans say that they think there will be a change, but 
 
 for the positive change, that is largely Republicans believe that. Independents believe to a smaller degree that there will be a change, but 
 
 that is really the bottom line here.
 
So change for the worse, Democrats, obviously, but not change at all, 31 percent. So we are still in a very deeply divided country. There is no 
 
 question. But it does seem that American voters are, A, you know, giving him a bit more space here. And there is a honeymoon, although, as you said, 
 
 not as much as we've seen in years gone by for other incoming presidents.
 
GOLODRYGA: And perhaps also indicative of how Americans feel about the current administration and their optimism about what Joe Biden has been 
 
 able to do over the course of his administration.
 
We've seen so many announcements, a slew of announcements from the president-elect on how he intends to fill his government, but it's notable 
 
 that confidence is down even among Republicans in this poll in terms of appointing the best people for cabinet positions.
 
Tell us more about that.
 
ZELENY: Well, that really jumped out at me. I mean, we've seen just a flurry of announcements, as you've said. A lot are coming from the Fox News 
 
 space. Others are coming from the Senate or the House, but that number really jumped out at me. Let's take a look at it.
 
Just 56 percent of Republicans say that they have a deep confidence that he'll appoint the right people. But that is down from 72 percent of 
 
 Republicans eight years ago.
 <br>[12:05:03]
 
GOLODRYGA: OK.
 
ZELENY: So that really sort of brings in perspective. The honeymoon is not as high among some of his supporters it was then. And they also have seen 
 
 how he has done business. So they've seen that a lot of people he brings in don't make it the whole time in his administration.
 
We saw a revolving door in the first Trump administration, the first Trump term, so we will see if that happens again.
 
But that number really sort of popped out that, yes, a majority of Republicans have confidence in bringing the best people, but it is much, 
 
 much smaller, some 20 points smaller than back in 2016. 
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes. As you noted, perhaps this is just an indication of what they recall, the chaos of the revolving door of cabinet officials.
 
ZELENY: And it was chaotic.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes, it was chaotic. And the last term. We'll see what happens this time around.
 
Jeff Zeleny in Washington for us, thank you so much.
 
ZELENY: You bet.
 
GOLODRYGA: Well, turning now to Syria, where there's a promise of peace in a nation trying to reshape itself and establish a new political order.
 
According to rebel leader Mohammad al-Jolani, other countries have no reason to fear Syria, which he says is heading into the direction of 
 
 stability, development, and reconstruction.
 
Now it comes as rebels claim they have taken control of the eastern city of Deir ez-Zur from the Kurdish-led and U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces. 
 
 But the SDF disputes that claim.
 
In Northern Syria, the same Kurdish faction is still fighting pro-Turkish groups. And in the south of the country, Israeli ground forces this week 
 
 crossed into Syrian territory for the first time in five decades in a move that was condemned by the U.N. and the IDF intensified aerial attacks on 
 
 targets across the country. Israel says that it has carried out nearly 500 strikes across Syria over the last two days alone.
 
CNN's Jomana Karadsheh reports for us near a strategic military base southwest of Damascus. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That thick plume of smoke that you're seeing there, that's rising from the Mezzeh military air base. This was a 
 
 regime strategic military site here in Damascus.
 
And over the past couple of days, it was among the targets that have been hit by the Israeli military. They've carried out hundreds of airstrikes on 
 
 different Syrian regime military sites, installations, weapons, depots and others.
 
Now, as we were approaching it, we heard a couple of blasts. It's unclear if those were fresh airstrikes or if this was some sort of secondary 
 
 explosions that were triggered by those past strikes.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
GOLODRYGA: Well, that's just one of the many fast-moving developments taking place in Syria. Stories are also now emerging of the horrors that 
 
 civilians endured under the Assad regime.
 
Jomana is also covering this angle. And earlier she talked to one woman whose loved ones disappeared in Syria's notorious prison system.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KARADSHEH (voice-over): What's left of Darayya tells of the horrors that unfolded here. Every corner scarred by a ruthless regime's fight for 
 
 survival.
 
This Damascus suburb rose up peacefully, demanding freedom. More than a decade on, a shattered Darayya and its people are finally free.
 
This was for our children, Umfiraz (ph) tells me, and so they don't have to live under the tyrant's rule.
 
Her story of loss and pain so unfathomable for us, yet, so common in this place that for years endured some of the most brutal tactics that the Assad 
 
 regime besieged, starved and bombed into surrender.
 
KARADSHEH: Umfiraz says they came out asking for freedom, and they were met with bullets and tanks. She says, we're not terrorists. And they did this. 
 
 And imagine, she says, there were women and children living in these homes.
 
KARADSHEH (VOICE-OVER): So many men like her husband Mazen (ph) detained and disappeared. Two years later, a released prisoner told her he saw him 
 
 in jail.
 
They beat him so much, his wounded leg was infected. He was in so much pain, she says. There was no medical care in prison. And because of all he 
 
 was going through, he lost his mind. The prisoner last saw him taken away, crying and screaming hysterically.
 
She went from one detention center to the next, searching for him until they broke the news to her in the most cruel of ways. They handed her his 
 
 belongings and told her to register his death.
 
There are no words to describe how I was feeling when I left, she says. I was holding on to the hope he would be released and our family would be 
 
 reunited. They didn't even give me his body.
 
This is the last photo she has of Mazen and his youngest boy, Raif (ph) doesn't remember his dad.
 
Nur (ph) was 6 and so attached to his father. Every day, he would wait by the door for him to come back.
 
When I would hear someone calling baba (ph), dad, it was torment for me, Umfiraz says. What did these children do to be deprived of their father? 
 
 She has to be strong for her boys, she says. She is all they have.
 <br>[12:10:14]
 
Her father also disappeared into the black holes of Assad's jails. Like her husband, their only crime, she says, was being from Darayya.
 
KARADSHEH: She says, I'm just one of thousands and thousands of stories. And that's just in Darayya. And just imagine how many more there are across 
 
 Syria.
 
KARADSHEH (Voice-over): With the end of this dark chapter in their history, a new life, a new Syria emerges from the rubble of their broken lives.
 
Jomana Karadsheh, CNN, Darayya, Syria.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
GOLODRYGA: Be quiet. That was the advice Luigi Mangione's attorney gave to the accused killer. Now this followed Mangione's outburst as he was going 
 
 into a Pennsylvania court Tuesday.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LUIGI MANGIONE, UNITEDHEALTHCARE CEO MURDER SUSPECT: It's completely out of touch and an insult to the intelligence to the American people. It's lived 
 
 experience.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLODRYGA: Investigators accuse him of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO, Brian Thompson, last week. In court, Mangione was denied bail and he is fighting 
 
 extradition to New York.
 
This as CNN is also learning more about the evidence against Mangione. Two law enforcement sources tell CNN that Mangione's fingerprints match those 
 
 found at the scene of the shooting. We've also learned that police have a notebook with a to-do list for the shooting and notes justifying it.
 
"The New York Times" reports Luigi Mangione's mother reported him missing last month. Let's get some perspective on the investigation. We're joined 
 
 by former FBI Special Agent, David Shapiro, who is now a lecturer at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. David, welcome to the program.
 
First, let's start with this new evidence that two agents have confirmed to CNN, and that is that fingerprints recovered from items at the scene of the 
 
 shooting last week in Midtown Manhattan, they include from a plastic bottle and a phone, match the arrest fingerprints of Mangione.
 
He is fighting extradition. It appears that it would have been inevitable that he would lose that battle. But does this evidence expedite his 
 
 expedition -- his -- I'm sorry, his extraction to New York?
 
DAVID SHAPIRO, FORMER FBI SPECIAL AGENT: Well, the extradition hearing is rather formal and relatively easy for the state to overcome. So even an 
 
 objection by Mr. Mangione will not do much. And the accumulation of more evidence will not accelerate the process either. It will occur within a 
 
 month, if not a couple of weeks, no matter the state of the evidence.
 
GOLODRYGA: He was also found with a notebook, the detailed plans for the shooting, according to law enforcement officials. The notebook described 
 
 musings about what could be better than, quote, to kill the CEO at his own bean counting conference.
 
What do you make of this evidence in addition to his three-page manifesto?
 
SHAPIRO: Well, I assume he's establishing a rationale for doing what he did because most of us do not want to consider ourselves evil or bad people 
 
 because this kind of conduct is reprehensible in so many respects.
 
And it also shows, adversely to his own interest perhaps, that he might not have been under any sort of extreme emotional disturbance, any sort of 
 
 mental disease or defect. It seems rather cold calculating rational, considered in depth and all those qualities may actually hurt his defense 
 
 rather than help him.
 
GOLODRYGA: Given that he was found still in possession of the weapon, does that suggest to you that he perhaps had other targets in mind and planned 
 
 to go after?
 
SHAPIRO: As you know, I cannot read his mind. But upon thinking about it strikes me as either this defendant is either stupid because there's no 
 
 reason to carry that kind of incriminating evidence with him, or worse, he's calculating some more dastardly acts, some more murders, some more 
 
 mayhem.
 
And I think that has to be considered also. I mean, why hoard the stuff? Disturbing.
 
GOLODRYGA: What do you make of the fact that, and I don't want to spend too much time going into this because it is a heinous crime that was committed 
 
 brutally, killing an innocent man and left his family without a husband and father.
 
But what do you make of the fact that in some circles he, in a sense, is being glorified, that this -- in some twisted reality is being justified 
 
 going after a system that many people say or are describing however corrupt, even some of the language used in this manifesto itself.
 <br>[12:15:11]
 
For you, does that suggest alarm for other, executives, perhaps, that we could see more copycats? 
 
SHAPIRO: Oh, definitely. What the defendant is getting at in his reasoning and what his supporters get at in their trolling and other sorts of support 
 
 to this kind of action, is justifying it on the basis of what would be called noble cause corruption.
 
Academic terms for the ends justify -- the ends justify the means, and that this was a necessary evil act, but necessary nonetheless.
 
So people jump on that because for whatever reasons, but I see that as just another incident of ends justifying the means.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes. And given this, the NYPD is noting that there may be an elevated threat to executives, not just in the New York area, I would 
 
 imagine across the country now. We'll continue to follow this developing story.
 
David Shapiro, thank you so much for joining us. Thanks for the time.
 
SHAPIRO: CNN, thank you. Good evening.
 
GOLODRYGA: And still to come on CNN, a wildfire that's exploded in size is tearing through Malibu, California, burning homes and forcing some famous 
 
 residents to flee.
 
And a CNN exclusive, one of Diddy's accusers talks about the horrifying night where he was sexually assaulted by the music superstar.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
GOLODRYGA: In South Korea, a political crisis that started with the president's brief declaration of martial law now continues to unfold.
 
Police raided Yoon Suk Yeol's office earlier. A security official tells CNN that it was part of a widening investigation into the president's stunning 
 
 announcement last week. Authorities are now trying to determine if Yoon's declaration was an act of insurrection.
 
Meanwhile, the head of the prison service says that the former defense minister tried to take his own life. The minister, who was prevented from 
 
 harming himself had been in custody since Sunday, the first politician to be detained over the martial law declaration.
 
Meantime, back in the U.S. People in Southern California are being forced to flee from a fast-moving wildfire that's threatening more than 8,000 
 
 homes and businesses.
 <br>[12:20:00]
 
Officials say about 18,000 people are under evacuation orders or warnings as the so-called Franklin fire in Malibu continues to spread.
 
Legendary actor Dick Van Dyke is among those forced to flee. Officials say strong winds and dry conditions are fueling the blaze and crews are working 
 
 around the clock to try to contain the fire.
 
And another accuser is speaking out against Sean "Diddy" Combs, but this time, it's different. The alleged victim is doing it on camera.
 
John Doe has filed a civil suit against combs and is speaking exclusively with CNN's Elizabeth Wagmeister.
 
In the anonymous interview, Doe details alleged abuse at the hands of one of the prominent figureheads in the world of music. We want to warn you, 
 
 this interview does contain some graphic language.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ELIZABETH WAGMEISTER, CNN ENTERTAINMENT CORRESPONDENT: According to your lawsuit, you were hired by a security firm to work security at one of the 
 
 infamous white parties that was thrown by Sean Combs in the Hamptons. What was that experience like?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: At first, he was incredibly friendly, very gracious.
 
WAGMEISTER: So you had a friendly chat, and then, according to your lawsuit, at some point later in the night, Sean Combs himself offered you a 
 
 drink. This didn't come from staff or someone holding a tray of drinks. It came from him directly.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Correct. The first drink started to have some effect on me. And I just thought, wow, these are really strong drinks. It wasn't 
 
 until the second drink, and it was already too late that I realized that there was something wrong with the drinks.
 
Sadly, Sean Combs was waiting in the wings. He was watching from some sort of vantage point. And once I was in a helpless position and he was sure 
 
 that he was in a position of power, then he took advantage of the situation.
 
WAGMEISTER: You allege that you were forcibly pushed into an SUV by Sean Combs. That act alone, according to your lawsuit, left you in considerable 
 
 pain. And then once inside the vehicle, your lawsuit says plaintiff was held down by Combs who overpowered him while he struggled to escape due to 
 
 the effects of the drugs in his system. And it goes on to say that he sodomized you.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I was screaming. I was telling him to stop. It was incredibly painful. And he was acting like it was nothing. And he seemed to 
 
 be disconnected from it. It was abusive beyond belief.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
GOLODRYGA: That was Elizabeth Wagner reporting for us. Meantime, representatives for Combs declined to comment on John Doe's allegations on 
 
 Tuesday.
 
Since the lawsuit was filed in October, Combs' lawyers have said their client has never sexually assaulted anyone.
 
Well, still to come for us, Syria after Assad. As rebels take control after more than a decade of war, what that means for a range of countries that 
 
 have interests in Syria? We'll talk to a former U.S. congresswoman when we return.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:25:55]
 
GOLODRYGA: Welcome back to ONE WORLD. I'm Bianna Golodryga.
 
Well, more now on our top story. Syria after the fall of Bashar al-Assad. The Kremlin says ensuring security at Russian military bases and diplomatic 
 
 missions in Syria is of, quote, paramount importance.
 
Moscow says it has contact with the new leadership in Syria, but some in Russia are now acknowledging challenges Moscow could face under the new 
 
 government. Russia, of course, was a major ally of ousted president, Bashar al-Assad.
 
CNN's Frederik Pleitgen reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): As Syrians embark on a new era after ousting longtime dictator Bashar al-
 
 Assad, Russia fears the era of its massive military footprint in Syria could be coming to an end.
 
The former commander of Russian forces in Syria, and now member of Parliament, is already warning Russia's leadership not to make concessions.
 
Any gesture of goodwill in the Middle East is perceived as weakness. Weakness is unacceptable, he says. What should be done in this situation? 
 
 He's asked. Talk from a position of strength, he answers.
 
But how much power does Russia still hold in Syria? Kremlin-controlled T.V. strategizes over what might come next with maps showing Russia's bases in 
 
 Syria. A guest acknowledges Moscow was caught off-guard again.
 
Thinking about how it all happened in Syria reminds me about how it all happened in Ukraine in 2014, he says. I want to highlight one universal 
 
 lesson for world powers, don't take wishful thinking for reality. When a power is crumbling in days and can't protect itself, this is a verdict.
 
For years, it was the Russian military that kept the Assad regime afloat. Russia's air force pounding rebel groups, its navy firing cruise missiles 
 
 at ISIS militants in Eastern Syria.
 
In return, Assad gave Moscow a 49-year lease on both its main air base near Latakia and a military port in Tartus, allowing Vladimir Putin to project 
 
 power throughout the Middle East.
 
PLEITGEN: The fact that Russia has its military assets in Syria also makes Moscow a key player in the Middle East. But now the Russians acknowledge 
 
 that that status is in jeopardy.
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over): Once a key ally for the Russian leader, Putin now allowed Assad and some of his family members to flee to Moscow, a decision 
 
 folks in Moscow told us they support.
 
We don't abandon our men, he says. He is our man. It was the right decision. He has nowhere to go. He would have been killed.
 
But even here, Syrians living in Russia telling me they're happy Assad's been ousted.
 
We will be able to live in calm and peace and be able to safely visit our country, he says. We don't have to worry that someone can throw us in 
 
 prison because they don't like what we said. We're happy that the dictatorship is over.
 
(CHANTING)
 
Moscow hopes the end of Assad's rule will not spell the end of its military engagement in the Middle East, while acknowledging it's still too early to 
 
 predict.
 <br>[12:30:07]
 
Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Moscow.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
GOLODRYGA: Well, the stunning fall of Syria's Assad regime is reverberating throughout the Middle East and beyond. Let's take a closer look at what the 
 
 upheaval could mean for the surrounding region and the wider world.
 
The U.S. Secretary of State is traveling to Jordan and Turkey for talks. Antony Blinken set out four things that the U.S. expects of a new Syrian 
 
 government, including respecting the rights of minorities and facilitating the flow of humanitarian aid.
 
Then there is the status of Syrian refugees. Germany says their return must be coordinated with partners in Europe and the United Nations.
 
European foreign ministers will discuss Syria when they meet in Berlin Thursday. Germany is urging Turkey and Israel not to jeopardize a peaceful 
 
 transition in Syria.
 
Reports from Turkey say a Turkish drone this week destroyed military vehicles and ammunition in Northern Syria that has been seized by a Kurdish 
 
 group.
 
And Arab nations are voicing concern about Israeli airstrikes in Syria, with Egypt accusing Israel of exploiting instability to grab Syrian 
 
 territory.
 
Time now for The Exchange, where we want to take a closer look at the fast- moving developments in Syria and its impact.
 
Jane Harman joins me now from Washington, D.C. She's a former nine-term democratic Congresswoman from California and a former ranking member of the 
 
 House Intelligence Committee. Jane, welcome to the show.
 
Quite ambitious parameters being laid out, specifically by Antony Blinken and what the U.S. is expecting of a new Syrian government. We know his 
 
 first stop will be in Jordan and then the most crucial of this leg will be Friday when he will be traveling to Ankara.
 
What are the questions? What are the -- what's the outcome that you are hoping to see from this meeting in Turkey, which clearly overnight has 
 
 become one of the winners in this chaotic fall of Assad?
 
JANE HARMAN, FORMER UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE: Well, let's start with who are the losers. And I think the losers are Russia. And understand that 
 
 Russia is now housing the dictator who had to flee. So I don't think Russia gets back in the game very soon. 
 
The other loser is Iran. Why is Iran the loser? Because its proxy groups, especially Hezbollah, have been substantially degraded by the Israeli 
 
 efforts following October 7th of last year.
 
Turkey could be a winner, but let's understand part of the issue here is Kurds. There are good Kurds and bad Kurds. It sounds like "Wicked," the 
 
 movie. I actually thought the bad witch was a good witch, but never mind.
 
GOLODRYGA: Which is part two. Yes.
 
HARMAN: And Turkey doesn't like -- Turkey doesn't like the Kurds that are helping us, the U.S., do two things, which I applaud President Biden for 
 
 doing even that late -- this late in his presidency.
 
One is conditions. I think what Tony Blinken is talking about, the ones you just named, show maybe we've learned the lessons from the way we left 
 
 Afghanistan, which was dismal.
 
We basically turned over the country and all rights for women to the Taliban. This time, we're not trying to do that. So I'm proud of that.
 
I also think the strategic bombing of ISIS, along the border, is exactly the right thing to do. And Donald Trump saying we have -- you know, we have 
 
 no reason to be in this fight. Yes, we do. Counterterrorism is one of the tenets of U.S. foreign and strategic policy. And we don't want ISIS on our 
 
 doorstep.
 
So Turkey can play a big role. Blinken coming to the region right now is exactly right. Jordan and Egypt are also major reasons, or I hope still 
 
 allies, in our effort to stabilize what's going on with Israel. And I'm excited that U.S. foreign policy still has legs in the Biden 
 
 administration.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes, but we have about one month left of the Biden administration, and the whole world knows that the regional players as 
 
 well. So Antony Blinken may be doing all the right things in your view in terms of who to visit and what to prioritize here.
 
But as you noted, Donald Trump has made it crystal clear that he doesn't believe the U.S. should have any role whatsoever in Syria. So one doesn't 
 
 know what that means for the 900 troops. We have stationed there.
 
Lloyd Austin, Defense Secretary said that his number one priority was to protect those troops. And of course, they're the ones that are backing the 
 
 Syrian Defense Forces, the so-called good guys, the good Kurds that you just mentioned.
 
So what would your advice be for Donald Trump to rethink his assessment about the U.S.'s role in a new Syria?
 
HARMAN: Well, let's parse what he means by, this is not our fight. I think what he focuses on when he says things like that is boots on the ground. So 
 
 maybe it means we move our troops somewhere else.
 
There is a risk in Syria, unless this new government, which is sounds like it could be a coalition government, sounds like it could be a moderate, not 
 
 a totally Islamist government, sounds like.
 <br>[12:35:14]
 
There is a possibility that this develops in a positive way. That would be good. I think President Trump would salute that, too. I can't imagine with 
 
 it he wouldn't.
 
And maybe it's even a player, I think, big, in some resurrected form of the Abraham Accords, which I know is on his mind. So this could go good. It 
 
 also could go bad. And we absolutely do have U.S. interests.
 
So my view would be, we have to focus on the 900, as you say, military who are there. They have an important role to play right now. If for any reason 
 
 they're going to be moved, we still need, I think, strategic bombing and other exercises to prevent ISIS from coming back. And that's something I do 
 
 believe will be in the Trump playbook.
 
GOLODRYGA: Do you think this is a time where the U.S. should strongly consider lifting the terror organization label that it did give to HTS?
 
HARMAN: Well, HTS deserved it when it got it. Let's see. Let's see. I think we have some leverage there. And we don't have good history. I mean, think 
 
 the Arab Spring, which was the Arab winter. All these promising bad governments were toppled, promising new governments were possible. And it 
 
 didn't work.
 
So I wouldn't lift it tomorrow morning. I would wait and see the new acting prime minister for a term that ends in March. Think of people voluntarily 
 
 giving up power. It's not the way the world seems to work these days, is -- that's promising, too.
 
And it's mostly peaceful in country, letting people into the jails to see what actually happened. It's an important crucial task.
 
Guard the chemical weapons sites. There are at least six and maybe more. And those gases and other elements are extremely lethal. And getting in the 
 
 wrong hands would be a catastrophe.
 
So we didn't guard the arms caches in Libya, but there weren't chemical weapons. And they got into all the wrong hands after Gaddafi fell, so.
 
GOLODRYGA: We know.
 
HARMAN: So hopefully that lesson, too.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes. And we know that some of the targeting that Israel has been conducting in its bombing has been the weapons caches as well as the 
 
 chemical weapons.
 
Jane Harman, thank you so much. Please stay with us. We want to discuss U.S. politics with you next.
 
Washington insiders say, it looks like Republicans in the Senate are largely ready to back Donald Trump's picks for top positions in the 
 
 government.
 
Pete Hegseth, Donald Trump's defense secretary pick, met today with moderate Republican, Susan Collins, a day after meeting with another 
 
 moderate, Lisa Murkowski. They are seen as the Republicans most likely to defy Trump and vote against Hegseth. So far, neither has publicly committed 
 
 to voting yes or no on his nomination.
 
So, Jane, you know, it appeared last week that Pete Hegseth would go the way of Matt Gaetz, that he didn't stand a chance of being confirmed. He's 
 
 lasted thus far. Donald Trump still is backing him. That could change any time, as you know.
 
But given what we've heard, even from the likes of Joni Ernst, who initially was very skeptical now saying that she's had some relatively good 
 
 meetings with him.
 
Do you think that he ultimately will pass the confirmation?
 
HARMAN: I don't know. I mean, let's see what the FBI has to say. I gather we're now getting, finally, some serious vetting of these candidates.
 
I don't know what the FBI will say, but I think members, if I were a senator, my advice would be wait until you have full information.
 
The advice and consent function of the Senate is a crucial function. And what I worry about is that the Senate could give away voluntarily its power 
 
 over confirmations, its power over the budget to remind the fiscal year started in October. We don't have a budget. We just have continuing 
 
 resolution, possibly until next March, and its power over declaring wars, which hasn't been exercised for years.
 
And so, you know, we don't want no first Article One branch of government, do we? And if I'm a senator, I would want to be in a role that had power. 
 
 So I might wait a bit, just thought experiment, wait a bit to get full information before deciding.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes. I mean, do you really think we could see a government shutdown around the holidays? I mean, just two weeks from now.
 
HARMAN: No, no. We're going to have a CR. Everyone I talk to says that.
 
But understand what that does. That is so inefficient, think the DOGE committee. So ineffective, it locks in last year's levels of spending. Any 
 
 new starts, any reforms don't happen because they aren't funded.
 <br>[12:40:58]
 
And, you know, when I think about the Pentagon as an example, I just chaired this commission on a national defense strategy, there's so much 
 
 change we need to make. And Congress was ahead of the ball a little bit on some of this, but it ain't going to happen until late March now. Hopefully 
 
 we'll have a secretary defense by then and a cabinet, which I think we will, but I don't think all the cabinet picks are yet set.
 
And my only plea is, please pick people who are capable of handling the hard jobs that they will be given.
 
GOLODRYGA: OK. So I'll give you three names and yes or no. Are they capable in your view and from those that you talk to and handling the hard jobs. We 
 
 start with Pete Hegseth, Tulsi Gabbard at DNI, and then RFK Jr. at HHS.
 
HARMAN: I don't have a vote. And some of my best friends do. And so I'm punting on this thing. I'm saying please hold your fire until you read what 
 
 the FBI has to say. Some of the press reports on these folks are not too flattering, but that's politics. You've got to take a punch.
 
But if they are not capable and they have things in their backgrounds that make them really bad, irresponsible choices, vote -- put the country first, 
 
 not your political party, not your reelection. It's really important now, and we have a strong history of this, not in recent years, but it's really 
 
 important now that Congress be as effective as its mandate should make it.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes. It will be interesting with Tulsi Gabbard, in particular, given the time of Assad's fall now in her past sympathies and visits with 
 
 him. Go ahead.
 
HARMAN: No. There's a concern there because our liaison relationships, that is what we learn from other intel services, not just the Five Eyes, which 
 
 are the countries closest to the U.S., so-called Five Eyes, Canada, U.K., Australia, and New Zealand, plus us, but others.
 
I mean, even think Israel. Israel and we have shared intelligence for years. If they won't share intelligence because they're worried about 
 
 sources and methods being compromised, that's hugely dangerous for us getting a complete picture so that we can advise, that's what the 
 
 intelligence community -- 
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes.
 
HARMAN: -- does, policymakers, including the president. So he has a whole picture before he makes a decision.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes. And RFK, Jr. will be on the Hill next week meeting with senators as well. We'll be following it all closely.
 
Jane Harman, please come back soon. It's so great to see you.
 
HARMAN: Good to see you too. Happy holidays.
 
GOLODRYGA: You too.
 
And still to come for us, we have special coverage of Call to Earth Day, including at an elementary school in California.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JULIA VARGAS JONES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: I'm Julia Vargas Jones, and I'm here in Cerritos, California, Bragg Elementary, with the green team. 
 
 And I'll tell you more about who these kids are and how they're caring for their environment after the break.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:45:24]
 
GOLODRYGA: Welcome back. We're returning to our Call to Earth Day coverage.
 
Thousands of students around the globe engaged in a day of action to help save the planet they are inheriting. We have correspondents filing reports 
 
 from around the world, including Beijing, Nairobi, London, and Miami.
 
Our theme this year is connected generations. We'll be looking to the wisdom of our ancestors for sustainable living practices and how we can use 
 
 that in our daily lives.
 
Let's start in Cerritos, California, near Los Angeles, CNN's Julia Vargas Jones is at Bragg Elementary School.
 
Julia, I understand they run a zero-waste lunch that fuels a pollinator garden. What does that even mean? Walk us through it.
 
JONES: Well, let me show you, Bianna. This is the pollinator garden right here. You see all these kids are just so eager to show us their work.
 
I'm going to start by talking to Skyler (sph). She's a fifth grader. And, Skyler, talk to me. Why is it that your school has this garden in the first 
 
 place?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We have this garden because we want to try to attract pollinators such as bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds. We want them to 
 
 come here because if they go on one plant, they collect the pollen, then they go to another flower. Then they go to a flower over there, then to 
 
 another garden, and that's how everything grows.
 
JONES: And we have seen already so many hummingbirds in this garden. I'll tell you, Bianna.
 
And here is Wyatt (ph) who's going to tell us a little bit more. How is it, Wyatt, that and what have you learned here about how pollination works?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What I have learned is that when a -- when a pollinator goes onto one plant, they pick up some pollen. And then when they go to the 
 
 next plant, so that pollen gets off, and that's how we produce some fruit.
 
JONES: That's right. Oh, I'm going to walk around here. This is a little treacherous.
 
And over here at Camden, you work in this garden almost every week at least. Tell us what is your favorite part about being part of the green 
 
 team?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My favorite part about being the green team is helping out after school with kids and teachers to help pull out weeds, rake 
 
 leaves, and fill pollinator stations.
 
JONES: Like these ones. These are where we've been seeing some hummingbirds coming in and out. You said -- earlier you said to me that they -- you lure 
 
 them in with the water?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
 
JONES: And then they end up actually helping pollinate, right?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
 
JONES: That's amazing.
 
And then finally, this is Ethan. Ethan, tell me why is it that in the pollinator garden, we're seeing flowers, but we're also seeing some 
 
 succulents.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There's some succulents here because we need to save water for the people that don't have access to like, you know, the clean 
 
 water. And it also like makes dew, which drops down into soil, which makes new plants. It's basically a life cycle.
 
JONES: I'm definitely going to use that tip for my garden at home, Bianna.
 
Again, this is also fueled by their zero-waste lunch they have. So the compost that they take from their lunch that actually use to in this garden 
 
 to help bring these pollinators that are so important for our ecosystem here in Southern California.
 
GOLODRYGA: I mean, I am just blown away, Julia, taking notes from how knowledgeable these students are about gardening, about the environment. 
 
 It's really, really inspiring.
 
Thank you so much for introducing us to those brilliant children in Cerritos, California.
 
Well, in Uganda, we're learning about a critical lake that has suffered from overfishing. The local people are turning to the traditional laws of 
 
 their elders to keep the lake healthy and using ancient farming methods for better crops.
 
CNN's Victoria Rubadiri has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
VICTORIA RUBADIRI, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Fisherman's boats rock back and forth in the afternoon waters of Lake 
 
 Albert in Northern Uganda.
 
The freshwater lake supports a population of nearly 2.5 million people here.
 
RUBADIRI: However, Lake Mwitanzige, as it was originally known before the colonialists renamed it Lake Albert, holds far more sentimental and 
 
 spiritual value to the people that live off of it.
 
RUBADIRI (voice-over): They are known as the Bagungu people. And here in Uganda, there are one of the few communities that observe the ancient 
 
 wisdom that governs how they treat and protect their environment.
 
BARNABUS BAGADIRA KAKULA (ph), CUSTODIAN (through translator): We had specific days and seasons for fishing. We look at the moon. When it comes, 
 
 they go to fish. When it disappears, they stop fishing.
 <br>[12:50:03]
 
In our traditional laws, we don't catch young fish. But now, even the fully grown ones aren't there because the fish stocks are reducing.
 
RUBADIRI (voice-over): Such laws that were meant to stop harmful activities, like overfishing, were abandoned during colonialism and deemed 
 
 backward.
 
In recent years, though, the elders, who were the only custodians of these customary laws, began slowly returning to them and even passing them down 
 
 to the next generation. These elders drew these ecological maps that detail the Bagungu's landscapes and ecosystem. 
 
The women farmers have managed to restore the indigenous seeds their ancestors used to plant. They found them to be a far more sustainable 
 
 option to the hybrid varieties most smallholder farmers plant.
 
The natural pest control methods used generations ago have proven to still be relevant today and effective in ensuring healthy crop harvests.
 
DORCAS KANCOLE (ph), FARMER (through translator): The current generation is not aware of this ancient knowledge. Many are not interested in farming, 
 
 but we are passing down the knowledge to those who will learn.
 
RESSON KANTAI DUFF, DIRECTOR, PORTFOLIO FUNDING: You find in many spaces that indigenous knowledge is being codified a lot more. We're looking at 
 
 cultures that are working on new regenerative agricultural practices that are based on some of that wisdom.
 
The seeds that they are saving and sharing among them, for example, are things that are now being written about. And they are being put into a much 
 
 more serious body of work that is allowing indigenous people to find their space and their visibility.
 
RUBADIRI (voice-over): Back in 2020, the Bagungu's customary law practices were codified in Ugandan law, a first-of-its-kind adoption of indigenous 
 
 knowledge by an African government. 
 
Dennis Tabaro has walked this journey over the last seven years, helping the Bagungu revive their ancient wisdom. Their efforts now paying off.
 
DENNIS TABARO, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, AFRICAN INSTITUTE FOR CULTURE AND ECOLOGY: Some animals, we are told, have come back. About six years ago, 
 
 when we came here, those rivers were dry.
 
So when the communities and elders started their -- performing these rituals and ceremonies, then the rain came in time. We can see some of the 
 
 rivers.
 
RUBADIRI (voice-over): The ancient knowledge of the Bagungu has certainly stood the test of time, surviving colonialism and most recently, the 
 
 discovery of oil in their region.
 
And now, with the ever-present threat climate change poses to their ecosystem, the Bagungu are even more determined to keep their culture of 
 
 conservation alive.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
GOLODRYGA: And you can learn more about Call to Earth Day and how students around the world are taking action at cnn.com/call to earth.
 
And we will be right back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
GOLODRYGA: Well, this time every year Google publishes a list highlighting some of its top trending online searches across the world. This may not 
 
 come as much of a surprise, but the U.S. election was at the top trending news search.
 
In the world of entertainment, "Inside Out 2" was the top film. And "Not Like Us" was the top trending song.
 
In sport, Copa America and the UEFA European Championship were googled the most.
 <br>[12:55:05]
 
Well, the popular South Korean sharpshooter who won a silver medal at the Paris Olympic Games is now one of the latest stars of a French luxury 
 
 handbag advertising campaign. 
 
Remember Kim Ye-ji's seemingly effortless shooting style during the Olympics? Well, now she's conquering another quest, and that is fashion. 
 
 She's posing here for a new Balenciaga handbag campaign. She has also landed a few acting gigs since winning silver at the games.
 
Well, his music has lasted for generations. Sir Elton John has now been named "Time Magazine's" Icon of the Year. The 77-year-old who recently 
 
 revealed that his eyesight has continued to decline following an eye infection is an activist and philanthropist, as well as one of the world's 
 
 best known musicians.
 
He rose to fame in the early 1970s and is known for hits like "Rocket Man" and "Candle in the Wind." His Farewell Yellow Brick Road Tour grossed over 
 
 $900 million, a world record, until that is Taylor Swift came along. I am such a fan of Sir Elton John, so well deserved.
 
Well, that does it for this hour of ONE WORLD. Thanks so much for watching. I'm Bianna Golodryga. "AMANPOUR" is up next.
