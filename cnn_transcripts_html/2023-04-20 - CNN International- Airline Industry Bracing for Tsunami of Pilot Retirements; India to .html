BIANCA NOBILO, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome back to CNN NEWSROOM I'm Bianca Nobilo. 
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR: I'm Max Foster. If you're just joining us, let me bring up to date with our top stories this hour. 
 
Officials are investigating crowd surge in Yemen that left at least 78 people dead. It happened whilst local merchants were handing out money to people at the Ramadan charity event. The victims were hoping to receive a donation worth about US$10. 
 
The U.S. Supreme court has decided to temporarily extend access to the abortion pill mifepristone until Friday at midnight. That's when they are expected to issue a decision on a Texas judge's ruling to ban the drug. 
 
NOBILO: The pilot shortage in the U.S. is already in dire straits and it's expected to get a lot worse in the coming years. That's the word from some airline industry officials who testified before a congressional hearing on Wednesday. Here's CNN's Pete Muntean with more. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PETE MUNTEAN, CNN AVIATION CORRESPONDENT: Bianca, Max, the alarm bells about the airline pilot shortage are only getting louder now. The head of the Regional Airline Association that represents the smaller airlines that operate flights between small cities and big hubs, says that in the next 15 years 50 percent of all airline pilots will be forced to retire. That means delays and cancelations, he says, will go up. The number of flights will go down and some cities will lose service entirely. 
 
There are some controversial solutions emerging here. And Faye Malarkey Black, the head of the Regional Airline Pilots Association, nods her head to the fact that there could be a raising of the retirement age right now. The mandatory retirement for airline pilots is set at 65. 
 <br>[04:35:00] It could go up to 67 or there could be a change at the bottom for new airline pilots changing the requirement be 1,500 hours that they need to start at a regional airline. 
 
Everybody agrees that there are challenges here. But the top union representing airline pilots says there is not a pilot shortage, only a training backlog right now. 
 
JASON AMBROSI, PRESIDENT, AIRLINE PILOTS ASSOCIATION INTERNATIONAL: Help us around the corner. Pilots are training as fast as they can. So, we do need to get -- as we said previously -- keep outreach, get more people involved in this, more diverse backgrounds. But the pilot supply is good. 
 
FAYE MALARKEY BLACK, PRESIDENT AND CEO, REGIONAL AIRLINE ASSOCIATION: Some say there is no pilot shortage just a pay shortage. Regional airlines starting pay averages $100,000 for pilots, bonuses can exceed $125,000. 500 jets are parked. Pay hasn't solved this. We need better career access. 
 
MUNTEAN: The bottom line here, Bianca and Max, is that it's a great time to learn to fly, especially if you're a young person. The statistics cited by the regional airline association, those under 30 represent only about 8 percent of all commercial airline pilots right now -- Bianca Max.

FOSTER: Now it can often be confusing what counts as carry on items and what needs to be checked in as baggage when you fly, but U.S. Transportation Authorities have a piece of advice. If you can bludgeon someone, you can't carry it on. 
 
NOBILO: Reasonable advice. That distinction was made after security in Idaho found a Shalala in someone's carry on. That's an Irish walking stick, also known as a Gaelic club, and it's just one of the items shed on Twitter as part of the Transportation Security Administration's prohibited items week. 
 
These are all looking obvious.
 
FOSTER: Quite obvious. 
 
Just into CNN. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg is on a visit to the Ukrainian capital. Arriving in Kyiv a short while ago, his first visit to the country since the war began against Russia. It comes as NATO is wrapping up its annual arms control conference, which is being held in Washington this year. 
 
On Tuesday, Stoltenberg spoke with our Christiane Amanpour, saying NATO allies needs to even more to get weapons and supplies to Ukraine. 
 
NOBILO: India's population will soon surpass China's -- according to the United Nations -- by the middle of this year. U.N. data indicates both nations will have more than 1.4 billion people, with India edging ahead by nearly 3 million. FOSTER: The two countries already account for one third of the global
 
 population. It could mean tough times ahead for India, though, because already is stretched to the limit trying to make enough jobs for the unemployed. 
 
Vedika Sud joins us from New Delhi. I mean, it's really a seismic moment this isn't it? But how will the country cope? 
 
VEDIKA SUD, CNN REPORTER: Good question there, Max. And this is an undesirable global title that India clearly doesn't want, but it has come its way. And it's very important to understand and put this into perspective. It's not that India's population growth has been going up leaps and bounds, in fact, the population growth of both China and India have been going down. It's been decreasing at a slow pace, especially China over the last year. You've had those discussions with our correspondents there as well. 
 
But there's a stark contrast and it's very important to understand that and here's what it is. In India over 60 percent of the population is under the age of 30. That makes it a massive workforce community that's raring to go to work. But of course, opportunities need to come their way. 
 
But with China that labor force has been shrinking. They have people who are now of retirement age or beyond and that population of the older generation is only increasing by the year in China. 
 
Now very quickly, I just want to put up a few graphics for you. According to the United Nations, India's population growth will continue to increase until the year 2060. That's when it's actually going to cross 1.7 billion. It stands at 1.4 billion currently. Staggering growth fest, staggering numbers. But also, let's just try and understand what's really left to this and what are the numbers that we're talking about when it comes to India. 
 
Well, India's population has grown by a billion over the last 73 years. That's where it stands. Along with that, like I said, you have more than half of India's population under the age of 30. And more than 40 percent of India's population under the age of 25. The birth rate is going down. 
 
But this is the crux of it. India has an opportunity here to make the most of its dynamic young population under the age of 30 -- 60 percent like I said. But economists say this is an opportunity for policymakers to make or break when it comes to providing employment opportunities. Here's what an economist had to say to us. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KAUSHIK BASU, FORMER WORLD BANK CHIEF ECONOMIST: The population is growing and the working age population is growing. If that category of people do not find that of employment, then what was meant to be an opportunity, the bulge in that demographic dividend so called, could become a huge challenge and problem for India. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) [04:40:04]
 
SUD: So, these numbers could be a liability for India. All lies now on policy makers. This is, of course, a symbolic milestone. But what will India make of it? How will capitalize on this huge, booming workforce? Is the question. Back to you -- Max.
 
FOSTER: OK, Vedika, thank you so much for joining us from New Delhi. 
 
NOBILO: Well, people with type two diabetes drink could impact how long they live, and we're not talking about alcohol. A new study shows that those who consume coffee, tea or plain water, maybe lower their risk of premature death from any cause by 25 percent. 
 
FOSTER: However, type two diabetics who drink more sugar sweet beverages like soda and fruit juices have a 25 percent higher risk of heart disease and an almost 30 percent higher risk of dying from a heart attack. 
 
NOBILO: This is in our series involving exercise, don't eat fast food and drink healthy things.
 
FOSTER: I won't call you a bit earlier today.
 
NOBILO: Yes.
 
FOSTER: More later on in the show. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: A group of leading global scientists and academics have signed a open letter urging Uganda's president to veto a hardline bill criminalizing homosexuality in the country. 
 
NOBILO: CNN's Stephanie Busari is covering this story from Lagos for us. Stephanie, is this letter likely to move the dial at all in terms of public opinion on what the government might do? 
 
STEPHANIE BUSARI, CNN SENIOR EDITOR, AFRICA: Good morning, Bianca. Well, it's unlikely, some say, because of what President Museveni has said in the past about homosexuals both on CNN and in the country. He's called them deviants. 
 
But he did call for this letter. He said he has to make a decision today on whether to veto or sign this bill into law. And he wanted to know, is this a nature or natural debate? 
 <br>[04:45:00]
 
And scientists have responded to him in no uncertain terms that it is completely normal to be homosexual, and it is a normal variant of human sexuality. Whether that will sway President Museveni's decision is -- remains to be seen. That will come later today. But a lot of people are telling us that Uganda is already very anti -- very homophobic and very anti-gay. It's already actually illegal to be in the same sex relationships in Uganda. And what this bill actually does is simply by saying that you are a
 
 lesbian or gay or transgender, you are going to face up to 20 years in prison. So, it's a very harsh law and many are fearing that, whatever his decision, it states that once said homophobia that will make their life more intolerable -- Bianca. 
 
NOBILO: Stephanie Busari live in Lagos for us. Thank you. 
 
FOSTER: In Sudan, a second ceasefire in as many days has fallen apart just hours after it started. Witnesses are reporting more violent clashes today. Police in the capital of Khartoum are afraid to leave their homes and are running low on food and water as well. 
 
NOBILO: The World Health Organization says nearly 300 people have been killed since fighting broke out on Saturday. The army claims rival paramilitary forces are acting like gangs attacking and looting homes and businesses. 
 
Thousands of people are fleeing the capital for safer parts of the country if they can. And foreign governments are desperate to evacuate their citizens. 
 
Ukraine says that Russia has launched dozens of air strikes in the past 24 hours using both missiles and drones.
 
FOSTER: And Nick Paton Walsh reports one missile landed dangerously close to him and his team. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NICK PATON WALSH, CNN INTERNATIONAL SECURITY EDITOR (voiceover): Close to Ukraine's imminent counter offensive in the southeast, where Russia has long been brutalizing, pain is commonplace, and the damage often everywhere and indiscriminate. The quiet is a blessing that rarely lasts.
 
We're warned of a missile strike in coming and leave. We can feel the pressure from the blast just behind our armored car.
 
WALSH: Nat, can you hear me?
 
WALSH (voice-over): Natalie Gallon, our producer, is in our second vehicle just passed the smoke --
 
WALSH: Nat, can you hear me? 
 
WALSH (voice-over): -- with driver Igor Muggeridge (ph) and isn't answering. 
 
WALSH: Nat, can you hear me?
 
WALSH (voiceover): The missile landed right between our cars.
 
WALSH: Nat, can you hear me? Nat, can you hear me?
 
WALSH (voiceover): For 10 seconds we have no idea if they are alive. WALSH: She just said something. Nat, can you hear me? 
 
NATALIE GALLON, CNN PRODUCER: Yes, I can hear you. Are you guys, OK?
 
WALSH:  We're fine, just leave, drive out the way we left.
 
WALSH (voiceover): We leave together. For so many that choice of leaving is something imaginary that happens above ground. The only power and water in town are down here.
 
WALSH: Our life on the ground here has been hard for quite some time, but it will get harder when the counter offensive begins pushing certainly in this direction.
 
WALSH (voiceover): If there is space for laughter is from this. A screechy slapstick Soviet era comedy about a drunken goofball, briefly bending the fixed set grimaces here.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translated text): Today wasn't quiet.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translated text): Morning? Uh-huh.
 
They bomb, planes bomb. With all arms they hit us, they try everything. It's very noisy, day and night.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translated text): At home? If I am with God, with Jesus Christ, who protects us, cares for us, with the guardian angels, we endure.
 
WALSH (voice-over): Guardian angels seem here to flit by in a town where 50 died in the war, and 200 were injured. Safety is just a word here. And rubble is a place. 
 
Nick Paton Walsh, CNN, Orikhiv, Ukraine.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
FOSTER: Some fly faster than a speeding bullets. But the Pentagon doesn't know what they are. What the U.S. military is now saying about the increasing number of UFO sightings. 
 <br>[04:50:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
NOBILO: No Ja Morant. No problem for the Memphis Grizzlies. The home team got a career high 22 points from Xavier Tillman to beat the Los Angeles Lakers. The series is now tied at one game apiece. 
 
LeBron James led the Lakers with 28 points. Morant was scratched about an hour before and took off with a hand injury. 
 
FOSTER: And now to Milwaukee where Brook Lopez led the Bucks with 25 points and a game two victory over the Heat. Jimmy Butler led Miami with 25 points. That series is now tied at one game each. NOBILO: And in Denver, it was Jamal Murray's night to shine. He
 
 finished with 40 points and helped the Nuggets survive a fourth quarter comeback by the Minnesota Timberwolves. Anthony Edwards had 41 for the Wolves. Denver now leads the series two games to none. 
 
SpaceX will try again in the coming hours to launch its largest craft called the Starship. 
 
FOSTER: The first attempt was scrapped on Monday after technical problems. So, the company owned by Elon Musk has another launch window several hours from now. Starship is the most powerful rocket ever created. It could one day take astronauts back to the moon and take part in future Mars missions as well. 
 
And now the other stories we're looking at this hour. The Pentagon still doesn't know what hundreds of unidentified flying objects are, despite the U.S. military experts saying the number of UFO sightings it's investigating is increasing -- 650 right now. That's up from 510 last year. 
 
NOBILO: But for those who might be worried or even excited that there may be space aliens among us already -- I do wonder. The Pentagon says that this is not Independence Day. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[04:55:00]
 
SEAN KILPATRICK, DIRECTOR, PENTAGON ALL-DOMAIN ANOMALY RESOLUTION OFFICE: I should also state clearly for the record that in our research ARO has found no credible evidence thus far of extraterrestrial activity, off world technology or objects that defy the known laws of physics. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NOBILO: But this was a "Men in Black" situation -- you might be one of those walking among us. You're very tall with a distinctly shaped head. While the Pentagon acknowledges it doesn't know what many of the images show it says that there is concern for at least some of them might be tested advanced technology from potential adversaries such as Russia or China. 
 
FOSTER: Earlier this week, fast food giant McDonald's announced it was adding more of its special sauce to Big Mac Burgers. But if that's not enough, you may soon get extra sauce on the side. 
 
NOBILO: Starting next week, but for a limited time only customers, using the McDonald's app can order a side of secret sauce in a special dip cup. It's available only at participating --
 
FOSTER: Don't accuse us of not bringing them the important stuff. 
 
NOBILO: Exactly. And what is a special dip cup? One wonders. 
 
FOSTER: Well, we'll have to find out, one week only. NOBILO: The "Twilight" saga like it's a vampire characters is not
 
 quite dead. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right from the start, I knew that I found, a friend ...
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NOBILO: A television series is in the works based on the popular fantasy romance novels by Stephenie Meyer. Who, Max, you interviewed. Who is expected to be involved with the show. 
 
FOSTER: The movies based on the books and made overnight celebrities of its stars Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lap. And I'm sorry about all this intimacy so early in the day for many people around the world. All of them combined drew more than a billion dollars at the box office. No word yet on where or when the new show will be released.
 
NOBILO: It is making me feel a bit sick bringing up my matcha. 
 
FOSTER: Thanks for joining us here on CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Max Foster.
 
NOBILO: And I'm Bianca Nobilo. "EARLY START" is up next right here on CNN.
