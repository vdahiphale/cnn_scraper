JACK SMITH, SPECIAL COUNSEL: The men and women of law enforcement who defended the U.S. Capitol on January 6th are heroes. They're patriots and they're the very best of us. 
 
They did not just defend a building or the people sheltering in it, they put their lives on the line to defend who we are as a country and as a people. They defended the very institutions and principles that define the United States.

JIM SCIUTTO, CNN HOST: That was Special Counsel Jack Smith as he announced Donald Trump's latest indictment. Here is what defending their country looked like for officers on January 6th.

SCIUTTO: That was D.C. Police Officer Daniel Hodges, crushed and screaming in a revolving door, crushed by a pro-Trump mob in a tunnel leading into the U.S. Capitol. 
 
Outside, a rioter pummeled another officer with a flagpole as he was being dragged down the steps of the Capitol. 
 
The Justice Department said about 140 officers were assaulted that day. Among them, Caroline Edwards, of the Capitol Police. She testified to Congress she was knocked out during the riot, only to come to and then be teargassed.

OFC. CAROLINE EDWARDS, U.S. CAPITOL POLICE DEPARTMENT: There were officers on the ground, you know, they were bleeding. They were throwing up. They were, you know, they had -- I mean, I saw friends with blood all over their faces. I was slipping in people's blood. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SCIUTTO: The Justice Department arrested 1,069 people for the Capitol insurrection. Of them, 350 defendants were accused of assaulting, impeding or resisting officers. 
 
And of those accused of opposing officers, at least 51 were convicted. Another 104 defendants pleaded guilty. 
 
Joining me now, CNN senior law enforcement analyst, Charles Ramsey. He led the police forces here in Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia. 
 
Chief Ramsey, there has been some criticism from Republicans that this indictment, these indictments are weak, because they're based merely on lies that the president told that day, on January 6th, and leading up to it. 
 
You, of course, led police officers here. As you look again at the violence committed against them, in addition to against the institution, were those lies, was Trump himself then, responsible for what we saw that day? 
 
CHARLES RAMSEY, CNN SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST: First of all, the special counsel was absolutely right, the men and women of law enforcement were, in fact, heroes that day. 
 <br>[13:35:03]
 
And I hope we never forget the actions that they took to defend the capital. I think that's very important. 
 
People would not have been at the Capitol on January 6th had it not been for Donald Trump and had it not been for some of his allies. They would not have been there. And certainly, in my opinion, would not have attacked the U.S. Capitol. So, we'll see how it plays out in court. 
 
But I don't pay much attention to politicians blowing hot air about things like this. Let the courts, let the justice system do what it needs to do. 
 
SCIUTTO: How do officers who served that day, in your experience, view this investigation, and these charges? Do they view them as politically motivated or do they view them as a process, a legal process, to hold Trump and others accountable? 
 
RAMSEY: Well, I would imagine you have a variety of opinions, but I would hope that they see this as a legal process that will result in accountability, should it be demonstrated and proven that he, in fact, did commit the crimes that he is charged with. 
 
The same with any co-conspirators that are there. 
 
As a police officer, you have to try to stay as objective as possible, and let the system do its job. But I imagine, like everyone else in America, you have a variety of opinions. 
 
But as a police officer, you have to be objective, just do your job.
 
The same thing will apply tomorrow when the former president comes in to be arraigned. Officers assigned there will do their job, do their duty. That's really what they're there for. 
 
SCIUTTO: Before the violence of January 6th, of course, the president for weeks had been attacking the system, the election had been stolen from him, others were standing in his way. There was that rhetoric. 
 
Here we are now on the cusp next year of another election. The president is, again, attacking multiple institutions, including the Justice Department, the special counsel here. 
 
As someone like yourself, who led police forces, who did their best to protect cities, including the capital city here in Washington, are you concerned that his rhetoric, once again, could fuel violent attacks? 
 
RAMSEY: I am concerned. There is no question about that. And that's why it is so important that law enforcement pay real close attention to the threat picture. 
 
I'm sure that's what they're doing for tomorrow's arraignment. But you have to do it throughout this entire process. 
 
I was thinking about the vice president, for example, the former Vice President Pence. What is going to happen in terms of his security as he's on the campaign trail? 
 
There are issues that need to be addressed. They will be addressed. And it is a concern. 
 
The more the former president stirs the pot, and you have a lot of people that believe in him, that don't see what he's saying as being lies, then the bigger the challenge it is to keep everyone safe and secure.
 
Whether we're talking about having safe, secure elections or the physical safety of those people who are running for office, on either the Republican or Democratic side. 
 
SCIUTTO: Yes, there is a reason many of them ask for additional security in the wake of January 6th. 
 
Chief Charles Ramsey, thanks so much. 
 
Brianna? 
 
BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: Hollywood studios have asked writers back to the negotiating table. They are the first known talks since the strike began. So is it a breakthrough on the horizon? 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[13:42:57] KEILAR: The gunman responsible for the 2018 shooting massacre at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh just learned his fate. A federal jury is calling for the death penalty in the sentencing of Robert Bowers. 
 
Let's go straight now to CNN's Danny Freeman who is in Pittsburgh covering all of this. He has more on this developing story. 
 
Danny, what more do we know? 
 
DANNY FREEMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Brianna, after more than nine weeks of trial, more than 100 witnesses called, and the jury took just 10 hours to deliberate over two days to come up with that sentence. 
 
The jury of five men and seven women recommending a sentence of death for 50-year-old Robert Bowers. Of course, that is for the massacre at the Tree of Life Synagogue that happened in October of 2018. 
 
There were three congregations, 11 people were killed, many more were injured, including officers and other congregants. 
 
I think one of the most surprising things, one of the most stunning things we saw from the courtroom today as the verdict was being read is the jurors really dispelled completely the arguments that the defense had mounted. 
 
The jurors did not buy any alternate theories for motive. There were no delusions that the jury said were present here. 
 
Zero jurors said Bowers had schizophrenia, one of the larger points of the defense's case. The jurors also showed skepticism and were divided over a history of attempted suicides and mental health in general. 
 
In contrast, the jury really clearly agreed with the prosecution that this was a preplanned attack, that this was motivated purely by a systematic hatred of Jews.
 
And that Robert Bowers showed no remorse, not only at the time, but also in the years since this attack. 
 
And, Brianna, I want to release a statement. We are finally getting some reaction from the families who were impacted that day, nearly five years ago. 
 
And 97-year-old Rose Mallinger, she was one of the victims shot and killed at the synagogue. Her daughter, Andrea Wedner, was there with her. She survived the shooting.
 
And we have a statement that I'm going to read, in part, from the Wedner/Mallinger family. 
 <br>[13:44:59]
 
It reads, "This sentence is a testament to our justice system, and a message to all that this type of heinous act will not be tolerated." The statement continues, "Returning a sentence of death is not a
 
 decision that comes easy, but we must hold accountable those who wish to commit such terrible acts of anti-Semitism, hate and violence." 
 
So, Brianna, here's what's going to happen next. We're going to hear from members of the family on camera at around 2:30. We're going to hear from the prosecution in a few minutes behind me at the federal courthouse. 
 
But I asked the defense if they had any comment on this defeat today. They did not comment to our cameras when we asked -- Brianna? 
 
KEILAR: All right, Danny Freeman, live for us from Pittsburgh, thank you for that.
 
Jim? 
 
SCIUTTO: Now to some of the other headlines we're watching this hour.
 
A wildfire burning across southern California and Nevada is threatening thousands of rare trees that don't grow anywhere else in the world. The York Fire already burned more than 82,000 acres, making it California's largest so far this year. 
 
And it is burning right in the path of thousands of Joshua trees, which scientists say could take a lifetime to grow back. Officials say the fire is now 30 percent contained. It could be slowing down. 
 
Also, nearly 100 days into the Hollywood writers' strike, both sides are heading back to the negotiating table. The Writers Guild says the studios have requested a meeting for this Friday. 
 
The sticking points that led to the strike, including pay, streaming rights, also artificial intelligence, its impact. 
 
Some pharmacies are taking steps to help avoid another triple-demic. Chains like CVS and Walgreens are offering customers their annual flu shots a bit early. Walgreens is also offering the new RSV vaccine for eligible older Americans. 
 
This, as the CEO of Pfizer says he expects the company's updated Covid-19 booster shot to be made available next month. 
 
Lots of shots. 
 
KEILAR: Lots of shots. 
 
Two of the indictments hanging over former President Trump have one common denominator and that is Jack Smith, the special counsel, who has secured both federal criminal indictments against Trump. So who is he? 
 
CNN's Brian Todd is here with some answers. 
 
Brian, walk us through his career. BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Brianna, Donald Trump has been
 
 frustrated enough with Jack Smith over the years to lash out at Smith on more than one occasion. He has called him deranged Jack Smith on at least one occasion. 
 
But Smith does have a long record of investigations as a prosecutor, usually keeping a low profile and with some mixed results. 
 
In the 1990s, he served as prosecutor at the U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn. There, he won some tough cases against gang members and crooked police officers. 
 
He had two stints as the chief prosecutor for the special court in the Hague, investigating war crimes in Kosovo. 
 
He's also served as an acting U.S. attorney for the middle district of Tennessee. 
 
Those are some of the high-profile jobs earlier in his career -- Brianna? 
 
KEILAR: And that brings us to his most recent stop at the Justice Department. 
 
TODD: That's right. We should point out this is his second stint at the Justice Department. 
 
He was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland last November to take over the two investigations involving Donald Trump, which led, of course, to these two federal indictments of Trump. 
 
But earlier, he led the DOJ's Public Integrity Unit. That was from 2010 to 2015. As part of that, that's where he had some setbacks. 
 
He investigated Democratic Senator Bob Menendez from New Jersey. He was indicted on corruption charges. But that case ended in a mistrial. Also a judge kind of separately acquitted Senator Menendez. 
 
Smith also oversaw an investigation into former House majority leader, Tom DeLay, a Republican, but that probe ended with no charges being brought. 
 
And he headed that division of justice when the Justice Department investigated and failed to convict former Senator and vice presidential candidate, John Edwards, in a corruption case in 2012. 
 
So, Brianna, a lot of high-profile cases. Kind of paling in comparison to what he's about to go through. And we'll see how endures this enormous pressure. 
 
KEILAR: Remember when the cases were giant deals, right? 
 
TODD: Yes, I do remember that. 
 
KEILAR: That does sort of put things into perspective. 
 
Brian Todd, thank you so much. 
 
TODD: Thanks.
 
KEILAR: Jim? 
 
SCIUTTO: And cases against Democratic and Republican lawmakers, we should note. 
 
Now that you know more about the special counsel, what about the federal judge assigned to Trump's case? Details on her background and how she is no stranger to other defendants from January 6th. 
 <br>[13:49:15]
 
Plus, a new study shows how artificial intelligence offers huge promise when it comes to screenings for breast cancer. Details when CNN NEWS CENTRAL returns. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
SCIUTTO: We've, of course, heard the nightmare scenarios for A.I., but could A.I. also save lives? A new study has found that artificial intelligence can detect more cases of breast cancer than doctors even with years of training and experience. 
 
Radiologists who used A.I. discovered 20 percent more cases of breast cancer than those reading the scans without it. 
 
CNN medical correspondent, Meg Tirrell, is with us now. 
 
Meg, that's notable because it shows, in effect, that this can add some value here. 
 
MEG TIRRELL, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that is the hope. What we've seen already is that there were suggestions about this, but this is the first trial that actually set out to study this itself. 
 
And what they did was look at 80,000 women in Sweden, and they separated them into two groups, one that had their mammograms looked at with A.I. supporting radiologists and another one that just had two radiologists alone looking at the images. 
 <br>[13:55:02]
 
And what they found is that for every 1,000 women screened, six cancers were picked up in the group with the doctors helped by A.I. versus five for doctors alone. 
 
What they also found was there was not an increased rate of false positives. So they weren't over-detecting cancer that wasn't there. 
 
On top of that, they found that this reduced the work that doctors had on their plates by 44 percent in this trial. 
 
And of course, this was done in Europe, where traditionally two radiologists are looking at every screen. That is not the case in the United States. So that reduced workload may not be quite the same. 
 
But this really is expected to potentially be a helpful tool -- Jim? 
 
SCIUTTO: Let me ask you, to be clear, this is doctors working in conjunction with A.I. as opposed to A.I. replacing doctors, is that right? 
 
TIRRELL: Yes, there's been a lot of talk about doctors getting replaced by A.I. And you're exactly right. This is really helping them. 
 
And this is something that the field is saying could be really welcome because there's a shortage of radiologists. And breast cancer incidence rates have been rising by about half a percentage point every year in the United States. 
 
So more and more people need to get imaging done. If they can reduce the workload, it would help a lot. 
 
SCIUTTO: And we know from the data it saves lives. Those screenings do. 
 
Meg Tirrell, in New York, thanks so much. 
 
Brianna? 
 
KEILAR: Ahead, when court dates and a 2024 campaign collide. How Trump's legal battles could impact his run for the White House.
