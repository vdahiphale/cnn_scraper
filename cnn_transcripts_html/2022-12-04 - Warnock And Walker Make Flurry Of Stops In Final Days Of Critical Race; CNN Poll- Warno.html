FREDRICKA WHITFIELD, CNN ANCHOR: Hello, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me this Sunday. I'm Fredricka Whitfield. It is countdown to decision day in Georgia. On Tuesday, the state will select its next U.S. senator and that choice will determine whether Democrats will seize a more solid control of the Senate or remain a 50-50 split with the Vice President having to break tie votes.
 
Incumbent Democrat Raphael Warnock and his challenger Republican Herschel Walker are making their last pitches to voters, holding rallies across the state. Early voting now over in Georgia, more than 1.8 million ballots cast so far. But with just two days remaining before Tuesday's runoff election, it is still anyone's guess as to who will come out on top.
 
CNN's Eva McKend is in Atlanta for us. So Eva, no rest for the campaigns in these final critical moments before Tuesday, right?
 
EVA MCKEND, CNN NATIONAL POLITICS REPORTER: Well, Fred, Senator Warnock has cast outpaced Herschel Walker a bit in these final days yesterday. Herschel Walker didn't hold any public campaign events. He was at a tailgate party where he greeted fans and supporters took photos, but did not give remarks or answer questions from the media.
 
Meanwhile, Senator Warnock held three public events. One of them was for the Asian American community. I think that that is interesting because that really illustrates that here in Georgia, you cannot ignore any demographic, any part of the state. You have to be successful in cities, suburbs, small towns as well. And with black voters, Asian American voters, Latino voters, an all-out effort to get out the vote in all of these communities because the margins are so thin in this battleground state.
 
Take a listen to what he said at that AAPI event last night.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. RAPHAEL WARNOCK (D), GEORGIA: We've seen record voter turnout during the early period. But don't spike the football. Don't dance before you get in the endzone. We've got to take this thing all the way home. If you know somebody who hasn't voted, tell them to vote.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MCKEND: Now, Herschel Walker will return to the campaign trail today in a public event in Loganville central to Walker's argument campaign -- argument for election has been that Senator Warnock is too closely aligned with President Biden and Biden's economic agenda. Meanwhile, Senator Warnock will continue campaigning today in Gainesville and with students in Athens. That's actually Walker's home turf. Athens, of course, where Walker gained his football fame. Fred?
 
WHITFIELD: Right, at the University of Georgia. OK, thank you so much, Eva McKend. Appreciate you.
 
And don't forget, we'll have full coverage of the Georgia runoff race on Election Day starting at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time.
 
All right new today, a massive power outage is still affecting people in North Carolina after what investigators call a, quote, act of violence at multiple sites. CNN's Gloria Pazmino has more for us right now. Gloria, what is going on?
 
GLORIA PAZMINO, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Fred, we're trying to learn more and more and more about this troubling incident in North Carolina. Moore County, that's about 50 miles to the northwest of Fayetteville, and as of this moment, more than 40,000 people are being affected by this power outage.
 
Now, here's what we know so far. It affected several communities across the area starting around 7:00 in the evening last night. And as local authorities began to investigate what was happening, they went out to see why there -- why we were having these power outages, the sheriff posted on Facebook just a short while ago. I want to put up part of what he said, that while they were conducting these investigations, "Utility companies began responding to different substations, and evidence was discovered that indicated that intentional vandalism had occurred at multiple all sites."
 <br>[11:05:02]
 
Now we do not know yet exactly what this intentional vandalism is referring to. That is currently being investigated. But we do know that this is affecting thousands of people across the region. And as you know, Fred, you know, sometimes we take power for granted. But, of course, so many people rely on it for essential things like medical equipment and being able to do their work.
 
We also just got in a tweet from the governor. And I want to also just read that to you because it shows that this is something that the governor is monitoring, what Governor Roy Cooper said, he has spoken with the Duke Energy and state law enforcement officials about the power outages in Moore County. They are investigating and working to return electricity to those impacted. And the Governor saying that the state is currently providing whatever support might be needed.
 
So we are still waiting to learn more about exactly what is behind this alleged vandalism, and also to know how much longer it's going to take for local officials to get the power back on in that area.
 
WHITFIELD: Right. And in addition to those emergency, you know, vulnerabilities for people. I mean, it's cold, it's getting colder, you know, by the day, so that power is, you know, sorely needed.
 
Gloria Pazmino, thank you so much. So for more now, I want to bring in CNN National Security Analyst, Juliette Kayyem. Juliette, good to see you. So, as you hear from Gloria, you know, she's got good information there. But there are still a lot of, you know, questions unanswered. Given what we do know, what's your instinct tell you here?
 
JULIETTE KAYYEM, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Well, this seems purposeful only because electrical companies like Duke electricity, they are pretty good at being able to monitor and to respond to sort of a single outage. And what they have described and are experiencing now is multiple nefarious activity at different locations. So you wonder whether there's an, you know, we always worry about insider threat.
 
But that some group of people simultaneously brought down different nodes of the electrical grid. So what does that mean? It just makes it harder as you were saying, to recover, because you're not looking at a single point, you have to go to multiple points to get the system back up and running.
 
This is impacting a lot of people. It doesn't happen that often. Sabotage of critical infrastructure is something we worry about. And therefore, there is a lot of defenses for. But if someone plans multiple targets, it will take some time for it to come back up.
 
There is a separate issue going on that people will be monitoring online. We're not reporting it yet, but that maybe there is a group that is somewhat taking claim for it. And so that's going to be part of the investigation, which is important because you want to get to motive. Why would someone want the electricity out? Was there an event that they were trying to sabotage?
 
WHITFIELD: So help us understand what are the threads that investigators will be looking for -- 
 
KAYYEM: Yes.
 
WHITFIELD: -- that will give them better detail as to who this group, you know, of actors are, those who are claiming, you know, some responsibility here, whether this is -- 
 
KAYYEM: Yes.
 
WHITFIELD: -- strictly domestic if there are foreign actors.
 
KAYYEM: So, right now, at least the threat stream looks like it might be a domestic group that has a -- that is uncomfortable. And with LGBTQ rights, this is at least where investigators will begin because of some of the representations made by leaders of that group publicly because they think that they're untouchable. It's one of the weirdest aspects of the world we live in now is that people do these things, and then they want to take credit for it.
 
So you're going to start with that group or those people and then figure out. One of the things I'm looking at is, was there an insider threat? Just because to be able to hit multiple nodes and critical infrastructure, it's -- it doesn't take a genius, but it makes it easier if you're looking at insider threat.
 
And then the investigation will go to interviewing those people, figuring out what communications were going on. While that investigation is going on, you're simultaneously trying to get the electricity back up because it is winter, it's the holidays. People want their electricity.
 
And so this was -- but, you know, you're going to what's -- what is essentially a targeted multi venue attack against critical infrastructure that is not done without some organization and it is not taken lightly. So these people will be facing significant criminal sentencing if they are convicted.
 
WHITFIELD: Yes, we're talking about impacting 40,000 customers. I mean, that's the figure that's been given to us.
 
KAYYEM: It's an attack -- it's -- yes, I mean -- 
 
WHITFIELD: It's significant.
 
KAYYEM: -- it's an attack against civilians.
 
WHITFIELD: Yes.
 
KAYYEM: I mean, you know, we -- it's not -- yes, it's not guns or bombs, but this is impacting civilian life, and therefore, it has its consequences, at least, in terms of criminal liability.
 
WHITFIELD: So while this investigation will zero in on those vulnerabilities of the infrastructure, near simultaneously, it also has to lead to addressing what seemed to be susceptible -- 
 
KAYYEM: Yes.
 
WHITFIELD: -- you know, infrastructure vulnerabilities, right?
 <br>[11:10:11]
 
KAYYEM: That's right. I'm -- you know, Duke Energy to their credit has been on this since it started last night. They've been communicating with the public. And obviously, they are in touch with the governor and others in leadership there to say they will get it back on. They have to look at their vulnerabilities.
 
It's unclear right now based on the reporting, what kind of attack this was. WHITFIELD: Yes.
 
KAYYEM: I don't, you know, in terms of what brought multiple systems down. But the fact that they were simultaneously -- simultaneous, means that it was purposeful, this is not an accident. The way -- 
 
WHITFIELD: And the language of it, acts of violence. I mean, the act of violence -- 
 
KAYYEM: Yes, it is -- 
 
WHITFIELD: -- language. I mean, that's interesting.
 
KAYYEM: Yes, exactly. And therefore, suggests that someone got -- someone or some people got close to the infrastructure, that's why you start with insiders or people that may have known the system. It doesn't take much. Our critical infrastructure is vulnerable. It's also exposed, a lot of -- you can look outside, a lot of our wires are not underground, like they are in European countries and elsewhere.
 
And so they're going to be exposed. But the goal now is, of course, get this stuff up and running as soon as possible. And then the force of the law against people who are being cute, or whatever they think they're doing because they simply don't like the way the world is today.
 
WHITFIELD: Juliette Kayyem, good to see you. Thanks so much.
 
KAYYEM: Thank you.
 
WHITFIELD: All right, coming up, another barrage of Russian missiles striking Ukraine overnight as Ukrainian officials warned that Russian troops have a new town as their prime target. We're live in Kyiv next.
 
Plus, rivers of lava are flowing toward a major highway in Hawaii. The beauty is spectacular, but concerns are growing about the plumes of toxic volcanic gases spewing into the air. We're on the Big Island, straight ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:16:08]
 
WHITFIELD: Welcome back. Russian strikes hit southern Ukraine overnight. Ukrainian officials say villages were hit with heavy artillery but no casualties were reported. Russia has targeted southern Ukraine in recent weeks along with the country's infrastructure.
 
CNN's Will Ripley is in Kyiv for us today. Will, Ukraine says the town of Bakhmut now has become the focus of Russian forces. What can you tell us about that?
 
WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, and this is -- Bakhmut is actually in the eastern Ukraine -- Donetsk region, which is probably a familiar name to you. I remember I was here eight years ago and that was where the fighting was after the annexation, the illegal annexation of Crimea that started this whole thing.
 
Remember, people in Ukraine will say they've been at war for more than eight years with Russia, even though for the last nine months, things have really intensified. And now, we're being told that Bakhmut is the target number one by Russia. This is the word from Ukrainian officials in the eastern group of Armed Forces. Their spokesperson saying that Ukrainian troops are there.
 
They're holding out, but they're under very heavy fire at the moment. Russian units had been appearing to make some progress in recent days, as they attempt to move further west, attempt to demonstrate at least some success on the battlefield after getting pummeled by the Ukrainians, on pretty much every front line that exists here in Ukraine. But for the Ukrainian troops that are now trying to fend off the Russians, it's very, very difficult situation, the Ukrainian military says, but currently under control.
 
Now, as we go down south to Kherson, the liberated city, where there are still some areas under Russian control, they've been very firing very heavily on the civilian areas in liberated Kherson. In fact, there was one civilian killed, two injured just today.
 
You're talking about private apartment buildings that are being bombed. Not to mention all of the hazards that Russia has left behind in the aftermath of their occupation. Not only that they loot and plunder people's personal possessions, you know, valuable artifacts, but they also left behind mines and trip wires, and other dangerous objects.
 
In fact, more than 4,200 explosive devices have been found by the Ukrainians. They've destroyed more than 1,200 of them since they've moved back into that area. But the good news at least, the electricity in Kherson is backup to 75 percent capacity as the work continues around the clock to repair the power grid here in Ukraine.
 
But of course, Fred, there is growing fear here in Kyiv and across this nation that the Russians are planning yet another major strike on civilian infrastructure targets particularly power stations. The Russians, they believe, are going to try to plunge this nation back into darkness at some point in the coming days with another massive round of rocket and missile attacks, Fred.
 
So, certainly lots happening, whether it be on the front lines, you know, the fighting happening there, but also fears of yet another onslaught of rockets and missiles that could hit all over this country.
 
WHITFIELD: Yes, sadly, civilian targets remaining, you know, the priority target for Russia. Will Ripley in Kyiv, thanks so much.
 
Chinese officials are signaling that there could be an easing of the country's zero-COVID policy after a wave of protests in more than a dozen cities and university campuses. But top officials have not laid out a roadmap for any changes, even as the frustration spreads.
 
CNN's Selina Wang has more from Beijing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SELINA WANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The video is extreme and troubling. A man in the port city of Hangzhou dragged off to quarantine by police officers. He tries to resist the hazmat clad authorities with all his might as they force him off the couch. The man apparently trying to avoid being sent to one of the quarantine facilities set up around the country for COVID cases and close contacts. Many of them run down dirty and unsanitary.
 
It's not the first-time authorities and COVID enforcers have been caught on camera taking extreme and sometimes violent measures. But this time, local authorities apologized and said it suspended those responsible.
 <br>[11:20:09]
 
The incident, only one in a series of extraordinary videos still emerging from China. In Guangzhou, residents destroyed COVID testing boots. Police in riot gear immediately swarm in. And years of pent-up anger over China's draconian COVID lockdowns boiled over into unprecedented protests across the country.
 
Some even chanted for Xi Jinping to step down. Authorities are cracking down on protesters. But it appears they've heard their demands and for the first time, a clear shift in tone. China's top official in charge of the country's COVID response said the country is now facing a new situation regarding the pandemic.
 
In recent days, some major cities across China have eased their rules around COVID. In Beijing, public transportation will no longer reject passengers without a negative COVID test result taken within the last 48 hours. And in Guangzhou, authorities adjusted quarantine measures and scrapped a district wide mass testing plan.
 
The changes have been praised by the World Health Organization.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're pleased to learn that the Chinese authorities are adjusting their current strategies.
 
WANG (voice-over): But despite the change in rhetoric, the Chinese government has still not said if it will transition away from zero- COVID. And many in China still sealed in and people's daily lives still dictated by a web of COVID restrictions.
 
Selina Wang, CNN, Beijing.

WHITFIELD: And in this country, Congress is up against the clock to get several key pieces of legislation across the finish line before the end of the year. And before new leadership moves into power, next, how the incoming Democratic minority is already plotting to retake the House.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [11:26:25]
 
WHITFIELD: With the end of the year quickly approaching, U.S. Congress is racing to reach agreements on several major pieces of legislation with deadlines looming. This week, the House is expected to vote on a same sex marriage bill and lawmakers must also deal with government funding, the debt limit and national defense.
 
And with just weeks to go before the new Congress is sworn in, in January, House Republicans will move into the majority and Democrats will have a new Minority Leader with New York Congressman Hakeem Jeffries taking over for Nancy Pelosi. And in his first major interview since being elected Democratic leader, Jeffries is telling CNN how he plans to win back the majority.
 
CNN's Isaac Dovere landed that interview, and he's joining us right now. So Isaac, tell us more about what he had to say.
 
ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER: Well, Jeffries is coming into this role, obviously, succeeding Nancy Pelosi as her big shoes to fill. But what he is saying is that his goal here is very simple. He wants to make sure that the Republican majority that's going to be sworn in in January is a two-year majority.
 
That would be a big history defying thing for a majority last just that amount of time. But Jeffries thinks he can do it because the margin is small enough, and because he can push against Republicans that he says have not been able to get away from extremism.
 
I asked him for example, when we were talking on Friday, do you -- what do you think of Kevin McCarthy? And he said to me, Kevin McCarthy and I serve together in Congress. I said, do you respect Kevin McCarthy? He said to me, I respect that he's the Republican leader, and he may be the speaker in January, depending on how things go.
 
This is the kind of response that you should expect to see out of Jeffries, really knocking against the Republicans. Obviously, it's easier to do -- to hold his own party together in the minority, since they don't have to agree on what the terms of any legislation are, but can just really go after the Republicans.
 
WHITFIELD: And Isaac, I mean, Jeffries won unanimous support from Democrats in the House. But you also had an opportunity to hear from progressives about him, and what did they have to say?
 
DOVERE: Well, look, I started out covering near politics, I started -- first met Hakeem Jeffries in 2006 and over the course of this time, he has always made progressives and activists on the left a little suspicious of where he stands, and whether he's one of them. That continues now, even though, as you say, he got a unanimous vote when he was elected leader.
 
The feeling is, I talk to a Congressman Jamaal Bowman, a progressive from New York also, who said to me, I think I -- we agree on a lot of issues, but now it's a question of how it's actually going to work out. But I also talked to Al Sharpton, obviously, prominent black leader, prominent progressive leader, known Jeffries a long time and he said to me, that Jeffries said to him a long time ago, look, I'm going to be the guy that goes into the room. You're the one who goes and gets handcuffed, but it's a different role.
 
And Sharpton said to me, but we should trust him in that room. And that's the real question here, is a question of style that Jeffries has, that's not as brash and not as rhetorically connected to a lot of what you see out of the left of the party and whether it's enough in terms of what they get done to satisfy the demands of not only more active voters, but a bigger number of progressives who are actually going to be making up House Democrats, when they're sworn in in January.
 
WHITFIELD: All right, fascinating conversations. Isaac Dovere, thanks so much.
 
DOVERE: Thank you.
 
WHITFIELD: A former New York Governor is just back from a humanitarian trip to Ukraine. We'll ask George Pataki about conditions that he experienced on the ground as winter sets in.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:34:17]
 
WHITFIELD: All right, welcome back. Last week, a humanitarian mission to Ukraine led by former Republican New York Governor George Pataki helped deliver industrial heaters to hospitals and shelters in some of the hardest hit areas of that country. And much of the country has been hit hard by blackouts as Russia targets Ukraine's power grid.
 
And the governor is joining me right now. Governor, so good to see you. I do want to begin with what things look like while you were there in Ukraine.
 
GEORGE PATAKI (R), FORMER NEW YORK GOVERNOR: Well, Fredricka, you just mentioned the power outages and we couldn't get across the border initially because they had a power blackout the border itself. And it's getting very cold in Ukraine and without power and heat, the people are going to be suffering enormously.
 <br>[11:35:03]
 
And that's the whole point Putin's attacks is to destroy the electric and heating infrastructure so that the Ukrainians suffer greatly this winter. So we brought in 15 large industrial sized heaters, each one is capable of heating four large apartment buildings. And these are desperately needed.
 
And we know that President Zelenskyy is taking some of them. He's creating resiliency centers, centers where people can go get heat and electricity at a center when they can't get it in their homes or apartments that I know he's using some of these for that. So it was very emotional for us to be able to do what we can to try to help the people of Ukraine get through this winter. WHITFIELD: And it is remarkable, the resiliency of Ukrainians, who have been enduring so much now. What were your impressions, as you interacted with people about how they are able to cope, even with this constant bombardment?
 
PATAKI: You know, it's amazing, Fredricka. What we saw when we went the first time right after the war started in early March, was the tremendous spirit of the people. People weren't asking for what they needed. They were asking for weapons to help their sons, their brothers, their husbands win the war in the east.
 
And now nine months later, it's the same thing. They don't have power. They don't have heat. They're living in shelters. But you ask these displaced people, what do you need? And they say, don't worry about us, we'll get through this help our husbands help our sons. Get us the weapons. Get us what they need to win this war.
 
So, I've never seen such a spirited people who understand that they're all in this together. There's absolutely no question that the one thing they want to do is witness war. And if it requires some sacrifice and suffering for them, to get to that point, they're prepared to make it.
 
WHITFIELD: Does this mean you're on board with the Biden administration's push for continued monies toward ammunitions and supplies military like supplies for Ukraine to defend itself against Russia?
 
PATAKI: Absolutely. This was our war. You know, Putin invaded a democratically elected pro-Western, pro-American democracy. And who are his allies? North Korea, Iran, they're supplying him weapons. This is an evil effort to destroy a pro-Western, Pro-American democracy by Putin, who has been an enemy of America since long before this war began with his cyberattacks and is disrupting tactics on the internet.
 
So, I completely supportive. We must do more military -- militarily to help them. But Fredricka, I got to tell you one thing. Congress has appropriated billions in humanitarian aid. This was our fifth trip. Pataki Center volunteers have been all over Ukraine from Kyiv, to Lviv, to central Ukraine, to where we were yesterday. We've seen no signs of American humanitarian aid.
 
So let me say this. Kevin McCarthy says no blank check, we need accountability. We need accountability. Where's that billions in humanitarian aid that was promised? None of it's in Ukraine. Maybe it's some Poland. But, I mean, we did these 15 massive generators with donations in a volunteer organization.
 
WHITFIELD: What convinces you -- 
 
PATAKI: U.S. government -- 
 
WHITFIELD: Yes, what convinces you that monies for humanitarian assistance have not been received? I mean, perhaps not in the locations where you were, but what convinces you that it has not been received there in other parts of Ukraine? PATAKI: We haven't seen it. We haven't seen in Lviv. We haven't seen in Kyiv. We haven't seen it in the cities on central Ukraine. We haven't seen it in the south and west. You know, every trip we go, I look for it. And I say, oh, thank God, USAID has arrived. And we don't have to do this again.
 
I'll tell you, Fredricka, this is not a pleasant experience to do this. But we're doing our small part. I think asked the U.S. government that. ask them where the humanitarian aid is. How much humanitarian aid has gotten into Ukraine? Where is it? You know, and I'd love to find the answer that there's billions in aid there, then we don't have to make these trips. We don't have to ask for the donations. We haven't seen up side of it yet. Hopefully, we will soon.
 
WHITFIELD: On your humanitarian efforts, in addition to the heaters that you just delivered, you also brought hundreds of footballs. You were thinking of the young people, the kids to Ukraine to help, you know, keep the enthusiasm going for the little people, right, into the sport and just work through their anxieties, you know, sometimes through some just fun, athletic activity. And I understand that the NFL was part of that effort. Can you tell me about that?
 
PATAKI: Yes, the NFL has been enormously helpful. We call it footballs for freedom. And one of the trips to Kyiv, we gave a football to one of the last Kyiv's top ministers and he laughed and he said this is great. Ukrainians love American football which was a shock to us.
 <br>[11:40:04]
 
But we got in touch with the Ukrainian Football -- League of American Football. They have hundreds of players. And so they said they would love to participate in something like this. So yesterday, we took them hundreds of footballs donated by the NFL. We took them a giant locker and jerseys, and other things.
 
I met with the president of the Ukrainian American Football League, because he's just a great guy. By the way, they're all soldiers. And the president of the league who was there with us, it just been rotating from the frontlines a month ago. And we were with a soldier.
 
It was both uplifting but also sad. We were with the soldier who plays American football. His brother was killed last month in Kherson and his brother was on his team playing American football. And we went and visited his grave. And to see the graves of all -- new graves of all these young soldiers -- not soldiers, he was an IT technician, the managers, the workers who just are defending their country lying there was just really tragic.
 
But it just, in my mind, really reconvinces me, we must do everything we can to help the Ukrainians. They're fighting our fight.
 
WHITFIELD: Yes. It sounds like your visit and your contributions made a really big impact. New York Governor George Pataki, thank you so much.
 
PATAKI: Thank you, Fredricka. WHITFIELD: All right., we vow to keep on dancing. That's the quote, and a promise from the "Milwaukee Dancing Grannies" who will perform this afternoon at the Waukesha Christmas parade one year after six people were killed at that event. One of the leaders from the group is joining me next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:46:10]
 
WHITFIELD: The Waukesha, Wisconsin community is gathering for its annual Christmas parade today. And with celebration comes mixed emotions after last year's tragic event. Six people died after a man intentionally drove his SUV into the parade route, striking 68 people.
 
Well, this year's event will honor the victims as part of the peace on earth theme. And among those killed were three dancers from a beloved group known as the "Milwaukee Dancing Grannies." The group performs in Wisconsin parades for many occasions, bringing smiles to the crowds. They've been doing so since 1984, and now they are ready to return and honor the beloved grannies that they lost last year.
 
One of the members is joining me right now. Jean Knutson is one of the co-leaders for the "Milwaukee Dancing Grannies." Jean, so good to see you. How are you doing today?
 
JEAN KNUTSON, CO-LEADER, MILWAUKEE DANCING GRANNIES: Hi.
 
WHITFIELD: I mean, this will be, you know, return to the place that brought so much tragedy. But you all as a group continue to try to uplift everyone, and at the same time pay homage to those who died. So how are you feeling?
 
KNUTSON: Correct. It's going to be an emotional day, but it's going to be a much-needed day, another day of healing. And, you know, we're going to have sadness, remembrance, we're going to have a lot of joy and a lot of happiness. Today is our day. It is Waukesha's day to show strength, resilience, courage, healing, as we all come together, showing the Waukesha community, the state of Wisconsin, the country and worldwide, that we own the streets of Waukesha.
 
WHITFIELD: So, I mean, I imagine as you all leading up to today, you've been together, you've been rehearsing, I mean, you had to work through, you know, your routine, your dance, but then emotionally, you had to, you know, be mindful and work through all of that. So describe what that journey has been like.
 
KNUTSON: Right, there were many ups and downs, challenges, you know, so many different things when this happened. Of course, you know, everybody's in shock. We don't know -- we didn't know what hit us. We didn't know anything at that time.
 
You know, trying to deal with what did happen to the group, you know, for that we lost the injured, are we going to keep this group going, you know, just everything. And when this happened, of course, it was right at the beginning of the holiday season. So not only did we have to deal with the tragedies and everything, but our own personal lives, our holiday seasons. And again, talking and planning and everything, as far if, or how are we going to move this group forward.
 
WHITFIELD: Yes. And when you say the four that we lost, you are making reference to three, were dancing grannies, right, and then one was a spouse of one of your dancing grannies.
 
KNUTSON: Correct. Doe (ph) was a volunteer at that parade.
 
WHITFIELD: OK. And then I understand you are actually not there that day last year. And so, as a result, you also, you know, are experiencing kind of a survivor's guilt?
 
KNUTSON: Correct. Correct. Yes, big time. Correct, I was not there that day. I chose not to perform in that parade.

Actually, the Green Bay Packers save my life. I'm a big Packers fan and I went out with friends for the Packer game that day and I was signed up for all the other parades except for the Waukesha parade.
 
WHITFIELD: Oh my goodness. Yes, I can hear it in your voice, it's just -- it's a continued struggle, you know today, right?
 
KNUTSON: It is.
 
WHITFIELD: Yes.
 
KNUTSON: It is. It's -- yes, yes. It's, like I said, it's a mixed bag of emotions.
 
WHITFIELD: So in a Facebook post this morning, the group call today one of the most important meaningful parades in Grannies history. So how, you know, will -- how will the group and the audience, you know, try to remember those lives lost today? I mean, what do you suppose that connection will be like when you all perform or when you attend that parade today?
 
KNUTSON: I can only imagine what it's going to be like. I'm sure the crowds are going to be a lot. And again, we're going to have the tears of joy, the tears of sadness. Just everything is going to be going through us and talking about them, remembering them, yet moving forward and having the support of everyone around us again not only Waukesha but our families our friends and worldwide.
 
WHITFIELD: And Jean, I understand you all will be performing right today at about 4:00 -- 
 
KNUTSON: Correct.
 
WHITFIELD: -- your time.
 
KNUTSON: Correct.
 
WHITFIELD: Can you describe for us what your routine will be like or what you all have planned? And I know sometimes, you know, you may have something planned and then there's some spontaneity that will take place too. But what can you reveal to people about what to look forward to today in your performance?
 
KNUTSON: Right now, we are performing four songs. The song that we were hit on in the tragedy parade, we will not be performing. We have not performed at all season, all Christmas season long. There is going to be many people with some, of the families of the deceased will be joining us.
 
We will be handing out some granny strong, Waukesha strong bracelets and carrying posters of the fallen four. And again it's just going to be spectacular heartwarming, sad parade.
 
WHITFIELD: Yes, it will indeed.
 
KNUTSON: But -- 
 
WHITFIELD: But now important nonetheless and important to your hearts.
 
KNUTSON: Very much, yes.
 
WHITFIELD: Yes. Jean Knutson -- 
 
KNUTSON: Yes.
 
WHITFIELD: Jean Knutson, thank you so much for sharing with us today. And, you know, our prayers go out to you and all the Dancing Grannies and all in your community -- 
 
KNUTSON: Thank you so much.
 
WHITFIELD: -- you know, still trying to grapple with a horrible tragedy just one year ago.
 
KNUTSON: Right. Right.
 
WHITFIELD: Thank you so much.
 
KNUTSON: But together, we will get through it as -- 
 
WHITFIELD: Yes.
 
KNUTSON: -- yes, Waukesha so strong, Grannies, among and together strong. Thank you.
 
WHITFIELD: Thanks so much. We'll be right back.

WHITFIELD: All right, lots of anticipation. In just over an hour from now, Cleveland Browns Quarterback Deshaun Watson will play in his first regular season NFL game in almost two years. His return comes about 21 months after the first of more than two dozen women filed civil lawsuits accusing the 27-year-old of sexual misconduct. CNN's Sports Anchor Coy Wire joining me with more.
 
COY WIRE, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR: Yes.
 
WHITFIELD: It's a lot.
 
WIRE: A lot. And I think we should first point out that Watson has maintained his innocence this entire time saying that he never sexually assaulted or even harassed anyone in regards to that civil lawsuit filed on behalf of the women who say that he sexually -- alleged that he sexually assaulted and harassed them during his massage therapy sessions during his time with the Houston Texans.
 
Now before his 11-game suspension by the NFL, 23 of the 24 lawsuits were settled confidentially. Two grand juries declined to charge Watson criminally, though a new civil suit was filed by another woman in October. On a Thursday, reporters in Cleveland tried to get Watson to talk about the controversy at a press conference, but he chose not to talk about it. Here he is.

DESHAUN WATSON, CLEVELAND BROWNS QUARTERBACK: I understand that you guys have, you know, a lot of questions, but with my legal team and my clinical team, there's only football questions that I can really address at this time.
 
Yes, I'm focusing on football. That's my main focus is football and preparing to be the starting quarterback for the Cleveland Browns so I can execute the game plan to try to get a win this Sunday.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WIRE: And NFL handing Watson that 11-game $5 million suspension for violating the NFL as personal conduct policy that was in August and that came after he signed a five-year fully guaranteed $230 million contract in March, it was the most guaranteed money in NFL history. His 11-game suspension positioned him, though, to return against his former team in Houston where around 10 of the women who accused him of misconduct will be attending the game today according to an attorney.
 
Women's movement organizations, nonprofits dedicated to protecting victims of sexual assault and harassment have applauded the accusers for attending the game. Donisha Greene, spoke spokeswoman for local advocacy group the Cleveland Rape Crisis Center, told CNN, "I'm proud of them for being strong enough to try and take some of the power back. Even today, when survivors hear stories like this, they are triggered by it. By attending the game, the accusers are saying they are not willing to suffer in silence. What that says to other survivors is that you don't have to suffer in silence either."
 
Game time is 1:00 today in Houston.
 
WHITFIELD: Wow, that's all I got to say about all of that because that's huge content. All right, Coy, thanks so much.
 
WIRE: Good to see you. WHITFIELD: I'm Fredricka Whitfield. "STATE OF THE UNION" with Jake Tapper begins right now. See you back here 02:00 Eastern time.</pre>
