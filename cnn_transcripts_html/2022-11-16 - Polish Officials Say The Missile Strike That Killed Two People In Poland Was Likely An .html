ISA SOARES, HOST, ISA SOARES TONIGHT:  A very warm welcome to the show everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, Polish officials say the missile strike 
 
 that killed two people was likely an accident. We are covering the story from all angles. In Poland, Ukraine, Russia and Brussels. Then Donald Trump 
 
 will be running for president in 2024.   
 
But does he have the support he needs? We'll have the latest on divisions in the Republican Party. Plus, Brazil's President-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da 
 
 Silva says his country is back in the fight against climate change. We have reports from Sao Paulo ahead. But first, tonight, Polish leaders say it's 
 
 likely the missile that killed two people in eastern Poland was a tragic accident, not a Russian missile and not an act of war against a NATO member 
 
 country according to Poland's investigation. 
 
There is a high chance the missile was a Ukrainian air defense missile that landed across the border while intercepting a massive Russian air attack. 
 
 Well, on Tuesday, Russia if you remember launched some 85 missiles on Ukrainian cities. It's most ferocious assault in fact in weeks. NATO 
 
 Secretary-General says that makes only one party responsible for what happened in Poland on Tuesday. Have a listen.   
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
JENS STOLTENBERG, SECRETARY-GENERAL, NATO:  Let me be clear. This is not Ukraine's fault. Russia bears ultimate responsibility as it continues its 
 
 illegal war against Ukraine. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
SOARES:  But just earlier, we heard from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and here is what he had to say.   
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT, UKRAINE (through translator):  I don't even doubt that report that I received, that's illusion I received from the Air 
 
 Defense Command. I don't doubt that it wasn't our missile. I don't have a reason to doubt them. I am going through this war with them. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
SOARES:  While we are covering this from all angles for you. A reporter for CNN affiliate "TVN", Sebastian Napieraj who is in Poland where the missile 
 
 hit. Our Melissa Bell is at NATO headquarters in Brussels. And later, we're going to hear from Frederik Pleitgen in Moscow, as well as our Sam Kiley in 
 
 Kryvyi Rih in Ukraine.  
 
I want to start this hour with Melissa and Sebastian who join me now. Sebastian, let me start with you. Just bring our viewers up to date where 
 
 we are on the investigation from the Polish side here. 
 
SEBASTIAN NAPIERAJ, REPORTER, TVN:  Good evening. We are still in a Przewodow, very close to Polish -- to the Polish-Ukrainian border. We are 
 
 around 5 kilometers from it. And so, you know, people here are still frightened and shocked by this horrible event. As you we know, two Polish 
 
 citizens were killed and since last 30 hours, Polish authorities are trying to explain what really happened here.   
 
Around 500 police officers, technicians, military specialists and prosecutors are working at the scene and trying to collect evidence. Today, 
 
 this terrain was scanned with special 3D technology to find any new possible rests of the rocket. So they are working right now here, and as we 
 
 know, and that is the message from the Polish authorities.   
 
We know that President Andrzej Duda said today, it's very likely that the rocket was produced in the USSR  in '70s, and is very likely that, it was 
 
 used by the Ukrainians to defend themselves yesterday during the massive Russian rocket strike. So that's the official message from the government.   
 
And the Ukrainians are denying that -- they want to work very closely with Polish authorities right now. As you can see, we are here, and we are 
 
 waiting for this crisp and clear message from the Polish government with 100 percent confidence what hit NATO member's territory.    
 
SOARES:  Indeed, that's exactly what we're waiting for that investigation. Sebastian, thank you very much. Melissa, let me go to you, we heard in the 
 
 last hour as he was saying from President Zelenskyy, who said he's convinced that missile that fell in Poland where Sebastian is, was not 
 
 Ukrainian. Which sounds that he's not like in lockstep with NATO and Poland. What has been the reaction there to these comments by Ukraine?   
 <br>[14:05:00] 
 
MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  That's right, he couldn't be starker and in his difference of tone and the fact, Isa, from everything we've been 
 
 hearing, not just from President Duda, but from President Biden before he left Bali last night, from the Secretary-General of NATO Jens Stoltenberg 
 
 when he held his press conference here at NATO headquarters earlier on just after the ambassador's in NATO's 30 strong alliance got together in that 
 
 emergency meeting to try and figure out what had happened, looking at the intelligence.  
 
And I think it's an important reminder, even as President Zelenskyy makes this announcement, insists that Ukrainians should get access, of course, 
 
 this does not make the job of NATO countries any easier. And I think there'll be quite a lot of disquiet within the ranks of NATO that this 
 
 should be coming out at this particular point. 
 
Even as he makes those pronouncements, the mood, the attempt here from NATO has been really to try and calm things down. To try and ensure that people 
 
 wait for the end of the investigation. But in the meantime, that everyone roll back from the talk we were hearing this morning of Poland seeking to 
 
 invoke Article 4, which forces the consultations of NATO, any talk of Article 5 being a vote. 
 
I mean, I think clearly you have to keep in mind, Isa, that whilst -- and we've just been hearing the American Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in his 
 
 press conference speak about this. One of the things that's been remarkable over the course of the last nine months, has been the unity of NATO. It has 
 
 been steadfast in support of Ukraine, remarkably so, giving its past  divisions.  
 
And I think that unity would almost certainly be tested if it were time for NATO to abide by that foundational Article 5 and intervene in one way or 
 
 another. How far would they go? How much would they intervene? What shape would that take? That extraordinary unity of NATO would no doubt be tested. 
 
 And I think that is probably in the mind of people like Jens Stoltenberg as well. 
 
As they seek with that preliminary assessment to keep the mood as calm as they can. Of course, we'll have to wait for the investigation itself to 
 
 find out more about what went on for the time being. You're talking about Polish, American investigators who are on the ground, experts looking at a 
 
 list, and again you saw also those very strong NATO alliance come together here in Brussels. 
 
And look at that preliminary intelligence. For now, their assessment is the one you've been hearing from the likes of President Duda and the Secretary-
 
 General of NATO, Isa. 
 
SOARES:  Yes, and it seems calm, united and measured so far. Well, at least, we've seen the last 24 hours pretty measured. Melissa Bell for us 
 
 there in Brussels, thanks very much, Melissa. Well, I want to bring in Robert Pszczel, a NATO official and former Polish diplomat, he joins me now 
 
 live from Brussels. Can we discuss how the region is reacting to these developments?   
 
Rob, thank you very much for joining us. We've heard as Melissa was saying there from the Polish president who said today that this was an accident. 
 
 We've heard from Stoltenberg who says this was likely caused by Ukraine's defenses. Yet, Ukraine as you've heard me talking to Melissa there, is 
 
 saying the missile that fell in Poland was not Ukrainian. How do you assess what we are hearing here? How do we process this?
 
ROBERT PSZCZEL, FORMER POLISH DIPLOMAT &amp; NATO OFFICIAL:  Well, I think let's kind of, you know, stick to the facts, you know? It is true that 
 
 we've heard that we all pray for right reasons, natural reasons. The Polish president, we heard the Secretary-General, but the Secretary-General spoken 
 
 on behalf of all the allies after the meeting of the NATO ambassadors.   
 
OK, it was not a meeting under Article 4 which Poland could have invoked, but actually that depended on the evaluation of their situation because it 
 
 does make a difference, whether the missile was fired with the intention of, you know, hitting Poland. Whether something has happened, you know, and 
 
 that is the version which all the allies actually agree on. 
 
It is based on the evaluation provided by individual countries, but also, on the valuation provided by NATO military authorities. You know, I was not 
 
 there at the meeting, but I know that this meeting started with a breaching by that -- you know, as actually strategic commanders care. And I've heard 
 
 from many people, this was very impressive.   
 
And let's also not forget, NATO's presence both on land, sea and in the air in Poland and other frontier NATO countries has been dramatically stepped 
 
 up. So, NATO has a very good idea in terms of the picture in the air, including, for example, the trajectory of various missiles. So, Ukrainian 
 
 colleagues, we understand. They -- you know, their point of view, but there is a simple next step.   
 
They should provide information they have. And I'm sure they'll do that. And I can assure you, nobody in Poland, no one in NATO is blaming Ukraine -
 
 - 
 
SOARES:  Yes -- 
 
PSZCZEL:  Yes, it was their missile fighting self-defense. That's as simple as that. So we'll get to the bottom of this, but unity which you mentioned 
 
 is strong and there's no reason to doubt it. 
 
SOARES:  But you think that Ukraine will come out and say something and have some sort of acknowledgment? We heard from the U.S. Defense Secretary 
 
 Lloyd Austin, he said we have seen nothing to contradict, and I'm quoting him here, "due to its early assessment that this was a Ukrainian air 
 
 defense missile." So, do you think we will hear from Ukraine on this?   
 
PSZCZEL:  Well, we hear from many people. But the first source of information has to be. And there was -- there was a bit of a fog, obviously 
 
 yesterday -- 
 <br>[14:10:00] 
 
SOARES:  Right -- 
 
PSZCZEL:  Because of the speed of events, and frankly speaking, there was one story in the U.S. media which kind of -- you know, you know, slightly, 
 
 maybe mis-struck people. But now, all this behind is, behind us. There is a unity of -- you see unity of the valuation. And if there's new data which 
 
 our Ukrainian colleagues, you know, want to provide, they should do so and appropriate procedures to them. 
 
But I have no doubt that, you know, we should not focus -- there is no kind of disagreement that there may be some emotions involved, and that's 
 
 understandable. It's Ukraine which has been under attack, and It's Russia that we need to focus on. Also, in terms of providing Ukraine and perhaps 
 
 NATO-fronted countries with more air defense systems that would actually ensure the security is better and we'll have no more this kind of 
 
 incidents.   
 
And that's the message that Russia is hearing loud and clear. That's the thing we have to focus on. And I have no doubt that, you know, we will come 
 
 out stronger in this. Because let's say it once again very clearly, Russia is losing this war, hence, we see these desperate things. And that's the 
 
 reason for a lot of disinformation they employ. Will sort out our -- any issues we have with our allies and France and Ukraine are very close 
 
 friends.   
 
SOARES:  So, let me ask you this, I heard today from the U.S., former Defense Secretary Mark Esper speaking here to CNN, he basically said that 
 
 President Zelenskyy should apologize. I hear what you're saying, should he? Do you agree? 
 
PSZCZEL:  Look, again, between France, like it's almost a family, you know? We have millions of Ukrainians who are living in Poland, some cities in 
 
 Poland, including in the east, they've been, you know, increasing population has been 40 percent. It's unbelievable. And yet, you know, 
 
 they're part of our society. 
 
So, you know, in a family, you might have slight different views or sensibilities, and we understand, you know, we are not blaming -- not just 
 
 for a fact, but we're not even blaming Ukraine face this position. We'll get as I said to the bottom of it, and Ukraine of course, would be part of 
 
 it. But you know, NATO is a serious -- is in a serious business when you talk about, you know -- you know, potentially, you know, going on any kind 
 
 of conflict path with Russia.   
 
We need to get the facts straight. And that's what we're doing. There is a lot of responsibility which has been shown in the last 24 hours in unity 
 
 and Ukraine is part of it. So, you know, I'm sure this story will not be a big story tomorrow. 
 
The big story should continue to be what are we doing in order to prevent Russia from, you know, raining havoc both in security, first, killing 
 
 people and also engineering energy and other crisis. That is the focus. That should be the main task of the international community.   
 
SOARES:  And I think that's the unity we've been hearing from throughout the day today at NATO, but also from the U.S. We heard from Lloyd Austin, 
 
 General Mark Milley both saying that Russia bears ultimate responsibility here. Thank you very much, I appreciate you taking the time to speak to us 
 
 here. Robert Pszczel, thank you. Now, Kremlin -- 
 
PSZCZEL:  OK -- 
 
SOARES:  Spokesman Dmitry Peskov is praising U.S. response to the Poland missile incident. He says U.S. officials were restrained and professional, 
 
 and calls the reaction from Poland and other nations absolutely hysterical. Let's get the view from Russia. Our Fred Pleitgen joins me now from the 
 
 capital in Moscow.  
 
So, Fred, despite being an accident, as you heard from the NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg, Russia bears ultimate responsibility, something that we heard 
 
 as well from U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. What has been the response from the Kremlin?   
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, the Russians certainly don't see it that way, Isa. In fact, that's something 
 
 that we've heard throughout the course of the day from Dmitry Peskov, the spokesman for the Kremlin, who said the Russians essentially don't bear 
 
 responsibility for. That it was not something that they are responsible for.   
 
And then also, of course, trying to lay blame with the Ukrainians and also with the Poles as well. It sort of seems kind of a dual strategy that the 
 
 Russians have here. Well, on the one hand, as you mentioned, Dmitry Peskov praising Joe Biden, the U.S. President for what he called a restrained 
 
 response to all this, trying to get the facts first.   
 
And then hysteria, as the Russians put it on the part of the Polish government. And you know, a lot of things have been happening here between 
 
 Poland and Russia throughout the past, I would say 15-16 hours as the days unfolded. The Poles summoned the Russian ambassador to Warsaw, and the 
 
 Russians tonight summoned the Polish ambassador to Moscow.   
 
And he was only in the foreign ministry only for about 20 minutes. But of course, this is a hugely symbolic and important act in all of this, as the 
 
 Russians are saying, they believe that the Poles should have come out earlier and said that they did not believe that this was necessarily a 
 
 Russian missile or a missile fired by the Russians, I guess we need to say, that landed there in Poland.  
 
But possibly, one that was fired by the Ukrainians even though it might be Russian-made. You also see -- 
 
SOARES:  Yes -- 
 
PLEITGEN:  The Russians really trying to lay a lot of blame on the Ukrainians as well. Dmitry Peskov and the Russian foreign ministry coming 
 
 out and essentially accusing the Ukrainians of a provocation, and essentially trying to drag NATO into an open conflict with Russia, Isa.   
 <br>[14:15:00] 
 
SOARES:  Let me ask you this. Look, in the last 40 minutes also, General Mark Milley said that Russia had lost strategically, operationally and 
 
 tactically. I mean, you cover obviously Moscow, but you've also been very much part of our coverage since the war in Ukraine, February, 24th. What is 
 
 your sense, Fred, then of just how crippling this war has been for Putin? We saw this earlier, the G20, Russia has been pretty much sidelined, 
 
 becoming some ways a pariah. Is this rattling some nerves in Moscow?   
 
PLEITGEN:  I think it certainly is rattling some nerves in Moscow, especially of the events that you've seen over the past week, ten days, 
 
 especially with the Russians losing their foothold there in Kherson. It was something, you know, that many had seen coming in the West, not necessarily 
 
 on the Russian side though.
 
Where the Russians or at least some of them had said that they wanted to defend that territory. That, of course, hasn't happened. You know, at the 
 
 same time, if you look at the initial invasion of Ukraine or the big invasion of Ukraine as we've been calling it on February 24th and see 
 
 what's happened since then, it really seems as though the Russians have been losing a lot of ground since then, in the northeast of the country, in 
 
 the southeast of the country, and of course, in the area around Kyiv as well. 
 
And that certainly is something that you'd also noticed here on Kremlin- controlled television, but also with some officials as well. When you do see that the mood certainly has changed from the early stages where the 
 
 Russians thought they were going to have a quick victory to now complete uncertainty as to what exactly the aims of what the Russians call their 
 
 special military operation is.  
 
The Russians continue to say that all the aims need to be achieved as they put it. There's varying names for it. On the one hand, they called the 
 
 operation to liberate the Donbas area, on the other hand, they still at some point say that they want to change the government in Kyiv as well. But 
 
 it certainly seems as though right now, it's unclear what exactly the ultimate goal of all of this is.  
 
Now, at the same time, of course, there is a lot of attrition on the battlefield. There's a lot of -- 
 
SOARES:  Yes -- 
 
PLEITGEN:  People who are being lost, and certainly, some pain that's being felt here by Russians at home as well. As of course, we have big inflation, 
 
 you now have since the day, recession as well in the third quarter. So certainly, it is becoming more difficult for the Russians.   
 
SOARES:  Fred Pleitgen in Moscow for us this hour, good to see you, Fred, thank you. Well, as I was saying there with Fred, U.S. Defense Secretary 
 
 Lloyd Austin just a short time ago spoke. And we also heard from the Joint Chiefs Chairman General Mark Milley who gave a press conference at the 
 
 Pentagon.   
 
I want to go live to the Pentagon where we find our Oren Liebermann who is standing by for us. So President Zelenskyy, Oren, pretty convinced, he says 
 
 that the missile that fell in Poland was not Ukrainian. Where does the Pentagon then stand on this?   
 
OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT:  Well, this of course was in Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's opening comments. He made sure that it was 
 
 clear from the U.S. perspective, the Pentagon's perspective, that they stand behind Ukraine and Ukraine's right to defend itself. 
 
But he also said they had no information to contradict what Polish President  Duda said, that they believe based on the preliminary 
 
 information that this was a Ukrainian air defense missile that had inadvertently or accidentally landed in Poland, killing those two Polish 
 
 citizens. Of course, it was one of the first questions the media asked of him.   
 
And he said, again, the information the Pentagon has, the information the U.S. has supports what the Polish president said that it was a Ukrainian 
 
 air defense missile. So, you see, there is certainly at least, some daylight here between what the Pentagon says and what you hear from 
 
 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. 
 
But Austin and Joint Chiefs Chairman, General Mark Milley were quick to immediately say, look, this is Russia's fault. It was because of a Russian 
 
 barrage of missiles that Ukraine had to launch air defense missiles. And if that's why there was a Ukrainian air defense missile that crashed in 
 
 Poland, then it remains Russia's fault.  
 
Austin underscored that the U.S. would continue to provide Ukraine and would chair a group, which is what was happening this morning of 
 
 international countries that will continue to provide Ukraine with the weapons that it needs to defend itself. 
 
So even if there is some gap here, small, but what is on what happened in Poland and whose missile it was that landed in Poland, there is no gap on 
 
 what the U.S. will do going forward to make sure that Ukraine is able to keep carrying out what has been a very successful operation and a counter 
 
 offensive against Russia's invasion.   
 
SOARES:  Steadfastly behind Ukraine here. Oren Liebermann there for us, thanks very much, Oren, good to see you. And still to come tonight, we'll 
 
 take you live to Kryvyi Rih to get a view on the story from Ukraine. And his first presidential term ended with a violent insurrection. Now, Donald 
 
 Trump is asking voters to put him back in the White House again. That story after this short break. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 <br>[14:20:00] 
 
SOARES:  Well, the last time he was in the White House, Donald Trump pushed U.S. democracy to the brink. He is now running for president again. But his 
 
 grip on his own party weakening, he can't take for granted that he will win the Republican nomination. Trump formally announced his bid at Mar-a-Lago, 
 
 saying he wants to save, quote, "a failing nation".   
 
He described America in apocalyptic terms, accusing Democrats of turning cities into cesspools of blood, while claiming his own tenure marked a 
 
 golden age of prosperity. CNN's Kristen Holmes has more.   
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  America's comeback starts right now.   
 
KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Former President Donald Trump announcing another bid for the presidency.   
 
TRUMP:  Two years ago, we were a great nation, and soon, we will be a great nation again.   
 
HOLMES:  The twice-impeached former President is aiming to be only the second commander-in-chief ever elected to non-consecutive terms. Trump 
 
 making the long anticipated announcement in the wake of election losses from several of his endorsed candidates.
 
TRUMP:  Much criticism is being placed on the fact that the Republican Party should have done better, and frankly, much of this blame is correct. 
 
 But the citizens of our country have not yet realized the full extent and gravity of the pain our nation is going through, and the total effect of 
 
 the suffering is just starting to take hold. They don't quite feel it yet, but they will very soon. 
 
HOLMES:  Given the GOP's midterm losses, some Republicans are wary of another Trump presidential bid. It is widely expected, he'll face primary 
 
 challengers. Florida Governor, Ron DeSantis is seen as one possible contender to challenge the former president.   
 
RON DESANTIS, GOVERNOR-ELECT OF FLORIDA:  We just tell people to go check out the scoreboard from last Tuesday night. It was a hugely underwhelming, 
 
 disappointing performance.  
 
HOLMES:  Another potential contender is his former Vice President, Mike Pence.   
 
MIKE PENCE, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  But I think we'll have better choices in the future.   
 
HOLMES:  President Biden, who is yet to announce whether he will seek re- election tweeted after the announcement, quote, "Donald Trump failed America."   
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I believe I can beat Donald Trump again.   
 
HOLMES:  Trump's desire to announce his campaign early, coming after the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, which advisors say further emboldened his 
 
 decision to mount what he believes will be a triumphant political comeback. Trump is the subject of a bevy of lawsuits and federal investigations, 
 
 including his possible involvement in the January 6th Capitol attack.   
 
Trump is fighting a subpoena issued by the House Select Committee investigating January 6th over providing documents and testimony to the 
 
 committee.   
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 <br>[14:25:00] 
 
SOARES:  And that was CNN's Kristen Holmes reporting. Well, Trump's stark warnings about America may motivate his base. But our Stephen Collinson 
 
 says for many voters in key swing states, his speech may have sounded like authoritarian demagoguery. Stephen joins me now from Washington. Stephen, 
 
 great to have you back. 
 
So, as you and I were discussing, what? Tuesday, I've lost track, Monday? He threw his hat in the ring. just first of all, tell me what you made of 
 
 the speech and any insight as to what we can expect from Mr. Trump?   
 
STEPHEN COLLINSON, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, it was the latest version of the American carnage argument that Trump laid out during his first 
 
 presidential campaign, and in his inauguration and in his re-election. So, it was a familiar message from Trump. It was classic demagoguery, if you 
 
 like. 
 
He painted the picture of a country facing a massive crime wave, awash in illegal immigration. He advocated ruthless policies against drug 
 
 traffickers which he said he would model on those in China. And he set himself up as the strong man that was needed to return to fix everything.  
 
Now, this might be a message that plays well on the campaign trail among the most activists, Republican grassroots voters. It doesn't really solve 
 
 the riddle the Republican Party is facing between getting a candidate that can appeal to those voters and winning over the more independent swing 
 
 state voters that deserted it yet again last week in the midterm elections.  
 
So I think Trump's speech showed us who he is. But It also showed the challenges that his party faces running into the next presidential 
 
 election.   
 
SOARES:  Yes, on that point, I mean, just explain it for international viewers, Stephen, why is he launching his campaign so early? Especially 
 
 like he said when he's not exactly shining right now following on from those losses in the midterms.   
 
COLLINSON:  I think he first of all set himself up because he believes that the Republicans were going to have this big red wave victory in the midterm 
 
 elections last week. When that didn't happen, he would have looked like he was weak and backing down. He sort of put himself into this political 
 
 vacuum, blamed everybody else, apart from himself, for those losses, even though a lot of people in the Republican Party believe that Trump-style 
 
 candidates really turned off a lot of voters.   
 
I think Trump also wants to kind of try to freeze the race a little bit. There's a lot of talk about Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor who you saw 
 
 in that clip there, he's getting a lot of good press. Trump wants to sort of stop that gaining any more momentum. And as we heard, there are these 
 
 investigations of the Justice Department, and in Georgia, into Trump's behavior, not just after January, the 6th, 2021, but his hoarding of 
 
 classified information at Mar-a-Lago.   
 
He wants to be able to portray those investigations as political persecution. I think it's a lot easier for him to do that if he's already a 
 
 declared candidate.   
 
SOARES:  Ron DeSantis versus Trump. This will be quite interesting to watch, I have no doubt. Thanks very much, Stephen Collinson there for us.  
 
COLLINSON:  Thanks.   
 
SOARES:  And still to come tonight, an update on our top story this hour. A missile that killed two people in Poland right next to the border of 
 
 Ukraine, as Ukrainians fight off a wave of Russian airstrikes. We'll bring you the very latest. And then Brazil's President-elect makes a strong 
 
 statement on the environment. We will hear what he told the climate delegates at COP27. That is next.  
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 <br>[14:30:00]
 
(MUSIC PLAYING)
 
SOARES:  Welcome back to the show everyone. Let me sum up our top story this hour. 
 
Poland's president said the missile that hit his country Tuesday was probably an accident from the Ukrainian side. He adds that there is no 
 
 proof that it was a missile fired by Russian troops, even if it is most likely Russian-made and thinks that it was shot by Ukraine's air defense. 
 
These comments are aligned with what NATO secretary general said after an emergency meeting and what the U.S. Secretary of Defense just told the 
 
 press in the last 45 minutes or so. An adviser to Ukraine's president in a statement to CNN did not explicitly deny the reports that the missile came 
 
 from Ukraine. 
 
He pointed to Russia's responsibility in starting the war. This is, of course, the first time a NATO country has been hit since the start of the 
 
 war. Standing by in Ukraine is Sam Kiley.
 
What are we hearing from all sides here?
 
Polish president saying it's an accident. We have heard in the past hour from President Zelenskyy. He said he is convinced that the missile that 
 
 fell in Poland was not Ukrainian. They don't seem to be in lockstep here.
 
Why not?
 
SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  It is very difficult to try to explain that. I think the balance of evidence coming from allies of 
 
 Ukraine is that they believe it was a Ukrainian air defense missile that was fired at an incoming Russian cruise missile in self-defense, in an area 
 
 close to the border with Poland. 
 
It accidentally came down inside of Poland, killing two farmers. The position of President Zelenskyy is, it wasn't our missile, at all. This may 
 
 be -- and he is citing his chief of military staff, the head of the armed forces here, as his source on that. 
 
They say they have always been accurate in the past and I don't see any reason to disbelieve them now. But he did say yesterday, very publicly -- 
 
 pretty quickly after this incident -- that it was two Russian missiles that had landed, impacted in Poland. 
 
That turns out to be based on the Polish preliminary investigations, supported by American experts and others, to not be the case. It may be an 
 
 issue where he simply has to catch up with his own information loop. 
 
The attitude among many of his subordinates is, not, well, we definitely know it was a Ukrainian missile. 
 
The reason they all accepted is that no one is blaming Ukraine for this. NATO, the United States, Poland itself, very explicitly blaming Russia for 
 
 the fact that they've created the situation in which Ukraine has to fire surface to air missiles in self-defense. 
 
It is a rather strange set of circumstances. But a lot better than it was this time last night when there was concerns that, if there had been 
 
 Russian missiles, the Article V would trigger a all for one doctrine in NATO could've been set off. 
 
SOARES:  Lloyd Austin, the U.S. Defense Secretary, in fact saying that Russia bears ultimate responsibility. This all happened as you or I were 
 
 reporting yesterday on the same day that we saw 85 plus missiles raining down on Ukraine, some where you are. 
 
I know the majority of those were shot down but does this make the case, Sam, the need for more, better, more improved, more modern air defense 
 
 systems for Ukraine? 
 <br>[14:35:00]
 
KILEY:  Ironically, I think you are absolutely right. The tragedy that unfolded in that Polish farm is ultimately probably going to accelerate the 
 
 need -- some hinting of this coming out of NATO today -- for Ukraine to get more modern surface to air missiles. 
 
It is inevitable. Ukrainian and NATO officials say that, if they use this old style Soviet equipment, these types of accidents are more likely to 
 
 happen. They are more old-fashioned weapons. 
 
The United States pointing out that the recent supply that they have made of surface-to-air missiles have 100 percent success rate. I think that is a 
 
 broad hint from Americans to other allies to step up. 
 
There are at least seven of these countries General Austin said, were contributing already with surface to air missiles, anti missile systems and 
 
 anti aircraft missile systems. They could be expanded, I think. 
 
There is an increasing desire to see the Ukrainians continue the success they have had on the ground by not having to deal with the aerial 
 
 bombardment that they suffer in retaliation. 
 
SOARES:  Sam Kiley in Ukraine there. Thank you very much, Sam. 
 
We will be keeping on top of the story for you. But you can stay on top of all the latest stories coming out of Ukraine and Poland, at cnn.com. 
 
Still to come, the world's two top polluter are talking about how to combat climate change. U.S. climate envoy, John Kerry, says that U.S. and Chinese 
 
 representatives are talking on the sidelines of the COP27 climate summit in Egypt. 
 
It ends a freeze on their climate cooperation that has gone on for months. It comes after the two countries' presidents met face to face earlier in 
 
 the summit. Perhaps the day's strongest message today came from Brazil's president-elect, Lula da Silva. 
 
He has promised to stop the rampant destruction of Brazil's vast Amazon rain forest. He told COP27 delegates today that the world urgently needs to 
 
 help countries whose very survival is threatened by the changing climate. Have a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
INACIO LULA DA SILVA, BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  We cannot postpone this debate. We need to deal with the reality of countries who 
 
 have their own physical integrity of their territories threatened and the survival conditions of their inhabitants seriously compromised. 
 
It's time to act. We cannot waste time anymore. We cannot live with this rush toward the abyss. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SOARES:  Environmental activists across Brazil and indeed the world are hoping that Lula da Silva will follow through and put an end to illegal 
 
 deforestation in his country. CNN's Paula Newton discovered one place in Sao Paulo, where ecologists are restoring a devastated landscape to its 
 
 natural beauty. Have a look. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PAULA NEWTON, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  To save the planet, Luis Pinto says you don't have to go to the arctic or even the 
 
 Amazon. This sky-high perch will do. What was once degraded pasture is now, after 15 years, an ecoparadise -- two miles of forest restoration.
 
LUIS PINTO, SOS AMAZONIA:  This project doesn't change a big landscape but it shows it's possible to bring back life, to bring back water, to bring 
 
 back biodiversity to the state of Sao Paulo.
 
NEWTON (voice-over):  Pinto walks us through the effort to revive the Atlantic Forest, home to more than 145 million Brazilians and yet, about 
 
 three-quarters of it has already been wiped out.
 
This is an effort to bring some of it back and it works like an ecolab by planting trees the forest provides for clean air and water, bringing back 
 
 ecodiversity for plants and animals.
 
PINTO:  So we need a lot of technology, knowledge and research to know which species to plant and how.
 
NEWTON (voice-over):  Projects like these are now at a crossroads of climate and political history in Brazil, a country that is one of the 
 
 planet's most significant stores of biodiversity. For four years the government of President Jair Bolsonaro was accused of undoing the 
 
 environmental progress of former president and now president-elect Lula da Silva.
 
Brazil's National Institute for Space Research estimates that in the Amazon alone, deforestation nearly doubled since Bolsonaro came to office in 2018.
 
Ricardo Sailes was Bolsonaro's environment minister.
 
NEWTON:  You know, to many environmentalists, you're as good as the devil. You're a bad guy.
 
RICARDO SAILES, FEDERAL LAWMAKER AND FORMER ENVIRONMENT MINISTER:  Yes. You know, people don't understand that what we did was to show that the 
 
 solution for the environmental challenges in Brazil include as a main path for the solution the economic equation.
 <br>[14:40:00]
 
NEWTON (voice-over):  Sailes now speaks as a newly-elected lawmaker in the majority conservative congress in Brazil. His policies are still clearly 
 
 popular with many here.
 
TXAI SURUI, INDIGENOUS ACTIVIST:  And I was so scared, you know?
 
NEWTON (voice-over):  Indigenous leader Txai Surui says she and her people, the Paiter Surui tribe, have been threatened and harassed when trying to 
 
 protect Brazil's fragile environment. And she accuses the Bolsonaro government of dismantling key environmental protections.
 
SURUI (through translator):  We don't need to destroy to develop. We can do that in harmony with nature and it's the indigenous peoples who teach that.
 
NEWTON (voice-over):  It is that fundamental struggle on climate action that so threatens progress in Brazil.
 
PINTO:  We need to understand first, as a nation, that is key for the planet and that decisions we will make will be important for us but also 
 
 for others.
 
NEWTON (voice-over):  And so, watch this space. Brazil's future climate action and its debate over environmental policy will be consequential far 
 
 beyond its borders -- Paula Newton, CNN, in Sao Paulo state, Brazil.

SOARES:  Displaced Congolese in the major city of Goma are fleeing in the tens, of thousands as heavily armed rebels threaten to seize it for a 
 
 second time. The militia is reportedly backing government forces on the city's outskirts in the Democratic Republic of Congo. 
 
Diplomatic efforts are underway on several fronts to end the fighting. But so far, there's been no progress. The rebels briefly captured Goma in 2012 
 
 but Congolese troops pushed them back into neighboring Rwanda and Uganda. 
 
An oil tanker affiliated with Israel has reportedly been hit by a drone in the Gulf of Oman just days before the World Cup gets underway in nearby 
 
 Qatar. An Israeli official tells CNN that Iran is behind this attack, which shares similarities with previous attacks linked to Tehran. Our Hadas Gold 
 
 explains. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  This attack took place on Tuesday evening. This oil tanker named the Pacific Zircon was struck by 
 
 what officials called a suicide drone or a self destructing drone. The company that owns the tanker said while there was damage to the vessel's 
 
 hull. 
 <br>[14:45:00]
 
(voice-over):  There were no injuries, no cargo spillage, no water intake. 
 
The ship flies the Liberian flag. It is owned by a Singaporean company. But its ultimate ownership does have Israeli affiliation. Both Israeli and 
 
 American officials are pointing the finger at Iran. 
 
An Israeli official telling me they believe this was an Iranian-made Shahed 136 drone. They say this is the same type of drone, Iranian made drone, 
 
 that are being used by Russia in Ukraine. 
 
But officials said they don't actually think this was an attack specifically on the oil tanker because it has an Israeli official. In fact, 
 
 they think it was an Iranian provocation in the Gulf, something to disrupt stability and also to influence the upcoming World Cup games that are 
 
 taking place in Qatar. 
 
So far we've had no official response from the Iranians. But the American officials do say this is fitting a pattern of previous Iranian drone 
 
 attacks on ships in the Gulf -- Hadas Gold, CNN, Jerusalem.

SOARES:  This week, our "Going Green" series is highlighting young activists who are taking some of the world's biggest environmental 
 
 challenges. Today, we travel to Kenya to meet a teenager working to protect Africa's largest lake. Larry Madowo reports. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
(MUSIC PLAYING)
 
RAHMINA PAULLETE, KISUMU ENVIRONMENTAL CHAMPIONS (voice-over):  I am from the indigenous community in Lake Victoria and I have grown up seeing Lake 
 
 Victoria as it has been changing. That is why I am saying that we need to restore the ecosystem. 
 
My name is Rahmina Paullete. I am a 16-year-old climate activist, environmentalist and conservationist. 
 
LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  With tributaries that flow into five East African countries, the Lake Victoria basin is home to around 
 
 40 million people. It is also home to the largest freshwater fishery in the world. 
 <br>[14:50:00]
 
(voice-over):  But now, this incredible resource is under threat. And this young activist wants to save it. 
 
PAULLETE (voice-over):  The situation is really bad. That pollution, the water hyacinth. Mainly fish, especially indigenous fish, are decreasing in 
 
 the lake. 
 
MADOWO (voice-over):  In 2019, Rahmina founded the organization Kisumu Environmental Champions, which works to restore and protect the lake. 
 
PAULLETE (voice-over):  We do cleanups and communities sensitization on proper waste management. Our main objection for this is to bring out 
 
 awareness to solve the climate issues. 
 
MADOWO (voice-over):  In an effort to improve water quality and the declining fish population, Rahmina spends a lot of time removing the 
 
 invasive water hyacinth. But nothing goes to waste with this conversationalist. After harvest, the stems and leaves are trimmed and 
 
 dried and then woven into an array of items at her home workshop. 
 
PAULLETE (voice-over):  We are making a range of products from the hyacinth. Plus, it saves money. We can generate income at the end of the 
 
 day. 
 
MADOWO (voice-over):  But weeds are not the only problem. Trash also impacts Lake Victoria's waterways and shorelines. 
 
PAULLETE (voice-over):  We are at (INAUDIBLE) in Kisumu doing a cleanup and we are hoping that from this (INAUDIBLE) we are able to show many people 
 
 that the little things you do can make a great difference.

Now commit to working extremely hard or leave. That's what Elon Musk's telling Twitter employees in a shocking internal email. The social media 
 
 platform boss is giving staff until Thursday to respond to that very ultimatum. 
 
The memo included a link to include the new expectations, which included long hours and exceptional performance. Those who don't opt in will be let 
 
 go with severance pay. Clare Sebastian joins me now.
 
Pardon me; Clare Duffy. 
 
Clare, good to see you, sorry for getting your name wrong. This is quite the ultimatum. 
 
Do we know what he means by hardcore?
 
How many hours are we talking? Do they have to sleep in the office?
 
CLARE DUFFY, CNN BUSINESS WRITER:  I don't know if we know for sure. With Elon Musk, it can be hard to know what he means when he says things like 
 
 this. He is known for having a really intense working culture at some of his other countries. 
 
In a lot of, ways the culture at Twitter has already become much more hardcore than it was prior to his takeover. He laid off half of Twitter 
 
 staff. That's going to increase the workload for people who remain at the company. 
 
We've seen Twitter employees tweeting about sleeping on the floor at the company already. He wants Twitter employees back in the office. This has 
 
 been a largely remote workforce. 
 
It sounds like the communications people are getting have been sporadic and confusing. He's got these really ambitious goals. People are going to need 
 
 to work really hard to fulfill them. There is a subscription, pay to verify service. He wants to eventually make Twitter a payments processing company. 
 
I think this is all in service of these big goals he has. 
 
SOARES:  What are you hearing from the employees?
 
How many do you think will click on that link?
 
How many will want to be part of this hardcore environment?
 
DUFFY:  It's hard to know. There are employees -- we talk to employees who have been laid off in these layoffs a couple weeks ago. A lot of people 
 
 mentioned being really relieved to be out of the craziness. But there are employees who might not have a choice, who might say, like, they need this 
 
 job. 
 
Employees on visas who are from other countries who need the job to stay in the country, people who have families, it might not be such an easy choice 
 
 to, say I want to leave behind the tumultuous nature of this company. 
 
SOARES:  Let's talk about his leadership style. 
 
Does this give us any idea of the vision he may have for Twitter?
 
You mentioned he sacked already half of his company's workforce. 
 
What is his vision for your Twitter?
 
DUFFY:  He's talked about, in this email he sent today, he's talked about wanting Twitter to become more engineering focused, saying the product 
 
 teams are still going to be important and report to him. But he wants hardcore engineering, it sounds like, to fulfill some of these big 
 
 ambitious plans he has. 
 
He wants Twitter, he talked about wanting to order to become x.com, to become this everything app that has communications and payments. We think 
 
 it's sort of like a WeChat in China moving in that direction. 
 
It sounds like that is his vision. It sounds like this is going to be the last major change for now. He said as much during the hearing today. 
 <br>[14:55:00]
 
In the trial over his Tesla pay package, he said this is going to be the last fundamental workplace reorganization that he's going to do following 
 
 the takeover. So maybe we will start to see some goals unfold. 
 
SOARES:  That is quite something, we will see. Appreciate it, thank you very much. 
 
DUFFY:  Thank you.

 said. 
 
"I have talked a lot about appreciating the moment you're in. And we have worked hard as a team. You guys have worked hard as a team to this moment. 
 
 This is your moment.
