 <br>[15:00:33]
 
BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN HOST: Neck and Neck in PA: A new CNN poll showing Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump still locked in a dead heat in Pennsylvania. A critical battleground state where the Vice President will soon be speaking, we'll take you there live.
 
And Gas Pump Politics: What impact, if any, will falling gas prices in critical battleground states have on the race to the White House?
 
BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: And Ejected and Banned: Two Yankees fans get kicked out of the World Series after ripping the ball away from Dodger star Mookie Betts. Now they won't be allowed in the stadium for Game 5 tonight.
 
We're following these major developing stories and many more all coming in - you laugh - right here to CNN NEWS CENTRAL.
 
SANCHEZ: There is less than a week to go until the election. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are taking their messages to pivotal battlegrounds. And today the candidates are heading to Wisconsin after first making stops in North Carolina.
 
Harris, though, will first make a stop in must-win Pennsylvania. And as they both crisscross the country, the Harris campaign finds itself fending off backlash over comments made by President Biden that seem to refer to Trump supporters as garbage.
 
KEILAR: So all of this as new CNN polling is giving us another snapshot of where the race for the White House stands just six days out. In two of the three blue wall states, Michigan and Wisconsin, Harris is showing a slight lead. The race tied, though, in Pennsylvania. And that is where our coverage begins with CNN's Danny Freeman, who is in Harrisburg with the Harris campaign.
 
Danny, the Vice President addressing Biden's comments today. Tell us what we're hearing from her. DANNY FREEMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's right. Vice President Harris, of course, hoping to come to Harrisburg today in addition to the other battleground states she's visiting to make that pitch about unity. But this comment made by President Biden that you just referenced really has been dominating a lot of the news cycle over the past 12 to 24 hours since that statement was made.
 
The Harris campaign understands this was not a good comment, did not come at a good time and it's not really what the campaign wants to be speaking at today. But as you noted, Vice President Harris has already earlier really distanced herself from those comments, saying that she strongly disagrees with criticizing people based on who they're voting for. She also noted that she thought that President Biden clarified his statements yesterday as well.
 
Meanwhile, we're also learning a little bit more about the campaign's thinking through this particular issue as it's come up for the past day and a half or so. MJ Lee reporting that on the one hand, one advisor said we're not going to lose a single vote, referencing this particular incident right here. Another former administration official, however, saying, quote, "The Biden gaffe yesterday is just so infuriating. Nobody wants him out there." So we'll see how much we see of President Biden in these final days of the campaign.
 
But again, back to where I am right now and where we started earlier. Vice President Harris really trying to drill home, even in the wake of those comments, but even before that as well, that her ticket is the bipartisan one, that a vote for the Harris-Walz ticket is a vote for country over party. Take a listen to what she said in Raleigh about this subject not too long ago.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KAMALA HARRIS (D), VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, CURRENT PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: And it is time for a new chapter where we stop with the pointing fingers at each other and instead let us lock arms with one another, knowing we have so much more in common than what separates us.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FREEMAN: And I'll just note, again, the focus of Vice President Harris' day, perhaps, against the divisive language. We've actually seen some folks in the crowd here who have Puerto Rican flags, even some folks who are not Puerto Rican, but still out here waving Puerto Rican flags, of course, referencing back to the language used by a comedian at President Trump's rally back in Madison Square Garden.
 
So I think that you can see that today is a little bit about the battle of people other than the candidate and their words impacting both of these campaigns. We'll see it here in Harrisburg when this rally begins in just about an hour or so. Boris, Brianna?
 
SANCHEZ: Danny Freeman, live for us in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
 
Danny, thank you so much. Let's go to CNN's Kristen Holmes now with the Trump campaign in Green Bay, Wisconsin.
 <br>[15:05:02]
 
Kristen, talk to us about what the former president has planned there.
 
KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Boris and Brianna, we get to see Donald Trump not only in Wisconsin today, but also Friday as well. He is hitting this battleground state hard as his team tries to chip away at any voters they can ahead of that November 5th election. Now, of course, what we expect from him is more of what we saw earlier today. 
 
He is really trying to take this opportunity with those Biden remarks to flip the narrative from those pre-program remarks, from that joke that comedian told that was vile where he talked about Puerto Rico being a floating island of garbage and turn the tables on Democrats.
 
He spoke about this in North Carolina earlier today. Here's what he said about those Biden remarks.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, CURRENT PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: My response to Joe and Kamala is very simple, you can't lead America if you don't love Americans. You just can't. And you can't be president if you hate the American people and there's a lot of hatred there.
 
Look how they've treated you. They've treated you like garbage, frankly. They've treated you like garbage. You know what, the truth is they've treated our whole country like garbage, whether they meant to or not.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HOLMES: Now, part of the reason that Donald Trump's team sees an opportunity here is if you'll remember what happened in 2016, this was a huge pivoting point for the Donald Trump campaign when Hillary Clinton called Donald Trump supporters a basket of deplorables, something at that point they capitalized on as well.
 
Now, just to be clear, Donald Trump obviously singing a different tune now that he's talking about these Biden remarks. But Donald Trump has often criticized Democrats in some of the harshest of rhetoric, talking about how they're the enemy within when he's talking about Democratic leadership, attacking the party as a whole.
 
So this message of unity is a new one. However, that doesn't take away from the fact that what Biden said has caused outrage among a number of Republicans. They're just going to continue to beat that down as they respond to those remarks.
 
KEILAR: And Kristen, we're also hearing Trump stoke fears of voter fraud in Pennsylvania. What's he saying about that? HOLMES: Yes, you know, Brianna, I'm hesitant to repeat exactly what he's saying because so far we don't have any indication that any of this is true. It is a lot of what we have heard before about how he's saying there's rampant voter fraud, that law enforcement are getting involved.
 
I do want to be very clear, CNN is taking this very seriously. We have teams on the ground. They have been reaching out to county and state officials who say they are investigating every claim of voter fraud there. Also, we heard from the governor last night saying this was just Donald Trump being Donald Trump.
 
That doesn't take away from the fact that these officials on the ground are taking this incredibly seriously. They are trying to run down all of these leads to make sure that there is no voter fraud. We don't have any indication that there is right now. What we're hearing from state and local officials is they are urging patience. 
 
They are urging these voters to be patient, to go through the process and saying that they are doing everything they can to ensure that this is a safe and secure election. And as of now, that is every indication that we have as a network as we are doing our own research and looking into these different claims.
 
SANCHEZ: Yes, and part of that, we should point out, is a conversation we're having with Al Schmidt later this hour. He's the secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. We're going to ask him about those specific accusations.
 
Kristen Holmes live for us in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Thank you so much.
 
KEILAR: So let's discuss now. We have Matt Mowers, former Trump administration official, Republican strategist and the president of the global public strategy firm, Valcour; and Maria Cardona, CNN Political Commentator and Democratic strategist.
 
Maria, this garbage comment by President Biden is not good.
 
MARIA CARDONA, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: It's not good and it's frustrating. But let's be real, people who are outraged about this comment were never going to vote for Kamala Harris. And two things, President Biden walked it back. He clarified his comments. 
 
And it actually gives Vice President Harris a chance to distance herself from those comments and to clarify what she has been very clear about, both in her speech last night and in all the comments she's been saying today, that she is the one who is embracing people who won't vote for her. She is embracing Republicans. She's going to not call them the enemy. She's, in fact, going to give them a seat at the table.
 
So spare me when Donald Trump, who has called America a garbage can, which means he's calling all of us trash, when he has called everyone that does not support him the enemy from within when he has called ...
 
MATT MOWERS, FORMER TRUMP ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: (INAUDIBLE) ... CARDONA: ... when he has called Latinos saying that we poison the blood of the country. Let's take a look at what's going on in Pennsylvania and in all the battleground states with the Puerto Rican community. What Biden said doesn't compare with the effect of calling the island of Puerto Rico a trash can, because you are seeing so many Puertorriquenos and Latinos across the country.
 <br>[15:10:04]
 
They have said to me, Maria, what Trump did was revolco el avispero, which means he messed with a hornet's nest.
 
You are seeing former Trump Puertorriqueno voters saying, I am not going to vote for this blank person, cuss word in Spanish ...
 
MOWERS: Why you say that, I'm just curious by the way.
 
CARDONA: ... because he is not respecting us and we are outraged and we're going to show that outrage at the ballot box.
 
SANCHEZ: I sense your eagerness to jump in, Matt.
 
MOWERS: Yes.
 
SANCHEZ: We're actually going to play a clip for you ...
 
MOWERS: Sure.
 
SANCHEZ: ... of one of those Puerto Rican Trump supporters that is walking it back in a moment.
 
Donald Trump has said a lot of things and you can argue and you can try to parse the words, but generally there's an irony to him saying that to be president you have to love all Americans, given the rhetoric that he's used in the past.
 
MOWERS: Well, see, there's actually a key difference. And first, I want to give Maria the award for probably polishing the biggest turd of the day and doing it very well. Look, what Joe Biden said is going to incentivize a lot of Americans who feel personally offended, not by some comedian but - that no one's ever heard of, but by the sitting president of the United States, Kamala Harris' current boss.
 
CARDONA: Who's not on the ballot, by the way.
 
MOWERS: But yet - well, but Kamala Harris three months ago ...
 
CARDONA: Not on the ballot.
 
MOWERS: ... said he should be on the ballot and said he should still be president for four more years.
 
CARDONA: It's Kamala Harris on the ballot now.
 
MOWERS: Yes. And she also said he should be president for four more years until three months ago. CARDONA: She is welcoming everyone to the table.
 
MOWERS: But on this point, here's the key difference, Donald Trump will obviously go after politicians. He certainly has made comments, some of which I disagree with about Nancy Pelosi and others. What he hasn't done is broad brush an entire group, half of the country, the way that Joe Biden just did.
 
KEILAR: All right ...
 
SANCHEZ: He ...
 
CARDONA: Oh, come on now.
 
SANCHEZ: He said about the state - about city of Baltimore that it's rodent-infested and disgusting. An entire city. He has said about immigrants ...
 
CARDONA: Detroit.
 
SANCHEZ: ... to her point that ...
 
CARDONA: Yes.
 
SANCHEZ: ... they're genetically inferior ...
 
CARDONA: Mm-hmm.
 
SANCHEZ: ... that they're poisoning the blood of the country. Blood doesn't have a legal status, so he's talking about a group of people ...
 
MOWERS: No.
 
SANCHEZ: ... that are in the country, many of them legally like ...
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
CARDONA: The city of Detroit ...
 
MOWERS: Well, let's be clear here ...
 
CARDONA: The city of Detroit ...
 
MOWERS: ... he's talking - well, let's be clear here, though. He's been talking about the fact that we have seen, unfortunately, awful results in our urban areas as a result of policies and management from Democratic politicians. Whether it's the mayor of Baltimore, whether it's the mayor of Detroit, whether it's past Democrat governors of Maryland ...
 
SANCHEZ: Again, you can parse (INAUDIBLE) ...
 
MOWERS: ... and so those are words ...
 
(Crosstalk) MOWERS: And by the way, that's why (INAUDIBLE) ...
 
SANCHEZ: ... the White House seems to be trying to add in a foster feed of what Biden said.
 
MOWERS: (INAUDIBLE) ...
 
SANCHEZ: ... but nevertheless, the sentiment --
 
MOWERS: Yeah.
 
SANCHEZ: ... is the same. And there is still an irony that meet pedal ...
 
CARDONA: Exactly.
 
SANCHEZ: ... he's - they're essentially using rhetoric that no one should use in talking about what is there to gain from an election, in talking about policy, in talking about leadership over the country, Matt.
 
MOWERS: But - but let me say this, all polls show this, Donald Trump, if he wins on Tuesday, which I believe he will win in a narrow race, is going to have the most diverse coalition that any Republican candidate for president has had in over a generation. And by the way, Kamala Harris' coalition is going to be more dependent upon white voters than any Democratic politician.
 
Donald Trump's going to break records with African-American voters. He's going to break records with Hispanic voters. So what does it say? That despite all the outrage that gets manufactured over here, he's still going to do better with all these voter groups. It means they're looking beyond ...
 
CARDONA: I can tell you.
 
MOWERS: ... even some of the rhetoric. They're looking at the policies and that's what they're going to vote for on Tuesday.
 
CARDONA: First of all, I don't think that that's true. Because what we are seeing with the Latino vote is that they are coming home to Vice President Harris. They are coming home to the Democratic Party. We are seeing the polls that actually know how to poll Latino voters using Spanish language callers. Kamala Harris is surpassing the numbers right now that Joe Biden had in 2020.
 
Add to that, the comments about Puerto Rico being trashed, about Latinos poisoning the blood and that number is going to skyrocket. I've talked to black leaders, black pollsters, they are saying exactly the same thing about the African-American vote. The rally on Sunday night, the Donald Trump MAGA hate rally, didn't just go after Puerto Rico calling it an ocean of trash. They called Vice President Harris a prostitute. They called Hillary Clinton the B word. They insulted Muslims. They insulted Jewish voters. They insulted whole swaths of America. And that is what Americans are looking at now. And they're contrasting that with Kamala Harris, who is the one saying, I respect everyone, even the people who didn't vote for me. That is the choice before us right now. And people are going to choose the person who is going to work on her to-do list for Americans and not somebody who is hunched over, obsessed with vengeance and retribution, focused on his enemies list.
 
KEILAR: The thing is we don't actually know. We don't actually know, because the polls will not have registered these comments, so we don't know. We are waiting to see ...
 
CARDONA: Exactly.
 
KEILAR: ... and there is a poll coming up, which is the election.
 
MOWERS: That's right.
 
CARDONA: Mm-hmm.
 
KEILAR: It's going to tell us ...
 
MOWERS: It will poll the matters ...
 
CARDONA: Right.
 
KEILAR: ... it's going to tell us, but I wonder what you think as you're looking at some of the early vote that is coming in. Each year - I know each election is - 2020 kind of tricky because it was the pandemic.
 
CARDONA: Yeah, that's right.
 
KEILAR: And we're seeing sort of some shifting emphasis on mail-in voting that I think has strategists scratching their heads, not quite sure whether they can bank on patterns they're seeing.
 <br>[15:15:06]
 
But what do you think about, you know, a lot of Republicans showing up for early vote and what that means is that cannibalizing day of vote, what do you think?
 
MOWERS: It's not. I've spoken to both the folks who do all the data for the Republican National Committee to actually operatives on the ground. You're seeing a disproportionate number of these voters are either first-time voters or they're low-propensity voters, voters who are regular, may not show up. And you compare that to the Democratic voters who are showing up, who are much more consistent voters as a percentage overall. 
 
In particular, in the Sun Belt states: Nevada, Arizona, North Carolina, Georgia, you're seeing Republicans for the first time in a number of cycles, not even looking at 2020, which, yes, was a bit of an aberration. But compared to 2016, 2012, 2008, Republicans are actually going to go into Election Day with a lead in a number of these states, which they haven't done before.
 
And, by the way, it's going to be a much closer margin going into Election Day in the Rust Belt states than it was in 2020 or 2016 as well. You are seeing signs of enthusiasm. And if you're a Republican strategist trying to parse who those are, these are the people you want to be showing up. 
 
These are not the people who are just going to show up every single year and vote for you regardless. These are the folks who maybe are listening to that Joe Rogan podcast or maybe keep debating about, eh, do I want to go out to vote or sit on the couch. They are showing up right now. That's the reason why you see Republicans so optimistic right now.
 
CARDONA: Let me tell you what Democrats are seeing in the early vote data. And Matt's right, we all talked about this, this is not 2020. You can't really compare. The early vote data in general is down for both parties. Republicans are excited because they do see growth in the early vote data for them because more Republicans are voting early now than they did in 2020, even though Donald Trump is still poo- pooing early vote and mail-in vote, which I think is bad for Republicans in general.
 
But right now, Democrats lead in the early vote by over 500,000 votes nationwide and especially in the battleground states. So that is a good number for Democrats. However, we're also seeing independents and Republicans who are voting. We can't really say who they're voting for. And I have a prediction that they, the independents, are going to break for Vice President Harris.
 
And there are a lot of Republicans, and I know this from people that are going door to door, who are telling me, Maria, I am going to vote for Kamala Harris. I have had it with Donald Trump and the hatred that he is spewing. That is not what I represent, especially women. Republicans are telling me, I do not want to raise my daughter in a country that's going to have - where she's going to have less rights than I did.
 
SANCHEZ: One more question, because I promised that I would ask it, and I am crestfallen truly, Matt, that we don't have the clip of Nicky Jam saying this. It was also in Spanish, so it's not like we would be able to, like - not everyone would be able to understand ...
 
CARDONA: I can translate it.
 
KEILAR: We get the vibe.
 
SANCHEZ: ... what he's saying. We would get the vibe. Basically, this was a reggaeton artist that came up on stage. There he is. We have the clip.
 
KEILAR: (INAUDIBLE) ...
 
CARDONA: Yes.
 
SANCHEZ: We have the clip. He's obviously in the back of a very fancy car and he's talking about ...
 
KEILAR: Let's do it. Do you want to listen a little?
 
CARDONA: Yes. Yes, let's listen.
 
MOWERS: Boris, can you translate for us?
 
CARDONA: Let's listen.
 
SANCHEZ: Sure.
 
KEILAR: Yes, okay.
 
NICKY JAM: (Foreign language) ...
 
SANCHEZ: Many Latinos living in the United States, including us, many immigrants that are struggling because of the economy and that's chiefly the reason he says that he supported former President Trump, came out on stage. Trump had no idea who he was. He was on stage saying, let's bring Nicky up here. She's so hot.
 
Obviously, you recognize Nicky is not a she. He is now revoking his endorsement of Donald Trump, partly because of the blowback over the event on Saturday. Obviously, he's not a household name, but in some communities, he's a very popular artist. He means a lot.
 
CARDONA: Yes.
 
SANCHEZ: What's the significance of him coming out now and withdrawing his endorsement of Donald Trump?
 
MOWERS: Well, and look, was it on Sunday or was it because he was called the wrong name? I don't know, you know, exactly why it was.
 
CARDONA: It was after Sunday.
 
MOWERS: But it was, you know, a number of things.
 
SANCHEZ: He specifically mentions the joke.
 
CARDONA: Yes. Because of the rally.
 
MOWERS: But look, what I'll say is that if you were to actually go back even a week ago, and I, you know, I get it, we're six days out from election. Democrats are going to try to spin whatever they can to try to say, look, it was really about the Puerto Rican community in Pennsylvania regardless. This was never ...
 
CARDONA: It's not a (INAUDIBLE) ...
 
MOWERS: ... this was not the building blocks that the Democratic Party thought they were going to have to win Pennsylvania by. If you look at the vast majority of polling, voters are not undecided right now. And, yes, maybe there's going to be one or two people who flip. I guarantee if we found a couple anecdotes, we could find some on the other side. At the end of the day, though, this is a very baked in electorate. Voters have made up their mind. They're not going to change it in the final six days, regardless of what you say. What it does change is whether voters are motivated to show up or not. And it's the reason why I think President Biden's comments last night, calling half of Americans garbage, is going to resonate with over half - about half of the country, over half the country, who are then going to be more motivated to show up as a result of the fact that they feel like they were attacked ...
 
CARDONA: But see ...
 
MOWERS: ... by Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
 
CARDONA: ... but as a strategist, what I'm hearing from what Nicky Jam did and from what I'm hearing is what voters are saying, they are switching their votes. In Pennsylvania, 500,000 Puertorriquenos more in the battleground states. In Nevada, John King had a piece about Latinos, not Puertorriquenos, Latinos who were saying, that didn't just piss off Puertorriquenos, it pissed the Latino community off because they're talking about us. And people are calling into my show a Latino DJ saying they are switching their vote.
 <br>[15:20:02]
 
So if you think that that has no effect, keep thinking that. We'll talk on Tuesday.
 
KEILAR: Let - well, it's probably going to be not Tuesday, so let's book, just to be careful, we'll book on the 11th.
 
CARDONA: There you go.
 
SANCHEZ: Yes.
 
KEILAR: Just to be careful.
 
CARDONA: Yes.
 
MOWERS: Yes.
 
KEILAR: And we'll revisit it maybe we'll see ...
 
MOWERS: I think we'll get over the winner by the time ...
 
KEILAR: ... well, let's see who wins.
 
MOWERS: ... by the time everyone wakes on Tuesday.
 
CARDONA: Let's do it. Let's do it.
 
MOWERS: That's my position.
 
SANCHEZ: Oh, wow.
 
CARDONA: I agree. MOWERS: On television.
 
CARDONA: I agree.
 
SANCHEZ: Bold prediction.
 
MOWERS: On television.
 
CARDONA: I agree. I actually agree.
 
MOWERS: All right.
 
SANCHEZ: Wow.
 
MOWERS: You found some common ground here, so ...
 
SANCHEZ: Matt, Maria, appreciate the lively conversation.
 
MOWERS: You got it. Thank you so much.
 
CARDONA: Thank you, Boris.
 
KEILAR: En fuego.
 
SANCHEZ: Yes, very much so. Very much so.
 
Still to come, as we mentioned, former President Trump continues to stoke fears of widespread voter fraud in Pennsylvania. We're going to speak to the Commonwealth's top election official in just moments.
 
KEILAR: Plus, a mystery that is playing out in the nation's capital, people are asking who is responsible for political art that is popping up, art that appears to taunt former President Trump.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[15:25:18]
 
SANCHEZ: We're seeing zero movement from either candidate in new CNN polling out today, showing Harrison Trump tied at 48 percent in the must-win state, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The extremely tight race comes as Trump continues to stoke fears about election fraud there.
 
Joining us to discuss this is the secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Al Schmidt.
 
Secretary, thank you so much for being with us. I just, right off the bat, want to give you the opportunity to respond directly to former President Trump's claims from earlier today. He wrote, quote, "Pennsylvania is cheating and getting caught at large-scale levels rarely seen before." He calls on supporters to report cheating to authorities, saying law enforcement must act now. Your thoughts?
 
AL SCHMIDT, (R) PHILADELPHIA CITY COMMISSIONER: The people who run elections in Pennsylvania at the county level are professional civil servants who are all operating within the confines of the Pennsylvania Election Code and the laws in Pennsylvania. There is no evidence of anything indicating any sort of widespread voter fraud or if at all.
 
And I think it's important that our county partners always be vigilant. You never want to, you know, turn the other way whenever there are allegations or anything like that. You always have to investigate to make sure that our elections in Pennsylvania are free, fair, safe and secure.
 
SANCHEZ: Trump pointed to an incident in Lancaster County where officials are investigating some 2,500 voter registration forms that they suspect could be fraudulent. Can you take us through what you think happened there and do you expect that this might be an issue in other counties?
 
SCHMIDT: So we were in contact with Lancaster County, as we are all of our counties right from the beginning, any time there's any allegation of anything like this to provide guidance and all the rest. Lancaster did what any other county would do, which is to investigate and make sure that potentially fraudulent voter registration applications are not processed.
 
And, Boris, I really want to draw a difference between a voter registration application and a ballot.
 
SANCHEZ: Right.
 
SCHMIDT: A voter registration application, voters are including their driver's license number, they're including their Social Security number, their name, their address and all the rest. And when you show up to vote, you're providing ID for the first time when you vote in Pennsylvania.
 
So there's all sorts of safeguards built into the system. We look forward to hearing from Lancaster what the results of their investigation are to understand the extent to which, if at all, this - they encountered potentially fraudulent voter registration applications.
 
SANCHEZ: So important to make that distinction. There's a difference between an application and an actual ballot. And there are safeguards in place to make sure that those applications actually allow folks to access ballots.
 
So moments ago, a judge requested or rather a judge granted a request from the Trump campaign to extend on demand mail voting in Bucks County through Friday. The lawsuit is alleging that voters who were in line applying for mail-in ballots yesterday, it was supposed to be the last day yesterday, were turned away. Were any voters turned away that you can confirm? What's your reaction to this decision by the judge?
 
SCHMIDT: Yes, and I saw that decision right before coming on and joining you today. Mail-in ballot - while mail-in ballot voting in Pennsylvania has decreased since 2020 during that peak COVID environment, so the number of voters applying to vote by mail, although widely embraced and is a great alternative and improvement to voter accessibility, is still less used than in that 2020 peak COVID environment. But one thing that has changed is an increased use of our board of elections offices. We don't have early voting the way other states have early voting. Voters do have the ability to go to a board of elections office before the deadline, which was yesterday, to apply for a mail in ballot, have that application processed, receive their mail in ballot, complete it if they choose on the spot and return it all in one visit.
 
So that is Pennsylvania's equivalent of mail-in ballot voting. Many counties, as we saw, really struggled with the volume of people showing up to do that. It's a very length - labor intensive in our county partners. And I visited all 67 counties in Pennsylvania in the last year to sit down with them to understand what their challenges are to provide them with whatever materials, whether it's computers or anything else that they needed, hardware, to make sure that they can process things.
