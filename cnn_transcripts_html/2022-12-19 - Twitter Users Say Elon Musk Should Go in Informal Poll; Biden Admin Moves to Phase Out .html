THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
<br>[10:30:00]
 
ERICA HILL, CNN ANCHOR:  CNN's Jean Casarez has been following the details here. What more are police saying about this shooting this morning, Jean?
 
JEAN CASAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  They want to know the motive. And that is the big question right now, why would someone go to this high end condo building and shoot six people. And we understand that they were not altogether. There were various condos that were targeted at that moment by the gunman.
 
Now, there is one surviving victim. They were rushed to hospital, serious injuries, but they could be extremely valuable in this homicide investigation.
 
I want to you listen to York Regional Police Chief Jim MacSween talk about the facts as we know them at this point.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHIEF JIM MACSWEEN, YORK REGIONAL POLICE:  At about 7:20 P.M. tonight, our officers responded to what was an active shooting call here at 9235 Jane Street. Once the officers arrived, they were met with a scene of -- a horrendous scene where numerous victims were deceased and there was an engagement between the officers and a subject. And throughout that engagement and after the engagement, the subject was deceased as well.
 
As a result of that, the special investigation unit has been called in to do that portion of the investigation. Our homicide unit is also engaged as well to do a parallel investigation on the shooting portion that occurred prior to our officers engaging here.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CASAREZ:  So, this is a crime scene and the forensics investigative unit is also on the scene right now.
 
One thing to note, obviously, Canada has extremely district gun control, and it was just in October that went into effect banning the sale, the purchase or the transfer of handguns.
 
Now, we don't know what type of a gun was used in this situation, but it was a mass shooting and this is very rare in Canada.
 
HILL:  Yes, absolutely. Jean, I appreciate the update. Thank you.
 
Millions of Twitter users have now spoken and they say it is time for Elon Musk to go. He posted a poll himself after yet another quick reversal on a major decision, this time was whether users should be allowed to post links to their social media accounts with other social media providers on other platforms.
 
Is this really just a ploy to keep all of us talking about Twitter or will Musk follow through? Will he, as he promised, follow the results of that poll, which was, yes, he should step down?
 
Joining us now to discuss, Sara Fischer, Media Reporter for Axios. So, Sara, when we look at this, it is important to note he said there is no succession plan in place in that poll. I guess it is a two-part question. Do we think he's actually going to step down? And, if so, I mean, are there any adults left? Do we have a sense of who would or could run the company?
 
SARA FISCHER, CNN MEDIA ANALYST:  Two very good questions, Erica. Look, I do think he's going to step down for two reasons. One, he's facing enormous pressure from investors in Tesla to step down. They're seeing the stock plummet lead leading up to this vote. Of course, the stock is up this morning in response to the fact that he might actually be going away.
 
And then the second reason is that Elon Musk has a track record of using polls to make actual decisions, even though they're not very scientific. An example of that was that he polled his user base asking whether or not he should bring Donald Trump back. Of course, the user base said, yes, and then he invited Donald Trump to return.
 
And so I do think Elon Musk will step down. But, to your point, is there an obvious successor? There is a group of people who came in to help Elon Musk do those mass layoffs in the early November to help him reshape the company. A lot of those people are now gone and who is remaining are a few close allies, some from his other companies, like SpaceX and the Boring Company.
 
It is unclear if he's going to tackle one of those folks to be a CEO. Some of them have already said, like David Sacks, an investor in California, that he doesn't plan to move on with Twitter full-time or if he'll bring in an outsider. But what remains clear, Erica, is whoever this person is that he brings in, it is definitely going to be an ally, someone who will run the company as Elon Musk wishes, even if he's not the day-to-day CEO.
 
HILL:  And that's the sense, right? Even if there's somebody else in charge, it could be Elon Musk pulling the strings. Who knows?
 
There is also, and I know you've seen it, floating out around there in the Twitter verse, if you will, there is talk about whether this is perhaps just part of Elon Musk's plan to really drive the company into the ground. Is there any evidence of that? And what would the goal of doing that be? How could it help him? FISCHER:  I definitely don't think that is his plan. I think Elon Musk means what he says when he wants to turn this company around. And I think he is trying but he is failing in many regards. Advertisers are fleeing. He had to delay the launch of the subscription product.
 
I think what this means is that Elon Musk is just going to fulfill a promise he's long told investors at Tesla that he would, which is that he'll get a new CEO. It might just be coming sooner rather than later given all of the fallout around him.
 
HILL:  One of the issues that cropped up over the weekend, and even a lawmaker telling CNN about this in some of our colleague, Brian Fung's reporting, were people, right, pushing to their accounts on other social media platforms. This happens all the time. You can find me on Twitter app. Well, now, we're seeing it -- seeing over on Post, see me on Mastodon, and some people trying to post those links.
 <br>[10:35:05]
 
They were told that it was potentially malware so it couldn't be posted on Twitter. Is that running afoul of the FTC? Where do those concerns stand?
 
FISCHER:  Well, it is definitely not great for users. I mean, users want to be able to tweet and promote other links to other social media sites. And it seems like what Elon Musk is doing is very arbitrary. He makes up rules that he can be able to ban people he doesn't like.
 
As far as whether or not there is a consumer deception problem with the FTC, where they would need to get involved, I think at this point it is unlikely. It seems that Elon Musk is starting to reinstate some of those accounts where he blocked links. I also think he'll notice that it is bad for user engagement, and so it is not going to be something that he does long-term. But if he does continue to move forward with not allowing people to upload links to other sites, there could be a problem.
 
I just think regulators at this point, they're in the same position as us as journalists. They're waiting to see what actually happens, if anything permanent actually happens, before they would actually step in.
 
HILL:  And what about -- we saw threats people are leaving, and now they say, well, you can find me in both places. Are we see insignificant numbers, A, people leaving Twitter, and, B, these alternative platforms, like a Post or a Mastodon, do they see an increase in their numbers? Is that an alternative now?
 
FISCHER:  I think for the most part, engagement with Twitter continues to rise. And so Elon Musk, who has been touting those figures, thinks that what he's doing is bringing more people to the platform, but the question is who.
 
Now, I think a lot of the established Twitter users, people like journalists, some politicians, Hollywood celebrities, they are sick of this and they are the ones that are moving on endorsing other platforms, like the ones that you've mentioned, Mastodon, et cetera.
 
But do I think that in mass droves we're seeing exit, not at this point. And part of the reason, Erica, is that those other platforms just aren't as sophisticated technologically yet, as Twitter continues to be, even with all of these challenges.
 
HILL:  Right, and big name people aside, journalists aside, the concern is for the Average Joe. We think back to the Arab Spring, we think about Ferguson and why Twitter was important in those moments. We'll what it is moving forward. Sara, I always appreciate it. Thank you.
 
FISCHER:  Thank you.
 
JIM SCIUTTO, CNN ANCHOR:  Coming up, flipping the switch. The Biden administration poised to phase out fluorescent lights in favor of more energy efficient LED bulbs.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:40:00]
 
SCIUTTO:  This first on CNN, we learned the Biden administration is proposing a new rule that would phase out compact fluorescent light bulbs and move the market to more energy efficient LEDs.
 
HILL:  The Department of Energy aims to finalize that rule by the end of President Biden's first term. Officials say the bulbs will save both energy and money.
 
Joining us now with more, CNN National Correspondent Rene Marsh. So, just how much money are we talking here that we could save, Rene?
 
RENE MARSH, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Right. So, Erica and Jim, I mean, these are the light bulbs that we're talking about here. This is the compact fluorescent light bulb and this is the LED. This is let efficient than this one. And when we say less efficient, we mean it takes more energy to generate light in this bulb than it does in this one, and that is why the Biden administration is pushing towards LED.
 
So, how much is it going to save? The Department of Energy is estimating that it could save American consumers some $20 billion over the course of 30 years. But not only that, it can cut greenhouse gas emissions roughly equal to the electricity used in 29 million homes over the course of a year.
 
Now, this spring, the Biden administration finalized a rule that basically phase out this thing here. This is the old school Thomas Edison-type of light bulb with the filament in the middle here. This is completely phased out by next summer. But what they're doing here now is looking to phase out all of the less efficient light bulbs simply in the name of savings for consumers as well as cutting these greenhouse gas emissions.
 
As you remember, both Jim and Erica, this is Biden's goal to be a net zero emissions economy by the year 2050. So, this is a part of that. SCIUTTO:  Yes. Listen, one of things I could actually do at home is change light bulbs. And I've done the math on these. I mean, LEDs are like a fraction, particularly, like of incandescent bulbs, if you look at them like based on length of time and how much energy it uses. Has this been in the works for a long time?
 
MARSH:  It has been for quite some time. But if you remember, the Trump administration kind of put up the brakes on this -- this light revolution, in a sense, trying to make it difficult to make this move to LEDs, but now, the Biden administration now moving forward. Jim?
 
HILL:  All right, and we'll be watching. Rene, I appreciate the update. Thank you.
 
MARSH:  Sure.
 
SCIUTTO:  Well, some, including us, these two folks right here, calling it the greatest World Cup final ever played. I mean, it was great to watch.
 
HILL:  One was happier with the outcome than the other. But you know what? I am there to cheer on a good match.
 
SCIUTTO:  And $5 richer.
 
HILL:  Argentina lifting the trophy after a thrilling final against France, the defending champions.
 
CNN Sports Anchor Andy Scholes joining us now with more on this epic showdown between two of soccer's biggest stars. I mean, it really was a match for the ages.
 
ANDY SCHOLES, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR:  Oh my goodness, guys, the game was so good, the emotions there at the end when it went back and forth, incredible. And arguably the greatest player ever, Lionel Messi for Argentina, going up against the game's brightest young star, France's Kylian Mbappe, and both were incredible.
 <br>[10:45:01]
 
I saw great American sports comparison to this. It is this final was like if Michael Jordan went up against LeBron in game 7 at the NBA Finals and both of them went for 50. People are going to be talking about this game forever.
 
And for Messi, it really cements his legacy. The only thing missing from his trophy case was a World Cup title for Argentina. And at 35 years old, in his fifth and final World Cup, he got it.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LIONEL MESSI, 2022 WORLD CUP GOLDEN BALL WINNER:  It is madness that it happened the way that it did, but it is amazing.
 
I said at one point that God was going to give it to me. I don't know why I foresaw it. I felt like it was going to be this one. (END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SCHOLES:  Yes. And check out the scenes in Buenos Aries, easily more than a million people are in the streets celebrating their first World Cup title since 1986. And just a little while ago, Messi posting on Instagram on the plane with the trophy, the team is going to arrive back home in Argentina later on tonight.
 
All right, there were three NFL games that ended on walk-off touchdowns yesterday, and the one in Vegas is being called the dumbest play in NFL history. The game was tied at 24 with three seconds on the clock. It looked like the Patriots and Raiders were going to overtime. New England hands the ball off to Rhamondre Stevenson here, who is going for a big game, but then for some inexplicable reason, Stevenson lobs it to Jakobi Meyers, Meyers runs backwards and throws it across the field. Raiders' Defensive End Chandler Jones grabs it out of mid- air, stiff-armed Mac Jones before going in for the game-winning touchdown with no time left on the clock. Vegas won 30-24. And after the game, Meyers taking responsibility for that blunder.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JAKOBI MEYERS, NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS WIDE RECEIVER:  Just trying to do too much, trying to be a hero, I guess, call it timing. And ain't seen a dude back tried to throw the ball. I guess I was just doing too much, you know what I'm saying. I should have just went down.
 
JOSH MCDANIELS, LAS VEGAS RAIDERS HEAD COACH:  Probably the most insane ending I think I've ever been a part of. But we'll take it.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SCHOLES:  All right. And we had a controversial ending to the Commanders and Giants last night. So, Commanders were on the goal line trying to tie the game in the final minute. Brian Robinson scores but the official called Receiver Terry McLaurin for illegal formation for not being on the line. And check this out, you can see McLaurin talk to the official before the snap. And he said after the game, he even asked the official, and the official said he was good but then still flagged him.
 
The Giants were able to hold the Commanders out of the end zone after that penalty to win 20-12. But, guys, a lot of people are shaking their heads and wondering what was going on with that play. Because usually you see the receiver point to the official, he says you're good, it is good. But the official still threw the flag. Really fishy stuff there.
 
SCIUTTO:  No questions from this Giants fan, just selfish motivation.
 
SCHOLES:  A lot of people in D.C. not happy this morning about this.
 
HILL:  All right. Andy, thank you.
 
Just ahead here, it is a critical day on Capitol Hill. The January 6th committee set to hold its final public meeting just hours, where they're expected to reveal criminal referrals for former President Trump.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:50:00]
 
SCIUTTO:  We have some stunningly heartbreaking news to share with you this morning that our colleague, our friend and truly distinguished CNN journalist, Drew Griffin, passed away in the last 24 hours. Drew had been with CNN for nearly two decades. In that time, he was responsible for some of the most impactful journalism of this company in politics, sports, government, big business. He was an a good man, a tremendous journalist, a huge part of this network.
 
HILL:  He absolutely was. He asked the tough questions, as anybody who watched CNN knows. He chased down folks who didn't want to hear them, didn't want to answer them. He made a real difference in the lives of countless people.
 
Here is Anderson Cooper now with a look back at Drew's remarkable life.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DREW GRIFFIN, CNN SENIOR INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT:  It was so hot.
 
ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR (voice over):  During her nearly two decades at CNN, Drew Griffin was known for his tenacious reporting.
 
GRIFFIN:  Are you worried you'll be indicted before the election, sir?
 
COOPER:  His interviews were unwavering.
 
GRIFFIN:  I don't think you understand how votes are cast, collected and tabulated in this country.
 
COOPER:  And he gave a voice though those who didn't have one.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We don't expect it to be easy. We don't expect the truth to be easy.
 
COOPER:  Drew was a gifted storyteller, dedicated to seeking the truth and holding the powerful accountable.
 
GRIFFIN:  What do you continue to push the lie that the 2020 election was stolen?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It is not a lie.
 
GRIFFIN:  It's a lie. You have no proofs. We've looked at all of the facts. You don't have the facts.
 
COOPER:  And Drew's stories had real world impact.
 
GRIFFIN:  Wolf, Uber doesn't release the number of drivers who are accused of sexual assault, so CNN decided to count up ourselves. COOPER:  After CNN questioned Uber about a string of sexual assaults by drivers, the company made major safety changes to its app and revised its policies.
 
WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR:  Excellent reporting. Thanks to you and your team.
 
COOPER:  Drew exposed serious issues at V.A. hospitals across the country, revealing a broken system, veterans dying while waiting for care.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  As a particular veteran was screaming, please, do whatever you can. Don't let the V.A. do this to another patient or another veteran. We do not deserve this type of treatment.
 
COOPER:  That led to the resignation of the V.A.'s secretary and an overhaul of the V.A.'s scheduling system.
 
He covered business and terrorism, the environment and politics.
 
GRIFFIN:  Mr. Burch? Mr. Burch?
 
COOPER:  And there were many people over the years who didn't want to answer his questions.
 
GRIFFIN:  Please talk to us, director? Director Hellman (ph)?
 
Did the background checks of those companies not reveal the fact that you're accused torture and murder?
 
Do you know Alex Ferdinand (ph), a convicted felon who apparently runs one of these clinics and has been billing the state of California for several years despite the fact that there have been complaints?
 <br>[10:55:04]
 
COOPER:  Drew won most of journalism's big awards but that's not what motivated him. He cared about people and how they were impacted.
 
While he was covering the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, he ended rescuing a man from floodwaters.
 
GRIFFIN:  Don't fall backwards. All right, sir, are you all right? Hold on. Hold on.
 
COOPER:  His job as a correspondent took him all across the country --
 
GRIFFIN:  It wasn't that long ago that these wild Pawnee Grasslands were just that, wild. Now, almost everywhere you look is a gas rig.
 
COOPER:  -- and to different parts of the world. But his favorite place was home. He was deeply devoted to his family, his wife, Margot, and his three children, Ele, Louis and Miles, as well as two grandchildren.
 
Drew Griffin will be missed by all of us. (END VIDEOTAPE)
 
SCIUTTO:  Of course, this is a loss of a friend primarily but also a great journalist. And if you talk about impactful journalism, his story, for instance, on V.A. hospitals, that likely saved lives, right, the changes made in the wake of that saved veterans' lives.
 
HILL:  Such important reporting, such an incredible colleague and friend to so many of us, a gifted storyteller, as Anderson said, and above all, so devoted to his family. Our heart goes out to all of them.
 
CNN continues after this quick break.
