(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BECKY ANDERSON, CNNI HOST: Well, I want to take you to Warsaw. Now Poland's President speaking after holding talks with Joe Biden. This is the Head of 
 
 Joe Biden's speech which will follow Andrzej Duda, let's listen in.
 
ANDRZEJ DUDA, POLISH PRESIDENT: Directly from Kyiv plunged in the darkness of Russian aggression. And Kyiv just like the rest of Ukraine is heroically 
 
 defended today by the Ukrainians, the defenders of their homeland. We are meeting at a special place in Warsaw, the capital of Poland at the food of 
 
 the royal castle which symbolizes the excellence of the Poland, Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth that symbol of excellence of Poland.
 <br>[11:20:00]
 
DUDA: In the 17th and 18th centuries, their royal castle in which the Polish, same deliberated and Castle in which the constitution of the Third 
 
 of May was passed in 1790, when the first constitution in Europe and the second in the world after the American one.
 
That was a constitution, which had landmark contribution into the development of the free world, our civilization today. The symbol of the 
 
 Republic of Poland, which was demolished and destroyed during that Second World War, it was burning in front of the eyes of the whole world, and then 
 
 it lay in ruins under the German occupation.
 
Here the Warsaw insurgents were dying, while fighting with the hated occupiers. And then after the Second World War, when we found ourselves in 
 
 that Soviet sphere of influence, it was being rebuilt by the effort of the entire nation for 10s of years, so that it could be reconstructed again, 
 
 and become a symbol of the rebirth of Poland.
 
I'm mentioning this, because today that we are looking at burning cities. We are hearing horrible news about Russian terror. We are saying, killed 
 
 people, people are murdered, we can see demolished settlements pictures, like from the Second World War, something that was supposed not to be 
 
 repeated in Europe once again.
 
Today it is a horrible reality of our neighbors, just because Russia once again wants to become an empire to implement its ambitions of enslaving 
 
 other nations. There is no our acceptance to that. We do not the whole free world does not agree to that the President of the United States, the leader 
 
 of the free world, Joe Biden has made a spectacular gesture.
 
Yesterday in the morning, he stood in Kyiv. Against all expectations, he put his foot on Ukrainian soil where war is raging; he demonstrated that a 
 
 free world and its leader are not afraid of anything. He showed that Ukraine is not alone, that it is supported by the most powerful state in 
 
 the world and by the most powerful armed forces in the world, and that it is supported by the North Atlantic Alliance.
 
And that this is a serious support, which will not fade away. That is a big sign. We are all together, standing by the side of Ukraine right from the 
 
 start. On the 23rd of February, one day before the Russian aggression against Ukraine one year ago, I visited Kyiv together with the president of 
 
 our neighboring with --. We talked with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
 
Volodymyr told us we will defend ourselves. Putin thinks that we would give up right away that he would control Ukraine that he would occupied our 
 
 state, state that he would grab our land, we will fight till the death till the end we are not going to surrender. And exactly in a few hours, Russian 
 
 missiles fell in Ukraine.
 
At full scale Russian invasion started, everybody thought that Ukraine would fall within 72 hours within three days. Ukraine did not fall until 
 
 today, thanks to the heroism of the defenders of Ukraine, thanks to the heroism of Ukrainian soldiers. But also thanks to the support, support 
 
 given to Ukraine by the free world to make sure that the imperial ambitions of enslaving other nations are punished, and that they are never reborn 
 
 again.
 
And therefore all of us are saying today, Ukraine has to win. That is why we are supporting Ukraine. And I thank the United States; I thank all the 
 
 NATO states who are sending assistance to Ukraine, not only the humanitarian assistance, but also the military one.
 
This is exceptionally important that I'm also grateful to the United States and to our allies, for the fact that they are strengthening our security, 
 
 the security of NATO's eastern flank to make sure that it doesn't cross anybody's mind to attack our land.
 
Thanks to the presence of the U.S. Armed Forces, thanks to the presence of --troops, thanks to the wise policy of strengthening - armed forces in 
 
 recent years. We are becoming more and more secure. And we are more and more convinced of our security. And thanks to this, the potential 
 
 aggressors are less and less sure.
 <br>[11:25:00]
 
DUDA: And I believe that this brutal Russian assertiveness will be punished and crushed in Ukraine that Russia will have to leave Ukrainian land with 
 
 shame the land which it is occupying, that Ukraine will win, the defenders of Ukraine will prevail.
 
That this spilled blood, that this horrible sacrifice, which is being paid by the Ukrainian nation will bear fruits of a grand victory, we the poles 
 
 have got an experience of providing assistance one to the other. St. John Paul, the second - the Pope was spoke of solidarity. One and the other is 
 
 solidarity. That is solidarity never went against the other.
 
It is our huge achievement that solidarity, that 10 million strong movement which broke the communism with the support of the Pope and the United 
 
 States of the free world, thanks to which we broke down the Iron Curtain. Precisely this reflects off inter human solidarity is leading my 
 
 compatriots today, to helping their neighbors from Ukraine.
 
Once again, thank you for that. Thank you for opening your homes. And thank you for offering bread to those in need. Thank you that they are here among 
 
 us today. And many of them feel here at home. That's what they are saying. They are grateful to us, for the fact that we welcomed them, although 
 
 millions of them have come, 2 million are still living here with us, and although nobody had expected that we shared like brothers in solidarity.
 
This is the solidarity of the world today, solidarity with Ukraine. And I'm calling on all the leaders of the European States of the North Atlantic 
 
 Alliance, to stand in solidarity with Ukraine, to support Ukraine all the time, to provide Ukraine with military support, so that the defenders of 
 
 Ukraine have weapons to fight with do not hesitate to not be afraid.
 
There is no place for business as usual with Russia anymore where blood is being shed. Honest people do not do business; it has to be stopped there at 
 
 all costs. Today, this can be stopped only by modern armaments, because this is what your brand needs.
 
Thank you to President Joe Biden for his exceptional courage for his determination. Thank you to the American nation. Thank you to the 
 
 authorities of the United States. Thank you to the American Congress, for all the donations for Ukraine, for the great support offered to Ukraine for 
 
 the fact that thanks to this huge military assistance of the United States, Ukraine is fighting.
 
And others are also providing support, because this is the role of NATO to defend the free world to support the free world. We stand in solidarity 
 
 with Ukraine and we will stand in solidarity with Ukraine, there is no freedom without solidarity. Long live free Ukraine, long live the alliance 
 
 of the Republic of Poland with the United States, long live NATO, long live free world, long live Poland, there is no freedom without solidarity.
 
ANDERSON: There is no freedom without solidarity, President Duda speaking in Warsaw, in Poland ahead of an upcoming speech, from the same stage to be 
 
 delivered by the U.S. President, Joe Biden just moments from now. Before we get to that, let's just take a deep dive on what we've just heard.
 
CNN National Security Analyst Steve Hall, who was formerly the Chief of Russia Operations for the CIA joining us. Today you heard there from the 
 
 Polish president, what do you make of what he said?
 
STEVE HALL, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Well, Becky I think Duda is hitting on all the important points that need to be referred to again and 
 
 again and again, in terms of, you know, this being essentially as he referred to it, not the west, but you know, free countries, so you know, 
 
 those freedom loving countries.
 
The other interesting reference he made is, you know, he uses the word of solidarity a number of times. In this case of course solidarity American 
 
 polish and NATO solidarity with Ukraine.
 <br>[11:30:00]
 
HALL: Of course, in Poland, solidarity has a very special meaning reflecting back on its own struggles, you know, with communism, which is 
 
 actually what, what sort of Russia is standing in for now. So, you know, due to getting setting the stage, I think, for President Biden to come in 
 
 and add his comments.
 
ANDERSON: Yes, and let's, let's just talk about what we might expect from Biden. And indeed, what we heard from President Vladimir Putin earlier on, 
 
 we are told Joe Biden speech is not designed to counter anything we heard from Moscow earlier. In a week that marks a year on from the start of this 
 
 war in Ukraine, what did you take away from what Vladimir Putin had to say today?
 
HALL: Yes, it was very interesting reviewing, reviewing his comments, and especially the print comments now that they've come up to take a look at 
 
 them. They struck me as his goons comment struck me as desperate; he doesn't have a whole lot of options. There are portions of his speech; I 
 
 would argue most of it that was targeting the domestic audience.
 
Again, within the standard Putin mythology, we didn't start this, it was the West that somehow started this war, despite the fact that they were, of 
 
 course, the ones who invaded Ukraine. You know the expansion of NATO, all of these very, very common, false threads. But it's part of the mythology 
 
 that Putin has to put out there for his own people.
 
The thing that I think it's caught the eye of many in the West here is Putin suspension of the START treaty. So that in and of itself was sort of 
 
 a half measure, because of course, the Russians had been violating that treaty, and there had been no arms visits or inspections on either side for 
 
 a number of years.
 
And still, he didn't say we're withdrawing, we're just suspending it. He said Russia reserves the right to do its own nuclear testing, but only if 
 
 the United States nuclear tests first. So he really doesn't have a whole lot to work with. And I think that that came out over the course of a 90 
 
 minute speech.
 
ANDERSON: He may be as you describe it, weaving his mythology, what is not myth is the destructive nature of this war a year in and the potential for 
 
 escalation. I mean, where are we at this point?
 
HALL: Well, that's absolutely true. There is no mythology on the battlefield. But it's interesting that Putin chose not to address the 
 
 military situation in any great depth during his speech, because of course; there is no good story to tell there for Russia, for the Russian people. 
 
 There is no good mythology there.
 
So I think that's why you didn't see a whole lot of comment from him on the military side of things. What you did see an attempt at though, and I think 
 
 what you're alluding to Becky is, you know, do we, have we increased the threat between Russia and the rest of the world?
 
Is there going to be sort of some sort of world war three or some sort of conflict when a nuclear conflagration of some sort? Again, we saw a lot of 
 
 half measures; Putin is trying to continue to rattle that nuclear saber, because he knows that gets our attention here in the West that gets our 
 
 attention in the United States and other NATO countries.
 
But again, all he could come up with was is, you know, we reserve the right to withdraw from these treaties, we reserve the right to do things, if the 
 
 West acts first, so not very strong. I don't think anything that Putin said increases really are significantly changes what's going on right now on the 
 
 battlefield in Ukraine and geopolitically as well.
 
ANDERSON: Let's just have a listen to some of what President Biden has had to say, sorry; President Putin had to say earlier.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT: The longer range western systems will come to Ukraine, but further, we will be forced to move the threat away 
 
 from our borders.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: By which he means what?
 
HALL: Well, that's an excellent question. You know, it sounds like what he's saying is, is it that there's bigger weapons that are going to come 
 
 into Ukraine, that's going to force Russia to somehow take further action and push back further into Ukraine. Of course, that is precisely what the 
 
 Russian military has been unable to do from the very start.
 
So again, it might sound good to a Russian listening to this, you know, in Moscow or other parts of the Russian Federation. But it just doesn't make a 
 
 whole lot of sense for people who have seen the actual, you know, facts on the ground, and that is that the Russian military continues to struggle 
 
 against, you know, a much smaller Ukrainian force.
 
ANDERSON: Before I let you go, just briefly, you alluded to President Duda's speech sort of setting Poland sort of in context here. I just wonder 
 
 what you make of Poland's new role at the heart of European politics and Western diplomacy.
 <br>[11:35:00]
 
HALL: You know, for a long time, Warsaw in Poland has sought to become sort of the new center of Europe and I mean that both economically, as well as 
 
 geopolitically. And they have had some significant success over the past 10, 15 years, both economically, you know, and integrating them, you know, 
 
 more with the rest of the European infrastructure.
 
That said, like Hungary, there are, of course, challenges. Well, indeed, like, like many countries throughout the world, not just those in Eastern 
 
 Europe, there are challenges internal to Poland, political challenges, in terms of, you know, how far is democracy going to go?
 
Are there threats from the right and autocracy that could somehow overtake the democratic movements that have produced a free Poland today? So that's 
 
 going to continue to be a complicated situation. But all of that is really offset by the amazing unity among the Western European nations and the NATO 
 
 partners in this, you know, invasion of Ukraine on the part of Russia, the unanimity amongst the West has been pretty amazing.
 
ANDERSON: And which begs the question, can it continue, and you've been around long enough to know, there's one thing, you know, to get through a 
 
 year, and these economies are hurting. And perhaps not so much as they were given the reduction in the price of gas and oil, but they're hurting at 
 
 this point.
 
And let's be quite clear around the world and in the part of the region where I am broadcasting from, there's a very neutral position towards what 
 
 is going on, how long do you expect to see the sort of support that we have seen garnered for Ukraine continue? Let's be quite frank here.
 
HALL: Sure. Well, quite honestly, and quite frankly, I'm surprised that a year in, we continue to see an increase in the unanimity and increase in 
 
 the spending, despite, as you quite correctly allude to the difficulties, not so much here in the United States, although, you know, there's it's a 
 
 lot of money that's being spent, and it's caught the attention of the American Congress.
 
But nevertheless, there are economies in Western Europe which of course, for, for example, the German economy, among others, that are at significant 
 
 risk. And it nevertheless, again, this is the unanimity not only continues, but it continues to grow. We have yet to hear a whole lot of, you know, a 
 
 whole lot of problems.
 
There's some technical difficulties, who's going to send tanks first, how long is it going to take but nobody has said, well, I'm not sure that this 
 
 is, you know, a really good idea that we're pushing back against the Russians. And maybe they were right in invading Ukraine; it's been quite 
 
 the opposite.
 
ANDERSON: We've got 90 seconds, as far as I can tell, before we hear from Joe Biden. So this is the final question to you, again, picking up on 
 
 something you just said. The spend - the U.S. spend, has caught the attention of the U.S. congress, we will be heading towards sort of the 
 
 election of 2024 sue; we have a split house or a split congress, a divided congress at this point. So how long do you believe that President Biden can 
 
 hold this bipartisan support together?
 
HALL: Again, I'm surprised that it's going as well as it is, especially given the much divided nature, the polarized nature of the U.S. political 
 
 system right now. You know, there are certainly people on both sides are some very left progressives, and some very far right, Republicans who are 
 
 saying, well, we can't write blank checks.
 
But in large part, the congress is in agreement that we need to continue to do this. And perhaps more importantly, the U.S. population in general, when 
 
 polled is very continues to be very supportive. So I don't see any weakening of it yet. It's something that we have to keep our eye on, 
 
 because that's what Vladimir Putin is counting on that we're going to, you know, lose focus and lose track and get bored, perhaps, but as of right 
 
 now, that's not what's happening.
 
ANDERSON: Well, the optics is certainly very good for President Biden, the surprise visit historic to Kyiv yesterday, has been received extremely well 
 
 there and in the West. I just wonder finally, as we get set to hear from the U.S. president in Warsaw, in Poland, do you expect this to be a speech 
 
 from a U.S. president pitched on a global stage or is this as much a pitch to his domestic audience, do you think? How do you expect to see this play 
 
 out?
 
HALL: I don't think those things you mentioned--
 
ANDERSON: Before you answer that question, I'm going to stop you there sir because this is the U.S. President.
 
(MUSIC)
 <br>[11:40:00]
 
JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: Hello, Poland.
 
(CHEERING)
 
One of our great allies. President Duda, Prime Minister -- Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. Mayor; to all the former ministers and presidents as well as 
 
 mayors and Polish political leaders from all across the country, thank you for welcoming me back to Poland.
 
You know it was nearly one year ago --
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
Nearly one year ago I spoke at the royal castle here in Warsaw, just weeks after Vladimir Putin had unleashed his murderous assault on Ukraine. The 
 
 largest land war in Europe since World War II had begun and the principals that had been the corner stone of peace, prosperity and stability on this 
 
 planet for more than 75 years were at risk of being shattered.
 
One year ago the world was bracing for the fall of Kyiv. Well, I've just come from a visit to Kyiv and I can report Kyiv stands strong.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
Kyiv stands proud. It stands tall. And most important it stands free.
 
(CHEERING)
 
When Russia invaded it wasn't just Ukraine being tested, the whole world faced a test for the ages. Europe was being tested, America was being 
 
 tested, NATO is being tested, all democracies are being tested and the questions we face are as simple as they were profound. Would we respond or 
 
 would we look the other way.
 
Would we be strong or would we be weak. Would we -- would (ph) all of our allies would be united or divided. One year later we know the answer. We 
 
 did respond, we would be strong, we would be united and the world would not look the other way.
 
(CHEERING)
 
We also faced fundamental questions about the commitment to the most basic of principals. Would we stand up for the sovereign of nations? Would we 
 
 stand up for the right of people to live free from naked aggression? Would we stand up for democracy?
 
One year later we know the answers. Yes, we would stand up for sovereignty and we did. Yes, we would stand up for the right of people to live free 
 
 from aggression and we did. And we will stand up for democracy and we did.
 
And yesterday I had the honor to stand with President Zelensky in Kyiv to declare that we will keep standing up for these same things, no matter 
 
 what.
 
(CHEERING)
 
When President Putin ordered his tanks to roll into Ukraine, he thought we would roll over. He was wrong. The Ukrainian people are too brave. America, 
 
 Europe, a coalition of nations, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, we were too unified. Democracy was too strong. Instead of an easy victory he 
 
 perceived and predicted, Putin left with burnout tanks and Russia's forces in disarray.
 
He thought he get defendalization (ph) of NATO. Instead, he got the NATOization (ph) of Finland and Sweden.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
He thought NATO would fracture and divide. Instead, NATO is more united and more unified than ever, than ever before. He thought he could weaponize 
 
 energy to crack your resolve, Europe's resolve. Instead, we're working together to end Europe's dependence on Russian fossil fuels.
 
He thought autocrats like himself were tough and leaders of democracy were soft. And then he met the iron will of America and the nations everywhere 
 
 that refused to accept the world governed by fear and force.
 
He found himself at war with a nation led by a man whose courage would be forged in fire and steel, President Zelenskyy.
 
President Putin -
 
(APPLAUSE)
 <br>[11:45:00]
 
President Putin is confronted with something today that he didn't think was possible a year ago. The democracy of the world have grown stronger, not 
 
 weaker. But the autocrats of the world have grown weaker, not stronger, because in the moments of great upheaval and uncertainty, that knowing what 
 
 you stand for is most important. And knowing who stands with you makes all the difference.
 
The people of Poland know that. You know that. In fact, you know - you know it better than anyone here in Poland, because that's what solidarity means, 
 
 through partition and oppression when the beautiful city was destroyed after the Warsaw uprising during decades under the iron fist of communist 
 
 rule, Poland endured because you stood together. That's how brave leaders of the opposition and the people of Belarus continue to fight for their 
 
 democracy. That's how the resolve of Moldovan people -
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
resolve of the people of Moldova to live in freedom, when gained their (ph) independence and put them on the path to E.U. membership. President Sandu 
 
 is here today. I'm not sure she is, but I'm proud to stand with you and the freedom-loving people of Moldova.
 
Give her a hand, round of applause.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
One year on - one year into this war, Putin no longer doubts the strength of our coalition, but he still doubts our conviction. He doubts our staying 
 
 power. He doubts our continued support for Ukraine. He doubts whether NATO can remain unified. But there should be no doubt. Our support for Ukraine 
 
 will not waver. NATO will not be divided and we will not tire.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
President Putin's crave and lust for land and power will fail. And the Ukrainian people's love for their country will prevail. Democracy, the 
 
 world will stand guard over freedom, today, tomorrow and forever.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
For that's what it' - that's what's at stake here, freedom. That's the message I carried to Kyiv yesterday, directly to the people of Ukraine. 
 
 When President Zelenskyy said, he came to the United States in December, quote, he said, "The struggle will define the world and what our children 
 
 and grandchildren how they live and then their children and grandchildren." He wasn't only speaking about the children and grandchildren of Ukraine. He 
 
 was speaking about all of our children and grandchildren, yours and mine.
 
And we're seeing again today what the people of Poland and the people across Europe saw for decades. Appetites of the autocrat cannot be 
 
 appeased, they must be opposed. Autocrats only and understand one word, no, no, no.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
No, you will not take my country. No, you will not take my freedom. No, you will not take my future. And I'll repeat tonight what I said last year in 
 
 this same place, a dictator been (ph) not (ph) rebuilding an empire will never be able to ease the people's love of liberty. Brutality will never 
 
 grind down the will of the free. And Ukraine - Ukraine will never be a victory for Russia. Never.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
For free people refuse to live in a world of hopelessness and darkness. You know, this has been an extraordinary year in every sense. Extraordinary 
 
 brutality from Russian forces and mercenaries. They've committed depravities, crimes against humanity without shame or compunction. They've 
 
 targeted civilians with death and destruction. Used rape as a weapon of war. Stolen Ukrainian children in an attempt to - in an attempt to steal 
 
 Ukraine's future.
 
Bombed train stations, maternity hospital, schools and orphans. No one - no one can turn away their eyes from the atrocities Russia's committing 
 
 against the Ukrainian people. It's abhorrent, it's abhorrent. But extraordinary, as well, has been the response of the Ukrainian people and 
 
 the world.
 
One year after the bombs began to fall, Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine. Ukraine is still independent and free.
 <br>[11:50:00]
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
From Kherson to Kharkiv, Ukrainian fighters have reclaimed their land. More than 50 percent of the territory Russia held last year, the blue and the 
 
 yellow flag of Ukraine proudly waves once again. President Zelenskyy still leads the Democratic-elected government that represents the will of the 
 
 Ukrainian people. And the world has already voted multiple times, including the United Nations General Assembly, to condemn Russian's aggression and 
 
 support a just peace. Each time in the U.N. that vote has been overwhelming. In October, 143 nations in the United Nations condemned 
 
 Russia's illegal annexation. Only four - four in the entire U.N. voted with Russia. Four.
 
So tonight, I speak once more to the people of Russia. The United States and the nations of Europe do not seek to control or destroy Russia. The 
 
 West was not plotting to attack Russia, as Putin said today. And millions of Russian citizens will only want to live in peace with their neighbors 
 
 are not the enemy. This war was never a necessity, it's a tragedy.
 
President Putin chose this war. Every day the war continues is his choice. He could end the war with a word. It's simple. If Russia stopped invading 
 
 Ukraine it would end the war. If Ukraine stopped defending itself against Russia it would be the end of Ukraine.
 
That's why together we're making sure Ukraine can defend itself. The United States has assembled a worldwide coalition of more than 50 nations to get 
 
 critical weapons and supplies to the brave Ukrainian fighters in the front lines.
 
Air defense systems, artillery, ammunition, tanks, armored vehicles. The European Union and its member states have stepped up with unprecedented 
 
 commitment to Ukraine. Not just in security assistance but economic and humanitarian refugee assistance and so much more.
 
To all of you here tonight, take a moment and I'm serious when I say this, turn around and look -- turn around and look at one another. Look at what 
 
 you've done so far. Poland is hosting more than 1.5 million refugees from this war. God bless you.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
Poland's generosity, your willingness to open your hearts and your homes is extraordinary and the American people are united in our resolve as well. 
 
 All across my country in big cities and small towns, Ukrainian flags fly from American homes. Over the past year, Democrats and Republicans in our 
 
 United States Congress have come together to stand for freedom. That's who Americans are and that's what Americans do.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
The world was also coming together to address the global fallout from President Putin's war. Putin tried to starve the world, blocking the ports 
 
 in the Black Sea to stop Ukraine from exporting it's grain, exacerbating the global food crisis that hit developing nations in Africa especially 
 
 hard.
 
Instead, the United States and the G7 and partners around the world answer the call with historic commitments to address the crisis and to bolster 
 
 global food supplies. And this week, my wife, Jill Biden, is traveling to Africa to help bring attention to this critical issue.
 
Our commitment is to the people of Ukraine and the future of Ukraine. A Ukraine that's free, sovereign and democratic. Thousands dream of those who 
 
 declared Ukraine's independence more than 30 years ago.
 
Who led the orange revolution and the revolution of dignity, who braved ice and fire in the Maidan and the heavenly hunter who died there. Those who 
 
 continue still to root out Kremlin's efforts to corrupt coarse and control. It's a dream for those Ukrainian patriots who fought for years against 
 
 Russia's aggressions in the Donbas.
 
And the heroes who've given everything, given their lives in the service of the beloved Ukraine. It was an honor to visit the memorial in Kyiv 
 
 yesterday to pay tribute to the sacrifice of those who've lost their lives, standing alongside President Zelenskyy.
 <br>[11:55:00]
 
The United States and our partners stand with Ukraine's teachers as hospital staff, as emergency responders, the workers and cities across 
 
 Ukraine are fighting to keep the power on in the face of Russia's cruel bombardment.
 
We stand with the millions of refugees of this war who found a welcoming and United States particularly here in Poland. Ordinary people all across 
 
 Europe did whatever they could to help and continue to do so.
 
Polish businesses, civil society, cultural leaders, including the first lady of Poland who is here tonight have led with the heart and 
 
 determination showcasing all that is good about the human spirit. Madam First Lady, we love you. Thank you all.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
I'll never forget last year visiting with refuges from Ukraine who had just arrived in Warsaw, seen their faces; exhausted and afraid, holding their 
 
 children so close, worrying they may never see their fathers, their husbands, their brothers, their sisters again. In that darkest moment of 
 
 their lives; you, the people, Poland offered them safety and light.
 
You embraced them. You literally embraced them. I watched -- I watched the looks on their faces. Meanwhile, together we made sure that Russia's paying 
 
 the price for its abuses. We continue to maintain the largest sanction regime every imposed in any country in history.
 
And we're going to announce more sanctions this week, together with our partners. We'll hold accountable those that are responsible for this war 
 
 and we'll seek justice for the war crimes and crimes against humanity, continuing to be committed by the Russians.
 
You know there is much for us to be proud of over the -- all that we have achieved together this past year. But we have to be honest and clear eyed 
 
 as we look at the year ahead. The defensive freedom is not the work of a day or of a year. It's always difficult, it's always important.
 
As Ukraine continues to defend itself against the Russian onslaught of a launch counter offensive of its own, it will continue to be hard and very 
 
 bitter days. Victories and tragedies. But Ukraine is steel (ph) for the fight ahead. And the United States together with our allies and partners 
 
 are going to continue to have Ukraine's back as it defends itself.
 
Next year I will host every member of NATO for our 2024 summit in the United States. Together we'll celebrate the 75th anniversary of the 
 
 strongest defensive alliance in the history of the world, NATO.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
And let there be no doubt, the commitment of the United States to our NATO alliance and Article 5 is rock solid.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
And every member of NATO knows it. And Russia knows it as well. An attack against one is attack against all. It's a sacred oath.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
Sacred oath to defend every inch of NATO territory. Over the past year, the United States has come together with our allies and partners in an 
 
 extraordinary coalition to stand against Russian aggression. But the work in front of us, it 's not just what we're against, it's about what we're 
 
 for, what kind of world do we want to build?  We need to take the strength and capacity of the coalition and apply it to lifting up -- lifting up the 
 
 lives of people everywhere, improving health, growing prosperity, preserving the planet, building peace and security, treating everyone with 
 
 dignity and respect.
 
That's our responsibility. The democracy of the world we have (ph) to deliver for our people. As we gather tonight, the world in my view, as - at 
 
 an inflection point. The decisions we make over the next 5 years or so going to determine and shape our lives for decades to come. That's true for 
 
 Americans, it's true for the people of the world. And while decisions are ours to make now, the principles and mistakes are eternal. The choice 
 
 between chaos and stability, between building and destroying, between hope and fear, between democracy, lifts up the human spirit, and the brutal hand 
 
 of the dictator who crushes it, between nothing less than limitation and possibilities. The kind of possibilities that come with people who live, no 
 
 in captivity, but in freedom. Freedom. Freedom, there is no sweeter word than freedom.
