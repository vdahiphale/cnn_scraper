MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN ANCHOR: Hello and welcome, everyone. I'm Michael Holmes. Appreciate your company. Coming up here on CNN Newsroom. We are counting down the hours until the Iowa caucuses as Republican presidential candidates wait to see who comes out on top in the first primary test of the election season. 
 
Israel marks more than 100 days since the war with Hamas began and officials are vowing the fighting will continue. And an unofficial U.S. delegation in Taiwan just hours after voters defy China's wishes.
 
In just a matter of hours, Republicans in the U.S. state of Iowa will begin making the first votes in the 2024 presidential race. Voters in the first in the nation caucuses will have to brave some pretty brutal Iowa weather. Snow falling wind chills as low as 45 degrees below zero. 
 
Presidential hopefuls spent Sunday crisscrossing the state looking to drum up last minute support from undecided voters. With the latest polling showing Donald Trump well ahead of his two closest competitors, Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis hoping to win over those voters and willing to commit to Trump. CNN teams have been following the top candidates on the ground in Iowa. Here's some of what they found.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Former President Donald Trump delivered a very lengthy final message to Iowa caucus goers encouraging them to brave the storm to even brave their own health. Part of the big goal of Donald Trump and his team is to get as many people out there to caucus on Monday night as possible. 
 
All of this because they are looking for the widest margin they can possibly win by to set the tone for primary season. Donald Trump was pushing that narrative on Sunday. Here's what he said. DONALD TRUMP, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You must go caucus tomorrow very first step, really the first step we got to do and we got to do it big you got to get out. You can't sit home. If you're sick as a dog, you say Darla, even if you vote and then pass away, it's worth it. Remember, if you're sick if you're just so sick, you catch on, I don't think get up.
 
HOLMES: Now obviously that was somewhat of a joke, but it is very important to Trump to have people turn up. We know that he has been telling people close to him that he is concerned about the weather that he is concerned about turnout. And a lot of this isn't just about getting the biggest amount of delegates. It's also about setting momentum and stopping momentum going into New Hampshire from any of his GOP rivals, particularly when it comes to Nikki Haley. 
 
His team has been watching her very closely. They have seen her poll numbers ticking up they're already spending millions of dollars attacking her in ads in New Hampshire. However, they are hoping that a big win a big showing in Iowa would crush some of that momentum. 
 
The other part of this that Donald Trump has been concerned that because of the fact that he has been leading by so much in the polls, that people will become complacent that they won't show up because they think that Donald Trump already has enough support. 
 
So again, a big part of his message going into the caucuses is show up, no matter what happens. The very most important thing you can do is show up in caucus. Kristen Holmes, CNN, Indianola, Iowa,
 
KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Nikki Haley hitting a number of topics that we have heard her repeat throughout her entire campaign. So on the eve of the Iowa caucuses, saying that there needs to be a school choice in the United States. There needs to be more resources but towards defending the border they need to defend Ukraine in order to prevent war and also notably hitting on the electability argument, saying in a theoretical matchup with her and President Biden, she would commandingly beat him saying that isn't the case for Trump. 
 
That isn't the case for DeSantis and talked about the fact that Republicans in the last seven of last eight presidential elections have lost the popular vote. She is casting herself as the next generational leader who can change that. 
 
Now there was a poll out over the weekend from the Des Moines Register and NBC showing that she has pulled ahead of Ron DeSantis. But of course, Ron DeSantis has put tremendous resources into the state of Iowa and expectations are incredibly high for him. Nikki Haley's team for their part, saying that they hope that she has a strong showing in Iowa but not exactly defining what that would look like. Kylie Atwood, CNN, Adel, Iowa. 
 <br>[01:05:07]
 
JESSICA DEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, wrapping up his final event of on Sunday here in agony Iowa making his pitch to caucus goers they just need to show up on Monday. And if they bring a family member or a friend or a neighbor, all the better, he's been making the case that if there's lower turnout on Monday, that their vote could be even more impactful. 
 
And he and his campaign are hoping that the organization they built here on the ground, along with the super PAC that's aligned with him some over 900,000 doors knocked that that's going to hold them really do well for them tomorrow really fold them over the line for a strong finish in here in Iowa. 
 
It is a state that he is invested a lot in, probably more than any other candidate in his primary. And he really needs at the very least a strong second place to then propel him through the next part of the primary. They're certainly hoping that that organization is going to help him get there as caucus goers finally go to caucus to the caucus sites on Monday and the voting starts in this presidential primary. Jessica Dean, CNN, Ankeny, Iowa.

HOLMES: And do stay with CNN in the coming hours for our ongoing coverage of the run up to the results of the Iowa caucuses and the results of the first contest of the 2024 presidential election season. 
 
Now the U.S. says its relations with Taiwan are quote rock solid as China issued a stern warning after Taiwan held significant elections on Saturday and unofficial U.S. delegation is in Taiwan showing unity after the islands ruling party secured and historic third consecutive presidential term. 
 
Responding to the victory, China says any efforts to further Taiwanese independence will be severely punished. CNN's Steven Jiang joins me now from Beijing. But let's start with CNN's Kristie Lu Stout in Hong Kong. So Kristie, on the back of lies victory, this delegation in Taiwan, tell us about the aim of the visit. Could there be any fallout from it? 
 
KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Now, Michael, there's unofficial U.S. allegation is in Taiwan after that historic election victory by Lai Ching-te, candidate openly loathed by Beijing. And this is a move that could raise tensions, it could complicate efforts to stabilize U.S.-China relations and want to show you this video of the delegations meeting took place this morning with President-elect Lai along with his running mate, and this unofficial delegation arrived on Sunday for some three days of meetings. 
 
Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs also released photographs. Let's bring up the photos for you, showing an official welcoming the group which includes the former Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg, as well as the former national security adviser Stephen Hadley.
 
During a meeting that took place earlier today with the presence of Tsai wen, that she congratulated Taiwan on his electoral process said that U.S.-Taiwan ties are rock solid. And I want you to listen to this from the Taiwan President.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TSAI ING-WEN, TAIWAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Your visit is of great significance as not only fully demonstrates the United States support for Taiwan's democracy, but also highlights the close and solid partnership between Taiwan and the United States.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
LU STOUT: Now, China had warned against any official contact and reiterated quote that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China and U.S. officials have said that this visit is in line with a long standing practice of sending over former U.S. officials to Taiwan after elections with the intention to emphasize the relationship between us and Taiwan, as well as America's one China policy, which recognizes Beijing.
 
Now on Saturday, that was when Taiwan's ruling party, the DPP pulled off that historic consecutive third presidential victory. And Lai Cheng-te says he would maintain the status quo. He would pursue peace through strength that he is open to engagement with Beijing, but China has denounced him openly and it appears, Michael, that Beijing is already exerting fresh diplomatic pressure, according to Reuters Naru has cut diplomatic ties with Taiwan, switching recognition to Beijing. And that would mean that Taiwan has only 12 remaining diplomatic allies. Back to you.
 
HOLMES: All right. Steven Jiang, let's turn to you in Beijing. It was interesting to see the Chinese foreign minister. He was in Cairo but still managed to speak about this talk about that and the options that leadership has beyond verbal warnings.
 
STEVEN JIANG, BEIJING BUREAU CHIEF: Yes, Michael, Wang Yi was in Cairo on a previously scheduled trip but without missing a beat. He actually highlighted the location and its importance in reinforced China's claim over Taiwan by referring to the 1943 Cairo Conference, which of course was about a post-World War II order and Wang Yi set that declaration from that conference actually showed Taiwan being part of China has been a decade's long global consensus.
 <br>[01:10:04]
 
Now the Cairo declaration itself, of course is open to interpretations and not without controversy about Wang Yi's harsh words and the stern warnings again Taiwan independence, of course, in contrast to what's happening on the ground, as Kristie was saying that Taiwanese populations growing separate identity and their rejection of Beijing's repeated and growing threats ahead of the election by electing Lai. 
 
But I think even though there has been this perceived added urgency and growing emphasis of quote unquote, Taiwan reunification under Chinese leader Xi Jinping, we may not see a lot of drastic actions just yet because of both practical constraints and political considerations, that right now, the weather is not the best in the Taiwan Strait. So it may not be ideal to stage massive military droves. 
 
And also, Beijing may not want to give Lai Cheng-te more ammunition even before he formally takes office by doing things Lai Cheng-te has been warning its population about and so they may want to wait until his inauguration speech in May before make a decision. 
 
And also remember, Xi Jinping has been investing a lot of his credibility in recent months by tamping down tensions with the West, especially with the United States in a crucial election year as the presidential campaign season kicks off in earnest. 
 
So because of that, we might not see a lot of things happening just yet. But as Kristie was saying, there are options Beijing can choose from economic coercion, military jobs, as well as, as flipping under Taiwan's formal diplomatic allies. And so Beijing definitely wants to do something to quote unquote, punish what they perceive as a troublemaker, and the diehard separatist not as Lai Cheng-te. Michael.
 
HOLMES: All right, Kristie Lu Stout in Hong Kong, Steven Jiang in Beijing. Our thanks to you both. 
 
Now, Israel marking a grim milestone 100 days since the war with Hamas began and Israeli officials have vowed the fighting will continue until Hamas is defeated.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): What are the things that has become clear beyond any doubt is that we must conduct this work, and it will take many more months.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HOLMES: The fighting has been intense since the first Hamas attacks on October 7 where Israel says about 1,200 people died. Gaza's health ministry, which is controlled by Hamas says meanwhile, nearly 24,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel's military offensive. 
 
Crowds gathered in Tel Aviv on Sunday for what's been called 100 Days of Hell Rally held in what is now known as Hostages Plaza. Those in attendance observing 100 seconds of silence in honor of the more than 100 Israeli hostages still held captive in Gaza.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is my big brother. He's given up by Hamas is held hostage from the seventh of October 100 days. We hope we come back. We wish he came back every day, every night, every time, every hour, every minute that best is harder.
 
HOLMES: CNN's Jeremy Diamond now with more from Tel Aviv.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT: Well, 100 days after the October 7 terrorist attacks that sparked this Israel-Hamas war, Israel is facing mounting international pressure as the death toll in Gaza reaches nearly 24,000 people killed the majority of those women and children. But amid that international pressure the Israeli prime minister is
 
 defined for his part. He says nobody will stop us from continuing to carry out this war from destroying Hamas and securing the release of those more than 100 hostages still held hostage in the Gaza Strip. 
 
The Israeli Prime Minister promising total victory and warning that this war will take many more months. But it's clear amid those defined comments that there are still concerns that this war between Israel and Hamas could erupt into a broader regional war. That's as we look to the south in Yemen. 
 
Houthi rebels there are vowing to continue their attacks on that critical shipping lane in the Red Sea following strikes by the United States and the United Kingdom aimed directly at Houthi capabilities in Yemen. 
 
If you look to the north at the Israel-Lebanese border, there are continuing cross border clashes between the Israeli military and Hezbollah and anti-tank missile fired by Hezbollah hitting a residential home in northern Israel killing a 76-year-old woman and her 40-year-old son.
 
The Israeli military, meanwhile, firing strikes in southern Lebanon at Hezbollah targets. Hassan Nasrallah, the head of Hezbollah says that only a ceasefire in Gaza could see the end of those cross border clashes. 
 
Meanwhile, in Israel as we hit this 100 day mark, many people across the country are marking 100 day of captivity for those more than 100 hostages who still remain in captivity held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
 <br>[01:15:09]
 
Tens of thousands of people flocking to what's become known as Hostages Plaza in Tel Aviv, where a 24-hour rally was held to mark those 100 days of captivity. Messages recorded by leaders across the world flowing in during that ceremony. 
 
And as people mark those 100 days of captivity, we're now learning that negotiators have struck a deal to allow for the entry of medication to the Gaza Strip for some of those 40 hostages who are being held hostage who the Israeli government believes are in need of medication. That medicine will be coming from Qatar delivered to Egyptian officials and then to members of the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza. 
 
But many of the families of those hostages say that they're skeptical that that medication will actually reach those hostages, especially because it's not being delivered by the Red Cross. They say they want to see video proof that that medication is actually reaching those who desperately need it. Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Tel Aviv.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HOLMES: The Palestine Red Crescent Society says it has now resumed ambulance and emergency services in Gaza after a nearly two-month pause. The organization says it was forced to halt its operations after its ambulance center and the Al Quds Hospital were under, quote, siege by Israeli forces. 
 
The PRCS now says it has enhanced its ambulance services in northern Gaza, much needed. But Gaza is suffering meanwhile, from catastrophic conditions that new ambulances won't be able to improve. And a panel of U.N. affiliated experts warns now that the Enclave is on the brink of famine. 
 
Earlier I asked Alex De Waal, the executive director of the World Peace Foundation at Tufts University, what that means.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ALEX DE WAAL, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, WORLD PEACE FOUNDATION, TUFTS UNIVERSITY: Children are already dying of hunger, disease and the cold in Gaza. And we could very read very soon within weeks visiting a situation of widespread mass starvation. 
 
HOLMES: And with that evidence of malnutrition if actual famine begins, and there's a criteria for that a technical one, what international laws are there to protect people and what's the likelihood they be in fourth, especially given the stance taken by some Western conflicts on this conflict -- Western countries?
 
DE WAAL: The Declaration of Famine has no legal standing as such, it's really a moral alarm bell. But a number of international jurists have been warning that Israel is actually committing the war crime of starvation, by the technical term is destroying objects indispensable for the survival of the civilian population, and imposing a siege blocking humanitarian aid in violation of the Geneva Conventions. And those are war crimes, those that there is a very serious international right.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HOLMES: And de Waal in 40 years of researching famine, he's never seen a situation like this unfold with such speed. The famine review committee's report says an end to hostilities and the restoration of humanitarian space to deliver assistance is essential to eliminating that risk of famine that very real risk. 
 
China's Foreign Minister is calling for an end to the quote harassment of civilian ships in the Red Sea, but he does not directly mention the Houthi rebels in Yemen, who are carrying out those attacks. He is also indirectly criticizing the U.S. and U.K. for responding to the attacks and striking Houthi targets, saying that action was not approved by the United Nations Security Council. 
 
On Wednesday, the UNSC approved a resolution calling on the Houthi rebel group to cease its attacks in the Red Sea. The Houthi say they are targeting Israeli ships, but ships with no apparent links to Israel have also been affected. 
 
The British foreign secretary says the U.K. gave the Houthis quote warning after warning before it carried out its airstrikes. Yet the attacks on commercial vessels continued.
 
Lava surging into a seaside town in Iceland. Coming, up how the people living in the community are reacting to the damage. This new eruption is causing. 
 
Also, two cups of boiling water and two pieces of disgusting bread. Jailed Putin critic Alexey Navalny describing the conditions at the Siberian penal colony where he's being held. We'll have that much more when we come back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[01:21:58]
 
HOLMES: All right, better late than never. It is after midnight in Guatemala, where the new president is just now being sworn in. The inauguration ceremony for incoming president Bernardo Arevalo was delayed Sunday after a long debate in the opposition controlled Congress whose new members needed to be sworn in before the President. You're live pictures coming from the ceremony and the marking of this inauguration in Guatemala City. 
 
You can see the wearing in ceremony happening there now and some happiness that it's finally happened after this delay. The holdup actually sparked protests outside of Congress as supporters of Arevalo was seen scuffling with police. Several world leaders and delegates who traveled to Guatemala for the inauguration also voiced their support for Arevalo and called on Congress to move forward with the ceremony which it now has as we saw just there. 
 
Lava from a southwestern Icelandic volcano is flowing into a nearby fishing town. The country's Meteorological Office says lava is pouring into the town from a new fissure in a nearby volcano caused by the second eruption this area has seen in weeks. The town now under evacuation orders, many of the residents who left after last month or eruption, though have not even returned.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JON GAUTI DAGBJARTSSON, EVACUATED GRINDAVIK RESIDENT: It's tough in many ways. But I am optimistic by nature. And I tried to maintain optimistic but, you know, this is big, this is serious is basically as bad as can possibly get. Although it might get even worse. Who knows? 
 
So, I mean, I'm born in this town. I actually live in the house that I'm born in. And it's kind of -- it's a tough -- it's a tough thought to think that this town might be over. And I would have to start all over somewhere else. But if that's the case, then that's exactly what we'll do.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HOLMES: A spokesperson for Iceland's Civil Protection Agency says a lava presents quote, no danger to human life. You can see it they're burning a structure. Incredible pictures. Let's turn now to Indonesia, where one of that country's most active
 
 volcanoes has erupted for the second time in weeks. Mount Marapi began erupting on Sunday morning, the country's geological agency warning residents and visitors to stay about three miles away from the crater and told those nearby to wear masks to protect themselves from falling ash. 
 
Nearby homes and evacuation temps were already covered in volcanic ash and eruption in early December killed 23 people hiking the mountain at the time. 
 
North Korea claiming it successfully tested a ballistic missile on Sunday. According to state media the country launched a solid fuel intermediate range missile equipped with a hypersonic maneuvering combat unit.
 <br>[01:25:02]
 
South Korea and Japan say the missile flew about 1,000 kilometers before falling into the waters off the eastern Korean peninsula. Seoul says the launch was a clear provocation that quote seriously threatens the peace and security of the Korean peninsula. 
 
North Korea meanwhile sending its top diplomat to Russia that's according to the Foreign Ministry in Moscow. Sergey Lavrov says North Korean foreign minister Choe Son Hui will arrive in Russia today for a two day visit. Russian state media reporting the two diplomats will be holding quote negotiations, although it's not clear on what topics. The visit comes as the White House is accusing Russia of using North Korean weapons and its war on Ukraine. 
 
It seems prison life won't be getting any easier for Alexey Navalny, after the Russian Supreme Court rejected his claims against the justice ministry late last week, that's according to his spokesperson. The jailed Gremlin critic was fighting for greater access to religious material in the Siberian penal colony, where he's being held. He's also described the harsh freezing conditions there. CNN's Matthew Chance gives us an inside look inside the facility known as the Polar Wolf.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Seems gaunt, but in good spirits. Alexey Navalny even cracking jokes and a smile and these first public appearances by the Russian opposition leader since arriving at this Arctic penal colony, where temperatures have plunged.
 
ALEXEY NAVALNY, RUSSIAN OPPOSITION LEADER (through translator): The reality of prison is that it is a very cold place. Do you know why they take newspapers there to cover up because I'm reporting to the court here. It's much warmer to sleep with a newspaper for example, than without it. And you just need this newspaper to stay warm.
 
CHANCE (voice-over): It's as if the Kremlin is doing everything to make Navalny sentence last year extended to more than 30 years as miserable as possible conditions at the remote Polar Wolf colony where he was secretly transferred last month, his family losing contact with him for over two weeks, and notoriously tough, with dark freezing winters. 
 
In 2021, state controlled Russian television was granted access to the colony where long term inmates including some of Russia's most notorious criminals, work in Spartan conditions. Navalny supporters concerned for his welfare, say it's far harder now to monitor his condition.
 
KIRA YARMYSH, ALEXEY NAVALNYS SPOKESPERSON: Is in the north. So it is very cold there. And even today, the light there is for two hours per day. So I mean, the conditions like the environment conditions there are much worse than they were before in Vladimir region that is close to Moscow. Now, so from this point of view, they did want to try to isolate Alexey, and to make it more difficult to access him there.
 
CHANCE: But his previous treatment Navalny says was harsh to. The opposition figure his head shaven telling the judge his 10-minute meal breaks were simply too short in which to eat.
 
NAVALNY (through translator): I get two mugs of boiling water and two pieces of disgusting bread. And I wanted to drink this boiling water normally and eat this bread normally, but in 10 minutes, I must choke on this boiling water and this is done solely to prevent a person from eating normally. 
 
CHANCE: But inevitably, Navalny's complaints against the Russian prison authorities were dismissed by the court, but one of the Kremlin's fiercest critics. That seems a little bit hardship ahead. Matthew Chance, CNN, London.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HOLMES: Still to come on the program, the rich getting richer, the poor poorer. That's the finding of one group, which says billionaires and corporations are to blame for why the wage gap is so wide. We'll break down that report when we come back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[01:31:38]
 
HOLMES: And welcome back to our viewers all around the world. I'm Michael Holmes. You're watching CNN NEWSROOM.
 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he is preparing for the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland this week where world leaders are gathering to discuss the globe's most pressing problems. He says he's preparing to present Ukraine's position as well as joint opportunities for those who strive towards a quote, "world of stability and freedom for their children". He is expected to address the forum in Davos in person. 
 
CNN's Richard Quest spoke with the founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, Klaus Schwab, as hundreds are gathering in Davos for the annual event. 
 
Among other things, Schwab talked about the biggest risk that the world is facing right now. Here's part of that conversation. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KLAUS SCHWAB, FOUNDER, WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM: It's time where you want to meet, where you want to figure out what's really going on and Davos of course, bringing together our 50 heads of states, 300 ministers, 1,500 business leaders all the other representatives of civil society like young people and so on. 
 
It creates a kind of pot which is boiling and you may get some better knowledge about what's going on.
 
RICHARD QUEST, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: What's the biggest risk that we face? 
 
SCHWAB: I think the biggest risk we face is that we lose hope and that we lose trust. Trust into our institutions and particularly trust in our capability to shape a better future. We have become too much pessimists. 
 
Look human kind was driven towards a paradigm, the narrative to take care for the next generations, to take care of the labels (ph) and we have lost his capability to a certain extent.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HOLMES: Now, Oxfam is quick to point out that some of the same billionaires attending Davos Summit are the ones making global inequality worse. 
 
The group releasing a new report profiling the divide between billionaires and the rest of us. They say in part that since 2020, the richest five men in the world have more than doubled their fortunes, doubled them. 
 
In the same period, almost 5 billion people globally have become poorer. Hardship and hunger are a daily reality for many people worldwide. At current rates, it would take 230 years to end poverty but we could have our first trillionaire in ten years.
 
Nabil Ahmed is the director of economic justice with Oxfam America, joins me now. And good to see you. 
 
There is that old maxim, the rich get rich and the poor get poorer. And your latest report lays out in detail the evidence for the truth of that. How bad is the problem and how much worse is it getting? 
 
NABIL AHMED, DIRECTOR OF ECONOMIC JUSTICE, OXFAM AMERICA: Thank you so much, Michael for having Oxfam. 
 <br>[01:34:48]
 
AHMED: You know, the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer -- that certainly has been the story. And now this is taking forth too frightening new extremes. 
 
Look globally now, we're seeing the makings of a decade of division. Since 2020, not only is billionaire wealth unimaginably up. The world's five richest men, their wealth has doubled since 2022 to now, over eight hundred -- over $800 billion combined. 
 
And at the same time, 60 percent of the world, it's like nearly 5 billion people have been made poorer. Ordinary people across the world are shouldering the shockwaves of inflation, of the climate crisis, of war. Make no mistake, this is not normal and at current rates, Michael, we estimate that we could be seeing the world's first trillionaire -- trillionaire would achieve within a decade from now while it would take over two centuries to end poverty. 
 
HOLMES: Yes, I mean I was reading labor -- former labor secretary Robert Reich. He tweeted this week and I just want to read it because it really is quite stunning. He said, "Jeff Bezos made over $7.9 million an hour last year $7.9 million. In 13 minutes he made the equivalent of what a typical person earns in a lifetime."
 
So who are the worst offenders? The billionaires not paying their share, corporations all about the profit, or nations not sharing the wealth or, you know, who's the worst offender -- individuals, corporations, countries? 
 
AHMED: Michael, it's all of the above put together and actually this question goes to the heart of the story that we absolutely need to tell because we've seen how corporations and monopolies are generating the extreme inequality that we see, but we can be clearer as well to say that we ignore at our peril the role of monopoly power in redistributing wealth to the very top. But also the very visible, not invisible, the very visible hand of the ultra-rich in this shift. And all of this has been enabled by public policy, by government. 
 
Let's see this. We've looked at the world's ten largest corporations, for example, seven of ten of the world's largest firms are either being run by a billionaire or have one as a principal shareholder. So we're in this situation where modern-day monopoly men have cornered markets from tech, to pharmaceuticals, to food. And this undermines ordinary people -- 
 
HOLMES: Yes.
 
AHMED: -- workers, also small businesses. We need to dig deep into how corporations are driving inequality from squeezing workers, dodging taxes, privatizing the state and we can go into that. 
 
It benefits one group above all, to go back to your question and that's the ultrarich at the very top. 
 
HOLMES: Yes. (INAUDIBLE) you -- do you mentioned that ten of the world's biggest corporations I was reading in the report that they have -- they have -- they're worth $10.2 trillion equivalent to the combined GDPs of all the countries in Africa and Latin America, which just blows my mind. I think a question that a lot of people would ask is, if you're worth
 
 billions, tens of billions, hundreds of billions of dollars, why do you want more rather than share a little of that? Or heaven forbid, pay the same tax rates as the rest of us so pay workers more family. You have any sense of why they wouldn't? 
 
AHMED: I wish I knew, but we also know how they've got there, right. And we know the sort of policies are being pushed by cooperations, pushed by the billionaire class, be it driving down taxes the world over, be it undermining workers' rights and workers' wages, be it plundering the planet and privatizing the state. 
 
Look at this. We looked -- with the World Benchmarking Alliance -- we looked at over 1,600 of the world's largest firms just right across countries. 0.4 percent of those over 1,600 corporations are committed to a living wage and supporting a living wage through their value chains. 
 
And what's a result of all of this? $8 of $10 -- $8 of every $10 of profit is going to reach shareholders from the world's largest hundred firms.
 
HOLMES: We're just about out of time, but I do have to ask you, is there anything that gives you hope? Real quick.
 
AHMED: Yes, absolutely. Well, we're saying we need a new era of public action. Regulate, break up monopolies, tax the richest, tax corporations, you know. enshrine living wage in collective bargaining. 
 
And there is hope, there is hope if you look at some of the actions even taken by some governments, for example, anti-monopoly action here in the U.S.. If you look at how African governments have stood up on the global stage to say, actually we need to redesign the global tax system. Look at the Brazilian G20 this year, saying we need an inequality-centered approach. 
 
HOLMES: Right.
 <br>[01:39:50]
 
AHMED: There is hope, but we're going to have to fight it if we're going to get out of this new gilded age that were in.
 
HOLMES: Well, another maxim is money is power. So hopefully you're right. 
 
Nabil Ahmed, thank you so much there with Oxfam, an important report. 
 
AHMED: Thank you so much, Michael, for having us on.

HOLMES: Two imprisoned Iranian journalists have been released on bail according to Iran's state media. Niloofar Hamedi and Elaheh Mohammadi were serving prison sentences over their coverage of the death of Mahsa Amini, the Kurdish-Iranian woman who died while in the custody of Iran's notorious morality police in September of 2022. Her death sparked months' long protests across Iran and indeed around the world.
 
If the court's verdict against the journalists is confirmed, Mohammadi could still face six years in prison and Hamedi seven years.
 
Canada experiencing a surge in anti-Semitism, which has been going on for months. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau even said Canadians are scared to be on their own streets after a recent rise in hate speech.
 
CNNs Paula Newton with more on that.

PAULA NEWTO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: A morning ritual, school drop-off at Yeshiva Gedola, students hustle in and as usual, Rabbi Menachem Karmel is meeting them at the door. 
 
It's a typical morning in Montreal right down to the snow-covered streets except for this -- police watching every move. In November, Montreal police say the school was targeted not once, but twice by gunfire. Students were not there at the time, there were no injuries, but also no arrests so far.
 
To Rabbi Karmel, an American, and the grandson of Holocaust survivors the fact that it could happen here -- 
 
RABBI MENACHEM KARMEL, PRINCIPAL, YESHIVA GEDOLA: It's scary, scary. Made it so shocking to have such an act in such a community. It's like -- it's almost like were in a bubble here. 
 
The fact that as a religious school, very identifiably Jewish, that this becomes the go-to place to protest, to express your anger is so misconstrued. It's hurtful. 
 
NEWTON: And police across Canada say it's far from an isolated incident. Last week, a Jewish-owned deli in Toronto was the target of an arson attack. No one was injured. No arrests have been made but Toronto police call it a tipping point. 
 
PAULINE GRAY, STAFF SUPERINTENDENT, TORONTO POLICE: This is a criminal act. It is violent. It is targeted. It is organized. 
 <br>[01:44:47]
 
NEWTON: Canada's prime minister has admitted there is newfound fear on Canadian streets. 
 
JUSTIN TRUDEAU, CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER: We're seeing right now a rise in anti-Semitism that is terrifying. NEWTON: Canadian authorities say hate-inspired incidents have spiked since the Hamas attack in Israel, punctuated by tense protests across the country. 
 
RABBI SAUL EMMANUEL, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, JEWISH COMMUNITY COUNCIL OF MONTREAL: Before you go to that tipping point, try and bring it back, try and pull it back. 
 
NEWTON: Rabbi Saul Emmanuel voices concerns, not just as a parent with children at the targeted school, but a community leader looking for security and less impunity.
 
EMMANUEL: It's become accepted that you can go off to any Jewish target.
 
NEWTON: That real fear of being targeted simply based on your religion is one shared by many Muslims here as well, who have also reported an increase in hate-inspired incidents. 
 
SAMER MAJZOUB, PRESIDENT, CANADIAN MUSLIM FORUM: Because it's much worse than the 911 -- 
 
NEWTON: Samer Majzoub speaks to us in a Montreal mosque that was recently targeted with hateful graffiti. He says, all the recent hate- inspired acts have frayed nerves in many communities. 
 
MAJZOUB: I don't like to divide our city and our province and our country and you know, we are from that community of this community. When we refuse hate, when you refuse violence, when you refuse intimidation, when it feels it against each and every individual.
 
NEWTON: That so-cherished Canadian hallmark of tolerance has somehow fractured in this Montreal synagogue. They pray for peace in Israel, astounded by how that far away war is affecting their everyday lives.
 
NATAN SCHECHER, MONTRAL RESIDENT: Our day schools, our synagogues have always been kind of, you know, thankful (INAUDIBLE). And then I was getting calls from my friends in Israel saying, you know, are you ok? We hear all the things happening. You're calling me from a warzone asking me if I'm ok. It doesn't make any sense. But it's just the new reality. 
 
NEWTON: A new reality testing the very fabric of Canadian communities in Montreal and beyond.

HOLMES: Authorities in Ecuador have detained more than 1,300 people in an effort to squash an outbreak of gang-based violence. Those arrested include 143 people accused of terrorism according to the president's office. Authorities claimed to have dismantled at least 32 criminal organizations in the past few days. 
 
The crackdown comes after last week's explosion of gang violence, which saw an attack on a local TV station, you see that there. There were also explosions and prison lights (ph) throughout the country.
 
The White House is demanding that Texas give U.S. border patrol agents access to the area along the southern border with Mexico, where three migrants drowned trying to cross the Rio Grande. The Biden administration accuses Texas state officials of blocking federal agents from the area where they were trying to offer help.
 
Rafael Romo explains what happened. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: What we know is that a woman and two children drowned sometime between Friday night and Saturday morning in the Rio Grande in Eagle Pass, Texas. This information originally came from Texas Democratic Congressman Henry Cuellar and later corroborated by other agencies.
 
Cuellar said in a post on social media that the U.S. Border Patrol learned Friday at about 09:00 p.m. that a group of six migrants was in distress. According to the congressman, border patrol officials called the Texas Military Department, the Texas National Guard, and the Texas Department of Public Safety but were unsuccessful in relaying the information by phone. 
 
Cuellar also said that Texas Military Department soldiers stated they would not grant access to the migrants even in the event of an emergency, and that they would send a soldier to investigate the situation. 
 
The bodies of three migrants were recovered hours later by Mexican authorities. The Department of Homeland Security has also confirmed the deaths. 
 
There's a huge controversy at the border because as we have previously reported the U.S. Border Patrol has been blocked out of Shelby Park, an area at the U.S. border with Mexico that had until recently served as a holding area for migrants.
 
Last Wednesday night, Texas authorities erected fencing, gates and razor wire to take that custody and control of the park. That means that border patrol agents who, as part of the regular duties rescue migrants in distress, did not have access to the area where the migrants are believed to have drowned.
 
In a statement, the Texas Military Department said the following. "At no time did TMD security personnel along the river observed any distressed migrants, nor did TMD turn back any illegal immigrants from the U.S. during this period," adding that they were not made aware of any bodies in the area of Shelby Park at that time. 
 
Both Customs and Border Protection and the White House have reacted to the drownings. 
 <br>[01:49:45]
 
ROMO: Earlier on Sunday, a White House spokesperson said the following. "While we continue to gather facts about the circumstances of these tragic deaths, one thing is clear. Governor Abbott's political stunts are cruel, inhumane, and dangerous. U.S. border patrol must have access to the border to enforce our laws."
 
Likewise, Customs and Border Protection said in a statement that "We remain gravely concerned by actions that prevent the U.S. Border Patrol from performing their essential missions of arresting individuals who enter the United States unlawfully and providing humanitarian response to individuals in need. 
 
CNN has also reached to the office of Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who originally ordered the Texas Military Department to take over the park in Eagle Pass, but they have not yet publicly made any comment on what happened.

HOLMES: Sunday marked a bittersweet, yet historic day, in the kingdom of Denmark, where the beloved Queen Margrethe II formally abdicated the throne to her eldest son, the newly-crowned King Frederik X. He and his wife, Queen Mary have proven to be popular in their own right. 
 
Here's a look at the events of the day. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
HOLMES: With the stroke of a pen Queen Margrethe of Denmark ended her reign of more than five decades, voluntarily giving up her position so her son, King Frederik could ascend the throne. Thousands of well- wishers cheered as the new king and his wife, Queen Mary, wave to the crowds who gathered despite the cold weather.
 
KIN FREDERIK X, DENMARK (through translator): Today the throne is passed on. My hope is to become a unifying king of tomorrow.
 
HOLMES: And historic transition, even though there was no crowning ceremony. No monarch in Denmark has abdicated in nearly 900 years. 
 
It was little More than two weeks ago The now former queen set the stunning succession in motion. 
 
QUEEN MARGRETHE II, FORMER QUEEN OF DENMARK (through translator): I will step down as Queen of Denmark. I will hand over the throne to my son, Crown Prince Frederik. 
 
HOLMES: In royal circles, abdication is rare, but not unheard of. In 2019, Emperor Akihito of Japan abdicated in favor of his son. 
 
Five years earlier, King Juan Carlos of Spain also gave up his crown. He said, it was time for a new era. But he was also plagued by a series of scandals.
 
In 2013, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands stepped down following the tradition of her mother and grandmother, who both abdicated later in life. 
 
Until recently, there was no indication Margrethe would follow suit. She said health issues have made her think twice about the future. Perhaps not only for herself, but the country.
 
LARS HOVBAKKE SORENSON, HISTORIAN: She wants maybe to avoid a British situation where Prince Charles became King Charles when he was more than 70 years old. 
 
Frederik is 55 years old.
 
HOLMES: Denmark's new King Frederik X will be roughly the same age as some of his contemporaries. King Felipe of Spain is 55. King Willem- Alexander of the Netherlands is 56. All younger than the long serving monarchs like King Harald of Norway who is 86 years old and King Carl Gustaf of Sweden who's 77.
 <br>[01:54:55]
 
HOLMES: Royal watchers say King Frederik's rain will likely be a more modern one, focused on lifestyle issues, the environment, and social activism.
 
SORENSON: He is much more interested in sport and in modern music while his mother (INAUDIBLE) has had always an interest in classical music and arts, in literature, in (INAUDIBLE). 
 
HOLMES: And the people overwhelmingly support him. According to Reuters, a recent survey says 82 percent of Danes expect the new king to do well or very well in his new role. His Australian-born wife, Mary faring even better at 86 percent.

HOLMES: And we're tracking in arctic blast that is spreading through the U.S. setting the stage for impactful snow and ice in parts of the south for the first time this winter. 
 
And this is what they are bracing for in Portland, Oregon. A fallen trees smashing into a police cruiser during a storm. More than 100,000 people dealing with power outages in the state. 
 
And the power company says another winter storm this week could bring even more high winds and freezing rain. 
 
Today, of course, Iowa preparing for the coldest caucuses on record, but more than 75 percent of the country will experience temperatures below freezing over the next seven days. Not looking forward to that.
 
The NFL playoff game between the Buffalo Bills and the Pittsburgh Steelers is still on for Monday in New York. The state's governor confirms this with, quote, "fairly high certainty" after severe weather forced the postponement of the game originally set for Sunday afternoon.
 
The Buffalo Bills invited fans who could get to the Highmark Stadium safely to shovel snow Sunday. But it wasn't all work. One shirtless guy -- yes, check him out there, took a break to slide down the snow shoot. Not very productive, but the Bills were pretty appreciative of the team spirit there.
 
Go Bills, not for any other reason just, you know, go Bills. 
 
That wraps up this hour of CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Michael Holmes.
 
My friend and colleague, Rosemary Church, will be back with another hour of coverage because too many Australians are never enough.
