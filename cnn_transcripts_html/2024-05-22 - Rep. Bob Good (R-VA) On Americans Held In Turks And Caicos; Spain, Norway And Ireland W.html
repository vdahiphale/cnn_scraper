LAUREN FOX, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  This was something that Democrats had been fighting for for more than a year, according to the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, Rosa DeLauro. 
 
But at the end of the day, in the closing days of those negotiations, Jeffries sent a clear message to Johnson, according to sources, saying that this was a top priority. And because Democrats were providing such a large number of votes to get the spending bills across the finish line, ultimately, what you saw is almost every single Democrat get precisely $616,279 for at least one of their projects in the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development spending bill. And this is an important thing for Democrats because this is something that they can go back home and tout.
 
And while this was not the full amount of money that Democrats had wanted; this detail really does give a clear picture of how he operates.
 
I asked Rosa DeLauro why didn't you guys put out a press release at the time? It took months for me to find this. And her argument was we did what we needed to do. He negotiated what needed to be negotiated. Not everything has to be a press conference -- Kate.
 
KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR:  Great reporting as always.
 
Real quick, is there something behind the -- just the $616,279 that they all got? I haven't figured that out.
 
FOX:  Yeah. I mean, I think it's -- it was clearly some way that they just divided up this money --
 
BOLDUAN:  OK.
 
FOX:  -- among Democrats. There were a -- there were a handful of members who got a little bit more, Kate, but this was largely the trend that I found over and over and over again.
 
BOLDUAN:  I was looking for symbolism and I clearly was just digging into a hole.
 
It's great to see you, Lauren. Great reporting as always -- John. JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR:  All right. New this morning, an American tourist pleaded guilty to bringing ammunition into the Turks and Caicos and is now facing a possible 12-year prison sentence as a result. He's one of five Americans held there now, all on similar charges.
 
A bipartisan team of lawmakers just got back from a trip there to plead for their release. One of them joins us now -- Rep. Bob Good, a Republican from Virginia. Congressman, thanks so much for being with us.
 
What were you told when you went to Turks and Caicos and pleaded for the release?
 
REP. BOB GOOD (R-VA):  Well, we went there to meet with our constituents -- the four detainees who are still being held. Some of them as long as 90 days, some as short as just a couple of weeks. 
 
But they're being faced with a 12-year mandatory sentence for accidentally having a stray bullet or two in their luggage as they were leaving the island of Turks and Caicos -- something that they didn't intentionally bring into the country that wasn't found when they were leaving TS -- through TSA in our own country. There was no criminal intent, no harm. 
 
Turks and Caicos put in place about a year ago a new law -- or a few months ago -- that carries a mandatory 12-month -- 12-year sentence, rather, if you have possession of a firearm or any kind of ammunition. But these individuals -- the ammo was in the seam of a piece of luggage or down into the lining -- something they would never have found if it wasn't picked up by the scanners where they had to search the bags multiple times.
 
So we wanted to hear the stories directly from our constituents. I had spoken with them on the phone but wanted to speak with them directly. And then to plead with the government officials there in Turks and Caicos to consider the unintended consequence for tourists of their law, especially Americans who provide about half of the gross domestic product, the GDP, through our tourist dollars visits to their country -- about a million Americans a year. 
 
BERMAN:  Do you feel like you made any progress? Did you -- do you have any reason for optimism after this trip?
 
GOOD:  Well, I think we had a good and healthy conversation with the governor and vice governor premier, vice premier -- along with the leaders of the business and tourist community, and with our own State Department officials. And again, our plea was that discretion would be utlitized. That there would be some discernment for the unintended consequences. 
 
We're -- you know, our individuals who are being held should be released with time served. They've spent anywhere from two weeks or a few weeks in jail or in prison. They've had to pay tens of thousands of dollars for bail money and to stay there on the island. These are middle-income Americans who where there to celebrate a wedding or to celebrate an anniversary or something to that effect, and they've been held again for weeks on end and months, in some cases. 
 
So, hopefully, we'll find out next week with my constituent Tyler Wenrich. That's when he's supposed to be sentenced, I should say. And hopefully, he'll get time served, maybe a fine, and promise not to return or a public apology -- something reasonable -- and allow him to come back to America and to his 1-year-old son and his new bride.
 
BERMAN:  You know, Sen. Markwayne Mullin, who was on this trip also, said if there are prison sentences, he said we'll have to consider action to safeguard American citizens. What action?
 
GOOD:  Well, we want to tell the stories of our constituents. Some have been really suffered on some really egregious consequence for their time there and how they've been treated. 
 
But we're appealing to the good nature of the Turks and Caicos officials that hey, this is the unintended consequence. But if they -- if they were to continue to allow Americans to suffer as if they had criminal intent -- to be treated like they were bringing multiple machine guns and full magazines and things like -- if they're going to treat them that way, then we would have to advice and ask our own State Department to issue a travel advisory about going to Turks and Caicos, which would have a tremendous --
 <br>[07:35:05]
 
BERMAN:  Got it.
 
GOOD:  -- negative impact on their tourism dollars.
 
BERMAN:  Congressman, I do want to ask you -- you traveled up here to New York City to attend Donald Trump's criminal trial here. You were in the courtroom with other members of Congress. But the man who was running against you in a Republican primary in Virginia -- he got to ride in the motorcade down with Trump from Trump Tower to the courthouse. Did you get outflanked there?
 
GOOD:  That's more fake -- that's more fake news from CNN. I was in the motorcade. And my opponent, who lies about everything and lied about that as well, he knows that I was in the motorcade because he saw me in the motorcade, but he's got entities like you reporting that for him. That's a campaign talking point. It's dishonest. Certainly, I was in the motorcade.
 
But the most important thing is --
 
BERMAN:  OK, but he was the -- he was in -- go ahead.
 
GOOD:  -- it was about President Trump. It was about supporting President Trump. He's got, frankly, an unconstitutional gag order on him trying to prevent him from having a fair trial and being able to make a defense to the American people. So we were happy to go there and support him and be his voice and say the things that he's not allowed to say by this crooked, corrupt judge.
 
BERMAN:  Got it. And just to be clear, Donald Trump has not endorsed in your primary race and the thinking is it's because you backed Ron DeSantis in the Republican primary, correct?
 
GOOD:  Well, I'm happy to support President Trump. He's the greatest president in my lifetime. He's going to win. 
 
That's what this trial is about, by the way. The Democrats know they can't beat him at the ballot box. They know that all Americans were better off when President Trump was in office. They're suffering under Joe Biden. So they're trying to -- they first tried to prevent him from being on the ballot and now they're trying to weigh him down with the legal costs and keep him off the campaign trail. 
 
But he's still surging in the polls. The American people know what this is. They know it's a witch hunt. They know this is legal persecution. And we were glad to support him and have his back.
 
BERMAN:  Congressman Bob Good, thanks for coming in this morning -- appreciate it.
 
GOOD:  Great to be with you. Thank you.
 
BERMAN:  Kate.
 
BOLDUAN:  So, an historic move this morning. Ireland, Spain, and Norway all announcing plans to formally recognize a Palestinian state. Leaders of the countries say this was a coordinated effort and intended to try to help move the Israeli-Palestinian conflict toward a two-state solution. 
 
But the landmark announcement by three nations received swift condemnation from Israel. The Israeli foreign minister recalling the Israeli ambassadors from all three countries, saying their moves send the message to the world that terrorism pays.
 
CNN's Nic Robertson is in London. Nic, can you put this into the broader context? What does this mean?
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR:  I think this speaks to what the Irish prime minister said that he wanted to do, which was send a powerful political and symbolic message. There's a recognition that it's symbolic. There's a recognition that it may have political impacts as well. But other countries -- as the Palestinians were asking for other countries to consider the same move.
 
Look, this is a new Irish prime minister who is just in his. The last one, Leo Varadkar, was at the White House for St. Patrick's Day recently. And I think through the Irish media you can sense this tension that from an Irish perspective, they felt that the United States wasn't doing enough to put pressure on Israel. 
 
And this is Norway, Ireland, and Spain collectively saying the same thing to other Europe -- fellow European countries, North American countries -- the United States, in particular -- and saying more could be done. We'd like to move the dial here. 
 
Norway's prime minister said look, to have peace in the Middle East -- and this is something that the United States is saying as well -- to have peace in the Middle East you need a two-state solution. And to have a two-state solution you need a Palestinian state and an Israeli state. So he said without it -- without a Palestinian state you can't have peace.
 
You know, the United States would say OK, let's do this when we've -- when we've got a -- you know, when we've got a ceasefire in Gaza and when the hostages are back. There's a time and a place for this to happen and it should happen. And that's sort of the view of the European Union as well. They say well, it's a vision. We should get to that point of a Palestinian state. 
 
But this absolutely represents frustration on the parts of those countries and they believe that they can shift the dial a little.
 
BOLDUAN:  Nic Robertson, it's great to see you. Thank you so much, Nic.
 
BERMAN:  So this morning, a bunch of lawyers are writing speeches. Closing arguments in the New York criminal case against Donald Trump -- they happen next Tuesday. He is charged with falsifying documents to cover up hush money payments to an adult film actress, all to influence the 2016 election.
 
The jury has six days off now where somehow they're going to have to avoid talking about the case, going on the internet, of even using social media. 
 
With us now, CNN legal analyst and criminal defense attorney, Joey Jackson. And former Trump White House lawyer, Jim Schultz. 
 
Joey, a bunch of days here before closing arguments. You sit down to write these things. If you're the prosecution, what are you trying to do?
 
JOEY JACKSON, CNN LEGAL ANALYST, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY:  So, you don't sit down and write it. You're writing it during the course of the trial, right? Every witness is your narrative and every witness you're building a closing argument. Now you're structuring it such that you're going to get out the critical points.
 
If you're the prosecutors, what do you want to do is you want to minimize Cohen, right? The defense is going to be all about if you don't believe Cohen you've got to acquit. He's a liar, he's a thief, he has hatred, he's building money, et cetera. 
 <br>[07:40:05]
 
So what do you want to do? If you're the prosecution, you pivot from that. What you do is you say what are we going to believe here? We're going to believe our common sense and good judgment. 
 
Number one, we have corroboration with respect to almost everything that Michael Cohen said, right? Look at the corroboration, don't just look at his word.
 
Number two, the defense wants you into this fascination about this phone call about a 14-year-old. Is that the only evidence we have as to Trump's knowledge of the purpose of this deal, the arrangement of the deal, the nature of the deal? No. 
 
Look at the Sharpie checks. Look at the basis for why he would want a deal. "ACCESS HOLLYWOOD" tape and what that did, and how damaging it was. And on the heels of that another story being released? Are you kidding? 
 
And by the way, did he not know about Karen McDougal and did he not have -- that is, the former president -- knowledge with respect to that and this deal as it relates to Stormy Daniels is very similar but he knows nothing?
 
So those will be the arguments. As to whether they connect, that will be a jury question.
 
BOLDUAN:  And when it comes to the closing arguments from the defense -- look, closing arguments are always important. It almost feels like closing arguments here are absolutely mission critical.
 
Do you -- going in and seeing the defense strategy was to just savage Michael Cohen, coming out of it that might still be the plan for closing arguments. But how do you think it's possibly changed or shifted in the course of this trial?
 
JAMES SCHULTZ, FORMER TRUMP WHITE HOUSE LAWYER:  I don't think it has shifted, right --
 
BOLDUAN:  OK.
 
SCHULTZ:  -- because they still have to focus on the recording of that business record, and that's a key part of the case. And they're going to -- and the only real corroborating testimony -- the direct evidence, if you will, is Michael Cohen's testimony. 
 
So they're going to continue to pound away at Michael Cohen as much as possible and turning -- discrediting his testimony. Bringing up the inconsistencies and reminding the jury of all of those inconsistencies. And they're going to portray him as a liar. And it's going to be up to the jury then to make a determination of what portion of Michael Cohen's testimony they're going to believe. 
 
And that's -- you know, it's the -- it's the prosecution's burden to prove the case.
 
BOLDUAN:  Right.
 
SCHULTZ:  They have to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt. This isn't the E. Jean Carroll case where you have preponderance of the evidence. This is beyond a reasonable doubt. And if you have one juror -- just one juror that says I don't -- I don't believe he's guilty, you have a mistrial.
 
BERMAN:  The final witness in this case and, really, the only witness the defense put on other than sort of a documents person was Robert Costello, who got blowed up, as they say, by the prosecution largely in the cross-examination.
 
I am wondering how that will sit with this jury for six days. I can't remember six hours ago. Will the jury remember six days ago?
 
SCHULTZ:  So I don't think they did themselves a favor putting on Costello, especially with the mumbling and all -- and the -- and the admonishment from the judge, and kind of his temperament during the -- during his testimony. I don't think they did themselves any favors, but I don't think they -- that is really going to make a huge difference as to the jury's view on this case. 
 
It's really going to come down to the believability of Michael Cohen and some of the other evidence, as Joey stated, that corroborates some of that. But it's really going to come back down to did they believe Cohen or don't they?
 
BOLDUAN:  But what does six days do here?
 
JACKSON:  Yeah.
 
BOLDUAN:  What does six days do in terms of how you craft your narrative when you're speaking -- when you're doing closing arguments? And who does six days benefit the most in terms of the approach with the jury?
 
JACKSON:  Yeah, great questions, Kate.
 
I think what has to happen is there is that layoff period of time --
 
BOLDUAN:  Yeah.
 
JACKSON:  -- but it's your job as an attorney to remind the jurors. You've sat there, right, for multiple weeks. You've heard the evidence. Let me remind you what it is. 
 
And I think not only will we hear argument, right, from both sides with respect to propagating their narratives, but we'll hear audio, right? We'll look at video. They'll take you through the records. They'll take you through various exhibits. 
 
So closing arguments bring you back to the place, right? You know how a trial is about bringing the jurors to what happened at the scene of the crime? In this case, right, it has a lot to do, of course, with the records and the "ACCESS HOLLYWOOD" and the campaign. Well, the closing arguments will be let me bring you back to the courtroom.
 
BOLDUAN:  Um-hum.
 
JACKSON:  Let me talk to you about 'Catch and Kill Pecker.' Let me talk to you about Hope Hicks and what she knew on "ACCESS HOLLYWOOD." Let me talk to you about Michael Cohen and why, if you're the prosecution --
 
BOLDUAN:  Um-hum.
 
JACKSON:  -- he doesn't really matter that much. If you're the defense, he's everything.
 
And so I think that they will structure the argument, structure the exhibits to give the jury the reminder that he's guilty if you're the prosecutor or that Michael Cohen can't be trusted. Set him free.
 
BERMAN:  I will say David Pecker hated the nickname 'Catch and Kill Pecker' when he was growing up.
 
BOLDUAN:  Yeah, but loves it now.
 
BERMAN:  He loves it -- loves it now.
 
Joey Jackson, Jim Schultz, great to have you both here.
 
BOLDUAN:  Thanks, you guys.
 
BERMAN:  I really appreciate it.
 
JACKSON:  Thank you.
 
BERMAN:  This morning, a new investigation into the death of "FRIENDS" actor Matthew Perry. Authorities want to know who supplied him with the drugs that killed him.
 
And then, unhinged and desperate. The latest comments from President Biden on the mental state, he says, of Donald Trump. 
 
(COMMERCIAL)
 <br>[07:49:13]
 
BERMAN:  All right. This morning, as millions of people travel for Memorial Day weekend, gas prices are down from a month ago but slightly higher than they were this time last year. The Biden administration has announced it is releasing one million barrels of gasoline from the Northeast reserve in an effort to bring those prices down. 
 
CNN's Matt Egan is with us this morning. 
 
MATT EGAN, CNN REPORTER:  Well, John, I don't really think that this move is going to be a gamechanger, but arguably, we don't really need a gamechanger because gas prices -- they've actually been pretty well- behaved.
 
So here's what's going on. We see $3.61 a gallon is the national average. The Biden administration announcing the release of a million barrels from this Northeast emergency reserve. 
 
We're talking about the Northeast Gasoline Supply Reserve. It was formed in 2014 after superstorm Sandy two years before caused all kinds of chaos. It holds gas in New Jersey and in Maine. Only about a million barrels of gas. It's never been used before. 
 <br>[07:50:05] It's actually very expensive to maintain and that's why Congress, earlier this year, required the Energy Department to sell gasoline from there. So this is really not an emergency move as much as something they had to do. They are just timing it for the peak of summer driving season.
 
Now, I talked to GasBuddy's Patrick De Haan. He told me this is really not going to move the needle much for gas prices because although a million gallons sounds -- a million barrels sounds like a lot, it's really not. It's less than four hours of national supply.
 
Now, when you look at where prices are right now -- $3.61 heading in Memorial Day weekend -- obviously, much lower than two years ago.
 
BERMAN:  Um-hum.
 
EGAN:  That's when gas prices ended up peaking above $5.00 a gallon.
 
But also, we are clearly higher than we've been in previous years. Still, though, I think that the gas price situation is a lot better than we thought it could have been. There were a lot of fears of $4.00 gasoline because OPEC is holding back supply. We have Russia-Ukraine. The situation in the Middle East is obviously extremely tense. So the fact that gas prices are well being $4.00 a gallon isn't so bad. 
 
Now, all of this comes, of course, as millions of drivers are preparing to hit the road this holiday weekend. AAA forecasts 38.4 million people are going to be taking road trips this holiday weekend. That's up four percent from a year ago and its most on record. Hopefully, John, not all of them in New Jersey where I will be.
 
BERMAN:  Yes. Our friend Pete Muntean always says the best bet is to leave early and stay late. That's how you avoid the traffic.
 
EGAN:  Yes.
 
BERMAN:  I always try to listen to Pete.
 
All right, Matt Egan. Thank you very much --
 
EGAN:  Thanks, John.
 
BERMAN:  -- for that.
 
This morning, the LAPD and the DEA are investigating the source of the fatal dose of ketamine that killed actor Matthew Perry. The "FRIENDS" star was found face-down in his hot tub last October. Perry had reportedly been receiving ketamine infusion therapy for depression and anxiety. But according to the autopsy, his last known treatment was a week and a half before his death, meaning the drug would no longer have been in his system.
 
Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis easily won her Democratic primary in Georgia. The lead prosecutor and former President Trump's election interference case is considered a favorite for the general election in November. The judge in that case, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott
 
 McAfee -- he won an election to keep his seat.
 
One of the greatest tennis players of all time getting her own Barbie doll. Venus Williams will be immortalized in Barbie history as one of the company's role model dolls. She will join a list of eight other trailblazing female athletes -- Kate.
 
BOLDUAN:  That is super cool.
 
This morning, here is the warning -- the new warning from President Biden about Donald Trump.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TRUMP VIDEO:  What's next for America?
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Is this on his official account? Wow, a unified Reich? That's Hitler's language, that's not America's. He cares about on to power. I care about you.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
BOLDUAN:  That's Biden's reaction to the social media that -- from Trump's account posted under the headline "What's Next for America?" is the statement the creation of a unified Reich. That video remained up for hours even after his campaign acknowledged those words were a mistake. The video, though, has been removed as of today, but has the political impact been removed?
 
Joining me right now, CNN political commentator Bakari Sellers, and Mike Dubke, former Trump White House communications director. It's good to see you, guys.
 
Mike, let me ask you. The Trump campaign's response --
 
MIKE DUBKE, FORMER TRUMP WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR:  Good to see you.
 
BOLDUAN:  -- to all of this was that it was reposted by a staffer, and the way that the campaign put it was it was clearly -- who clearly did not see the word "Reich" we're talking about.
 
What do you think about how this happened and how it was handled from your perspective, and as a political matter, would it have been a -- been malpractice for Joe Biden to not call this out?
 
DUBKE:  Yeah. Well, we'll start from the top. 
 
I mean, just from a -- as a -- as a -- as a campaign matter it was -- and if I'm being charitable, it was either stupidity or laziness on behalf of the staffer not recognizing that word. It's a word in the English language that frankly, we shouldn't be using. 
 
As a Bills fan, I say the only time I want to hear Reich is Frank Reich leading the greatest comeback in NFL Playoff history. That's when you can say Reich.
 
So this was just a piece of -- a campaign staffer that failed. I thought the campaign did a really good job of cleaning it up. They were immediate. They closed the book on this. 
 
But absolutely, you're right. If I was running Joe Biden's campaign I would have used it. I may have not taken five takes of that five- second video to do it, but I would have -- I would have closed the book. I would have brought it up the way that they did. That's all part of these presidential campaigns nowadays.
 
BOLDUAN:  Bakari, the way that Biden's take was that's not the language of any American -- of any Americans. It's the language of Hitler's Germany. And the way that Biden has previously talked about it, it's like this is not the language of American presidents, but he did expand it to, like, of Americans -- and that's how he put it to donors in Boston yesterday at a campaign reception.
 <br>[07:55:00]
 
What do you do with this? Because so many people -- so few people -- actually is what I mean to say -- other than Trump's biggest supporters, see his social -- his Truth Social posts and his rhetoric does not seem --
 
BAKARI SELLERS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  Yeah.
 
BOLDUAN:  -- to be denting his poll numbers very much.
 
SELLERS:  Yeah, and that's the thing, Kate. I mean, it's somewhat baked into the cake, the trafficking in racism, the trafficking in antisemitism. You have to call it out at this point in time because we're seeing this rise in antisemitism. And for the leader of one of the two major parties in the country to be using language like this I think is really disturbing.
 
I think the fact that they -- that noise that we heard this morning on air was them backing the bus up over whatever intern that was. But there are other people who are responsible or should be responsible for those tweets going out. In fact, I think the former president himself bears all that responsibility.
 
Trump's campaign -- and this is going to sound strange coming from me, but Trump's campaign actually has been extremely well done. The candidate is the problem. I mean, he lacks discipline. But Jason Miller and team have done an amazing job just trying to right the ship and not letting things like this happen. And so it's surprising that as carefully as they curated this new Trump campaign that something like this happens, which goes to show you that Trump was probably involved. 
 
Joe Biden has to use it, but will it move the needle much? It will be good at fundraisers but the average voter cares more about our last segment talking about gas prices than they care about the antisemitism that is Donald Trump. BOLDUAN:  One thing that we do also know and I have seen that voters
 
 care about is contraception. And, Mike, there is something there I want to ask you about as well because Trump did this local --
 
DUBKE:  Yeah.
 
BOLDUAN:  -- interview -- local interview with a Pennsylvania --
 
SELLERS:  (INAUDIBLE).
 
BOLDUAN:  I'm good at this -- a local Pennsylvania reporter. And he was asked whether he supports any restrictions on a person's right to contraception. Trump said, "We're looking at that and I'm going to have a policy on that very shortly, and I think it's something that you'll find interesting."
 
He was asked if he -- if that -- if that had something -- if that meant he would support some restrictions on contraception and he kind of waffled through it and basically suggested that some states are going to have different policies than others. Then he backtracked on Truth Social. "I have never and will never advocate imposing restrictions on birth control or other contraceptives. I do not support a ban on birth control..." as he goes on. 
 
What is going on here, Mike?
 
DUBKE:  Well, a couple of things.
 
One, I think this is in almost the exact same vein as the -- as the previous conversation we just had. Again, I -- in this case, I think I can be -- I don't need to be charitable. I'm going to make the direct assumption that Donald Trump misheard or didn't think through the answer to the question when he said contraception and confused it with an abortion pill and other parts of the conversation of Roe V. Wade.
 
I'm going to go there because we've seen -- we've seen in other campaigns where -- even Republican primary campaigns with Lisa Murkowski and Kelly Tshibaka in Alaska where Murkowski used this very effectively. Now in that case, Kelly Tshibaka meant to say contraception. 
 
In this case, I think it was very clear that the president did not. His campaign cleaned it up.
 
But I also -- listening to the clip -- and I think it's important to listen to the clip -- I also wish and I think the American people also hope for this is that when it is that obvious of a -- of a faux paus, whether it be on the right or the left, that the anchor clean it up. I mean, I'm a bit dubious that the anchor wasn't looking for some clickbait here in the way that he phrased the question and how he phrased the question to -- frankly, to an individual who has had a lot on his mind this week and been distracted by other items.
 
SELLERS:  (Laughing)
 
BOLDUAN:  I will say just in defense of all anchors -- I know I can't get into any anchor's mind but in defense of all anchors, I ask the questions and it is your job to listen to my question and to answer it because I promise you --
 
DUBKE:  Absolutely.
 
BOLDUAN:  -- I will follow up, right, Mike?
 
Bakari, go ahead.
 
DUBKE:  No, and I trust you will follow up. I wish he had as well.
 
BOLDUAN:  Well, that's a good point.
 
SELLARS:  I think -- I think -- I just -- I struggle with that answer so much because people come on this TV show and err all the time. They give Joe Biden hell about his ability to do the job due to lack of energy or age, or whatever. And to make the excuse that Donald Trump has a lot on his mind -- I mean, he's running for President of the United States. 
 
The fact is Donald Trump is responsible for overturning Roe v. -- Roe v. Wade. He put the justices on the court to do it. And so, contraception -- this is the way that I would put it if I was the Joe Biden campaign. Look, if you want Clarence Thomas, Sam Alito, and Donald Trump deciding what your wife does with her body, reelect Donald Trump. They don't do well on this issue and they also don't do well on policy, which is why he stumbles. 
 
People vote for Donald Trump for something else. They vote for Donald Trump for that machismo -- for that what they believe to be strength. People don't vote for Donald Trump for policy depth because he has none. I mean, he has -- Donald Trump has the policy depth of a shallow bathtub.</pre>
