THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
<br>[11:30:00]
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Now, Jenin has been -- has witnessed quite a few of these Israeli military raids in the last year and a half or so. This is in response to an increasing wave of Palestinian terror attacks against Israelis over the past year and a half. The Israeli military saying that they are trying to remove Jenin as a safe haven for militants.
 
But of course, many civilians there are so deeply affected by what is happening. Residents there saying that bulldozers -- Israeli bulldozers are tearing up their streets. This is ostensibly to remove IEDs that militants have been using recently against the Israeli military there.
 
Now, we know of at least eight Palestinians who have been killed. There are reports that at least some of them are militants, but no militant group has claimed any of them as their members. We know of at least 50 injuries. We know of one Israeli soldier who was injured as well.
 
Now, the White House has said that they are monitoring the situation closely. And they did say broadly that they support Israel's security and right to defend its people. But there are condemnations coming down from places like Egypt and Jordan, of course, the Palestinian authority just for about the scale of this sort of operation.
 
And the concern now, John, is that this will turn into something so much broader. We keep talking about the days of the Second Intifada, and just feels day and day in and day out that we're getting closer to that point. The Israeli military saying that they're not engaging in any sort of large-scale military operation in the West Bank, and these are targeted operations. But Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza, says it has called on all of its members to operate now against Israel, John.
 
JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: All right, Hadas, obviously developments coming in quite quickly there. Keep us posted. Thank you very much. Sara?
 
SARA SIDNER, CNN ANCHOR: And this is just coming into CNN. The U.S. Ambassador to Russia has finally been able to meet with detained journalist Evan Gershkovich. Gershkovich faces up to 20 years in prison after being detained in March on espionage charges. He has newspapers and the government of the United States says that the charges are simply baseless.
 
CNN's Kylie Atwood joins us now from the State Department. Kylie, what do we know about this meeting? It's been a long time coming. I know, there's been a lot of concern that the U.S. has not been able to get to Evan.
 
KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that's right, Sara. I mean, this has been confirmed by the spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy in Moscow that there was this meeting today with Ambassador Lynne Tracy, the U.S. ambassador in Moscow, with Evan Gershkovich. And as you said, the significant thing here is that she has not been able to see him.
 
The U.S. ambassador has not been able to see Evan for multiple series of months since April. And the U.S. Embassy has requested access to Gershkovich over the course of those months, but those requests have been turned down. So, it is of course good news that she was able to get in and see him.
 
We aren't getting a readout in terms of how that meeting went, how he was, how he's doing. We might get more from U.S. officials you know as time goes on because it's our understanding that this meeting just concluded today. But we should note that he was detained earlier in March, as you said, on charges of espionage, that the State Department, of course, is denying, and that his family is denying he was there as a journalist for The Wall Street Journal.
 
And one of the challenges with being charged with espionage in the Russian system is that the Russians, therefore, look for something that they can get out of the United States when it comes to their spying around the world. And so, what we have reported is that U.S. officials are really working hard to try and figure out what it'll take to offer up to the Russians to get Evan out of prison. And of course, we should note that there's another American, Paul Whelan, who's also been wrongfully detained in Russia for more than four years. So, they're working on trying to figure out what they can offer to the Russians for both of those men who are wrongfully detained.
 
There's also a whole host of other Americans who are detained in the country, not necessarily deemed wrongfully detained by the United States -- by the State Department at this time. But of course, this is a space we continue to watch. The good news is that he was visited today but it comes after many months of the Russians denying U.S. diplomats access to this American Citizen, Sara.
 
SIDNER: And I'm sure some of that concern is heightened because of what's happening in Russia right now with all the confusion and the power reps. Thank you so much, Kylie Atwood, for your reporting. John?
 
BERMAN: All right, new this morning. In France, protests flaring after a teenage boy was killed by police during a traffic stop. Police detained at least 157 people overnight.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) BERMAN: Some 45,000 security forces are deployed across the country. France has been gripped by violent demonstrations following the police shooting. French President Emmanuel Macron has condemned the shooting of the teenager calling it inexcusable but he says protesters are exploiting the teen's death.
 
CNN's Melissa Bell is in France for us now with the latest. Where are things stand now in these protests, Melissa?
 <br>[11:35:02]
 
MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, this is a suburb of Paris, John, that saw a lot of that violence, not say that. So, in fact, on Saturday night, the house of the local mayor was rammed by a car on fire. An attempted murder investigation has been opened. His wife and two young children were inside.
 
What we saw here outside the town hall was still some of the damage on it. Earlier today was a march of solidarity in favor of that mayor -- in support of that Mayor. The mayor is saying a certain line now has been crossed.
 
It's been nearly a week now, John, of really remarkable levels of violence, anger gripping not just as outer suburbs of Paris in some of the less well-off neighborhoods here in the French capital, but also elsewhere in France, many of its other urban centers. And it's hard years of frustration about police brutality, but also fears and suspicions of systemic racism within the police.
 
What we've seen over the course of the weekend was another weekend of remarkable violence. 1300 people arrested Friday night. 700 Saturday night. That was down to 157 Sunday night.
 
Now, what authorities are saying is that they hope that the violence may be quietening down. And what may have helped is what young Nael, the boy who was killed last Tuesday at the police stop, had to say on Sunday. Have a listen.

NADIA, GRANDSON KILLED BY POLICE (through translator): I blame the policeman who killed my grandson. I'm the grandmother. I blamed the policeman who killed my grandson.
 
That's all I want. The police, they are here, fortunately. They are here and the people who are breaking things, I tell them, stop, stop.
 
We want to calm things down. We don't want them to break. We want them to remain calm.
 
(END AUDIO CLIP)
 
BELL: Now, the words of that grandmother who off-trolled buried her grandson early on Saturday may have carried some weight in the suburbs. And yet, police authorities say they're taking, John, no chances. The head of Paris police says those 45,000 police men and women that you mentioned will remain mobilized tonight to try and keep the streets of France calm, John.
 
BERMAN: All right. Melissa Bell for us outside Paris. Thank you very much, Melissa. Sara?
 
SIDNER: All right, back here in the U.S. Severe storms causing major disruptions at airports across the country this weekend. There are some delays with the cancellations looks a bit better. We'll have a report coming up.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:41:42]
 
BERMAN: 90 million Americans are facing severe weather threats today. Powerful storms are expected to spread from Mississippi to Massachusetts bringing wind gusts, hail, and possibly tornadoes. A record number of travelers passed through U.S. airports on Friday.
 
The weather as you can imagine created travel nightmares for many of those wanting to spend the holiday away from home or get home around the holiday. So for -- so far, 93 flights have been canceled today. That's actually not so bad. That number though, is almost certainly to rise as the storms increase around the country.
 
CNN's Pete Muntean live at Reagan National Airport. Let's start though with the weather. CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar with us as well. Allison, what are things look like right now?
 
ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST: All right, so we've got two different target points for today. The first is going to be areas of the Midwest and the high plains. The second is really going to be up and down much of the East Coast.
 
Now, both of these areas are going to get several waves of storms today. But keep in mind. Some of these areas were just hit yesterday and now they're going to go through it all over again.
 
Over 250 total reports from yesterday, the vast majority of them being damaging winds. That will continue to be the case today. Some showers are already ongoing this morning into the Northeast, but a lot more of them will ramp up this afternoon and evening particularly here stay stretching from Massachusetts, all the way back through Mississippi and even into Arkansas and Oklahoma.
 
That secondary target point is going to be up across portions of the Midwest but damaging winds, large hail, and even some tornadoes are still possibilities. The first round this morning but notice a lot more of this begins to fill back in in the afternoon and the evening once you get that heating of the day. But even going into tomorrow, the holiday itself, we are looking at additional showers and thunderstorms possible.
 
The target point really going to be this area across the Midwest, including Minneapolis stretching over to Denver. And then yet again, in many of the same areas today we're talking Massachusetts all the way back into Mississippi, the threats themselves will remain the same. You're still talking damaging winds and the potential for some large hail.
 
Another concern too is also just going to be the heat because of how widespread it is. Numerous states across the Southeast looking at those temperatures to feel like they are into the triple digits. Then out across the West, we're looking at excessive heat warnings where the temperature itself will be crossing into the triple digits, maybe even 110s and 120s.
 
That's also going to start spreading off to the North and West, so states like Oregon and Washington also looking at the potential for some heat. That likely to start peaking tomorrow for the holidays. South and into Wednesday. Keep in mind several of these locations also looking at the potential for record temperatures. We're talking at least 30 cities that could end up having records over the next several days.
 
BERMAN: Sounds like a type of forecast and to keep us on our toes for a little while here, Allison. In those terms, Pete, what does that mean for travel? I mean, I know there've been a lot of cancellations in the last few days. What about today and tomorrow?
 
PETE MUNTEAN, CNN AVIATION CORRESPONDENT: Today is not so bad, John. You know, think back to where we were a week ago when airlines across the U.S. canceled 2200 flights last Monday. Today pales in comparison.
 
We've only seen about 94 cancellations. Just checked FlightAware, a hundred -- 1180 delays. Those numbers are climbing. But think back to just yesterday. And when the storms hit the East Coast yesterday, that caused the cancellations to decline.
 <br>[11:45:03]
 
We saw about 600 cancellations across the U.S. yesterday, according to FlightAware. And the FAA is warning that as the day goes on, we could see some ground stops developing at some major hubs.
 
We're talking New York, Philadelphia, DC, Charlotte. A big hub for American Airlines, Atlanta. A big hub for Delta Airlines. So, we are off to a good start but things could change very fast.
 
I want you to listen now to Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. He's giving the airlines some credit here after they have handled this relatively well over the last few days in the short term. And he says that they are on the path to recovering from the big cancellations of last week. Listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
PETE BUTTIGIEG, U.S. TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY: We're watching more severe -- potential for severe weather. That's what touched off all of these problems about a week ago. But if you look at where we were a year ago where even on blue-sky days with no severe weather, there were really unacceptable levels of cancellations and delays. We've come a long way.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) MUNTEAN: Last week, United Airlines canceled more flights than any airline. We're talking more than 3000 cancellations that United, 8000 delays. In a new memo, United CEO Scott Kirby says he's committed to working with the FAA. Something he initially blamed for the delays and cancellations of last week.
 
He also says the airline will reassess its hub in Newark and it's scheduled there. That's a massive hub for United Airlines. And that really triggered off these cascading cancellations of last week.
 
We will see though the big test is not over just yet. John. 17.7 million people expected to be screened at TSA checkpoints between now and July 5. We saw the biggest number since December 1, 2019, this past Friday, 2.88 million people. And we saw two and a half million people the day after that. Two and a half million people just yesterday. It's been a huge holiday rush, John.
 
BERMAN: Yes, people are back. A milestone. Pete Muntean, great to see you. Thanks so much. So, make sure to join CNN tomorrow for a July Fourth celebration with an all-star lineup and spectacular fireworks.
 
The U.S. Air Force band will perform along with Demi Lovato, Post Malone, Zac Brown Band, and Sheryl Crow. That's just to name a few. CNN's "THE FOURTH IN AMERICA" starts tomorrow night at 7:00 p.m. Eastern right here on CNN. Sara?
 
SIDNER: But for those who are traveling to California, thousands of hotel workers in Southern California are on strike just as the summer travel season is heating up. What they're demanding and how it might affect you? A live report just ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:52:09]
 
SIDNER: Thousands of unionized hotel workers in Los Angeles walked off the job Sunday, going on strike just as tourists packed into Southern California for the July Fourth holiday weekend. Now, the walkout came after their labor contract expired. They are demanding better pay and benefits most of them cannot afford to live anywhere near where they work. The strike left 65 major hotels in Los Angeles and Orange County short-staffed during this holiday season.
 
CNN's Camila Bernal is in Los Angeles this morning. I see that the strike is still happening. What can you tell us?
 
CAMILA BERNAL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Sara. This is the scene outside of a number of hotels here in Los Angeles. They started at 6:00 a.m. So, if you're staying at the JW Marriott, for example, that's exactly what you're waking up to. So, it's not necessarily pleasant for a lot of the guests here.
 
These are the people behind the scenes. These are the people that cook and clean. And even though the hotels are going to stay open, it is significant because of course, you're seeing them outside instead of working in hotels. They have a number of demands, including of course higher wages and better pensions, but they're also asking for better conditions when their working safer workloads. And essentially, just better health care.
 
One of the things that they're really interested in is a housing fund as well because what they're saying is that it's almost impossible to live here in Los Angeles and work in these hotels. And they say it's almost just really difficult to be in Los Angeles with the salaries that they have at the moment. Here is what of those union members told me just a few minutes ago.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRENDA MENDOZ, UNIFORM ATTENDANT: Last year, I took a leap of faith, you know, and I ended up moving to Apple Valley because my rent was increasing to $3,000 for a two-bedroom apartment. You know, the wage and what we get paid now is not the same as you know the rent prices. And the rent has literally gone up and our wages haven't. So, we're you know basically you know, scraping the end of the barrel.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BERNAL: And she's not the only one that was expressing those sentiments. I talked to someone else who told me, I have to work two jobs in order to live here in Los Angeles. So, they say they're going to be out here for as long as it takes.
 
And it's not just here at the Marriott, but it's in a number of hotels. We did reach out to Marriott, though. And what they're saying is that they're going to remain open and that they're trying to negotiate here. The union is saying that they know what their demands are. They simply want these hotels to sign.
 
Meanwhile, though, we know people familiar with those negotiations and with plans say that they're going to remain open, and they're going to continue to do whatever they can. But the union was asking for a $5 increase. They're offering a $2.50, so we'll have to see where those numbers come from. But in the meantime, these workers will be out here picketing. Sara.
 <br>[11:55:09]
 
SIDNER: Camila Bernal, thank you so much. I know it's hard to hear us. One of the big things across the country is a lot of people who work in cities that are really, really expensive to live in, having a hard time with that.
 
BERMAN: Hard to make ends meet.
 
SIDNER: Yes.
 
BERMAN: All right. Thank you all for joining us. This has been CNN NEWS CENTRAL. "INSIDE POLITICS" is up next.
