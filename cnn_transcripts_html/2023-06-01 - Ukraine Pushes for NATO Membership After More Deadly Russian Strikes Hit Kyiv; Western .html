<br>[14:00:00]
 
ISA SOARES, CNN HOST: A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, Ukraine pushes for NATO membership after more deadly 
 
 Russian strikes in the capital, Kyiv. I'll be speaking to the NATO Secretary General in just a moment. Then, a war of words between Kosovo and 
 
 Serbia's presidents over escalating tensions in the region. 
 
We'll have the very latest on the protests there. Plus, a daring rescue on Mount Everest, as a Nepali Sherpa saves a climber from the mountain's death 
 
 zone. We'll have more on that coming up later this hour. 
 
But first, I want to start with the war in Ukraine, both sides are trying to suck morale ahead of Ukraine's expected counteroffensive. Three people 
 
 were killed during a Russian missile attack overnight when they were locked out of a Kyiv bomb shelter. Among the victims, a nine-year-old girl and her 
 
 mother. 
 
According to the person who took this photo, this is the little girl's grandfather, sitting in a spot for hours watching over her body. The city's 
 
 mayor is promising to make sure bomb shelters are opened at night to avoid this from happening again. An investigation into negligence is now also 
 
 opened.
 
Russia is also seeing the effects of Vladimir Putin's war on its own territory about 40 kilometers from its border with Ukraine. The governor of 
 
 Belgorod is blaming Kyiv for carrying out drone attacks in the region. Well, across this all is Sam Kiley who is in Kharkiv for us this evening, 
 
 that is in eastern Ukraine. And Sam, I think it's fair to say we have been seeing now an increase in these cross-border incursions including reports 
 
 today of an explosion in the Russian city of Belgorod. What more can you tell us? 
 
SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, there has been -- 
 
(CLEARS THROAT) 
 
We have been able to geo-locate the explosion in Belgorod. It has been hit before in raids that have not been claimed by the Ukrainians, particularly 
 
 occasional helicopter raids, special forces raids, usually directed ammunition dumps. But this seems to have been a strike in the center of the 
 
 city. This is on top of a number of strikes that the Russians are saying the Ukrainians carried out against a number of board villages to the 
 
 southeast of Belgorod down towards where I am in Kharkiv, not far from Ukraine's northern border. 
 
And with the results as far as the Russians are saying, Isa, that at least, eight people were injured. They say that many hundreds of civilians, women 
 
 and children in particular have been evacuated. They have -- the media have published pictures of evacuees arriving in evacuation centers being looked 
 
 after by Russian officials. 
 
All scenes reminiscent of what we've seen all too frequently on this side of the frontline in Ukraine since the beginning of the war. I think what's 
 
 really significant about this though is that the Russian citizens who are fighting under the auspices of the Ukrainian Armed Forces claim again that 
 
 they have crossed into that self-same area and claim to have had a number of successes against the Russians. 
 
The Russians for their part say that they have repelled that raid. Again, we can't really prove the truth of this one way or the other. But I think 
 
 what is significant here as we've discussed just last night, I think, Isa, is that this is a new phase in -- 
 
SOARES: Yes -- 
 
KILEY: Ukraine's war in terms of taking the conflict into Russian territory. 
 
SOARES: Meanwhile, as I mentioned at the top of the show, Sam, residents in Kyiv no doubt rattled by what occurred overnight. Do we know why this bomb 
 
 shelter was closed? 
 
KILEY: Well, it's the subject of an official investigation. The bomb shelters are supposed to be opened at night. They are all out -- all over 
 
 the city both in kind of public squares, under buildings, most of them dating back to the Soviet era when the Ukrainians were anticipating as part 
 
 of the Soviet Union that the potential to deal with a nuclear attack by NATO. 
 
Now, we've seen NATO saying outright that they expect in the form of the Secretary-General, that the decision to admit over the longer-term Ukraine 
 
 into the NATO fold is effectively a done deal. 
 <br>[14:05:00]
 
That is completely flies in the face of what Vladimir Putin was hoping to do with this invasion in the first place. Which of course, was justified on 
 
 the basis that he feared Ukraine might one day be welcomed into that fold, Isa. 
 
SOARES: Important context there. Sam Kiley joining us this evening from Kharkiv. Thank you very much, Sam. Well, as the fighting continues, Ukraine 
 
 is also pushing for two of its top priorities on the world stage. Joining both NATO's -- you heard Sam mentioning there, and the European Union. 
 
 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had this to say at a summit in Moldova earlier today. Have a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT: Ukraine is ready to be in NATO. We're waiting when NATO will be ready to host and to have Ukraine. And I 
 
 think security guarantees are very important, not only for Ukraine, for our neighbors, for Moldova, because of the Russia and of their aggression in 
 
 Ukraine and potential aggression for other parts of Europe. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
SOARES: Let's get more on all this, I'm glad to welcome NATO's Secretary- General Jens Stoltenberg on the program. Now, Mr. Stoltenberg, welcome back to the show, great to see you. I want to get more context really what came 
 
 out of this meeting because I heard today the German Foreign Minister say that NATO cannot accept new members while they're in the middle of the war. 
 
U.S. said the same I believe in the last month or so. Why then, sir, is Ukraine's accession dominating these meetings if you're all on the same 
 
 page here? 
 
JENS STOLTENBERG, SECRETARY-GENERAL, NATO: We all agree that in the middle of the war, we cannot make Ukraine a full member of NATO. But at the same 
 
 time, we need to prepare for what happens when the war ends because then we need to ensure that history doesn't repeat itself. That President Putin 
 
 just reconstitutes and arrest the Russian forces, regroup and then attack again. 
 
Because he has attacked Ukraine many times. It started not last year, it started in 2014, first with Crimea, then with eastern Donbas, and then with 
 
 the full-fledged invasion last year. And this vicious circle -- cycle has to be stopped, and therefore, we need to discuss and address what kind of 
 
 security arrangements can we have in place to ensure that President Putin is not able to continue to chip away at the European and Ukrainian 
 
 security. And then the issue of also, security arrangements, membership in NATO will be part of that discussion. 
 
SOARES: Understood, but without accession at this time, how can then you guarantee NATO's ongoing support as well as unity when the political 
 
 climate here could change at any moment? I'm thinking here of the U.S. elections. 
 
STOLTENBERG: So what we have seen is very strong support throughout the alliance in Europe, but of course, also and North America for an 
 
 unprecedented level of military support for Ukraine. And President Putin made a big strategic mistake when invaded Ukraine by totally 
 
 underestimating the courage and bravery of Ukrainians. 
 
But they also totally underestimated NATO and NATO allies, our resolve to support Ukraine. And I welcome the strong bipartisan support in the United 
 
 States for supporting Ukraine. And I'm absolutely confident that we will be there to stand by Ukraine for as long as it takes. It will be a big tragedy 
 
 for Ukrainians if President Putin wins, but it will also be dangerous for us. 
 
Because the message to him and other authoritarian leaders including in Beijing is that when they use force, they get what they want, and that will 
 
 make also us, NATO allies, United States, Europe, more vulnerable. This is in our security interest to ensure that President Putin does not win in 
 
 Ukraine. 
 
SOARES: Well, also waiting, I should say impatiently to become a full- fledged NATO member, is Sweden. You are traveling, you said, today, I believe, Mr. Stoltenberg, to Turkey soon. What then will be your message to 
 
 President Erdogan with regards to Sweden's membership here? 
 
STOLTENBERG: So my message is that all NATO allies, also Turkey made a historic decision last year at a NATO Summit in Madrid to invite both 
 
 Finland and Sweden to become members of the alliance. The Finnish accession has been ratified by all NATO parliaments, so now, Finland is a member. And 
 
 then, my message is that Sweden is also ready for ratification. 
 <br>[14:10:00] 
 
They have met all their obligations including stepping up the fight against terrorism and working more closely with Turkey in addressing legitimate 
 
 security concerns that Turkey has. And since Sweden is delivering on that, I think the time now like almost to ratify Swedish section into NATO. 
 
SOARES: Do you think it will get the support from Turkey, given that Sweden has met all the requirements? 
 
STOLTENBERG: Well, that's one of the reasons I travel to Ankara, is to sit down and discuss, because so far, the Turkish assessment has been another, 
 
 and therefore we need to sit down and address the Turkish concerns. Because we need to remember that these are real concerns. Meaning that no other 
 
 NATO ally has suffered more terrorist attacks than Turkey. 
 
So, the fact that we actually need to step up, work more closer together, exchange intelligence information, work more closely in addressing those 
 
 challenges. That I -- these are legitimate and real concerns, and then we sit down with them and address how we can move forward together and ensure 
 
 full Swedish membership. 
 
SOARES: I'm not sure whether you heard our correspondent Sam Kiley, just before we came to you, Mr. Stoltenberg, because he was talking -- and this 
 
 is something that Sam and I have discussed now for the last two weeks, we have been seeing and he has been reporting on an uptick in these cross-
 
 border attacks on Russia with the city of Belgorod seeing drone attacks in fact, in the last few weeks. How worried are you about these cross-border 
 
 incursions? 
 
STOLTENBERG: So wars are dangerous, and there's always a risk for escalation. At the same time, we have to remember what this is. This is a 
 
 war of aggression. President Putin, Moscow attacks another sovereign independent nation in Europe, Ukraine, and Ukraine has the right for self-
 
 defense. That is a right enshrined in the U.N. Charter, and NATO allies, we provide support to Ukraine to help them uphold their right of self-defense. 
 
It was President Putin, the decision-makers in Moscow that started this war, and they can end the war by stopping attacking Ukraine. 
 
SOARES: Well, the United States, sir, has said it doesn't support attacks on Russian soil, and the concern is, of course, U.S. weapons could be used 
 
 in this incursion. I want you to listen to what Mr. Kirby had to say. Have a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
JOHN KIRBY, COORDINATOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS, NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL, WHITE HOUSE: We do not enable, and we do not encourage attacks 
 
 inside Russia. We certainly don't want to see attacks inside Russia that are being propagated, that are being conducted using U.S.-supplied 
 
 equipment. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
SOARES: Do you share in that concern, Mr. Stoltenberg? Do you worry that this could escalate this war to a direct conflict with NATO and Russia? 
 
STOLTENBERG: So NATO allies have stated the same as we just now heard from the United States, that we don't encourage, we don't enable, and then many 
 
 allies also made it clear that the weapons systems that they have delivered to Ukraine should not be used for anything else than protecting Ukrainian 
 
 territory. 
 
But again, this is about Ukraine's right to defend themselves, and what we have seen is that Ukraine has been able to liberate territory, and they 
 
 have the right to push out the Russians who have actually invaded their country. 
 
SOARES: Can I just clarify? Have you been told by Mr. Zelenskyy that none of the weapons being used in these cross-border incursions have been 
 
 supplied by U.S. or NATO allies? Can you just clarify that for us. Is that what you just said, sir? 
 
STOLTENBERG: Well, the different NATO allies deliver weapons on a bilateral basis to Ukraine. And the allies that have made arrangement agreements with 
 
 Ukraine has made it clear that these weapons are for protecting Ukraine against Russian aggression, and to be used to liberate Ukrainian territory. 
 
 So that has been stated by several allies, and that's in line with what also Ukrainians have stated several times. 
 
SOARES: Right, but no assurances they're not being used. That was the point I was trying to make. Look, Let's try -- let's turn if I can to the central 
 
 goal against the story that we have been covering here on my show for several days. The rising tensions in the region that has led to 30 NATO 
 
 peacekeepers being wounded. I want to get your reaction to what we have been seeing, Mr. Stoltenberg, in the last week. 
 <br>[14:15:00]
 
STOLTENBERG: What we have seen is violence against NATO peacekeepers that reflects the increased tensions. And therefore, we have called both on 
 
 Pristina, but also on Belgrade to reduce tensions and to engage in the facilitated dialogue to find a political solution. Because that's the only 
 
 way for a peaceful solution. 
 
But we have seen the violence, the unprovoked violence against NATO troops, and therefore we also decided to send in extra troops, 700 more NATO troops 
 
 to Kosovo, to ensure that we have the capabilities to maintain stability in the region, and to protect of course, the right for free movement, and to 
 
 follow up on the U.N. mandate NATO has in Kosovo. 
 
SOARES: You've asked them to reduce tensions, I'm keen to try and understand how -- you know, how you think they're going to do that, because 
 
 the Prime Minister of Kosovo who I have spoken to on Tuesday says the protesters are ultranationalists, right-wingers who are being paid -- these 
 
 are his words by the way -- paid and ordered from Belgrade. 
 
The Serbian president who I spoke to yesterday on the show denies this and says that Kosovo hasn't delivered on its pledges of previous agreements 
 
 here in regards to the municipalities in the north that majority Serbs. So, what are you asking from Kosovo and from Serbia to try and de-escalate 
 
 this? 
 
STOLTENBERG: Well, so, first and foremost, we are calling on them to implement the agreement they made not so many weeks ago. And to ensure that 
 
 they actually fulfill their commitments in that agreement which are different mechanisms to reduce tensions and to follow up on a dialogue path 
 
 which has been established and which is facilitated by the European Union. 
 
Then NATO has a mutual purpose, and still we have the presence there for several decades, a couple of decades, and we are there to support that 
 
 political process, to support diplomatic efforts, and then to actually deploy forces when we see tensions increase as we saw recently in northern 
 
 Kosovo. And we have increased our presence just to ensure that we have the necessary capabilities. 
 
SOARES: NATO Chief Jens Stoltenberg, always wonderful to have you on the show, sir, thank you very much giving us the time tonight. Thank you. Now, 
 
 we have been following these -- those developments in Kosovo very closely as I mentioned on the show, so much as to looking at what's at stake in 
 
 this region and Europe, of course, as a whole. 
 
Scott McLean has been on the story throughout. Your take of what you heard there from Stoltenberg, Jens Stoltenberg on the question of Kosovo and 
 
 Serbia here. . 
 
SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I mean, some of it we've heard from him already -- 
 
SOARES: Yes -- 
 
MCLEAN: You know that the attacks are unacceptable, that they're sending in more troops, that the violence that's back in this region is what we've 
 
 heard previously. I found it really striking that he clearly didn't want to wade into the political question -- 
 
SOARES: Yes -- 
 
MCLEAN: In all of this. He didn't want to point the finger at one or the other whereas we've seen from the United States, a very different approach. 
 
SOARES: But he did say they need to stick to the agreements that were signed only a few weeks ago. So just remind us what that entails. 
 
MCLEAN: Yes, so the agreement that was signed, that's called the overt(ph) agreement, essentially recommits Serbia and Kosovo to the 2013, so a decade 
 
 ago, Brussels agreement which essentially gives these majority Serb regions some level of autonomy. The difficulty in all of this and Jens Stoltenberg 
 
 calling on the parties to go back to the agreement that had been signed is that they haven't actually been implemented. 
 
SOARES: Yes -- 
 
MCLEAN: There have been bits and pieces here and there that have come and gone. But by and large, for a host of different regions, be it the courts 
 
 or be it political pressures from both sides at home, much of this hasn't actually been implemented, and it seems like the burden largely falls on 
 
 Kosovo to implement this. Since we're talking about stuff that happens on their territory. 
 
SOARES: So given what we heard from Jens Stoltenberg, given what we heard yesterday from the United States on what the U.S. would like the U.S 
 
 ambassador what they would like to see, have we heard any reaction from Kosovo. Are they prepared to make any moves here? 
 
MCLEAN: I laugh only because the short answer is so simple. It is very clearly, no. The United States wants two things from Kosovo. They want them 
 
 to have the mayors with a very tiny mandate, I mean, a voter turnout under 4 percent. They want them to not work from the town halls. They want them 
 
 to work from an alternate location since they say -- 
 
SOARES: So outside of this municipalities? 
 
MCLEAN: Outside of the municipal buildings. 
 
SOARES: Right -- 
 
MCLEAN: As they say they're essentially just doing admin work. They also want them to withdraw the police, but Albin Kurti; the Kosovan Prime 
 
 Minister made clear again today that he has no plans to do that. Listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
ALBIN KURTI, PRIME MINISTER, KOSOVO (through translator): Mayors should go and work in their offices. There is no need for parallelism. We need to 
 
 have normality, to have a republic for democracy. 
 <br>[14:20:00] 
 
And for a municipality that will serve its citizens. What is the meaning of having public buildings for state officials if they are not used. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
MCLEAN: He also made clear that he's not going to withdraw the police forces anytime soon. The Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic, you 
 
 interviewed him last night, we heard from him again today, and he's calling for the withdrawal of these ethnic Albanian mayors. He is also warning 
 
 Kosovo to actually implement some of the things that they've also agreed on, but he says that Kosovo needs to play along. Listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
ALEKSANDAR VUCIC, PRESIDENT, SERBIA (through translator): We will try and do our best for things to return to normal, for the situation to de-
 
 escalate. But whatever that will happen or not, it takes two to tangle, and it's not just up to us. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
MCLEAN: And as Jens Stoltenberg rightly pointed out the latest agreement that was reached at least, in principle between these two parties happened 
 
 just in March. 
 
SOARES: Yes -- 
 
MCLEAN: We're talking -- again, the problem is, it's one thing to agree to it, in theory, it's another one to actually put it in practice on the 
 
 ground -- 
 
SOARES: But no protest of today from what you're saying -- 
 
MCLEAN: There were protests today and yesterday. Today, we actually saw them from the ethnic Albanian side of northern Kosovo. Both yesterday and 
 
 today though, largely peaceful. 
 
SOARES: I know you'll stay on top of this, Scott McLean, thank you very much. And still to come tonight, special forces veteran takes Australian 
 
 newspapers to court after he's accused of war crimes. What the civil case ruling could mean for other elite soldiers. That is ahead. Then later, a 
 
 climber on Mount Everest is lucky to be alive, and it's all thanks to a Nepali Sherpa guide. We'll tell you about the epic rescue. That's next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
SOARES: Well, a stunning end to a landmark court case in Australia. One of the country's most decorated soldiers has lost a multimillion-dollar 
 
 defamation case against three newspapers. Ben Roberts-Smith is a veteran of Australia's elite Special Air Service Regiment. The papers accused him of 
 
 committing war crimes in Afghanistan including the killing of unarmed prisoners. CNN's Angus Watson has more on the judge's decision. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
 
ANGUS WATSON, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): This was one of the biggest defamation cases in Australian history. 
 <br>[14:25:00] 
 
Over 100 days of testimony resulting in a massive win for three journalists and then newspapers who filed these intensely detailed stories back in 
 
 2018, alleging that Ben Roberts-Smith; Australia's most decorated soldier had committed war crimes while serving in Afghanistan between 2009 and 
 
 2012.
 
Now, Roberts-Smith has always denied those and brought these defamation proceedings against the newspapers today, he has lost. Now, this was not a 
 
 criminal proceeding, this was a defamation trial. But it served as a proxy for a war crimes hearing. This was the first time that war crimes 
 
 allegations have been tested by an Australian court, and most egregious of those allegations were upheld. 
 
Those included Ben Roberts-Smith killed an Afghan, non-combatant with a prosthetic leg, and that Ben Roberts-Smith kicked an elderly Afghan man off 
 
 a cliff, and then ordered Australian soldiers to shoot him. Now, some of the soldiers that served with Ben Roberts-Smith in Afghanistan testified 
 
 against him in this case. 
 
Some of the Afghan civilians which came into contact with Australian soldiers some ten years ago beamed into Australia's federal court to tell 
 
 their side of the story, ultimately, this was a proceeding brought by Ben Roberts-Smith to defend his public standing. This is what one of the 
 
 journalists who was vindicated in their reporting had to say outside the court today about Ben Roberts-Smith. 
 
NICK MCKENZIE, JOURNALIST: I'd like Ben Roberts-Smith to reflect on the pain that he's brought lots of men in SAS who have stood up and told the 
 
 truth about his conduct, that were marked and belittled in court, that were bullied, that were intimidated. Some had letters sent to them, threatening 
 
 letters. I'd like Ben Roberts-Smith to reflect on the people he murdered, the man he kicked off a cliff, the Afghan villagers. That's what I think 
 
 Ben Roberts-Smith should reflect on. 
 
WATSON: This case will have ongoing ramifications for the Australian military, and the perception of the military here by the public. It will 
 
 have ramifications for Australia's legacy in Afghanistan, which is of course, now controlled by the Taliban that they were fighting against. In 
 
 2020, the Australian military announced the findings of its own investigation into alleged killings of non-combatants by Australians in the 
 
 country. 
 
39 Afghan non-combatants were deemed to have been murdered by Australian soldiers. One of those soldiers has been charged with murder. The problem 
 
 for Ben Roberts-Smith now is the chance that he might also face criminal charges relating to his time in Afghanistan. That is certainly a 
 
 possibility now. Angus Watson, CNN, Sydney, Australia.

SOARES: Well, a Malaysian climber on Mount Everest is alive thanks to a Nepali Sherpa guy. The Sherpa was helping a Chinese client the summit when 
 
 he saw the other climber clinging to a rope in a notoriously dangerous area. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
 
SOARES (voice-over): At the ominously named death zone of Mount Everest during one of the deadliest climbing seasons on record. Nepali guide Gelje 
 
 Sherpa carried out a rare and almost impossible rescue mission. It was midnight when he saw a Malaysian climber clinging to a rope shivering in 
 
 freezing temperatures, just over 1,100 feet away from the 29,000 feet high summit. The air too thin for humans to breathe and for helicopters to land. 
 
GELJE SHERPA, MOUNT EVEREST GUIDE (through translator): It was important for us to rescue him even from the summit. Money can be earned any time. 
 
 Left like that, he could have died. We have saved his life by quitting the summit. 
 
SOARES: Gelje convinced his client to abandon their summit climb attempt so they could save the Malaysian climber's life. Gelje wrapped the distressed 
 
 climber in sleeping mat and hauled him down with another guide's help.
 
SHERPA: We had brought him down from Camp 4 carrying him on our backs because dragging was impossible. It took me 5 to 6 hours to get from 8,500 
 
 meters to 7,900. It was very difficult. 
 
SOARES: From there, a helicopter lifted the climber and down to base camp. The favorable Spring weather is gradually turning even more unpredictable 
 
 due to climate change. Eleven people died on Everest in 2019, a climbing season that saw unprecedented traffic and long delays in the same death 
 
 zone near the summit. 
 
This season Nepal issued a record 478 climbing permits. So far, 12 people including an American have died. The highest number for eight years and 
 
 another five are missing. The unidentified climber was put on a flight back to Malaysia last week, thanks to Gelje, his name was kept off the list of 
 
 the mountain's victims.

SOARES: What a hero, Gelgi (ph). Incredible story there. 
 
Still to come tonight, Donald Trump's handling of state secrets is back in the spotlight. Up next, a CNN exclusive report with a new piece of evidence 
 
 in the investigation. We'll break it all down for you. And that's next.
 
(MUSIC PLAYING)
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
(MUSIC PLAYING) 
 
SOARES: Welcome back, everyone. An update of a story we've been following closely that kept global financial markets on edge. 
 
Right now, U.S. senators are meeting to pass a bill to suspend the debt limit. Lawmakers are racing to avert the default which is just days away by 
 
 the way. Once the Senate passes the measure, it can be sent to U.S. President Joe Biden for his expected signature. 
 
Later Wednesday, House lawmakers voted to raise the debt ceiling by a comfortable bipartisan margin. 
 
Now to a CNN exclusive report on the investigation into former U.S. president Donald Trump. Sources say federal prosecutors have obtained an 
 
 audio recording of Trump's speaking about a classified Pentagon document he held onto. 
 
What he said could determine his life of defense that the documents he took were declassified. Let's bring in Katelyn Polantz from Washington for more 
 
 on this. 
 
What exactly is Trump saying in this reporting and how did prosecutors get it? 
 
KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Well, CNN has not listened to this recording. We haven't known the exact words that 
 
 Donald Trump says on it. 
 
But we have heard from multiple sources what he said in this crucial meeting, July 2021 in New Jersey, at his golf club in Bedminster. In this 
 
 meeting, he's very angry because, at that point in time, after Donald Trump leaves the presidency -- 
 <br>[14:35:00]
 
POLANTZ: -- there are very unflattering stories coming out about him and what he wanted to do to hold on to power after he lost the American 
 
 presidency. 
 
One of the things he does is he's reacting to a news story. This news story was about General Mark Milley, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
 
 telling Donald Trump that he couldn't start a war with Iran if he wanted to, stopping Trump from launching some sort of military strike. 
 
But in this meeting in July 2021 that's captured on audio, Donald Trump is talking about how he has a document for a plan from the Pentagon, from 
 
 Milley, that would undercut Milley and would be about how they could launch a military strike on Iran. 
 
So it's very significant in that the Justice Department was able to get an audiotape of this particular moment in time after Trump leaves the 
 
 presidency. On that audiotape, it's apparently quite blatant that Donald Trump refers to the document as if it's right there in the room with him. 
 
He's referring to a document that's clearly about this Iranian -- this plan of the United States to potentially attack Iran if that is what he had 
 
 wanted to do as president. Obviously, it didn't happen. 
 
But he's also on the audio waving a paper. You can hear on the audio we've been told by our sources that you can hear the paper rustling. There is 
 
 also laughter in the room. People he's speaking with are not people who have security clearances, that have the ability to have access to secretive 
 
 national defense information of the United States. 
 
It's people working on an autobiography for someone who was in his administration and it's communication aides of Trump after he leaves the 
 
 White House. 
 
The other thing that's so significant about this audio -- and that is not my words. That is words that many of these sources who talk to us about 
 
 this have said this is an important moment in this part of the investigation, an important piece of evidence. 
 
The other thing it captures Trump doing is acknowledging the limitations he has on him after he leaves the White House, that the document is 
 
 classified, that he can't declassify it, that he wishes he could share it more widely and he is not able to. 
 
So all of those things put together make this quite an astonishing piece of potential evidence and evidence that has prompted the Justice Department to 
 
 get grand jury testimony about this meeting, about the document. 
 
And we also know they have taken an interview with General Milley himself, who's obviously his opposition to Donald Trump at the end of the 
 
 presidency. It is a crucial piece of this as well. 
 
SOARES: Katelyn Polantz, appreciate it. Thanks very much.

ANDERSON (voice-over): Crowds of Jordanians waved flags along the 10- kilometer motorcade route across the capital. The star-studded event attended by world leaders, by celebrities and by royalty, including the 
 
 Prince and Princess of Wales; the first lady of the United States, Jill Biden, also in attendance. 
 
The ceremony taking place at Zahran palace, where King Abdullah and Queen Rania were married in 1993. The royal couple expected to greet more than 
 
 1,700 guests at their son's reception. 
 
Rajwa is the daughter of a wealthy family in Saudi Arabia. With her ascent, the Jordanian throne comes hopes of a new era of stability between two of 
 
 the most important countries in the Middle East. 
 
This wedding coming at a crucial time for Jordan. For the past two years, a former crown prince, Hamza Ben al Hussein, half-brother of the current 
 
 king, has been under house arrest, accused of trying to destabilize the kingdom. 
 
And Jordan is home to a huge refugee population. Its dire economic situation means it needs vital investment and aid. The wedding, raising 
 
 hopes that improved relations between Saudi Arabia and Jordan could usher in more economic benefits. For now, though, the wedding is a day for the 
 
 country to come together --

SOARES: Still to come tonight, backed by some of the most famous women in the world, we go inside Angel City Football Club and a new documentary city 
 
 series. That team's cofounder joins me next.

SOARES: And still to come tonight, this is a story we were just sharing with you. She's fans' favorite stylist, sex, positive, powerful publicist 
 
 and, just like that, she's back. What we know about Samantha's return to the "Sex and the City" spin-off.

SOARES: And just like that, a long-lost cast member from "Sex and the City" is coming back. 
 
(VIDEO CLIP, "SEX AND THE CITY")
 
SOARES: But Kim Cattrall, who played fan favorite Samantha Jones, was famously not there for the first season of the reboot, amid reports of bad 
 
 blood. Cattrall is bringing sex positive publicist Samantha back for at least one scene in season two. It's all very hush-hush.
 
Like CNN, HBO is owned by parent company Warner Brothers/Discovery. I want to bring in Chloe Melas for more. 
 
And this story yesterday, late last night, kind of broke the internet. Explain why everyone was so surprised here. 
 
CHLOE MELAS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, everyone was so surprised because Kim Cattrall, came out and said last year that she had put that chapter of her 
 
 life behind her. When speaking to "Variety" at the Power of Women event, she had said that she had moved on and that that was just not something 
 
 that she was interested in doing. 
 
So it caught fans by surprise -- for many of them a pleasant surprise because she was a fan favorite on the show. And to put things into 
 
 perspective when "Sex and the City" finally ended, after six seasons in 2004, you saw 10.4 million people tune in for that finale, which was a 
 
 record at the time. 
 
It was about 18 months after the end of "The Sopranos," which saw record numbers. So this is a show that has withstood the test of time. They came 
 
 back for two feature films like you said. And then this reboot on our parent company, on Max. 
 
What we do know is that she filmed one scene in March. It was filmed in Queens, New York, in a parking garage where she is reportedly in a town 
 
 car. We know that her name was not on the call sheet; she didn't interact with the other women on the show. 
 
And if you've been paying attention to what's gone on off screen, with the characters you know that Sarah Jessica Parker, the title, the main 
 
 character of the show, the title character, and Kim Cattrall are not the best of friends. 
 
We've seen that play out publicly. We've seen them feud and go back and forth on social media. Perhaps that was the reason why Kim Cattrall didn't 
 
 want to come back for "And Just Like That..." for the first season. 
 
But something moved the needle for her but we just don't know what it is. I know I've been reading some of the comments on social media and some fans 
 
 are disappointed that it's just one scene but perhaps it's one that will lead to more. We're not quite sure, Isa. 
 
SOARES: I'd like to see the ratings as well, how we've done as times have changed. I wonder if there's still that appeal. 
 <br>[14:55:00]
 
SOARES: I think that's also critical. Chloe Melas, we appreciate it. Thank you very. 
 
MELAS: Thank you.
 
SOARES: Now Hollywood star Ryan Gosling is defending himself against those who think that he is too old to play Ken in the new Barbie film. 
 
(VIDEO CLIP, BARBIE MOVIE) 
 
SOARES: Can't wait to see this. After the first movie trailer dropped in April, we brought you a clip of that, some people went on social media to 
 
 claim that the 42-year-old appeared too grown up to play Barbie's boyfriend. 
 
Well, Gosling has fired back in an interview with "GQ" saying, "If people don't want to play with my Ken, there are many other Kens to play with." 
 
Gosling says one of the main draws about taking the role was being a part of a movie that put female characters out front. 
 
And that does it for us for tonight, thank you very much. Do stay right here, "QUEST MEANS BUSINESS" with Richard Quest is next. I shall see you 
 
 tomorrow, have a wonderful day.
