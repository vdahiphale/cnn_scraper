ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN ANCHOR: Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us from all around the world. You are watching "CNN Newsroom," and I'm Rosemary Church.  
 
Just ahead. Ukraine gets security commitments and promises of unwavering support, but no specific timeline for joining NATO. Ahead, what is next for President Zelenskyy.
 
Plus, a major plot twist for Hollywood, a second labor strike is looming as the deadline just passed for actors to reach a deal with this studios. 
 
And Thailand's democracy faces a critical moment today as parliament votes for a new prime minister. 
 
UNKNOWN (voice-over): Live from CNN Center, this is "CNN Newsroom" with Rosemary Church. 
 
CHURCH: Good to have you with us. Well, U.S. President Joe Biden will be spending a final day of his high-stakes overseas trip in Finland, where he will be meeting with Nordic leaders and the Finnish president in the hours ahead. That visit follows at the crucial NATO summit in Lithuania, where leaders offered Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy security guarantees and assurances that appear to have calmed frustrations and concerns over Ukraine's future in the alliance. 
 
But still, the Ukrainian leader does not have a timeline for NATO membership. He did though leave the meeting with a promise of unwavering support from allies, and moves meant to boost the country's military capability as the war grinds on. 
 
Zelenskyy called the summit a meaningful success for Ukraine, and said the two days of talks remove any doubts about whether Ukraine will be in NATO.
 
CNN's Alex Marquardt has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SR. NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): President Joe Biden delivering a rallying cry for Ukraine, now almost 17 months into its war with Russia. 
 
JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: Our commitment to Ukraine will not weaken. We will stand for liberty and freedom, today, tomorrow and as long as it takes. 
 
MARQUARDT (voice-over): The speech in Lithuania's capital, Vilnius, coming at the end of a dramatic and sometimes heated two days of discussions over Ukraine's future within the NATO alliance. 
 
BIDEN: What's going to happen, we are moving in the right direction, I mean, it is just a matter of getting by the next few months here. 
 
MARQUARDT (voice-over): Presidents Biden and Zelenskyy all praised and thanks for closing out the NATO summit despite Ukraine coming away without the biggest ticket item had hoped for, a concrete path to NATO membership. 
 
Zelenskyy had come into the summit blasting the lack of a membership timeline, as unprecedented and absurd. On Wednesday, he took a softer tone, arguing the summit was a success because of the firm promise of an eventual invitation, and security guarantees in the meantime. 
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT: The outcome of the NATO summit in Vilnius is very much-needed and meaningful success for Ukraine, and I'm grateful to all leaders in NATO countries for very practical and unprecedented support. 
 
MARQUARDT (voice-over): While the U.S. and others argue that NATO membership for Ukraine is impossible while a war is raging, the White House advertised a major announcement of long term pledges from G7 countries. including, more security aid, economic support, help with recovering from the Russian onslaught, and with democratic reforms.
 
JAKE SULLIVAN, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: It has made substantial progress along the reform path, and there are more steps to take. So what the alliance said, with one voice last night was, we look forward to a future with Ukraine and NATO. We will work with Ukraine along the pathway to NATO, but we are not prepared to invite Ukraine today. 
 
MARQUARDT (voice-over): In the short-term, a slew of countries promise hundreds more millions of dollars in weapons, long range missiles from France, more patriot missile launchers from Germany and armored vehicles from Australia and Great Britain, among many other items.
 <br>[03:04:59]
 
Ukraine also celebrated a so-called F-16 coalition of 11 NATO countries with pilot training beginning as soon as August, hoping to have U.S. made of 16 fighter jets in the skies by early next year, though no country has yet pledged the aircraft. JENS STOLTENBERG, NATO SECRETARY GENERAL:  We need to keep up and
 
 further expand our support to help Ukraine liberate its land and deter future Russian aggression. 
 
MARQUARDT (voice-over): The war taking no pause as the leaders met. Ukrainian authorities say 18 people including six children were injured Wednesday in the southern city of Zaporizhzhya by an unidentified hostile aerial object. While earlier in the day, Ukrainian air defenses repelled Russian bombardment on the capital Kyiv for a second night in a row. 
 
(on-camera): As Russia continues to carry out attacks or at least tries to all across Ukraine, the Kremlin responded angrily to what Ukraine got at the NATO summit, mainly those long term security guarantees, saying that they could be an encroachment on Russian security and lead to what they call, extremely dangerous consequences. 
 
Alex Marquardt, CNN, Ludmink (ph) Ukraine. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHURCH: And even though Ukraine did not win its main prize, Estonia's prime minister still believes NATO membership is just a question of time. She spoke with CNN following the summit in Lithuania. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KAJA KALLAS, ESTONIAN PRIME MINISTER: All of the allies, the big ones to small ones, are taking this very, very seriously, and today everybody emphasize that Ukraine's place is in NATO, the question is not if but when it will happen. And we have agreed practical steps and pathway to get there. So, if those conditions are met, the opportunity window opens when the war ends, and then we can admit Ukraine into NATO and have this Article 5 coverage also for Ukraine, and that is the cheapest and actually only functioning security guarantee that there is. 
 
We have to do everything to help Ukraine as long as it takes. And of course, when there is no more ammunition to give and accept the cluster bombs, I think we have to give those as well. Ukraine has said that they will not use them on those territories where you have civilians. They will just use them to defend themselves, and push Russia back to Russia. I mean, that is the aim that we all have, and that is why Ukraine is also very grateful for the cluster bombs the U.S. has given. 
 
Seeing Russia very, very up close and seeing how they function, their playbook has not changed. The way they occupy and delivered all of the atrocities they did in my country or Ukraine or Latvia, or Lithuania, Poland for that matter, this has not changed.
 
So, we know how they operate, and that is why I think here we should also be listening to because we know how to cut this historical cycle. And the key to this is of course Russia going back to Russia, aggression not paying off, but also accountability for the war crimes, but also the crimes of aggression that is the leadership crime that no leader is left unpunished for what they have committed. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: Well, former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is urging the U.S. not to grow weary of Ukraine's grinding battle against Russia. He tells CNN Kyiv's victory over Moscow is imperative and says America's continued support must include a steady flow of weapons. 
 
He warned that one of Kyiv's biggest challenges in the conflict aside from the Russian army is what he called Ukraine fatigue from the rest of the world. The former prime minister emphasized the importance of NATO support for Ukraine. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BORIS JOHNSON, FORMER BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: Ukraine is going to join the alliance, but first of all Ukraine's going to win, and that's absolutely crucial. And I just say to everybody, you know, if you think there is a negotiated solution, we can do with Vladimir Putin, you know forget about it. There is no way that he is going to do a trade of land for peace. He's going to continue to keep attacking Ukraine if he possibly can. That is clear from everything he done. So, the only way through this thing, is for the Ukrainians to win. 
 
We'd to keep supplying them with the weaponry that they need and will be very effective and that is good without training them in the use of the F-16's, and the jets, but after that two things happen. First of, all we are going to make some security guarantees, as you've heard from the NATO Summit, some countries are going in advance of NATO membership.
 <br>[03:09:52]
 
So like the U.K. and the U.S., and we are saying, we are going to help fortify Ukraine, give it NATO quality equipment, send our troops there, put, you know, British soldiers, why not British troops in bases in Ukraine, and some kind of fortify the quills of the Ukrainian porcupine that it is never attacked again by Russia. That is step one. Step two is to negotiate for NATO membership. I think that is not a question of when, not if. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: CNN's Nic Robertson is following developments and joins us now live from London. Good morning to you, Nic. So what difference has this NATO summit had on the war in Ukraine after a tense start in significant unity and support?
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR:  Yeah. We did get that immediately. Zelenskyy said that he wanted, you know, upfront weapons commitments now rather cruise missiles from France, more ammunition and more equipment for the U.K., and patriots vehicles for the patriot missile defense system from the Germans and others. And there was a lot of upfront for right now. 
 
And then there was the NATO statement of, you know, ultimately without a timeline, without specifying the conditions, that Ukraine will -- is going in the right direction.
 
And then, another thing, the G7 communique that had that very important line and that was important for President Zelenskyy kind of just saying you are going to have this super solid long term security guarantees until you get to NATO without being that specific, but that is how Zelenskyy interpreted, and that's how he explained it to his people on the train on the way back to Kyiv this is how he put it. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ZELENSKYY (through translator): For the first time during our independence, we have established a foundational security on our path to NATO. These are specific security guarantees confirmed by the top seven democracies in the world. We have never had such security framework before at the level of the G7. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ROBERTSON: So those still have to be negotiated, and bilateral relationships need to be worked out, how much -- how much equipment, you know, how much money will be coming, when will it come, where will the training be, how long will the training take, all of the specifics they still have to be worked out.
 
But I think, you know, yes, there was a bit uphill here for President Zelenskyy. He didn't get the strong guarantees he wanted. But actually one of the big things that came out of this, again, Sweden coming on board, Turkey removing its objections, and the ultimate path for Ukraine is NATO unity over this. It is easy to underestimate just how difficult that can be, 31 now 32 different nations all leading to agree and sign off on what is something as huge and very complex.
 
But that unity is in the face of the cracks that are now appearing in Russia. You had the Prigozhin mutiny. You have the defense minister yesterday, apparently firing one of the top generals in Ukraine -- Russian generals for speaking out about the way that the war is not being fought by Russia very well. So the cracks are appearing on one side and the unity is on the other side. That has to be for everyone and NATO, I think, the big takeaway. 
 
CHURCH: Yeah, and of course, before they got to that point of unity, there was that tension we mentioned at the start. And some of that included the U.K., and others suggesting they were not receiving enough gratitude. What came out of that? 
 
ROBERTSON:  Yeah, Ben Wallace, the Secretary of Defense, essentially said that you know, I went there to Ukraine for a meeting, it took me 11 hours long way by train, and presentably, he said I'm not amazon or word of that effect, you know. Just gave me a list and I can't deliver. 
 
You know, I think there is a sense of that we heard that from Jake Sullivan, the U.S. National security advisor, when he was speaking to the question in -- with an audience there in Vilnius. And President Zelenskyy went out of his way, again, to thank the United States, to thank the British, to thank the French, the Germans, Japanese, the Canadians, everyone, to thank everyone who was lined up on the stage with him. 
 
So, i think you know, they do get it. And President Zelenskyy's ultimate rebuttal to Ben Wallace was what should we be doing? Yes, we are hugely grateful. What is it that you -- we should -- what is it you actually want us to do to show gratitude? You know, I think there is a basic disconnect. Look, you get a --  you get a bunch of diplomats and leaders that are gathered in a country that is not at war, who knows what it's like, but it's not at war. They are not coming from capitals where they're at war.
 
And you get this president showing up for a country that has been in war for over 500 days, the stresses, the strains of leadership of putting the eyes on the front line are ultimately going to die, and that is on your name, and what you are saying to do, and this cauldron of a conflict where you are desperate to hold an enemy back looks like they may come over the trench wars at any moment, and take more territory, you come in with this real sense of immediacy and this real sense of, you know, stress strain, and need to get stuff done.
 <br>[03:15:13]
 
And of course, that, you know -- that doesn't gel so far with the common collected leaders as they show up from their various capitals. 
 
CHURCH: Yeah. Very well report. Nic Robertson joining us live from London. Many thanks. 
 
Well, just ahead here on "CNN Newsroom," North Korea's most powerful weapon, and the North's most powerful woman both making headlines this week as Kim Jong-un tests a long-range ballistic missile. 
 
Plus, the overwhelming favorite to become Thailand's new prime minister, but new legal challenges and the old guard may stand in his way. A live report as parliament is now in session. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHURCH: The foreign ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations are gathering right now in Jakarta. Sometime today China's top foreign policy chief is expected to meet on the sidelines with the U.S. Secretary of State, who just arrived and also with the Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. Russia and China have remained closed allies amid the war in Ukraine.
 
So let's turn to CNN's Anna Coren. She is following this for us from Hong Kong. Good to see you, Anna. So, what is expected to come out of those critical discussions on the sidelines? 
 
ANNA COREN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Rosemary, as you say, Anthony Blinken arrived last hour in Jakarta to attend ASEAN, and he will be meeting with China's top diplomat Wang Yi on the sidelines that will take place in about three hours time. 
 
The other big name, as you say, is Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. He addressed the summit earlier today, and he will also be holding talks with Wang. Wang was not supposed to attend this summit. Chinese foreign minister Qin Gang was scheduled to represent China; however, he felt ill.
 
Just last month Blinken met with Wang in Beijing on what was the first visit to China by the U.S. Secretary of State in five years. The aim was to reset relations and communications between the U.S. and China which as we know, it has been at an all-time low.
 
Just last week we saw the U.S. Secretary Treasurer in Beijing, and a climate envoy John Kerry will be flying in this weekend. You know, the diplomatic activities certainly raised hopes of improved relations, between the U.S. and China, and potentially clearing the way for Joe Biden and Xi Jinping to meet. 
 
But were hearing of these revelations of Chinese hackers breaching email accounts of two-dozen U.S. organization, including government agencies like the State Department and that is causing real alarm Microsoft and the White House have confirmed the hack was a spying campaign aimed at and sensitive information 
 <br>[03:20:05]
 
Adding to these tensions, Rosemary, the U.S.-led NATO alliance, which obviously met this week issued a strongly-worded communique saying that China challenge its interest, security, and values with its ambitious and coercive policies.
 
Now, Beijing responded angrily saying it supposed any attempt by the military alliance to expand its footprint into the Asia-Pacific region, so certainly there is a long list of issues, and no doubt, grievances for Wang and Blinken to discuss this evening. 
 
CHURCH: Indeed, we will see what comes of that. Anna Coren joining us live in Hong Kong, many thanks.

North Korea is hailing its latest missile test as the longest run is ever flown. State media reports the Hwasong-18 Inter Continental Ballistic Missile flew for 74 minutes on Wednesday, before crashing down in the waters near Japan. The solid fuel ICBM has been called the North's most powerful nuclear weapon, but it is unclear if it could actually deliver a nuclear payload. 
 
State media says leader Kim Jong-Un personally guided the launch just days after his powerful sister issued some serios threats.
 
CNN's Will Ripley explains.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
WILL RIPLEY, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A menacing milestone for North Korea's missile program. Pyongyang's latest ICBM launch, breaking its own record for the longest ever missile flight, a staggering 74 minutes, hurdling high above the earth at supersonic speed, hitting 6,000 kilometers of force in the sea. 
 
The massive missile's potential striking range the entire U.S. mainland and the most of the world. Pyongyang's most provocative launch in months, coinciding with this NATO summit in  Lithuania, quickly condemned by Japan as an unacceptable threat to regional stability. 
 
South Korea's military ready to overwhelmingly respond. The ICBM, a crown jewel in leader Kim Jong-un's nuclear arsenal, protecting the power, fortune, and future of the ruling Kim family. His young daughter, Kim Ju-ae often appearing alongside her dad, barely 10 years old, a rising star of a state propaganda campaign, carefully crafted by Kim's younger sister, the mastermind of the Kim family brand, the leader's loyal confidant, trusted adviser, and perhaps most powerful women in North Korea. 
 
CHUN SU-JIN, AUTHOR, NORTH KOREAN WOMEN IN POWER: DAUGHTERS OF THE SUN: She is the number two, that is for sure, but she is very smart lady, and she actually knows that her position is secure only when her big brother is secure. 
 
RIPLEY (voice-over):  Just five years, ago very few people knew of Kim Yo-Jong. She stepped on the South Korean soil, the first member of North Korea's ruling family to cross the DMZ. She carried a message of peace from Pyongyang. North Korean athletes and cheer squads had a warm welcome for 2018 Winter Olympics.
 
She rose to fame as a fixture at her brother's side, standing silently behind Kim as he met with Former President Trump that a brief period of diplomacy feels like a distant memory.
 
The silent sister now a loud voice of defiance, issuing a fiery statement on state media, often laced with crude language. This week, she threatened to shoot down U.S. spy planes accusing them without evidence of entering North Korean territory, warning in case of repeated illegal intrusions, the U.S. forces will experience a very critical flight. 
 
Past actions prove he is not all talk. In 2020, a dispute with South Korea ended with a bang. Kim ordered the demolition of a joint-liaison office at the border, turning diplomatic dreams into a pile of rubble.
 
(on-camera): She ordered the demolition of a building partially because she was angry that South Korea wasn't doing enough to stop activists from sending propaganda leaflets in balloons to the north. She is accusing the U.S. and South Korea of having the most hostile and aggressive behavior, calling the South Korean president a fool and those two countries now strengthening their military alliance, which means there could be even stronger responses from North Korea, and the second most powerful person in North Korea, Kim Yo-Jong.

CHURCH: Thailand's parliament is meeting to elect a new prime minister, and possibly end the nine years of a military-backed rule in the country. 
 
But the main opposition leader is facing last-minute legal challenges that threaten to derail his candidacy. And he is in for an uphill battle to win over lawmakers to support him. 
 
For more, Kristie Lu Stout joins me now from Hong Kong. Good to see you, Kristie.
 <br>[03:25:01]
 
So the Thai parliament is still in session and will eventually vote for the next prime minister. Who will that likely be? And what does the Move Forward Party leader bring to the table? He's certainly a lot of interest from young people, hasn't he?
 
KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, absolutely, all eyes on the leader of the Move Forward Party, but the outcome of the election is still very much uncertain as you pointed out. Parliamentary debate in Thailand is underway. A vote will take place, less than three hours from now and the candidate has got to get 376 votes to win. The process is transparent. In fact, as you can see on the screen it is being broadcast live in Thailand via Parliament TV. We heard earlier this week from the Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha, he took power nine years ago in a coup, he is not seeking reelection and he will retire on politics. 
 
It was in May when his party was defeated by the opposition in a general election. So that's why all eyes are on the leader of the progressive Move Forward Party, Pita Limjaroenrat. He is a 42-year-old graduate of Harvard. He is a former executive of the Southeast Asian super app, Grab. And to become premier, he needs around 60 more votes. He needs to get them from rival parties, from conservative senators. And for him, that is going to be tough given his party's stance, very progressive stance on monarchy, on the Lese Majeste rules, on military reform, but Pita is confident. Take a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
PITA LIMJAROENRAT, MOVE FORWARD PARTY LEADER: I am confident and I will do my best to match the hope and encouragement from the people. Thank you to all who came to give support in front of parliament as well as those who have sent messages. I will do my best to explain for those senators who are still have questions even before the May 14 election and now answered all their questions. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
LU STOUT: Now, Pita has to get the votes today, he also faces a potential legal setback. He could be disqualified as a lawmaker over a shareholding of a media company issue. In fact, the Thai constitutional report will be reviewing that case next week. Back to you, Rosemary. 
 
CHURCH: All right, Kristie Lu Stout joining us live from Hong Kong. Many thanks. Well, coming up, the climate crisis is on full display in Asia with
 
 deadly floods, sweltering heat, and landslides. And warnings there could be much more in store. We are back with that and more in just a moment.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHURCH: All right, now to Hollywood where we have learned negotiations are ongoing between screen actors and the major studios and streaming services to reach a new collective bargaining deal to avoid a strike. 
 <br>[03:30:00]
 
The deadline had passed at the top of the hour, but with talks ongoing, we will, of course, keep you updated on any new developments. Members of SAG-AFTRA, the union representing 160,000 actors, performers, and other artists had voted to walk off the job without a new deal. And if that happens, Hollywood would have a double strike on his hands for the first time in more than 60 years, with the screenwriters and actors both on the picket lines at the same time.
 
Both unions are fighting for better pay, residuals, benefits, and addressing concerns over artificial intelligence. SAG AFTRA has the support of many Hollywood A-listers, including stars of the new Barbie movie.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MARGOT ROBBIE, ACTOR AND PRODUCER, "BARBIE": Yeah, absolutely. No, I very much in support of all the unions and I'm a part of SAG's. So, I would absolutely stand by that. 
 
RYAN GOSLING, ACTOR: I will support the actors they have about -- yeah.
 
GRETA GERWIG, DIRECTOR AND CO-WRITER, "BARBIE": I love the unions. They have always protected all of the artist I know, and I really want them to stand strong and win their fight.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH:  CNN media critic, Brian Lowry, joins us now live from Los Angeles. Brian, great to have you with us. So, talks are ongoing with pressure added, of course, by A-lister actors saying that they're ready to go on strike, which could, of course, mean both writers and actors striking together for the first time in 60 years. What impact could that action have on studios if no deal is reached?
 
BRIAN LOWRY, CNN MEDIA CRITIC:  Well, the Hollywood has already ground to mostly to a halt with the writers out and a lot of people unwilling to cross the picket lines. If the actors joined them on the picket line, it will bring things -- it will really cut things down to almost nothing going on.
 
And, you know, for the studios, I think in these negotiations, historically, the writers are always -- are always taking the toughest stand. The directors are usually the most pliable. They've already made a deal. And the actors are usually the wildcard. They're not always sure what the Screen Actors Guild is going to do.
 
This time around, the Screen Actors Guild has sounded very much like the writers guild that they know that the industry is at an inflection point, and they need to make a stand of some sort now.
 
CHURCH:  Yes, because, of course, at the heart of the, strike is a disparity in pay for writers particularly who do not get a slice of the streaming action. They received reduced residuals. Why is it so hard for the studios to share some of their vast profits with these writers, particularly who provide critical content?
 
LOWRY:  Well, one of the things that has happened is the industry is in a -- is in a major state of flux. I mean, two things can be true, the studios have been a very, very -- kept their cards very close to the vest on streaming data so that actors, writers, directors have no idea how many people are watching their shows. And therefore, they don't know what fair compensation or fair residual payments on that are -- on that are.
 
At the same time, the industry is coming out of the -- is coming out of the pandemic. The theatrical business has been very uneven this summer. We've have some major box office bombs. The linear TV market is changing. And the advertising for that has been taking a hit this summer and the negotiations for the full.
 
So, the studios are uncertain about what the future holds and the actors and writers and guilds are uncertain. And that's really a formula for the kind of tension we are seeing here.
 
CHURCH:  And of course, the last actor strike was back in 1980. That lasted three months and three days. How long might this one last if they can't reach a deal?
 
LOWRY:  Well, I mean, the writers have already been out for more than 10 weeks. If both of them go out, it's obviously going to create more pressure on the organization representing the studios and streaming services to make a deal.
 
However, they will take advantage of this period to try to sort of clear their books. You have already seen them doing that with getting rid of some of the writer's deals that they wanted to shed. And for a time, they may be able to weather it. The question is, as with any of these standoffs, how long and who will really start to feel the pain first.
 
CHURCH:  So, they will start repaying things over and over and over again.
 
LOWRY:  Well, this is the time -- you know, that's one of the thing about streaming is that the shelves are there. It may not be new, but it may be stuff that's new to you if you haven't seen it. So, for a while, people who could catch up on things that they may have wanted to watch but haven't watched it. But the business is driven by hot new products. And if that goes dormant and these things are produced far and advance, you will start to see people looking for something to watch and not finding it.
 
CHURCH:  Yeah. Viewers are waiting for that next season for their favorite show, don't they? Brian Lowry, thank you so much for joining us. I appreciate it.
 
LOWRY:  Thank you.
 <br>[03:35:10]
 
CHURCH:  Ukraine's Air Force says it downed 20 Iranian made drones and two cruise missiles overnight. It's the third night in a row Russia has launched attacks on the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. Officials say at least one person was killed and two injured as falling debris damaged several parts of the city and spiked a fire in an apartment building.
 
Meanwhile, Ukraine's military is touting progress near Bakhmut and in the south.
 
CNN's Clare Sebastian joins us now live from London. Good morning to you, Clare. So, what is the latest on the fighting and Russian attacks on parts of Ukraine?
 
CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, Rosemary. Russia really bookending this NATO summit with this third night of attacks involving, as you said, 20 drones, two cruise missiles, and one ballistic missile and Iskander M, which the Ukrainian Air Force says was fired from Crimea, which as of now they are not saying was shot down. So, one of this have got through. We don't know yet the impact of that.
 
Russia continues to sort of interspersed the fighting in the front line with these aerial, particularly overnight attacks. This one said to be particularly frightening even the British ambassador to Kyiv tweeting that she was jolted awake in the middle of the night, how they rushed to a shelter. So, this continues to be something that Ukraine grapples with on a, you know, weekly and somebody says daily basis.
 
Meanwhile, the fighting in the frontlines is extremely difficult. We're not seeing any big offensives. We're seeing small pockets of gains. The Ukrainian military saying they are making some small gains in the southern and eastern fronts concentrating on areas around Bakhmut, also down the south, Melitopol and Berdyansk, and particular focus on the tacking behind the enemy lines, ammunition depots, headquartered, things like that, all of that in effort to try and weaken Russia's efforts on those front lines itself, to try and save more Ukrainian lives as they continue with this offensive.
 
That is why those weapons provisions, the long range missiles promised to them at the NATO summit, are particularly crucial at this moment. Rosemary?
 
CHURCH:  And Clare, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is now responding to Ukraine receiving F-16s. What did he say? SEBASTIAN:  So, Ukraine, as of yet, has not had an actual promises to receive F-16s, but there is momentum in that direction. The Ukrainian foreign minister in the eve of the NATO summit saying they expect to be able to bring them into play by the end of the first quarter of 2024 and then we -- you got sort of the coalition of 11 NATO countries promising to train Ukrainian pilots. The Netherlands saying this will start in August.
 
So, Lavrov responding to this saying that essentially they will interpret the appearance of F-16s in -- you know, in the ranks of the Ukrainian military as a threat in the nuclear sphere because these planes are, in theory, capable of carrying nuclear weapons. He said that our army is not going to be able to figure out in the middle of hostilities what kind of weapons these planes are carrying. So, any kind of F-16 and the battle will be considered a nuclear threat.
 
And this is, you know, the same rattling (ph) that we've heard throughout this war from Russia in the nuclear sphere here. I think it speaks to the discomfort over these continued weapons supplies from the west than any actual threat. There is, of course, no evidence and thus far in the conflict it's only the Russian side that has raised a nuclear threat that has made any threat in that regard, whatsoever. Rosemary? 
 
CHURCH:  All right. Our thanks to Clare Sebastian joining us live from London.
 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is expressing optimism around his country's path to NATO membership, saying the two-day NATO summit in Lithuania removed any doubts about whether Ukraine would be in the military alliance.
 
NATO leaders offered Zelenskyy security guarantees and assurances, but still no timeline on joining the group. They did pledge unwavering support as U.S. President Joe Biden and G7 leaders unveiled long term security commitments. Zelenskyy called at the summit a meaningful success for Ukraine.
 
And I discuss these developments just a short time ago with Andriy Zagorodnyuk, a former Ukrainian defense minister and current chairman of the security think tank Center for Defense Strategies. And here's his take on NATO membership for Ukraine.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDRIY ZAGORODNYUK, FORMER UKRAINE DEFENSE MINISTER: Of course, Ukraine wants membership in NATO and that's understood because only membership in NATO can secure the architecture in Eastern Europe. Because without massive presence of NATO including Ukraine, the world will have some instability and there will always be some risks. So, that's why Zelenskyy and many countries, particularly eastern European countries, are pushing for Ukrainian membership.
 
However, until that happens, we need to have some framework, which will decrease chances and probably deny Putin and ability to launch new campaigns and that's why this secondary decisions about at the starting of this security framework is obviously a positive developed for sure.
 <br>[03:40:06]
 
To say that this completely replaces the NATO membership, no, we cannot say that. But it's certainly a very, very good deal (ph).
 
CHURCH: Right. And you accept that NATO couldn't take Ukraine on board at this juncture because that would be basically launching itself into war?
 
ZAGORODNYUK:  Very few nations and very few experts expected immediate membership like during this summit. I don't think it was possible. And not because of the joining into the new world as a side of the conflict, because actually Article 5 doesn't say that, but it's more about the understanding that in this case countries -- large countries supporting Ukraine will have to commit to massive investments, which they even cannot calculate.
 
So, yes, that's -- that was unrealistic to expect. I don't think politically anyone expected. However, what we could have expected is that a more specific, more concrete plan how to -- how to reach membership, and that wasn't done, the plan which was outlined in communique is very vague, but -- so that's the result for today.
 
CHURCH:  Right. And the United Kingdom and others complain about Ukraine not showing enough gratitude for the authority offered by the U.S. and its allies. Does President Zelenskyy need to be more mindful of this, despite his concern of his war torn nation? But is there a worry here that people could get a little bit of fatigue for Ukraine as Boris Johnson suggested if there is not more gratitude shown?
 
ZAGORODNYUK:  Well, to be honest, I think we're showing a lot of gratitude every day to our partners, and particularly those who work with military and -- in issues of defense. They know that. What happened was the statement from the U.K.'s secretary of defense, but if you remember there was in a median statement from the PM, from prime minister who said that Ukraine actually shows a lot of gratitude on absolutely regular basis. Particularly, he remembered the speech of Zelenskyy in the U.K. parliament, where he was extremely positive about the cooperation and very grateful for support.

CHURCH: Still to come, the high-profile BBC presenter who was suddenly suspended the this week has now been identified by his wife. The latest on what we know, when we come back. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHURCH:  Turning to the United Kingdom now and the wife of BBC anchor, Huw Edwards, has confirmed that Edwards is the BBC presenter who was suspended earlier this week following allegations of payments for sexually explicit images.
 <br>[03:45:00] A statement made on behalf of Edwards was released just moments after the London Metropolitan Police said on Wednesday that there was no information to indicate that a criminal offense has been committed.
 
These developments are the latest in a week of British media frenzy as CNN's Scott McLean reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
UNKNOWN: This is the BBC home service. Here's the news.
 
SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): The British Broadcasting Corporation has been covering the news for more than a century. But lately, it is the news.
 
On Friday, "The Sun" newspaper printed anonymous allegations accusing an unnamed but well-known male BBC presenter of paying a young person for explicit images. The BBC reported they had suspended the presenter, and the U.K., known for its sensational tabloid culture, was thrown into a frenzy of speculation over his identity. Several well-known BBC faces were quick to distance themselves online and even on air.
 
JEREMY VINE, BBC ANCHOR: It's his decision, but he needs to come forward now.
 
MCLEAN (voice-over):  Alongside questions of who came up questions about what, with the young person at the center of the controversy themselves even disputing the allegations made by their mother to "The Sun." The BBC referred the complaint, which originally received back in May, to the London METROPOLITAN POLICE.
 
TIM DAVIE, BBC DIRECTOR GENERAL:  It is a very difficult and complex situation, and we're trying to calmly and judiciously navigate our way through quite difficult circumstances, where as I said, you've got to balance duty of care issues, privacy issues.
 
MCLEAN (voice-over):  On Wednesday, the Met declared there was no information to indicate that a criminal offense has been committed, the second police force to draw the same conclusion.
 
Shortly after, the wife of Huw Edwards, one of Britain's most famous and the BBC's highest paid journalist, made a statement on his behalf, confirming the accusations were made about him and asking for privacy, writing, "I am doing this primarily out of concern for his mental well-being and to protect our children. Huw is suffering from serious mental health issues. The events of the last few days have greatly worsened matters. He has suffered another serious episode, and is now receiving inpatient hospital care, where he will stay for the foreseeable future. Once well enough to do so, he intends to respond to the stories that have been published."
 
Edwards has been open about mental health struggles in the past, saying at one point things got so bad he couldn't get out of bed. In the meantime, the BBC now says it will continue its internal investigation. Other less serious allegations have been made against Edwards.
 
Police say they are aware but haven't received specific information, and that there is no police action on them at this time. Questions about the BBC's handling of the complaints will surely not fade from the front pages anytime soon, now neither will questions about the veracity of the original reporting in "The Sun" newspaper.

(APPLAUSE)
 
CHURCH:  The law will require countries to introduce measures to restore nature on a fifth of their land and sea areas by 2030. But despite that applause you just heard, it wasn't unanimously adopted. It faced massive pushback by right and center right parties, who say it will harm farmers and food security. But supporters say there is no time to waste.

TERRY REINTKE, MEMBER OF EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT, GREENS/EFA:  Our rivers are dying. Our forests are sick. Our nature is in deep crisis. We have to restore our nature, not in a distant future, not when EPP has gathered to act together, we have to act now.

ANNA CORREN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  The rolling front line of the global climate crisis right now stretches through Asia, from Japan and China to India. Across the continent, stifling heat is giving way to torrential rain, swollen rivers, and mudslides. In Northern India, dozens of people have been killed in raging floodwaters. Bridges, cars, and homes crushed Himachal Pradesh, roads flooded and washed away. Survivors left to pick through the wreckage.

CORREN (voice-over):  In Japan, eight people have been killed in landslides and flooding just this month. Houses have washed away, hospitals have flooded, electricity and water has been cut off. The downpour the heaviest they have ever been on the mountainous island of Kyushu, where the forecast is for more rain.
 
BRADSHAW:  We are living in an age of consequences to pass the inaction on climate change. We see this playing out all over the world with every communities is affected. But there is still so much we can do to limit future harms.
 
CORREN (voice-over):  No one nation holds the solution to the climate crisis, but China, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gas, holds more sway than most. The China Energy Investment Corporation, the world's largest coal fire power generation company, says it produced more electricity on Monday and then on any other day in the past. Hundreds of millions in China are sweltering through what could once again be the country's hottest ever summer. And it's not just people who need protecting as our world gets warmer.

CHURCH:  An Asian elephant that spent 20 years in chains has become a sensation in Thailand now that he's back home and getting medical treatment for his henry.
 
CNN's Laila Harrak has details.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LAILA HARRAK, CNN ANCHOR(voice-over):  Meet the latest internet star in Thailand. Hundreds of thousands of people are watching this elephant, named, Sak Surin, every day on a Facebook live stream. Once neglected and shackled, he's attracted a growing fan base after a long awaited rescue earlier this month.
 
Here is what happened. Two decades ago, Thailand's royal family gave the elephant to Sri Lanka as a gift. He was transferred to a Buddhist temple to carry holy relics and parades, the Thai government says. But over the years, animal welfare groups say he was mistreated. They say he was sustained injuries that were left to fester. Here he is, bruised and shamed.
 <br>[03:55:03]
 
UNKNOWN:  Had he remained in the temple, he would've got infections on his bones, collarbone we see, and so on.
 
HARRAK (voice-over):  Thailand asked Sri Lanka, if they could repatriate the elephant for treatment for treatment, and they agreed. It was a massive task to move the 4,000 kilogram animal. It was flown in a special crate on a cargo flight that Thai officials say costs $700,000. Well, now at the Thai Elephant Conservation Center in Lampang, Thai officials say, Sak Surin is undergoing medical treatment in a 30-day quarantine.
 
UNKNOWN (through translator):  From our observation, some of the injuries found on the elephant will take a year to heal before he can make a full recovery and be in strong health once more.
 
HARRAK (voice-over):  The Sri Lankan prime minister said he sent his regrets to the Thai king over the elephant's treatment, a step to try and heal any diplomatic wounds, as the real ones inflicted on the elephant still have a long way to go.
