ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN ANCHOR:  Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us from all around the world. I'm Rosemary Church. 
 
Just ahead here on CNN Newsroom, new strikes over key Russia launches deadly Kamikaze drones into Ukraine's capital bringing a new wave of terror to the city. 
 
The European Union slaps new sanctions on Iran in response to its violent crackdown on anti-government protests.
 
And British Prime Minister Liz Truss is apologizing for her budget blunder as her newly appointed finance minister promises a plan for economic stability.
 
UNKNOWN:  Live from CNN center, this is CNN Newsroom with Rosemary Church. 
 
CHURCH:  And we begin with new developments out of Ukraine where President Zelenskyy says Russia is continuing to terrorize and kill civilians with more air attacks on multiple cities across the country. This morning, a senior Ukraine in officials says three strikes have hit an energy facility in Kyiv.
 
This after word that two strikes damaged a power facility in the city of Dnipro. The mayor of Kharkiv in the east reports a series of explosions and to the south, the mayor of Mykolaiv says a two-story residential building was destroyed and one man killed after a night of shelling. 
 
And this comes one day after Russia launched a wave of deadly kamikaze drone strikes in Ukrainian cities far from the front lines, Ukraine says dozens of drones were shot down, but several hit the capital killing at least four people.
 
The attacks appeared to be part of a wide result that took aim at critical infrastructure and civilian targets across the country. Ukraine's President says even though his forces are fighting back more, international help is needed.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translator):  In just 12 hours from 9 p.m. Sunday, 37 Iranian Shaheds and several cruise missiles were destroyed. The world can and must stop this terror. When we talk about Ukraine's need for air and missile defense, we are talking about real lives that are being taken by terrorists. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH:  At least 13 people are dead including three children after a Russian fighter jet crashed into a nine-story residential building in the southwestern city of Yeysk on Monday. Citing Russia's defense ministry state media reported the jet was doing a training exercise when one of the engines caught fire during takeoff, and the pilots ejected safely. 
 
The Kremlin says, President Putin has instructed authorities to provide assistance to the victims. Russian investigators have opened a criminal case into the crash.
 
And CNN's Nic Robertson is standing by with the latest in Kyiv and our Salma Abdelaziz is tracking developments from London.
 
So good to see you both. Nic, let's start with you and talk about these Kamikaze drone strikes around Kyiv. But not only that, also these latest attacks on cities across Ukraine apparently targeting energy, energy, depots. 
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR:  Indeed. And I think we were witness to that in the last hour. And we were speaking what we now know appeared to take us off air was a strike in Kyiv. We couldn't hear it from where we were standing, but it hit a power station. It's not quite clear how that rippled through to impact the -- our connection to you. But it occurred at exactly the same time. 
 
And it seems, from what we can estimate at the moment that that was the likely cause of that hit during our last live broadcast. And this is what Russia's trying to do. It's trying to get at the energy supplies around the country. We've heard, from the -- about the strikes in Kharkiv, to the east of the country. And we've heard about them, Dnipro south of here in the east of the country. 
 
We've heard them about strikes today in Zhytomyr, which is about a hundred miles west of where we are here in Kyiv. All of them targeting electricity supplies and what authorities say as well that that residents in those areas are experiencing now electricity outages, but also water outages.
 <br>[03:05:05]
 
Because its electricity drives the pumps that fuel that pushes the water around people's houses and to businesses and industries. And it's very clear that Russia has switched part of its tactics over the past week or so to try to deny Ukrainians the opportunity to have heating, to have their lives as some semblance of normal. And this is, it appears to be through this use of kamikaze drones and other missiles a war by attrition against the energy services here. And it would seem to be something that's going to take time to play out to bring -- to bring the, you know, to bring cities like Kyiv to a standstill. It isn't happening, but the effect is being felt.
 
CHURCH:  Indeed. And Salma, what more are you learning about that Russian fighter jet crash in Yeysk? 
 
SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN REPORTER:  So, a devastating crash, a devastating accident that's led to over a dozen people being killed. Several others injured; more than a hundred people evacuated. President Putin having to respond to this accident within a matter of hours, instructing emergency services to provide all of the assistance that these victims need. And there's also been an investigation launched by local officials. 
 
But what we know so far, Rosemary, about this crash yesterday during a training exercise, this supersonic bomber jet, it's a Russian SU34 fighter jet that was taking off from a military training site. Again, part of a training exercise as it was taking off. One of the engines caught fire that forced at least one of the pilots to eject himself from the jet, and then the jet eventually crashing into this residential area, setting a building on fire, setting off a fire that spread across 2,000 square meters.
 
I know we have social media video to show you of just the aftermath of this in the town of Yeysk. This is a port city right across the water from Ukraine, from Mariupol actually. And what we've seen come out of this is yet again, Russian families, Russian citizens, having that reality of the war on the other side just crashing quite literally into them, Rosemary.
 
CHURCH:  Absolutely. And Nic, going back to you, what details do you have on a Russia, Ukraine prisoner swap? 
 
ROBERTSON:  Yes, for the first time Russia and Ukraine's human rights commissioners met. They met at a deserted roadside, both expressing that they -- it was good to have the prisoner exchange that they had yesterday, 108 Russians who were being detained by Ukraine, who the Russians describable as civilian -- civilian sailors, and others were released. 
 
President Zelensky said that no Ukrainians that are being held by Russia will be forgotten. And said that some of those more than a hundred who were released yesterday, Ukrainians, who were released by Russian authorities, were had been held since before the war began.
 
Many of them were women in military service. So, (Inaudible) typical of what's been going on there have been exchanges, exchanges of bodies, exchanges of prisoners. The fact that the two human rights commissioners were able to meet is indicative that the process of exchange is a little normalized, if you will, but a lot more to be done on both sides.
 
CHURCH:  Indeed. And Salma, we are getting mixed messages on whether Russia's failed conscription of fighters is coming to an end, his partial mobilization. What are you learning about this? 
 
ABDELAZIZ:  Yes. So, President Putin saying last week that that partial mobilization, that very dangerous political decision that he made just a few weeks ago, that partial mobilization should be coming to a close across the country within the next couple of weeks.
 
Moscow, yesterday, the capital of course, reporting that their drafting procedures are complete, that the draft offices are now closed. We know, of course, that that call for 300,000 reservists, that was what the partial mobilization was trying to achieve, 200 -- 220,000 of those rather have already been drafted. So almost done. 
 
But you have to look at the lightning speed of this conscription, Rosemary. In a matter of weeks, you're now taking reservists from their homes and putting them right on the battlefield. We've already heard reports of some of those people losing their lives, and it's been, it's caused quite a huge backlash, of course in Russia. 
 
When the announcement was first made thousands of military age men literally fled for the border, causing an exodus trying to take off on any flights they can, if they could afford it. And now we're seeing that even with this partial mobilization, so far, you've seen very little change on the battlefield. Very little change in terms of the losses that Russia is suffering. 
 <br>[03:10:06]
 
Meanwhile, that backlash, that anger continues on the ground in Russia. Rosemary?
 
CHURCH:  Salma Abdelaziz, Nic Robertson, thank you to you both bringing us up to date on all of those developments. I appreciate it. 
 
Well, CNN chief international correspondent Clarissa Ward was in the Ukrainian capital and heard the blast that rocked Kyiv on Monday. She took to the streets to see the damage left behind.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
CLARISSA WARD, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  A policeman takes aim at the Kamikaze drone as it bears down on Kyiv. Nicknames mopeds in Ukraine because of their distinctive wine, 28 launched toward the city on Monday. The majority are successfully shot out of the sky, but four breakthroughs shattering the early morning calm in the heart of the capital.
 
So, you can see that's the railway station down at the end. The air is thick, with the smell of explosives. 
 
Investigators are already collecting evidence. 
 
Excuse me. 
 
(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
 
WARD:  Excuse me. It's from the drone, yes? UNKNOWN:  Yes.
 
WARD:  Where did you find it?
 
(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
 
WARD:  So, they're saying that's the tailfin from the drone that hit. The target according to Ukrainian authorities, Kyiv's energy infrastructure, but one hits a residential building nearby. It's devastating results. You can see at least one person has been killed. They are taking the body away now. 
 
Rescue workers comb through the smoldering rubble. There have been reports of voices still alive inside. An extraordinarily lucky older woman is rescued from her balcony next door, bundled away to the hospital. 
 
Up until one week ago, the city had been relatively calm. Now Kyiv's mayor says, the Russian's goal is to make life as miserable as possible for civilians as colder weather sets in. 
 
VITALI KLITSCHKO, MAYOR, KYIV, UKRAINE:  The Russian who want to destroy it right now, the critical infrastructure our hometown. Water, electricity, heating. 
 
WARD:  What impact does it have on the psyche of the people of Kyiv that there are kamikaze drones now attacking your capital?
 
KLITSCHKO:  We, everyone is so angry. Everyone wants to defend their families. Want to defend hometown.
 
WARD:  As we prepare to interview a volunteer medic from Sweden, the air raid sirens start up again.
 
UNKNOWN:  Organization called the Swedish rescuers.
 
WARD:  All right, well, you must be used to hearing that sound now. We move to take cover. Three cruise missiles have been reported heading in the direction of Kyiv. This time they are intercepted by Ukraine's air defense. But Kyiv's residents know that there will be more.
 
Clarissa Ward, CNN, Kyiv. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHURCH:  And earlier, I spoke with Malcolm Davis, a senior analyst of defense strategy and capability at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. And I asked him about the latest strikes and Russia's increased use of kamikaze drones.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MALCOLM DAVIS, SENIOR ANALYST, AUSTRALIAN STRATEGIC POLICY INSTITUTE: He's trying to break the will of the Ukrainian people to essentially get them to give up. And accept a negotiated settlement that is on his terms. In other words, he's trying to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. But it's not going to work because the more he attacks the Ukrainian people, the more resolve and brave determination they'll show to actually fight back.
 
So, these sorts of terror attacks, the same sorts of things that the Nazis did in World War II with the London Blitz. The British people never buckled then. The Ukrainian people will not buckle now.
 
CHURCH:  So, OK. So, if his strategy is to break the Ukrainian people and put pressure on the government to back down, make a settlement perhaps, how likely is it that his strategy will work given it's going to be a very cold winter, isn't it? So, what needs to be done to make sure his strategy doesn't work and not just relying on the Ukrainian people, but they've had to, to put up with so much at this point, haven't they? 
 
DAVIS:  Yes, and I think it's a valid point. So, it's, it's more than just bravery and resolve. It's actually, there has to be practical steps taken by the Ukrainian government and also, Western Europe in order to support Ukraine. As you say, it is going to be a cold, bitter winter. 
 <br>[03:14:56]
 
But I do think that the very fact that the Ukrainians have the upper hand militarily on the -- on the ground, that the flow of weapons from the west continues to arrive will reinforce the determination of the Ukrainians to keep going. After all, they are fighting for their very survival. They know full well that if they do undertake negotiated settlement with the Russians, the Russians will demand that they hang onto the supposed annex territories in the Donbas, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson. And the Ukrainian people in those territories will suffer horrendously under Russian brutality. 
 
So, the Ukrainians can't give in as simple as that. They have to continue to fight because they're fighting for their literal survival.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHURCH:  Military analysts Malcolm Davis talking to me last hour with his perspective.
 
Just ahead here on CNN, as nationwide protests against Iran's authoritarian regime keep growing, so too does the list of sanctions against Tehran. 
 
Plus, we will learn more about a group of female fighters who are ready to take on the Iranian regime.
 
We're back in just a moment.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
CHURCH:  Iran has been slapped with more sanctions amid a brutal crackdown against anti-government protests. The E.U. is freezing the assets of 11 people and four entities, including Iran's morality police and information minister for their role in the crackdown. Nationwide Demonstrations erupted after the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody last month, and a human rights group says scores of people have been killed since the protest began.
 
The E.U. says it will always act against serious human rights violations. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOSEP BORRELL, E.U. FOREIGN POLICY CHIEF:  I want to use this opportunity to call on the Iranian government to immediately end the violence to release those detained and to allow normal internet services and flow of information.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH:  The Iranian foreign ministers say the sanctions are based on widespread disinformation.
 
And for more on this, we want to bring in CNN's Nada Bashir who joins us live from London. Good morning to you, Nada. So, what more can you tell us about these E.U. sanctions and of course, what impact they're likely to have. 
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER:  Well, look, Rosemary, these sanctions have been under consideration by E.U. lawmakers for some time now. And of course, they come off the back of sanctions already imposed by both the United States and the United Kingdom on Iranian officials and entities.
 
Now, what we know about these E.U. sanctions is that they are targeting 11 Iranian officials and four entities they believe are in connection to both the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini who of course died in the custody of Iran's notorious morality police after being detained for allegedly wearing a hijab or head scarf incorrectly.
 <br>[03:19:59]
 
And of course, also in relation to the violent and brutal crackdown that we've seen against protestors by the Iranian security forces. And this crackdown has, of course, proved deadly, as you already mentioned there. 
 
We've seen numerous deaths as a result of that crackdown. One human rights organization based in Norway, Iran HR at pegging that death at least 122 based on those protests directly in response to the death of Mahsa Amino, although it is impossible for CNN to independently verify that death toll. 
 
Now amongst the entities and officials sanctioned in this new E.U. sanctions regime are of course the morality police, Iran's law enforcement forces who charged with of course, that brutal crackdown that we have seen over the last few weeks, as well as Iran's information minister who the E.U., as well as other Western allies place responsibility on for the internet shutdown. We have seen in parts of the country, which has been viewed as an attempt to quell the spread of information. It has been quite difficult to get video and information out. We've already seen dozens of journalists and citizen journalists as well being detained at -- in Iran. 
 
But of course, there has been a reaction from the Iranian regime. We've seen criticism in response to U.S. action to UK action. Now, of course, in response to those E.U. sanctions. We heard yesterday from Iran's foreign minister tweeting, down a well-worn path of ineffective sanctions, it is an unconstructed act of miscalculation based on widespread disinformation. Riots and vandalism are not tolerated anywhere. Iran is no exception. 
 
Of course, the Iranian regime has painted the protest that we've seen as riots. It has blamed the U.S. and other foreign actors for the unrest that they've described seeing across the country. But these protests were sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini, driven by women and young girls protesting against the regime's severe restrictions on women's rights.
 
But they have really grown and gained momentum and morphed now into a wider core for reform in Iran and some now even calling for regime change. And in response, human rights organizations have detailed the use of excessive and lethal force by the Iranian security forces. We've already heard from Human Rights Watch with a document signed by 40 human rights organizations calling now for the U.N. Human Rights Council to hold a session on Iran calling for an independent mechanism to investigate those human rights abuses and hold the Iranian regime to account. Rosemary?
 
CHURCH:  All right. Our thanks to Nada Bashir joining us live from London. 
 
And earlier, I asked Iranian women's rights activist Sussan Tahmasebi if the protest in Iran could trigger a social revolution. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SUSSAN TAHMASEBI, IRANIAN WOMEN'S RIGHTS ACTIVIST:  These protests started out demanding justice for the wrongful death of Mahsa Amini in custody, and they centered initially around a demand for women's rights. They've clearly expanded to have much greater demands, political demands, even demands for change in regime. 
 
So, I think that, you know, and many people are calling it a revolution, but it's also being met with incredible violence. So, it -- it's difficult to speculate what will happen. But what has happened is significant because now we see protests across the country that have last. This is the last -- longest lasting continuous protests and people seem determined to continue expressing their frustration and their demand. 
 
And we're seeing things about this protest that are very different. First of all, we see women, women's demands still continue to be central to these protests, but women are participating in great -- in great numbers, and we also see a much younger generation of Iranians participating. This is unprecedented. 
 
These are children over the children of the revolution, and you know, they are demanding very peacefully. They're dissenting. They -- they're, they have peace -- peacefully dissenting and making demands for their own freedom. And they have a clearly a very different vision of their own future, what they want for the future. Then the Islamic Republic of Iran does. 
 
So, regardless of what happens, I think that these protests are significant and what they're calling for is significant, and I think things will never, ever be the same.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHURCH:  Our thanks to Sussan Tahmasebi, an Iranian women's rights activist. 
 
Well, the Kurdish community is among the hardest hit by Tehran's crackdown on dissent. Many of them are fleeing to Iraq, where some are joining armed opposition groups to support protestors inside Iran. 
 
CNN's Nima Elbagir reports from northern Iraq and we do need to warn you, some of the video in her report may be disturbing to watch.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN INTERNATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT:  In a remote area in northern Iraq's Kurdish region, an all-female fighting unit belonging to the armed Kurdish Iranian opposition party PAK, continues to train. 
 
(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
 <br>[03:24:59]
 
ELBAGIR:  These women have been pulled back from the frontline. For the last three weeks the area they patrolled in the northeast of Iraq has been hit by shell sent from across the border by Iran. This unit is part of a larger fighting force for every single one of these women, this war is personal.
 
Rezan (Ph), not her real name, crosses the border from Iran with the help of smugglers just over a week ago. The city of Sanandaj, which she calls home, is in Iran's Kurdish majority western region, and in recent weeks has been likened to a war zone according to its residents as protests have erupted here. 
 
And across Iran after the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish Iranian. Rezan (Ph), just a teenager joined these protests. 
 
UNKNOWN (through translator):  We were treating casualties, but we were also like most people participating in the revolution, in the uprising. Everyone who suffered from the oppression of the Iranian regime came down to the streets and market and defied the government. I was also participating and I had no fear of death.
 
ELBAGIR:  Rezan (Ph) says that while she was dragged by her uncovered hair, she passed prone lifeless bodies, and even after she left, she says she's continued to receive information about people she knows who have died. Like this man. Yahya Rahini (Ph), a newly married 27-year- old murdered by Iranian regime forces for sounding his horn in solidarity with protestors.
 
What is happening with your family? 
 
UNKNOWN (through translator):  My family told them that no matter how many members of my family they arrest, and for as long as they oppress my people, I will not surrender to the invading Iranian government. We are ready to die.
 
ELBAGIR:  When Kurdish Iranian Mahsa Amini died in police custody, her name became a symbol of the oppression of women across Iran. But Mahsa is not her true name. Her Kurdish name is Zhina. A name Iranian authorities barred her family like many other ethnic minority groups from using. The regime only legally registers Persian names. Yet, in her last recorded moments, Zhina resorted to begging her captors in her Kurdish mother tongue. 
 
And treaties which were ignored, reinforcing the fears of Iran's Kurdish minority. Hundreds of Iranian Kurdish families have crossed the border to Iraq seeking refuge from the most recent regime crackdown. But even here, they're not safe. 
 
This family fears the long arm of the Iranian regime after what they saw inside Iran. 
 
UNKNOWN (through translator):  I left after I saw one of my friends killed during the demonstration in Sarkis, near of the mosque, right in front of the mosque. They say they Islamic, but how can they claim to be an Islamic republic when I saw them murdering my friend outside a mosque. 
 
ELBAGIR:  He and his family have every reason to be afraid. Iran's reach to oppress the protest within its borders is stretching far beyond that. Over the last few weeks, Iranian missiles have fallen into the Kurdish region of Iraq almost every day.
 
The onslaught is relentless. This map shows where Iranian strikes have hit killing at least 18 and injuring at least 63 to date. This video filmed by a local television channel shows the moment just after an Iranian drone and several missiles struck one of the Kurdish Iranian opposition party bases, killing eight soldiers and injuring more.
 
On a day on which 70 missiles Kurdish authorities say rained down in the space of just four hours. This base only two years ago was on the front line in the fight against ISIS after PAK received U.S. training. It isn't far from U.S. Central Command CENTCOM forces. Just one day after the attack on the PAK base, CENTCOM shot down another Iranian drone, which appeared, they say as a threat to CENTCOM forces stationed in the area. And as the U.S. anti-ISIS presence in Iraq is set to continue, so is the threat to Iran poses. These female fighters have vowed to fight until there is a regime change in Iran. They say they share Zhina's pain. Called by a name forced on her by a repressive regime. All of them have a Kurdish name, just like her not spoken outside their homes. All of them say it's hard to imagine going back to how life was before.
 <br>[03:30:00]
 
CHURCH:  Gang violence has cut off vital supplies to the people of Haiti, creating a complicated human -- humanitarian crisis. Haitians took to the streets of Port-au-Prince on Monday loudly opposing international help. Some are beginning to starve and run out of water as cholera spreads, but many Haitians blame the international community, claiming they are empowering the gangsters.
 
Despite the resentment, members of the of the United Nations are calling for swift action to help the country. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HELEN RUTH LA LIME, SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE, UN SECRETARY-GENERAL OF HAITI:  A political solution continues to be elusive and on its own is no longer sufficient to address the current crisis. To support patient institutions in their drive for civic order and accountability, and to save thousands of lives that would otherwise be lost.
 
Members of this council must act and decisively so to help address the persistence scourges of insecurity and corruption in Haiti.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH:  The U.S. ambassador to the U.N. proposed a pair of resolutions to cut off finances to Haiti's criminals, and to create an armed international force to directly help Haiti on the ground.
 
Well, she's sorry for the mistakes, but won't be going anywhere. That message from the British prime minister as her new finance minister guts her flagship growth plan. We'll have more on that on the other side of the break. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
CHURCH:  Welcome back, everyone. Well, France is already reeling from a weeks' long oil workers' strike, and in the coming hours things could get a whole lot worse with trade unions calling for a nationwide strike and other sectors as well, including schools and transportation. 
 
They're all demanding higher pay with inflation soaring, and it's posing one of the toughest tests yet for President Emmanuel Macron since his reelection in May. He held a crisis meeting Monday with senior ministers to address the ongoing fuel shortages caused by the strikes at gas refineries. The government has been ordering some employees back to work to ease
 
 the supply crunch, but that's only angered union leaders who believe the right to strike is now in jeopardy.
 <br>[03:34:57]
 
Well, Britain's new finance minister drawing just his fourth day on the job announced he's throwing out nearly all of his predecessors' fiscal plan. Jeremy Hunt said when the interest of economic stability means the government needs to change course it will do so. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JEREMY HUNT, BRITISH FINANCE MINISTER:  We need to do more, more quickly to give certainty to the markets about our fiscal plans and show through action and not just words. In fact, the United Kingdom can and always will pay our way in the world. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH:  The British prime minister has been under huge pressure from investors and other conservative party members ever since her mini budget was unveiled last month. Liz Truss told the BBC that she wanted to lower taxes to help people with their rising energy bills, but admitted that her government went too far too fast.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LIZ TRUSS, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER:  Now I recognize we have made mistakes. I'm sorry, for those mistakes, but I fixed the mistakes. I've appointed a new chancellor. We have restored economic stability and fiscal discipline, and what I now want to do is go on and deliver for the public. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH:  And CNN's Scott McLean is following all of this live from London. He joins us now. Good to see you, Scott. 
 
Another massive U-turn for Prime Minister Liz Truss and another apology, but she is apparently staying put. What's the latest on all of this? 
 
SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, that's right. Look, there is an impression in this country, Rosemary, that Liz Truss is a woman who is not in control of her own government, and yesterday didn't do a whole lot to dispel that notion. It was a bit of a bizarre scenario that played out. 
 
So first you had an urgent question coming from the opposition about the fiscal plans of the government. Liz Truss though wasn't there. She deputized the leader of the House of Commons, Penny Mordaunt, a former leadership rival who went on to assure the House that Truss was not hiding under a desk.
 
Then somewhere during that line of questioning, Liz Truss herself, actually walked into the House of Commons, took a seat behind Penny Mordaunt but then didn't answer any questions herself. Then you have the new Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, step up to the dispatch box, and essentially proceed to scrap nearly everything that was in Liz Truss's now infamous mini budget.
 
That includes now the planned basic income tax cut, the plan cut to dividends tax, the planned income tax cut for the highest earners, the plan to cancel corporate tax hike, and a few other things. All told the government estimates that this will save about $36 million of money that it never actually had in the first place.
 
The markets, they seem to like this. The Major U.K. stock index, the FTSE responded positively to this gaining some ground. The pound also gained some ground against the U.S. dollar as well. It is now almost back to the level that it was when Liz Truss first took office back in the beginning of September.
 
But all of this now leaves Truss in a pretty awkward scenario considering that the primary ideas that she ran on in the leadership contest, which is lowering taxes, and really trying to fuel growth haven't exactly panned out as planned. So, she was asked about this yesterday by the BBC and she pointed to her plan to subsidize energy prices, but even that is only going to survive in its current form now until April.
 
She then tried to explain that, look, fundamentally she still believes in low taxes, high growth, but that now is not exactly the time to do that, which awkwardly is precisely the point that her leadership rival Rishi Sunak was trying to make during that leadership contest. That look, he believes in lower taxes, but given all the debt that the government has ran up during the pandemic, given the war, given energy prices, now is not exactly the time.
 
So, what happens now? Liz Truss's leadership has been described as rudderless as an empty vessel. Some backbench conservative M.P.s are already publicly calling for her to resign, and now her party has to decide whether or not with her polling really showing that she's very unpopular, whether or not they can stick with her till the next general election. Hope that she can right the ship over the next two years, or if they want to rip the Band-Aid off now and try to get a different leader in there, Rosemary.
 
CHURCH:  All right? We'll see what happens. Scott McLean joining us live from London. Many thanks.
 
China is delaying the release of highly anticipated economic data, including its third quarter GDP. The delay -- it comes as China's Communist Party Congress is underway in Beijing this week.
 
And joining me now is CNN's Beijing bureau chief Steven Jiang. Good to see you, Steven. 
 
So why is this delay highly unusual move for China. 
 
STEVEN JIANG, CNN BEIJING BUREAU CHIEF:  Well, Rosemary, because you just don't do this as the world's second largest economy, a long-time growth engine for the whole world. And not to mention when there is a global recession on the horizon. 
 <br>[03:39:58]
 
Now, as you mentioned, it's not just about the GDP figure for the third quarter. It's a whole set of economic indicators, retail sales, industrial output, trade data, and unemployment rate. Now, even though there's no official reason given for the delay, but there's a little doubt, this is all about the ongoing party Congress, which ends on Saturday.
 
So, this kind of move obviously not sending a lot of -- not giving a lot of confidence to investors around the world. It's really reinforcing this notion that in this country politics trumps everything, including the economy. It's a reflection of Xi Jinping's central governing philosophy that the party dominates every aspect of Chinese society.
 
As he reminded the people time and again on Sunday during that speech when he emphasized that the party will continue to make the state sector in this economy bigger, better, and stronger. Now even though he also promised economic renewal growth by focus and innovation, many have long argued innovation has been stifled under him precisely because of his government sweeping crackdown on the private sector, not to mention a large reason for the sharp slowdowns due to his unwavering zero COVID policy.
 
So, in that sense, this delay may not be a surprise because some analysts have already predicted a further decline of the GDP in the third quarter from the previous quarter, and that would make the government's goal of achieving around five and a half percent annual growth this year almost impossible.
 
And so, if these numbers come out and even if they're actually good that that would arouse suspicion about the authenticity and reliability of Chinese economic data. So, either way, from the party's perspective, it's probably going to be a very distracting message and overshadowing this big moment for Xi as he is set to take a precedent breaking third term as the country's top leader.
 
So, from their perspective, the best option right now is just not to release any data at the moment. Rosemary?
 
CHURCH:  All right. Steven Jiang joining us live from Beijing. Many thanks. 
 
Inside the Party Congress, China's leaders may be touting the country's economic progress over the past decade. But outside the gathering on the streets of Beijing, ordinary people say they feel frustrated and hopeless as China's economy falters.
 
CNN's Selina Wang has our report.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SELINA WANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Migrant workers like Mr. Wu (Ph) moved from China's villages to Beijing in search for better job prospects. On a lucky day, he can make the equivalent of a few dozen U.S. dollars from construction work. Anything left over, he sends home to his kids in the village.
 
(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
 
WANG:  He says the pandemic has made it harder to find work, and China's economy is in bad shape because of all the COVID restrictions. The world's growth engine is sputtering. After decades of unstoppable growth, China's economy is cracking. Constant COVID lockdowns wrecking businesses and lives. 
 
He shows us his rental home in Beijing, just four-square meters. It's really small, he says. Since Chinese leader Xi Jinping took power in 2012, he's pledged to reduce income inequality, but workers like Wu (Ph) aren't seeing the benefits. He says, I don't think it's a good idea for him to continue to serve. 
 
SUSAN SHIRK, CHAIR, 21ST CENTURY CHINA CENTER:  I think there are a lot of people in China who have lost confidence in the pragmatic judgment of their leader. It could become a big challenge to Xi Jinping.
 
WANG:  Unemployment is skyrocketing, not just because of the pandemic. China's once vibrant private sector suffocating under Xi Jinping's crackdown to bring companies under tighter communist party control. Beijing insists the moves protect consumers and reduce economic inequality. But instead, mass layoffs are sending youth unemployment to a record high of nearly 20 percent. 
 
Protests also erupted this summer in central China. Thousands of depositors lost access to their savings at several banks in the region. As police violently quashed the protesters, Beijing arrested hundreds of suspects allegedly involved in the scandal and promised that depositors would start to get their money. But many still have not.
 
"This is my family's hard-earned money over the last 20 years," he says "our lives depend on it." 
 
How has this whole experience changed your perception of your country, of China's leaders? "I'm like an aunt that they can trample on. I have no hope," he says. 
 
Another crisis is unfolding in China's all-important property sector. Giant developers have defaulted. Home sales are dropping. Home buyers across the country are boycotting mortgage payments on unfinished homes, fearful that their properties will never get built. 
 <br>[03:44:59]
 
These protestors chant, "evil developer, give back my property."
 
KERRY BROWN, LAU CHINA INSTITUTE DIRECTOR, KING'S COLLEGE LONDON:  So the Chinese property market is probably the world's greatest economic asset, single economic asset. If it does collapse, then we have a full-blown recession, maybe even depression. WANG:  Xi Jinping is preparing to be ruler for life, claiming that his brand of authoritarianism will realize the China dream of strength and prosperity. But for people like Wu (Ph), all he wants is to make ends meet, and even that is a dream out of reach.

CHURCH:  Just ahead, the Indian Supreme Court is taking up a case of gang raped during the 20 -- the 2002 Hindu Muslim riots after the perpetrators were released recently. And we will have a live report from New Delhi.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
CHURCH:  The gang rape case of a pregnant woman during the Hindu Muslim riots in India in 2002 was once again in the spotlight after the 11 men convicted of the crime were prematurely released in August. Bilkis Bano was just 21 years old when she was raped, and 14 of her family members killed, including her three-year-old daughter. And India's Supreme Court has been hearing the case today. 
 
Well, for more on this story, I'm joined by CNN's Vedika Sud in New Delhi. And Vedika, a horrific crime committed 20 years ago now back in the spotlight. So, what -- what do petitioners want to happen right now?
 
VEDIKA SUD, CNN REPORTER:  Rosemary, there are at least two activists and opposition party leader who have petitioned India's top court, and they simply want these 11 convicts to be rearrested. Now, this is going to take some time in the top court of India, which is the Supreme Court because there will be a couple of hearings before a final verdict is reached.
 
Now it's very important to contextualize this entire case. Bilkis Bano like you pointed out earlier has suffered a huge blow. It's a setback in her own words. And what she's hoping is, along with these activists who've petitioned the top court, is that these convicts, the perpetrators of the crime are rearrested.
 
This has happened in the state of Gujarat, which is led by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu Nationalist Party, the party Janata Party. Now the question is, why were these men released? According to what we know, the Supreme Court did recommend that the Gujarat state government look into a plea by one of the convicts who had asked for the premature release based on a state remission policy, after which the state government set up a panel.
 <br>[03:49:55]
 
What's interesting is that most of the people on that panel who were to determine whether or not to prematurely release these convicts belong to the party, Janata Party, the BJP. And that's what these activists have been complaining about. That's what they're challenging in court. Essentially, they want to know through the Supreme Court why has the
 
 state government led by the BJP party in this case, release these men after such a horrific crime committed by them, for which they were convicted and were sentenced to life imprisonment, which in India means like until death in prison. Rosemary?
 
CHURCH:  Indeed, it's a valid question. And just how is Bilkis Bano dealing with this development?
 
SUD:  Like I said, it's been a huge setback, not only to her but to her husband as well. Days after these men were released, which happened on the 75th Independence Day of India on the 15th of August. She did through a lawyer issued statement, Rosemary, where she said that she's been shaken, her feet has been shaken in the justice system of India.
 
She's requested the state government to rearrest these men. We spoke to Yakub Rasul. He is the husband of Bilkis Baro. He has been standing by her through the last two decades ever since this incident has taken place. Here's what he had to tell us. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
YAKUB RASUL, BILKIS BANO'S HUSBAND (through translator):  Bilkis is not just a Muslim's daughter. She represents every Indian's daughter. What has happened to Bilkis should not happen to anyone else.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SUD:  A strong message coming from Bilkis Bano's husband. Remember, in Gujarat there are about 10 percent, the population of the Muslims in Gujarat is about 10 percent, and that state is going to election end of the year. So, a lot of these activists are now questioning whether this was a political move by the Gujarat government. CNN has reached out for a response from the state government, but we haven't received any yet. Rosemary.
 
CHURCH:  All right, Vedika Sud joining us live from New Delhi with that disturbing report.
 
And still to come, the British government is fed up after a string of over-the-top public protest. We will look at what's being proposed to stop the disruptive acts when we return.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
CHURCH:  Activists have ramped our protests across the U.K. with some groups defacing property and even priceless pieces of art to get their message out. But they've also caught the eye of the British government, which is expected to announce new measures to cut down on the disruptive demonstrations. 
 
CNN's Isa Soares reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ISA SOARES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Milk, the latest pantry item to be used by protestors in the U.K. to call attention to a cause they say is being ignored. On Sunday, activists poured milk on the floors of shops around the country, even dousing the meat counter at Harrods with it. The group Animal Rebellion says it organized the stunt to protest the lack of support for farmers and fishing communities from the U.K. government in transitioning to a plant-based future.
 
In recent weeks, climate and environmental protestors have stepped up their shock tactics across the U.K. to get their message out. On Friday, anti-fossil fuel protestors from the Just Stop Oil campaign stunned museum goers at London's National Gallery by throwing tomato soup at Vincent van Gogh's sunflowers painting, and gluing their hands to the wall.
 <br>[03:55:02]
 
UNKNOWN:  Are you more concerned about the protection of a painting or the protection of our planet? 
 
SOARES:  London Police said the protestors were arrested on charges of criminal damage. The museum says the painting is now back on display with only minor damage to the frame. And though the act grabbed plenty of headlines, it's caused mixed reactions.
 
UNKNOWN:  But then, obviously, I was relieved, very relieved that it was protected. And I just think that that they need to choose which things to highlight their causes more. 
 
UNKNOWN:  They could do something a bit more positive, I think, rather than maybe more educational and just make a massive, maybe something that's nice already. 
 
UNKNOWN:  I mean, it's getting people talking about it, which I guess what they want. But then how are you going to get people to listen, you know? Unless you do something drastic.
 
UNKNOWN:  I have climbed up this cable of the QEII Bridge. 
 
SOARES:  Just Stop Oil activists having staging disruptive protests in London for weeks. On Monday, police had to shut down a major bridge because protesters were scaling it. Over the weekend, protesters blocked traffic by laying in the road and at least one activist spray painted an Aston Martin showroom. 
 
U.K. Home Secretary Suella Braverman says protests like these drained police resources, and says she's bringing forward a public order bill that will give authorities more powers to prevent these types of disruptions that are favored by some environmental groups.
 
A plan climate march by activist group Extinction Rebellion also took place in London. And while there was no soup or milks spilled here, the crowd had a similar message about the urgent need for action on climate change.
 
UNKNOWN:  It's so simple to get us off the streets. It's just to act on the climate nature crisis.
 
SOARES:  Isa Soares, CNN, London. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHURCH:  And a climate protest got heated in Rome when activists from the group Last Generation staged a sit-in on a busy road during rush hour. It caused considerable delays on Monday. Angry drivers were seen yelling at the protestors before police eventually came in and carried them off the highway. The activists say they were protesting new gas drilling projects. 
 
And thanks so much for spending part of your day with me. I'm Rosemary Church. CNN Newsroom continues with Max Foster, next.
