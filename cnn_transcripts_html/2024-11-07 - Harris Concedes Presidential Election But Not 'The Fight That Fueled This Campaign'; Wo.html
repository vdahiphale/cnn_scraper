ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN ANCHOR: Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us from all around the world and to everyone streaming us on CNN Max, I'm Rosemary Church. Just ahead, Kamala Harris concedes the race for the U.S. presidency, but not the fight that fueled her campaign. 
 
President elect Trump already has a lengthy to do list when he takes office, we will look at his campaign promises, plus what the second Trump presidency likely means for the war in Ukraine. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Live from Atlanta. This is CNN Newsroom with Rosemary Church. 
 
CHURCH: Good to have you with us. Donald Trump is heading back to the White House where the current president and vice president are pledging something he failed to deliver four years ago, a peaceful transfer of power. Trump's opponent, Kamala Harris, addressed supporters at her alma mater, Howard University in Washington on Wednesday. 
 
She says she spoke with Trump phone to congratulate him on his election victory. President Biden called Trump to invite him to the White House. Harris says she's extremely proud of her presidential campaign, and she revised one of her slogans, when we fight, we win, saying sometimes it takes a little longer. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election, we accept the results. That principle, as much as any other, distinguishes democracy from monarchy or tyranny, and anyone who seeks the public trust must honor it. 
 
At the same time, in our nation, we owe loyalty not to a president or a party, but to the Constitution of the United States. And loyalty to our conscience and to our God. My allegiance to all three is why I am here to say while I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHRUCH: More now from CNN's Jeff Zeleny. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Vice President Kamala Harris delivering a concession speech a day after losing a landslide election to former President Donald Trump. After a day of phone calls, including speaking with Mr. Trump and President Biden, she delivered a speech at Howard University addressing her supporters. 
 
HARRIS: While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign. The fight, the fight for freedom, for opportunity, for fairness and the dignity of all people. A fight for the ideals at the heart of our nation, the ideals that reflect America at our best. That is a fight I will never give up.
 
ZELENY: Harris saying it's a fight she will not give up. But the question is how she will proceed. She has 75 more days in the Office of Vice President. So of course that gives her time to really focus on her day job as well as think about what is next. 
 
For all the recriminations that Democrats will be doing poring over these election results, too much focus on abortion rights, perhaps not enough focus on the actual economy. Did President Biden stay in the race too long? On Thursday, President Biden will address the nation in the Rose Garden, of course, speaking to many of these. But it was Harris who talked to young supporters and others about what they should do going forward. 
 
HARRIS: To the young people who are watching, it is OK to feel sad and disappointed, but please know it's going to be okay. On the campaign, I would often say when we fight, we win. But here's the thing. Here's the thing. Sometimes the fight takes a while. That doesn't mean we won't win. That doesn't mean we won't win. 
 
ZELENY: Now, Harris did pledge to help President Elect Trump through his transition, saying that she and her supporters will ensure a peaceful transition of power. 
 <br>[01:05:03]
 
Of course, that did not happen four years ago. There is no doubt the Democratic Party is in a soul searching period. The question what role does Harris have to play in that? Those answers will come in the future weeks. Jeff Zeleny, CNN, Washington. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHURCH: And the next few weeks are important for Donald Trump as he and his transition team prepare for a return to the White House. Sources say the president elect spent Wednesday taking calls from world and business leaders and meeting donors at Mar a Lago. No word yet on whether those talks include plans to make good on promises made on the campaign trail. CNN's Kristen Holmes takes us through the list. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): President elect Donald Trump already has a lengthy to do list. 
 
DONALD TRUMP, U.S. PRESIDENT ELECT: Promises made, promises kept. We're going to keep our promises. 
 
HOLMES (voice-over): Promises he made during his campaign, starting with immigration. 
 
TRUMP: We've got to have the largest mass deportation effort in history. We're going to going forward, the future children of illegal aliens will not receive automatic U.S. Citizenship. 
 
HOLMES (voice-over): Vowing to immediately go after millions of undocumented immigrants. Calling for a ban on sanctuary cities, a death penalty for human traffickers, and to reinstate his travel ban on people entering the U.S. from predominantly Muslim countries. 
 
TRUMP: I will send Congress a bill to ban sanctuary cities in the first day that I become president. I will immediately restore and expand the Trump travel ban on entry from tariff plague countries. 
 
HOLMES (voice-over): On the economy.
 
TRUMP: Tariffs are the greatest thing ever invented. 
 
HOLMES (voice-over): Trump has promised massive tariffs on foreign goods despite economists saying American consumers are likely to pay the price, as well as ending and cutting specific taxes. 
 
TRUMP: My plan will massively cut taxes for workers and small businesses. And we will have no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on Social Security benefits for our seniors. 
 
HOLMES (voice-over): Trump has claimed he could end the conflict in the Middle East and the Russia-Ukraine war immediately. 
 
TRUMP: We're going to take care of Israel and they know that. I will stop the chaos in the Middle East and I will Prevent World War II from happening. Before I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after we win the presidency, we win the presidency, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine totally settled. 
 
HOLMES (voice-over): While not offering any explanation of how he's made commitments on changing the education system.
 
TRUMP: On day one, I will sign an executive order banning schools from promoting critical race theory or transgender insanity. And I'm going to close the Department of Education and move education back to the states. HOLMES (voice-over): Trump has also promised to go after his perceived
 
 political enemies. 
 
TRUMP: For those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution. I will appoint a real special prosecutor to go after the most corrupt president in the history of the United States of America, Joe Biden and the entire Biden crime family.
 
HOLMES (voice-over): Including firing special counsel Jack Smith. 
 
TRUMP: I would fire him within two seconds. 
 
HOLMES (voice-over): Trump has also made promises to those prosecuted for their actions on January 6th. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Will you pardon the January 6th rioters who were convicted of federal offenses? 
 
TRUMP: I am inclined to pardon many of them. I can't say for every single one because a couple of them probably they got out of control. 
 
HOLMES (voice-over): And while unlike some other Republicans, Trump has stated he doesn't want a national abortion ban. 
 
TRUMP: No, I'm not in favor of abortion ban, but it doesn't matter because this issue has now been taken over by the states. 
 
HOLMES (voice-over): His administration could implement new restrictions without passing a federal law. Kristen Holmes, CNN, West Palm Beach, Florida. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHURCH: And we go to Los Angeles now and Michael Genovese, the president of the Global Policy Institute of Loyola Marymount University. Great to have you with us. 
 
MICHAEL GENOVESE, POLITICAL ANALYST: Thank you, Rosemary. 
 
CHURCH: So the polls got it wrong again. How did Donald Trump pull off this shocking victory over rival Kamala Harris, even winning the popular vote? 
 
GENOVESE: Well, you know, amazingly, and I think we should give Donald Trump a great deal of credit for this. In spite of being convicted 34 felonies, being found liable for sexually assaulting a woman, fraud cases against him, and of course, orchestrating the January 6 violent insurrection against the Capitol where he was trying to overthrow a Democratic election. That's a mouthful. 
 
Donald Trump, Phoenix like, rose from the political ashes and easily won his party's nomination. And in a struggle, he won the presidency. He was again underestimated. The polls kind of underrepresented where his support was and he managed to win a change election. 
 <br>[01:10:06] American voters are again angry voters, and they want change. Two- thirds of the public has said they are unhappy with the direction the country is going in. 74 percent of the people who voted said they wanted change. And Donald Trump became the change candidate against the status quo Biden administration represented by Kamala Harris. And so for voters who are hungry for change, Donald Trump was the choice. 
 
CHURCH: So was there anything Kamala Harris could have done better? And why do you think it went so terribly wrong for her, particularly with the blue wall turning red, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, or with Democratic governors voting instead for her Republican rival, Donald Trump, as they did back in 2016? 
 
GENOVESE: Well, you know, hindsight is 20. And when you think about it, perhaps there is little that she could have done. She was swimming against the tide. She was wedded to the Biden policies and the Biden administration, and she was not able to break free from that. 
 
And in a change election, to be portrayed as the representative, the sort of poster child for the status quo, she had very little chance. And so she had little time to run and to define herself, to introduce herself and to make her case. And that was a function of circumstances. And she was always fighting an uphill battle. And she just never was able to capture the zeitgeist or the romance of the election. 
 
She was always a step behind, always trying to climb up out of a hole that was already dug for her when she stepped into this race. 
 
CHURCH: And Michael, critics fear that a second Trump presidency won't have the necessary guardrails needed in the way of advisers and cabinet members willing to push back on Trump's worst instincts. So what might this mean in terms of what he has planned for his first 100 days in office with such a powerful mandate? 
 
GENOVESE: Well, you know, even with his powerful mandate, even with control of the House, and it looks like both the House and the Senate will be in Republican hands, it's never really smooth sailing. Donald Trump will, however, at the very beginning, use a lot of executive orders. He'll use the unilateral or executive authority of the president to sign executive orders into law. 
 
You heard in the preliminary report all the things he wants to do, many of which he wants to do on day one, he'll be able to do a lot of those through executive orders. But the gold standard remains legislation. And if he wants real reform, if he wants reform at the border, immigration reform, if he wants to do a lot of the things he says he wants to do, he's got to go through Congress. Legislation is the gold standard. He's going to be able to get some things through Congress, but it's not going to be as smooth or easy as he thinks. 
 
CHURCH: And what are the global implications of a second Trump presidency, do you think? 
 
GENOVESE: Well, Rosemary, that sound you hear is the sound of alarm bells going off in capitals all over the world, especially in Europe. You know, it raises a lot of questions. And it's almost like the Jack Nicholson character. You know, he's back. Europe and the world are wondering what's going to happen? Is he going to be like he was four years ago? Has he grown? Has he matured? He's 78 years old. And there are a lot of fears and a lot of questions. What's going to happen to NATO? 
 
Trump tried to undermine it when he was president. Biden tried to rebuild it. Is Trump going to try to undermine it again? What's going to happen with Ukraine? He says he's going to come up with a solution right away, probably at great cost to Ukraine. 
 
And, you know, Donald Trump has had this fascination with an admiration for Putin for years. Is Putin going to be the puppeteer? And will Donald Trump be the puppet in a lot of those respects? And what about the U.S. as an ally? Are we going to be a reliable ally? We already saw that Donald Trump is very casual about national classified papers, that there were classified documents left all over his resort in Mar-a-Lago. 
 
So a lot of intelligence services may be reluctant to share intelligence with us. And then don't let's get started on the tariff wars. And so it's going to be a case of Donald Trump is going to be running with scissors and the world is going to be cut up a little bit. 
 
Donald Trump is a disruptor and the global community likes, needs and probably wants a little bit of stability. 
 
CHURCH: The world is watching closely. Michael Genovese, many thanks for joining us. Appreciate it. 
 
GENOVESE: Thank you, Rosemary. 
 
CHURCH: And we are following reaction to Donald Trump's win from around the world. In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is calling it a huge victory. CNN's Matthew Chance has more on the reaction from Israel and across the Middle East. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: History's greatest comeback. That's how the Israeli prime minister described Donald Trump's win, issuing a gushing congratulations just minutes after he declared victory.
 <br>[01:15:00]
 
In his post, Benjamin Netanyahu said Trump's return offers a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America. Ahead of the vote, though Israeli opinion polls had overwhelmingly favored a Trump presidency, the Biden administration, including Vice President Harris, is seen here as having sought to restrain Israel's military action in the aftermath of the October 7 attacks. 
 
But Trump's presidency, on the other hand, is remembered for a series of pro-Israel moves, like the relocation of the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem from a second Trump term. Israelis are hoping for even more full throated support for its actions in Gaza, in Lebanon and the wider region. 
 
Trump has said he wants to bring lasting peace. But across the Middle East, his election victory has been greeted with trepidation. A spokesperson for the Iranian state insisting that the Trump presidency will make no significant difference to them. 
 
But amid a spiraling confrontation with Israel, the possibility of even firmer U.S. support for the Jewish state is likely to be a major concern for Tehran. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHURCH: And European leaders know how tricky it will be to have a stable relationship with the U.S. with Donald Trump at the helm. As they congratulate Trump, they are emphasizing the existing bonds between the U.S. and their countries. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen says, quote, the E.U. and the U.S. are more than just allies. We are bound by a true partnership between our peoples. She is urging them to continue to work together. And Italy's hard right prime minister says Italy and the United States are sister nations. Here's what Germany's chancellor says. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
OLAF SCHOLZ, GERMAN CHANCELLOR (through translator): The European Union must stand closely together and act as one. As German chancellor, I work towards that. Today I had an exchange with President Macron. Tomorrow we will meet other heads of states and governments in Budapest. We will closely align ourselves there and continue with that in the weeks to come. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: More European reaction now from CNN's Saskia Van Dorn in Paris. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SASKIA VAN DORN, CNN SENIOR PRODUCER: A much needed victory for the world was how Hungary's far right Prime Minister Viktor Orban described President Donald Trump's victory. 
 
Meanwhile, here in France, faced with a US President focused on an America first foreign policy, French President Emmanuel Macron pledged to work for a stronger, more united Europe. A nod, perhaps to one of Europe's greatest concerns right now, collective security. 
 
TRUMP: Look, if they're not going to pay. We're not going to protect, OK? 
 
VAN DORN: Trump has been critical of European defense spending and of NATO even once threatening to leave the alliance. He said that he will bring the war to Ukraine to an end in 24 hours if elected. But many fear that will mean withdrawing support for Ukraine and looking to settle the conflict on Russia's terms. 
 
Also in line with his America first policy, Trump has threatened tariffs across the board that could be very damaging to European trade, particularly for the likes of car manufacturers. Climate change, a topic close to people's hearts here in Paris, is another concern. 
 
Trump pulled out of the Paris Climate Agreement during his last term in office and could now roll back environment protection measures, making it hard to sustain a long term international effort. 
 
But there are some European leaders who believe that being sidelined by the U.S. might not be such a bad thing, with the hope that Europe may learn to be stronger and more autonomous as it's forced to fend for itself. While some welcome Trump's populist approach, there are fears that he could invigorate far right political movements like those of Viktor Orban. Saskia Van Dorn, CNN, Paris. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHURCH: Now for a look at how Trump's big win is being covered by some prominent publications. Britain's Guardian newspaper with the very succinct head American Dread. The New Statesman has put Trump's face on the Statue of Liberty and reads Trump Takes America, a special issue on a crushing victory and a new political era. And the magazine Vanity Fair tells the story with numbers. 34 felony counts, one conviction, two cases pending, two impeachments, six bankruptcies and four more years. The 47th president. 
 
With a second Trump presidency on the horizon, our correspondents lay out what this means for parts of Asia. We're live in Seoul and Beijing next. 
 
Plus, Trump campaigned on across the board tariffs to boost the U.S. economy, but American consumers are likely to pay the higher prices. A look at the economic impact later this hour. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[01:23:05]
 
CHURCH: Welcome back, everyone. Well, the obligatory congratulations from world leaders to Donald Trump have been pouring in as they try to assess the upcoming impact of his return to the White House. CNN's Mike Valerio is standing by in Seoul, but we begin with our Beijing bureau chief, Steven Jiang. 
 
So, Steven, what's been the reaction from China? 
 
STEVEN JIANG, CNN BEAIJING BUREAU CHIEF: Yes. Rosemary, unlike four years ago, Xi Jinping didn't wait more than two weeks this time to offer his congratulations to the winner of this U.S. race. 
 
Now, he picked up the phone and called Trump rather quickly, offering him not only congratulations for the election, but also the usual platitudes you would expect from Beijing in terms of mutual respect, win-win cooperation, and seeing the two men could chart a course for the two countries to get along in a new era. 
 
Now, the timing and the content of this phone call in a way indicates the Chinese may have learned something from Trump's first term in office in terms of how he operates and his personality, because Trump and his advisers are reportedly tracking very closely when and how world leaders reach out to him after his election win. 
 
But for many Chinese officials, according to our sources, though, they are still very much haunted by the wild swings in Trump's China policy during his first term in office and the resulting nightmares they had to live through, so many of them understandably dreading the prospect of having to deal with this all over again. 
 
As of now, though, the only certainty seemed to be Trump going back to the White House in this picture full of uncertainties when it comes to this relationship. And the stakes cannot be higher because this is the relationship between the between two superpowers, between the world's two biggest economies. That indeed is top of the minds for many officials and the Chinese public alike. 
 
That is the potential economic and trade a conflict between the two sides because of the campaign rhetoric by Trump in terms of slapping new, even bigger 60 percent tariffs on Chinese imports. 
 <br>[01:25:10]
 
Now, there is no way of telling whether or not he's going to follow through this promise, but the Chinese are taking him seriously because of the track record. And the worry here is this time around the semantics state. Beijing feels like they're not going to take this line down. They are tired of being the punching bag of American politicians and they think even with a sluggish economy at a home, they have enough measures in their toolbox to fight back. And that, of course, could have a devastating effect for not just the Chinese and U.S. economies, but the world at large. 
 
And the other side of the coin, of course, is Trump has perceived the transactional nature and his America first, going it alone approach. And foreign policy is still seen beneficial to China strategically compared to the Biden and Harris administration's strategy of forming a united front against China on multiple fronts. Rosemary. 
 
CHURCH: Steven Jiang in Beijing, many thanks for that live report. South Korea has a lot invested in its relationship with the U.S. and its next leader. And CNN's Mike Valerio is live in Seoul. So, Mike, what's been the reaction from South Korea to a Trump win? 
 
MIKE VALERIO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: There's a lot of warm greetings, Rosemary. You can certainly feel that from the news conferences this morning, from the messages on X and social media. But there is an undercurrent of nervousness because as you mentioned, there is a lot on the line for South Korea and the Korean peninsula, two buckets that we want to talk about when we're looking at a future Trump administration. 
 
First of all, could South Korea pay more to house U.S. troops on the Korean peninsula? That's bucket number one. And then bucket number two, looking squarely at North Korea, could there be another summit between President elect Trump and Kim Jong Un? What would that look like if it even happens at all? 
 
So when we're talking about troops, we're right now there are about 28,500 American troops stationed in South Korea as a counterweight to China from the American point of view, and also as a security guarantee for South Korea against North Korea from the American point of view, regional stability right here.
 
South Korea pays about a billion dollars annually for those troops. President-elect Trump, though, saying in Chicago only a few days ago, Rosemary, that he wants a 900 percent increase from $1 billion, $1.1 billion to $10 billion. He thinks that South Korea can be paying more. 
 
So when we're looking farther into the future, a potential summit again with Trump and Kim Jong Un, unfinished business. September 10, I had the opportunity in the Seoul area to talk to Robert O'Brien. He was Trump's last national security adviser. He could become secretary of state under a Trump 2.0 administration. 
 
And he said they certainly are looking to reengage with North Korea. He personally met with North Korean diplomats in Stockholm in the autumn of 2019. Listen to what he told us. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ROBERT O'BRIEN, FORMER U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: They took a very hard line publicly after the meetings. But we thought that September meeting, it was September, October, I believe, of 2019. We thought that meeting would lead to something, maybe another summit in the spring. But then unfortunately COVID hit and the whole world changed, and especially in North Korea with the total unbelievable lockdown in North Korea. So we lost that opportunity. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VALERIO: So they are looking to reengage. But, Rosemary, would North Korea in turn, want to reengage. Because as we've talked to you on your shows so many times over the summer and into this autumn, North Korea is now saying, Rosemary, hey, we are a nuclear state and we're going to stay that way. We don't want to change. So it could be much harder to reengage with North Korea under a second Trump administration. Rosemary. 
 
CHURCH: All right, thanks to Mike Valerio in Seoul with that live report. And coming up, Ukraine is hoping the new Trump administration will continue supporting its fight against the Russian invasion. But if the past is anything to go on, the future is unpredictable. Back with that and more in just a moment. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [01:32:34] 
 
CHURCH: Welcome back everyone. Vice President Kamala Harris says she is committed to a peaceful
 
 transfer of power after conceding the U.S. presidential election to Donald Trump on Wednesday. 
 
In a speech at her alma mater Howard University, Harris did something her opponent refused to do after the 2020 election -- accept the results. Harris said she had spoken with Trump and congratulated him on his victory. 
 
She also acknowledged the pain of her loss while offering supporters a positive message, encouraging them to fight in a much different way than a defeated presidential candidate did four years ago. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The outcome of this election is not what we wanted, not what we fought for, not what we voted for. But hear me when I say, hear me when I say the light of America's promise will always burn bright as long as we never give up and as long as we keep fighting.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: Meanwhile, it is full steam ahead for team Trump. The president-elect declared victory early Wednesday in West Palm Beach, Florida where his transition team has already started setting up offices and meeting with candidates to fill administration roles. 
 
They're also working quickly to set up meetings with world leaders like Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. His office says he was one of the first to congratulate Trump on his victory. 
 
One phone call Trump probably won't receive is from Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin says he has no plans to congratulate Trump while the U.S. continues to aid Ukraine in its war effort. 
 
Well, Trump's election win could have a huge impact in Ukraine though it's not yet clear what that impact will be. Ukraine's president is hoping to stay on Trumps good side by offering a swift congratulations. 
 
CNN's Nick Paton Walsh has details.
 <br>[01:34:47]
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's team trying to put, I think, as brave a face as they can upon the victory of President Donald Trump, which is pretty clearly going to mark a stark change in U.S. policy towards Ukraine judging by the repeated public statements we've heard from Trump himself. 
 
Now in a tweet, Zelenskyy on X.com said that he wanted to appeal essentially to the "peace through strength element" of Donald Trump, suggesting that Donald Trump would not want to cede ground or be keen to see Ukraine move towards what he called a just peace, referring to a conversation they've had in September where he said they discussed Ukraine's victory plan.
 
Now, I should point out here that, you know, we've heard Donald Trump say that he could end the war in 24 hours, not specifying how, referring to Zelenskyy as being an extraordinary salesman who seems to be able to walk away with $100 billion, I paraphrase here, each time he addresses Congress. 
 
Skeptical, it's fair to say, of the amount of money that's been given to Ukraine to aid its defense, without which, frankly, it would have had very little chance against Russia's invasion in February 2022. 
 
So many of Trumps team as well, skeptical of that continued assistance and thinking that money would be better spent in the United States. That is no secret at all. 
 
Neither is it a secret that Trump has for a long time seemed, for reasons that have often been hard to fathom, keen to not offend Russian President Vladimir Putin, to keep as it were in his better books. 
 
And so we're into an exceptionally dangerous time here for Ukraine's government. Even before Trump's victory, there were bad signs on the battlefield that Russia was strategically in the ascendant in key areas along the eastern front line taking villagers that put them into a very good tactical position for the cold winter months ahead often when Moscow escalates its offensive campaign.
 
Moscow now potentially with 8,000 North Korean troops at their disposal in the Kursk region, according to U.S. Secretary of [overtalking]z, who hinted last week they'd be getting into combat likely in the days ahead so potentially already now. 
 
And so Russia's news from the front line continually good. Its news in Washington as of 24 hours ago significantly better. And the possibility that that utterly vital aid to Ukraine will begin to dry up.
 
And frankly, it's important to remember that regardless of what policy Donald Trump actually picks, the gap now, the two to three months of uncertainty will be wreaking havoc on Ukraine's morale. They're already in a very difficult spot. 
 
And I recall back in December 2023, when Congress held up aid for only six months, in the end, you know, it slowed down. It never really stopped coming. 
 
The damage that did to Ukraine's morale on the front lines then something similar is likely to begin to happen now. And it comes at a time, as I say, when Moscow is seeing real progress on the front lines. 
 
So stark policy choices for the new occupant of the White House ahead and likely stark change for Ukraine's government in that conflict. Now heading towards its fourth year. 
 
Nick Paton Walsh, CNN -- London.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHURCH: Joining us now, CNN global affairs analyst Kim Dozier. Good to have you with us as we work through our post-election analysis.
 
KIM DOZIER, CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: Yes, good to be here. It's an interesting time. 
 
CHURCH: It certainly is. And of course, we don't know yet what President-elect Donald Trump will actually do when it comes to foreign policy. But we do know what he hopes to do. 
 
So let's start with Ukraine. Donald Trump has said he will end the war there. How will he likely do that? How much of Ukraine will he likely cede to Russia in a deal with President Vladimir Putin to end this war? And what would be the likely consequences for Ukraine.
 
DOZIER: Well, Trump has said he'd end the war in 24 hours. And from some of the Trump campaign officials and advisers, I've spoken to, the plan would likely be to put pressure on Moscow via Moscow's oil sales to get it to stop the war against Ukraine. 
 
But that doesn't mean that Ukraine would get its territory back. Ukraine would likely have to give up Crimea, large parts of the Donbas, anywhere that Russian troops are right now. At least that is the picture that Donald Trump apparently is seeing for the future. 
 
The problem is Kyiv doesn't just say yes to what Donald Trump wants. It's got some agency here. And so does the European Union. European nations that see Russia's threat to Ukraine as just a precursor to a threat of taking territory in other parts of Europe. 
 
So what we could see is the E.U., the European Union, try to step in with its own aid plan to offer Kyiv some options so that it doesn't feel coerced into this deal that the Trump administration will be cooking up in the first likely weeks of their administration. 
 <br>[01:39:56]
 
DOZIER: But it's going to be messy. It's going to be really messy. 
 
CHURCH: And President-elect Trump has also warned Europe in the past that the United States would not come to its aid if it came under attack. And he has even threatened to withdraw from NATO. 
 
How far might he go with all these threats and what would be the consequences for Europe?
 
DOZIER: Well, the feeling among some of his advisers and the European officials who dealt with him in the past was that a lot of this was saber rattling to get the various NATO members to pay up to invest 2 percent of their GDP per capita in defense. Now, the majority of NATO nations are on the way to doing that. And in
 
 the past, NATO secretary Jens Stoltenberg, the now-retired NATO general secretary, had told me he thought that Trump's saber rattling worked by getting many of these countries scared enough to start to invest in their own defense. 
 
That said, European officials I've spoken to are dreading a second Trump administration because they say you never know what he's going to do. 
 
CHURCH: And Kim, what about the wars raging in the Middle East? Donald Trump recently told Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu to do whatever he needed to do when it came to Gaza, Lebanon and Iran. What could that mean for the Middle East going forward? And what solution would he bring to the table to bring peace to that region?
 
DOZIER: Well, that's part of the perplexing thing here when you hear that Arab and Muslim Americans in places like Michigan say that they voted for Trump because the Biden administration hadn't been tough enough on Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israelis. 
 
The Biden administration did things like slapping sanctions on settler groups. The Trump administration in the past had a policy of -- well, they recognized Israels capital as Jerusalem, something that was supposed to be decided in peace talks with Palestinians on a two-state solution at some point in the future.
 
The Trump administration has in the past backed basically whatever Netanyahu has said is necessary. So while Trump has reportedly said that he wants this war in Gaza wrapped up quickly, he hasn't said anything about, would he accept Netanyahu's plans to, for instance, stay there occupy the territory. 
 
Parts of Trump's advisor team have said things like the Palestinians in Gaza should be moved out. This is not a good sign of things to come for the Palestinians on the ground in Gaza or the Palestinians in the West Bank. 
 
CHURCH: And Kim, you mentioned that Arab Americans have been talking publicly about their support for Donald Trump. Do they understand what that would mean for Palestinians?
 
DOZIER: It seems like there's been a real memory lapse of what the Trump administration did the first time around. And, you know, a lot of the officials that advised Trump, the first time around have been at places like Heritage, and just waiting to come back into the administration. 
 
They are not believers in a two-state solution. Trump hasn't ruled out a two-state solution, but he said things like it would be very tough to do. And I don't think you're going to get pressure from Trump to support the Palestinian aspirations for independence.
 
So I just am baffled by the fact that many Arab Americans didn't remember that. And don't foresee the grim reality that could be coming in the next four years for them. CHURCH: Kim Dozier, thank you so much for talking with us. Appreciate
 
 it. 
 
DOZIER: Thank you. 
 
CHURCH: Still ahead, the economy was the top issue for many U.S. voters, but analysts say Trump's plan for new tariffs could undo the progress against inflation and drive up prices. 
 
We will break it down, that's next.

CHURCH: U.S. stocks soared to record highs on Wednesday following Donald Trump's victory. Markets were mostly boosted by the fact that the election was decided relatively quickly as investors desire certainty. 
 
The Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq all reached new highs. The Dow surged more than 1,500 points, or more than 3.5 percent. The S&amp;P climbed by 2.5 percent, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq closed nearly 3 percent higher. 
 
The record day on Wall Street comes despite economists' warnings that many of Trumps policies could increase inflation and America's budget deficit. 
 
Well, Trump has said he will impose a tariff on all goods coming into the U.S., as well as higher tariffs on imports from China and Mexico.
 
He claims the tariffs will boost American manufacturing and bring in billions of dollars to help pay for tax cuts and other policy initiatives, but it's unlikely the revenue from new tariffs would fully cover his proposals and tariffs would likely raise prices for the average American. 
 
CNN's Vanessa Yurkovich explains.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
VANESSA YURKOVICH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Imagine everything you buy that comes from outside the us, like wine, cheese and laptops get more expensive. 
 
Well, that's what economists say would happen under former President Trump's tariff proposal. A tariff is basically a tax on products and Trump wants to put them on everything that comes into the U.S. 
 
That's $3 trillion worth of goods a year. In order to cover the higher tariffs companies will have to raise prices and that cost ultimately gets passed down to you, the consumer. 
 
So here's his plan. A 60 percent tariff on Chinese imports and up to 20 percent on imports from other countries. Trump says it will protect working-class jobs and punish countries making goods with cheap labor in unsafe conditions.
 
The self-proclaimed tariff man is hoping the tariffs will incentivize Americans to buy more made in America products, and the tariffs could in theory, raise trillions of dollars to help fund tax cuts. 
 
But economists at Goldman Sachs warn the tariffs could backfire, instead raising prices on American families, killing jobs and setting off another trade war. 
 <br>[01:49:47]
 
YURKOVICH: Countries could then retaliate, putting their own tariffs on U.S. goods that they buy. The cost to the average American family, by one estimate, more than $2,600 per year.

POORNIMA MURALI, CNN NEWS 18: There is a sense of disappointment here at Thulasendrapuram which is the ancestral village of Kamala Harris. They offered special prayers and pujas over the last 24 hours, hoping that Kamala Harris wins. 
 
But now there's a sense of disappointment that we can see here. Jumam, you've come from the U.S. on a visit to India. And you were at Thulasendrapuram trying to get a sense and mood of how -- and associate yourself with Kamala Harris and rooting for Kamala Harris. But now Trump has finally won. How do you see this result? 
 <br>[01:54:52]
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Well obviously, I'm very disappointed. I anticipate Kamala being a part of the political process in the United States regardless of this loss. 
 
But let's talk about the loss. Is it really? I mean she, you know, has enjoyed a beautiful upraising in the United States as an immigrant. It's a beautiful story. 
 
So it can't be -- it can't be all bad. 
 
MURALI: What is your message to Kamala Harris now that she's lost? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes. I would say thank you for trying to unite the country. Thank you for all the beautiful things that you've said to do so. And I hope to see you in politics for a very long time. You're very capable leader. 
 
That's what I would tell her.
 
MURALI: She had, in fact, traveled to Thulasendrapuram and she stayed here for a day, uh, to be a part of the U.S. elections and knowing that Thulasendrapuram is Kamala Harris' ancestral village, her maternal grandfather, P.V. Gopalan had stayed here a century ago. She had come here to witness the mood here, the celebrations here. 
 
Unfortunately, Kamala Harris lost.

CHURCH: Hurricane Rafael is now moving away from Cuba after battering the island on Wednesday. It crashed to shore as a Category 3 storm but has since weakened to Category 2 as it enters the Gulf of Mexico.
 
The storm caused Cuba's power grid to crash and is the fifth major hurricane in the Atlantic this year. Rafael has winds of nearly 170 kilometers per hour. 
 
It's not quite clear where it will end up but it's expected to turn to the west and slowdown in the coming days. It could make landfall anywhere from the U.S. Gulf Coast to northeastern Mexico. 
 
I want to thank you so much for your company. I'm Rosemary Church.
