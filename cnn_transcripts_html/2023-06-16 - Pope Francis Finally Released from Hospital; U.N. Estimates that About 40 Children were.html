KIM BRUNHUBER, CNN ANCHOR: Hello and welcome to all of you watching us around the world. I'm Kim Brunhuber. 
 
Ahead on "CNN Newsroom." Nine crew members of a migrant boat that sank off the coast of Greece are now under arrest, according to authorities. What investigators say about the chance of finding more survivors. 
 
Microsoft founder Bill Gates meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing. It's Gates' first trip to Beijing since 2019. 
 
And Pope Francis has just been released from hospital. We'll go live to Rome for an update. 
 
UNKNOWN (voice-over): Live from CNN Center. This is "CNN Newsroom" with Kim Brunhuber. 
 
BRUNHUBER: Pope Francis has just been released from Gemelli Hospital in Rome where he was greeted by throngs of well-wishers. The Pontiff had been recovering from last week's abdominal surgery and he has a busy schedule planned for the summer. 
 
Let's go to contributor Barbie Nadeau outside the hospital in Rome right now. So Barbie, you were in the crowd there as the Pope emerged. Take us through what happened, what was the reception like? 
 
BARBIE NADEAU, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Yeah, you know, there was just so much excitement, both on the part of the media, from global media there, and from the part of the people who wanted to just get a glimpse of the Holy Father. There was some pushing, there were questions, there were people that were just trying, you know, holding out rosaries, things like that, hoping that just by his passing by would offer a blessing. Such applause, such joy to see the Holy Father, to see Pope Francis, 86 years old, come out of the hospital after 10 days. You know, what's hugely important in this is we didn't see a picture
 
 of the Pope until yesterday, a lot of people wondering just how he was really doing. He had a three -- underwent a three-hour surgery last Wednesday. Last Tuesday, surprise visit to this hospital behind me, the Gemelli Hospital here in Rome. 
 
Last Wednesday, we're told he underwent this three-hour surgery that went well. We said, but we hadn't heard it or seen anything. Then all of a sudden Thursday yesterday, we get pictures of him visiting the Pediatric Oncology Ward. We get pictures of him, you know, in fine form, told he's getting out of the hospital this morning. Now, we were told that would be sometime this morning. He's an early riser, didn't want to waste any time. He was out of here around 8 a.m. local time. 
 
And you know, the crowds had gathered. A lot of the people were here just because they were here for medical reasons, were here visiting patients and friends and family members, lots of doctors, nurses, so many people in the crowd. But there were also people who knew he was getting out today that came and just wanted to show their support. He's an incredibly inspirational man to so many people, Catholics and non-Catholics alike, and to see him recovered. 
 
Now, going back to the Vatican where we're expected he'll rest a little bit more before he has these grueling trips scheduled for August but he also has a couple of private meetings scheduled for next week. So, we're going to be watching closely. 
 
You know, this is a pope you just can't keep down. He wants to keep on the job and we were told he was working even hours after he came out of the surgery, Kim. 
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah, it looked like a crazy chaotic situation there as we see the crowds greeting him as he was coming out. Were you surprised at just how many people were there and how close the crowds were to the pontiff as he was wheeled out? 
 
NADEAU: Well, you know, you can't underestimate the amount of security there was. You know, the people who were allowed to sit along that and stand along that perimeter were accredited media or they were people who the security people had vetted. There was a lot of security there. You know, they'll stop traffic so that he can get back to the Vatican, which is about a half an hour drive from here. You know, there were a lot of security people within that crowd.
 
So you know, this is a major hospital in Rome and not just anyone was allowed. But we saw a lot of patients. We saw a lot of people who were standing out of their windows trying to get a glimpse of him, looking at him. Again, you know, this is an incredibly inspirational man to so many people. And to see a man, 86-year-old person, sort of suffering in public, going about his work, knowing he's got to be an incredible pain.
 
Often, he's always -- to use a cane when he walks, and then to have undergone this surgery, which was no easy feat, three-hour abdominal surgery. You know, he -- the doctors didn't want him to stand even last week, last Sunday, to give his Sunday Angelus. They were so concerned about his healing process, because this, as we know, Pope Francis likes to work. He is a man that likes to keep his nose to the grindstone. And so we can expect to get back to Santa Marta, where he lives, within the Vatican, and be right straight to work, Kim? 
 <br>[03:05:10]
 
BRUNHUBER: Alright, huge relief, breathe around the Catholic world, I'm sure. Barbie Nadeau in Rome, thank you so much, I really appreciate it. 
 
Greek authorities say they've arrested nine crew members of the migrant boat that sank early Wednesday off the coast of Greece. They were apparently identified among the rescued survivors and are now being held on suspicion of human trafficking. 
 
The boat sank in very deep water and there's little hope of finding additional survivors. Many women and children were believed to be trapped below deck. 
 
The traumatized survivors are currently being cared for in a dockside warehouse and will eventually be transferred to a facility in Athens. 
 
CNN's Melisa Bell joins us live from Kalamata, Greece where it's just after 10 in the morning, just a tragic loss of life, Melissa, and certainly many fingers being pointed at Greek authorities. What is the latest? 
 
MELISA BELL, CNN PARIS CORRESPONDENT: Well, what we've seen here in Kalamata this morning, Kim, are those people who survived, the survivors, 104 of them that had been held here ever since they were fetched from the sea. Some of them had been taken to hospital, those with the most serious wounds. Others had been kept in a hangar to be fed, looked after, and spoken to. They've now been put on buses and they're being taken to Athens, where their applications will be processed. 
 
But also here in Kalamata, those charges brought against nine Egyptian men accused of having been part of the people smuggling operation that allowed all of those people, some 750 in all, we believe to have gotten onto that boat that set off from Tobruk just a few days ago. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BELL (voice-over): It's the biggest rescue operation they have ever undertaken, say Greek authorities. But far too little, far too late, say several of the NGOs who patrol the Mediterranean Sea, now the deadliest migrant crossing in the world. 
 
The boat here, hours before it sank, the Greek Coast Guard says, refused help. Greek authorities say it took just 10 to 15 minutes for it to sink. Only 104 people survived. 
 
UNKNOWN (through translator): All women died, all children died, because women stay all in one room. So impossible they would survive, impossible, so difficult. All women and their children died. 
 
BELL (voice-over): Those who did make it out alive say the boat may have carried up to 750 people. Only 78 bodies so far have been found. 
 
Among the missing, the young wife and brother-in-law of Qassam Abouzid, a Syrian who's lived in Germany for seven years. 
 
His friend says they paid $5,000 per person to be smuggled to Europe. 
 
UNKNOWN: $5,000 for a quick death. 
 
BELL (voice-over): At least 40 children were on the vessel, the U.N. says. And as the search for bodies continues, there are questions about how long it took to send help. 
 
The boat started out from Libya heading towards Italy and called for assistance Tuesday afternoon, one charity said. It claims the authorities had hours to reach the vessel, but a rescue operation was, quote, "not launched until it was too late." 
 
GIORGIA LINARDI, SPOKESPERSON, SEA-WATCH ITALY: This intervention did not result in a rescue. And this is the point. Even if authorities. went to check on the vessel. As a matter of fact, a rescue operation was not carried out. And this is a clear duty of search and rescue authorities under international laws. 
 
BELL (voice-over): Countries like Greece and Italy have long been calling for harder borders. Last week, the E.U. took another step towards a long elusive compromise that goes in their direction. 
 
But so far the signals that Europe's borders are closing have done nothing to dissuade those willing to risk death in the name of life. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
BELL: And that is the fear, Kim, for those NGOs, people who patrol these waters, that these sorts of tragedies are only likely to increase.
 
Here in Greece, authorities have long been accused of being increasingly hardline in their approach to migrants arriving on their shores, not just in places like Lesbos, but there have been these accusations that migrants have been simply set off back adrift to sea, a harder and harder immigration policy that's seen walled camps, for instance, erected, walled borders put up along the Turkish border, and that say those who look at these issues, those who defend the human rights of people who are likely to arrive in Europe claiming asylum, say that often those actions are in breach actually of their international duties as a European country.
 
And as I mentioned there in the report, what you're going to see here in Europe that has been searching ever since the migrant crisis in 2015 for some kind of compromise between countries like Greece and Italy that have borne the brunt of these arrivals ever since, that have wanted a redistribution either of the number of people arriving or of the cost of it. 
 <br>[03:10:14] What Europeans have finally managed to find, and that should come in next year, is the system that will indeed make Europe's external borders harder than they were before, Kim. 
 
BRUNHUBER: Alright, thanks so much, Melissa Bell in Kalamata, Greece. And last hour, I spoke with a Red Cross volunteer in Greece who's been
 
 helping treat the survivors. He says they're generally okay physically but are suffering mentally. Here's some of that conversation. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GIORGOS CHATZIGEORGIOU, HELLENIC RED CROSS VOLUNTEER: The general condition of the survivors is good. And we had some people checked on site and we referred them to the hospitals for further investigations as they suffered some minor injuries or some medical conditions that required further investigation. But the main problem right now, I would say, is the psychological condition of the survivors. 
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah, tell me more about that. 
 
CHATZIGEORGIOU: We were there yesterday. People were concerned about friends and family that were also on board and were not anywhere to be found. And we think that they are now realizing what happened. 
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah, it must be absolutely traumatic as they face the possibility of losing loved ones. We heard there that was a very dim hope of finding any more survivors. Is that what you believe as well? 
 
CHATZIGEORGIOU: I'm not an expert on this. We are not a part of the search and rescue operation, just part of the medical team. But statistics say that as the time is passing by the possibilities are also recusing. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER: At least nine people have died and 23 have been injured so far as a tropical cyclone bears down on Northwest India and parts of Pakistan. Biparjoy has torn roofs off houses, uprooted trees and brought down power lines leaving nearly a thousand villages in the dark. The cyclone made landfall late Thursday evening local time in India's Madras state not far from the border with Pakistan. Biparjoy will continue to weaken as it moves further inland. 
 
CNN meteorologist Chad Myers has the latest. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST: What once was a very powerful storm for a time down here in the warm water now is down to 100 km per hour storm making its way on shore. So, the storm surge is not so great. The wind speeds are not so great. But the real threat from Biparjoy is when this moves on shore and into the very dry land that's there with very heavy rainfall. Some spots will pick up 250 to 500 millimeters of rainfall, that's anywhere between 8 and maybe even up to 16 inches of rain. There's the storm where it was, a meandering little storm, didn't want
 
 to come on shore, finally did. The good news is because it took its sweet old time that this thing grabbed so much dry air from the deserts to the north that it lost a lot of intensity. 
 
A hurricane, cyclone, typhoon, they all want to be in warm water and they want to have humid air around them. Well, it didn't have the humid air, it was dry air that truly weakened the storm significantly. 
 
It is going to continue to move, it continue to weaken as it moves through, kind of the hilly areas here. And that's part of the problem. It's the hilly areas that will collect the rainfall in one or two spots and then all run downhill. 
 
So if you see this 250 to 500 millimeter rainfall totals here, here to some back over here, that's almost 12 inches of rainfall expected here in that white zone. That's where the freshwater -- the flash flood water will be collecting and also of course running off. That's the greatest risk right now. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
BRUNHUBER: The town in Texas took a direct hit from a dangerous tornado, Thursday afternoon, causing extensive damage. Have a look at this. 
 
(VIDEO PLAYING)
 
It happened in Perryton in the Texas Panhandle near the Oklahoma border. Fire, law enforcement and emergency crews from surrounding areas have been deployed. The Fire Chief tells CNN at least three people were killed. One hospital says it's treated 50 to 100 patients injured in the storm. And that hospital is operating on generator power. 
 
At least 15 people are dead and 10 injured after a semi-trailer truck collided with a bus carrying senior citizens at a level crossing in rural Canada. 
 <br>[03:15:02]
 
Police in Manitoba say it's one of the worst traffic accidents ever in the province where flags at the legislature have been lowered. 
 
CNN's Paula Newton has more from Ottawa. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PAULA NEWTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Police officials were clear to say this was no local accident. In fact, they say that so many people are still reeling from what has become now a national tragedy. What we know -- we know that a group of seniors, about 25 of them, were traveling about a two-hour drive on a bus to go to a casino in Manitoba.
 
That casino, Sand Hills, confirms to CNN that they were supposed to be there throughout the afternoon. That bus approached a four-lane highway, and in attempting to cross it was hit by a large tractor trailer, a large truck. 
 
Apparently, the accident scene for miles, there was smoke billowing flames. People rushed to the scene and attempted to help those who were there, but people describe a very grim scene with so many people having to be triaged there by the side of the highway. I want you to listen now to the police official describing what is going to take now to try and figure out exactly why this happened. Listen. 
 
SUPERINTENDENT ROB LASSON, MANITOBA RCMP: So this is -- this new for us and our investigators and it's very emotionally draining for them as well. And as I mentioned, this is a very complex, large investigation with lots of things we have to unfold and unpack. 
 
NEWTON: Now, police say a forensic reconstruction team will be on the scene to try and figure out what happened. You have to remember, witnesses say that the skies were blue, the road was dry. There really isn't an explanation so far. 
 
They also said a couple of other interesting things. They say that perhaps there was a stop sign missing there at the intersection. Police wouldn't speculate, but say it's something that they're investigating. And also crucially that the two drivers had survived. And while they are injured, a police will speak to them when it's time. And in fact, hospital officials say that they still do not have a status report on those injured. 
 
Paula Newton, CNN, Ottawa.

BRUNHUBER: Ukraine says its military offensive is showing results, but the pace of that advance is open to interpretation. We'll bring you up to date with how much progress Ukraine has made so far. 
 
Plus, Ukraine's military finds an intelligence gold mine in the graveyards of Russian missiles. For more on that coming up, please stay with us. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BRUNHUBER: The U.S. Defense Secretary says Ukraine's ongoing offensive against Russian forces is a marathon, not a sprint. Kyiv says it has made some progress in Bakhmut and liberated a number of settlements in the Zaporizhzhya region. But as you can see from this video, in Bakhmut, Russia is not giving up anything without a fight. And Ukraine says that in some areas, Russian troops are even trying to go on the offensive. 
 <br>[03:20:01]
 
So for more, Salma Abdelaziz joins us from London. So Salma, bring us up to speed on that Ukrainian offensive. 
 
SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely. Even Ukraine admitting that Russia is putting up a fierce fight. Still, Ukrainian officials say they have been able to make some steady -- some steady progress rather in recent days since President Zelenskyy just about a week ago made that acknowledgement that this counteroffensive is underway.
 
Ukrainian forces are focused on two particular directions towards the north, Bakhmut, of course, a city that's been a flashpoint for many months now. Ukrainian forces saying there, they've been able to push towards those Russian positions a few hundred meters and then south of Zaporizhzhia, where they are saying there is gradual but sure advancement of their troops.
 
They say they've been able to take 100 square kilometers, that's about 39 square miles of liberated territory to the south of Zaporizhzhya. But as you mentioned, of course, Russia is not giving up easily. It has for months its troops been preparing for this counteroffensive. Satellite images will show you, and military analysts will tell you that Russian troops have been heavily fortifying their positions all along those very long front lines. 
 
And perhaps one of the most fortified areas is that area that is of most interest to Ukraine right now. And if you pull up a map to just look at those front lines, you can see that it is to the south of Zaporizhzhya. Of course, for Russia, this is critical. This is important because it is that area that connects that land bridge from Russian-occupied Crimea to the rest of those front lines. 
 
It is that vital supply route. It connects the Black Sea, the Sea of Azov, to those Russian troops as well. They will not cede this territory easily. Again, satellite images show Russian troops have been putting in trenches, have been setting up anti-tank equipment, have been digging in mines. 
 
So yes, you are seeing a slow and gradual advance from Ukrainian forces, but that may very well be because they need to test those front lines, try to find weaknesses. 
 
Meanwhile, Russia's forces seem to be trying to pull or distract Ukrainian forces along other portions of that front line. They have been pushing back in Kharkiv and Donetsk, so engaging Ukrainian forces in other locations as well. Look, this is an absolutely complex that will take a long time, Kim, before we begin to see some serious progress. 
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah, absolutely. Alright, thanks so much. Salma Abdelaziz in London. 
 
All right. I want to talk now about how ordinary Ukrainians feel about the new military offensive. So for that we're joined by Kira Rudik, a Ukrainian parliament member, and she's speaking to us from Kyiv. Thanks so much for being here with us. So before I get to your constituents, how do you assess the Ukrainian offensive so far? 
 
KIRA RUDIK, UKRAINIAN PARLIAMENT MEMBER: Hello, Kim. Thank you so much for having me. Well, we are moving forward slowly, steadily, and it is critically important. There is a huge difference of how Russia can conduct their operations and how we can do that. They can use people as a battlefield meat. This is not what we do.
 
 This is not how we act. And, you know, in authoritarian regime, humans life is the cheapest currency. In democracy, it is the most expensive one. 
 
And this is why as of right now, when almost every Ukrainian family has somebody fighting at the front, what we are hoping that is happening, that our military commanders are indeed making sure that we have minimal losses. 
 
And we know that they are, and we know that it is their goal to win, but make sure that we preserve as many human lives as possible. And you have seen it in your previous episode with the drones, which actually made me burst with the pride, because we use drones instead of sending people there, instead of -- instead of putting their lives in jeopardy.
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah.
 
RUDIK: And this is how we act. And this is why this process is slower than expected. 
 
BRUNHUBER: Well, getting at that, then, I mean, you say this has been going slower than perhaps expected. I mean, are some Ukrainians disappointed that there hasn't been a huge push or a quick recapturing of territories we saw last year, for example, in the Kharkiv and Kherson regions? 
 
RUDIK: No, we are not disappointed at all because you see last year there was a long time of preparation before there was this strike forward to liberate Kherson and to liberate Kharkiv region. 
 
It happened in the -- in autumn and during the summer there were preparations and again slow but steady pushes forward. 
 
So the difference is that right now the whole world is watching very closely about how counteroffensive goes, and resist huge pressure on the speed on their conducting operations and et cetera. 
 <br>[03:25:07]
 
But we know, we are sure in our military, we trust our military commanders because they have proven themselves to be absolutely brilliant, effective and efficient. And this is why we know that we will win the war. We obviously we want it to happen sooner rather than later. But we also want to have our fighters to come back from this war. 
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah, absolutely. Listen, I want to turn to some political issues before we go. Some African leaders are in Kyiv today and then they're heading to Russia to present a peace initiative. I mean, there aren't a lot of details of what's in that plan. Do you know what's in it? And do you have any hope that it might be at least a step towards peace? 
 
RUDIK: Well, our goal as for Ukraine with African countries and African country leaders is to show them the truth, because there is lots of Russian propaganda going on in -- on the African continent, where they are claiming them not to be an aggressor. 
 
We want to show what is going on. And we want to make sure that African countries know that most of the grains that they are receiving, they're not receiving from Russia, they're receiving from Ukraine, and that we are also suffering from an aggressor, same as many of them are and were. 
 
So we do not have high hopes that there would be a diplomatic way to stop the war. We know that Russia would not stop unless they are stopped. We have seen that, we have proofs of that, and we have facts that are supporting this thesis. 
 
This is why we are using this opportunity to get better relationships with African country leaders. We appreciate their attempts. We want to show them what is really happening in Ukraine. But I do not think somebody in the world can persuade Putin to stop the war, as well as somebody in the world can take a vouch that Putin will keep his part of the bargain if there is any peace negotiation. 
 
BRUNHUBER: Really great to speak with you, Kira Rudik. Thank you so much for being here with us. 
 
RUDIK: Thank you and glory to Ukraine. 
 
BRUNHUBER: Kyiv says more than 140 missiles and 250 drones have been fired on Ukraine in the past two weeks or so. Almost three out of four Russian cruise missiles and about 60 percent of drones have reportedly been shot down. 
 
As Sam Kiley reports, the destroyed weapons have become a treasure trove of information for Ukrainian military experts. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SAM KILEY, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A graveyard of Russian missiles fired at Ukraine, creating misery and mayhem. They're stored and analyzed here in Kyiv, where authorities are determined that Russia will pay for its evil ingenuity. 
 
Here in Kryvyi Rih, the latest mass destruction by a Russian cruise missile, adding to a mounting civilian toll. This strike the result of Russia's determination to overwhelm and distract Ukraine's defenses. 
 
(on-camera): Oleksander is telling me that these two missiles, enormous and complex though they are, are actually decoys. They are used by the Russians to fire over enormous ranges, trying to distract the Ukrainian air defenses so that other, more dangerous missiles can get through. 
 
Oleksander's ministry is tracing, cataloging and costing the results of Russia's missile attacks. Each type of weapon has its own local history, like the Ishtoyshka that carry half a ton of explosives. 
 
OLEKSANDER, EXPERT (translated): These munitions are designed to kill people, soldiers, and lightly armored vehicles. So they knew where they were aiming for --
 
KILEY (on-camera): This is the sort of missile that hit the Kramatorsk railway station, killing more than 50 people. 
 
(voice-over): Five of the dead were children and scores were injured, all waiting for a train to escape the war. 
 
The latest official estimates suggest that Russia's destruction of Ukraine will cost $441 billion. But the human cost is incalculable. Help with air defense has therefore been vital. 
 
(on-camera): This is what remains of what Russia says is its most potent missile, the Khinzal. It's supposedly a hypersonic, traveling up to 10 times the speed of sound. And Oleksander's very pleased to point out that this is where it was hit by the Ukrainian counter- missile battery, because top of their list is the U.S. made Patriot. 
 
(voice-over): But among the most troublesome Russian weapons is this Iranian Shahid drone. 
 
(on-camera): Look at that! That is the engine of a Shahid. Cheap, sounds like a lawnmower because it basically is a lawnmower engine or something very similar. 
 
Oleksander and colleagues dismantled the drones, analyzed their computers and navigation systems and time and again, find foreign-made parts inside despite sanctions on Iran and Russia.
 <br>[03:30:00] 
 
(on-camera): The aircraft has 40 kilograms of high explosives on board. Down here at the end in Russian, there's a play on words. On one flap, it says, do not touch, but by removing one letter, translates into, not brothers, a message to the Ukrainians. 
 
(voice-over): One that's often delivered loud and all too clearly. 
 
Sam Kiley, CNN in Kyiv.

BRUNHUBER: America's top diplomat is heading to China, but neither side is setting expectations very high. We'll find out what Anthony Blinken is hoping to accomplish next on "CNN Newsroom." 
 
Plus, tensions rising on the Korean Peninsula again. North Korea launches two ballistic missiles. The same day, the U.S. and South Korea conclude joint military drills. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BRUNHUBER: And welcome back to all of you watching us around the world. I'm Kim Brunhuber. This is "CNN Newsroom." 
 
Chinese state media report President Xi Jinping met today with Microsoft founder Bill Gates. The billionaire philanthropist arrived in Beijing late Wednesday. The meeting marks President Xi's first with a foreign business leader in several years. 
 
CNN's Kristie Lu Stout is live this hour in Hong Kong with details. So Kristie, how did Gates secure this meeting with Xi and what did they discuss? 
 
KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, this was a significant event. This marks Xi's first meeting with a Western business figure in recent years and according to state media Xi called Gates the first quote "American friend he has seen this year" and referred to him as a quote "old friend of China," he also said that the foundation of China-U.S. relations is quote "in the people". 
 
Now, according to state-run broadcaster CCTV, Xi Jinping told Bill Gates this, quote, "let's bring up the statement in today's world situation we can carry out all kinds of activities that will benefit our two countries our two peoples and humanity as a whole. Let's all be facilitators in this regard," unquote.
 
Now, Gates is in China to discuss global health issues with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. On Thursday, the foundation renewed its collaboration with the Beijing government and Tsinghua University to develop innovative therapies for infectious diseases around the world.
 
And on Wednesday, Gates announced on Twitter that he arrived in Beijing for the first time in five years. This is what he tweeted. He said, quote, "solving problems like climate change. Health inequity and food insecurity requires innovation from developing malaria drugs to investing in climate adaptation. China has a lot of experience in that. We need to unlock that kind of progress for more people around the world," unquote. 
 <br>[03:35:01]
 
Now, in 2020, I should note that Gates stepped down from the Microsoft board to focus on global philanthropy, but you know, in recent months, several Western business leaders have visited China since it reopened after years of those tough zero-COVID measures. Those leaders include Elon Musk of Tesla, Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan, Tim Cook of Apple, the list goes on. 
 
And while Beijing has been rolling out the red carpet for these Western corporate business figures, tensions remain high between the US and China. 
 
We know as we've been reporting, America's top diplomat, Anthony Blinken, will visit China this weekend as the U.S. looks to reset relations. His trip was originally scheduled in February. It was postponed because of the Chinese balloon incident, but it's an open question whether Blinken will have a chance to meet with Xi. In fact, the two sides did not say which officials Blinken would meet. Back to you, Kim. 
 
BRUNHUBER: And before we go, just set the scene here. What is the mood among Western business leaders inside China, given the tensions that you talked about between the two countries? LU STOUT: It is a mood of deep uncertainty inside China. As we've seen
 
 this parade of confident Western business leaders and CEOs come visit China in recent months, the mood on the ground is very cautious, and it's because of a number of factors. You had the recent raids on corporate offices and Western consulting firms in China, which has prompted many business people there, expats to say, who's going to be next? 
 
On top of that, you have the limits, the bans on high-tech products like sensitive technologies like semiconductors that is in place. That's also point of friction between U.S. and China at the moment. And then you also have the macro picture, China's slowing economy, the latest data in May, just additional indicators of a very, very slow recovery since the zero-COVID era in China. 
 
Just yesterday, China reported a record high in youth unemployment figures. So all of this adding up to a very uncertain economic and business picture in China. Kim. 
 
BRUNHUBER: Interesting. All right. Thank you so much, Kristie Lu Stout in Hong Kong. I appreciate it. 
 
Well, neither China nor the U.S. has high expectations for a weekend visit to Beijing from America's top diplomat. U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken is hoping to smooth over relations. China says Washington should show respect on the Taiwan issue and stop interfering in its internal affairs. 
 
Blinken's February visit was postponed after the U.S. shot down that Chinese spy balloon. Tensions have flared in recent weeks over close calls between U.S. and Chinese warships in the Taiwan Strait and military planes over the South China Sea. 
 
All right, joining me now is John Burns who's an emeritus and honorary professor at Hong Kong University. Thank you so much for being here with us. 
 
So this will be the most senior visit by an American official in five years but unlike the friendly reception American business leaders have been getting as we just heard about, the reception for Blinken seems to be much more frosty at least from the tone of the most recent Chinese messages. What is the mood surrounding this visit? 
 
JOHN BURNS, EMERITUS AND HONORARY PROFESSOR, HONG KONG UNIVERSITY: I completely agree with you. There's a lack of trust, great distrust on both sides. We've seen that both China and the U.S. have weaponized national security, expanded the scope of security, that there are many misconceptions in the U.S. and in China about the intentions of, you know, the other side. 
 
And then there's nationalism on both sides. I mean, you have political leaders in the U.S. stoking this? You have also political leaders stoking it in China. So it is a fraught atmosphere, I would say. It's a bit different from the business leaders. 
 
China's interests there are very clear, economic interests, foreign investment. But here we're talking about Taiwan, we're talking about South China Sea. We're talking about these big issues over which the U.S. and China have had a lot of conflict. 
 
BRUNHUBER: So, given all that, I mean, expectations are very low. Do you think anything concrete will come out of this? 
 
BURNS: Yes, yes, I do. They both agreed to talk. This is very significant, given where we are. 
 
And the Biden administration has basically said that given the risk of a hot war, we want to establish crisis communications channels with the military. If this is the only thing to come out of it, plus future talks down the road, I think we would be lucky. This is what I'm hopeful for. 
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah, because, I mean, the U.S. had wanted to establish some of those mechanisms to reduce risk. That was rebuffed. 
 
They proposed that the U.S. defense secretary meet with his counterpart. That was rebuffed as well. So, you know, not exactly a very welcome you think that might change especially on this very important issue? 
 <br>[03:40:09]
 
BURNS: I think it might change but remember that Minister of Defense Lee was sanctioned by the U.S. So I think -- perhaps the U.S. would have to do something about that in order for these kind of communication channels to be reestablished. But they're absolutely essential. 
 
Then if that happens, then the other issues, such as the environment and economic issues and so forth, could also be addressed. And as I understand it, the U.S. is keen to send other people to China to discuss these other issues. 
 
BRUNHUBER: So, you know, there's not that much time, I guess, to establish this thaw because of the U.S. election on the horizon. Do you get the sense that a clock is ticking? 
 
BURNS: You're absolutely right. And this is a problem, I think, for China, not just China. Anyone who deals with the U.S. is that politicians are having to mobilize their own supporters and anticipate what the opposition, the Republican Party, in this case in the U.S., is likely to do. 
 
So it does constrain this to a certain extent, but the risk of a hot war is real. And neither military, in my view, wants this. So neither country wants this. So I think the incentive to establish some kind of communications channels in this area is very great. 
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah, so modest expectations, but certainly a lot on the line here. 
 
BURNS: Yes, absolutely. 
 
BRUNHUBER: Listen, thank you so much for your analysis, Professor John Burns in Hong Kong. I really appreciate it. 
 
BURNS: Thank you. 
 
BRUNHUBER: All right, when we come back just hours after denouncing the U.S. and South Korea's joint military drills. Pyongyang launches two ballistic missiles. While the latest, ahead. Please stay with us.

BRUNHUBER: The cadet suspected in a deadly shooting in a Japanese military training center has told investigators he was aiming at his instructor when he opened fire but he didn't mean to kill him. 
 
That's according to Japanese broadcaster NHK. That instructor and another sergeant were both killed and a third sergeant was wounded. The 18-year old suspect has been charged with murder. Cadet live fire exercises which were suspended after the incident have now resumed. 
 
BRUNHUBER: South Korea has recovered debris from a North Korean rocket. The military says it believes the wreckage is from a failed reconnaissance satellite launched in May. At the time, North Korean state media said the rocket malfunctioned, sending it into the sea. South Korea is now analyzing the debris and will continue looking for more wreckage. 
 <br>[03:45:11]
 
Meanwhile, the U.S. South Korea and Japan are condemning North Korea's latest missile launches. Pyongyang fired at least two short-range ballistic missiles believed to have landed in the waters inside Japan's exclusive economic zone. 
 
CNN's Paula Hancocks says the latest from Seoul. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: These two short-range ballistic missiles fired by North Korea came just hours after the state-run media had slammed the U.S. and South Korea. 
 
Now we read through KCNA that the defense ministry in Pyongyang had denounced what they called the provocations of the enemies. Significantly, this was the U.S.-South Korean joint military drills, the joint live fire drills, which had been billed as the largest ever. It was five separate days of these live fire drills.
 
Today, this Thursday, was the end day, and it was more significant because President Yoon Suk-yeol of South Korea attended, and he said as commander-in-chief, he felt confident and satisfied with what he saw. So this appears to be what North Korea is reacting to at this point. 
 
Now, we went to cover one of those days earlier this month, and it was certainly larger than I have seen in many years. And it was also a more blatant message to North Korea. The scenario was that North Korea had staged what they called an illegal armed invasion, and the military drill that we've been saw was the U.S. and South Korean joint-reaction and counter to that invasion.
 
So, certainly, the messaging couldn't have been clearer to Pyongyang and they did not appreciate it slamming the U.S. and South Korea for carrying out these drills. In fact, they have said this is the reason that they have carried out so many missile launches and weapons testing. Certainly we have seen a significant uptick in the past year and a half.
 
And they also say that's the reason they carried out at the end of last month, an attempted satellite launch to put the military reconnaissance satellite into space. They didn't manage to do that, but they said they will try again as soon as possible.

BRUNHUBER: The 21-year-old U.S. National Air Guardsman, accused of posting classified documents online, has been formally indicted. Jack Teixeira is facing six counts of willful retention and transmission of classified information related to national defense. He was arrested and charged under the Espionage Act in April. 
 
The Justice Department says Teixeira took photos of documents marked secret and top secret from a military base and posted them online. He has not yet entered a formal plea and remains in federal custody. 
 
The U.S. State Department is condemning what it calls the horrific violence in Sudan, including the killing of the West Darfur regional governor. The fighting is now in its third month with no end in sight. 
 
A monitoring group estimates that more than 2,000 people have been killed, and Doctors Without Borders describes the capital, Khartoum, as a profoundly chaotic and violent situation that almost defies comparison. Let's listen.

In an exclusive report, CNN's Nima Elbagir reveals how the notorious Russian mercenary group Wagner is aiding the conflict. Here's a preview. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The fighting on the streets of Sudan is relentless. Ceasefire after ceasefire has not held. The RSF's key ally, the notorious Russian mercenary group, Wagner, has been sustaining their fight and providing the impetus to slaughter innocent people by supplying arms. We're going to show you how.

Britain's disgraced former prime minister has described a parliamentary committee as a kangaroo court after its investigation found he lied about Partygate. 
 
Borris Johnson released a statement saying, quote, "this report is a charade. I was wrong to believe in the committee or its good faith." 
 
The committee is mostly made up of members of Johnson's own Conservative party, and their report says Johnson knowingly deceived lawmakers when asked about Downing Street parties that violated his own government's COVID lockdown rules.
 <br>[03:50:05]
 
Johnson resigned from parliament last Friday before the report was published. He says he, quote, "committed a serious contempt and recommended suspending him for 90 days." 
 
The proposed merger that shocked the golf world is under even harsher scrutiny. Ahead, reports of an investigation that could threaten the deal between the PGA Tour and its competitor, the LIV Golf series. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BRUNHUBER: Chinese football fans are mad for Messi. Have a look here. One boy jumped from the stands at Worker Stadium in Beijing on Thursday, ran onto the pitch and hugged the Argentine superstar. Security led the fan away. But he was back in the crowd soon apologizing for his behavior.
 
State media report the 68,000 seat stadium sold out in 20 minutes despite tickets costing up to $670. Lionel Messi and Argentina went on to win the match against Australia, two-nil.
 
The proposed deal between the PGA Tour and Saudi-backed LIV Golf have already angered fans and sparked two U.S. Senate investigations. Now a "Wall Street Journal" report of a U.S. Justice Department investigation is raising the possibility that the whole deal could be scuttled. 
 
CNN's Brian Todd reports. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It was a controversial sports mega deal from the get-go, and now it could soon be the subject of a Department of Justice investigation. "The Wall Street Journal" reports justice has notified the PGA Tour that it will investigate the tour's planned merger with Saudi-backed LIV Golf. The journal says justice officials will be looking at antitrust concerns. 
 
SHAN WU, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: It's the idea that if you have within one industry major players that merge together, there's no longer any competition. I mean, the whole point of the economy under our system is for people to be able to compete. So if you have the two major entities merging with each other, they're going to suck all the oxygen out of the free competition. 
 
TODD (voice-over): According to the journal, antitrust lawyers have cited comments like this from PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan, who discussed why the merger would be good for the tour. 
 
JAY MONAHAN, PGA TOUR COMMISSIONER: Ultimately to take the competitor off the board to have them exist them as a partner, not an owner. 
 
TODD (voice-over): Last year, LIV Golf succeeded in luring away top PGA players like Phil Mickelson, Bryson DeChambeau, and Dustin Johnson. It reportedly offered superstar Tiger Woods between $700 and $800 million to join, which Woods turned down. 
 
The PGA Tour fought tooth and nail to stem LIV Golf's momentum, barring defecting players from competing in some PGA Tour events, engaging in legal disputes with the Saudi-backed tour. What changed? 
 
DAN RAPAPORT, GOLF JOURNALIST, BARSTOOL SPORTS: The money went out in the end. The Saudis had way more money through PGA Tour. The PGA Tour, I guess, came to a conclusion that they couldn't continue to fight this fight. They just didn't have the resources to continue. 
 
TODD (voice-over): The surprise announcement of the merger last week outraged critics, who pointed out that one of America's most iconic sports entities was now teaming up with a tour backed by a wealth fund chaired by Mohammed bin Salman, known as MBS, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia. The man who U.S. intelligence said approved the operation which led to the murder and dismemberment of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018, which bin Salman has denied. 
 <br>[03:55:09]
 
CHRISTINE BRENNAN, CNN SPORTS ANALYST: Basically, the headline is, never mind. Everything we talked about, the outrage of the PGA tour, how they spoke about the 9-11 families and their concern about them. murder of Jamal Khashoggi, that's all out the window. The PGA Tour has wimped out, let's just say what it is. 
 
TODD (voice-over): Could a Justice Department investigation kill the potential merger? 
 
WU: Yes, a DOJ investigation like this could stop the merger. DOJ could not approve it and say this is gonna violate antitrust laws. 
 
TODD (on-camera): CNN has reached out to the Department of Justice, to the PGA Tour, and to LIV Golf, seeking comment on "The Wall Street Journal" report of an investigation. We haven't heard back. This comes just days after two entities in the U.S. Senate, the Finance Committee and the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations announced their own investigations into the merger.

Well, this could be straight out of the Bible. One Nevada town is dealing with a plague of crickets. Have a look at that. 
 
The migrating Mormon crickets, as they're called, have taken over every space in Elko. Now, thank goodness they don't actually bite, but they do eat crops. At the first residence, they found the swarm curious. Well, now they just want the bugs to go away. Listen to this.

BRUNHUBER: Yeah, I don't blame them. While it may seem apocalyptic, this type of storm actually isn't unusual. Utah has had swarms in the past. The state's entomologist says it's just more noticeable when it happens in populated areas. 
 
Finally, one airport visitor didn't pass the test with security. Have a look here. A black bear was spotted on the grounds of the Tampa Florida Airport. 
 
Wildlife officials were called in to capture the bear. He was safely released at the Ocala National Forest in central Florida. It's believed the bear scaled the fence to get onto airport property.
