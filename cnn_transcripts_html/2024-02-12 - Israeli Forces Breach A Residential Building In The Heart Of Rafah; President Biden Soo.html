ZAIN ASHER, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST: All right, warnings to Israel from leaders across the globe as it prepares for a potential ground offensive in 
 
 Rafah. 
 
BIANNA GOLODRYGA, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST: "One World" starts right now. Early this morning, Israeli special forces stormed a building where the IDF 
 
 says Hamas was hiding hostages. Two captives were freed. Dozens of Palestinians were reported killed in the Israeli strikes. 
 
ASHER: And another shooting in the U.S., this time at a megachurch in Texas. What we know about the attacker and the young child she brought with 
 
 her. 
 
GOLODRYGA: Plus, a big end to the big game and topped with a big kiss for the winner. 
 
ASHER: All right, coming to you live from New York, I'm Zain Asher. 
 
GOLODRYGA: And I'm Bianna Golodryga. So good to be back with you. You are watching "One World". Two Israeli hostages taken captive by Hamas on 
 
 October 7th were rescued overnight in a raid conducted by Israeli Special Operations Forces in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. It marks just the 
 
 second time in the nearly four-month Israel-Hamas war that the Israeli military has successfully rescued hostages in Gaza. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLODRYGA: Israel pounded the city with airstrikes and shellfire, killing nearly 100 people, according to officials in Gaza. Israel says the two men 
 
 being held captive in a civilian building were in a civilian neighborhood, as well. 
 
ASHER: Yeah, they're said to be in good condition. They're now receiving medical treatment. They're in Tel Aviv. But the Hamas-run Gaza Health 
 
 Ministry says at least 94 people were killed as Israeli warplanes and helicopters hit multiple locations in Rafah. 
 
Those casualties are only adding to concerns, a lot of fears over a possible Israeli ground offensive in Rafah, where an estimated 1.3 million 
 
 people, that's pretty much, by the way, more than half of Gaza's population have been crammed into, they're seeking refuge there. Qatar, Saudi Arabia, 
 
 Egypt, and the U.S. and the U.K. are among a growing list of a lot of countries who are really concerned about this. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DAVID CAMERON, BRITISH FOREIGN SECRETARY: Let's be clear, the people there, many of them have moved four, five, six times before getting there and it 
 
 really, we think, is impossible to see how you can fight a war amongst these people. There's nowhere for them to go. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ASHER: All right, we have a lot of reporters standing by, covering all angles of this developing story. We've got Arlette Saenz at the White 
 
 House. We've got Jeremy Diamond for us in Tel Aviv, Israel. So, Jeremy, let me start with you. 
 
So, just in terms of this rescue and how it unfolded, we know the IDF essentially stormed a really heavily guarded apartment building. Just walk 
 
 us through what actually happened during the rescue and also the intelligence that got the IDF to that point. 
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, this was a daring raid carried out by Israeli special forces overnight. And it was something that 
 
 was a long time in the planning. 
 
The result of intelligence gathered by the Israeli military, as well as Israel's internal security services, the Shin Bet, we're told that at 1:49 
 
 A.M., these Israeli forces breached a residential building in the heart of Rafah. They said that the intelligence directed them to the second floor of 
 
 the building where they found these two men, 70-year-old Luis Har and 60- year-old Fernando Marman. 
 
Those forces grabbing the hostages, hugging them with their bodies, according to the Israeli military, and rushing them out under fire from 
 
 Hamas fighters. A minute after that breach was completed, we're told that the Israeli Air Force began pounding targets in that area of Rafah.
 
They say targeting Hamas fighters in the area to try and prevent them from intercepting that rescue mission. We're told that these two men were then 
 
 helicoptered out of Rafah to a hospital on the outskirts of Tel Aviv where they had a very emotional reunion with their family members after 128 days 
 
 of captivity. 
 
But we have also been witnessing today the results of those Israeli airstrikes coming at the same time as this dramatic rescue mission. And the 
 
 result of that is that at least 94 people in Rafah have been killed by those strikes, many of them women and children according to hospital 
 
 officials on the ground. And we are seeing the scenes from some of those hospitals beginning to come in. 
 <br>[12:05:00]
 
And that is perhaps providing just a glimpse of what could come should the Israeli military move forward with a military operation in Rafah. We know 
 
 that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, despite that international concern about a military operation there, has been doubling down on the 
 
 importance of going after what he has described as Hamas' last bastion in the southern-most city of Rafah. 
 
But of course, we also know that it is now home to 1.4 million Palestinians, many of whom have been displaced from other parts of the Gaza 
 
 Strip. And so, enormous international concern right now about exactly how the Israeli military could provide what the Israeli Prime Minister has 
 
 described as safe passage for those hundreds of thousands of civilians in that area, where they would go and what kind of circumstances they would be 
 
 living in elsewhere. 
 
We know that one of the reasons why Rafah has become such a last refuge for Palestinians is because that is where so much of the aid is coming in. It's 
 
 where humanitarian organizations have perhaps the most infrastructure built up there. It has previously been a quote, unquote, safe area for 
 
 Palestinians. 
 
And so, concern about how aid will reach further north as we have already seen the challenges of that happening in the northern parts of the Gaza 
 
 Strip. So, again, a lot of -- a lot of concern. The Israeli military for its part, says that it is working on those plans as we speak. 
 
ASHER: Yeah, I mean, as you point out, though, where do those people go? Where do they go once that military offensive, that ground assault starts 
 
 in Rafah? Jeremy Diamond, live for us there. Thank you so much. 
 
GOLODRYGA: Let's go to the White House now where Arlette Saenz is joining us. Arlette, the President is scheduled to meet with Jordan's King 
 
 Abdullah. This is the first Arab head of state to visit the White House since the October 7th attack. What are some of the priorities for the 
 
 administration going into this meeting? 
 
ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Bianna, President Biden will welcome King Abdullah of Jordan here to the White House in just a few 
 
 hours. The White House saying that the two men will discuss the situation in Gaza, as well as efforts to produce an enduring end to the crisis. 
 
We know, King Abdullah has repeatedly called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, which is something so far President Biden has resisted doing. But it 
 
 does come as the public rift between President Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has become more pronounced in recent weeks. 
 
Just last week, the President called Israel's response in Gaza over the top, and there's also been frustration behind the scenes that Netanyahu has 
 
 not heeded the advice of the U.S. to de-escalate some of their military operations in Gaza.
 
Now, this all comes as the U.S. is closely watching the situation in Rafah, saying that they would not support any military operation there unless 
 
 there is significant planning underway to protect the civilians who are located in that southern city in Gaza. 
 
As Jeremy noted, many had been displaced to that city from other parts of Gaza during this war over the course of the past few months. And President 
 
 Biden yesterday, stressed all of this in a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu. 
 
They spent about 45 minutes on the phone and the President in that call, said that any operation in Rafah should quote, "not proceed without a 
 
 credible and executable plan for ensuring the safety of and support for the more than one million people sheltering there". 
 
So, this is something that the U. S is expected to continue to press Netanyahu on as he is considering the next steps in his military campaign. 
 
 Now, another issue that's likely to come up in these discussions with King Abdullah is the latest in the hostage negotiations. 
 
The majority of the President's phone call yesterday with Netanyahu centered around how to secure the release of those more than 100 hostages 
 
 being held by Hamas. We know that Netanyahu has referred to the latest terms provided by Hamas as delusional. 
 
And a senior administration official did acknowledge that there are still significant gaps in these hostage talks, but they do believe progress has 
 
 been made been made in recent weeks. That is part of the reason why President Biden is deploying the CIA Chief Bill Burns to Egypt tomorrow to 
 
 continue discussions on these talks. 
 
But it really all comes at a critical time, not just for the war between Israel and Hamas, but also for President Biden domestically. He has been 
 
 under a lot of pressure, especially from the progressive flank of the Democratic Party, to call for a ceasefire in Gaza, to call for an end to 
 
 this war. 
 
And so, this meeting with King Abdullah will be closely watched as he is one of those proponents of calling for a ceasefire at this time. 
 
GOLODRYGA: Let's not forget that among those 100 plus hostages that remain in Gaza, six are American citizens. Arlette Saenz thank you. 
 
ASHER: And more now on those hostages. After more than four months in captivity, two Israelis are finally free. 
 
GOLODRYGA: Yeah, the IDF says they were being held in a house in Rafah on the southernmost tip of Gaza, where it rescued them last night. Former 
 
 hostages are now said to be in good condition at an Israeli hospital. 
 
ASHER: CNN's Nic Robertson has been speaking to their families, and I want you to listen to what they can say. 
 <br>[12:10:00]
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
GEFEL SIGAL LLAN, NIECE OF RESCUED HOSTAGE FERNANDO SIMON MARMAN: How they are now -- they are a little thin, a little different color. 
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: They lost some weight. 
 
LLAN: They lost a little weight. They were in human situation, a condition and now I'm thinking about the 134 hostages that are waiting and being at 
 
 risk of their life and I want them to be also released a s soon as possible.
 
EDAN BEIJERANO, SON-IN-LAW of rescued hostage Louis Har. Very special day today at least for our family. Two hostages came back surprisingly enough 
 
 at the middle of the night and we were very surprised to get a phone call at the -- half past three in the morning. And really, with a one simple but 
 
 very tough sentence saying Louis is here. Fernando is here. Please come to the hospital. We got them. 
 
ROBERSTON: That's all you knew? 
 
BEIJERANO: That's all you need sometimes, you know. One simple thing, one simple phrase that will change your life. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
BEIJERANO: So much needed good news for Israel there with the release of those two and the rescue of those two hostages. Let's get a deeper look at 
 
 the situation. After more than four months of fighting in Gaza, CNN's Global and Political Affairs Analyst Barak Ravid joins us now. He's also a 
 
 politics and Foreign Policy Reporter with "Axios". So, Barak, as we noted at the top of the show, this was only the second successful hostage rescue 
 
 in the nearly four-month military fighting there between the Israelis and Hamas in Gaza. 
 
What is the sense about any potential future hostage rescues? I just came back from Israel last week. This is the number one priority of everyone 
 
 that I spoke with -- is getting all of those hostages home. Is there a sense that we could see more raids like this, or is there a view that the 
 
 more fruitful options could be continued talks, as we heard as soon as this week in Cairo? 
 
BARAK RAVID, CNN POLITICAL AND GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: Well, first, I think the Israelis don't see those two options as contradictory. They're going to 
 
 try and continue finding intelligence that will lead them to the option of a military rescue operation to get hostages out. 
 
But they will continue the talks to try and get some sort of a deal in diplomatic ways, as is going to happen tomorrow in Cairo with the meeting 
 
 of CIA Director Bill Burns, the Prime Minister of Qatar and the spy chiefs of Israel and Egypt. They are going to continue trying to find a way to 
 
 break the -- break the freeze in these negotiations over the hostages.
 
But I think that what we saw in this operation is that we thought that the hostages are all in the tunnels and we saw that it's not the case. And what 
 
 the Israeli military thinks right now is that maybe because of the Israeli operation in Khan Younis, Hamas moved at least several hostages from the 
 
 tunnels in Khan Younis to family homes in Rafah where they are hiding them, which might give more options for future operations. 
 
GOLODRYGA: Well, it's interesting because you know, this obviously also comes at a time when Israel has been under do much pressure to limit the 
 
 scale of their potential military operations in Rafah. 
 
Of course, there is so much suffering in Rafah right now, there will continue to be, especially after a potential ground assault. But how much 
 
 does the rescue of these two hostages really remind Israel's allies what is at stake here? 
 
RAVIS: Again, at least at the moment we are now, honestly, I do not see an Israeli ground operation, Rafah, in the next, I don't know, two to three 
 
 weeks. Then we enter Ramadan. Honestly, it would be highly unlikely that the Israelis will start such a ground campaign, Rafah, during Ramadan. 
 
So, if, I think there will be a ground operation, Rafah, but it might be somewhere after Ramadan in mid-April or the end of April, something like 
 
 that. I do not see this in the next few weeks. 
 
GOLODRYGA: And all of this sparked because Prime Minister Netanyahu had told and instructed the IDF to prepare --
 
RAVID: Yes.
 
GOLODRYGA: -- for a future invasion into Rafah. What is the response when the Israeli military or government there on growing talk and speculation 
 
 about military restriction from allies? The U.S. and the E.U. surrounding some of their operations. How worried are the Israelis and is the 
 
 government that could actually come through? 
 
RAVID: I think that, you know, when you ask senior IDF leadership, they're very much conscious of that option. This is why the IDF Chief of Staff, 
 
 General Halevi, in the last cabinet meeting, told the ministers pretty bluntly, if you want to continue to Rafah, we need U.N. Security Council. 
 
 And this means, Israel cannot have the U.S. not vetoing Security Council resolutions that call for, you know, a ceasefire. 
 <br>[12:15:00]
 
And this means that any future operation in Rafah or in some of the refugee camps in the center of the Gaza Strip will have to be coordinated with the 
 
 U.S. The plans will have to get U.S. approval, and without that, I think, Israel will not go ahead with such operations. 
 
ASHER: All right, Barak Ravid, live for us there. Thank you so much. Appreciate it. All right, a source tells CNN that Defense Secretary Lloyd 
 
 Austin has now canceled an upcoming trip to Brussels. 
 
GOLODRYGA: Yeah, he was hospitalized once again this time over the weekend on Sunday for what doctors at Walter Reed Medical Center say is an 
 
 emergency bladder issue. 
 
You'll recall he was diagnosed with prostate cancer last year and faced criticism for not informing President Biden that he was in the hospital. 
 
ASHER: All right. Oren Liebermann joins us live now from the Pentagon with more. So, we know that he's in critical care at Walter Reed, serious enough 
 
 for him to cancel his upcoming trip to Brussels this week. Oren, what more do we know? 
 
OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: Well, he remains in critical care at Walter Reed Medical Center. He was taken there at about 2:20 
 
 yesterday afternoon. The notification on this came very quickly. We, in the press, got our first statement about two and a half hours later. 
 
That statement from the Pentagon said he'd been taken to the hospitals with symptoms suggesting an emergent bladder issue and that the President had 
 
 been notified, the White House, Congress, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. 
 
A notification here, obviously working very quickly as the Pentagon and the Office of the Secretary of Defense seem to have learned their lesson about 
 
 how critical this is. 
 
We got the second statement a couple of hours later that he had transferred his authorities to Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks, and then 
 
 shortly before midnight the statement that he had been admitted to critical care there for extra support and for extra monitoring as doctors were 
 
 treating and caring for him with this emergent bladder issue. 
 
There wasn't much time here. The Pentagon had announced on Thursday that Austin would be traveling to Brussels for a meeting of the Ukraine Defense 
 
 Contact Group and then a NATO defense ministerial. That trip was supposed to leave within the next 24, 48 hours or so. 
 
And we got the statement from a defense official a short time ago that the trip itself had been canceled. The Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting 
 
 would be held virtually, and then the NATO Defense Ministerial, Austin, will not be attending that. 
 
So, you see the effect this hospitalization has already had on Austin's schedule. Remember, it was December 22nd, 23rd, he went in to treat 
 
 prostate cancer. He was then re-admitted on New Year's Day for complications from that surgery where he stayed for two weeks. 
 
It took days for him to notify President Joe Biden and others. He was then working from home for another two weeks before he came back to the 
 
 Pentagon. He was only here for about a week and a half or so, two weeks before this last hospitalization began yesterday. At this point, it is 
 
 unclear how long he'll stay at the hospital. 
 
ASHER: All right, Oren Liebermann, live for us there, thank you so much.
 
GOLODRYGA: Coming up for us, Donald Trump is in court once again. Not one, but three hearings are going on now involving the former President. We'll 
 
 bring you an update after the break. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:20:46]
 
ASHER: All right, it is certainly a very busy day for Donald Trump and his legal team. They are battling on three fronts right now. It is the last day 
 
 to request the Supreme Court to pause the election subversion case against him. And in Georgia, a hearing related to accusations of impropriety at the 
 
 D.A.'s office, as well. 
 
GOLODRYGA: And Trump himself showed up at the courthouse in Fort Pierce, Florida, for a hearing related to his alleged mishandling of classified 
 
 documents. Remember that case? 
 
Well, you can see his motorcade arriving there. All along, Donald Trump has maintained his innocence. Evan Perez is following the case from Fort 
 
 Pierce, Florida, and joins us live now. Certainly, a very busy day on multiple fronts for the former President, Evan. 
 
EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR U.S. JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Right. Yes it is. And he decided to come today to this courthouse. He didn't have to come, but he 
 
 and his legal team have been fighting with the Special Counsel's Office for access to some of these documents that are at issue in this case. 
 
We, of course, remember that this is an issue about mishandling of classified documents, some of which obviously were retrieved from Mar-a-
 
 Lago. What the Trump legal team is asking for, and they're meeting with this judge over the last three hours, is to get access not only to the 
 
 documents that they want to use -- in the federal that the government says they want to use that the government says they want to use in the federal 
 
 trial, but also documents that they believe will help his defense. 
 
So, documents that right now, the federal government is saying are so sensitive that the former President can't see the documents. He can only 
 
 look at some summaries of it. So, in the courthouse behind me, you know, there's a special room that's known as a SCIF where the legal team, where 
 
 the former President, are able to look at some of these documents. 
 
And after he's done, so, in about another hour or so, we anticipate that the government will get their turn, again meeting with the judge, arguing 
 
 for continued restriction on some of these documents. It's not only the former President, but also his co-defendants Walt Nauta and Carlos de la 
 
 Vera who are asking for access to some of these classified documents. 
 
ASHER: All right, Evan Perez, live for us there from Florida. Thanks you so much. 
 
GOLODRYGA: Coming up for us, European leaders in the White House are responding with outrage after Donald Trump says that he would encourage 
 
 Russia to attack NATO allies who pay too little for defense.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: No, I would not protect you. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the 
 
 hell they want. You got to pay. You got to pay your bills. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:26:53]
 
GOLODRYGA: Welcome back to "One World". I'm Bianna Golodryga. 
 
ASHER: And I'm Zain Asher. Stupid, unhinged, appalling and dangerous. Those are just a few of the words being used to describe Donald Trump's very 
 
 controversial comments about NATO over the weekend that have really ignited a political firestorm across Europe and actually beyond. 
 
GOLODRYGA: Yeah, during a rally in South Carolina on Saturday, the front- runner for the Republican presidential nomination said he would encourage Russia to attack U.S. allies if they did not spend enough on defense. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TRUMP: One of the Presidents of a big country stood up and said, well sir, if we don't pay and we're attacked by Russia, will you protect us? I said, 
 
 you didn't pay? You're delinquent? He said, yes, let's say that happened. No, I would not protect you. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever 
 
 the hell they want. You've got to pay. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLODRYGA: Trump has a long history of criticizing NATO, and he has proven that he is willing to take concrete steps to yank the U.S. out of some of 
 
 its international commitments. While President Trump pulled America out of a pact designed to curb Iran's nuclear program, as well as the Paris 
 
 climate accord. 
 
The NATO Chief, meanwhile, warns that any suggestion that Western allies will not defend each other would undermine global security. And the E.U.'s 
 
 top diplomat had this to say. 
 
JOSEP BORRELL, E.U. FOREIGN POLICY CHIEF: It's not, yes, now, yes, tomorrow, no, it depends, who are you. Now, come on, let's be serious. 
 
 Let's be serious. NATO cannot be an alliance a la carte. It exists or it not exists. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ASHER: Time now for The Exchange and our conversation with Kurt Volcker. He's a former U.S. ambassador to NATO, and he joins us live now from 
 
 Washington. Mr. Volcker, thank you so much for being with us. I mean, given your role as former U.S. ambassador to NATO, just your initial reaction to 
 
 Donald Trump's comments over the weekend. 
 
KURT VOLKER, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO NATO: Yeah, it's a terrible thing to say. And the idea that we should be encouraging any country to attack any 
 
 of our allies, that's just outrageous. 
 
Now, to be clear, what former President Trump was doing was he was at a political rally and he was bragging about what he says he did in the past. 
 
 We don't even know if he actually said that, but he's bragging about that. But even so, this is exactly the wrong message to send to somebody like 
 
 Vladimir Putin. 
 
He's already engaged in a war in Europe. His forces are committing war crimes. They're bombing civilians. They're doing terrible things every day. 
 
 The last thing we want to suggest is that we would not help defend our allies or that he should be attacking other countries, too. 
 
GOLODRYGA: Now, it's remarks like those that led Congress to codify that the U.S. could in fact not withdraw unilaterally from NATO without 
 
 congressional approval. But I'm curious to get you, your response and reaction to other Republicans, some who have been quite hawkish in support 
 
 of Ukraine prior to President Trump. 
 
One of them, Senator Marco Rubio, who has endorsed former President Trump for the nominations, he sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He 
 
 knows better. Yet, here's what he said over the weekends to Jake Tapper on State of the Union when Jake asked him about the former President's 
 
 comments. 
 <br>[12:30:00]
 
MARCO RUBIO, U.S. REPUBLICAN SENATOR: He told the story about how he used leverage to get people to step up to the plate and become more active in 
 
 NATO. I have zero concern because he's been President before. I know exactly what he has done and will do with the NATO alliance, but there has 
 
 to be an alliance. It's not America's defense with a bunch of small junior partners. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLODRYGA: He seems pretty confident that the President wouldn't pull out NATO or force Congress to make that decision. Are you as confident as some 
 
 of the Republicans who are supporting the former President now? Because Nikki Haley is not. 
 
VOLKER: Yeah, well, remember here, Marco Rubio was one of the senators who sponsored that legislation in the Senate --
 
GOLODRYGA: Right.
 
VOLKER: -- to say that it would require Senate approval for Trump to pull the U.S. out of NATO. So, clearly, he's concerned about it. I think he's 
 
 just trying to adopt a political posture right now to try to downplay this. 
 
I am a little concerned that Trump would do it all over again, that he's, as he said, he was using leverage, the threat of not defending our allies 
 
 in order to get them to spend more on defense. But using that kind of language and doing it again is very, very dangerous and disruptive, 
 
 especially when you consider that before when he was doing this, if he did it. 
 
Putin was not attacking anybody at the moment. Now, there's a war going on in Europe. Our allies in the Baltic states and in Poland are very much at 
 
 risk. Some of them, like Poland, are now spending four percent on GDP because of the very serious security threats they face. We have to take 
 
 this more seriously. 
 
ASHER: Putin, of course, hears these comments and he laps them up. I mean, you know, but I'm just, I just want to get your take on Ukraine's 
 
 perspective -- Zelenskyy's perspective. If Donald Trump wins, comes November this year, what happens to Ukraine as it pertains to Russia in 
 
 this war? 
 
VOLKER: Yeah. Zelenskyy, of course, is defending his own country. Ukrainians are being attacked every night. Russia is firing at cities in 
 
 Ukraine, drones, missiles and so forth. He has no choice. He has to defend the country. He has to work with whatever resources he has. He has to work 
 
 with whatever administration there is in the United States. 
 
He's been frustrated over the past couple of years that aid has not come fast enough and in the right types. I think he would continue to ask for 
 
 that. He'd continue to try to work with the United States. But it would be very, very difficult if you have somebody making threats like that against 
 
 you at the same time. 
 
ASHER: But what will it mean for Ukraine being forced, perhaps, to concede territory to Russia if Donald Trump wins the election here? 
 
VOLKER: Well, I don't think that they would do it. I think that, you know, they would be defeated before they would concede. They have to defend their 
 
 country. These are people, these are lives, these are families. They don't really have a choice. And they are getting substantial assistance from the 
 
 E.U., from the United States, from many countries, and they will continue to fight. 
 
GOLODRYGA: Well, that's some $60 billion that's currently being held up in Congress as this bill, it does seem to be advancing through the Senate. We 
 
 don't know how things will end up in the House. Obviously, the former president is putting a lot of pressure on the Speaker and some within his 
 
 caucus not to push this bill forward. 
 
And the war continues. I mean, just last week, Russia used a hypersonic Zircon missile in its attack on Kyiv. Now, this is according to preliminary 
 
 analysis. So, my question to you is, without that additional aid coming soon,
 
And I mean, you know, within the next few weeks or so getting a bill passed, how is this affecting Ukrainians? You've already had a changing of 
 
 the guard in terms of war leadership. Your sources in Ukraine, what are they telling you? 
 
VOLKER: Well, first off, the aid is essential and it is urgent. They are facing depleted supplies, for instance, of artillery shells, and that is 
 
 having an impact on the soldiers on the front line. It's costing lives. It is making people more anxious. 
 
Ukraine will continue to fight. They will have to use their own resources. They'll get money from elsewhere, like the E.U. They'll have to turn a lot 
 
 of that to defense, but they will continue to fight. 
 
Now, as for the United States, if this were to come to a vote on the floor in the House, it would pass overwhelmingly. There's no question about that. 
 
 And the difficulties are on the Republican side getting it to the floor because of a small number of members who want to hold it hostage for other 
 
 things such as shutting down or controlling better the southern border. 
 
But this aid, as you say, is truly urgent in Ukraine now. And let's be clear. If Putin wins in Ukraine, if he defeats Ukraine, takes territory, 
 
 consolidates that, he's just going to rebuild his forces and do it again. 
 
ASHER: Kurt Volker, live for us there. Thank you so much. We appreciate it. 
 <br>[12:35:00]
 
GOLODRYGA: Well, coming up for us, the world of sport is reeling from the tragic loss of a world class athlete. We'll have a live report from Nairobi 
 
 as Kenya mourns marathon runner and world record holder, Kelvin Kiptum. 
 
ASHER: Plus, a frightening scene in Texas where a woman opened fire at a popular church, leaving those inside to hide and pray for safety.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ASHER: All right, police in Texas are investigating why a woman walked into a popular megachurch Sunday afternoon and started shooting. Authorities say 
 
 the woman entered the televangelist Joel Osteen's Houston church with both a small child and an AR-15 rifle. A police source says that the weapon had 
 
 the words "Free Palestine" written on it. 
 
GOLODRYGA: Police shot and killed the woman and the child was also wounded and is in critical condition. Ed Lavandera is in Houston with more. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A terrifying scene at one of America's biggest churches.
 
UNKNOWN: I started screaming, there's a shooter, there's a shooter.
 
UNKNOWN: We hid about 10 of us, 10 adults in a closet and here was one child in there. And no vent, but we were all praying. 
 
LAVANDERA (voice-over): An armed woman entered Pastor Joel Osteen's mega church in Houston on Sunday afternoon and opened fire. 
 
TROY FINNER, HOUSTON POLICE DEPARTENT: She was armed with a long rifle and a trench coat with a backpack, accompanied by a small child, approximately 
 
 four to five years old. 
 
LAVANDERA (voice-over): Houston's Police Chief Troy Finner says two off duty law enforcement agents working security at the church confronted the 
 
 woman, getting the situation under control. 
 
FINNER: She's deceased here on the scene. I want to commend those officers. She had a long gun, and it could have been a lot worse. But they stepped up 
 
 and they did their job. And I want to thank them for that. 
 
LAVANDERA (voice-over): However, the child who came to the church with the woman was also shot. 
 
FINNER: Unfortunately, a five-year-old kid was hit and is in critical condition at our local hospital. 
 <br>[12:40:00]
 
LAVANDERA (voice-over): The chief says it is unclear who fired the shot that struck the child, and the child's relationship to the suspect is still 
 
 unknown according to police. The officers involved in the shooting told investigators the woman claimed to have a bomb, but an immediate search 
 
 found nothing. 
 
FINNER: We searched their vehicle, our bomb squad, and also the backpack. No explosives were found, but she was also spraying some type of substance 
 
 on the ground. Witnesses described a chaotic scene. 
 
UNKNOWN: My mom was screaming and then my mom said, come, and we ducked because the -- while I called my mom, the bullets were still repetitive and 
 
 they were still going and the attacks were in the sanctuary. 
 
LAVANDERA (voice-over): One bystander was injured. That was a 57 year old man who didn't have anything to do with it, I don't think, was shot in the 
 
 leg. He's seeking treatment in the hospital. Pastor Osteen says he's thankful the shooting did not happen earlier in the day. 
 
JOEL OSTEEN, LAKEWOOD CHURCH PASTOR: I can only imagine if it would have happened during the 11 o'clock service. If there's anything good of it, you 
 
 know what? They sure didn't get in there and do a whole lot worse damage. 
 
LAVANDERA (voice-over): And he's left hoping the decades-old church will continue holding services without another scare like this. We're going to 
 
 stay strong, we're going to continue to move forward and there are forces of evil but the forces that are for us, the forces of God are stronger than 
 
 that.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
GOLODRYGA: I mean this is a world-renowned and recognized church. The Houston Rockets used to play there. Yes, he is known around the world. So 
 
 this was a huge event and developing story in Houston. Obviously it could have been a lot worse and our thoughts are with that child who is in 
 
 recovery right now. 
 
Well, to Kenya now, where the country is mourning a world-class athlete taken in his prime. Such a horrible story. Twenty-four-year-old Kelvin 
 
 Kiptum, the world's fastest marathon runner, has died in a car crash.
 
ASHER: Authorities say that Kiptum was driving Sunday when he lost control of his vehicle. It went into a ditch. It hit a tree. Kiptum and his coach 
 
 were killed while a third person in the car survived with serious injuries. Kiptum set the marathon world record last October in Chicago with a time of 
 
 two hours and thirty-five seconds, a record ratified only days ago. 
 
GOLODRYGA: Larry Madowo joins us now from Nairobi. What has the reaction been to this tragedy, Larry? 
 
LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: There's been an outpouring of reactions from around the world because Kevin Kiptum was seen by many as the future 
 
 of the marathon. 
 
He only started running this long distance just over a year ago, debuted in Valencia with the fastest marathon debut ever, went on to win gold in 
 
 London, and then that extraordinary performance at the Chicago Marathon where he shaved off 34 seconds from the record set by another Kenyan 
 
 competitor to consider the greatest marathoner of all time, Eliud Kipchoge. 
 
And they were due for a rematch. They were due to actually compete both at the Paris Olympics this year. Maybe he would have been the first man to run 
 
 under two hours of the marathon in regular conditions. 
 
And he was also training to run the road to the marathon in April. A real tragedy for this young man who had so much of his life still ahead of him. 
 
 And that is why you hear this statement from Kenya's sports minister. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ABABU NAMWAMBA, KENYA MINISTER OF SPORTS: Kenya, the world and the fraternity of athletics and sports in general has lost a special shining 
 
 gem, a truly top tier athlete and sportsman. We pay tribute to him for what he has achieved in his very short life at the age of 24. He has placed our 
 
 country in the stars. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MADOWO: And he achieved a lot at just 24. He started running, Kelvin Kiptum, when he was just 13. He grew up in this part of the Reef Valley, 
 
 where most of Kenya's long-distance athletes come through. And he's really been through a lot to get to the point where he was. And the bigger tragedy 
 
 here is that he was an only child. So, his parents are devastated tonight. And he survived by two young kids of his own. 
 
President William Ruto of Kenya has described him as an extraordinary sportsman who left an extraordinary mark. And I think the sentiment that 
 
 really captures the feeling of so many people not just here in Kenya but around the world is from Eliud Kipchoge who said he's deeply saddened by 
 
 the tragic passing of Kelvin Kiptum that he called a rising star. 
 
And especially this line here, an athlete who had a whole life ahead of him to achieve incredible greatness. But now, we will never see that because of 
 
 this 24 dead in a car crash alongside his coach, his Rwandan coach, Jave Hazakebana. 
 
GOLODRYGA: I've taken just way too soon, obviously a tragedy for his family, for the country, and for the world of sports and running. 
 <br>[12:45:00]
 
GOLODRYGA: Everyone had their hopes on him for coming in sub two hours in a marathon. He was just two minutes shy. What a horrible story. Larry Madowo, 
 
 thank you. 
 
ASHER: Leaving behind two children, as well. Nigeria continues to mourn the loss of acclaimed businessman Herbert Wigwe, who was killed in a helicopter 
 
 crash in California over the weekend. Wigwe was the head of Access Bank, one of the largest banks in Africa. He was also a philanthropist, as well. 
 
 I personally had the pleasure of meeting and interviewing Herbert more than once. He was a visionary. He was thoughtful. He was extremely 
 
 inspirational. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
HERBERT WIGWE, ACCLAIMED BUSINESSMAN: You must thank God and put your faith and trust in him. That's the starting point. The second thing is, the 
 
 harder you work, the luckier you get. And then, of course, you must have the right people. It's all about people who are committed to a particular 
 
 cause, and once you have the right people, the right team, the right values, you will get there. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ASHER: I was asking Herbert there just about business advice for young Nigerians who view him as such a success. He was incredibly sharp, very 
 
 witty. He was also very generous as well. Wigwe was on the way to the Super Bowl in Las Vegas when his helicopter crashed. His wife and his son were 
 
 killed, as well. Abimbola Ogunjabo, the former chair of the Nigerian Stock Exchange, was also killed in that helicopter crash, as well. 
 
And just a note for our viewers, earlier when reporting on this incident, CNN ran an incorrect picture of Abimbola Ogunbajo and showed instead a 
 
 photo of Mr. Ademola Ogunbajo. We apologize for this error and for any distress that may have caused. We'll be right back. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
GOLODRYGA: Well, a massive storm system is moving along the U.S. East Coast, and millions are under storm watches and alerts. It is the second 
 
 round of impacts from the system that's bringing severe weather to the Gulf Coast and the Southeast. 
 
ASHER: Yeah, the winter storm is expected to leave a blanket of snow in the region, with central Pennsylvania through eastern Maine forecast to receive 
 
 between four to eight inches of snow. CNN's Meteorologist to Elisa Raffa has your look at this week's forecast. 
 <br>[12:50:00]
 
ELISA RAFFA, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Our storm is on the move. That severe risk is sliding east as we go into Monday from Alabama into Georgia and the 
 
 Carolinas. That's where you're looking at that threat for the 70 mile prior wind gusts, large hail and a few tornadoes. Some heavy rain there, too. 
 
You can see that line continues to push east and then move north into the Carolinas as we go into Monday. Then as we go late Monday into Tuesday, it 
 
 starts to clash into some cold air up in parts of the Northeast going into New England and that's going to pump some snow from central Pennsylvania, 
 
 upstate New York and parts of New England. 
 
And we'll find that snow come with some gusty winds and could drop visibility late Monday, early Tuesday morning and then going into Tuesday 
 
 night. All of that starts to exit. Here's your footprint of the snow. You see all the deep pinks and purples. That's where looking at some snow 
 
 totals 6 to 8 even offers or 12 inches of snow. 
 
Snowfall rates could be one to three inches per hour. Couple that with the gusty winds gust up to 40 mph and you're looking at some really messy 
 
 conditions with low visibility. Kind of peaking as we go into Tuesday. Really again, exiting Tuesday night. 
 
Now, we haven't really seen too much snow up in the East. A lot of our snow depth, so far, this year has been to the west, 25 percent snow cover for 
 
 the lower 48 and a lot of it from the Sierra Nevada into the Intermountain West where we had that atmospheric river event unfold just a week or so 
 
 ago. 
 
Seasonal departure from normal for snow has been well below average for some places from the upper Midwest in the Great Lakes area where you see 
 
 all those brown dots and then going into New England. Some places that you really typically see snow like Minneapolis, Buffalo haven't really seen too 
 
 much so far this year. And part of the reason is we've had a really warm winter. You see all the red dots? A lot of these cities in the Great Lakes 
 
 region and then in the east there are looking at their warmest winter on record. It's just been kind of spring-like, really lacking a lot of the 
 
 cold and lacking a lot of the snow. 
 
We know that winter is warming across the lower 48 since 1970. You could see those same places. The upper Midwest Great Lakes going into New England 
 
 or some of the places with the biggest fever 4 to 5 degree fever since 1970. That makes winter the fastest warming season for a lot of these 
 
 places.

GOLODRYGA: In case you were living under a rock the last 24 hours, you don't recognize this man. That is Kansas City Chiefs tight end, Travis 
 
 Kelce, singing the tune, "We Are the Champions". 
 
ASHER: I love this song, by the way. 
 
GOLODRYGA: I do too. That was a fun game to watch last night. The team had a back to back Super Bowl victory on Sunday. They beat the San Francisco 
 
 49ers 25 to 22 in overtime in Las Vegas. Kelce was also spotted dancing with his girlfriend, an up and coming singer, by the name --
 
ASHER: By the name of Taylor Swift.
 
GOLODRYGA: After the game in this video. 
 
ASHER: For those of you counting, the Chiefs have won the Super Bowl three times the last of the five seasons, all of them with star quarterback 
 
 Patrick Mahomes. I was actually pausing next. I was looking at the video waiting to see Taylor, but I couldn't actually see. 
 
GOLODRYGA: Oh, I saw her. You could see her every once in a while. They're watching like all the other fans cheering on Kansas City. 
 
ASHER: Oh, anyone care about it in my house? 
 
GOLODRYGA: Chugging a beer. Do you see her chugging a beer, as well? Just like the rest. 
 
ASHER: With Blake. 
 
GOLODRYGA: CNN's Coy Wire was at the big game and brings us some of the best moments from this year's Super Bowl. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
VOICE-OVER: Viva Las Vegas. Viva Las Vegas.
 
COY WIRE, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR: In the first ever Super Bowl in Las Vegas, Taylor Swift was all of us screaming, cheering, maybe chugging a drink, 
 
 biting her nails as the defending champion Chiefs were down three, with 75 yards in front of them in just the second ever overtime in Super Bowl 
 
 history. 
 
PATRICK MAHOMES, KANSAS CITY CHIEFS QUARTERBACK: Just know that the Kansas City Chiefs are never underdogs. Just know that. 
 
WIRE: Patrick Mahomes, putting the team on his shoulders, found a way to win again, dissecting the defense with his favorite target, Travis Kelce, 
 
 333 yards passing on the night, two touchdowns including the game winner. 
 
VOICE-OVER: He runs and he throws, caught touchdown, it's caught. Caught the ball. The Chiefs have won.
 
WIRE: A party for the ages in Kansas City. At just 28 years old, Mahomes is now a three-time Super Bowl MVP, just the fifth quarterback ever to win 
 
 three titles. 
 
MAHOMES: I can't ask for anything better than this, man. We're Super Bowl champs, Kansas City. I'll see you all at the parade. Let's do it, baby. 
 
UNKNOWN: It's a brotherhood. It's a family. Forgive all me, I love you. Showing that, we sacrifice. 
 
UNKNOWN: We bought into everything. And I mean, there's confetti on the floor. I got a nice hat.
 <br>[12:55:00]
 
WIRE: Andy Reid, 11 years as the Chiefs' head coach. Ten playoff, first three Super Bowl wins. Time for the third most ever and the Big Red isn't 
 
 done. 
 
WIRE: And what's going to be your celebratory meal, coach?
 
REID: You know, a cheeseburger, maybe.
 
WIRE: Dynasty complete, a 25-22 win. Kansas City as their third title in five years. They're the first back to back champs in nearly 20 years. 
 
TRAVIS KELCE, KANSAS CITY CHIEFS TIGHT END: We get a chance to do it three times in a row.
 
WIRE: Travis Kelce getting a celebratory kiss from Taylor Swift, while brother Jason and Mama Donna stuck confetti in their pockets. The most 
 
 hyped Super Bowl delivers. From Usher's halftime performance through the Hollywood ending that couldn't have been scripted, anyways, seems like 
 
 nothing can stop the Chiefs and their Super Bowl eras tour.
 
All right you heard Travis Kelce, Taylor's BFF say on stage after the game that there's aiming for three in a row, now that's something no team in NFL 
 
 history has done. How many more can the Chiefs and Patrick Mahomes in this dynasty win? That is the question now.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
GOLODRYGA: Listen, Patrick Mahomes is what, 28 years old? I have full faith in him. I think he'll win another one and then maybe another one and 
 
 another one. Well, that does it for this hour of "One World". So good to be back.
 
ASHER: It's so good. 
 
GOLODRYGA: I'm Bianna Golodryga.
 
ASHER: I'm Zain Asher. Thank you so much for watching. Amanpour is up next.
