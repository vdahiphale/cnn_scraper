ELENI GIOKOS, CNN ANCHOR:  Live from London, I'm Eleni Giokos and this is "ONE WORLD". Now, in a matter of hours, Joe Biden will do something he has 
 
 done only one other time this year, and rarely throughout his presidency. 
 
He'll hold a solo news conference but this time, the stakes couldn't be higher, as calls for Mr. Biden to step aside are growing louder, and the 
 
 political ground beneath him appears to be shifting. Campaign funds are starting to dry up. Big-name donors are calling for the president to exit 
 
 the race, and more Democratic lawmakers are coming out in support of finding another candidate.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT):  I am deeply concerned about Joe Biden winning this November, because it is an existential threat to the country 
 
 if Donald Trump wins. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GIOKOS:  On top of that, new polling data showing over two-thirds of Americans want Mr. Biden to bow out, including more than half of his own 
 
 supporters. The president remains defiant, but his every move is being closely watched. Before he speaks tonight, Mr. Biden will have already had 
 
 a full schedule, including several working sessions with NATO allies and a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. 
 
Meanwhile, Democratic lawmakers are also feeling the pressure this hour. Senate Democrats will meet with campaign officials, and we expect to hear 
 
 from House Speaker Hakeem Jeffries. We've got all the angles of the story covered for you today. 
 
CNN's Sunlen Serfaty, as well as Natasha Bertrand, join us now live in Washington on this very important day. Sunlen, I want to start with you. 
 
 How is President Biden and his team preparing for this press conference? 
 
SUNLEN SERFATY, CNN WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Well, the White House certainly understands the significance of this moment. The campaign 
 
 understands the significance of this moment, and certainly the president does, as well. 
 
Now, it will be interesting to see what tone the president brings to the press conference later, and certainly they know the pressure is on, not the 
 
 least of which the audience of all those on Capitol Hill, top Democrats who have expressed concern about Biden continuing as a top nominee. We have 
 
 seen a number of defections over the course of the last two weeks since that debate performance. 
 
And their sense on Capitol Hill is that if he doesn't perform well tonight, that that potentially would only grow, and that many members are waiting 
 
 for the end of this press conference, waiting for the end of the NATO, to potentially come out and say one way or the other if they're with him or 
 
 against him. 
 
Now, at this hour, as you noted, top Democrats on Capitol Hill, Senate Democrats, are meeting with White House aides. This comes at the invitation 
 
 of the Senate Majority Leader, Chuck Schumer, who wants to assure members that Biden is the nominee. That's why he invited these White House aides up 
 
 there. But we know that Schumer himself has expressed some reservations. He has stood by Joe Biden publicly but that certainly is the tone right now on 
 
 Capitol Hill as he faces this very important press conference later today. 
 
GIOKOS:  All eyes on him, absolutely. And Natasha, I want to bring you in here. For President Biden is also about a strong showing at NATO and that 
 
 global leaders still believe in his leadership. What have we heard in terms of the outcome from NATO? And also, importantly, some of the commentary 
 
 from NATO members? 
 
NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, well, look, obviously lingering over this summit are questions about whether President Biden is going to be 
 
 reelected this November, particularly because, of course, former President Donald Trump has indicated that he might be willing to curtail support for 
 
 NATO or even pull out of the alliance altogether. 
 
And so, there are definitely questions here following President Biden's debate about just whether Biden can-- can show the American public that he 
 
 is up to serving another four years. But in terms of the overall atmosphere here, you know, world leaders are reiterating and reaffirming their support 
 
 for President Biden, saying a number of times in recent days that they believe that in meetings with President Biden, he has expressed, you know, 
 
 his ability to continue to lead in terms of U.S. leadership when it comes to Ukraine and other key issues that pertain to the U.S. and European 
 
 Atlantic security.
 
So, ultimately, you know, leaders here are still pretty confident that he is capable of leading this alliance over the next several months, at least. 
 
 But there are big questions about what comes next. And that is what people here are pretty afraid of and why we have seen an effort over the last 
 
 several weeks to Trump-proof the NATO support for Ukraine by moving it all under one umbrella inside NATO, kind of removing a lot of that control that 
 
 the U.S. has over support for Ukraine, streamlining things like training for the Ukrainians and weapons support for the Ukrainian military.
 <br>[12:05:10]
 
So, obviously, a lot of questions here about what comes next for the United States in terms of the presidential election. But for now, you know, world 
 
 leaders here are pretty confident that President Biden, at least over the last several last few days here, has been doing a good job. 
 
GIOKOS:  Sunlen, meanwhile, Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill have been hearing an earful from their members about President Biden. What can we 
 
 expect to hear from Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leader? This hour is his weekly presser. But is anything in particular that we're anticipating 
 
 here? 
 
SERFATY:  Yeah, Leader Jeffries has really tried very hard to be what his aides say is in listening mode over the last two weeks. He has talked 
 
 extensively to many members of the Democratic caucus. This comes as there is more -- growing by the day, calling for President Biden to step aside 
 
 and not be the eventual nominee.
 
But Jeffries himself, he has stood by Biden publicly. He has said that he's with Joe Biden. It hasn't been a full-throated defense, though, and not 
 
 notable. And we know that right now he is gathering information from his members. And he says, according to two sources, that he will take those 
 
 concerns to the White House, to President Biden.
 
So, I expect that we'll hear more potentially about his strategy, when that potentially would happen. But he has tried very hard to remain in listening 
 
 mode. His opinion matters so much here. He would be potentially, if the Democrats take control of the House, the next speaker of the House. 
 
So, he has a lot at stake and he's hearing from his members that are in vulnerable districts that they worry that if Biden stays on the ticket, 
 
 that they would lose that chance to win back control of the House. So this is a hard position he's in. And we expect, certainly, to hear a lot of 
 
 questions about that as press conference later today.
 
GIOKOS:  Let's see what happens. As you say, he's in listening mode. I guess a lot of people want to hear him speak around the issues facing the 
 
 Democrats at this point in time. Sunlen Serfaty and Natasha Bertrand, great to have you with us. Thank you so much.
 
With more on the importance of that news conference Biden will hold later today, I want to bring in CNN politics senior reporter Stephen Collinson, 
 
 who's been writing incredible analysis for us. Stephen, great to see you. And you say that Biden is facing the most high pressure presidential news 
 
 conference in modern history. So, here's the question. Could this conference save him? 
 
STEPHEN COLLINSON, CNN POLITICS SENIOR REPORTER:  I don't think it can save him. I think it could do him a lot of damage if it doesn't go well. The 
 
 news conference is just one of a number of occasions which Democratic lawmakers are asking the president to repeatedly show that he's up to the 
 
 job of fully campaigning for a second term and fulfilling the duties of a second term. 
 
So, even if it goes very well for Biden, I don't think it really changes the underlying political equation here. But if there is a repeat of the 
 
 version of the president that people and lawmakers saw at that debate, if he looks confused, incoherent, if he looks very old and not up to the job, 
 
 I think that will just redouble the panic that is unfolding on Capitol Hill about his election prospects.
 
So, in your piece on CNN.com, you say three factors could make his position untenable, a fracturing of his support in his party, the drying up of 
 
 fundraising and damning polling data. And you also say that as Biden greeted world leaders at the NATO summit, pieces were falling into place 
 
 that could make this fateful trifecta a reality. So, do you believe there's going to be a single significant moment that will force Biden to rethink 
 
 his stance and step aside? 
 
COLLINSON:  You know, it's going to be very difficult for anything to force Biden to change his mind, given the fact that he said he's finished talking 
 
 about the debate, he's running against Trump, and that's it. 
 
If there was, for example, a delegation from the Senate and the House, the leaders of those two Democratic conferences that went down to the White 
 
 House and said to the president they didn't think he could win, if the polling data in swing states becomes even more damning than it is already, 
 
 you know, Biden is a politician. 
 
He understands politics and the realities of running for election. Perhaps at that point, something could happen that would change his mind. But I'm 
 
 not sure that there's going to be one big issue. But we'll see. I mean, the momentum is really going against him.
 
GIOKOS:  It is. I mean, look, and it's fascinating. I've been hearing just some of the messaging from President Biden, and he's adamant that he's 
 
 staying on. And he actually said only the Lord Almighty could convince him to end his bid, right?
 
So far, the people that are asking him to step aside are people within his party, as well as George Clooney, a big funder, as well. So what do you 
 
 make of some of the messaging from Biden and also as they try and do damage control? 
 <br>[12:10:00]
 
COLLINSON:  I think that defiance in the way that the campaign responded to the appalling debate performance has made the president's position even 
 
 worse. As I was saying, even the people that support Biden on Capitol Hill are saying he needs to get out every single day in unscripted situations to 
 
 throw himself into the campaign to prove that he is the guy to beat Trump, that he can fully execute a presidential campaign, which is an exhausting 
 
 endeavour.
 
He's not done that so far. He's done an interview. He'll do this news conference. He'll do another interview. But it's far short of what people 
 
 want to see. And there is a feeling that the president is out of touch with the political reality that is being shielded by members of his family and 
 
 his campaign. And that is only making his situation among Democrats who are hearing from their constituents that they don't think Biden can beat Trump 
 
 even worse. 
 
GIOKOS:  Yeah, and I mean, the Democrats don't want to show that they're divided, make them perhaps look weaker as they head into an election 
 
 against Donald Trump. What impact is this having on Democrats as a whole? 
 
COLLINSON:  Well, there's never been a president in the modern era who has gone into an election with a party that's as divided as the Democrats now 
 
 are that has been able to win. That is what Democrats are thinking. There is a growing perception that Donald Trump could not just win the White 
 
 House, but he could lead Republicans to keep the House, recapture the Senate at the same time when there is a very radical conservative Supreme 
 
 Court, which is actively reshaping the fabric of American life. 
 
That is an absolute nightmare scenario for Democrats. And that's why some of them think that it's time to change the ticket, that they're heading 
 
 towards a disaster, a potential Trump landslide, and it's not too late to fix it, even though it would be very difficult. We could get to a point 
 
 where the risks of doing nothing are greater for the Democrats than the risks of actually trying to forge ahead and change the ticket. 
 
GIOKOS:  All right. So, with the convention just a month away, can he just run out the clock, do you think? 
 
COLLINSON:  That's clearly what they've been hoping for. Biden has been using the NATO summit to try and stall the momentum against him. That 
 
 hasn't really worked. It looked like it was working earlier in the week. But then we saw a lot of Democrats come out and start criticizing the 
 
 president. 
 
Next week, of course, is the Republican convention. Donald Trump will take center stage again. He will name his vice presidential nominee. The 
 
 campaign is clearly hoping that once that comparison between Biden, as diminished as he might be, and the more extreme, volatile and anti-
 
 democratic, potentially, Trump is on American screens, that the president could buy some time. 
 
We'll see if that happens. I don't really think this is going away right now. Maybe the political atmosphere changes next week, but it seems like 
 
 the president is still in a lot of trouble.
 
GIOKOS:  All right, Stephen Collinson, thank you so much for your analysis. Good to have you on the show. 
 
COLLINSON:  Thanks. Now, both Donald Trump and Joe Biden know their races will be won by convincing the small sliver of persuadable voters to back 
 
 their candidates. And unlike last campaign, a lot of those pursuables are young voters. CNN's Danny Freeman went to the swing states of Pennsylvania 
 
 to see how each camp is courting the youth vote.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DANNY FREEMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  As President Joe Biden worked the rope line in Harrisburg Sunday, trying to fight off questions 
 
 about his age, a younger face in the crowd was creating content. 
 
FREEMAN:  Did you ever think that you'd be influencing for a presidential campaign? 
 
KENNY SCREVEN, SOCIAL MEDIA INFLUENCER:  Definitely not. 
 
FREEMAN (voice over):  Kenny Screven is a social media influencer in Pennsylvania, one of many the Biden campaign has recently partnered with to 
 
 try and reach younger voters. In addition to makeup tutorials and LGBTQ advocacy, Screven now posts about the importance of voting for Biden. 
 
FREEMAN:  Do you feel young people are energized right now to vote in this election? 
 
SCREVEN:  Truthfully, no. I feel like a lot of people are discouraged. But I think that's where influencers come in. We can really help motivate them, 
 
 encourage them to vote. 
 
FREEMAN (voice over):  In 2020, younger voters overwhelmingly supported President Biden over former President Trump. But recent polls show the two 
 
 candidates running about even among this key demographic.
 
JAHNAVI RAO, PRESIDENT, NEW VOTERS:  Just Matt and Aryeh. 
 
FREEMAN (voice over):  Twenty-four year-old Jahnavi Rao runs a group out of Chester County. The goal, to register young voters in crucial swing states 
 
 and motivate them to vote. 
 
RAO:  There are more than enough people in this country who don't want you to vote as a young voter. All we're doing is giving you the tools and the 
 
 resources so that you can.
 
FREEMAN (voice over):  But resources are one thing. Enthusiasm is another. We asked several young voters on a scale from one to 10, how excited are 
 
 they to go to the polls in November? 
 
UNKNOWN:  I'd say like a five.
 
UNKNOWN:  I'm a seven right now. Seven or eight.
 
UNKNOWN:  I'd say, probably a five. 
 
UNKNOWN:  I mean, I would put myself at a one. Like I'm not excited at all. 
 
FREEMAN (voice over):  Eighteen-year-old Saranya Singh said she will a hundred percent vote for President Biden because reproductive issues are so 
 
 important to her. 
 <br>[12:15:04]
 
But she worries about the president's appeal to other young voters.
 
SARANYA SINGH, 18-YEAR-OLD PENNSYLVANIA VOTER:  A lot of my friends and a lot of people in our age group are really hesitant to vote this year at all 
 
 because, I mean, Biden is not the ideal Democratic candidate in any way. 
 
FREEMAN (voice over):  Anish Garamidhi is a rising sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania. And while he's also all in for Biden, he's 
 
 nervous about the lack of enthusiasm too. 
 
ANISH GARIMIDI, 18-YEAR-OLD PENNSYLVANIA VOTER:  The Biden campaign should definitely be seeing that as like, if a youth vote slips away, like 
 
 Pennsylvania slips away.
 
FREEMAN (voice over):  Here, former President Trump's campaign sees an opening. Though his team did not provide examples of state-specific youth 
 
 outreach, the campaign points to their recent launch on TikTok as a sign of its youth voter push. 
 
TREVOR TAYLOR, ADAMS COUNTY YOUNG REPUBLICANS:  When we talk about, you know, the economic issues, that resonates more with the youth vote. And 
 
 that's my advice to engage with them. And we're having success. 
 
FREEMAN (voice over):  Trevor Taylor leads the Young Republicans in bright red Adams County. He says the past few weeks have been pivotal. 
 
TAYLOR:  Especially seeing Biden's debate performance. I think that the trend is definitely moving towards not only Biden losing support, but Trump 
 
 gaining support and momentum.
 
FREEMAN (voice over):  The Biden campaign hopes volunteers like Lauren Kuntz will be able to change that momentum. 
 
LAUREN KUNTZ, BIDEN CAMPAIGN VOLUNTEER:  I couldn't sit by and not participate in a campaign that's so essential to keeping America how we 
 
 know it.
 
FREEMAN (voice over):  The 26-year-old mom from Lancaster, Pennsylvania, started volunteering with the Biden campaign earlier this year. And she 
 
 understands the youth challenge. 
 
FREEMAN:  What's your pitch to younger voters to say, you should be excited about this election? 
 
KUNTZ:  I think it's going to be less about the candidate itself and more about the policies that are going to help us as a generation. I mean, it's 
 
 becoming more expensive to just live. And there are a lot of policies that the Biden administration has put in place to make it more affordable, which 
 
 we should be excited about. 
 
FREEMAN (voice over):  Danny Freeman, CNN, Philadelphia. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
GIOKOS:  And still to come, Alec Baldwin's involuntary manslaughter trial resuming, where prosecutors argue the actor played a dangerous game of 
 
 make-believe on the movie, "Six". The latest on the "Rust" shooting trial after the break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:19:56]
 
GIOKOS:  Happening right now in a New Mexico courtroom, Alec Baldwin's trial resumes with a crime scene technician back on the stand. Baldwin is 
 
 accused of involuntary manslaughter and the death of cinematographer Helena Hutchins on the set of the movie, "Rust". Now, yesterday, the jury heard 
 
 opening statements. The prosecution said Baldwin broke the cardinal rules of gun safety. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ERLINDA JOHNSON, PROSECUTOR:  It's simple. It's straightforward. The evidence will show that someone who played make-believe with a real gun and 
 
 violated the cardinal rules of firearm safety is the defendant, Alexander Baldwin. 
 
ALEX SPIRO, DEFENSE ATTORNEY:  He was an actor acting, playing the role of Harlan Rust. An actor playing a character can act in ways that are lethal, 
 
 that just aren't lethal on a movie set. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GIOKOS:  Well, CNN's Elizabeth Wagmeister joins us now with the latest. I have to say, emotional scenes in the courtroom. What more can you tell us? 
 
ELIZABETH WAGMEISTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Absolutely emotional scenes playing out throughout this trial. Of course, you know, it's just a 
 
 terrible tragedy that this all revolves around. Now, today, the fourth witness has just left the stand. It was a crime scene technician and 
 
 actually some rather significant information coming out from her testimony. 
 
She said that live ammo was found on the set in the holster of another actor. So, what this confirms is that there appears to have been live 
 
 bullets on this set, not just in the gun that was being held by Alec Baldwin. Now, as we know, Alec Baldwin has repeatedly said that he did not 
 
 pull the trigger. 
 
But when this came up in opening statements, Baldwin's attorney essentially said that shouldn't even matter because the question is, is why was there 
 
 live ammo that was found on that set and how did that get there? So, let's take a look at that moment. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SPIRO:  So, Mr. Echols, another actor on the set, turns out that he, as he acted, as he performed, had a live bullet in his bandolier, correct? 
 
UNKNOWN:  Yes. 
 
SPIRO:  And you have no reason to think Mr. Echols had any idea that was there, right? 
 
UNKNOWN:  Correct.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WAGMEISTER:  So, even though testimony so far has been fairly technical, all related to this gun, we are getting some new information that, again, 
 
 is fairly significant. What we heard there is this is essentially painting a picture of a set that didn't seem to be safe. And, of course, that has 
 
 been a major question that has come out throughout, really, the past three years.
 
Of course, this trial finally getting underway nearly three years after Helena Hutchins' life was cut too short on the set of "Rust". And we also 
 
 have to remember that the armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, she has already been convicted and is currently serving an 18-month sentence. She was 
 
 facing the same charge as Baldwin. 
 
So, while the prosecution is saying that Baldwin is the one who acted recklessly, his defense is saying, no, this wasn't his fault. He's just an 
 
 actor. This was the fault of other people on that set, namely Hannah Gutierrez-Reed. And it remains to be seen if the jury will factor that in, 
 
 that the fact that she's already been convicted, does that help Baldwin's case? 
 
GIOKOS:  All right, Elizabeth Wagmeister, thank you so much for that update. Well, turning now to the killings of three women that sent 
 
 shockwaves through the U.K. earlier this week. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GIOKOS (voice over):  A memorial service was held earlier today in Bushey, England, where the women were killed. The victims were the wife and two 
 
 adult daughters of BBC journalist John Hunt. They were killed in what police describe as a crossbow attack. 
 
Condolences, as well as support, are also pouring in for Hunt, who is the BBC's racing commentator. His wife, Carol, and two adult daughters, Louise 
 
 and Hannah, were killed at a home north of London. Police have detained a 26-year-old man in connection with the attack and believe he was known to 
 
 the victims. 
 
CNN's Nada Bashir joins us now live in London with more. Nada, a really tragic story, suspect is now in custody. I mean, look, this was after a 
 
 manhunt. What more are you learning about the motives here? 
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, still no details on the motive just yet, Eleni. Police have said that they haven't been able to carry out 
 
 questioning just yet. The 26-year-old suspect is said to be in a serious condition in a London hospital. So, until he is deemed to be fit enough to 
 
 be questioned, that will not be taking place. 
 <br>[12:25:00]
 
But as you mentioned, there was a serious manhunt underway yesterday after the three women were found seriously wounded. They later, of course, died 
 
 from their wounds. But we are learning more about the potential relationship between the suspect and the three women. 
 
We know yesterday that police in England said that the suspect may have been known to the three victims today. British media outlets -- several 
 
 British media outlets have suggested that he may have had a romantic relationship with one of the daughters in this incident, the youngest, 
 
 Louise, 25-years-old. 
 
Suggestions that she may have had a romantic relationship in the past with the 26-year-old suspect. No confirmation of that and Hertfordshire police 
 
 have declined to comment on any possible connection between the two. 
 
But certainly concerning, there has been, of course, reports around Louise's social media posts prior to this tragic and fatal attack. She had 
 
 reshared a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, praising women who leave toxic relationships. One post saying, "I admire women who leave." 
 
Again, Hertfordshire police have declined to comment on any such suggestions. But as you mentioned, Eleni, tributes have been pouring in 
 
 throughout the day. Take a listen to this tribute which was aired earlier this morning on BBC "Radio 5 Live Sports".
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MARK CHAPMAN, BBC "RADIO 5 LIVE" SPORT PRESENTER (voice over):  This has been a heartbreaking day. John Hunt is our colleague and our friend, not 
 
 just to the current "5 Live Sports" team, but to all of those who have worked here with him over the past 20 years. And also to all of you who 
 
 have enjoyed his superb commentaries. So, on behalf of everybody connected to "5 Live Sports", our love and thoughts and support are with John and his 
 
 family. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BASHIR:  Now, this has really sent shockwaves across the country. The British Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, has issued a statement saying that, 
 
 "The loss of three women's lives in Bushey is truly shocking. My thoughts are with the family and friends of those who have been killed and with the 
 
 community." Eleni. 
 
GIOKOS:  Nada Bashir, thank you so much for that update. Well, the high- profile criminal trial involving U.S. Senator Bob Mendez could be handed over to the jury today. Closing arguments finished a short time ago in the 
 
 wide-ranging corruption case involving the Democratic Senator from New Jersey and two of his co-defendants.
 
Right now, the prosecution is presenting its rebuttal before the case is ultimately handed to the jury. Mendez and his co-defendants, two New Jersey 
 
 businessmen, are accused of taking part in a years-long bribery scheme that included actions benefiting the governments of Egypt and Qatar. All three 
 
 men have pleaded not guilty. 
 
Coming up, radical changes. What the U.S. government could look like under a second Trump administration. A CNN investigation reveals Donald Trump's 
 
 ties to the controversial Project 2025. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:31:46]
 
GIOKOS:  Welcome back to "ONE WORLD". I'm Eleni Giokos. Now, Donald Trump is trying to show he won't completely remake the U.S. government if he wins 
 
 the White House again. Trump is denying any connection to a 900 page document called Project 2025. It is a roadmap written by prominent 
 
 conservatives for policy changes under a Trump presidency. 
 
It calls for replacing many career federal employees with partisans loyal to Trump and it shrinks the size of the government including the total 
 
 elimination of the Department of Education. It attacks several social issues calling for a ban on abortion pills and advocating married men and 
 
 women as quote, "the ideal family structure" and it promotes the deportation of men millions of undocumented immigrants while finishing 
 
 Donald Trump's border wall. 
 
But while Trump claims he knows nothing about Project 2025, a CNN investigation finds many of the people involved in it are close Trump 
 
 allies. Our Steve Contorno was a major part of this in CNN investigation and joins us now. Steve what more did you learn as you sort of dug through 
 
 -- through this information and, you know, what lies beneath this Project 2025 and how connected is Donald Trump? 
 
STEVE CONTORNO, CNN REPORTER:  Very connected. We looked at all the people who are listed as authors, contributors, editors on this project, as well 
 
 as all the conservative groups that are listed as advisors to the project. And we found more than 200 connections between the Trump administration and 
 
 this effort to put together this conservative playbook for a second Trump term. 
 
That includes a hundred and forty people who worked for Trump, who helped to write this and that's not just foot soldiers in his administration, it's 
 
 people who rose to the highest levels of his government includes six people who wrote, who are actually cabinet members in his administration, four 
 
 people that he appointed to be ambassadors, many of the top officials who are the architects and enforcers of his controversial immigration program 
 
 including, as well, a deputy chief of staff. 
 
Many of the people who work at the organizations advising this project also come from Trump world. One of them is Mark Meadows, his former chief of 
 
 staff, a group that he works with now is overseeing this project. The other is Stephen Miller, his controversial advisor on immigration. He started his 
 
 own organization that is also advising Project 2025. 
 
Now, when we took all this evidence to the Trump campaign, they said look, yes, these people used to work for Trump but they don't work for Trump now 
 
 and they might not work for him again in the future. Trump has his own agenda that he has posted on his website. He has the Republican Party 
 
 platform that he supports. He doesn't necessarily support what Project 2025 is putting out there. 
 
Yesterday, actually, Trump tweeted that he doesn't know anything about this, he's not involved and he believes this is just an effort by Democrats 
 
 to make him look bad and certainly, Democrats have been picking out some of the more controversial elements of Project 2025 and tying them to the 
 
 former president. But his attempts to keep them at arm's length is complicated by the fact there are just so many ties between him and this 
 
 group.
 <br>[12:35:01]
 
GIOKOS:  All right, Steve Contorno, thank you so much for that update. Well, more now on our top story. A critical news conference is looming for 
 
 U.S. President Joe Biden and there won't be a script or a prompter when he goes in front of reporters in about six hours from now. 
 
This will be the president's first news conference since his per-debate performance last month and it's seen as a crucial test for his re-election 
 
 bid. Coming amid more calls from Democrats for him to step aside. 
 
For the first time, a Democratic senator, Peter Walsh of Vermont is publicly calling on Mr. Biden to end his campaign and that comes as 
 
 Democratic senators are meeting right now with members of the Biden campaign. 
 
Well, time now for The Exchange. Joining us live from Washington, D.C., Meghan Hays, convention consultant for the Democratic National Committee 
 
 and a former White House director of message planning. Great to have you on at this critical day -- on this critical day. 
 
Look, this press conference is said to be quite significant for the president. Can this ultimately convince the growing chorus of concerned 
 
 Democrats and potentially voters to support him? 
 
MEGHAN HAYS, CONVENTION CONSULTANT, DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE:  Look I don't think any one thing is going to be the determining factor of what can 
 
 change people's mind and what can support him. I think this is just one of the things that folks were asking him to do to be more candid, to be more 
 
 off-the-cuff and he's doing that. 
 
He's doing interviews, he's out in battleground states, he's been to Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, he's going to Michigan tomorrow, he hosted 31 
 
 world leaders for the NATO summit in D.C. for the past couple of days. 
 
So, I think that the press conference is just one of the things that folks want to see him doing and to see that he can do the job and I think that 
 
 it's an important step for the American people to see that he can continue to do the job. 
 
GIOKOS:  So, Meghan, you were Deputy Communications Director on the 2020 campaign and then played a role in the president's strategic messaging. So, 
 
 let me ask you this, what do you make of the two weeks of damage control efforts by the White House and by the Biden administration? 
 
HAYS:  Look, I think that they were slow to understand the gravity of the situation. I think they're slow out the gate but I do think that they have 
 
 picked up what they're doing. They've seen the president out there more, he's talking to folks, he's talking to voters. That's where really where 
 
 this election is going to be determined is out in these battleground states and talking to voters. 
 
So, it's great that, you know, these members from the coastal states are saying he should step aside but they're not in the battleground states, 
 
 they're not Michigan, they're not Pennsylvania, they're not Wisconsin or Arizona or Nevada and that's where he needs to be in talking to those 
 
 voters. So, I think that he's doing that but I do think they were a little slow to get there. 
 
GIOKOS:  So, would you say it was successful, what they've done? Because if it was successful we wouldn't see a concern around the polling and we 
 
 wouldn't hear more and more Democrats coming out and saying that President Biden should step aside. 
 
HAYS:  I mean, I don't think he's ever going to meet the bar that people want him to meet. He's 81 years old but we can't make him any younger and I 
 
 think that's what people want from him right now. But what he can do is he can assure people that he can still do the job and I think that's what he 
 
 needs to do. 
 
A poll just came out today that he's still pretty even with Donald Trump, well within the margin of error. So, I think that, you know, he didn't lose 
 
 a lot in the polling and that was a recent poll that just came out today. 
 
GIOKOS:  Okay, so Republican convention next week where Donald Trump is expected to announce a vice president. I want to talk about the political 
 
 landscape whether it's going to shift next week and how that's going to perhaps add more pressure for Democrats to be decisive about a way forward, 
 
 whether to support President Biden or to figure out, you know, a way to solve this issue. 
 
HAYS:  Yeah, I mean, I think that the Democrats need to turn their message back on to Trump. They need to continue to be creating that contrast. They 
 
 need to continue to drive home to voters that he's been convicted of 34 felonies. 
 
He's trying to take your -- away, your different freedoms and different rights especially for women's health care. So, I just think that the 
 
 Republicans are going to be on display next week and they're going to be able to see that contrast. 
 
You know, in the debate he lied over 30 times. Donald Trump did. He lied over 30 times and we're not talking about that because we're talking about 
 
 Joe Biden's age which is the fault of the Democrats. So, we need to take back control of the message and we need to remind voters what a Trump 
 
 presidency looked like and what another presidency will look like. 
 
GIOKOS:  But here's the thing, Meghan, I mean the clock is absolutely ticking. Biden has to either convince that what we saw on the debate night 
 
 was just a once-off and that it won't happen again. What does he need to do to convince people within his own party to support him and to ensure that 
 
 the voters stick by his side? Because the walls are closing in and you're seeing a lot of criticism. That's the reality. So, what do you expect to 
 
 happen in the next month? 
 
HAYS:  I think you'll continue to see the president doing what he's been doing. I think he'll be talking to voters. I think he'll be out there. 
 
 He'll be doing more unscripted moments. But the fact of the matter is, as much as the Democrats want to complain and ask him to step aside, it's 
 
 ultimately his decision. 
 
So, if he doesn't want to step aside and that's not what he wants to do and he's made that clear, then I think the Democrats need to decide whether or 
 
 not they're going to fight Donald Trump or they're going to continue to fight on Joe Biden's age. And I think that every day that we spend talking 
 
 about Joe Biden's age is one less day we are talking about Donald Trump and the catastrophe that another four years of him will do. 
 
GIOKOS:  Yeah, and I totally understand that but you've got people within the party that have been focusing on, you know,  President Biden's age, his 
 
 abilities, mental acuity. 
 <br>[12:40:00]
 
These are like genuine concerns that are coming from within his party that are showing major fractures that are coming through. And then you have the 
 
 George Clooney op-ed which was a total bombshell. So, how much pressure -- okay. Hold -- okay, so Meghan, apologies. We've got Hakeem Jeffries in his 
 
 press conference. Let's listen in for a second there. 
 
(LIVE COVERAGE BEGINS)
 
REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY 8TH DISTRICT), U.S. HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  -- stakeholders may have to say about this matter. House Democrats, Senate 
 
 Democrats and President Biden are unified on the affirmative agenda that we have for the American people related to lowering housing costs or ending 
 
 price gouging or growing the middle class, defending democracy and fighting for reproductive freedom. President Biden, House Democrats and Senate 
 
 Democrats are also united in pushing back against Project 2025 and the extreme MAGA Republican agenda. That's unifying, not dividing us.
 
UNKNOWN:  President Biden has said he's staying in this race, but after your conversations throughout this week, do you think it's time for him to 
 
 reconsider that, based on what you're hearing? 
 
JEFFRIES:  Our conversations have been candid, comprehensive and clear-eyed and they are ongoing. 
 
UNKNOWN:  Leaser Jeffries, you said that--
 
JEFFRIES:  Hold on, hold on. Right there. You.
 
UNKNOWN:  Thank you, Leader Jeffries. I do want to ask, you have another frontliner coming out today, Congresswoman Hillary Scholten, calling for 
 
 Biden to step aside. You have Greg Landsman saying that he's coming closer to that conclusion. Are you worried that Biden is a liability for your most 
 
 vulnerable members? 
 
JEFFRIES:  No. 
 
UNKNOWN:  Do you think that Democrats still have to -- winning back the House for Biden to stay on top of the ticket?
 
JEFFRIES:  House Democrats will win back control of the House of Representatives on November 5th and vacate the extreme MAGA-Republican 
 
 majority, as long as we are able to clearly communicate our agenda of putting people over politics, lowering costs, growing the middle class, 
 
 defending fundamental freedoms and democracy, and contrast that with the extreme MAGA Republican agenda, which will destroy working families and the 
 
 middle-class way of life as we know it. Thanks.
 
UNKNOWN:  Do you believe Biden has made a final decision about whether to stay in the race?
 
JEFFRIES:  As I indicated, House Democrats are engaged in conversations with House Democrats at this moment in time. Those conversations have been 
 
 candid, clear-eyed and comprehensive, and that's important for us to do as a House Democratic caucus family. And as long as those conversations are 
 
 ongoing, I'm going to respect the sanctity of those conversations until we conclude that process.
 
UNKNOWN:  Thank you very much, Leader Jeffries, I want to ask about appropriations. The last time, the speaker's job was threatened because 
 
 your caucus that bailed him out gave him the support to survive and that was very important then in maintaining his job. In that context, what are 
 
 your priorities for the appropriations process that's underway and do you plan to use your leverage over the speaker to get some of your priorities 
 
 through and if not, then why not?
 
JEFFRIES:  In connection with the appropriations process, we've had no discussion about a theoretical or hypothetical motion to vacate. We take 
 
 every issue and evaluate it in a serious, substantive and sober fashion. That's before the Congress and that's what we'll continue to do. 
 
With respect to the current appropriations process, we've been very clear that in May of last year, House Democrats, Senate Democrats, House 
 
 Republicans and Senate Republicans, in partnership with President Biden, reached an agreement connected to the Bipartisan Fiscal Responsibility Act. 
 
That agreement, in this upcoming fiscal year, calls for a top-line spending number of 1681. The Republicans in the House right now are marking up an 
 
 appropriations bill at 1606. That means they are cutting $75 billion from their own agreement, reached with everyone else under the Capitol Dome and 
 
 President Joe Biden. 
 
(LIVE COVERAGE ENDS)
 
GIOKOS:  All right, we've been listening to Hakeem Jeffries, House Democratic leader, his weekly press conference and getting a lot of 
 
 questions about what kind of conversations have been going on between Democrats as calls for President Biden to step aside have increased over 
 
 the past few weeks after that debate. Still with us, we've got Meghan Hays. 
 <br>[12:45:00]
 
And Meghan, you've been hearing some of what Hakeem Jeffries has been saying and he said specifically that Democrats have been engaging in 
 
 candid, comprehensive and clear-eyed conversations, not revealing much more. What do you make of his messaging today?
 
HAYS:  I think that they are talking as a caucus of how they want to move forward. I think different members have different concerns. If you are a 
 
 member who's in a battleground state or you are a frontline member, you are going to have different concerns than members who are in California or New 
 
 York who are in relatively safe districts. 
 
So, I think when they are -- they are talking about that, they are having a conversation amongst themselves. He made it very clear that these were 
 
 candid conversations amongst House members. This wasn't candid conversations with House members in the White House. 
 
So, this is, you know, this is an internal conversation, it sounds like, from his point of view. But, you know, it is interesting. But I do think 
 
 that there are a lot of folks who have different points of view on this. And it'll be interesting to see how it unfolds. 
 
GIOKOS:  Yeah, I mean, let's be realistic, as well. He can't come out and say much before this very vital press conference that is meant to happen. 
 
 And that's important. I think everyone's going to be watching very closely. And that's the reality. And I was asking about George Clooney's bombshell 
 
 op-ed and the other voices that we're starting to hear coming through. How do you convince those people to support President Biden? 
 
HAYS:  Look, you know, I was talking to a member from Michigan yesterday and early this morning, and we were talking about the George Clooney op-ed. 
 
 And she very distinctly told me, you know, the people in my district don't care what George Clooney thinks. They care what their union leaders think 
 
 and what their community members think. So, I think that we need to zone in a little bit. All politics are local in the U.S. 
 
GIOKOS:  But what happens if funding dries up? What happens if a donor pulls out? How critical will that be? 
 
HAYS:  It's hugely critical. And I think that the campaign has made that very clear that having donations, you know, that is a critical part of our 
 
 of our financing and how we run elections. I think they have a lot of money cash on hand. I think they will just have to rework how they're spending. 
 
 But I don't necessarily think that it will -- it might dry up in the short term. It will not dry up in the long term. 
 
GIOKOS:  Meghan Hays, great to have you with us. Thank you so much for your insights.
 
HAYS:  Thank you. 
 
GIOKOS:  All right. And this reminder, CNN will have live coverage of President Biden's crucial news conference from the NATO summit in 
 
 Washington. It's been pushed back one hour to 6:30 P.M. Eastern Time, 11:30 P.M. London time. You can watch it right here on CNN. We'll be back right 
 
 after this short break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:49:45]
 
GIOKOS:  Kenya's president is promising to reform -- to form a new government. Earlier, William Ruto fired almost his entire cabinet. The 
 
 Kenyan leader has been at the center of a political firestorm in recent weeks over a controversial tax bill. 
 <br>[12:50:02]
 
Mr. Ruto chose to withdraw what's known as the finance bill at the end of June after violent clashes left dozens of protesters dead across the 
 
 country. CNN's Larry Madowo picks up the story from Nairobi. 
 
LARRY MADOWO CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Eleni, this is another major win for Kenyan youth getting President William Ruto to climb down and dissolve his 
 
 entire cabinet. When we were on the streets, they told us repeatedly they are fixing this country. They want to drain the swamp and one of the issues 
 
 has been corruption. 
 
This cabinet that President Ruto just fired was accused many members of the cabinet of corruption and they're celebrating that they managed to get the 
 
 entire cabinet fired except two people. The deputy president who's elected and the prime cabinet secretary, that is the chief minister, that people 
 
 want even more. Listen to some of the people we've been speaking to. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
UNKNOWN:  He has not done anything he promised he's going to do during his campaign. There's nothing he has done up to now. So, one of the things 
 
 that, we, as the Gen Z want Ruto to go home, literally. 
 
UNKNOWN:  Mr. President has shown himself to be very crafty for some reason so he doesn't have trust to a lot of people in this country. But if this is 
 
 going to be for the good cause, then we might give him a chance to redeem himself. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
MADOWO:  Eleni, what the Kenyan youth have accomplished here is extraordinary. These protests have already been discussed in parliaments in 
 
 Ghana, in Tanzania and there's people across the African continent watching to see how to hold their own governments accountable to see that the people 
 
 can surely get the government to listen to them but they're asking for so much more and they're saying if President William Ruto does not pay 
 
 attention to them, they want him to go. 
 
One of the hashtags, one of the rallying calls here has been Ruto must go and he's shown that he's paying attention, he's listening and he's trying 
 
 to make sure that he's responding to the people as the first line of the Kenyan Constitution says, we the people of Kenya and that's been a huge 
 
 celebration today and over these past few weeks as President Ruto has done more of the things that people have been asking him to do, Eleni. 
 
GIOKOS:  All right, Larry Madowo there in Nairobi for us. We're going to a short break, more news after this. Stay with CNN.

 <br>[12:54:36]
 
GIOKOS (voice over):  All right, happening right now, President Joe Biden and President Volodymyr Zelensky meeting at the NATO Summit. Let's listen 
 
 in. 
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Ukraine, this will be the eighth package I've authorized since we've signed a National Security Bill. 
 
 Secretary of Defense, we can talk about what the details of all that are. I signed it last night, I guess. And we're working with our NATO allies to 
 
 ensure Ukraine is flying F-16s this summer and show the world that we stand with Ukraine now and in the future. 
 <br>[12:55:04]
 
So, Mr. President, thank you again for being here. We've got a lot of work to do together. And I yield the floor to you.
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT:  Thank you so much. Mr. President, thank you very much for the invitation to the summit. And thank you for 
 
 such strong news about the new security package. I'm grateful to you, your team, your administration, of course, Congress, both parties, both 
 
 chambers, and all Americans for their vital and your strong support of Ukraine and Ukrainian people. 
 
Together, we are saving lives of our people. You mentioned about Kharkiv. Thanks to your support and thanks to our soldiers. Really, it was tough 
 
 work, but they did it. And together, we are preserving Ukraine's independence and freedom and historic actions that will protect the world 
 
 from similar wars. 
 
And I especially want to thank today, President Biden for his support and personal statement following the Russian strike on the children's hospital 
 
 in Kyiv. Yes, this is our largest children's hospital. It was direct hit by Russian missile. That is why we greatly appreciate your decisions to 
 
 strengthen our air defense, the five new batteries, and dozens of other systems. 
 
And we have -- and I want also to speak today how we can continue the support. And I also want to discuss, Mr. President, how we can quickly and 
 
 decisively stop Russian terror with this big problem for us, guided bombs. And, of course, we need some quick step -- some to lift all limitations for 
 
 our Ukrainian soldiers. 
 
And, of course, we are thankful for -- that you helped us to save our energy. It's tough period for people without energy. But anyway, we are 
 
 thankful to you and partners. And, of course, we will discuss achieving a just end to the war.
 
We must end this war justly and for peace to return as soon as possible. We need a second peace summit this year. Thank you for participation. And we 
 
 are counting heavily on America's support in this. God bless America. Slava Ukraine.
 
BIDEN:  We will stay with you, period. Thank you, press. 
 
ZELENSKY:  Thank you.
 
(LIVE COVERAGE ENDS)
