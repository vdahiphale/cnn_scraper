THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
<br>[16:00:15]   
 
PAULA NEWTON, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST: What a day for the markets, off the back of some wonky numbers. Producer price index, pleasing the markets 
 
 there. You can see the Dow, some of the highest for the day, up better than one percent. NASDAQ and the S&amp;P even more impressive than that.   
 
Those are the markets and these are the main events. Struggling Starbucks replaces its CEO with the man who turned around to pull it.   
 
UAW files federal labor charges against Donald Trump and Elon Musk for threatening striking workers.   
 
And a trip to the amusement park. Richard Quest finds out how Coney Island is trying to bring summer fun back to a new generation. That looks like 
 
 fun.   
 
Live from New York. It is Tuesday, August 13th. I'm Paula Newton, in for Richard Quest and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.   
 
And good evening.   
 
So, tonight, Starbucks' stock skyrocketed after the company named the former head of Chipotle, Brian Niccol, as its new CEO.   
 
Now Starbucks closed up about 24 percent again on some of the highs of the day there. One of the largest one day percentage gains since it went public 
 
 in 1992.   
 
Starbucks is balancing some big challenges as you can imagine and here they are. Let's start with consumers.   
 
You all know it, right? Cutting back on the spending for things like this, those iced coffees, then there are the increased cost, whether its labor, 
 
 products, supply chain disruptions also affecting Starbucks.   
 
This is the one that I find most intriguing though. I mean, look at this, bad store experience. I didn't know this before. Seventy percent of all the 
 
 orders from Starbucks or either on the app or in drive-thru, so that means people are looking for a place to just sit down aren't really finding it 
 
 when they need to.   
 
There is all also though, the issue here about the -- in the dissatisfied customers and this is a huge issue. They tried to bring on new products 
 
 like Oleato. Remember that? Olive oil in coffee, that didn't work. So many other things didn't as well.   
 
Now, Brian Niccol, he starts September 9th. I want to remind everyone that Starbucks' sales in North America are down since January, though back in 
 
 2021, he spoke to Richard Quest about his philosophy in running Chipotle and now what he might do at Starbucks.   
 
Listen to this from 2021.   
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)   
 
BRIAN NICCOL, CEO, CHIPOTLE: We feel like we still provide tremendous body of food, food with integrity, customized exactly how you want and you know, 
 
 we are fortunate that were in that position where we've got the strong value proposition that allows us to invest in our people, invest in our 
 
 food, and then ultimately invest in the experience of our customer, and we do it in a way that we think is reasonably priced.   
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)   
 
NEWTON: Nathaniel Meyersohn has been following this story for us in New York. In fact, you follow those bad results that Starbucks had, but we want 
 
 to talk now about Brian Niccol. He has succeeded where Starbucks has failed.   
 
In the first instance, many new products, right, that were a hit; secondly, though that digital focus, it really went viral at times with those who 
 
 counted which were those young customers also, of course, the advertising that was targeted and clever.   
 
And this is the one that always amazes me, the improved operations, right? The efficiency in those locations right down to taking the pit out of the 
 
 avocado. The result, the stock up more, better than 700 percent in six-and- a-half years.   
 
I will say though, Chipotle down last time I looked about seven or eight percent today. This is the reputational leverage of a proven CEO. Where 
 
 does he take it now?   
 
NATHANIEL MEYERSOHN, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: So Paula, you've really laid out both the challenges for Starbucks really well and the opportunity that 
 
 investors see with Brian Niccol coming on board.   
 
I mean the stock move kind of tells it -- tells the whole story, doesn't it? Twenty-five percent increase for Starbucks with Chipotle down about 
 
 eight percent.   
 
So investors are very pleased right now and the reason that Niccol is coming on is because that Starbucks is really struggling. People are not 
 
 paying five, six dollars for an iced coffee. On the other hand, they are paying $15.00 for a burrito bowl, and so it really shows that people don't 
 
 think that Starbucks is providing value as much, while Chipotle under Brian Niccol is.   
 <br>[16:05:01]   
 
So that's going to be a big part of the challenge, how to kind of restore the customer perception of Starbucks?   
 
NEWTON: Yes, and it is an absolutely massive challenge given the economic environment we find ourselves in and what does it tell you about consumers 
 
 right now and their spending on fast food in a broader sense, right? Because everyone is looking for both value and affordability.   
 
MEYERSOHN: Well, I think that it is telling that the Chipotle is one of the few fast food and restaurant industry companies to be doing very well right 
 
 now. Its sales were up 11 percent last quarter. Meanwhile, Starbucks sales down about three percent, so customers are been very discerning about where 
 
 they are going.   
 
So even though Chipotle is more expensive, $15.00 compared to you know, five, six dollars, customers feel like it is a better value, a better way 
 
 to stretch their dollar.   
 
And you know, you made an interesting point earlier about how Starbucks has really gone from being a sit-down cafe or a coffee shop to a place now that 
 
 is more like fast food. You order on the app, then you leave.   
 
So Niccol is going to have some interesting challenges as well with trying to kind of recreate a better in-store experience. People are frustrated 
 
 with the long waits on the app. So this is just kind of a fascinating trend we are seeing right now.   
 
Certainly, a surprise waking up to this this morning.   
 
NEWTON: It really did shock investors, right? And we are not shocked all that often.   
 
Nathaniel, before you go Chipotle? Starbucks? Neither or both?   
 
MEYERSOHN: You know, I think that it is all about value, Paula. You know, people really feel like you're getting money, you're getting good value, 
 
 you're full when you go to Chipotle versus coffee kind of a commodity. You have so -- you can go to boutique coffee shops. You can make it at home.   
 
You know, I am trying to save some money five, six dollars for an iced coffee. I don't even want to know how much your team spent on that -- all 
 
 of those drinks at Starbucks.   
 
NEWTON: I am sure they figured out some point system or a discount, but yes, this sets you back. I won't say exactly how much because it is 
 
 different in every state and every location, but quite a bit.   
 
Nathaniel, you are a smart man. We know that. Looking for the value. Thank you very much for following this breaking story for us.   
 
Meantime, US wholesale inflation rose less than expected in July. The producer price index was up 2.2 percent on an annual basis, a slight 
 
 decrease compared to June. Now, it is sign that price pressures are easing for businesses.   
 
The hope now though, is that those savings will be passed on to shoppers. The latest consumer price index comes out tomorrow. That is an all-
 
 important report. Our Julia Chatterley will be following all of it.   
 
And again, it is so much about this cup of iced coffee, isn't it? We really have seen that inflation has come down, but this really did quiet the 
 
 markets, these numbers. Do they really believe they are going to get what they want tomorrow with that all-important CPI number?   
 
JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR, "FIRST MOVE": You raise such an important point. Once again, one data point like this shouldn't have the 
 
 enormous positive reaction in the stock markets that we saw today, Paula, and you know that as well as I. But what this did seem to confirm to people 
 
 was that the disinflation, so slower rising prices trend that were seeing, whether it is at the factory gate or for consumers is still in trend.   
 
And if you look at the bond markets today, they are still saying look, Federal Reserve certainly going to cut at least a quarter of a percentage 
 
 point in September, and really that is all the confirmation I think that certainly investors needed.   
 
For consumer price inflation, we are not expecting to see the same kind of drop. But the hope is that again, that disinflationary trend is in play, a 
 
 three percent annualized rate is expected tomorrow. That is for the headline number. For the core number, if you strip out energy, you strip 
 
 out food prices, that is expected to come in at around 3.2 percent.   
 
If that is what we got, Paula, you can expect, I think another huge rally in the stock markets, the expectation of course, reconfirmed once again, 
 
 even on one data point that the Federal Reserve is expected to cut in September.   
 
But for ordinary consumers out there, I understand why they look at these numbers and they are like, tell me why I should care when prices are up -- 
 
 what -- on average 20 percent over the last four years? I think we've got a chart that I want to just give you a look at, which looks at some of the 
 
 price rises for these things over the past two years.   
 
Transportation costs up 18 percent, electricity costs up 10 percent; shelter, which is going to be the big thing that we watch tomorrow because 
 
 that is a third of the number, the hope is that that continues to come down.   
 
But, hey, people are paying for mortgage or rent equivalent 13 percent more than they were paying two years ago.   
 
Paula, that is super painful.   
 
And took to finish where you sort of started there on the coffee thing. I would pay zero for olive oil coffee, whoever had that idea. I mean, really.   
 
NEWTON: It really was an epic fail and I turned to my Italian --   
 
CHATTERLEY: Epic.   
 <br>[16:10:01]   
 
NEWTON: I turned my Italian roots on this coffee, olive oil? No, not a thing, ever, and apparently they learned that the hard way.   
 
Julia, we will be looking to see what that report tells us tomorrow as you continue to follow all of that. Appreciate it. Thanks so much.   
 
NEWTON: Thank you.   
 
NEWTON: Coming up for us, a live report from Tel Aviv as Hamas and Israel make a last-ditch effort to revive stalled negotiations.   
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)   
 
NEWTON: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Ukrainian troops are continuing to advance into Russian territory. He says they now control more 
 
 than 70 settlements in the Kursk Region after days of intense fighting. He also referenced their capture of Russian prisoners of war.   
 
Russian President Vladimir Putin meantime is vowing to "kick the enemy out." The incursion is a first by foreign troops since World War II, and of 
 
 course, a major embarrassment for the Kremlin.   
 
Fred Pleitgen is tracking this story for us and he joins us now live from Berlin.   
 
Fred, you like me, I am sure are wondering, do we have a sense of what Putin's next move might be here given all that has transpired in the last 
 
 few days?   
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, he has vowed massive retaliation, but I think one of the things that we are seeing 
 
 from the Russians is that they want to bring troops in place to try and hold the Ukrainians up first and foremost.   
 
We just saw some of that video of apparently some Russian reinforcements that have been arriving. Apparently, a Ukrainian general said today that 
 
 they have been also observing on the southern front in Ukraine that some Russian the forces seem to be deployed from there to then move toward the 
 
 Kursk Region.   
 
Now, the Ukrainians are saying it is not very many forces yet, and it is not going to cause the Russians to be any weaker on the southern front in 
 
 Ukraine, but it is certainly something that they have been noticing that the Russians seem to be trying, pulling forces away from certain areas to 
 
 try and strengthen or beef up their forces that they have in the Kursk Region.   
 
As the Ukrainians really too many people surprised, do appear to still very much be on the move. The Russians today having to evacuate further regions 
 
 closer to the town, of course, which is, now, we pointed this out yesterday, Paula, a big military hub for the Russians at a logistics center 
 
 also for their war in Ukraine.   
 
So, the Russians certainly seem to have some issues, and then the Ukrainians are wondering what could that retaliation look like? There is 
 
 one Ukrainian official who believes that it could be a massive missile barrage that could hit Ukrainian cities in the not-too-distant future, and 
 
 they believe that their air defenses could have serious problems with it, but they do believe that it will hold.   
 
Now, all of this as the Russians are already saying they are trying to push the Ukrainians back, but it certainly seems to be difficult for them. Here 
 
 is what we are learning.   
 <br>[16:15:10]   
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)   
 
PLEITGEN (voice over): A Russian attack gunship firing at Ukrainian forces from the air in the Kursk Region inside Russia, while on the ground, a 
 
 Russian soldier's bodycam records would appear to be several killed Ukrainians near their destroyed armored vehicle.   
 
The Kremlin trying to show its forces are halting Ukraine's advances, but the reality is this, more Russian civilians having to evacuate their towns 
 
 and villages as Kyiv's troops press ahead.   
 
(UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE speaking in foreign language.)   
 
PLEITGEN (voice over): "We left the chickens at home," this woman says. We gave them two bags of grain, some water and left. Maybe there will be 
 
 nothing to return to.   
 
What seemed to be Russian prisoners of war transported in a Ukrainian pickup as a Ukrainian soldier spray paints the Ukrainian spelling of a 
 
 towns name inside Russia.   
 
Kyiv's lightning offensive caught not just its allies off guard, but Moscow as well. Russian President Vladimir Putin trying to publicly brush off 
 
 Ukraine's incursion, meeting with the head of the Palestinian Authority in Moscow after earlier berating his generals to oust Kyiv's troops from 
 
 Russian soil.   
 
VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): The main task for the Ministry of Defense is, of course, to drive and squeeze the enemy out 
 
 of our territories.   
 
PLEITGEN (voice over): Russia has vowed a massive retaliation and Kyiv fears Moscow could launch even larger missile strikes at Ukrainian cities, 
 
 but Ukraine's president vowing not to back down.   
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Russia needs to be forced into peace especially if Putin is so set on fighting.   
 
PLEITGEN (voice over): And Vladimir Putin's grip on power may not be as strong as some believe, Russian opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza who 
 
 was recently released from a Russian jail in a prisoner swap said on CNN's "Out Front."   
 
VLADIMIR KARA-MURZA, ACTIVIST: I don't only think, I don't only believe, I know that Russia will change that I will be back in my homeland and as I 
 
 told you, it is going to be much quicker than you ever think.   
 
PLEITGEN (voice over): But for now, Moscow says it will bring more reinforcements to its southwestern regions to try and oust Ukraine's 
 
 invasion force before it can dig in.   
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)   
 
PLEITGEN (on camera): It is interesting, Paula, we also heard a little bit more from the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He said the 
 
 Ukrainians were conducting in the areas that they've taken from the Russian stabilization measures, which could mean keeping services up and running 
 
 for the people who actually remain there when the Ukrainian military moved in.   
 
But he also said that Ukraine is preparing its next steps in that region as well. Unclear what that is. And one are those Ukrainian forces are going to 
 
 try and dig in and hold that area -- Paula.   
 
NEWTON: Yes, every day, the developments on this continue to be startling.   
 
Fred Pleitgen for us from Berlin. Thanks so much.   
 
Now, we are seeing more fighting along the Israel-Lebanon border as the Middle East remains on edge. The Israeli military says the Air Force killed 
 
 two Hezbollah fighters who were in an observation post in Southern Lebanon. It also says Hamas fired two rockets towards Israel.   
 
All of this comes as Gaza ceasefire talks are scheduled to resume Thursday and Israeli families hope to get their loved ones released finally by 
 
 Hamas.   
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)   
 
AVIVA SIEGEL, FORMER HOSTAGE OF HAMAS, HUSBAND STILL HELD: I'm begging the world, please let it happen. I am begging the world. I don't -- I can't 
 
 even imagine what will happen if it will fall apart because I will fall apart, and so many people who fall apart. We are waiting and waiting and 
 
 we've been waiting for so long.   
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)   
 
NEWTON: Joining us now from Tel Aviv is Nic Robertson.   
 
Nic, I am so glad that we highlight whether its Gaza or the families of the hostages, because every time we talk about these ceasefire talks, sometimes 
 
 we need to continue to keep the attention on what hangs in the balance.   
 
CNN is now learning from us officials that Iran hasn't decided yet whether or not to retaliate, how it will retaliate that coming from US officials 
 
 and yet President Biden himself, really being clear that he is trying to do two things here -- trying to get that ceasefire deal, but also perhaps 
 
 trying to ward off that retaliation from Iran.   
 
I mean, where do you things stand now from what you've been learning?   
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: So that concern about what Iran may do in the coming days even before the talks or even after the 
 
 talks is really the sort of big issue that hangs over the talks. In the context of the talks themselves, they were initiated, the diplomatic drive 
 
 to have them was to try to get Iran to resist a retaliatory strike against Israel for the killing of Hamas chief, Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.   
 <br>[16:20:01]   
 
But the talks are also a test and holding the talks about Gaza, because Ismail Haniyeh was a principal negotiator who, you know, who would meet 
 
 with the mediators in Doha and in Egypt, and now, he is gone. Hamas' initial response, according to diplomats was that they just weren't going 
 
 to get into negotiations for a long period of time.   
 
So to kill Ismail Haniyeh and then have talks two weeks later would be something of a sign of hope that because it would start the talks, but 
 
 Hamas has been very clear about this so far.   
 
Their engagement in these talks and remembering these are proximity talks, they are not in the same room as Israel, but their engagement is dependent 
 
 on Israel not treating this as a negotiation, but this is Hamas' position, not adding things to what President Biden, the framework that he outlined 
 
 in July that this would simply be implementing that framework and just putting some detail, additional detail on the framework. Israel of course, 
 
 is saying that it hasn't been adding additional items to that framework.   
 
So even the context around the talks is fraught. Therefore, the diplomatic signal that it sends to Iran is not the ideal diplomatic signal because it 
 
 is not clear if the talks will have meaning, if they'll progress, if they will be any different to previous talks.   
 
And therefore, Iran's own calculation about whether it should respond to Israel, they say killing Ismail Haniyeh, then for them, what's the point in 
 
 waiting for the talks if the talks are not going to provide peace in Gaza, which was the predicated concept that Israel -- that Iran might buy into.   
 
It is so fraught, so many pressures, so complicated at the moment because this whole other layer has been added into this process.   
 
NEWTON: Yes, and we continue to wait there hour by hour, minute, many wondering exactly what the next step will be here in both, whether or not 
 
 Iran will retaliate, and of course, those ceasefire talks.   
 
Nic Robertson for us in Tel Aviv. Thanks so much.   
 
Meantime, now the weather seems to be cooperating in Greece as firefighters continue to put down hotspots near Athens, but strong winds are expected 
 
 unfortunately to pick up again on Wednesday, on top of high temperatures and drought with no rain in sight.   
 
At least one person was killed after wildfires broke out on Sunday. Thousands have had to leave their homes with one person saying, you just 
 
 couldn't see, you couldn't breathe.   
 
There is now an international effort underway to help stamp out the flame. CNN correspondent, Eleni Giokos is near Athens. She has been on the ground 
 
 all day for us.   
 
Eleni, good to have you.   
 
I mean, look, these fires have been absolutely terrifying. I am glad to see that there was a break in the weather, but what is the challenge ahead for 
 
 those suburbs outside Athens?   
 
ELENI GIOKOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I mean, it was such an incredible day today. I mean, just speaking to some of the people that have been impacted, 
 
 people that lost their homes, their businesses, the devastation and the pain and the trauma that comes with that, Paula, the inability for even us 
 
 as a team to breathe properly while we were on the ground. It is just literally from every perspective, really, really tough because this is the 
 
 aftermath.   
 
This is sort of after the fact, off the wildfire. What is really good and you can see, I am outside and right now, you can see a view of Athens. 
 
 There is absolutely no wind and this is going to be absolutely important to ensure that no new fire breaks out.   
 
They were able to get rid of all the active fires early this morning. There are no active fires right now. We saw so many firefighting trucks that were 
 
 trying to douse out potential risk areas. And as you know, when there are wildfires, the wood continues to burn and then if there is a pickup in 
 
 wind, that could then reignite into areas that have not been burned.   
 
So that is what is being monitored right now. There is still a fire alerts are. Thousands of people have evacuated their homes. Some people were 
 
 allowed to return today and many people got back to just absolute devastation and so that's the scenario that we are dealing with.   
 
I mean, what tomorrow will bring, firefighters and the fire department are very hopeful that it will remain this quiet in terms of what we see on the 
 
 wind front.   
 
But if that does change, Paula, we are talking about other probabilities. We spoke to some people on the ground. Take a listen.   
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)   
 
GIOKOS (voice over): As morning breaks in Greece, a moment of reckoning, residents return to their homes, not knowing what they'd find.   
 
Seventy-year-old, Sakis Morfis (ph) ran away taking only his beloved dogs. Everything else is now gone.   
 
SAKIS MORFIS, LOST HOUSE IN FIRE (through translator): My house. It was utterly destroyed. Even the walls fell down.   
 <br>[16:25:04]   
 
GIOKOS (voice over): But Morfis lost more than his home. He also lost a colleague, a 65-year-old woman who went missing after the evacuation 
 
 orders.   
 
GIOKOS (on camera): Her friends and colleagues say that they were looking for her. She went missing and eventually her body was found here at a place 
 
 of work.   
 
She spent over 20 years of her life at this business and her co-workers are saying how she was talking about going back to her home country, back to 
 
 her daughters at the end of this year and sadly, they say she just didn't make it.   
 
And today, we find a rose left here by someone that says will remember her dearly.   
 
GIOKOS (voice over): More than 700 firefighters, almost 200 vehicles and 35 water bombing aircraft have now managed to control the blaze. But 100,000 
 
 acres of land were lost. The extent of the damage so great, it can be seen from space.   
 
As scenario of destruction just a few miles from Athens. Experts say, the last few years of fires are drastically changing the city's climate. The 
 
 loss of trees making winds and temperatures rise along with the risk of fire. A tough challenge ahead, local officials are well aware of.   
 
MAYOR VASILIS XYPOLITAS, KIFISIA : At some point, the fire was faster than the cars and the trucks, and they are trying to catch the fire. We must 
 
 find solutions in the way of evacuating and in being first at the time of a started fire.   
 
GIOKOS (voice over): Miles of beautiful green virgin forests reduced to charred barren hills.   
 
For residents like Sofia (ph), the feeling of loss is beyond words.   
 
SOFIA, LOCAL RESIDENT: I feel terrible. I can't explain how I feel this morning. We had thought green oasis here. Now I don't know after how many 
 
 years it is going to be again. And if it be like before.   
 
GIOKOS (voice over): Many like her now point the finger at the government, blaming the lack of prevention and care as part of the fuel feeding the 
 
 fire that spared nothing in its path.   
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)   
 
GIOKOS (on camera): And so many questions, some residents were saying, you know, how is it possible that a fire 40 kilometers away from Athens was 
 
 able to rip through various suburbs without any way to contain it? Some people blame the government, others say it is because of climate change and 
 
 the strong winds that we saw.   
 
But a lot of questions, Paula, are being asked and I have to say, every year we cover these stories and I've been on the ground every single year 
 
 since 2021 covering wildfires. There is resentment and the big question is, could the government be doing more?   
 
NEWTON: Yes, it does bring up the question, Eleni, about whether or not there needs to be rapid reaction forces, right? Clearly, throughout Europe 
 
 who can deal with this. As you've said, you have been there year after year and some harrowing images and again, so much trauma to contend with there.   
 
Eleni Giokos for us, really appreciate you being there.   
 
Now, the United Auto Workers has filed a labor complaint over Donald Trump's talk with Elon Musk on X last night. It alleges their anti-union 
 
 comments amount to worker intimidation. We will have that next.

 <br>[16:31:53]
 
NEWTON: Hello, I'm Paula Newton. There's more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in a moment when the jewelry giant Pandora posted strong quarterly results. We

 that, the headlines this hour. 
 
Thousands of doctors across India are on strike after the rape and murder of a trainee medic. They are demanding better protection for health care 
 
 workers. The woman killed was a doctor doing her residency at a hospital in Calcutta. Police have arrested one suspect and protesters are now calling

Tropical Storm Ernesto is gaining strength in the Caribbean and heading now towards Puerto Rico. The Leeward Islands in the Caribbean are expected to 
 
 get up to six inches or 15 centimeters of rain. Puerto Rico meantime could see up to 10 inches or 25 centimeters of rain by Thursday. 
 
Boeing received more orders last month than its main competitor Airbus. The troubled U.S. plane-maker took in 72 gross orders in July. Airbus reported 
 
 59. Now on delivery, though, also another matter. Boeing says those are down 29 percent compared to the first half of last year. 
 
The United Auto Workers is accusing Donald Trump and Elon Musk of trying to intimidate unions during their conversation on X. Now it filed federal 
 
 labor charges over comments like this one from the former president. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP (R), U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You, you're the greatest cutter. I mean, I look at what you do. You walk in, you just say, you want 
 
 to quit? They go on strike. I won't mention the name of the company, but they go on strike, and you say, that's OK, you're all gone. You're all 
 
 gone. So everyone of your is gone. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NEWTON: Now, to be clear, it's illegal for employers to fire striking workers in the United States. UAW president Shawn Fain called their 
 
 conversation, quote, "disgusting, illegal, and totally predictable." The union has now endorsed Kamala Harris for president. 
 
Kristen Holmes is following this story for us. 
 
Kristen, of all things that I expected to come out of this X conversation, this was not one of them. I mean, what is this about? And if the charges go 
 
 forward, what kind of punishment could we possibly see? 
 
KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, I do you want to give a little bit of context here, Paula, because it's not as though UAW and 
 
 Donald Trump had a good relationship before these comments. Not only had they endorsed President Joe Biden and now Kamala Harris, they have -- they 
 
 being Shawn Fain and Donald Trump -- have a pretty aggressively negative relationship. 
 
Both of them have routinely lashed out at one another. So Donald Trump and not surprisingly his campaign has put out this statement in response to 
 
 that lawsuit. They say this frivolous lawsuit is a shameless political stunt intended to erode President Trump's overwhelming support among 
 
 American workers. 
 
Then they go on and to say, Democrats' special interest bosses may lie and stoke fear to try and stop President Trump from creating the broadest 
 
 coalition of any candidate in history. But rank-and-file workers and their families know the truth. 
 <br>[16:35:09]
 
The reason why this really matters in addition to obviously some kind of legal ramifications which we just aren't sure how this is going to play out 
 
 is the fact that Donald Trump really sees himself as someone who is able to court these rank-and-file union members. The actual working class. It's 
 
 actually part of the reason that he brought J.D. Vance onto his ticket. 
 
Now, if you look at Donald Trump's record with labor, most labor experts say it's not really that great, but Donald Trump is reaching out to these 
 
 rank-and-file numbers on something different. It's not just about labor unions or labor in general. It's about the economy as a whole. Donald 
 
 Trump's team believes that they can reach out and touch these rank-and-file members by talking about inflation, by talking about the current state of 
 
 the economy, 401k's, grocery prices, gas prices. 
 
And they have seen some movement there. We've even seen from leadership in some of these different unions admitting that a lot of the rank-and-file 
 
 members vote differently or break from the union when it comes to supporting Donald Trump. So these kind of comments which seemed to be 
 
 attacking the actual workers are not helpful for the former president, but it's unsurprising given the fact that Donald Trump was really in a 
 
 freewheeling two-hour conversation with Elon Musk where they talked about almost anything. 
 
And the problem with this, when you talk to some of Donald Trump's allies, which I've spent the day doing, is that you're going to get comments like 
 
 these off-the-cuff comments that could be detrimental in the long run to Donald Trump's supporters and voters. The same people that he's trying to 
 
 reach. 
 
NEWTON: Yes. And that's the whole thing that you've pointed out so well. Two things can be true at once. The leadership at war with Donald Trump, 
 
 but then he is with certain segments of the unionized labor movement quite popular. 
 
Kristen Holmes, again, thank you so much. Really appreciate it. 
 
Now, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris is set to make her economic pitch at a North Carolina rally this Friday. Her campaign says it will center around 
 
 lowering costs and taking on corporate price gouging. Now, Harris spoke in favor of eliminating taxes on tips at a rally in Nevada last week. You will 
 
 remember former president Donald Trump had already proposed that in June and his campaign is accusing Harris of stealing his ideas. 
 
CNN economics commentator Catherine Rampell calls it a terrible policy no matter who is proposing it. She says both parties need to stop bribing 
 
 voters with tax cuts. And Catherine joins us now to take on this question. 
 
You know what I'm going to say to that. I'm like, they're trying to bribe voters. OK. Well, the sky is sometimes blue, but let's get down to the 
 
 actual details on this. And I think that a lot of people make good points when they say, if you are a warehouse worker for Amazon making $20,000 a 
 
 year you don't get any tips. You pay $2300 in federal taxes. If you make $20,000 a year and you make those tips, you can -- you don't have tax on 
 
 them, you might only owe 1,000 bucks on your taxes. It's not a fair policy by any measure. 
 
CATHERINE RAMPELL, CNN ECONOMICS AND POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Yes. I think one of the many concerns I have with this policy proposal is equity, that 
 
 there's nothing inherently more valuable to society, let's say, that comes from serving as a waitress versus as a bus driver or in your example, you 
 
 know, a warehouse worker. You know, these are all important, noble jobs, but that doesn't mean that some subset of them should essentially go 
 
 untaxed. 
 
And that is one of the problems with this proposal. Another one that is easy to foresee is that it will lead to much more reclassification of 
 
 income as tips. You know I should be paid in tips, you should be paid in tips, and I'm sure a clever enough accountant could figure out a way to do 
 
 that and stay on the right side of the law, and thereby have our earnings exempt from income and payroll taxes, depending on which person is 
 
 proposing this idea. 
 
So there are a lot of distortions here. There are many better ways to help people with low incomes, I'll put it that way, whatever profession they are 
 
 in than saying some subset of them don't have to pay taxes. 
 
NEWTON: And when we talk about what's better obviously Kamala Harris trying to improve with voters on the economy. She's going to release this economic 
 
 policy. What are you looking for? 
 
RAMPELL: I'll be looking for a few different things. In general I'm interested in her tax proposals beyond this idea to exempt tips from 
 
 taxation. Does she stick, for example, to Joe Biden's pledge to not raise taxes on anyone making under $400,000 since depending on how that is 
 
 interpreted, it does really limit the options for what might lie ahead. 
 <br>[16:40:05]
 
There's going to be a huge food fight over the tax code next year when a large portion of it expires. So whether we're talking about individual tax 
 
 rates, corporate tax rates, very interested to see what she says on that. Republicans obviously want the corporate tax rates to go down. Democrats 
 
 are looking for it to go up. What is her proposal on that front, as well as things on tariffs. 
 
Democrats and Republicans have had sort of mixed messages on the wisdom of protectionism. They don't like it when the other party does it but they're 
 
 more than happy to impose tariffs when they are in charge or to preserve tariffs for that matter when they are in charge. Biden and Harris has been 
 
 very critical of Trump's tariff policies and yet they kept almost all of his tariffs in place once Biden got into the White House. 
 
So those things will be of interest to me. And also more generally, how does she talk about the economy. This has been really challenging for 
 
 Democrats today to figure out the right balance for celebrating the wins. And there are quite a few of them. Job market looks very strong and has 
 
 defied expectations, for example. How do they talk about that good news while not sounding tone deaf, given that American consumers and voters are 
 
 still obviously very grumpy about the economy and don't view it particularly good. So those are among the things that I will be paying 
 
 attention to. 
 
NEWTON: Yes. And as you said, the messaging really does matter here in terms of what voters are going to hear. It is such a good point. 
 
Catherine Rampell, we'll have you back once she comes out with that policy. Thanks so much. Appreciate it. 
 
Now Pandora is defying a stagnant jewelry market, raising its outlook for the second time this year. The jeweler is benefiting from a wider range of 
 
 products. Pandora CEO Alexander Lacik joins me next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
NEWTON: The CEO of Pandora says the jewelry market remains stagnant, but that didn't stop his company from reporting strong quarterly results. You 
 
 see the stock up there. Almost 3 percent after the jeweler raised its outlook for the second time this year. It's expecting to grow between 9 
 
 percent and 12 percent in 2024. CEO Alexander Lacik says Pandora is successfully becoming a full jewelry brand. 
 <br>[16:45:01]
 
The company's broader range of products appear to have helped the bottom line, I'll say. Pandora CEO Alexander Lacik is with us now from London. 
 
Thanks so much for being with us. You know, many want to know your secret here, right, in terms of the strategy because it clearly tends to be 
 
 working from what we can see from your results. And I want to point out, this is purely a discretionary spend. Perhaps you would argue differently, 
 
 but no one needs the charm or the bracelet or the necklace. 
 
ALEXANDER LACIK, CEO, PANDORA: I mean, that is true. As much as I would love people to need to wear jewelry, that's probably not the case, so it is 
 
 a discretionary category. There's maybe one side to it where the jewelry category at large, not just Pandora, is also used for gifting. And people 
 
 kind of keep gifting on birthdays and other occasions. So that's probably the need aspect of it, but fundamentally, it is a discretionary category. 
 
And I think one of the reasons Pandora has been doing well in the recent years, it's not just the last quarter, is that we keep investing in a great 
 
 experience with the brand. We have a clear positioning. We stand for something quite unique I think in the jewelry space. And more and more 
 
 consumers are realizing this and coming forth and interacting with us, and sort of fundamental driver of our success so far is essentially built on 
 
 getting more people engaged in the brand. So this is a traffic game for us. 
 
NEWTON: It was quite a risk, though, when you think about expanding, especially that jewelry brand and getting into more and more types of 
 
 jewelry. You know, the other thing I found interesting here is that most of the sales happen in person. That can also be a tough sell. What does that 
 
 experience like or what are you trying to make that experience like for consumers? 
 
LACIK: So if you take a step back and think about what the category does for consumers or the reasons why people buy or consume jewelry as it were, 
 
 you can simplify this by saying there are two main drivers of why you would entertain this category. One would be to use jewelry as a part of your 
 
 styling. So let's assume that you buy a new piece of clothing, a bag, or shoes and whatnot, and then you want to kind of add a little spark to that 
 
 with a styling accessory which would be jewelry in this case. 
 
So that's one of the kind of reasons why you entered the category. The other reason would be when you're looking to commemorate something that's 
 
 really important for you. And we call that jewelry that has a particular meaning to you. Normally, I used my wedding ring as a great example. Of 
 
 course, not a particularly fanciful piece of jewelry but the affection I have to this is very high. So the emotional kind of connection I have with 
 
 this piece of jewelry is important to me. 
 
Most brands are kind of positioned on the styling side of things whereas Pandora has chosen to play on jewelry with the meaning so we're a little 
 
 bit on our own in that space and this is incredibly important that you cannot try to own something that's unique about a brand because it is a 
 
 very, very fragmented market with lots of choice for consumers to stand out and do something that's important for consumers is an important thing for 
 
 any brand really. 
 
And I think Pandora has managed to carve out a very nice position, which seems to resonate with many, many people across the globe. 
 
NEWTON: Yes, you really, and especially when you point out things like a wedding ring and engagement ring, you're really pointing to the 
 
 sentimentality of it. And as you said, that lends to the experience at least your results prove that they do. 
 
Can I talk to you more broadly about consumers? Consumers that may be looking for lower price points, more value? I mean, what has your company 
 
 been seeing? 
 
LACIK: So let's say, so first of all, the last few years has really put all consumers to the test. And I'm now not talking about the ultra-rich people, 
 
 but you know, the middle of the market, which is the segment that we are focusing on, that's also where the largest volumes in the jewelry space are 
 
 being sold. So, you know, we've gone through the pandemic then we have interest rates and recession and inflation and all of those good things. 
 
All of that has essentially put a pressure on the discretionary spend. And as we just said a minute ago, it is a discretionary category. So the pie 
 
 has somehow not been growing as it used to do. Pre-pandemic the jeweler category globally was kind of growing at 3 percent to 4 percent. So 
 
 essentially two times GDP as a kagar for the last 10 years or so. 
 
Post the pandemic, what we see globally is essentially that on a good day, I would say that the jewelry category is flat. I think maybe it's new 
 
 trading a couple of points negative in the last two years, which I think is a sign that the discretionary spend in that cohort is under pressure. 
 <br>[16:50:01]
 
So you have to work harder to essentially pull people into brands. And in these type of categories people simply have a little bit less money to 
 
 spend. So I do think that, you know, having a clear brand idea, offering great value when people are a little bit under pressure, those are 
 
 important aspects of any brand that is trying to succeed in this type of environment. 
 
NEWTON: Well, they certainly are impressive results and we will continue to follow their progress. 
 
Alexander Lacik, thanks so much. Really appreciate it. 
 
And I do want to clarify that these share price that we put up earlier is the American depository receipts and not to the European share price. 
 
Now, only a few weeks left to enjoy summer here in New York. So why not take a trip that Coney Island? He didn't take me. Can you imagine? Richard 
 
 Quest rode the famous Wonder Wheel with its owner. That's next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
NEWTON: And there it is and all its glory, glorious day here I have to say. New York. There you have it, known for skyscrapers and of course some 
 
 crowded streets. It is busy, a busy afternoon, summer afternoon here in New York. When you go over to Brooklyn, though, Coney Island offers a bit of an 
 
 escape from all of this. It's home to one of the most famous boardwalks in the United States along with games, rides, and yes, wacky sideshows. 
 
Wouldn't even know you're that close to New York. Look at that beautiful beach shot. It's also known for the Wonder Wheel, which was built more than 
 
 a century ago. Now the Vourderis family has owned the park for generations. Deno Vourderis is the latest to carry on that legacy and Richard Quest 
 
 joined him for a ride on his Wonder Wheel. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DENO VOURDERIS, CO-OWNER, DENO'S WONDER WHEEL AMUSEMENT PARK: This is the jewel of Coney Island right here. 
 
RICHARD QUEST, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Right. 
 
VOURDERIS: That's the Wonder Wheel. It's 104 years old, but it's not a Ferris Wheel. It's an eccentric Ferris Wheel because it's part Ferris 
 
 Wheel, part roller coaster. It's part of the whole Coney Island, United States ingenuity. 
 
QUEST: What is the attraction to it, do you think? 
 
VOURDERIS: I mean, it's full of history. It means -- what makes the Wonder Wheel so special is it means different things to different people. It could 
 
 be a first date. It could be a proposal. It could be an anniversary. It's the most romantic ride in the world. And in 1920 it was the most thrilling 
 
 ride in the world. 
 <br>[16:55:01]
 
QUEST: Are you looking to a good summer this year? What's your gut telling you, Deno? 
 
VOURDERIS: My gut is telling me that people need, not want, people need a place to unwind. I mean, we're always looking down on our devices. We're 
 
 not actually living anymore. So I think places like Coney Island are essential businesses. 
 
QUEST: People meet here. 
 
VOURDERIS: People meet here. My grandparents used to date right on the beach out here in 1948. 
 
QUEST: And you sir, you sir, follow me around, tell me what your --- come in. What's your history? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My parents met here on the beach. 
 
QUEST: Your parents met here on the beach? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They lived here in Brooklyn and they would take the train in. They came as two groups of friends and they met right here on 
 
 this beach. 
 
VOURDERIS: 1920, we have the Coney Island's oldest attraction. When COVID came by, everybody was cutting and running, we doubled down. We opened 
 
 Coney Island's newest attraction because you either believe in what you're doing or you don't. 
 
QUEST: OK. 
 
VOURDERIS: And we believe in this place. We believe in its future. 
 
QUEST: Right. Should we go on this? 
 
VOURDERIS: I mean, I'm ready. Are you ready? 
 
QUEST: I mean -- 
 
VOURDERIS: We haven't killed anybody. Let's go. 
 
QUEST: OK. Let's go then. 
 
VOURDERIS: You know about salt water corrosion. Yes. We're constantly repainting, we're constantly resurfacing, we're constantly x-raying all 
 
 these pieces of metal and make sure there's no cracks. That's some new stuff that's been around now, but the Wonder Wheel has definitely stood the 
 
 test of time. I'm not going to tell you when it's going to swing. We're just going to keep talking and we'll see what happens. You don't have to 
 
 hold on. Hands up. 
 
QUEST: No. I -- 
 
VOURDERIS: You're not supposed to make that sound. 
 
QUEST: Looks like the swinging -- oh. Whoa. 
 
VOURDERIS: There you go. But here it is. This is Coney Island, guys. 
 
QUEST: Right. 
 
VOURDERIS: We have -- 
 
QUEST: What do you need? 
 
VOURDERIS: What do we need here? 
 
QUEST: Yes. What do you need? As you look around at it, what is it that you actually now need in Coney Island? 
 
VOURDERIS: I think we could use a little more investment. I think people are still a little afraid. I think we need more people to not be afraid. 
 
 When COVID hit, we knew the future of this place. And that's what always kept Coney Island coming back is there was always somebody who knew this 
 
 place has potential. There was always somebody who believe in its future and honestly, I believe if we remember who we are, then our best days are 
 
 ahead of us. There's so much potential. Coney Island has always had that reputation of being a little, you know, old New York, right? Let's say old 
 
 New York. 
 
QUEST: Joy in your face. 
 
VOURDERIS: Joy in your face. And you know what, some of it is still is like that, and we don't want to lose everything that we are but we want to kind 
 
 of find that middle ground. And I think we're slowly getting there. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
NEWTON: Wasn't that fun? I wish Richard had taken me. Can you believe it just a few short rides, subway ride from the center of New York? 
 
We will have the final numbers from Wall Street right after this. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
NEWTON: U.S. markets rallied after a wholesale inflation cooled more than expected. All three major indices finished at near record. Pardon me, 
 
 session highs. The Dow picked up 408 points.
