MACFARLANE: CHRISTINA MACFARLANE, CNN ANCHOR: Kamala Harris will deliver remarks later today at the White House to honor the NCAA championship teams. This will be the vice president's first public appearance since Joe Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed her as the Democratic nominee for president. 
 
Democratic fundraisers say donors are reinvigorated. The Political Action Committee, ActBlue, says grassroots supporters have helped raise more than $46 million since Biden bowed out of the race. The group says Sunday was the biggest fundraising day of the 2024 cycle. 
 
And Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will now meet with President Biden at the White House on Tuesday and will address Congress on Wednesday.
 
President Biden is recovering from a recent COVID diagnosis.
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR: The illness has forced the president to self- isolate at his home in Delaware. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is there with more on Biden's stunning announcement.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: President Joe Biden on Sunday announcing that he is dropping out of the presidential race in what has been a remarkable development that will shake up the 2024 presidential election. The president up until this point, along with his top brass, had remained defiant. He was going to stay in the race despite multiple calls from Democratic lawmakers, allies and donors that he should drop out of the race.
 
But while self-isolating at his Delaware residence as he was recovering from COVID, he was also reflecting and deliberating. On Saturday evening, he summoned his top advisors to his Rehoboth home where they assessed the polling and discussed among themselves what Democratic lawmakers and allies had been saying. And the president also consulted his family, who have always been influential in any decision that he makes over the course of his political career.
 
Then on Sunday, the president deciding to step out of the race and notifying his senior White House and campaign teams of the decision only minutes before putting out a letter to the public saying that while he was proud of his record and will continue to fulfill his duties as president, he will not seek reelection. Only moments after that, the president endorsing his vice president, Kamala Harris, to be the Democratic nominee and urging the party to come together. Now, sources tell CNN that the vice president did not know about the president's decision until Sunday.
 
Then the two spoke multiple times over the course of the day. And now it has been a moment for the vice president to try to gain momentum as she called multiple Democratic lawmakers, governors, civil rights leaders, among others, to get their endorsements, oftentimes telling them in their phone calls that she wants to earn the nomination and wants their support. 
 
Now, the outstanding questions remain as to what this will look like and what the process will look like over the next few weeks when we're only on the cusps of the Democratic National Convention.
 
And then, too, when the president will address the nation. He has been recovering from Covid and the White House doctor said his symptoms are improving significantly. In his letter, he said he would address the public, but when he will do that remains to be seen.

MACFARLANE: Well, leaders around the world have been reacting to this momentous news.
 
FOSTER: German Chancellor Olaf Scholz says: My friend Joe Biden has achieved a lot for his country, for Europe and for the world. Thanks to him, transatlantic cooperation is close. NATO is strong and the USA is a good and reliable partner for us. His decision not to run again deserves respect. 
 
We're covering all the angles this hour. Kristie Lu Stout has a reaction from Asia. Nada's here with a reaction from London as well. Well, not just London, across the region.
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Across the region, yes. We know that foreign policy and the foreign policy challenges that Biden has faced during his time in office have been immense, particularly, of course, when it comes to the war in Ukraine and, of course, the war in Gaza. We have heard from the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
 
He issued a statement saying that: Ukraine is grateful to President Biden for his unwavering support for Ukraine's fight for freedom. 
 
Of course, we've seen multiple military aid packages put forward by the Biden administration for Ukraine. We've seen that diplomatic support, particularly when it comes to Ukraine's ambitions to join the NATO alliance at some point. So, a huge amount of support from Biden there. 
 
Here in the United Kingdom, the newly elected Prime Minister Keir Starmer has also issued thanks to President Biden, although they weren't in office at the same time for very long. He said that he respects President Biden's decision and looks forward to working together during the remainder of his presidency.
 
Of course, a key focus for Biden at this current point in time and for the last few months has been Gaza. Of course, a response to October 7th as well. We've heard from the Israeli President Isaac Herzog. He said he wants to extend his heartfelt thanks to Joe Biden for his friendship and steadfast support for the Israeli people over his decades-long career as the first U.S. President to visit Israel in wartime, as a recipient of the Israeli Presidential Medal of Honor and as a true ally of the Jewish people. 
 
As you mentioned, we are expecting to see the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu traveling to the U.S. 
 <br>[04:35:00]
 
He is set to meet with Biden tomorrow and actually to address Congress on Wednesday. So those talks will go ahead despite the fact that Biden has now dropped out. It remains to be seen whether he'll meet with any other key Democrat figures, particularly, of course, whether he will meet with Kamala Harris.
 
I'll be keeping a watch on that. And of course, we will be keeping an eye on any more reaction coming in from world leaders.
 
MACFARLANE: You mentioned a reaction there from Zelenskyy. I mean, we know that obviously Biden has been one of the most influential figures in the war against Russia. I mean, how is this being viewed internationally in terms of the stakes now for Ukraine and the continued support from the U.S. to the war effort?
 
BASHIR: Well, there's a lot of concern about the support from the U.S., what that will look like in the next presidency, whoever becomes president, particularly if we see a Trump presidency. That's certainly a concern. We've heard that from NATO leaders in the past.
 
Trump has expressed his concerns around NATO, has suggested leaving the NATO alliance. That is something that Ukraine is deeply reliant on when it comes to military aid. And of course, we've heard from Democrat leaders, not only just President Biden, but also from other key figures who've repeatedly expressed support not only for Ukraine, but for the NATO alliance, the military support that that offers to key allies and partners, including Ukraine.
 
So for leaders, including President Zelenskyy, there will be a key focus on that, on ensuring that that partnership, whoever does take the presidency, remains and continues.
 
FOSTER: I think it would be very challenging, wouldn't it, for a foreign leader to meet Kamala Harris now before she's nominated. That's, that would be endorsing a candidate, effectively.
 
MACFARLANE: It absolutely would. I mean, remember, of course, that Harris is on the Biden-Harris ticket. So it is, if it is going to be Harris, then it is a continuation of the Biden administration in many senses.
 
Nada, thank you. 
 
Let's turn to Kristie Lu Stout, who's live for us in Asia. We know, Kristie, that under Biden, he looked to strengthen ties with Asian leaders, especially as a counter to sort of Chinese, growing Chinese influence in the region. So how is this news being received there where you are?
 
KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, we've been monitoring the response here in Asia, especially among allies, Asian leaders here who've been weighing in on that stunning announcement from the U.S. president that he is dropping out of the race. And under Biden, as you point out, the United States has bolstered and shored up ties with allies across the region, the Asia-Pacific region, all in the bid to counter China. So allies here have been offering messages of respect and support, including from the Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.
 
I want to share this clip from earlier today. Watch this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANTHONY ALBANESE, AUSTRALIAN PRIME MINISTER: President Biden deserves today, I think, to be recognized for once again not putting himself forward first, but giving his first consideration to being what he believes is in the interests of the United States of America as he's as he has done his whole public life. And I pay tribute to him today.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
STOUT: Albanese also called Biden an honorable man of integrity. Now, South Korea and Japan also issued statements. They said that they didn't want to directly comment on U.S. domestic politics. But both of these nations, both strong U.S. allies in the region, they emphasize the need to continue working with the United States. Now, in a statement, this is what we heard from South Korea's presidential office. Let's bring it up for you.
 
It says this, that the office will continue to work closely with the U.S. to further develop the South Korea-U.S. Global Comprehensive Strategic Alliance. 
 
And this is what we heard from Fumio Kishida, the prime minister of Japan. He says this, quote: I recognize that President Biden's decision is based on his desire to make the best possible political decision. The Japan-U.S. alliance is the cornerstone of our nation's diplomatic security, and we will continue to monitor it closely. 
 
Now, in contrast, the president of the Philippines directly responded to Biden's announcement, saying that it's, quote: a demonstration of genuine statesmanship. 
 
And he took to the social media platform X to add this, this coming from Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos, Jr. 
 
He says, quote: We thank him for his constant and unwavering support for the Philippines in this delicate and difficult time. 
 
Now, he's making reference to the ongoing tensions between the Philippines and China over China's assertions of sovereignty in the South China Sea, over its claims in that area. The United States continues to say that it stands with the Philippines. I also have to mention China's stance on all this.
 
At today's MOFA briefing in Beijing, we heard from the spokesperson who said that the U.S. election is America's own internal affairs. So bottom line, China has no comment. Back to you guys.
 
MACFARLANE: I was wondering if and when we would hear from China. Well, Kristie Lu Stout there live from Hong Kong. Thanks very much to you. 
 
And Donald Trump's campaign has spent years preparing for a potential rematch against Joe Biden. Now they say they're ready for Kamala Harris. We'll look at their strategy next.
 <br>[04:40:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
MACFARLANE: Donald Trump is slamming Joe Biden on social media. On Sunday, the former president said in a post, quote: Crooked Joe Biden was not fit to run for president and is certainly not fit to serve and never was.
 
FOSTER: CNN's Kristen Holmes has more on the Republican reactions from Washington.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Former President Donald Trump, his campaign, his orbit started preparing for the idea they might be running against someone other than President Joe Biden shortly after that debate took place. 
 
They started to see what was happening in the Democratic Party and really noting that it seemed to be more intense than they had originally thought. And that included putting together these sort of research books on each of the people they believed could be potential presidential candidates or nominees for the Democratic Party.
 
That included some Democratic governors, high profile governors. But it also had a big focus on Vice President Kamala Harris. And that was because there is a fundamental belief that exists to this day among the campaign that she will end up being the nominee or that she was going to be the nominee if Biden were to drop out.
 
Now, obviously, we are in a different situation. They have already started launching their attack ads on Kamala Harris. We expect to see some from the campaign in coming days.
 
But we also know that Trump's super PAC, MAGA Inc., one of the big super PACs aligned with him, is already running ads hitting Kamala Harris in battleground states. They're going to continue doing that. 
 
But the big thing here to note is that while you might hear from Donald Trump or some of his allies that they are confident they can beat Kamala Harris if she's at the top of the ticket or whoever's at the top of the ticket, there is a lot of concern that we are now in uncharted territory.
 
They know that this could change enthusiasm. Changing enthusiasm going into November could change turnout. They had created an entire campaign that was going to run against President Joe Biden.
 <br>[04:45:00]
 
And that included millions of dollars in data gathering, in modeling, all of that to beat President Joe Biden and no one else. So when you're talking to the campaign to outside groups right now, yes, they are running polling against Kamala Harris, but they're also running polling against other potential nominees.
 
But they're also doing is somewhat in a holding pattern because they are not going to spend that same level of output, that same level of money on Kamala Harris or anybody until they know for sure who is going to be the Democratic presidential nominee.

FOSTER: Rob Stutzman is a Republican strategist and served as communications director for then governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. He joins us now from Dublin. Thank you so much for joining us.
 
I mean, before all this happened, Trump's team was pretty clear that they wanted Biden to stay in the race because they felt they could beat him. So does this put them at a disadvantage?
 
ROB STUTZMAN, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: I don't think it puts them at a disadvantage, but they are going to have to retool the campaign as the report that just aired indicated. Kamala Harris is still someone you can run a similar campaign against. She was Joe Biden's vice president, obviously.
 
And so she still owns the last four years of the record of the Biden- Harris administration. And the Trump campaign is prepared to execute on those issues.
 
MACFARLANE: If Kamala Harris is the nominee, the tables have turned quite dramatically on the age debate as we were discussing earlier. Kamala Harris is 59, Trump is 78. How much will Trump's age and fitness now become a liability for him, given that I believe he's now set to become the oldest candidate to run for the presidency?
 
STUTZMAN: Well, indeed, yes, the tables are turned. It'll come down to how Trump performs. There's been a real focus on Biden's obvious cognitive decline in public. But Trump has his own interesting ramblings and indications that he may be starting to slip as well. But that's been obscured by Biden. Now there may be opportunity for the Democrats to put more focus on Trump's fitness for office.
 
So yes, this will be something the Trump campaign will probably have to be concerned about. I think you'll see them draw more concern. His handlers may be more concerned about how he rambles at his rallies, for instance.
 
Now, having said that, Kamala Harris is famous for verbal gaffes and word salads, as people will say. And you'll see plenty of that coming back on Trump ads as well.
 
FOSTER: I was interested to see some high profile Republicans saying if Biden doesn't feel he's fit to rerun, he shouldn't be serving now and should resign immediately. I'm just wondering how widespread that view is amongst Republicans.
 
STUTZMAN: I think it will continue to grow. And I think you're going to see more reporting. There's reporting by "The Wall Street Journal" in the last 24 hours indicating that the White House has been concealing this cognitive decline, that Democrats have been noticing it for years but haven't wanted to say anything.
 
So I do think you'll see the Biden narrative now advance on to, should he even serve the rest of this term?
 
MACFARLANE: Rob, I'm not sure if this is something you're across, but we have been seeing reports of Republicans signaling that they may move to prevent this, a new appointment of a nominee in state by state. There could be a legal challenge to Kamala Harris or anyone else nominated or put forward. I mean, is there a legal hurdle to overcome here in this?
 
STUTZMAN: Not that I'm aware of. I'm not an election lawyer, but no, the Democrats haven't nominated anybody yet. And that ballot line in all 50 states will belong to the Democrat nominee.
 
And beyond that, I think that the public would not react well to Republicans trying to meddle in who the Democrats want to nominate per their rules and their right to have the candidate of their party.
 
FOSTER: Are you seeing the attack line that Trump might have on Kamala Harris yet? We also had Crooked Hillary, Sleepy Joe, and actually, if you look at, you know, the evidence, those are pretty effective taglines, weren't they? Because they really resonated with people, but it's not entirely clear what Trump thinks of Kamala and how he's going to go in at her, which presumably he'll start doing straight away.
 
STUTZMAN: I would think so. I think, again, you'll see Trump still blame her for the last four years. I think you'll see Republicans attack her for covering up what they will say is a cover up of Biden's cognitive decline that threatened the well-being of the country.
 
And then Harris is to the left of Biden. When she unsuccessfully ran against him for the nomination four years ago, she was far to his left, never made it to the first primary. So I think they'll also zero in on how she's more liberal than Biden is.
 
MACFARLANE: And Rob, the appointment of Harris would put the issue of women's rights back on the table, which, you know, is something that we know have energized the voting base in the past, especially over the abortion rights. 
 <br>[04:50:00]
 
How problematic could that be for the Trump campaign, for the Republicans, you know, who are clearly in opposition to that, but see that as a potential win for her?
 
STUTZMAN: I think it could be a problem for the Republicans. So this is one of the real assets of Harris becoming the candidate, should she be the nominee, is that it does make it easier for the Democrats to campaign on really their best issue, which is the Dobbs decision overturning Roe versus Wade in the United States. And you know, look, there's real potential here to rally Democrats, especially young women, Democrat voters that otherwise were, you know, disaffected and disappointed in rallying behind an 81 year old male nominee.
 
So I think you'll see Democrats lean into Dobbs. There's a lot of targeting they can do to enhance the turnout of voters to which abortion is their primary issue.
 
MACFARLANE: Lots of issues on the table for clearly both sides where there may be a win or a loss. We'll wait and see. Rob Stutzman, thanks very much for joining us.
 
FOSTER: Still ahead, we'll have reaction from voters to U.S. President Joe Biden's historic announcement. Our breaking news coverage continues after the break.

SUSAN ROSALES, LOS ANGELES RESIDENT: For me, it wasn't really unexpected. Because clearly there were all kinds of rumblings within the Democratic Party. And I think he probably was listening to a lot of different people and made an informed decision. And I think he's right.
 
IVY BURTON, SANTA MONICA RESIDENT: I was so happy when I heard it because I just don't think that he's up to it. So I was really excited to see that. But I'm a little worried that she can't win.
 
JEFF ADELMAN, LOS ANGELES RESIDENT: I personally would vote for Kamala. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Why? ADELMAN: I think she has the experience, the knowledge. It would be
 
 great to see a female and a Black woman as president. The country hasn't, you know, kind of elected one yet. I think she has everything that would make for a great president.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
FOSTER: U.S. voters, they're reacting to news that Biden has endorsed Kamala Harris for the Democratic Party nomination.
 
MACFARLANE: Several top Democrats are praising Biden for exiting the race and are now rallying behind his vice president. So far, more than 500 Democratic delegates have endorsed Harris and there are still thousands more to go.
 
FOSTER: A source says the vice president is already working the phones, calling lawmakers and delegates to shore up support for her candidacy. Not only is Harris racking up early support for her potential campaign.
 
MACFARLANE: There's also new Kamala Harris merchandise already for sale online. The Biden-Harris campaign store now has those items under what it's called a new section, including T-shirts, stickers and a mug featuring a picture of a young Kamala Harris.
 
FOSTER: That's not her there.
 
MACFARLANE: You might want to get that sorted. Thanks for joining us here on CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Christina Macfarlane.
