BIANCA NOBILO, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome back to CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Bianca Nobilo. And if you're just joining us, let me bring you up to date with our top stories this hour. 
 
More than 100 people have died in a devastating wildfire surge on Maui. And officials in Hawaii warn that the death toll will continue to rise in the coming days. So far, only about a third of the search area has been looked through. 
 
Donald Trump and his 18 codefendants in the Georgia election probe has just nine days left to turn themselves into prosecutors in Fulton County. Trump, who faces 13 criminal charges is vowing to fight the case. The former president says he will hold a major news conference on Monday to reveal a report on election fraud. 
 
But as Donald Trump faces his fourth indictment some of his biggest detractors in the 2024 Republican presidential race are standing by him. CNN's Jeff Zeleny has more on their reactions.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
 
JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Once again, an indictment for former President Donald Trump is really overshadowing much of this Republican presidential race. One week before the candidates are scheduled to square off in the first debate in Milwaukee now, even if the former president is not onstage and we do not expect him to be, this is still likely to be a central part of the conversation. 
 
Now most of his Republican rivals are simply backing him up. Most of his Republican rivals are saying there is a two-tiered system of justice. It was not exactly the criticism from former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who of course has been calling out the former president. But even he said that this Atlanta prosecution may be unnecessary. 
 
CHRIS CHRISTIE, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, I didn't think it was a necessary thing to do once you saw that Jack Smith was charging him federally for the very same conduct. There's a lot of disturbing conduct here, not just by Donald Trump, but by a number of others named in the indictment.
 
GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: They're now doing an inordinate amount of resources to try to shoehorn this contest over the 2020 election into a RICO statute, which was really designed to be able to go after organized crime, not necessarily to go after political activity. And so I think it's an example of this criminalization of politics. I don't think that this is something that's good for the country.
 
SEN. TIM SCOTT (R-SC), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We see the legal system being weaponized against political opponents. That is un-American and unacceptable. 
 
ZELENY: So if these past indictments is any indication of what will happen with this, the former president is likely to regain his base of supporters. He is likely to raise considerable money off of the indictment and he's likely to turn this into his advantage at least politically speaking. 
 
A variety of Republican advisers and campaign officials, they say this could be different. Of course, the case in Georgia is so much different. It's much longer and it is much in a state court. So these proceedings are likely to be televised. Far different than the federal indictments he is facing. So for now at least, in the short term, yes, he is gaining politically from this. But it is unclear how this will play out. 
 
One thing is certain now, the former president's legal campaign and his political campaign are one.

NOBILO: Ukraine says its forces have liberated a village in the eastern Donetsk region after Russian forces tried but failed to regain control. Meanwhile, in the south, Russian drone attacks overnight damaged grain facilities in Odesa, a key port city. 
 
CNN's Nada Bashir is following all of these developments. Nada, yet again we've had more reports of drone attacks and the way drones are used is really redefining modern warfare. And you're hearing more information about the relative self-sufficiency of Russia. 
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER: Yes, and that is a real concern now. Because of course Russia imported those Iranian made Shahed drones about a year ago, and they have been using them to devastating effects across Ukraine territory. Particularly in the last few weeks around the port of Odesa, where we have seen port infrastructure and agricultural infrastructure being damaged following the breakdown of that Black Sea grain deal. 
 
Now we are learning from new U.K. ministry of defense intelligence that Russia is actually beginning to deploy its own manufactured drones. So if we look at the intelligence report they've released, they say that Russia has almost certainly began deploying domestically produced drones, which have been modeled on these Iranian Shahed drone designs. The local manufacturing of these drones will ensure that Russia has a reliable source, essentially making it to self sufficient in the future. 
 
But there is the caveat that at this stage they are still very much relying on components or haul weapons from Iran, which we have seen being transported to Russia via the Caspian Sea. 
 
But we have that message reiterated by the Ukraine authorities, that there needs to be all sorts of controls and in particular more stringent sanctions when it comes to controlling the supply of foreign technology and foreign made components, getting into Russian hands. And that was reiterated yesterday following a devastating barrage of missile attacks across the western city of Lviv. 
 
Where Ukrainian authorities say they discovered 30 foreign made chips within these Russian made missiles. They say that these missiles were manufactured around April in Russia, but they have real concern around the supply of this technology to the Russian authorities, and to the Russian armed forces. So they're currently working with their own international partners to try and ascertain more details around these foreign chips and where in fact they are being manufactured. 
 
But of course that message has been reiterated, they need those stringent sanctions being put in place and enforced at all times. Particularly as a counteroffensive continues to grind on. And while we are seeing Ukraine gaining some territory, particularly in the Donetsk region most recently, this isn't going as quickly as they had hoped. In the morning is, there is a long road ahead for Ukraine. 
 
NOBILO: Absolutely, especially when you are seeing this war of attrition, these things which can see incremental that we discuss, and have a major impact on the ability of the Russian side and the Ukrainian side to sustain the fight. Nada Bashir, thank you so much. 
 
Just ahead a former NFL player who is subject of the Oscar winning film, "The Blind Side," now says that he was tricked by the family he thought wanted to adopt him. The family's response to that next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
NOBILO: Welcome back. Inflation here in the U.K. has dropped significantly for the second months in a row. It fell to a 17-month low in July of 6.8 percent, compared to 7.9 percent just a month earlier. Falling energy prices are the main reason for the decline. The U.K. saw fuel prices dropped by a record 25 percent between June and July after a price cap kicked in at the end of June. 
 
Amid the chaos of the latest Trump indictment, U.S. President Joe Biden is trying to turn the country's attention towards his own administration's accomplishments. Particularly his efforts to boost the economy. Mr. Biden toured a manufacturing plant in Wisconsin Tuesday, but despite promoting the Inflation Reduction Act, a climate and health care package that passed one year ago, polls show that many Americans are not even aware of it. 
 
And his messaging may well be overshadowed by his son's legal travails too. Those legal troubles for Hunter Biden are only getting more complicated. His top defense attorney has asked a federal judge for permission to withdraw from the case, because it could be called as a witness in future proceedings. CNN's Kara Scannell has the latest on where this case stands. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KARA SCANNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Special counsel David Weiss says Hunter Biden is not off the hook for a felony gun possession charge. It's the latest twist in the five-year investigation after Biden's plea deal fell apart in court last month. And U.S. attorney Merrick Garland gave the U.S. attorney in Delaware special counsel status. 
 
Prosecutors say because the chief U.S. probation officer in Delaware did not approve the now withdrawn diversion agreement, it, quote never went into effect and therefore none of its terms are binding on either party. 
 
That comes after Biden's lawyers argued to the judge that it was a valid and binding agreement. The deal would have resolved the felony gun possession charge if Biden adhered to certain conditions, including not possessing a gun or using drugs or alcohol for 24- months. 
 
The dispute comes as Biden's longtime defense attorney, Christopher Clark, asked the judge to withdraw from the case. Biden's lawyers saying that he could now be a witness to the now contested deal. One thing both sides do agree on is dismissing the tax charges filed in Delaware. Prosecutors asked the judge to dismiss then so they could potentially bring new charges in California or Washington D.C., where the alleged tax crimes took place.

NOBILO: The U.S. government is planning to rein in companies that sell Americans personal information. These new regulations haven't been finalized yet. But the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau teased changes that would help Americans from data breaches. Now these could prevent data brokers from selling certain types of consumer information, including income, criminal and payment history. It could also see new restrictions on the sale of personal information such as names and social security. It would also seek to ensure that data brokers selling that sensitive information do so only for valid financial purposes. Such as background checks or credit decisions. 
 
A lawyer for the family at the heart of the "Blind Side" book and movie says that his clients are heartbroken over allegations made by Michael Oher. Oher, a former NFL player filed a petition to end Sean and Leigh Anne to his conservatorship over him. He accuses the Tuohys of tricking him into signing the paperwork. Saying they were looking to profit from him and his story. The family's attorney calls those claims hurtful and absurd. Brynn Gingras has the details. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK big smile, Tuohy family. 
 
BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Michael Oher, blindsided, He says, by his family at the center of the Hollywood blockbuster.
 
SANDRA BULLOCK, AS LEIGH ANNE TUOHY: Dean is your family, Michael. You have to protect him. Tony, here is your quarterback. You protect his blindside. When you look at him, you think of me.
 <br>[04:45:00]
 
QUINTON AARON, MICHAEL OHER: Yes, ma'am.
 
GINGRAS (voice-over): In a lawsuit the former NFL player alleging he was tricked by Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy, believing they were adopting the 18-year-old budding football star.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He became part of our lives.
 
GINGRAS (voice-over): When in fact, they became his conservators and quote, have total control over Michael Oher's ability to negotiate for or enter any contract, despite the fact he was over 18 years of age and had no diagnosed physical or psychological disabilities. 
 
It's a lie, Oher says, he discovered in February.
 
AARON: Never had one before.
 
BULLOCK: What, a room to yourself?
 
AARON: A bed.
 
GINGRAS (voice-over): Oher's life story from poverty to NFL stardom with the support of the Tuohy family became a best-selling book.
 
Then an Oscar winning film reportedly netting more than $330 million, Oher says he's seen none of that money and now nearly 20 years later is asking the Tuohy's for a full accounting of his share. The suit reads: 
 
Where other parents of Michael's classmates saw Michael simply as a nice kid in need, conservators Sean Tuohy and Leigh Ann Tuohy saw something else. A gullible young man whose athletic talent could be exploited for their own benefit. 
 
Sean Tuohy telling a local Tennessee newspaper: 
 
We didn't make any money off the movie. 
 
His son SJ not named in the suit, told Barstool Sports, he did make some money but it didn't make him rich.
 
SEAN TUOHY JR., RESPONDING TO LAWSUIT AGAINST FAMILY: I've made like 60, 70 grand over the course of the last four or five years.
 
GINGRAS (voice-over): The suit also claims Oher, who just published a book about overcoming obstacles this month, unknowingly signed over the rights to his name, image, and likeness in 2007 without payment.
 
Oher has publicly stated he doesn't like how he was portrayed in the movie.
 
MICHAEL OHER, FORMER NFL STAR: I think the biggest for me is, you know, being portrayed, not being able to read or write. When you go into a locker room and your teammates don't think, you can learn a playbook, you know, that weighs heavy.
 
GINGRAS (voice-over): The Tuohy's say they are devastated by the claims in the filing quote: 
 
It's upsetting to think we would make any money off any of our children, but we're going to love Michael at 37, just like we loved him at 16.

NOBILO: Which side will make it into the World Cup final? Australia and England are getting ready for their semifinal showdown. We are live in Sydney, next. 
 <br>[04:50:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
NOBILO: We will soon find out whether will be Australia or England facing Spain in the Women's World Cup final. The hometown favorite, the Matildas, will clash with the Lionesses in a little more than an hour. Neither side has ever made it to the championship match. 
 
And I want to bring in WORLD SPORT Amanda Davis, live for us in Sydney. Amanda, you've been in my hometown and now you are in Sydney working all hours and you have this key match today. I could take a wild guess at you might be rooting for. 
 
AMANDA DAVIS, CNN WORLD SPORT: Bianca, I'm not moaning. Two countries and two women World Cup semifinals in two days, it's not too bad a life, I have to say. And yes, my feet are very firmly, unashamedly say are in the England camp this evening. 
 
But there's been somewhat of an attack on the senses landing here in Sydney early this morning. I don't only think because of the early start. 
 
This might be uncharted territory for Australia being in a first ever Women's World Cup semifinal. But the one thing they certainly know how to do in these parts is get behind their country in a major international sporting event and certainly, against England. 
 
So literally from the minute we landed at the airport, the go Matildas sign are on the baggage claim boards, turn on the television, every presenter and reporter is wearing green and gold. School children going to school adorned in scarves with their faces painted. 
 
And the newspapers not surprisingly getting on board on the front and back pages. The "Daily Telegraph," the Sydney newspaper has renamed itself to the "The Daily Tillygraph," today. Of course playing on the Matildas Australia's women's nickname. 
 
They're giving away Sam Kerr face masks and you know, there is so much history to this rivalry as you well know. On different sports, not football. This day is uncharted territory. But the rugby here at this very stadium in 2003. The Ashes cricket we've seen play out once again both the men and women and more recently the World Cup, where Australia range again over England. But the players have been very keen to try to play that down. They say, as far as they're concerned, the standing in their way is just another team and, as ever, they want to win and book their place in that final. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MACKENZIE ARNOLD, AUSTRALIA GOALKEEPER: I mean being knocked out by anyone is kind of unthinkable. I think, yes, we would -- there's probably a lot of English people would love to see us knocked out by England, but I think there are more Australian who would love to see England knocked out by us. So in terms of the rivalry, again, we have such big rivalries with so many different countries, so it's just another game for us. 
 
SARINA WIEGMAN, ENGLAND MANAGER: We just know it's a very competitive -- going to be a very competitive game. Lots of players from Australia also playing to win the super league, so they know each other really well and of course they want to beat us, right? And we want to beat them. So that's the main competitiveness we will get in front of us.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
DAVIES: Australia, the only side to have a beating England in Sarina Wiegman's team here. A huge boost for them. It has been confirmed that Sam Kerr, their superstar striker, will be starting this evening. And England unchanged from their last game against Columbia. All to for and of course, the big prize, the final here against Spain on Sunday. 
 
NOBILO: Amanda Davies, live for us in Sydney. Thank you so much and enjoy the match. 
 
And in the MLS, that Messi magic strikes again. The Argentine superstar scored in the league cup against the Philadelphia Union, helping lift Inter Miami to a 4-1 victory and securing them a spot in the tournament final. 
 <br>[04:55:00]
 
This is Inter Miami's first shot at the trophy in its four seasons of competition. Lionel Messi has now been with the club just one month but has found the back of the net in each of his six fixtures -- nine goals in all. 
 
Now to stories in the spotlight this hour. Social media website X -- formerly known as Twitter -- appears to be slowing down the load times to some news outlets and rival platforms. The delays were reported by users on the forum Hacker News. Sites like "The New York Times," Reuters, Facebook, and Substack, all took nearly five seconds to load. The official reason for that isn't known and X hasn't responded to the multiple requests for comment from CNN. 
 
The queen of pop is feeling better and is about to hit the road. Madonna has rescheduled the summer show dates that were postponed after she suffered a health scare in June.

Now the ticket company, Live Nation, says Madonna will kick off the celebration tour in the U.K. and Europe in October as planned, with a previously scheduled U.S. shows honored afterwards. Now some shows will be canceled, but Live Nation says that Madonna hopes to make it up to those the cities in the future.
