KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE AND DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT: The company behind this lunar lander, a company called Intuitive Machines, it would become the first private company in history to successfully land a spacecraft on the moon. So, two big firsts here. The mission was scrubbed last night, but they're going to try again tonight. So, fingers crossed.
 
POPPY HARLOW, CNN HOST: Washington, thank you.
 
CNN This Morning continues now.
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN HOST: Hello, welcome to CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Max Foster in London.
 
Just ahead, families of Israeli hostages urged the International Criminal Court to take action against Hamas. This is world leaders and humanitarian organizations plead with Israel not to invade Rafah. Then the Ukrainian military says it sank a Russian warship in the Black Sea. What we know about the state of Russia's naval fleet.
 
Plus, a mega election day in Indonesia, where officials are counting more than 200 million votes.
 
We begin with news then coming into CNN. The Israeli Air Force has begun an extensive wave of attacks in Lebanon, the IGF said in a statement. Lebanese media report air raids on several towns in the southern part of the country. The new developments come as the Palestinian Authority president calls on Hamas to quickly cement a deal for the release of hostages in Gaza and for a pause in fighting.
 
Mahmoud Abbas says this would protect Palestinians and avoid another catastrophe. U.S., Qatari, Egyptian and Israeli officials have been working on a deal. A U.S. official says negotiations will continue. This is a growing chorus of world leaders and aid organizations warned against any Israeli ground offensive in Rafah, where more than a 1 million Palestinians are seeking shelter in dire conditions.
 
CNN's Nada Bashir tracking developments in Cairo for us. What are you hearing from Gaza today, Nada?
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER: Well, we continue to see what can only be described as a disastrous situation in southern Gaza. Of course, an area where the vast majority of Gaza civilians have flocked to in search of safety. They were ordered time and time again to move south by the Israeli military.
 
And what we have seen across southern Gaza, not just in Rafah, is not only a continued round of airstrikes by the Israeli military said to be targeting Hamas, but of course, with huge consequences for the civilian population, but also on the ground operations by the Israeli military in other areas, including Khan Younis.
 
So there is mounting concern around the situation in Rafah. As we know, more than 1 million people are belief to be concentrated here. Many of them living in temporary tent shelters. We continue to hear those warnings of a looming ground operation. The Israeli military has been directed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to prepare for a mass evacuation of civilians.
 
But as until now, no clear military plan has been provided by the Israeli military. It remains to be seen where exactly these civilians are expected to be evacuated to. What we have seen and what we've been hearing from people on the ground is that some are taking the decision to now evacuate themselves from Rafah and move further north back to areas of Gaza that have been almost entirely destroyed, including Nuseirat and Deir al-Balah, areas which continue to come under relentless airstrikes where there is little in the way of shelter.
 
But many families are desperately afraid of what could unfold in the Rafah if we do indeed see an on-the-ground operation by the Israeli military. As we know, the humanitarian situation there has been deteriorating for some time. We've had the warnings over the last 24 hours over the potential ramifications of a ground operation.
 
The World Health Organization's chief has warned of this becoming a disastrous situation. The U.N.'s Humanitarian Chief, Martin Griffiths, warning that there could be a slaughter in Rafah if indeed we do see a ground operation. And of course, we've seen that death toll rise in Rafah as a result of a series of airstrikes over the last 48 hours.
 
Now we are hearing of the situation around the Al-Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, also in the south. This is a hospital which has been under siege, and now civilians are being ordered to evacuate the hospital which is really raising concerns. Again, concerns raised by the World Health Organization over the situation there.
 
We have seen devastating video emerging from our colleagues on the ground showing civilians coming under live fire around Al-Nasser Hospital. So real warnings there with the impact this could have on civilian life.
 
And of course, also important and also a huge point of concern for members of the international community is the impact that a ground operation could have on ongoing negotiations and talks, as we've seen there have been talks here in Cairo. At this stage, no major breakthroughs just yet that could result in a lasting truce or agreement between Israel and Hamas and other mediating parties. But the concern is that if we do see a ground operation, that could place those talks in jeopardy. Hamas already saying that if, indeed, we do see a grand operation, they will not agree to a truce with Israel. Max?
 <br>[08:05:10]
 
FOSTER: OK. Nada, thank you.
 
One more note from the region. Turkey's president has arrived in Cairo, his first visit to Egypt in more than 10 years. Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the First Lady were greeted by Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi. Mr. Erdogan will be discussing the situation in Gaza and other regional issues with the Egyptian president.
 
Now, Ukraine says it sank a large Russian warship off the coast of occupied Crimea. Footage provided by Ukraine appears to show a drone as it approaches the ship, followed by an explosion. CNN can't confirm Ukraine's claims. Kyiv says it's now disabled a third of Russia's Black Sea fleets.
 
CNN's Melissa Bell joins us live from Paris. So Russia haven't denied it either. Have they, Melissa?
 
MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: They haven't denied it. They won't comment, the Kremlin says, because this is part of the special military operation as they call the war in Ukraine. And it will be for the Russia's Defense Ministry to comment. So far, no comment from there either.
 
I think what's significant, Max, about that piece of news that we've had this morning, the sinking of this landing ship now marking, according to Ukrainian side, the disabling of more than 30 percent of Russia's Black Sea fleet. It's significant because you're talking about a part of the world where Ukrainian forces, Ukrainian Navy hasn't been able to function since 2014, largely.
 
And where the Ukrainian military have been targeting a lot of their resources and efforts simply because the static land front lines have been so difficult to shift, first of all, but also because this, they believe, is an important strategic shift that may allow them to cut off Russia's ability to continue fueling its war effort through men equipment that comes through the Crimean Peninsula.
 
So, there has been a shift of Ukraine's attention to the Black Sea. What's interesting as well about this successful mission to sink another of Russia's ships is what they use, which are Ukrainian-made drones, these Magura drones. That's important because we know that Ukraine had been trying to ramp up its own production ability in terms of the weaponry, the equipment that it uses because of the difficulties, it says, it's been having in getting enough of the Western supplies that it needs.
 
These are long range drones that allow them -- that they have a range of some 800 kilometers. They're highly maneuverable and very difficult for Russia to detect and prevent in terms of the attacks. And so this successful one, another important win for Ukraine at a time, Max, when frankly, they haven't had terribly much to celebrate, not only in the fact that they've been able to use their own drones as effectively, but of course, overall, in their claim that it is now a third of Russia's fleet that's been destroyed.
 
It's an important psychological win, if nothing else, and shows that they are able to make a dent at least in the Black Sea, while elsewhere, their effort, of course, continues. But has proven so difficult to shift in their favor on those landlines all the way up to the north of Ukraine, its border with Russia. So a significant development this morning, and again, an important win for Ukraine at a difficult time, Max.
 
FOSTER: Yes, interesting. Thank you, Melissa.
 
U. S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is out of hospital after being treated for a bladder issue. The Pentagon says Austin has resumed his full duties and will work from home as he recovers. The Defense Secretary is expected to host a virtual meeting of the Ukraine Defense contact group which is this morning.
 
The U.S. Navy is making a very visible show of force in the Red Sea. They are protecting international shipping from missiles and drones launched by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. Just two days ago, the Houthis fired two missiles at a Greek-owned commercial vessel that was carrying corn to Iran.
 
Our Natasha Bertrand boarded a U.S. warship on the front lines of the fight and saw how quickly the crew has to act to intercept these incoming missiles. Natasha joins us now from Bahrain with a look at what you found, Natasha.
 
NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, Max, we were really on the front lines of the U.S. Navy's fight against the Houthis in the southern Red Sea. And we were on board the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier, where flights from fighter jets launch upwards of 50 times per day to try to keep watch over the Red Sea and, of course, strike targets inside Yemen when necessary.
 
When necessary to take out some of those missiles and drones that the Houthis are preparing to launch in the Red Sea against commercial vessels, as well as against U.S. and coalition forces. We were told very explicitly by commanders on board that the Houthis are trying to attack U.S. and coalition personnel there.
 
Now, we also had the opportunity to embark on a U.S. destroyer, which is in the Red Sea as well, and they are really the tip of the spear when it comes to engaging with the Houthis.
 <br>[08:10:05]
 
They have been shooting down Houthi missiles and drones for several months now. And we were able to go inside the combat information center inside that warship to see just how they respond when they see an incoming missile coming out of Yemen.
 
It really only gives them a few seconds to be able to respond by launching a missile themselves to intercept whatever is inbound coming towards that U.S. out warship here. But, look, the question now is how long can the U.S. actually sustain this? Because the Houthis have indicated that they are not going to let up their attacks until Israel's war in Gaza is over.
 
We asked the commander of Carrier Strike Group 2 which is in charge of the USS Eisenhower, how long he believes the U.S. presence is going to remain in the Southern Red Sea. Here's what he said.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REAR ADM. MARC MIGUEZ, COMMANDER, CARRIER STRIKE GROUP 2: The sustainability, we can go for a long time. We've got our logistics train already mapped out to stay here as long as the president needs us to stay here.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BERTRAND: Now, it's important to note that the systems that the USS gravely that destroyed that we were on, they are not perfect, and sometimes they don't necessarily work. And that was the case a few weeks ago when a several layers of defense of that warship did not work to intercept an incoming Houthi missile.
 
And they had to use their last line of defense known as a failing system onboard in order to intercept a missile that came very dangerously close to that warship. So that really underscores just the danger that these sailors are facing on a day-to-day basis in encountering and confronting this Houthi threat, Max.
 
FOSTER: OK. Thank you so much, Natasha, for showing us that.
 
Now, unofficial vote tallies in Indonesia, suggests the former army general is on track to secure the majority needed to win the presidential election. More than 200 million people were eligible to vote in the world's biggest single day election.
 
On the island of Bali, voters were greeted with heart-shaped balloons and chocolate as the election coincided with Valentine's Day. CNN's Anna Coren joins me from Hong Kong. What a logistical exercise they had out there.
 
ANNA COREN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, and only in Bali, right? But, Max, look official results, they won't be confirmed until next month, but it would appear from the unofficial tally quick count that former general Prabowo Subianto will be Indonesia's next president.
 
Results show he won almost 60 percent of the vote, which means there will be no runoff. Now, 72-year-old Prabowo was greeted with a rockstar welcome by his supporters at a stadium in the Capitol. I believe we're looking at live pictures.
 
He said that this is a victory for all Indonesians, that he will protect all Indonesians, but that they must wait for the official results from the Electoral Commission. But, look, there were claims of mass vote rigging almost immediately by the other candidates with a team of Ganjar Pranowo, the former governor of Central Java, saying they've received reports of structural systemic -- systematic, I should say, and massive fraud during the election and they're vowed to investigate.
 
Now, Prabowo was a former general under the Suharto dictatorship. He's been accused of human rights abuses, and at one point, was not allowed to enter the United States or Australia. He ran in the past two elections and lost to President Joko Widodo, but falsely claimed that the vote had been stolen.
 
Prabowo has had a dramatic image makeover. Thanks, in part, to Slick PR and social media campaign. But more importantly, his public perception, or this change in public perception is the result of the endorsement by the very popular President Jokowi, who's eldest son, here you can see on stage, with Prabowo, 36-year-old Gibran Rakabuming Raka, is Prabowo's running mate.
 
Jokowi had a two-term limit, and this is the reason why he can't run again. Look, the main issues of this election, economy jobs, education, eradicating corruption. Half of Indonesia's voters are under the age of 40. And conducting this election, Max, as you say, was a colossal and massive task.
 
You know, Indonesia, this archipelago made up 17,000 Islands, which 7,000 are inhabited and that meant that officials had to travel to some of the most remote places to deliver ballots. But look, this election very much seen as a referendum on Jokowi's legacy, his popularity is based on a country solid economic record.
 
And Prabowo has said that he will be the continuity candidate. And, look, I think it's important to note some analysts believe that a deal actually has been done between Prabowo and Jokowi that would allow Jokowi to continue influencing things from behind the scenes. Max?
 <br>[08:15:01]
 
FOSTER: OK. Anna, thank you so much for bringing us that.
 
Still to come, these families have gone to The Hague to urge the International Criminal Court to take action against Hamas. Details just ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: Well, at this hour, survivors of the October 7th attacks and relatives of the victims are at The Hague. They flew from Israel earlier on Wednesday to appeal to the International Criminal Court to issue arrest warrants for Hamas's leaders. The court is investigating the attacks and Israel's response. The families and survivors want the court to look at the Hamas leadership as part of that probe.
 
Nic Robertson joins us now from Tel Aviv with the details. And this is, you know, one of the perspectives on this is that you can't have a trial like that -- like this without having both sides represented and judged.
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Yes, that was one of the feelings when South Africa brought the case against Israel at the ICJ, International Court of Justice. And why? Because that's where you go to arbitrate and substantiate allegations that are made by one state about another state. But Hamas is not a state and that was a criticism.
 
You heard from a lot of Israeli officials here is why isn't Hamas being questioned? So by going to the ICC, International Criminal Court, which is where you take cases against individuals, the families and the victims of October 7th attacks can hope that the prosecution will listen to their testimonies and use that in their investigations against individuals within Hamas.
 
And Karim Khan, the prosecutor at the ICC has said that he does have jurisdiction over the October 7th attacks. So this is what the families are trying to do. They clearly want to get a level of justice for the crimes that were perpetrated against them and against their family members.
 
And I think they also want it noted more globally where there's a sense in Israel that the world has just moved on from the October 7th attacks that were brutal. They were horrendous. They were on a scale that is Israelis were just utterly shocked by and still are traumatized by.
 
The sense here is that the world has moved on and looks only at what's happening in Gaza and it's forgetting October 7th. So very much this is to bring about criminal cases against these Hamas individuals, but it's also to put it front and center in the world's consciousness as well, Max.
 
FOSTER: In terms of the atmosphere within Israel itself, obviously, a lot of pressure coming from outside Israel amongst allies, not to go in hard in Rafah, where there are so many civilians that could be caught up with any fighting. How is that being sort of juggled within Israel and where does the support lie?
 <br>[08:20:14]
 
ROBERTSON: You know, I think it is largely seen as more of the same of criticism of the IDF's actions inside of Gaza and not understood by the international community. There, of course, is a sense that Rafah is the way the IDF terms at the last refuge of Hamas and the place that many of the hostages might be, the two hostages who were freed at the beginning of the week were it being held in Rafah.
 
So I think the perspective here is that's the last place where Hamas is. And, you know, when you hear criticism from the Irish Taoiseach, the Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, saying that this could lead to massacre if there's military operations, if the IDF goes in with ground troops inside of Rafah. And we're hearing similar concerns expressed by the U.N. Secretary General, by the leaders of other U.N. bodies, that there is this huge concern. You know, the Israeli, rather the German and the Italian foreign ministers yesterday added their concerns. The Spanish Prime Minister has added his concerns to the Irish Prime Minister. So there is this growing welter of international opinion, not least President Biden saying you have to have a plan for the civilians if the IDF goes into Rafah.
 
But at the moment here, that doesn't seem to be a big part of the discourse. It's really the IDF waiting for the politicians, Netanyahu, to say, go and do it. And that's I think whether conversation here is inside of Israel, Max.
 
FOSTER: OK. Thank you so much, Nic, for bringing us that from there.
 
Coming up, outnumbered, outgunned, and running out of options. Ukrainian troops face critical supply shortages on the front lines as they struggle to gain traction against the Russian invaders.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: Ukraine is waiting nervously to see if the U.S. will provide its troops with more arms and ammunition. Republicans in Congress have been blocking crucial aid to Kyiv as it comes as Ukrainian troops face dire supply shortages on the battlefield.
 
But as CNN's Fred Pleitgen reports, Germany is responding by ramping up weapons production.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): A German-made Leopard 2 tank hitting Russian positions on the eastern front. This video provided by the 21st Mechanized Brigade, showing, they say, how effective Western weapons are on the battlefield.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Every infantry is scared of a tank. Tanks go out and work and they fire frightfully. They fire straight into their faces and they don't even have time to think about what to do.
 <br>[08:25:04]
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over): The Ukrainians say they need a lot more Western arms and ammo but Republicans have blocked U.S. military aid in Congress and their likely nominee for president, Donald Trump, even suggested he might encourage Russia to attack NATO members who didn't meet military spending guidelines.
 
DONALD TRUMP (R), U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I would not protect you. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want. You got to pay.
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over): Those comments literally have Europeans up in arms, now ramping up weapons production for Ukraine and for themselves. Germany's chancellor visiting a major arms plant with Denmark's prime minister, trying to downplay Trump's comments
 
OLAF SCHOLZ, GERMAN CHANCELLOR: NATO is of essence for the United States, for Canada, for European countries. And we cooperate so long since World War II. And this is really something which is a good alliance for the future. We stick to it. The President of the United States sticks to it. And I'm sure the American people will do so.
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over): But Denmark's prime minister says she has no illusions U.S. support for European NATO members no longer seems certain.
 
METTE FREDERIKSEN, DANISH PRIME MINISTER: No matter what will happen in U.S. in this year, I think the conclusion has to be written already now that Europe needs to be stronger and we need to do -- we need to be able to do more on our own.
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over): And ammo production is the biggest concern as NATO allies struggle to help Ukraine make up for massive shortfalls while facing overwhelming Russian firepower.
 
PLEITGEN: This is one of the most important things for the Ukrainians to stay in the fight. They're not only outmanned, they're also outgunned. And the biggest problem they have is a lack of ammunition.
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over): They broke ground for a new ammo plant here and the company's CEO says they will drastically increase ammo production quickly, especially for artillery.
 
ARMIN PAPPERGER, CEO, RHEINMETALL: They need 1 million to 1.2 million. And if I give them 700,000, I think there are also some other producers in Europe who have to give them something. So 700,000 is, at the moment, the maximum that we can produce.
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over): And the Ukrainians say they need the maximum their allies can give with or without the U.S. to keep their forces in the fight against the Russians.
 
Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Unterluess, Germany.
