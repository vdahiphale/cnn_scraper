(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN HOST:  Hello and welcome to our viewers here in the United States and all around the world. I'm Rosemary Church. Just ahead on "CNN Newsroom," we are one day away from the all-important midterm elections in the U.S. We'll break down the key races and we're live in one state that could tip the balance in the Senate. 
 
Red battle lines being drawn in Florida. Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis both on the campaign trail after the former president launched a volley at his fellow Republican. 
 
And the war in Ukraine, it's not on the ballot, but a Ukrainian MP joins me this hour to share her concerns if a new Congress would cut funding. 
 
Good to have you with us. Well, the critical midterm elections are now just one day away in the United States and already more than 40 million Americans have cast their ballots in early voting. A number that's outpaced the early turnout four years ago. Candidates in crucial contest have ramped up their campaigning in the lead up to Tuesday's election in an effort to sway undecided voters and get their base to the polls. 
 
And they have been getting help as President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump both hit the campaign trail in a final push and the stakes couldn't be higher. Across the nation, 36 states will be electing governors and all 435 house seats and 35 of the 100 Senate seats are up for grabs. 
 
While Democrats currently hold a slim majority, it remains unclear if they will be able to hang on to power, especially in the House. That is where race ratings by inside elections shows Republicans appearing to have the advantage. A party needs 218 seats to control the chamber and with 20 seats rated as a toss-up, Republicans would only need to win a few of those to take back control. 
 
But in the Senate, it's still anyone's game. Of the 35 seats on the ballot, seven are either toss-ups or tilt towards Republican or Democrat. And CNN's Athena Jones is in Pennsylvania where one of those critical races is playing out. Good to see you, Athena. So, let's start with that very close race in Pennsylvania. Where do things stand right now? 
 
ATHENA JONES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Rosemary. Well, of course as you said, all eyes are on Pennsylvania. This is one of the states where Democrats see their biggest opportunity to pick up a Senate seat. The current seat is held by retiring GOP Senator Pat Toomey, and so that's why you have an open seat with Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman versus tv doctor Mehmet Oz on the Republican side. 
 
And polls suggest that Fetterman is still a little bit ahead in this race, but of course the polls that matters are the ones on election day. And so, we'll see how it turns out in the end and what turnout is like. Of course, this is a challenging environment here in the state of Pennsylvania, just like all across the country with voters disapproving -- more voters disapproving of President Biden's job performance than approving of it.
 
And also, people concerned about the economy, concerned about rising prices. But as I said, turnout is really what it's going to come down to and both campaigns have had multiple rallies including events with big names like former President Donald Trump, former President Barack Obama, also President Biden. 
 
Doctor Oz campaigned in Bethlehem and in Bucks County which is outside Philadelphia today. Fetterman was also in Bucks County and in Harrisburg. Here is some of what they have had to say in their closing argument this weekend. Take a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOHN FETTERMAN, PENNSYLVANIA DEMOCRATIC U.S. SENATE CANDIDATE:  Dr. Oz wants to try to portray himself now a moderate after, you know, going -- a very right, right-right, far-right, you know, during the primary. Now he's trying to pretend that -- you know, there is no moderate -- no moderate -- if you are willing to share a stage with somebody like Doug Mastriano. 
 
MEHMET OZ, PENNSYLVANIA REPUBLICAN U.S. SENATE CANDIDATE:  I'm not a politician. I'm a surgeon. And what surgeons do is tackle big problems and we do it successfully, in my case, fixing broken hearts by working with everybody. By making sure we unify people in the operating room, not divide them. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[02:05:05]
 
JONES:  So, interesting arguments there you heard from Fetterman there first, talking about how Dr. Oz is not a moderate. He -- you heard him stumble a bit, that is echoes of that October debate that we saw Oz versus Fetterman where Fetterman had a bit of an unsettling performance because due to a stroke that he suffered from back in May. He is still recovering. 
 
But you heard him say that Oz is not a moderate because he has been appearing at campaign events with the gubernatorial candidate on the GOP side, Doug Mastriano, who is an election denier. He does not believe that President Biden legitimately won the 2020 election. And also, over this weekend with former President Trump. So, a lot going on in these final days as both sides try to get their voters to the polls. 
 
CHUCH:  Alright. And everyone watching very closely. Athena Jones joining us live from Pennsylvania. Many thanks. 
 
Well, another one of the most closely watched Senate races in the country is in the state of Georgia. Incumbent Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock is neck and neck with Republican opponent Herschel Walker. If neither candidate gets more than 50 percent of the vote, there will be a runoff election. Walker had this to say about President Biden's take on the fate of American democracy.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
HERSCHEL WALKER, GEORGIA REPUBLICAN U.S. SENATE CANDIDATE:  You heard the president, the biggest threat to democracy is to vote for somebody in the Republican Party. Is he crazy? The biggest threat to democracy is to have him in the White House. Is it not? 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH:  Meanwhile, Warnock was in Savannah, Georgia on Sunday trying to mobilize voters.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
SEN. RAPHAEL WARNOCK, GEORGIA DEMOCRATIC U.S. SENATE CANDIDATE:  The question is who's going to stand up for ordinary people? And I think I have demonstrated my commitment to doing that by capping the cost of insulin for folks on Medicaid, folks on Medicare. By capping the cost of prescription drugs, and by giving Medicare the ability to negotiate the price of prescription drugs.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
CHURCH:  Joining me now from Washington is Doug Heye. He is a Republican strategist and former Republican National Committee communications director, and in Atlanta, Tharon Johnson, the president and CEO of Paramount Consulting Group and former south regional director for the Obama 2012 campaign. Welcome to you both. 
 
DOUG HEYE, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Thank you. 
 
THARON JOHNSON, PRESIDENT AND CEO, PARAMOUNT CONSULTING GROUP:  Thank you.
 
CHURCH:  Alright. So, just one day away from the midterm elections, and of course we need to remind our viewers that midterms are generally a referendum on the government in power, and yet these 2022 midterms are proving pretty competitive. The fight for control of the Senate likely to be decided in about seven key races. And one of those is the Georgia Senate race where Democratic incumbent
 
 Senator Raphael Warnock and GOP challenger Herschel Walker are in such a tight race that it will likely go to a run for election next month. So, with inflation so high, why isn't Herschel Walker further ahead, Doug Heye? He should be running away with it? 
 
HEYE:  Well, you know, Mitch McConnell talked some months ago, got in trouble with his own party when he complained that some of the candidates that we had nominated weren't necessarily of the highest caliber or quality, and I think this is one of those examples. Georgia is by and large a red state, it's getting a little more purple than it used to be. Obviously, it has two senators right now. 
 
But it's one that Republicans certainly expect to pick up if not on Tuesday, than in the runoff. The problem is, we don't know what kind of role Donald Trump may play if there is a runoff. We should have won last time and Donald Trump made sure that we didn't essentially. So, Republicans are cautiously optimistic and also very nervous at the same time. 
 
CHURCH:  And, Tharon Johnson, is a runoff election between these two men inevitable for this very tight Senate Georgia race? And what do you expect will happen if it comes to that? 
 
JOHNSON:  Well, it's really going to come down to election day, you know. In Georgia, we've had 2.5 million people cast their early votes already. That's a record-breaking number. And so, we see that the enthusiasm as far as Democratic voters turning out early is definitely on Senator Warnock's side. I just believe that Senator Warnock has done a good enough job going to the U.S. Senate, actually fighting for Georgia voters, working with Republicans and Democrats to deliver key results when it comes to public safety, health care and also dealing with our economy.
 
But Democrats, we want to close this out. We don't want it to go to a runoff. It will be a four-week runoff this time unlike what it was in 2021 when it was a nine-week runoff. And so, you know, I've talked to some of the senators, people on this campaign, they feel enthusiastic. They've spent their money wisely. They have great ground game and -- but Herschel Walker is tightening in the polls and so we just have to wait to see what happens on election day. 
 
CHURCH:  Yeah. And of course, the other critical Senate race is the open seat in Pennsylvania where two candidates are so close.
 <br>[02:10:01]
 
The Democrats sent both President Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama there to offer support for John Fetterman, and of course, the crowds went wild particularly with Obama's star power. Doug Heye, can Republican Mehmet Oz win? The guy that Obama calls a snake oil salesman, and the candidate that even Oprah Winfrey who made him a star won't support? 
 
HEYE:  He can win. That's why we're talking about this. If this was the race that was over, we wouldn't be talking about it. There have been a lot of races that are not nearly as close that don't get any attention and there are a lot of reasons for that. We can talk about North Carolina for instance with Terence Young (ph) in the south and being from North Carolina and having worked there as well. 
 
It's a very winnable race. Either one of these candidates can win. You know, right now, I think the momentum is slightly on Dr. Oz's side, but it's really hard to gauge momentum in those last couple of days. And believe it or not, we're not seeing the amount of polls on the Sunday before the election that we're used to. But what we see is ultimately there aren't a lot of places where Joe Biden is on offense.
 
Most places he's playing defense. He is in -- either he's gone to New York. Tomorrow night he's going to be in Maryland for Westmore who is running for governor. Now, Westmore is a terrific candidate and he's absolutely going to win. He probably doesn't need Joe Biden's help, but Joe Biden isn't in a lot of these really close races except for Georgia -- excuse me -- Pennsylvania where obviously he's from Scranton. 
 
CHURCH:  Tharon Johnson, what is your research tell you about what Fetterman needs to do to overcome the optics of that very bad debate he had with Dr. Oz, due of course to his stroke recovery? 
 
JOHNSON:  Well, I think Lieutenant Governor Fetterman is going to definitely do okay. The debate performance was something that we saw Dr. Oz, he did get a little bit of boost in the polls, but also Lieutenant Governor Fetterman actually raised a lot of money after that debate because he, unfortunately, suffered a stroke. 
 
But when you have former President Barack Obama going into a state like Pennsylvania which he has won in the past, but the message of basically having someone like Mr. Fetterman in the U.S. Senate is a very important. And then lastly, you know, when you look at the governor's race that's going on there, you have a Democrat, Josh Shapiro, who is the current attorney general who's actually running for governor, he's actually able to pull out a great deal of voters that quite frankly, who don't really turn out in midterm elections.
 
So, I think ultimately, look, Rosemary, when you got Oprah Winfrey endorsing you as a person, as you mentioned, that worked with Dr. Oz, that tells you a lot about what she thinks about Mr. Oz, but also what she thinks about Fetterman. And that is that she thinks that he should be the U.S. senator. So, I think that the people in Pennsylvania are going to do the right thing and they're going to send him to Washington. 
 
CHURCH:  Alright. We'll see how far her endorsement goes. So, Doug, former President Donald Trump took a shot at Florida Governor Ron DeSantis while campaigning for Senator Marco Rubio in Miami, calling him "Ron De-Sanctimonious, but later changed his mind, instead calling on supporters to vote for DeSantis as a Republican. 
 
Do you cringe when you hear Trump say those things about his own team members? And why was he there supporting Rubio if your seat isn't even in doubt? HEYE:  You know, Rosemary, as you know, I've done more than cringe
 
 about a lot of things that Donald Trump has said and done over the past few years, but look, obviously he is telling people there are some things that make him nervous and Ron DeSantis is one of those and it's why he took that shot that he does. You know, I think most Democrats would tell you, Democratic elected officials, if Donald Trump gives you a nickname, that's a badge of honor for you.
 
Ron DeSantis says that Donald Trump is nervous about you and maybe he should be if DeSantis decides to run. Clearly, you know, Trump doesn't want to do too much to help him because he's got those concerns that somebody not only isn't just paying the due deference that Trump feels that he deserves, but might actually be able to beat him as well. 
 
CHURCH:  And, Tharon, inflation is of course the biggest issue for most voters, but has President Biden talked about that issue enough? And explain that high inflation is a global problem resulting from the pandemic, supply chain issues, the war in Ukraine, because most Republicans are getting a lot of mileage out of fooling less discerning voters into believing that the government has absolute control over inflation, which of course we all know is not true? 
 
JOHNSON:  You're absolutely right. I mean, this go through the order that you just described. I mean, the war in Ukraine, you know, basically dealing with supply issues, also dealing with some of the tax cuts that Donald Trump gave to a lot of his rich friends when he was in office. All of these things combined has led to this issue we're having in this country dealing with inflation. 
 
But I think what Democrats are talking about going forward into election day is that we've had a lot of job growth in this country. We just had a really good third quarter jobs report. We know that wages are up, people are actually working, gas prices are going down. 
 <br>[02:15:00]
 
And so, I think we will continue to be on the offense when we talk about ways that we are actually dealing with this issue around inflation. but ultimately you are absolutely right. This is not something that President Biden created on his own. There were a lot of things that happened before he took the presidency particularly the tax cuts that will happen to spending trillions of dollars, the spending that Donald Trump and his administration basically led.
 
But ultimately, dealing with a lot of things that the economy, which you can't control. So, ultimately, we got to get back on offense, talk about the job growth and talk about ways that we're going to try to lower inflation in this country. 
 
CHURCH:  Alright, just one day away from finding out the winners and the losers. Doug Heye, Tharon Johnson, thank you both of you for joining us. We appreciate it. 
 
JOHNSON:  Thank you. 
 
HEYE:  Thank you. CHURCH:  And, join us Tuesday for in-depth special coverage of the
 
 crucial U.S. midterm elections that will determine control of Congress. That is starting at 4:00 p.m. eastern. 
 
And still to come, some U.S. lawmakers argue Americans are tired of sending money and aid to Ukraine amid the war. Why one Ukrainian lawmaker says that's simply not the case. 
 
Plus, Ukraine's president says Russian forces are attempting to knock out power across the country. The weapons he says they are using to do it. Just ahead. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:20:00]
 
CHURCH:  Democrats have pulled out their biggest political messengers ahead of Tuesday's midterm elections. On Saturday, President Joe Biden and Barack Obama came together in Pennsylvania to rally for Senate candidate John Fetterman. They urged people to vote for their parties saying democracy itself is at stake. 
 
One of the people in attendance was Kira Rudik, a member of the Ukrainian parliament. And she tweeted this image of the event saying Obama was discussing, quote, "the values we should all be fighting for." 
 
Since the start of 2021, the U.S. has committed more than $18 billion in assistance to Ukraine, especially since Russia's invasion in February that includes artillery, vehicles, and medical supplies. But not every U.S. lawmaker wants that aid to continue. 
 
Earlier, I discussed that topic with Kira Rudik, a member of the Ukrainian parliament as I mentioned. I had her listen to what one Republican lawmaker had to say at a recent rally in Iowa. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
REP. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE (R-GA):  Democrats have ripped our border wide open. But the only border they care about is Ukraine, not America's southern border. Under Republicans, not another penny will go to Ukraine. Our country comes first. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH:  And here is how Rudik responded to those comments. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KIRA RUDIK, UKRAINIAN PARLIAMENT MEMBER:  In Ukraine, we do not manufacture weapons, we have $5 billion debt in our budget every single month and we depend on our allies because we need to end this war. If we have this support decreased, this winter will be extremely hard. It will be a winter that we may not survive standing up to Vladimir Putin and his forces. All the victories that -- and all the success that we had so far was
 
 because of the bravery of Ukrainian people, but also because of the supplies and weapons and finance that we received from the United States and European countries. And the price of decreasing the support would be crucial.
 
And basically, stopping to support Ukraine would mean that it is okay for the United States to accept that in 21st century, it could be possible that one country is annexing territories of another country, committing all kinds of war crimes, breaking all international laws, and the United States as a leader of Democratic countries would be just standing aside and say, yeah, we are okay with that.
 
And I'm asking, are you really okay with that? And I don't think so. I've been to those rallies, I've spoken to the people both in Republican and Democratic rallies and I do not believe that this is what people want. People were hugging me and saying that they are supporting Ukraine and they are standing with Ukraine.
 
And I think politicians need to be speaking on behalf of their people. And I do believe that the American people care about democracy and care about Ukraine and people who are dying there to protect the values that they believe in.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
CHURCH:  And you can see my full interview with Kira Rudik next hour right here on "CNN Newsroom."
 
Ukraine's president warns Russian forces may try to disable the country's infrastructure with missiles obtained from Iran. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made the claim during his nightly address on Sunday. Millions of people in cities like Kyiv already have seen electricity and water knocked out by Russian airstrikes. Now, President Zelenskyy worries an additional supply of weapons from Iran could spell disaster. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translation):  The whole world will know that the Iranian regime helps Russia prolong this war and therefore prolong the effect of those threats to the world, provoked precisely by the Russian war. If it was not for the Iranian's supply of weapons to the aggressor, we would be closer to peace now.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH:  And CNN Salma Abdelaziz joins me now from Kyiv with the lates. Good morning to you, Salma. So, Ukrainian's President Zelenskyy there saying Russia intends to use Iranian missiles for possible attacks on Ukraine's infrastructure and energy sector. What more are you learning about this? 
 <br>[02:24:52] SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  And President Zelenskyy's allies including the United States agree, western intelligence sources say that Iran is sending hundreds more weapons, drones and ballistic missiles to Russia to help them replenish their arsenal, their supply of weapons that's been used up here in Ukraine and helping them to bolster not just their fight on the frontlines, but this very sustained campaign against civilians infrastructure, knocking out power grids, the water systems, trying to really make life for average families, even far, far from fighting very difficult. 
 
And we heard more on that last night from the mayor of Kyiv. He's really preparing the city for a very difficult winter, Rosemary. He went on to say that he believes Russia is going to continue to try to hit the power grid that millions already just explained to millions already across the city, experience rolling blackouts every single day. 
 
They spent hours at home, without any power, without being able to heat their homes, without being able to cook food, without being able to light their living rooms. And this really fragile, really precarious system civilian infrastructure across the country, so fragile now that every time a missile lands, it just creates a devastating impact. 
 
So, the mayor again saying they are making these plans, if you have relatives outside the city, he advised that maybe you would prefer to stay with those relatives, if they have running water, running heat, that might be better. 
 
We also know that officials are creating emergency centers, basically big centers where people can go, where there will be heat, bathrooms, running water, emergency services so that families could go to these centers in every district if power is knocked out for a very long time. 
 
But again, everyone really bracing for the impact of this winter as these Russian missiles continue to be fired. But one last note here, Rosemary, I know this is very tough and families are absolutely suffering under these conditions, but it's also really bred a sense of resistance, of solidarity. People really binding together, standing behind the troops saying they feel like this is part of their fight. Rosemary? 
 
CHURCH:  Just incredibly brave people. Salm Abdelaziz, many thanks, joining us live from Kyiv.
 
And still to come this hour, competing rallies in Florida by two top members of the same party. Why this could be a preview of the 2024 presidential race?
 
Plus, a suspicious envelope is found at a Republican candidates' campaign headquarters and police are investigating. We are following that story, next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:30:43]
 
CHURCH: We are now just one day away from the critical midterm elections in the U.S. and the stakes could not be higher. All 435 House seats and 35 of the 100 senate seats are up for grabs. While Democrats currently hold a slim majority, it remains unclear if they'll be able to hang on to power. In addition, 36 states will be electing governors.
 
Candidates in key states have ramped up their campaigning in the lead up to Tuesday's election in an effort to sway undecided voters and get their base to the polls. President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump have also hit the campaign trail in a final push ahead of the crucial vote. Already some states have seen a huge turnout in early voting. According to data from election officials, more than 40 million pre-election ballots have been cast in 47 states. 
 
Meantime, former President Donald Trump and State Governor Ron DeSantis held competing rallies in Florida and Trump who was campaigning for State Senator Marco Rubio once again pushed his full selection claims. CNN's Kristen Holmes has the latest from Miami.
 
KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: In the final days before the midterms, former President DONALD TRUMP delivered a dark message during rally with Senator Marco Rubio in Miami. President focused on crime particularly crimes committed by illegal immigrants, drug dealers murderer, death. But all of that dark messaging similar to what we saw when he ran for president in 2016 resonated with his supporters.
 
Supporters stood cheering for him even as a torrential downpour started outside of the rally. Perhaps was surprising remarks that came from former President Trump were those in support of Senator Marco Rubio. He praised the senator. Usually during these rallies, he focuses much more on himself and his political future. However, he heaped praise on Rubio there. Now one person who was noticeably missing among top elite Florida Republicans was Florida Governor Ron DeSantis who was not invited by former President Donald Trump to this rally.
 
DeSantis is largely considered Trump's most formidable opponent in 2024. Should both of them run for president. As we reported last week, former President Trump is likely to announce in the two weeks between the midterm elections and Thanksgiving that is when he is eyeing announcing a third presidential run. Kristen Holmes, CNN, Miami.
 
CHURCH: An envelope containing suspicious white powder was sent to the campaign headquarters of Lari lake. The Republican nominee for Arizona governor. A staffer opened the envelope on Saturday and is now under medical supervision. So far no reports of injuries. That envelope was one of two that were confiscated by law enforcement and sent to professionals for examination according to a campaign spokesman. Lake condemned the incident and thanked authorities for investigating it.

KARI LAKE (R) ARIZONA GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: We're in dangerous times. This is not the first time we've been -- we've been threatened. I've been threatened many times. Our tires have been slashed. We've had screws drilled into our tire so that our tires will blow out while we're on the road. We are living in dangerous times and that's why we need to elect somebody who's strong and a fighter and not a coward.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: Lake's democratic opponent Katie Hobbs released a statement which read in part, political violence, threats or intimidation have no place in our democracy as strongly condemned as threatening behavior directed at Lake and her staff.
 
And join us Tuesday for in-depth special coverage of the crucial us midterm elections that will determine control of Congress starting at 4:00 p.m. Eastern.
 
The COP27 Climate Conference gets underway in Egypt. Coming up. We will take you live to Sharm El-Sheikh to look at unique proposals aimed at reducing humankind's carbon footprint. That's ahead here on CNN NEWSROOM.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:38:02]
 
CHURCH: In Egypt global leaders are meeting for the U.N.'s annual climate summit. Researchers, advocates and the United Nations itself are warning that the world is nowhere near its goal of keeping global warming under 1.5 degrees Celsius.
 
U.S. President Joe Biden will deliver remarks on Friday. He is expected to tout programs he signed into law to expand clean energy and reduce pollution across the United States.
 
CNN's David McKenzie joins us now from Sharm El-Sheikh in Egypt. Good to see you, David. So, what can we expect to come out of this summit? What's the latest?
 
DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Rosemary, I wish I could give you better news. But in fact, the world is facing a catastrophe and it's right on our doorstep. We've seen these climate emergencies throughout this year, including in Pakistan heat waves in parts of Europe. And just a short time ago and other private jet flew overhead, the leaders are streaming into this critical meeting in Sharm El-Sheikh.
 
The COP27 Climate Meeting where many world leaders will be trying to hash out some way to get us out of this mess. Because if you look at the numbers, it's sobering reading, we're nowhere near reaching the 1.5 threshold that was agreed upon at the Paris Agreement some years ago. Already, we're at 1.2 degrees centigrade warming which will lead to catastrophic impacts on biodiversity and on the planet and how we live.
 
There needs to be a massive ramping up on emissions cuts. More than 45 percent cut in current emissions needs to happen to get anywhere close to that 1.5 degrees. And as it stands now, the pledges that have come in particularly from developed countries will get us to more than two degrees centigrade warming and that is certainly catastrophic. I know I've been using that particular word a lot and you can become inured to the dangers of climate change.
 <br>[02:40:01]
 
But it's here with us now. If you look at those floods in Pakistan, the situation in Nigeria even South Africa earlier this year, a developed countries need to do more developing countries at these meetings are asking for more. On Saturday and Sunday they hashed out a deal to get loss and damage onto the formal agenda of these meetings.
 
CHURCH: All right. Looks like we've lost our signal. David McKenzie there at Shamel El-Sheikh covering COP27 Summit.
 
Well, North Korea is defending a recent series of missile launches that have sparked international condemnation. The country says last week's tests were in response to a military drill that the U.S. and South Korea held together. Pyongyang is claiming to have fired more than 80 missiles to counter the exercise, which it called and intolerable provocation. It is also threatening more action if Washington and Seoul hold future drills.
 
Nineteen people are dead after a Tanzanian commercial flight crashed in Lake Victoria on Sunday. The airline says there are 24 survivors. Officials say the plane plunged into the lake as it was preparing to land and bad weather may have played a role in the accident as the area was under heavy rainfall and strong winds at the time.
 
I do want to thank you for joining us this hour. I'm Rosemary Church. For our international viewers World Sport is next. To everyone else do stay with us. I'll be back with more news in just a moment.
