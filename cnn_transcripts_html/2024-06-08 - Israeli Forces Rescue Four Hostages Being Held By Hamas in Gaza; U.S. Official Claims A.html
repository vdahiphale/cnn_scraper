FREDRICKA WHITFIELD, CNN ANCHOR: Hello again, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me this Saturday. I'm Fredricka Whitfield. 
 
All right, new today, dramatic moments in the Middle East as the Israeli military rescues four hostages from Hamas. Shortly after that during daytime mission, they were reunited with loved ones for the first time since they were kidnapped during the October 7th attacks. The former hostages relieved to be home after an enduring eight months in captivity. And now their families are demanding more to be done to save those still being held in Gaza.

ORIT MEIR, MOTHER OF ALMOG MEIR: There are still 120 hostages in Gaza, and we want a deal now. We want them to come back home as soon as possible.

WHITFIELD: CNN's Paula Hancocks is in Israel, and I spoke with her last hour for an update on the hostages' conditions.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)
 
PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: So Fred, they all came for their medical checkup here. Now we heard from one of the doctors who had looked at them saying that they will all stable and they were all in good medical condition. Some of them still undergoing checks at this point, though. But it has been a day of high emotions here as friends and family have been coming in to see those four Israeli hostages who has spent the last eight months in captivity in Gaza. Now, we heard some of the details of that mission. It happened in
 
 Nuseirat in central Gaza from the IDF, we understand it happened at 11:00 a.m., A joint mission between the military, the security agency, and the police that they say was weeks in the planning. The prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, giving the green light for it to go ahead on Thursday. 
 
Now, they say it was focused on two buildings that they entered to try and rescue these four hostages. They say they were under fire as they went in and as they left. But you see images of those hostages on board the helicopters touching down in Israel, celebrations, relief on their faces. And we've been hearing from some of the families of those that were released saying there are more that needs to be released, 120 more. All of them that we've heard from, though, calling for a ceasefire deal. Fred?
 
(END VIDEO TAPE)
 
WHITFIELD: Paula Hancocks, thank you so much. 
 
All right, let's go now to CNN's Ben Wedeman in Beirut. Also joining us is Priscilla Alvarez in Washington. So Ben, you first. This rescue operation was a blistering assault that resulted in, yes, the retrieval of these four hostages. But it also meant hundreds of civilian casualties in Gaza. What's the latest? 
 
BEN WEDEMAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Paula was saying it's a day of high emotions in Israel, but it was a day of high emotions in Gaza as well, emotions like terror and grief. Now, according to doctors at the Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah, which is very near to the Nuseirat refugee camp, they received at least 215 dead, more than 400 wounded. Now, we got lots of video from inside the hospital. It is a scene of pandemonium. There are dead and injured on the floor. A doctor is struggling to treat people, panicked relatives with their wounded, loved ones begging for attention.
 
Keeping in mind, of course, these hospitals are already strained to the limit by eight months of war and devastation. They've been treating the dead and the wounded every single day all those eight months. Now, one resident of the Nuseirat camp described the situation there today as this operation was going on as hell on earth. Apparently, there were lots of people out and about. 
 <br>[14:05:00]
 
Normally this kind of operation takes place under the cover of darkness, but this was mid-morning on a Saturday. So there were lots of people in his street. We've seen lots of images of dead and mangled bodies in the streets of Nuseirat. So the situation there desperate. And of course, this is causing some anger on this side of the conflict. The Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has called for an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council. The Jordanian foreign ministry is put out a statement calling on Israel to stop this senseless war in Gaza. Fredricka?
 
WHITFIELD: All right, Ben, thank you. Priscilla, to you in Washington. One U.S. official is telling CNN that an American cell supported this operation. What more are you learning about what that means? 
 
PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN REPORTER: Thats right, Fred. And the White House has not provided details as of now in terms of how the U.S. aided this effort or to what extent. They only said or, U.S. officials said that they assisted and worked with Israeli forces. 
 
Now President Biden did speak on this earlier today alongside the French president and welcomed the news of the rescue.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I want to echo President Macron's comments welcoming the safe rescue of four hostages that were returned to their families in Israel. We won't stop working until all the hostages come home and a ceasefire is reached. That is essential to happen. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ALVAREZ: Now, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan did release a statement after that, calling this a successful operation to rescue those four hostages. And of course, the U.S. has been involved in ongoing talks to release all of the hostages in exchange for a ceasefire. President Biden himself outlining that proposal in a rare move that would include those three phases, again, with the goal of having all hostages released and also to stop the fighting in Gaza. 
 
And this week, the U.S. and 16 other countries called on Hamas to close the deal. We also know that senior U.S. officials were turned to the Middle East to add momentum to these talks. Now, where they are still unclear, and whether they can reach that agreement, but certainly there has been ongoing pressure for this hostage deal to come through. 
 
At the very least, though, today the U.S., you heard there from the president celebrating this news that four hostages have been released. Fred?
 
WHITFIELD: All right, Priscilla Alvarez and Ben Wedeman, thanks to both of you. Appreciate it. And Paula Hancocks at the top. 
 
All right, happening right now, pro-Palestinian demonstrators are gathering in Washington, D.C., and moments ago, they actually had a brief encounter for with park police just outside the White House. That's where the protest has formed there. And they are contesting what they say is President Biden's failure to act after Israeli military forces began operations in Rafah. 
 
CNN's Brian Todd is on the ground outside the White House there in Lafayette Square where it looks like the numbers of people have grown. What's going on, Brian?
 
BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Fredricka, this crowd has grown in size and in energy level for the past couple of hours. What we want to show you is kind of the central piece of symbolism that they wanted to unveil here. This is what they call the people's red line. This is what they were hoping would be a two-mile long red banner. And you can see it's got signatures, messages all over this banner here. This is right outside the fence of the north lawn of the White House. The fence was erected just over there, extra security fences about nine feet tall outside of the regular security fence because the last time they had a protest here, the protesters threw balloons full of red paint. They threw signs and other objects onto the White House North Lawn. They wanted to try to prevent that. So far we've seen nothing like that here. 
 
But again, a lot of passion, a lot of energy here. And the symbolism of the red line is because this crowd of people believes that President Biden misled people what he said there was a red line for Israel regarding the incursion into Rafah that occurred about a month ago. They believe that the president misled people. They're here to express their frustration with that and to call for an end to U.S. aid to Israel, and for this movement basically to grow and to put more pressure on the White House. 
 
Here's another piece of symbolism. Take a look at this huge Palestinian flag. This is at least a couple of hundred feet long. This was carried over here by hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters through the park and now is kind of being unfurled here. The plan is for this banner, this red banner that you see here is I kind of walk this way, to extend all the way around the White House. This was in 100-foot sections a short time ago, then they kind of got everybody together and put it together. They're going to try to go all the way around the White House. We're going to try to assess whether they were actually able to make it all the way, because it is quite a large perimeter around the White House, especially where this fence has been set up, Fredricka. 
 <br>[14:10:02]
 
WHITFIELD: All right, Brian Todd, thank you so much. We'll check back with you. 
 
All right, let's talk even further about the conflict, the release of hostages, all of that. I want to bring in now CNN political and global affairs analyst Barak Ravid. He is a politics and foreign policy reporter for "Axios." Barak, great to see you. So you've been covering the internal debates about this war for in Gaza within Israel's Knesset. Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz delayed a planned news conference after this hostage rescue today. Have you learned anything more about the rescue efforts and about the direction or the strategy of the Israeli Defense Forces? 
 
BARAK RAVID, POLITICAL AND FOREIGN POLICY REPORTER, "AXIOS": Well, Fredricka, first, this was a very, very successful operation, but at the end of the day it was a technical one. Until now since the beginning of -- since October 7th, together with the four hostages that were released today, only seven hostages were released in military operations, 110 hostages were released in the previous hostage deal. And IDF officials, even those who are deeply involved in both the
 
 operation and the negotiation, say that at the end of the day the way to release the big numbers of hostages is only through a deal. 
 
WHITFIELD: What is the reaction? I mean, we've seen the pictures of family members who were hugely relieved to see these four hostages released, or rather captured and reunited with their family members. Does that change the dynamic within Israel where there have been so many who have been protesting Netanyahu's approach to all of this, saying that he has lost the vision of prioritizing the release of these hostages? 
 
RAVID: I think there was one instance earlier today on the beach of Tel Aviv where the lifeguard used his radio to tell all the people on the beach that four Israeli hostages were rescued by the IDF. And the response of the crowd, of the people on the beach was quite extraordinary. And I think it showed something very basic in Israeli society, in Israeli culture, how important this issue of bringing back the hostages is. This is the number one priority. 
 
Just last night there was a public opinion poll that was published that showed that 56 percent of Israelis think that releasing the hostages should be the number one priority. And they said that the support President Biden's speech and plan that he laid out just a few days ago when only 24 percent said they are against that, that they oppose that. I think it tells you a lot on where the Israeli psyche is right now. And I think what we Saturday is only going to increase that sentiment.
 
WHITFIELD: You also were reporting that Benny Gantz, who is the Israeli war cabinet member, who had a scheduled announcement today, you had learned that possibly that announcement would have to do with his party's withdrawal from the emergency government plan and that he might step down, that it's been postponed today. Does that also mean that potentially he may have changed his mind about what he was going to announce? 
 
RAVID: Well, first, Fredricka, Benny Gantz didn't want to leave the government. That's the honest truth. But he had no other choice. His numbers were plummeting in the polls, and Netanyahu tweeted him very badly and violated all the agreements they had. And he was sort of like with his back to the wall. 
 
And today Gantz gave this very complicated message on what he is planning to do next, that he said now we need to look at the reality with responsibility. You can interpret it either way, but his people say that his plans to withdraw from the government are still on. He might wait a few days, maybe after Secretary of State Blinken will arrive in Israel on Monday. He will wait to see if there are any developments on the negotiations over the hostages. But according to his plan right now, he is still going to withdraw from the coalition. 
 
WHITFIELD: All right, let me interrupt you for a moment, Barak, because I want to go straight to Paris there. This is French President Macron in his comments and toast to his guest of honor, President Biden, and others. Let's listen in. [14:15:04]
 
EMMANUEL MACRON, FRENCH PRESIDENT (through translator): -- what is best in both of our countries. These warm feelings born of a long and deep friendship is further enhanced by the joy today of hosting you today for your first official state visit to France, with a very pleasant feeling of deja vu. Indeed, a year-and-a-half ago, you were hosting me in Washington, in December, 2022, thus demonstrating through regular visits how close we are in the reciprocal interests of our countries. 
 
And this year, 2024, for all people who are attached to the Franco- American relationship, there is something special to celebrate because there is reciprocal sacrifice for our independence, for our freedom. Indeed, this year, we will celebrate the 200th anniversary of the farewell tour of the Marquis de Lafayette, a hero of the American Revolution. I know that he is close to the hearts of all Americans. 
 
We also commemorate the 80th anniversary of the landings in Normandy and in Cavazos. We stood side-by-side. Then as we did two days ago in Normandy for the ceremonies on June 6th, to bow our heads in the peaceful cemetery of Colleville to remember their courage on the Omaha Beach, Omaha the bloody, where so many of your countrymen gave their lives for a country they had never been to before. Never will we forget these heroes who from Normandy to Berlin, helped to free a continent and our country. Their sacrifice has cemented our friendship. 
 
Amongst his heroes, there was a young man, Harold Terens. He was 18 when Pearl Harbor happened. At the age of 20 he was a radio operator working with your Air Force. He was at his duty post on D-Day, and then the war led him everywhere in France, in Morocco, and all the way to Ukraine. Today Harold has chosen our country to marry Jeanne Swerlin. They are with us today, and they are just making their marriage vows. So let us congratulate the young newlyweds. 
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
MACRON (through translator): We're very pleased to be here for your wedding repast. And on this foundation, so many relations have developed, from cinema to music, from literature to space, from energy to transport, agriculture, and health. So many partnerships that have served to consolidate our bilateral relationship that we have further strengthened recently. 
 
It's also this relation that makes it possible to affirm our values. Faced with a war of aggression by Russia and Ukraine, or today in the Middle East in Gaza. And once again, thank you for the initiative that you have just taken and that we support to be united in spite of our differences when the main values are at stake. This is what is our lie across the Atlantic. 
 
When it comes to defending our values, we stand together. So of course, there's something a bit special in our relationship because you are, you are American. We are French. And there's something of a mutual fascination you find from -- indeed in our respective film industries, we love the American dream, and you like the French --  
 
WHITFIELD: We're going to continue to monitor the remarks coming from the French President Macron right there at the state dinner. We're going to take a short break for now. We'll be right back. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:22:21]
 
WHITFIELD: I want to take you straight to Paris right now, President Biden and his toast at the Elysee Palace. 
 
JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: -- maybe someone could help me. I'm a son of the American Revolution because Robinette came over with Lafayette and never went home, who stayed in the United States. So that makes me his son of the American Revolution. But I haven't been able establish that yet, so maybe one of your genealogists can figure it out for me. 
 
Look, France is our first ally and that's not insignificant. The fact of the matter is you were with us to help us secure our freedom, and we were with you 170 years later -- excuse me -- to do the same. And ever since, we've remain united, unyielding, as well as unwavering in our partnership. That's what democracies do. It has been an extraordinary week here for us, for Jill and me. It's just been amazing to be here. I've been here a number of times over the years. I know I don't look it, but I'm only 40-years-old. But all kidding aside, I've been here many times. But this has been the most remarkable trip that I've ever made. 
 
Together, we celebrated D-Day, the heroes of D-Day, told the story of the alliance and how together we saved Europe. And the people of France, and you too, personally, honored our veterans with such warmth and dignity. On behalf of all the American people we want to say, thank you, thank you, thank you. From the bottom of our hearts. We mean it. 
 
When the American troops came to these shores 80 years ago on an audacious mission to save the continent, they each carried a book given to them by the U.S. military. And the book was called "A Pocket Guide to France." Seriously. It included helpful hints like this. "No bragging. The France don't like it." 
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
BIDEN: "Be generous. It won't hurt you." "Avoid controversial topics, even if you took French in high school."
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
BIDEN: And try to follow at least one, I tried my best to follow at least one of those. But you know -- and then it said the French are allies who quote, quote, "happen to speak democracy in a different language. And we democracies aren't just doing favors. We're fighting for each other. When history goes -- gets through, we all are in the same boat," end of quote. [14:25:00]
 
France and the United States have always been there for one another. We stand together when the going gets tough. And that's a fact. We stand together to defend the values that lie at the soul, the very soul of both our nations, and I believe that to be the case today. Liberty, equality, brotherhood, generation after generation people across both our nations have upheld these ideals because they know when we stand as one, our countries are stronger and literally the world is safer.
 
Emmanuel, you've heard me say before. We stand at an inflection point in history. The decisions we make now will determine the course of our future for decades to come. We have a lot of opportunity, but a lot of responsibility. And it gives me hope to know France and the United States stand together now and always. Or as the "Pocket Guide to France," given to the invading Americans, might say we're rowing in the same boat.
 
Ladies and gentlemen, to France, the United States, and to our people. May we continue to seek democracy, may we in both our languages, and may we always stay together. It's been a great honor to be here, and I want to thank -- I'm going to raise my glass to France.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
WHITFIELD: All right, a toast led by the American president Joe Biden there, followed by the toast of the host of this state dinner there in Paris, French President Macron.
 
I've got with me Melissa Bell who is there in Paris. Frida Ghitis has joined me here in the studio. And again, ladies, we saw a continuation of what has been thematic during this five-day visit to France by the American president of reinforcing this relationship and this bond between the United States and France. And hearing President Biden there, Melissa, in his toast, we are standing at an inflection point. Again, while very jovial and offering some great humor on this ongoing relationship, it was back to a very important, poignant moment that what is done today directly impacts the future as he continues to reiterate this resolve, a common a -- common goal between the United States and France. Melissa? 
 
MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's right. And that message, Fredricka, that when we stand together, the world is safer, it's been at the heart of everything that we've heard in Normandy from the two remarkable speeches that President Biden made while he was there. The first, of course, on D-Day itself, the 80th anniversary itself on the Thursday, and the other one on Friday when he went back to Normandy, having come to Paris to see President Zelenskyy for his bilateral meeting with him, that extra pledge of help. 
 
He'd gone back to Normandy to Pointe du Hoc, that very symbolic place where American soldiers had scaled cliffs in order to take out Nazi positions and contributed greatly to the success that was Operation Overlord. He has in each of his speeches and throughout the day today here in Paris, all of those ceremonies that we saw, very strong ceremonies at the Arc de Triomphe, the driving down of the Champs Elysee of the two presidents together, their working lunch, the messages that have come from both presidents throughout this state visit that's just wrapping up, will wrap up tomorrow, has very much been that, that it is about how historically successful, historically anchored, first of all, in the time of American independence and the French Revolution, then how consolidated, of course, when the allies work together to liberate France, that each time the countries have worked together, the oldest ally of the United States in France, things have worked out better and certainly in the name of freedom here in France.
 
Now, taking that message to the edges of Europe this time has been at the heart of the two presidents' messages. Remember that both have really led the charge for large amounts of aid to be given to Ukraine. Of course, the American president, but Emmanuel Macron as well, from the point of view of Europeans, has been very much amongst those leading the pro-Ukraine camp, or certainly in favor of ever increasing amounts of aid to Ukraine. 
 <br>[14:30:02]
 
So two presidents who have stood extremely firmly on the side of Ukraine against Russian aggression. And they've drawn that historical parallel throughout the visit. And we heard that again just now from Joe Biden. It is about an alliance that makes the world a safer place, Fredricka. 
 
And Frida, again, a reiteration of the messaging that we heard from Joe Biden on Thursday when he was on the shores there of Normandy, and he says we collectively, standing against tyranny and standing for freedom together. And then again, he brings these two countries together, the United States and France again, by saying may we continue to seek democracy and stay together. This is a priority in his messaging.
 
FRIDA GHITIS, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: It's not only a priority in his messaging during this trip. It is the theme of his entire presidency. And we heard that from the day that Joe Biden announced that he was running for president. That's why it didn't surprise me even though it really caught my ear when he said this is the most memorable trip I have ever taken.
 
WHITFIELD: And after establishing he's been to France and Paris for many, many years in the various roles as a senator, as a vice president, and now president. 
 
GHITIS: Exactly, because this theme of saving democracy, which he thinks is at stake now, he thinks is threatened. It converges, so many of the themes of his presidency converged during this trip. They talk a lot about history, about how France helped the United States in its war of independence against the British, and the United States helped save France from the Nazis. But this is, this is about the future. And he said that. It's a theme that he returns to frequently. We stand at an inflection point. 
 
And this, this trip, this moment connects multiple threats to democracy in the west, in the world, in the view of Biden, which is what he has been articulating. And we'll see you tomorrow Biden is going to visit the Belleau Wood, another famous war site. And its one that became infamous with a visit from then President Donald Trump, who was there in 2018, and his chief of staff General Kelly later said that standing in front of the cemetery, Trump said, these people are losers and suckers for giving their life and getting nothing out of it. 
 
So the contrast, we're going to see that contrast again. It's a message to the people in the room, the people who are listening to that toast and message to the people of France, of Europe, and to the voters in the United States. It's a message that is very poignant, and it encompasses all the choices that people around the world, not just in the United States, are making right now. 
 
WHITFIELD: And all really powerful. And I wonder, Melissa, before I let you go, I mean, underscoring that this isn't just about geopolitics. Oh, OK. Melissa is gone. Well, thank you, Melissa, for playing with this when you did. Maybe I can sum it up with you. I thought it was important and also poignant, even though it is about the geopolitical sphere and the dynamics here. We heard from Macron, who also said, he gave a nod to cinema, to literature, to health, to transportation. These are the various ways in which the relationship is integral between the United States and France. Broadening it out, that it isn't -- in peacetime liberty is important, but it isn't just about that. But there is a relationship and a continuation of relationship building through all of these venues and beyond.
 
GHITIS: Well, what we hear today, what we hear in these speeches is the common ideas, the common values of the two countries. What we are not seeing is what's happening in the private conversations are having. And there are some disagreements. And the disagreements are on the degree on, the tactics of support for Ukraine. Macron is advocating more of a presence on Ukrainian soil of western troops. But overall, this is to reaffirm the common values.
 
WHITFIELD: Very good. Frida Ghitis, thank you so much. Melissa Bell, I know you still hear us in Paris. Thank you so much. Thanks to both of you, ladies. 
 
All right, coming up, the prosecution has rested in Hunter Biden's federal gun trial. What an emotional week of salacious testimony, and what it all means for his case. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:38:47]
 
WHITFIELD: Special Counsel prosecutors rested their case against Hunter Biden on Friday. This weekend his lawyer said they will decide this weekend whether he will take the stand in his own defense. Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty to lying on federal background check forms about his drug use and to possessing a gun while addicted to drugs.
 
Joining us right now is former federal prosecutor Michael Zeldin and civil rights attorney Areva Martin. Great to see you both. Michael, you first. Do you believe the prosecution has a strong case here? And would it be wise for Hunter Biden to take the take the stand? 
 
MICHAEL ZELDIN, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: Yes and no. I think they have a strong case. I think they presented compelling evidence that he was in fact a user or addicted to drugs at the time he signed that form. That's essentially all that needs to be proven in this case. And no, I don't think that they would be wise to put him on the witness stand. 
 
To the extent that they were able to establish sympathy for him, and he's a very sympathetic character, what he went through during this time period, I think that was established during the cross-examination of the government witnesses, and that he should rest and hope for a jury nullification verdict. 
 <br>[14:40:06]
 
WHITFIELD: And then Areva, there was critical testimony coming from Hunter Biden's daughter, Naomi, on Friday. She said she was hopeful about her father's recovery when she visited him at a rehab facility in the summer of 2018, saying, I'm quoting now "He seemed like the clearest that I had seen him since my uncle," meaning Beau Biden, "died, and he just seemed really great." But then when confronted with texts appearing to show him acting somewhat erratically about handing off that car, she seemed confused and said that she was nervous. At the same time, is it your feeling that people might be able to the empathize or have some understanding of the frustrations when someone is an addict? 
 
AREVA MARTIN, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: Oh, absolutely. Fred, this whole case, I think, is really going to be difficult for the jury for lots of reasons. So many of us in America have family members, friends, who suffer from addiction. And we know how erratic those individuals can be. And I can't imagine anyone not empathizing with a daughter having to testify in a criminal trial involving her father and having to talk about some of the most intimate conversations and engagements, interactions that they've had as a father and daughter.
 
And she was put on by the defense in order to personalize Hunter Biden, to give I think some humanity to what he was experiencing. And despite seeming to be a little nervous, I think, when she was confronted with those text messages, I think overall she was a very effective witness for the defense. 
 
And I don't know if I totally agree that the prosecution has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that at the time period in question that Hunter Biden was in fact using. Definitely there was lots of very compelling testimony about him having a very serious drug problem, but no one could say on that date that they saw him used drugs. There are no photographs, there are no text messages. And I think there is something that the defense can use to suggest reasonable doubt when they make their closing argument. 
 
WHITFIELD: OK. And then Michael, since you do believe that the prosecution has a strong case, if there is a guilty verdict, do you see this going to the Supreme Court? Do you see an appellate process that would involve the high court? 
 
ZELDIN: Yes, I do, because I think Abbe Lowell filed motions in this case early on challenging the constitutionality of this statute. It's a very broad statute with very sort of ambiguous definitions. And I think that there is the very strong possibility that this court, this Supreme Court, which has been so Second Amendment friendly, might find an interest in challenging whether or not a statute which prohibits anyone who is using controlled substances, which could mean medication for a hip replacement, or antidepressants, or other types of prescription medicine, but still fit within the definitions of this statue, they might want to take a hard look at the constitutionality of it. 
 
WHITFIELD: And Areva, how do you see it? 
 
MARTIN: Oh, I agree 100 percent. And remember, this is the same Supreme Court that's looking at a case as to whether someone who has been involved in domestic violence charges should be allowed to have access to guns, and a veteran that suffers from PTSD, do they have a right to have access to guns. And we know, as Michael said, this Supreme Court has been very pro Second Amendment friendly, and it would be very difficult to decide that someone who has been accused and even convicted of domestic violence can have a gun, but someone who has access to some kind of controlled substance, whether it's a medication or an addiction, would be prohibited from having access to a gun.
 
WHITFIELD: All right, we'll leave it there for now. Michael Zeldin, Areva Martin, thank you so much.
 
ZELDIN: Thank you, Fred.
 
WHITFIELD: All right, straight ahead, sports. Another Grand Slam for this woman I'll call her Iga, because I'm terrible at trying to pronounce her last name. The world number one taking her third consecutive French Open just hours ago. We'll unpack her incredible win next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:49:00]
 
WHITFIELD: OK, let's talk some tennis, shall we? The world's top- ranked women's tennis player just won her fifth Grand Slam title in a dramatic and quick fashion.

WHITFIELD: There she is. Should I try it? Iga Swiatek. Well, Don Riddell is here to correct me, because I can say Iga, but you know, I see the spelling of her name, I want to say Swiatek, but there's a lot more going on. OK, that was a fierce match. I did watch it this morning. It was
 
 exciting. I love Jasmine Paolini as well though, go girl. So what you got? 
 
DON RIDDELL, CNN HOST, WORLD SPORT: First of all, well-played, Jasmine Paolini. She's had an amazing tournament. And she's going to play in the women's doubles final tomorrow. So she might yet end up with some silverware. But I don't think anybody was surprised at this result. Iga Swiatek is absolutely extraordinary.

She's just 23 years of age. This is her fifth major title, as you say, her fourth French open title, her third in a row, which puts her into the same conversation now as the likes of Justine Henin, Monica Seles. And actually, during this tournament, she's been asked does she consider herself to be the queen of clay, because remember Rafa Nadal is the king of clay. 
 
And the reason people are asking that question is because you look at where he was at her age and where she is now, they're very, very similar. Four French open titles at the age of 23, he had four at 22. So I don't think anybody thinks this is going to be her last. 
 
WHITFIELD: She's just getting started. 
 
RIDDELL: Yes. She was emotional, though, afterwards, and during the tournament, because although it was a dominant tournament, she almost went out in an early round to Naomi Osaka. She was match-point down. And so she might not have been there. She talked about that afterwards.

IGA SWIATEK, FOUR-TIME FRENCH OPEN CHAMPION: I was almost out of the tournament is second round. So thank you guys for kind of staying behind my back and cheering for me. I also needed to believe that this this one is going to be possible. So it's been a really emotional tournament. So yes, thank you for supporting me.

RIDDELL: She really is just amazing. 
 
WHITFIELD: Yes, really great. That was run. All right, thank you so much, and thank you for the pronouncing -- pronounce her, too.
 
RIDDELL: Any time. 
 
WHITFIELD: All right, because we'll be talking about her again. She's going to do something else amazing and grand. Don Riddell, appreciate. 
 
We'll be right back.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: On the world stage, President Reagan is determined to defeat what he calls the "Evil Empire." But another battle is playing out in the shadows.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: For me becoming a spy for the KGB was ideology. I am Jack Barsky. That's not the name I was born with. We stole the identity of a Jack Barsky who passed away at the young age of 11. I spent 10 years as an illegal undercover agent for the KGB in the United States. I was 100 percent convinced that communism was the right thing, that the world eventually would wind up being one happy communist family.
