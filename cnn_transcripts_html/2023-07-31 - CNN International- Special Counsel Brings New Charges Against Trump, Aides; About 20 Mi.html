MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR: Hello and a warm welcome to our viewers joining us in the United States and all around the world. I'm Max Foster in London. Bianca is off this week, but just ahead on CNN NEWSROOM. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I've got to be arrested. They want to arrest me. That's only because we're winning. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There's a lot of criminality alleged in this indictment. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Extreme heat continues to batter the entire country. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm trying to find some cool air and when it comes, yeah, it's here, but, my God, it's only for a minute. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It was a suicide bombing in the Bajaur region of the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province which borders Afghanistan.

ANNOUNCER: Live from London, this is CNN NEWSROOM with Max Foster and Bianca Nobilo. 
 
FOSTER: It's Monday, July 31st. 9:00 a.m. here in London. 4:00 a.m. in Miami, Florida, where little known employee of Donald Trump will appear in federal court in the coming hours as part of the criminal legislation which was alleged mishandling of classified documents. Carlos de Oliveira is a property manager at Mar-a-Lago here. He's charged with making false statements to the FBI when asked about the movement of boxes at this Florida resort. He's also accused along with Trump and aide Walt Nauta of trying to delete Mar-a-Lago security footage. Here's what Trump said on the campaign trail on Saturday. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: Biggest complaint that I get is that the Republicans find out this information and then they do nothing about it. Any Republican that doesn't act on Democrat fraud should be immediately primaried and get out. Out.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
FOSTER: On social media on Sunday, Trump denied the security footage from Mar-a-Lago was deleted but that's not the claim. Trump is accused of an attempt to delete the footage. Meanwhile, sources tell CNN that Trump is creating a fund to help pay his enormous legal bills. This in his reports, that his public action committee has spent more than $40 million on legal fees for Trump and his associates this year alone. Renato Mariotti is a former federal prosecutor and cohost of the podcast "Its Complicated.? He spoke with CNN about last week's superseding indictment and what it says about the special counsel's case. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
RENATO MARIOTTI, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: I think what it tells me is that Jack Smith is more focused on building the strongest possible case against Trump, than he is about racing to the finish line or trying to get this done before the election. I think that as a practical matter, adding another defendant is going to cause delay. 
 
But I think there's a dynamic at play here that's important. First of all hearings basically making a statement that, you know, more and more, you know, low level people who are involved in the scheme may get indicted. That's one thing. But I also think that Jack Smith has really strengthened his evidentiary hand from the trial. Under the rules of evidence, now, he's going to be able to bring in a lot more testimony regarding this obstructive scheme. Regarding acts that weren't even necessarily in that particular venue in Florida. 
 
And he's also now charged the document that Trump was allegedly waving around in that recording where he was, you know, talking about the fact it was highly secret and he had not declassified while he was president. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: That was federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti speaking earlier with CNN. 
 
The brutal heat wave sweeping the U.S. set to continue this week. More than 140 heat records could be broken or tied as temperatures continues to climb across the country. On Sunday, parts of California, Louisiana and Georgia recorded record highs. CNN spoke with some people in Atlanta, Georgia about how they're planning to beat the heat. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's warm but it's fine. I think you can adapt to it if you just keep working through it. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you're not used to the heat and stuff like this,
 
 I would suggest you don't necessarily come out and experience it. Because it is a lot. This heat is not much for me, clearly, I love wearing these, you know, long sleeves in the summer like this. But I will say for like dogs and stuff, we have foot packs. She's got booties. She's got her water and everything like that. You have to make sure you have enough water for your dogs and stuff. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You have to stay in light clothes and just drink a lot of water, stay hydrated. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Once you've been living in Atlanta for long time, you kind of just know how to handle it. We know how to embrace it a little bit. Like you're going to sweat. You're going to be a little bit uncomfortable. And that's just part of living here.

FOSTER: Over the next week nearly 60 million people could see temperatures soar about 100 degrees Fahrenheit. 
 
The U.S. State Department says it's working to free kidnapped American nurse Alix Dorsainvil and her child in Haiti. They were accused on Thursday, according to -- objected rather -- on Thursday, according to the Christian aid organization where she works. CNN's Athena Jones has the latest. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ATHENA JONES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, we know U.S. authorities are working closely with their Haitian counterparts and with U.S. government interagency partners to try to resolve the crisis. But there's also a lot of things we don't know. It's unclear right now who is responsible for this kidnapping or whether they've made demands, whether for ransom or anything else. 
 
El Roi Haiti, which is the humanitarian organization, the Christian humanitarian organization this nurse for New Hampshire was working for put out a statement. Here's what they said in part. 
 
Alex is a deeply compassionate and loving person who considers Haiti her home and the Haitian people her friends and family. Alex has worked tirelessly as our school and community nurse to bring relief to those who are suffering as she loves and serves the people of Haiti in the name of Jesus. 
 
Now El Roi has also said their highest priority is her safe return of this mother and her child. And they want to limit the amount of information they're sharing. 
 
We also heard from a State Department spokesperson saying they have no higher authority than the safety and security of U.S. citizens overseas. But this kidnapping comes at the time of welling concerns about the
 
 worsening violence in Haiti. It was just two years ago this month that then President Jovenel Moise was assassinated by a gang. And there's been a power vacuum ever since. With some gangs taking control of various different swathes of the country. The State Department has warned Americans not to travel to Haiti because of the frequency of kidnappings, crimes, civil unrest and also the poor health infrastructure. And just last week, the State Department ordered all family members and nonemergency personnel of the embassy to leave the country immediately because it's so unsafe. 
 
This came after at least three days in a row of restrictions when embassy staffers and families were supposed to stay there on the embassy compound because things were so dangerous. 
 
The U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said during a recent visit to Haiti that Haitians are trapped in a living nightmare with humanitarian conditions that are beyond appalling. Guterres went on to say, we are calling for a robust security force deployed by member states to work hand-in-hand with the Haitian National Police to defeat and dismantle the gangs and restore security across the country. 
 
But the bottom line here, we're still awaiting for more details of this scary, dangerous situation there in Haiti. 
 
Athena Jones, CNN New York.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
FOSTER: CNN spoke with Joel Rubin, a former deputy assistant secretary of state for legislative affairs, about the situation in Haiti. He explained what could be happening right now to rescue the nurse and her child. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOEL RUBIN, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE FOR LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS: Right now behind the scenes American personnel are at a lower level of presence on the ground in Haiti. And to that, that's a bit of a hindrance. But there are contacts directly with the security services in Haiti. And so, what's happening right now is that the State Department, their bureau that handles international law, as well as the Justice Department and others who have been engaged for many years in dealing with these kinds of scenarios. They're reaching out to their Haitian counterparts. 
 
But remember about a year ago, we had roughly 20 missionaries kidnapped as well as well. And at that time the Justice Department and the FBI got involved through diplomatic contacts through the State Department orchestrating that to try to work with their counterparts in the security forces in Haiti to find the missing Americans. So that's likely what's happening right now.

FOSTER: Joel Rubin speaking to us earlier. Ukraine says Saudi Arabia is preparing to host an international summit
 
 to discuss a peace initiative for the war with Russia. Kyiv is expected to participate in the talks along with Western powers and key developing nations like India and Brazil. Russia though will not be involved. Ukraine hasn't specified when the meetings will be held but says they'll focus on a ten-point peace plan developed which was by its President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. 
 
But Russian officials says Ukraine has launched a drone attack on the Bryansk region hitting a building of the district's Department of Internal Affairs. It's the latest strike in Russia that Moscow has blamed on Kyiv. On Sunday, the Kremlin also accused Ukraine of launching a drone attack on Moscow. Russia says it intercepted three unmanned vehicles. As you can see in this video, at least one of them crashed into the business center. 
 
Just moments ago, Ukraine accused Russia of launching attacks of its own, saying two missiles were fired towards the central Ukrainian city. And CNN's Clare Sebastian has been monitoring all of this. 
 <br>[04:10:00]
 
First of all, the attacks from what appears to be Ukraine on Russia. They haven't denied it, have they? 
 
CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: They haven't said anything yet. But no, they have been denied it. And this comes after comments by President Zelenskyy on Sunday. Essentially saying, you know, gradually he says the war is returning to the territory of Russia and this is an inevitable, natural and fair process, he says. And really this is the third time in four days that we seen Russia accused Ukraine of attacking its soil. This one a drone, according to the regional government in the Bryansk region -- and if we could pull up a map of that -- it's just across the northern border of Ukraine, really, on the border that he says that a building was hit. No casualties, it happened overnight. But they're cleaning up the damage. 
 
They didn't claim as of yet they had shot down that drone, whereas with the attacks on Moscow on Sunday. And then remember there was a missile that hit the Rostov region -- but didn't hit the Rostov region on Friday because so far Moscow's been claiming that it's been shooting them down. So that is potentially noteworthy. But separately, Max, this morning we're hearing of this missile attack on Kryvyi Rih, which is President Zelenskyy's hometown in central Ukraine. I think we can potentially show you a map of where that is as well. 
 
We're hearing so far that two buildings were hit. An educational institution and then apparently the second missile -- this is according to the interior minister -- destroyed a section from the fourth to ninth floors of a residential building. So far there's only one person killed, 10 injured. But they are concerned that people are still trapped under the rubble. So rescue efforts continue there. It was just six weeks ago that the same town was hit by a missile attack that killed 11 people. 
 
FOSTER: Yes, OK. And in terms of this summit, so like dealing with Saudi Arabia, isn't it? It's interesting because it's got such a broad group of countries. He's got these developing nations, Middle Eastern nations, but also a lot of the Western nations, but obviously not Russia? 
 
SEBASTIAN: Yes, so this is Ukraine attempting to rally support around President Zelenskyy's ten-point peace plan. This is sort of the second phase of that process. This is the one of the national security advisers to the leaders of these countries. And they're trying really to bring in, as you say, not just their Western allies, the traditional allies that provide weapons, that impose sanctions on Russia and things like that, they're trying to bring in the likes of India and Brazil. Really the countries that Russia has been trying to court. And certainly we saw the African summit continues to try to court the developing world. 
 
So this will happen in Saudi Arabia. "The Wall Street Journal" says that it will happen this coming weekend. So crucial to watch that. They say that it will be leading up to potentially a leader summit at the end of the year, not involving Moscow, though. 
 
FOSTER: OK, Clare, thank you. 
 
Still to come, dozens are dead after suicide bombing rocks Pakistan. We'll have a live update. 
 
Plus, the political is growing in Niger. Thousands of protesters are turning out in support of the military coup. While regional leaders are issuing sanctions and threatening force. I will take a look in a live report for you. 
 
And later, a new plan from the Biden administration for student loan relief after the Supreme Court struck down his earlier effort. Details, next. 
 <br>[04:15:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: Pakistan is reeling from a deadly attack at a political rally. For more let's go to CNN's Ivan Watson. He's live for us in Hong Kong. And this happened quite close to the Afghan border. 
 
IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It sure did. This was in the Khar province, in a district called Bajaur. And the death toll is pretty staggering. At least 44 people killed including a politician from this Islamist JUI-F party which is in a ruling coalition with the current Pakistani government. More than 100 people were reported wounded. Let's listen to one of the eyewitnesses who arrived on the scene shortly after the blast. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
FAZAL AMAN, RESIDENT (through translator): I was in close proximity when the blast occurred. Upon arriving at the scene I was confronted with a devastating sight. Lifeless bodies scattered on the ground while people cried out for assistance amidst the bloodstained surroundings. People were picking up bodies on their own. Around 400 to 500 individuals had gathered here for the convention organized by the JUI-F party. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WATSON: Now, the Pakistani police, they say that this was a suicide bombing estimating that the bomber was carrying eight to ten kilograms of explosives. There have been no claims of responsibility yet for this attack. And you know, in modern Pakistani history, political violence does take place, sometimes with devastating consequences. But the range of actors that have been affiliated with some of this violence really goes across the political spectrum. Across different ideologies and affiliations. So, we don't know who could have been behind this right now. The Pakistani Prime Minister has of course, denounced this and expressed remorse for the victims, Max. 
 
FOSTER: OK, Ivan Watson, thank you for bringing us that. 
 
Sanctions, threats, chaotic connotations, diplomacy, all coming to bear Sunday in the political crisis in Niger. The president of Chad traveled to Niger's capital hoping to find a political solution. The images of him with the country's ousted president, Mohamed Bazoum, may be the first public picture of Bazoum since he was deposed in a military coup on Wednesday. 
 
Meanwhile, thousands took to the streets to express support for the two leaders. Niger is a former French colony. But some of the most tense demonstrations were held outside the French Embassy. Protesters damaged the building, chanting against colonialism and waved Russian flags. In neighboring Nigeria regional economic leaders hit Niger with a host of sanctions and threatened to use CNN' force if the coup leaders don't restore the elected president within a week. 
 
CNN's Larry Madowo is monitoring this crisis from Nairobi. Two cross pressures here. The one from outside the country in support of the president it seems. And also a lot of support being shown within the country for the coup leaders. 
 
LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's a good analysis, Max, because it does appear that this is a popular coup. Many people in the country support the army for taking over. They feel that the last government that was corrupt. 
 <br>[04:20:00]
 
That President Mohamed Bazoum, a key ally of the U.S., and many of the international community, was a puppet of the West. And they're tired of corruption. They're tired of poverty. And they feel that this might be a better way out of all those. But the international community, the African Union, the Economic Community of West African States saying no, a constitutional order has got returned to Niger and that President Mohamed Bazoum is the democratically elected president of the country. 
 
The European Union and France both saying, for instance, that they only recognize him. And even better, ECOWAS the regional bloc in West Africa said they would not accept any purported resignation by President Mohamed Bazoum. 
 
But on the street other people marching against France, against ECOWAS and against international meddling in Niger. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MADOWO (voice-over): Angry Nigerians smashing windows of the French Embassy in the capital of Niamey. Thousands of people outrage at the country's former colonial power, a day after it suspended aid and financial support for Niger with immediate effect. 
 
Down with France, some said, condemning French support for ousted President Mohamed Bazoum the African president. Unable to get into the heavily protected compound, windows set afire and a French flag trashed. A common sight since Wednesdays military coup. Security forces eventually deployed teargas to disperse the protesters. France warned it would retaliate immediately and in a strict manner in case of any attack against is Embassy, national army or diplomats, adding that President Emmanuel Macron will not tolerate any protests against France and its interest. The military would do that ousted the West African countries democratically elected president came to show France and the world that it has the backing of the public. 
 
MAMAN SANI, PROTESTER (through translator): We are here to tell President Macron of France that Niger belongs to us. It's up to us to do what we want with Niger. What we want. We deal with who we want and how we want. And we are for and support the army. 
 
MADOWO (voice-over): A sea of people outside Niger's Parliament, denouncing France and some raising Russian flags. As anti-French sentiment has grown in the country, many have warmed up to Russia. Long live Putin and long live Russia. The protesters say demanding that the foreign armies leave the country. France has about 1,500 troops in Niger, a key ally in the fight against terrorism in the Sahara. The U.S. has 1,000 troops in the country involving counterterrorism operations. 
 
IBRAHIM, RETAILER (through translator): As citizens of Niger, we are against French bases, American bases, Canadian bases, Italian bases, all the bases that are in Niger, we don't need them. 
 
MADOWO (voice-over): The head of the Presidential Guard, Gen. Omar Tchiani, deposed his boss and declared himself Niger's new leader on Friday. Saying he would suspend the constitution and rule with a so- called national consult for the safe guard of the homeland. 
 
ZEINABOU BOUKARI, PROTESTER (through translator): They're really brave and I support them 100 percent. We've really suffered a lot. We've suffered a lot because they are our children. A lot of blood has been shed in Niger. We want peace. 
 
MADOWO (voice-over): In neighboring Nigeria, an emergency summit of the community of Economic Community of West African States, ECOWAS. Regional leaders announced sanctions, including closing borders, a travel ban, a no-fly zone, freezing assets and a deadline. ECOWAS have given the Niger junta one week to reinstate President Bazoum, are present to take all measures to restore his government. 
 
OMAR ALIEU TOURAY, ECOWAS COMMISSION PRESIDENT: In the event the authority's demands are not met within one week, take all measures necessary to restore constitutional order in the Republic of Niger. Such measures may include the use of force. For this effect, the chiefs of defense staff of ECOWAS to meet immediately. 
 
MADOWO (voice-over): But many protesters in the streets don't want any ECOWAS military intervention or involvement and the military junta says it's ready. 
 
COLONEL-MAYOR AMADOU ABDRAMANE, NIGER MILITARY JUNTA CNSP (through translator): We once again remind ECOWAS and those who wish to adventure in this of our firm determination to defend our country. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
MADOWO (on camera): The traditional president of Niger's neighbor Chad, Mahamat Idriss Deby, has been in Niamey meeting for the first time with both President Mohamed Bazoum and with General Abdourahmane Tchiani, who used to head the presidential guard and now has declared himself leader of the country. 
 <br>[04:25:00]
 
This is the first time that we have seen a public picture of President Mohamed Bazoum who has received calls from -- of support from world leaders, from the U.S., from France, from the African Union, from ECOWAS and maintained that he will not resign because he's the democratically elected leader of Niger. 
 
The clock is sticking here. ECOWAS has now six days to determine if it will militarily intervene in the situation. And it's interesting that Mohamed Bazoum said that the immediate in Niger on behalf of ECOWAS, even though Chad is not a member of ECOWAS, because he too was not democratically elected. He took over power in 2021, after his dad died in battle. And yet, he's the man that's going to Niamey to try and get this military man to hand over back power to a civilian president -- Max. 
 
FOSTER: OK, Larry in Nairobi, thank you. 
 
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said a meeting of 14 Palestinian factions was a first step to end division and to achieve national unity. His comments came Sunday during talks between rival factions in Egypt at the time when violence between Israeli -- Israel and Palestinians has surged. The talks followed a meeting between Abbas and the Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh last week where the two leaders agreed to find ways to end internal divisions. 
 
Still ahead, a horrific instance in California. A man stabbed a woman to death and then post her final moments on Facebook. Up ahead, details of the charges that he's facing. 
 
Plus, in Arkansas, a judge blocks a new law that would make it a crime for librarians to provide certain materials to minors. More on that, just ahead.
