FREDRICKA WHITFIELD, CNN ANCHOR:  Hello, again, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me this Saturday. I'm Fredricka Whitfield. 
 
And we begin this hour with stunning revelations in the Gilgo Beach serial killings. According to "The Chester News and Reporter," a search warrant at a South Carolina property owned by the suspect sought possible trophies and other items taken after the killings. The local paper reported that those items include victims' photos, bibles, and even a specific type of bounty paper towels. 
 
Last week's arrest of 59-year-old Rex Heuermann coming as a shock to his family, and now neighbors are speaking out about what authorities think happened just next door as CNN's Jean Casarez reports. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)
 
JEAN CASAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Crime scene investigators continue to process the scene at defendant Rex Heuermann's home on Long Island. The murders of the three victims may have occurred in 2008 and 2009, but investigators continue their pursuit to find any evidence that can help prosecutors in the upcoming trial. Neighbors in the area still stand in disbelief. 
 
ETIENNE DEVILLIERS, REX HEUERMANN'S NEIGHBOR:  The guy was odd and strange, but never violent. 
 
CASAREZ:  Neighbors of suspected serial killer Rex Heuermann speaking out about his past behavior. One telling "News Nation" Heuermann dug holes in his backyard. Nnother saying they remained friendly after a confrontation 28 years ago when Heuermann would look over the fence and try to talk to his wife while she was sunbathing. 
 
DEVILLIERS:  It happened so many times that finally I pulled him over, and we had a talk. CASAREZ:  Residents in this Long Island suburb still in shock. 
 
DEVILLIERS:  For something like this to happen and right under our nose. 
 
CASAREZ:  As authorities continue to collect and investigate potential evidence, they are now trying to determine if the alleged serial killer may have committed the murders of Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman, and Amber Costello right in his own home. Investigators are combing through Heuermann's home searching for clues, including personal effects linked to the victims. 
 
SHERIFF ERROL D. TOULON, JR., SUFFOLK COUNTY:  Every piece of evidence that can be gathered, whether it's in storage containers or from his home, could be valuable not only to the murders that he's currently being charged with, but more importantly if we can connect him to other murders. 
 
CASAREZ:  But it is the forensic evidence from possible victims that will establish the home as the primary crime scene. Documents show authorities believe they already have circumstantial evidence that points to the Long Island home where victims may have been murdered. In 2022, a comprehensive investigation revealed for the first time Heuermann used burner phones to arrange dates with the victims. Documents state before each victim went missing, triangulation of cell phone tower data showed the burner phones and the victims' phones traveled to Massapequa, Long Island, at about the same time as Heuermann, where his family home was located. They were never seen again. 
 
Heuermann was charged in the murder of the three women. He has pleaded not guilty. 
 
Legal documents also revealed Heuermann's wife, Asa Ellerup, was out of town each and every time the three victims were last seen. On Thursday, Heuermann's wife filing for divorce from her husband of more than 27 years, her attorney telling CNN in a statement, "The sensitive nature of her husband's arrest is taking an emotional toll on the immediate and extended family, especially their elderly family members." 
 
Authorities also expanding the investigation as well as looking to see if Heuermann is connected to unsolved homicide cases in Nevada, South Carolina, and New Jersey. 
 
The next court date for this New York city architect is set for August 1st.

WHITFIELD:  Jean Casarez, thank you so much. 
 
I'm joined now by Casey Jordan for more perspective on this investigation. She's a criminologist, a behavioral analyst, and attorney. Casey, so great to see you. Oh, my gosh. 
 
CASEY JORDAN, BEHAVIORAL ANALYST:  Good to be here. 
 
WHITFIELD:  We've heard investigators use the term he was leading a doubled life. This is a married father who is now accused of these heinous crimes, and now we're hearing investigators talking about some of these crimes may have taken place right in the home. And he is being dubbed a serial killer. Is this in step with all that you know and have studied about the behavior of a serial killer? 
 
JORDAN:  Yes, and I hate to say, whenever we catch these serial killers, the neighbors say the same thing. We're surprised, he was such a nice, mild-mannered guy, precisely the kind of guy you'd sit down at the bar and have a beer with. But of course, they always are, Fredricka, because that's how they get away with it. They hide in plain sight by having a normal life, by having a family, a full-time job, being upstanding members of their community. 
 <br>[14:05:04]
 
And of course, they have a double life because when the family is not around or when they're traveling, that is when they commit the murders. And by definition, serial killers are successful killers are successful killers because they have this double life. So as the profile unfolds and we look more into the life of Rex Heuermann, I have to tell you, from a criminological standpoint, Fred, he is absolutely good for it. It is precisely the sort of personality, family life, occupation, killing in his comfort zone, dumping bodies in his comfort zone near where he lives, because we would never imagine that we have a monster in our backyard or living next door to us. That's how he got away with it. 
 
WHITFIELD:  Wow, it's astounding. Even to hear the neighbors who say, they may have said in one step, yes, he was strange, but then they also said we can't believe this was happening right under our noses. And the same can be said for the family, the wife and the children, that if allegedly these crimes were happening right in the home, even when they were away, that somehow, even when they came back, there would be no suspicion or nothing strange or -- I mean, to hear that possibly any of that suspicion escaped them as well, that just seems remarkable, and nearly impossible. So how is it possible? 
 
JORDAN:  Because of the level of deceit that these killers are capable of. They are like Academy Award level actors. They compartmentalize the part of them that is the sex addict, the sexual sadist, the power control person who will not take an argument from somebody they're paying for sex. That is a part of them that their wives and children, their coworkers never see. 
 
We've seen this before. Robert Hansen, the called "Butcher Baker" from Anchorage, Alaska, Kendall Francois, who killed eight women in his own home where he lived with his parents and his sister. And it's usually these families are marked by a level of dysfunction where there's just not a lot of communication going on, the marriage isn't really good, and the wife and the kids are out of the house a lot. In fact, that's why they're looking in South Carolina, New Jersey, Nevada, because we know he travelled there. And if he was in the habit of hiring sex workers and an argument would arise, and he would say, wait, I paid you, you must do what I like, and perhaps strangled them to death, which is what we believe most likely happened to these victims, then he might dispose them in that local area and then go back to his family, who are none the wiser. 
 
So I have to say from a variety of vantage points, Mr. Heuermann does look good for it, but most of all because the three women for whom he's charged, and I'm sure we'll see a fourth soon, were buried on the beach 20 minutes from where he lived. And usually these killers do kill where they are comfortable, where they know their surroundings, because, again, that's part of the grift. 
 
WHITFIELD:  So what do you believe the extent of the search -- I mean, how is this search conducted of these other properties, the South Carolina, Nevada properties? What might they be looking for? 
 
JORDAN:  Well, they're going to look for any bodies found and unsolved murders, cold cases, particularly with victims that fit the victimology pattern of Mr. Heuermann's alleged murders. So you're going to be looking for street women, women who are vulnerable, they're sex workers, they're overly trusting. They will get in the car with him or go to his hotel room or go to his rental house where he's visiting and fixing things.
 
The big key is, does he know these areas well enough that if he slips up and kills somebody -- because I don't think he really goes out planning to kill anybody. I think that in the process of a sexual encounter, an argument will arise and he will want to prove to them who is boss, and then a strangulation or perhaps beating will happen. But I don't think he's predatory to where he goes tonight is the night where I might kill someone. So --
 
WHITFIELD:  I thought predatory goes with the terminology of serial killer. 
 
JORDAN:  Not necessarily. Let's just say that it's in their subconscious that they're capable of killing, and they make the argument arise so that they have an excuse to kill. But when you're having a sex worker come to you, then the stalking and the adduction is kind of obviated. So he's going to kill in comfort zones, they're going to look at unsolved crimes. And if they have DNA from any bodies found, especially where there's been a sexual assault, they're going to try to match that DNA to Mr. Heuermann to see if there's a link. 
 
WHITFIELD:  Wow, it's incredible. Casey Jordan, thank you so much. Appreciate your expertise on this. 
 
JORDAN:  Great to be here, Fredricka. 
 
WHITFIELD:  This week on "The Whole Story with Anderson Cooper," the Gilgo Beach killer will encompass that entire hour. We'll have the story of the alleged crimes, the victims, the families, all of it, and the man who is now at the center of it, the man that investigators call a demon. Here is a preview. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[14:10:04]
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He is growing into the suspect because you now have a car, you have a face, you have the geographic connection. But that is circumstantial. They need that thin hair of evidence that is going to go from circumstantial to certainty. And the thin hair of evidence turns out to be a thin hair. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Two of those hairs apparently, according to the document that we've read, can be connected to his wife, and one of them can be connected straight to him. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Now we're in a different place. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Today is a good day. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  What did it feel like to tell the public we got the guy, this is who he is? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It felt good. It's the reason why I became a police officer. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Ladies and gentlemen, Rex Heuermann is a demon that walks among us. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WHITFIELD:  Don't miss the new episode of "The Whole Story" tomorrow night 8:00 p.m. right here on CNN. 
 
And more gruesomeness to tell you about. In Mexico officials have launched an investigation after 28 bodies were found in graves on a property located in the city along the U.S.-Mexican border. A missing persons group made the discovery after receiving an anonymous tip on Facebook. CNN's Rafael Romo is here with more on all of this. So this city is in a region affected by organized crime. Do they believe there's a correlation? 
 
RAFAEL ROMO, CNN SENIOR LATIN AMERICAN AFFAIRS EDITOR:  Yes, it's the state of Tamaulipas, and we have reported for a long time how bad the situation is there because of different criminal gangs facing each other. And it's not only how gruesome this case has been, but also the fact that in an ideal world you would expect that this is the result of a police investigation, Fred, that this is the ultimate step, finding these victims is the ultimate step of a very thorough investigation. In reality, as you mentioned, it was a missing persons group that found these people at great risk to themselves and their families. These are people who have been looking for loved ones for months and years in many cases. We talked to one of those volunteers and this is what she had to say. Let's take a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
EDITH GONZALEZ TREVLNO, VOLUNTEER SEARCHING FOR MISSING PEOPLE (through translator):  Authorities have made the decision of helping us to search every month or every two months. So we made the decision to go out on our own to search. These last few months if what we have been doing. We began to go out alone without police escort, without any type of protection, and, well, we entered dangerous places, right. But more than anything, we want to find those missing to be able to locate them. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ROMO:  So, again, Fred, they're doing this on their own. And just to give our viewers a better idea of the area we're talking about, this is right across the border from McAllen, Texas, Hidalgo, Texas. This is Reynosa, in the state of Tamaulipas. This is where the four Americans were attacked at gunpoint back in March, two of them died. I remember reporting in 2010 that 72 migrants from Central America were found dead as well in mass graves. So very, very dangerous territory. 
 
WHITFIELD:  Who owns that property? Is it like a no man's land or state property? 
 
ROMO:  This particular case was private property, but the mass graves in other cases have been really found everywhere. 
 
WHITFIELD:  Oh, my gosh. Thank you so much, Rafael Romo, appreciate that. 
 
Still ahead, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy is defending his country's counteroffensive. What he says about the slow progress so far and what he insists is coming next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:17:42]
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is CNN breaking news. 
 
WHITFIELD:  This breaking news right now in Greece, thousands are being evacuated as wildfires rage out of control. CNN learning that 12 hotels are being evacuated. Around 10,000 tourists on the island of Rhodes are leaving by foot and by sea as fires and smoke balloon into the sky, closing in on properties and beaches. Greece is currently experiencing its longest heat wave on record. Temperatures have soared into triple digits for almost three weeks now. 
 
And for much of this week, thousands of Israelis have joined a march from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to protest a controversial overhaul of the country's judicial system. Let's go straight to Hadas Gold. She is live for us now in Jerusalem. Hadas, what have you been seeing today? 
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, so we are just outside of the Supreme Court. This was the end point, the culmination of that five- day march where tens of thousands set off from Tel Aviv, marching on foot here towards Jerusalem. Today was the final day of it. It was really hot today. It's 95 degrees, but that did not stop tens of thousands from marching the rest, the final portion of it. It's ending here in front of the Supreme Court, and even further down behind me in front of the Israeli parliament. 
 
The reason for this march is because starting tomorrow the final votes are expected to be undertaken for part of that judicial overhaul. This legislation specifically would strip the Israel Supreme Court's ability to make government actions unreasonable, and protesters believe that without that, that is a vital check on government power, because unlike in the United States, there's just the parliament that's controlled by the party in power, and the government is also essentially the same as the parliament. So they see the Supreme Court as the only check on power. And that's why they're coming out in force. 
 
Bolstering the protesters are army reservists, hundreds of air force reservists have said they will not serve if the legislation passes. And just tonight, another organization that says they represent thousands of army reservists have said that they will not serve, they will not heed the call to serve if it comes if this legislation passes. As we speak the largest labor union in Israel is currently meeting. That could mean that they may decide to strike. 
 <br>[14:20:01]
 
There's increasing pressure on the government to back off this legislation. But all signs from Benjamin Netanyahu and his government are pointing to they don't plan to back down. They still plan to take these votes on Sunday, on Monday. And if it passes, this is the first aspect of this mass judicial overhaul that will pass and could potentially become law. Fred? 
 
WHITFIELD:  Very significant. Hadas Gold in Jerusalem, thank you so much. 
 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says that what has been slated as a slow start to the country's much anticipated counteroffensive will soon pick up steam. Deploying new weapons like U.S.-supplied cluster munitions could help vindicate that optimism as Ukrainian forces look to push back an increasingly aggressive Russian presence along the eastern front. CNN's senior international correspondent Fred Pleitgen is joining us now from Berlin. Fred, good to see you. So what do we know about Russia's eastern push right now? 
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there, Fredricka. Most of that is in the northeastern part of the front, and we've really been seeing that shape up over the past couple of days. But now the Ukrainians are saying along pretty much all sectors the northeastern front that the Russians are trying to push forward there and are trying to gain territory. 
 
There's two sort of areas that the Russians are especially focusing on in that northeastern part of Ukraine. One of them is a town called Kupiansk, which is very far in the northeast. And the Ukrainians say the Russians have concentrated about 100,000 troops, as well as hundreds of tanks and multiple rocket launching systems. The other is a place a little further south called Lyman. I was there a couple of months ago. That is an extremely brutal, dangerous battlefield. It's in a forested area. The Ukrainians describe that as a very dynamic front, but also one where it's very difficult to make territorial gains. The Ukrainians do acknowledge that they are on the back foot, but they
 
 also say that by and large they are able to hold the line. A picture, of course, very different in the south of the country where the Ukrainians are saying that they are making advances, and that is where those comments from Volodymyr Zelenskyy that you just managed -- that you just said, they become so important. The Ukrainians acknowledging that so far the counteroffensive is going fairly slow. He says the reason for that is that the counteroffensive was delayed. It was delayed, he says, because they lacked munitions in the spring and also because they were still training on some of those western supplied weapons to be able to use them. And Zelenskyy says that that gave the Russians time to fortify their defenses down there in the south, but also to lay those massive minefields. And the Ukrainians are now saying they're starting to clear those minefields. It's a difficult process, and they hope that will help them speed things up, Fredricka. 
 
WHITFIELD:  Big obstacles, for sure. Fred Pleitgen, thanks so much. 
 
Coming up, UPS and the teamster head back to the negotiating table, hoping to avoid a massive strike within just days until the deadline to reach a deal. That's next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:27:17]
 
WHITFIELD:  Blistering heat and flash floods are hitting the U.S. again today. Boston getting hammered, as heavy rains hit the city overnight. Fenway Park flooding, forced the suspension of the Red Sox- Mets game. Rainwater cascading down the steps like a waterfall, people there looking very miserable. And Gilette stadium shut down the Luke Combs concert as lightning flashed overhead. Fans were forced to shelter in place. And 33 million people are under severe weather threats today, and it's not just the concern of storms. Heat warnings are in effect for 80 million people from California to Florida. Cities like Phoenix continuing to set records for 22 straight days. It's been over 110 degrees in the Arizona capital. Pretty unbearable. 
 
Today UPS employed teamsters and leadership held a rally in Atlanta just days before contract talks are set to resume on Tuesday. It will be the first time the two sides have met in two weeks as they attempt to reach a deal by a July 31st deadline. And if they don't, some 340,000 UPS workers could go on strike. CNN's Isabel Rosales is live for us in Atlanta. So you spoke with UPS workers. What are they saying? What are their worries? 
 
ISABEL ROSALES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  They're certainly worried that a deal won't come to pass. But having said that, they are ready to go on strike if they can't pull a deal together. In fact, for the past two weeks since those talks broke down, they have been practicing picketing lines. They've been practicing rallies across the U.S. The biggest leverage point that they have are their numbers. They have 340,000 union members that are UPS workers. So they feel that they're in a powerful position here to get what they say that they're owed. 
 
It would be costly, however, if we do enter into a strike here, if we see a strike happen. Anderson Economic Group, that's a research firm based out of Michigan, estimates that a 10-day UPS strike would cost the U.S. economy about $7 billion, making it the costliest work stoppage in U.S. history. 
 
So let's get into what the sticking point is here in the negotiations. Both sides say 95 percent of the contract, of this new contract has been worked out, they figured it out. But that five percent that's left, the sticking point really here is part-time workers. These are not drivers. These are exclusively package handlers and sorters. But without these folks you're not going to get the package delivered to your front door, business or homeowner. Their starting salary is $16.20, on average they make $20. They say they can't live off of that money, especially in places like California and New York. The average UPS full-time worker makes $95,000 a year. 
 <br>[14:30:03]
 
But they're all unified in this, and getting ready to strike if it comes to that. Listen to what one of these part-time workers had to say. She has three boys, and she says she can barely pay her bills. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ELIZABETH LASTER, PART TIME UPS PACKAGE HANDLER:  The packages don't move unless we move them. The stuff doesn't go anywhere unless we move it. We're the ones that are making all of that money and stuff, and we don't see it, any of it. Like you're getting million-dollar salaries and billion-dollar salaries and stuff, and we're over here struggling to survive. How is that fair? You've already gotten our blood, our sweat, our tears, and everything. It's taxing on the body. You've gotten that from us. Just give us what we've worked for. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ROSALES:  And UPS, meanwhile, calls this a historic economic package. Part of their statement here I want to read real quick, "We are prepared to increase our industry leading pay and benefits but need to work quickly to finalize a fair deal that provides certainty for our customers, our employees and businesses across the country." Obviously, this is going to be a big, big week, and this will be a big deal if they enter -- 
 
WHITFIELD:  Working quickly is the operative word. July 31st is right around the corner. 
 
ROSALES:  Yes, they need to have a tentative deal. And if they don't, August 1st, 12:01 a.m., the strike goes through. 
 
WHITFIELD:  Keep us posted. Isabel Rosales, thank you so much. 
 
Straight ahead, tributes are pouring in for singer Tony Bennett. We'll take a look and listen to his legendary career next.

WHITFIELD:  Tributes are pouring in for legendary singer Tony Bennett who died Friday at the age of 96. In a career spanning eight decades, Bennett won 19 Grammy Awards and a lifetime achievement award. CNN's Stephanie Elam has more. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)
 
STEPHANIE ELAM, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  A legend on stage, Tony Bennett's career spanned more than 70 years. He was opening up for Pearl Bailey when Bob Hope discovered him in 1949 in a New York City club. 
 
BOB HOPE, COMEDIAN:  It's been about 16 years since I discovered you singing in a Greenwich Village nightclub. How come this is your first appearance on my television show? 
 
TONY BENNETT, SINGER:  Well, I've been waiting for you to make good. 
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
ELAM:  Bennett had a string of hits in the 50s, but the best was yet to come. He won his first Grammy award in 1963 for his song "I Left My Heart in San Francisco" and performed it on "The Judy Garland Show." 
 
The crooner's unique voice and timeless style helped him win a total of 19 Grammys and two Emmys throughout his career. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Tony Bennett, ladies and gentlemen, maybe the best pop singer in the whole world. 
 
BENNETT:  I asked Sinatra, why do you think we stayed around so long? And he said because we stayed with good songs. 
 
ELAM:  But the classics weren't always hits. In the 70s, Bennett found himself without a recording contract, he was in debt, and battling a drug problem. 
 
BENNETT:  I realized that I thought I was doing well with the drugs, and I really wasn't. 
 
ELAM:  That's when Bennett's son Danny stepped in as his manager. Bennett re-signed with Colombia Records and began to revitalize his career. It was then he discovered a new audience, the MTV generation. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Look, it's Tony Bennett! 
 
BENNETT:  Hey, good to see you. 
 
I had "The Simpsons," we did a commercial for MTV, and they liked it so much they gave me an unplugged special. And it won album of the year. 
 
(SINGING)
 
ELAM:  Bennett went on to collaborate with singers like Amy Winehouse for "Body and Soul" and Lady Gaga for "The Lady is a Tramp". 
 
(SINGING)
 
ELAM:  At 85, he became the oldest living artist to hit number one on the Billboard 200 chart with his "Duets 2" album. Several years later he toured with Lady Gaga to promote their album "Cheek to Cheek." Yet Bennett's talent when beyond singing. He was an accomplished painter with artwork at the Smithsonian. 
 
BENNETT:  I've had a sound life because I've always known what I wanted to do.
 
ELAM:  The son of a grocer and a seamstress, Bennett married three times and had four children. He and his third wife, Susan, founded the Exploring the Arts Foundation and opened the Frank Sinatra School of the Arts in New York. 
 
BENNETT:  Everybody has a dream, a hope that something is going to work for them. And then when it happens, it's a great joy. 
 
ELAM:  Bennett was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2016, but with the encouragement of his doctors kept doing what he loved best, singing. 
 
(SINGING)
 
ELAM:  He cut his final album "Love for Sale" with Lady Gaga, and performed with her one last time in two sold-out concerts for his 95th birthday. 
 
LADY GAGA, SINGER:  He's my musical companion. He's the greatest singer in the whole world. 
 
ELAM:  Aired on CBS, it was a moving tribute to a musical legend. 
 
(SINGING)
 
(APPLAUSE)

WHITFIELD:  I just can't get enough of Tony Bennett. Our thanks to CNN's Stephanie Elam for that beautiful tribute. 
 
With us now, Christopher John Farley. He is the senior director of arts and programming at PBS. Christopher, so great to see you, and to hear that you have quite the history with Tony Bennett, right? You had the opportunity to interview him about his career for "The Wall Street Journal" and you even produced a mini concert with him? 
 <br>[14:40:10] CHRISTOPHER JOHN FARLEY, SENIOR DIRECTOR, ARTS PROGRAMMING AND DEVELOPMENT, PBS:  Yes, it was great to spend time with Tony Bennett. Terrific guy. I'll never forget that I used to run a showcase for "The Wall Street Journal" where we would bring in artists and they would to an interview with me and sing a few songs. And he came in and he was terrific, he was great, he was warm to everybody. When he did his warm-up, he had a scarf wrapped around his neck. He only croaked out the words. I'm going, what's going on? Did Tony lose it? This was back in 2011. 
 
But then when it came to actually performing, man, he belted it out, he hit all those notes, he was incredible. And I realized that's why he had survived for so long. That's why his career was so long, because he knew when to belt it out, he knew when to hit those notes, when the spotlight was on. And before that, in the warm-ups, he was going to preserve his voice. So it was a great lesson for me and for everyone there. This is why Tony Bennett is the great that he is. 
 
WHITFIELD:  That's beautiful. That was the warm-up, it's like an athlete who does stretches before they actually engage in the game or perform. And that's what he was doing. He was protecting those vocal cords. That's a great story. 
 
He often said, and we heard it in Stephanie's piece, that he felt like he never really worked a day of his life because he was doing what he loved. He was performing music. And then in a visual art form, his paintings, extraordinary. 
 
FARLEY:  Exactly. And also, he's a guy that did what he loved. I remember when I did do that mini concert with him at "The Wall Street Journal," he sent in a list of the songs he wanted to perform, and I had to go clear the rights for them before he stepped on stage. And one of the songs he wanted to sing was "On the Sunny Side of the Street." And I was having a devil of a time trying to get the people, the rights holders, to come down and give us a price for the rights that "The Wall Street Journal" could afford, because we're a newspaper. They weren't like a radio station or a performance space, really. 
 
And so in the end we couldn't get the rights, and I had to tell him we couldn't get the rights for "On the Sunny Side of the Street," so I'm afraid that Mr. Bennett can't sing it. And I remember he passed word through his manager, like, you don't really tell Tony Bennett what to song. And he sang it anyway. He didn't care that we weren't going to broadcast it. He didn't care who was going to hear. He wanted to sing that song on that stage at that time. That's exactly what he did. And he was fantastic. 
 
WHITFIELD:  Wow. He was also a champion for civil rights, marching, even, from Selma to Montgomery back in 1965. Where did that come from that he had that compass to be moved by what he believed the right thing was and to do the right thing? 
 
FARLEY:  That's exactly right. And I talked to him about that, because I always admired him because of his early commitment to civil rights back when it was a real risk for him. He put himself in physical danger supporting Martin Luther King in that march from Selma to Montgomery in 1965. And he told me it came from the Army, in part, because when he was in the Army he saw segregation up close. He was prevented from heading out with some of his friends who happened to be black because officials in the Army didn't want to have fraternization between whites in the army and blacks in the Army. And that always upset him. He really wanted to see social justice done. 
 
And so when he had the chance as a celebrity, as a singer, to give back to help stop some of the wrongs he saw happening, he was all too willing to go down, support Martin Luther King and put his career and his body at risk because that's what he knew was right. He didn't like the way he saw people like Duke Ellington treated, and he saw him getting forced out of venues because they were black. And so he was willing to put his career, his life on the line in support of civil rights. And that's another reason why he's so beloved. 
 
WHITFIELD:  Wow, so beloved, 96 years old. Tony Bennett, what a legend. Christopher John Farley, thank you so much for sharing your intimate relationship with him. We appreciate it. 
 
FARLEY:  Thank you. I appreciate it.
 
WHITFIELD:  Still to come, tennis sensation Chris Eubanks reflecting on his incredible Wimbledon run, the upcoming U.S. Open championship, and how his newfound fame is changing his life.

CHRIS EUBANKS, TENNIS PLAYER:  That's kind of the new thing now. Hey, do you want to grab dinner? I can't. Oh, wow, so famous now. 
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
EUBANKS:  We're all enjoying it and taking it in stride.

WHITFIELD:  Keep this stuff a priority. Some of the best advice given to American tennis phenom 27-year-old Chris Eubanks, his rise in the tennis stratosphere has been long fought after his remarkable success as a top player at his alma mater of Georgia Tech, his first ATP tour win in Mallorca earlier this month, and that epic quarterfinals battle at Wimbledon within the last week-and-a-half. Well, next week he is the main draw at the Atlanta Open, and after that the U.S. Open, where a while back he was a practice partner, but now a headliner, which has fans clambering for tickets to see him. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)
 
WHITFIELD: You just seem like you're cool as a cucumber out there. You're very graceful. 
 <br>[14:50:00]
 
And you are so focused, and there's so much going on around you, and you don't seem to engage with all that is around you, but you are staying very insular and focused. So now with all of this, all these trappings of stardom, does it add new pressure, do you think it changes your approach at all? 
 
CHRIS EUBANKS, TENNIS PLAYER:  No, I honestly don't think it does. I think if this had happened earlier in my career, it probably would. But I think now I'm just more mature. I've seen the ups and downs of professional tennis, myself, from other players. And the one thing that I think is the common denominator with players who have lots of success is they keep the primary thing, the primary thing. And that's the tennis. That's the process, that's what got them to that point. So that's always going to be first and foremost I think with me, something that I'm going to do my best, and I think my coach would also do a good job of emphasizing, we need to keep this stuff the priority. 
 
But it is pretty cool, like you say, to have people talking about you in terms of someone who can do a deep run in a tournament, maybe possibly win a tournament. So all that's cool, that's great. But as long as I continue my process and I stay giving 100 percent when I step foot on the court, whatever the result is, it is. You're not going to find me complaining about it too much as long as I can honestly look at myself in the mirror and say I did all the stuff I was supposed to do, today just didn't go my way, and then move on. 
 
WHITFIELD:  Move on. Next week, a week at a time, right.
 
EUBANKS:  Exactly.
 
WHITFIELD:  You set another record. You're 27 and you set a record for the first black American man to reach Wimbledon quarters in 27 years. So 27 is your lucky number. 
 
EUBANKS:  It is. I didn't put that together, but that's actually really cool. 
 
WHITFIELD:  If you play the numbers, you might want to add 27. 
 
EUBANKS:  I should have played it last week to see if I won the Powerball. 
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
WHITFIELD:  Looking forward, U.S. Open. What is that -- what do you envision? You've already been there as a spectator. You know what the arena is like. You'll be center court, Arthur Ashe stadium. You mentioned he's one of your idols. 
 
EUBANKS:  That's going to be unlike any other U.S. Open I think I've ever been to. I've played in the Open before. Last year I won my first grand slam match at the Open, so it's a tournament that always so, so special to me. But I think this year is going to be different. I joked with some friends, the Open is going to be a circus this year. It's going to be, when we go to the practice --
 
WHITFIELD:  People are buying tickets to see you. 
 
EUBANKS:  Yes, I know, and that's the crazy part, that's the crazy thing to think about. Fans are usually there just clambering for autographs, yelling, can I get Serena, Venus, Roger, Novak? And that's going to, I think, be the first telltale sign. I'm also used to walking through the grounds, going and watching friends play, just sitting on the side, maybe some people will notice me or ask for a quick picture here and there. I kind of get lost in the mix. But this year it's going to be very, very interesting. I'm going to see how the reception that I get amongst the fans, I think will be great. But, again, it's going to be a tournament that I'm really going to focus in on trying to keep the main thing the main thing, and that's going to be tennis. 
 
WHITFIELD:  You're an idol, whether you like it or not. As you mentioned, people are coming up to you and yelling your name, and it's your new world. So what do you want to symbolize or teach people? 
 
EUBANKS:  Honestly, I was asked this question during Wimbledon and I couldn't figure out an answer. But I think now after I've had some time to think about it, it's more so just about perseverance and just understanding that what's meant to happen for you is going to happen in its own time. The most frustrating thing about it, I think we as people, we think we can control so much. And I'm a control freak. My friends will tell you. But I think just understanding that what's meant to happen is going to happen in its own time, but you have to continue to trust and have faith that it will happen and continue to put in the work leading up to it. It may not happen when you want it to and when you think it should, but I think where I'm sitting right now in my career is a pretty good example of just trusting it and just going all in and just saying when it happens, it's going to happen, and let's just let the rest play out when it does. 
 
WHITFIELD:  I love that philosophy. Your friends, are they treating you any differently? 
 
EUBANKS:  Yes, the one thing that they are saying, if I can't meet up for lunch, they're saying, oh, you're too big for me now. But so far everyone has been great. It's been fun. It's a little joke amongst us. But that's kind of the new thing now. Do you want to grab dinner? I can't. Oh, wow, so famous now. We're all enjoying it and taking it in stride. 
 
WHITFIELD:  We're glad you had time for us. 
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
EUBANKS:  Absolutely. Thank you so much. Appreciate it.
 
WHITFIELD:  Chris Eubanks, what a pleasure. Thank you so much. All the best to you. 
 
EUBANKS:  Thank you.

WHITFIELD:  One to watch. The Atlanta Open this week and then after that, U.S. open. 
 
Of the more than 30,000 veterans who experience homelessness in the United States, many are living in or near military towns. In Fayetteville, North Carolina, home to Fort Liberty, this week's CNN Hero was struggling to survive after a brain injury when she saw veterans in need. Her own road to recovery took a turn, and she made it her personal mission to give back to those who have served their country.

STACEY BUCKNER, CNN HERO:  It's just filling a basic human need. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I like this establishment, this setup you've got. 
 
BUCKNER:  This is my brick and mortar. 
 
Even though I'm not a veteran, I do have mental health issues that come with having a traumatic brain injury, so I can relate. 
 
You've been burning the road up in that walker, I know that much. 
 
Sometimes I really do surprise people with who I am. Look at me, I look really rough around the edges, right? 
 
What's up, brother? What else do you need? 
 
I'm all tatted up, and I may throw out a cuss every now and then. But I'm just Stacey. It's important to show them that there are organizations out there that want to provide support to you.

WHITFIELD:  Powerful work, Stacey. To see more, go to CNNheroes.com. 
 
And thanks so much for joining me today. I'm Fredricka Whitfield. I hope to see you back here tomorrow. But before we go, a very special welcome and congratulations to the newest member of our CNN family. So sweet. Lillian Nora, she was born on Sunday to parents Daniel and Shannon. Daniel is a member of my team right here in Atlanta, and Lillian is getting to know big sister Madeleine (ph) now, their dog Chub (ph), and Binks (ph) the cat. We're thrilled for Daniel and his new baby girl, the whole brood there. Congratulations.
