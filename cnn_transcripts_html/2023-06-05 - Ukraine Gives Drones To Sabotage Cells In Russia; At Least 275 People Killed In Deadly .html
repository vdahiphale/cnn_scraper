BECKY ANDERSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: I'm Becky Anderson live from Abu Dhabi. This is CONNECT THE WORLD. It is 6:00 in the evening here. Coming up 
 
 this hour. A CNN exclusive Ukraine giving drones to "sabotage cells inside Russia."
 
The Indian government launches a probe as rail traffic resumes after that deadly weekend crash. All prices spike after Saudi Arabia promises further 
 
 voluntary cotton its output.
 
And later this hour. Karim Benzema bids farewell to Real Madrid. But where will he end up next?
 
We begin with exclusive CNN reporting. Sources telling us that Kyiv has cultivated a network of saboteurs to carry out attacks inside Russia. U.S. 
 
 officials believe Ukraine is providing these sabotage cells with drones, including the ones that hit the Kremlin last month.
 
Well, CNN's Natasha Bertrand is part of the CNN team with this exclusive reporting. She joins us now from Washington, just walk us through what you 
 
 have.
 
NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: Yes, Becky. So, what we're learning is that this kind of steady drumbeat of attacks that we have seen 
 
 inside Russia over the last several weeks and months appear to be the work of partisans of pro-Ukrainian operatives, and agents who are well trained 
 
 in this kind of warfare who have been essentially carrying out attacks on Ukraine's behalf.
 
And not only that, but it appears according to our sources, that Ukraine has actually been providing these saboteurs with drones. And of course, we 
 
 know that Ukraine has a very well-honed drone manufacturing industry and it's only getting bigger. And so, what we're told is that that Kremlin 
 
 attack early -- last month on May 3rd where we saw two drones actually strike the Kremlin Senate palace.
 
That was carried out according to U.S. officials by some of the sabotage cells inside Russia. In other words, they did not launch the drones from 
 
 Ukraine, they launched them from inside Russia, itself. Now it is not clear how the Ukrainians are actually getting these drones into Russia. But we 
 
 are told from these sources that there are some pretty well-practiced smuggling routes from Ukraine into Russia that might be -- being used to 
 
 get the drones and other equipment to these pro-Ukrainian sabotage cells.
 
And we should note that we did ask the Ukrainians for comment and this Ukrainian Security Service said "We will comment on instances of cotton 
 
 only after our victory. Cotton is a slang word that Ukrainians use, of course, to mean explosions that usually happen in Russia or in Russia-
 
 occupied territories. And the spokesperson continued saying that cotton has been burning, is burning and will continue burning.
 
So, a very clear indication from the spokesperson of Ukraine security services, that these attacks being carried out by these pro-Ukrainian 
 
 operatives inside Russian territory, they will continue, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: We've been looking for Ukrainian response to some of these recent attacks. And we've been told that they weren't directly involved. I wonder 
 
 whether that's a fair assessment then of what we now understand to be going on. And what does this mean for the wider context of this war?
 
BERTRAND: Well, when we speak to U.S. and Western officials, they actually say privately that they think that this is actually a pretty smart military 
 
 strategy, essentially, with Ukraine doing these kinds of low-grade attacks using these partisans inside Russia. Launching drone strikes in a way that 
 
 has not caused any kind of casualties in terms of deaths, and something that Russia might not be able to respond to in a fulsome way.
 
They think it's kind of a low cost and low risk way of Ukraine -- for Ukraine to distract Russia and divert resources away from the real war and 
 
 battle that is taking place inside Ukraine. So, the U.S. officials and the Western officials that we speak to say, look, Ukraine has the right to do 
 
 this to project force across its borders, and it was always inevitable that they were likely to do this. 
 
However, obviously it does raise questions about whether there was a line that if the Ukrainian partisans do cross, the Russians will retaliate in a 
 
 way that we have not seen before, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Natasha, thank you. Natasha part of the team with that exclusive reporting and inside Ukraine. Russia, well, it's claiming without evidence 
 
 that it is turned back a large scale offensive in the southern Donetsk region. Ukraine says it knows 
 
 nothing about such an operation which we've just heard dissidents meantime, ramping up the pressure inside Russia as the war creeps over that border.
 
The Kremlin claims its troops foiled and attempt by Ukrainian forces to enter the Belgorod region. Fred Pleitgen more from the Ukrainian capital 
 
 for you.
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The Russians came out late on Sunday and claimed that they had thwarted a large-scale 
 
 Ukrainian offensive towards the southern regions of the occupied territories of Ukraine. All this seems to have centered around a town 
 
 called the Velyka Novosilka. Now the Russian said in a statement that they had to destroy a lot of Ukrainian armor that was trying to move on to 
 
 Russian positions.
 
They said they took out 16 tanks, for instance, but a lot of infantry fighting vehicles as well, and infantry also. The Russians are saying that 
 
 that offensive that the Ukrainians launched was thwarted by their forces. The Ukrainians, for their part, have not commented on this matter. And 
 
 they've made pretty clear over the past couple of days, that if that and when that counter offensive that has been in the works for such a very long 
 
 time begins, they are not going to make an announcement that it's actually started.
 
Now, today what happened is that a Russian official in that region, in the Zaporizhzhia region of Ukraine, he claims that there was another attempt by 
 
 the Ukrainians and that they are trying to get all the way to the Sea of Azov. That, of course, would be a very big deal, because that would cut the 
 
 Russian forces off from their land corridor to Crimea. But it certainly seems as though if something is going on, it is still very much in the 
 
 early stages and the Ukrainians aren't commenting on it at this point in time.
 
On the whole, we look at the frontlines here in Ukraine, it certainly seems as though the Russians are on the backfoot right now. We look at places 
 
 like Bakhmut but certainly also if we look at the south and the east of the country as well. And of course, at the same time, you do have that ongoing 
 
 situation and the Russian area around Belgrade.
 
Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Kyiv.
 
ANDERSON: Meantime, do you not expect the airspace over Russia to open up anytime soon, the Director General of the International Air Transport 
 
 Association, IATA says that Russian air space won't open until there is peace in Ukraine. So, airlines will continue having to take longer routes 
 
 between Europe and Asia, tacking on another two or three hours for your flight.
 
India's government has launched an official investigation into the country's deadliest rail crash in more than two decades. At least 275 
 
 people were killed, more than 1000 were injured in Friday's collision. Meantime, the railway said today, normal train traffic has resumed on both 
 
 lines after repair work was completed.
 
CNN's Ivan Watson has the very latest from eastern India.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): The railroad, an army of laborers laying new rail by hand. Racing to reopen 
 
 this transport route after one of the deadliest train disasters India has seen in its modern history.
 
On Friday night, three trains collided in this area and everywhere on the side of the tracks. In this rural part of eastern India. There are massive 
 
 railroad cars that were -- as you can see, severely damaged in this collision. This vehicle here, this car was reserved for people with 
 
 disabilities, you can still see people's personal belongings down below right outside.
 
It began with a passenger train moving at 128 kilometers or 80 miles per hour, slamming into a parked freight train colliding after dark in this 
 
 rural area. Villagers rescued passengers by the light of their cell phones.
 
Did you actually as volunteers pull survivors from the train wagons?
 
DEEPAK BEHERA, RETIRED ARMY TECHNICIAN: Yes, yes. One of the worst hit train wagon where I told the other guys to put the mobile light. I entered 
 
 into it. It was no space literally because it was so inclined that everybody was male, female, everyone was dumped at a place. So, we had to 
 
 pull them very carefully. We pulled them out. Few were alive. We just separated them. Few were dead. So, we don't have to waste the time.
 
WATSON (voiceover): Crowds of volunteers gather outside local hospitals, local reporters interviewing a crash survivor being transferred for 
 
 treatment. Among the crowd here, a worried mother. She's still searching for her missing son who was a passenger on the train. Inside the hospital 
 
 some of the more than 1000 injured in the crash. The road to recovery may not be easy. 
 
This 52-year-old farmer in some much pain, he can't lie down.
 <br>[10:10:06]
 
I'm blessed to have another chance at life says Monto Kumar (ph). The 32- year-old said the collision felt like an earthquake.
 
Afterwards, I took my shirt and wrapped it around my head and started looking for my friends, he says. Kumar says he shared an ambulance with his 
 
 friend who lost both legs and later died. 
 
The Indian government launched an investigation into this disaster and vows to punish anyone responsible. The pressure is on to ensure a catastrophe 
 
 like this never happens again.
 
Ivan Watson, CNN in Odisha state in eastern India.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON: Well, a near collision between U.S. and Chinese military ships is increasing what is an already tense relationship between the two countries. 
 
 This video shows that moment over the weekend when the United States says a Chinese warship acted in a -- and I quote them here, "unsafe manner" and 
 
 violated maritime rules when it cut directly in front of an American vessel in the Taiwan Strait.
 
China's defense minister says the U.S. started the provocation accuses Washington and its allies of trying to destabilize the Indo-Pacific region.
 
Well, CNN's Anna Coren is in Hong Kong. Good to have you with us. How is this latest encounter playing out, Anna?
 
ANNA COREN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Becky, there is real concern that near misses like this one could lead to an accident and then it becomes a 
 
 crisis. This is something the United States says it desperately wants to avoid. On Saturday, the USS Chung-Hoon and Canada's HMCS Montreal, they 
 
 were transiting through the Taiwan Strait as part of a joint military exercise when a Chinese vessel cut in front of the U.S. Destroyer carrying 
 
 out what U.S. officials say was an unsafe maneuver within 137 meters. Super close.
 
The U.S. Destroyer was forced to slow down to avoid a collision as we can see from that video released by the US Navy. Now the China, it says it is 
 
 the U.S.'s fault. Within hours of the incident, China's Defense Minister accused America of provocation and creating chaos in the region. And a few 
 
 hours ago, we heard from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Let's have a listen to that spokesperson.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
WANG WENBIN, CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESPERSON (through translator): The truth is that the United States is provoking trouble first, and China 
 
 is dealing with it in accordance with laws and regulations. The actions taken by the Chinese military are necessary measures to deal with the 
 
 provocations in certain countries, and they are reasonable legal, safe and professional.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COREN: Becky, some analysts believe that this is the first time such a close encounter has occurred during a U.S. Navy transit of the Taiwan 
 
 Strait. Now, the backdrop to this incident was the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore over the weekend, where it was hoped that the U.S. Defense 
 
 Secretary and his Chinese counterpart would meet and reduce those tensions that, you know, exist between the two countries and are only rising.
 
An awkward handshake was as good as it got out of the Chinese rejected private meeting. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had firm words for 
 
 China saying that Washington would not accept coercion and bullying of allies and partners and warned the Chinese military against "unprofessional 
 
 intercepts by its warplanes about the South China Sea." As you remember, you know, just a few weeks ago, there was that close encounter with that 
 
 Chinese jet and that U.S. jet.
 
China's Defense Minister responded by accusing the U.S. without naming it of meddling in other country's internal affairs and building up exclusive 
 
 military alliances in the Asia Pacific. But despite all this rhetoric, and near misses, Becky, the Biden administration remains hopeful that there 
 
 could be a potential Thor in U.S.-China relations and that a meeting between President Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping could happen 
 
 sometime in the near future. Becky?
 
ANDERSON: Anna, always a pleasure. Thank you. Well, Israel has buried three of its soldiers killed in what was a rare attack at the border with Egypt. 
 
 But new questions now beginning to surface about how the incident unfolded.
 
And expert analysis after a bold move by Saudi Arabia considered the most important member of the OPEC+ oil coalition. More on that after this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:17:00]
 
ANDERSON: Three Israeli soldiers killed in a rare attack along the border with Egypt have been laid to rest. Meanwhile, the Israeli Prime Minister 
 
 Benjamin Netanyahu has called for a full investigation into their deaths and despite highly conflicting accounts, both countries say they are 
 
 working together to determine what happens.
 
CNN's Hadas Gold with this report.
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT: Becky, this border that Israel shares with Egypt along the Sinai is normally quiet compared to the other 
 
 borders that Israel has. But what happened Saturday mornings after two soldiers who were manning a rather desolate outpost along this border when 
 
 they didn't respond to a check in that prompted reinforcements to arrive. And that's when the two soldier's bodies were found shot to death. 
 
That triggered a manhunt which then later ended in a gunfight between what turned out to be this Egyptian security officer and Israeli soldiers that 
 
 ended up killing a third Israeli soldier and the Egyptian security officer. Now Israeli officials believed that the security officer crossed the border 
 
 fence using what's actually in emergency pass through that happened to only be held together by plastic zip ties.
 
So, the Egyptian security officer must have cut them in some way in order to enter Israeli territory. And Israeli media says that on his body not 
 
 only was his normal weapon, but also extra magazines. Now, the Egyptian officials say in their official capacity that this security officer was 
 
 chasing after drug smugglers and in the process of chasing after drug smugglers, which is a big problem along this border.
 
He crossed the security, he breached the security barrier and then engaged in a gunfight with the soldiers. But from all official transmissions we're 
 
 getting from both sides. It seems as though there's absolutely no interest in turning this into anything other than an isolated and unusual incident. 
 
 Both the minister of defense and Israel and Minister of Defense in Egypt have already been speaking and both sides say they were cooperating with 
 
 one another on this investigation.
 
And the Israel Defense Forces has said, their spokesperson has said that this incident is not indicative of the working relationship between the two 
 
 military. So, very unusual incidents, still some unanswered questions from the Egyptians on why the security officer if he was chasing after drug 
 
 smugglers, was by himself and crossing this border using an emergency opening and not coordinating with the Israeli military.
 
And for the Israeli military, quite a few failures. Those two soldiers that were found dead, they should have been checked in on once every hour. It 
 
 was several hours until they were checked in on and that their bodies were found. Also how did somebody crossed this border without it triggering some 
 
 sort of alarm? So a lot of answers unanswered questions for both Egyptians and Israelis. Becky?
 
ANDERSON: Hadas Gold reporting for you. Well, Iran has increased its stockpile of enriched uranium by more than a quarter over the past few 
 
 months. That is, according to the director of the nuclear watchdog group, the IAEA. Rafael Grossi, the move comes as Iran continues to breach 
 
 restrictions set out by the 2015 nuclear agreement raising fears of Tehran's ability to make nuclear weapons.
 <br>[10:20:11]
 
Well, meantime, Iran says it is reopening its embassy in the Saudi Arabian capital of Riyadh on Tuesday. This is part of the ongoing effort to resume 
 
 relations between the two countries back in March. Tehran and Riyadh announced they would reestablish diplomatic ties after seven years of 
 
 hostility.
 
Well, Saudi Arabia has done it again. It is pledging to slash oil production by another million barrels a day starting in July. Part of an 
 
 effort they say by OPEC+ producers to shore up flagging crude prices. They are higher on the news, as you can see, and as you know, from watching this 
 
 program. The Saudi Kingdom is the world's top oil exporter. So, it gets a lot of attention not just from the oil industry.
 
It's worth noting, there's plenty of nuance around the Saudi move for one thing, Riyadh's decision was unilateral. We'll discuss this. Let's bring in 
 
 Andrew Critchlow he's head of the Middle East, North Africa for S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights. Thanks for joining us. This is the kingdom going it 
 
 alone, Andrew. What do you make of the Saudis reasoning for this voluntary cut? Concerns about global growth which will weigh on the outlook for fuel 
 
 demand.
 
ANDY CRITCHLOW, HEAD, MIDDLE EAST, NORTH AFRICA FOR S&amp;P GLOBAL COMMODITY INSIGHTS: They need higher oil prices. It's the bottom line. Before this, 
 
 oil was flirting with actually crashing through that $70.00 a barrel threshold. And Saudi Arabia actually needs crude to be trading well north 
 
 of $80.00 a barrel. And that's to fund a lot of the economic development and diversification which is the cornerstone of Crown Prince Mohammed bin 
 
 Salman's policies.
 
And of course, he is the de facto leader of Saudi Arabia, and his father, the king, and he's driving through all these projects to diversify the real 
 
 estate, the investments via its sovereign wealth, and so they need this high oil price. And we were flirting at that low level. And as the major 
 
 producer globally, as you rightly pointed out, this swing producer globally with two million barrels of spare capacity.
 
The onus falls on Saudi Arabia if it can't coax the members of OPEC into a deal to make these cuts, and that's why they've taken this decision.
 
ANDERSON: So, what effect will this production cut have? We've seen the short-term effect.  But frankly, we've seen a spike but it isn't a 
 
 significant spike to speak up.
 
CRITCHLOW: Yes, that's right. I mean, in the grand scheme of things, this is really a drop in the ocean. A million barrels a day for a month, it 
 
 sounds a lot. But in actual fact, it's about 0.3 days of forward cover. And that's why we're seeing a very muted response here in the oil market. More 
 
 importantly, this does come on top of much bigger cuts which OPEC has tried to implement over the last year.
 
And it's really failed to drive these through. And that's because a lot of its producers are actually struggling to meet their quotas in the first 
 
 place. And other producers in the OPEC Alliance like Russia are wanting to maximize their production to their pumping (INAUDIBLE) they can at the 
 
 moment.
 
ANDERSON: Saudi Arabia has blamed speculators for the volatile oil price. And if we've just take a look at the graph that we just had on the screen 
 
 that shows some sort of relatively short term volatility since January of this year. But when you take a longer look, I mean, we have been looking at 
 
 a -- at a pretty volatile price. The Saudi oil minister really, you know, going out of his way to talk about just how irritated he is by those 
 
 speculators. Does he have a genuine grievance?
 
CRITCHLOW: Well, it's what's driven that volatility, you know, that you mentioned. And if you trace it back to last year when we had a near-term 
 
 peak of $137 a barrel, that was driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. These spikes in oil prices, these volatile situations that you see in the 
 
 old market are often called -- caused by geopolitics at the moment. Whether it's was the invasion in Ukraine, its sanctions, or its spate of physical 
 
 attacks on infrastructure and shipping in the Persian Gulf which we've seen.
 
And there's been a persistent theme in the oil market over the last few years. But in actual fact, when you look at the price graph, crude on 
 
 average is down 21 percent over the last year. So, from that basis, the Saudi action is actually warranted. The big question is where does demand 
 
 go from here in the end of the year?
 
CRITCHLOW: Where do you think it goes and what is Russia's influence on the market right now with regard to supply?
 
CRITCHLOW: Well, our projection, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, the demand is to see 2.3 million barrels a day of demand growth to the end of the 
 
 year. 
 <br>[10:25:03]
 
That's driven by China, it's driven by vibrant booming Asian economies. The picture here in Europe and North Africa and North America is much more 
 
 muted and clouded by inflation, clouded by economic headwinds. So, the market is expecting higher prices towards the end of the year really driven 
 
 by demand. You know, more people flying, more consumption through the summer driving season in the U.S.
 
And then we come to the -- to Russia. Russia is actually exporting at record levels now. Despite sanctions, despite price caps, they've actually 
 
 benefited through being able to sell their crude discount into these Asian markets. And that's because the price cuts have been pretty ineffectual. 
 
 And that's partly by design, policymakers didn't want to create a -- an oil shock of the type that we saw in the 1970s when sanctions were imposed on 
 
 Iran and some Middle East producers.
 
They wanted to hamper down on Russia's ability to earn from oil, but all Russia has done is take advantage and export more oil. Some of the research 
 
 that we've conducted has shown that a 225 percent increase in what's known as Dark ship-to-ship transfers. This is when shippers transfer one cargo of 
 
 crude to another vessel and it becomes untraceable. We believe that most of this is down to wishing activity, so wishes getting that crude into the 
 
 market.
 
And it's making it harder for open. Harder for policymakers and harder actually for the market to understand what's actually going on with 
 
 fundamentals.
 
CRITCHLOW: Yes. That's fascinating. Perhaps these days, I mean, you know, let's be quite clear. Speculators can drive the volatility in the oil 
 
 price. But what's happening behind the scenes these days, particularly with regard Russia, as you've just described, really has a, you know, a 
 
 significant influence on what is going on. Good stuff. Thank you very much indeed for joining us. And we have more expert analysis from across the 
 
 region in our newsletter, meanwhile, in the Middle East.
 
That is delivered right to your inbox, including a piece released just today detailing Saudi Arabia's investment strategy if oil prices remain 
 
 sluggish and that includes quotes from a conversation I had with the kingdom's investment minister in Riyadh, just last week. Do go to

Let me say that again. So, you -- it's absolutely clear to you. You can scan the Q.R. code that is on the bottom of your screen, giving you just a 
 
 chance to do that. Let's say keep that up while we let you know what is coming up on the show. As the world prepares to mark the anniversary of the 
 
 massive D-Day invasion of World War II. The top U.S. General talks to CNN about the global impact of Russia's war in Ukraine.

 <br>[10:30:25]
 
ANDERSON: Welcome back. I'm Becky Anderson in Abu Dhabi. You are watching CONNECT THE WORLD. The time here is 6:30 in the evening. Here are your 
 
 headlines this hour. 
 
Ukraine says it knows nothing about a large-scale offensive in the Donetsk region. Russia claims without proof that it has repelled, killed and 
 
 captured several Ukrainian units there. Kyiv says it will not announce the start of what is its long-expected counter offensive.
 
Restoration work is complete, normal rail traffic has now resumed after Friday's deadly train crash in eastern India. Meanwhile, the Indian 
 
 government has launched an official investigation into the cause of the pollution that has left at least 275 people dead and more than 1000 
 
 injured.
 
Oil prices higher after Saudi Arabia said it would make voluntary cuts of a million barrels a day in July. Other members of the OPEC+ group producing 
 
 also agreed to continued cuts. They are trying to shore up flagging prices. The decision came out of Sunday's meeting in Vienna.
 
A shelling combat and airstrikes continue in that ongoing Russian ground war in Ukraine. The world prepares to Mark D-Day. Tuesday is the 79th 
 
 anniversary of the massive World War II invasion. Allied troops landed on the beaches of Normandy, France on June the 6th 1944. And they started 
 
 their push to defeat Nazi Germany.
 
Well, top U.S. General Mark Miley is in Normandy for those events. And CNN's Oren Liebermann talked with the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of 
 
 Staff in almost an exclusive interview. He joins us now. Oren, what did he tell you about the war in Ukraine?
 
OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: Before we get to that, and I'll get to that in just a moment here, Becky, it's worth pointing out that 
 
 the town that we're speaking for -- to you from Normandy was one of the first town's liberated after the D-Day invasion. So certainly, symbolic 
 
 here that we're coming to you live from here as we get ready for the celebrations in the commemorations around June 6 tomorrow.
 
We had a chance this morning to sit down exclusively with General Mark Milley, to top U.S. officer, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. And we 
 
 talked about a number of different topics from Ukraine to chime to some domestic issues with the military. But a lot of the conversation, of 
 
 course, was with Ukraine, as we anticipate this counter offensive. I asked him if Ukraine was ready. Have they been prepared enough?
 
And he said yes, they are as prepared as they can be to carry out this counter offensive. And then I asked him, how do you know it will succeed? 
 
 What are your expectations there? And he was very careful in his wording. Listen to this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GEN. MARK MILLEY, U.S. JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF CHAIRMAN: So, I think it's too early to tell what outcomes are going to happen. I think the Ukrainians are 
 
 very well prepared, as you know very well, the United States and other allied countries in Europe and really around the world have provided 
 
 training and ammunition and advice, intelligence, et cetera. To the Ukrainians, we're supporting them. They're in a war.
 
That's an existential threat for the very survival of Ukraine. And has greater meaning to the rest of the world for Europe, really for the United 
 
 States, but also for the globe.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
LIEBERMANN: General Milley said he knows how difficult that is to predict combat. So he wasn't going to try to make some sort of prediction about how 
 
 the counter offensive would go. Instead, he said the U.S. and the West have provided the equipment for it and are ready when it -- when it begins in 
 
 watching, of course every day as it unfolds. Included in that is a series of attacks within Russia.
 
I asked him, could this lead to escalation? He said look, yes, Russia could respond by escalating. The question is where and those are very different 
 
 scenarios. If they escalate inside Ukraine, that's something that U.S. he says will watch very closely and decide how that affects U.S. policy and 
 
 decision making. If they escalate outside of Ukraine, well, that puts this in an entirely different ballgame, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Oren, in light of the near collision between U.S. and Chinese military ships, which is of course increasing, what is an already tense 
 
 relationship between the two. Does the general worry about an escalation between the U.S. and China at this point?
 
LIEBERMANN: So, General Milley on this question focused on the importance of communication and dialogue between the higher levels of the military. 
 
 And that right now is very much an open question as we see a number of aggressive encounters between the U.S. and the Chinese militaries. It's 
 
 also worth noting that just a couple days ago, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was not able to meet his Chinese counterpart.
 
But on other fronts for example, CIA director Bill Burns was just in China. A high-level state department official there as we speak.
 <br>[10:35:01]
 
So, there are some levels of communication but for Milley, it's important that that increases because it is that discussion, it is that dialogue that 
 
 makes sure that the competition you see, the tension you see stays in the realm of competition and doesn't veer into open conflict with China. What 
 
 he says would be disastrous, just given the fact that two great powers haven't fought each other since World War II. And the reason we're here 
 
 right now.
 
ANDERSON: Yes, fascinating. Thank you, Oren. Prince Harry back in the U.K. to give evidence in what is his phone hacking case. Now, his lawyers 
 
 started laying out their case at the High Court today against the Mirror Group Newspapers. This suit alleges the MGN group obtained private 
 
 information by hacking phones and using other illegal methods. The Duke of Sussex was not in court on day one. Something the judge was not too pleased 
 
 about.
 
Joining us now is CNN's Nada Bashir. Nada, explain if you will.
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN INTERNATIONAL REPORTER: Well, look, Becky, according to Prince Harry's representatives in called left the U.S. late last night. He 
 
 has arrived now in the United Kingdom but was not present for the first day for the opening statements of what is said to be a three-day hearing at the 
 
 High Court behind me. He did spend the day with his daughter and his family was her second birthday.
 
But of course, as you mentioned there, this to the frustration and annoyance of the defense attorneys here at the High Court as well as the 
 
 judge they said that it was extraordinary that Prince Harry was not present for the first day of this hearing. Now he is expected to be present 
 
 tomorrow where he is due to give evidence as part of this three-day hearing. He has been selected amongst four representative claimants.
 
Amongst more than 100 times I've put forward this lawsuit against MGN. They are of course claiming that the mirror group newspapers use illegal, 
 
 unlawful means in order to obtain and solicit personal details, private information throughout between 1991 and 2011. Now Prince Harry himself, his 
 
 legal representatives have submitted 147 stories published between that period which they say demonstrate the use of illegal and unlawful means in 
 
 order to get this information including details around private conversations held between Prince Harry and his brother.
 
Now in just the last hour or so, Prince Harry's defense has gone into quite a bit of detail around stories which featured information regarding his 
 
 relationship with long-term former girlfriend Chelsy Davy information that they say paints a clear picture that unlawful means we use to get this 
 
 private information. We're talking about phone hacking, of course, but also the interception of Prince Harry's voicemails as well as the use of private 
 
 investigators by the mirror group newspapers in order to obtain private information.
 
Now, Mirror Group newspapers have contested these allegations. They say that their senior editors were not aware of any wrongdoing at the time. 
 
 They've also claimed that some of these lawsuits have simply been put forward too late. But of course, of Prince Harry, this is a deeply 
 
 important, deeply personal issue. And he intends to see this through in the courts. Becky?
 
ANDERSON: Buckingham Palace not commenting on this. Thank you.
 
Coming up. Football says goodbye to a legend. The emotional farewell for Zlatan Ibrahimovic. And Karim Benzema closed out his final match for Real 
 
 Madrid, where they bang over the weekend. But where will the French star go next? That is after this.

ANDERSON: If you know anything about football, you know Zlatan Ibrahimovic, the Swedish legend who has been dominating the pitch for an astonishing 24 
 
 years. At the age of 41, he announced his retirement after A.C. Milan Serie A finale win against Hellas Verona on Sunday. I've caught up with Zlatan 
 
 during last year's Globe Soccer Awards here in the UAE and Dubai. And let me tell you, the line is as kind as he is fierce.
 
Here's a clip from that interview that really goes to show why he is one if not the best.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ZLATAN IBRAHIMOVIC, SWEDISH FORMER PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALLER: I don't want to be the guy that plays because of what I've done before. I want to play for 
 
 present time. So, whatever I bring now, and obviously bringing results, then I'll continue to play because I do it for passion. I don't do it 
 
 because different kind of objectives. This is passion for me. And I just want to give back to everybody that is around me on the field and off the 
 
 field.

ANDERSON: Well, the end of an era in Spain's La Liga 2. French striker Karim Benzema ended his 14-year career with Real Madrid in style. Scoring 
 
 and penalty with 18 minutes left on the clock against Athletic Bilbao. That secured a one-one draw and second place for the team in La Liga. And what a 
 
 run he has had at Real Madrid.
 
Coy Wire is with us from Atlanta. Benzema's run at Real Madrid, it may be over, Coy. But we've definitely not seen the last of him. Where do we 
 
 expect to see him pop up next as it Were?
 
COY WIRE, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR: Yes, Benzema. Look into the future. Becky, good to see you. It's being reported that the 35-year-old is heading to 
 
 Saudi Arabia, potentially in negotiations with Al-Etihad. One of the greatest strikers of all time. The reigning Ballon d'Or winner. So, we'll 
 
 see if we'll be able to see more of Karim Benzema. And next time you are with Zlatan Ibrahimovic, could you please ask him how he gets such a good 
 
 head of hair on him?
 
ANDERSON: I will do. I'll say that questions from you, sir. World Sport coming up but after this short break, looking forward to it, Coy. I'm back 
 
 top of the hour for you folks. Stay with us.
