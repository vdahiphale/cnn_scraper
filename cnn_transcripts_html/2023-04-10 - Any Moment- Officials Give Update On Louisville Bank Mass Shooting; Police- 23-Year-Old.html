THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[15:00:30]
 
FREDRICKA WHITFIELD, CNN HOST: All right. It's the top of the hour in the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Fredricka Whitfield in New York and we are moments away from an update on today's deadly mass shooting in Louisville, Kentucky.
 
A gunmen opening fire at a downtown bank, killing at least four people and wounding nine others. Police responded quickly getting into a gunfight with the shooter, two officers were injured in the exchange with one now in critical condition. The shooter is dead and police are still trying to piece together how he was killed and why the former bank employee may have gone on this shooting spree. Officials are expecting to hold a briefing at any moment. Of course, we'll take that to you.
 
But before it begins, let's go first to CNN's Shimon Prokupecz Sherman Procopius. So Shimon, what do we know about how all of this unfolded?
 
SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN CRIME &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER: Right. So sometimes it's around 8:30 this morning or after 8:30, before the bank was open, the shooting took place. Police saying that they were there within three minutes. Just think about that. The fact that they got there so quickly and yet still not enough to save those four lives.
 
And they encountered gunfire almost immediately. They exchanged gunfire with the shooter and then they at some point went in. It's unclear if they killed him or if he killed himself.
 
They also say that some of the employees were hiding in the vault. It sounds like there were actually a lot of people already inside the bank. A lot of the employees were at work already. But obviously, the big thing here is what is this person's connection to the bank.
 
WHITFIELD: Yes.
 
PROKUPECZ: We've heard the police say that this was either a former employee or a current employee. So hopefully, in this press conference, which hopefully is minutes away, we'll learn more about the connection. Also the weapon here used. We've learned that it was an AR-15-style rifle, something we've heard about so often in all of these shootings. It's a gun that, sadly, has been used in many of the mass shootings that we've covered.
 
So perhaps we'll learn more about that. But obviously, there just are a lot of questions still remaining about this person, about the weapon and what else we can learn about the victims. We saw the governor in that press conference get emotional saying these are his friends - friends of his that were injured and killed inside his bank.
 
So this is really hitting this community pretty roughly as one can only imagine. But hopefully we get to hear or learn some new information that could shed some light on the motives there.
 
WHITFIELD: Yes, the Governor is saying two out of the four people killed he knew.
 
PROKUPECZ: Yes.
 
WHITFIELD: And still perplexing is this - he had an association - the governor had an association with the bank, former employee, current, did he gain access because of that familiarity; everyone saw him, let him in; did he make his way in by knowing some vulnerabilities of the bank given that he had some kind of familiarity, so lots of questions.
 
PROKUPECZ: Yes.
 
WHITFIELD: Hopefully, we'll get some of them at that press conference momentarily.
 
All right. Thanks so much, Shimon. Appreciate it.
 
Joining us right now, CNN Senior Law Enforcement Analyst and former FBI Director, Andrew McCabe and CNN Senior Law Enforcement Analyst and former Philadelphia and Washington Metro Police Commissioner, Charles Ramsey, good to see all of you.
 
So Andrew, you first. We're waiting on this briefing to Begin. What are the questions that you are hoping will get answered at this stage? So very early on, the gunman is dead, but what are the expectations that you have?
 
ANDREW MCCABE, CNN SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST: Well, there's so much more that we'd like to know about the gunman to try to get out that central question that everybody has, which is: why did this happen, why at this bank, why today, what might have provoked this, what brought this individual to this moment of inflicting violence on people who were, it sounds like, probably his former or current colleagues.
 
Law enforcement obviously knows a lot about him already. They - we understand they were able to identify him pretty early on in the investigation. They have no doubt taken a look at as much information as they can find about him in terms of his social media presence.
 
They are likely working on search warrants for his residence or for any vehicles that may be - that may come back to him. They're going to be looking for things that he may have written, things that he may have communicated to friends and family or his co-workers there at the bank to try to shed some light on this issue of motive.
 
And so it'll be interesting to hear if they shared any of that with us at the press conference that's coming up. I think that's kind of first on my list.
 <br>[15:05:06]
 
WHITFIELD: Mm-hm. And Commissioner Ramsey, if this gunman was a familiar face to these bankers, he may have also known about the vulnerabilities of the bank, video cameras, obviously, will reveal a lot. But so will eyewitnesses in and around the bank, what people heard or saw even before the gunman got there, right?
 
CHARLES RAMSEY, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST: Yeah, you're right. I mean, that's going to be important to find out how he gained access, is he a current employee, is he a former employee, did he just follow somebody inside. I mean, we don't know that and hopefully we'll get more information at this press conference.
 
One of the things, though, I think that'll be covered, as well as the rapid response of the Louisville Metropolitan Police to the scene, three minutes is incredible response time. I heard Andrew actually mentioned this earlier and he's absolutely right. People need to also consider the fact that it takes time between the initial call from 911 dispatcher getting the information and dispatching to the police. In the best of circumstances, you're talking about adding another minute to that.
 
It's unavoidable, but it's going to happen and someone with an AR-15 or any kind of assault weapon, a lot of damage can be done in a very short period of time, so this is really tragic in many ways.
 
WHITFIELD: It is indeed, I mean, and obviously, Andrew, people could have heard what was happening. I mean, that helped elicit the calls to police. But even when police were to get there, perhaps they already had some kind of inkling about what kind of firearm may have been used just simply by the sound of it and how equipped are they to respond to something like this, Andrew.
 
MCCABE: Well, there's no doubt that as a law enforcement officer, especially if you've trained around these weapons, if you have an AR- 15-style rifle, which many patrol officers have issued to them now, they carry them in their vehicles, you fired that weapon, you know exactly what it sounds like. And you can just - you don't have to be an expert firearms person to distinguish the sound of an AR-15 from, let's say, the sound of a handgun report.
 
So when police officers arrived on that scene, they hear shots being fired what is likely a high powered rifle. They are going to arm themselves with the best, the strongest and the most lethal weapons they have in their vehicle. And we haven't heard these details about this level of specifics about the response, but it's my strong suspicion that some - at least some of those officers who responded likely had long guns rifles that they brought to the response, which is absolutely necessary in this day and age, when every day as an officer on patrol and you get in your car, start your shift, you run a pretty, pretty scary likelihood of coming across an individual who might be armed with that kind of lethality, whether it's a mass shooting or just this straight up criminal gun violence issue on the streets.
 
The fact is, in this arms race that we currently have in this country where perpetrators are more and more often armed with military-style weapons, we have to have an equivalent response, we have to arm our police officers with the sort of weapons that will enable them to handle someone who is armed and potentially protected in that way.
 
WHITFIELD: And Chief, this is still an active crime scene, the investigation is still in its infancy. So talk to me about how widespread the crime scene is including the residents, perhaps, of where this gunman originated.
 
RAMSEY: Well, yes, I mean, obviously, you have the bank, this site where the incident actually took place, vehicle or the mode of transportation the individual took to get there, any apartment, home or any place where that person resides is also now a crime scene. I'm sure warrants are being executed, they're trying to get - they'll take computers, they'll take any other kind of items from the home that can give them some indication as to why, as more about this individual so that they can try to determine a motive.
 
They're also in the process of interviewing people that know him, whether it's family, friends, co-workers, whatever it may be. So you've got a lot of things going on right now that are taking place and it'll continue for a period of time, but we'll find out more. I see the ...
 
WHITFIELD: Okay. I'm going to stop you there. Let's go to this press conference in Louisville, Kentucky.
 
JACQUELYN GWINN-VILLAROEL, INTERIM CHIEF, LOUISVILLE METRO POLICE: (Inaudible) within our city. At 8:38, there's a report of shots fired at Old National Bank.
 <br>[15:10:05]
 
Officers were on scene within three minutes. The suspect shot at officers. We then return fire and stop that threat. The suspect is deceased. This is the only time that I will mention the suspect name in this case. The suspect has been identified as Connor Sturgeon. White male, 23 years of age, who was employed at Old National Bank.
 
His weapon of choice was a rifle. We have five total deceased which includes him, but I want to acknowledge with heartfelt condolences, prayers to the family or those who lost their life today: Tommy Elliott, 63 years of age; Jim Tutt, 64 years of age; Joshua Barrick, 40 years of age; and Juliana Farmer, 57.
 
We have a total of nine victims who were treated and are being treated at a Louisville. Three, which are in critical condition, including our officer; three who are listed in noncredit critical condition, and three who have been treated and released. The two officer who was struck in exchange of gunfire, one of the officers, he was grazed to the left side and the other officer suffered minor injuries to the elbow. I just want to let everyone know that the officer who was in critical condition today, Officer Nickolas Wilt, 26 years of age, just graduated from the police academy on March 31st. I just swore him in and his family was there to witness his journey to become a police officer.
 
He was struck in the head, engaged in this incident, Nick has come out of brain surgery and is in critical but stable condition as we speak. I've been down there with the family and given my love and support, been with all the families today to show our love and support for them. And if anything else that they need from LMPD, we will provide that.
 
The next few days are important and very critical for Nickolas's recovery. This will be a long complex investigation involving local, state and our federal partners. I'd be remiss if I did not acknowledge our federal partners who have just been just outstanding, our local partners, ATF, FBI, I thank you. Our local partners, University Louisville Police, EMS, emergency management services, thank you. Thank you for everything.
 
And for my LMPD officers who took it upon themselves and not wait to assess everything but just went in to stop the threat so that more lives would not be lost, thank you. Thank you for showing up even when sometimes you are just felt like you're not appreciated. But I asked my officers when I addressed them today, if we don't do it, who will. And so they're very committed and their resiliency show today and their professionalism show today.
 
I want to thank the Governor. I want to thank the Mayor who has been with us every step of the way through this trying and critical time. But I want to encourage the public, if you have any additional information, please call 574-LMPD and assist us. This should not continue to happen. Evil should not try to prevail and take over our city and we let it happen. So I'm encouraging everybody that we united, and then we continue to do the good work, and LMPD will continue to keep this community and this city safe.
 
MAYOR CRAIG GREENBERG, (D) LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY: Thank you very much, Chief. Today is a day that's heartbreaking for our city, for all of us and especially for the people who were in that office at Old National Bank and their loved ones.
 
We just heard the chief give the names of the people who lost their lives in this mass shooting this morning.
 <br>[15:15:02]
 
One of them was Tommy Elliott, a very good friend of mine, of the Governor's. To Tommy's family, to the families of Jim Tutt, Josh Barrick, Juliana Farmer, Rachel and I join you and families across our entire city and beyond in grieving this shocking and painful loss of your lives. The chief, the governor, myself, we visited in the hospital this morning with several of their families to offer them our support, and our love. During these unthinkable day, we will continue to offer our support and love anything else we can provide to help them.
 
We were also there along with several of my colleagues from Metro council to thank and support the officers of LMPD for their heroic work today and every day and say thank you to the new graduating class, who was there to support their colleague, Officer Wilt, as he continues to fight for his life.
 
Let's be clear about what this was. This was an evil act of targeted violence and to add to that tragedy, a few blocks away, shortly after this happened, another man lost his life and a woman was shot in a completely different act of targeted violence. The two incidents appear to be entirely unrelated. But they both took lives. They both leave people scarred, grieving and angry.
 
I share all of those feelings myself right now. This was really difficult for all of us, across the entire city, to process and accept. I asked that we respect the needs of the families and loved ones of the people whose lives were lost today and the people whose lives will never be the same.
 
I'm a survivor of a workplace shooting. To the people who survived, whether you were physically hurt or not, I know that you're hurting too. We are here for you as well. To the survivors and the families, our entire city is here to wrap our arms around you.
 
We've set up a Family Assistance Center through the Red Cross to provide support and services to those families today and in the coming days, weeks and months ahead that we know will be challenging. To provide you with whatever you need to deal with the trauma of this moment, the same applies to our police officers and first responders, our city is here for everyone impacted. We are a strong city and we will be here for support.
 
As the chief mentioned, our LMPD officers went into that building, knowing that they were risking their lives to save their lives, to save other lives and that's exactly what they did. They exchanged gunfire with the shooter. To Officer Wilt and his family, we will continue to pray and support you. To the other two LMPD officers who were injured, thank you and all of your colleagues for your service today and every day.
 
I also want to thank all of our other first responders: fire, EMS, Jefferson County Sheriff, state and federal agencies that are helping us at this time. And to Dr. Smith, to you and all of the other doctors and nurses and team at UofL Health for your work today and every day, you too are saving lives in our city and we thank you.
 
For the rest of us in our city, let's hold each other close and provide comfort where we can. That's what we've done in the past and that's what we must continue to do now. We've already received offers of assistance from people across the city and country. Thank you.
 
By the end of the day, we'll be providing specific information on how to provide donations to those impacted today if you would like.
 <br>[15:20:04]
 
We will also have more information by the end of the day about a community-wide vigil for the targeted acts of violence that happened today and any day in our city. We will continue to move forward with strength, prayer with love, support and determination. Thank you, all.
 
I'm now going to turn it over to Gov. Andy Beshear. Governor?
 
GOV. ANDY BESHEAR (D) KENTUCKY:    Today is a tragic day in Louisville and for the entire Commonwealth of Kentucky. Acts of violence like this hurt. They tear at the fabric of who we are at our society at our state, at our country, and the city.
 
Today, I'm hurt and I'm hurting. And I know so many people out there are as well. We lost four children of God today. One of whom was one of my closest friends. Tommy Elliott helped me build my law career, helped me become governor, gave me advice on being a good dad. He's one of the people I talked to most in the world and very rarely were we talking about my job. He was an incredible friend.
 
We also lost Juliana Farmer, Jim Tutt, Josh Barrick, each amazing people whose families grieve them, whose community will mourn and will miss them. These are irreplaceable, amazing individuals that a terrible act of violence tore from all of us.
 
We also pray for our LMPD officer and two others that, right now, while perhaps stable are still fighting for their lives with a need for our care and, yes, for our prayers, because I believe - I believe and I believe that prayers lift all of us up and those families would appreciate them.
 
And while I hurt today and while I will grieve when I'm able, I'm also grateful. I'm grateful for an incredibly quick response from LMPD, the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office, Louisville Fire and Rescue, Louisville Metro EMS getting to the scene in three minutes, I'm convinced saved other people's lives and I know saved two other of my friends.
 
One I received incorrect information this morning I thought was gone and I'd started to mourn. And now I know he's okay. And when I got to see in the ER, that while it's going to take him a while to heal, it was so good to see my friend, see him there with his wife and know he is still with us.
 
I want to thank KSP, ATF, FBI, every single law enforcement agency that is going to bring their entire weight and their entire resources to bear so that we know exactly what happened in this situation. And there are more first responders than the ones we've listed. Because the team at U of L hospital are first responders too.
 
The first battle was stopping that gunman. The second is doing everything we can to keep those that have been wounded alive and I want to say to good this doctor behind me and we have worked together through pandemics and now this, but I'm really proud of what his team is doing.
 
I was in a room where one of those families that are rightfully worried, got an update. And it was one that was specific but also provided with compassion. These doctors and nurses are fighting for the lives of our friends, of our family and we are deeply grateful to them.
 
I think what we need most right now in a word is love. I mean just love. Love for these families. They are going to need it. I can tell you. I've talked to them. I'm very close with one of them. They are going to need that love and we need love for each other. It seems like we argued so much in this country, so much anger. I still believe that love and compassion and humanity can lead us to a better place.
 
Now, this is hard, it's really hard the day after Easter. Now Easter is about a rebirth, a better world, one where we're all supposed to work together to get there. One that's supposed to teach us love from a savior that came.
 <br>[15:25:02]
 
We fell in love with Him not because of His power, but for His compassion. And I believe what we can do, whether it's any faith or just your values is ensure that today more than anything is about these families. It's about those families that are afraid they're going to lose their loved one, about those that have been through the worst and while may have survived are going to bear the scars inside and outside today. It's got to be about them and the heroic actions of everybody who responded.
 
And yes, I know, in the days to come, we'll talk about issues. But I think the thing that people get wrong after the most difficult of times and days and as governor, I've had to see a lot of them is it today I ought to be focused on my friend, and on everybody else's friends and loved ones, that are no longer with us.
 
My faith teaches me that while the body is mortal, the soul is eternal, so I know that I will see Tommy again and I know that all of these families and friends in this community, we will be reunited in a better place without violence, without the senselessness and hurt that we feel today. We will get through this. We'll get through this together. It's the only way and we'll march forward and my hope is that in honor of those that have fallen today or that may still fall, we can be better and we can do better and care about love each other just a little bit more.
 
Today to honor those that have fallen and asked so many families grieve, I'm ordering our flags, statewide, fly at half-staff until Friday - Friday evening, to make sure that we are paying tribute in every single part of this Commonwealth to those that we have lost.
 
We are one Commonwealth, united with the city, united with these families. What we've had to do a lot in these last three years is wrap our arms around each other and we need to do it here. Thank you. I'll - and next, we're going to hear from Dr. Smith, who is leading an incredible team to try to make sure as many of those that were harmed in this incident get through it.
 
And let me just again say that he and his hospital have my full support and confidence. I've seen it firsthand. What they're doing is nothing short of amazing. And listen, I know they're going to do their best. And while we don't know what that outcome can be, we ought to be appreciative them for doing their very best.
 
DR. JASON SMITH, CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER, UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE HEALTH:        Well, thank you very much for that. As was reported, this morning, University of Louisville hospital received nine patients, three of which are currently in critical condition. The three that are in critical condition did require operative care and - from our trauma team and our emergency department services. We were able to release three and three are currently still in our hospital with non life threatening injuries.
 
I want to say thank you to Louisville as a city. I want to say thank you to our police officers and our EMS services. I have no doubt in my mind that they saved lives today. I think they, as many in the healthcare industry, have been through a difficult time recently, but they have stood up and stand up for Louisville and the people of Louisville constantly and they have our thanks from UofL Health.
 
I also want to thank my nurses and the emergency department, my physicians and the emergency department. Through all of this they remained as the professionals that they are. They were able to care for a large number of people coming in severely injured in a very short period of time. We were able to get them to the services they need.
 
And as of now, no one that arrived at the hospital has expired. Now, I do not know what the days ahead will be. I do know that they are still injured. But I also know that we are all Louisvillians and it doesn't matter where we come from. It does not matter who we look like, we are all part of Louisville: LMPD, EMS, UofL Health, we are here for everyone.
 
And so I would like to thank everyone who's helped us today. I would like to thank all the well wishes I have received both personally and from our healthcare system from around the country. Support for people who have been through this around the country and know the pain that my team is currently facing, know the pain that the LMPD and EMS teams are currently facing and will be with us because as, again, we are all Louisvillians.
