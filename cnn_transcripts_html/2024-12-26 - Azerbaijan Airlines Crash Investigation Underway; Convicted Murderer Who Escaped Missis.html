ANNOUNCER: Live from London, this is CNN NEWSROOM with Max Foster and Christina Macfarlane.
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR: Hello and a warm welcome to our viewers joining us from around the world. I'm Max Foster. It is Thursday, December the 26th, 9 a.m. here in London, 2 p.m. in western Kazakhstan, where investigators are looking for clues into what could have caused the crash of an Azerbaijan Airlines flight killing at least 38 people. 
 
Russia's aviation watchdog reports the pilot tried to make an emergency landing after a bird strike. Azerbaijan state news says the plane's black box has been recovered. The flight was headed from Baku to the Russian city of Grozny in Chechnya. Twenty nine people survived the crash. All were taken to hospital.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FARID HUSEYNOV, HEAD OF PRESS SERVICE, AZERBAIJAN AIRLINES (through translator): A medical team and necessary medical equipment have been sent to Kazakhstan by air. A hotline has been established for the family members of the passengers on board and the public has been informed about it. Psychological support will be provided to the family members of all passengers, regardless of nationality, as well as to the injured passengers.
 
KENAN ZEYNALOV, SENIOR PROSECUTOR OF PRESS SERVICE, PROSECUTOR GENERAL'S OFFICE (through translator): Currently, the investigation process is ongoing in cooperation with the prosecutor's office of Kazakhstan. All versions are being explored in the criminal case. At this moment, we cannot provide any conclusions regarding the investigation.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
FOSTER: Well, video from on board the plane shows oxygen masks deployed as the plane circled the airfield in western Kazakhstan. Nada's been watching this because, I mean, everyone's so intrigued by what might have happened. We can talk about that in a second in terms of the investigation, but also the fact that people managed to survive.
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, absolutely. It is remarkable to see that dramatic footage of the of the plane crashing into the ground, bursting into flames as it did crash into the ground. It is remarkable that there were survivors.
 
We've seen that dramatic footage of rescue workers immediately at the scene and eyewitnesses as injured passengers were essentially being pulled out of the wreckage of the sort of back half of the plane, the tail end of the plane. And now, according to officials, at least we know that 29 people survived, including two children. They've all been taken to hospital, of course, for immediate medical attention.
 
At least 11 people are said to be in a critical condition. So we will be waiting for updates from officials on their status. But, of course, dozens were killed, at least 38 confirmed dead by officials.
 
And there have been questions around the sort of what led to this crash. We've seen that video of the plane essentially circling the airfield ahead of what appears to have been an attempt to make that emergency landing just about two miles from the Kazakh city of Aktau. 
 
And, of course, we have also heard from the Russian aviation authorities saying they believe preliminary information suggests this was caused by a bird strike. But we know that investigations are still ongoing.
 
FOSTER: Yes, I mean, the people are making a lot of, you know, the damage to the aircraft and how that could have been caused by a bird strike. So people are desperate to know.
 
BASHIR: Absolutely. And we've heard from officials, the Kazakh government has said that it has set up a commission now to carry out an immediate investigation into the cause of the crash. There have been some questions around the flight path taken by the plane on its route.
 
There have also been questions around drone activity in the area as well. We know that drone activity has shut down airports in the past in this region. This crash essentially came shortly after a drone strike hit southern Russia.
 
And there have been some questions around whether or not that may have played a part in leading to this crash. Of course, these are all still very much questions. We don't have the firm answers yet from that black box.
 <br>[04:05:00]
 
Information will be crucial to this investigation, of course, and we'll be keeping an eye on what happens.
 
FOSTER: Who would lead the investigation in this situation?
 
BASHIR: At this stage, the Kazakh government has set up a commission. We know that the airliner is also sending in a team into the country to support in that investigation. But, of course, then it becomes a question of whether this turns into perhaps a criminal case or whether this is an aviation fault that they're looking at. So lots of questions still up in the air on that front.
 
FOSTER: OK, Nada, thank you so much. 
 
And just in to CNN, at least 14 law enforcement personnel were killed in western Syria overnight in what's been called an ambush by former forces of deposed leader Bashar al-Assad. That's according to the country's new interior ministry.
 
It happened hours after the current military said its forces had killed a number of former Assad fighters in the same area. The new government has set a deadline for former regime forces and gangs to disarm less than three weeks after rebels advanced on Damascus and forced Assad to flee the country. 
 
Hospital officials in Gaza say five journalists were killed in an Israeli military operation overnight. The journalists were sleeping in a vehicle parked outside the Al-Ada Hospital in northern Gaza when the vehicle was hit by an Israeli strike. The vehicle belonged to a Gaza- based television channel affiliated with the Palestine Islamic Jihad militant group. Footage shows the vehicle in flames, with the words TV and press visible on the back doors.
 
The Israeli military confirmed it carried out a strike on what it called an Islamic Jihad terror cell in the area, but didn't provide any proof for their allegation. 
 
On Wednesday, Hamas and Israel traded blame for the failure to reach a ceasefire on hostage release deal. Israel's defense minister insists there will be no deal without a secure Gaza.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ISRAEL KATZ, ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER (through translator): We will ensure here in Gaza, as with Lebanon, as with Syria and in the east, that no more threats will be created against Israeli communities, citizens of the state of Israel and IDF soldiers. In Gaza, too, we will ensure that there are security spaces, buffer zones and command posts that will ensure the security of the communities. And with all this, we will act to achieve the two goals of the war, to release all the kidnapped people home and to defeat Hamas.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: The families of the hostages in Gaza are marking the second Hanukkah without their loved ones. Thousands of people attended a protest on the holiday's first night, demanding the Israeli government strike a deal to release the remaining 100 captives. The mother of hostage, Liri Albag, lit the first Hanukkah candle and led prayers for the hostages' immediate return.
 
Afghanistan's Taliban government is threatening retaliation after a wave of Pakistani airstrikes in that country. The Taliban says at least 46 people were killed and six others injured when Pakistani warplanes hit four locations near the border on Tuesday. Pakistan isn't commenting on the strikes, but one official says the target was the Pakistani Taliban, which aims to impose Islamic law in Pakistan. It says the militant group has been staging cross-border attacks from Afghanistan, which the Afghan Taliban denies. 
 
Authorities in Hawaii investigating after a body was found in the wheel well of a United Airlines plane. It had flown from Chicago to Maui on Christmas Eve, and the body was discovered after the plane landed.
 
The airline says the wheel well is only accessible from outside the plane, and it's not clear how or when the person got in there. It's also unclear how they ultimately died, though both temperatures and oxygen levels plummet during the flight. While unusual, this is still a common method for stowaways trying to reach a destination.
 
U.S. aviation authorities say more than three quarters of people who've tried to hitch an illegal ride on an airplane have died. 
 
Now, in the U.S. state of Mississippi, the manhunt is over for a convicted murderer who broke out of prison on Christmas Eve. The 33- year-old convict has a lengthy history of violence both in and outside of jail.
 
CNN's Nick Valencia has the details.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NICK VALENCIA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Less than 24 hours after going on the run, Drew Johnson was taken into custody. And according to the Mississippi Department of Corrections, he did not get very far, found very near the South Mississippi Correctional Institution, where he had escaped from on Tuesday afternoon. Now, that's Mississippi's newest prison facility, so it's not entirely
 
 clear how Johnson was able to maneuver out of it. But given his violent past, prison officials were very concerned and very eager to get him back into custody. It was in 2016 that Johnson was convicted of murdering a friend. That friend's body found buried in a field with more than two dozen stab wounds.
 
Once he was taken into custody, the Shelby County District Attorney's Office said that Johnson attempted to murder an inmate, later pleading guilty to attempted first-degree murder. And his violent streak did not end there. The Shelby County District Attorney's Office said he tried to burn the jail down twice.
 <br>[04:10:00] 
 
Now, prison officials in Mississippi were pleading to stay vigilant around the Christmas holiday, a time, they say, that people tend to let their guard down and be a little bit more generous. Thankfully, a Christmas gift for the region and a big sigh of relief for the Mississippi Department of Corrections.

FOSTER: Still to come, Ukraine is reeling from Christmas Day attacks on its energy sector, which has drawn strong condemnation from the U.S. president. 
 
Plus, prayers for peace in Ukraine and beyond as Pope Francis delivers his Christmas Day message. 
 
You're watching CNN NEWSROOM.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: U.S. President Joe Biden has condemned a massive wave of Christmas Day strikes on Ukraine. He said the purpose of Russia's outrageous attack was to cut off Ukrainian people's access to heat and electricity during winter. He added the Ukrainian people deserve to live in peace and safety. And that he directed his defense department to continue its surge of arms deliveries to Kyiv. 
 
Ukraine says at least one person was killed and six wounded in Russia's assault on its power grid. Hundreds of thousands of homes were left without electricity which led to emergency blackouts in several regions.
 
Right now temperatures are hovering around freezing in some parts of the affected cities including Kyiv and Kharkiv. Ukraine's president is welcoming in the Hanukkah holiday with a renewed call for peace. Volodymyr Zelenskyy took part in a candle lighting ceremony with leaders of Ukraine's Jewish community.
 
The chief rabbi of the Dnipro region gave a blessing and said the Hanukkah candles remind Ukraine that light will prevail over darkness and evil will soon be defeated. 
 
Music filled St. Peter's Square before Pope Francis delivered his annual Christmas Day message. The 88-year-old pontiff called for peace in the Middle East describing the humanitarian situation in Gaza as extremely grave.
 
Pope Francis also called for weapons to be laid down in Ukraine again pushing for a peace deal. All this comes as the Catholic Church begins its jubilee year as CNN's Christopher Lamb reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHRISTOPHER LAMB, CNN VATICAN CORRESPONDENT: Pope Francis emphasizing that the Christmas message is one of peace and reconciliation. Calling on countries to lay down their arms and for enemies to be reconciled. Francis making specific reference to the war in Ukraine and in Gaza.
 
This is what he had to say.
 
POPE FRANCIS (through translator): May there be the boldness needed to open the door to negotiation and to gestures of dialogue and encounter in order to achieve a just and lasting peace. May the sound of arms be silenced in the Middle East.
 
LAMB: The Pope's remarks in Ukraine coming after Russia's attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure on Christmas Day. The Pope has repeatedly called for a negotiated peace settlement to end Russia's war against Ukraine. He's also been outspoken recently on what's been going on in Gaza calling recent airstrikes cruelty and also being in regular contact with the Catholic community in Gaza.
 <br>[04:15:03]
 
Now Pope Francis making his remarks after launching the Catholic Church's jubilee year. An ancient tradition that focuses on forgiveness and pilgrimage in which began on Christmas Eve when Pope Francis opened the doors of the Holy Door of St. Peter's Basilica. Normally cemented shut the door meant to represent God's mercy.
 
The Pope said and that Francis is hoping that the message of the jubilee can be one of hope and one that can impact not just in Rome but globally. Now Francis is 88 years old. He's got a packed schedule of events during the jubilee. He'll be opening a holy door in a prison tomorrow, Thursday, the first time the Holy Door has been opened in a prison. 
 
Nevertheless despite the difficulties the Pope has when it comes to his physical mobility. Francis determined to carry out the celebrations of the jubilee and hoping that the message that the jubilee represents will resonate across the globe.

TAPPER: I will. I will aspire to be brat.
 
WAGMEISTER (voice-over): Number six. Alec Baldwin's courtroom shocker.

WAGMEISTER (voice-over): A judge dismissed the case against the actor accused of involuntary manslaughter when the gun he was holding on the "Rust" movie set fired, killing cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and wounding the film's director. The judge's decision came less than a week into the trial, citing the prosecution's improper handling of new evidence in the case.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Bobby!

WAGMEISTER: Three people have pleaded guilty. One of the doctors is awaiting trial, along with an alleged dealer prosecutors say is known as the Ketamine Queen. 
 
WAGMEISTER (voice-over): The Perry family relieved that charges were filed nearly a year after the beloved actor died in the hot tub at his Los Angeles home.
