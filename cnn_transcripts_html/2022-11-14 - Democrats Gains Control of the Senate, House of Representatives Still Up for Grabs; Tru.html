(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN HOST:  Hello and welcome to all our viewers here in the United States and all around the world. And live from Studio 7 at CNN Center in Atlanta, I'm Rosemary Church.
 
Well, it has been nearly a week, but election night in America goes on with control of the House of Representatives still up for grabs. However, Republicans are closing in. They picked up another seat Sunday night. They've won 212 compared to Democrats' 204. And they're close to the 218 seats needed for a majority with 19 races still to be called. Current House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, wouldn't speculate on whether she would seek another term as leader, take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA):  My decision will again be rooted in the wishes of my family and the wishes of my caucus. But none of it will be very much considered until we see what the outcome of all of this is.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
CHURCH:  Well, meantime, Democrats are taking a victory lap after keeping control of the Senate thanks to Catherine Cortez Masto's victory in Nevada. And depending on the results of Georgia's runoff next month, they might even expand on that. 
 
Senator Lindsey Graham tweeted that the Republican's upcoming Senate leadership contest should be delayed because of that runoff. And other top Republicans are voicing their own concerns about the future direction of the party. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEN. RICK SCOTT (R-FL):  What is our plan? What are we running on? What do we stand for? What are we hell bent to get done? You know, there is no plan to do that. The leadership in the Republican Senate says, no, you cannot have a plan. We are just going to run, it gets how bad the Democrats are and actually then they cave into the Democrats. SEN. BILL CASSIDY (R-LA):  Going forward, Mitch will be our leader.
 
 But that is not to say that we're not going to have a necessary debate about ideas. And I think it's very, again, one more time, important for us to explain to the American voter why Republicans have a better vision for the future of our country.

CHURCH:  Another critical race we're watching is in Arizona. While the state's Senate race has been called for Democrat Mark Kelly, it's still too early to call the governor's race. Right now, Democrat Katie Hobbs has a slight lead over Trump supported Kari Lake. But the counting is not yet done. Kyung Lah is in Arizona with the latest. 
 
KYUNG LAH, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Maricopa County out with their latest report. There are about 85,000 to 95,000 remaining ballots to be counted in the most populous county in the state of Arizona, in the hotly contested governor's race here in the state. Democrat, Katie Hobbs, maintains a very slim lead over Republican Kari Lake. 
 
Now, this is a hotly contested race, with accusations from Republican, Lake, saying that there's something going wrong with the count taking place here in this county. Election officials in Maricopa have pushed back strongly, saying, if anything, they are moving at a faster rate than they have in other elections. 
 
What is so important about the information that we got, this latest election report from the county, is that the Lake campaign used this batch of votes as her path. It is a path that continues to narrow, especially with this latest report. 
 
In addition to the 85,000 to 95,000 remaining ballots that need to be counted, there is also about 8,300 ballots that are still having to be cured. So, while the rhetoric continues, the count here in this county continues. Kyung Lah, CNN, Phoenix.  
 
CHURCH:  And Republican Doug Mastriano has finally conceded in the Pennsylvania governor's race. CNN called the contest for Democrat Josh Shapiro Tuesday night. With nearly all the votes counted, Shapiro beat Mastriano with as solid 14-point lead. 
 
However, Mastriano who was a leading proponent of falsehoods about the 2020 election refused to admit defeat for days. But on Sunday, he changed course and accepted his loss. 
 <br>[02:04:58]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DOUG MASTRIANO, REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR PENNSYLVANIA GOVERNNOR:  As difficult as it was to accept the results, there is no other course but to concede, which I do and I look to the challenges ahead. Josh Shapiro will be our next governor and I ask everyone to give him the opportunity and to pray that he makes decisions that are beneficial for the state and not necessarily for his party and that he leads well because it affects all of our lives. (END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
CHURCH:  I'm joined now by CNN political commentator and Republican strategist Alice Stewart in Alexandria, Virginia. And Mark Kelly, better known as Mo Kelly. He is a political commentator and the host of the Los Angeles radio program "The Mo Kelly Show." Welcome to you both. 
 
MO KELLY, HOST, THE MO KELLY SHOW:  Thank you. 
 
ALICE STEWART, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  Thank you, Rosemary.
 
CHURCH:  So, as Republicans come to terms with this shocking and disappointing midterm results, some party donors and leaders are apparently considering a post Trump future for the GOP, even as Donald Trump prepares to announce his intent to run again as president in 2024, perhaps as early as Tuesday we'll hear from him on that. But Trump lost the 2020 presidential election and now he is being blamed for this midterm losses. So, will Republicans dump him for Ron DeSantis or could Trump resurrect himself again? Alice, I put that to you.
 
STEWART:  Well, Rosemary, not only did he lose his re-election bid. Since he was elected, we lost the House and the Senate. And as "The Wall Street Journal" said, ever since he's been elected, he has a perfect record of electoral defeat. And what we're seeing in the results of this election is that the Trump-backed candidates, those that he endorsed and he put forth to run, many of them are election deniers. They believe the falsehood about widespread election fraud and they also advocated for and pushed conspiracy theories, and we're seeing voters reject that. 
 
Most of the candidates that Donald Trump put forth did not win. And voters spoke very loudly on that issue. Rational Republicans and commonsense conservatives want to put the focus on issues that are important to voters. That is, economy, inflation, as well as crime. And other Republicans also on the border. 
 
So, what many of those large donors and many of the rational Republicans want to put away with relitigating the past election and look at the future, and look at issues that are important. They don't see Donald Trump as the person able to do so. 
 
Many are ready to turn the page on Donald Trump, whether it is Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor, or any host of others that have expressed interest in running. A lot of people in the Republican Party say enough is enough of this losing and we need to find a new positive voice for the Republican Party. 
 
CHURCH:  And Mo Kelly, I'm guessing the Democrats would rather go up against Trump than DeSantis. What are your thoughts on that and will the Democrats sit back and enjoy this GOP leadership war that's clearly gearing up? 
 
KELLY:  Well, they're sitting back and they'll probably enjoy it, but I wonder if the Democrats won't overplay their hand or become too complacent in light of it. Now, one thing we can extract from this is I would say the J6 Committee did have an impact on the midterms and you can see by how Donald Trump is loosening his grip or losing his grip on the Republican Party. And I would directly connect that to the results of the J6 Committee. 
 
But the Democrats still have a lot of work to do. What I mean by a lot of work, Joe Biden is not going to be getting any younger and I don't mean that to necessarily insult him. It's just a reality of how people will perceive him in the next two years. We don't know what the economy is going to be in two years as the looming recession is looming over the American economy. 
 
So, the Democrats may be celebrating. They're doing better now than what they expected going into the midterms, but it doesn't mean the next two years are going to be any easier for them. 
 
CHURCH:  Interesting points. And Alice, midterms, of course, usually punish the party of the president, but instead, Republicans are licking their wounds. The Democrats will control the Senate while Republicans battle to control the House, probably with a razor-thin majority once all the counting is done. 
 
What deals will Kevin McCarthy need to make with the pro-Trump freedom caucus if he wants their support for his bid to be Speaker of the House, his big dream? 
 
STEWART:  Well, that's the $10,000 question, is Kevin McCarthy, who raised a lot of money for many of the winning members of Congress and has also really advocated for more of the issues that are important to people that this -- immigration, inflation, as well as crime -- the freedom caucus is a very vocal group of Republicans in the house and they are made stronger because they work in a group and in numbers. 
 <br>[02:10:02]
 
And they're advocating a policy that would allow them at any given point in the future, if they are upset with the speaker, they can remove him. And it would be quite foolhardy for McCarthy to agree to such a concession, but that's one of the concessions that they would want.
 
Right now, McCarthy is benefiting from the fact that former President Trump has endorsed him and has shown his support for McCarthy. If that continues, of course, we could all expect Donald Trump to change his mind at any time, but if he continues to have the support -- put his support behind McCarthy, I do believe that will quiet the freedom caucus in some way.
 
But McCarthy is certainly going to have to work a lot of deals, and he's working the phone lines to get the support he needs. But he wants to really take the focus off the election deniers and conspiracy theorists and put the emphasis on his commitment to America, which is really working on inflation, crime, and securing the border. That's what he really wants to focus on moving forward. 
 
CHURCH:  Mo Kelly, the Democrats of course are celebrating their big win in the Senate and still hoping they win Georgia as well on December 6th when the runoff is held between Raphael Warnock and his GOP challenger, Herschel Walker. But in the House, the counting continues but Republicans will likely be in control in the end, even if it is with this slim majority. What will that mean for President Biden as he tries to get his agenda through over the next two years? 
 
KELLY:  It means that he's going to have to resort to executive actions, and that is not necessarily a guarantee. We've seen with his student -- federal student loan relief being at least put on hold by a federal judge. But speaking of federal judges, since the Democrats will still retain control of the Senate, they will be able to confirm other federal judges, and if need be, a Supreme Court justice. 
 
So, if you're the Democrats, if anything, you would rather have the Senate than the House if you had to choose and you'll be able to get something done, but I'm not sure they'll be able to get much done. 
 
CHURCH:  And President Biden is, of course, enjoying his midterm boost on the world stage right now. The G20 summit just hours away from his face-to-face meeting with China's Xi Jinping. While the Republicans battle it out and point the finger of blame over shocking losses in the Senate, the House and in the state -- at the state level where Democratic governors have won big. So, Alice, who do you blame for this massive loss? 
 
STEWART:  Look, there's plenty of blame, certainly, to go around. But all I can say is Mitch McConnell probably was accurate a few weeks ago when he said candidate quality is a concern. When you have candidates, again, that are focusing on the past grievances of the former president instead of the future success of the American people, that is not a winning formula. 
 
But here's the key moving forward. Now it looks as though, if things pan out and the Republicans do gain control of the House, we have a beautiful thing which is called divided government. And this forces the White House, the House, and the Senate, Republicans and Democrats, to work together in a bipartisan fashion. 
 
And while Mo is completely accurate, President Biden can move forward going it alone and imposing executive actions on issues that he wants to promote. The best course of action for the American people is for Joe Biden to do as he said earlier this week, bring Republicans and Democrats together at the table and work across the aisle and get things done because that is clearly the message the American people have sent when we have such a very close divide on these races in the House and the Senate. They are saying let both sides have a voice, but it's up to our elected leaders to come together in a bipartisan fashion to get things done. 
 
CHURCH:  And Mo Kelly, you get the last word. What's your advice to Democrats to make sure these wins count, they don't squander this? 
 
KELLY:  Well, I would say Charlie Brown, Lucy with the football I think it would be in -- it'll be good governance to what Alice was saying, to negotiate with Republicans, but let's look at the past. The Republicans haven't shown that they want to negotiate in good faith with Joe Biden. And if that continues to be the case, then he should be ready to go it alone. 
 
CHURCH:  Alice Stewart, Mo Kelly, thank you to you both for your analysis. Appreciate it.
 
STEWART:  Thanks, Rosemary. 
 
KELLY:  Thank you.
 
CHURCH:  Well, fresh off some unexpected election wins here in the United States, President Joe Biden is in Bali, Indonesia for the G20 summit, as we mentioned. He met with the Indonesian president earlier, but his highly anticipated meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping is, of course, grabbing the headlines. 
 
The U.S./China relationship is in its worst shape in decades with tensions on a number of fronts, including Taiwan. As the U.S. says, it will defend the self-governing island from any Chinese invasion. 
 <br>[02:14:58]
 
Washington has also spoken out against China's human rights violations against ethnic Uyghurs. China on its end is concerned that Biden may change U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. The two sides could also potentially discuss Russia's war in Ukraine, North Korea's missile tests, and climate change. And CNN is covering this story from all the angles with Kevin Liptak and Ivan Watson joining us live from Bali, Indonesia. Good to see you both. 
 
So, Kevin, let's go to you first. President Biden set to meet with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, today. And, you know, he'll go face to face in this meeting. It's the first time since he has taken office that the two leaders will meet. And of course, he goes there with his midterm election boost. How significant is that and what is expected to come out of those talks? 
 
KEIN LIPTAK, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER:  Well, his advisers really do say that he is coming into this meeting with the wind at his back and it's been interesting. They've said that at the course of these meetings that the president has held over the last couple of days, that this has been a topic of discussion with other world leaders. 
 
They've come up to him, they've congratulated him, and they feel like he is coming into this meeting with a certain sense of strength. That American voters have sent him to these summits in a position of strength. Now, whether President Xi sees it that way I think remains to be seen. 
 
President Xi is also coming into this meeting having just gone through a significant political event of his own, the communist party congress that elevated him to an unprecedented third term. What President Biden's advisers really hope is that these two men can sit down, they can look at each other eye to eye and sort of define the parameters of this relationship. 
 
They have been pretty frank that they don't expect anything deliverable to come out of this meeting, nothing specific. No list of items that they have accomplished and there won't be a joint statement afterwards. But they do hope to do what they're calling building the floor of this relationship, essentially ensuring that it can't deteriorate any further. 
 
And it has deteriorated quite significantly over the last several months. Of course, the House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, when she visited Taiwan, that prompted sort of furor in Beijing. They cut off channels of communication. White House officials had already been working with their Chinese counterparts to arrange this meeting, but that was suddenly thrust into that context. 
 
They were able to work together over the next several months, talking to each other, for example, on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. They called those meetings substantive, constructive. They were still going as of late last night, going over some agenda items for the meeting, things that they wanted to emphasize, things that they wanted to deemphasize. And so that will all sort of culminate when the leaders sit down later today. 
 
For President Biden's part, he has been reading up. He's been talking to his advisers. He's sort of gone through scenarios for how this meeting might go. Things that President Xi might raise, how he might respond to them. But certainly, the midterm elections are giving him a boost, and you are seeing it on the international stage, Rosemary. 
 
CHURCH:  All right. Let's turn to Ivan. I wanted to ask you what Xi Jinping is hoping to get out of this meeting. 
 
IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, you know, he's been talking since he got this precedent-breaking third term in office in last month's communist party congress about threats to China's national security. He was dressed up in military fatigues just last week talking about the need for China's military to be prepared for war. 
 
One of his chief complaints about the U.S. is he accuses it of creating cliques, as the Chinese state media describes it, basically coalitions with other countries that Beijing sees as isolating and surrounding China. So, this is like the U.S. deal with Britain to provide nuclear submarines to Australia. The quad, which is the U.S. and Japan and India and Australia working together doing -- conducting joint exercises. 
 
And you do see Xi Jinping, after years of relative isolation due to the pandemic, coming here to Bali, making an outreach, face-to-face in person for the first time not only with the U.S. president, but also, he is going to meet with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and with the Australian prime minister, we've just learned, with whom the relations have been very tense as well. 
 
Chinese diplomats, Chinese state media, have acknowledged how bad the relationship is with Washington right now. They place the blame squarely on the U.S. for that. But in the same breath, they're saying, it is important to talk to try to prevent further deterioration of this relationship. 
 <br>[02:19:56]
 
When the White House says it wants to establish guardrails to avoid the competition between Beijing and Washington to turn into a conflict, China responds by saying, there are already guardrails. They are a series of joint agreements between Washington and Beijing that go back to the '70s and '80s where the former diplomatic relations between these two countries were first established. 
 
And so, they are accusing the U.S. of betraying these agreements where it's clear that the White House kind of wants an upgrade. Let's move this forward and acknowledge we're now competitors and establish a new system of rules. So, it may be far too much to expect that to be established here at this meeting, but even the Chinese, a very hawkish state media is conceding, this is important, there needs to be a face- to-face meeting, and that countries in the region want to see these two leaders meeting face-to-face to reduce the tensions across Asia and the Indo-Pacific. 
 
CHURCH:  And Ivan, as you have been speaking with us, we've been taking these live pictures. We just saw Chinese President Xi Jinping. His plane has landed there in Bali, Indonesia. He's disembarked from the plane with China's first lady. And he is there, of course, for the G20 summit. 
 
But probably what most people are waiting for is this face-to-face meeting that President Xi will have with U.S. President Joe Biden, who is there, and of course he has the wind at his back as we heard after his midterm election wins and we shall see what comes of that face-to- face meeting. The first between the two leaders since Joe Biden has taken office. 
 
Of course, they did meet again way back in 2011 when both of these leaders were vice presidents. So, we thank our Ivan Watson and Kevin Liptak, both of them joining us from Bali, Indonesia. 
 
All right. Still to come, police have arrested a suspect in connection with a deadly explosion in the heart of Istanbul. We will have the latest on that investigation. 
 
And from liberation to restoration, a freed Ukrainian city tries to rebuild after it was ravaged by Russia. Ahead, why the road to recovery could be long and exhausting. Right back in just a moment.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:25:00]
 
CHURCH:  Welcome back, everyone. A suspect is now in custody in connection with a blast in Istanbul which Turkish officials are calling a terrorist attack. 
 
(VIDEO PLAYING)
 
Turkey's interior minister has blamed Kurdish separatists for carrying out Sunday's attack. At least six people were killed and more than 80 wounded in the explosion which happened on a busy street in the heart of Turkey's largest city. Turkey's health minister says about half of those injured remain hospitalized. An eyewitness described what he saw, and a warning, some of the details are disturbing. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TARIQ KEBLAOUI, EYEWITNESS:  There was a fire on the ground and scattered beside it were a few dead bodies, missing ligaments. One man missing a leg. It was a very gruesome sight as everyone around me was totally scattered and panicked. And several people injured, bleeding from their ears, bleeding from their legs, and several people crying all around. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH:  For more on this we go to CNN's Scott McClean. He joins us live from London. Scott, what more are you learning? 
 
SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORESPONDENT:  Hey, Rosemary. Yes. So, the news that an arrest of the suspect had been made came from the Turkish interior minister who said the arrest was made by police in Istanbul overnight. And prior to that, 21 other people had been taken into custody. 
 
Now, he said as a preliminary finding, at least, that the blame he was assigning at that point was on the militant separatist group, the PKK, which is considered a terror group by not only Turkey but also by the U.S. and the European Union, though he did not explain precisely how exactly the link between the suspect and the PKK was made. 
 
Yesterday was a beautiful day in Istanbul. The weather was perfect. Istiklal Street is a busy pedestrianized street. It's popular with tourists. It is also popular with locals as well. And obviously this blast turned a perfect Sunday afternoon into a war zone in a heartbeat. And then for the next few hours, authorities started combing through CCTV footage to try to figure out where exactly that blast originated from. 
 
And we got news from the justice minister who said that on the security footage, you can see a woman walk up to a bench, put a bag down, and then sit down for more than 40 minutes. She gets up, she leaves the bag behind, and one or two minutes later, that blast goes off. 
 
Now, obviously, there's still a lot of unanswered questions about what precisely detonated that device, assuming that it was, in fact, inside of that bag. Whether or not there was a timer on it or whether she or some other person would have detonated that somehow remotely. 
 
Now, as for the battle with the Kurdish separatist groups, this is something that Turkey has been dealing with for the last four decades or so. This has cost tens of thousands of lives over the decades. And the justice minister or the interior minister, I should say, vowed that there would be a response, saying that those who caused this pain would experience their own pain in time. 
 
Now, Istanbul is no stranger to terror attacks, either. Though things have been relatively quiet for the last five or six years, but between ISIS and these Turkish -- and these Kurdish militant groups, 2016 was a particularly bad year. Perhaps there were few other countries on earth that year that were more scarred by terrorism than Turkey.
 <br>[02:29:58]
 
And many of those attacks took place in very public places, like this one, in Istiklal Street, which is one of the most famous streets if not the most famous street in the city. Quickly, Rosemary as for the victims, they include a young married couple, a mother and her 15- year-old daughter and a nine-year-old boy who was with a male relative. The -- more than 80 people who were injured, most of them well over half had been released from the hospital but there are still at last word five, who are in intensive care right now.
 
Of course, project President Erdogan he continued on with his trip to the G20 Summit in Indonesia. He has now arrived there, he had a lot on his plate. He has been working hard to try to broker some kind of agreement to get the Russians and the Ukrainians talking again, perhaps now, another thing on his agenda will be talking to allies about getting more security assistance to deal with terrorism. Rosemary?
 
CHURCH: Yes. Just such a tragedy. Scott McLean joining us live from London with the details there. Appreciate it.
 
Well, still to come. Allegations of Russian war crimes in Kherson, Ukraine says it has documented hundreds of cases since liberating the city. What the president is pledging to do about it, that's next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHURCH: The Ukrainian military says Russia may be preparing to step up its attacks in the newly liberated portions of the Kherson region. This is Ukraine as taking stock of the widespread damage Russian troops already left behind. Ukrainian officials say Russia-employed scorched earth tactics when it withdrew, destroying most of the city's critical infrastructure.
 <br>[02:35:01]
 
The area has also been littered with mines, one of which reportedly injured a family of four. And as Nic Robertson, reports residents in Kherson now face a long road to recovery.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Well, people are still celebrating their liberation. We were down in the main central square on Sunday people gathering there, there was somebody playing the trumpet, playing the national anthem, people singing along cheering and clapping. But you know, there's a real sense of now the city is liberated. But how is it going to reconnect and reintegrate with the rest of Ukraine.
 
The Russians on their way out, destroyed so much. They destroyed the phone connection, the internet connection. So, in that central square, you had people with their cell phones out trying to get Wi-Fi connection to the satellite connections that some of the soldiers have there. Also, by late in the day on Sunday, as well, the government was putting up a temporary cellphone service tower in the -- in the square in the middle of the -- of the city so that people can get connected with loved ones across the country.
 
But the government has a message for people it's still not safe to come back. There's still the possibility of mines, bobby trap. So, stay away. But there are so many problems here. The electricity is off, it's dark all around. There's no water, we went down to one of the places where people are getting water in the city. It's a well that's being pumped right next to the river. The river of course isn't clean, the water that's coming out is not safe to drink.
 
People have been going there now. They told us for the past four days since the Russians left and destroyed, you know, destroyed the water system in the city. This is water that they can use to wash but not to drink. So, the problems here are huge. The government says they want to tackle the electricity problem first, get that up and running, get the water up and running. We went to the hospital as well Sunday and there the doctors told us that their -- a lot of their equipments been taken away.
 
They don't have electricity either. They told us when they do surgeries, it's from the light of their cell phones. So, the situation here still really difficult. People happy to be liberated. But wondering about how they're going to be reconnected, reunited with the rest of the country. Nic Robertson, CNN, Kherson, Ukraine.
 
CHURCH: And still to come, they say the pen is mightier than the sword but what about a paintbrush or maybe even a spray can? We'll explain when we come back.

 <br>[02:40:40]
 
CHURCH: Welcome back, everyone. Well, as Russia's war on Ukraine continues, the street artists known as Banksy appears to be sending a message to the world that the Ukrainian spirit is stronger than any of Vladimir Putin's explosives. CNN's Michael Holmes has details.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR (voice over): The bombed out buildings of Ukraine that latest canvass for street artist Banksy. Murals in the secretive artist's signature style have been spotted recently in Kyiv and nearby towns. This one in Borodianka which was besieged by the Russians in the early weeks of the invasion until Ukrainian forces retook the town in April.
 
Banksy confirming his handiwork by posting pictures of it on his verified Instagram account. The murals drawing a steady stream of visitors many with their own interpretations of the artwork. 
 
This man says he thinks the gymnast balancing on a pile of rubble is Ukraine.
 
He says, it's a symbol that we are unbreakable and our country is unbreakable. And despite the fact that it's destroyed, we will rebuild everything. There is a trail of murals throughout the area, though these haven't been officially claimed by Banksy, like the scene of a child flipping a man in a judo uniform who some say looks like Russian President Vladimir Putin. Another mural in Irpin shows the gymnasts performing a ribbon routine despite wearing a neck brace.
 
Other scenes of not so ordinary life painted on buildings that seemed unfit to live in, in towns also destroyed by the Russians.
 
Possible calling cards from the anonymous artist whose trip to Ukraine might have been secret, but his message in this war zone is clear. Michael Holmes, CNN.
