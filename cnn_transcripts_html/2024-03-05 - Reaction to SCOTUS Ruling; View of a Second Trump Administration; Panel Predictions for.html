THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
<br>[06:30:00] 
 
KASIE HUNT, CNN ANCHOR: Almost 6:30 right here on the East Coast. Polls are opening there. We also have a look at Richmond, Virginia. They've been able to vote for about half an hour there in our neighboring state. And here's Houston, Texas. Polls open in about 90 minutes. Still pretty dark out there. 
 
It should be fairly calm for the majority of states with voters headed to these polls for Super Tuesday. You can see that in some of those pictures. The weather's not a huge problem.
 
Let's get straight to our weatherman, Derek Van Dam. 
 
Derek, good morning. 
 
Where should we be watching to see if voting today is going to get affected by anything that you are paying super close attention to?
 
DEREK VAN DAM, AMS METEOROLOGIST: Yes, maybe not a big deal but something we need to consider as you head out the door this morning, do I grabbed that umbrella, the rain coat, that type of thing. And there is the potential for severe weather, so we'll highlight all of that. Fifteen states. We've got them highlighted here on this particular map from the west coast. Northern California getting another rainstorm for the coastal areas to mountain snow for the higher elevations. 
 
Here's a severe weather threat, eastern Texas. That extends into Arkansas. Both of those states actually going to the polls today. And some wet weather along the east coast impacting places like Virginia, all the way to Massachusetts, also reaching the polls. 
 
So, just a general overview. Lots of wet weather. That is the name of the game from Atlanta, to Little Rock, all the way to Shreveport, Louisiana. 
 
This is a current radar. Look at that little spin in that storm system entering the East Coast. That is bringing rainfall to the Delmarva Peninsula. This is the major rainmaker entering the Florida peninsula -- panhandle, I should say, right now. And those are some stronger storms over eastern Texas. So, could impact the state there and that extends into central portions of Arkansas. We do have a marginal risk. That's a level one of five from the storm
 
 prediction center. Large hail, damaging winds can't quite be ruled out. But the bigger story here will be the rain. So, ponding on the roadways will be a possibility. 
 
Here's our flash flood threat for the day today. That extends from Atlanta, to Birmingham, southward to Montgomery and Tallahassee. You saw on the radar, very, very active moving in from the Gulf of Mexico, lots of moisture. 
 
And I've got to get this in because, yes, Kasie, we officially measured over ten feet of snow in California from our five-day blizzard that seemed like it would never end, but it's officially ended now. 
 
HUNT: Yes, Californians voting today too. 
 
VAN DAM: Correct.
 
HUNT: And I should note that ten feet, that's like three feet taller than Shaq. We were talking about how the forecast said it was going to be three feet over Shaq's head.
 
VAN DAM: It is verified. That's what matters.
 
HUNT: OK. Derek Van Dam, our weatherman. Derek, thank you very much. 
 
VAN DAM: Have a great day.
 
HUNT: All right, Donald Trump is calling the Supreme Court's decision to keep him on Colorado's 2024 ballot a, quote, "big win for America," end quote. And so too is his only remaining Republican challenger, Nikki Haley, despite some mixed reaction from the crowd there.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
NIKKI HALEY (R), 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The Supreme Court ruled today that Donald Trump could stay on the ballot. 
 
CROWD: (INAUDIBLE).
 
HALEY: And - no, I think - I think that was important. We don't ever want some elected official in a state or anybody else saying who can and can't be on a ballot. This is America.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT: Haley also told that same Texas crowd she'll beat the - that Trump - she will beat Trump, quote, "fair and square." 
 
Our panel's back with us. 
 
Kristen, listening to that crowd, I mean that sounds like a bunch of Democrats, if I'm being honest, right? Like - like, I'm happy Trump's on the ballot and she gets booed. Like who -- who do you think those people are? KRISTEN SOLTIS ANDERSON, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Those are people
 
 who are voting for Nikki Haley because they want to send a message, please don't give us these two options. Please give us something different. They are not at that Nikki Haley rally because they also kind of like Donald Trump. 
 
But I think it is smart for her to take this position because, first of all, I do think that even if you are a voter who's in the center and you don't like Donald Trump, the idea of the Supreme Court taking this away from you probably wouldn't sit quite well. 
 
But also, she's got a potentially long career in politics. I don't think that she wants to put herself fully into the never Trump wing of the party because it would be hard to come back from that over the long term. So, this is her way, I think, of saying, look, I'm different. I don't think we should pick him this time. He's not the right guy for the moment. But I don't want the establishment, big institutions to be the ones stopping him from being president if he's the nominee.
 
HUNT: Let's take a look at how the Biden campaign responded to the ruling yesterday when one of their spokespeople was on TV yesterday. 
 
Watch. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JEN PSAKI, MSNBC: What is your reaction to all of that? 
 
QUENTIN FULKS, BIDEN 2024 DEPUTY CAMPAIGN MANAGER: Well, one, first of all, I'm really excited to be here with you guys. But we don't really care because it's not been - 
 
PSAKI: Fair.
 
FULKS: It's not been the way that we've been planning to beat Donald Trump. Our focus since day one of launching this campaign has been to defeat Donald Trump at the ballot box. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT: Not that different from what Nikki Haley's saying, Bakari, just, we don't really care that this is how this played out. 
 
BAKARI SELLERS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I mean, I agree with that. I mean, outside a few of the people on the fringes, on the fringe left, that that may be their point, I don't think that the Colorado ruling was legally sound, but I don't want to bore people at 6:00 and put them back to sleep, and go through the - go through the - go through the --
 
HUNT: You wouldn't, Bakari. You're fascinating at all hours of the day.
 
SELLERS: Oh, I appreciate you. Or go through the legal reasonings that it was on shaky -- shaky
 
 ground. But this -- the president of the United States has said this, and people around the president have said this, I mean they haven't been running a campaign against Nikki Haley, they've been running a campaign against Joe Biden for the last three or four years. 
 <br>[06:35:07]
 
I mean -
 
HUNT: You mean Donald Trump? 
 
SELLERS: I mean - excuse me, yes, yes -
 
HUNT: Or you're saying -
 
SELLERS: Joe Biden has been running a campaign against Donald Trump, correct. And so I anticipate that to continue. I - nobody -- you cannot have a country where Bakari Sellers is kicked off the ballot in Texas, but on the ballot in New York. I mean that is the definition of a legal, slippery slope. 
 
ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: And it's not so much - yes, I agree. From what I hear from people around the campaign, even the White House, it's not so much looking at sort of -- sort of the decision here. 
 
One thing I do know that Biden allies, the campaign and the White House are looking at is, as these weeks go by, and as you get deeper into the general election, some are hoping that voters become clear- eyed, that it looks like Trump is going to be the nominee of the Republican Party. I've talked to plenty of Democrats that say that that would benefit them. It would almost back the argument that you'll probably hear more and more in the weeks to come where the White House tries to draw a contrast directly with the former president, calling him out by name, like we saw last week at the border as well with a sort of split screen with President Biden and the former president.
 
So, not necessary the court cases, but I do think you're hoping that the campaign hopes that voters realize that Trump is going to be the nominee likely. 
 
HUNT: Yes, I mean, Matt, this is a big part of what I hear from Democrats when they talk about -- whether it's the polling that doesn't look great for the president, or concerns about his age or whatever it might be, a lot of times they will say, well, voters don't actually believe that Donald Trump is going to be the nominee. They just don't think it's possible. And that when they do realize that, you know, it will become less a referendum on Biden, more a direct (INAUDIBLE). I mean do you by that? Like and -- I do get the sense that there are more voters and more honestly people, I see this in my own life, who are checked out of politics than there were, you know, while the Trump administration was still in town. And do you think that that plays into this at all? 
 
MATT GORMAN, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Yes. I think the latter point, absolutely. I think people follow this a lot further away than we all do, yes. I also -- but I also don't necessarily agree that people are in some sort of daze where they haven't been paying attention to the news and don't really realize that Donald Trump's in commanding lead for the primary. That sounds like a bit of a - a little bit of an excuse on their part. 
 
I think what we're seeing with the Biden campaign is this push and pull among what they actually are talking about. You had Mike Donilon, who's extremely close to the president, saying, we're going to talk about democracy. Then you had a frequent guest of this show, David Axelrod, kind of mocking it, saying that people aren't sitting around a table -
 
SELLERS: There's somebody who's not close to the White House is David Axelrod.
 
GORMAN: Hold on. Let's me finish. But he has some sense, I think, of what to talk about. He was saying that people aren't sitting around in Scranton talking about democracy. And there's this push and pull. You give the first speech of your re-elect the other -- before the end of the year on democracy. Within about ten days he starts talking about kitchen table issues are going to decide this election. There's this really kind of push and pull where you're talking about some more esoteric things or more tactical, economic things.
 
HUNT: Well, Biden is really personally motivated by the democracy issue. 
 
GORMAN: Exactly.
 
HUNT: I mean - I mean you do. I think any campaign would say, you've got to lean into what your candidate -- where your candidate is more comfortable.
 
GORMAN: Candidates are not - not always the best campaign managers, and there's the - that's the - that's the tough part.
 
SELLERS: Well, I think - I think - I think you'll see this coming up on Thursday in the State of the Union. I mean I think you'll see that theme of democracy because you have somebody who's kind of ripped at the fabric of democracy. But you also have a president who has been very consequential and actually has successes. And I'm not even talking about the individual successes he's had as a Democratic president, but the bipartisan successes, the soft landing after Covid that nobody thought was possible, a bipartisan infrastructure bill, the Inflation Reduction Act, I mean putting up justices that were, you know, bipartisanly appointed. So, these things are -
 
HUNT: They should just send you out on the campaign trail, Bakari. You just said it all there (INAUDIBLE).
 
SELLERS: I have five-year-old -- five-year-old twins.
 
HUNT: Last word.
 
KANNO-YOUNGS: But what you're hitting on is that balance that I'm looking to see if they strike. Not just contrasting themselves with Trump by talking about democracy, but also the polls that have been concerning to this White House in the most case are that voters actually don't understand still all of that of what's contained in the Inflation Reduction Act and infrastructure (INAUDIBLE).
 
HUNT: Yes.
 
SELLERS: It's not (INAUDIBLE) as feel. That voters don't feel it.
 
HUNT: Right.
 
KANNO-YOUNGS: Feel it. Feel it. That's right. Yes.
 
HUNT: They see their own grocery bill and they're like, the Inflation Reduction Act? What?
 
KANNO=YOUNGS: Which makes the message even more important.
 
SELLERS: That I - you know, why am I - why am I (INAUDIBLE) milk. My daddy was complaining about the price of whiting the other day. And the price of whiting at Piggly Wiggly has gone up. I mean these are real type of issues that people are - I mean that's a good fish to fry.
 
HUNT: Yes. No, for sure.
 
All right, our panel's going to stay with us.
 
Up next here, a reminder of what a second Trump administration might look like. 
 
Plus, the city of Miami breaking up with spring-breakers. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[06:43:00]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SETH MEYERS, HOST, "LATE NIGHT WITH SETH MEYERS": The full inspector general's report that the Trump White House was a pill mill and then a new report yesterday that said the Trump White House was just handed out Speed and Xanax like candy. And that story just came and went because there's too much (EXPLETIVE DELETED) going on. We didn't have time to talk about it. Us.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT: Seth Meyers joking about a defense inspector general's report that said stimulants were readily handed out during the Trump administration to their staffers. 
 
Now, why on earth, Kristen, would they have needed such things? What was going on? 
 
I just -- this made me flashback to just how intense it was in, look, when the Trump team was running Washington. And for today, on Super Tuesday, this -- the specter of that happening again is really very real. It's going to be more real at the end of today. The general election polling really shows that right now, if the election was held today, Donald Trump would more than likely end up becoming president of the United States again. 
 
And this is also part of, I think, where the campaigns are and where the Joe Biden team thinks they need to be in terms of underscoring, reminding people, what was it like when Trump was in charge in Washington and all of his staffers needing stimulants really spoke to me in terms of like, I mean, I should have -- I could've used some myself trying to cover it all. Like -
 
ANDERSON: Well, a big way that Joe Biden was able to defeat Donald Trump four years ago was by saying, look at all this chaos and mayhem. Aren't you tired? Don't you want to stop this? Vote for me. I will stop the chaos. 
 
The problem for Joe Biden is that the last three years have not necessarily felt less chaotic, less divisive. And so he doesn't have the luxury this time around of running and saying, if you put me in charge, you won't have to think about whose president anymore. You won't have to worry about this anymore. Part of that is Joe Biden's age, being a little bit older, sort of lends itself to this argument of, is this actually going to be stable or could this be relatively chaotic? 
 
But I do think that while Biden had a huge advantage on that attribute four years ago, that has now gone away and voters are like, well, if both Biden and Trump are going to lead kind of chaotic times, maybe Trump's policies are a little bit better for me. 
 <br>[06:45:08]
 
And so, I'll take the bad with the good. I think that's a bargain a lot of voters are making right now. 
 
HUNT: Bakari, how do you see this? Because, I mean, I will say, the pace that you had to keep to keep up with all of the things that were happening with Donald Trump was in the White House was insane. 
 
SELLERS: Yes, no, I think -- I think that that was a very good point that you made. There was so much chaos and mayhem that was a part of the Trump White House, the Trump Twitter feeds. I mean we would sit here on air and, you know, we -- I remember sitting on "STATE OF THE UNION" with Jake Tapper and we'd get in our earpiece, well, he just tweeted. And then, you know, the news cycle kind of changes into what he just tweeted about because he's tweeting out foreign policy. He's doing all these things. 
 
There is a difference, though, between that Trump and this Trump. And I think it's the people around him just in this particular moment. Trump's campaign is actually very sound. And the people running his campaign are very disciplined. Jason Miller and his team are very, very disciplined. Now, their candidate goes off on tangents quite often. They're doing the best they can with what they have. But at least there is some semblance of structure around the president. That is something that - that Joe Biden's going to have to push through and continue to break.
 
And there's going to be a variety of messaging because another four years of Trump is still going to be chaos. And they are both -- I have to reframe this argument a little bit -- they are both old, OK? People like to say Joe Biden is old. Well, Donald Trump is old too. That should be breaking news.
 
HUNT: Yes. People just don't seem to think that, right? Like, they think Joe Biden is old. They attribute that to him.
 
SELLERS: How old is Donald Trump?
 
HUNT: He is three years younger than Joe Biden.
 
SELLERS: Old. 
 
HUNT: Yes. I'm not disputing that. I'm just saying, the polls show voters don't seem to think so.
 
GORMAN: Eighty-six percent for Biden. I can't get 86 percent of the people to say that your sweater is red, like, right, or maroon. Like, that is a -
 
SELLERS: (INAUDIBLE).
 
HUNT: (INAUDIBLE) widely say maroon.
 
GORMAN: That's a wild statement.
 
SELLERS: But the fact it's not red.
 
GORMAN: It's more reddish. It's in the family.
 
SELLERS: That was (INAUDIBLE).
 
KANNO-YOUNGS: Maroon, maybe.
 
HUNT: It's definitely red.
 
GORMAN: It's a red - yes. Hey, you know, I'm a guy, anyway.
 
But -
 
KANNO-YOUNGS: I'm a guy.
 
HUNT: Oh, my gosh. That's on your.
 
GORMAN: It's all in the family.
 
HUNT: It's fine. I forgive you.
 
GORMAN: But, like, what - you know, I - look, I agree with what Kristen and Bakari said to an extent, that the Trump campaign, from what it was in '15 and '16, I mean it's remarkably disciplined, remarkably well-run, remarkably organized. You're going to see a huge delegate lead at the end of the night tonight likely because of what the organization in the prior years have done in states like California, where taking it away from proportional allocation in a lot of these congressional districts to making 50 percent plus one get all the delegates. So, he's going to romp in California, where if this was in 2016 he might get, you know, a plurality of delegates. 
 
And also when -- if he comes into power, if you remember, they got that first wave on the beach, so to speak, were a lot of former RNC hands, you had Sean Spicer, you had Reince Priebus, you had people who were hopeful that they - you know, we can kind of keep a lid on things and tame, and by the end, you know, by end of 2020 it was just kind of, you know, a rowdy band of, you know, pirates. So, you can't say -
 
HUNT: Sean Spicer outside the White House in the grass. Yes.
 
GORMAN: Yes. So, -- 
 
HUNT: Remember that?
 
SELLERS: It's true.
 
HUNT: I blocked out some of those things that I covered in the Trump administration, I'm not going to lie.
 
GORMAN: I remember that too. But you're going to have that starting this time. And I think they are far more organized of what they want to do immediately upon coming off -- entering office than they were --
 
HUNT: How does the Biden team look at all this?
 
KANNO-YOUNGS: I was just going to say, I mean, one thing that I think you're going to see - or I'm interested in seeing is how they, again, sort of continue to try to draw the contrast of the chaos that could be to come, not just pointing out -- as you said, there's less of these sort of chaotic moments that may be 2016 during the campaign. It's more disciplined now. 
 
So now, if you're the Biden campaign, the White House, you're focusing on some of the policy proposals they've put up. I mean just through my lens I -- I tend to write about immigration a lot and I know that the Biden campaign, the White House, have been highlighting, look, you know, if you thought that the first term was extreme, look at what is being proposed for this upcoming term with potentially trying to end birthright citizenship, more travel bans, more travel restrictions, seismic changes at the border, scaling up entire camps for undocumented immigrants. 
 
So, it's not just that issue, not just that policy, I'm looking to see how the White House and the campaign looks at policy proposals and policies to come to draw the contrast moving forward.
 
SELLERS: And that's going to -- that's going to be huge, particularly in states like Minnesota, where, you know, you can -- you can talk about his immigration bill and the first thing -- one of the first things that - that the former president of the United States did was a Muslim ban. And where you're having an issue, such as Gaza, which is on the forefront of a lot of the things that Democratic voters are caring about right now, the question that many - that the White House is posing is, are you really going to sit out the election or jump out over me to vote for somebody who's first policy proposal was chaotic and was a Muslim ban. And that is a question that they're asking voters. 
 
HUNT: We're actually going to get an interesting test in Minnesota on whether there's an uncommitted action there.
 
SELLERS: Minnesota.
 
HUNT: I'm not going to - I'm not going to even try.
 
KANNO-YOUNGS: That was good. That was good.
 <br>[06:50:00]
 
HUNT: Very good. I'm impressed. 
 
Panel, stay with us, please.

All right, still ahead here on CNN THIS MORNING, who says there's no crying in football. First, this stunning realization from comedian Jon Stewart.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: Breaking news this morning, the United States Supreme Court ruling that former President Donald Trump cannot be removed from any state's ballot. 
 
JON STEWART, HOST, "THE DAILY SHOW": I think the real breaking news here is, Wolf Blitzer and I appear to be merging. I -- we are becoming one.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
STEWART: Trump can still be president if he's convicted. I mean none of the cases will -- would stop that. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right. I'm - I'm glad you brought that up, Jon. Democrats say if none of these cases go their way, there is still another avenue to pursue.
 
STEWART: The getting more votes scenario? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They're not there yet.
 
STEWART: Oh.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT: Jon Stewart back with all of us. Never -- never fails to disappoint.
 
All right, let's do final thoughts and predictions on this Super Tuesday.
 
Kristen, what are you watching for today? 
 
ANDERSON: I'm looking to see, does Nikki Haley win any state. And if she doesn't, does she persist in the race past tonight or does she decide, I made my case, my faction is a large enough piece of the party, but I'm going to walk away now.
 
HUNT: Zolan, what are you thinking? 
 
KANNO-YOUNGS: I'm looking at California. I think there's an interesting race out there. Do you have a potential sort of interparty, you know, contests between Adam Schiff and Katie Porter. But -- 
 
HUNT: Yes, yes, let me back you up -
 
KANNO-YOUNGS: Sure.
 
HUNT: Because you're talking about the California Senate race.
 
KANNO-YOUNGS: Correct. Yes.
 
HUNT: Which I agree is super interesting and it's a jungle primary, so it's not like we're going to get - we're going to get two people out of this race. 
 
KANNO-YOUNGS: Right. That's right.
 
HUNT: We know Adam Schiff is going to be one of them, right? 
 
KANNO-YOUNGS: Right. 
 
HUNT: So talk about this other piece.
 
KANNO-YOUNGS: And then it's effectively sort of a contest to see who gets that second slot. And right now you have Schiff and allies actually investing money in a Republican challenger so that he doesn't have so much of a tight contest possibly with Katie Porter moving forward. 
 
I mean we've seen that -- that strategy before in politics, but interested to see how it plays out here. 
 
HUNT: Yes, I wonder if it will come back to bite him. I don't know.
 
Bakari, what are you watching?
 
SELLERS: The differences between the primaries and the caucuses in the Republican -- I mean this is kind of nuanced and in the weeds. I think Nikki Haley will do pretty well in Alaska and Utah because those are caucuses. Those aren't primaries. And I think she'll win Maine. So, I'm calling it. Nikki Haley wins three states tonight. To -- the both of the -- she goes up - she bats 100 percent -
 
HUNT: I'm writing it down. OK. 
 
SELLERS: She bats 100 percent in the caucuses, that's Alaska and Utah, and she wins Maine. 
 
HUNT: Alaska. She wins Maine. All right, I think you're -- you're coming back tomorrow, right?
 
SELLERS: I'll be here in the morning. 
 
HUNT: Can we hold you accountable?
 
SELLERS: Yes. 
 
HUNT: OK. SELLERS: I might have on the same thing, but I will be here.
 
HUNT: I will be here. I will not be wearing the same thing.
 
SELLERS: Will it - will it be red.
 
HUNT: I don't think anyone would approve it. It might not be red.
 
Anyway. 
 
Matt, what are you looking for in Super Tuesday?
 
GORMAN: What I'm looking for, honestly, I - the California Senate race, obviously, as well. Also, Sheila Jackson Lee is in a very tough primary down in -
 
HUNT: Congresswoman in Texas, yes.
 
GORMAN: Yes, who is often on this network and others. Very visible. Longtime member of Congress. She went to run for Houston mayor. (INAUDIBLE) the ball a little bit. Somebody who's in the race to succeed her. Stayed in the race when she went back to her House seat and has raised a lot of money. I wouldn't be surprised if Sheila Jackson Lee lost.
 
SELLERS: Amanda - her name is Amanda Edwards. Right. 
 
GORMAN: Amanda Edwards. Yes.
 
SELLERS: She'll be very young. She'll add a - she'll add a lot of youth to this very aging body up here.
 
HUNT: Interesting note from Bakari.
 
Kristen, let me like circle back to what you were saying because I am actually really interested in your take on what you think, if Haley wants to have a future in politics, like what she should do, because there is this question of, you know, should she dropped out? What is the best timing for her? And also, should she endorse Trump? What do you think? 
 
ANDERSON: So, I think staying in the race much longer past tonight is a potential problem. If she really -- if she -- maybe if she pulls off these three states that Bakari has picked, maybe that gives you the reason to stay around a little bit longer. The longer she stays in the race, the more likely it is that Donald Trump tries to pin a general election loss on her and people like her. 
 
Now, its possibly he'll do this anyways, right? When -- if Donald Trump loses, he never says - it's always not his fault. But to be able to say, hey, I would have won if only those establishment rhino Republicans hadn't sold me out. The longer she stays in the race, the longer that can stick. 
 
With that said, I think if she puts herself in a position where it seems like she's trying to help Joe Biden beat Donald Trump at all, that does make it really hard for her, at least in the short term, to have a future in the party. But nothing in politics is forever.
 
SELLERS: We all know Nikki Haley is going to endorse Donald Trump eventually, right? Like, this is who Nikki Haley is. 
 
HUNT: That's my question.
 
SELLERS: I mean that is -- she will -- I mean, I'm known Nikki Haley a very long - 
 
GORMAN: I'd be surprised if she didn't.
 
SELLERS: Yes, I've known Nikki Haley a very long time. As far as she walks out on that ledge, saying this and that about Donald Trump, she's going to come back and say, he's not Joe Biden. This is for America, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
 
GORMAN: And, remember, she -
