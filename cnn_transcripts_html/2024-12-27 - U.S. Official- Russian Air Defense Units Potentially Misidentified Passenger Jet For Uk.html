KATE BOLDUAN, CNN HOST: OUTFRONT next:
 
A fatal error. A U.S. official telling CNN that Russia may have confused the passenger jet that crashed for Ukrainian drone -- as we hear from passengers who survived the terrifying crash. 
 
Plus, a second stowaway on a second Delta flight. This time, the person was caught just minutes before takeoff. So how does this keep happening? 
 
And breaking news, President-elect Donald Trump tonight with a last minute request, asking the Supreme Court to save TikTok, at least for now. 
 
Let's go OUTFRONT. 
 
Good evening, everyone. I'm Kate Bolduan, in for Erin Burnett.
 
OUTFRONT tonight, a deadly mix up. CNN is learning tonight that Russian forces may have confused the passenger jet that crashed on Christmas day for a Ukrainian drone. That is, according to a U.S. official. 
 
Video shows the jet plunging to the ground in Kazakhstan and then bursting into flames. Thirty-eight people were killed. We know around the same time, the Azerbaijan Airlines jet was scheduled to land in southern Russia, there was, in fact, a Ukrainian drone strike in that area. And today, the White House National Security Council spokesman, John Kirby, he pointed the finger directly at Russia. 
 
(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)
 
JOHN KIRBY, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL SPOKESMAN: We do have -- have seen some early indications that would certainly point to the possibility that this jet was brought down by Russian air defense systems. 
 
REPORTER: Do you have actual some kind of intelligence or information, whether its like infrared or something that's beyond just sort of the informed speculation we've been seeing? 
 
KIRBY: Short answer to your question, Courtney, is yes. (END AUDIO CLIP)
 
BOLDUAN: Yet Russia appears desperate to try and shift blame anywhere else, now suggesting the pilot of the doomed jet is at fault. 
 
Just listen to one top Russian aviation official tonight. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DMITRY YADROV, HEAD OF RUSSIA'S FEDERAL AIR TRANSPORT AGENCY (through translator): The aircraft commander made two attempts to land the aircraft in Grozny, which were unsuccessful. The commander was offered other airports, but he decided to proceed with the Aktau airport. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOLDUAN: So that's the angle from Russia, from Azerbaijan, where the flight and airline originated, its preliminary investigation says that the crash was caused by, quote, physical and technical external interference. 
 
And now, we're hearing for the first time from passengers who survived that crash. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAFA SHABANOVA, SURVIVOR OF AZERBAIJAN AIRLINES CRASH (through translator): About 20 or 30 minutes after takeoff, we felt two explosions. The plane was supposed to land, but it didn't. Something exploded inside twice. A man's hand was injured. We panicked. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOLDUAN: Unbelievable. 
 
Nada Bashir is OUTFRONT live in London for us tonight. 
 
And, Nada, more survivors of the crash are speaking out and sharing harrowing accounts of what they experienced. 
 
What more are you learning? 
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's right. We've been hearing harrowing accounts, Kate, but also seeing video footage filmed just moments before the crash took place. And these videos will be crucial for investigators as they continue to examine evidence to try and piece together what exactly led to this plane crash. 
 
We've been taking a look at one of those passengers who recounted those final moments, both on board the plane and then, remarkably, as he survived and received care in a hospital. Take a look. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BASHIR (voice-over): Subhonkul Rakhimov thought he was plunging to his death. He said he heard a bang before oxygen masks dropped, reciting the Shahada, the Muslim proclamation of faith, he says what he had thought to be his final prayer. 
 
According to Azerbaijan Airlines, the plane had faced physical and technical external interference. As the pilot attempted an emergency landing, the plane burst into flames upon impact, 38 people on board did not survive. 
 
SUBHONKUL RAKHIMOV, PLANE CRASH SURVIVOR: Allahu akbar. 
 
BASHIR: Remarkably, Rakhimov was among 29 people who survived the crash. 
 
After the bang, I already had my mind set that something bad would happen, because it was clear that the plane had received some damage, Rakhimov says. 
 <br>[19:05:06]
 
And when the plane started behaving unusually, then it became 100 percent clear. I realized then that it was all over and decided I should film my final minutes. 
 
Accounts from survivors like Rakhimov give a rare first hand glimpse into the terrifying final moments of the flight, and potentially what may have caused the crash. 
 
Azerbaijani sources and a U.S. official say preliminary evidence suggests the plane may have been hit by Russian air defenses. A possible case, one U.S. official told CNN of mistaken identity with the Russian city of Grozny, the flight's intended destination under Ukrainian drone attack at the time. 
 
Ukrainian combat drones were mounting terrorist attacks on civil infrastructure in the cities of Grozny and Vladikavkaz, the head of Russia's federal air transport agency said. Due to this, in the area of the Grozny airport, the Kovyor plan was introduced, meaning all aircraft had to leave the indicated airspace immediately. 
 
Russian aviation authorities claim the plane had initially attempted to land in Grozny twice, and was later offered other airport options within Russia, but the pilot rerouted towards the Kazakh city of Aktau instead. 
 
For those on board, it was a terrifying physical and emotional ordeal. For a brief moment, passengers thought they were out of danger. 
 
But when the Caspian Sea appeared, the clouds dispersed and the plane began to behave unusually, Rakhimov says, the feeling of tension began to increase, both for other passengers and for myself. 
 
Russian authorities have yet to respond to allegations that their air defenses may have played a part in the fatal crash, but clear perforations in the fuselage point to shrapnel or debris hitting the plane while still in the air. According to several aviation experts, the hope now is that recovered black boxes will provide more definitive information regarding the plane's final moments. I was conscious when I felt the impact. I was thrown up and down and
 
 back up again. I was strapped in, yet I was being thrown back and forth, Rakhimov recounts. It all lasted for a few seconds.
 
Then everything went quiet. There was silence. Everything was calm, and I realized that that was it. We had landed.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
BASHIR (on camera): And, Kate, we have been getting updates throughout the day, one U.S. official telling CNN that the whole scene in the fuselage and the wreckage are consistent with potential shrapnel damage as a result of an explosion. So further leading into that speculation that this may have been caused by Russian anti-aircraft air defense systems. 
 
But again, it is still up to investigators to continue to examine the evidence at hand. And of course, with regards to those black boxes that have been recovered, authorities say it could take around two weeks to complete their assessment -- Kate. 
 
BOLDUAN: Yeah, and we focus on those -- on the investigation. But my goodness, hearing those accounts, it is just unbelievable that they lived through what they did. 
 
Nada, thank you so much for your reporting. 
 
And OUTFRONT with us now, CNN aviation analyst Miles O'Brien, retired Army Major General James "Spider" Marks, and Seth Jones, national security expert and senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. 
 
Miles, I want to start with you with the latest of what we're just learning about this plane crash. You hear those remarkable, terrifying first hand accounts from that survivor of the crash. What stands out to you? 
 
MILES O'BRIEN, CNN AVIATION ANALYST: Well, first of all, what a remarkable kind of clear eyed, cool headed account from a passenger who's been through an amazing, harrowing ordeal. It's just -- it's frightening to even think about what he's been through. But for him to relate what he had done for us in such a factual way was, was helpful, I think. 
 
But you know what? Ive been thinking about a lot this afternoon, Kate, is the decision to dispatch that aircraft. The airline does have a lot of responsibility in all of this. 
 
It was not a secret that those drone attacks were occurring in the Grozny region. It was not a secret that in order to thwart a drone attack, you jam GPS, which of course is an aid to navigation for civilian airliners. It was not a secret that this was, you know, for all intents and purposes, a battle zone. And for that matter, the Russians should have closed the airspace, but they did not. 
 
So the fact that that aircraft was even in that area stands out to me right now. There are a whole sequence of events which led to what were seeing here right now on top of that. But like any accident, it's always a series of events. And if you pull one of those events out of it, oftentimes it doesn't happen. 
 
BOLDUAN: And Russia also now, Miles, is suggesting it was the pilots fault because they were given different landing options, and Russia says they didn't take it. You know, a second black box from the plane has now been recovered. 
 
Is -- is that interaction some clarity on that? I mean, is that what the black box could provide? 
 
O'BRIEN: It -- it never hurts when you're a guilty party to blame a dead pilot, frankly. They don't refute the claim to blame the pilot. And this is beneath contempt, frankly.
 <br>[19:10:06]
 
What they did was, in my view, rather heroic. They tried to land in bad weather conditions. The GPS probably made it even more difficult. They probably flew an abnormal flight path as a result of the missed approach, mistaken for another aircraft. A hostile aircraft shot down and then or shot at and then were able to limp that aircraft across the Caspian Sea, an extraordinary bit of airmanship, in my view. 
 
BOLDUAN: Yeah. Miles, thank you as always. It's very good to see you. I really appreciate your time tonight. 
 
I want to go now to Spider Marks and Seth Jones. 
 
Spider, how easy should it be for a military to distinguish between a drone and a commercial airliner? And what does it say if the Russians couldn't tell the difference? 
 
MAJ. GEN. JAMES "SPIDER" MARKS (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, essentially, Kate, there are there are two ways to do it. One is you're going to do it by radar. You're going to have some type of a return on a screen. And then secondarily, you're going to have visual identification. 
 
And what it appears at this point -- and again, realize this is all conjecture on our part until all the facts are in, is that it looks like as a result of the aborted, attempted landing at Grozny, they were close enough to the ground and ground based air defense systems, which are dumb weapon systems, you're essentially shooting bullets into the sky, managed to hit the target. At least that's the initial view that we have right now. 
 
But a drone is going to have a much different, frankly, a very erratic pattern in order to do what its trying to do relative to a commercial aircraft, which is a very predictable low slow, at this point kind of approach into an air -- airfield. 
 
So trying to as, as Miles indicated, victim blaming -- blaming is a very cheap way out of this thing and probably a very predictable narrative that were going to see. But it wouldn't be confusion on the ground. It's -- it certainly is just the combination of an incredibly capable military, the Russian military, which is immensely led by feckless leadership. That combination is incredibly dangerous. And we're seeing that right now. 
 
BOLDUAN: Yeah. Seth, you say that it will be telling if it turns out Russia's military was at fault. Why? 
 
SETH JONES, PRESIDENT, DEFENSE &amp; SECURITY DEPARTMENT CENTER FOR STRATEGIC &amp; INTERNATIONAL STUDIES: Well, Kate, one of the things that's been interesting is I've had multiple conversations over the last two weeks with senior Ukrainian officials, including ones involved in building their drone program. 
 
And what we have seen is a notable increase in domestically produced, although parts are coming from outside drones that the Ukrainians are using for long range strike with higher payloads against Russian targets in Russia itself. So things like air bases, logistics hubs, weapons depots and some of the drones that they're using actually are small airplanes that they've pulled out the manned components and put in components to allow them to be remotely controlled, put on high volumes of explosives, and then use them for essentially suicide attacks into targets. 
 
So, you know, in a sense, there -- there's sort of this interesting psychological effect that it's having -- that it may be having on the Russians where they're a little trigger sensitive right now because they're -- they're seeing so many of these drones target various aspects of Russian territory. 
 
BOLDUAN: Hmm. 
 
And, Spider, do you think that Russia will hold anyone accountable if it is on them? And will Russia be held accountable by the international community if it is on them? 
 
MARKS: Well, the international community, let's be a little bit cynical about this, has little capability to hold anyone accountable. They have no enforcement mechanisms. So there may be an attempt to identify how this came together. 
 
And then I -- and then if Russia is in fact, let's just give them the fact that they shot this thing down. There's very little promise that anybody will be held accountable. 
 
Russia, on its part, might hold a bunch of folks accountable and make that very visible. But that's all internal for a domestic audience. The external audience in that case should be very, very cynical about that result. 
 
BOLDUAN: And speaking internally, Seth, you've been analyzing how Russian state media is covering this crash. What are you seeing? 
 
JONES: Well, Kate, it's very interesting and very telling and not surprising looking at Russian propaganda over the last several decades. Frankly, multiple decades, the Russians have a concept which we can call a fire hose of falsehood. So they -- they used it, for example, during the Malaysian airlines 17 crash, where they put out high volumes of information on multiple channels. 
 <br>[19:15:08]
 
So I was looking at Sputnik and RT, a number of social media platforms, raising questions about whether it was other causes. So we've seen pilot error. We saw just earlier. 
 
We've seen weather related issues, including fog. We have seen Ukrainians blamed on multiple platforms. We've seen an oxygen tank come up in Russian propaganda. 
 
All of these are designed with kind of a basis in psychology to confuse individuals watching. And just to be clear, this is misinformation. This is these are blatant Russian media lies to try to confuse individuals both internally but also externally about the causes of this, because they certainly do not want to take responsibility. 
 
So this is classic Russian propaganda.
 
BOLDUAN: Staying true to form. 
 
Gentlemen, thank you both so much. It is good to see you this evening. 
 
OUTFRONT for us next, another stowaway busted for sneaking onto a Delta flight. How does this keep happening? And what does it say about the security at America's airports right now? 
 
Plus, breaking news, President-elect Donald Trump going to bat for TikTok, tonight, asking the Supreme Court to postpone next month's ban. So why now? 
 
And one Democrat with a simple solution on how to start winning again, he says act like a normal human being. Is it just that?
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[19:20:38]
 
BOLDUAN: Tonight, another stowaway caught on another Delta flight. This one headed to Hawaii. Airport officials tell CNN the stowaway managed to get through security without a boarding pass the night before, then boarded the flight the next day. They were discovered while the plane was taxiing for takeoff. 
 
It is the second stowaway incident with Delta in just really the last month. Right around thanksgiving, you'll remember. A Russian national and U.S. permanent resident bypassed security and made it all the way from New York to Paris. 
 
Carlos Suarez is OUTFRONT for us now. 
 
Carlos, walk us through what happened this time. 
 
CARLOS SUAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT; Well, Kate, there are so many questions tonight about what happened, including just how much time this unticketed passenger spent at this terminal before boarding this flight. There's also, of course, the question of how this person was able to get past a TSA security checkpoint without a boarding pass in the first place the night before this flight on Christmas Eve. 
 
And then there's also the fact that when the flight crew realized that there was a stowaway on board that aircraft and they decided to turn the plane back around, when that aircraft gets back to the gate, we're told that this person managed to run out of the airplane before law enforcement arrived. 
 
And so, we're told that authorities actually had to rely on surveillance video from the airport in Seattle to figure out exactly where this person was. They were able to detain the person inside of a bathroom. 
 
Here now, is another passenger that was on board that flight, describing this entire ordeal. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRADY BLY, PASSENGER ON SAME DELTA FLIGHT AS STOWAWAY: We were kind of left in the dark. 
 
It's kind of scary if somebody just sneaked on the plane like that. I don't think Delta did everything they could to protect people on the flight. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SUAREZ: All right. Kate, it's important to note here that according to the TSA, this passenger did not have any prohibited items. Of course, Delta Airlines as well as TSA, is still trying to investigate how all of this could have taken place -- Kate.
 
BOLDUAN: Clearly. Great to see you. Thank you so much, Carlos. 
 
Juliette Kayyem joining me right now for more on this. 
 
Juliette, how has this happened, twice in one month with the same airline? 
 
JULIETTE KAYYEM, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Yes. We'll, lets start with delta. It clearly is a delta issue right now. It might apply to other airlines. So we have to examine whether delta has recently changed any procedures or its employees under tremendous stress. What happened with that plane on the 25th that the guy was able to get off? 
 
There's a lot of issues around Delta specifically that have to be addressed. But to be clear, this was a lot of failures, not just deltas, because at airports there's two sort of separate security aspects. I mean, the first is what's called identity verification. That's when you and I give our -- our ID and the TSA agent determines whether we are, in fact, you know, Juliette Kayyem. 
 
The second one, though, is called the boarding status station. That's the one where you're getting onto the plane. That's ensuring that you have the right tickets. In both cases, very rare, but in both cases, in relatively recently, both systems seem to have broken down. And this, you know, give -- give the FAA and airlines some credit. 
 
I mean, there's about 2.9 million people daily, according to the FAA on -- in aviation. So this is still a small part. But, you know, these are the last lines of defense. So they really do have to be tightened up. 
 
BOLDUAN: There also seems to be another security issue is when they brought the person, brought the plane back to the gate, and then the person was able to run off the plane before security arrived. 
 
KAYYEM: Yeah, that one is the one where I'm sort of like, what? Like, I mean, I literally I cannot answer that one for you. Generally, I try to give you an explanation. This one is some -- you don't have someone who does not have a boarding pass. You don't know what he has brought, what he has brought on, who he is, whether he left something behind. 
 
Did he check anything? You know, the other passengers deserved that person being apprehended, and to determine that that wasn't a present security risk. Instead, he's allowed off the plane. 
 
It's that piece of it is just absolutely inexplicable. I'm not giving excuses. It was Christmas Day. Maybe some systems were a little bit weaker than they normally are, but that one is sort of inexplicable to me. 
 
BOLDUAN: So then what needs to be done? Like what is the prescription here? Because something should be fixed. If there are these levels of security and the system has failed. 
 <br>[19:25:07]
 
KAYYEM: Yeah, yeah. 
 
So I mean, we do have to go back and figure out something specifically with Delta. That something is happening at their borders -- boarding status stations that's allowing people in is I'm curious, is there new technology? What were they using old tickets? 
 
We'll learn all of these things to -- to try to get on. More generally, the system is under stress. We know more people are flying. So that's going to mean that were going to need probably more personnel. 
 
Look, this is not just impacting the people on the plane. I mean, the ripple effects of global aviation. If you have a delay in Seattle, that's going to be felt in Asia in a couple of minutes, right, because you have to control the airspace. 
 
And so we really do have to tighten it up here to ensure that it doesn't impact people all over the world. 
 
BOLDUAN: Yeah. And that's even beyond the beyond the scary security threat that that could potentially pose. It's great to see you, Juliette. 
 
KAYYEM: Thanks.
 
BOLDUAN: Juliette, thank you so much for coming.
 
OUTFRONT for us next, breaking news, President-elect Donald Trump throwing TikTok a lifeline for now. What he's now asking the Supreme Court to do. Plus, a civil war erupting inside Trumps party as MAGA takes on Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy over immigration.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[19:30:26]
 
BOLDUAN: Breaking news tonight, President-elect Donald Trump urging the Supreme Court to pause the controversial ban on TikTok, set to take effect the day before his inauguration. It's one of the most significant cases pending before the high court. President signed the ban on the wildly popular video sharing app into law earlier this year. 
 
And Trump's plea to pump the breaks here comes after he met with TikTok CEO at Mar-a-Lago earlier this month.
 
Alayna Treene OUTFRONT for us now near Mar-a-Lago.
 
And, Alayna, what are you learning?
 
ALAYNA TREENE, CNN REPORTER: Well, Kate, it's clear that Donald Trump's argument and push for a delay, the implementation of this ban, puts him at odds with the Biden administration, which in its own brief on Friday as well defended the ban and argued that, you know, there was this warning of, quote, grave national securities concerns about TikTok's continued operation in the U.S., with the key focus on concerns around China's influence on the U.S. through the platform.
 
Now, key thing that the Supreme Court currently needs to weigh as whether or not this ban would violate First Amendment rights. Donald Trump's brief and his team was briefed today did not really get into, you know, whether or not this violates the First Amendment and what this case poses, but he did argue that essentially he wants this pause on the ban so that his incoming administration can try to negotiate some sort of deal with TikTok. 
 
Now, one thing that is clear is that TikTok is, of course, very popular in this country. It has 170 million users and monthly users, I should say. And Donald Trump has wavered on this in the past, but it's clear that recently he said that he wants to save the app, that he is warming to it. And as you mentioned, he did meet recently with TikTok CEO, Kate. 
 
BOLDUAN: Yeah, he absolutely did. 
 
Alayna, thank you so much for that. 
 
Also tonight, the only person to ever lead both the CIA and the FBI speaking out and saying that Donald Trumps picks to lead two critical intelligence posts are not fit to serve. We're talking about William Webster. He writes in a letter to senators that will be considering the nomination that the close relationship between Donald Trump and Kash Patel has his -- who is his pick to run the FBI raises serious concerns. 
 
He also writes that Tulsi Gabbard has a profound lack of experience for the director of national intelligence post. Webster served under Presidents Carter, Reagan, and George H.W. Bush. 
 
Katelyn Polantz OUTFRONT for us now in Washington with much more on this. 
 
And, Katelyn, what else does he say in this letter? 
 
KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Kate, William Webster is one of the most esteemed people in law enforcement and national security in American history. And he is saying he is deeply concerned about these two choices of Donald Trump, Kash Patel to lead the FBI and Tulsi Gabbard to be his choice to be the top spy, the director of national intelligence. 
 
Webster says he's concerned about the impartiality of the people in these roles. He reminds senators in a letter on Thursday that whenever he was serving under president carter and President Reagan, there were one time each for each of those presidents where they reached out to him, and he made sure to tell them that his agency, the FBI at the time, would need to be independent and impartial. 
 
What he says about Patel is specifically with this. Patel is somebody who has said he wants to investigate the investigators, has been encouraged to investigate the January 6th committee on the Hill, and Webster writes: While Mr. Patel's intelligence and patriotism are commendable, his close political alignment with President Trump raises serious concerns about impartiality and integrity. Statements such as he's my intel guy and his record of executing the president's directives suggests a loyalty to individuals rather than the rule of law, a dangerous precedent for an agency tasked with impartial enforcement of justice. 
 
His issue with Tulsi Gabbard, it's a little bit different. He seems to have an issue more with her level of experience in handling intelligence. Former Army National Guard veteran is what she is, as well as a former Democratic congresswoman.
 
He writes: Congresswoman Gabbard's profound lack of intelligence experience and the daunting task of overseeing 18 disparate intelligence agencies further highlight the need for seasoned leadership. This is no time in world history for a novice in the field to learn this role. 
 
Both of these people have been on Capitol Hill meeting with senators, and it's ultimately going to be up to the U.S. Senate to decide whether they will be confirmed as the nominees -- Kate. 
 
BOLDUAN: Katelyn, thank you so much for laying it out for us. Joining me now, former Democratic Congressman Mondaire Jones and
 
 Shermichael Singleton, both here with me. 
 
Thanks, guys, for being here. 
 
Shermichael, that is a strong warning and a very clear description of why he thinks that they are not qualified from a man with singular experience, the only person to have ever led both the CIA and the FBI. 
 <br>[19:35:11]
 
Do you think Patel and Gabbard are in trouble? 
 
SHERMICHAEL SINGLETON, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I think Gabbard is going to have a tough uphill battle, in part because of some of the statements we've seen from many Republican senators on some of her positions on national security. I think that all of the other nominees will probably ultimately get confirmed from some of the things that I'm hearing.
 
A lot of Republicans do believe that Trump was given a mandate to sort of act in a certain way in terms of appointments and ultimately confirming those appointments. It's very rare, Kate, that you'll see the party -- senators of the party of the president-elect vote against all of his nominees. Maybe one may not get past maybe two at most.
 
You know, there's historic precedent for that. But beyond that, I just don't see that happening. So again, I think Kash Patel, I think Pete Hegseth. I think even RFK could probably get confirmed. Tulsi, I'm not necessarily sure, but everyone else, I think they'll probably ultimately go and lead and they'll follow the directive from the president-elect, as they should. 
 
BOLDUAN: I think that's part of the -- a little bit, part of the issue that Webster is taking here is following directives rather than being than impartiality. I mean, we'll see what kind of impact this letter has. 
 
But, Congressman, you also heard the reporting from Alayna Treene, this breaking news that Donald Trump making a formal request to the Supreme Court to basically pump the brakes and pause on the TikTok ban. I mean, we all covered how many times this was talked. 
 
Republicans, Democrats, they all agreed on this. Biden signed this into law. Mitch McConnell signed a brief and just sent it to the high court saying, please don't block this ban. It's entirely consistent with the First Amendment. 
 
And then there's this -- it's kind of Trump's at odds with a lot of people on this one. I mean, does he face headwinds? Who knows what the court will do? But just his reaction to this? 
 
MONDAIRE JONES (D), FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE: Yeah. This is the most billionaire thing ever. 
 
BOLDUAN: These things I don't say often. JONES: The incoming president, a billionaire, cares very deeply about what the billionaire major investor in TikTok has to say. 
 
His name is Larry Ellison. He's been lobbying the president to put a pause on this. And so that's why you see the reversal in Donald Trumps position. In fact, he's taking a strong definitive position now in opposition to this, you know, forcible sale of TikTok. And it passed under a Republican majority in the House of Representatives with bipartisan support for reasons of national security. 
 
BOLDUAN: Yeah. 
 
JONES: And because a guy -- 
 
BOLDUAN: And this was long debated. I mean, it was talked about for quite some time. 
 
JONES: It was -- it was vetted in the press, I would say. 
 
BOLDUAN: I would say so. 
 
JONES: It was controversial. People were lobbying on both sides. Members of Congress didn't all agree on this. 
 
But what happened was it was a robust process and there was a result. And because someone who hosted a major fundraiser for the incoming president and who got a the president and CEO of a company he founded to also donate, I think, about $125,000 in addition to everything else that Larry Ellison has done for the incoming president. Donald Trump has reversed his position, and we're going to see that a lot. 
 
He is surrounding himself with people like Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy, and others who care very deeply about any number of policy positions and who have helped him financially. 
 
BOLDUAN: It's unclear, though, what the -- what the pause and let us try to negotiate this beyond a ban would mean. But I mean really interested to see what the -- what the Supreme Court decides here. 
 
And then, Shermichael, then there is, as Axios put it, a MAGA world civil war erupted. This is one thing that we started talking about this last night. I did not see it becoming as big as it has. I guess my news judgment is completely off. 
 
Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are now pitted against a -- I'm going to just like, generalize the rest of MAGA world, but everyone gets my drift here -- over, well, immigration. But Vivek's long missive essentially calling American workers mediocre and worse and using that as a defense for foreign worker visas, Musk tried to come to his rescue today. It does not look like they are calming down any of the anger that is coming at them over this. 
 
The one person who has not weighed in is Donald Trump. Should he? 
 
SINGLETON: I think he should. Like, I'm vehemently opposed to what Vivek Ramaswamy posted. And the defense of Vivek by Elon Musk, who I respect for his ingenuity, I thought it was frankly insulting what he wrote about Americans. 
 
I've traveled all across this country, rural towns, Appalachia. Ive seen a lot of poor white families with very talented, incredible kids. I've been to a lot of inner cities and rural towns, a lot of Black kids with poor families, and I've seen a lot of talent and ingenuity there. 
 
And the one thing that I that I see missing, the common theme is a terrible education system, the lack of guidance, the lack of mentorship. And so what that tells me is that if were able to reform our education system, which I would argue most Americans would agree, it needs to be reformed, we are falling behind by every metric in some very key areas, particularly as it pertains to STEM. 
 <br>[19:40:12]
 
Let's invest in those places. I get the argument of saying, well, look, that's going to take time. We do need some foreign workers to fill in the void. I'm okay with that. Filling in the void does allow us to put a microscope on the areas where we are struggling, but I strongly believe in championing the policies, Kate, that that -- that sort of reinvest in the American workforce, that that returns that pride that restores that pride of American ingenuity. 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
BOLDUAN: It seems antithetical to making America great again. Yeah, that's what I'm saying, yeah.
 
SINGLETON: That's the premise of my argument here. Absolutely. You can't do that by saying, well, lets just flood in by bringing in other people. That's not what I want. 
 
And so I think a lot of Americans, a lot of Trump supporters look at this and they beg the question -- well, what about access to the American dream for our kids, for our grandkids? And when you see that message, I don't see that that line, that message and what Vivek and what Elon Musk are arguing here. 
 
So I'm opposed to it. And I think the president elect needs to come out and set the record straight that they do not speak for him or his immigration policy. 
 
BOLDUAN: Well, I mean, you know, the president will definitely say that, no one speaks for Donald Trump, right? But he has been silent and I don't know, what do you think of this? 
 
JONES: Look, I'm not surprised at all. The modern day Republican coalition is one of the most counterintuitive coalitions. I think in a long time. 
 
Yeah. The most obvious example of that is you got a lot of white working class voters voting against their economic interests. It's always been a party whose business elites have really set the policy agenda and so on. This issue that matters a great deal to people who own companies, who
 
 run companies, and especially in Silicon Valley, where the incoming president has made significant inroads, at least after this last presidential election cycle, you're going to see real tension on this issue. 
 
BOLDUAN: If nothing else, Vivek Ramaswamy seems, I guess we'll call it tone deaf in that message, and that delivery. 
 
Great to see you.
 
SINGLETON: That's why -- that's why he didn't do so well in the Republican primary. Kate, that's exactly why he didn't do well, because of his lack of message and understanding of where the American people are and their expectations about the future. We have inherited an amazing thing as Americans, and it appears to me that we're not handing off what we've inherited to the next generation. 
 
And so, again, the question for us, that burden for our leaders is, what can you do to make sure that the future generations can compete against other countries, such as China? Bringing in more people is not the answer. It's a band-aid to a longer term problem. 
 
BOLDUAN: Well, one thing we do know if you read Vivek's missive, is he does a good job using the word venerate a lot. So you can definitely you know, were working on our vocabulary words. 
 
So I really appreciate it, guys. Thank you. 
 
OUTFRONT for us next, the man who wants to run the DNC says he knows how to win back the White House. His advice? It seems like a no brainer. He joins us next. 
 
Plus, they've been key to Putin's successes in Ukraine. And tonight, we take you inside one of Russia's rapidly expanding drone factories. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[19:47:15]
 
BOLDUAN: Acting like a normal human being. Does that sound like a wild notion? Well, that is the exact prescription that Democratic Senator Brian Schatz actually says his party needs from its next presidential nominee. 
 
It's also a similar message that we have heard from one DNC chair, candidate, James Skoufis, who is also a New York state senator. 
 
And he joins me right now. 
 
It's great to see you. 
 
So you want this top job at the DNC. You want to run the party in the coming cycle. You told Brian Kilmeade in a recent interview, noteworthy also, interview with Brian Kilmeade. You said: We as Democrats have a lot -- for a lot of voters have become unrelatable. How so? 
 
JAMES SKOUFIS (D), NY STATE SENATOR: Yeah. So first, thank you for having me. Now, when you're the first step, when you're in a hole is to put down the shovel and stop digging. And I think we have to be honest with ourselves. 
 
Yes, Tim Walz was absolutely correct when J.D. Vance was nominated. He is weird. He acts weird. He sounds weird. But if were being frank, we can sound weird, too, sometimes as Democrats.
 
And the senator from Hawaii is absolutely correct in that we can sometimes be a little bit more overly interested in placing voters into academic categories and buckets than we are talking to the working class concerns that people have here in America. And we saw some of that this past election. There's no question about it. 
 
BOLDUAN: You have the -- you've said you have the 40 signatures from members that are required to take part in the candidate forums. It starts the first one is in just ten days. It's an opportunity for you to really introduce yourself in a broad way to DNC members. It's an important moment. 
 
What is your brand of Democrat, Senator? And how is it different from the others who want the same job? 
 
SKOUFIS: So the next DNC chair, I believe, and this is what I'm running on, has to be focused on one thing and one thing only. And that is throwing out the stale, ineffective D.C. playbook. 
 
And look, I come from a district that Donald Trump just won by 12 percentage points. He's won it now three times. And we have to do a lot more listening and a lot less lecturing with voters and do a lot less listening to the D.C. consultant class. 
 
I spoke with a DNC member just a few days ago who told me that she was getting upwards of 16 mailers a day in Arizona in the heat of the campaign. We're literally lighting money on fire, so we have to reorient organizationally within the DNC to our party loyalists, our boots on the ground, send those resources to human to human contact, partnerships with organized labor. 
 
But within the party, broadly speaking, we need a National Democratic Party that, you know, that addresses this trust gap, this reputational deficit that I think we've developed, unfortunately, whereby over the past four years, we were telling people the economy was doing well, when in fact, when they went to the supermarket, they saw for themselves it was not. 
 
We've got to be speaking to the issues that they care about, not running away from them and pivoting and trying to convince them whatever is in our mind on our agenda. 
 <br>[19:50:06]
 
BOLDUAN: Part of it is how are you going to address, deal with, fight against or talk about the president elect and Donald Trump? We had other candidates that are running for the same job, Robert Hutton was on, and Martin O'Malley have been on recently on the show, and they both have very different views on Donald Trump. Let me play this for you. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ROBERT HOUTON, RUNNING FOR DNC CHAIR: We also need someone who will agree with President Trump when he's right, and there's a reason why he had that decisive victory, because he was right on so many issues. 
 
ERIN BURNETT, CNN HOST: Do you see anything Trump is doing right, Governor?
 
MARTIN O'MALLEY, RUNNING FOR DNC CHAIR: I really cannot see anything that he's doing right. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOLDUAN: Who do you agree with? 
 
SKOUFIS: I certainly agree a lot more with Martin O'Malley. I'm not running for DNC chair to agree with anything that Donald Trump is doing or saying. He's hoodwinked a lot of people. He lies day to day, basically. I -- we saw that for four years when he was in office. We're going to see it again for the next four years. 
 
And let me be clear, the circus is already apparent to most American voters in the electorate. He's nominating a wrestling executive to run our nation's education system, an anti-vaxxer to run our nations health care system. That is all going to be apparent front and center, if it's not already for voters. 
 
The Democratic Party, though, can't just be the anti-Trump party. We have to get back to putting our values, our working class values, front and center. 
 
BOLDUAN: That reminds me. You're not anti-Trump. We've heard Democrats recently, Joe Manchin, former Democrat, saying the brand is toxic. 
 
Liz Smith, big Democratic strategist, she says that the brand is in the toilet. What's your one word of what the Democratic Party brand is right now? 
 
SKOUFIS: I don't know that I want to put it into one word, but we have to do better. I think that's got to be with contrition. We've got to go to some of these voters who were once under our big Democratic tent that are now on the outside looking in, and we've got to go to them with some contrition, and say, hey, we haven't done -- we haven't met your expectations completely. We're going to do better. This is a new Democratic Party moving forward. 
 
BOLDUAN: Yeah, who cares where it is? You got to do better. 
 
Thank you so much. Nice to meet you. Thank you very much for coming in. Thanks for the time. SKOUFIS: Appreciate you.
 
BOLDUAN: OUTFRONT for us next, incredible new details tonight on the perks that Putin is now offering in order to get people to produce drones for his war in Ukraine. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[19:55:52]
 
BOLDUAN: Tonight, new details about a rapidly growing facility fueling Putin's war. 
 
Clare Sebastian is OUTFRONT.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The caption My mom's reaction when she found out I earned more than her, cat videos TikTok memes all part of a recruitment effort funneling workers into Russia's ever expanding drone program. 
 
The videos are made by Alabuga Polytechnic -- a technical college based in at the Alabuga Special Economic Zone in southern Russia, the same site identified by the White House last year as Russia's domestic Shahed factory producing Iranian-designed drones. 
 
In February, the U.S. slapped sanctions on Alabuga, noting it exploited underage students from an affiliated polytechnic university as laborers to assemble these attack UAVs. David Albright, a former nuclear weapons inspector, has been tracking Alabuga since 2022.
 
DAVID ALBRIGHT, INSTITUTE FOR SCIENCE AND INTERNATIONAL SECURITY: The only benefit is -- is the high salary but the males get exemption from military service, and so that -- that's a drawing card.
 
SEBASTIAN: A Ukrainian intelligence officer only authorized to speak to CNN anonymously told us those perks come at a cost.
 
"OREST", UKRANIAN DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE OFFICE (through translator): All students involved in the production of these UAVs live at a separate limited access compound. Once employed, they sign NDAs. Their contracts say they produce motorboats.
 
SEBASTIAN: And yet, as recruitment efforts step up, this video from July allowed the facade to slip. 
 
Thinking of starting 10th grade, says the voiceover, join the Super Elite program, air navigation, and drone programming at Alabuga Polytechnic and help the Stalin's Falcons, That's a new drone unit in the Stalin's Falcons. Pause here and you see the distinctive serial number of the Russian produced Shahed and the unit emblem.
 
In July, Russia fired 422 Shahed or similar drones at Ukraine. By November, it was almost six times that. Analysis of Air Force reports and official data show. To meet that demand, Shahed production at Alabuga has more than doubled this year, say CNN sources in Ukraine's Defense Intelligence. And there's a new product.
 
This is the Gerbera, a much cheaper copy of the Shahed pictured in a video posted in July by the Stalin's Falcons, that same drone unit. For this volunteer air defense unit in Kyiv, it's clear the cheaper copies are fueling bigger attacks.
 
YURIY CHUMAK, UKRAINIAN AIR DEFENSE VOLUNTEER: Now they send -- Russia sends every day a lot of drones. More of them are not even with the explosive things. It's just very cheap and very simple drones.
 
SEBASTIAN: For Yuriy Chumak, a serving Supreme Court judge by day, there's no denying the decoys are working.
 
CHUMAK: We cannot detect what it is. You just see that it's drones so you shall use missile or you shall use machine gun to shut down it.
 
SEBASTIAN: CNN's sources in Ukrainian defense intelligence believe Alabuga will produce up to 10,000 Gerberas this year alone. Analysis of downed drones shows Russia has also adapted the original Shahed, making it tougher, more weatherproof, and in some cases, deadlier. 
 
In late October, experts in Kyiv found traces of thermobaric munitions on downed Shaheds.
 
OLEKSIY STEPANIUK, KYIV SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH INSTITUTE OF FORENSIC EXPERT (through translator): There were several of them. Their effect is that they're used as incendiary munitions. In a certain radius, they disable all equipment and people.
 
SEBASTIAN: Ukraine has tried hitting back. This April strike, using a modified small aircraft, blew a hole in the roof of a worker dormitory at Alabuga.
 
But neither that strike nor international sanctions could stop the breakneck pace of expansion here. Between March and September this year, two entirely new buildings appeared next to the original ones. 
 
And this image from late November seems to confirm they're connected. New covered walkways link old and new buildings. Another looks set to join the factory to the worker dormitories now fully repaired.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They started to create, we thought, drone cages over the buildings. And then as they build other buildings, it looks like they're expanding the security perimeter.
 
SEBASTIAN: NATO told CNN it is, quote, well aware of Alabuga and expects it to ramp up production even further. This military patriotic team-building event for Alabuga students, a glimpse into the high- octane world behind that security fence.
