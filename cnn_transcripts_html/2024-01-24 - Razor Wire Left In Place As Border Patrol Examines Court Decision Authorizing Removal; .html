JOHN BERMAN, CNN HOST: This morning, razor wire remains in place on the U.S. Mexico border in the Eagle Pass, Texas area, that is despite a Supreme Court ruling which would allow U.S. Border Patrol to remove the wire that was deployed by the Texas Governor, Greg Abbott.
 
CNN's Rosa Flores is on the border in Eagle Pass, Texas. Rosa, tell us what you're seeing and what's actually happening with this wire.
 
ROSA FLORES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: John, good morning. You can see behind me the razor wire is still here. And the acting CBP commissioner telling my colleague Josh Campbell that there's no timeline to remove the razor wire. But I want to show you the difference in posture when it comes to the state government and the federal government because the state of Texas rolled up in here in Humvees and soldiers with long guns. You can see one of the Humvees back there. Lots of razor wire and they commandeered a public park and 2.5 miles of the Rio Grande and kicked out Border Patrol.
 
Now, the federal government, for its part, it has sent two demand letters to the State of Texas, demanding access to this area. Now, one demand letter was sent last week. The deadline was Wednesday, that deadline came and went, and the State of Texas did nothing other than say that it was not going to surrender to the federal government. Well, the federal government sent out another demand letter yesterday. We're waiting to see what the response is from the State of Texas.
 
But I want to point out that not only has the State of Texas taken over this public park. Take a look at the sign behind me, U.S. government property. No trespassing. So, not only is the federal government asking for access to a public park and to the river, but to their own property. This is a bridge that crosses over a waterway that meets with the Rio Grande, and the federal government doesn't have access.
 
And John, there are so many extraordinary things about this particular situation on the border, like a state taking over an area and not allowing the federal government to come in. But normally these disputes in policy, we see those play out between politicians that see the president and the governor, or lawmakers and the president, what have you.
 
But the difference here is that we're seeing the difference on the ground. Normally, law enforcement agencies on the ground are not involved. We don't see the different badges, whether it's the state government or the federal government badges duking it out on the ground. Well, that's what we're seeing here. It's a standoff. Border Patrol was kicked out and the State of Texas is saying that they're not letting them in. John.
 <br>[10:35:00]
 
BERMAN: Yes, this is a very unusual standoff, to say the least. Rosa, keep us posted as it develops. But for now, the razor wire is still up. Thank you.
 
Kate.
 
KATE BOLDUAN, CNN HOST: All right. So, about last night, now, Republican lawmakers are weighing in on Trump's win in New Hampshire and Nikki Haley's promise to keep fighting on to South Carolina.
 
Manu Raju's on Capitol Hill. He's got more on this. Manu, what are you hearing?
 
MANU RAJU, CNN ANCHOR: Yes, this group, Senate Republicans, a lot of them have been slow to embrace Donald Trump. Many of them, frankly, fearful that Donald Trump's impact down ticket could hurt their chances of taking back the Senate, something they witnessed back in 2022. Something they fear that could happen again, particularly as you look at the numbers from last night over the last couple of states in which Trump has, in some ways, struggled with some of those more moderate voters last night, and particularly struggling with independent voters.
 
And that is the question that I put to a number of these top senators today, who -- even the ones who have endorsed Donald Trump. Senator John Cornyn, who was one of them, came and announced his support of Donald Trump last night. He has raised concerns in the past about Trump's electability and made clear that Trump needs to broaden his appeal to -- beyond his base in order to win in November and help Republicans down the ticket.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEN. JOHN CORNYN (R-TX): I think if the president would pick Tim Scott as vice president, I think that would be a really a good ticket. But I think you're right. There needs to be outside -- after a primary, there needs to be a broader appeal than just the primary voters. You can't win with just your own base.
 
RAJU: Do you think that it's time for Nikki Haley to drop out? SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): Well, I'll leave that up to her, but Trump is in a commanding position in South Carolina. I think, for all practical purposes, the primary is over. She's done better than anybody in the history of South Carolina. She has a lot to be proud of. But her assessment last night of President Trump, I don't think will be widely shared in South Carolina.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
RAJU: And the last comment coming, of course, from Senator Lindsey Graham who also hails from South Carolina and has supported Donald Trump for some time. I asked him about Nikki Haley's criticism, that Donald Trump was not fit to be president. That he said that that is not a view that South Carolinians will show. But the concern also among Republicans is that this will go on for some time. That the party will have a harder time to unite, particularly if it's Donald Trump gets pulled into a back and forth with Nikki Haley, as we saw last night.
 
So, the concerns about one unifying to about actually appealing beyond his very hardcore base, beyond Republican voters and into those -- into the key demographics of his key for swing states like Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania. Things that Donald Trump needs to win back the presidency. All of which is -- underscores just the hesitance among Republicans here in the Senate, in particular, to get behind them.
 
And a lot of them, too, have fresh memories of everything that happened in the aftermath of January 6th. One of them, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, who, right after January 6th, said that Donald Trump was morally and practically responsible for the actions of that day.
 
Yesterday, I asked McConnell whether or not he will have to repair his relations with Donald Trump in order to go forward, in order -- if he is the nominee. He declined to comment. Also declined to say whether or not he would endorse him even as some other members of his leadership team are backing him. Not every member of the Senate Republican leadership team. It just shows you the challenges that Trump has had in appealing to some of his -- who we would assume, would be his closest allies. Republicans in Congress, from the Senate side, still some hesitance and concerns about the likely top of their ticket, guys.
 
BOLDUAN: Fascinating. Manu, thank you so much for gathering that and bringing it to us. Really appreciate it.
 
John.
 
BERMAN: All right. It is seen as one of the greatest acts of unintentional irony in awards history. So, who gets nominated for the blockbuster film about women's role in society directed by a woman? That's right, it's Ken. And we have fresh comments from Ken on this, sort of.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [10:43:51]
 
BERMAN: All right. This morning, Nikki Haley is on her way back home to South Carolina. We're waiting to see if she speaks in the next few hours and how she plans to continue her campaign. One question is, how will she be received by her home state voters?
 
CNN's Gary Tuchman heard from them directly.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We know we have a long way to go but at least, at the moment, some of the places you need to fill in -- 
 
GARY TUCHMAN, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): We watched CNN's New Hampshire primary coverage with loyal Republicans from South Carolina. What could be a crucial primary state.
 
Most of the people we watched with are planning to vote for Donald Trump. Nine of these 13 say they will vote for the former president.
 
TUCHMAN: Donald Trump made it clear in his speech. He thinks this is over. Nikki Haley says she is continuing. Who thinks it's over? You do. Tell me why.
 
RENATA DESILVA, SOUTH CAROLINA TRUMP SUPPORTER: Because the results that we got tonight, that was the answer for her. It's over.
 
TUCHMAN: What do you think?
 
MACKENZIE DAVIS, SOUTH CAROLINA TRUMP SUPPORTER: I agree. I do think that it's over. We'll see, when South Carolina, but I think that it's over.
 
TUCHMAN: Do you think Nikki Haley should stay in the race?
 
LARRY KOBROVSKY, REPUBLICAN CHARLESTON COUNTY COUNCIL MEMBER: I think it would be a very tough road for her. I think if you look at our state, our governor, both our senators, our -- five of our six congressmen, all came out, you know, for Trump.
 <br>[10:45:00]
 
TUCHMAN (voice-over): Two people on our panel are planning to vote for Nikki Haley.
 
SAMUEL RIVERS, SOUTH CAROLINA HALEY SUPPORTER: She said she's going to stay in the race and we'll see what she does. I think at the proper time she'll make that decision, but right now she's not at that position -- at that decision, you know.
 
DICKIE SCHWEERS, SOUTH CAROLINA HALEY SUPPORTER: I think she should stay in the race. I think she has come from behind in other races and I think she has four weeks, I believe it is, to make some changes in her campaign. And I think she needs to really drive her message home to South Carolina voters. TUCHMAN (voice-over): Notably, 12 of the 13 people in our group tell us they thought Nikki Haley was a good governor.
 
GRAHAM HORSMAN, SOUTH CAROLINA TRUMP SUPPORTER: Well, I think it's undeniable that Nikki Haley had a good track record as governor, but President Trump had a good track record as president.
 
MAMIE RAND, SOUTH CAROLINA TRUMP SUPPORTER: I don't know if it's so much that she wouldn't do a good job at that. I just think she's the wrong person for the job -- 
 
TUCHMAN: Why is that?
 
RAND: -- at this time.
 
TUCHMAN: Why is that?
 
RAND: I just think Donald Trump has made a presence in our world. He has made hard decisions with other leaders all across the world.
 
TUCHMAN: It's a survey we've done in Iowa, a survey we did in New Hampshire. Is Donald Trump fit for the presidency if he's convicted of one of these felonies against him? Raise your hand if you think he is fit for the presidency, even if he's a convicted felon. High -- raise it high so we can see you. Raise your hand if you don't think he's fit for the presidency. All right.
 
SCHWEERS: I'll qualify that. I think he would need to go through all the appeals right on up the ladder. And if he's still, guilty, then I don't think I would find him fit.
 
TUCHMAN (voice-over): The South Carolina Republican primary is on February 24th.
 
Gary Tuchman, CNN, Mount Pleasant, South Carolina.

BERMAN: Very interesting real-time reaction. Thanks to Gary for that.
 
Kate.
 
BOLDUAN: A snub for one of the summer's biggest blockbusters. Ryan Gosling, America Ferrera speaking up, defending their colleagues, hitting the Academy after two people who brought "Barbie" to life were left out of Oscar nominations.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MARGOT ROBBIE, ACTOR, "BARBIE": What's going on? Why are they mimicking at me?
 
RYAN GOSLING, ACTOR, "BARBIE": Yes, they're also staring at me.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:51:35]
 
BOLDUAN: Life imitating art. Actors, America Ferrera and Ryan Gosling, are slamming the Oscars after a "Barbie" snub that feels too much like a scene straight out of the summer blockbuster. Watch this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOSLING: Everything, basically everything exists to expand and elevate the presence of men.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's amazing.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Beautiful.
 
GOSLING: I Know.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Barbie's here.
 
ROBBIE: Ken, what have you done? What are you wearing?
 
GOSLING: Don't question it. Just roll with it, tiny baby.
 
ROBBIE: Don't call me baby.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOLDUAN: Well, Ferrera and Gosling, they received individual Oscar nominations yesterday. Their co-stars, Margot Robbie and director Greta Gerwig, did not, prompting the actors to speak up on their behalf. Gosling saying in a statement that he's -- well, he's proud to portray Ken, but "There is no Ken without Barbie. There is no Barbie movie without Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie, the two people most responsible for this history-making, globally-celebrated film."
 
Let's get over to CNN's Elizabeth Wagmeister for more. Elizabeth, as John Berman put it, it's the greatest unintentional irony in the history of movie awards. Did it come as a surprise?
 
ELIZABETH WAGMEISTER, CNN ENTERTAINMENT CORRESPONDENT: This absolutely came as a surprise. This was the biggest film of 2023, making over $1.4 billion, and the first film ever to cross $1 billion at the box office to come from a female filmmaker, that is Greta Gerwig. You cannot overstate what big of an impact this film had, not just on the movie industry, but also on women in film.
 
Now, we have not heard yet from Greta Gerwig or Margot Robbie. But as you said, we've heard from America Ferrera. We have heard from Ryan Gosling. And I reached out to Women in Film, which is an advocacy group that fights for equity for women in the entertainment industry. And here is what they told me. They said, "While we are thrilled to see a record number of films by women nominated in the best picture category, it is disappointing to see that women at the helm of both "Barbie" and "Past Lives" were disregarded in both directing and lead performances. The industry often takes women's work for granted. And even the women behind the highest grossing film of the year or most critical -- critically beloved are not exempt."
 
Now. you see there that they are also calling out another great film, "Past Lives", which comes from a different female filmmaker, Celine Song. This just highlights that the Academy has a big history and a big problem with recognizing women in film. In the 96-year history of the Oscars, Kate, only seven women have been nominated for best director and only three wins.
 
But of course, this goes to the bigger question of "Barbie". It goes just beyond women in film. The cultural impact of this film was immense. From people celebrating it when they turned out in droves to go to movie theaters wearing pink. And now we see it with society defending the fact that these two women were snubbed.
 
BOLDUAN: Yes, it's great to see Elizabeth.
 
A second chapter for the impact of "Barbie", John Berman.
 
BERMAN: I'm just Ken.
 
BOLDUAN: That's right you are.
 
BERMAN: We are standing by from signals from Nikki Haley's campaign in South Carolina about what she plans to do next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:59:35]
 
BERMAN: New Hampshire was so yesterday. And already this morning, in fact, since we've been on the air, a slew of new developments in the presidential race. Nikki Haley is on her way home to South Carolina. We are waiting to hear from her when she lands. Her campaign just released two new commercials there. That doesn't sound like someone dropping out. But the chair of the Republican Party, the National Party, is questioning her ability to continue.
 
And new this morning, the Georgia Republican Party chair and the RNC delegates from there, they are calling for Haley to drop out.</pre>
