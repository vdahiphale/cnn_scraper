THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What`s up superstar. Happy Friday, Friyay. I`m Coy Wire. This is CNN 10, let`s rise up, finish this week strong. 
 
We begin today with Boeing CEO, Dave Calhoun, acknowledging that his company made a mistake after an Alaska Airlines flight had to make an 
 
 emergency landing last week. That flight landed shortly after takeoff from Portland, Oregon after a door plug for the Boeing 737 Max 9, actually 
 
 detached and left a gaping hole on the side of the plane. Fortunately, none of the 177 passengers were seriously injured. 
 
Safety inspections are currently taking place on the grounded aircraft, but as CNN`s Ivan Rodriguez tell us questions are swirling over what mistake 
 
 Boeing is actually admitting to.

DAVE CALHOUN, BOEING CEO:  We`re going to approach this, number one, acknowledging our mistake.
 
IVAN RODRIGUEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Boeing CEO, Dave Calhoun, acknowledging the company`s mistake on Tuesday. Following Friday`s emergency landing 
 
 after a panel blew out in flight in the side of a Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft. But according to top safety officials, it`s not clear what that 
 
 mistake is.
 
JENNIFER HOMENDY, CHAIR, U.S. NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD:  He stated that mistakes were made and I`d like to understand what mistakes 
 
 he`s referring to.
 
RODRIGUEZ:  Jennifer Homendy, Chair of the NTSB says it`s imperative to find out what went wrong and why.
 
HOMENDY:  We know what broke. We need to understand how it broke.
 
RODRIGUEZ:  A Boeing company source told CNN that Boeing believes the mistake is due to, quote, "The assembly that was built up through the 
 
 supply chain." This as the FAA grounded, most Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft as officials investigate the cause of the detached door plug, an incident 
 
 passengers on that flight won`t soon forget.
 
KELLY BARTLETT, PASSENGER ON ALASKA AIRLINES 1282:  It was just so scary when it happened, because you just hear that loud noise, and then the plane 
 
 filled with wind and the mask dropped and it was just something you don`t want to be experiencing on flight.

WIRE:  Now, let`s turn to the small democratic island country of Taiwan, which will hold presidential and parliamentary elections this week. It`s an 
 
 election that will be closely watched around the world, particularly by its communist neighbor, China, and even here in the United States. 
 
Now, there are a ton of specific details to this crucial election. So let`s head straight to our correspondent in the region Will Ripley, who explains 
 
 why this matters to those outside Taiwan`s borders.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  On Saturday, Taiwan votes for a new president term limits mean the current president sign, when 
 
 has to step down after eight years in power, two presidential terms. There is a lot at stake in this election. It`s being closely watched by the 
 
 Chinese Communist Party in Beijing and by U.S. lawmakers in Washington.
 
Beijing claims Taiwan as its own territory, despite having never controlled it. And it does not rule out the use of force to bring this island under 
 
 its fold at some point. Beijing, openly lows, the ruling party, the DPP, and they`re framing this election as a stark choice between war and peace, 
 
 prosperity and decline. 
 
From Taiwan`s perspective, the election will decide whether this island will continue to prioritize its relationship with the U.S. or perhaps 
 
 recalibrate that relationship and choose to mend ties with China. Given that Taiwan is the largest source of tension between China and the U.S., 
 
 which happens to be the Island`s main international backer and arms supplier. 
 
How China responds to the result of this election will be a big test. Can Beijing and D.C. manage tensions or will they move closer to confrontation 
 
 or even conflict? Why does this matter beyond the confines of Taiwan? Well, the location, of course, it`s important strategically for both China and 
 
 the United States being right there on the first island chain. 
 
Taiwan is the world`s number one manufacturer of semiconductors. Those priceless chips, that power all of our tech and the supply chain 
 
 disruptions for any cross-rate conflict would be catastrophic around the world. And from the U.S. perspective, Taiwan is a democracy and this 
 
 Island`s leaders have said that this election and this overall clash between China, the U.S. and Taiwan over democracy versus authoritarianism 
 
 could actually define the future of the free world.

WIRE:  Ten second trivia. 
 
In what year did scientists first theorize that burning fossil fuels would raise the Earth`s average temperature?
 
1855, 1896, 1930 or 1964?
 
If you said 1896, put your hands up. According to scientific American that`s when a Swedish scientist first argued that burning fossil fuels such 
 
 as coal could add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere leading to a rise in Earth`s average temperature.
 
2023 was the hottest year on record with the latest data showing that global warming hit 1.48 degrees Celsius. We are now extremely close to the 
 
 warming limit that nearly 200 countries sought to avoid when the Paris agreement was signed in 2015.  Our Bill Weir explains what this latest 
 
 report means.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT:  2023 has a lot of people felt it around the world, just was undeniable. Not only did it break previous 
 
 records, the hottest year ever in 2016, shattered them, obliterated them. Most Northern latitudes, you can see on the map there, up in Canada, there 
 
 are good three and four degrees warming, warming much faster than the rest of the world. So it is not even if we look at the global surface 
 
 temperatures going back 57 years, it goes back to 1967. My birth year, this is my life and temperature graphs here. And 2023, you can see how that bar 
 
 on the right is so much higher than anywhere else. 
 
Usually these records are broken by just hundreds of a degree because you`re talking about so much area, so much mass, so much time, but `23 was, 
 
 oh, deadly special in so many ways. And then as we look at the -- the, through the year as the temperatures bounced around that 1.5 line there, we 
 
 dipped above in March came back down. But as you can see the temperatures around the world hit that 1.5 threshold and stayed there for most of the 
 
 back end of the year. Even going above two degrees of global warming for a couple of days in November, that has never happened before for the first 
 
 time ever. You can lay 2023`s calendar over a calendar of `19 or 1850 to 1900. And every day was a full degree warmer than those before.

WIRE:  All right, let`s end this show on a high note, today`s story getting a 10 out of 10, a singing surgeon named Aicha N`doye, singing to her 
 
 patients in France because she says a soothing voice can help soothe the mind.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  At this hospital in the French city of Perdeaux, patients experience in the operating room may not be typical. Surgeon Aicha 
 
 N`doye suits patients with singing. She started doing it as an intern and a moment of desperation.
 
AICHA N`DOYE, OBSTETRIC GYNECOLOGIST (through translation):  We couldn`t get a patient to go to sleep, because she was totally agitated and wouldn`t 
 
 let herself be perfused. And so, as I was washing my hands, I thought maybe I`d try something. The last option we had was for me to sing. Wel, I sand 
 
 to the patient, which kind of captured her attention, so I was able to infuse her at the same time and put her to sleep. And since then, I`ve made 
 
 it an integral part of my work. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Aicha says that she hopes to inspire other surgeons to try her technique as there are many benefits for both patients and doctors.
 
N`DOYE (through translation):  When you fall asleep stressed, you consume more anesthetics. And as a result, with the singing they fall asleep more 
 
 calmly, and consume fewer "drugs." So it`s very beneficial for them. 
 
What`s more, the surgeons and anesthesiologists sometimes don`t get on very well, but now we get on very well when we work together, so frankly it`s 
 
 great, it`s a very, very good atmosphere.

WIRE:  Wow, that was beautiful from singing to patience, to singing some praises, a special shout out today to a school in a city, holding a special
