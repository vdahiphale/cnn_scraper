ISA SOARES, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST: A very warm welcome to the show everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, tensions are high in northern Kosovo as 
 
 protesters clash with NATO peacekeepers. I'll be speaking to Kosovo's prime minister in just a moment. Then, drone strikes hit both Kyiv and Moscow as 
 
 the Kremlin blamed Ukraine for the attacks inside Russia. 
 
Plus, artificial intelligence poses the risk of extinction. That is the warning from tech experts. We'll look at why they are sounding the alarm.  
 
But first, tonight NATO is deploying hundreds of additional troops to Kosovo after what it calls unacceptable and unprovoked attacks on its 
 
 peacekeepers there. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg addressed the violence just a short time ago, urging leaders of Kosovo and Serbia to de-escalate the 
 
 situation and refrain from quite further irresponsible behavior, but at least, 30 NATO peacekeepers were wounded on Monday after being attacked by 
 
 ethnic Serbian protesters who tried to storm a town hall and block ethnic Albanian mayors from taking office.  
 
The EU's foreign policy chief says the entire continent has a stake in defusing the crisis. Have a listen.

JOSEP BORRELL, HIGH REPRESENTATIVE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS &amp; SECURITY POLICY: It has been too much violence. We have too much 
 
 violence in Europe already today. We cannot afford another conflict.  
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
SOARES: Well, the clashes happen in a Serb majority area of northern Kosovo, Serbs there like Serbia as a whole do not recognize Kosovo's 
 
 independence. And last month, Serbia's president urged them to boycott local election, saying they should no longer accept what he called a 
 
 foreign occupation. Barbie Nadeau tells us how those elections triggered the latest unrest.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)   
 
BARBIE NADEAU, CNN CONTRIBUTOR (voice-over): A flare up in a tinderbox. More than 30 NATO peacekeepers injured in clashes with Serb protesters in 
 
 northern Kosovo Monday. Among them, several Italians and Hungarians. NATO has condemned the attacks, saying they were, quote, "totally unacceptable".  
 
The peacekeepers, known as KFOR have been present in this volatile region since 1999, in response to brutal ethnic cleansing of Albanians.  
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: U.N. Security Council passed a resolution -- 
 
NADEAU: A United Nations Security Council Resolution paved the way for Kosovo's independence from Serbia with NATO protecting the uneasy 
 
 transition.  
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
 
NADEAU: Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia in 2008, when the ethnic Albanian majority took over the country. But Serbia did not 
 
 recognize Kosovo as a sovereign nation nor do ethnic Serbs who live in the north of the country, where Monday's violence sparked.  
 
SERGEY LAVROV, FOREIGN MINISTER, RUSSIA (through translator): Nor does Russia, which has strongly backed Serbia over Kosovo.  
 
NADEAU: The latest tension comes after ethnic Serbs boycotted an election in the northern part of Kosovo in April, leading to ethnic Albanians 
 
 governing the region. Serbia claims the Kosovo government is goading Serbs to clash with NATO.  
 
ALEKSANDAR VUCIC, PRESIDENT, SERBIA (through translator): I am urging the Serbs in Kosovo not to get into a conflict with NATO, not because I am 
 
 afraid or because any of us are afraid, personally have anything to lose, but because that's what Kosovo's prime minister wants most.  
 
NADEAU: As peacekeepers stand guard inspection today, whether the protesters here listen, could determine whether relative peace returns to 
 
 the region or if Europe has another conflict on the horizon. Barbie Latza Nadeau, CNN, Rome. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE) 
 
SOARES: We want to get Kosovo's perspective on this very clearly tense situation that you saw there. We're joined now by the Prime Minister of 
 
 Kosovo, Albin Kurti, he's in Pristina tonight. 
 <br>[14:05:00] 
 
Prime Minister, thank you very much for taking the time to speak to us this evening. Tensions have been simmering now in the north for some time. Just 
 
 explain to our viewers, prime minister, if you could, why you decided to send police forces and police units to the north of the country. Why did 
 
 you feel that was necessary, sir?  
 
ALBIN KURTI, PRIME MINISTER, KOSOVO: On 5th of November last year, four mayors in the north, belonging to one Serbian political party, collectively 
 
 resigned. And in December, because security conditions were not in place, we decided to postpone early elections by four months. So finally, on 23rd 
 
 of April, we had them. The turnout was quite low because of the pressure, blackmail and threats from Belgrade to all Serbian citizens, and in 
 
 particular, those who were planning to run. 
 
And now, we have four mayors whose legitimacy is low, but nonetheless, there is no one who is more legitimate than them. We have to have rule of 
 
 law. We are a democratic republic, and we have to ensure that in the municipal buildings, which are property of the republic, there will be 
 
 these Kosovan mayors who have been elected. On the other hand, we are facing not peaceful protesters, we're facing a mob of extremists.  
 
We're facing ultra-nationalist right-wingers who are being paid and ordered from Belgrade, and who admire despotic President Putin. This is a fascist 
 
 militia who attacked our policemen and NATO soldiers, and journalists who were on the ground reporting there. Today is much calmer, because they did 
 
 not do attacks against our police and KFOR, but they nonetheless attacked a few journalists.  
 
I want to have peace and security, but I believe that democracy and rule of law is the way forward. It is not possible in municipal buildings, not to 
 
 have elected mayors. Power in Kosovo cannot be gained by shock bombs and by crimes and by violence, only by elections.  
 
SOARES: And sir, do you have any proof that those that are being sent, that those protests we were looking out there, some video which we're showing 
 
 our viewers, they did come from Serbia, they were sent by Serbia, the Putin allies. Do you have any of this evidence to show us?  
 
KURTI: We have dozens of video footages and photos which show Serbian militia being in the frontlines of violent mob, and these are the people 
 
 that we have identified that come from Serbia. Some of them also come from the north of Kosovo, but some of them come from Serbia. And we are a 
 
 democratic, pro-European republic.  
 
Our northern neighbor, Serbia, is a pro-Russian autocracy. So there is not much of democracy there. Even though they have elections, since they have 
 
 one party, one state, one leader, and they have ordered this so-called gerrymandering(ph), how they call them, to come and do riots in north of 
 
 Kosovo.  
 
SOARES: Let's talk about your 2013 agreement, because your predecessor, from what I understand, and correct me if I'm wrong here, prime minister, 
 
 agreed to establish an association of Serbian municipalities, where Serbs, of course, are the majority, can be represented. Well, ten years later, 
 
 this hasn't happened. Why has this not happened, sir?  
 
KURTI: We have an agreement now with Serbia. We call it basic treaty. President of Serbia and myself, under the auspices of High Representative 
 
 and VP Borrell and his special envoy for the Balkans, Lajcak, the text has 11 articles, six points in the preamble. We have an agreement. Part of this 
 
 agreement is also implementation of all previously-agreed deals of my predecessors.  
 
There are 39 altogether. Two of them relate to the Association of Serb Majority municipalities, which, however, did not pass the test of our 
 
 constitutional court, because it is framed within the spirit of territorial ethnonationalism. I want to have self-management of Serbian community, as 
 
 the article seven of our basic treaty says, I don't neglect, and I do not deny previously-agreed documents, but that's not the only one.  
 
We need a sequence implementation road map for the entire agreement that we have done in February this year.
 <br>[14:10:00]
 
SOARES: But do you, and then understand why Serbs boycotted the election, why they feel under represented?  
 
KURTI: We have Serbian communities in Kosovo which is 4 percent of population, 93 percent are Albanian, and the rest, 3 percent or other 
 
 minorities, Roma, Bosniak, Turks, Egyptians, Gorani, and we want to live in a multi-cultural society. But we cannot have a privileged minority, because 
 
 Belgrade is lamenting for loss of Kosovo in 1999, when NATO intervened to stop the genocide of regime of Milosevic. 
 
SOARES: You -- 
 
KURTI: So, Kosovo is a success story of NATO intervention. That is what bothers both Belgrade and Kremlin.  
 
SOARES: Borrell, Josep Borrell, who you mentioned there, prime minister, called on police to withdraw from their municipalities. Will you be 
 
 withdrawing police from these municipalities?  
 
KURTI: Police should be in few of them in each municipality, like in every municipality in our republic. There are 38 municipalities altogether. But 
 
 if there is a violent mob --  
 
SOARES: I'm talking about the north -- 
 
KURTI: Outside -- 
 
SOARES: I'm talking particularly about the north here -- 
 
KURTI: Yes, but -- 
 
SOARES: Where we have seen tensions -- 
 
KURTI: As long as there's -- 
 
SOARES: Continue to rise --  
 
KURTI: A mob, as long as there's a violent mob outside of the building, I cannot have only few police men. I need to have police who will defend rule 
 
 of law, who will keep the order, peace and security, and municipalities should be for everyone. Not only for parallel structures of Serbia turned 
 
 into criminal gangs -- especially recently.  
 
SOARES: And very quickly, Secretary Blinken tweeted, obviously, given what we have seen, the tensions escalating. He has called on you, I think, he 
 
 actually included you in this tweet, to halt what he calls these violent measures. "We strongly condemn the actions by the government of Kosovo that 
 
 are escalating tensions in the north and increasing instability, we call on the prime minister to immediately halt these violent measures."
 
What are you then, doing, sir, to stop this from escalating, if you're going to continue putting police on the ground in these municipalities?  
 
KURTI: All international bodies did recognize elections that we had. Once you recognize the process of elections and its results, then mayors have to 
 
 go to municipalities. Who else should be in this municipality buildings, if not the mayors? And I'm working closely with international factors, 
 
 especially with United States and European Union, we consider both of them indispensable allies, friends and partners. And we will do our best. But I 
 
 am not surrendering democratic republic to fascist militia.  
 
SOARES: Prime Minister Kurti, great to have you on the show, thank you very much sir. 
 
KURTI: Thank you. 
 
SOARES: Now, Serbian tennis star Novak Djokovic is using the international spotlight on the French Open to make a political statement on Kosovo, after 
 
 his first round victory on Monday. He wrote a message in Serbia -- in Serbian on a TV camera lens, reading "Kosovo is the heart of Serbia. Stop 
 
 the violence." Djokovic's father grew up in Zvecan; the town where the clashes took place. 
 
Djokovic says he is against violence of any kind, but felt compelled to publicly give his support to the Serbian people. Of course, stay on top of 
 
 that story for you. Well, the sun is setting in Ukraine, where the capital Kyiv is preparing for more airstrikes. The city has faced three straight 
 
 nights of attacks, and explosion tore across the sky in the early morning hours as air defenses took on the latest Russian barrage. 
 
It is the 17th time the capital has been attacked this month. This, as Russia reports Moscow is also under fire. Sam Kiley has the details now 
 
 from eastern Ukraine. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
 
(ARTILLERY FIRE) 
 
SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Same war, different capital. Moscow hit by a squadron of eight drones. "There was a 
 
 deafening bang, as if a huge bolt of lightning had struck somewhere near." The attack was immediately blamed on Ukraine, which reels daily from 
 
 Russian air assaults.  
 
SERGEI SHOIGU, DEFENSE MINISTER, RUSSIA (through translator): This morning, the Kyiv regime carried out a terrorist attack on the Moscow region, and I 
 
 will stress aimed at civilian targets. In total, eight aeroplane high drones were used, all of them were brought down.  
 
KILEY: Kyiv was coy about its role in this drastic escalation.  
 
MYKHAILO PODOLYAK, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENTIAL ADVISER (through translator): Of course, we enjoy watching and predicting an increase in attacks, but of 
 
 course, we have nothing to do directly with it. What is growing in Russia is the comic payment that Russia will gradually pay more highly for 
 
 everything it does in Ukraine.  
 
KILEY: Ukraine is threatening an offensive to drive Russian troops out. Part of its tactics have been increased efforts to destabilize Moscow's 
 
 forces.  
 <br>[14:15:00] 
 
A cross-border raid by anti-Putin Russian dissidents was backed by Ukraine last week. Frequent attacks on Russian-occupied logistic hubs like Mariupol 
 
 and Berdiansk, and now there's a mysterious drone attack that Russia has blamed on Ukraine.  
 
VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT, RUSSIA (through translator): Though, I am more worried, not by this, but by efforts to provoke a Russian response, that 
 
 appears to be the aim. They are provoking us to do the same.  
 
KILEY: But this is the first drone attack by anyone on Moscow outside the Kremlin.  
 
(ARTILLERY FIRE) 
 
Here, Kyiv attacked for the 17th time this month. Putin's generals now know that they face attacks on Ukraine's frontlines and at home.  
 
(END VIDEOTAPE) 
 
SOARES: Well, we are also hearing claims that new cross-border shelling in Russia's Belgorod region -- very busy day. Let's get the latest from CNN's 
 
 Sam Kiley in eastern Ukraine who just filed that report. And our former Moscow bureau chief Jill Dougherty is live for us in Washington. And Sam, 
 
 to you first. Ukraine from what I understand has denied direct involvement over what happened in Moscow.  
 
And it comes of course, on the heels of that cross-border incursion by anti-Putin groups that you and I spoke about. What has Kyiv been saying 
 
 about the drone attack on the Russian capital this evening?  
 
KILEY: Well, they're saying that they didn't have direct responsibility, which gives them a bit of wiggle room. It's a little bit like if I could 
 
 interpret here what they mean, well, they're not dismayed that it's happened, and we may yet discover that they had a hand on it -- a hand in 
 
 it, in the same way that those cross-border raids by the Russian dissidents, they are members of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.
 
They take their orders certainly when they're in Ukraine from the Ukrainians, and they indeed coordinate their actions across the border with 
 
 the Ukrainians. So this is part of that grey zone war that we're seeing in a sense pioneered by Russia in this region when it sent a covert operative 
 
 to grab Crimea back in 2014. That's being turned around now, I think in anticipation of the ground war here. 
 
So whether we're looking at the drone attacks in Moscow or cross-border raid, much closer to Ukraine in the Ukrainian northern border, what you're 
 
 looking at is destabilizing efforts against Russia ahead of this offensives.  
 
SOARES: Yes, and meantime, Jill, on that note, I mean, this clearly was meant to rattle and send a message of capability. But do we know or what 
 
 are you hearing from the Kremlin side? Do we know the origin of these drones? What is the Kremlin saying this evening?  
 
JILL DOUGHERTY, ADJUNCT PROFESSOR, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY: Well, they're obviously blaming it on Ukraine. I did note that President Putin did come 
 
 out. It was a kind of a brief interview. And essentially, what he was trying to do, I think is kind of tamp down any concern, and essentially he 
 
 said, you know, the air defenses in Moscow worked well, more could be done, but in essence, don't worry.
 
And this is, I think the quandary for Putin right now. Because obviously, just the fact that the drones hit, even if they didn't carry out a lot of 
 
 destruction is a bad sign for Putin. It undermines the idea that he's protecting Russian civilians, and that the war simply is going according to 
 
 plan. And that's the expression heard all the time from President Putin, according to plan. 
 
And yet, I think there's another side to this, obviously propaganda side is very big on both sides. But ultimately, if the Ukrainians are attacking 
 
 civilians, that creates kind of -- supports the idea from President Putin that, you know, the -- that's the objective. That it is wrong to hit 
 
 civilians, even though we know in Ukraine, Russia is hitting the civilians.  
 
SOARES: Yes, and I'm guessing Muscovites, Jill, would have been, you know, seriously rattled by this. I mean, how much -- you mentioned an 
 
 embarrassment perhaps for authorities. But is there a growing insecurity in the country given what has happened in the last few months?  
 
DOUGHERTY: Well, I mean, I think you have to say when it hits Moscow, it is a big deal.  
 
SOARES: Yes -- 
 
DOUGHERTY: And the area that the drone hits according to some of the reports that we're seeing, and have to be confirmed, but it appears to be 
 
 downtown, but also in the areas west of the city where the elites live. I mean, the major -- you know, officials in the Putin government live in that 
 
 area, so that's significant.  
 
And Putin even having to come out and say, don't worry, everything is under control, I think it's a sign of the concern.  
 <br>[14:20:00] 
 
Because these are people who just had a drone come into their area. That's very disturbing. The war wasn't supposed to be fought in Moscow, you know, 
 
 they wanted in Ukraine.  
 
SOARES: Yes, the war certainly coming closer to home. Jill Dougherty and Sam Kiley, thank you to you both, important context there. Well, the U.S. 
 
 debt ceiling deal is about to face its first major obstacle in the Capitol Hill. In about an hour from now, a House Rules Committee will decide 
 
 whether to send the bill to the house floor.
 
If it does pass, the full house is expected to vote on it on Wednesday. But many lawmakers on both sides of the aisle aren't happy with a deal. 
 
 Meanwhile, U.S. President Joe Biden and Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy are having to scramble to get support days, of course, before the 
 
 deadline has been pushed back to June 5th. Let's go to our Capitol Hill reporter Melanie Zanona. Melanie, first major hurdle, had it passed?  
 
MELANIE ZANONA, CNN CAPITOL HILL REPORTER: Yes, that is the question right now. And usually, the House Rules Committee is stacked full of allies of 
 
 leadership. But in his quest to become speaker, Kevin McCarthy made a deal to stack the committee with three hard-line conservatives, and two of them, 
 
 Chip Roy and Ralph Norman are already signaling that they're prepared to vote against the rule in committee. 
 
Now, all eyes are on that third Republican, his name is Thomas Massie, he's a conservative, he has not yet said how he plans to vote on the rule. We 
 
 did see him going into the speaker's office moments ago, he declined to comment on how he plans to vote. But the expectation, according to sources 
 
 is that, he will ultimately back the rule which will allow it to go to the house floor.  
 
Which means that they have cleared at least one hurdle. So that will be a big sigh of relief for Republican leaders. But as you mentioned, this is 
 
 only part of the battle. They still need to get this bill through the house floor. And there's opposition both on the far right and to the far left. 
 
 And in fact, a group of hard-line conservatives known as the House Freedom Caucus held a press conference early today, and they are trying to rally 
 
 opposition against the bill. Take a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
REP. CHIP ROY (R-TX): We will continue to fight it today, tomorrow, and no matter what happens, there's going to be a reckoning about what just 
 
 occurred unless we stop this bill by tomorrow. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
ZANONA: Now, Kevin McCarthy said he is still confident that he is going to be able to get this bill passed in the house, there's going to be 
 
 democratic support as well to make up for this affections on the right. But the other question is whether his speakership is safe, because 
 
 conservatives are already threatening to potentially try to force a vote on ousting him from the speakership. 
 
But again, Speaker Kevin McCarthy a little bit ago, telling reporters he's not worried about his speakership being in jeopardy. 
 
SOARES: Melanie Zanona, appreciate it, thank you very much. And still to come tonight, new details on a fatal boat capsizing in Italy. We'll tell 
 
 you about what we know about the victims. Plus, answering dissent with death. Iran resumes its execution of protesters. Those stories after this 
 
 short break. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 <br>[14:25:00] 
 
SOARES: Now, we are getting new details on the boat accident in northern Italy on Sunday that left four people dead, two victims were active Italian 
 
 Secret Service agents, a retired employee of the Israeli security forces and the boat captain's partner was also among the victims. Our Scott McLean 
 
 joins me now with more details that are coming in. And there are -- you know, we've got very few details here, Scott. So just talk us through what 
 
 you know, what you're hearing from authorities?  
 
SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, this is a very strange one. What we know is that Sunday night, a 16 meter, 52-foot long houseboat set sail on 
 
 Lake Maggiore, it's outside of Milan, it had 24 people on board, two of them were crew members, there were no official weather warnings at the 
 
 time, and yet, this boat managed to get swept up in what Italian media is describing as sort of out-of-the-blue water spout, and out-of-the-blue 
 
 funnel cloud causing it to capsize. 
 
And so, 20 survivors, some of them managed to reach shore, others were rescued, four bodies have been recovered. And as of this morning, the 
 
 priority was to try to get that boat off the bottom of the lake. Adding to the mystery, though, Is what you mentioned, which is that two of the 
 
 victims here were active Italian Secret Service agents, meaning they were intelligence officials.  
 
Another one, a third was a retired employee of the Israeli security forces, that's according to the foreign ministry there. Israeli ministry -- Israeli 
 
 media is also saying that look, this guy wasn't even supposed to be there at all. He was actually supposed to be on a flight, he missed it. That was 
 
 the only reason that he was on this boat in the first place.  
 
The investigation, because of the involvement in these Secret Service agents is now also involving the military police in Italy, because it may 
 
 involve state secrets. The captain of the boat is also under investigation, the captain's girlfriend was killed actually -- 
 
SOARES: Why is the investigation because of too many people in this boat -- 
 
MCLEAN: Exactly, casting, the boat was 16 -- 
 
SOARES: Yes -- 
 
MCLEAN: There was 24 on board. What other thing to mention in that is about the weather. And that is that, there was no official warning. But what 
 
 there was at the time was a watch. Which meant -- which means that essentially that there could be high winds, there could be heavy rains, but 
 
 it's not like this is definitely going to happen. 
 
It's just kind of -- more like a beware, more of a yellow warning than a blinking red warning. And so, it turns out there was lightning spotted in 
 
 the area, there was heavy rain, there was severe wind, but again, this was not an official warning because they didn't know a 100 percent that it was 
 
 going to happen. But obviously, there was this storm system coming through --  
 
SOARES: So, perhaps, an accident? It's very early to tell.  
 
MCLEAN: Yes, I mean, it doesn't seem at this point that the prosecutor is investigating anything other than the fact that the boat was overloaded, 
 
 what happened beyond that, obviously, we don't know the specific circumstances other than the weather was not good.  
 
SOARES: I know you'll stay on top of it, thank you very much, Scott -- 
 
MCLEAN: Yes -- 
 
SOARES: I appreciated it. Well, staying on secret agents. An alleged Russian spy has reached Swedish waters, and it isn't human. This same 
 
 Beluga whale had made headlines in 2019 for being spotted with a harness off the coast of Norway. A nonprofit tracking its movement said he recently 
 
 left Sweden after spending time near Oslo. It's thanking Sweden for caring for the whale and even closing a bridge to protect it. 
 
And still to come tonight, Iran's execution machine grinds back into action. Three more protesters have lost their lives at the hands of the 
 
 government this month. And more are at risk. We'll bring you that story. Plus, renewed outrage over violence against women in India after a teenage 
 
 girl was stabbed and bludgeoned to death in public. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 <br>[14:30:00]
 
(MUSIC PLAYING)
 
SOARES: Welcome back, everyone.
 
Demonstrators in Iran have eased since late last year. But authorities there are not giving an inch to anyone showing dissent. Human rights groups 
 
 say the government has begun executing protesters once again. Salma Abdelaziz has the details for you. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN REPORTER (voice-over): Outside of jail near Tehran, families of prisoners gathered chant, "Do not hang them." 
 
Their pleas come as Iran resumes the execution of protesters after a months-long hiatus. 
 
The brutal practice restarted this month with the hanging of three young men accused of killing three members of the security forces during 
 
 antigovernment protests in November.
 
The news sparked more demonstrations. But activist and human rights groups say the allegations against the trio are baseless.
 
Majid Kazemi was forced to watch video of interrogators torturing his brother and he was subjected to at least 15 mock executions according to 
 
 Amnesty International.
 
In an audio note obtained by the organization, he maintained his innocence. CNN cannot independently verify the clip.
 
"They kept beating me and ordering me to say, 'This weapon is mine,'" he says. 
 
"I told them I would say whatever they wanted, just please leave my family alone."
 
Before his execution, the family of 36-year-old Saleh Mirhashemi, a karate coach from Isfahan, tried to draw attention to his plight. This picture of 
 
 his father spread on social media. 
 
"My son is innocent," the sign reads.
 
But to no avail, activists shared this heartbreaking video they say is Mirhashemi's dad, hugging his picture as he lay by his son's grave.
 
Iran has not responded to CNN's request for comment.
 
The total number of demonstrators known to have been executed since last year now stands at seven, according to CNN reporting and more executions 
 
 are likely imminent.
 
"Over 100 protesters have been sentenced to death or are facing charges punishable by death," says this human rights activist.
 
MAHMOOD AMIRY-MOGHADDAM, DIRECTOR, IRAN HUMAN RIGHTS NGO: When authorities fear protests or right after protests, number of executions go up. The aim 
 
 is to create fear in the society to prevent more protests.
 
ABDELAZIZ: Do you expect that the number of executions is going to rise even more this year?
 
AMIRY-MOGHADDAM: It is rising already. Unless the international community takes strong move against these executions, we might be facing a very large 
 
 number of executions in the coming months.
 
ABDELAZIZ (voice-over): Rights groups say that Mohammad Ghobadlou, a 22- year-old protester with a mental health issue, could be one of the next victims of Iran's execution machine.
 <br>[14:35:00]
 
ABDELAZIZ (voice-over): Activists are ringing the alarm. They say yet another Iranian faces death just for daring to speak out -- Salma

SOARES: In India, a 16 year old girl was brutally murdered in public Sunday, in a busy alleyway. All of it caught on security camera, including 
 
 people walking by and doing absolutely nothing to help her. CNN's Vedika Sud reports the incident is reigniting outrage over violence against women 
 
 in India, which has become all too commonplace. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
VEDIKA SUD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Surveillance video catches a Delhi street on Sunday evening. What the man in blue is about to do is too 
 
 violent to be shown. In the next moment, a 16-year-old girl's life is taken. Stabbed and bludgeoned with a rock against the wall of her house. 
 
 Witnesses passed by but no one intervenes. 
 
SUD: Violence against women is so pervasive in India that a young girl can be stabbed in public in a busy neighborhood, against the wall of her home. 
 
SUD (voice-over): The killing of this teenage girl is the latest in a long line of violent crimes against women in India. This time, it's on film. 
 
She had rapidly online and it has gripped the nation. The man in blue has been arrested for the murder and named by police. Simply Asahil (ph). They 
 
 say the two were in a relationship and had an argument shortly before the killing. 
 
The family pleading for justice, even as across India, demands grow to do more to protect women and punish their male attackers. But public anger is 
 
 no comfort to a family stricken by grief at the loss of their child.

SOARES: Just horrific. 
 
In Mississippi, the mother of an 11 year old boy wrongfully shot by police has filed a federal lawsuit on her son's behalf. The suit seeks $5 million 
 
 and was filed against the city of (INAUDIBLE) as the police chief and the officers involved in Aderrien Murry's shooting. 
 
He was shot, if you remember, early this month, after he called 9-1-1, trying to get help for his mother in a domestic disturbance. He suffered 
 
 fractured ribs and a lacerated liver and was put on a ventilator after his lung collapsed. He was released from the hospital last week but trauma from 
 
 the incident is still playing out for him.

ADERRIEN MURRY, POLICE SHOOTING VICTIM: Sometimes I can see myself laying inside the coffin. Those are my thoughts at night, my only ones. And 
 
 sometimes, I think people are watching me. But my main thought is me dead.

SOARES: A strong little boy. 
 
The officer involved in the shooting is on paid administrative leave while the incident is being investigated. We will stay on top of that story for 
 
 you. 
 
And still to come tonight, China launches its first civilian astronaut into space, with an eye on expanding its space program. We'll have the details 
 
 for you next. 
 
Plus South American leaders are gathering for the first time since 2015 as Brazil's president tries to revive a regional union.

SOARES: A Chinese mission launched to its space station has arrived. It has been called a complete success. A crew of three astronauts from China 
 
 reached the country's space station after this morning's launch. This is China's first space mission with a civilian astronaut been on board. 
 
Despite protests from its neighbors, North Korea says it will launch its first military spy satellite next month. According to state media, the 
 
 launch is in response to dangerous military acts from the United States and South Korea. 
 
Meanwhile, Japan has warned Pyongyang it will use extreme force if the North Korean missile lands in its territory. 
 
About a dozen South American leaders are meeting in the Brazilian capital right now. It is their first regional summit in nearly a decade. Brazil's 
 
 president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is trying to coordinate with his counterparts on issues like climate, as well as the economy. 
 
He had been part of a previous attempt for regional cooperation, the first time he led Brazil. He's now calling for a common currency within the trade 
 
 bloc. I want to bring in journalist Stefano Pozzebon with more on this. 
 
Stefano, while there's a lot of discussion on what policy, what can be achieved, the attention has focused on Lula rolling out the red carpet for 
 
 Nicolas Maduro.
 
How has that been received?
 
STEFANO POZZEBON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, it's fair to say that the meeting itself was overshadowed by Maduro's presence. The meeting was meant to show 
 
 a signal that Brazil is back. Brazil, because of the size of its economy, the country itself aims to be a leader in South America. 
 
Lula, as the most popular and most known president among those who are attending the summit in Brasilia aims to be the leader. But the summit was 
 
 overshadowed by Maduro's presence. 
 
It's the first time that we are seeing Maduro in a high level regional summit, back to the forefront of diplomacy since the 2019 Venezuelan 
 
 constitutional crisis and the violent cycle of protests and repression that followed. It's a little bit like Bashar al-Assad two weeks ago, being 
 
 invited to the Arab League summit. 
 
And seeing these authoritarian leaders and strongmen back at the center of the international conversation, it has drawn a lot of scrutiny, especially 
 
 because of the remarks that Lula himself gave while welcoming Maduro. 
 
He talked about prejudice against Venezuela and even said there is a constructed narrative against the Venezuelan government, notwithstanding 
 
 that Maduro and his human rights abuse and his government have committed. Isa.
 
SOARES: There is no constructive narrative, that we know. You've covered and I've covered it. It's a brutal dictatorship, the U.N. has recognized 
 
 that. And Lula may say, I'm just giving him legitimacy.
 <br>[14:45:00]
 
SOARES: But let's focus on the other areas of policy here. Lula now calling for a common currency here. Not the first time, Stefano, that we've heard 
 
 of this idea. 
 
POZZEBON: No.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
POZZEBON: I've been here seven years and I think this is already the third time that someone tells me that South America should have a common 
 
 currency. Of course, it is -- it will happen, maybe, in the future. It took 60 years to get the European Union to get everyone on board with the euro. 
 
And thankfully, we know the success that the European currency is in Europe. But here in South America, the road is far away before 
 
 accomplishing this objective. 
 
We have asked the U.S. Department of State about Maduro's presence. They say that they will get back to us and of course lots of scrutiny. Just 
 
 before you let me go, I want to give you an opinion from a good friend, who is a journalist in Venezuela, who told me this morning to deconstruct the 
 
 narrative, we must reconstruct democracy before. 
 
So I think that's a good way to describe what is happening right now. 
 
SOARES: And for that, you need elections, free and fair elections in Venezuela. Thank you very much, Stefano. We appreciate it. Thank you very 
 
 much. 
 
As Lula da Silva tries to focus on diplomacy, he's facing domestic issues, too.

SOARES (voice-over): Bow and arrow versus tear gas. You can see indigenous groups facing off against riot police on the highway leading into Sao 
 
 Paulo. Indigenous people protesting this week against legislation that they fear would end protections of some ancestral land. 
 
The bill is designed to end land conflicts between the groups.

SOARES: Still to come tonight, warnings of human annihilation. It sounds like something out of a sci-fi novel. We'll have more on what has tech 
 
 leaders worried next.

SOARES: Leaders, academics and even celebrities are arguing that artificial intelligence could lead to extinction. They have signed a statement calling 
 
 for AI regulation --
 <br>[14:50:00]
 
SOARES: -- putting the threat up there with global pandemics and nuclear wars. They say it should be a top global priority. 
 
While society is still a long way from the AI we see in science fiction and movies, these leaders are pushing for checks before any major mishaps 
 
 occur. I want to bring in the president of the Future of Life Institute, Max Tegmark, who created the first open letter about AI regulation, back in 
 
 March. 
 
Max, great to have you on the show. Such an important conversation. And one in fact that we've been having for quite some time here on the show. We 
 
 have been seeing more calls for regulation, for more checks and balances. Talk us through what you believe is needed. 
 
MAX TEGMARK, PRESIDENT, FUTURE OF LIFE INSTITUTE: Yes, many people including myself have warned for a long time that there's a risk of 
 
 extinction if we lose control of entities much smarter than us.
 
What's really new today is that this is being mainstreamed. We have the CEOs of DeepMind, OpenAI, top researchers saying, yes, extinction is a 
 
 thing and we should all feel safe talking about it. 
 
The first thing that's needed frankly is precisely to give everybody else the confidence to join this conversation without fear of getting mocked or 
 
 dismissed. 
 
The U.S. Senate hearings we had just the other week, you can tell that no politicians asked about extinction because they were afraid of face 
 
 planting, of making fools of themselves like some politicians did when they interviewed Mark Zuckerberg. 
 
Now we can actually start talking about it for real. And figure out what we need to do to avoid these problems. 
 
We are talking about it for real now.
 
SOARES: But governments might not be doing enough. 
 
So why are governments opposed to this?
 
Why the complacency, given the warnings we have been hearing for some time now?
 
TEGMARK: Well, part of it is what you said at the beginning. The perception that very powerful AI is still very far off. Everybody used to think that 
 
 until quite recently. Maybe 50 years off or so. 
 
Now it's increasingly clear that it could happen very soon. Artificial general intelligence, which is definitely the stuff that sci-fi movies were 
 
 made out of, we may get it later this year. We may get it in two years. Microsoft itself has a paper out, talking about sparks of artificial 
 
 general intelligence. 
 
Now of course, it's pretty obvious that we might go extinct if we lose control of this, to more intelligent entities because that is exactly what 
 
 happened to about half of Earth's species so far, that we humans have driven extinct. They couldn't prevent it, because we humans were smarter 
 
 than them. 
 
And we don't want to put humanity in that same situation. It's all about control.
 
How can we make sure that humanity doesn't lose control of what we've built?
 
And biology has to figure out how to solve it. So that's the good news. 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
SOARES: Let's talk about control. Given the pace that we've seen of progress, we've seen essays being written by ChatGPT; photos, we have a 
 
 photo of the pope in a puffer jacket. That was fabricated. And so many other examples, of course. 
 
How then do you regulate it?
 
Where do you start?
 
TEGMARK: Those are all great and very important things-- job loss, disinformation, fakes. But we should also keep our eye on the fact that we 
 
 might actually lose control entirely by doing things that are too risky. 
 
So what I think we need to do is look at how biotech has handled this. And biotech companies have to prove to government experts that their stuff is 
 
 safe before they can release it. 
 
And that is how it needs to become in AI as well. Instead of the way it is today, when companies can do more or less whatever they want and then 
 
 regulators play catch-up. 
 
SOARES: And, Max, I was hearing something from Eric Schmidt. I think we've got enough time to play it. But he doesn't believe that AI Is inherently 
 
 good or bad. Have a listen to this. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ERIC SCHMIDT, FORMER CHAIR AND CEO, GOOGLE: AI itself is an extraordinary achievement. The development of an AI doctor and an AI tutor and so forth 
 
 will raise intelligence capabilities all around the world. 
 
So please don't hear that this is a reason to stop or whatever. We just have to manage it. When electricity showed up, people understood it was 
 
 dangerous. Thank God, they didn't stop electricity. They just figured out a way to live with it. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SOARES: Do you agree, Max?
 
It is about managing it. 
 <br>[14:55:00]
 
TEGMARK: AI Is a tool, it's not evil. And it's not morally good. It's up to us to make sure we use it for the good things. But we can't just tell the 
 
 companies to go away and self regulate. 
 
The reason that the CEOs of these companies themselves signed this and said, yes, this could drive us extinct, is because they are calling for 
 
 help from society to level the playing field and make sure that they all have safety standards in place. 
 
No company, no matter how good hearted their leaders are, can pause alone and just have their lunch eaten by the competition. And what's so great 
 
 about taking extinction seriously, is it really changes the incentives entirely. 
 
For the first time, even China and the West now have exactly the same incentives, to make sure everything is safe and that humanity stays in 
 
 control. It doesn't matter if you're Chinese or British or American once you're extinct. We're on the same team here. 
 
SOARES: Indeed. It's really great to get your perspective and insight. Thanks very, much Max. 
 
TEGMARK: Thank you. 
 
SOARES: And that does it for us for tonight. Thank you very much for your company. Stay right here, "QUEST MEANS BUSINESS" is up after the short 
 
 break and I will see you tomorrow. Have a wonderful day, goodbye.
