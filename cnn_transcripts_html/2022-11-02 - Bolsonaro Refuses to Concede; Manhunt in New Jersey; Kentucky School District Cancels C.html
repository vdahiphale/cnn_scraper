THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
<br>[06:30:00] 
 
BIANCA NOBILO, CNN ANCHOR CORRESPONDENT: It's tacit approval of what the protesters are doing. 
 
And as what Max was saying, some of the language so close to what we heard from former President Donald Trump. For example, his son, Bolsonaro's son, said they're expecting the greatest election fraud in their history. And that was a few days ago. 
 
POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR: Yes.
 
NOBILO: So you can see the parallels in the rhetoric there. 
 
And, of course, as we often see with strong men leaders, and those that have qualities of them, there is this us and them populist narrative, which Bolsonaro has been perpetuating through all of this. 
 
DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR: Well, that's the thing -
 
KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN ANCHOR: Yes, the reason this matters -
 
LEMON: Hang on. I just want to ask, that's a thing of violence. The violence here, that's the issue because we saw what happened at the Capitol on January 6th. When you look at the violence in the streets, you're right, it is tacit and it does mimic what happened here in the United States. It is important for officials, whether it's here in the United States or wherever, to concede elections. That's the important stuff (ph). 
 
COLLINS: Well, and that's why it matters that he's, as Max noted, you know, he's not conceding, he's not contesting it -
 
LEMON: Right.
 
COLLINS: By that silence matters because, as what you just saw there, that video, those are Bolsonaro's own supporters protesting by blocking the roads. And it's causing so many issues. 
 
NOBILO: And the other element of that, Kaitlan, is the fact that it is tradition in Brazilian politics, as it is in most democracies, for the person who's unsuccessful in the election to call the winner and officially concede. So that is actually part of the peaceful transfer of power. And that notably has not happened. 
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT: And he has called for his protesters not to be violent.  He's saying that's something of the left. But, as you're saying, you know, those scenes are playing out. 
 
HARLOW: Yes.
 
You know, just to bring this home, I mean they call him the Trump - many call him the Trump of the tropics, right, for the reason that you noted, Bianca. But just take it home to the people. The Brazilian people are suffering. They have been suffering for so many years under Bolsonaro's, you know, power. And the inflation is out of control. There is such extensive poverty. So, this matters deeply for Brazilians what happens and if Lula coming back into power can actually turn things around, as he's promised. 
 
FOSTER: Well, the chance for him is this, you know, completely disunited country -
 
HARLOW: Right.
 
FOSTER: And two very clear sides to the debate. And it's left and it's right. And Lula's somehow got to bring -- unite people. And that's going to be a huge challenge. 
 
HARLOW: Yes.
 
NOBILO: I think when you have an election result where the difference between the two main parties is only 1.8 percent and they are on completely opposite ends of the political spectrum -
 
HARLOW: Right.
 
NOBILO: It's, obviously, going to deepen and stir division. 
 
LEMON: Yes. 
 
COLLINS: Fair point.
 
LEMON: Thank you both. I appreciate it. Max and Bianca.
 
It's interesting. I think one of these leaders take cues from each other, right? Obviously, a lot of them are taking cues from what happened here in the United States and President Trump. 
 
COLLINS: Yes, many transitions happening around the world we're having -- watching what's happening in Israel as well very closely. 
 
LEMON: Yes.
 
There is a manhunt in Newark, New Jersey, that we need to get to now for a suspect who shot two police officers who were trying to arrest him. 
 
HARLOW: Also, what you need to know before having that second drink to help you unwind maybe in the evening after work. We've got new details. 
 
LEMON: Oh, boy. Wow.
 
COLLINS: Well, bad for us.
 
LEMON: Did you say that doesn't apply to us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[06:37:23]
 
HARLOW: Welcome back to CNN THIS MORNING. We're so glad you're with us this morning. 
 
It is the bottom of the hour. Time for more news.
 
Let's get to the domestic beat. 
 
Our colleague, Brynn Gingras, is here.
 
Good morning, Brynn.
 
BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, hey, guys, good morning.
 
A suspect remains at large after two New Jersey police officers were shot attempting to make an arrest. This happened in Newark last night. Authorities searched an apartment building where they thought Kendall Howard was hiding but police couldn't find him. One of the officers was shot in the leg, the other was shot in the shoulder. The bullet grazing his neck. Both are in stable condition.
 
In Kentucky, at least one school district outside Lexington is canceling classes for a week, writing on Facebook this, the Powell County Schools will be closed due to illness through the evening of November 8th. We'll resume school after Election Day, the morning of November 9th.
 
And it could be a billion-dollar night. So, get your tickets. The Powerball jackpot has climbed to $1.2 billion after no one matched the winning numbers in Monday night's drawing. 
 
And, guys, I would ask you, are you going to quit your jobs if you win? 
 
HARLOW: No. 
 
COLLINS: Yes.
 
GINGRAS: But that's not an option. 
 
HARLOW: We just started yesterday. 
 
LEMON: Well (ph) -
 
COLLINS: Well, if I don't show up on Thursday, you'll know why. It's because I left at 9:01 a.m. this morning and bought a ticket. 
 
HARLOW: No, no, no.
 
LEMON: You mean - you mean we left. 
 
HARLOW: You would miss us. 
 
COLLINS: I would share. 
 
HARLOW: You would miss us, Kaitlan. 
 
LEMON: Yes.
 
COLLINS: I would come by as a guest. 
 
HARLOW: Come on.
 
GINGRAS: (INAUDIBLE).
 
COLLINS: I'd come by as Dr. Tara. I'd stop in and say hi. 
 
HARLOW: Thank you, Brynn. 
 
LEMON: Thank you, Brynn. Really appreciate that. 
 
COLLINS: Thanks, Brynn.
 
HARLOW: OK, a glass of wine or a beer after work is a pretty common way for people to unwind. A new study just published, though, might make you think twice about pouring yourself that second drink. 
 
Joining us now, CNN medical correspondent Dr. Tara Narula.
 
LEMON: Good morning.
 
HARLOW: You have said -
 
DR. TARA NARULA, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Good morning.
 
LEMON: Wait, wait, wait, wait, what?
 
HARLOW: What? 
 
COLLINS: What? 
 
LEMON: Wait, what?
 
NARULA: This is not what you want to hear, right?
 
LEMON: Do you know how stressful people's lives are now? 
 
NARULA: Yes.
 
COLLINS: Yes.
 
HARLOW: What's the deal? NARULA: Well, for thousands - for thousands of centuries we've been consuming what the Greeks called the nectar of the gods. But that nectar may have problems when drunk in excess.
 
So, what we know is that excess alcohol use is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. In fact, it is a leading, preventable cause of premature death and death rates for alcohol- attributable causes have been going up for the past decade. 
 
So, researchers here looked at alcohol consumption from 2015 to 2019 in U.S. adults and they found that one in eight deaths in those 20 to 64 were attributable to alcohol, excessive alcohol, OK. One in five deaths in those 20 to 49 were also attributable to excessive alcohol consumption. And it was higher in men than women. It varied across states. So highest in New Mexico, lowest in Mississippi. In general, the southeast had lower rates and the west, upper Midwest, New England higher rates. 
 
HARLOW: OK.
 <br>[06:40:02]
 
NARULA: And when we're talking about what are these causes. So, we're talking about poisoning, motor vehicle accidents. By poisoning we mean substance used with alcohol. Motor vehicle accidents and alcohol related liver disease. 
 
COLLINS: So -
 
LEMON: Where's it higher? Well, I'm sorry. Where was it higher again?
 
NARULA: So it's higher in the west, the upper Midwest and New England. The southeast had lower rates. 
 
LEMON: OK.
 
COLLINS: So what - you're talking about excessive use. 
 
NARULA: Correct.
 
COLLINS: What is - what is that defined by? What's the acceptable use? 
 
NARULA: Right. And so there's a lot of debate about, you know, is it safe to drink at all? And, really, there's not a lot of great what we call randomized controlled trials on this topic. But what we generally say is that if you drink moderately, that that's technically for many considered safe. And by moderate let's define that. So we're talking about, at most, one glass a day for women, two glasses a day for men. And when we're talking about the types, it's about 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, 1.5 ounces of hard liquor. 
 
Now, there has been some association with moderate drinking and lower risk of cardiovascular disease. On the other hand, you have to weigh that with the cancer risk. We know that there's increased risk of cancer. So, there is some debate there. We definitely don't tell people to
 
 start drinking if they're not drinking. But if you keep it at that moderate level it may be OK. 
 
LEMON: That's just interesting because we have just such a natural acceptance of alcohol in our society and our relationship to it. 
 
NARULA: Right.
 
LEMON: And maybe we need to rethink that. We started, you know, when marijuana became more acceptable and more main stream and it seems like the benefits of maybe moderate marijuana use may be better than moderate alcohol use. I think that we need to start thinking about that. 
 
NARULA: We should be mindful how we use alcohol. 
 
LEMON: We need to be mindful. Absolutely. 
 
Thank you, Doctor Narula. We appreciate it. 
 
HARLOW: Thanks, Doctor.
 
NARULA: Thank you.
 
LEMON: Straight ahead, Charles Barkley calling Brooklyn Nets star Kyrie Irving, I'm quoting him here, an idiot. And he has some choice words for the NBA as well. 
 
COLLINS: A Charles Barkley quote is getting some attention?
 
LEMON: Yes.
 
COLLINS: I'm shocked.
 
If you ever wondered how much your colleagues are getting paid if you live in New York City, like the three of us, you might be able to find out very soon. 
 
LEMON: I'm looking at you two. I'm looking at you two.
 
COLLINS: Thank you. That's --
 
LEMON: Or you three, I should say, Doctor. 
 
COLLINS: It's really great seeing you.
 
HARLOW: It's OK. Still, it's nice to do (ph) a quick question. That was great.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[06:46:10]
 
LEMON: Do you ever wonder - do you ever wonder just how much your best friend makes? HARLOW: Never. Never.
 
LEMON: Really? Really? 
 
COLLINS: I feel like my friends are pretty open to talk about what they make. 
 
LEMON: Why'd you look at me? 
 
HARLOW: Well, that's so -- I did not look - who you looking at?
 
LEMON: A new law in New York may let you in on that secret. It requires employers to post salary ranges for job listings. So, here's how - this - how one New York City council member who sponsored the bill describes it. Listen to this. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JUSTIN BRANNAN, NEW YORK CITY COUNCIL MEMBER: The fact that you'd apply for a job not knowing what the salary range is, is just insane. It's critical to both our economy and to gender and racial justice. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
LEMON: So, some companies have already started updating their listings in New York City and beyond really. 
 
So, joining me now, CNN business and politics correspondent Vanessa Yurkevich.
 
Good morning to you. 
 
VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS AND POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning.
 
LEMON: Thank you very much for that. 
 
Listen, I guess, really, what is the point? Is it equity? Is it -- what's the point? 
 
YURKEVICH: Absolutely. Equity, trying to get women on par with men in terms of salaries. This law says that if you are a company with four or more employees and one of them works in New York City, you must post salary ranges for any job that you're looking to fill in New York City. It exempts temp firms. 
 
But the key here is that if you do not post a salary, companies can be fined $250,000. So this is really trying to get companies to do good due diligence and really explaining to people what this job is worth. 
 
COLLINS: It - it -- you said it applies to companies with one - or with four or more employees. But I imagine larger companies will be able to do this a lot faster than smaller companies will be able to. Is there a disparity there? 
 
YURKEVICH: Potentially it's -- for larger companies they may be able to auto generate this really quickly in their ads online. But for a smaller company who maybe has a flyer that they're posting in the neighborhood, they still have to post that salary range but it may be harder for them to sort of get on board with this. 
 
But it's important to note that there is a wide range of salaries that are being offered right now. Big -- sort of what they're calling good faith salaries that they have to abide by. 
 
HARLOW: All right.
 
LEMON: I have so many questions for you, but go - (INAUDIBLE). 
 
YURKEVICH: OK. Go ahead. Go ahead.
 
HARLOW: Hello.
 
YURKEVICH: Hi.
 
HARLOW: This matters is because -
 
YURKEVICH: Yes.
 
HARLOW: Women, minorities -
 
YURKEVICH: Yes.
 
HARLOW: Often are paid less than their white male counterparts or their male counterparts. This is just a reality. It just still persists.
 
YURKEVICH: Eighty-three cents to the dollar. 
 
HARLOW: I remember when Marc Benioff at Salesforce went in like five, six years ago, he was alerted at the company, women are making less. He went in. They did a huge audit of the whole company. And he came to the press. I sat down with him. He's like, we were wrong. I was wrong. We are fixing this. 
 
COLLINS: Wow.
 
HARLOW: But unless you do that -
 
YURKEVICH: Yes.
 
HARLOW: You end up with this. 
 
This is why it matters. And I love that Kaitlan said she talks to her friends about what they make. Women need to do that more and more and more and more. 
 
YURKEVICH: A lot of people don't, though. 
 
HARLOW: Right.
 
YURKEVICH: A lot of people don't. And this will really try to put men, women, and especially women of color who are known to make less - HARLOW: Yes.
 
YURKEVICH: Than all of the above sort of to just put it on paper, to put it on paper for people and hopefully give people a better sense of what they're worth and what their colleagues are worth. 
 
LEMON: Everything you said is true. OK. But not everybody in the same job performance the same. 
 
YURKEVICH: True. 
 
LEMON: So, it is nuanced here. You know, should a -- someone who is just an average player -- I'm just using - you know, be paid as much as LeBron James or -
 
YURKEVICH: Well, that's why you have this range. 
 
LEMON: So, you understand what I'm saying? 
 
YURKEVICH: There's a huge range. 
 
LEMON: So, it is - there is nuance. And, yes, typically women and people of color get paid less than white men, but not everybody is a great performer, and your salary - I think in some ways your salary needs to reflect that. 
 
HARLOW: That's a good point. 
 
LEMON: Let's just - let's just put up some of the current job. 
 
YURKEVICH: Yes.
 
LEMON: This is (INAUDIBLE).
 
YURKEVICH: Yes. So we did a little job search -
 
HARLOW: Yes. OK.
 
YURKEVICH: In New York City in the last two days because this law took effect here in New York City November 1st. So, we saw that a Macy's sale associate, $15 to $34 an hour. American Express, $55,000 to $105,000 a year. And then we looked at our own company, Warner Brothers Discovery, who owns CNN, big salary range, $137,000 to $254,000. 
 <br>[06:50:04]
 
If you notice that the minimum salary and then look at the maximum salary. The max is actually double the minimum. So, it's a huge range. And maybe some of what you're taking about plays into that skill set, age, et cetera. 
 
HARLOW: Yes.
 
YURKEVICH: But, you know, it's a - it's a big range. 
 
HARLOW: This is what bonuses are for. Big bonuses. 
 
YURKEVICH: Yes. This doesn't include bonus. 
 
LEMON: (INAUDIBLE) not everybody gets a bonus. So, not everybody is in that position. 
 
HARLOW: Right No, absolutely - absolutely not. A lot of -- I was talking about the NBA players. 
 
Well, I don't get a bonus. I was talking about the NBA players. 
 
YURKEVICH: Not any more.
 
HARLOW: This was -
 
LEMON: To be continued. 
 
COLLINS: (INAUDIBLE).
 
HARLOW: This was fascinating, Vanessa. Thank you very, very much. 
 
LEMON: Thank you.
 
YURKEVICH: You're welcome.
 
HARLOW: OK, so, pro-sports --
 
LEMON: Speaking of, yes. 
 
HARLOW: Speaking of the NBA. Players pro-sports have seen quite a few incidents of cheating in recent years. Our Dr. Sanjay Gupta joins us to discuss, why do we cheat? 
 
LEMON: Yes. What, cheating in sports? 
 
HARLOW: I didn't know people do that.
 
LEMON: What?
 
COLLINS: Yes, I'm not sure if he'll be able to answer that. 
 
Plus, voters in Arizona are feeling intimidated, they say, by armed patrols that are happening at ballot boxes, like the one you see here. We have a report on the right-wing group that is behind what you're seeing. That's up next. 
 
LEMON: Yes, that should not be allowed to happen. Look at that. You -- anyone would be intimidated. 
 
COLLINS: (INAUDIBLE) feel like a regular person can go vote. It looks crazy. 
 
HARLOW: Of course. Of course it does.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We got weights in fish. Get the (EXPLETIVE DELETED) out of here! Get the (EXPLETIVE DELETED) out of here! 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
LEMON: I remember that, Kaitlan. (INAUDIBLE).
 
COLLINS: Everybody remembers that moment, of course. It was the last time you saw a fishing tournament go viral, except for the one that I was in at nine years old. 
 
LEMON: Wait.
 
HARLOW: For real? 
 
COLLINS: Here - yes, I have a picture. I'll bring it. 
 
HARLOW: Oh, gosh.
 
COLLINS: My fish was like two pounds. No weights inside of it.
 
Anyway, a pair of competitive fishermen were disqualified from an Ohio tournament recently when organizers found that they had stuffed their fish with these lead weights. 
 
LEMON: Yes.
 
COLLINS: The alleged cheating has also rocked the world of chess. This is something I was personally fascinated by. The American Grand Master, Hans Niemann, filed a defamation lawsuit against the world champion, accusing him of colluding with others to try to ruin his career. 
 
And, of course, if -- we cannot forget the Houston Astros, who are currently duking it out with the Phillies in the World Series, as they did last night, if you stayed up late. In 2017 they were caught using an elaborate scheme involving video cameras to steal the opposing team's signs. By the way, the won the World Series that year. I was there because they played the Nats.
 
LEMON: They had the -- remember the drum thing. Like, they would give away signals with the drum cry. It's all kinds of stuff. I thought we were talking about cheating in relationships, but here we are. 
 
COLLINS: Well, that - that could be a factor in this, but -
 
HARLOW: Sanjay says there's a second week topic. 
 
DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: That's a second week segment.
 
LEMON: Hello, Dr. Gupta. Who are you this morning?
 
GUPTA: Good. COLLINS: A big question of why we have Dr. Sanjay Gupta here with us is why do people cheat? I know you've been looking into this. I think most people would say, you know, just human nature, but what is the science behind it? 
 
GUPTA: Well, I mean, you know, the fundamental answer, with no surprises, they want to win. And they want all the trappings that come with winning, the money, the status, the attention. That's fundamentally why people do this. 
 
We've also developed this win at all costs culture. I mean this is celebrated when people win. The outcome more so than the process. 
 <br>[06:55:02]
 
We know those things. 
 
But what I think is interesting is the nuance of the cognitive psychology behind this. If you start to look and believe that everyone is cheating, that this is just the normal society, then it becomes much more OK to cheat. I can't win unless I cheat. That's become part of the culture.
 
The flip side of that, by the way, is also true. If you believe no one is cheating, then you're far less likely to cheat as well. 
 
And then, finally, I think this is really interesting. People really may not believe that they are cheating or that they deserve to win. I deserve it, so I'm going to go ahead and cheat. 
 
LEMON: This plays into so much what's happening in our politics right now. 
 
HARLOW: Yes.
 
GUPTA: I think - I think there is probably some relationships here in all these sectors of society. But when it comes to competitive sports, so many of them are won by increments, small little increments. So, to win, you have to cheat a little bit to get that small increment. Didn't really cheat even though it gave you enough to win in a very competitive sport. 
 
LEMON: Doping, et cetera. 
 
GUPTA: So -- doping. So we're seeing that a lot in, again, many sectors of society.
 
HARLOW: Do - OK. So, last night I played the matching game with Luca, who's four, you know, where you flip over the cards and match. 
 
GUPTA: Did he - did he win? 
 
HARLOW: And then -- he won. But he won fair and square. And I was like, Luca, you can just go again. And he goes, no, mom, that's cheating. And I was like, thank you, Luca.
 
GUPTA: So you set up  a -
 
HARLOW: OK, so kids don't, by habit or nature, know to cheat. They learn to cheat. Then we learn to cheat. But who is more likely to cheat and why?
 
GUPTA: Well, so, there have been studies on this and they've - and the conclusion to the study, I'll give you the headline first, is that if the proper and certain behavioral cues are there, just about everyone will cheat. Just about everyone. Gender, age, doesn't matter. There are certain really subtle behavioral cues that make it much more likely to happen. 
 
A couple of them, you think no one's watching. That's - that's sort of the big one. And, again, no surprise there. Dim or messy environments. So, if you think there's a little chaotic environment, you're going to be more likely to cheat in those sorts of environments. 
 
LEMON: Dim, you mean lighting? 
 
GUPTA: Yes, lighting. 
 
LEMON: Yes. Oh.
 
GUPTA: Just some - simply as - simple as lighting.
 
HARLOW: Casino? 
 
LEMON: Yes.
 
COLLINS: Fishing. 
 
GUPTA: If you believe that there's an abundance of resources, there's enough to go around, it's not really going to matter if it's a money thing, for example. If you are tired, you are more likely to not have enough willpower to not cheat. So, they're doing all these standardized tests, for example, on Saturday mornings, all these high school kids are super tired at that point, more likely to cheat as a result. 
 
And also people who are in position of power. You know, people who stand like this, you know, positions of power. You find that -- 
 
COLLINS: Don's looking at -- 
 
LEMON: No, I'm - I'm not - I'm look at (INAUDIBLE).
 
HARLOW: He's good. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. 
 
GUPTA: Money wise you figure out possession wise who's more likely to cheat. 
 
LEMON: Yes.
 
COLLINS: That's really interesting that also positions of power, going back to what Don was talking about, people in politics.
 
GUPTA: Exactly.
 
COLLINS: Sanjay, thanks for joining us this morning.
 
LEMON: No one cheats. Just -
 
COLLINS: No use of the brain. I'm sad to say.
 
GUPTA: I know. I didn't get to use my brain. I was going to (INAUDIBLE).
 
LEMON: Nobody cheats when they're going to school to be a neurosurgeon, right?
 
GUPTA: That's right. You've got to know your stuff.
 
HARLOW: No, you can't.
 
COLLINS: Yes, you can't.
 
LEMON: Dr. Sanjay Gupta.
 
HARLOW: Can't cheat in the OR. 
 
See you tomorrow.
 
COLLINS: All right, Sanjay.
 
GUPTA: I'll be here tomorrow. 
 
HARLOW: Good.
 
LEMON: Thank you.
 
COLLINS: We'll see you tomorrow. 
 
GUPTA: Thanks, guys.
 
COLLINS: Up next we have a CNN exclusive. This is really, really chilling. A 911 call from a girl who was trapped inside the classroom with the Uvalde school shooter as the law enforcement was waiting outside for 40 minutes before they acted. Her mother is going to join us ahead to tell us what it's like to listen to her daughter call 911. 
 
LEMON: There's a lot of things that are coming out of Uvalde.
