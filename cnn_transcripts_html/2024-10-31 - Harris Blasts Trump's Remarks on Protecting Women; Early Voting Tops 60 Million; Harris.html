JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR:  We are just five days out from election night in America. And that night, I will bring you everything going on. The key race 
 
 alerts and the projections. We'll have John King at the magic wall. We'll have so many wise commentators and reporters on the ground and at the 
 
 campaign headquarters. No one covers an election like CNN.
 
Our special coverage is next Tuesday starting at 4:00 p.m. Eastern. Going to be a long night, going to drink a lot of coffee. And the news continues 
 
 on CNN with Wolf Blitzer in The Situation Room. See you tomorrow.
 
JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN ANCHOR, FIRST MOVE:  I'm Julia Chatterley. And wherever you are in the world, this is your "First Move."
 
Welcome to "First Move." And here's today's need to know. Sex split. Donald Trump says he'll protect women whether they like it or not. Kamala Harris 
 
 says, "That's very offensive," quote. Troops in transit. North Korean soldiers could be fighting Ukrainians in the coming days, according to U.S. 
 
 officials. World Series wonder the L.A. Dodgers finally beating the Yankees to take the biggest prize in baseball. And Halloween horror, why movies 
 
 made to scare give investors delight and not fright. That conversation and plenty more coming up.
 
But first, it's the final days before the Election Day in the United States as Republican Candidate Donald Trump makes yet another controversial 
 
 comment about women. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I want to protect the women of our country. I want to protect the women. 
 
 Sir, please don't say that. Why? They said, we think it's very inappropriate for you to say so. Why? I'm president. I want to protect the 
 
 women of our country. Well, I'm going to do it whether the women like it or not. I'm going to protect them.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHATTERLEY:  Trump made the remarks at a rally in Wisconsin on Wednesday. Harris losing no time in responding, calling it just one of a string of 
 
 incidents.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE:  It actually is, I think, very offensive to women in terms of 
 
 not understanding their agency, their authority, their right, and their ability to make decisions about their own lives.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHATTERLEY:  It remains to be seen if these last-minute comments on both sides, let's be clear, will impact the election. More than 61 million 
 
 Americans have already cast their ballots by mail all through early voting. Senior political analyst Ron Brownstein joins us now.
 
Ron, I don't know where we take this. I'm a woman who's surrounded by men who try and protect her. They don't control me. They don't abuse me. And I 
 
 think that's perhaps some of the challenges for people who are disconcerted by this. Do you think this impacts the election? And it does touch upon an 
 
 issue that is relevant, I think, which is he has more support among men, she has more support among women.
 
RON BROWNSTEIN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  Right. I actually wrote a long story about this a couple weeks ago in cnn.com when he said it for the 
 
 first time, I will be your protector. And, you know, it fits in with a pattern through this campaign where they have both he and J. D. Vance have 
 
 really signaled their affirmation of traditional gender roles.
 
I mean, all the hyper masculine symbolism of the Republican convention with professional wrestlers and ultimate fighting championship, folks 
 
 introducing Trump and J. D. Vance talking about childless cat ladies and the idea that, you know, women with parents should get extra votes for 
 
 their kids.
 
Basically, Trump is appealing to the portions of America that are most comfortable with traditional gender roles. And that includes mostly men, 
 
 but a large amount of blue collar and evangelical women as well. His problem is, is that the idea that women need to be protected by a man, 
 
 especially this man who has been adjudicated to have committed a sexual assault and has been credibly accused, you know, by two dozen or more other 
 
 allegations of sexual assault.
 
As one Republican pollster said to me, the whole idea that women need protecting is cringey, but it is cringiest coming from him for single 
 
 women, college educated women, younger women. And as you point out, women are a majority of the vote in America. They're a majority of the vote in 
 
 every swing state. Donald Trump has to win men by more than Kamala Harris wins women to win probably any state that is still at play in this 
 
 election. And I don't know if this adds to the problem, but it certainly reinforces it.
 
CHATTERLEY:  And convince those that are considered less likely to vote and therefore not captured in the polls that we've been watching to come and 
 
 register and ultimately vote to your point. I follow your columns very closely. You wrote one in The Atlantic talking about what you perceive to 
 
 be a critical shift in this election, and that is this ongoing belief that the Democrats need to win the national popular vote and do so in a strong 
 
 manner in order to win the election, and you're saying that might now be obsolete. Explain why and how that perhaps then changes the thinking on how 
 
 we look at the polls today.
 <br>[18:05:00]
 
BROWNSTEIN:  Yes. I mean -- look, I mean, I think there's -- the dominant view in both parties has been that Democrats have to win the national 
 
 popular vote by a considerable margin in order to squeeze out an electoral college victory, and that's because all of the swing states in 2020, and I 
 
 believe in 2016 as well, voted more Republican and the national average.
 
I mean, Hillary Clinton won national popular vote by two points, but that wasn't enough because she lost Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin 
 
 narrowly. Biden, it took him winning the national popular vote by four and a half points to get over the top in those states as well as Arizona and 
 
 Georgia.
 
The difference this time is that the reason Trump is narrowing the national popular vote is largely because he is gaining among Latino voters, 
 
 especially men, and to some extent black voters, especially men. Kamala Harris is holding the gains among white voters that Joe Biden made in 2020 
 
 relative to Hillary Clinton.
 
And that means that even if Kamala Harris wins the popular vote by about the same amount as Hillary Clinton did in 2016, because more of her votes 
 
 are coming from whites, she is better positioned to win those predominantly white states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.
 
So, it is entirely possible, I think, that Kamala Harris could win the popular vote by about the same amount that Hillary Clinton did. And unlike 
 
 Clinton, who fell short in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, Harris might be able to squeeze them out and get to 270. Of course, Pennsylvania 
 
 is the toughest of the three. It is the battle of the bulge in this presidential.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Wow. It's going to be fascinating to see. I love the article. Fascinating read. Ron Brownstein, always a pleasure, sir. Thank you.
 
BROWNSTEIN:  Thanks.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Now, both candidates hitting key battleground states. Kamala Harris spoke at a rally in Phoenix, Arizona earlier and is heading now to 
 
 Reno, then Las Vegas for an event with Jennifer Lopez this evening. Meanwhile, Donald Trump will speak at an event in Glendale, Arizona later 
 
 tonight.
 
And meanwhile, the pool of persuadable voters is shrinking as people cast early ballots, 55 percent of likely voters in Arizona and 42 percent in 
 
 Nevada say they have already voted. Carolina Cuellar is a reporter at the Arizona Luminaria and she joins us now from Tucson. Carolina, fantastic to 
 
 have you with us.
 
In the latest CNN poll, we have Harris holding 48 percent of the support among likely voters in Arizona, 47 percent for Trump. So, it is absolutely 
 
 neck and neck. But I believe around a third of those registered aren't registered for either party. So, you have a whole host of independents, 
 
 too. Talk us through how it feels to be bombarded with advertising and what people there are saying.
 
CAROLINA CUELLAR, REPORTER, ARIZONA LUMINARIA:  Yes. So, bombarding is a good term. I think we've had a lot of people coming in October, including 
 
 former President Donald Trump three times alone. As he's -- as you said, he's coming this evening.
 
So, I think it is not necessarily -- like you visit these rallies and it's not necessarily a push to, you know, change people's minds or anything. I 
 
 think the objective is really to maintain the energy that voters have and also convince people who are already on one side to get people that they 
 
 know who are, you know, sort of debating who they're going to vote for their preferred candidate.
 
And I also think that, like in 2020, only 66 percent of registered voters voted in the presidential election. So, there's a lot of room for people to 
 
 be convinced to actually just go out and vote regardless of which candidate it is.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes, it's fascinating. We're just showing live pictures of those rallies as well, just for people wondering what they're seeing right 
 
 now on the screen. Carolina, for those people that are independent and for those that didn't vote, which is such a crucial point that you're making, 
 
 what is the talk there about what might convince them either to go and vote perhaps for the first time in a number of years, if not the first time 
 
 ever, or choose a side? Because the candidates are very different. Let's be clear.
 
CUELLAR:  Yes, no, I think there's a lot I think of -- on nationally and on a state level of uncertainty about who has the lead. I think you hear new 
 
 polls coming up saying Harris has a lead or Trump has a lead and that's putting a lot of pressure, I think, on voters and as our people who are 
 
 campaigning, putting a lot of pressure on voters because it just seems increasingly more consequential, like who you're going to vote for.
 
And I think the strategies that are being employed with voters in Arizona is -- at least on certain sizes really like looking at single issue voters, 
 
 like the topic of abortion is one of those really important topics. And in Arizona, they recently tried to reinstate legislation that would have 
 
 amounted to essentially an abortion ban. 
 <br>[18:10:00]
 
So, I think that has been the impetus for a lot of people to get involved in politics and perhaps that's made a lot of those independent voters on 
 
 one end. And, you know, border and immigration policy being in a border state also a huge issue. So, I think, you know, issues like that are sort 
 
 of key to helping persuade a voter in either direction.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Very quickly, because I have about 30 seconds left. How much discussion is there among voters about the risk that it could take a while 
 
 to count the votes, concerns about -- and it's not evidence based, and we'll reiterate that, potential vote rigging or the fact that the result 
 
 could be fixed? How concerned are people?
 
CUELLAR:  Yes. So, it's interesting the secretary of state came out and said that it could take 10 to 15 days, I believe, for us to actually get an 
 
 official vote. And we've seen previously people on the Republican side sort of really wanting to get votes out quickly, get results out quickly. But 
 
 because of recent legislation that has been led by Republicans here in Arizona State, you see that, like, urgency died down. Because they have 
 
 enacted policies that would actually contribute to the lag in getting results. So, I think it's kind of switched in this race in that regard.
 
But yes, I mean, we'll see. We'll see. I don't hear too much about it quite yet, but I'm sure it'll become a bigger topic as we near actual Election 
 
 Day.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes, we're certainly going to be watching very closely. Carolina, great to have you on the show. Thank you so much for letting us 
 
 know how it feels there.
 
CUELLAR:  Oh, of course. Thank you for having me.
 
CHATTERLEY:  All right. Thank you. Now, at least 158 people have now lost their lives in Spain's worst flooding disaster in modern history. The 
 
 Valencia region has seen most of the damage. Thousands of people there are without power or running water. Authorities warn the death toll is also 
 
 likely to rise with the dozen still missing. And the military now called in to help with the rescue efforts.
 
Chad Myers is here with more. Chad, we were saying yesterday on the show that there's a fear now of even more rain. What's the forecast looking 
 
 like?
 
CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  I mean, a little bit. You know, I mean, 50 to 100 millimeters is not really out of the question, but that's nothing 
 
 like what they saw in just eight hours.
 
It was an upper-level cutoff low. Think about the trough, sometimes we talk in the jet stream. Well, the trough was cutoff here just now over Spain. 
 
 The same thing happens in California, but to the east of California, there isn't a Mediterranean Sea. There is a desert. So, we don't get this type of 
 
 flow into California when we have to cutoff low to the southwest, just west of Mexico, really proper.
 
Look at this, 491 millimeters in just eight hours. The normal yearly rainfall for Chiva is 475 for the year. They picked up their years' worth 
 
 of rain in eight hours. Here's the before and after pictures. Here's the lagoon here. Here's Valencia up here. Notice how much water kind of fills 
 
 into the lagoon.
 
But what we're seeing here, if we get closer to the cities, take a look at these normally very dry rivers. They were not dry. The water was just 
 
 rushing down from the mountains. Another picture here. You can see grass where the river sometimes is, but not anymore. This river was completely 
 
 out of control.
 
So, here we've seen pictures of the cars that were piled up on the highway. There is that highway, mud just completely clogging the roadways. And that 
 
 was part of the problem with the people not being able to get out of their cars. Now, the rain, yes, it's still here, but it's not really concentrated 
 
 in the same areas. Maybe a little bit north of Valencia, southwest of Barcelona. That is some of the good news.
 
But we also had Kong-rey. We talked about that the last couple of days. Significant damage in Taiwan with a 200-kilometer per hour storm, 120 miles 
 
 per hour as it moved right through central part there of Taiwan, more than a meter of rain. I know we're talking about, you know, 450 in Spain.
 
Look at this 1.2 meters of rainfall just in the past 48 hours. Now, the thing is falling apart That's the good news. The winds are dying down, but 
 
 we will see a little bit of effect here in Shanghai and also over Kyushu. We'll even see some heavier rainfall on up toward even Tokyo, some spots 
 
 there could pick up 100 to 150 millimeters of rainfall. We'll have to keep watching that.
 
It's dying, but it's still it's not dead. There still will be some stuff with this, Julia.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Chad, always great to have you on. Thank you. Chad Myers there. We'll continue to watch it.
 
Now, the United States expects North Korea to deploy its troops into combat against Ukraine in the "coming days," quote, U.S. Secretary of State 
 
 Anthony Blinken says about 8,000 of Pyongyang soldiers have arrived in Russia's Kursk region. Now, that's just across the border from Ukraine. He 
 
 says if North Korean forces go into battle, that would make them a, quote, "legitimate military target."
 <br>[18:15:00]
 
Oren Liebermann is at the Pentagon. Oren, this obviously moves the story on from the discussion that we were having about this yesterday. The United 
 
 States and the South Koreans leaving Russia and North Korea in no doubt that they know what's going on. The question is to what end?
 
OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT:  And it's amazing, Julia, how fast the U.S. has moved on this. Largely, it appears pressed on by the 
 
 South Koreans own statements and intelligence sharing. It was just last week that it was only 3,000 troops, North Korean troops, that is, in Russia 
 
 that the U.S. was willing to acknowledge publicly. And now, it's 10,000 in Russia, 8,000 in the Kursk region that you just showed a map of there.
 
And then, the U.S. now speaking to the training they have received, that is, training in trench clearing, infantry operations, the usage and firing 
 
 of artillery as well as drones. The U.S. making it clear these North Korean troops are very much heading for the fight, heading into the -- and into 
 
 and onto the battlefield, quoting Secretary of State Antony Blinken here in the coming days.
 
The U.S. views this very seriously. And in a two plus two, that is the secretary of state and the secretary of defense of the U.S. meeting with 
 
 their South Korean counterparts here, they're making it very clear that there will be some sort of response and how closely the U.S. and South 
 
 Korea will be watching this.
 
And then, of course, the concern was always that this would mean that the fight in Ukraine in will have essentially involved or entailed another 
 
 region that is the Far East. And we're seeing, essentially, North Korea's own actions here with the South Korean ministers of defense and foreign 
 
 affairs here, North Korea firing a ballistic missile that flew for nearly 90 minutes. That is the longest firing of a North Korean missile we've ever 
 
 seen. And it comes about a year after North Korea's last intercontinental ballistic missile launch.
 
So, you see the cooperation here between the U.S. and South Korea. You see it not only not only with North Korea's own launch and a large-scale air 
 
 exercise, more than a hundred advanced fighter jets from the U.S. and South Korea flying there, but you see the intelligence and cooperation of what 
 
 North Korean troops are doing as they are expected to be seen on the battlefield in Ukraine, near Ukraine in the coming days.
 
Julia, one more country to bring into this picture here is China, the U.S. and South Korea making it clear they'd like to see China's engagement here 
 
 to try to essentially get North Korea to back off. But so far, South Korea says that China is just waiting and watching at this point.
 
CHATTERLEY:  And we'll do the same. Oren Liebermann at the Pentagon, thank you. All right. Straight ahead, the U.S. presidential race being closely 
 
 watched thousands of miles away in China. We're live in Beijing to understand what citizens there think.
 
And call them the A team of tech. Amazon and Apple just out with their results. Amazon's crushing estimates. China sales weighing on Apple. The 
 
 latest numbers after this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:20:00]
 
CHATTERLEY:  Welcome back to "First Move." And a spooky session on Wall Street topping today's Money Move. The NASDAQ heading in the wrong 
 
 direction on Halloween, down well over 2 percent. The S&amp;P suffering its worst session in over a month too. Disappointing results from Microsoft and 
 
 Meta helping contribute to the ghoulish mood. The tech giants beating on the top and bottom lines, but warning that expenditures are rising. 
 
 Microsoft was also out with some softer guidance too. And you can see a pullback there of some 6 percent.
 
Now, checking on us economic data too. The Fed's preferred measure of inflation showing prices rising at their slowest pace since early 2021. But 
 
 we did see a rising in the core rate of inflation month over month. So, a slight thing to watch, not cause for concern for the Fed, but something to 
 
 watch.
 
Traders now bracing for the all-important U.S. jobs report, which will be released Friday, the last big data point before the U.S. presidential 
 
 elections.
 
And more tricks than treats across Asia. Green arrows for the Shanghai Composite as Chinese factory activity rose for the first time in six 
 
 months. But we did see weakness for the Nikkei. The Bank of Japan keeping rates steady but leaving open the possibility of a hike in December.
 
In other business news, tech giants Apple and Amazon also out with their latest earnings results, rounding out a torrential week of tech earnings, 
 
 Amazon rallying in afterhours trade thanks to strength in the Cloud. Apple shares a touch weaker. One reason a China sales miss.
 
Lance Ulanoff is editor-at-large of TechRadar and he joins us now. Lance, it does say something about a company that they can take a $10.2 billion 
 
 hit due to back taxes and still make almost $94 billion worth of net income. But that's Apple. Just talk us through the numbers because China 
 
 was a disappointment again.
 
LANCE ULANOFF, EDITOR-AT-LARGE, TECHRADAR:  Yes. Well, they said China was basically flat, which in a way was maybe good news for them, but it was a 
 
 miss from where they wanted to be. But when you look at, you know, Apple's numbers and iPhone, again, is, you know, revenue up like 6.6 percent over 
 
 the same time last year.
 
And, you know, every -- actually, every category with one exception was up. The one category that dropped, and this is something that I kind of paid 
 
 attention to, is wearables. It had a 3 percent drop over last year. And that does include you know, the Apple Watch. AirPods, and I believe it 
 
 might include Vision Pro.
 
In the earnings call they didn't talk about Vision Pro at all. You know what they talked about, almost nonstop? They talked about Apple 
 
 Intelligence. And the big question is, because, you know, that the majority of the revenues came through the iPhone, is whether or not excitement and 
 
 interest in Apple Intelligence is what drove that number.
 
All that Tim Cook would say is that the uptake of iOS 18.1, which is the first blush of Apple Intelligence for U.S. English -- the English U.S. 
 
 version, because not all around the world, but it was faster than last year for iOS 17.1. So, to him, that indicates tremendous interest, but it is 
 
 really untested. We don't even have the full version of Apple Intelligence, that is going to show up next year.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes, I was about to say give us six months on that one to get a real feel, if not more. What about Amazon as well? Because I did see that 
 
 they reported a 19 percent increase in sales in the Cloud business, which was in line with estimates. But I compare that 19 percent to the 33 percent 
 
 jump that we saw at Microsoft's Azure and a 35 percent surge at Google Cloud.
 
I noticed some degree, it's sort of comparing oranges with tangerines, perhaps. But what did you make of Amazon's numbers?
 
ULANOFF:  Well, you know, I mean, look, there's still -- it was all up, right? Every -- in every sector for them, it was up. But if that growth is 
 
 not as fast to the two that you compare to, Microsoft and Google, let's keep in mind who is really in the A.I. race, right? Microsoft with Copilot 
 
 and working with all their partners delivered on PCs, Google with Gemini, that's putting it everywhere, including the top of your search.
 
Amazon promised us a year ago, Alexa A.I., right? We were going to start to see some real stuff, but did not happen, has not happened. Amazon has been 
 
 weirdly -- so, they've got Rufus on the website. OK. So, that can help you search. That's their A.I. But, you know, they're not -- and they're not 
 
 really talking at an enterprise level about A.I. in the same way that these other companies are.
 <br>[18:25:00]
 
So, you know, is that why? I really don't know, but I would say that when you look at where people are looking at the future and where they're 
 
 pouring money into right now, it is A.I.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes. OK. So, we're sort of one mind on that front. Very quickly. Can we talk about Google and the decision by Russia to find them 
 
 more money than there is -- 
 
ULANOFF:  I'm still counting the zeros. I'm still counting the zeros.
 
CHATTERLEY:  It's 34 zeros. I don't even know how you say that, but it's 34 zeros, by the way, obviously, it's 36 zeros if we're talking in Russian 
 
 rubles. For limits on YouTube of Russia state -- Russian state media. Why do this?
 
ULANOFF:  I think it's just to make a statement. You know, obviously Google's not even -- I don't think they're going to respond. I don't think 
 
 they're going to do anything about it. Russia could continue. They could, you know, shut down access to all of Google services. But of course, people 
 
 -- you know, Russia is the heart of technology, by the way. They've done a lot of tech work, especially in the early days of the tech industry. And 
 
 these people know how to get around roadblocks and they will VPN their way back into Google services if they need to.
 
Again, it's just making a statement. It's making an almost ridiculous statement by putting it as such a big number no one's going to take it 
 
 seriously as opposed to actually having a conversation about what's going on there.
 
CHATTERLEY:  I know. I mean, the only reason why we're talking about it is so that we could create that banner just because I just love it. All those 
 
 noughts in the banner. Lance, thank you very much.
 
ULANOFF:  All those zeroes.
 
CHATTERLEY:  I know. Fantastic. Yes. Google, snore. Thank you so much, Lance. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHATTERLEY:  Welcome back to "First Move." And back to U.S. politics. Next week's presidential and congressional elections are receiving extensive 
 
 coverage, not only in America, of course, but across the globe, too. It has big implications. It will have massive implications for Europe, Asia, the 
 
 war in Ukraine, and, of course, global trade.
 <br>[18:30:00]
 
U.K. based publication, The Economist, backing Kamala Harris in its latest issue out Thursday. The magazine calls Donald Trump, quote, "an 
 
 unacceptable risk to America and the world."
 
Chinese citizens are also weighing in, too. And Marc Stewart joins us live from Beijing. Marc, welcome. It's a whole another segment to talk about 
 
 what the economy said. We're not going to talk about that. What we are going to talk about is what people where you live are saying. How much do 
 
 they care and what are they saying about who may and should win?
 
MARC STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Julia. Good morning. Well, first and foremost, there certainly is curiosity. There is intrigue about the U.S. 
 
 election. People ask me all the time, who do you think is going to win? Who are you supporting? These are the questions I get from Chinese citizens on 
 
 a regular basis.
 
But broadly speaking, there are more concerns in Beijing for Chinese citizens than what's happening in the United States. People here are 
 
 concerned about the economy, their wellbeing, their own personal health. That doesn't negate the intrigue. It's certainly there, but those are much 
 
 bigger priorities.
 
I want to share with you some of the reactions toward the U.S. election that we got from talking everyday people on the street. Here's a look at 
 
 some of our conversations from the streets of Beijing.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator):  I know about it, but I don't pay too much attention to it.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  I don't think it will have any impact on our life here. To us ordinary Chinese people, whoever becomes the 
 
 U.S. president, whether it's candidate A or candidate B, it is all the same.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
STEWART:  It is all the same, said that gentlemen. One area where responses are a little bit more outspoken, you could argue, is on Chinese social 
 
 media. Typically, social media is censored, but the U.S. election in any kind of discord, any kind of disharmony that's happening in the U.S. is not 
 
 censored. It's something that Chinese citizens see and they are reacting. Let me show you some responses that we've seen in recent days, recent weeks 
 
 on Chinese social media about the U.S. election.
 
One person saying the U.S. is about to split. Another person says, it doesn't matter who it is. Their containment of China won't ease. And yet, 
 
 another reaction, there's no perfect system, but at least they allow people to question them. I found that to be interesting. Obviously, a different 
 
 view in this part of the world as to how -- as how elections are handled.
 
Julia, I should tell you, in 2020, I watched the U.S. election results come over when I was working in London. It's going to be interesting now in 2024 
 
 to watch such a monumental election being on the other side of the Pacific Ocean.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes, but I love that guy though that you spoke to that had this Starbucks store over his right shoulder and was like, I don't think 
 
 it's going to have any impact. It's like we get into a trade war, they could get more expensive.
 
Marc, what about Xi Jinping? What about the government? Do you think they have a view? What's the perception there of who they'd prefer?
 
STEWART:  Right. Well, the government is asked that a lot during news conferences, during the ministry of foreign affairs, during the briefings, 
 
 reporters always ask questions about the U.S. election. And Beijing is very careful not to weigh in. They make it very clear this is a U.S. issue. We 
 
 don't want to get involved.
 
But you could make arguments that Beijing would support a Trump administration in the sense that Donald Trump has shown his displeasure to 
 
 NATO and toward alliances, especially at a time when China is trying to build itself as this new world order, this alternative to the west.
 
But you could also argue that Beijing would be very happy if Kamala Harris were to be in office in the sense that under this current Democratic 
 
 administration there are diplomatic talks, conversations are taking place. But at the end of the day, it's going to be challenging for Beijing, 
 
 because regardless of the administration, tariffs are likely to stay. And so, that is going to be a challenge regardless of whom is in the White 
 
 House, Julia.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes, it's one of the few things I think that Congress agrees on, tough talk against China. I mean, of course, the Trump tariffs that 
 
 were enacted were maintained by the Biden administration. And then they added more. Interesting. But 60 percent tariffs from Biden -- sorry, from 
 
 Trump, it could be interesting. Marc Stewart, thank you.
 
Now, the presidential race is too close to call, but that's not the case in the media universe dominated by supporters of Former President Donald 
 
 Trump. Now, according to them, the outcome is already set in stone as Donie O'Sullivan reports. They even appear to be laying the groundwork to 
 
 challenge the results if Trump loses. Just watch this report.

DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN BUSINESS POLITICS AND TECHNOLOGY REPORTER:  Good morning. The reason you are here at my home at this godforsaken hour of the 
 
 morning is because we are about to spend the day in the MAGA media universe.
 
O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  Every day, millions of Americans get their news and information, not from newspapers or cable news -- 
 
DANIEL BONGINO, HOST OF "THE DAN BONGINO SHOW":  The momentum behind Donald Trump's campaign, ladies and gentlemen, it's almost tangible at this point.
 
O'SULLIVAN:  -- but from a new world of online MAGA Media outlets.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The secret ingredient to the COVID-19 injections has been found.
 
O'SULLIVAN:  Today is going to be a long day.
 
O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  But you don't have to work too hard to get sucked into the MAGA Media universe.
 
O'SULLIVAN:  I have a Samsung television. As long as it's -- you're connected to the Internet, you got all these free channels. You have 
 
 channels you'd recognize, but then you go down, Real America's Voice.
 
O'SULLIVAN (voice-over): But Real America's Voice is anything but a normal news network.
 
STEVE BANNON, FORMER WHITE HOUSE CHIEF STRATEGIST: -- enemies, because we're going medieval on these people.
 
O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  It's the home of Steve Bannon's "War Room."
 
JAKE TAPPER, CNN HOST:  Where do people like that go to share the big line? MAGA media.
 
O'SULLIVAN:  I know that guy.
 
DAVID BOSSIE, AMERICAN POLITICAL ACTIVIST:  Good morning, posse. This is Dave Bossie, sitting in for Steve Bannon.
 
O'SULLIVAN:  Big part of what's happening on MAGA media is convincing their audience that there is absolutely no way that Trump can lose.
 
ALEX JONES, HOST, "THE ALEX JONES SHOW":  There's a 99 percent chance we are facing total crazy town.
 
O'SULLIVAN (voice-over): As the day went on -- 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  If anyone believes that Kamala Harris is ahead in the polls, you need to have your brain checked.
 
O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  -- it became clear that MAGA media is telling their audience to expect the election to be stolen.
 
MICHAEL LINDELL, CEO, MYPILLOW:  Pennsylvania has done it three times in a row, three times in a row, three elections in a row. They had more votes 
 
 than voters.
 
O'SULLIVAN:  This is not true.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I just voted in the (INAUDIBLE) election. I voted for one president, checked it on the video screen. When I got the paper ballot, 
 
 it had the other candidate's name on it.
 
O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  This video was quickly going viral, with some saying it was proof of election fraud.
 
O'SULLIVAN:  This one has seven million views. Voters in Tarrant County are reporting that the voting machines are flipping their votes from Trump to 
 
 Harris."
 
O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  Election officials had responded to the video.
 
O'SULLIVAN:  Now, Tarrant County has put out a press release, 51 retweets, compared to millions of views for the video. The original ballot was 
 
 spoiled and the voter remarked a new ballot with his preferred choice reflected. Essentially, what they're saying is, this guy made a mistake, 
 
 and that's the whole point of having the paper receipt. You can make sure, and he was able to cast his vote correctly.
 
LINDELL:  But I want to tell you guys about our final sheets that just came in.
 
SEAN SPICER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Before I do that, I want to tell you how I sleep every night.
 
O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  But MAGA media isn't all doom and gloom. There's also a lot of stuff you can buy.
 
SPICER:  But I've got my Beam Dream Powder. Now, this...
 
O'SULLIVAN:  It is kind of sad. You see Sean Spicer, once the White House press secretary.
 
RUDY GIULIANI, FORMER ATTORNEY FOR PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:  My own brand of organic specialty coffee, Rudy Coffee.
 
O'SULLIVAN:  Rudy Giuliani, once America's mayor, selling sleeping pills and coffee.
 
O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  The MAGA media universe is surreal, but also scary.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The country's probably going to be in a state of whipped-up chaos.
 
O'SULLIVAN:  There are so many shows, so many influencers, so many people just posting all day long. Clearly, one thing that is being pushed really, 
 
 really hard is that Trump is definitely going to win, and, if he doesn't win, it is because of fraud, it is because the election was stolen.
 
Donie O'Sullivan, CNN, at my apartment in New York.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHATTERLEY:  Worrying. All right. Coming up, Halloween means horror. And for some films -- firm firms -- film firms, oh, my goodness. It also means 
 
 big bucks. We'll discuss the business of boos.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:40:00]
 
CHATTERLEY:  Welcome back to "First Move." Now, if you're looking for a good investment, you might want to bet on a boo or two. Horror movies 
 
 aren't just a good thrill, they can also be good business. Really popular movies can gross up to more than 10 times their cost, thanks to lean 
 
 budgets and quick production turnarounds. And apparently, the genre is only gaining fans. Bloomberg reporting Gen Z viewers watch even more spooky 
 
 films versus earlier generations.
 
Now, in case you decided horror was enough somewhere around screen four, just keep in mind, it's not all ghouls and gore. Recent critical darlings 
 
 include "Pearl," "The Invisible Man" and "Get Out." Did you watch those? Well, I can tell you those last two are from Blumhouse Productions. And 
 
 Abhijay Prakash is its president.
 
Great to have you on the show. So, what we've ascertained is that they can be really good investments if you're investing in this kind of movies. But 
 
 just, let's take a step back. Why is it thriving as a genre in your mind?
 
ABHIJAY PRAKASH, PRESIDENT, BLUMHOUSE PRODUCTIONS:  Yes. Look, thanks for having me and talk about this. People love to be scared. Audiences love to 
 
 watch scary stories in the dark. And that's -- obviously, it's been a part of the theatrical moviegoing experience for years and years. But even post-
 
 COVID we've seen that theatrical movies have been the most resilient, you know, domain for consuming horror movies. And the horror genre is just -- 
 
 it lends itself to that experience of leaving your house to go to be scared.
 
CHATTERLEY:  People like to be scared. I can tell you, I avoid horror movies like "The Plague," I apologies. I actually don't like to be scared.
 
PRAKASH:  No.
 
CHATTERLEY:  I like to be entertained, but I don't like to be scared. Why do young people, in particular, do you think, like to be "scared," quote?
 
PRAKASH:  I mean, look, scary stories have been around since the dawn of human history. So, I would encourage you, Julia, even to get into that, 
 
 too. I think there is some part of you that enjoys the feeling of being scared or tapping into that fear in a safe space.
 
Young people, they love the thrill, the experience of it, and doing it in a big group, I mean, it's a decades-long generational experience, whether 
 
 it's, you know, teens going to the movie theater or, you know, having house parties or sleepovers and watching it through a blanket, and there's 
 
 something primordial that it taps into that you're able to do in that safe space with your friends and you just like going on a ride together, a 
 
 journey. And I think that's been a part of human history and it will continue to be so, and it's a safe way to have that experience with your 
 
 friends.
 
CHATTERLEY:  You know, it's interesting. There's also, and has been, I think, an element of snobbery, even with the sort of popular demand and the 
 
 growth in demand that we're seeing around the genre, do you think that still exists or do you think some of the movies that certainly that you've 
 
 been created are breaking through that barrier? Because, I mean, you've had huge awards.
 
PRAKASH:  Yes, I think it's a great point, like scary stories, which is often the way that we'll describe it, it's a big tent, what is -- what's 
 
 horror? And I think some people tend to put maybe a very narrow lens and can think of horror is off-putting, but it's a very big umbrella. It 
 
 includes multiple subgenres, everything from psychological horror, thriller, like our recent movie "Speak No Evil," to horror with a comedic 
 
 bent like "Megan" that we've done in the past, or "Happy Death Day," or supernatural horror that we've done with "Conjuring," or "Insidious" and 
 
 even some of the slasher horror that I grew up with that we've done here too, like "Halloween," for instance.
 
So, there are a lot of diverse audiences, and different ways in which we can, you know, tap into different strains of storytelling. So, it's a very 
 
 big tent and, you know, we're lucky to be able to be, you know, active in multiple elements of it and to attract very different audiences that way.
 <br>[18:45:00]
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes, maybe it comes through living alone actually, and having a dog, that's a complete wuss that hide behind me if anything did happen as 
 
 much as I love him.
 
PRAKASH:  The scary (INAUDIBLE) where you feel like happening in your house or it could happen in your house. That's -- 
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes. Yes.
 
PRAKASH:  (INAUDIBLE). Yes.
 
CHATTERLEY:  I'm literally running out of time. Best horror movie of all time for someone who clearly needs to get more involved?
 
PRAKASH:  Oh, my gosh. Well, I would pick one of our own, but I will say a classic.
 
CHATTERLEY:  I know. You could do two.
 
PRAKASH:  All right. No, I would say "Get Out" is one of the best horror movies ever made, which our company did. And then, the other one I'll say 
 
 is "Jaws," which is a classic. Forever and always. It changed the business and it kept multiple people out of the water. It just points to the 
 
 cultural impact that movies can have, and it's an incredible thing. I hope you get over your fear, Julia, and join us at the theater.
 
CHATTERLEY:  I've actually watched "Jaws." So, now I don't feel so bad about my professed, you know, dislike of them. OK. I'm going to watch. I'll 
 
 watch more.
 
PRAKASH:  All right.
 
CHATTERLEY:  You've convinced me. Happy Halloween. Abhijay, great to have you on.
 
PRAKASH:  Halloween to you.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Thank you.
 
PRAKASH:  Thank you.
 
CHATTERLEY:  All right. Still to come, the Los Angeles Dodgers clinch the World Series title. How baseball fans in Japan and beyond are celebrating. 
 
 Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHATTERLEY:  The world of baseball has a new champion. The Los Angeles Dodgers winning Game 5 of the World Series against the New York Yankees on 
 
 Wednesday. And if Japan had a hometown hero, it was certainly Shohei Ohtani. Millions of fans in Japan dropped everything to watch their 
 
 favorite slugger and Dodgers star. Will Ripley was amongst the diehard Ohtani fans.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
WILL RIPLEY, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  No wonder they call it baseball's World Series, and some of the most devoted fans are 
 
 halfway around the globe.
 
RIPLEY:  The games are in New York and Los Angeles this week, but here in Japan, more than 10 percent of the population is tuning into this iconic 
 
 showdown between the Dodgers and the Yankees.
 
RIPLEY (voice-over):  Game 2 alone drew a staggering average of 15.9 million viewers in Japan. The highest MLB postseason viewership ever in the 
 
 country, the league says. Japan's passion for baseball is legendary. But in this Tokyo bar in the famed Shibuya district, the focus is not just on the 
 
 game, it's on one player. All-star sensation Shohei Ohtani, the L.A. Dodgers' $700 million man. A two-time MVP, cross-cultural icon, and 
 
 hometown hero.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  Ohtani is an honorable person in Japan. Everyone shouts, Ohtani, Ohtani, and it makes me so happy. We've 
 
 never had anyone like him. He's our dear Ohtani.
 <br>[18:50:00]
 
RIPLEY (voice-over): Wednesday night, Ohtani's Dodgers deliver a Game five win in New York City, earning them the World Series crown and a place in 
 
 the hearts of baseball fans around the world from the United States to Japan.
 
Will Ripley, CNN, Nara, Japan.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHATTERLEY:  And Patrick Snell is here with us now. Patrick, the Japanese are clearly loving it for Otani, too. It's like dream fulfilled in year 
 
 one. I mean, wowsers.
 
PATRICK SNELL, CNN WORLD SPORT:  I mean, yes, wowsers. This is exactly why Ohtani joined the Dodgers, Julia.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes.
 
SNELL:  He craved winning the World Series and he now has the victorious Dodgers making their way back to the City of Angels. This was early 
 
 Thursday after accomplishing a major milestone as well as they recorded the biggest comeback ever to clinch a full classic crown.
 
But let's go back to Wednesday night in the Big Apple, New York City, things starting off absolutely fantastically for the Yankees. It seemed 
 
 like we'd get a Game 5. Aaron Judge hitting his first ever World Series home run in the first, then Jazz Chisholm connecting for back-to-back home 
 
 runs there. Yankee Stadium going nuts as they were up 3-0 right away, then they were up 5-nothing in the fifth.
 
Things falling apart though. First that mistake from Judge, followed by a series of mistakes by the Yankees. The Dodgers getting five unearned runs 
 
 in the end in that inning to tie the game up. The pressure really, really mounting on the Yankees to keep the series going. In the eighth with it now 
 
 tied at six, Mookie Betts with the sac fly. Tommy Edman scoring to give L.A. the lead. Dodgers win it in the end, 7-6 to take the World Series in 
 
 five games. What a thrilling climax. Just look at those scenes there, what it means to those players, Julia.
 
This is the Dodgers' eighth World Series crown in team history. Let's get right inside that locker room in the clubhouse there. They win it in the 
 
 first season after signing Ohtani to a record 10 year $700 million deal. Omar Jimenez was in the clubhouse celebrating with the team.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MAX MUNCY, LOS ANGELES DODGERS THIRD BASEMAN:  Unbelievable. I mean, this is what you strive for. This is why you play the game. Now, we're here. 
 
 It's special.
 
WILL SMITH, LOS ANGELES DODGERS CATCHER:  There's nothing better. We worked all year for -- win the World Series. Celebrate with these guys. They're 
 
 special. And, you know, we're going to celebrate this one. Celebrate it right.
 
BLAKE TREINEN, LOS ANGELES DODGERS PITCHER:  Blessed, man. Truly blessed. It's so fun to be able to act like a little kid with my full-grown adult, 
 
 like, husbands, dads. We get to let loose a lot of hard work and stress and pressure behind this career. And -- 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SNELL:  What scenes. Dodgers player or fan. And what a moment as well for Freddie Freeman who was named World Series most valuable player. Freeman 
 
 setting a full classic record, homering in six, yes, six consecutive World Series games dating right back to when he was actually on the Braves as 
 
 well. And remember, Freeman had to miss eight games, Julia, as well while his son, Max, battled a rare autoimmune disorder. Thankfully, Max doing 
 
 great right now, wonderful to see.
 
Freeman also spraining his ankle as well at the very end of the season. So, what a -- just great storylines everywhere you look when it comes to this 
 
 year's World Series. Great comeback for him. The Dodgers celebrating their title with fans on Friday with a victory parade. A great time to be a 
 
 Dodgers fan, no question about it. Back to you, Julia.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes, and great news on Max, and what a waste of champagne, but I'm sure they drank more. Patrick, thank you.
 
And finally, on "First Move," Hello Kitty, hello 50. November first marks the 50th birthday of the iconic fictional feline, a purr-fect time for the 
 
 Japanese fans to celebrate. Hanako Montgomery did.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
HANAKO MONTGOMERY, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  In this sea of Hello Kitties, it's hard for superfan Asako Kanda to pick her favorite.
 
ASAKO KANDA, HELLO KITY SUPERFAN (through translator):  This one talks. She said, I missed you.
 
MONTGOMERY (voice-over):  Like many fans before her, Kanda was drawn to Hello Kitty as a child. Her collection's grown a bit since then.
 
MONTGOMERY:  So, this Hello Kitty is a special Hello Kitty that's celebrating her 50th birthday and she's wearing a tartan because Hello 
 
 Kitty herself is actually British.
 
MONTGOMERY (voice-over):  She loves them all like family. Getting rid of any is out of the question.
 
KANDA (through translator):  She's the one constant in my life. My love for Hello Kitty has never wavered.
 
MONTGOMERY (voice-over):  With her iconic red bow and mouthless charm, Hello Kitty has captivated generations of fans. In her 50 years, she's been 
 
 a United Nations ambassador, met global stars, and even picked up some sports. All while taking Japan's kawaii, or cute, culture from niche to 
 
 worldwide.
 <br>[18:55:00]
 
And her hard work's paid off. Worth $80 billion U.S. dollars. Hello Kitty is the second highest grossing franchise in the world, according to 
 
 TitleMax. Not bad for a little girl. Yes, you heard that right. That only weighs three apples and is five apples tall.
 
But Hello Kitty hasn't always been this popular. After her 1974 debut on a small coin purse, Hello Kitty merchandise sales slumped. Until parent 
 
 company Sanrio hired designer Yuko Yamaguchi six years later, who turned to fans for help.
 
YUKO YAMAGUCHI, HELLO KITTY DESIGNER (through translator):  They told me it was always the same stuff, and that she wasn't stylish anymore. So, I added 
 
 new trends and made her more like everyone else. And gradually, sales started to improve.
 
MONTGOMERY (voice-over):  Since then, she's expanded Hello Kitty's world, giving the character new clothes, skills, and broadening her fan base to 
 
 adults. After decades together, Yamaguchi says her bond with Kitty has evolved, from friend to alter ego, to talent she manages.
 
YAMAGUCHI (through translator):  Now, I feel like the two of us are working together to bring happiness to others. It's our way of giving back to all 
 
 the fans who love and support Kitty.
 
MONTGOMERY (voice-over):  As for their striking resemblance, Yamaguchi says Kitty is the copycat.
 
YAMAGUCHI (through translator):  Because I was born before her.
 
MONTGOMERY (voice-over):  Hello Kitty may be small, but her impact on the world is anything but.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHATTERLEY:  Meow. It could be happy birthday in cat. We'll see you tomorrow.
