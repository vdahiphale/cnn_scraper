THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  New York College.
 
Every time you get on that track and field, what's it like for you?
 
SADIE SCHREINER, TRANSGENDER ATHLETE:  It's stressful. There's an extra level of nervousness and caution, because there's always someone outside who is kind of rooting against me. Sometimes there's a group of protesters. It's a bit of a mixed bag because I like to celebrate when I do better, but then I have to immediately prepare myself for the backlash. 
 
GINGRAS:  That backlash was front and center this election. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Kamala even supports letting biological men compete against our girls in their sports.
 
GINGRAS:  With Republicans reportedly spending more than $200 million on anti-trans ads. 
 
Now President-elect Trump promising his administration will prioritize a federal ban. 
 
DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENT-ELECT:  We will keep men out of women's sports. 
 
GINGRAS:  According to an organization that advocates for LGBTQ equality in sports, fewer than 40 of the NCAA's more than 500,000 athletes are known to be openly transgender, even fewer are transwomen athletes. 
 
SCHREINER:  There are so few of us that are actually setting any records, that are actually doing anything of worth that people will take those individual moments and blow it up and out of proportion to create fear out of nothing. And my biggest fear is that someone is going to try and attack me while I'm on the field. 
 
GINGRAS:  But some Democrats are also wrestling with what rights they should have. Democratic Congressman Seth Moulton telling "The New York Times" recently, "I have two little girls. I don't want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete." What do you say to the people who maybe have complete empathy for your
 
 situation, right, want you to be your authentic self, but have a daughter that they don't want competing against you? 
 
SCHREINER:  If you want me to be my authentic self, then you probably wouldn't also be scared to have your daughter compete against me. No one is at risk. Part of the problem is it's been so politicized that being trans is not different than being a cisman. 
 
GINGRAS:  What do people not realize taking that medication does to your body? 
 
SCHREINER:  My body conducts itself, produces muscle, produces bodyfat, even just how my bones work, it is fundamentally changed because of my hormones. I'm now slower than I was in middle school. 
 
GINGRAS:  Schreiner says she tries to tune out the critics and is hoping to transfer to a division one school, but with more states banning transwomen from competing, it's proving nearly impossible. 
 
SCHREINER:  This isn't like I just can't go to Texas. This is like I can't go to half of the country. 
 
GINGRAS:  What is your hope to actually get accomplished? 
 
SCHREINER:  ideal world is one where were not even an issue and were just something that get to exist and get to do as we want without restrictive legislation, without the fear of violence.

OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  The picks are in, almost all of them. Donald Trump wasting virtually no time filling out his cabinet for his second presidential term. Now he's got to get them all confirmed. We're going to have the latest on the contentious hearings that potentially lie ahead.
 
And one of the, quote, worst telecom hacks in our nation's history, phone calls, texts spied on. We're going to tell you what we know this morning about a Chinese cyber espionage campaign that targeted top U.S. political figures. 
 
And a record setting journey to the stars. The 100th woman to fly to outer space joins us to discuss her milestone mission. 
 
I'm Omar Jimenez with Kate Bolduan. John and Sara are out. This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL. 
 
KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR:  It was like job announcement palooza this weekend. If you blinked, you likely missed one, as the president-elect filled out pretty much all of the major cabinet positions left, with only a few positions left open. His cabinet is basically filled out. And with that, the focus very quickly shifts from deciding who to pick to deciding how to get them all confirmed. The confirmation process that could take months and a process that typically includes FBI background checks. But the Trump team has yet to file necessary paperwork to get the FBI
 
 to conduct those standard reviews. Trump's transition team has so far bypassed that step, instead using private companies to conduct vetting before announcing some candidates, something one Democratic senator on the Judiciary Committee says is a major problem.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR, (D-MN):  If they keep delaying on these background checks, we will have a delay in getting these cabinet officials in. And I don't want to have a delay. I want to have the hearings. I want to make a decision on each one of them on the merits, as I've done in the past. And I can't do that without the background checks. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOLDUAN:  CNN's Alayna Treene joining us now with much more on this. And you are getting new reporting this morning, Alayna, on what Donald Trump's team, what they are focused on right now.
 
ALAYNA TREENE, CNN POLITICAL REPORTER:  That's right. And you're exactly right, Kate. I mean, Donald Trump moved incredibly quickly, far quicker than we've seen many past president-elects, people in his position move to really fill out his core cabinet and get his firm picks in place. 
 <br>[08:05:09]
 
And now with just only a couple cabinet picks left a lot of the attention at Mar-a-Lago is turning to how they can give assurances for some of the more controversial picks, and working with senators to make sure that they can go through their Senate confirmation processes. 
 
Now, one thing I've been learning is that some of these different people have been staffing up on their own. They're starting to broaden out the people who will be helping kind of shepherd them through that Senate confirmation process. We know RFK Jr. has hired Katie Miller. She is someone who, she's married to Stephen Miller, I should say, the deputy chief of staff for policy, or incoming deputy chief of staff for policy. But she also worked and led communications for Mike Pence in the last administration. Other examples of that are also taking shape. We're seeing a lot of the attention now really turn to how they can get these people installed, rather than just being appointed nominees. 
 
There's a couple of Donald Trump's picks that have been viewed as the most controversial, things that I know Donald Trump's team recognizes and are working on behind the scenes. That includes people like Tulsi Gabbard, who many people we've heard over the weekend kind of sharing their concerns over her ties to foreign leaders or her visits with foreign leaders that are deemed as, quote-unquote, enemies of the United States. But also the way that she views surveillance and her skepticism of some of the surveillance practices that have been pretty traditional here in government. Then you also have Pete Hegseth, Donald Trump's pick to lead the
 
 Department of Defense. He is someone that many people in the Senate have argued may not be completely qualified for this. They've been questioning his credentials for the role. But also, of course, there is that police report that was published last week, or excuse me, released, that people had obtained, different media outlets, that kind of caught the Trump team off guard, detailing sexual assault allegations against him. 
 
So there's a lot of controversy around some of these picks. And Donald Trump's team now recognizes they need to do the work before these hearings become public and really before they begin in earnest to make sure that people are feeling assuaged about whether or not these people are in the right jobs for some of these roles. Kate? 
 
BOLDUAN:  Alayna Treene, thank you so much.
 
Omar? 
 
JIMENEZ:  All right, joining us now is CNN's senior political analyst Mark Preston. Good to see you. Now, look, both "Axios" and "New York Times" are reporting that this will be one of, if not the most ideologically diverse cabinets. And just, I wonder how do you see that actually playing out realistically? 
 
MARK PRESTON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  I think it plays out differently for different paths. For instance, Robert F. Kennedy's nomination to lead healthcare at HHS is going to have opposition from Democrats certainly, but also some Republicans, perhaps, right. We talked about his views on abortion and really, the those on the hard right are certainly concerned about that. 
 
You look at someone like Tulsi Gabbard, again, a Democrat. I was -- I remember being with her backstage during the Democratic debates. And now she has embraced MAGA, and concerns about whether or not she's been compromised as we heard Senator Duckworth tell Dana Bash yesterday on CNN.
 
Then, of course, you've got someone like Lori Chavez-DeRemer. She's considered to be a pro-labor Republican. She has co-sponsored very favorable labor legislation. 
 
And then, of course, at the end is Pete Hegseth, you know, drip, drip, drip, that we keep hearing about this incident from 2017, this alleged sexual assault. 
 
This is the reason why it's so diverse. It's diverse because these are folks who to the point haven't been vetted by the FBI, but they haven't taken traditional paths in politics necessarily. They've all come at it a little bit differently, or they've done it a little bit differently. 
 
JIMENEZ:  And you know, being considered by the Trump transition team is one thing, to even be appointed, or nominated, I should say, to even get to this point. But then, of course, you've got to be confirmed. And while I think a big question has been, all right, which Republicans are going to go here, which Republicans are going to go there, we have started to see some signs that some Democrats are supporting some of who has been nominated, or at the very least, are open to it. I mean, what is the Democrats' role in this confirmation fight if they're in the minority? 
 
PRESTON:  Well, they play two roles. One, they play the role as the minority and try to trip up everything that they can out of the president's nominees from the political standpoint of things. I know people don't like hearing that, but politics is a sport. I mean, the reality is it's one person against another person, one ideology against another ideology. 
 
But in addition to that, though, in order for our government to function, they are going to have to support and very likely will support several of these nominees, nominees such as Marco Rubio, somebody who they've worked with for many, many years in the United States Senate, someone like him.
 <br>[08:10:05]
 
So, look, the Democrats are going to have a very difficult time, and it's going to be very frustrating for them. A lot of people think that Donald Trump has lost because Matt Gaetz is out at this point. But Matt Gaetz was just -- was just another Matt, I like to say, in government. The fact of the matter is Donald Trump can put any of these people, or put anybody into these cabinet positions. As long as they do what he tells them to do, it doesn't matter who's in there.
 
JIMENEZ:  And one of the storylines we've seen in this process as well is, of course, whether the FBI will actually conduct background checks on some of these folks is something that the Trump transition team has to agree to. They haven't, to this point. And we've seen folks like Senator Amy Klobuchar, but also really in a bipartisan basis, call for this. I mean, politically what -- why wouldn't you do something like this, especially if your audience is going to be the U.S. Senate? 
 
PRESTON:  Well, a couple of things. The FBI is eventually going to do it, or do some of it anyway, because the United States Senate is going to ask for it. What this is going to do is that it's going to slow things down because a lot of this groundwork won't be done. Can you imagine the FBI starts looking into some of the backgrounds of these folks until they get an official ask from Congress? I mean, that would be devastating to them. But what it does show is the deep distrust of Washington and Donald Trump's deep distrust, his personal distrust, of the intelligence state, so to speak. He doesn't trust the FBI, doesn't trust the CIA, doesn't trust anybody in government. 
 
JIMENEZ:  And we could see that manifested in a potential appointment for the head of the FBI. But that's a long way coming at this point. Mark Preston --   
 
PRESTON:  There's a lot more on the --  
 
JIMENEZ:  Always. 
 
PRESTON:  There's a lot on the plate, Omar. JIMENEZ:  Always, always. Mark Preston, good to see you. 
 
All right, everyone, still to come, the Menendez brothers head back to court for the first time in decades after being convicted of killing their parents. But could this be the first step to freedom for them? We'll explain. 
 
And the dire warning from a U.S. senator over a Chinese cyberattack targeted top political figures, including Donald Trump and J.D. Vance.
 
Plus, a university student in Washington state walked away unharmed after a huge tree fell on his car -- you see this picture here -- pinning him inside. We're going to have his amazing survival story coming up.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[08:16:38]
 
KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR: This morning, the Menendez brothers are set to make their first public court appearance in nearly 30 years.
 
Erik and Lyle Menendez are expected to appear virtually for what is a status hearing, but it seems to represent so much more than that in this moment.
 
The hearing involves the habeas corpus petition filed by their attorneys last year asking for a review of new evidence not presented in their original trials.
 
Now, they are both serving life sentences without the possibility of parole for the murder of their parents back in the 80s. You, of course remember this case.
 
Joining us right now, CNN legal analyst, Joey Jackson.
 
This is interesting where this is because this is separate from the resentencing request that we heard about so much from the now outgoing district attorney in LA. This is a separate -- that move could have ended with the brothers being almost resentenced or even immediately let out of prison.
 
Walk me through what this habeas corpus hearing is.
 
JOEY JACKSON, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: Sure, Kate. Good morning to you.
 
So what happens is habeas corpus, what does that mean?
 
BOLDUAN: What does it mean?
 
JACKSON: It is that, they are detained improperly and should be sprung in essence, right? So what happens is that a status conference, what you're going to learn is where are we? The judge is going to want to know what's the universe of how things look and what does that mean?
 
Since the petition was filed by the outgoing prosecutor, there is an incoming prosecutor who is set to take office on December 2nd, and as a result, that incoming prosecutor may have a lot to say with respect to whether they should be freed.
 
So I think the judge wants to get a sense of whether the incoming prosecutor has evaluated the totality of the file. What more time do you need? Will you be supportive or not? I think its maybe too early to tell.
 
BOLDUAN: Yes.
 
JACKSON: Incoming prosecutor said, he wants to review transcripts, meet with the families, take a look at things. But certainly all indications are December 11th, the incoming prosecutor said he wants to hold firm to that date, which would be the actual hearing with regard to whether they should be sprung or not from jail.
 
A lot of support they are getting from celebrities, family itself has mixed reviews, some within the own family say its cold blooded. Keep them in. And of course, the DA and others say the time has come.
 
New evidence suggesting that there was this abuse there, and as a result of the abuse, perhaps it is time to look anew at whether they've served their time, 35 years plus, and whether that would be appropriate.
 
BOLDUAN: When you talk about the evidence that -- this new evidence that the defense says it bolsters their allegation that sexual abuse was at play here and was the motivation for their actions, this was evidence that was not presented at either of the two trials.
 
What does the judge need to consider with this now?
 
JACKSON: So what happens is, is that a lot has changed since then, right? This brief timeline. We know what happened in 1989, right? That is the murders. They are then arrested in 1990. Right? It was a mob hit et cetera.
 
They go to trial initially, Kate, and when they went to trial in '93, there was this evidence presented of sexual abuse. The jury hung, right? They both had separate juries. The jury is hung.
 
When it was re-presented in another case in '95, that evidence of sexual abuse, a lot of it was kept out. As a result of that, they were then convicted, so here we are.
 
The judge now has to evaluate and looking at this new evidence, whether or not the sexual abuse played enough of a role. It does not excuse it, but it is what we lawyers, fancy term called "mitigation." Does it explain why you acted in that way? And the judge is going to look at punishment, deterrence, and rehabilitation. Is the punishment of 35 years, is that appropriate? Have they been significantly rehabilitated?
 <br>[08:20:10]
 
That was what the DA said, the district attorney, that they've done a lot in jail. They've got multiple degrees. They've helped other prisoners.
 
So perhaps, rehabilitation will carry really the day here and say, we're okay, you're good. You can let out. You've helped so many people. Youve educated yourself.
 
And then of course, deterrence. Is this enough of a deterrence for other people not to commit crimes knowing you might be out 35 years later?
 
BOLDUAN: The one thing that has remained -- continue to stick out to me is the outgoing DA in October said that there is no question that a jury today would look at this case probably very differently than a jury did 35 years ago. That's what you're talking about here.
 
But if that is a consideration as part of what could potentially lead to a resentencing for these men, what could it mean for other cases from around -- other cases and other convictions -- that continues to -- that's it?
 
JACKSON: That's a critical point. It could mean a lot because, you know times and circumstances change, right? Just public opinion changes.
 
We've had the #MeToo Movement, right? Women, I am mad as heck. I'm not going to take it anymore. And there is a feeling that it doesn't excuse, right, the fact that there were two killings here of the mother and father, but it explains the mindset. And so the difference in circumstance is that look, sexual abuse is not a good thing, right? Not appropriate, never appropriate.
 
I think the feeling is such that if that did occur and there is evidence which suggests it did, perhaps we should look at the case anew and render a sentence proportionate to what occurred back then.
 
But other cases, as a result, to be clear, could be reopened with the same argument as to again not excusing any murder, but certainly going to explain the mindset and maybe getting a sentence proportionate to what actually occurred --
 
BOLDUAN: Super interesting. Let's see. Let's see what comes of today, and then December 11th especially. We'll be back at it. Thank you so much, Joey.
 
JACKSON: Thank you, Kate, always.
 
So a long running Chinese cyber-espionage campaign and one that has targeted some of the most senior US political figures in the country, now, telecom executives are getting involved to try and help them boost defenses.
 
And it was a blockbuster weekend at the box office and a weekend that has spawned a new super hype movie duo, "Glicked." "Wicked" and "Gladiator II" coming together for one big opening weekend.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[08:26:27]
 
OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN ANCHOR: New this morning, concerns are growing over a long running Chinese cyber-espionage campaign that has targeted some of the most senior US political figures.
 
People briefed on the matter tell CNN that Chinese hackers have been able to get deep inside some major telecom providers to spy on phone calls and text messages. Senator Mark Warner, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee told CNN the hack is by far the worst telecom hack in our nation's history. The full scope of it though, is still being investigated.
 
Joining me now is Chris Krebs, chief intelligence officer for SentinelOne. He is also the former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency in the Department of Homeland Security, the first director of CISA, I should add.
 
Thanks for being here.
 
Look, I just want to pick up on where Senator Warner, his comments because he described it as by far the worst telecom hack in our nation's history. Do you agree with that assessment? I mean, how do you see this?
 
CHRISTOPHER KREBS, FORMER UNITED STATES DIRECTOR OF THE CYBERSECURITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY AGENCY: I do agree.
 
I think it is a significant penetration of the US telecommunications networks, but it is part of a much larger, much broader infiltration of US critical infrastructure.
 
JIMENEZ: I think right on cue there, I think we still have you -- as soon as you started talking, your screen went out, so hopefully that's just a normal technical difficulty.
 
Chris, if you can still hear me, from where I sit, do you see this vulnerability as a failure of telecommunications companies, the regulators, the US intelligence agencies? I mean, where can you improve sort of the defense infrastructure here if you're sort of assessing what we've seen so far?
 
KREBS: I think the issue is that in the United States, cybersecurity is a team sport, and it is a very cliche term that we've been throwing around in the industry for decades now.
 
But the regulatory authorities do not extend far enough to really adamantly require security posture from a range of critical infrastructure. Instead, we have a corporate responsibility.
 
I think that is in part what you're seeing right now. You're seeing the White House call senior executives from telcos in saying, hey, what help do you need? What more do you need from us? What more can we provide to you? And I think that is going to be the real challenge going into the next administration is how do you balance regulation? How do you balance the responsibility of industry and social and corporate responsibility to get those security outcomes we want? Because, look China is super aggressive here. They are preparing for war and what are we doing to rise to the challenge?
 
JIMENEZ: Chris, we are going to try to refresh your signal to get you back in a second here, but over this campaign season, you know, we saw a lot of this. And you know, if you just look at the Trump side of things, Todd Blanche, one of Trump's lead attorneys had his cell phone tapped by Chinese hackers, but also Chinese government linked hackers also targeted the phone communications of Donald Trump and JD Vance.
 
Obviously, there is a lot of attention when it comes to a presidential election, but do you see this as just the new reality of cyber espionage? That this dynamic not only will be prevalent, but should really be expected at this point?
 
KREBS: Well, I think you have to separate it into a couple different things, but to your first point, there is a large espionage component here that is just steady state. This is what intelligence services do.
 
They hack into networks, they try to get information on political figures, political candidates, leaders in the State Department, the intelligence community, the finance -- the Treasury Department. That is steady state and should be expected, we have to prepare for that. We have to do better securing our networks.
 
There is a larger component here. As I mentioned, China is preparing for war. They are looking to infiltrate our most critical of infrastructures -- the power grid, the water systems, yes, the telco systems.
 
So that if they do make a design or a decision to move on Taiwan and as President Xi has said, he wants to be ready to move militarily by 2027, that they can fire a first shot that's digital. They don't have to go to war with US, instead, they can knock us off our posture and our position so that we can't rise to the challenge to go support Taiwan and the war is effectively over before it starts.
 
So that again is the real challenge here politically in Congress and in the White House: Can we secure ourselves so that they can't take us down?
