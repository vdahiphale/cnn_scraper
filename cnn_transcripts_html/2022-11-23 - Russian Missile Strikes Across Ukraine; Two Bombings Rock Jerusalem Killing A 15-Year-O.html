<br>[14:00:00] 
 
ISA SOARES, HOST, ISA SOARES TONIGHT:  A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, a brutal day of Russians strikes cause 
 
 misery in Ukraine as millions though in the country go without power for yet another day. I'll be speaking to W.H.O. who are on the ground in Dnipro 
 
 about conditions there.   
 
Then devastation in Jerusalem as a teenager dies in what police call a combined terror attack. We're live there with the very latest for you. 
 
 Plus, a shock victory for Japan at the World Cup as the team beat Germany 2-1. We'll be digging into all the action on and off the pitch from Doha.   
 
But first, Russian missiles rained down on multiple Ukrainian cities on Wednesday, and that included Kyiv. And it was one of the largest attacks 
 
 yet. Ukraine's military calls it a large scale attack on crucial infrastructure facilities. The military says the Russian side launched as 
 
 many as 70 missiles, and that the majority of them were shot down.   
 
But not all. Police say a residential building in the capital was hit, killing at least four people. Every region in the country is now seeing 
 
 power outages because of these attacks, every region. It is forcing authorities to shut down nuclear plants and suspend the capital's water 
 
 supply. There was also a Russian strike in the Zaporizhzhia region.   
 
Officials say a maternity hospital was hit and a newborn baby was killed. Our senior international correspondent Matthew Chance is in Odessa for us 
 
 this evening. And Matthew, I mean, the picture I'm just painting -- I've just painted is pretty dire. It seems situation on the ground is getting 
 
 colder, darker and more brutal. Just give us a sense of what you are seeing there.   
 
MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, I mean, just look at the situation here, I'm talking to you right here from one of 
 
 Ukraine's major cities, the city of Odessa, and it's almost complete blackness behind me. The whole city has been without power for some hours 
 
 now, obviously people have generators, is why they're sort of ad hoc needs. 
 
But you know, the infrastructure is really creaking under this sort of blanket of Russian bombardment of missiles that have been taking place not 
 
 just over the course of the day, but over the course of the past couple of weeks, really targeting the energy infrastructure and the water 
 
 infrastructure of the Odessa region and of areas across the country. 
 
There have been power outages, power cuts as far away as Lviv in the far west of the country, as far as you can go essentially away from the war 
 
 zone. This is a national crisis that Ukraine is facing as a direct result of these constant Russian missile attacks on energy infrastructure targets.   
 
Of course, some of the missile strikes other things as well, we saw that in Zaporizhzhia earlier today with a maternity ward being hit by a Russian 
 
 rocket with devastating effects. There are -- you know, the doctor -- a young mother was pulled from the rubble, but a small baby, just two days 
 
 old couldn't be saved.  
 
That's another tragedy in this ongoing conflict. And of course, those horrific scenes from around the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, as well, with a 
 
 rocket striking a residential building there with dozens of people either injured or killed. So, that's, you know, an extraordinary -- another 
 
 example of the human impact that these rocket attacks, these missile strikes are having on the people of Ukraine. Isa. 
 
SOARES:  Just tragedy after tragedy really. And given as you've laid out there, Matthew, the barrage of missiles and the conditions. Do you think, 
 
 from those you've been speaking to on the ground, that we'll see more desperate families leaving Ukraine. What are the options here?   
 
CHANCE:  Isa, I'm so sorry, I couldn't -- I couldn't hear you there. Could you just quickly repeat that question --    
 
SOARES:  Absolutely. I'm just saying, given -- 
 
CHANCE:  There was somebody I was speaking to -- 
 
SOARES:  Given the -- absolutely, given the barrage of missiles that, you know, we have seen in Ukraine really in the past day or so, in the last 
 
 month, even.   
 <br>[14:05:00] 
 
Do you think from those you've spoken to on the ground, Matthew, that there will be more desperate families leaving Ukraine. What are their options at 
 
 this stage?   
 
CHANCE:  Yes, well, I mean, in fact, you know, the authorities here are in some ways encouraging people to leave. Certainly, you know, ahead of one of 
 
 the major power generation companies in the country, has said that, look, it would be helpful to the country if people have the means of leaving for 
 
 the next few months when energy demand is at its highest than they should look   at the possibility of doing so.   
 
But of course, that's not an option for millions of Ukrainians. And of course, there are a lot of efforts underway to try and, you know, first of 
 
 all reconnect the electricity supply and repair the damage, bits of infrastructure that had been hit by missiles. 
 
The governments also announced the opening that they haven't all been opened yet, of centers where people can go in towns and cities, and you 
 
 know, do -- you know, get some heating, you know, use phone lines or the internet and do some cooking or get some hot meals.  
 
Those are the kinds of facilities that are being opened. As an emergency stopgap to prevent people from -- I think it's fair to say, you know, 
 
 freezing to death or starving. You know, during what will be if these attacks continue, an extremely tough Winter confronting the Ukrainian 
 
 people.   
 
SOARES:  Matthew Chance and team there for us in Odessa, Ukraine, thank you very much, Matthew. Well, I spoke with Rafael Grossi; director-general of 
 
 the International Atomic Energy Agency. I asked him about the damage his team saw at the Zaporizhzhia power plant in Ukraine and the potential risk 
 
 to nuclear safety.   
 
Remember, the plant was targeted of sorts over the weekend with various missiles. This is what he had to say. Have a listen.    
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
RAFAEL GROSSI, DIRECTOR-GENERAL, INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY:  As we reported, there has been -- there has been some damage. Fortunately, the 
 
 basic safety and security systems were not affected. But there were a couple of hits that were of particular concern. For example, one very near 
 
 the dry storage area where the spent fuel storied and another one impacting the roof of a hole where fresh fuel is stored. 
 
So quite dangerous situations there. But the plant in as much as one can use the word normal, is in normal operation within the current parameters, 
 
 which is what we call in the jargon coal shut down. Which means that it is not at the moment producing electricity or energy for the grid, but it is 
 
 operating at a very low level enough for restart at the right time.   
 
SOARES:  And of course, our viewers will know this, because we've reported it on the show, that both Kyiv and Moscow really blaming each other for the 
 
 attacks. You said that whoever was responsible for the attacks was quote, "playing with fire". Who here is playing with fire, Mr. Grossi?   
 
GROSSI:  Well, it is very difficult for us to identify from inside the plant who is doing that. And by the way, our main goal is to get this to 
 
 stop, not to get into a game of attribution, which for us would be extremely difficult. What we are doing at the moment, and what I'm doing at 
 
 the moment, I'm conducting and I have been doing this for a few months already.  
 
I'm conducting consultations with the Ukrainian government, with the Russian government in order to establish a security zone around the plant. 
 
 So whoever is doing this stops doing it.   
 
SOARES:  Let's talk about how we can get this to stop. The Kremlin said there has been no substantial progress on discussions about safety zone. 
 
 And they added there had been -- no, there are no Russian heavy weapons on the territory. I understand -- you can correct me if I'm wrong here, Mr. 
 
 Grossi, that you have met with the Russian delegation. What did they tell you? How far are you from achieving that goal?   
 
GROSSI:  Well, yes, I have just met with a Russian delegation in Turkey. And I have also spoken the day before yesterday with Foreign Ministry 
 
 Dmitry(ph) -- I'm taking -- you know, I'm having consultations with both. And I would not agree to that -- on the assessment that we are not making 
 
 any progress. I think we are.   
 
Of course, we are talking about something which is very difficult. This is -- this is war. This is real war. And protection zone that I am proposing 
 
 is precisely on the front line.   
 <br>[14:10:00] 
 
On the line where both adversaries are in contact. Which means that this is an active combat zone, therefore, getting to agreed parameters for this is 
 
 not such an easy thing to do. But we are -- we are moving forward I believe, and I hope that episodes as traumatic as the ones this past 
 
 weekend may paradoxically help us move forward in the sense that people need to realize that we are -- we cannot continue counting on good luck to 
 
 avoid a nuclear accident.   
 
SOARES:  Let's leave Ukraine if I could for just a moment and focus on Iran. I understand that Iran is enriching uranium to a level closer really 
 
 to weapons-grade material. What more can you tell us and how concerned is the IAEA here?   
 
GROSSI:  Well, this has been happening for some -- quite some time already. Iran is enriching uranium at different degrees of enrichment, 5 percent, 20 
 
 percent and 60 percent, which is not far from weapons-grade which happens to be around 90 percent or a little bit more than that. We have been -- we 
 
 are inspecting Iran.
 
The problem that we are having is that our visibility in the Islamic Republic has been reduced in the course of the past few months after Iran 
 
 decided to cease to implement some voluntary additional measures that we had agreed to some time ago. So, this reduction on the inspection activity 
 
 coupled with what you are just saying.  
 
Meaning that they are enriching more and more and more. Of course, it's a source of legitimate concern for us because we believe that, you know, as 
 
 much as they can get into this enrichment activities, they must be aware of the fact that they are -- of course, there are consequences for that. There 
 
 is a degree of uncertainty. 
 
And the IAEA has to have the full picture of what is happening in order to give some credible assurances that there is no deviation for non-peaceful 
 
 uses. And at the moment, we are not having, I would say, the degree of dialogue and understanding that I would like to have.   
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
SOARES:  And that was Rafael Grossi; the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency speaking to me earlier. Now, around 20 minutes or so, I'll be 
 
 speaking with Europe's regional director at the World Health Organization. He's in Dnipro in Ukraine to really assess the brutal conditions and health 
 
 care risks the country faces as it heads into the Winter. So stay with us for that in about 20 minutes or so.
 
Now, Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid is vowing to find those responsible for double-bombing in Jerusalem today, calling them heinous terrorists. 
 
 Explosive devices went off at two bus stops about 30 minutes apart. A 15- year-old boy was killed in the first blast, hundreds of mourners gathered for his funeral hours later as you can see there. Police say there hasn't 
 
 been a coordinated attack like this in Jerusalem in years. Our Hadas Gold has more.   
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
 
(SIREN BLARING) 
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Sirens ring out during rush hour after a double-bombing shook Jerusalem Wednesday morning. 
 
 A 15-year-old student was killed and more than 14 injured, and what authorities are calling a suspected coordinated combined terror attack. The 
 
 first explosion captured on CCTV footage widely shared on social media, rocking a bus station at one of the main entrances to the city.   
 
The blast so strong, debris and pockmarks reaching past three lanes of traffic. Authorities believe a bag or package was placed at the bus stop 
 
 around 7:00 a.m. and was likely detonated remotely. The first blast killing the teenage boy, a Canadian-Israeli citizen who was a student at a Jewish 
 
 religious school, and injuring at least 11 others.   
 
A second blast occurred not far from the first around half an hour later at the city's remote junction, lightly injuring three people. A spokesman for 
 
 first responders at the scene telling CNN the injuries inflicted showed the hallmarks of terror.   
 
RAPHAEL POCH, SPOKESPERSON, UNITED HATZALAH INTERNATIONAL:  There were track-blotches(ph) and the nails and ball bearings and those types of 
 
 things, which, you know, very common to be placed in bombs that detonate for the sake of terror. We're definitely a factor as well.   
 
GOLD:  The incident reminiscent of the style of attacks carried out in the second Intifada organized and technically sophisticated.   
 
POCH:  This is something very tragic. And it's something we haven't seen in a very long time, and we hope it doesn't come back to become a routine or a 
 
 regular situation.   
 
GOLD:  Israel's Prime Minister Yair Lapid also noting the worrying development.    
 
YAIR LAPID, PRIME MINISTER, ISRAEL (through translator):  This event is different from what we have seen in recent years. An extensive Intelligence 
 
 effort is now underway that will lead us to find these heinous terrorists, those behind them and those who provided them with weapons.   
 <br>[14:15:00] 
 
GOLD:  As Israeli police search for suspects, the man pushing to become Public Security Minister in the incoming government arrived at the scene. 
 
 The far-right leader Itamar Ben-Gvir calling for sweeping security measures in response 
 
ITAMAR BEN-GVIR, JEWISH POWER PARTY LEADER:  Charging a price for the terror means checking where these terrorists came from, reaching their 
 
 villages, whether they are in Israel or in Judea and Samaria, imposing a curfew, going from house to house and searching for weapons and bringing 
 
 back deterrence and governance.   
 
GOLD:  A deadly escalation in what's already been one of the most violent years in this region since the days of the second Intifada as fears grow 
 
 that this attack will bring more.   
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
SOARES:  And Hadas Gold joins me now live from Jerusalem with more. And Hadas, as we heard there in your report, police believe this was carried 
 
 out by a well organized cell. Any idea from police who may be behind this at this stage?   
 
GOLD:  We've been -- we've received no indication from police pointing the finger towards any sort of militant group. What we have heard from Hamas 
 
 and Palestinians on the Jihad and Hezbollah, they've praised the attack, but none of them have taken credit for it, although police have called it a 
 
 well organized, well orchestrated attack.   
 
And that it takes a level of technical sophistication to plant these bombs at these sites. They say that whoever planted the bombs knew the area well, 
 
 and to have them detonate remotely by cellphone, this was clearly well- planned. They said that the bombs are packed full of ball bearings and nails, things like that to cause the maximum amount of damage.  
 
What's also interesting Isa, in the last hour or so, there's actually been a gag order placed by authorities here towards the media reporting anything 
 
 -- any new developments in this investigation, obviously, the sensitivity of the investigation. They're probably trying to not alert whoever they're 
 
 after if the media gets any sort of tips on that.   
 
But so far, all they're telling us is that it was a well organized, well planned out, and whoever carried this out likely knew the area very well. 
 
 And as we've heard from authorities, this is a sort of attack that this region has not seen for several years. And this sort of well-planned 
 
 attack, it's for many people bringing back memories of the second Intifada when -- 
 
SOARES:  Yes -- 
 
GOLD:  Suicide bombings and bombs at bus stations and at restaurants were a regular occurrence. And we've been reporting as you know, for months about 
 
 just the rising tensions here just getting worse and worse. And the kindling is so dry for just something even more major to explode. And then 
 
 what we saw today is what so many people have been fearing.   
 
Also that also, of course, what will be the Israeli authority response to all of this? Will we see even greater, bigger military operations in the 
 
 West Bank or potentially Gaza? Everything right now is very much unknown and very tenuous, because, you know, typically, when we've seen attacks 
 
 this past year, the Israeli authorities know who it is quite quickly. They catch them quite quickly or something like that.  
 
But in this situation, so far, they're not giving any indication of who may be behind this or if they have any idea where they are.   
 
SOARES: I know you'll stay on top of this for us. Hadas Gold for us there in Jerusalem. Thanks very much, Hadas, good to see you. Now, investigators 
 
 are trying to learn why a Wal-Mart manager shot and killed six people, then himself in the U.S. state of Virginia. The shooting happened inside the 
 
 store on Tuesday night, at least, four people are in hospital at this time.   
 
This year, there have been 606 -- as you can see there, mass shootings in the U.S. That's so far this year. That is according to the Gun Violence 
 
 Archive which tracks the shootings. The number of these attacks has surged over the past four years. In 2018, as you can see, there were over 300 mass 
 
 shootings or 336 to be exact, and that number nearly doubled in 2020, and more than doubled in 2021.   
 
Pretty worrying picture there. CNN's Dianne Gallagher is live for us in Chesapeake, Virginia. So Dianne, talk us through more about what we know 
 
 about the shooter here and the motive.   
 
DIANNE GALLAGHER, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, you know, Isa, you mentioned the mass shootings in the United States. This is the second in as 
 
 many weeks here in the state of Virginia. Right now, you can probably see some of the fire trucks and agents behind me, sort of processing the scene 
 
 still. 
 
The city confirming what CNN sources had already said, identifying that shooter as 31-year-old Andre Bing. According to Wal-Mart, he had been 
 
 employed with the company since 2010, and he was an overnight team leader. So a manager there. According to survivors who have spoken with various 
 
 media outlets, including CNN, look, he came into the break room and just began shooting.
 
According to the city, they found the bodies of three people including the shooter who they say died from self inflicted gunshot wounds in that break 
 
 room. They found another person deceased at the front of the store, and three others who were taken to the hospital, sadly succumbed to their 
 
 injuries.   
 
Look, we are still trying to piece together what happened here. Law enforcement says that he was armed with a pistol and multiple magazines. 
 
 And again, when talking to survivors and talking to employees, they have said that there was something odd about him. 
 <br>[14:20:00] 
 
One woman who survived the shooting saying that a bullet went just inches away from her when she looked that shooter in the eye, said that when she 
 
 had started here at this Wal-Mart just a few months ago, she was warned, look, he was the manager to look out for. That he always had something 
 
 going on with people. And just sort of not to mess with him. 
 
But she said, she never thought it would be something like this. Isa, we have six people who are not going to spend their Thanksgiving holiday here 
 
 in the United States with their families tomorrow. There were holiday shoppers who were still in that store at the time because the shooting 
 
 happened just before it closed. 
 
Many of these employees who were in the store at the time or those who would stock up the store overnight. Who would make sure that there were 
 
 those supplies in there. And we've seen posts from people talking about what a close-knit group these employees were because of the odd hours that 
 
 they often worked.  
 
And so authorities say they're still working to determine a motive in this situation, and that they're still waiting to identify all of the victims as 
 
 they reach out to those families and try and piece this together at this point, Isa.   
 
SOARES:  Dianne Gallagher for us there, thanks very much, Dianne, appreciate it. And still to come tonight, more upsets, shock results and 
 
 ecstatic fans, we'll go live to Qatar for the latest World Cup drama. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
SOARES:  And it is another day of upsets and surprises at the World Cup as Japan stuns the world against Germany, 2-1 with a powerhouse Spain also in 
 
 the group. Germany's chances of advancing in the tournament just got -- well, that little bit harder. But the matches aren't the only topic of 
 
 discussion today after the German team stage a free speech protest ahead of the game.  
 
As you can see there, the entire team covered their mouths during a team photo. It comes after FIFA barred players for wearing rainbow armbands to 
 
 show solidarity with LGBTQ people in Qatar. CNN's Don Riddell is on the ground in Qatar for us. Don, good to see you. There is a lot going on in 
 
 this World Cup, that's all I'll say. On and off the pitch, look, let's start with the football and the upsets today.   
 
DON RIDDELL, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR:  Yes, it was extraordinary. I keep picking games that are amazing to go and attend, and I went to Germany-Japan today, 
 
 and it was extraordinary. We'll start with the football. A huge win for Japan, but they had to come from behind to do it. 
 <br>[14:25:00] 
 
The Germans doing pretty well in the first half. They had a goal disallowed in the stroke of half-time, they took the lead with the penalty here from 
 
 Ilkay Gundogan. But the game completely was turned on its head in the last 15 minutes, Japan equalizing through Ritsu Doan, very well taken goal 
 
 there. And then they took the lead through Takuma Asano, seven minutes from time. 
 
And this place just erupted when they did that. Look at that finish. Just smashed into the roof of the net, goalkeeper couldn't do very much about 
 
 it, and just the joy amongst the Japanese fans in the stadium and the players on the field was just infectious. This is a huge win for them and a 
 
 massive setback for Germany especially given the fact that in the next match, Spain thrashed Costa Rica 7-0. 
 
Now, at the start of this game, the German team posed for the photograph which they always do at the start of every game, and just for a moment, 
 
 every single one of them put their right hand over their mouths. This is in reference to the fact that FIFA banned them from wearing the one-love 
 
 armband, which is a campaign that promotes inclusivity and is against discrimination of any kind.   
 
As the game was unfolding, the German Football Federation then tweeted this statement including the lines, "human rights are non-negotiable". And 
 
 FIFA's actions had denied -- what? By denying the armband was the same as denying them a voice. The German Interior Minister was inside the stadium 
 
 wearing the armband.   
 
And you know, the reaction from the fans around me once we knew what had happened, because it was hard to tell at the time. It was so far away. I 
 
 spoke to an English supporter, a German supporter. They were thrilled that this had happened. They were absolutely thrilled. 
 
The German fan that I spoke with said that he thought FIFA had made a real mistake by banning the armband, and that this protest might now inspire 
 
 other teams to do something similar. And it's only going to ratchet up the pressure on FIFA and on Qatar.   
 
SOARES:  Yes, I understand that the company, Don, that actually make these armbands in Europe actually sold out of these bands. And that, that says a 
 
 lot. Look, let's look ahead to -- 
 
RIDDELL:  Yes -- 
 
SOARES:  Tomorrow because my eyes will be glued to the screen for the obvious reasons that you all know. Portugal is playing.
 
RIDDELL:  Right -- 
 
SOARES:  But let's talk about Cristiano Ronaldo because obviously, he's left Man United. Has this impacted the team at all? I had a press 
 
 conference where he said no, but please stop asking the other players. What are you hearing?   
 
RIDDELL:  Yes, I mean, it's the same. I mean, I can't imagine he's not had any kind of impact at all. And after the interview dropped a few days ago, 
 
 we did see pictures or video from locker room and from the training pitch, which seems to suggest that some of the teammates were kind of dismissing 
 
 him, kind of brushing him away.  
 
And they didn't kind of want to sort of engage with him in the sort of palli-palli(ph) chat and banter. Then of course, 24 hours ago, the news 
 
 dropped that he parted company with Man United which just reignited the whole story all over again. The team coach Fernando Santos said it's not a 
 
 distraction.  
 
It's not even been discussed. And his international teammate and former club teammate Bruno Fernandes also said it's not that big a deal. Have a 
 
 listen.   
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
BRUNO FERNANDES, PORTUGUESE FOOTBALL PLAYER (through translator):  I don't feel uncomfortable. I don't have to pick a side. It is a privilege to play 
 
 on the national team with Cristiano and at the club too. It was a dream and I've always said that. Cristiano has always been an inspiration for me. So 
 
 it was a dream come true to be able to play with him at the club level.  
 
But we know that nothing lasts forever. As I said, it was great for me and it was good while it lasted. And now Cristiano has taken a different 
 
 decision for his life, for his career, and we have to respect such decisions. Every decision has to be respected regardless of us agreeing or 
 
 not.   
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
RIDDELL:  Portugal's game on Thursday, Isa, will be against Ghana; the African powerhouse, the Black Stars, hoping to become the first African 
 
 team to get a win at this tournament. This time tomorrow we'll know --   
 
SOARES:  Let's hope -- yes, we shall know. I shall be watching. If you don't see me here on this desk, you'll know why? Thanks very much, Don 
 
 Riddell, appreciate it.   
 
RIDDELL:  All right. 
 
SOARES:  And still to come tonight, we'll have more -- much more, of course, on the situation in Ukraine. This Winter, it'd be life-threatening 
 
 for millions of people in the country. I'll be talking with a health expert behind that dire warning. Plus, chaos in China. Workers at the world's 
 
 biggest iPhone factory clashed with police over pay and working conditions. We'll have the latest from Beijing, next.  
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 <br>[14:30:00]
 
(MUSIC PLAYING)
 
SOARES:  Welcome back, everyone. 
 
The World Health Organization says, simply put, the priority in Ukraine this winter will be about survival. It warns that continued attacks have 
 
 left homes, schools and hospitals across the country without fuel, water and electricity. 
 
Just today, Russian missile strikes hit key infrastructures, deepening blackouts amid freezing temperatures. The World Health Organization is 
 
 issuing a critical reminder that cold weather can kill. The group's regional director for Europe is currently in Ukraine to highlight that dire 
 
 situation. Hans Kruge joins me now from Dnipro. 
 
The picture we have been seeing from our correspondents is very dark, very troubling of the reality on the ground. Give us a sense of what you have 
 
 seen. I believe this is your fourth time visiting Ukraine this year. 
 
DR. HANS KLUGE, WHO EUROPE:  Absolutely. You know, I'm an optimist. But I must say it was a bit concerning today, because most of the day was spent 
 
 underground in the bunker because of the missile attacks. 
 
Already, the health system was under tremendous pressure. For, example our teams were in Kherson today and yesterday. And there's literally almost 
 
 nothing left. The fact that surgery could go on is because of all the (INAUDIBLE) of the generator but even in Dnipro, it was the same.
 
There was a blackout at the hospital where the patients with very heavy trauma were undergoing surgery. They were going to run out of electricity 
 
 in three hours. And because of the generator, it could continue. 
 
So the winter will be a massive threat to millions of Ukrainians, due to the fact that maternity wards cannot function without incubators, intensive 
 
 care units cannot function without ventilators and vaccines cannot function without fridges. It's that simple. 
 
SOARES:  This must be, not just be worrying but so difficult for those in Ukraine, trying to keep people alive, trying to keep them warm. 
 <br>[14:35:00]
 
Today we saw Russia targeting energy infrastructure; some 70 missiles or so were launched in Ukraine. 
 
Break down for us, in terms of hospitals, humanitarian access, how is this impacting day to day life here?
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
KLUGE:  Well, I would, say first of all there's one topic which stands out above all. 
 
I apologize. It's a bit difficult to connect. The connection is very severe. We had blackouts the whole day. So I hope that you are hearing me. 
 
 The issue I wanted to convey is that there was one topic, which was standing out of all when I spoke to the prime minister, to the first lady 
 
 or to the foreign peers (ph) going to the front line. 
 
That is the issue of mental health. That is why I wanted to come from Kyiv (INAUDIBLE) to face it myself, that three, four times a, day the bomb 
 
 alerts that create anxiety, create depression. Then I was meeting with the U.N. agencies, the volunteers, going out to the front line and hearing 
 
 these horrific stories of (INAUDIBLE) rape, girls of 6 years (INAUDIBLE) ...

SOARES:  Unfortunately, we seem to have lost your connection. It's quite patchy, as you can imagine. I do hear you. Just finish your thought if you 
 
 would. 
 
Unfortunately, as you can imagine, Mr. Hans Kluge saying that there have been several blackouts throughout the country. He's spent much of his day 
 
 in Ukraine, it's his fourth visit, in bunkers, given the situation on the ground. 
 
But you get a sense of the very worrying dire picture. It's getting darker. It's getting colder. It's getting more brutal for those in Ukraine, 
 
 including those who work in hospitals, trying to provide very basic care. Even surgeries are impossible, even though you have those generators. 
 
You get a sense really just how desperate the situation has been. Today the mayor of Kyiv said the city is bracing for the worst winter since the 
 
 Second World War. To give you an idea how dire and how bleak it is right now in Ukraine. We'll stay on top of the story for you.

SOARES:  In Turkiye, at least 80 people have been injured from an earthquake that struck early this morning. The 5.9 magnitude quake hit the

Now to China. Hundreds of workers at the biggest iPhone plant in China have clashed with police. Foxconn has been wrestling with major disruptions 
 
 since the COVID outbreak last month. Selina Wang has the story for you. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SELINA WANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  The chaos at Apple's largest iPhone assembly factory in central China is getting worse. Video shows hundreds of 
 
 workers streaming out of the factory doors, protesting and clashing with police. Many law enforcement workers are wearing white hazmat suits. 
 
The footage, which has now been censored from Chinese social media, shows protesters complaining about their pay and poor sanitary conditions. This 
 
 followed weeks of turmoil at this factory in China, after a COVID outbreak in mid October. 
 
Workers began complaining subpar living conditions. Videos showed masses of workers fleeing the factories, walking miles along highways escaping COVID 
 
 restrictions. But the factory needs workers especially ahead of the holiday season.
 
So Foxconn said it would give a onetime bonus equivalent to US$ 69 if workers returned. Also they would offer new workers a new salary. Foxconn 
 
 said over 100,000  signed up for this massive recruitment drive. 
 <br>[14:40:00]
 
(voice-over):  But in this recent footage, workers are heard saying that Foxconn failed to keep their promise of a better bonus and a pay package 
 
 after they arrived to work at the plant, accusing the company of changing the salary packages. 
 
Workers said that those who tested positive for COVID were not being separated from the rest of the workforce. In a statement, in English the 
 
 company denied all those organizations and said the dorms that factory workers live in undergo standard procedures for disinfection. 
 
But all of this has been a big blow for Apple. The company warned earlier that shipments of its latest products will be temporarily impacted and 
 
 delayed because of China's COVID restrictions. 
 
It's another reminder of the risk that Apple faces in relying on China for its production. China is still stuck in this unpredictable cycle of 
 
 lockdowns, upending people's lives, China's economy and global business -- Selina Wang, CNN, Beijing.

SOARES:  Still to come, Jair Bolsonaro not leaving without a fight. Brazil's outgoing president challenges the result of last month's election. 
 
 That story just ahead.

SOARES:  Outgoing Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro has challenged the results of the October election. He lost to Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, due 
 
 to take office in January. Joining me now is Stefano Pozzebon.
 
Look, this does not surprise me in the slightest because, leading up to the election, he was really spreading baseless claims that the country's voting 
 
 system, electronic voting system was liable to fraud, even though he won before.
 
What does he want to see here?
 
STEFANO POZZEBON, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  What basically Bolsonaro is saying, they are demanded the election authority to dismiss all the 
 
 votes cast through electronic voting machine dating back from before 2020. 
 
Just to give you an idea of the context we're talking about here, it's about 60 percent of the machines used in this year's election. Perhaps the 
 
 devil is in the detail because his party is requested to dismiss only the votes cast in the second round of the election, which is the around that 
 
 Bolsonaro himself lost as a presidential candidate. 
 
Not in the first round of the election where there were also congressional elections going on. 
 <br>[14:45:00]
 
Bolsonaro's party obtained the largest share of the votes. Basically casting doubt on the rematch, not in the one that had won in the first 
 
 place. Now there is a press conference going on as we speak because the head of the election authority gave the liberal party 24 hours at the end 
 
 of today to explain this position. 
 
Why casting doubt only on the second round of election and not on the first round? 
 
In this press conference, the leader of the liberal party says that the aim, the goal of these requests, these appeals is not to prevent anybody 
 
 from taking office but that they want to be absolutely sure that the election was fair. 
 
Once again, it seems to me that what we're seeing here is that the vote -- the doubt over the results of the election has been cast outside the 
 
 institution. There will be a transition of power. Lula will be -- will take over as president of Brazil on January 1st next year. 
 
But what we're seeing is that just like Trump has done over the last two years, Bolsonaro repeating baseless claims that the election was not fair, 
 
 perhaps to cement his base. Perhaps to cement his leadership as the future leader of the opposition in Brazil, Isa. 
 
SOARES:  What is the Lula camp saying, Stefano?
 
POZZEBON:  Lula is not addressing these latest controversies, if you want to call it that. Lula is perhaps trying to share the image of somebody who 
 
 has already moved beyond the election. He's busy holding talks with international leaders. He was, for example, at COP27 just a few weeks ago. 
 
This morning, Lula tweeted a photo of his cabinet team meeting and addressing the team in order to have his leadership as ready as possible 
 
 when he takes over. So not really addressing the Bolsonaro claims, to be honest. 
 
SOARES:  And that says everything. Stefano there for us. Good to see you. Thank you.
 
We will be back after this short break.

SOARES:  Abu Dhabi is becoming a hot spot for young entrepreneurs. Archireef is one of the many that have made the move. Our Eleni Giokos 
 
 looks at how they're using 3D printed corals to restore underwater worlds. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
(MUSIC PLAYING)
 
ELENI GIOKOS, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  For any successful start-up, there comes a time when it's necessary to expand to 
 
 new markets. And choosing the right location can make or break a company. 
 
With more than 200 islands making up the city, Abu Dhabi was the perfect place for Vriko Yu and Deniz Tekerek to launch their regional headquarters 
 
 for their start-up, Archireef. 
 
DENIZ TEKEREK, CO-FOUNDER, ARCHIREEF (voice-over):  As soon as we landed here, there was an incredible amount of support and one thing led to 
 
 another, essentially. So we ended up seeing a very, very smooth operation from the side of people who were interested in us. 
 
And we were very quickly able to win over clients and win over investors as well. Since then, we decided to really establish some roots here. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Clear. 
 
GIOKOS (voice-over):  Founded in Hong Kong, Archireef's mission to accelerate the recovery of marine ecosystems in our oceans. That is 
 
 achieved by placing these 3D printed tiles on the sea floor. 
 
VRIKO YU, CO-FOUNDER, ARCHIREEF (voice-over):  So for coral to settle in a sea bed, they need to have a stable substrate. But they don't have roots by 
 
 themselves. So what we are creating is basically renovating an inhospitable environment to a livable substrate for coral to regrow. 
 
GIOKOS (voice-over):  The reefs are manufactured and one of Abu Dhabi's industrial areas. This 3D printer, the first of its kind in the world, 
 
 allows the team to print up to seven tiles a day using clay, a material Archireef says is not toxic to ocean life. 
 
Like most companies that move to Abu Dhabi, the founders see the city as the gateway to a wide region, a place where they can build and eventually 
 
 expand from the UAE to the world -- Eleni Giokos, CNN.

SOARES:  Holiday travelers in the U.S. are experiencing far fewer flight cancellations and they were past summer when we were seeing thousands of 
 
 cancellations a day. The hiring boom is a big reason things have gotten better. Our Pete Muntean has the story for you. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PETE MUNTEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Airlines have been preparing for the rush at airports with the rush all their own. Hiring thousands of 
 
 new workers from the front desk to the flight deck; 24-year-old Elie Gull (ph) is about to follow in her dad's footsteps as a new commercial pilot. 
 
ELIE GULL (PH), NEW PILOT:  This is probably one of the best times in history to become a pilot. 
 
MUNTEAN (voice-over):  Elie (ph) is joining Piedmont Airlines which operates thousands of regional flights for American Airlines. At its 
 
 Charlotte training center, 400 new pilots have been trained here since June. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We have real ambitions to grow the airline, to essentially double the size of the airline. 
 
MUNTEAN (voice-over):  Seasoned pilots are also in demand. Piedmont announced 100,000 dollar signing bonus for new captains. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The opportunities have never been better.
 
MUNTEAN (voice-over):  New industry numbers show staffing of the major airlines has now exceeded pre pandemic levels. The hiring blitz comes after 
 
 airlines struggled this summer, canceling 55,000 flights due in part to staffing shortages. 
 
But hiring is happening beyond pilots. American Airlines says it's hired 12,000 employees this year company wide. Southwest Airlines says it has 
 
 hired more than 15,000. At United Airlines, 2,000 new customer service representatives are helping passengers in new ways. 
 
It's called agent on demand. You scan a QR code for a video call. Agents can now connect with a stranded passenger at O'Hare when they're not busy 
 
 at another airport like Dulles. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I think it's going to be a great help, especially now that we're having snow everywhere. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We want to be there for our customers, support them, make it easy, just make them feel good about the trip and take off some of 
 
 the stress. 
 
MUNTEAN (voice-over):  Airlines insist they now have the right people in the right places. Now the pressure is on them to perform. 
 
MUNTEAN:  Are you worried at all?
 
NICK CALIO, CEO, AIRLINES FOR AMERICA:  I'm worried about the weather. I always worry about the weather because that's the number one thing that can 
 
 ruin a flight. I think we're flexible enough now that, if there are cancellations or delays, we will be ready to try to get people to where 
 
 they want to go. 
 
MUNTEAN:  The big question is will all this hiring pay off?
 
It has been smooth so far, which is good news considering how busy things have been here and in airports across the country. The TSA has screened 
 
 about an average of 2.3 million people a day for the last few days. 
 
But the busiest days are still ahead and TSA anticipates screening 2.5 million people on Wednesday, which could be the biggest number we have seen 
 
 since COVID first hit.

The sequel to "Avatar" is coming to cinemas near you soon. During the "Avatar" press tour, James Cameron revealed a very surprising detail about 
 
 one of his most famous projects. Leonardo DiCaprio nearly didn't star alongside Kate Winslet in the tearjerker that was "Titanic." Winslet had 
 
 already been cast as one of the ill-fated lovers when a young DiCaprio was invited to a screen test. 
 
But by then, he had already made a name for himself and even bagged an Oscar nomination and his overconfidence nearly cost him the place in one of 
 
 history's most iconic films. Here is how his meeting with Cameron went down after the young actor learned he had to actually read the lines. This is 
 
 what DiCaprio said. 
 
"You mean I am reading?
 
"I don't read," which Cameron replied, "Well, thanks for coming by." 
 
Luckily for us, if you're a fan of the movie, of course, that wasn't the end of the story. DiCaprio auditioned and, quote, "lit up" as Jack. Reading 
 
 is not bad after all. 
 
Thanks very much for watching CNN. Do stay right here. "QUEST MEANS BUSINESS" is up next. I shall see you tomorrow. Have a wonderful day.
