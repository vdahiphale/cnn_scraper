PAULA NEWTON, CNN ANCHOR: It's 5:00 a.m. in Bangkok, 7:00 a.m. in Tokyo, and 6:00 p.m. here in New York. I'm Paula Newton in for Julia Chatterley. 
 
 And wherever you are in the world, this is your "First Move."
 
And a very warm welcome to "First Move," and here's today's need to know. Ukraine says it's captured about a hundred Russian servicemen as it 
 
 continues its cross-border incursion. A source says Hamas will not join Gaza ceasefire talks as international mediators make an urgent push for a 
 
 deal. Japan's prime minister, Fumio Kishida, says he will step down in September. And yes, still stranded. NASA says it's more than a week away 
 
 from deciding how to bring home two astronauts stuck on the International Space Station. That conversation and much more coming up.
 
But first, Ukraine says its forces are on the move, seizing even more territory as their surprise attack inside Russia enters its ninth day. 
 
 Ukraine's offensive is coming by land and air. A security source says Ukraine used drones to launch its biggest attack on Russian airfields since 
 
 the war began. This says President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says 100 Russian troops have been captured.
 
He says this could help accelerate the return of Ukrainian prisoners of war. He also says he has no intention of annexing seized Russian territory.
 
Some Ukrainian soldiers, meantime, are relishing this chance to finally take the fight to Russian soil. CNN's Fred Pleitgen now on that report -- 
 
 will have that report for us and more.
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A humiliating scene for the Kremlin. Ukrainian troops sweeping through a 
 
 Russian village behind a U.S. supplied MaxPro armored vehicle.
 
Kyiv soldiers taking down the Russian flag in another town, with Ukrainian TV reporting from the scene. Ukraine's top general telling President 
 
 Volodymyr Zelenskyy the advance continues.
 
Troops have advanced one to two kilometers in various directions, he says, and then adds, since the beginning of this day, we've taken captive about a 
 
 hundred enemy soldiers.
 
The Ukrainians say they want to create a buffer zone in this part of Russia to stop Moscow's army from attacking Ukrainian territory in the future. But 
 
 the blitz offensive is also a major morale boost for Ukraine. A commander fighting inside Russia, tells CNN, catching the Russians off guard.
 
They were shocked by such a rapid advance, he says. They were in tactical encounters and willingly surrendered to the defense forces. And then, every 
 
 warrior, every soldier who defends their homeland probably had a dream of stepping onto Russian soil and destroying the enemy there. These feelings 
 
 are impossible to forget.
 
While the Russians claim they are stopping Ukraine's assault, releasing this video of their jets dropping powerful glide bombs, Ukraine says it 
 
 shot down a Russian warplane, and a security source says it launched the biggest drone attack on Russian air bases since the war began.
 
Russian leader Vladimir Putin has vowed a crushing response to Ukraine's incursion, but even Kremlin controlled TV acknowledging that won't be so 
 
 simple.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Unfortunately, I must say that in some settlements, the enemy is holding their ground and we will need to 
 
 fight them out of there. That will not happen as fast and as easy as we want it to.
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over): The Ukrainians have said they will continue to push forward and fortify the gains they've made. Hoping to withstand the massive 
 
 counterattack that the Kremlin has promised.
 
Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Berlin.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
NEWTON: And I want to bring in CNN's chief international security correspondent, Nick Paton Walsh, who is at this hour in Kyiv for us. Nick, 
 
 good to have you there on the ground. It really has been an extraordinary nine -- nearly nine days now.
 
In terms of what you've seen, are Ukraine's intentions any clearer to you right now, especially with this discussion of creating a so-called buffer 
 
 zone?
 
NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Yes, it really isn't clear exactly how extensive this buffer zone will be or quite 
 
 how long Ukraine would intend to keep pushing forwards.
 <br>[18:05:00]
 
Remember today, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that just in the last 24 hours, they'd gained an extra one or two kilometers. They're racking up, 
 
 clearly, a significant number of prisoners of war, but they're also using, as you saw there, this time to hit Russia's airfields at what they call one 
 
 of their largest attacks so far, hitting targets significantly far inside.
 
We're also hearing, though, too satellite images suggesting that Russia is indeed putting in fortifications, reasonably far inside Russia in the hope, 
 
 obviously, to have something they can use to prevent any further Ukrainian advance. Some trenches seen dug near Lgov and Rylsk, which are quite far 
 
 back from the border areas where Ukraine is projecting most of its force for now.
 
But the question of exactly what the Ukrainian longer game here isn't one that has an easy answer to. Yes, they're simultaneously saying they intend 
 
 to not annex these areas, but at the same time too, it's clear they're not planning an immediate withdrawal either. And I think the longer they can 
 
 continue to embarrass the Kremlin, to make the promises that Vladimir Putin is hearing at Kremlin meetings, that this is all halted, all about to be 
 
 overlooked like nonsense, that's an information war game for the Ukrainians, certainly, but it has a practical impact as well.
 
Ukrainian officials are suggesting that from the Zaporizhzhia, from the Kharkiv, from other areas too, even Crimea, some Russian troops are being 
 
 diverted from other tasks there to rush to the Kursk area and try and keep the Ukrainians out. But it will take time probably for Ukraine to sense any 
 
 weakness elsewhere in Russia's front lines and then maybe even exploit that.
 
But above all, we are now so many days in, nine, you say, to this totally surprised push that would have been absolutely unanticipated, frankly, by 
 
 many here in Ukraine as well. And I think it's the ability for Kyiv in a war in which many were seeing them perhaps as on the losing end for many 
 
 months now to show such a remarkable turnaround and inflict such persistent damage and indeed, turn the tables entirely on Russia.
 
The scenes we're seeing here of Russian citizens being offered sanctuary inside of Ukraine, being offered humanitarian aid, often at times 
 
 reminiscent from the early stages of the war that we were seeing when Russia first invaded Ukraine too. And Ukraine using their ability to 
 
 project such power deep inside Russia, to I think remind Moscow that they and the western supplied equipment that they have, can't be taken for 
 
 granted or counted out at all. And I think it's an unexpected turn in this war. What we don't know yet is exactly what Kyiv's longer-term goals and 
 
 plan is for that newly taken territory. Paula.
 
NEWTON: Nick, I have to ask you as well, why the Kremlin's response here hasn't been robust, and it doesn't just have to happen in the Kursk region. 
 
 They have not hit out at cities like Kyiv, at least not in a robust way that you might expect.
 
WALSH: Yes. I mean, you know, to some degree, give them a little more time. You know, we've seen in the past take a while to muster resources. Yes, it 
 
 is certainly a capital city here, which is bracing for the possibility, there might be some sort of intensified missile attack.
 
Remember, they have been under that threat for month after month, depending on the intensity of horrors really Moscow wants to inflict upon here. But 
 
 you have to remember also too, Paula, there is a limit to Vladimir Putin's strength. If there wasn't, then he'd be doing very differently in the 
 
 longer-term war of attrition that we're seeing inside occupied parts of Ukraine.
 
There's only a certain amount that his forces are able to do. Otherwise, they would have advanced faster and taken more territory and be doing even 
 
 better than they currently are. So, he may be finding a combination of things. Officials telling him that things aren't as bad as perhaps they 
 
 are. He may be finding that it takes longer to move forces, to bring them into play, to respond to Ukraine's movement. And above all too, they may be 
 
 stretched quite thin and having to make that very difficult choice between whether they're willing to feel weaker and expose themselves on the larger 
 
 frontline inside of Ukraine in order to project the strength they need in the Kursk area.
 
But really this does, it puts paid to the notion of an impregnable Kremlin that are now leading the narrative in this war in its third year and it's, 
 
 frankly, an enormous embarrassment to a Russian strongman who's always sold himself as being someone who sets the story as they wish. Paula.
 
NEWTON: Yes, incredibly intriguing days ahead in a conflict that Volodymyr Zelenskyy has always said he did not want this to be a frozen conflict that 
 
 it is seems to be no longer. Nick Payton Walsh, good to have you on the ground there. Appreciate it.
 
To the Middle East now and what could be critical negotiations for the region in the coming hours. International mediators are set to convene in 
 
 Qatar in -- on Thursday for talks on a ceasefire for Gaza and the release of Israeli hostages.
 
Now, source says Hamas will not participate, but could talk to mediators afterwards if Israel gives what it calls a serious response to a U.S.-
 
 backed ceasefire plan already on the table. All of this as Israel braces for a potential attack by Iran or its proxies.
 <br>[18:10:00]
 
Jeremy Diamond is in Haifa in Northern Israel for us. Now, to those ceasefire talks, the closer we get, the more pessimistic the outlook seems 
 
 to be for a deal. What more are you learning at this hour?
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT: Well, Paula, the expectations are certainly not very high in terms of what can actually be delivered out 
 
 of these talks tomorrow. But there is certainly still the potential for progress in these negotiations, and with that, the potential for the 
 
 temperature in this region to be lowered.
 
On the other hand, that also means that there's the potential for a lack of progress and for that to then hasten the Iranian retaliation that we have 
 
 been waiting for about two weeks now. What we do know about these talks is that all the key players are going to be at the table with the Mossad 
 
 director, David Barnea, who is leading the Israeli delegation. You'll have The CIA director, Bill Burns, the Qatari prime minister, as well as the 
 
 Egyptian head of intelligence.
 
But in terms of Hamas' attendance at these talks, Hamas is saying that they will not be participating, but that they will be willing to listen to hear 
 
 out the mediators after they engage with the Israelis, if a serious proposal is on the table.
 
And frankly, that is a lot of rhetoric, but it's not all that different from how these talks have been conducted in the past because at key moments 
 
 they've held what are called proximity talks, where the Israeli delegation is in the room with all of those intelligence chiefs working out a deal. 
 
 And then the mediators, the Egyptians and the Qataris, are going back and forth to another room where Hamas officials are usually stationed.
 
But the Hamas position right now is that they want to see a deal based on the framework that was agreed to early last month. They don't want all of 
 
 these additional demands that the Israeli prime minister has made over the course of the last month to be included as a basis for this current round 
 
 of negotiations.
 
Now, we are getting some indication that the Israeli prime minister is giving an expanded mandate to his negotiating team as they head to Doha, 
 
 Qatar tomorrow, but my sources have told me that they are still uncertain about whether or not that will be enough to bridge the gap that currently 
 
 exists with Hamas.
 
No question, though, that if progress can be made here, we could see this region that is very much on edge slightly step back from the brink. That 
 
 was the position expressed earlier today by Amos Hochstein, a U.S. special envoy who is in Beirut today, meeting with Lebanese officials. And what he 
 
 said was that this is such a clear window of opportunity, not only to reach that hostage and ceasefire deal in Gaza, but also that reaching that 
 
 ceasefire deal could provide a window of opportunity for a diplomatic solution to the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah as well. Paula.
 
NEWTON: Yes, no doubt. So, many parties to this conflict. Hoping and waiting to see that comes to fruition. Jeremy Diamond for us, really 
 
 appreciate it.
 
Now, turning to the race for the White House. Republican candidate Donald Trump delivered a speech in the swing state of North Carolina that his 
 
 campaign builds an economic address. Trump vowing to bring down inflation and expand tax cuts. He also reiterated calls to end taxes on tips and on 
 
 Social Security for older Americans.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: To help seniors on fixed incomes who are suffering the ravages of 
 
 inflation, there will be no tax on Social Security. We're going to stop it. It only came into existence in 1984, and at that time, it only affected a 
 
 very small number of recipients. But now, nearly half of all seniors are forced to pay income tax on Social Security, and thanks to inflation under 
 
 Harris, she is horrible, this tax hits more seniors every year.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NEWTON: Now, Trump's Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris, will lay out her economic proposals in a speech in North Carolina on Friday. Today's events 
 
 on the campaign trail come as the latest inflation numbers show U.S. consumer prices easing year over year.
 
Kristen Holmes is in Asheville, North Carolina for us, and you were listening to that entire speech. I am wondering if the aides at the end of 
 
 the speech were happier with that, he did stick to prompter and did articulate again a core promise of, as he just said, cutting taxes on 
 
 Social Security.
 
KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Right. And that's one of their biggest arguments. They believe that's going to really help, 
 
 particularly with senior voters.
 
Now, I talked to aides and allies and I'm still texting them about what they thought of the speech. Most of them are actually feeling like this is 
 
 very positive. And remember, these are the same aides and allies that I've been talking to in recent days who have been concerned about Donald Trump 
 
 being able to stay on message.
 
Now, of course, this was Donald Trump. So, it wasn't fully on message. He made fun of Kamala Harris' laugh. He talked about Joe Biden. He went on a 
 
 few tangents. It was slightly longer than his aides would have liked, but he did talk about the economy. And as you and I have been discussing today 
 
 around this speech, part of the goal here is to bring up the state of the economy now.
 <br>[18:15:00]
 
Yes, it is getting better. That is undeniable. If you look at the data. However, if you talk to voters, they still are feeling pressure 
 
 economically, particularly around inflation, the cost of groceries, the cost of gas and the housing cost. All things that you can feel stress when 
 
 you talk to some of these voters and all things that Donald Trump's team believes if he brings up can help boost him in the polls, help boost him 
 
 with specific voters.
 
Now, that's just one piece of larger messaging. The other part of this is that if you look at the polls of Joe Biden versus Donald Trump, and I am 
 
 saying Joe Biden, because this is before Kamala Harris entered the race, Donald Trump was really pulling ahead of Biden on three main issues, 
 
 immigration, the economy, and crime.
 
That is part of why they want him to focus on those same three issues. The other part of this is they want to link Kamala Harris to Joe Biden. I mean, 
 
 she is, after all, his vice president. Saying that he -- or that she is just as responsible for these policies, for these issues under this 
 
 administration as Joe Biden is, and that's what they believe is a winning ticket, which is why he's out here today.
 
One of the lines that we heard from Donald Trump today, first time we've heard it, and one that does link the two of them, Harris and Biden, was 
 
 essentially saying Kamala Harris says on day one that she's going to lower inflation, but she's been in office for three and a half years. Those are 
 
 the kind of lines that his allies, that his aides have been hoping that he would get at for the last several weeks, not promoting French theories, not 
 
 attacking her ethnicity.
 
Now, whether or not he can continue to do this, and again, he did go slightly off message, but for Donald Trump, it's fairly good and fairly 
 
 solid on the economy, whether or not he can continue to do that remains to be seen. I will note he has a press conference tomorrow in Bedminster, 
 
 another opportunity that not everyone who wants Donald Trump to win in November wants him to actually do because they believe that's where he can 
 
 go off script. That's where he can say things that can later be brought up. And that's where you can say things that can turn off very specific voters.
 
NEWTON: But it does keep him in the media spotlight, which we know is something he also wants. Kristen Holmes for us in Ashville, North Carolina.
 
HOLMES: Very important to him as well.
 
NEWTON: Absolutely it is. Thanks so much, Kristen. Appreciate it. Now, straight ahead for us, a changing of the guard in Japan, Fumio Kishida says 
 
 he's stepping down as prime minister next month in what some are calling a Joe Biden like political move.
 
Plus, give a hand to the handbags. Tourists drawn to Japan by the weekend are doing their part to help boost its economy. We'll have a report from 
 
 Tokyo live, that's next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:20:00]
 
NEWTON: And welcome back. In today's Money Move, an easing in U.S. consumer prices is pleasing U.S. investors. All the major Wall Street averages in 
 
 green, as you can see there, for Wednesday with the S&amp;P 500 up for a fifth straight session. And the gains follow some encouraging news on inflation. 
 
 As we mentioned earlier, the Consumer Price Index easing year over year in July to its lowest levels since 2021.
 
And a tasty M&amp;A deal in the consumer product space to candy maker Mars is buying snack giant Kellanova in a $36 billion deal. Now, Kellanova, which 
 
 was spun off from Kellogg's last year saw its shares rise almost 8 percent on that news.
 
Meantime, Alphabet shares weighing on the NASDAQ Bloomberg news, says the U.S. government is weighing whether to push for the company to be broken up 
 
 after a judge ruled that Google had an illegal monopoly in online search.
 
To Asia now, a lower close for Chinese stocks, but solid gains in Japan and South Korea. Japanese investors can add political uncertainty though now to 
 
 their list of concerns. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announcing Wednesday that He will not seek re-election as the head of his party, a move that 
 
 will pave the way for yet another new Japanese leader.
 
Kishida's future has been the subject of much speculation given his party's political scandals and, of course, the weak state of the Japanese economy. 
 
 Despite plunging approval ratings, he had repeatedly vowed to remain in office until today.
 
Hanako Montgomery joins me now. It was quite a surprise. Public opinion had turned against the PM, but this was still quite a capitulation.
 
HANAKO MONTGOMERY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Paula, you're exactly right. I mean, we knew Kishida was battling very low approval ratings for really the 
 
 past year or so now, and his nearly three-year tenure has been marred by a couple of very significant political scandals and also a lackluster 
 
 economy.
 
Under his tenure, we saw Japan's GDP shrink to the fourth largest in the world, and the yen hit historic lows. Now, that's not great news for people 
 
 within the country, but the weekend has had a surprising and positive effect too. Japan is one of the only bright spots amid a wider global 
 
 luxury slowdown. Take a look at how the week yen has helped good brands and good fashion and good bargains go hand in hand.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MONTGOMERY: With a wad of cash or the swipe of a credit card, tourists from China, the U.S., Thailand, Australia, are buying up Japan's high-end items 
 
 at an unprecedented rate, defying global trends of a luxury slowdown. The reason for this shopping spree? The weak yen.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I had to come and help their economy.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's a reason why we come to Japan for traveling.
 
MONTGOMERY: I see.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's more cheaper than before.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: 100 percent.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It does. It does.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It makes a huge difference.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's one of the main reasons we're here.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I was here a couple of years ago and it was like a completely different experience. The amount of money I'm willing to spend, 
 
 huge difference.
 
MONTGOMERY (voice-over): As the yen hits historic lows this year, foreign tourists are snapping up luxury goods for less than back home, and buying 
 
 tax free doesn't hurt.
 
MONTGOMERY: The luxury market is booming in Japan as it sees record foreign tourist numbers and spending, with estimates surpassing $54 billion U.S. 
 
 this year alone.
 
MONTGOMERY (voice-over): But elsewhere, big brands are feeling the pinch. LVMH, the world's largest luxury group and giant behind Louis Vuitton, saw 
 
 a 14 percent revenue dip in Asia, excluding Japan, during the second quarter of this year compared to 2023. Brands like Ferragamo and Kering 
 
 also took a hard hit. But Japan's bucking the trend, even riding a wave of celebrity driven demand for vintage luxury.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Yes, Japanese vintage is very popular. From a global perspective, Japan excels accurately at praising 
 
 items and distinguishing between authentic and imitation designer pieces.
 
MONTGOMERY (voice-over): Japan's vintage scene, already a top destination for high quality finds, is also getting a boost from the weak yen. Asia's 
 
 second-hand luxury market is set to reach $4.38 billion U.S. this year, 165 percent bigger than the U.S. with Japan leading the way. Though with higher 
 
 Japanese interest rates looming and a fluctuating currency, experts warn this travel trend may not last.
 
NOBUKO KOBAYASHI, ASIA-PACIFIC STRATEGY EXECUTION LEADER, EY: So, the price harmonization across the region will eventually take place. So, far it's 
 
 been so volatile, it's not been caught up, but these two factors will kick in and the arbitrage opportunity will be lessened.
 
MONTGOMERY (voice-over): For now, tourists are cashing in on this luxury paradise while their wallets can hold up demand.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 <br>[18:25:00]
 
MONTGOMERY (on camera): So, Japan's weakened yen, certainly helping the economy and tourists come to the country, Paula.
 
NEWTON: And yet, significant concerns though, for the Japanese economy itself, we are expecting Japanese GDP to be released later on Thursday. 
 
 What are we expecting?
 
MONTGOMERY: Yes, Paula. Economists are telling me that we can expect the GDP to perhaps grow within the second quarter compared to the last quarter. 
 
 And the main reason for that is because private consumption has gone up a little bit.
 
Last quarter, we saw spring negotiations and pay hikes agreed by several very large companies within the country. But those pay hikes didn't really 
 
 kick in until this second quarter, but economists are telling me we're seeing people go out to eat more, travel more. And of course, there's also 
 
 a capital expenditure that's gone up as well.
 
So, all in all, we can expect perhaps slightly more positive data for the second quarter GDP data. But again, Paula, as you mentioned, you know, it's 
 
 not all positive for Japan. The yen at historic lows. We saw the market crash just a few days ago. So, really, again, we'll see in the coming hours 
 
 just how positive this GDP data will look. Paula.
 
NEWTON: Yes, volatile months ahead, and again, adding to that the political uncertainty. Hanako Montgomery for us live from Tokyo, appreciate it.
 
Now, the Asia power shakeup continues. Thailand's prime minister has been removed from office after a court ruled he violated the country's 
 
 constitution. Now, the shock verdict said the prime minister had violated ethics rules by appointing an ex-prisoner to a cabinet post. The prime 
 
 minister says he accepts the ruling. Kristie Lu Stout has more now from Hong Kong.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: A stunning political change, of course, in Thailand. Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin has been removed from 
 
 office after a court ruled that he violated the constitution. And this is the latest court decision that brings even more political turbulence to the 
 
 kingdom.
 
The court says Srettha violated the constitution when he appointed a former lawyer who had served time in prison. The lawyer also once represented the 
 
 powerful Shinawatra family. This is the politically powerful family that founded Srettha's ruling Pheu Thai Party. Now, Srettha denied wrongdoing 
 
 and said that the lawyer who has since resigned was properly vetted.
 
Now, with Srettha now dismissed, the first deputy prime minister will step in as a caretaker prime minister and a new government must now be formed. 
 
 The ruling coalition will nominate a new candidate for prime minister for parliament to vote on.
 
So, now the jostling and the horse trading begins. Now, the candidates include Paetongtarn Shinawatra, a leader of the party and daughter of the 
 
 influential billionaire and former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, as well as a former justice minister, interior minister, energy minister, and 
 
 an influential former army chief who was involved in two coups.
 
The process could take several weeks. The ruling comes just days after the court disbanded Thailand's most popular political party, the progressive 
 
 Move Forward Party. Last year, Move Forward won a landslide victory as it drew huge support from across Thailand, especially among young people. But 
 
 it was blocked from forming a government by lawmakers allied with the military. Its leaders are now banned from politics for 10 years.
 
Both cases are raising concerns about political stability in Thailand. This is Southeast Asia's second biggest economy. And over the past two decades, 
 
 multiple parties have been disbanded and governments overthrown in coups or court rulings, with the judiciary playing a key role in the relentless 
 
 struggle for power in Thailand.

NEWTON: All right. From political turmoil now to turmoil with weather. East Asia is bracing for Typhoon Ampil in the Caribbean. Hurricane Ernesto has 
 
 cut off clean water for thousands of people in Puerto Rico. Chad Myers, as always, there at the weather headquarters for us. Again, watching two very 
 
 significant storms here.
 
CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Yes, and the storm brushed Puerto Rico, and more than half of the island is without power. So, that was some luck there 
 
 that it didn't get the full brunt of the storm. And maybe this time compared to Maria, the lines will be able to go up a little bit faster 
 
 because the power poles didn't come down as well.
 
Here's the window in St. Martin. It was blowing just to the east of Puerto Rico. Look at the winds here. That's one of the islands, like (INAUDIBLE) 
 
 here, just to the east of Puerto Rico. 86 mile per hour gust. Something else that happened was significant rainfall. Somewhere between six and 10 
 
 inches of rain fell in the hills of Puerto Rico and flash flood warnings, flood warnings are still posted here as the water begins to recede in some 
 
 spots but still goes up in others.
 <br>[18:30:00]
 
Where does it go from here? Well, it goes to Bermuda. We've been talking about this now for three days. It 115 miles per hour and about 105 making 
 
 contact there with the Bermuda. The water is very warm. The storm, even right now, looks better on satellite than it's all day long. So, yes, this 
 
 storm could certainly get bigger and is likely to get bigger and make a very close brush with Bermuda.
 
Now, earlier today, the European model even had this thing getting a little bit closer to Atlantic Canada than I would like. But for now, it's backing 
 
 off just a little bit. Something else that's going to hit the U.S. East Coast, 10 to 15 feet. I mean, somewhere in the ballpark of three-to-four-
 
 meter waves possible across the East Coast this week. And, you know, obviously, a holiday weekend in some places, you may want to get out there 
 
 and do something, but be careful of those kiddos in the water, because certainly a lot of wind out there making big waves. And then there you see, 
 
 possibly a little brush with Newfoundland.
 
Now, we turn our attention back toward Japan, because I was just listening to that package about the vintage goods and all those things going over 
 
 there. And the price of the yen and yada, yada, but this is going to go very close to Tokyo as a big typhoon. Somewhere in here 194 kilometers per 
 
 hour.
 
Now, last night, just we were watching this line, the cone, was touching Tokyo. But for now, it's just offshore, you talk one- or two-degree 
 
 difference from where this thing could go, it could be a very significant hit for the East Coast of Japan without a doubt, because this could be a 
 
 pretty significant storm, probably not super typhoon, but when you get something this close to so many people with wind, maybe some waves, rain 
 
 and surge, there could be a significant impact here for the eastern parts of Tokyo and also Northern Japan. Paula.
 
NEWTON: We hear you, Chad, and you're saying take it seriously, even if it is a brush with Tokyo and those population centers. Chad, always good to 
 
 see you. Appreciate it.
 
And we will be right back in a moment with more news.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:35:00]
 
NEWTON: And welcome back to "First Move" with a look at more international headlines this hour. The World Health Organization has declared the mpox 
 
 outbreak in Africa a global health emergency. Mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, is caused by a virus that spreads easily between people and 
 
 animals. Health officials in Africa say 17,000 cases have been reported this year alone. It's killed 500 people in 13 countries.
 
Greek firefighters are working to tame what's left of a deadly wildfire near Athens. Now, conditions have improved. But flare-ups are still a 
 
 threat. And officials are warning residents to stay on guard. Thousands of people have had to evacuate, and at least one person was killed.
 
More now on our top story. Ukraine says its forces are now on the move, seizing even more Russian territory as their surprise incursion enters its 
 
 ninth day. Ukraine's offensive is coming by land and air. A security source says Ukraine used to launch its biggest attack on Russian airfields since 
 
 the war began. This as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says a hundred Russian troops have been captured.
 
We want to bring in CNN Military Analyst Colonel Cedric Leighton. Really good to have you on board as we try and figure out what's gone on here. I 
 
 mean, how do you make sense of what you've seen in the last nine days militarily?
 
COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST AND U.S. AIR FORCE (RET.): Yes, Paula, one of the key things about this is that the Ukrainians are looking 
 
 at achieving some degree of advantage over what had been a very static battle space. And what we're seeing is a move in to capture some territory 
 
 and potentially exchange that territory for territory that the Russians have captured in Ukraine.
 
Now, of course, there's a big disparity between the amount of territory the Russians captured, which is about 18 percent of Ukraine's total landmass 
 
 and the territory that we have here in the Kursk region in Russia. But nonetheless, it is the first time since World War II that a foreign force 
 
 has actually been able to invade and capture territory in Russia itself. So, that's significant.
 
But from another aspect here, which is also on the military side of things, this could very well be the point where the Ukrainians interdict or cut off 
 
 some of the railroad lines that run through this area, you know, which are very important for the Russian war effort. And it's also a place where they 
 
 can start staging into areas that have air bases and also military bases, army bases.
 
So, it has a transportation component to it. It has a military component to it, and it also has an economic component to it, which, of course, feeds 
 
 the war effort. And that economic component is really based on the gas pipeline that goes through that area, where the Ukrainians have actually 
 
 been able to capture one of the metering stations that is really part of the engineering part that goes into pumping the gas into the western and 
 
 eastern Europe. So, that becomes a significant factor as well.
 
NEWTON: Yes, this is more of a rural area, but strategic nonetheless. I want to talk to you about this concept of a buffer zone, right? And does 
 
 that make sense to you in the sense of what Ukraine is saying they're going to do now?
 
LEIGHTON: Yes, it could make sense. There are some artillery pieces, especially, but other weapons that the Russians use that have a certain 
 
 range. And if you move the Russians back, they're less likely to hit some of the major cities in Ukraine, such as Kyiv, such as Kharkiv, those areas.
 
Now, the particular area where they're in right now, is opposite some other rural areas in the Sumy region of Ukraine, but it does have some 
 
 significant agricultural use for the Ukrainians and some industrial use as well. So, to protect that area is very important for the Ukrainians because 
 
 it also serves as a gateway to other places, including to Kyiv.
 
NEWTON: And then, we get to what Russia might be preparing for. We have had these images of these trenches that have already been dug up. And plus, we 
 
 also have apparently people -- Russian authorities looking for people willing to help them dig these trenches. They have the equipment, but 
 
 apparently not the manpower. What is that all about?
 
LEIGHTON: So, the Ukrainians are digging some trenches to stay longer. And what they're looking at is potentially keep that territory on their side 
 
 and use that as a bargaining chip for possible territorial exchange and things like that.
 
On the Russian side, they have to bring in a lot of reinforcements in order to move the Ukrainians out of the territory that they've already occupied. 
 
 So, there are going to be some significant issues really on both sides logistically in terms of being able to keep these areas.
 <br>[18:40:00]
 
But the Russians have done a lot with trench warfare and with basically blocking off Ukrainian lines of advance in the south and in the east, and 
 
 the Ukrainians are kind of doing the same thing using a bit of their own medicine in essence against the Russians in this part of the north, and 
 
 that could have a significant impact on the ability of Russia to actually take or retake territory in this case.
 
NEWTON: And significantly, as we look at these images, there is no doubt now that this has opened up another front. And to that end, I want to get 
 
 to the strategy part of this, right? Some people are suggesting that now is the time for western allies to get the military aid, more of it, more 
 
 quickly to Volodymyr Zelenskyy. It's what he's been asking for. Because they believe that at this point now that this is a turning point and that 
 
 it will lead more quickly to an eventual peace. What do you think?
 
LEIGHTON: Well, it's certainly a possible scenario, Paula. What could happen is that if they use this as an opportunity and Russian aid during 
 
 this time, then it could potentially help the Ukrainian forces at the very least maintain what they've got. Russia has a lot of different resources 
 
 that it can still call upon, even though they seem to have a really tough time getting those resources to the front in question.
 
The other thing that has happened, of course, you know, more on the military strategy side is the Ukrainians are forcing the Russians to move 
 
 their troops and we're seeing them move troops from areas in occupied Ukraine to Kursk area and other areas that they think they need to defend.
 
So, when it comes to this particular moment in time, it couldn't very well be a pivotal moment. I think it's premature to say it's the turning point, 
 
 but it is a pivotal moment in this particular war. And that, I think, is a significant thing that could benefit very much from additional aid and 
 
 additional firepower.
 
NEWTON: Yes, all of that as we wait for the Kremlin and Putin to make their next move, and we all know there will be one. Colonel Cedric Leighton for 
 
 us in Washington, thanks so much, really appreciate it.
 
LEIGHTON: You bet, Paula.
 
NEWTON: Now, what was supposed to be a week, yes, just a week in space, could turn into months. The latest on what NASA says about a timetable to 
 
 bring the Starliner astronauts home, finally.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
NEWTON: And welcome back to "First Move." Now, since June, two U.S. astronauts have been stuck on the International Space Station, NASA 
 
 announcing Wednesday. It's still more than a week away from a decision on how to bring them home.
 <br>[18:45:00]
 
Now, Butch Willmore and Suni Williams were supposed to spend eight days in orbit. Instead, it's been 70 and counting. With NASA warning, it's possible 
 
 the two could be stuck on the station until next year.
 
Now, they were the first astronauts to fly aboard the Boeing Starliner spacecraft. Problems with the Starliner have pushed back a return flight. 
 
 Now, NASA has taken into account a limited food supply, if you can believe it, and whether the craft will be able to safely fly back to Earth.
 
I'm joined now by Tariq Malik. He is an editor at -- chief -- editor-in- chief of Space.com. And I want to thank you for joining us. I mean, what did you make of the update today? And do you think it makes it more likely 
 
 now that look, Boeing is out, these astronauts will go home with SpaceX.
 
TARIQ MALIK, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, SPACE.COM: You know, I think that it is a little disappointing to have to wait yet another week after weeks upon 
 
 weeks of trying to find out what, you know, NASA and its partner, Boeing, want to do with this spacecraft. However, what we heard today from NASA is 
 
 that they really want to basically cross all their T's and dot all their I's to understand the issues at play before they really commit, one way or 
 
 another, to bring the astronauts home, either on the Starliner spacecraft or take the -- maybe the safe but really kind of unprecedented route of 
 
 bringing them back on a different spacecraft.
 
Now, for the astronauts themselves, they've got a long mission that just keeps getting longer for them, and they actually left their luggage on 
 
 Earth too. So, that could be an issue going forward to get them more supplies in the weeks to come regardless of what happens.
 
NEWTON: Yes, eight days to eight months. I mean, who could believe this? I want to ask you, though, does it matter now what Boeing is advising? 
 
 Because this decision rests with NASA and if they as an organization have any doubt at all, they're going to scrub it, right? That would be common 
 
 sense. Why take the risk?
 
MALIK: Yes, I think that if NASA has any doubts, they will definitely defer towards whatever the safest option would be. Now, they have said that 
 
 they've been confident in the spacecraft that if there's an emergency right now on the International Space Station, they don't have an issue with Butch 
 
 Wilmore, Suni Williams taking the spacecraft back to Earth. But if -- you know, if it's just a regular day, they want to make sure that they 
 
 understand the issues at play.
 
The key issue is a set of thrusters that aren't really working as well as NASA and Boeing had hoped. They've been testing the systems on the Earth, 
 
 over the last like two months to try to get to the root issue. They think they understand an overheating issue that is causing it but they want to 
 
 make sure that once these astronauts undock from the space station, that there won't be any issues in that crucial period to get them out of space 
 
 and on Earth safely.
 
Now, that is a really big and important step. And as you said, Paula, if they have any doubts, they've got another spacecraft, by SpaceX, launching 
 
 in late September. They could launch that half full with just two astronauts instead of four and have some seats for these this crew to come 
 
 back probably in February, though, that's a very long time to have your mission extended.
 
NEWTON: And why does it extend that far? I think so many people are looking at the timeline of this thinking, why -- what's taking so long? I mean, how 
 
 is this affecting the overall space program?
 
MALIK: You would think that with two different suppliers, Boeing and SpaceX, NASA would have some flexibility in when they could get their 
 
 astronauts to and from the station. But there is a bit of a traffic jam that is in play right now at the space station.
 
In order to launch the next crewed mission on Dragon, which is called Crew 9, in late September, they have to bring the Starliner spacecraft back to 
 
 Earth because they need the docking port and other supplies to support that. But they can't do any of that until another crew launches on a 
 
 Russian spacecraft. That's also supposed to happen in September. They're waiting on that.
 
And at the same time, there's some cargo missions. SpaceX has already delayed an uncrewed cargo mission of its own. There's a Russian cargo 
 
 mission launching tonight, actually that's going to the space center. It arrives on Saturday. And so, you have all these different visiting vehicles 
 
 coming and going that need to be kind of accounted for to find the safe window.
 
NEWTON: You know, you reminded us of so much there, right? These two astronauts are being such good sports. They are bumper to bumper now, as 
 
 you said, in the traffic jam in space. And again, that, yes, the Russian space program is also still involved in all this and could be part of the 
 
 solution. Tariq Malik for us, editor-in-chief of Space.com. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.
 
Now, next, a thrilling new chapter Kylian Mbappe makes his debut for Real Madrid.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:50:00]
 
NEWTON: In our sports move, the man of the moment, Mbappe, a huge win for Kylian Mbappe as he made his debut for Real Madrid in the UEFA Super Cup. 
 
 He scored the second goal for Los Blancos as they beat Atalanta, 2-nil. It's a record sixth win for Madrid in the Super Cup, which is played 
 
 between the winners of the Champions League, remember, and the Europa League.
 
Don Riddell joins us now from CNN World Sport, and I'm taking this lightly by saying, it's a big deal.
 
DON RIDDELL, CNN WORLD SPORT: Yes, well, it is and it isn't. Paula, the Super Cup is kind of the curtain raiser to the European season, which is 
 
 all going to kick off in a lot of the top leagues domestically at the weekend. But some people would say it's really kind of more of a friendly 
 
 game and it's a nice way to break your way into the season.
 
But don't tell that to Real Madrid. As you say, they've won this thing six times now. That is a record. That is one more than Barcelona and AC Milan. 
 
 And this was a really interesting game because Atalanta kept Madrid quiet for the first half. They didn't have a single shot on target, but after the 
 
 break, it was a different story. They could have scored, you know, half a dozen goals. That's Mbappe getting the second one.
 
And again, what was interesting about this game was that this team is just a galaxy of stars. I mean, arguably they've got. Three of the best players 
 
 in the world right now in their squad, but they really struggled to kind of see the ball make space gel. In the second half it came together. And I 
 
 think when you hear what the players are saying about it, they could achieve an awful lot again this season.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JUDE BELLINGHAM, READ MADRID MIDFIELDER: Really fun. You know, we have a new -- kind of new look team. And it seemed to just click tonight. You 
 
 know, sometimes it takes a bit of time. And the first half, I think we're still adjusting and then, second half just all came together and we were 
 
 brilliant. So, yes, really nice. You know, it's going to be a long year for us if we do well in everything, which is what we want to do. So, got to 
 
 enjoy nights like tonight. But yes, come Sunday, straight back to work.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
RIDDELL: So, yes, an amazing debut for Kylian Mbappe. His first game, he's already got his hands on a trophy. And remember, this team has only really 
 
 trained together five or six times. Here they are, already got a trophy in hand. They've won two of the last three Champions League titles. They're 
 
 the defending La Liga titles. I think there are very, very high expectations that this team is going to go on and win a lot more silverware 
 
 again this season.
 
NEWTON: I'm sure. Just whet the appetite of fans right there. Don Riddell for us, thanks so much, appreciate it.
 
And finally, on "First Move," uncovering the mysteries of one of the world's oldest monuments. Researchers say the stone placed at the heart of 
 
 Britain's Stonehenge was not brought there from Wales, as originally thought. Instead, it was likely to have been transported all the way from 
 
 Scotland. The Altar Stone weighs more than 13,000 pounds, or around six metric tons. So, you can imagine it was no mean feat to bring it all the 
 
 way down to the south of England, 5,000 years ago.
 <br>[18:55:00]
 
Now, the discovery suggests Ancient Britain may have been more advanced than first thought with experts saying it's possible the stone was moved by 
 
 sea. Intriguing.
 
That does it for this show. I'm Paula Newton. I want to thank you for joining us. CNN continues now.
