RICHARD QUEST, CNN ANCHOR:  Hello and a very warm welcome if you're joining me in the United States or indeed from anywhere around the world. I'm Richard Quest. I'm live in London. And we have for you in the "CNN Newsroom," a sigh of relief as warmer temperatures are moving east, but the extreme winter weather threat is not yet over for millions of Americans.
 
I'll tell you about Vladimir Putin saying he's ready to negotiate over Ukraine only if Russia gets what it wants. The Ukrainian's response to that ultimatum. And China once again down-playing its rapidly spreading COVID-19 outbreak. The country is overwhelmed health care system tells a different story to that of the official ones.
 
The end of brutal freezing temperatures might be in sight. Relief possibly on the way for millions of Americans after the historic winter storm left at least 37 people dead. Conditions are beginning to improve. We saw that on Sunday where emergency workers were able to get out to survey the extent of the damage. 
 
The governor of New York is requesting an emergency disaster declaration from the U.S. federal government to help the state cover the costs of the storm. At least 17 deaths have been reported in New York where officials say many of those who died were either homeless or stranded in their cars in the below freezing temperatures. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KATHY HOCHUL, GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK:  It is devastating. It is going to a war zone and the vehicles along the sides of the roads are shocking. It's not just small vehicles. It is literally snowplows. It is major sized recovery vehicles and utility vehicles and tow trucks. So, we have a real challenge right now where we have roads blocked. Roads are literally blocked by emergency vehicles so that has made it extremely challenging for us. (END VIDEO CLIP)
 
QUEST:  These are the scenes that the governor is talking about -- streets blocked with emergency and snow clearing vehicles. And look at this picture from near Hamburg in New York. It gives you an idea of how cold it is there across much of the north eastern United States. Here's the New York governor again.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
HOCHUL:  You need to stay off the roads. We've been begging, we've been asking the vast majority of you have, and I'm so grateful for that. But those of you who violate the driving bans, you may think you can go to the store for that six pack, but you are endangering other people. And it's frustrating because our state and county plows have been out there nonstop, giving up time and putting themselves in danger driving through blinding snowstorms to clear the roads. 
 
They clear them, and now all of a sudden because someone wanted to go out to the store or just run and visit a friend or take pictures of the snow, they are now stranded and we have to expand our emergency operations, our rescue to them as well. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
QUEST:  CNN's Polo Sandoval is in Buffalo, one of the worst affected places. Here the roads are completely blocked over the weekend and only now finally starting to be cleared. 
 
POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  It has been a wicked winter weekend for so many people here in the city of Buffalo as folks are in the process of basically digging themselves out. I want to give you an idea what the situation looks like here in the heart of the city of Buffalo. Many of the streets look kind of like this. 
 
Finally on Sunday when the situation improved, when conditions improved and visibility was restored, we saw these plow trucks that have been out in full force making sure that these streets are drivable. All weekend long there's been restrictions in place including a travel and a driving ban basically encouraging people to spend Christmas Eve and Christmas Day at home, and it's really out of safety. 
 
Over the weekend, they confirmed -- authorities here in Erie County confirmed at least seven weather related deaths, just four alone that were confirmed on Sunday morning. Some of them were homeless individuals and the most vulnerable, while others according to New York Governor Kathy Hochul, the individuals that were found dead in their vehicles, stranded on roads and highways. 
 
So that is why all weekend long crews have been out in full force in large high-profile vehicles.
 <br>[03:05:00]
 
Even on snowmobiles trying to get to individuals who've spent all of Christmas weekend stranded on the side of the road. They certainly hope that that number of people who have lost their lives as a result of this massive storm does not go up anymore. Polo Sandoval, CNN, Buffalo, New York. 
 
QUEST:  Already on Monday, more than 1,100 flights were canceled both within into (inaudible) United States according to elite tracking website FlightAware. The storm's impact on infrastructure has been dramatic. Buffalo where Polo was just a second ago, now there, they've recorded over 43 inches of snow over the weekend, so the airport will remain closed until at least Tuesday morning. 
 
There were major disruptions, 3,100 flights canceled across the U.S. and almost 7,000 delays. With so many airports impacted, Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson is seeing the worst of it as travelers are prepared to hunker down in the city. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNKNOWN:  We were supposed to fly to Denver this morning on Frontier. The flight was canceled. Now we're trying to go to every airline counter possible to see if we can get out. Today's supposed to be an easy travel day. Turned out not to be so. 
 
UNKNOWN:  What's your backup plan?
 
UNKNOWN:  Stay in Atlanta, unfortunately. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
QUEST:  So, this is what we've got to look forward to as relief moves in. Temperatures are going to warm up just a smidgen in the central U.S. and to the east by the end of the week. 
 
This arctic weather has made things even more dangerous for migrants who are entering the U.S. from the southern border. So many of them are now sleeping on the streets in El Paso in Texas where freezing temperatures have made life just about impossible. But communities and local residents are coming to rescue in aid making the border town a sanctuary during the holidays. Camila Bernal is in El Paso, Texas. 
 
CAMILA BERNAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Despite very difficult circumstances, a lot of happy children thanks to the generosity of the people of El Paso. Santa Claus came to this shelter where the migrants are sleeping and spending the night, and many other locals bringing toys, bringing gifts for so many of the children that are here with their parents. 
 
I spoke to one mother who told me this present would have been completely impossible in my native Venezuela, and this is inexpensive gifts that are making these children and these families really grateful on Christmas Day. Look, a lot of the people here cannot go to the city-run shelters. The city of El Paso has opened a convention center, but only about 300 people are sleeping there because in order to go to that location you need to have the proper documentation. 
 
So, the only option they have is a non-profit shelter like this one run by Sacred Heart Church in El Paso, but they are completely at capacity. Their capacity is for about 130 people. They're sleeping about 200 of them every day when the temperature is about 20 degrees. But the problem is because they don't fit, a lot of these migrants have to sleep outside. That's why you're seeing so many blankets. That's why you're seeing them one next to the other because they're always trying to keep warm. 
 
So many of them telling me I don't necessarily want to be here, but it is the necessity from our countries that have forced us to come here. I talked to one father who told me that he saw Santa Claus here and he took a picture with him, sent it to his 7-year-old son in Venezuela and told him, look, Santa is in the U.S. So, the bike that you so desperately want is going to be delayed because Santa is still here in the U.S. He says that when he finds a job here in the U.S., he will be able to send his son that bike. Camila Bernal, CNN, El Paso, Texas. 
 
QUEST:  In Ukraine, a military spokesperson is warning of a possible missile strike over the death of three Russian servicemen inside Russia. According to state media quoting the Russian defense ministry, they were killed after a Ukrainian drone was shot down as it approached a military airfield in western Russia. 
 
President Vladimir Putin does say he's ready to negotiate over the war according to an interview with state T.V. He says he's ready to talk about acceptable solutions but claims Ukraine is refusing to negotiate. On the other side, Ukraine says it's actually Russia who doesn't want to negotiations. In a tweet, Ukrainian president adviser says Vladimir Putin needs to come back to reality.
 
This is all happening -- excuse me -- as Russia's deputy prime minister is suggesting his country is prepared to resume gas supplies to Europe via the Yamal-Europe pipeline. 
 <br>[03:09:56]
 
Now, state media is reporting Alexander Novak says the European market remains relevant with gas shortages and the pipeline had been stopped on political reasons and remains unused. CNN's Nada Bashir is following developments and joins me. Let's take this point by point if we may. Start with this idea of who's going to negotiate. It's not new that Putin has said he wants to negotiate, but who's really -- if you have to put it bluntly -- telling the truth here? 
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER:  Well, look, we heard from President Putin just last week saying that he was open to negotiations with Ukraine. This is something that Kremlin and President Putin have maintained for months now. That they are willing to come to the negotiating table, but rather that it is Ukraine which refusing to come to the negotiating table. 
 
We've seen international efforts in the past to bring the two parties together in particular Turkey and the United Nations playing a key role in attempting to bring about some sort of resolution through dialogue, but that hasn't been the case. And what Ukraine has said in response to this, is a clear message to President Putin that come back to reality. That was the message from one of President Zelenskyy's top advisers.
 
 They, of course, focusing on the continued bombardment that we are seeing in Ukraine by the Kremlin, by the Russian armed forces. They are saying that clearly this is not a sign of the Kremlin being willing to come to the negotiating table. And they say they are not willing to negotiate with terrorists. They have claimed, of course, that Russia is a terrorist state. 
 
QUEST:  Except Putin has said in his speech a couple of days ago -- that, of the one where he misspoke and used the word wars -- wars are settled by negotiation --
 
BASHIR:  Exactly.
 
QUEST:  -- and both parties have to come to the table. 
 
BASHIR:  That was the message from President Putin. It was interesting that he chose to use the word war. Was it a slip of the tongue? Was it perhaps intentional, but also focused very much on the fact that at the end of the day, in his words, all wars, all conflict are somehow brought to a resolution through dialogue, through talks. So that is key. Whether or not, that is what translates to the reality on the ground is the other question because of course, we are still seeing that heavy bombardment of Ukraine by the Russian armed forces. 
 
QUEST:  Thank you. Talk to you on the next hour. Thank you. In a moment, why a high-ranking House Democrat is calling for big changes the way Americans choose their president. 
 
And China announces changes in the way it reports new COVID cases. It's an intent say some to conceal the true impact of the virus. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[03:15:00]
 
QUEST:  With Christmas just about in the rearview mirror, eyes are now on the New Year and the new Republican controlled House of Representatives in Washington. Divided government, it's obviously meaning Democrats will find it harder to pass legislation. That's not a forecast. That's actually a prognosis. 
 
We're waiting it see what will happen. For instance, the House Democrat Jamie Raskin speaking up now saying the next step is to save our democracy by reforming the Electoral College. Now, for those who aren't too familiar with this wonderful bit of American electoral arcanery, Americans don't directly elect the U.S. president even though they put that name on a piece of paper. 
 
Instead, it's a slate of voters who are then expected to carry out the will of the voters when they vote. The Electoral College as long as I can remember it has been up for reform. The problem is how do you reform something that everybody wants to reform but nobody can agree on the way forward? Well, Raskin says it's now time to actually deal with it.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD):  The Electoral College now, which has given us five popular vote losers as president in our history twice in this century alone has become a danger not just to democracy but to the American people. It was a danger on January 6th. There's so many curving byways and nooks and crannies in the Electoral College that there are opportunities for a lot of strategic mischief. We should elect the president the way we elect governors, senators, mayors, representatives, everybody else, whoever gets the most votes wins. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
QUEST:  Raskin's remarks followed days after the House Committee investigating the capitol riots and President Trump's efforts is now about to be wrapped up. In a symbolic move, the committee of course, referred President Trump to the Justice Department on four criminal charges. Richard Johnson joins me now, lecturer in U.S. politics at Queen Mary University in London. He joins me in London. 
 
Now, this is really straightforward, isn't it? Let's deal with this call for the Electoral College. I'm sure as long as you can remember, people have been saying, well, popular vote versus electoral vote it doesn't really work, but nobody can find a way to change it. 
 
RICHARD JOHNSON, LECTURER IN U.S. POLITICS, QUEEN MARY UNIVERSITY OF LONDON:  That's right. The last time that the constitution was amended to try and fix some elements of the Electoral College was in the early 19th century with the 12th amendment. We've heard, you know, talk about amending the Constitution, which is what you would need to do to change Electoral College after the 2000 election, after 2016 and nothing came of it. 
 
There is one way around it, though, which is that the state legislatures could actually pass legislation that says that they will cast their Electoral College votes to the popular vote winner. And if you can get states to add up to 270 electoral votes which is the majority, you could actually kind of bypass the Electoral College. 
 
And there is some effort to do that in the states. We're not at 270 yet, but that probably is the most likely way you could get around the electoral college. 
 
QUEST:  The January 6th, there's two aspects to this, again. Firstly, it's going to be disbanded by the new Republican-controlled House. And I guess, you know, what's left for it to do on that. And then you've got a whole slew of new inquiries and investigations, investigations galore. How brutal is it going to get? 
 <br>[03:19:56]
 
JOHNSON:  Well, there's going to be a big change now with the House going over to Republicans. And, you know, I think we should brace ourselves and expect a series of investigations now into the Biden presidency. And I think this is going to be a big challenge for President Biden as to how to navigate those, you know. This, you know, quite rightly there was a lot of criticism against
 
 Donald Trump for not really engaging with the January 6th committee. You know, Biden now is going to have to navigate how he deals with what he may view as very spurious investigations into his own presidency in the months to come. 
 
QUEST:  If the new emboldened Republicans in the House decide to press forward with impeachment proceedings against even just a tit for tat basis, they'll go nowhere, of course, because the Senate has now been held by -- the Senate is the court of hearing -- has now been held by the Democrats. So, an enormous amount of what we're going to hear is literally bluster. 
 
JOHNSON:  I think that's right. And I think that we have to now -- you know, this is a process that's been happening, you know, when this has been a divided government for a number of decades now. We saw it during the Bill Clinton presidency. We saw a little bit in the tail end of the George W. Bush presidency. We saw it through most of Obama's presidency.
 
But it's become much more intense now, which is that parties -- when the opposition party is in control of one of the chambers in Congress, they use that position to undermine the presidential administration of the day. And that seems to be much more focused than trying to build some kind of bipartisan legislative coalition. 
 
QUEST:  So, as we look forward, does -- has the 2024 -- I get my dates right -- has the 2024 presidential election day factor begun? 
 
JOHNSON:  Yes, I think it has. I often say after the midterm elections we're already in presidential campaign mode. And I think you can already see that obviously with Donald Trump declaring his presidency, but also from significant Republican governors like Ron DeSantis or Greg Abbott who are now engaging in kind of these high-profile stunts to raise their national profile and their profile within the Republican Party. 
 
I will say, I think Joe Biden is in a fairly strong position in the sense of his ability to hold onto the Democratic nomination. I think earlier in his presidency there was some doubt whether he faced a significant challenge in a Democratic primary. I think that's less likely now. I think he's had a good year. He's had a legislatively productive year and I think that he's probably put off some of the naysayers (inaudible). 
 
QUEST:  So, this is always a tricky one. How does he get over the fact he looks old? And I -- I sort of was watching him, the president, I mean, you know, regardless of his mental acuity, I was watching him with President Zelenskyy and, you know, the words that keep just coming back to me are Kennedy's (ph), the torch is being passed to a new generation born in this century tempered by war. And you know, but then you see President Biden who you almost want to offer a chair to. 
 
JOHNSON:  Yeh. You know, it's something he can't escape. He's, you know, Joe Biden was born before Donald Trump, Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton. He's older than all of his four predecessors. You know, he first entered national politics when Richard Nixon was president. I would say that, you know, that's going to be something that will be a challenge against him. 
 
I think that he's more demonstrated any particular incident where he's been unable to fulfill the duties of the presidency because of his age not at least not in any way that we've seen. But, yes, he does look old and he is old and, you know, I think that's going to be something that he'll probably have to carefully manage. He probably won't be campaigning quite in the same vigorous fashion as a younger candidate, and that could be to his detriment in a general election against perhaps a younger Republican nominee.
 
QUEST:  Good to see you, sir. I'm grateful. Thank you.  
 
JOHNSON:  Thank you.
 
QUEST:  The newsroom has much more for you. Russia's military has been expanding their presence in the arctic circle, an area vital importance to Russia's defense strategy. We'll show you why. 
 
And an uncontrollable COVID outbreak in China. How the country is faring after stripping back its zero COVID policies. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[03:25:00]
 
QUEST:  This is CNN. A good day to you. China is changing the way it reports new COVID infections. Its national health commissioner has announced it would stop publishing a daily case count. Now, the responsibility falls to China's center for disease control and prevention. However, it's unclear how often they will publish new numbers. 
 
It follows a surge in the country of new infections after the dramatic reversal of its strict COVID -- zero COVID policy. Officials in an eastern province near Shanghai now reporting more than a million new cases a day and they expect that number to double in the coming days. Kristie Lu Stout is with me form Hongkong. Let's be blunt here. Is the decision to make this change in reporting simply to avoid having to show large numbers? 
 
KRISTIE LU STOUT, CN CORRESPONDENT:  You know, that's what it feels like because look at the timing right now as China is dealing with a surge in cases. Why make this change? On the face of it, it appears that China wants to conceal and part any negative information out there about its COVID-19 outbreak that is happening right now. 
 
But what we've learned is that China's top health body, the National Health Commission, is no longer reporting daily COVID numbers. Instead, over the weekend, it announced that relevant outbreak information would be posted by a department that it manages, China's CDC. The CDC has been posting daily numbers so far on Sunday or Monday, but whether that trend will continue that remains to be seen. 
 
But concern is rising about what really is the actual and true scope and scale of the COVID outbreak under way right now in China. Some data has been coming in from various cities and provinces. Like Zhejiang province, that's located just out of shanghai. It's home to 64 million people, is been reporting 1 million new COVID cases a day. 
 <br>[03:29:59]
 
And just quickly to contextualize that number, that -- this is our CNN's calculation of that. That equates to 1,583 new daily infections per 100,000 people, but officials there say that that number could peak to 2 million new COVID infections by this weekend. Back to you, Richard. 
 
RICHARD QUEST, CNN ANCHOR:  So, we've got this -- a situation where they have said that the numbers -- that the reported numbers and discrepancy to the reality. And we also got a population that really has got a head spinning round. We've been told this is the worst thing ever. And now are being told, oh, just get on with it and don't worry about it, whilst the number of dead will rise as well. 
 
LU STOUT:  Yeah. And that's the thing. The number of dead will rise in the next few weeks, is been described to be a very, very dangerous few weeks ahead in China because of the sudden U-turn, the sudden end of the zero COVID strategy and this policy in China. And also, the fact that China is not ready for it. 
 
The medical health infrastructure, the capacity wasn't there. As we've been reporting here in CNN, medical facilities and hospitals are absolutely overwhelmed and overstretched. 
 
QUEST:  Right.
 
LU STOUT:  We have huge portions of the population that are under vaccinated, that haven't received their vaccination shots. And Richard, you know, the next few weeks are going to be critical because it's not just wintertime, the end of the year. We're also heading into the Lunar New Year, travel period, which as you know, peak travel season. This is the world's biggest annual human migration. That's going to supercharge the spread of the virus, Richard. 
 
QUEST:  So, I remember what Xi in a speech earlier in the -- talking about how they would never let a million -- he didn't -- he excoriated the U.S. for having over a million dead. How is he going to -- if he does, when the Chinese numbers, if they do get a million? 
 
LU STOUT:  You now, this has been, you know, the third challenge for China in dealing with the end of zero COVID. The first challenge trying to boost vaccinations. The second challenge, boosting medical capacity. Third, the messaging. How does China change the messaging after so many years criticizing the west for its lackadaisical approach to pandemic policy. 
 
And now what we're having is this very confusing messaging going forward. When you monitor social media or state-run media, you see the amplification or highlighting stories of heroes, of good Samaritans who are donating medical supplies. A positive story came out today of Paxlovid being available for residents in Beijing. But according to our own Selina Wang in Beijing, good luck getting it. It may be available, it's hard to secure. Richard? 
 
QUEST:  Kristie Lu Stout in Hong Kong. Thank you. 
 
LY STOUT:  Thank you. 
 
QUEST:  Taiwanese officials say nearly a fifth Chinese aircraft have crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait as the former border between China and the self-governed islands. These incursions took place on Sunday. 
 
Now, Beijing's largest show of force against (ph) upon recent months. It's part of a so-called strike deal that China conducted in response to what it calls provocations from Taiwan and the U.S. It follows President Biden signing a new law to modernize defense systems of Taiwan to deter Chinese aggression. 
 
While much of Russia's resources are firmly focused on the war in Ukraine, there is still evidence they're expanding their military force into arctic. Satellite pictures obtained by CNN shows a series of Russian radar bases and runways undergoing improvements over the last year. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh with this report. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NICK PATON WALSH, CNN INTERNATIONAL SECURITY EDITOR (voice-over):  Up here in the arctic, you wouldn't get the feeling Russia's military who is crippled by its catastrophic invasion of Ukraine. To Moscow, this ice quickly receding with climate change is vital to its defense and future. 
 
These new satellite images obtained by CNN reveal the changes of key military installations over just the past year and show that despite the damage done to Russia's military from their invasion of Ukraine, they're still expanding up near the Arctic Circle fast. 
 
Towards the east, three radomes have been buildup here at Tiksi between this October and last. Work here too over the last year from the runway in Nagurskoye Airfield fire up near the Arctic Circle. And one of five new Rezonans-N radars, which they claim can fight stealth jets emerging out of nowhere here. 
 
And this new building had one radar station near Norway emerging since June last year. In an exclusive interview, NATO's chief is aware of the growing threat. 
 <br>[03:34:54]
 
JENS STOLTENBERG, SECRETARY GERNERAL, NATO:  What we see now is a significant Russian military buildup in the high north. And as we see, Russia reopening old soviet bases, military sites for those testing novel weapons in the arctic and the high north. 
 
WALSH (voice-over):  The arctic is vital to Russia, not only for oil and gas, but also as part of its nuclear defense. The Kremlin is also urgently launching new atomic icebreakers to ensure it retains influence over a shorter trade route from the Pacific to Europe opened up by climate change, reducing the arctic ice cover. 
 
(On camera):  But the war in Ukraine has led to major changes on both sides. Russia sent 75 percent of its arctic land forces to Ukraine, a senior western intelligence official has told me. But its navy is almost untouched, semidetached from the war, they added. Also, after strikes on air fields deep inside Russia, jets have been dispersed around its territory, some to the north, boosting effectively that presence in the arctic. NATO is also sending its messages. 
 
(Voice-over):  What you're seeing here looks like normal air job of a supply palette, but it is an unprecedented exercise over Norway by U.S. Special Forces this year, dropping off a cruise missile on a parachute. Here, it ignites. The U.S. military keen to show it can fire such arms from a cargo plane, greatly increasing its range near Russia. 
 
Shaken by recent sabotage of Baltic Sea pipelines, NATO is now focused on protecting Norway's energy infrastructure. Now Norway, not Russia, supplies about 30 percent of the gas exports to Europe. 
 
STOLTENBERG:   Since the sabotage on the Baltic Sea, we have doubled our presence with ships, with submarines, with maritime patrol aircrafts in the Baltic and north seas. 
 
WALSH (voice-over):  A change unlikely to come Moscow or reduce its footprint. Some were so close to home. Nick Paton Walsh, CNN, London.

KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  These tests are dangerous and we will not conduct them. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) FISHER:  The U.S., China, Russia, and India have all carried out these types of tests in the past which involves firing a missile from earth and striking a satellite in space creating massive debris fields. This year, astronauts aboard the International Space Station repeatedly dodged debris from Russia's most recent test of this type of weapon. 
 
The truth is out there for our seventh space story of the year. And in 2022, Congress pushed for answers. For the first time in more than 50 years, a public hearing on Capitol Hill about UFOs or UAPs.

FISHER:  At number 6, Moscow threatening to pull out of the International Space Station after the U.S. sanctioned Russia for invading Ukraine. Dmitry Rogozin, the now former head of Russia's space agency, Roscosmos, threatening to end its nearly three decades long partnership with NASA, even going so far as to release a video implying that Moscow might abandon a Nasa astronaut that Russia was responsible for bringing back to Earth. 
 
The bluster prompted a bitter twitter war between Rogozin and one of NASA's most famous former astronauts, Scott Kelly, who later this year celebrated Rogozin's ouster and the space station's ability to survive despite the conflict roughly 250 miles below.

SCOTT KELLY, RETIRED NASA ASTRONAUT:  And when you have a guy like him that, you know, behaves like a child on Twitter and threatens nuclear war, I was really, really happy to see him go.

FISHER:  When Russia knocked out cellphone and internet service to much of the country, a Ukrainian government official begged SpaceX's Elon Musk for help.
 <br>[03:45:01]
 
Musk responded with a tweet that would forever change the battlefield. "Starlink service is now active in Ukraine. More terminals en route." Well, since then, Starlink has become an indispensable tool for both Ukrainian civilians and the Ukrainian military. But after months of providing the lifesaving internet service for free, documents obtained by CNN showed that SpaceX told the Pentagon that it can no longer continue to fund Starlink terminals in Ukraine indefinitely. 
 
And Musk later backtracked saying that his company will continue to fund Starlink service in Ukraine, but the debate laid bare the dangers of an entire country being too dependent on one billionaire.

FISHER:  Hear that? That is what the black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy sounds like. And in 2022, scientists were able to capture an image of it for the very first time. The image which was captured by the Event Horizon Telescope, which is a global network of synchronized radio observatories confirmed the presence of a super massive black hole known as Sagittarius A, some 27,000 light years away from Earth. 
 
Number three is the world's first planetary defense mission. After billions of years of being at the mercy of killer asteroids and comets in 2022, earthlings struck back.

UKNOWN:  And for the first time, our technology allows us to actually do something about it.

FISHER:  NASA's plan was to try to ram a refrigerator sized spacecraft called DART, into an asteroid named Dimorphos, to see if the impact would push the asteroid slightly off course. Now, Dimorphos posed no threat to planet Earth, but if the test worked, it would mean this type of technique could maybe be used to deflect a future killer asteroid that is headed for Earth.

UNKNOWN:  And we have impact.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FISHER:  -- the bulls eye hit was captured by telescopes all over the world, which later confirmed that the tiny DART spacecraft was successful in bumping that asteroid off course.

UNKNOWN:  Yeah, I think DART we can shoots better and definitely I will.

FISHER:  Coming in at number two, the James Webb Space Telescope finally delivering on its decades long promise by beaming back its first images to Earth. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  Tomorrow when this image is shared with the world, it'll be a historic moment for science and technology, for astronomy and space exploration, for America and all of humanity. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FISHER:  It's the culmination of more than 30 years' worth of work, carrying the hopes and dreams of astronomers all over the world seeking answers to some of humanity's most existential questions. Are we alone in the universe and where did that first light in the cosmos come from some 13 billion years ago? NASA leadership describing the moment they foresaw the kinds of images that Webb was capable of producing from its perch about a million miles away from Earth.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNKNOWN:  A sense of awe, and frankly got emotional. 
 
UNKNOWN:  Just moved me as a scientist, as an engineer, and as a human being.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
FISHER:  And this is it, the first image taken by the telescope released by NASA. It's called Webb's first deep field, and all of these lights they're not individual stars. Each one is an entire galaxy, and each galaxy is filled with billions of stars. If you zoom in on some of them you can even see that distinctive spiral shape. 
 
Webb also took some spectacular images of planets a little bit closer to home. Here's Jupiter and Neptune as you've never seen her. Finally, the pillars of creation where baby stars are born. It's part of the Eagle Nebula some 6,500 light years away and it was first made famous by Webb's predecessor, the Hubble Space Telescope in 1995. 
 
Finally, our number one space story of 2022.

FISHER:  For the first time in more than 50 years, NASA launching a rocket capable of carrying astronauts back to the moon. The Artemis rocket is NASA's first spacecraft since the Space Shuttle designed to launch people into orbit, years overdue, billions overbudget, it was rolled back from the launchpad to the safety of its hanger to escape Hurricane Ian, only to be rolled back out to the launchpad just in time to take a direct hit from Hurricane Nicole.
 
But just five days later, NASA making the gutsy call to give the third launch attempt a go. The Orion spacecraft then separated from the Artemis or SLS rocket beginning a nearly 26-day, 1.4-million-mile odyssey to the moon and back. 
 <br>[03:50:00]
 
The spacecraft traveled further into space than any spacecraft designed to carry humans had ever flown while beaming back spectacular images of the moon and our home. Orion's final test, its heat shield, successfully protecting the mannequins onboard the Artemis 1 mission from the blistering temperatures of reentry into the earth's atmosphere and blazing the way for Artemis 2 when four real astronauts will be onboard.

KING CHARLES III, KING OF THE UNITED KINGDOM:  Christmas is a particularly poignant time for all of us who have lost loved ones. We feel their absence at every familiar turn of the season and remember them in each cherished tradition. In the much-loved carol "Oh, Little Town of Bethlehem" we sing of how in thy dark street shineth the everlasting light. My mother's belief in the power of that light was an essential part of her faith in God, but also her faith in people, and it is one which I share with my whole heart.

QUEST:  The King's speech continues the royal tradition dating back more than 90 years. And the royal family, of course, went to church on Christmas Day. It was our first opportunity to see all members of the royal family since the funeral.
 
The legendary football player Pele is still in a Sao Paolo hospital. His daughter is saying through Instagram to thank the staff there who are treating him. He's been in hospital since late November for a respiratory infection. They are also re-evaluating the chemotherapy treatment for his colon cancer that was identified in September 2021. Pele's daughter ended her post by saying, "one more night with him."
 
And that is our report for this hour. I'm Richard Quest. I thank you for joining me on this holiday. Boxing Day in the Commonwealth. A very good day to you wherever you are. There's another hour of newsroom after the break. This is CNN.
