(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BECKY ANDERSON, CNN HOST, CONNECT THE WORLD: CNN reports from inside Haiti's capital as gang violence and unrest paralyze the country. It's 9 am 
 
 in Port au Prince, its 5 pm here in Abu Dhabi. I'm Becky Anderson. This is "Connect the World" here on CNN.
 
Happening this hour reports of a large fire and multiple casualties at Gaza's Al Shifa Hospital, where thousands of people are said to be 
 
 sheltering, the very latest on Israel's military operation there. Also this hour Russians prepared for six more years of Vladimir Putin after he's 
 
 secure a landslide victory in the country's presidential election. We'll have reaction from Moscow for you, later this hour.
 
Well the stock markets in New York will open in about 30 minutes from now if the futures are any indication, it looks as if the markets at least on 
 
 the NASDAQ's front will be higher investors do seem to be updating their expectations on interest rates given recent inflation data that has come in 
 
 slightly hot, of course, more on that bottom of the hour.
 
Well, Haiti is in the midst of an uprising not seen in years, gang members have been launching coordinated attacks against government institutions 
 
 there for weeks and now control 80 percent of Port au Prince, according to the United Nations, also choking off food supplies, fuel and water, pushing 
 
 Haiti into a humanitarian crisis.
 
Or as you can imagine, it is very difficult to get in out of the nation's capital as it is the epicenter of the gang violence. CNN's, David Culver 
 
 has been there. And just a short time ago, he filed this report from inside a police station. Have a look.
 
DAVID CULVER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: So police stations like this one here Port au Prince are main targets for gangs. They feel like as soon as they can 
 
 get hold of a station like this, they can then take seize, take control of much of the community. And they've tried coming after this when many of 
 
 times reinforcements have been built up not only because of the police, but because of the community.
 
They've built barricades all around here for the police station to function properly, they need to rely on the community and to have these almost 
 
 vigilantes building a lot of the barricades to keep out any gang members.
 
ANDERSON: Well, David also reported from a school where people are camping out trying to escape that rampant violence. Have a look.
 
CULVER: So this was a school here in Port au Prince, Haiti. And every single classroom that we pass, like this one here, has now become a dorm 
 
 room essentially. There are dozens, if not hundreds of people who have made this a recent campsite. And you can see a lot of them are following us 
 
 around and are curious to what we're doing because for them, it's a distraction, really.
 
And you talk to a lot of these folks, and they've come here in the past couple of weeks because of the most recent surge in violence and gangs 
 
 taking more and more territory here in the city. But these folks have also been on the run from their own homes for months if not years.
 
She just got this small bag of rice and she's going to cook it up for seven people, a lot of them tell me they don't know where their next meal is 
 
 going to be one little girl eight years old, saying she goes to bed every single night hungry. And a lot of that is because in the past two weeks in 
 
 particular, supply lines, especially for programs of international aid, like the World Food Programme had been severed.
 
So while these organizations are trying desperately to get food in, it's not just about getting them into Port au Prince. It's been about giving 
 
 them into communities like this. The challenges logistically are immense. They're dealing with this at a level that they have not faced prior.
 
I mean, it's unprecedented. And the pain sensed in kids eyes and their parents who feel helpless at this point, but for them, it's about pushing 
 
 forward. I asked one woman how you get up every day and move ahead with she said with the grace of God, but then admitted in the same breath, that 
 
 sometimes they feel they'd be better off dead than living. David Culver, CNN, Port au Prince, Haiti.
 
ANDERSON: All right, David Culver there, reporting from Port au Prince and to Gaza now and the enclave's largest hospital under siege today.
 <br>[09:05:00]
 
Israel's military raiding the Al Shifa complex where tens of thousands of civilians have been sheltering during the war and dropping leaflets wanting 
 
 civilians in the area to evacuate. Now the IDF says its intelligence indicated senior Hamas leaders have been operating inside the hospital and 
 
 that Israeli troops responded when they were fired out.
 
Well the Hamas-run Health Ministry reports a huge fire in the complex and says civilians have been killed and injured. Its government media office is 
 
 calling the raid a war crime. Well, this is happening as CNN learns Israel's Intelligence Chief is expected in Doha today where Qatar and Egypt 
 
 are working to revive truce talk.
 
Hamas's describe the latest proposal it submitted to mediators as logical or more on that coming up. There's a lot to talk about today, Paula 
 
 Hancocks connecting us from Doha. Let's start there with Nada Bashir, who is in London. Nada, you are keeping across the reporting and the detail as 
 
 we understand it, coming out of Gaza reminders where Al Shifa Hospital is and why, what is happening there is so significant?
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER: Well, look, Becky, you as we have seen in the past has repeatedly faced bombardment by the Israeli military in central 
 
 Gaza. And of course, this has stoked concerns because as we know, tens of thousands of civilians are believed to be sheltering in this hospital 
 
 complex.
 
According to the Palestinian Health Ministry, there are some 30,000 civilians on the hospital complex and we have been hearing from civilians 
 
 and eyewitnesses on the ground communicating with CNN, one eyewitness telling us that the siege the raid on Al Shifa Hospital is still ongoing, 
 
 it said to have started at around 2 am local times in the very early hours of the morning.
 
And of course, there is a state of panic and fear for many of the civilians there and the reports that we have been hearing are concerning to say the 
 
 least we are hearing that there are now military vehicles edging into the hospital complex bulldozing and excavating around the hospitals perimeters.
 
We have heard reports of live fire targeting the windows of the hospital building where there are people believed to be in sight. And some have told 
 
 CNN that they are afraid to move within and between buildings fearing for their lives that they are hearing loudspeakers from the Israeli military 
 
 calling people out.
 
And of course, we are still waiting for more confirmation in detail around the situation on the ground. We did hear earlier in the day from a doctor 
 
 at the Al Shifa Hospital who was sharing posts on X formerly known as Twitter sharing updates. They're saying the hospital had come under attack 
 
 by four Israeli strikes, he said and also that the surgical building of the hospital complex had caught fire.
 
And of course, this is a huge concern. There are concerns of course as to whether or not this could be considered a war crime as well considering the 
 
 level of civilian life at risk at this stage. The IDF, the Israeli military has said that is carrying out a raid on the Al Shifa Hospital that it has 
 
 called on civilians to evacuate and has allowed for safe evacuation routes.
 
That doesn't appear to be the case, according to civilians who have spoken to CNN and they have also said that, as you mentioned, Becky, they believe 
 
 that there are senior Hamas officials are operating within the complex. Of course CNN is not able to independently verify this claim.
 
But this is really painted a picture of what is the situation on the ground, particularly in and around Central and Northern Gaza. It is so 
 
 difficult to get those updates and as we know the vast majority of Gaza civilians are now concentrated in the south, but there are many still 
 
 stuck, still stranded in the besieged areas of Central and Northern Gaza.
 
Many of those in Al Shifa are also wounded, of course, desperately in need of medical care and simply unable to evacuate. This is a situation that we 
 
 have heard and seen time and time again now with Gaza's hospitals. But it appears that once again Al Shifa has become a target, despite the fact that 
 
 it is housing tens of thousands of civilians.
 
ANDERSON: Thank you Nada. Let me bring in Paula then no end to this conflict and not even on a temporary basis yet. That is, of course, what 
 
 these talks are about this week in Doha, once again, indirect talks between Israel and Hamas brokered or mediated by those in Qatar who have mediated 
 
 one truce, and that was back in November.
 
Obviously, the expectations are high on those teams that will be there this week and competing narratives from both sides as to where the sort of red 
 
 lines lie as far as the detail on any broker deal is concerned. What do we know at this point?
 <br>[09:10:00]
 
PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONSDENT: Well, Becky, we know from a source close to these talks that the Mossad Director David Barnea will be 
 
 discussing today this Monday with the Egyptian and Qatari mediators, Qatar's Prime Minister, Egyptian officials, and the Head of Mossad.
 
So there'll be discussing what Hamas counter proposed last week on Thursday of last week Hamas gave what it says was a logical offer for this 
 
 ceasefire. And that is what will be discussed today here in Doha. Now we know yesterday on Sunday, there was a war cabinet meeting.
 
There was a wider security cabinet meeting and they lay out, so we understand from an Israeli diplomatic source, the red lines that the Mossad 
 
 Director is able to go up to, and he has a strict set of rules. We understand that how much he could negotiate what he can agree to and then 
 
 where that red line is? We don't know what that red line is. We can speculate. Certainly we know that Hamas said that it does want an eventual 
 
 permanent ceasefire in Gaza.
 
And we've heard repeatedly from Israel, that they are not ready for that we heard just on Sunday, when the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
 
 saying that Israel will go into Rafah, the part of Southern Gaza where more than half the population is currently sheltering, saying that he didn't 
 
 give a time line of when it would start, but once it does start, it would last several weeks.
 
So what we hear from these talks right now is that first day of last week, Hamas laid out what their idea was they wanted according to officials and 
 
 sources, some 700 to 1000 Palestinian prisoners released in return, they would potentially give female hostages including IDF soldiers back to 
 
 Israel, including the elderly, the sick and the wounded hostages, which is believed to amount to around 40 hostages.
 
Of course, the major sticking points are still that Hamas wants the Israeli military to pull out of Gaza, which Israel refuses to do. And they want a 
 
 permanent ceasefire, which Israel says it is simply not ready for. But the hope is, they can at least agree on this phase one. And then they 
 
 potentially have six weeks of a ceasefire in order to work out the rest, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Good to have you, Paula, thank you. U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump at raising eyebrows and alarm bells, as he warns of 
 
 a quote, bloodbath, if he loses in November, I want to get to hear from him in his own words.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If you're listening President Xi and you and I are friends, but he understands 
 
 the way I deal, those big monster car manufacturing plants that you're building in Mexico right now. And you think you're going to get that you're 
 
 going to not hire Americans and you're going to sell the car as now.
 
We're going to put a 100 percent tariff on every single car that comes across the line, and you're not going to be able to sell those cars, if I 
 
 get elected. Now, if I don't get elected, it's going to be a bloodbath for the whole, that's going to be the least of it. It's going to be a bloodbath 
 
 for the country that will be the least of it. But they're not going to sell those cars.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, that's not all you had to say over the weekend, CNN, Alayna Treene following the very latest Trump controversy from Washington. So that 
 
 plus some explain.
 
ALAYNA TREENE, CNN REPORTER: Right, well, Becky, I was actually at that rally on Saturday. And I can tell you just having heard his remarks, and 
 
 you playing them again, there, it was not totally clear what he was referring to. Yes, they came, you know, sandwiched between him talking 
 
 about the auto industry talking about the economic impact on the auto industry.
 
But a lot of other people, including the Biden campaign quickly criticize those remarks, arguing that it seems to relate to political violence and 
 
 that Donald Trump wants another January 6, that's how one Biden campaign spokesperson put it. But look, Donald Trump's campaign also sought to 
 
 clarify those remarks.
 
Almost immediately after he finished his speech, they said that he was warning of an economic bloodbath. And today just moments ago, actually we 
 
 heard from the Former President himself, defending those comments on truth social and saying that again, he was talking about the auto industry.
 
I'm just going to read for you, Becky, a quick quote here from what he wrote. He said that the fake news media and their Democrat partners in the 
 
 destruction of our nation pretended to be shocked at the use of my word bloodbath, even though they fully understand that I was simply referring to 
 
 imports allowed by crooked Joe Biden which are killing the automobile industry.
 
But look, Becky, I think, you know, you mentioned that's not the only you know, eye raising eyebrow raising comments that Donald Trump made over the 
 
 weekend.
 <br>[09:15:00]
 
He did use very dark rhetoric throughout that speech Xi, at one point use dehumanizing language to talk about immigrants, one point saying he doesn't 
 
 consider them people and calling them animals. He also repeated a vow that he has made to free those convicted for their role on January 6, use the 
 
 term hostages something is used in the past that has been widely criticized, but not just by Democrats also Republicans and even his Former 
 
 Vice President.
 
We heard Former Vice President Mike Pence over the weekend condemn that language and Donald Trump's use of the term hostages. And he noted that 
 
 it's especially concerning given the current environment where you see many American hostages still being held in Gaza, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Good to have you. Thank you. To a rare sight in Cuba, public protests, crowds of people gathered in Cuba's second largest city on Sunday 
 
 protesting power cuts and the food shortages. This video shows police trying to disperse the crowds or communist run Island has been hit in 
 
 recent weeks with scarcities basic items with.
 
Cuban officials blame on U.S. sanctions, a top Cuban official also accused U.S. on acts of trying to incite violence and unrest. Massive protests to 
 
 elsewhere this time over an election in Russia that is being called neither free nor fair. We live in Moscow as Vladimir Putin secures a fifth term in 
 
 office.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: An easy landslide for Vladimir Putin after an election that offered no real alternatives. See, Russian President is taken more than 87 
 
 percent of the vote, securing a fifth term in office. Now Mr. Putin says the result sends a strong message to his detractors.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA: There are a lot of tasks ahead of us. But when we are consolidated and I think it is now understood to everyone, 
 
 no matter how hard anyone tries to frighten us, whoever tries to suppress us our will, our consciousness. No one has ever managed to have done such a 
 
 thing in history. And it won't happen now. And it won't happen in the future, never.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, there's growing international condemnation about the conditions around this election. Matthew Chance is in Moscow. Matthew, 
 
 explain if you will.
 
MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, that's right. I mean, look, I mean, the problem with the election is that even though it 
 
 was a massive victory for Vladimir Putin, opposition candidates were simply not permitted to run.
 <br>[09:20:00]
 
And so, you know, it's in the context of a massive repression of dissent inside the country that Putin has come out with this extraordinary election 
 
 victory which has given him something in the region of 87 percent of the votes that were cast, look an election, independent election observer group 
 
 called Golos, which has been recently kind of designated a foreign agent here.
 
But it's been a sort of mainstay of independent election monitoring of elections in Russia over the years I said that this election did not 
 
 fulfill the basic function of an election, which is to convey the real mood of citizens. It says the election also failed to allow people to decide on 
 
 the future of Russia independently and freely.
 
And that's Becky, why there were so many instances of protests of individuals and acts of defiance of individuals as this vote unfolded.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHANCE (voice-over): Another flash of defiance in Russia's presidential vote. The opposition called this midday against Putin supporters gathering 
 
 at polling stations across the country in a show of solidarity. It's what Alexei Navalny Russia's late Opposition Leader had urged before he suddenly 
 
 died.
 
CHANCE: Well, the Russian authorities say that anyone who attends an unauthorized. Protests will be dealt with severely, but you can see it's 
 
 just after 12 o'clock here in Moscow. And a lot of people have turned out at this one polling station to cast their ballots. It's not a protest, but 
 
 it is an indication of just how many people here are -- Alexei Navalny's -- Why have you come now to cast your vote?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Because they come to.
 
CHANCE: And he wants you to see all these people?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yeah, want to come together and see each other in person.
 
CHANCE: Why -- come now at 12 o'clock.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You know why? I think everyone can stay in this queue know why.
 
CHANCE (voice-over): For three days Russians have been voting in an election, which President Putin was always certain to win. Scattered acts 
 
 of disruption have exposed the division. In several polling stations, dye was poured into ballot boxes to ruin paper votes already cast.
 
Across Russia, a number of voting centers were hit with arson attacks. But officials insist these deeply flawed presidential elections in which the 
 
 opposition wasn't even allowed to stand were free and fair. Compared to the last presidential vote in 2018, received only half as many complaints.
 
Russia's Chief Human Rights Commissioner tells state television. I don't remember such active, deeply monitored elections here. But the defiance of 
 
 some Russians has also been exceptional. The simmering discontent and the Kremlin's tightly controlled Russia briefly boiling up to the surface.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHANCE (on camera): Yep, briefly, Becky, boiling up to the surface. But the Kremlin and Vladimir Putin is sort of sweeping that under the carpet saying 
 
 that this vote represents an overwhelming sort of act of support from the majority of people in the country. They're saying -- Putin is saying he 
 
 will press ahead with all of the grandiose tasks that he has set himself those were his words for the country.
 
He particularly mentioned the special military operation, what he calls the war in Ukraine and the bolstering the further strengthening of Russia's 
 
 military in the years ahead, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: And mentioned by name of one man who he has, until now at least have chosen to remain nameless that of Alexei Navalny. What is he said 
 
 about his former now deceased opponent?
 
CHANCE: Well, you're right. This it was a post-election event late last night in which Vladimir Putin took questions from journalists. He mentioned 
 
 he was asked about Navalny, and he mentioned Alexei Navalny for the first time by name, it's extraordinary. He's never actually uttered the words 
 
 Alexei Navalny in one breath, publicly before.
 
And he also confirmed that he had given his approval for the possibility of Alexei Navalny to be swapped in a prisoner exchange. But he said that was 
 
 just a few days before Navalny died, but, you know, then that sad event as he called it happened, and you know, Alexei Navalny died in prison, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: So what does a Russia led by Vladimir Putin over the next six years look like briefly?
 <br>[09:25:00]
 
CHANCE: Well, very briefly, I think, as he said, he's going to press ahead with the war in Ukraine; we're not going to see a back down on that. We 
 
 also have to look at a political environment where the main opposition leaders are either dead like Navalny jailed or exiled or just not permitted 
 
 to get any oxygen publicly. 
 
And so this is very much become much more of an autocratic state and the sort of remnants of democracy are just sort of on the surface. But in fact, 
 
 it's becoming an increasingly oppressive place for people who have a different opinion to the Kremlin. 
 
ANDERSON: Good to have you sir, thank you. Matthew Chance is in Moscow. All this is Vladimir Putin is raising the prospect of a serious escalation in 
 
 Russia's war on Ukraine. Should the West send troops there responding to comments by France's President? Mr. Putin said no good would come of such a 
 
 move. Have a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT: I think that anything is possible in the modern world. But I've already said this. And it is clear to everyone that 
 
 this will be just one step away from a full scale World War III. I don't think anybody is interested in this. NATO military are present there. We 
 
 know this. We hear French speech there and English speech. There's nothing good in this. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Vladimir Putin. Let's get you up to speed on some of the other stories that are on our radar right now folks. And North Korea testified 
 
 three ballistic missiles on Monday. That was in the morning and that was according to Japan. It's believed the missiles fell in the sea near the 
 
 East Coast of the Korean Peninsula. 
 
The test came as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was attending a summit in South Korea. Well, there's been an escalation of attacks along 
 
 the Pakistani Afghan border. At least 13 people have been killed in back and forth strike since Saturday. Audit tensions have been on the rise since 
 
 the Taliban took over Afghanistan in 2021. 
 
And if you'd like to create AI videos on YouTube, we have got some news for you. The rules on putting your images on YouTube are changing, stay with us 
 
 to find out what that may mean for you.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:30:00]
 
ANDERSON: We are out of the gate. Trading has started on Wall Street care of Cosmetics Company Elf ringing the Trading Day in that size lips face, 
 
 apparently ringing the Opening Bell there on the New York Stock Exchange. And if you wonder why it is that we bring you this every day, well the 
 
 tradition is behind the ringing in of the Trading Day, you can find more about that online, the piece published just over the weekend. 
 
This is the state of the markets and they too are out of the gate in a positive fashion. Welcome back. I'm Becky Anderson in Abu Dhabi; you are 
 
 watching "Connect the World". And it should now be easier to tell if a video you are watching on YouTube has been made using artificial 
 
 intelligence. Starting today YouTube is requiring creators who upload AI generated images to label them as such. 
 
And another big push on AI is coming from Mr. Elon Musk. "The New York Times" says he has released the raw computer code behind the chatbot Grok, 
 
 that's Grok with a K, which his company X AI is developing not to be confused with Grok with a Q, which is a manufacturer of GPUs very much part 
 
 of the AI world.
 
Now this is all part of Musk's campaign against Open AI which he slammed recently, among other reasons for not embracing open source software 
 
 development. Well, I'm going to bring in CNN Business Writer, Clare Duffy. She joins us from Los Osos in California. Clare, what do you know about 
 
 these new requirements? Let's start with the YouTube AI generated imagery. What do we know at this point? And how will it ultimately impact the end 
 
 user here? 
 
CLARE DUFFY, CNN BUSINESS WRITER: Right Becky, so what the end user is going to see now on YouTube is, in many cases, a label for videos that 
 
 contain AI generated content that will be in the description field of the video. But YouTube says that for certain potentially sensitive topics like 
 
 videos that have to do with politics, they may see a label more prominently in the video player. 
 
This of course, an effort by YouTube to make it more transparent when videos contain AI generated images or videos, or even audio that could be 
 
 potentially realistic and confusing to users who see it, who might think that it's real. Creators will now be required to add such a label to their 
 
 videos when they contain that realistic, potentially realistic looking AI generated content. 
 
And if they don't, they could potentially face penalties such as removing the ability to monetize or make money from their videos, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: I wonder if that's going to be the fine or whatever it is, will be big enough to actually have people that comply. Anyway, we will see. 
 
 Elon Musk is releasing the code for the chatbot Grok. Now for those who are watching the AI space, it will be well aware of what Grok is up to. But for 
 
 those who may not be across this, what is Grok? And why is Musk doing this Clare? 
 
DUFFY: Right, Becky. So Grok is the AI generated chatbot sort of similar to chat GPT from Elon Musk's own X AI startup, the startup that he's created 
 
 to try to rival some of the big players in this AI space like Google, Open AI, Facebook, Microsoft, some of these really big players. Musk has said 
 
 that their chatbots are too in his words too woke. He believes that they have sort of a philosophical bent to them that he disagrees with.
 
And so he's created this Grok chatbot to try to counter that and create a different perspective. It's trained on data from X, the platform formerly 
 
 known as Twitter. And his move now to make it open source the code behind this chatbot is in his mind, I think an effort to make it so that people 
 
 can understand why they're getting the results that they're getting from the chatbot when they ask it a question.
 
The code could potentially give some insights about the data that it's trained on, and how the model is sort of thinking through the questions 
 
 that it's getting from users. This of course, also coming as Elon Musk is suing Open AI. He's alleged that the company has abandoned its non-profit 
 
 mission and its agreements to open source all of its technology and make it available to the public. 
 
Now there is sort of a debate in the opening or in the AI space I should say about whether it's actually a good idea to open source the technology 
 
 or not. On one hand, you have proponents like Musk, who say that this will make it more transparent. But there are critics who say that it could 
 
 potentially open up the technology for misuse and abuse, Becky. 
 <br>[09:35:00]
 
ANDERSON: It's fascinating, isn't it? Well keep across it for us. Thank you. Now doctor's visit needed and no prescription, online sales begin 
 
 today for Opill, the first over the counter birth control approved in the United States. Now some major retail pharmacies there, including CVS and 
 
 Walgreens have also said they will offer Opill once they received their shipments.
 
And it is expected to benefit women with limited access to contraception, including those in remote rural areas. While Opill was approved with no age 
 
 restrictions, but it is not known yet see if that might change in some states. But it was a roller coaster game and what a game it was. And it 
 
 took extra time for it to be decided who came out on top as Manchester United faced off against Liverpool, that just ahead. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: Welcome back. You're watching "Connect the World" with me Becky Anderson, just after 25 to six Local Time here in the UAE 9:37 or so 38 on 
 
 the East Coast of America. Well, officials in Iceland say there's been no damage so far to critical infrastructure from the volcanic eruption near 
 
 Reykjavik. That's thanks to barriers that were put up there. 
 
The Meteorological Office says that while the eruption is not over, lava flow has slowed substantially. Now seismic activity also decreased in the 
 
 area overnight. Airports on the island are now operating normally. Well authorities had been warning for weeks that another eruption was imminent. 
 
 And for some tourists over the weekend that was part of the appeal. CNN's Michael Holmes picks up the story. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A siren whales at the world famous Blue Lagoon spa in Iceland, the orange plume lighting up the night 
 
 sky means it's time to evacuate again. For some tourists this is part of the excitement one of the reasons they came to Iceland to see its active 
 
 volcanoes and there has been a lot of activity lately. 
 
This is the fourth time since December that a volcano has erupted in Southwest Iceland less than an hour from the country's capital Reykjavik. 
 
 The fissure is estimated to be roughly three kilometers long and flowing once again towards the town of Grindavik where emergency teams are working 
 
 to reinforce the town's defenses.
 
HALLDOR GEIRSSON, GEOPHYSICIST: Almost if the flow is going east of the town towards the sea, so it looks like the barriers are really doing the 
 
 job they were designed for. 
 <br>[09:40:00]
 
HOLMES (voice-over): Grindavik was first evacuated in November, after a series of earthquakes split open roads in the town, heralding the 
 
 reawakening of a volcanic system, which had been dormant for nearly 800 years. Then lava first burst through the surface in December, followed by a 
 
 second eruption in January that destroyed several homes and buildings in the area. 
 
A third eruption last month demolished a hot water pipeline and cut off heat to more than 20,000 people. The last few residents of Grindavik who 
 
 had returned to their homes have been evacuated again. And Icelandic authorities have declared a state of emergency for the area, calling this 
 
 the most powerful eruption on the Reykjanes peninsula since 2021. 
 
As in previous eruptions, the Blue Lagoon spa once again closed its doors, interrupting the vacations of some tourists, some who may have gotten a 
 
 little more of the Icelandic volcano experience than they imagined.
 
MELISSA EZAIR, TOURIST: I've never experienced anything like that before. I'll be honest, I wasn't scared or anything. I hope everybody got out OK, 
 
 but it really was an experience that and I'm like at the same time wow. How could this happen?

ANDERSON: Well, the English rivals Manchester United and Liverpool thrilled fans with what was an epic FA Cup match on Sunday and it was Man United 
 
 coming out top an extra time for three. Amanda Davies joins me now. That was some match. I know and I know because he's one of my producers here 
 
 flying back who's a Liverpool fan. 
 
He flew back from Dublin here overnight and he left when it was all squared. He got back to find his beloved team didn't quite, didn't quite 
 
 make it against Man U. I mean he was thoroughly disappointed but it was quite the game. 
 
AMANDA DAVIES, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR: Yeah, I mean he can't have it all there was Ireland celebrating the rugby success wasn't there on Saturday.
 
ANDERSON: That's right.
 
DAVIES: But yeah left disappointed from a Liverpool fan perspective on Sunday. But you know, this is talked about has been talked about for years 
 
 as the great rivalry of English football. But frankly Manchester United for their part in recent times been letting the side down, haven't they, in 
 
 terms of that rivalry. But this was one of those occasions that will be talked about at Old Trafford for years to come.
 
Eric ten Hog the United Boss talking about it as the moments that his side need to use to jump on to the next level would didn't only put United into 
 
 the semifinal of the FA Cup. But for Liverpool and Jurgen Klopp of course it ends those quadruple hopes of trophies in his final year. So where do 
 
 they go from here, so much to discuss in just a couple of minutes, Becky. 
 
ANDERSON: Good stuff. "World Sport" is up next. We are back top of the hour stay with us.
