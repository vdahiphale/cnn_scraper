THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello from Buffalo, everyone. It`s your boy Coy and we have missed you. We hope the start of your New Year has been full of 
 
 love and positive energy. I know we`re feeling it now that we are back.
 
I`m Coy Wire. This is CNN 10.
 
And we start with a remarkable story that has transpired here in Buffalo, New York, this past week. Bills` player Damar Hamlin was tragically 
 
 injured, suffering cardiac arrest in the first quarter of their game last Monday. And in an unprecedented move, Bills players and head coach Sean 
 
 McDermott refused to play on. In the past, games have always played on, but these NFL players prioritize their mental health over the outcome of the 
 
 game. 
 
Hamlin spent the following days in critical condition but eventually showed enough progress to surprise the team with a video called days before their 
 
 final regular season game. The team said that`s all they needed. The game was magical.
 
Bills head coach Sean McDermott said it was going to be a celebration of life, the power of three, Damar`s jersey number was everywhere. Then, 
 
 powerful moment, the medical workers and training staff who pounced in with poise and precision to save Damar Hamlin`s life walk to midfield getting an 
 
 ovation as big as any we`ve ever heard.
 
Then, game time. And on the opening play, the Bills first since the tragic injury goosebumps, when Nyheim Hines took the kickoff back for a touchdown. 
 
 It had been three years and three months since the Bills had done that before. Bills star quarterback Josh Allen said it was spiritual, bone 
 
 chilling, and Damar Hamlin watching from the hospital tweeted: God behind all this no coincidence.
 
Buffalo would go on to win 35-23.
 
Here`s star offensive lineman Dion Dawkins on what he`s learned through all of this.

DION DAWKINS, BUFFALO BILLS:  No second, no breath, no event, no situation is promised. It could be a drastic this or this at any moment. And I have 
 
 truly learned to be a better father, to be a better partner, to be a better person.

WIRE:  Remember lovely people, we can find strength through our struggles, find heroes through heartache. The world has come together to support Damar 
 
 Hamlin. His GoFundMe charity to raise money to buy toys for kids originally set out to raise twenty five hundred dollars. It has skyrocketed to more 
 
 than $8.5 million so far.
 
All right. Next up, we`re bringing you to Washington, D.C. with an update on what`s happening in the U.S. Congress. Every time a new political party 
 
 gains the majority in the House of Representatives, a new speaker of the House is elected. The speaker is in charge of the House`s legislative 
 
 agenda, its committee assignments, and deciding on voting procedures. 
 
Democrat Nancy Pelosi stepped down from her role as speaker of the House in November following the U.S. midterm elections where Republicans won back 
 
 control of the House. This week, California Congressman Kevin McCarthy was elected speaker, but it wasn`t easy. McCarthy made numerous concessions 
 
 over the course of many days before he finally earned a majority and was elected on the 15th round of voting. 
 
To secure the gavel, McCarthy and his allies overcame opposition from a group of conservative critics within the Republican Party. It was the 
 
 longest contest in 164 years. Many Republicans fear this may make it harder to govern in the future while Democrats who voted unanimously for their 
 
 candidate, the minority leader Hakeem Jeffries, were happy to see what many called chaos for the opposing party.
 
More now from politics reporter Eva McKend who has more on the proceeding from the nation`s capital.

EVA MCKEND, CNN NATIONAL POLITICS REPORTER:  House Speaker Kevin McCarthy securing a victory at long last by picking off his detractors one by one, 
 
 doing so through making some key concessions. Namely, it will require only one member to trigger a vote that could potentially lead to ousting the 
 
 House speaker.
 
Take a listen to what McCarthy had to say after the vote.
 
REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  Don`t judge us on how we start, watch how we finish. And I think by having the disruption now really 
 
 built the trust with one another and learned how to work together. What we`re going to have to find in our mindset is that we have to front load 
 
 that we have to think about and work on the bills with a microcosm of the conference before we even start writing it and that`s really what we 
 
 learned here.
 
MCKEND:  So you can hear McCarthy there really striking in optimistic tone Republicans have done so as well, arguing that this week really illustrated 
 
 that this is what democracy looks like. That sometimes it is messy -- well, Democrats, they have a different view. They say that the chaotic episodes 
 
 that played out on the House floor time and time again really illustrate that Republicans are not prepared to govern. 
 
They will face another key test. This new Republican leadership on Monday when they have to vote on a House rules package.

WIRE:  Okay. Yesterday, President Joe Biden made his first trip in office to the U.S.-Mexico border where he visited El Paso, Texas. This follows a 
 
 major immigration policy announcement by the president who visited the border Sunday for a first-hand view of the border enforcement operation. 
 
 Biden has faced backlash in recent months from both Democrats in his own party and Republicans who believe he has not managed immigration issues 
 
 well while in office.
 
Democrats condemn recent immigration policies as human rights violations while Republicans say the president has not done enough to limit border 
 
 crossing amid recent surge. 
 
We`ll hear now from Arlette Saenz, a CNN White House correspondent based in D.C. who has more on the details of the visit.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  El Paso, Texas, a city that has seen a surge in migrants in recent weeks. Officials here at the White 
 
 House say the president wants to see get an assessment of the border security situation on the ground there, and he will meet and hear from 
 
 officials with Customs and Border Protection. The president will also be joined on this trip by Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. 
 
And officials have also said he the president wants to learn more about the efforts to stem fentanyl flow into the country. 
 
Now, this all comes as the president has faced pressure not just to visit the border but also address these issues regarding the border, as it has 
 
 quickly become a political liability for President Biden. The Texas governor, a Republican, Greg Abbott, said that it`s about time that 
 
 President Biden paid that visit down to the U.S.-Mexico border. 
 
But on the other hand, the president has also accused Republicans of engaging in demagoguery, saying that they need to come to the table to pass 
 
 comprehensive immigration reform which this White House says is the only way to fully ease these issues relating to the border.

WIRE:  Next up, a snowy owl normally found in the Arctic tundra shows up 3,000 miles away amid palm trees and beaches of sunny southern California. 
 
 The extremely rare sighting has transfixed a California community, but as for how the owl arrived there, who-who could know? Maybe CNN reporter 
 
 Jeanne Moos.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JEANNE MOOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  It`s a head scratcher, all right, how did a snowy owl that normally lives in the Arctic tundra end up 
 
 amid the palm trees of southern California?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I consider an honor to be able to see the bird.
 
MOOS:  Bird lovers are flocking to Cypress, California, to get a peek.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  That`s so exciting. I see a bird that does not belong here.
 
MOOS:  Yeah. Well, not everyone is excited.
 
JARET DAVEY, WETLANDS AND WILDLIFE CARE CENTER:  There were all these crows that were just dive bombing it and trying to like scare it away and the owl 
 
 was just unfazed.
 
MOOS:  Not so unfazed, the birder who posted this video Nicholas Belardes admits, "I teared up".
 
A marine biologist told "The New York Times" it`s like seeing Santa Claus on a beach. 
 
Wildlife experts are watching the owl like a hawk, even to the point of climbing up a ladder to retrieve a pellet regurgitated by the raptor.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Oh so a treasure right away.
 
MOOS:  The birds expel the indigestible parts of their meals, so the Wetlands and Wildlife Care Center decided to check on the owl`s taste in 
 
 California cuisine.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This looks like the skull. Yeah, look at that, the skull of some kind of rodent.
 
MOOS:  We know what it ate but we don`t know how it got here. Is it an escaped illegal pet? Or did it hitch a ride on a freighter from up north? 
 
 Or maybe it just got disoriented and flew too far south?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It looks nice and fluffy.
 
MOOS:  Jeanne Moos, CNN, New York.
