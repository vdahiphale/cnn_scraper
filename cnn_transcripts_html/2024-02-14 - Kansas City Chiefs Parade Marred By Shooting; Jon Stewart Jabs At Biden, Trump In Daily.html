 <br>[22:01:29]
 
GAYLE KING, CNN HOST: Welcome, welcome to King Charles. We were so excited for the show tonight, weren't we?
 
CHARLES BARKLEY, CNN HOST: Yes.
 
KING: Because we were off last week because of the Super bowl. We were both in Vegas, and there was so much to talk about. But right before the show started, you heard the news that we've heard, and we're going to pivot to that because we cannot start the way we wanted to.
 
It's also Valentine's Day, by the way, happy Valentine's Day to all of you. Because of something that has become increasingly a common occurrence here in this country. No other country has the problem that we have when it comes to gun violence in this country. It's happened again. This time, a joyful gathering ended with shots fired and people fleeing for their lives, frantically calling loved ones. This was in Kansas City, guys, today as they were celebrating the Super bowl parade.
 
And I'm curious, what was your initial reaction because this happened as we were planning for the show this afternoon?
 
BARKLEY: Yes, just sadness. You wake up, we're going to celebrate the Chiefs winning the Super Bowl, and that person is not going to get home. Then you factor in all the injuries, and apparently most of them were kids. And I just feel sadness because you got the greatest country in the world, any fool can go out and buy a gun anytime. They don't do great background checks. And you would think like everything else in our country has become divided between Democrats and Republicans, and that makes it even worse. I'm like, wait, the Republicans don't want gun control?
 
KING: But this is such a human issue. And as we sit here today, we have to say the story is still in flux. At last count, there were at least 20 people. They were saying, many of them children. But, again, we have to say that this story is still changing and we don't have the exact numbers.
 
BARKLEY: Yes, but the story, just as always, you go back and the lady shot at Joel Osteen church over the weekend.
 
KING: Yes.
 
BARKLEY: Gayle, it should be hard to get guns. Like --
 
KING: You're a gun owner.
 
BARKLEY: I'm a gun owner and I'm a gun guy, but it should be hard to get a gun with the technology we have today. As far as learning everything you did in your life, you should not be able to go in a store and get a gun in 15, 20 minutes. You should not order those ghost guns on the internet.
 
KING: But you believe, though, Charles, in the right for people to own guns?
 
BARKLEY: I do, but it should be hard to get them.
 
KING: To get it, yes.
 
BARKLEY: Gayle, let me ask you a question. Well, this is not a fair question to you, but if a normal person went into, let's say, hypothetically, a Mercedes-Benz dealership, they wouldn't let them say, hey, I'll just take whatever you tell me, I can afford it, they would do a comprehensive background check on a car. You don't think we should do that with guns?
 
We should do -- and I'm not trying to simplify it. I'm not trying to be flippant, but I can't walk in a Mercedes-Benz dealership and say, I'll take the best one you got. They're like, well, we need to see some bank records of what kind of job you got and everything. It should at least be that on guns.
 
KING: But you know what scares me about this is that you're at a parade, I really do feel in this country, you really don't feel safe anywhere. I feel that we are a walking roulette that it could happen at any time to anybody, anywhere. Here we are at the Chiefs celebration. This is the sixth anniversary of the school shooting at Parkland High School. Nothing has changed in this country.
 
And I find it so frustrating that I don't want us to become desensitized to this. That's what concerns me. I don't want us to think that this is just no big deal, because this is still a very big deal in this country. And I don't want us to just think this is how we have to live.
 <br>[22:05:01]
 
But, Charles, this is how we're living in this country.
 
BARKLEY: Yes, but that's because we don't put enough pressure on our politicians. We don't hold them accountable for anything. We don't hold them accountable for the immigration mess we have going on. But immigration is obviously really important. But this gun thing, like I say, you can never get desensitized.
 
KING: Right.
 
BARKLEY: But we're used to it now. I mean, we're used to it. And they ruined such a joyous occasion. Those guys, men -- football, I'd really admire football players, what they put their bodies through. And this is supposed to be a joyous occasion, but somebody is not going home and some people's lives probably going to be changed forever because they got shot or something.
 
KING: I want to bring in somebody who spent a huge part of his career trying to figure out, trying to figure this out, how to solve the gun violence issue here in this country. That's former top adviser to President Barack Obama, David Axelrod joins us. David, thank you for joining us. It's good to see you.
 
DAVID AXELROD, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Yes, I'm sorry on such a sad occasion. It's not that we anticipated it.
 
KING: I know. But I think about you and the Obama administration. He has often said that one of the worst days of his life was a school shooting at Sandy Hook, one of the worst days of that administration. And many people thought, okay, finally things will change in this country. And we sit here today in 2024 and we're still talking about this. What is the problem? What is it going to take? David. Yes, go ahead.
 
AXELROD: Well, look, Charles says we got to hold the politicians accountable. The politicians are afraid of voters. That's why -- I mean, even though the majority of Americans agree with almost everything that you said, Charles, there are politicians who are responding to small cohorts of people within their parties, within their communities who participate in primary elections, and they're afraid. They're afraid to take on.
 
Listen, Donald Trump on Saturday night, I guess Friday night, spoke to an NRA group, I think, in Pennsylvania, and he said, I didn't do one thing about guns in the last four years and I won't do anything about it in the next four years. And he got a big hand. And that has become sort of orthodoxy within the Republican Party.
 
And, you know, look, I think that there are politicians who are willing to risk their careers for principles, but there are a lot of politicians whose first priority is to get re-elected.
 
KING: Yes. But you know what, David, I don't think it's a Democratic issue or a Republican issue. I really do think it's a human issue. And when you say the politicians are afraid, why are they afraid when the majority of the people in this country say that they want changes in gun laws, they want to make it safer for all of us who are walking around, they want some restrictions on gun owners?
 
AXELROD: Yes. More than 60 percent say that. And when you look at issues like universal background checks, Charles was talking about having rigorous background checks, that is something that is in the 70s and 80s and higher in many polls. But there is this fear.
 
And within -- Gayle, you say it's not a Democrat, Republican issue, but largely within the Republican Party, largely within the Republican Party, there is a fear that in primary elections, you will be beaten by a candidate who says they are not strongly supporting the Second Amendment and therefore they should be defeated. And they treat every gun safety law as a camel's nose under the tent. And they don't want to act because they fear it's going to cost them their jobs.
 
But their inaction is costing people their children, their wives, their husbands, their -- and, you know, this thing day, I -- not to touch a sensitive point with Charles, but I went to six parades in Chicago when the Bulls won the championships. I went to the Cubs championship. And it was always such a wonderful day because the entire community would come together, people of different races and backgrounds, rich people, poor people, all because this was a community celebration. And you bring your kids.
 
And to have that disrupted -- obviously, the worst are these school shootings, because you send your precious children to school and you expect them to come home, and those are the worst. But there's something about just us coming together as a community, and we can't even come together as a community, people of different political points of view and so on. I'm sure there were Republicans and Democrats in that crowd.
 
KING: Exactly.
 
AXELROD: So, it does underscore the interactability (ph) of it.
 <br>[22:10:00]
 
I hope we keep at it.
 
You know, there was a modest gun law passed after Uvalde in, I guess, 2022. That was the first time we've done anything in years. It took some modest step forward, but they were real step forward. And Senator Cornyn from Texas and Senator Murphy from Connecticut negotiated this on a bipartisan basis.
 
I do think, you know, you're absolutely right that a majority feels that there should be stronger laws, but I think that needs to become a voting issue for people. They need to say, you know, it's a voting issue for people who don't want any changes in the laws.
 
KING: And vote the people out. Yes, vote the people out that don't support what you believe. In the meantime, we're playing the game of mourn, pray, repeat, mourn, pray, repeat, and nothing changes.
 
AXELROD: And numbness, numbness, which I think you point out rightly, is the greatest threat of all is if we come to accept this as the norm. We have exponentially, 46 percent of the most privately owned guns in the world are here in the U.S. We only have 4 percent of the world's population. So, it's no wonder that we have more gun violence and more deaths than anywhere in the world.
 
KING: All right. David, we don't want you to go. We want to change subjects after the break. We hope you'll stay around because we want to talk about Jon Stewart. Jon Stewart came back came back to us. He returned to The Daily Show after going right after, and he wasted no time going after President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump. We'll discuss that right after the break.
 
We'll be right back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[22:15:37]
 
KING: We are back with David Axelrod. He's top adviser to President Barack Obama. We want to talk to you about the return of Jon Stewart, David, to The Daily Show, because the numbers were ginormous. Nearly 2 million people watched the beloved comedian on Monday night. And the big question was, how did he do? Here's a look.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JON STEWART, HOST, THE DAILYT SHOW: The Super Bowl was on Sunday and the president was offered a chance as per tradition to do an interview where millions and millions of people could see him competently and clearly lay out his 2024 agenda, or he could just turn that down and do what this is.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The Biden-Harris campaign joined TikTok over the weekend. The first video was released during the Super Bowl and it shows President Biden answering questions related to the big game.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Game or halftime show?
 
JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: Game.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Jason Kelce or Travis Kelce?
 
BIDEN: Mama Kelce, I understand, she makes great chocolate chip cookies.
 
STEWART: Fire everyone, everyone. How do you go on TikTok and end up looking older?
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KING: God, it's so nice to have Jon Stewart back. While neither of the leading presidential candidates were spared, the spotlight was certainly on 81-year-old Joe Biden.
 
So, we have somebody with us who knows what it's like to work in a White House and be on the receiving end of a John Stewart joke.
 
David Axelrod is back. David, here's a question for you and your colleagues, because you had to weather criticism from Jon Stewart. I'm wondering, what happens, what happens in the White House after taking a hit like that on national T.V.?
 
AXELROD: Yes, it's not good. You know, I still have tire tracks on my rear end from a couple of interviews I did with Jon Stewart during that period. I saw after his show on Monday, people saying, oh, jeez, you know, he used to go after conservatives, and now he's going after President Biden. No, he used to go after everybody. And he was unsparing.
 
And, you know, he sort of sheaths the truths in humor, but they sting, and they go viral. And that's why he's had impact. And it was kind of incredible that nine years later, he comes back gray-haired and bearded, but he still has it, you know?
 
And I'm sure in the White House, it landed very badly, because, you know, this is a problem for them right now and it's a complicated problem to solve, because it's not about any particular issue. It's about something that you really can't change.
 
BARKLEY: So, my question is -- I actually love John Stewart. I thought he was, I thought his points were great. I was glad to have him back. And one of the problems we have, we have two-minute networks that play left or right. He criticized both guys, but he's getting a lot of heat from, quote/unquote, the left for criticizing Biden. Number one, do you think that's fair or you thought he did just a good job of criticizing both candidates?
 
AXELROD: No, I had no problem with what he did. But listen, Charles, here's the situation. I think that there are a lot of people on the left and a lot of Democrats who, whatever their feelings about whether Biden should have run or not, their belief now is he's the candidate and Donald Trump is on the other side and Donald Trump cannot win, and, therefore, you should not criticize Biden in any way because you might harm him in that mission of defeating Trump.
 
The problem is that these things that Jon Stewart was bringing up are things that voters are thinking. It's not like if you don't talk about it, they're not thinking it. They're thinking it. So, what do you do about it is the real question. And I think more than anything else, if I could climb into Jon Stewart's head, what he's saying is do something about it. You can't change how old you are, but change up your strategy so at least you are on the offense and people can see you in a more engaged way.
 
BARKLEY: Do you -- let me ask you one more question.
 <br>[22:20:00]
 
Are you hopeful, pessimistic, optimistic or scared for the next year?
 
AXELROD: You sound like a pollster, Charles. I am wary of the next year because I think the consequences of this election are probably greater than any we've ever experienced. I know people say that all the time.
 
KING: We said that last time. Yes, we said that at the last election, too, David. Yes.
 
AXELROD: And how did it end?
 
KING: Yes. AXELROD: So, I mean, I think that Trump 2.0 will be more -- he'll be like the delta variant of democracy. He'll be 1,000 times more virulent and harder to control.
 
KING: Do you think -- before you go, David, because we have to wrap up and bring in our next guest, but do you think Jon Stewart can move the needle in this election? You know the times have changed.
 
AXELROD: I think Jon Stewart will be a factor because the things that Jon Stewart says, the way he says them, the honesty with which he speaks, that creates viral moments. And as you know, the way people get information today isn't just by watching. It's mostly by the bits they get on their phones in viral, on TikTok and Instagram and so on. He creates those moments, and, therefore, I think he can have a big impact, particularly on younger voters.
 
KING: All right. Thank you very much, David Axelrod, for sticking around.
 
AXELROD: Okay. Great to see you guys.
 
BARKLEY: Thank you very much.
 
KING: Thanks. Bob Marley, One Love star Kingsley Ben-Adir and Bob Marley's real life son, that would be Ziggy, discuss the movie the man and his music. So, let's go out with Exodus from the new movie.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[22:26:02]
 
KING: You can't help but smile when you hear the music. It's called Jamming, and that's the one and only Bob Marley. Why are we talking about it today? Because Bob Marley, One Love, there's a new movie celebrating the Jamaican reggae artist turned global icon, it is out today.
 
So, we're very excited Charles because --
 
BARKLEY: We're talking about it all day.
 
KING: We're talking about it all day because we've got the man who's playing the legend here. That is award-winning actor Kingsley Ben-Adir is in the House. Welcome, Kingsley.
 
KINGSLEY BEN-ADIR, AWARD-WINNING ACTOR: Thank you.
 
KING: Also with us is music royalty, if we can call you that, the movie's producer and the eldest son of Bob and Rita Marley. That would be eight-time Grammy-winning artist, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, that's Ziggy Marley. Congrats on the movie.
 
Welcome. Welcome, guys. Welcome.
 
ZIGGY MARLEY, PRODUCER, BOB MARLEY, ONE LOVE: Thank you. Thank you. It's good to be here. KING: I want to start with you Ziggy because of course we all know the music but I think most people don't know a lot about the man, myself included. So, we're learning things in this movie that most people -- I've heard even people close to him didn't know. What was the story you wanted people to know about your dad?
 
MARLEY: Yes. I think the thing that we wanted people to know was him as a human being, the emotional side of Bob, psychological side of Bob, not the exterior but the interior of Bab. There's a lot of books, a lot of videos.
 
KING: There's 500 books about him.
 
MARLEY: Yes. So, I mean --
 
KING: 500 -- yes. 500 books about him, yes.
 
MARLEY: So, we were trying to tell people something that they didn't know about Bob. We had to go to the inside of Bob to do that.
 
KING: And you didn't shy away too in the movie because it's fair to say your dad was complicated. There were all sorts of stories about him and the way he lived his life and anger, infidelity, many things. But you said the family was okay showing Bob Marley warts and all. True?
 
MARLEY: Yes, we weren't afraid of the truth. He wasn't afraid of the truth. He lived his life. He's an open book. He wasn't trying to hide anything of who he is and how he was. And so he had an edge to him.
 
KING: An edge?
 
MARLEY: Yes, his nickname is Tough Gong.
 
KING: Tough Gun?
 
MARLEY: Gong, Gong.
 
KING: Tough Gong?
 
MARLEY: Gong.
 
KING: Okay.
 
MARLEY: So, that's his -- he's from the ghetto. It means don't mess with him.
 
KING: Okay.
 
MARLEY: That's what it means. He had an edge to him. He grew up in the streets. So, that's a side (INAUDIBLE) we might not know (INAUDIBLE). He's peaceful, but he had an edge to him.
 
BARKLEY: Kingsle, I got a question for you. Plan -- how is it planned a real person, but how it twofold? How is it planned a real person, but also plan a legend? BEN-ADIR: I feel like with Bob, it was always the conversation from the beginning about his spirit, you know, the essence of him, and that Bob is really -- he's so big, you know, he's so magical in a way that you can't really play him. You can only try to attempt to capture a little bit of his spirit.
 
And when I say spirit, really, what I mean is vulnerability. And as an actor, whatever the part is, you know, whoever it is, it is Ken or Gravik or King Arthur or whatever, it's -- my training was always vulnerability first. So, what is it about any character that makes them human is the only thing that the audience are going to connect with in the end. So --
 
BARKLEY: Did you feel pressure?
 
BEN-AID: Of course, of course there's pressure, but, really, I chose to do it, you know? No one made me do it. I wanted to do it. And I remember watching Bob before I auditioned and being -- I mean, I was all-in. Like he's -- there's something so magnetic about him when he's on stage.
 
And then, and then I meet Ziggy and then we start talking about him as a father and as a man. And I'm going to get to learn about Bob with the people who knew him and loved him.
 
KING: But it makes it more extraordinary, though, what Kingsley did. Because you said you didn't sing, you didn't play the guitar, you didn't dance, all of which Bob Marley did. Did you smoke weed?
 <br>[22:30:11]
 
BEN-ADIR: No, I eat it sometimes. I had a smoke though.
 
KING: I mean, all of which Bob Marley did, you did none of those things you said --
 
BEN-ADIR: No.
 
KING: -- but yet you said --
 
BEN-ADIR: I'm not very good at football. 
 
KING: And you're not very good at football. But yet, so how did you learn to speak the way you spoke, the patois, to play the guitar, what did it take for you to learn to do that? 
 
BEN-ADIR: Just a lot of phone calls and you know, we just had to get to work. I got a guitar as soon as I rapped on "Secret Invasion". 
 
KING: Because you were on Barbie, yeah. 
 
BEN-ADIR: Yeah, and I know I just started learning chords and listening to Bob and I started a conversation very quickly with the family and Bob's friends, you know. So, I was just absorbing information from them. I was just saying, normally when you have a character, it's your character and you create it and you're on your own. 
 
And then you come in and you -- but with this, it wasn't like that. It was really, I needed the support and the love of everyone around, you know, everyone in the family and --
 
KING: And you felt you had that from the family. 
 
BEN-ADIR: Yeah, 100 percent. 
 
CHARLES BARKLEY, CNN HOST: Ziggy, I got a question for you. Like, we talk about, we were like, on the NBA last week, we were celebrating Dr. King, who's more famous, passed away than he's alive. 
 
Your dad is probably in the same boat. Have you ever been surprised, because when we do this little thing outside where we interview people, there was people who couldn't have been born when your dad passed away. We ask them, what's their favorite Bob Marley song and they start singing it. 
 
KING: They had one, yeah. 
 
BARKLEY: And like, so living with having a father who's a living legend, because he's your dad. 
 
MARLEY: Yeah. 
 
BARKLEY: How -- are you surprised or just feel gratitude that he's more famous in death than life? 
 
MARLEY: Gratitude. And I think one of the reasons whites like that with him is because of who he is as a human being. People connect with him, probably like Martin Luther King, Jr. to like them, connect with him on a different level that is not just like this superstar up there. It's like he's one of us. 
 
So, they have that strong feeling towards him because of all of the footage they've seen, how he speaks and how they perceive him to be as a person. So, the connection is very strong with anybody who explores my father's music. It's like them feel something about him special, you know? 
 
KING: Yeah, what's your best memory about him? Because we see you a lot in the movie, Ziggy. There's a wonderful scene of you in the car with your dad. You're a little boy. 
 
MARLEY: Yeah. 
 
KING: What's your favorite memory about him? 
 
MARLEY: Favorite. It's hard to have a favorite memory. You know, he was so young when he passed away. 
 
KING: Yeah, he was only 36. 
 
MARLEY: Yeah, so it's like --
 
KING: With cancer. 
 
MARLEY: Everything. When I look back, all of my memories are special moments. Whether it be playing football, soccer, Charles, yeah? Not football. 
 
KING: That's good. 
 
MARLEY: You know, one of the most memorable things we did with him, we took trips with him. We went to Zimbabwe, him and my brother, Stephen, we went to Zimbabwe to celebrate the independence from British rule. And during that trip, was first time in Africa. 
 
We were in the hotel room and the guys that were fighting for freedom came to visit him and they brought like the grenades and they brought the guns and they were showing him and they were telling him how his music helped them, motivate them to fight against the colonial powers. And as a kid, that kind of made an impression on me of how music can be so powerful, you know. 
 
KING: A music can be healing and music can transform. 
 
MARLEY: Yeah.
 
KING: And that's what he did. Don't go anywhere guys, because we have a lot more on Bob Marley. The movie, it's called "One Love" and the enduring impact, even today on fans everywhere, we talked to a few of them right before the show today. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KING: Do you have a favorite Bob Marley song?
 
UNKNOWN: Sun Is Shining? 
 
UNKNOWN: Waiting in Vain and Stir It Up. 
 
KING: Let's hear a little bit. 
 
UNKNOWN: My name is Sade, but I'm no singer like Sade. 
 
KING: Let's hear it Pam. 
 
PAM: No, no, I'm not going to sing. 
 
UNKNOWN: One love. One heart. But I didn't shoot the deputy. One heart. I don't care. Let's get together and feel all right.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[22:39:13]
 
(BOB MARLEY MUSIC PLAYING)
 
KING: So good. That is the real Bob Marley with his classic, "Is This Love". We're here now with Jamaican reggae star, that's Ziggy Marley, who is a producer on the new film "Bob Marley, One Love". He also is Bob and Rita's eldest son, and actor Kingsley Ben-Adir, who plays Bob Marley in the movie that is out right now. 
 
How did you know, listening to Kingsley who said he didn't play the guitar, he didn't sing, he didn't dance, how did you think that he could play your dad? And he's taller than your dad, too. 
 
MARLEY: He was -- Bob was a giant. 
 
KING: A giant, yeah.
 
MARLEY: I was okay with Kingsley being tall because to us, Bob is like, you know, really big. But what it was with Kingsley when we saw the audition tape, and we did look everywhere. I mean, obviously our first inkling was, let's find a Jamaican, let's find someone who knows the dialect, let's find somebody who knows exactly the culture and everything. 
 
KING: And there was some backlash, wasn't there, because he was British and people thought a Jamaican person should have played? 
 <br>[22:40:00]
 
MARLEY: Yeah, we thought so, too. 
 
KING: Yeah, but Charles, what was your answer to that? Yeah, what was your answer to that? Yeah, Charles, you had a --
 
BARKLEY: No, we were talking about it earlier. I said, if the family happy, we're to tell everybody that to shut the hell up. 
 
MARLEY: No, we were happy with it. What Kingsley did was he brought us into the emotion, which that's, I mean, without that, if you could look like Bob, talk like Bob, sing like Bob, if you don't bring us into the emotion, then it don't --
 
KING: What do you have? 
 
MARLEY: Yeah, it doesn't make any sense. And the fact that we accepted Kingsley and we premiered it in Jamaica. And the Jamaican people accepted Kingsley. 
 
KING: There you go. 
 
MARLEY: And I'm good, you know? 
 
KING: Yeah. 
 
BARKLEY: You know, you just glossed over like, yeah, I just learned to play the guitar. Like, I don't think it's that simple. You know, like how much time and effort, I mean, I don't think anybody, no disrespect to anybody, you can just like, hey, you know what? I think I'm going to learn to play the guitar. 
 
BEN-ADIR: It's just the hours and I thought I might as well start. And so I just, a lot of Bob's songs, you know, they're similar chords. So, the basics I just was teaching myself. And I just thought I might as well keep going with it. And then by the time we got to the scene in the room, I'm still not, I'm not perfect on it. 
 
But if there's a way where like Ziggy's in the -- Ziggy was in the room when we were doing that scene. And I remember him sort of musically directing me because I wanted to know what it means to create music and to wake up in the morning and what you do is you pick up a guitar and you create songs. Like that's what Bob did. That's how he lived his life, creating music. 
 
It's kind of like if I was playing a footballer and not kicking a ball, you know? And it was the same with the singing. I was like, I'm not going to sound, I don't need to put the pressure on myself to sound good, but Bob's singing from such an emotional place. 
 
When you watch Bob's face when he's singing, the magnetism that I experience is coming from a deep, deep well of emotion and trauma. And when it comes together, it's something really powerful. 
 
And I feel like that's the vibration of his music and his spirit and his person as well, because who he was as a person was so much to do with his commitment. Bob --he committed his life to music and he became a master at it --
 
KING: Yes. Right. 
 
BEN-ADIR: --at a young age, and there's not many people who can do that. So I really wanted to just feel what that was. And then I remember in that acoustic scene, Ziggy just saying, less, less, more, telling me what to do with my hands, less, more. And I was just following the instructions because you can't really learn to play like Bob or sing like Bob in 10 years. 
 
KING: I know, but you're on the set of "Barbie" because you were one of the Kens. You're on the set of "Barbie", so, break, you'd go and try to strum the guitar and then go back. 
 
MARLEY: I kept the guitar --
 
KING: Because it's two different things. 
 
BEN-ADIR: Strum the guitar and do Ken. 
 
KING: Yes, yes, at the same time. 
 
BEN-ADIR: A little bit, but I figured out Ken pretty quickly. 
 
KING: Yeah. Yeah.
 
BEN-ADIR: There's something simple about him. 
 
KING: Yeah, Bob took a minute to get. 
 
MARLEY: Probably needed a bit more space.
 
KING: You know, when you was talking about your dad's commitment to music, he also had such a commitment to peace, and his desire for peace almost took his life, because there were rival gangs in Jamaica. He said, let's have a concert, bring everybody together. There was an assassination attempt on his life, so we all almost lost him. Do you remember that night? 
 
MARLEY: Yeah, I remember that night. I wasn't there at the rehearsals. I wanted to go, but my mother was very strict about school and education. So she was like, you have school tomorrow, you can't go to rehearsals. So, but in the middle of the night, the police came for us at home and kind of, you know, hurried us up and took us away. And I was kind of like, we didn't know what was going on. 
 
KING: Why did they take you away? Because they weren't sure what was happening. 
 
MARLEY: I guess so. I mean, somebody sent them for us. Maybe it was from the government. Somebody sent them for us, get the kids, and take them to safety, just in case, because we don't know what's going to happen. And I remember seeing my father the next morning, and then my mother came up, and we were like, something, you know, something bad happened. You know, we were realized that something not right, you know? Yeah. 
 
KING: Go ahead, Charles. I just, you know, I was telling Kingsley, like, first of all, I hate fan boy over him. I said, I saw you, watched you in this movie a few years ago, "King Arthur: Legend of the Sword", because I was a big Charlie Hunan fan. And I said, this brother here, man, I like him. 
 
So, I just want to tell you, man, I'm proud of your success and keep doing your thing. And I tell you, man, for the family to have so much confidence in you, because number one, I know acting is hard. I've never done any real acting. But to be able to pull off a legend, man, it's pretty special, so continued success. 
 
BEN-ADIR: Thank you. 
 
KING: Yes. I want to know from you, before we say goodbye, did you learn anything about your dad that you didn't know in the course of producing the movie, looking at all the footage, talking to Kingsley about what you wanted to portray? 
 <br>[22:45:00]
 
Did you learn something about him? 
 
MARLEY: Yeah, it made me think about something. I'm not sure about learning but it made me think about -- and probably it is a part of learning. It made me really think about what my father went through emotionally during this time period, psychologically. I never thought about it before. 
 
Kingsley played him, because Kingsley played him with deep emotion and deep like thoughtfulness. It was like the happy -- the stereotypical Bob Marley. It was like a more solemn father who went through something heavy. 
 
KING: Yeah. MARLEY: I mean, he --
 
KING: -- saw many sides of him. 
 
MARLEY: Yeah, he got almost killed. He got diagnosed with cancer. He had to leave his country and it was crazy, you know? 
 
BARKLEY: I got one last question. So, you all said there's been 500 books written about your dad. 
 
MARLEY: Yeah.
 
BARKLEY: And have you ever read any of them? 
 
MARLEY: Nope. 
 
KING: You haven't read any? 
 
MARLEY: Nope. I was like, no. Even the best seller, I don't know. I live with my experience. I love that. 
 
KING: Let's leave with a great line in the movie about what your dad said. 
 
MARLEY: Yeah.
 
KING: Would you share with us that? 
 
MARLEY: Yeah, sure. And this is -- this is why the movie was made in this time period, because in this time period he came to that realization that, and he says it that, "If my life is for me, I don't want it. My life is for people."
 
KING: There you go. That sums up Bob Marley, doesn't it? 
 
MARLEY: Yes, yes.
 
BARKLEY: Thank you. 
 
KING: Thank you, Kingsley. 
 
BEN-ADIR: Thanks so much.
 
KING: Congratulations. Did you know that it's Valentine's Day? Did you remember it's Valentine's Day? Kingsley? 
 
BARKLEY: They can tell by your outfit. 
 
KING: Charles and I have a surprise when we come back. King Charles continues right after the break.

 <br>[22:51:34]
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BARKLEY: America, happy Valentine's Day! 
 
KING: Do you think Valentine's Day is overrated? 
 
UNKNOWN: No. It's a fun holiday. 
 
KING: What if you're not in a relationship? 
 
UNKNOWN: You can celebrate yourself. 
 
BARKLEY: It's just a female holiday, correct? 
 
UNKNOWN: Seems to be that way.
 
KING: Do you think it's for men and women? 
 
UNKNOWN: I feel like it's for everybody. 
 
UNKNOWN: Why would it just be for women? 
 
BARKLEY: What percentage of women do you think get a man something? 
 
UNKNOWN: Oh, maybe like 50 percent. 
 
BARKLEY: Oh my goodness. 
 
UNKNOWN: I'd say 40, yeah? Do you think it's that high? I'd say 20. It feels more like a holiday for women. 
 
KING: Do you get Valentine's Day gifts yourself? 
 
UNKNOWN: I mean, I hope so. 
 
KING: Do you buy something for the men in your lives? 
 
UNKNOWN: Yes. 
 
BARKLEY: Oh, you do? 
 
UNKNOWN: I do. Dunkin Donuts and skip the cards. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
KING: Yeah, that was you. Yeah. So, we were talking earlier about, is Valentine's Day for men or women? And you said, how many women give gifts to men for Valentine's Day? 
 
BARKLEY: Twenty percent.
 
KING: Twenty percent?
 
BARKLEY: At the most. So, we were taking a poll, people said 50 percent, people think 60 percent. And you agree with me. 
 
KING: I do, I do. I don't think that most women give men gifts on Valentine's Day. And they shouldn't. KING: They shouldn't? 
 
BARKLEY: No, it's a female holiday. 
 
KING: Do you really think that? 
 
BARKLEY: I really do. And there's nothing wrong with that. 
 
KING: Yeah, yeah.
 
BARKLEY: We just got to come up with a day for the men. 
 
KING: Well, you know, I want America to know that Charles Barkley came in and brought gifts for every woman on the staff. He came and you want to tell people what you got us? I got you a facial and a body scrub, whatever the hell that is. 
 
KING: But we all thought that for all the women on the staff we walked in, Charles is handing out cards to everybody. I thought that was really nice. So I thought, Charles, I got something for you. 
 
BARKLEY: I'm going to try to get you all young, expensive. 
 
KING: I got something for you. Please, can we get a tight shot of the wrapping paper? 
 
BARKLEY: You got your face on it?
 
KING: Okay. 
 
BARKLEY: I'm going to feel -- I'm going to feel bad tearing her face. 
 
KING: No, I have to explain this because Charles told us guys in a meeting that he travels with his -- keep opening it. Open it, dear. 
 
BARKLEY: I hate ripping up your face. 
 
KING: He travels with his own -- he travels with his own bar of soap. 
 
BARKLEY: I do. 
 
KING: In a plastic bag. Charles Barkley -- in a Ziploc bag. So, this is who I got you. This is a soap carrier. 
 
BARKLEY: Oh my goodness. Yellow in my favorite color. Isn't it nice? Well, pull it out so people can see. And it says -- and then I got him something else. It says, you are fabulous, you are glorious, you are fierce. Notice it's the little hearts with my face.
 
BARKLEY: Who got their own damn watch? 
 
KING: I do, I do. 
 
BARKLEY: You must be rich, Gayle. 
 
KING: And I thought you would get a kick out of this. BARKLEY: I would do get a kick out of it. 
 
KING: And I would like you to put it in a prominent place in your home.
 
BARKLEY: It's going to be in a permanent place. 
 
KING: It's a shot of me and Shaq at the Super Bowl. 
 
BARKLEY: Oh.
 
BARKLEY: Isn't that nice? It's a shot of me and Shaq. 
 
KING: I'm going to put this in a permanent place. I promise you all. I'm going to put this in a permanent place. It's going to have a shower in the room, a counter and a toilet. 
 
KING: In a toilet, I knew you were going to say that. But Charles --
 
BARKLEY: You think I want to see this every morning? 
 
KING: Yes, I do, actually. 
 
BARKLEY: That makes you not you. I mean you, not you.
 
KING: I think you want to see both of us. 
 
BARKLEY: Okay, no I don't. 
 
KING: But Charles, I have to say, we were planning a different show for today, but because of the shooting in Kansas City, we had to pivot and talk about something else, because I really wanted to talk about the Super Bowl, really wanted to talk about Usher's halftime show. 
 
BARKLEY: It was great. 
 
KING: He was fantastic. Talk about Travis and Coach Reid. 
 <br>[22:55:00]
 
There was lots to discuss. But one thing I did want to talk about, you said, when we're in the Super Bowl, we were going to get together for dinner on Saturday night. You said, I'm going to call you, we're going to get together. 
 
BARKLEY: No, I said, I said, call me. I said, call me. 
 
KING: No, no.
 
BARKLEY: I said, call me. 
 
KING: If Charles Barkley called you, he called me. You said, I'm going to call you, we're going to go out to dinner Saturday. I'm still waiting. That'll do it for us on King Charles. This man doesn't keep his word. He doesn't keep his word. 
 
BARKLEY: Gayle, I'm like, call me because you're the one working. 
 
KING: No you didn't. 
 
BARKLEY: I was there for fun. 
 
KING: No you didn't. You said I'm going to call you. We're going to go out to dinner. I'm still waiting. We'll be back every Wednesday at 10 o'clock. 
 
BARKLEY: Hey, and Gayle will be up first thing in the morning. And let me tell you something, I get up every morning to watch her. Man, she gets up early. 
 
KING: We will see you next week. Take it easy. No, Charles, you said, I'm going to call you and we're going to go Saturday -- you said that. 
 
BARKLEY: Yeah, you didn't call me. 
 
KING: Well, I didn't want to call you and say, are we going out to dinner? I didn't want to do that. 
 
BARKLEY: You should have called me. I didn't do anything Saturday night.
