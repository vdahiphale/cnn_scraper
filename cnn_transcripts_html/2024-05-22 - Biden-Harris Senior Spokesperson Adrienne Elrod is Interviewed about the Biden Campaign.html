UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What's next for America? 
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Is this on his official account? Wow. A unified Reich? That's Hitler's language. That's not America's. 
 
He cares about holding on to power. I care about you.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KASIE HUNT, CNN ANCHOR: President Biden hammering former President Trump for amplifying language evoking Adolf Hitler's rule in a since- deleted video that he shared referencing the creation of a unified Reich. Biden telling donors at a fundraiser on Tuesday, quote, "That's not the language of American presidents. We've got some lame excuses that a staffer did it. We already know that Trump personally controls his social media account because he brags so much about control. It's not the first time Trump has gone down this road."
 
Joining me now is senior spokesperson for the Biden-Harris campaign, Adrienne Elrod.
 
Adrian, good morning. It's wonderful to have you on the show.
 
ADRIENNE ELROD, SENIOR SPOKESPERSON, BIDEN-HARRIS 2024 CAMPAIGN: You too. Thanks, Kasie.
 
HUNT: So, the question at hand here, and obviously we saw the video that the campaign - you all at the campaign put together on this. 
 
I want to bring up this piece that David Graham wrote in "The Atlantic" to respond to this video. He says, quote, "Trump's critics debate whether it's more effective to attack Trump as a threat to democracy, criticizes his unpopular policy ideas, paint him as corrupt or focus on Biden's positive accomplishments. The bizarre thing is that many voters may hear about the controversy and it assumes that it reveals Trump's sympathy for the Third Reich and then vote for him anyway."
 
We have seen a lot of willingness from voters to hear these kinds of things that Donald Trump says or alludes to and then seem to not really care about it and vote for him anyway. How do you, as a campaign, overcome that? 
 
ELROD: Well, Kasie, it's our job as a campaign to make sure that the American people and voters do take it seriously. They do realize that not only would a Trump second term mean that we are living under an authoritarian regime in some respects because he's literally told us that's what he's going to do. He, of course, Kasie, as you noted, he's made it very clear that he wants to rule as a dictator on day one. He literally put that on Truth Social. 
 
You know, he has sympathized with authoritarian leaders. He has admired dictators from across the world. This is a pattern of behavior that is incredibly disturbing. And I think the American people, when they really start to realize, this is not Trump just, you know, saying things for the sake of saying things. This is really Trump saying how he is going to lead our country in a second term if he gets back into the White House. 
 
So, President Biden, of course, the contrast could not be more clear. We wanted to make sure that the American people understood what's at stake. We put out a video yesterday. Very simply, President Biden, is his own words, saying this is Nazi Germany language that Trump is lifting up. I am fighting for you, the American people. Trump is fighting to lean into dictators and to be an authoritarian. 
 
The contrast could not be more clear. And, by the way, Kasie, the more Donald Trump uses this divisive rhetoric, the more we're going to make sure that everyone in America understands what's at stake and the type of ruler that he would be if he got back into the White House.  
 
HUNT: So, Adrienne, I'm going to remind everyone what Donald Trump said back about what happened in Charlottesville when there are - there were neo-Nazi groups who gathered, among others. And, of course, resulted in one very tragic death. Here's what Donald Trump had to say about it in the immediate aftermath. 
 
Watch.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They showed up in Charlottesville.
 
DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Excuse me.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: To protest the (INAUDIBLE) -
 
TRUMP: Excuse me. They didn't put themselves down as neo-Nazis. And you had some very bad people in that group. But you also had people that were very fine people, on both sides. (END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT: He said, "Very fine people on both sides." And that has been cited as one of President Biden's personal motivations for wanting to run for president against Donald Trump in the first place back in 2020.
 
But, of course, there have been - there has been, in the wake of that, some tension behind the scenes among Democrats about what is the most effective way for Democrats to run against Donald Trump. And I'm just interested to know kind of what your latest data and thinking is as a campaign around the distinction between running on it - I mean what the House - former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will say are, you know, the kitchen table issues, inflation, the economy, as compared to democracy. 
 <br>[06:35:06]
 
And clearly, that's something that very much personally animates the president.
 
What's your view as to whether that is the most effective message for voters this fall? 
 
ELROD: Well, Kasie, I think it's all of the above. I mean, look, our job on the campaign is to make it clear to the American people that this election is about a choice. It's a choice between two candidates. President Biden is somebody who has a consistent record of fighting for the American people. I mean we could sit here and tick off a list of his accomplishments that he achieved in the first three-and-a-half years of his - of office. You know, low unemployment, you know, record job creation, over 15 million jobs, four major economic bills. We could go on and on. 
 
But what matters, of course, in this election, Kasie, is what President Biden will do in a second term, making sure that he's implementing that agenda, versus Donald Trump, who simply want us to seek political retribution on his enemies, who simply wants to make sure that he can gain as much power as possible by ruling like an authoritarian. Again, we've talked about how he has leaned into dictators. He has said that there will be a bloodbath if President Biden wins reelection and Donald Trump loses. The election cannot be more clear. 
 
So, now not only are we running on President Biden's strong record for the American people, but we are running at contrast campaign to make it clear that not only would a Donald Trump second term be very dangerous to the American people, but it would be even worse than his first term because, you know, he's not going to listen to, you know, some of the folks that he brought in, in the first term, he's going to bring people in who seek to implement his agenda, which is dangerous and which is divisive, which is to seek political retribution, which is not to fight for the American people, which is why Joe Biden made that very clear in the video, I care about you. You know, he cares about lifting up divisive language.
 
HUNT: Sure. 
 
Adrienne, before I let you go, I want to ask you about "The New York Times" report that Justice Samuel Alito, outside of his home, there was an upside-down American flag flying, a signal of the stop the steal movement in the wake of January 6th. Do you - does the Biden campaign believed that Justice Alito, in light of this, should recuse himself from the January 6th related cases?
 
ELROD: Yes, I don't think that's really for us to comment on, but what I will tell you, Kasie, is that President Biden believes the American flag is sacred. And let's just remember, when Donald Trump had the chance to appoint three Supreme Court justices under his first term, he appointed justices who made it very clear where they stand on women's reproductive health. They were responsible for overturning Roe v. Wade. President Biden was able to put one Supreme Court justice on, Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first black woman on the Supreme Court, who's been a very progressive voice for the American people on that court.
 
HUNT: All right.
 
ELROD: So, again, the contrast could not be more clear.
 
HUNT: All right, Adrienne Elrod for us this morning, Biden campaign spokeswoman. Always grateful to have you, Adrienne. Come back soon.
 
ELROD: Thanks, Kasie.
 
HUNT: All right, the reaction to this - the flag that Alito flew I want to dig into a little bit because we have actually seen some criticism from Republicans. It's been mixed overall, but still interesting. 
 
Watch.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Was that appropriate for the justice to do that, and should he recuse himself in any cases related to the election?
 
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): It seems to me there are just nonstop attacks on the Supreme Court, week after week after week. And so I'm not going to dignify that with a response. 
 
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): I don't know what happened in the neighborhood. I don't think he should be recused. But I don't think this - you know, this creates a bad - a bad image.
 
And, I mean, I don't know what happened, you know. All I can say is, it created a situation that we're all talking about. So, yes, I think it was a mistake.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT: So, he says he thinks it was a mistake. And, Molly Ball, I mean earlier in the week Graham, off camera, had said this about Alito. Quote, "it's not good judgment to do that. He said his wife was insulted and got mad. I assume that to be true. But you are still a Supreme Court justice. People have to realize that moments like that, to think it through." 
 
I was a little surprised to hear Lindsey Graham making this argument, but he kind of says what seems obvious I think to all of us. Like, you're a Supreme Court justice. There are different standards for you as a Supreme Court justice than there are for the rest of us. 
 
MOLLY BALL, SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL": And this is a public presentation, right? This is you making a political display outside your home. This isn't some, like, private comment that happened to be overhead but was not meant for anyone to see. And I think, you know, we're living in a time when the legitimacy of the court has been called into question when a lot of Americans have lost confidence in the court and when the court is making these, you know, highly charged, ideological decisions. 
 <br>[06:40:02]
 
And when the court is going to do that, they need that confidence more than ever. They need people to trust that the court is making decisions based on the law and not based on partisanship when they're - if you're going to do something like overturn Roe v. Wade, which is a very unpopular decision that has caused - that we - that I think has been tied to the plummeting approval ratings for the court because so many Americans just do not feel that they can trust the court to be fair and impartial. So, I think this just further erodes the credibility, in addition to all the scandals that we've seen recently. 
 
HUNT: Yes. There's also some reports that apparently, at least according to CNBC, Matt, Alito, sold shares in Budweiser and then bought Coors. 
 
MATT GORMAN, FORMER SENIOR ADVISER, TIM SCOTT'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: Yes, I think that was a - look, I'll take a step back. I think that was kind of a dumb, far-left opposition research hit.
 
HUNT: OK.
 
GORMAN: Because, like, let's be honest, if you're - if you're - if your company that you're invested in is in the middle of a boycott, a national boycott, the stock price is tanking, Anheuser-Busch, it makes sense to sell it and get another one. I think just pure - I'm not - I'm not a financial analyst here. So, I think that's a little different. 
 
Look, I will say this, kind of step back a little bit. I think in so many ways, whether it's the court, you look at the House or Congress, you know, the question I always ask ourselves is, has the court or Congress gotten more polarized or have we? And are we a reflection, right? Like, we are folks, were the ones sending these folks down. We are the ones reacting to it. And I think in a lot of ways, so much of this now is a reflection of who we are as a society, as well as kind of the external force.
 
HUNT: Yes, or at least those among us who are wanting to and fully participate in our system, right? It's - it's - the people who are most motivated right now to play a significant part in our system often are the people on the edges, not a wide swath of people in the middle, many of whom are turned off entirely from our politics. 
 
All right, coming up next here, passengers recall the terrifying moments of deadly turbulence aboard a Singapore airplane - airlines flight.
 
Plus, Hunter Biden heads to court. Why his attorneys are asking for more time to respond to his tax evasion charges.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[06:46:18]
 
HUNT: Welcome back. 
 
Passengers are still recovering from some terrifying moments aboard a Singapore Airlines flight that encountered severe turbulence ten hours into its route from London to Singapore. One man died and more than 70 were injured, ix of them critically.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDREW DAVIES, SINGAPORE AIRLINES PASSENGER: There was some screaming and it was when I - it was actually - I realize the gravity of it when I looked over my shoulder and saw the - you know, the people sitting behind me with a lady who had a big gash in her head and blood pouring down her face.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT: Yikes.
 
CNN aviation correspondent Pete Muntean joins our panel now.
 
Pete, good morning. Wonderful to have you. 
 
PETE MUNTEAN, CNN AVIATION CORRESPONDENT: Good morning. Thanks. 
 
HUNT: This is obviously a very sad story, but I think we all look at it and think, oh my God, how can something like this happen? I mean, you're a pilot. There seemed to be some questions about the plane now. What do you think caused this? What do we know about what caused this? 
 
MUNTEAN: It does seem like these turbulence incidents keep happening over and over again. And I report on them all the time. This one has to be one of the more severe -
 
HUNT: Yes.
 
MUNTEAN: Because so rarely do they end in a fatality. It is, though, the top cause of injuries on commercial flights in the U.S. and beyond. We've not seen a fatality because of turbulence since about 2021 on a commercial airliner worldwide.
 
But turbulence is a really insidious problem. And the hard thing is that it's invisible. A lot of times a pilot cannot be able to see when it's going to come on. There are a few different causes. Can be things like wind shear, so two different layers of wind moving at different speeds, maybe some - some shear off of a mountain or some terrain nearby. 
 
But then there's also the issue of thunderstorms. And that is what investigators are really looking to in a big way here because our data, and data from those who look at meteorology around the world, is that this flight was flying in Myanmar. 
 
It's the start of the monsoon season there. The weather really changes very rapidly. And this was in an area where there were some rapidly developing thunderstorms, which have a lot of up and down drafts. It's before the thunderstorm develops. And so that cannot be seen on radar, not only on the ground, but also in the airplane. 
 
And so the flight crew could have found themselves in a situation where these thunderstorms were developing with these big changing currents of air and not be able to avoid it in a way that's really rapid to get out of it. 
 
The good news here is that airlines have really sort of changed their procedures and they know that this is such a big issue. And so airlines are really forcing their flight crews to really make it so that they have - are spring loaded to deal with turbulence. 
 
HUNT: Yes, I mean, I think I think that I - that suck out to me, and, you know, I think we've all been guilty of ignoring a fasten seat belt sign. 
 
MUNTEAN: Yes.
 
HUNT: I don't know about you guys, but -
 
GORMAN: Never. I never do that.
 
HUNT: Never? You never do that?
 
MUNTEAN: I also never ever.
 
GORMAN: Never.
 
MUNTEAN: I'm being series in that. I never -
 
GORMAN: OK.
 
MUNTEAN: Because it - really because I - 
 
HUNT: Because Pete is the smartest one here.
 
MUNTEAN: Because I cover this all the time.
 
HUNT: Yes. MUNTEAN: And so, you know, I always have my seat belt on. You know, I think people are really sort of pressured into this feeling like, oh, I have to go to the bathroom. I have to get up. I try to go pee before I get on the plane. I mean that sort of helps too. Like, you're not sort of like caught in that position. I know that sounds weird, but it is - you know, you have to think of the physiological effect that's there. 
 
HUNT: No, it's - honestly that's good advice. You know, but, I mean, a 10 hour flight, it's a little tough - it's tough.
 
MUNTEAN: Yes, and so - it's totally tricky. I mean I want to know all the circumstances here. I want to know if this was happening as the cabin crew was doling out food or drinks, and that is a big issue.
 
HUNT: So, we have - we have reported they were in the middle of meal service when this happened.
 
MUNTEAN: Yes.
 
HUNT: That it - that the seat belt sign did come on, but it sounds like it was very close to when the turbulence actually hit.
 
MUNTEAN: And it's so hard for the crew to really know when it's going to come on. But the big thing is that airlines have now sort of spring loaded their crews to be like, they'll come over the PA and say, flight attendants take your jump seats. And that is the signal that you should not be messing around. You should get buckled in. You've seen the jump seats on board these commercial flights where these flight attendants can buckle in very quickly. That is the sign that something is coming very quickly because flight attendants and flight crews get injured all the time. 
 <br>[06:50:05]
 
I've heard of flight crews breaking ribs, of hurting their Achilles tendon. I mean it can be very serious.
 
HUNT: Yes.
 
MUNTEAN: And so, you know, especially if you're standing up and going through these gravitational forces of turbulence where you're experiencing some g's, you could get thrown up to the ceiling in some extreme events. And we have seen in the images here -
 
HUNT: Yes.
 
MUNTEAN: I want to know whether or not things hit the ceiling. If a cabin cart hit the ceiling. I mean the ceiling panels are all blown out.
 
HUNT: We've had some of these passengers say they saw other passengers hit the ceiling.
 
MUNTEAN: Right. Right. HUNT: I mean it's just stunning.
 
ELLIOT WILLIAMS, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: No, I - and the - this may be a painfully basic question, but do we know whether the fatality was from impact in some way or was it somebody having a heart attack.
 
MUNTEAN: There's a bit of conjecture. 
 
WILLIAMS: Yes.
 
MUNTEAN: I mean the - the hospital there in Bangkok says that this person may have had a heart condition prior. 
 
WILLIAMS: Right.
 
MUNTEAN: Now, that is one source. And so it - there clearly needs to be an autopsy to see what exactly took place here. But it's not unheard of that somebody could break their neck and get really severely injured and die directly from turbulence. So, regardless of whether or not this person had some sort of preexisting condition -
 
WILLIAMS: Right.
 
MUNTEAN: It is a really serious thing. And it's so - it shows how quickly things can turn on a commercial flight and why you should always have your seat belt on.
 
HUNT: Yes.
 
All right. Well, you didn't hear it here - you didn't hear it first here, but you did hear it here from our Pete Muntean, wear your seatbelt in your airplane seat.
 
MUNTEAN: Anytime.
 
GORMAN: Yes.
 
HUNT: For your own safety.
 
Pete, thank you. Very grateful to have you. 
 
All right, 50 minutes past the hour. Here's your morning roundup. 
 
Hunter Biden expected in court today for a hearing in his federal tax evasion case. The president's son has pleaded not guilty to nine counts. His attorney calling the charges nothing more than a political hit job.
 
A guilty plea from one of five Americans who allegedly brought ammunition into Turks and Caicos illegally. All of them face up to 12 years in prison and claim they carried the ammunition in their luggage inadvertently.
 
Los Angeles police opening a criminal investigation into the source of the ketamine that led to Matthew Perry's death. And two federal agencies are assisting. The "Friends" star was found floating facedown in his pool last October.
 
Today, a judge in Florida will hear motions to dismiss charges against Donald Trump and his co-defendants in the classified documents case after new photos showed defendant Walt Nauta moving boxes around Mar- a-Lago. Unsealed court documents revealed some of those classified documents were found in Trump's bedroom months after the FBI searched the resort.
 
Molly Ball, these are - these are new pictures of this allegedly - Walt Nauta, the personal aide to Donald Trump down at Mar-a-Lago, also charged in the case, as the judge has basically put this all off until after the election. I mean what is the significance of this? Also these new notes that these boxes - there were boxes found in Trump's bedroom. 
 
BALL: Well, I think it's a reminder that the crux of this case is not so much that Trump took the documents, although he wasn't supposed to do that, but that he refused to return them and went to great lengths to try to hide them and to obstruct the investigation, at least allegedly according to the - to the prosecution. And that's really what's at the heart of this case. It's not so much the, you know, the potentially inadvertent or potential, you know, misunderstanding of the laws around this stuff, it's that he didn't think the rules applied to him. He didn't think he should have to give it back despite what the law says. 
 
HUNT: And this has, of course, become the latest thing on the right, Elliot, because everyone has suddenly seemed to notice, and Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gosar, who are on the very far right of the House Republican conference, are talking about the fact that this FBI raid, of course, was authorized because Trump wouldn't give this stuff back, right? He was asked repeatedly to give it back before this raid occurs. 
 
But in this raid authorization, there's an authorization to use deadly force. And Trump has been also posting about this on his Truth Social page. Can you just kind of clear this up for us. Is that - people on the right are saying that this - some of them are going so far as to say this was an assassination attempt. My understanding is that this is pretty standard.
 
WILLIAMS: Yes.
 
HUNT: What's the deal? 
 
WILLIAMS: This is absolute nonsense. It is standard operating procedure to empower law enforcement to use deadly force, as we've seen in spectacular fashion over the last five years in many of these high-profile cases, law enforcement is empowered to use deadly force when executing a search warrant. I wouldn't even call it a raid. It's a standard procedure when officers are appearing at a home, and particularly FBI officers, to be prepared to use deadly force. You would find that in the case of and eviction. You would find that - if they're coming to evict someone from their home, they'd be empowered to use deadly force there. In the - like immigration enforcement, that would be the same. Now, that doesn't mean that they can break down a door and just start
 
 shooting at people. There would have to be a threat. And if someone were, at the time they entered Mar-a-Lago, to, you know, to have been wielding machetes or firearms, of course law enforcement would be empowered to use deadly force. 
 <br>[06:55:07]
 
And the idea that this is somehow an assassination attempt is nonsense. It's absolute nonsense. 
 
HUNT: All right, this is why we have you here.
 
WILLIAMS: Oh.
 
HUNT: Elliot, thank you.
 
All right, now this, Donald Trump is emphatic that he will not advocate for a ban on birth control if he wins in November. We should note, he is now emphatic because just hours earlier he - when he was asked if he supported restrictions on contraception he said this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you support any restrictions on a person's right to contraception?
 
DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We're looking at that. And I'm going to have a policy on that very shortly. And I think it's something that you'll find interesting.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, that suggests that you may want to support some restrictions, like the morning after pill or something?
 
TRUMP: Well, we - we are - we are also - you know, things really do have a lot to do with the states.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT: OK, the panel's back.
 
Matt, they seemed to try to clean this up quickly. The suggestion that he's confusing it with abortion pills. 
 
GORMAN: Yes.
 
HUNT: But, I mean, Democrats are going to use that. 
 
GORMAN: Oh, of course. You know, I will - I'll say this, right, take the name out of it, campaigns are kind of borne out in crises and how they react to these sorts of things. 
 
And look, I've been doing it for a while. How folks - how campaigns react to when their boss either is unclear, says the wrong thing, a whole litany of things, how they fix it is really important. And they did a pretty good job here because it seemed like he was talking about, as you said, Mifepristone, which is the abortion pill, which is - you know, there's some discrepancy by mail, the whole thing. Not actual, you know, contraception writ large.
 
But look, I think this is one of those things that it's - as much as we talk about Trump, the broader thing is fairly common, how campaigns need to clean this up, how they do it, how they do it quickly is really important. 
 
HUNT: Well, and this issue, Molly, I mean, this is something that as soon as Roe fell, Democrats were talking about this, that if this has falling, this means that they are going to come after contraception. The anchor was asking about the morning after pill, which many conservatives have actually made an issue around in trying to say that it is not - it does not fall into the category of contraception, that it's closer to abortion. But I think most Americans understand it as a contraceptive method that now they have access to.
 
Is there damage done here from this Trump clip, or, as Matt said, they just handle it and move on?
 
BALL: I think anything that reminds people about this issue of the ambiguities that you're talking about, the parts of - the powers of the federal government that Trump hasn't really gone into detail about how he would use them, you know, things like mail order abortion pills. 
 
There's the possibility that the Comstock Act, I believe, that the federal government could - could tighten that if he becomes president and there's - and there's a lot of unanswered questions about all of the different powers of the federal government that he could use to further restrict abortion that his - that his stance of saying we're going to leave it to the states doesn't fully answer. 
 
So I think, you know, he knows that this is a tough issue for him politically, a losing issue for him politically, and so he has sought to sort of triangulate it, find a middle path, reassure voters and that he doesn't want to further - further restrict things. But anytime he's talking about it I think it reminds people that this is part of - part of the agenda, part of what's on the ballot.
 
HUNT: All right, I wanted to kind of end on this. There was a peculiar moment outside Donald Trump's hush money trial on Tuesday. Here's Texas Congressman Troy Nehls. He is one of the Republicans who accompanied Trump to court.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. TROY NEHLS (R-TX): There's not another person on the planet that can do that other than the pope. The pope. And when do people go, they visit the pope, what do they say? Pope what can you do? Would you bless me and my family? That's what they want. They want blessings for their family when they go see the pope. When people come to Donald Trump's rallies, they're saying, Donald Trump, we need you more than ever before. Our country is burning.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT: Matt Gorman, Donald Trump equals the pope in Troy Nehls' view? 
 
GORMAN: I'll say this, the guy - the guy knows how to get on - clips on CNN and clips on cable news. It's a succinct quote that he says in front of the cameras, he goes to New York and says it. I think, as we said before, right, are we more - is Congress more polarized or are we, right? It's incentivized to go and give those sorts of quotes because he knows that he'll get coverage. 
 
HUNT: I mean, I guess he's kind of living it, right, Elie. I mean we've talked a lot about this, right, the idea that politicians will go to someone else's criminal trial and associate themselves with that when they, you know, they don't have to. They could say that they were busy doing other things. 
 
WILLIAMS: And he missed the layup here. No, the pope can't draw those kinds of crowds, but Beyonce and Taylor Swift can.
 
BALL: I was going to say - yes.
 
WILLIAMS: We saw this summer the Eras Tour drew a far bigger crowd, I thank, far bigger crowds nationwide than any Trump rally might have. I mean, come on, it's - you know, the Beatles said they were more popular than Jesus Christ, and I think that didn't go over that well either.
 <br>[07:00:05]
 
HUNT: It was a slightly more conservative time. 
 
WILLIAMS: Slightly more conservative time. But -
 
HUNT: Remember when their hair was like the wildest thing going on in our culture.
 
WILLIAMS: Their hair was the wildest thing.
 
HUNT: OK, that's where we are.
 
Thanks to all of you for joining us this morning and thanks to our panel for being here. I'm Kasie Hunt. Don't go anywhere. "CNN NEWS CENTRAL" starts right now.
