MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome back to CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Max Foster. If you're just joining us, here are today's top stories. 
 
The U.S. has proposed a U.N. Security Council draft resolution on Gaza, calling for a temporary ceasefire in Israel's war against Hamas. The U.S. has previously resisted calls for a ceasefire, emphasizing what it claims is Israel's right to defend itself.
 
Alexey Navalny's widow Yulia Navalnaya is vowing to expose Putin's regime, who she says is responsible for her husband's death, and she's encouraging Russians to stand with her in her fight. 
 
Ukraine's military says it's monitoring how Russian forces are preparing for their next moves after capturing the front-line town of Avdiivka in the east. And Nick Paton Walsh has more on Ukraine's withdrawal from the town and how the political standoff in Washington may have contributed to this loss. A warning that some images in this report are disturbing.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NICK PATON WALSH, CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): A sight not seen for a while, a Russian flag going up over Ukraine. But Ukraine's withdrawal announced on Saturday from Avdiivka means more than the loss of a town bitterly fought over since Russia first invaded a decade ago. It is perhaps the first sign a delay in U.S. aid spells death and loss here.
 
These images released of their last defenses rushing into support, under fire from a resurgent Russia who President Zelenskyy says sent seven Russian troops to die for every dead Ukrainian. This is what it was like in the basement, defending down to the last, treating the injured in the darkness, yet aware their options, their ammo, their chances were ebbing, shelling endless. It spoiled my drink, this soldier complains.
 
A commander clear Monday why this happened. 
 
We didn't have enough people, he says. We didn't have enough shells. We didn't have enough possibilities to throw them back. Russia's Ministry of Defense released images of their final onslaught
 
 on that coke plant and what they claimed were the casualties inflicted on Ukrainians as they tried to flee in the dark. Other images and reports emerged Monday in Ukraine of the fate of their wounded, one of whom called home in his last moments.
 
Allegations that, in the horrifying rubble here, both the wounded were left behind by Ukraine but also shot dead in cold blood by Russian forces. 
 
Russian drone images of their spoils released, again displaying their odd pride over the rubble. Zelenskyy may have to get used to more of this. Putting on a brave face as he visited troops in the likely next Russian target, Kupiansk, just outside Kharkiv.
 
Although there are different political sentiments in the world, he said, different flashes of problems that distract attention, we still, all together, do our utmost to have the world with us, with Ukraine. 
 
Words no longer enough, not in Avdiivka and certainly not in the West, where $60 billion in missing aid now means Putin can slowly edge further and further west.

FOSTER: Diplomatic tensions have escalated between Israel and Brazil over the ongoing war in Gaza. Brazil's foreign ministry recalled its ambassador to Israel on Monday and summoned the Israeli ambassador for a meeting in Rio de Janeiro. It comes hours after Israel declared Brazilian President Lula as persona non grata over his comments comparing Israel's operation in Gaza to the Holocaust.
 
Israel's foreign minister says Lula would not be welcome in the country until he apologizes and retracts his comments. A top Brazilian official has defended Lula's statement, saying there's nothing to apologize for. 
 
Russia's foreign minister is on a diplomatic swing through Latin America this week. Sergey Lavrov is set to visit Venezuela today, where he's expected to hold talks with President Nicolas Maduro in Caracas, as well as the Venezuelan foreign minister. 
 
As a presidential election looms in Venezuela, human rights activists accuse the Maduro regime of reverting to repressive policies against its people, including the detention of a high-profile activist. Stefano Pozzebon has that story.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 <br>[04:35:00]
 
STEFANO POZZEBON, JOURNALIST (voice-over): Yahara Cabrejo learned on social media that her son had been detained. In the video she saw, taken from the security cameras of a shop nearby, her son, Juan Freites, is manhandled into a car by two men and driven away. She hasn't seen him since.
 
YAHARA CABREJO, MOTHER OF JUAN FREITES (through translator): Today is 25 days that I don't know anything about him. Why was he detained? I don't know. What he's accused of, I don't know.
 
What I know is from the media, that he's supposedly involved in some conspiracy. But I have no idea what that is about. We're left in the dark.
 
POZZEBON (voice-over): Three days after the detention, Venezuela's attorney general confirmed that Freites had been arrested as part of an investigation into an alleged plot to kill President Nicolas Maduro.
 
Cabrejo and her lawyer deny Freites was involved in any plot. And so far, no proof has been presented by Venezuelan authorities.
 
Freites is a member of opposition party Vente Venezuela, and he and two other party members were detained in January.
 
The party leader, Maria Corina Machado, who's the frontrunner opposition candidate to challenge Maduro, has been barred by the supreme court from running in this year's presidential election.
 
In total, 19 people have been arrested, including Rocio San Miguel, a Spanish Venezuelan citizen and security analyst, who was picked up by the intelligence service as she was trying to leave the country. San Miguel is also accused of participating in a conspiracy. Again, without any evidence.
 
And when the U.N. human rights team protested her detention last week, Venezuela expelled the local staff.
 
The Venezuelan government claims to have uncovered several plots to murder Maduro and blames the U.S. and the U.N. of colonialism. Maduro himself vowed to unleash a campaign of Bolivarian fury against these opponents.
 
And someone wrote exactly those words, "Bolivarian fury" on the wall of Cabrejo's house shortly after her son's arrest.
 
The United States have threatened to re-impose oil sanctions in retaliation for Venezuela's authoritarian action. But less than six months ago, the two countries had reached an agreement that included free and fair elections in Venezuela this year.
 
JUANITA GOEBERTUS, HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH: Those of us who are democrats understand that that's how elections take place, and that you face elections knowing that you could potentially lose. But when you are an autocrat, there's -- there's huge existential threats in losing power.
 
POZZEBON (voice-over): Renewed tensions between Washington and Caracas could also have consequences in the U.S.
 
Venezuelans are one of the largest migrant groups at the U.S. Southern border, and activists fear migrations will continue as long as they don't feel safe in their home country.
 
Cabrejo has already seen a daughter leave her country to look for better opportunities. Now, her son behind bars, she pleads for justice, as well as safety.

FOSTER: As tensions mounts between Venezuela and the U.S., Russia's influence with Venezuelan government members has been growing.
 
Earlier, a senior adviser with the International Crisis Group told CNN why the two countries' closer ties could pose a threat to the West. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MARIANO DE ALBA, SENIOR ADVISOR, INTERNATIONAL CRISIS GROUP: It's been a really close relationship since many years ago. The relationship started when Hugo Chavez was president of Venezuela, but it has gained a lot of relevance in the past 10 years, I would say, as Venezuela has, you know, become very isolated from the West.
 
So I would say that in economic terms, Venezuela and Russia have a good economic relationship, but nothing major, especially in comparison to the West. But Russia has been really instrumental for Venezuela, as Venezuela has sought to basically circumvent U.S. sanctions, especially those related to the energy sector, where Russia is also very prevalent. 
 
At the same time, Russia sees the relationship as one of political relevance in the sense that it sees Venezuela as, you know, having a good relationship with Venezuela is a way of making a point to the U.S. of basically, you know, I am also very present to your neighborhood.
 
And at the same time, Venezuela has become really instrumental in multilateral firms like the United Nations, basically supporting all the lines and positions of Russia. 
 
So I think there's a balance here. There was the hope that with the U.S.-Venezuela agreement last year, Venezuela would basically diminish its relationship with Moscow.
 
However, that relationship is still very strong.
 <br>[04:40:00]
 
And I think that, you know, one of the points that the Venezuelan government will try to make as Lavrov visits Caracas today is basically saying or pointing out to the West, we have other options if our deal fails.

FOSTER: Protesters in support of Julian Assange currently gathering outside the U.K. High Court. Within the next hour, lawyers for the WikiLeaks founder are expected to start arguing his last appeal to avoid extradition back to the U.S. If the judges' rule against him, he'll have exhausted all appeals in the British system, starting the clock on his extradition process. He's facing charges of espionage and a possible sentence of up to 175 years in prison in the U.S. It's unclear whether he'll be attending today's hearing in person, though.
 
Police in Spain investigating the disappearance of an American woman who's been missing for more than two weeks. The 40-year-old from Florida was reported missing on February 2nd. Her brother told CNN she had planned to take a train from Madrid to Barcelona but never showed up at the train station. The superintendent at her Madrid apartment building says someone painted over the lenses of two security cameras around the time that she went missing. 
 
Now, still ahead, Alexey Navalny's widow accuses Russian authorities of hiding her husband's body and lying pathetically about his death. What's next for Yulia Navalnaya? 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: Alexey Navalny's widow is accusing Russian authorities of hiding her husband's body, trying to disguise his cause of death. She blames Vladimir Putin and says she'll soon find out exactly who killed Navalny and how they did it. CNN's Brian Todd reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): She's been through at all with him, from marching in the streets, getting arrested herself. To his final seconds of freedom three years ago, before he was taken into custody for the final time. But she has never been out front until now.
 <br>[04:45:02]
 
YULIA NAVALNAYA, ALEXEY NAVALNY'S WIDOW (through translator): By killing Alexey, Putin killed half of me, half of my heart and half of my soul. But I still have the other half. And it tells me that I have no right to give up. I will continue Alexey Navalny's cause.
 
TODD (voice-over): Forty-seven-year-old Yulia Navalnaya, Alexey Navalny's widow. Can she now effectively lead Russia's opposition?
 
JULIA IOFFE, FOUNDING PARTNER AND WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, PUCK: Now that he is gone, I think the only person who could potentially carry on his legacy is his wife.
 
TODD (voice-over): She has long avoided the spotlight, supporting her husband's campaigns but not leading rallies or making videos.
 
IOFFE: The fact that she has now affirmatively picked up the mantle is a remarkable turnaround from where she has stood for the last 15 years.
 
TODD (voice-over): In the days since his death, she has recorded the video address, made public appearances, and met with world leaders in Europe.
 
SUSAN GLASSER, CO-AUTHOR, "KREMLIN RISING": She was intimately involved in her husband's work. She was a very close partner with him. I think she understands what it was that Alexey Navalny did as well, if not better, than anyone.
 
TODD (voice-over): She certainly knows the dangers of the job. And during her husband being poisoned and almost killed in 2020, getting him flown out of the country for treatment, at his bedside during their 20th anniversary and flying back with him to Russia, knowing that he would surely face arrest or worse.
 
After police took him away in 2021, with the crowd chanting her name, she was defiant.
 
NAVALNAYA (through translator): I am not afraid, and I call on you to not be afraid.
 
TODD (voice-over): Shortly after that, at a court hearing, Alexey Navalny looked at his wife and drew the shape of a heart on the glass of the dock. When her husband died, she hadn't seen him in two years.
 
His last message to the world was this Valentine to her. Quote, I feel that you are with me every second.
 
Her first post after his death, "I love you."
 
But after years of living in Europe, would she dare go back to Putin's Russia?
 
ALEXEI LEVINSON, RUSSIAN POLLSTER, LEVADA CENTER (through translator): If she does this in Russia, she will have a high chance of ending up where her late husband ended up.
 
TODD (voice-over): Others say Putin could come after her, even if she stays abroad.
 
GLASSER: Look, I think if you are going to be a strong voice of opposition to the Kremlin right now, you have to consider yourself a target.
 
TODD: Yulia Navalnaya is already seemingly taking up some of her husband's calculations on how to pressure Vladimir Putin. According to "The Washington Post," she asked European leaders to sanction hundreds of Russian oligarchs who support Putin's reelection and to help prevent Russia's elites from evading sanctions.

FOSTER: Lionel Messi, still apologizing for sitting out the match in Hong Kong earlier this month. We'll tell you about his newest twist.
 <br>[04:50:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LIONEL MESSI, INTER MIAMI CF/ARGENTINE FOOTBALL STAR (through translator): As you all know, I always want to play and be involved in every game.
 
I've heard people say that I didn't want to play for political reasons and many other reasons that are totally untrue. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: Football legend Lionel Messi there once again explaining why he didn't play during a recent football match in Hong Kong. The video posted on Weibo was at the top of search rankings and received mostly positive feedback, actually, in China.
 
Earlier this month, Messi sat out the game between his club Inter Miami and a Hong Kong team, citing an injury, but his absence sparked immense backlash in Hong Kong and on the mainland because everyone wanted to see him play. 
 
At this very moment, at least one dead satellite is hurtling towards the Earth, but it's likely to burn up in the atmosphere. You'll be glad to hear.
 
As Bill Weir reports, it's just one of about 100 million pieces of space junk circling the globe. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): We all drop things around the house.
 
PIERS SELLERS, ASTRONAUT: Guys, I think my spatula has escaped.
 
WEIR: So when astronaut Piers Sellers dropped a spatula while spreading putty on the space shuttle it was relatable news.
 
SELLERS: I see it on there.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK. We'll take a look.
 
WEIR (voice-over): But while a spatula in space was still novel in 2006, it seems quaint now, because nearly 70 years after Sputnik the moon holds tons of human trash. And the final frontier is filthy with rocket fumes and orbiting junk.
 
Check out this NASA time-lapse. Each dot a manmade object bigger than a softball flying ten times faster than a bullet. The Website Orbiting now is tracking over 8,300 satellites, most of them put there by private companies like SpaceX. And over time, they will only add to the hundred million tiny pieces of manmade debris in orbit.
 
WEIR: So behind us is the National Air and Space Museum. Did they have an exhibit on space junk? Is it time we started paying attention? RON LOPEZ, PRESIDENT OF ASTROSCALE U.S.: There's been discussion about it and it is time that we pay attention to the issue.
 
WEIR (voice-over): Ron Lopez heads the American branch of Astroscale, a Japanese entry into the growing field of orbital debris removal.
 
LOPEZ: The interesting metric is that over the next ten years, were going to launch three times as much into space as we have launched since Sputnik, since the beginning of the space age. Three times as much in just the next ten years.
 
WEIR (voice-over): While they're a long way from flying garbage trucks. Astroscale just launched a second test mission and funded only by private investment recently proved that they can use magnets to catch and potentially extend the lives of dying satellites.
 <br>[04:55:00]
 
In 2018, a team from the U.K. proved that space junk can be snared with a net, which helps with traffic control up there, but does nothing to stop dead satellites from burning into countless pieces of metal, throwing off remnants that can stay in our skies for years.
 
WEIR: The launches are almost a weekly or daily occurrence. Is that having an effect on the stratosphere?
 
TROY THORNBERRY, RESEARCH PHYSICIST, NOAA CHEMICAL SCIENCES LABORATORY: Yes. So as we see this increase in space traffic, we see significantly increased initiatives. And something we've been talking about is adding a lot of material to the stratosphere that was never there before. 
 
All of the sort of the mass of material that we put into space doesn't all just stay there. And when it's deorbited, it basically acts in the same way that a meteoroid does.
 
WEIR (voice-over): With special high-flying jets, a team from NOAA recently discovered that 10 percent of the particles in the stratosphere contain bits of rocket and satellite metal. And in the next few decades, it could be 50 percent, matching the amount created naturally by meteorites. Scientists worry that this could eventually alter earth's climate.
 
So this summer, Japan and NASA aim to launch the world's first biodegradable satellite made mostly from wood.
 
WEIR: Last year, the U.S. Senate passed the Orbits Act unanimously. It's yet to go through the House. This would charge NASA with coming up with new technology to clean up the mess and puts the whole mess under the responsibility of the Commerce Department.
 
But of course, the U.S. is just one of many space going nation these days. And we got word this week that Russia may be working on a weapon in space that could wipe out thousands of those satellites in one attack. As we've seen here on earth, policing or regulating the high seas is so difficult because no one owns them. That lesson now moving to outer space.
