ZAIN ASHER, CNN ANCHOR: Crossing the line, comments from a friend of Donald Trump lead to a sudden swell of major celebrity endorsements for Kamala 
 
 Harris.
 
BIANNA GOLODRYGA, CNN ANCHOR: ONE WORLD starts right now.
 
Eight more days, that's it, folks. We've been counting for you. Trump and Harris hit the trail as new controversy swirls around the Trump campaign.
 
ASHER: And an appropriate response. Iran says it doesn't want war but will never yield to an aggressor. Reaction from the region.
 
GOLODRYGA: And later, the big question. Game three in the World Series is set for tonight. But will the Dodgers be without their star player?
 
Hello, everyone. Live from New York, I'm Bianna Golodryga.
 
ASHER: And I'm Zain Asher. You are watching ONE WORLD.
 
One week and one day. Election day is literally right around the corner.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes. Next week. Should come as no surprise that the candidates are now hitting as many swing states as possible in these final days of the 
 
 campaign.
 
Now, a day after a series of events in Pennsylvania, Kamala Harris is hitting Michigan today. As for Donald Trump, he's in Georgia the day after 
 
 a huge rally in New York City that has drawn plenty of criticism.
 
ASHER: Yes. Trump and his allies pulled no punches on Sunday. The fiery, really apocalyptic rhetoric that came from stage at Madison Square Garden 
 
 has been described as one of the darkest closing messages in basically U.S. political history.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes. We saw speaker after speaker use extreme language to demonize Harris, one calling her the Antichrist and another implying she's 
 
 a prostitute.
 
They also repeatedly blasted immigrants as America's greatest problem. Some of the most controversial comments came from the comedian, Tony 
 
 Hinchcliffe, who made a racist joke about people from the island of Puerto Rico.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TONY HINCHCLIFFE, AMERICAN COMEDIAN: I don't know if you guys know this, but there's literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the 
 
 ocean right now. Yes. I think it's called Puerto Rico.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ASHER: Several prominent Latino entertainers have condemned Hinchcliffe for that and posted positive words about Kamala Harris on social media as well. 
 
 A Trump campaign spokesperson disavowed Hinchcliffe's remarks. But speaking moments ago, Harris said that this kind of rhetoric is what Donald Trump's 
 
 entire campaign has really been about.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I think last night Donald Trump's event in Madison 
 
 Square Garden really highlighted a point that I've been making throughout this campaign.
 
He is focused and actually fixated on his grievances, on himself, and on dividing our country. 
 
This is not new about him, by the way. What he did last night is not a discovery. It is just more of the same and maybe more vivid than usual.
 
Donald Trump spends full time trying to have Americans point their finger at each other. Fans the fuel of hate and division. And that's why people 
 
 are exhausted with him.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLODRYGA: When it came time for Trump to finally take the stage last night, he went after immigrants too, calling the United States an occupied 
 
 country facing an immigrant invasion. And again, vowing to order mass deportations.
 
And he promised to take revenge on anyone who opposes him, again, calling Democrats the enemy from within.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: It's just this amorphous group of people, but they're smart and they're vicious, and we have to 
 
 defeat them.
 
They are indeed the enemy from within. But this is who we're fighting.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ASHER: And a brand-new CNN poll shows deep concerns among Americans about what will happen after the election. A lot of people have been really 
 
 concerned about this. Eighty-eight percent of registered voters think that there is an obligation for the losing candidate to accept the results and 
 
 concede. But about seven in 10 think Donald Trump will not do that if he loses.
 
Meantime, the vast majority of Americans, even Trump supporters, think that Harris will concede if she loses.
 
GOLODRYGA: With much more on what is happening these final days of the race, we welcome CNN's Alayna Treene tracking the Trump campaign. Our Eva 
 
 McKend traveling with Kamala Harris. And CNN polling and data expert, Harry Enten. An all-star lineup -- 
 
ASHER: Look at that look. Look at Harry's look.
 
GOLODRYGA: Classic Harry.
 
Alayna, let's start with you. We've seen quite some damning condemnation, I would say, for what we heard over the weekend from the so-called comedian. 
 
 I'd never heard of him. I think Zain -- 
 <br>[12:05:09]
 
ASHER: Nope. Nope.
 
GOLODRYGA: -- had never heard of him either at this rally yesterday, given what he said about Puerto Ricans and others, anti-Semitic remarks about 
 
 Jews as well.
 
But this doesn't deviate that far, though, from some of the own rhetoric we heard from Donald Trump himself calling the United States a garbage can and 
 
 trash, essentially, just last week.
 
So they're distancing from the comedian's remarks, but not everything else that was said last night.
 
ALAYNA TREENE, CNN REPORTER: That's right. And I do want to be clear. I mean, some of the pre-programming, the speakers who came on before Donald 
 
 Trump, I mean, we heard a series of incredibly inflammatory, dark rhetoric from them. I want to read for you some of it.
 
We heard from Sid Rosenberg. He is a radio host. He referred to second gentleman Doug Emhoff as, quote, a crappy Jew. He also referred to Hillary 
 
 Clinton as a, quote, sick bastard.
 
Trump's friend, David Rem, he spoke. He said that Harris was the anti- Christ. I mean, the list goes on. We heard a lot of, again, very inflammatory racist commentary from these preprogramming speakers.
 
What I actually find interesting is when I've talked to a lot of people over the last 24 hours, Republicans, those close to Donald Trump. They 
 
 argue that, in some ways, they actually think that the speakers who came on before him upstaged him.
 
I mean, if you look at the media today, you look at the stories that have been written. A lot of the focus is on that commentary, not necessarily the 
 
 commentary from Donald Trump.
 
And I'd also point out that yesterday, Trump's remarks at Madison Square Garden are supposed to be, or were supposed to be, I should say, his 
 
 closing argument to voters. That's really what this next period is. This next eight days is really about trying to leave a final impression on 
 
 voters.
 
And as we've been covering for several months now, the definition of what that impression should be is different from what Donald Trump and his camp 
 
 thinks to Republicans at large. We know that a lot of people have been pressuring Donald Trump. And I say people, as in those who want him to win 
 
 next week, are saying that he needs to be talking about the issues, the economy, the border, you know, reminding voters that was your life better 
 
 four years ago than it is now? Those are the type of policy-framing points that they want the former president to be making.
 
However, yesterday, we really saw a number of people on the MAGA fringe kind of using the type of inflammatory rhetoric that they think does not 
 
 help, particularly when it comes to swing voters or, as we know, that Donald Trump's campaign has been targeting Latino voters, Hispanic voters, 
 
 black voters, all of these different types of groups that they think can make a difference for them on the margins.
 
But I do want to get back to Donald Trump's comments himself. He himself painted a very dark picture of America. He talked a lot. He repeated a lot 
 
 of falsehoods about immigration. He said criminals were coming over the border from insane asylums, prisons, things that we know are just not true 
 
 or heavily exaggerated.
 
He again talked about the enemy from within and called the press the enemy of the people. This is the type of language, again, that is at odds with 
 
 some -- with what many people think he should be doing.
 
But it's also language, when I talk to Trump's team, that they think, you know, helped him in 2016 propel him to the White House. And they do believe 
 
 that it could help him again. They think that fear-mongering that he is doing, installing -- instilling fear in the minds of voters about 
 
 immigration and democracy at large could actually be effective. So we'll see.
 
You know, we have the election in just eight days now. We'll see whether or not that works. But this is kind of the strategy that he has taken, even 
 
 though many people are saying this is not what you should be doing in the final stretch of this campaign.
 
GOLODRYGA: All right. Alayna Treene, thanks so much.
 
And let's bring in Eva McKend joining us live now as well. So, Eva, I'm not sure if you were listening to what Alayna was saying, but essentially, it 
 
 is true that Donald Trump, not only has he not really paid any kind of political price for some inflammatory comments and really sort of heated 
 
 remarks that he's made in the past, but as Alayna was saying, a lot of people believe that it actually helped him win in 2016.
 
So when you have those factors at play, I mean even though Kamala Harris has come out and condemned and said, listen, this is who Donald Trump is, 
 
 this is what I'm trying to -- this is who he is, this is what I've been trying to tell you, can it really make a difference eight days until the 
 
 election? What say you?
 
EVA MCKEND, CNN U.S. NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Zain, Bianna, I will tell you that the vice president's focus today here in Michigan is a 
 
 big manufacturing push. She is going to visit an assembly line, visit with workers at a semiconductor facility. And then later on, go to a labor union 
 
 training facility.
 
It's an opportunity for her to tout the winds, as she sees them, of the Biden-Harris administration when it comes to this issue, when it comes to 
 
 the CHIPS Act, which they argue fortified these manufacturing jobs.
 
And she will talk about how her policy is rooted in this, advancing apprenticeship programs and giving tax credits to manufacturers.
 <br>[12:10:07]
 
And so this comes at a time when Democrats, in some corners, very much want to see this from her. They don't see a lot of value in her re-litigating 
 
 the former president's character. They think that argument can only get her so far because he's sort of impervious to criticism in this arena in some 
 
 corners.
 
So we see the vice president trying to stay on message. Yes, she will talk about Trump if asked, but today here in Michigan, it's all about 
 
 manufacturing. Take a listen to what she told Norah O'Donnell about her first 100 days in office.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
NORAH O'DONNELL, CBS ANCHOR: What would your first 100 days look like? What would be your top legislative priority?
 
HARRIS: Well, it's going to be lowering costs and a package of legislation that is about lowering cost again on the issue of housing, small 
 
 businesses, child tax credit, basically putting more money in the hands of American working people but also cutting middle-class taxes.
 
A priority in equal form is going to be what we need to do to deal with reproductive health care and reinstate the freedoms and the rights that all 
 
 people should have and women should have over their own body. And then dealing with immigration and, in particular, border security and bringing 
 
 back up that bipartisan bill that Donald Trump killed so we can get more resources down to the border.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MCKEND: And so you see her answer to the -- that getting a little crisper. She's been criticized for being a little long-winded, jargony when 
 
 answering what her policy vision is.
 
And ultimately, Zain and Bianna, that is because those issues are the most important to voters. 
 
Now, she ends her swing today in Michigan at a big rally here in Ann Arbor. This is a college town. It is called "When We Vote, We Win." It's a concert 
 
 series. We're going to hear from the performer Maggie Rogers.
 
And then we are going to see Vice President Harris actually on stage with her running mate, Governor Walz. It's going to be a rare joint appearance 
 
 with the two. Zain, Bianna?
 
ASHER: All right. Eva McKend laying out Kamala Harris' plans for the day. Thank you so much.
 
GOLODRYGA: All right. Last but certainly not least, Harry Enten has been patiently waiting, and you're learning more.
 
ASHER: I love the expressions, Harry. You're so entertaining. Keep it coming.
 
GOLODRYGA: He's learning more and more, Harry, about voters and whether or not they'll even go to the polls. Where's enthusiasm this year versus 2020?
 
HARRY ENTEN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL DATA REPORTER: Yes. They took away my magic wall so I have to make it up with expressions.
 
GOLODRYGA: Your hands.
 
ASHER: Your hands. Yes.
 
ENTEN: My hands. I also have a mirror here so I could look at myself, make sure I'm good looking.
 
But look, if we're looking right now at the polling data, I think a lot of people are like, oh, turnout's going to be up, right? You know, all these 
 
 people going out early voting. I'm not quite so sure that it will be up because if we take a look at some polling metrics and compare them to where 
 
 they were four years ago, when, of course, we had record turnout, a certain to vote, extremely motivated to vote.
 
Look at this. In 2020, 88 percent of registered voters said that they were certain to vote at this point. Now it's just 81 percent. Extremely 
 
 motivated to vote. It was 73 percent at this point in 2020. It's now just 65 percent.
 
And I'll note that this matches up with what we saw in the 2022 midterms when turnout was down versus four years ago. 2018, of course, had record 
 
 midterm turnout, preceding the record turnout that we saw in 2020.
 
And also, there's this thing called the Washington top two primary, all the way out on the West Coast here in the states, and which is often times 
 
 predictive of what will happen in the fall and turn out their drop compared to four years ago.
 
So I'm not quite sure we're going to see record turnout this time around. I would not be surprised if turnout dropped.
 
Now, the question is, why? Why would turnout drop? Well, I think this question from "The New York Times" gets at it pretty well. You know, every 
 
 single election cycle, we have all these folks saying, this is the most important election of our lifetimes.
 
Well, interestingly enough, "The New York Times" actually polled this and they asked, is this the most important election of your lifetime?
 
And what you see is back in 2020, 74 percent of registered voters said that, yes, it was in fact the most important election of my lifetime.
 
Today, in 2024, that percentage dropped by nearly 10 points, to 65 percent. So folks, despite all the folks going out there, all the rhetoric from the 
 
 politicians arguing that it's the most important election of their lifetime, a lot of voters who said so four years ago, aren't necessarily 
 
 saying the same thing this time around.
 
Now, here's the question though, right? Let's say if turnout does drop, does that actually benefit either side, either Kamala Harris or Donald 
 
 Trump? Well, a way we can get at that is essentially by looking at, OK, we're going to ask the horse race among all registered voters and then 
 
 we're going to limit it down to likely voters, i.e. a smaller portion of the electorate that's actually going to turn out and vote.
 
Is there any difference between how those two groups feel? If you'd asked me a few months ago, I would have said, yes, there is a difference. Kamala 
 
 Harris seems to be doing slightly better among likely voters than registered voters.
 <br>[12:15:03]
 
But if we look at it today, look at this. The gap between Harris and Trump among registered voters has Harris up by a point well within the margin of 
 
 error. If you look among likely voters, Harris still up by a point, again, well within the margin of error.
 
So it's not necessarily clear to me that lower turnout would benefit either side, but it does mean that each vote means that much more. And the 
 
 question is, as we are just eight days from election day, it's not just whether or not I'll continue looking at myself in the mirror, the question 
 
 is which side will actually be able to get those few extra voters out there because this election, my dear friends, is so freaking close that just a 
 
 few votes either way could make all the difference.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes. And I've -- 
 
ASHER: Yes, vital.
 
GOLODRYGA: -- long said that that line of this being the most important election of your lifetime loses its potency if it's -- 
 
ENTEN: Yes.
 
GOLODRYGA: -- repeated in every single election.
 
ASHER: Yes. It devalues the currency for sure.
 
GOLODRYGA: Exactly.
 
Harry Enten, I'll see you in the makeup room tomorrow morning as well. You look great, my friend.
 
ASHER: You look great.
 
ENTEN: Bye.
 
ASHER: All right. Our next guest has seen many elections up close and personal. We are joined live now by Asa Hutchinson, former governor of 
 
 Arkansas and resident fellow at the Harvard Institute of Politics. Asa, thank you so much for being with us.
 
So I'm sure you were equally as disgusted as we were listening to some of those comments by Tony Hinchcliffe as he talked about Puerto Rico and 
 
 Puerto Ricans, just in terms of whether or not Donald Trump ends up paying any kind of political price for this.
 
You know, one of our correspondents was just simply saying that this kind of rhetoric -- there are a lot of people -- within the Trump camp, who 
 
 believe that this is the kind of rhetoric that actually got him elected in the first place in 2016.
 
So he's gotten away with this sort of stuff in the past, speaking about Trump specifically. Why would it be any different this time, do you think, 
 
 Asa?
 
ASA HUTCHINSON, FORMER GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS: Well, I doubt that it will make much difference in terms of hurting Donald Trump.
 
Generally in politics, a candidate will hit hard the opponent and be negative as you lead up to the campaign, but in the closing days, you turn 
 
 positive. And I think that's why Kamala Harris is going to Michigan, focusing on what they have done in their administration for manufacturing, 
 
 for semiconductor production in the United States.
 
Donald Trump, on the other hand, He simply bears down even more negative in the closing days. And I think he's seen it that he believes it works for 
 
 him. And that's what motivates his voters.
 
As a Republican, I don't like the harsh rhetoric that comes out, not just of Donald Trump, but his supporters in Madison Square Garden last night. 
 
 And Donald Trump has unleashed the whirlwind with this rhetoric. It is dark, it is demeaning to immigrants, it's demeaning to our democracy. And 
 
 we'll see if he pays a price for it, but he hasn't yet. But we will see whether it motivates his voters to get out or whether it discourages them.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes. The only time Donald Trump seems to talk positive is after he wins. Otherwise, he calls this country a garbage can.
 
Governor, in the sense of going after these last remaining handful of undecided voters that are so crucial in this election, given how close this 
 
 race is. I'm wondering who you have spoken to in that camp and what they tell you about why they still have not made up their mind eight days before 
 
 the election, where, whether or not you like Kamala Harris' policies, she's really made an effort to speak more about them versus what we're hearing 
 
 from the Trump camp, which is just more of this nasty rhetoric.
 
HUTCHINSON: That's right. That's an important question. And it's hard for the average person out there who follows politics to believe there's 
 
 anybody undecided in this race, but I'm convinced they are.
 
And the reason is that they don't feel comfortable with Donald Trump, but they don't -- have not been persuaded by Kamala Harris yet. And they're 
 
 waiting to be persuaded by her that she has the strength to be president, that she is not so inconsistent that she's going to flip back to the 
 
 progressive left whenever she's turned more moderate in this campaign.
 
And so there is a willingness to move away from Donald Trump, but there's not a confidence in moving toward Kamala Harris. That's her opportunity, 
 
 her challenge, and that's the reason she has a chance to expand her voting base. And Donald Trump is simply trying to hold on to his through this 
 
 demagoguery and these fear-mongering tactics that he has.
 
ASHER: And how concerned are you about the potential for violence in the event that Donald Trump loses? I mean, he's already laying the groundwork 
 
 just to sort of undermine the validity of the results, saying the only way that he can lose is if they, AKA, the Democrats, cheat, and saying that he 
 
 will only accept the results if the results are fair, legal, and good.
 <br>[12:20:09]
 
How concerned are you for the week after, Asa?
 
HUTCHINSON: Well, of course, you can determine a fair legal election through the right recourses after the campaign. Those things are resolved 
 
 fairly quickly. And then there's the result.
 
The question is, after that is all resolved, will Donald Trump accept the results of the election if he loses? Absolutely not. His ego will not let 
 
 him do it.
 
But the question of violence is a different matter. And I believe the American people learned a lot in looking at the horrific images of January 
 
 6 2020. That was something we don't want to repeat. And the capitol is going to be protected. So if there is a problem, it's going to be different 
 
 than what you saw in 2020 in January 6.
 
And so I think we'll be more prepared. I think we'll be resilient and more resistant to the tired old tactics that Donald Trump gives out that the 
 
 election was stolen. We will see. But if he -- if he loses it, he won't accept it, but I'm hopeful that we'll still have a peaceful transfer of 
 
 power.
 
ASHER: Yes, we're more prepared for it this time.
 
GOLODRYGA: The fact that you still have to say, I hope.
 
ASHER: Yes, I know, right?
 
GOLODRYGA: This was something.
 
ASHER: Tells you a lot.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes, exactly. Never would have even discussed prior to what we saw in 2021. 
 
Asa Hutchinson, Governor, thank you so much for the time.
 
ASHER: Thank you. All right. Just ahead -- 
 
HUTCHINSON: Thank you. Good to be with -- 
 
ASHER: -- on ONE WORLD.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Sometimes you have to say American first, conservative second, Republican third.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ASHER: Some Republicans in Pennsylvania who don't support Donald Trump talk to CNN about why they will vote democratic for the first time ever.
 
GOLODRYGA: Also, another round of Gaza ceasefire hostage deal talks begin in Doha. But for the people of Gaza, the nightmare continues. We'll have a 
 
 live report ahead from Jerusalem. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
GOLODRYGA: The latest round of Gaza ceasefire and hostage release talks have begun in Qatar.
 
ASHER: All right. Egypt is proposing a two-day truce in Gaza, but a source says no significant progress is expected until after a winner is declared 
 
 in the U.S. election on November 5th.
 <br>[12:25:08]
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes. This as Iran vows what it calls an appropriate response to Israeli strikes, but says it does not seek a wider war with Israel.
 
Israel's prime minister says his nation has damaged Iran's defense capabilities.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Iran attacked Israel with hundreds of ballistic missiles. This attack has 
 
 failed. We promised back then that we would respond.
 
And in the early hours of Saturday morning, we kept our promise. The Air Force attacked across Iran. We harshly harmed the defensibility of Iran and 
 
 its ability to manufacture missiles directed at us.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ASHER: The United Nations issuing a stark warning about the dire situation in Northern Gaza, saying the entire population there is pretty much at risk 
 
 of dying. Gaza's civil defense says that more than 1,000 people have been killed there since Israel began a large-scale incursion this month.
 
The IDF says it will keep up its assaults on the Jabalia refugee camp for a few more weeks. 
 
CNN's Jeremy Diamond joins us now live from Jerusalem. Jeremy, it's been quite a weekend. If we were to talk about one issue though right now, I 
 
 guess the newest development is this headline out of Egypt, Egypt's President Sisi, proposing a short-term ceasefire deal that would see the 
 
 release of a few of the hostages. Walk us through what this detail, what this new plan entails and how the Israelis are responding to it.
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Bianna. This proposal really is quite different from what has been the basis of hostage and 
 
 ceasefire negotiations pretty much since last November, when there was that seven-day truce that saw the release of dozens of hostages but ultimately 
 
 fell apart.
 
And that's because we're no longer talking about a kind of extended three- phase deal that would ultimately lead to the withdrawal of Israeli troops and the end of the war in Gaza.
 
Instead, the Egyptian president has put something on the table that is far more limited, a two-day truce in exchange for the release of four Israeli 
 
 hostages, an unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.
 
And ultimately, the hope, it seems, from the Egyptians is that that could lead to further negotiations between Israel and Hamas to ultimately see the 
 
 end of this war, but that there would be no real commitment here, especially on the Israeli side, to actually going into longer-term 
 
 negotiations.
 
And that's where the question is about whether or not that's something that Hamas would be open to.
 
We know that in the past Hamas has insisted that freeing any hostages would have to be tied to some kind of a process that would see the withdrawal of 
 
 Israeli troops and the end of the war in Gaza. And that is very much not the case here, but the dynamic has, of course, significantly shifted.
 
Hamas' leader, Yahya Sinwar, was killed by the Israeli military, Hamas as a military and political organization in Gaza, has really been decimated. It 
 
 is basically just a guerrilla fighting force now, one that Israel is continuing to fight, they say, in Northern Gaza.
 
But the dynamic certainly has shifted in favor of giving Israel more leverage. That doesn't necessarily mean that that's something that Hamas 
 
 would accept.
 
And we also don't really know who is making the decisions within Hamas at this stage. We know that Khalil al-Hayya was the key negotiator, seems to 
 
 remain the key negotiator, but the question is, who is he actually answering to? Who will give him the authority to green light a deal where 
 
 you would need Hamas fighters on the ground to be actually releasing hostages in Gaza?
 
So there is certainly some movement, but it seems far from certain that this will be the new phase of negotiations that will actually unlock 
 
 something in Gaza.
 
GOLODRYGA: And as noted, I probably won't see more progress on this issue. And let's be honest, any of the other issues looming in the region there 
 
 until after the U.S. election next week as well.
 
Jeremy Diamond, thank you so much.
 
ASHER: Thank you.
 
All right. Some of the jokes that were heard at a Trump rally on Sunday are getting anything but laughs. CNN's Ana Navarro will join us to talk about 
 
 the outrage over a comedian's comments about Puerto Rico. That's next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:30:27]
 
GOLODRYGA: Well, happening just moments ago, U.S. President Biden cast his early ballot for the next president of the United States in Delaware.
 
ASHER: Yes. These are pictures from the president's polling station in Wilmington, Delaware. No doubt, of course, for the president, a really 
 
 bittersweet moment, right, because he dropped out of the race in July.
 
The president has largely been absent from the campaign trail in the closing stretch there. He is being clapped for.
 
GOLODRYGA: Well, citizens of Puerto Rico are Americans, but they can't vote for president. However, there are millions of Puerto Ricans living in the 
 
 states that can. And now a controversy over a comedian's jokes at the Trump rally in New York Sunday night is sparking outrage from both Republicans 
 
 and Democrats.
 
This after Tony Hinchcliffe called Puerto Rico a floating island of garbage. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez telling CNN, it reflects 
 
 the entire Republican Party's views on the island.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): There's really nothing that's an accident about what was said last night. It is an authentic depiction of 
 
 how Donald Trump believes and what he thinks about Puerto Rico.
 
He even talked about selling Puerto Rico and brought up the idea of selling Puerto Rico when he was president of the United States. This is what these 
 
 people believe, and it's not a joke.

ASHER: Among the prominent Puerto Ricans speaking out in support of Kamala Harris, Jennifer Lopez, Ricky Martin as well. Latin music star, Bad Bunny, 
 
 reposted Harris' reaction to the jokes and her plans for the islands to his 45 million followers on Instagram as well.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRIS: I will cut red tape, ensure disaster recovery funds are used quickly and effectively. I will never forget what Donald Trump did and what 
 
 he did not do when Puerto Rico needed a caring and a competent leader. He abandoned the island, tried to block aid after back to back devastating 
 
 hurricanes, and offered nothing more than paper towels and insults.

GOLODRYGA: Time now for The Exchange. Joining us, CNN senior political commentator, Ana Navarro. She's one of the many Republicans supporting 
 
 Kamala Harris.
 
Ana, welcome back to the program. I'm not even going to waste time talking about whether there's anything redeemable about some of the comments made 
 
 by those in the Trump camp, trying to separate, walk back, disavowing these comments.
 
Because aside from what we heard from the comedian and his references and descriptions of Puerto Rico, that there was a lot of other anti-Semitic 
 
 vile commentary made by many people at the event last night including the former president.
 <br>[12:35:09]
 
I'm just wondering, from your perspective, specifically as it relates to undecided voters, specifically as it relates to many Puerto Rican voters in 
 
 the United States, Pennsylvania, for example, do you think the comments we heard last night will make a difference for those that have yet to decide 
 
 who they're going to vote for?
 
ANA NAVARRO, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I absolutely do. Listen, this last night was like a nuclear bomb went off in the Puerto Rican 
 
 community and the Latino community because he also made some horrible jokes about immigrants and Latinos.
 
It went -- it spread like wildfire all over the social media platforms was up. It was just what everybody was talking about. I think it's going to 
 
 motivate voter turnout amongst Puerto Ricans, amongst Latinos.
 
I think that people who may have been undecided got decided last night. And as you said, there's a huge Puerto Rican community. The third largest in 
 
 the United States is in Pennsylvania. One of the most important swing states.
 
But there's also significant numbers of Puerto Ricans in North Carolina, in Michigan, in Wisconsin. So this is something that could most definitely 
 
 affect the outcome of this presidential election.
 
And, you know, the contrast of yesterday could not have been more stark. In the morning, Kamala Harris released her proposals for Puerto Rico, a Puerto 
 
 Rican agenda policy, proposals.
 
In the evening, we had this MAGA rally at Madison Square Garden where the things that were said about Puerto Rico, which is so offensive. I'm not 
 
 Puerto Rican and it hurt my heart. Today, we're all Puerto Ricans.
 
ASHER: Mm. Ana, well said. And just in terms of another state with a really large Puerto Rican population is, of course, Florida.
 
Now, the fact is, Florida has not voted Republican in the presidential level since 2012, right, since Obama. But are these comments, especially 
 
 when you combine the fact that Florida has very, very strict abortion laws, you know, just all of that together, could it put Florida in play this time 
 
 around? Your thoughts on that.
 
NAVARRO: I would be shocked if it put Florida in play. There's over a million Puerto Ricans that live in Florida, but there's also been early 
 
 voting and voting by mail now for a long time. 
 
And frankly, Democrats have invested very, very little in Florida because they don't see it as a swing state. So there's not much of a ground game, I 
 
 think, for the presidential race in Florida.
 
But I will tell you that the Republican voting for running for senator in Florida, and the congresswoman running for Miami in Florida quickly came 
 
 out, Republicans, both of them, condemning the joke made by this comedian or so-called comedian, because frankly, I don't think he's very funny.
 
What I want you to understand though is that while these Republicans from Florida came out and condemned, Donald Trump did not, right? Donald Trump 
 
 did not come out and speak at that rally until four and a half hours after the comedian had made this joke.
 
This was after Ricky Martin, after J. Lo, after Bad Bunny, after Luis Fonsi. After, I mean, it was already a crisis, a five-alarm fire by the 
 
 time Donald Trump took the stage four and a half hours later. And he did not use that opportunity to condemn the comments or distance himself from 
 
 it. 
 
And I don't know how you distance yourself from this comedian calling Puerto Rico trash when Donald Trump himself has been saying for the last 
 
 few days that immigrants have turned America into the trash can of the world. Those are his words that are being regurgitated by this comedian.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes. The language is strikingly similar.
 
Ana, we have seen Kamala Harris make some inroads once again in the last few weeks with Latino voters per some of the polling that we've seen.
 
But in general, as you know, there has been this theme of the increase in Latino support that Trump has seen since 2016.
 
Now, Democrats still carry the majority of the Latino vote. But what do you make of this increase, specifically among Latino men? We've spent a lot of 
 
 time talking about black men, as well as seeing an increase in support for Donald Trump.
 
NAVARRO: Look, I think -- I think Donald Trump has invested in this group. Definitely, he's going to get huge numbers in a place like Miami, in 
 
 Florida, where I am from. He's most definitely going to get the majority of the Cuban-American vote there.
 <br>[12:40:11]
 
Also, I'll tell you, Latinos, we are kind of known for being last-minute type of people. And so some of this idea of making the decision last minute 
 
 is idiosyncratic for a lot of us.
 
I think -- I think they're just now beginning to find out who Kamala Harris is, listen to her, really pay attention. And, you know, and I think Kamala 
 
 Harris has been doing a ton of work in states like Nevada, like Arizona, speaking to Latino men. There have been roundtables with Barack Obama. 
 
 There have been Latino men out on the trail for her, like George Lopez, the comedian, the Latino comedian who's actually funny.
 
There's, you know -- I mean, it's been work all over the country with Marc Anthony. Marc Anthony came out with an ad for Kamala Harris two weeks ago. 
 
 It was before all of this from last night. And it was reminding Puerto Ricans and reminding the Latino community the awful things that Donald 
 
 Trump has said and did as president, reminding the Puerto Rican community of when Donald Trump responded to Hurricane Maria by throwing paper towels 
 
 at people in need. And that second-class citizen response he did to Maria as in contrast to other states.
 
So I think it's been a lot of work of caring people who may have, and caring Latinos who may have Trump amnesia.
 
GOLODRYGA: All right. Ana Navarro -- 
 
NAVARRO: And yesterday last night -- 
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes.
 
NAVARRO: Last night was incredibly helpful in that in reminding people who -- 
 
ASHER: Oh, for the reminder, yes.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes.
 
ASHER: In case she forgot.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes. Even his most ardent supporters, I don't think, came out today and said that comedian and the tone of last night's event, overall, 
 
 did Donald Trump any favors.
 
Ana Navarro, thank you so much for taking the time. Please join us again.
 
NAVARRO: Thank you.
 
GOLODRYGA: This has been -- this has been such a treat.
 
ASHER: Yes.
 
NAVARRO: Thank you.
 
ASHER: We really enjoyed it, Ana. Thank you.
 
All right. Both presidential camps are actively courting voters in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes. And a state as competitive as Pennsylvania, tiny shifts can really make a big difference as John King found out speaking to some of the 
 
 state's voters.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JOHN KING, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Michael Pesce is methodical, a stickler for detail and preparation. Pennsylvania's archery deer season is 
 
 now open. This range, a place to shoot targets and adjust your gear.
 
MICHAEL PESCE, PENNSYLVANIA VOTER: Here we go.
 
KING (voice-over): Rifle season is a month away. And at this stop, Pesce is no nonsense. Just a few shots to help him adjust the site, two more to let 
 
 a visitor get a feel for the 30 ought six deer rifle.
 
Conservative in every way, no wasted shots or time, everything by the book, not a fan of surprises. Yet, Pesce is voting for Kamala Harris because he 
 
 is even less of a fan of Donald Trump.
 
KING: You're going to vote for her, but do you know what you're getting?
 
PESCE: No, I don't. And that's the scary part is, you know, I'm not voting for a candidate. I'm not voting for a policy. I'm voting against a 
 
 candidate and policies, and not even all the policies, just, you know, the unstableness of some of the things he says are truly scary.
 
KING (voice-over): Pesce is a Reagan Republican. Supported Nikki Haley in this year's GOP primaries. A never Trumper in a place where that really 
 
 matters, Bucks County, one of the suburban Philadelphia counties crucial to the math in battleground Pennsylvania. He wants his party back and sees a 
 
 second Trump loss as essential.
 
PESCE: Then I think that the Republicans will start coming back to what they were because they don't have that radical right side. They don't have 
 
 the craziness and the instability.
 
KING (voice-over): Berks County is a bit more away from the city, more rural, and more Republican, yet not as deep and reliably red as just a few 
 
 years ago.
 
JOAN LONDON, PENNSYLVANIA VOTER: This neighborhood is becoming a lot like the Philadelphia suburbs. This is a primarily Republican leaning burrow, 
 
 always has been. But when it comes to national elections, I do see more and more support for Democratic candidates.
 
KING (voice-over): Attorney Joan London switched her registration to independent after voting for Haley in the GOP primary. London was asked to 
 
 join this local political program not long after our first visit five months ago.
 
Back then, she told us she would write in a conservative because she viewed President Biden as too old. And later, she told us she viewed Vice 
 
 President Harris as too liberal and untested. But then she watched the Harris-Trump debate.
 
LONDON: The last straw was what he said about the Ukraine, where he said that we have to have a negotiated settlement. For someone who claims to be 
 
 a conservative to say that was, in my opinion, outrageous. It's appeasement.
 <br>[12:45:15]
 
KING (voice-over): So London is now voting Harris, voting Democrat for president for the first time because she believes Trump must lose, because 
 
 she gets the battleground state math.
 
LONDON: I needed to vote against allowing him to become president again. I don't want it on my conscience that I contributed in some way to that. 
 
 Sometimes you have to say American first, conservative second, Republican third.
 
KING (voice-over): Media is in Delaware County, just outside Philly, reliably blue now. But still a test of whether Harris can match or exceed 
 
 Biden's 2020 math.
 
It's also a big test for Trump. He lost the Philly suburbs in 2016, but narrowly won statewide. But he lost these suburbs by a bit more in 2020, 
 
 and he narrowly lost Pennsylvania.
 
KING: We're getting to the end here. Have you made up your mind?
 
CYNTHIA SABATINI, PENNSYLVANIA VOTER: No.
 
KING: Cynthia Sabatini is another never-Trumper, another Haley primary voter, another Republican who won't vote for him, but isn't sure about her.
 
Finish the sentence. Madam Vice President, if you want my vote here in the very important Philadelphia suburbs you need to do --
 
SABATINI: You need to answer questions on point. You need to provide more details about your economic plan. You need to provide more details about 
 
 your vision also for this country.
 
I'm, you know what, a bottom line person. I want details.
 
KING (voice-over): Sabatini is mad at local Democrats she sees as tax and spend happy.
 
KING: Is she going to pay the price for that?
 
SABATINI: She may. She may.
 
KING (voice-over): But she does see an upside for Harris over Trump.
 
SABATINI: I believe she's a person of character. I have no qualms about that. I really do. I think she's an upstanding individual. It's just that I 
 
 really don't know what to expect from her if she is indeed elected.
 
KING (voice-over): Sabatini meditates frequently to clear her mind and reduce stress.
 
SABATINI: Deep inhalations and long exhalations.
 
KING (voice-over): She predicts a final day decision to either vote for Harris or to write in Haley. A vote to help score the suburbs and settle 
 
 the biggest of the battlegrounds.
 
John King, CNN, Media, Pennsylvania.
 
(END VIDEO TAPE)
 
ASHER: All right. And this just into CNN. As Biden was leaving the polls, he spoke to reporters and weighed in on Donald Trump's rally on Sunday for 
 
 the first time. Let's listen to what he had to say.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Just simply embarrassing. Beneath any pressure. But that's -- well, we're getting used to it. That's 
 
 why this election is so important.
 
You know, most presidential scholars I've spoken to talk about the single most consequential thing about a president's character. And he puts that in 
 
 question every time he opens his mouth. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLODRYGA: The President there speaking to reporters after putting in his own vote.
 
We'll be right back with more.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:50:33]
 
GOLODRYGA: All right. Game three of the World Series between the L.A. Dodgers and the New York Yankees is set for tonight right here in New York.
 
ASHER: And Dodgers superstar, Shohei Ohtani, is expected to play despite the fact that he got injured. He had a shoulder injury.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes, yes. One of the most highly paid, one of the best players of all time. Let's get more with CNN's Coy Wire.
 
Listen, Coy, as the mother of a 12-year-old who is a die-hard Yankees fan, if they don't win tonight, I think for their own security's sake, they 
 
 should just go back to L.A.
 
COY WIRE, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR: Yes.
 
GOLODRYGA: Because this really -- 
 
WIRE: Yes.
 
GOLODRYGA: -- really is a nail biter.
 
ASHER: A big deal.
 
GOLODRYGA: For Yankees fans.
 
WIRE: Their chances are slim to none. None has not taken over the building yet, so there is some hope for his side.
 
Now, look, these Dodgers, they do bring that two games and none series lead to New York for tonight's game three against the Yankees. And all eyes are 
 
 going to be on L.A.'s superstar show, Shohei Ohtani.
 
Manager Dave Roberts says the slugger is in a great spot despite that injury right there to his left shoulder while he was trying to steal second 
 
 base in the seventh inning of the last game.
 
And Robert says the Dodgers training staff has told him that Ohtani was feeling good Sunday morning, but a final determination on his status will 
 
 be made later today.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DAVE ROBERTS, LOS ANGELES DODGERS MANAGER: I think that he's obviously very well aware of himself and his body. So if he feels good enough to go, then 
 
 I see no reason why he wouldn't be in there.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WIRE: All right. So Ohtani flew to New York separately from the team last night after undergoing testing back in L.A.
 
First pitch is set for just after 8:00 Eastern in the Bronx. Maybe Bianna will let her son stay up late for that one.
 
All right. Stop what you're doing. You're going to have to watch quite possibly the play of the year in football. It looked like the Bears had the 
 
 Commander's beat after scoring a go-ahead touchdown with less than 30 seconds to go. But that turned out to be plenty of time.
 
For the Commander's rookie, Jayden Daniels.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He was backing up. He's just going to have to let one fly. Goes to the right side. Steps away from the defenders. Gives himself 
 
 some time. Now steps up, fires. Heads towards the end zone. It is a goal.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Touchdown. Touchdown.
 
(CROWD CHEERING)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE)
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WIRE: What? Now, it was a 52-yard Hail Mary to Noah Brown. But Daniels threw this thing like 65 yards in the air, giving Washington the 18 to 15 
 
 win. The coaches, the players, fans going into a frenzy.
 
Daniels was out there running around for about 12 seconds to buy himself more time. And he has been, remember, dealing with a rib injury. So for him 
 
 to pull this off, absolutely incredible.
 
The number two overall pick in the draft is making Commander's nation feel quite thrilled about their outlooks and prospects of this season. He's just 
 
 fun to watch.
 
GOLODRYGA: He made it look so easy too when he caught that football. I was like, I was going to get it all along.
 
WIRE: Yes, just about it.
 
GOLODRYGA: All right. Coy Wire, we'll be -- 
 
ASHER: Thank you, Coy.
 
GOLODRYGA: -- watching the game tonight. Let's hope for a win.
 
WIRE: Oh, yes.
 
GOLODRYGA: For my son's sake.
 
WIRE: Good luck. Good luck.
 
GOLODRYGA: We'll be right back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:55:17]
 
GOLODRYGA: And finally, take a look at the special guest in the audience of Adele's concert in Las Vegas on Saturday. That is Celine Dion giving Adele 
 
 a huge hug. The embrace brought the two powerhouse singers to tears, literally.
 
ASHER: Adele is in the final weeks of her Las Vegas residency. She's performing in the same venue at Caesar's Palace that was specially built 
 
 more than two decades ago for Dion's concerts. 
 
GOLODRYGA: Wonderful moment.
 
Well, that does it for this hour of ONE WORLD. I'm Bianna Golodryga. Zain's about to cry. Thanks so much for watching.
 
ASHER: As usual. "AMANPOUR" is next.
