BIANNA GOLODRYGA, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST: All right. Hello everyone, live from New York, I'm Bianna Golodryga. Zain is off today. You are watching 
 
 ONE WORLD.
 
The Israeli security cabinet is set to meet an hour from now, as the Israeli army chief says the military is preparing for a possible ground 
 
 incursion of Lebanon.
 
Earlier, the IDF announced that it's remobilizing two reserve brigades to the north, as the defense minister hinted at a possible ground operation in 
 
 Lebanon. This comes as Israel carried out a third day of what it's calling extensive airstrikes. Lebanese officials say at least 51 people were 
 
 killed.
 
Hezbollah, meanwhile, also continued its cross-border fire, launching dozens of rockets into Northern Israel.

GOLODRYGA: And in an unprecedented attack by the group hit by the militant group Israel intercepted a missile deep inside the country near Tel Aviv 
 
 marking yet another escalation in the conflict. This being a ballistic missile.
 
Meanwhile, thousands of displaced civilians in Lebanon are trying to escape the violence. Some of them even crossing into war-torn, Syria.
 
CNN's Jomana Karadsheh is in Beirut and Jeremy Diamond joins us now live from Haifa, Israel in the north.
 
Jeremy, let's start with you. As we just noted Israel's army chief, Herzi Halevi, telling troops today to be prepared for possible entry into 
 
 Lebanon. What more are we learning?
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that's right. For days now, since the Israeli military began this new intensified round of 
 
 airstrikes in Lebanon, the most intense airstrikes that Lebanon has seen from Israel since the 2006 war.
 
One of the main questions has been, is this all a precursor to a major ground operation by Israeli forces inside of Lebanon? And today, not only 
 
 is the Israeli military's chief of staff raising the specter of a ground invasion, but he is the second the second general, in just a matter of a 
 
 few hours, the second Israeli general to do just that.
 
Herzi Halevi saying that these Israeli airstrikes that we are seeing in Lebanon are indeed designed to degrade Hezbollah's capabilities, but he 
 
 also said that they are also partially to prepare the ground for the possibility of a ground offensive.
 
He said that as he was speaking with Israeli troops today in Northern Israel, he said that they are preparing for a potential ground operation, 
 
 making very clear that that would mean, quote, boots on the ground in enemy territory.
 
Earlier today, a few hours before that, the head of Israel's Northern Command, General Ori Gordin, also said that Israeli forces must be fully 
 
 prepared for a ground maneuver operation inside of Lebanon.
 
And it's not just the rhetoric, of course. We have also seen two Israeli brigades being called up for reserve duty to potentially move into Lebanon 
 
 as part of such a ground offensive. Of course, none of these generals, nor is anyone in Israel's political leadership saying that a ground offensive 
 
 is definitely happening.
 
But this is the first time this week that we have heard such explicit references to the possibility of a ground offensive. This is we are 
 
 learning that there are some very, very active diplomatic efforts being led by the United States in particular to see if a temporary ceasefire can be 
 
 brought there between Israel and Hezbollah.
 
Those diplomatic efforts underway, but far from certain if they will succeed in preventing this conflict from escalating further.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes. The Biden administration is working on a new initiative to at least put a pause to the fighting as CNN is reporting that U.S. troops 
 
 are being deployed to Cyprus as fears of a wider escalation there in the region intensify. Jeremy, thank you.
 
Jomana Karadsheh, I want to go to you now because for days, we've seen Israeli officials speaking to the Lebanese civilians saying, their fight is 
 
 not with them. It is with Hezbollah.
 
Nonetheless, it is the civilians that are impacted here. And thousands are now seeking shelter as well. Tell us what you're seeing on the ground.
 
JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, you know, Bianna, we have covered this before with other conflicts. You and I have spoken about this. 
 
 It is always the civilians who are caught in the midst of this, who are no party to a conflict, yet, they are the ones who continue to pay the 
 
 heaviest price. And this is what we are seeing here.
 
As you mentioned, this massive wave of displacement that is taking place in the country with people either fleeing their homes out of fear of Israeli 
 
 strikes, whether it's in the south and the east of the country and Beirut's southern suburbs, or heeding the Israeli military's warnings when they told 
 
 them with those text messages and calls earlier this week to get out of areas where Hezbollah is operating.
 <br>[12:05:14]
 
And, you know, there are no specific figures, no official figures yet from the government on how many people have been displaced. But, you know, you 
 
 have the United Nations saying that more than 90,000 people have been displaced from their homes.
 
But keeping in mind, these are only official figures. Those are people who are registered to stay in U.N.-supported shelters. We are also hearing from 
 
 Lebanese officials that the number might be much higher than that.
 
The Lebanese foreign minister is saying the number is approaching 500,000 people who have been displaced from their homes. That's almost 10 percent 
 
 of Lebanon's population.
 
And we are seeing Israeli airstrikes continuing. Today you had massive airstrikes, pretty much focused on Southern Lebanon and the Eastern Beqaa 
 
 Region.
 
According to the country's health minister, they say at least 51 people have been killed, more than 200 others injured. Now there's no -- we don't 
 
 really know how many of them are civilians, how many of them are Hezbollah fighters.
 
But as we have seen, over the past week, in these various Israeli attacks and strikes, of course, the deadliest day in Lebanon in decades was on 
 
 Monday with more than 500 people killed. And what we've heard from Lebanese authorities is many of the casualties are also women and children.
 
And, you know, the Israeli military did say that they have struck 280 Hezbollah targets in Lebanon today. And they are going to continue carrying 
 
 out these strikes.
 
And you speak to people here, Bianna, they tell you neither side is calling this a war yet, but it certainly is feeling like that for many Lebanese.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes. The U.S. and other western officials still calling for a diplomatic off-ramp and pushing for one. Israel saying they've been seeking 
 
 one, but they don't see one now as possibly being feasible.
 
A reminder, Hezbollah began launching rockets into Israel on October 8th. And you are so right to remind us, Jomana, that it is always the civilians 
 
 that bear the brunt of these wars and the fighting.
 
Thank you so much. Keep us posted. We appreciate your reporting.
 
Well, amid the escalating strikes between Israel and Hezbollah, Iran's vice president for Strategic Affairs spoke to CNN on the sidelines of the U.N. 
 
 General Assembly. Christiane Amanpour asked Javad Zarif about the growing conflict.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST: Tell me, is Iran going to get dragged into the current Hezbollah-Israel fight?
 
MOHAMMAD JAVAD ZARIF, VICE PRESIDENT FOR STRATEGIC AFFAIRS OF IRAN: Well, as you have noticed over the past 11 months, the Israelis have tried really 
 
 hard to drag others into the war because what happened was an end to the Israeli claim or illusion of invincibility.
 
And they thought that by -- either by increasing the violence, atrocities, war crimes, whatever, crimes against humanity, they could restore that aura 
 
 of invincibility of Israel. And by dragging others into the conflict they could expand the war, probably bring the United States in and change the 
 
 dynamics of the situation.
 
Everybody in the region understood that and has tried while supporting the people in Gaza who have been under basically the most inhumane system of 
 
 warfare mankind has ever seen to avoid falling into the trap of the Israelis.
 
And Hezbollah has done a great deal of self-restraint over the past 11 months. But now the Israelis are crossing the line, in my view. And there 
 
 is every prospect of the war getting more difficult to contain.
 
And I think the national community has to do whatever it can, as soon as possible, in order to end this most recent escalation by Israel.
 
AMANPOUR: Some of the international community, not only Israel, but the United States and others, say, well, yes, but also Iran is backing 
 
 Hezbollah and Iran has its own responsibility to de-escalate.
 
So you said that you didn't want to fall into any Israeli trap, but things are getting worse. Could you -- Is there a red line that would bring Iran 
 
 into this war?
 
ZARIF: Iran has exercised restraint when Israel conducted military operations against Iran, conducted terrorist operations, killing the leader 
 
 of Hamas who was attending the inauguration of our president of all things and we exercise restraint.
 <br>[12:10:58]
 
We believe that Hezbollah is capable of defending itself. It has been exercising restraint in not doing so. It is -- the responsibility of the 
 
 international community to come in before Hezbollah has to take its defense into its own hands. And maybe the situation will get out of hand at that 
 
 time.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLODRYGA: And you can see the full interview Thursday on "AMANPOUR."
 
Well, Ukraine's president says that his country will not accept anything less than a real and just peace. Volodymyr Zelenskyy comments came earlier 
 
 at the U.N. General Assembly.
 
The president said Vladimir Putin is planning an attack on Ukraine's already battered infrastructure, including nuclear plants. He reminded the 
 
 leaders there that Russia poses a threat to countries beyond Ukraine's borders.
 
Zelenskyy also asked them to be united in their support for his country.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT: I want peace for my people, real peace and just peace.
 
And I'm asking for your support from all nations of the world. We do not divide the world. I ask the same of you, do not divide the world. Be united 
 
 nations.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLODRYGA: Thursday afternoon, President Zelenskyy has a meeting at the White House with President Biden, where he's going to be laying out 
 
 specifics of his victory plan.
 
Let's now bring in Richard Roth, joining us from the United Nations. Richard, how was the president's speech received before the U.N.?
 
RICHARD ROTH, CNN SENIOR U.N. CORRESPONDENT: Strong applause from the General Assembly, which has been on Zelenskyy's side since the conflict 
 
 began. When there have been resolutions considered in the General Assembly over the last two and a half years.
 
Ukraine gets at least about 140, 143 countries in favor of Ukraine. It's nice to have the help of dozens of countries who are sitting in the 
 
 assembly hall, which Zelenskyy and Ukraine have received.
 
But the big meeting, as you mentioned, is tomorrow in Washington, the so- called victory plan being considered by the United States. Some of the attention on Ukraine has gone away because of this unbelievable visual 
 
 conflict in the Middle East, but Zelenskyy will keep at it. Former comedian, now the head of a country, going through a horrible war for at 
 
 least two and a half years.
 
GOLODRYGA: Richard Roth, and we'll be following his meetings in Washington later this week. Thank you so much.
 
CNN's Fred Pleitgen is in Kyiv with reaction to the speech.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Very important speech by Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, at the United Nations 
 
 General Assembly. And he tried to make several points. One of the key ones was that he said that Russia's full-on invasion of Ukraine is a threat, not 
 
 just to the territorial integrity of Ukraine, but indeed to Europe and to the entire world.
 
One of the things that he headed the speech off with was nuclear safety, accusing the Russians of planning to attack Ukrainian nuclear facilities 
 
 inside this country.
 
Now, he said that, of course, would be a big threat not just to Ukraine's energy security, but also to the rest of Europe and indeed to the entire 
 
 world if an incident like that got out of control.
 
The other thing that Ukraine's president was also doing is he was trying to prod something that he's been talking about for a very long time, which is 
 
 what he calls his plan for a, quote, just peace.
 
Now, all of that revolves around Ukrainian territorial integrity being restored and Russian forces being forced to leave this country. He says 
 
 that he needs the buy-in of several nations, of course, around the world.
 
But first and foremost, he will need the buy-in of Ukraine's Western allies, the most important of which, of course, is the United States. And 
 
 all of this comes in an important week for Volodymyr Zelenskyy and for Ukraine as this war drags on.
 
He is, of course, set to meet with U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday to try and sell to President Biden what the Ukrainians call the Victory Plan, 
 
 where they essentially want to try and force the Russians into negotiations.
 
One of the key factors the Ukrainians have already said in that is their incursion into Russian territory, but they will also most probably ask for 
 
 substantially more weapons from the United States, more powerful weapons from the United States, but also to be allowed to use some of those longer-
 
 distance weapons to strike deep into Russian territory.
 
And Ukrainians that we speak to on the ground here tell us, for them, that would be absolutely key, if they are to stabilize the situation on the 
 
 front lines and try and push the Russians back. 
 
Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Kyiv.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
GOLODRYGA: Well, thanks to Fred for that report. Well, there's a lot to unpack in President Zelenskyy's speech. Let's get some perspective from 
 
 Andriy Kostin. He is the prosecutor general of Ukraine. Mr. Prosecutor General, thank you so much for joining us.
 
So as we noted, we're expecting to see the president, President Zelenskyy, present his victory plan to President Biden. And, I believe, Vice President 
 
 Harris as well.
 
I will ask you later if he's still planning on meeting with former President Trump. But in this victory plan, he's expected to also talk about 
 
 the need for justice. And in your view, can you walk us through why you think, without restoring justice, it is impossible to have a lasting peace? 
 <br>[12:15:19]
 
ANDRIY KOSTIN, PROSECUTOR GENERAL OF UKRAINE: You're absolutely right, because the restoring justice for all victims and survivors of this war is 
 
 an integral part of peace formula of President Zelenskyy.
 
Just last week, we had a meeting of point seven Restoring Justice, which was attended by more than 70 countries. We all understand that victory 
 
 should be get, not only on the battlefield to restore our territorial integrity and sovereignty, but also in the courtrooms.
 
And our meetings here are devoted to uniting efforts in order to deliver justice for all victims and survivors of this war. Because justice is not 
 
 only about redress to those who suffer, it's also about deterrence. It's also about prevention of commission of the same crimes not only against 
 
 Ukrainian people but also in the other parts of the world.
 
GOLODRYGA: You mentioned that restoration of justice conference, president -- head of the President's Office, Andriy Yermak, participated in that 
 
 thematic conference. I actually spoke with him here in the city at the Council on Foreign Relations for an event a couple of nights ago. 
 
I want to get into what he said to me in a moment. But at this conference that you just referenced, he noted that giving an example of some of the 
 
 crimes Russia has committed, he referenced a photo of a Ukrainian prisoner of war who was executed by Russians, noting that that was not an outlier.
 
Talk more about some of the evidence that you've accumulated.
 
KOSTIN: We have more than 60 cases -- criminal cases registered about the summary execution of Ukrainian prisoners of war. And we're investigating 
 
 each and every case. And we have already identified several suspects for the crimes committed against Ukrainian prisoners of war.
 
The problem is that the Commission of Crimes against Ukrainian prisoners of war is a pattern of conduct of Russian army and Russian forces and Russian 
 
 political metal (PH), because it's not only about summary execution, it's also about torture and ill-treatment, which Russia used against our 
 
 prisoners of war and civilians also who are illegally detained by Russia.
 
Up to 90 percent of prisoners of war who returned to Ukraine during the exchange after first screening communication, they said that they have been 
 
 subjected to different types of torture, ill-treatment and humiliation, including 60 percent of them, where we are witnessing sexual violence or 
 
 gender-based violence.
 
So this is a pattern of conduct which Russia used against all prisoners of war and all civilians. Russia is also attacking civilians every day. Just 
 
 today, just a couple of hours ago, Russia attacked the city of Kramatorsk with civilian buildings with two people killed, two civilians killed and 15 
 
 injured.
 
Just yesterday, Russia attacked residential buildings in Kharkiv with four people killed and more than 30 injured.
 
So the pattern of criminal conduct of Russia is very complex. Not only execution of our prisoners of war, but also deportation of Ukrainian 
 
 children, sexual violence, torture, ill-treatment, destruction of Ukrainian energy infrastructure, attacks on our civilian objects.
 
And also, Russia is also committing crime against natural environment, against cultural heritage. And our meetings here are also to unite efforts 
 
 in order to make Russia accountable for each and every crime committed against Ukrainian people and against Ukraine.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yeah, thousands of Ukrainian children are reported to have been deported into Russia over the course of this 31-month war now.
 
I mentioned Mr. Yermak and he gave an example as he said that he was a point person in the prisoner exchange between Russia and Ukraine. And he 
 
 said at a minimum, the Ukrainians had lost some 40 kilograms each. Just to give a sense of how much weight and sort of the stress and the pressure and 
 
 they faced in Russian camps.
 
Back at a summit in June, a peace summit, you noted that Ukrainian law enforcement, in June, had documented almost 130,000 Russian war crimes 
 
 against Ukraine. And you said on average, that means Russia is committing a war crime every 10 minutes.
 
Where does that number stand now as we're approaching the end of September?
 <br>[12:20:02]
 
KOSTIN: Now, we have registered more than 139,000 incidents of war crimes. So every day in Russia is killing Ukrainians, and every day Russia is 
 
 committing crimes against Ukrainian civilian population.
 
We have established a comprehensive system of accountability, which we call the web of accountability, and which consists of five elements. Each of 
 
 them is complementary to each other.
 
So, of course, 99 percent of all crimes which are documented will be and are persecuted by Ukrainian national authorities, by my office and 
 
 Ukrainian investigators.
 
While we also work intensively with International Criminal Court and six arrest warrants already issued are the best testament of Ukrainian 
 
 cooperation with international justice institutions.
 
We also work with each and every U.N. mechanism which has mandate in Ukraine, including U.N. Inquiry Commission on Ukraine, U.N. Monitoring 
 
 Commission and many others.
 
We also work on bilateral basis with countries who open their national investigations, like for instance, United States, and we commend the 
 
 efforts of Department of Justice of United States who issued already suspicions against the three alleged Russian war criminals for torture and 
 
 ill-treatment of American civilian appeared to be in Kherson in the beginning of 2022.
 
We also have joint investigation team with six more countries. We also work on the feeling the gap and accountability architecture, trying to create a 
 
 special tribunal for the crime of aggression, where more than 40 countries are now negotiating the legal model of this crime.
 
Because the legal model of this tribunal, because the crime of aggression is a leadership crime. And if aggression was not committed, then there 
 
 would be no 139,000 incidents of war crime committed in course of this aggression.
 
We're also working hard in order to insure compensation of damage and loss for all victims and survivors of this war. And International Register of 
 
 Damage is already operational in The Hague.
 
So all of these pillars, all of these elements of our web of accountability are included into our point seven of peace formula.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes.
 
KOSTIN: And we are committed with our partners and friends to deliver justice to all victims of this war.
 
We also want to commemorate victims of the previous wars and conflicts who have not received redress because international community was not able to 
 
 ensure it. And we also need to prevent commission of other crimes, of such crimes in the future. We need to protect our children and our grandchildren 
 
 -- 
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes.
 
KOSTIN: -- from such crimes in the future. That's why it's critically important to work together and to be united for justice.
 
GOLODRYGA: And as we noted, President Zelenskyy will be presenting his victory plan to President Biden Vice President Harris later this week.
 
Will he be meeting with former President Trump?
 
KOSTIN: I have no information from the office of President Zelenskyy, so it's better to communicate with President Zelenskyy regarding his meetings 
 
 in course of this week.
 
GOLODRYGA: All right. Andriy Kostin, thank you so much for your time, Prosecutor General for Ukraine.
 
KOSTIN: Thank you.
 
GOLODRYGA: And still to come for us, Florida and the southeastern U.S. are bracing for what's expected to be a major, rapidly intensifying hurricane. 
 
 We'll have the latest update on Helene, straight ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
GOLODRYGA: Helene is now officially a category one hurricane and it's quickly gathering strength as it heads towards the U.S. Gulf Coast.
 
In Florida, mandatory evacuation orders are in place for several coastal counties. The storm is expected to become a major hurricane before it makes 
 
 landfall Thursday.
 
On its way north, as a tropical storm, Helene drenched Cancun, Mexico, unleashing torrents of rain and powerful wind gusts. CNN meteorologist, 
 
 Elisa Raffa, is tracking Hurricane Helene. 
 
Elisa, what do we know about the main threats right now?
 
ELISA RAFFA, CNN METEOROLOGIST: I mean, it's still continuing to intensify. We're really worried about wind and rain, as it gets to Florida and much of 
 
 the southeast U.S.
 
Hurricane Helene right now has 80 mile per hour winds, gusts up to 100 miles per hour. It has already rapidly intensified. It was just named a 
 
 tropical storm yesterday. And just within 24 hours rapidly intensified to a hurricane. We're expecting that to do that again as it becomes a major 
 
 hurricane of category three strain sitting about five miles south -- 500 miles southwest of Tampa.
 
Here's a look at the track, again, expecting it to rapidly intensify again as it becomes a major category three hurricane. We have hurricane warnings 
 
 in effect for that Big Bend of Florida there.
 
But look at the tropical storm warnings. This storm is going to be very wide. We're talking more than 400 miles. So we're worried about tropical 
 
 storm force winds stretching well far inland. 
 
Atlanta now included in a tropical storm watch for these gusts that could get up to 70 miles per hour or greater. Really worried about widespread 
 
 power outages. When you have that wind field, what that's going to do is slosh in some of that ocean water, 10 to 15 feet of storm surge in that Big 
 
 Bend area from Cedar Key.
 
Still talking though about five to eight feet of storm surge near Tampa Bay. Six to ten feet just north of there. I mean, again, look at how large 
 
 this wind field is. That's where you're going to find that storm surge up and down the entire West Coast of Florida.
 
And then you'll find the tropical storm force winds again stretching far inland. You're looking at winds up to 58 to 73 miles per hour, again, as 
 
 far north as Atlanta.
 
Near the heart where you have that landfall, that's a category three hurricane. Winds will be upwards of 110 miles per hour. So, of course, 
 
 major problems with power and storm surge there. 
 
Plus, we have the footprint of the heavy rain. This has got a lot of tropical moisture with it, combined with a front that's hanging out nearby. 
 
 We could be looking at rainfall totals up to a foot possible in some of the southern Appalachian Mountains here, so really worried about landslides and 
 
 flash flooding even for parts of North Georgia.
 
And, you know, the tip here of the Carolinas where you have some of these mountains here. But look at how widespread this orange is too. We're 
 
 talking about widespread four to eight inches of rain, again, could really cause some problems with flooding. Bianna?
 
GOLODRYGA: Just incredible how quickly it's gathered strength as well over the course of the last several hours. Thank you so much, Elisa Raffa we'll 
 
 be watching
 
Well coming up, civilians caught in the middle. An update on the humanitarian situation in Lebanon as the Israeli-Hezbollah conflict 
 
 escalates. We'll be right back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:30:19]
 
GOLODRYGA: Welcome back to ONE WORLD. I'm Bianna Golodryga.
 
Sources tell CNN that the U.S. is urgently working on a plan to de-escalate tensions between Israel and Hezbollah. But there are signs that the 
 
 conflict could intensify further.
 
The Israeli army chief says that they're preparing for a possible ground incursion. Meanwhile, Hezbollah carried out an unprecedented missile attack 
 
 today.
 
And Tel Aviv people woke up to the sound of sirens. Israel says that it intercepted a ballistic missile as it approached the city. This is 
 
 Hezbollah's deepest strike ever into Israel. The group says it was targeting the Israeli intelligence agency, Mossad.
 
Meanwhile, the IDF announced that it's remobilizing two reserve brigades to the north. A top military official says the operation against Hezbollah in 
 
 Lebanon is entering a new phase.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ORI GORDIN, COMMANDING OFFICER, ISRAEL'S NORTHERN COMMAND (through translator): and we are now in operation Northern Arrows. The operation 
 
 began with a significant blow to Hezbollah's capabilities, focusing on their firepower capabilities, and a very significant hit on the 
 
 organization's commanders and operatives.
 
Facing this, we need to change the security situation. And we must be fully prepared for maneuvers and action.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
GOLODRYGA: This is Israel unleashes more airstrikes on Lebanon for a third day, hitting more than 280 Hezbollah targets.
 
Lebanon's health ministry says at least 51 people were killed Wednesday. The U.N. puts the death toll since Monday at nearly 600.
 
And civilians are continuing to flee. Lebanon's foreign minister says about half a million people have been displaced across Lebanon.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HELME MAHMOUD, LEBANESE RESIDENT (through translator): Nobody feels good when they have to leave their own (INAUDIBLE). And the enemy does not 
 
 differentiate between civilians and militants.
 
We're all civilians and many people murdered while sitting in their homes. Women, children, elderly and babies. Not all of them are military.
 
GOLODRYGA: Health facilities in Lebanon say they are running out of supplies as more and more families arrive at shelters.
 
That brings us to The Exchange. Giacomo Baldini joins me now to talk about the humanitarian situation in Lebanon. He is the country director at Relief 
 
 International. Giacomo, thank you so much for taking the time to join us.
 
As of now, how many civilians have already been displaced from their homes in Southern Lebanon?
 
GIACOMO BALDINI, LEBANON COUNTRY DIRECTOR, RELIEF INTERNATIONAL: Thank you, Bianna, for having me. Well, the situation is extremely alarming. I mean, 
 
 in the past 48 hours, we have seen an escalation with no precedence.
 <br>[12:35:03]
 
The latest numbers, the latest figures that we received is that 100,000 people have been displaced in the past two days. We have to add them into 
 
 the 110,000 people that have been displaced in the past -- in the past year, more or less.
 
It's important to notice that the 40,000 of these 100,000 that I just mentioned are displaced in collective centers. And these are obviously the 
 
 most vulnerable, so the one that did not have the means to pay your rent or do not have relatives who are confined shelter too.
 
GOLODRYGA: Can we go back to what you just noted? Because that was important. This isn't just civilians having to relocate in the last several 
 
 days or weeks. This has been going on for nearly a year after Hezbollah began launching rockets into missiles -- rockets into Israel on October 
 
 8th.
 
Give us a sense of what even the past year has been like for civilians, perhaps on a lower scale, though.
 
BALDINI: Well, yes, I mean, it has been a little bit -- a little bit more diluted over time, and we can say, but definitely in the past 48 hours.
 
Also, the reception capacity that other areas in Lebanon, safer areas ahead that has been really put at strain. We are speaking about entire households 
 
 with the children, with the older people, with people with disabilities, people with specific needs. It's an extremely difficult situation at the 
 
 moment.
 
GOLODRYGA: And where are civilians going? Where are their shelters?
 
BALDINI: Yes. At the moment -- yes. I mean, they are fleeing mainly from the South and Beqaa. Let's try to put one second ourselves in their 
 
 perspective. I mean, they are in clogged highways with airstrikes happening around them.
 
I mean, I received a report from my local staff of cars being bombed a few meters away from one of their parents. So I mean, the situation of 
 
 psychological distress, it's huge. They are trying to move towards North, Mount Lebanon, Beirut, obviously not the areas currently affected by the 
 
 hostilities in Beirut.
 
Basically, they are trying to move north, but the displacement is also the influx of the people that is -- that is extremely complex at the moment.
 
GOLODRYGA: And give us a sense of where things stand in terms of resources, basic resources, water, food, medicine. What is needed most right now?
 
BALDINI: Well, consider that the Lebanon institutions from the -- from the crisis of 2019, 2020, have already been extremely weakened. So, our mental 
 
 capacity to respond, it's very limited and it relies a lot on the international community.
 
So at the moment, INGOs, local NGOs, so non-governmental organizations, together with the United Nations in coordination with the government, with 
 
 the municipalities, I mean, with local institutions are trying to do their best.
 
Most of them are reprogramming in the sense that they are diverting resources from current programs to invest into the emergency response. But, 
 
 obviously, we have a situation in which current programs are still essential. So we badly need resources to respond to this emergency that at 
 
 the moment is on the onset.
 
But now we don't know. I mean, how unpredictable this may in -- how -- what unpredictable way this may evolve.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yeah, I know -- 
 
BALDINI: Yes.
 
GOLODRYGA: Go ahead.
 
BALDINI: No, I mean, just to conclude, I mean, obviously, there are huge needs of basic supplies, non-food items like mattresses, pillows, hygiene 
 
 items like soap, shampoos. I mean, let's try to imagine entire households that are being hosted in schools where there is nothing.
 
And, obviously, there are medical needs to be covered. Acute morbidities. Basic medicines to be distributed.
 
So I would say that -- I mean, the need is at large scale and the assessments are being conducted, but in an extremely fluid and evolving 
 
 environment.
 
Today, for instance, we have detected also some airstrikes inside. So outside of the traditional areas where the hostilities have been seen in 
 
 the past -- in the past months. And that make assessing these collective shelters also very difficult, but the gaps are huge.
 
GOLODRYGA: Given the scale of what you need, the number of civilians that continues to grow by the day that are fleeing that need these resources, I 
 
 know that you're working with the Ministry of Health there in Lebanon.
 
But just for perspective, without the help of international communities, international countries, international aid agencies, will the civilians 
 
 there be able to receive the care they need?
 
BALDINI: No. Absolutely not. I mean, Relief International, together with the rest of the NGO and the U.N. community, provides a huge contribution. 
 
 And obviously, in coordination with the government, with whom that we have been working in the past -- in the past years.
 <br>[12:40:16]
 
But the role of the international community, it's crucial. And, obviously, also the role of international donors that have to pour resources instantly 
 
 to cover the huge needs that are emerging.
 
GOLODRYGA: As we mentioned, the -- you had the Israeli chief of staff, the top general there, say that they are preparing, perhaps, for a possible 
 
 incursion. Many there in Lebanon recall the last major war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006, which lasted 34 days.
 
Give us a sense of what you're hearing from civilians there on the ground as they braced for, perhaps, God forbid, another major land war.
 
BALDINI: Well, Bianna, I am a humanitarian and not a political analyst, so I will not make forecasts. But, obviously, I mean, we are monitoring the 
 
 situation.
 
GOLODRYGA: No, politics aside. Yes, but just -- and many of them have lived through the past war. How fearful are they of another one?
 
BALDINI: There is a situation of a huge psychological distress. I mean, it has been a country that has been more or less stable for 18 years, 
 
 especially the children, have never been exposed to these and the elders know what that -- what that means.
 
Let's consider that in slightly more than a day, already 600 people have been killed and many of these are civilians, including 50 children and 
 
 almost one (TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY) the psychological distress of the community is huge.
 
And for this reason, also in terms of humanitarian response, so whatever we can do in terms of mental health and psychosocial support really need to be 
 
 invested.
 
GOLODRYGA: Well, you're speaking to an international audience right now. You have world leaders gathering here in New York for the UN General 
 
 Assembly. What is your message to them?
 
BALDINI: Well, my message is twofold. On the one hand, I mean, we desperately need financial resources to provide the basic needs to the 
 
 population. And we call for an immediate de-escalation, cessation of hostilities, protection of civilians, and obviously safe humanitarian 
 
 access to the areas that are affected by the conflict.
 
GOLODRYGA: Giacomo Baldini, thank you so much for joining us. And please stay safe. 
 
BALDINI: Bianna, thank you so much to you. Have a good evening.
 
GOLODRYGA: Thank you. You too.
 
And we'll be right back.

GOLODRYGA: Secret Service agents who were working the day Donald Trump was shot in the ear could not say with certainty who was in charge of security 
 
 that day. That is stunning. That is one of the many damning conclusions in a U.S. Senate report looking into what went wrong at the rally in Butler, 
 
 Pennsylvania.
 
The report calls the many security failures there both foreseeable and preventable. And it outlines a frenzy of confusing communications in the 
 
 moments right before the shooter fired at Trump.
 
There's plenty of criticism of the Secret Service in this report. Let's bring in CNN's senior U.S. Justice correspondent, Evan Perez, with more 
 
 details.
 
And even more pressing, Evan, that we've now had not only one assassination -- 
 
EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR U.S. JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Right.
 
GOLODRYGA: -- attempt, but two against the former president.
 
PEREZ: Yes, that's right, Bianna. And look, this report, the words from the chairman who ordered this report in the Senate said it was astonishing to 
 
 see some of the findings, including the fact that if you talk to all of these witnesses, nobody seemed to want to take blame or responsibility for 
 
 so many of these failures.
 
And so that's one of the things that emerges from this Senate report. And one of the things that, obviously, we've focused on is the communications 
 
 issues that you just mentioned, for instance, the idea that the local law enforcement was looking for this guy, someone with a gun or someone who 
 
 they thought was suspicious in, you know, for a long time, for about 30 minutes.
 
And the team that was closest to the ground there, the team that the counter snipers, for instance, were only vaguely aware that the local law 
 
 enforcement was trying to look for -- was trying to locate someone.
 
And it was only when they saw people running from the scene and they saw local law enforcement actually running towards the building where the 
 
 shooter was with their guns drawn that they realized something was wrong.
 
And so that's the reason why they started looking for a threat and they fired the shot, the fatal shot, that killed the shooter that fired the 
 
 shots against the former president.
 
Now, one of the things that we also learned from this was that we knew that there was a threat from Iran, that the Iranians were trying to find someone 
 
 to assassinate Donald Trump.
 
That threat was not communicated to some of the local people who were there in charge of securing this rally. They -- there were a few people at the 
 
 Secret Service who were read in on this -- on this threat, but the actual people on the ground didn't actually know any of the details.
 
And so that, again, really shows you how unprepared they were for this actual event on that day, Bianna.
 
GOLODRYGA: Unbelievable. Justice correspondent Evan Perez, thank you. We'll be right back with more.

 <br>[12:50:34]
 
GOLODRYGA: Georgia is among the key battleground states this election season. Both presidential candidates have Georgia on their minds, focusing 
 
 money and energy on wooing the state's large population of black voters. But is it working?
 
Our John King went to Atlanta to find out.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JOHN KING, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The Ponce City Market, Atlanta's historic Old Fourth Ward. Once an old Sears warehouse, 
 
 near the birthplace of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
 
LAKEYSHA HALLMON, GEORGIA VOTER: Everything started here.
 
KING: Now a community anchor that includes village retail, a showcase for black entrepreneurs. Its motto, a message.
 
HALLMON: Support is a verb tells people to do something. That if you love something, it should be action behind it. Support is a verb has told people 
 
 the way that they can be a part of change.
 
KING: Lakeysha Hallmon started The Village in 2016 as a pop-up market. The retail shop opened in 2020. More proof Atlanta is a beacon of black 
 
 economic and political power. And now a crucial test of whether Kamala Harris can build a coalition to keep Georgia blue.
 
We need to feel that things can change in our lifetime, that we're not always waiting on this fictional place where things get better in America. 
 
 How about we start to do that now?
 
KING: Loyalty to President Biden runs deep in the black community. But the switch to Harris flipped the 2024 vibe here.
 
HALLMON: It doesn't feel so doomsday anymore. It actually feels hopeful and there's excitement.
 
KING: Four in ten Georgia voters in 2020 were people of color, and Biden won 80 percent of them en route to his razor thin win here.
 
Harris needs to match that, maybe more, beginning with giant black turnout.
 
HALLMON: Support is a verb. It really takes us to do something. That means if it rains, get out and vote. That means if you have a car and your 
 
 neighbor doesn't have a car, take them to the polls with you.
 
KING: Chanta Villano-Willis isn't sold, isn't sure the vice president is up to the top job.
 
CHANTA VILLANO-WILLIS, GEORGIA VOTER: I've been a Democrat my entire adult life. This has actually been the first year where I was considering voting 
 
 Republican.
 
KING: Her mother isn't happy.
 
VILLANO-WILLIS: Never thought she'd see a black person president in her life. She did. Now, Kamala Harris is for president. My mother says she 
 
 don't care what she does, let's just get her in there. And I simply don't feel the same.
 
KING: Villano-Willis works a mix of gig jobs so she can care for her mother and a son with special needs. She likes when Donald Trump promises more oil 
 
 drilling and to promote cryptocurrencies, but she sides with Harris on abortion rights and says Trump often talks down to blacks.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Go back in honey.
 
VILLANO-WILLIS: Oh, and his favorite color is black. Boy, please. I -- no. We don't have good choices, period.
 
KING (on-camera): Will you vote or are there circumstances where you might skip it?
 
VILLANO-WILLIS: I'm going to vote because that's my civic American duty. Too many people fought for me to vote.
 
KING (voice-over): Suresh Sharma worked at NASA and G.E. before starting his own business to support manufacturing startups.
 
SURESH SHARMA, GEORGIA VOTER: Strategically and long-term, economy is in a very good shape.
 
KING: Sharma lives in suburban Cobb County, calls himself a textbook independent. Has a three-step test to pick a president.
 
The ability to govern is step one. Sharma says Harris is a blank slate, and he calls Trump a failure because he didn't keep big promises like replacing 
 
 Obamacare and shrinking the debt. 
 
Ability to manage large projects is test two, and Sharma says neither candidate has done that. He leans Harris because of test three.
 
SHARMA: Remember, president is a role model. Therefore, morals matter. And what you say and what you do has a real life implication. I can't tell my 
 
 son that, hey, would you like to be president like him?
 
KING: Rebel Teahouse is in Decatur, part of DeKalb County in the critical Atlanta suburbs. The Harris literature here is proof of a big change. 
 
 Owner, Christine Nguyen, was undecided and unhappy when we first met in April. She sat out 2020 because she had no interest in Biden or Trump and 
 
 dreaded the idea of a rematch.
 
KING (on-camera): Where are you now?
 
CHRISTINE NGUYEN, GEORGIA VOTER: Knowing the background that she came from, knowing the culture that she has to bring, as well as her values and 
 
 beliefs, I'm proud to say that there is somebody who is able to, like, voice the things that we, as a people, have been shouting for like the past 
 
 four years.
 
KING (voice-over): Nguyen says the Harris small business plan meshes with her goal of opening a second location as she lists reproductive rights and 
 
 climate change as top issues.
 
NGUYEN: We deserve more than, you know, the two candidates that were there before who didn't understand us.
 <br>[12:55:05]
 
KING: Debates about whether Trump or Harris are better for business are common and close to home.
 
NGUYEN: That comes up very often. I hear a lot, like, even in my family of entrepreneurs, it comes up every now and then, right, that Trump just knows 
 
 business better.
 
But I think at the end of the day, it's what you value and, like, what your beliefs are in terms of your ethics.
 
KING: Four years after sitting out, Nguyen is excited to vote early. Plus, she's hosting a voter registration event at the Teahouse just before the 
 
 Georgia deadline.
 
NGUYEN: My fingers are crossed. And I will make sure to do my best to get my whole community to the polls.
 
KING: Excited for the big event, well aware the numbers and organization are critical.
 
John King, CNN, Decatur, Georgia.
