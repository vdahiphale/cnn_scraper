CHRISTINA MACFARLANE, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome back to CNN NEWSROOM. Here are some of the top stories we're following today. 
 
The Democratic presidential ticket is on a bus tour through Georgia. Kamala Harris and Tim Walz chose the key battleground state for their first trip since the Democratic Convention, hoping to shave off Republican votes in conservative communities. 
 
Typhoon Shanshan has made landfall in Japan. Officials say at least three people have been killed and dozens are injured. The storm slammed the country's southernmost island with heavy rain and wind and storm surge. There are emergency warnings for flash flooding and landslides across most of the area. 
 
And here you can see the Atlas oil depot in the Rostov region of Russia on fire following a Ukrainian strike. CNN has geolocated the video. Ukraine says the fire broke out after the facility's vertical reservoirs were hit.
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR: There's new controversy involving the Trump campaign and the confrontation at Arlington National Cemetery, a sacred site where many American service members have been laid to rest. Donald Trump was there to honor the 13 U.S. troops killed at the Kabul airport in Afghanistan three years ago and meet with their families. However, the cemetery forbids the use of its hallowed grounds for campaign activities.
 
A source tells NPR an official there tried to block the Trump team from filming and his campaign staff verbally abused and pushed the official aside. A Trump spokesperson denies that it got physical. But Republican vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance claims there was no gross violation of federal law. And he tried to shift the blame to U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris using some harsh language.

SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH), U.S. REPUBLICAN VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Kamala Harris is disgraceful. We're going to talk about a story out of those 13 brave, innocent Americans who lost their lives. It's that Kamala Harris is so asleep at the wheel that she won't even do an investigation into what happened. And she wants to yell at Donald Trump because he showed up. She can -- she can go to hell.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: And CNN's Brian Todd has a closer look now at what's known about the altercation at Arlington.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): This was the scene at Arlington National Cemetery on Monday, former President Donald Trump laying flowers at a gravesite. He was there to honor 13 U.S. military service members killed in the attack at the airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, three years ago. 
 
Not seen here, a controversial incident where, in an effort to enforce cemetery rules, an individual physically blocked Trump's team from accompanying him to part of the cemetery.
 
NPR, which first reported on the incident, says it happened in Section 60 of the cemetery, where recent American casualties are buried. According to NPR, a cemetery official tried to prevent Trump staffers from filming the former president there, that a physical and verbal altercation ensued, and that the Trump staff, quote, verbally abused and pushed the official aside, a report which the Kamala Harris-Tim Walz campaign pounced on.
 
MICHAEL TYLER, COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, HARRIS-WALZ CAMPAIGN: This is, while sad, it's not surprising coming from the Trump team. I think it's part of what the American people have come to reject when it comes to Donald Trump. 
 
TODD (voice-over): The Trump campaign disputes the account of a physical altercation. Trump's campaign manager called the person who blocked Trump's team, quote, despicable.
 
Trump shared a statement from the Gold Star families of those killed in the so called Abbey Gate attack in Kabul, saying, quote: We had given our approval for President Trump's official videographer and photographer to attend the event.
 
The cemetery issued a statement saying federal law prohibits political or election-related activities on its grounds.
 
GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: It is a final resting place and therefore it is hallowed and sacred ground. People that go there reflect. They dedicate time to their loved ones.
 
TODD (voice-over): The Trump campaign says the former president was there simply to honor those killed. But this comes after several other controversies surrounding Trump and the military. 
 <br>[04:35:00]
 
He recently said the Presidential Medal of Freedom given to civilians was, quote, much better than the Medal of Honor. DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Everyone gets the Congressional Medal of Honor they're soldiers. They're either in very bad shape because they've been hit so many times by bullets or they're dead.
 
TODD (voice-over): Trump once said this about Republican Senator and former Vietnam POW John McCain.
 
TRUMP: He's not a war hero.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's a war hero.
 
TRUMP (voice-over): He is war hero --
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Five and a half year --
 
TRUMP: He's a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren't captured.
 
TODD (voice-over): And the Atlantic reported that in 2018, Trump referred to American soldiers who died in World War I as, quote, losers and suckers. Trump denied making those comments, but analysts say all of this has hurt him politically.
 
DAVID WEIGEL, POLITICS REPORTER, SEMAFOR: It was harmful the way that he talked on and off the record about veterans. He underperformed in key areas around military bases.
 
TODD: A Trump campaign spokesperson has suggested that Trump's team has video to back up its version of what occurred here. Contacted by CNN, a spokesperson for the cemetery would only confirm that there was an incident and that a report was filed. 
 
Brian Todd, CNN, at Arlington National Cemetery.

MACFARLANE: Now, French prosecutors have placed the founder of Telegram under formal investigation. In French law, that's a step below being formally charged with a crime. Pavel Durov was released from police custody Wednesday and transferred to court for questioning. The Russian-born billionaire is barred from leaving France and has to report to a French police twice a week.
 
FOSTER: Durov was arrested in Paris on Saturday on a warrant related to the lack of moderation on the popular messaging app. Durov's lawyer says France's investigation is ridiculous.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DAVID-OLIVIER KAMINSKI, PAVEL DUROV'S LAWYER (through translator): I'd like to add that it's totally absurd to think that the head of a social network could be involved in criminal acts that don't concern him either directly or indirectly.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) MACFARLANE: Our Salma Abdelaziz is here to discuss this. So, Salma, this is unusual because normally it's the company rather than the individual that's targeted in cases like these. So, how much of a bold step is this for France to be taking?
 
SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: This is more than just a bold step. It is setting precedent. That is what French prosecutors are trying to do. We're all having these conversations. All governments are having these conversations.
 
How do you regulate social media? How do you make social media safe for children? How do you curb criminal activity on social media?
 
I think everyone is asking that question. French prosecutors are taking a big step forward and saying, well, this might be how. And when they are building this case, everyone is going to really look at this very closely because he is now under formal investigation.
 
He is essentially being accused or being held responsible for any activities and content that is criminally related on his platform. But can prosecutors draw that direct link between criminal activity on the platform and the owner, manager, user of that platform, Pavel Durov? 
 
There are nearly a billion users on Telegram. That is the argument his lawyers are making. There is no way, his lawyers say, that he could be responsible for all of these private conversations. 
 
And then there's the bigger thing. There's the free speech debate, which is what Pavel Durov and his allies are saying. They're saying this is a matter of free speech. We must have spaces in which we can carry out conversations privately without the prying eyes of government.
 
French prosecutors are saying, no, that's simply not the case. You must be held criminally liable for things that happen on your platform. And these are very serious events, criminal activities that are occurring.
 
Drug trafficking, gang-related communications, terror-related communications, child pornography all taking place on Telegram, according to these French prosecutors. 
 
But they absolutely have their work cut out for them in building a case that demonstrates that Pavel Durov is guilty of whatever charges -- remember, he's not charged. Whatever charges they lay out against him. And of drawing that direct link and fighting against that free speech argument that Emmanuel Macron had to even comment on himself, saying this is not political.
 
FOSTER: It's interesting, isn't it? Because it's a messaging app. So these are private conversations between other people. It's not a platform like Facebook, where there are public conversations, where they're responsible for what's put out, arguably.
 
MACFARLANE: Yes, so you can understand that defense to a degree, but at the same time, you know, he's responsible. He's the one solely responsible for this platform.
 
ABDELAZIZ: And what French prosecutors are saying is that Telegram does little to moderate. And that's the argument there.
 
FOSTER: And literally nothing, right?
 
MACFARLANE: That's the distinction, right? They've made no effort here to try and, yes.
 
FOSTER: There's a principle on their part, presumably. We don't moderate at all.
 
ABDELAZIZ: And that's why Telegram is popular. That's why it became such a beloved app.
 
MACFARLANE: But they should moderate if they know there's harmful content being used on their platform. And that's the point I think the French are trying to make here. It's an interesting debate, isn't it?
 <br>[04:40:00]
 
FOSTER: U.S. President Biden, Chinese President Xi Jinping may soon speak over the phone, according to readouts from diplomatic talks in Beijing. U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan is in China meeting with leaders as their countries try to repair strained relations.
 
MACFARLANE: Officials discussed a broad range of topics, including Russia's war on Ukraine, the U.S. supporting Taiwan, and current trade restrictions between the countries. One expert says both parties are waiting to see how the November election unfolds, with a new U.S. president potentially changing their path forward.
 
FOSTER: Still to come, the images of European fashion influencers are appearing in some fake pro-Trump social media accounts. But the influencers say they have no idea the picture was being stolen, as they say.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: Several European fashion influencers have become the faces of some fake pro-Trump accounts on X.
 
MACFARLANE: That's not because the influencers support Trump or have anything they want to do with him, but their images were stolen and then reposted to promote pro-Trump agendas and conspiracy theories. As Katie Polglase reports, some of those influencers are now outraged.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
KATIE POLGLASE. CNN INVESTIGATIVE PRODUCER (voice-over): Debbie is heading home from work in Luxembourg, Northern Europe. Crossing the border into Germany, she races back to her son. And of course, Lou.
 
But Debbie's day doesn't end there. She's also a professional model. Her image, not only her identity, but her source of income helping support her and her son. But it's been stolen, used in a pro-Trump account on X, attracting nearly 30,000 followers in less than six months. 
 
POLGLASE: Here's Luna. 
 
DEBBIE NEDERLOF, MODEL AND SOCIAL MEDIA MANAGER: Yes, that's very crazy.
 
POLGLASE: And when you see these views, you know, it's saying, vote for Trump in 2024. What's your reaction?
 
NEDERLOF: My, to be honest, what the f*** was my reaction? That was my reaction because I have nothing to do with the United States, with Trump, or the political things over there.
 <br>[04:45:04]
 
POLGLASE: And if people following this account believe that this is you, what do you want to say to them?
 
NEDERLOF: That it's definitely not me. Definitely it was never me and it will never be me. And they have to unfollow, please.
 
POLGLASE: In fact, Debbie is not alone. In partnership with the Center for Information Resilience, CNN found nearly 60 fake Trump-supporting accounts. And from these, we identified nearly a dozen women, real women from across Europe, from Denmark to the Netherlands, and as far away as Russia, whose identities are being used in accounts telling voters, American voters, to vote for Trump in the upcoming U.S. election. 
 
POLGLASE (voice-over): Let's take a look at some of these accounts. Like Alina, 33 and voting for Trump. But she's not. She's really Kamilla from Denmark.
 
KAMILLA BROBERG, INFLUENCER: I think it's weird. Anything that can discriminate other people on my account because it's my little universe, I don't think it's fair.
 
POLGLASE (voice-over): And this one, Neriah. She even has a verified blue tick, which is supposed to weed out fake accounts.
 
NERIAH TELLERUP, INFLUENCER: You feel very taken advantage of, also because it's kind of my image. I don't want to think people think that I do what those profiles sometimes are promoting.
 
POLGLASE (voice-over): We ran the suspicious ex-photos through a reverse image search engine and found they were lifted from Instagram posts. Certain patterns emerged. The fake accounts repost each other. It's a sign of a coordinated campaign. 
 
Here, several of the fake accounts post the exact same wording. If you're voting for the man who survived an assassination attempt, I want to follow you. It's another sign the accounts are linked. 
 
And that's not all. Some of the accounts manipulated the images of these women. Have a look at Debbie's post, the original on Instagram and now the fake one on X. Her hat now reads, Make America Great Again. Look at this T-shirt, before and then Trump 2024.
 
For now, we don't know who is behind all these accounts. But the former U.S. National Security Council spokeswoman, who also used to investigate fake accounts for Twitter, told us this.
 
EMILY HOME, FORMER SPOKESPERSON, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL: I don't think it's unreasonable to ask questions about could there be a state actor involved. We know that there are multiple state actors who have been using social media to try to sow disinformation campaigns in the run up to the 2024 election.
 
POLGLASE (voice-over): But regardless, the accounts are reaching influential politicians. Doug Mastriano, a Republican state senator for Pennsylvania, follows Debbie's fake account. CNN contacted the senator about the account but has not heard back.
 
Back in Germany, Debbie is shocked and upset that her image is being used in this way. With President Trump now back on X and Elon Musk, the owner of X, throwing his weight behind him, fake pro-Trump content appears to be flourishing. Silencing the real women affected. Once again, women's rights at the very heart of this presidential election.

FOSTER: CNN has reached out to X regarding these accounts, but didn't receive a response. However, the majority of them were taken down before CNN first published this report.
 
MACFARLANE: Now, the top U.S. health official is warning that parents are facing dangerous levels of stress and it's becoming a public health concern. In a new advisory, U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, who has himself two children, says parents are overwhelmed and burned out with the, quote, dizzying pace of the world. And he called for a culture shift in support of parents and caregivers.
 
In a New York Times essay, Dr. Murthy wrote, quote: In the past few years, we have made progress expanding access to early childhood education, material health programs, and a mental health crisis hotline for kids and adults. 
 
But, he says: We have much more to do, however, to make parenting sustainable. 
 
Dr. Murthy spoke to CNN about some of the major issues that parents are facing.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
VIVEK MURTHY, U.S. SURGEON GENERAL: Very often when I encounter parents across the country, they're talking to me about their kids' challenges, not about their own. But in my work on youth mental health, I came to see very quickly that not only are parents struggling, but they're struggling at surprising levels. 48 percent of parents are saying that they, on most days, feel completely overwhelmed by stress.
 
48 percent of parents, that's compared to 26 percent of other adults. So that tells us we've got a real challenge. And there's a lot that's driving that.
 
You know, parents are not only contending with the usual stressors that come with being a parent, worrying about finances and safety, but they're also worried about how to manage social media and phones for their kids, something that my parents didn't have to worry about. 
 <br>[04:50:00]
 
They're trying to figure out how to contend with a youth mental health crisis and a loneliness epidemic that are hitting kids really hard right now.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
MACFARLANE: The parents of many, well, not together, the parents of many children. It's an important debate, isn't it, to have?
 
FOSTER: Yes, and I relate to a lot of it, and I feel that stress. But I'm also thinking of the counter-argument of people that don't have children saying, well, you chose to have children, and you knew social media, it's not that new. And you know, certainly since you've had kids, you've been aware of the pressures that would come from social media.
 
MACFARLANE: Yes.
 
FOSTER: And I just think there is a point also of saying, there is an argument to say, you shouldn't, you know, you chose to do it, get on with it and don't whinge. But then at the same time, we should probably whinge a bit more because we bottle it up, don't we?
 
MACFARLANE: I think dangerous levels of stress comes with the territory, which is a sad thing to say, because we shouldn't have to deal with all the stresses that go into, quote, having it all, especially as a woman, I feel that quite strongly. So it should be a cultural conversation. I'm glad it is being brought up in this way.
 
But at the same time, we all know that this is what it takes to have children. So it's just a reality, isn't it?
 
FOSTER: I mean, people that really do -- I'm sure you've got friends who should speak about their stresses and they shouldn't be afraid of that.
 
MACFARLANE: Yes, it's encouraging that we're having this debate, but at the same time, it's just the way it is. We don't. 
 
Still ahead, thousands of fans line up outside the Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles to get a bobblehead of superstar Shohei Ohtani to see his dog throw out the first pitch. We'll explain in a little bit.
 
FOSTER: That's a teaser for the ages.
 <br>[04:55:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: Baseball fans flocked to Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles for Shohei Ohtani's bobblehead night.
 
MACFARLANE: Many of them waited in line for several hours in the sweltering heat before Wednesday's game. A few lucky fans received a gold version of the bobblehead, now a hot item for collectors.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: People are selling these gold ones. We've seen up to $17,000. Would you sell it?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, no, no, I'm going to keep it. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's good to know. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, I keep it for my collection.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: Stealing the show, though, was none other than Ohtani's dog. He's called Decoy, appropriately.
 
MACFARLANE: Great name.
 
FOSTER: Instead of the honorary first pitch, Decoy trotted from the pitcher's mound to home plate with a ball in his mouth.
 
MACFARLANE: Good boy.
 
FOSTER: Delivering it right down the middle to his waiting owner.
 
MACFARLANE: The bobblehead of Ohtani featured him posing with his beloved pup. Decoy has become a fan favorite since Ohtani joined the team.
 
FOSTER: He is a beautiful dog.
 
MACFARLANE: Isn't he? Lovely. I'm so glad to get another dog story in, as we always do in this hour.
 
FOSTER: If you combine that with sport, Chrissy couldn't be happier. She's very easy to please.
 
MACFARLANE: This is a heaven story for me, I know. Thank you so much for joining us here at CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Christina Macfarlane.
 
FOSTER: I'm Max Foster. CNN "THIS MORNING" is up next.</pre>
