MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR: Its President is quashing any rumors that his country is retreating from Bakhmut. This as Russia steps up its assault on the east Ukrainian city. This new video shows Ukrainian troops in Bakhmut running from Russia and shelling. Mr. Zelenskyy says reinforcements are on the way and no part of Ukraine will be abandoned.

VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translation): We defend and will defend every part of Ukraine. The time will come and we will liberate every city and village of our country. And we will hold the occupier accountable for every shot against Ukraine, for every meanness against Ukrainians.

FOSTER: Many of the battles are being fought by Russian mercenaries from the Wagner group seen here in this new video. The head of the company is complaining to Russian leaders that his fighters don't have enough ammunition, despite he says during most of the fighting in Bakhmut.
 
Alex Marquardt is covering a story in eastern Ukraine for us. I mean, it's become a very symbolic battle this, hasn't it, for both sides?
 
ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: It has, Max. And in fact, we're already starting to hear noises from Ukrainian. U.S. officials saying that if Russia were to take Bakhmut that it would be more symbolic than strategic but, of course, it has been a very hard-fought battle. Over the past few months, both sides losing thousands and thousands of men.
 
Now over the past day, according to Ukraine's military, they have repelled some 140 Russian attacks up and down the eastern front, many of those attacks around Bakhmut. Ukrainian -- Russian forces have been trying to encircle those Ukrainian forces in Bakhmut. The Russians being led by that Wagner mercenary group. They have made some gains to the north of the city trying to cut off those main supply routes into Bakhmut. But as you noted, Max, the head of Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin complaining that the Ministry of Defense is not giving him that ammunition that his forces need. And that really does highlight the acrimony that has grown between this private mercenary company and the Russian military.
 
Now, Prigozhin also saying that Ukraine is sending more units to reinforce those Ukrainian positions in and around Bakhmut, and that is something that we've also heard from President Zelenskyy. He says that he has met with his top commanders, his top military commanders who recommended to him to keep defending the city, to not retreat, to reinforce those positions.
 
And that's what he says he ordered his generals to do to find other units to send towards Bakhmut to help out those fighting and trying to hold the city. Also, around Bakhmut, Max, we have learned the name of a soldier. That soldier who was so brutally executed in that video that has gone so widespread, presumably executed by Russian soldiers.
 
The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense and the soldiers brigade saying today that his name is Tymofiy Shadura. He was part of the 30th separate mechanized infantry brigade fighting around Bakhmut. So he has been identified but his body is still in Russian controlled territory.
 
Final confirmation would come when his body comes back to Ukraine or back into Ukrainian controlled territory, I should say. But outrage is spreading like wildfire. It is impossible to overstate the fury being felt here in Ukraine after seeing that video from the general population all the way up to President Zelenskyy. Everybody's posting about on social media.
 
And Max, President Zelenskyy has vowed to find the murders of this soldier. Max?
 
FOSTER: Alex Marquardt in Ukraine, thank you.
 
China's new foreign minister issuing a stern rebuke of U.S. policies amid soaring tensions between the world's two largest economies. Qin Gang spoke from the sidelines of the National People's Congress underway in Beijing defended China's relationship with Moscow saying it's imperative in an unstable world.
 
He said China has not provided weapons to either side in the war in Ukraine and he warned of conflict and confrontation if the U.S. does not hit the brakes.

QIN GANG, CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTER (through translation): No Cold War should be allowed to be repeated in Asia. The Ukraine crisis should not be repeated in Asia. It claims to maintain regional security, but in fact, provokes confrontation and plans in Asia Pacific version of NATO.

FOSTER: This just coming into CNN, Iran saying a number of people have been arrested in relation to the poisoning of students in schools. Iran has seen a spike in suspected poisoning attacks of girl schools in recent days. Social media has been flooded with videos of female students being carried into ambulances.
 
The wave of attacks began late in November. On Monday, Iran's supreme leader called the incidents and unforgivable crime and called for severe punishment.
 
CNN's Nada Bashir tracking the story from Istanbul for us. And interesting to see the authorities now cracking down on this.
 <br>[08:05:04]
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER: Yes, absolutely, Max. I mean we heard that warning from Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Monday saying that there would be that severe punishment for anybody found responsible and affirming that the Iranian authorities are investigating these reports.
 
Now, according to Iran's interior ministry, as cited by state media, a number of people have been arrested in connection with these allegations of poisoning, although it's not clear just yet how many people have been arrested and exactly what role they played in these suspected poisonings.
 
But look, according to the authorities here, they are carrying out an investigation, a fact-finding mission has been set up. And so far, they say they have looked into 5,000 cases. The vast majority of those cases, young schoolgirls, as you said.
 
Then we've heard those accounts from parents, from teachers, from victims themselves, describing feelings of heart palpitations, shortness of breath, numbness in their limbs, and so this is a real cause for concern. However, at this stage, according to the fact- finding mission, who has been looking into this investigation, around 90 percent, they claim were -- these symptoms were the result of anxiety.
 
That's how they've described it. Around 10 percent, maybe less, reportedly in relation to what they've described as suspicious substances. Now, this, of course, doesn't stand with the claims that we're hearing from parents, from the teachers, from the medical staff on the ground. They say, they feel they are being silenced by the authorities, by the regime.
 
One teacher, even telling CNN that he believes his phone is being monitored by the authorities. And despite that, and despite the attempts that we've heard by the authorities to attempt to silence these parents, we have seen protests are taking place across the country.
 
There is a real sense of panic amongst parents who are seeing these schoolgirls reporting, apparently, poisoning. We are seeing a process taking place in parts of the country. And there has been a crackdown, in response to that the use of tear gas and forcible disbursement by the authorities.
 
And of course, it's important to remember the context in which this is all taking place. The Iranian regime itself has faced protests since September, mass protests up and down the country, of course, in relation to the killing of Mahsa Jina Amini in September.
 
There has been a real sense of pressure mounting on the regime, and they have in turn crackdown violently on any sign of dissent against the government. And now there is real concern that the schoolgirls may have been part of a targeted attack by the authorities, although that has been of course, denied by the regime.
 
They say they are still investigating the exact cause behind this and this latest arrest make on some information with regard to that, but we are still waiting for more details from the authorities on that front. Max?
 
FOSTER: OK, Nada in Istanbul, thank you.
 
For the sixth time, just this year, schools, airports and trains across France are bracing for a standstill amid calls by unions for a nationwide strike already today. Oil refineries across the country were blockaded by protesting workers.
 
They're pushing back against legislation to raise the retirement age to 64 for most people, which would add two more working years. But so far, the government hasn't budged and still plans to go ahead with the pension reform plans.
 
Our Senior International Correspondent, Jim Bittermann has the latest for us in Paris. How does it compare to other protests you've been to there, Jim?
 
JIM BITTERMANN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Max, absolutely. The protest here is just about to start. There was a vote meant to start just a few minutes ago. Basically, if you see people come in this way, is because they're going to try to find the end of the parade. And the people going the other direction, are going to be marching off the hall. But any minute now to start this punch across Paris.
 
Basically, as you mentioned, this is the sixth of these demonstrations since the beginning of the year. There six demonstrations against the retirement plans of the government. The government wants to opt to retirement age by two years and unions, of course, are dead set against that.
 
There are strikes across the country, some of them but somewhat limited effect there. For instance, 30 percent of the teachers are on strike, but 70 percent were in the classrooms today. And about 40 percent of the railroad workers were on strike.
 
For the unions, this is kind of a do or die moment, because in about a week, little over a week, the bill, the legislation, the enabling legislation which will enact the raise in retirement age that will be due for the National Assembly here for a vote. So the unions then prove their point, have got about a week in time.
 
And what's going to be the key determining factor, I think, is what happens with a strike today. First, how big is it? And then secondly, whether or not the unions at the end of it decide that this is an ongoing strike. This doesn't happen all that often in France. Usually, the strikes are one day.
 <br>[08:10:00]
 
But if they decide it's going to be continuing strike and go on for days, that could, in fact, have a pretty dire effect on the entire country. The union said they want to shut the country down. We're not there yet, but we'll have to see what happens at the end of today's protest. Max?
 
FOSTER: OK, we will indeed see. Jim, thank you for joining us from Paris.
 
We now know the identities of the four Americans who were shot out and kidnapped in Matamoros, Mexico on Friday. Family members tell CNN Latavia McGee and three friends traveling from South Carolina to Mexico so she could get a medical procedure. The FBI saying their white minivan was attacked shortly after they crossed the U.S.-Mexico border.
 
CNN Correspondent Rosa Flores joins us live from Houston, Texas. I mean, an incredible story.
 
ROSA FLORES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: You know, you're absolutely right. And U.S. and Mexico authorities trying to do everything they can to locate these Americans. But this morning, we're learning more about the Americans from their loved ones.
 
We've learned that these are four Americans who are from South Carolina. They are tight friends, they grew up together. And that one of the individuals is a mother of six children, the ages between six and 18. And that this individual was the individual who was headed to Mexico to get a medical procedure, but their family members say that she never made it to that appointment.
 
Now what we know from the FBI is that on Friday, these four Americans crossed over from Brownsville, Texas into Matamoros, Mexico, in a white minivan with North Carolina license plates. Now according to the President of Mexico, these Americans got caught in a confrontation between two different groups.
 
A U.S. official with knowledge of the investigation, telling CNN that this is most likely a terrible case of mistaken identity, that these Americans were mistaken for Haitian smugglers. Now, there's a lot that we don't know. There is a video that has surfaced and also some photographs that show individuals getting dragged into the bed of a white pickup truck.
 
We're still trying to confirm that those are the actual Americans. But Max, one of the ants of those individuals saying that she recognizes the woman in that video saying that she recognizes her blonde hair, recognizes her clothes, that that was the clothes that she was wearing on Friday because they communicated via video chat.
 
And so, again, U.S. authorities, Mexican authorities trying to do everything they can to locate these Americans. The FBI has announced a $50,000 reward for information that leads to the Americans and also to the individuals who kidnap them. Max?
 
FOSTER: OK, thank you, Rosa, for joining us with that.
 
There are growing concerns about aviation safety in the U.S. after law enforcement says an unruly passenger tried to open an emergency exit door before attempting to stab a flight attendant in the neck. Pete Muntean reports on the latest in a series of air scares.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PETE MUNTEAN, CNN AVIATION CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): United Airlines Flight 2609 from Los Angeles to Boston, it was a smooth flight for the first five hours on Sunday until -- 
 
FRANCIS SEVERO TORRES, PASSENGER: Sir, where's the Homeland Security with the gun because I'm waiting for them to point the gun at me so I can show everybody that I won't die when I take every bullet in that clip to wherever in my body they shoot it and then I will kill every man on this plane.
 
MUNTEAN (voice-over): The agitated passenger is identified as Francisco Severo Torres of Massachusetts. The video obtained by CNN was recorded by a passenger. It shows Torres having violent outbursts towards other passengers and flight attendants.
 
TORRES: Hey, Bianca. I love you, Bianca. I'm coming up for you. (INAUDIBLE) for you Bianca.
 
MUNTEAN (voice-over): Four minutes, nervous passengers sat down and listened.
 
TORRES: Nobody cares. Nobody cares. Where's the Homeland Security? There should be the Homeland Security. Where are they diverting us? Because wherever it is, it's going to be a blood bath (ph) everywhere.
 
MUNTEAN (voice-over): 15 seconds later, Torres walks out of his seat, pulls what appears to be a makeshift weapon out of his jacket pocket and said what no airline passenger ever wants to hear.
 
TORRES: Because taking off his plane.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh my god.
 
TORRES: Telling you right now.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh no.
 
TORRES: I'm telling you right now.
 
MUNTEAN (voice-over): While United Airlines says there were no reported injuries, the Justice Department says Torres rushed towards one of the flight attendants and a stabbing motion with a broken metal spoon, hitting the flight attendant on the neck area three times. Torres also told law enforcement that he tried to open the emergency door to jump out of the plane.
 
Torres also claimed he was defending himself because he believed the flight crew was trying to kill him. Video shows passengers and crew members tackling and restraining Torres. A passenger told CNN Torres remained restrained for another 30 minutes before the plane landed safely at Boston Logan International Airport where Torres was arrested.

Still to come, tough talk from China, it suggests the conflict with the U.S. could be inevitable if things continue the way they are. A closer look at why relations are heading further south, next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: How worried should we be about U.S.-China relations? We've heard sharp rhetoric from the Chinese in the last few days. Listen to the new foreign minister accused the U.S. of plotting a regional version of NATO.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
QIN GANG, CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTER: No Cold War should be allowed to be repeated in Asia. The Ukraine crisis should not be repeated in Asia. It claims to maintain regional security but, in fact, provokes confrontation and plans in Asia Pacific version of NATO.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: Earlier this week, China's leader Xi Jinping with this uncommonly blunt message. I quote him, "Western countries led by the United States have implemented all around containment and settlement and suppression of China, which has brought unprecedented severe challenges to our country's development."
 
Marc Stewart in Tokyo, monitoring all of these over recent weeks. I mean, the language is getting quite stark and it's heading in the wrong direction, isn't it?
 
MARC STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Max, the language is strong, it is pointed, it is sharp, yet this is what Japan -- with China often does. It has very pointed language. And that's the way it responds to some of these global threats, these global concerns.
 
Let me just give you some context here. We have a new foreign minister who is obviously trying to make his mark. We have a legislative session that is just about to begin in China. And then we have leader Xi Jinping, who is about to start his unprecedented third term. So for all of these reasons, it's all about making a statement.
 
And that's why we are hearing this very strong language. Does it mean that things are better or worse? Obviously, this entire region, including Japan, where I am now is obviously on guard perhaps in a way that wasn't seen a year or two ago, even maybe five or even 10 years. But at this point, it is all about setting the tone and making a statement. And that's exactly what Beijing is doing, Max.
 
FOSTER: And when they talk about confrontation, they're talking militarily or economically?
 
STEWART: Well, obviously, these these remarks about military confrontation are the ones that are getting attention. And as we have seen across this region, many countries are really doubling down on their military spending. Japan which is tradition a pacifist nation has spent a lot of money on on military -- a hardware in recent months buying new Tomahawk missiles.
 <br>[08:20:09]
 
We have seen Taiwan certainly strengthen its military. But it is not just limited to a potential military confrontation. I mean, one of the biggest forces at play is economics and making economic jabs toward the different nations. I mean, we heard Xi Jinping today refer to the U.S. by name, which is a bit rare say that the U.S. and Western allies have helped to stunt China's growth and as such is urging Chinese firms to run alongside and help the Communist Party.
 
So, while these military statements certainly our attention getting, the economic weapon is certainly a powerful one, especially with China, its ability to manufacture.
 
FOSTER: OK, Marc Stewart in Tokyo, thank you.
 
Ukraine vowing to defend the city of Bakhmut then even as Russian forces step up bombing. We'll show you next the toll it's taking on the city's trapped citizens. They are still there.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: Afghan women have been barred from attending universities this week as classes resumed after a winter break for everyone else. Some of them protested their exclusion by reading their books on a sidewalk in Kabul. They were literally left out in the cold while male students resumed classes indoors.
 
It follows a decision by the Taliban in late December to ban women from higher education. The move has received heavy international condemnation.
 
To our top story -- back to our top story, Ukraine is vowing to defend the eastern city of Bakhmut even as Russian forces close in. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he's ordered reinforcements inside the city where a fierce battle has been raging for months now. Alex Marquardt reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MARQUARDT (voice-over): Racing into the war zone, a white-knuckle drive towards the middle of Bakhmut. This is the last successful emergency evacuation mission by the Bakhmut police. We need to go faster, an officer says. The Russians can clearly see us.
 
This team called the White Angels grabbed civilians who have been trapped. Throwing belongings in the back, there's a cat, someone else with a guitar. The fighting raging nearby. The residents told to hurry up and get in and sit anywhere they can.
 
As they hold on tight, the rescue mission speeds away from the smoldering city. Ahead, there's smoke from a Russian strike. Getting dropped off safely, Leone (ph) tells the officer that everything is blown up in Bakhmut, even inside his apartment. They've survived months of brutally intense assaults. Russia has made gains trying to encircle Bakhmut and surrounding it on three sides as Ukraine desperately tries to fend them off.
 
Today, we met Bakhmut deputy mayor city nearby at a makeshift aid center for Bakhmut evacuees. He tells us it's very hard to persuade the more than 4,000 civilians left there to leave. They say they have nowhere to go and have no money.
 <br>[08:25:07]
 
It's very hard to survive there, he says. It's not life. It's survival. Drinking water is a big problem. Walking to the well is dangerous, he says. Shells landing on your head all the time. All he now feels, he tells us, is fear and sadness.
 
Everyone here knows how hard it will be for Ukraine to hold on to Bakhmut. Svetlana's elderly mother with disabilities didn't want to leave. But Svetlana managed to convince her. I don't know if my house is still standing, she tells us. It's very painful thinking about those still in Bakhmut. Her eyes well up. I just want them all to survive, she says. That's my only wish.

FOSTER: Now, they may look menacing from a distance and they're meant to but these weapons of war are basically full of air. A check company is producing inflatable tanks and rocket launchers which can be used as decoys in battle. The company inflate excess sales of its fake weapons have been soaring especially since the invasion of Ukraine began but it won't reveal who's buying them. So we don't know why. That's top secret.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
POVEN KUMARESAN, INFLATECH MARKETING AND SALES MANAGER: We can't tell you how many countries we sell to. We can't tell you who we're selling to. But definitely we are selling to a lot of governments around the world, yes, not only in Europe, but also in other countries, other regions.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: Mysterious. These synthetic silk decoys weigh between 25 and 90 kilos and can be handled by two to four people on the battlefield.
