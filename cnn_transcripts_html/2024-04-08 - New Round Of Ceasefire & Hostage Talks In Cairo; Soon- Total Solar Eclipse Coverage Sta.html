WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: Nic Robertson, he's joining us from Jerusalem. And our Senior International Correspondent Ben Wedeman, he's in Beirut for us Nic, first to you. Where do things stand right now with these negotiations -- these talks in Cairo?
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: It's hard to judge. Certainly, the Qataris -- the spokesman at the Foreign Ministry in the last hour or so indicated that he has a level of optimism. Although he says it's not there yet. We know that Bill Burns, after the meetings late last night Sunday, gone back to Washington.
 
The Egyptians, indicating that the parties could be back there within a couple of days. It's hard to tell what the mood of music here is in Israel. And if the pullout of the IDF forces in the south of Gaza, in Khan Yunis, a significant pull out of forces, if this changes the dynamic around the negotiating table.
 
But a Hamas official in the last hour has told CNN that they still see problems. And that perhaps indicates here that Hamas is feeling the heat of the pressure of the negotiation on all sides likely are. Hamas is saying -- specifically on the issue of the freedom of movement for people displaced the south of Gaza to return to the north, they're saying this still appears to be, by the terms of what's proposed to them, Israel having control of the return of those people and in displacement camps, which would effectively mean this is not what Hamas is asking for, which is for people to have complete freedom.
 
They're saying that the ceasefire issue isn't readily and properly addressed for them yet. Although they are indicating that they're willing to go down the phased approach rather than lock-in a complete ceasefire at the beginning. And a phased approach, as well, they're hinting towards withdrawal of the IDF from Gaza.
 
But it's sticking, and we've been close before. It's hard to read the mood music at the moment. And perhaps best not to get ahead of ourselves too far at the moment, Wolf, but it's possible and it's in play. We'll see later this week.
 
BLITZER: We shall see. Standby. Ben Wedeman is in Beirut for us. Ben, what do we know about this latest strike in Lebanon?
 
BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, this strike was just too one of many that had been going on sort of on a daily basis. Hezbollah hitting Israel. Israel hitting Hezbollah. This commander the Israelis claimed to have killed, according to sources we have was not a senior commander. He was a third-tier commander, so to speak.
 
But certainly, nerves are on edge here in Lebanon after the IDF put out his statement talking about the readiness for the transition from defense to offense when it comes to Lebanon. And certainly, what we've seen in recent days are indications that perhaps the Israelis are, in a sense, preparing for the possible eventuality of full-scale hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah. They have canceled leaves for combat units. They've called up reserves for the air defenses. And certainly, the tensions have, it hasn't helped the fact that on last Monday, Israel did strike the Iranian consulate in Damascus, killing two senior members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.
 
So, added all together, it certainly does give a sense of unease to many people here in Lebanon that perhaps as the possibility of a truce in Gaza becomes somewhat closer to reality, that there is a very real threat that be -- in a sense -- that there's a real -- very real sense that the threat of war could now be coming to Lebanon, Wolf.
 
BLITZER: Yes, it's a real, real concern, indeed. All right. Ben Wedeman and Nic Robertson, guys, thank you very, very much. I want to get some analysis right now.
 
Joining us is David Sanger. He's a CNN political and national security analyst. He's also, of course, a correspondent for The New York Times. And an important note. He's also the author of an upcoming new book, a brand-new book that's coming out in a few days entitled, New Cold Wars. There you see the book cover right there.
 
All right, David, thanks very much for joining us. A lot of experts believe if Iran retaliates against Israel for that strike against an Iranian target in Damascus, Syria the other day, the most likely way that Iran would do it would be to tell their Hezbollah allies in southern Lebanon to start launching rockets and missiles and bombs at Haifa and Tel Aviv, elsewhere in Israel. Let Hezbollah do the work for Iran. What do you think?
 
DAVID SANGER, CNN POLITICAL &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Very possible that that's one way this could go. And wouldn't it be the ultimate irony, Wolf, if after six months, we finally had a day of not -- no active combat or very little active combat in Gaza if this then shifted to the north and to Lebanon and Hezbollah? A lot of this depends on how the Iranians react to that strike that killed seven of their -- of their commanders, including one very senior one.
 <br>[11:35:18]
 
One possibility is that they do what you described. Another possibility is they go after Israeli outposts outside of Israel. We don't think the Iranians would take the risk of attacking Israel directly. But, of course, that's one argument for a proxy doing it.
 
BLITZER: Because if the Iranians were to directly attack Israel, that would lead to a full-scale war between Israel and Iran. And the Iranians would pay a huge price -- Israel would as well, but the Israelis have the military advantage.
 
SANGER: That's right. But the chances the United States would then be sucked in are enormously high because of the American commitment to defend Israel. And that's always been the warning to the Iranians. Now, it's interesting that the U.S. signaled to the Iranian shortly after that attack on -- in Lebanon that killed the Iranian commander said he was -- 
 
BLITZER: In Damascus.
 
SANGER: In Damascus. I'm sorry. That they had nothing to do with. The U.S. was not aware of the timing, wasn't -- didn't have advance warning of the actual attack. That was a way of saying don't escalate this in ways that could bring the U.S. in.
 
BLITZER: Yes. It's a -- it's a really serious moment right now. For those of us who have covered the Middle East for a long time, this potentially could be the start of a huge war. That would be a disaster for everyone concerned.
 
SANGER: Well, you could see this tipping both ways. The good news is that if the Israeli withdrawal from the southern part of Gaza, actually turns into the key to unlocking these negotiations, getting some hospitals out, beginning to have a real conversation, that would be what everybody was looking for, for the past six months. If it is simply that the Israelis then move for war because of their attack from the north, then we're going to wonder what it is we've actually accomplished.
 
BLITZER: Yes. I'm really worried about this moment right now. I know you are as well.
 
SANGER: A very fraught one.
 
BLITZER: And I know US officials and Israeli officials are very worried as well. We'll see what happens. Let's hope for the best. All right, David, thank you -- 
 
SANGER: Thank you.
 
BLITZER: Very, very much. When we come back, we'll go live to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Thousands of people are gathering there now to witness the total solar eclipse. Stay with us. You're in the CNN NEWSROOM.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:42:12]
 
BLITZER: We are now less than two hours from the start of CNN's special coverage of today's total solar eclipse from Texas all the way down to Maine -- up to Maine. If the skies are clear, more than 32 million people will be able to see the moon entirely blocked the sun. Areas along the path of totality will go dark for a few minutes, about four minutes. It's a rare and extraordinary phenomenon that NASA says won't happen again over the United States for another 20 years.
 
I want to go to Indianapolis right now. CNN Anchors Brianna Keilar and Boris Sanchez. They're on the scene for us. You guys are in one of the best spots to see this moment. Brianna, describe the scene for our viewers.
 
BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN ANCHOR: So, many people coming in here. We're at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, which is a great place to see this. One, because it's an Indianapolis where the weather is amazing. And we're going to see everything. And also, because this is a giant venue that is going to have, Wolf, the biggest Eclipse viewing party as we understand it in the U.S.
 
BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN ANCHOR: Some 40,000 of our closest friends are going to be gathered here at the speedway with us to witness the Eclipse. And that's just a piece of what's happening around Indianapolis. As you pointed out, Wolf, this is one of the biggest and best areas in the zone of totality to see the Eclipse.
 
Some 100,000 people are going to be across town taking part in all sorts of events. A silent disco, paddleboarding on the river. It's one of a lot of areas in the zone of totality where CNN is going to have you covered during the Eclipse.
 
KEILAR: And, Wolf, weather is a big deal today because you see that totality, it goes over a lot of populated areas where, you know, technically speaking, people will be in that dark zone during that time. But if they don't have a clear view, they're not going to see all the amazing phenomena that these -- this show of the Moon and Sun are going to be displaying for us. So, Indianapolis has it, Vermont, a couple of other places but it may be dicey going through that zone, Wolf.
 
BLITZER: And you make a good point, Brianna, Indianapolis is in -- certainly the only city where people have traveled to see this happen. What other locations are expected to get a great view of this moment?
 
KEILAR: Yes. So many. We're starting all the way from Mexico when we do coverage starting here coming up at noon, Eastern all the way to 4:00, Mexico all the way through the U.S. going up through Canada, and we have some really fun stuff planned. That's right.
 
SANCHEZ: Absolutely. We have reporters not only in Mexico but in Texas as well. We have Pete Muntean who is going to be on a Solar Eclipse flight. He's going to be in the air as the Eclipse is totality. We're going to be live at a mass wedding in Arkansas.
 
There is a rumor, Wolf, that Miguel Marquez who's at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame today is going to be getting a tattoo live on CNN. We may have started that rumor and it just kind of encouraging him to try to do it.
 <br>[11:45:05]
 
KEILAR: That's right. We're going to be on a mountaintop. We're going to be also near your hometown, Wolf, of Buffalo. We have Harry Enten at Niagara Falls, and that's going to be kind of the coin flip.
 
Are people there going to be able to see this or not because of the weather? They'll definitely have that darkness, which is going to be amazing no matter what. But are they going to see the entire show? We don't know. That's kind of part of the allure of people coming out across the zone in totality, hoping to see it all.
 
BLITZER: And we're looking forward to your special coverage, Brianna Keilar and Boris Sanchez. We'll be watching it every step of the way. Thank you very, very much.
 
Still to come, the final event of March Madness. Perfect. South Carolina wins the NCAA Women's Basketball national championship and spoils Caitlin Clark's last college game. And tonight, coming up, Purdue takes on UConn for the men's championship. We'll have details. Stay with us. We'll be right back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:50:28]
 
BLITZER: Tonight is College Basketball's last game of the season and it's a final battle of number one seeds, UConn versus Purdue for the Men's National Championship. CNN sports analyst and USA Today columnist Christine Brennan is joining me right now. Christine, how do you see it playing out? Set the scene for us.
 
CHRISTINE BRENNAN, CNN SPORTS ANALYST: Well, certainly, it's -- we're all talking about the women's so much that oh yes, by the way, the men play too, right? And the -- and that this is the big one tonight. Purdue a team that has underachieved over the last few tournaments. Finally, getting to the championship game with Zack Edey and, of course, from the Big 10 against UConn.
 
We know the UConn women's program. Well, the men's program is pretty darn good, too, has won five national titles defending national champ, the favorite in this game. But if anyone I think, Wolf, who can give them a real run for their money, I would say it would be the Purdue Boilermakers. So, should be a good one tonight. And as you said, then the college season that we've talked so much about, of course, will be over.
 
BLITZER: Yes, we'll be watching that game for sure. On the women's side, South Carolina completed their undefeated season, as we all know last night with a win against Caitlin Clark's Iowa for the Women's Championship. What is the excitement around this tournament meant for this sport? It's been amazing.
 
BRENNAN: It has, Wolf. And I think it's going to change the way we look at women's basketball and women's sports forever. And it is because of this one person, 22-year-old Caitlin Clark. She has brought eyeballs and fans and T.V. ratings the likes of which we've never seen in women's sports. In a game that is of course you're so passionate about and the nation is, basketball, our -- one of our national games.
 
And so, I think it is so fascinating to see what has happened. We have seen kind of macho guys who wouldn't -- couldn't care less about women's sports, all of a sudden, you know, wishing they could have a ticket to watch her play as she Barnstorm the nation selling out arenas. It really reminded me of the 1999 Women's World Cup in terms of the way the nation fell in love with what we've created because of Title Nine. And I think Caitlin Clark is the individualized version of that 1999 teen that was so wildly popular.
 
And 25 years later, Title Nine -- the full blast of Title Nine that Caitlin Clark's generation got in terms of wanting our daughters and our nieces and our granddaughters and the girl next door to achieve sports the way their brothers have always gotten that encouragement. And look at what we have. It is an extraordinary moment I think, Wolf, not just in women's sports, or in sports, but in our culture, American culture in terms of what we are creating because of Title Nine.
 
BLITZER: Yes, I totally agree. I want to get your reaction, Christine, to something South Carolina's head coach Dawn Staley said about Caitlin Clark last night. Listen to this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DAWN STALEY, SOUTH CAROLINA HEAD COACH: I want to personally thank Caitlin Clark for lifting up our sport. Hush. She carried it. She carried a heavy load for our sport. And it just is not going to stop here on a collegiate tour. But when she is the number one pick in a WNBA draft, she's going to -- she's going to lift that league up.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BLITZER: So, what are you expecting, Christine, from Caitlin Clark at the next level? She clearly will be the number one draft pick in the WNBA.
 
BRENNAN: Wolf, Caitlin Clark is gone in terms of college basketball, and she'll be back in a week. I mean, talk about an opportunity to continue to have this superstar lead the way. The WNBA draft is a week from tonight. I'm sure it will have the highest T.V. ratings it's ever had as she goes to Indiana. And as we know, there's already incredible interest in the WNBA as well.
 
For example, the Las Vegas team, they play in the 12,000-seat arena. They've already moved their July game against Indiana to a 20,000-seat arena. And, of course, Caitlin Clark hasn't even been drafted yet by Indiana. BLITZER: Yes.
 
BRENNAN: That's what we're seeing. And I'm going to -- I guess we'll see a lot more of it. And also, credit to Dawn Staley, one of the great coaches, male or female in the country. Just an incredibly classy moment there.
 
BLITZER: We congratulate her to be sure. Will Caitlin Clark, Christine, play for the USA women's basketball team at the Olympic Games in France this summer?
 
BRENNAN: Wolf, she certainly should. And I'm recording that right now. We saw an undercurrent from some of the current players.
 <br>[11:55:01]
 
One of the reasons I think Dawn Staley spoke out as she did was because we heard some less-than-flattering things from some of the big names like Breanna Stewart and Diana Taurasi. And so, the question is, of course, she should be put on the team because she will bring fans and interest to a team that wins so much, Wolf. It's kind of a weird thing to say that they're almost too good for their own good.
 
But I've covered all these the Olympics and the women's basketball team gets really short shrift in terms of media attention. Caitlin Clark would change that and would bring eyeballs to all of them. And yet, there seems to be some resentment.
 
And I'm reporting that story. And it's truly stunning that they wouldn't welcome someone who would only lift the game. And, of course, any of our national governing bodies, USA Basketball is one of them, one of their key things in addition to wanting to win medals, which of course this U.S. women's team has not lost since 1992, but also to grow the game. And Caitlin Clark is the absolute essence of growing the game, which is why she should be on the U.S. Olympic team this summer.
 
BLITZER: Yes, absolutely. All right. Christine Brennan, thank you very, very much. And to our viewers, thanks very much for joining me here in the CNN NEWSROOM.
 
I'll be back at 6:00 p.m. Eastern in "THE SITUATION ROOM." Our special coverage of the total solar eclipse begins right after a very quick break.
