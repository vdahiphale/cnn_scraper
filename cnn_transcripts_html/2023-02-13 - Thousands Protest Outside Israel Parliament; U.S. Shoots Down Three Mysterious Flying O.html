BECKY ANDERSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: More than 170 hours later, survivors still being found under the rubble but the death toll in Turkey 
 
 and Syria now surpassing 36,000.
 
Protests in Jerusalem, thousands of Israelis take to the streets are unhappy with the prime minister's plan to overhaul the judiciary.
 
And what are they and where do they come from? Three mystery objects were shot out of the sky by American fighter jets in the last three days. More 
 
 on that is coming up.
 
I'm Becky Anderson. Hello and welcome to CONNECT THE WORLD. Live for you tonight from the World Government Summit here in Dubai. Leaders from across 
 
 the business and political world have gathered here to talk about trends in tech and A.I. and the future of our planet. Discussions that affect each 
 
 and every one of us.
 
The IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva telling CNN today that the global economy is still in a difficult time, there are more reasons to be 
 
 positive. More on that coming up.
 
First, our top story. Dire conditions, geopolitics and what many are calling miraculous rescues. That is the story on the ground after that 
 
 catastrophic earthquake in Turkey and Syria exactly a week ago today. But it is a horror story with heroes.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Here's what we know. Turkish state media say emergency crews have pulled at least 41 survivors from the rubble like this little boy who were 
 
 trapped for as long as five to six days. And this woman who emerged alive was trapped even longer for upwards of 175 hours in Hatay. That is one of 
 
 the worst hit parts of Turkey. Well, the death toll is still a growing nightmare with more than 36,000 people now confirmed dead. And as bad as 
 
 the situation is in Turkey it is much worse in Syria.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Death follows Syrians everywhere. The chilling words of a quake survivor in the northwest of the country where finding aid is still a 
 
 massive issue. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh brings us an inside look now at the mounting humanitarian crisis in a country already ravaged by years of war. 
 
 Take a look.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Baby Mohammed (ph) takes every little labored breath on his own. No mom, no dad 
 
 to hold his tiny hand. His parents didn't survive the earthquake. The three-month-old was rescued by neighbors who brought him to this ICU.
 
In the room next door, we find that Halia (ph), the 26-year-old will never walk again. The earthquake brought down her family's home and crushed her 
 
 back. Her stuck mom tells us Halia and her three children were under the rubble for 18 hours. The children survived but they don't know where they 
 
 are.
 
In every room of the Syrian hospital at bittersweet tale of survival. Many more should have been alive today to tell their stories. Doctors say they 
 
 tried to save them, but didn't have enough supplies to save everyone. The few medical facilities in rebel-held Syria are barely still standing after 
 
 years of Russian and Syrian regime bombardment that left them ill-equipped to deal with a disaster of this magnitude.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): We lost a lot of patience because of shortages and medical supplies. If we had them, we could have saved many 
 
 more lives.
 
KARADSHEH: This was the scene here last Monday and in other facilities run by the Syrian-American Medical Society.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is the biggest disaster we ever had. We dealt with war injuries but never had to deal with these many casualties at once.
 
KARADSHEH: The people of this devastated land cried for help, but no help came. Aid to rebel-held northwest Syria is tied in politics and at the 
 
 mercy of a regime so cruel even at a time like this. They dig and dig with their bare hands and whatever they can find desperately trying to reach 
 
 their loved ones. It's too late for rescues now. They just want to bury their dead. 
 
Muhammad (ph) is searching for relatives. Expressionless and numb. He tells us 21 of them including children.
 <br>[10:05:01]
 
Life here feels like one endless cycle of loss and grief. Most have been displaced time and time again by more than a decade of war. They're now 
 
 homeless once again.
 
We were sleeping under the trees, but it was so cold. We came here, Unsultan (ph) tells us. She begs the international community to send them 
 
 shelters. We just want a tent, she says. I wish we had died with everyone else so we don't go through this, she tells us. We survived only to live 
 
 this misery and agony. They have nowhere left to run. Millions are trapped in Idlib. It's the last rebel-held territory in Syria.
 
KARADSHEH (on camera): Mohammed (ph) says that she and her family fled Aleppo province and came here. She says they escaped the fighter jets and 
 
 the airstrikes. And she says we came here and the earthquake followed us. She says, death follow Syrians everywhere.
 
Seven hundred people lived in this now flattened residential complex, only a handful survived. Young men from nearby villages came running to help get 
 
 people out, she tells us. But what can they do? They tried digging. We heard people screaming, get us out, get us out. Then they went quiet. They 
 
 all died. Two days later, if they pulled a little boy and girl, their dead bodies were still warm.
 
Others made it after hours of this painstaking rescue. Little Ahmad (ph) was pulled out alive. 
 
The White Helmets heroes of serious war did all they can to save as many as they can. They urgently appealed for international support.
 
ISMAEL ABDALLAH, WHITE HELMETS VOLUNTEER: They didn't send anything. They didn't respond. They lit the people here down. And now the people here in 
 
 Syria already know that now they are forgotten.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON: And Jomana Karadsheh is with his live now not far from Syria in Adana in Turkey. Since you were in Idlib, there has been news of additional 
 
 U.N. help getting into Syria. What do we know at this point?
 
KARADSHEH: Well, Becky, there have been the movements. We saw a U.N. delivery taking place, you know the first, you know, more than they have 
 
 gotten in the past few weeks, delivered to northwestern Syria on Sunday. At least 10 trucks in the U.N. convoy across the border delivering things like 
 
 shelters and much needed relief supplies to the people there. And I can tell you, Becky and as you've seen in our report, that -- those supplies 
 
 couldn't get there soon enough.
 
But a lot of people in northwestern Syria would tell you that this is just too little too late. And even the U.N. is admitting failure here. We heard 
 
 from the U.N. Relief chief Martin Griffiths when he was at the border for that delivery, that he's saying that the people of Syria have the right to 
 
 feel that they have been abandoned because the international community has failed them. And now is the time to try and fix that as soon as possible.
 
I mean, they just need everything, Becky in there. It is unbelievable. Having a woman there sitting, holding her grandson and crying because she 
 
 just wants a tent because it is so cold right now. It's raining, it's snowing. All they want is simple things like tents and medical supplies for 
 
 their hospitals. And they're not getting that.
 
ANDERSON: Look, let's be quite clear about this. The victims of this earthquake in Syria, quite frankly, many will suggest our victims not only 
 
 of the quake but are hostages of the politics going on. The geopolitics in region. The United Nations has said it will move aid from what our 
 
 government-controlled regions in Syria to the country's rebel-held northwest. The tracks that you were alluding to are coming in through the 
 
 only crossing that is currently open between Turkey and Syria.
 
This aid that the U.N. is promising now will come up through what are known as these cross lines. And they promise that they will get this relief into 
 
 the hardest hit regions as fast as possible to "Martin Griffiths" who, as you rightly suggested, has conceded that the U.N. has failed the people of 
 
 northwest Syria. By as fast as possible. What exactly does that mean? What are the challenges on the ground?
 
KARADSHEH: Well, I mean, we've seen this in the past, Becky. Back in 2016 and 17 when you have had so many different areas of Syria that were 
 
 besieged by the regime forces and you had people trapped in these areas where there was a real threat to the population there of starvation where 
 
 they needed everything, including medical supplies.
 <br>[10:10:17]
 
And then you have these pledges that the aid organizations, the U.N. and others would work out a deal with the Syrian regime to make those 
 
 deliveries into these rebel-held areas of the time. And this is a regime that has been accused of, you know, trying to -- trying to beseech its own 
 
 people and to, you know, to get them to, you know, just give up. And we have seen in the past, all these aid deliveries getting delayed by so much 
 
 red tape and bureaucracy.
 
And some would say that this was being done on purpose by the regime at the time. So, I think a lot of people in northwestern Syria right now have very 
 
 little faith in any plans for deliveries to come through regime-controlled areas. We'll have to wait and see how that goes because we have seen this 
 
 all before, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Yes. And just to be clear, I mean, there is an enormous amount of aid that has been delivered via Damascus. The question is, how do you get 
 
 it from there, to the people who need it most. to the people that you have met to those families who oftentimes will have lost absolutely everything, 
 
 including many of their family members. Jomana, thank you.
 
The grief is unimaginable. And for those who have lost loved ones, sometimes their entire families a sense of utter hopelessness, remarkably, 
 
 there are glimmers of hope, hope and encouragement. Next hour, see our --a toddler in Turkey pulled from the rubble is inspiring people to carry on.
 
Well, CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta is with me now. Sanjay, moment of silence at the start of this World Government Summit 
 
 earlier on today here in Dubai to mark the victims of the quake. And many discussions ongoing amongst regional leaders here about how to further 
 
 support the victims of Syria and Turkey. We are a week into this disaster. And I was on the ground at the beginning of the week.
 
And it was -- it was heartbreaking to see the devastation, the impact on those who survived it. Heartwarming to see the odd rescue. But as the hours 
 
 go on, and we are now at that week's mark, how likely is it that we are going to get these glimmers of hope any longer?
 
DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: It is always so different disaster to disaster. You know, I mean, the thing about these is 
 
 that, you know, Haiti, Nepal, Pakistan, these are all different scenarios. A lot of it has to do with the climate as Jomana was just talking about. If 
 
 you look across the board, about 90 percent of people who are rescued, those rescues happen within the first 24 hours.
 
World Trade Center after 9/11, the last rescue was 27 hours. But you do hear as we've been hearing, you know, obviously out of this region, you 
 
 know, even close to seven days now, these rescues overall, the sort of average time to rescue after those first 28 hours is about 6.87 days, 
 
 roughly. So, we're sort of starting to get to that point. But it's dependent on the things you'd think it'd be dependent on.
 
Obviously, air, depending how trapped they are. Water, but also the shelter. And by that I would include the ambient weather and all that sort 
 
 of stuff. That obviously can make a huge difference. You were there, you see how cold it gets, that not only hampers the likelihood of survival, but 
 
 also hampers the rescue efforts. So, it's -- there's not a huge amount of data on this. It typically comes from other earthquakes but so many of 
 
 those can happen in different parts of the world.
 
ANDERSON: You make a very good point. I know that you are traveling to Turkey tomorrow. The health risks now for those who did survive cannot be 
 
 overstated. What are your biggest concerns and do you expect to find when you get there?
 
GUPTA: Well, we're going to be right at that that border crossing that Jomana was just talking about. So, what we're seeing is that there's 
 
 survivors who then have space and time before they can actually get to some sort of care, which is -- I mean, it's kind of mind boggling. You you'd 
 
 expect someone gets rescued, they're immediately going to get care. That's not necessarily happening here for all the reasons you were just talking 
 
 about.
 
So, people who've had significant orthopedic injuries, fractures, dislocations, things like that, just simply moving them now from point A to 
 
 point B is a challenge. So, we're going to see people who had these serious injuries and have now gone through this period of travel. There's also 
 
 going to be lots of other types of injuries including a type of injury known as a crush injury, which is what it sounds like someone who's 
 
 essentially been pinned underneath the rubble for a period of time.
 
And those can be really serious. We saw a lot of this in Haiti, you may remember at the time but the scenario is this.
 <br>[10:15:03]
 
Someone is trapped and what happens is you think well, we'll just take the rubble off, we'll untrap them, release them, but it's not always that easy. 
 
 When a limb is trapped, for example, it starts to build up toxins. And the part of the limb that has -- that has been underneath that rubble, 
 
 underneath that pressure. You take the rubble off, all those toxins can now enter the bloodstream.
 
So, you have to do this. I mean, the rescues are amazing. Sometimes they put I.V.s in. OK. I found someone, he's alive, I got to put an I.V. in now. 
 
 Slowly lift the pressure off, make sure they're not flooding their body with toxins. So, there's all these different ramifications beyond the 
 
 obvious. So, those are the sorts of things that we're seeing as well. These -- we're going to be with a group of doctors who are still -- sort of 
 
 creating a makeshift hospital here.
 
They've done this sort of work in other parts of the world. So, they know these challenges. They're preparing for those types of things. But that's 
 
 the sort of things they might see.
 
ANDERSON: I remember the earthquake in Muzaffarabad in Pakistan in mid 2000s. And the work that is done in some of these field hospitals is 
 
 absolutely remarkable. The UAE sending a field hospital out on the plane that we actually deployed on Monday night. I mean, it is remarkable how 
 
 quickly these operations are up and going. And the work that can be done. I know you've worked in these -- in these environments yourself. It's --
 
GUPTA: They can save lives. And still even at this point, there's lives to be saved.
 
ANDERSON: Thank you. It's always a pleasure.
 
GUPTA: Good to see you, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Thank you. 
 
GUPTA: Thank you.
 
ANDERSON: Well, massive crowds taken to the streets outside Israel's parliament to protest the prime minister's judicial reform plan. Even the 
 
 president warning, pose changes could send the country into social collapse. And I quote that.
 
Also, mystery in the skies over North America. Firstly, suspected Chinese spy balloon then three more unidentified objects. The military, U.S. 
 
 military is shutting down. What are they? What's going on? More on that after this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: Protesters converged on Israel's Parliament earlier on Monday. The crowd at times swelling to tens of thousands of people. Some waving 
 
 flags, others chanting shame. That issue a reform bill pitched by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government that would weaken the country's 
 
 judiciary system including allowing a simple majority in the Knesset to overturn Supreme Court rulings.
 
Well, some accusing Mr. Netanyahu of proposing the changes to try and hold his own corruption trial. CNN's Hadas Gold following the latest 
 
 developments from Jerusalem and she joins us now live. Despite these protests and despite an impassioned plea by President Isaac Herzog himself 
 
 not to start this legislative process. The coalition, Netanyahu's coalition does continue to forge ahead with this bill. Does that surprise anybody?
 <br>[10:20:03]
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT: I don't think it surprises anybody that they're forging ahead. This is something that they've been vowing to 
 
 do. And despite as you noted the plea is not only from the Israeli President but we've even recently heard from U.S. President Joe Biden 
 
 calling for a consensus to be built. I can't tell you how rare it is for U.S. president to intervene in sort of internal Israeli politics.
 
Now, things have wound down here, Becky, but earlier, there were tens of thousands. Some estimates go up as high as 100,000 came out to the streets 
 
 of Jerusalem on a work day. And the reason that they decided to come out here to protest in front of the Israeli parliament, the Knesset was because 
 
 today was the first time that these reforms were coming up in front of the committee hearing.
 
And even at the committee hearing itself, it got dramatic. The opposition lawmaker, some of them jumped over tables, were yelling shame at the 
 
 coalition members. And yet, of course, the bill with the majority -- with the majority that government has in that committee did pass through that 
 
 committee is likely going to get its first reading on Wednesday. And for the people who are out here in the streets, they really feel as though this 
 
 is their only option and to try to change the course of what they see as a potential destruction of Israeli democracy.
 
For many of the people out here, they see these reforms as weakening the independence of the judiciary. They see it as you noted, they claim that 
 
 it's a way for Benjamin Netanyahu to potentially get out of his corruption trial. And Benjamin Netanyahu, I should note, completely denies that. And 
 
 for many of them, they see this is the beginning of -- some of them are even saying the beginning of Israel turning into a place like Hungary even.
 
Very impassioned crowd out here. But they don't have these -- this point of view doesn't have the majority in the Israeli parliament. Benjamin 
 
 Netanyahu and his partners have a 64-seat majority, that 120-seat parliament. Now the question will be is whether they will come to that 
 
 table to have a consensus, have a conversation. The Israeli President Isaac Herzog making a very rare public televised address last night, warning that 
 
 the country is on course for a violent collision between these two sides.
 
And calling people to come together to come to a consensus saying, listen, both sides have valid points. Why don't we come together and talk about 
 
 some reforms that can be made? So far, we haven't gotten any indication that people are going to come together and have the consensus. There is 
 
 still time because this bill would need two -- would need three readings really before it could come into law.
 
But the big question will be whether people will actually come together and be able to have these reforms or whether we will see these divisions in 
 
 Israeli society only get even deeper. Becky?
 
ANDERSON: Hadas Gold is in Jerusalem for you. Well, U.S. government officials are working to get more information about another high-altitude 
 
 object shut down by the U.S. military on Sunday. The object was flying over Michigan before it was taken down over Lake Huron. Officials been tracking 
 
 the object for over a day after they picked up its signals over Montana until U.S. President Joe Biden gave the order to shoot it down.
 
But senior administration official tells CNN the object was shaped like an octagon, it had strings hanging off, but apparently no payload. This is now 
 
 the fourth object shutdown in North American airspace in the past week. Starting with that suspected Chinese spy balloon last weekend.
 
Well, China accusing the U.S. of flying spy balloons over its airspace. Beijing says it's preparing to shoot down an object fly near its eastern 
 
 coast. Listen to its foreign ministry.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
WANG WENBIN, CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESPERSON (through translator): It is also common for us balloons to illegally enter the airspace of other 
 
 countries. Since last year alone, U.S. high-altitude balloons have illegally flown over China's airspace more than 10 times without any 
 
 approval from relevant Chinese authorities. The first thing for the U.S. to do was to introspect itself and change its course instead of slandering 
 
 China and inciting confrontation.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: That's the version from Beijing. The White House took to Twitter to rebut the allegation saying any claim that the U.S. has flown its own 
 
 balloons over China is false. Well, for more on this, let's bring in CNN's Ivan Watson who joins us now live from Hong Kong. You've been assessing 
 
 this response and the perspective from Beijing in all of this, Ivan. What do you make of what we're hearing?
 
IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: We're seeing these accusations flying between Washington and Beijing. The two governments 
 
 accusing each other of running spy balloon programs that are violating sovereign airspace. Those accusations flying faster than the balloons 
 
 themselves, Becky. The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokespeople have not really explained more about that initial enormous Chinese balloon that flew 
 
 across much of the U.S. earlier this month and was shot down on February 4th off the coast of South Carolina.
 
Just saying that it was a weather balloon. And instead, when asked about this, they've kind of gone on the offensive and said, well hey, the U.S. is 
 
 flying spy balloons into our airspace and you heard the accusation there.
 <br>[10:25:06]
 
And that same official went on to accuse U.S. planes and warships of conducting reconnaissance close to China going on to say that some 64 times 
 
 in January alone in the South China Sea. He went on to call the U.S. the world's largest surveillance habitual offender and surveillance empire. So, 
 
 what we're seeing right now is that the detention -- that the tensions are escalating between Washington and Beijing.
 
Beijing has now or a state news outlet on Sunday went out and reported that Chinese officials had detected their own unidentified flying object 
 
 somewhere off the coast of Shandong province that they were preparing to shoot it down and urging the public to collect any debris from that to use 
 
 as evidence. We haven't heard any further information about the altitude it was operating at, where it was suspected of coming from or what it was 
 
 since Sunday.
 
But it just gets to the sense of alarm in both governments right now. They both seem to be staring at the skies looking for spy balloons, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Ivan Watson's in Hong Kong for you. Ivan, thank you.
 
In Turkey and Syria, the clock is ticking. Each hour lessens the chance of finding earthquake survivors. But incredible rescues are remarkably still 
 
 happening. One of those is up next and in the most -- in the midst of economic wildfires. how do developing nations rise from the ashes? The 
 
 chief of the International Finance Corporation will be joining me here at the World Government Summit in Dubai.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: Welcome back. I'm Becky Anderson in Dubai. You're watching a special edition of CONNECT THE WORLD live from the World Government Summit 
 
 here.
 
Now the death toll from the massive earthquake in Turkey in Syria now more than 36,000. Rescue crews still are finding more survivors. Here you see 
 
 them pulling a 13-year-old boy from the rubble. He was rescued 182 hours after the initial quake. And this nine-year-old boy was found in the ruins 
 
 of a collapsed building on Sunday.
 
Meanwhile, aid from other countries continues to arrive. Qatar says it will send 10,000 mobile homes to Syria and Turkey. The homes were originally 
 
 used during the World Cup in November and December last year.
 <br>[10:30:08]
 
Well, let's get you up to speed on some of the other stories that are on our radar right now. And we are seeing the start of a new Russian 
 
 offensive. That's what NATO's Secretary General said Monday, in response to reports that Russia is sending thousands of new troops to Ukraine. 
 
 Ukrainian military spokesman says they are seeing a record amount of artillery fire in the eastern part of the country.
 
Residence in New Zealand bracing for more torrential rain and heavy winds and cyclone Gabrielle moves across the North Island. Severe weather 
 
 warnings remain in place. Some 58,000 people have lost power in the storm while hundreds of flights have been canceled.
 
And award-winning Iranian filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof has been released from Iran's notorious Evin prison. Pro-democracy newspaper says he was 
 
 released on medical leave. The director has been jailed numerous times for making films that are critical of the government. Those are your news 
 
 headlines.
 
We are here at the World Government Summit in Dubai this week. Around me, gathered here mover shakers and decision makers shaping the future of our 
 
 planet. And one of the major themes of this year's meeting is economic resilience. These are not just buzzwords since the COVID-19 pandemic 
 
 gripped the world this time three years ago. We've had to hurdle unique challenges.
 
High inflation, the war in Ukraine contributing to the worst food crisis in a decade, energy price spikes obviously contributing to that inflation. 
 
 Total shutdowns and of course, a sharp economic slowdown. Take a listen to the World Trade Organization chief earlier today.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
NGOZI OKONJO-IWEALA, DIRECTOR GENERAL, WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION: There are crises that we're trying to deal with in the way of trade. We've got the 
 
 war in Ukraine, that is still going on. We got this earthquake in Turkey. We've got climate change and a lot of impact from those disasters in 
 
 different parts of the world. And the pandemic. Although it has abated, there's still some worries.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, that was the head of the WTA speaking to my colleague Richard Quest here earlier on. 
 
Helping nations recover and possibly even thrive in what is a hostile global economic environment is now a key priority for global organizations. 
 
 For example, the International Finance Corporation, IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, the private sector wing, the financing wing tries to 
 
 improve economic development through private sector funding. In fact, last year, it committed private companies and financial institutions to invest 
 
 nearly $33 billion in developing economies.
 
But with that enormous figure, there is an enormous caveat, even more needs to be done. That is an understatement.
 
Joining me now to discuss is the IFC's managing director Makhtar Diop. You and I spoke in front of the gathered audience here today. We had a really 
 
 good discussion about how critical it is that for emerging and developing countries who face such issues with climate crisis, for example, it is 
 
 critical to catalyze and get mobilize private sector financing. And that is something that you are doing.
 
I want to talk about that. Just before we do that, some of the challenges that we have just laid out are very specifically damaging to these emerging 
 
 and developing economies. Before we talk about how the -- how the work that you are doing in catalyzing private finance might help us reach a net zero 
 
 transition. Just how difficult are things for many of the poor nations in the world at this point?
 
MAKHTAR DIOP, MANAGING DIRECTOR, INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORPORATION: The biggest -- just think about countries which are not receiving enough for 
 
 indirect investment, because there were countries that the market didn't really present a risk properly. Now we have world into -- in the world we 
 
 have these food crises. And we have wars, which are local wars in some part of the world, or this is just confusing investors.
 
And those were on the bid to invest in emerging economies have been slowing down because of COVID. So, in that context, countries have been trying to 
 
 respond by having a counter cyclical policy, but it has increased the fiscal deficit. So, the debt is piling up and they now have to service a 
 
 debt at a -- at a time when interest rates are rising. So, what does that pose, a very important challenge to countries and there is no resolution 
 
 than to have the private sector investing to be able to sustain growth and being able to rebound it.
 <br>[10:35:06]
 
ANDERSON: It's just fascinating to see before COVID there was a, you know, a relatively consistent appetite and ambition for or interest in the 
 
 financing of projects by the private sector in emerging and developing economies. Load on to that but of course, as you suggest, you are seeing 
 
 that appetite decreasing. Load onto that, this effort to reach a net zero transition by 2050.
 
And by summit estimates, we need to see investment in the world economy to the tune of something like $9 trillion a year. And we realize just how 
 
 critical the mobilization of this private finance is. You have committed and helped sort of catalyze $33 billion last year. I know there's more to 
 
 come. This is a drop in the ocean when we talk about these trillions. What are the biggest challenges at this point?
 
DIOP: The biggest challenge is we don't have enough money to do risk investment. We are in the --
 
ANDERSON: What do you mean derisking investment?
 
DIOP: Derisking. Let's say you're a private investor, you are a fund manager, and you have to give a return to your investment. You know that is 
 
 -- it's important to invest in new technology in green hydrogen, in place which are remote but you're -- as a fund manager, you've got to dissolve in 
 
 order to have a certain return. So, what we are doing is that we are offering product to have a first loss which is taken by on our balance 
 
 sheet or using money that we've been able to receive from donors, we are doing -- giving guarantees.
 
And those are important element because it allows us to crowd in more investment. Let me give you an example of what I'm talking about. When we 
 
 get $1.00 of grant and be able to use this instrument, we are leveraging $10.00 on the capital market. So, this is a way we can really address this 
 
 big challenge that we are facing right now.
 
ANDERSON: Because the problem that you don't have is knowing that there are hundreds of trillions of dollars under private financial institution 
 
 management, you know, corporate assets. I mean, the money is out there. It's just getting that the ambition to spend it in the places that need it 
 
 most. Here, for example, what are you doing with the UAE? This is a good example of the sorts of work that you're talking about here. Catalyzing 
 
 this investment.
 
DIOP: Exactly. We just signed today an MOU with Abu Dhabi Development Fund for $1.5 billion. Were we working together and using our portfolio of 
 
 investment to mobilize our resources and bring it to scale what we are doing on the climate change? We also signed MOU with Masdar, which is still 
 
 one of the largest companies in the world investing in renewable energy. We have invested with -- in Uzbekistan, in Egypt. And we are looking at also 
 
 market in Africa.
 
So, now with this framework, we'll be able to simplify and accelerate and scale up what we are already been doing in those countries.
 
ANDERSON: The IFC cannot do this on its own.
 
DIOP: Yes.
 
ANDERSON: Of course, you are just one player. What you're talking about here is crowding this investment, the sort of catalyzing effort that you 
 
 can make is just part of this, isn't it? Because this is a drop in the ocean.
 
DIOP: Becky, our contribution goes beyond that. Because we are able to have a policy dialogue with governments to change the rule of the game. To make 
 
 it much friendlier to investor to investors. We are able to bring technical assistance to company. To understand better, how we need to be done to be 
 
 able to green the asset. We are able to sort of bring different parts of the world. We are -- we know the ecosystem on these emerging economies.
 
And for investors who don't know that ecosystem, we are -- working with us is of a great benefit. So, we have these two attributes which are very 
 
 important to be able to scale it up. But more importantly, now we are bringing other players which has a philanthropy. Philanthropy become a very 
 
 big player in the development world by giving the resource directly to projects and fundings some fully by grant.
 
What we're telling them is that instead of putting one $1 billion of direct financing in grant, if you give us these billion dollars, we be able to 
 
 multiply it by 10, being $10 billion, because we're leveraging that money. So, that was a conversation that we started in Glasgow, and we are seeing 
 
 more and more --

ANDERSON: This is fascinating because there is definitely some progress from project-by-project sort of ambition to this kind of wider scaled 
 
 ambition. We're still going to see more effort.
 
DIOP: Yes, yes.
 
ANDERSON: The effort still needs to be made. But it's good to see you here. And it's good to hear the discussions that you are having or at least in 
 
 principle, getting this momentum for change. Thank you very much indeed for joining us.
 
DIOP: Thank you so much, Becky. Thank you.
 
ANDERSON: Still to come. When you hear the name Kelce, what do you think winner or loser? Answers after this short break.

ANDERSON: Well, singer Rihanna had fun saying please don't stop the music with a stunning halftime show at the Super Bowl. Her high-flying 
 
 performance was the biggest step for the singer in years since stepping back to focus on family acting and her cosmetics line. Fans commented on 
 
 what they thought to be a baby bump and her reps tell CNN she is indeed pregnant with her second child.
 
And I know we started with Rihanna's a halftime show. But there was a reason she was there. The finals between the Kansas City Chiefs and the 
 
 Philadelphia Eagles. Eagles lost. This made it very hard for Donna Kelce whose sons were playing on opposite teams. Jason Kelce, you see him there 
 
 on the right obviously upset.
 
Amanda Davies joins me now. It's not easy being the mom of two sporting heroes, I
 
 guess.
 
AMANDA DAVIES, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR: No, whatever she fed her children growing up, it works, didn't it? I mean, both of them reaching the Super Bowl but 
 
 so often in sport, those half and half scarves and jerseys get -- given a tough rack, don't they? But in this example, you can absolutely understand 
 
 why. But it was the youth that triumphed over the experience. Travis taking the victory with the Chiefs.
 
But Becky, it's not all bad news because both of her sons had previously already won the Super Bowl. But it is Travis with the bragging rights now 
 
 over the family dining table. And we've got more from the Super Bowl being billed as perhaps the best Super Bowl ever in just a couple of minutes.
 
ANDERSON: Good stuff. And I'm glad you got the sartorial guidance tonight. I think we both look lovely in violet. Is that what it is? Move. Maybe. 
 
 World Sport is up after this. Yes, there you go, violet. World Sport after this short break. I'm back top of the hour for you. Stay with us.
