THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
<br>[08:30:00] 
 
AUDIE CORNISH, CNN ANCHOR: Hoped it wouldn't come to this. Now that you are here, does he plan to respond to this and abide by this ruling?
 
MARK REGEV, SENIOR ADVISER TO ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER: So, so far we haven't had a public comment from the prime minister. I think he's waiting for the right time to comment about this decision. As you said, it was eight justices against seven. It was a narrow decision, and it reflects -- I think there is a serious debate in Israeli society about this issue. 
 
But I can tell you what there is no debate about, and that is that this issue needs to be put aside and we have to now focus on winning this war against Hamas because the debate about judicial reform is a divisive factor. And this is not a time for divisive political issues. This is a time to focus on what needs to be done, dealing with this existential threat to Israel, Hamas. We have to end this terror enclave on our southern border. 
 
CORNISH: You know a member of Netanyahu's party, the former diplomacy - a former diplomacy minister, issued an apology over her role in this judicial overhaul bill. The reason why I'm bringing this up is because she connects it to the October 7th attacks. She says, quote, "I was one of those people that caused the state to be weakened, that harmed people. I created a split, I created a rift, and I created tension. And this tension brought weakness and this weakness, in many ways, brought massacre." 
 
Can you talk about this apology and whether you think it is time for this administration to start addressing these concerns? 
 
REGEV: So, it's clear that during the very, very forceful, vibrant polemics on both sides of the issue, things were said that would have better not have been said. And I think the debate was at times overly passionate. And one of the things that I think we learned on October 7th is that when Hamas stormed the border and they started massacring our people, they didn't ask us what is our position on judicial reform, they didn't ask us if we like or don't like the prime minister, they didn't ask us if we were left of center or right of center, they killed everyone randomly. And today fighting in Gaza, in the same tank, you'll have people who
 
 like the prime minister and who don't like the prime minister. You'll have people who support judicial reform and people who oppose judicial reform. 
 
But I think September 7th - sorry, October 7th showed us that we are facing external threats that really cast a shadow over any sort of internal debate over judicial reform. There will be a right time in the future, once this war is over, to go back and discuss the ins and outs of judicial reform. But at the moment, crucial that we focus on winning this war against Hamas. 
 
CORNISH: But do you think that Netanyahu has the public support he needs to pursue this conflict to its end? Meaning, there have been concerns, protests about his focus on the hostages. There is this judicial issue, which people do see as part of the existential conversation about government checks and balances and policy in Israel, and policy that is affecting Gaza. So, do you think that support will continue so that he can, as you said, finish this war? 
 
REGEV: So, it's actually very interesting because the goals that Netanyahu has articulated, the destruction of Hamas' military machine, the end of its rule in Gaza, bringing back all the hostages home, those goals are supported widely in Israel, across the political spectrum, from the left through to the right. On these issues, there is a strong national consensus in Israel. And, in fact, the government, since October 7th, has been expanded. One of the major center parties that was previously in opposition moved into the government because they wanted a broader coalition that was needed to fight this war. 
 
Now, once again, we have --
 
CORNISH: But that doesn't mean they haven't been without criticism, correct? And certainly the hostages family have become a potent political force in Israel because it's not the goal, it's the path to it, and whether they think Netanyahu is accomplishing that. 
 
REGEV: One hundred percent. In Israel we're a free country and people speak their minds. And, of course, when one talks about the hostage families, of course we listen to them because we can only sort of start to understand the pain that they're going through. Think about this for a moment, it's 80 plus days. Their loved ones have been in Gaza, held by Hamas. And we all know that sort of brutality, what horrific brutality Hamas is capable of. 
 
And added to that, the first group of hostages that were released after 50 some days in November, what we hear from them, I mean, I heard the chief psychiatrist of the children's hospital that was treating the children who came back, you know, there were two-year- olds, four-year-olds, six-year-olds, nine-year-olds that were taken hostage by Hamas, she talked about, this psychologist said they were forced to take psychiatric drugs, they were forced to watch their mothers being sexually abused by Hamas terrorists, they were forced to watch video of the Hamas massacre and of people being killed and behead and so forth. [08:35:12]
 
So, of course, one has to have empathy and support the hostage families. They are going through living hell. 
 
CORNISH: But to give an example of some frustrations, there's been some reporting that Hamas sent Israel a hostage proposal on Sunday. It was rejected. Why? 
 
REGEV: So, I mean, there's a lot of reporting out there that is, obviously, disinformation. I can assure you, and I know for a fact, that if there's a serious opportunity to release hostages, it will be taken. The government won't let it stand -- go away. We di it in November.
 
CORNISH: Are there specific terms you're looking for in order to accept? 
 
REGEV: Well, I can't negotiate here with you on CNN. I apologize. But we did it in November. We can do it in January. 
 
But one thing has to be clear, Hamas isn't going to suddenly release hostages because they have become humanitarians, yes. These are brutal, bloody, extreme terrorists. They will only release the hostages if they're under pressure. Joe Biden said, your president, that Hamas only understands pressure. And we're applying that pressure now. The Israeli military campaign is applying pressure on Hamas. That very same pressure can expedite, we believe, the release of hostages. 
 
CORNISH: Mark Regev, thank you for your time. 
 
REGEV: Thank you for having me. 
 
PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN ANCHOR: Well, a 17-year-old foreign exchange student has been found after he was the victim of what authorities describe as a cyber-kidnapping. The Chinese foreign exchange student was reported missing last week and was found alone in a tent in Utah.
 
CNN's David Culver is tracking this story for us. 
 
David, how were they able to find him? What is cyber-kidnapping? 
 
DAVID CULVER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Phil, this is really disturbing. 
 
Police say scammers manipulated and controlled this young exchange student, Kai Zhuang, for more than a week, threatening his family back in China and convincing the 17-year-old to leave his host family in Utah and go camp out alone in what you're seeing there, in the snow and in below freezing temperatures. 
 
Now, police in Riverdale City, Utah, they found Zhuang on Sunday. They say he was cold, he was scared but alive. With him, several cellphones. Now, that's how police say these virtual captors manipulate and controlled the teen, likely from thousands of miles away. They call this, as you noted, cyber-kidnapped. And they warn that these scammers are increasingly targeting foreign exchange students like Zhuang, threatening him and his loved ones back in China. 
 
Now, here's what Riverdale Police have to say. They say that these scammers "tell the victims to isolate themselves and they monitor them through Facetime calls and/or Skype. The cyber kidnappers convince the victim under duress to take photos of themselves that make it appear they are being held captive and send the photos to their parents." 
 
Now, back in China, Zhuang's family equally terrified. Of course, they can't reach their son. Reportedly they've been receiving ransom letters and ultimately they called police in Utah to report their son missing but not after transferring the equivalent of roughly $80,000 into Chinese bank accounts. 
 
Phil. Audie.
 
CORNISH: David, how unusual is this? 
 
CULVER: Yes, Audie, I mean in recent months, I mean this is what's interesting what's happened across China is police there are warning international students that the scammers are impersonating officials. And we've seen this in big cities like Shanghai and down in Guangyu (ph). And they're claiming, these scammers, that the students are under investigation. So that then scares them into wanting to comply. 
 
There have been similar cases, of course, targeting folks across the U.S. in recent years. We've reported on those. And the FBI is now warning that scammers are becoming more and more convincing. All of this, of course, thanks to technology. AI allowing some to more precisely impersonate the voices of loved ones. 
 
As for Zhuang, who you see there, when they found him on Sunday, guys, officers say he wanted two things. One is, he wanted to talk to his family, his mom and dad in China, make sure that they were OK, and he asked if he could have a warm cheeseburger. Of course, he got both of those. But, yes, it's terrifying to think that these scammers took advantage of the family being in different countries, different time zones and coercing them into handing over so much money. 
 
MATTINGLY: Yes. And Audie asked the critical question that's been ringing through my head, it's -- this is wild. 
 
David Culver, great reporting, as always, thank you. 
 
CULVER: Thanks, guys. 
 
CORNISH: Now, Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley take questions directly from Iowa voters in back-to-back events. The CNN Republican presidential town hall, moderated by Kaitlan Collins and Erin Burnett, air live Thursday night starting at 9:00 Eastern. 
 
MATTINGLY: Well, the migrant surge at the border breaking record numbers to end 2023. Congressman Tony Gonzales represents a district right on the border. He's going to join us next to discuss. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[08:43:39]
 
MATTINGLY: Over the weekend, several buses transporting migrants to New York City stopped at New Jersey train stations instead of going into New York City. this follows a new order by New York City Mayor Eric Adams requiring charter bus companies carrying migrants to New York City to provide drop off time and locations at least 32 hours in advance. 
 
This week House Speaker Mike Johnson and a number of House Republicans will be descending on Eagle Pass, Texas, where they'll be meeting with state and local officials as mayors across the country, from both parities, plead for action on the border crisis. December saw the largest migrant surge at the southern border in more than two decades. Preliminary data from the Homeland Security Department shows border authorities encountered more than 225,000 migrants in just the one month. 
 
Our next guest represents a large portion of the border in his district. Joining us now, Republican congressman from Texas, Tony Gonzales. He represents the state's 23rd District, which includes Eagle Pass. 
 
Congressman, I appreciate your time this morning. 
 
What do you want the speaker and your colleagues that are coming down to visit to take away from that visit as negotiations are ongoing for a bipartisan immigration deal? 
 
REP. TONY GONZALES (R-TX): Good morning. Thank you for having me. 
 
Today I will - I will host Speaker Johnson and I'm expecting at least 60 of my Republican colleagues in a two-day border trip, which starts today in San Antonio, where we will hear from Border Patrol's number two in charge and give us kind of an update on what's happening in the Del Rio sector, but also along the border. 
 <br>[08:45:02]
 
And then tomorrow we'll travel to Eagle Pass. We'll meet with people - we'll meet with sheriffs, we'll meet with judges, we'll meet with ranchers, we'll meet with commissioners, kind of on the ground folks seeing it every day. Mayors as well. We'll visit a couple of Border Patrol facilities. We'll meet with DPS. And my -- the goal is for House Republicans to be focused on solutions towards the border as we get in the '24 year and we start to get -- tackle some of these legislative priorities. 
 
MATTINGLY: House Republicans have and have passed their border legislation. You need 60 votes in the United States Senate where Democrats control the majority. Do you believe that members of your conference are willing to negotiate for less than HR-2, for something that gets those votes?
 
GONZALES: You know, I won't speak for my colleagues, but I will speak for myself. Having, you know, 4 percent% of the southern border, 800 -- over 800 miles, I spoke yesterday with a Republican senator. I spoke the day before with a Democratic senator. I'm literally working every single day to come up with real, tangible solutions. I think if the Senate can get to 60 in a meaningful way, that would send a powerful message that the House couldn't just set aside. 
 
But I -- be very clear, I mean there has to be meaningful border solutions. It can't be window dressing. So, I do think there's an opportunity to get something passed. And I think the American public demand it. You know, you're seeing the fentanyl crisis - you're seeing this crisis not only in New York City, in Chicago, in other places. It is starting to spread. And you wait until - you wait until -- this year, it is going to go to other cities as well.
 
MATTINGLY: Would you seek or have you gotten a commitment from Speaker Mike Johnson that if the Senate passes a bill with, as you point - point out, real, tangible solutions, it gets Republican and Democratic support, he will put it on the floor? 
 
GONZALES: I speak with Speaker Johnson literally weekly on this topic. It was the first conversation we had when he was running for speaker. And, you know what, him showing up to the border at the very beginning, the very first trip that he takes is very important. And I think that shows that House Republicans are committed to a border package that makes sense. I'd like to see my Democratic colleagues also show that level of support. 
 
But I mean we're - we're - we're a ways from getting to a framework and we're a ways to getting to more specifics on it. And the devil was always in the details. 
 
MATTINGLY: Yes, particularly on this issue, which is, I think, befuddled both parties for the better part of several decades. 
 
To that point, we heard the White House press secretary on last hour with my colleague Audie say that there had been some very productive conversations. She thought something could get done when she gets back - when lawmakers get back to Washington. But to your point, you've spoken to a Democratic senator, a Republican senator. Do you agree that there have been very productive conversations? 
 
GONZALES: I am - I am just always cautious because, you know, immigration and border security is such a lightning rod, a political lightening rod. And it's lucrative for both parties to just throw kind of fingers at one -- point fingers at one another and blame each other. But I do feel -- this is different. I do feel America is starting to be impacted far more than just communities like mine along the border. It's everywhere. And until there - until something changes, you're going to see more of the same. 
 
So, I do think there is an opportunity. I think - I do think you - you - you do have legitimate actors that want to solve this. But there are going to be a whole lot of people in Washington, as usual, that want nothing. You know. I call them do nothings. So, you've got to get the do nothings out of the way in order to tackle the problem. 
 
MATTINGLY: The Justice Department is starting to sue Texas Governor Greg Abbott over the state's new immigration law, which gives local law enforcement the power it arrest migrants. You were asked about this yesterday and kind of made the point, like, I'm looking towards tangible legislative solutions, not the - kind of the bath and forth between DOJ and the state of Texas. But I do -- the question I have, your district, I believe, is roughly 70 percent Hispanic. Are you concerned about what advocates have said that this could lead to profiling, that police could wrongfully go after people in your district because of how it's structured, because of lack of training? 
 
GONZALES: You know, we are in this really tough spot where people are tired and they're done with the chaos. They just want to get back to normal. And so you've got that element that you're dealing with. And then you've got the element of people, just want change. I mean we want real solutions. And so, you know, when the - when the governor comes out and says, I'm going to do x, y or z, people are welcome to it because there is no other option. You're not hearing things from the federal government. 
 
One of the things that I've been pushing for is the federal government to deport people that are here illegally. I've also been pushing for legal immigration and increasing, you know, immigration judges and getting those cases heard. These are all tangible solutions that I think, you know, enough with the finger-pointing. I'd like to see more real solution. But if you're having the local government having to enforce federal law, I think it's a bad idea. 
 <br>[08:50:05]
 
MATTINGLY: Do you think it will withstand constitutional scrutiny in the courts? 
 
GONZALES: I mean, who knows today. I mean it's - everything's turned upside down. It seems like every week there's another Supreme Court case that we're looking at to see how they're going to go. But, I don't know. I don't know how it's going to turn out. But I try not to look at that. I - you know, I've got my hands filled -- full in Washington trying to corral all the stray cats to get in line with a border security package that makes sense. So, I try to - I try to stay in that lane.
 
MATTINGLY: Congressman Tony Gonzales, a very busy week, a couple weeks, couple months of trying to corral the cats coming up ahead. Appreciate your time, sir, thank you. 
 
GONZALES: Thank you.
 
CORNISH: The college football national championship is set. Washington vs. Michigan. Big blue vs. purple rain. We'll break down the big game with Cari Champion, next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
MATTINGLY: And we are continuing to follow the breaking news out of Japan where a commercial airliner collided with a coast guard plane. You see on the right of your screen a press conference from Japan Airlines that is underway right now. 
 <br>[08:55:02]
 
We will keep you posted on any new details or news we learn out of that. Of course, on the left is the pictures we've been looking at throughout the course of the morning. That commercial airliner completely engulfed in flames. No one was killed that was on the commercial airliner. Five individuals were killed on the coast guard flight. The captain is still in the hospital. 
 
We'll keep you posted. 
 
CORNISH: Lastly, for the first time since 1997, the Michigan Wolverines are headed to the national championship. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Three Michigan tight ends in the ballgame. And handed to Corum again and makes the cut, first down, (INAUDIBLE) scores! Blake Corum puts Michigan on top in overtime. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CORNISH: Michigan's star running back, Blake Corum, with a touchdown in overtime to punch his team's ticket to the big game. The top seeded Michigan Wolverines' defense stopping Alabama on a critical fourth down play to secure a 27-20 comeback win over the Crimson Tide in the 110th Rose Bowl. 
 
MATTINGLY: The team up north, as we in Ohio colloquially refer to them as, will now square off against Washington in the national championship game next Monday after the Huskies survived a late scare to beat Texas 37-31 in the Sugar Bowl. Michael Penix was an absolute dog all night, throwing for 400 yards, three touchdowns. It was an insane performance. 
 
Joining us now to talk about all of it, CNN contributor and host of "The Cari Champion Show," Cari Champion.
 
Cari, let's start with why this is a really difficult morning for me. 
 
When -
 
CORNISH: Difficult for Cari. She actually hosted a show, you know?
 
MATTINGLY: Well, she also has to be awake after - can I ask, when S.C. was dominant, when - the Linert (ph) years and all that, is that what this feels like for me, like the pain that you had to feel watching that?
 
CARI CHAMPION, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: I - I thought of you and I said, this has to be awful. 
 
However, this is something I -- look, and forgive me for saying this, I was so surprised that Michigan was able to pull this off. This is just my honest opinion. Guys, I'm - let me explain this, Audie. I'm usually -- I feel like I can get it right. I did not pick either one of these teams to move on. I thought it was literally going to be Texas and Alabama. 
 
So, what that says is this. For Michigan, after all they have been through, I'll call that team in terms of story line the accused. Harbaugh served a three-game suspension for allegedly being involved in some sort of sign-stealing allegations, his entire team, and they still went undefeated. They came here. They were the underdogs. Everyone assumed Alabama and Saban, head coaches of all coaches, would win. And they showed up in such a big way. Their defense was other worldly. 
 
And then you have, on the other side, as we talked about, Washington and Texas. Everyone assumed Coach Sarkisian, who had another story, if you will, in terms of this fairy tale dream in coming back to win it all. Everyone thought that they would win in Texas because they had done so well and they beat Alabama. And here is Michael Penix Jr., here for Washington, arguably one of the biggest, brightest stars in college football, and they were so determined to win because they have been underrated, not talked about as much all season long. 
 
So, we have a national championship where we have the accused playing the underrated. And I think this is going to be great. I am so surprised, as I know you are, Phil. And I'm sorry. My condolences that Michigan is arguably in the biggest game of their lives. 
 
MATTINGLY: Oh, it's the absolute worst. 
 
CORNISH: Cari, can you permit me to nerd out for a second -
 
CHAMPION: Sure.
 
CORNISH: Because this is a season happening after the name, image, and likeness policy change. It means that being a big star now as a college athlete is something you can actually monetize, right, and your brand, et cetera.
 
CHAMPION: Yes.
 
CORNISH: How is this actually playing out for these teams? 
 
CHAMPION: You know, that's a really great question. I talk about NIL a lot because it's changing the face of the college sport. We are noticing that these players, especially if they are really, really wanted and coveted, they can make millions of dollars in maim, image and likeness. 
 
Now, it's a good thing because I have always thought that these players needed to be played. I felt - paid because the NCAA was always making so much money off of these athletes. 
 
However, it's becoming more and more like a business. And what we're going to see, and I'll just take a moment to talk about FSU for a second, you saw how that was such a horrible showing. These kids are like, there's no need to play. I'm going on to the NFL. My team's not playing well. I'll transfer and get more money elsewhere. We're seeing the business side. And it's the wild, wild west right now. And they need to really structure it. That's what's happening with name, image and likeness and these college players. 
 
MATTINGLY: It's - I'm desperate to do a ten-hour doc series on this story. Did you notice how I went from five hours to 10 hours just since the break.
 
CORNISH: I appreciate that. I appreciate that.
 
MATTINGLY: Cari, we've got - we've got to ask, what's the -- who are you picking to win? And is it UW (ph)?
 
CHAMPION: Well, let me talk for Audie for a second because I don't know if (INAUDIBLE). I don't - I don't know if I can come back on this show if I, in fact, pick Michigan. So, Audie, I'm going to tell you, I do believe that Michigan has been through so much, unfortunately, Phil, I'm sorry.
 <br>[09:00:02]
 
MATTINGLY: Of their own doing.
 
CHAMPION: Of their own doing.
 
MATTINGLY: They are not victims. 
 
CHAMPION: They aren't victims. But I will say this, they don't -- they really don't care. The goal and the message has always been, win all, win now. And they believe it. 
 
But I couldn't - actually, if I had to lean a certain way, I am - I am - I'm joking with you. If I had to lean a certain way, I'm going to go with Washington. Michael Penix Jr. is unbelievable. And I feel that their defense showed up in a huge way. And I think - I think it's going to be Washington. So, there you go. 
 
MATTINGLY: I love it. I love it. You're allowed back. 
 
CORNISH: Appreciate you, Cari.
 
MATTINGLY: Cari Champion, doing the absolute best. Thanks so much.
 
CORNISH: Best follow.
 
CHAMPION: Thanks.
 
MATTINGLY: And thank you all for joining us.
