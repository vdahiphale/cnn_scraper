CHRISTINA MACFARLANE, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome back to CNN NEWSROOM. Here are some of today's top stories. 
 
U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris will be campaigning today in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a key battleground state. Harris has now enough delegate endorsements to win the Democratic nomination for president, though nothing is official as of yet. 
 
President Joe Biden is expected to return to the White House this afternoon. He's been self-isolating at home in Delaware since testing positive for COVID-19 last week. The president has no public event scheduled for today. 
 
And the EU is moving its August meetings out of Budapest in protest over the Hungarian prime minister's stance on the war in Ukraine. Viktor Orban recently angered EU leaders by claiming the union as a pro-war policy.
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in Washington right now. On Monday evening, he met family members of hostages held in Gaza and vowed to bring their loved ones home. Netanyahu is scheduled to address a joint session of Congress on Wednesday.
 
Normally, Vice President Kamala Harris would preside over that session, but she declined to do so, citing scheduled travel. She's expected to meet him later this week.
 
MACFARLANE: Well, President Biden will meet Netanyahu on Thursday. The White House is unhappy with Netanyahu over the state of the war in Gaza, as well as ceasefire and hostage release negotiations.
 
FOSTER: And Nada is here with more on this. I mean, it's a rare honor, isn't it, making this address? How do you think Netanyahu is going to use it?
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Look, it is interesting. He has already appealed to both sides of the political aisle in the U.S., saying whoever takes leadership of the United States, Israel remains the United States' closest ally in the Middle East. So he has appealed to both sides.
 <br>[04:35:00]
 
He has traditionally had closer relations with the Republicans. And, of course, we have seen those tensions between President Biden and Netanyahu over recent weeks and months. And, of course, there has been that huge focus on the ongoing ceasefire negotiations and efforts to release all the hostages held captive in Gaza. There has been that back and forth.
 
We've heard Netanyahu publicly contradicting things that Biden has said, contradicting U.S. foreign policy goals even in the Gaza Strip. 
 
We did hear from Netanyahu yesterday. He met with family members and representatives of some of those hostages. And he said that the conditions to release those hostages to ensure that they are brought back are, in his words, ripe, that they are seeing some certain changes at this current point in time. So perhaps a message, a signal of hope there. We know that the State Department has said that they are close, but there are still issues which remain.
 
And we've heard that message time and time again. Those final sticking points are always very difficult, of course. But clearly, this will be an important week.
 
He is set to meet with Biden on Thursday. We know he has a meeting scheduled with Kamala Harris later in the week. And, of course, we'll be waiting to hear from other Democrats and Republicans as well in terms of their response to his address to Congress on Wednesday.
 
MACFARLANE: Yes, no doubt he's going to come under immense pressure for that ceasefire deal, especially in light of that devastating attack on Khan Younis yesterday. What more do we know about the casualty count and the fallout?
 
BASHIR: Well, look, we are seeing the casualty count rising still even today. The authorities in Gaza have said that now at least 81 people were killed as a result of airstrikes and artillery fire in the southern city of Khan Younis, at least 250 others injured. And what we've been hearing from the Israeli military now is that they are warning civilians in the eastern part of Khan Younis to evacuate, to relocate to what they've described as a readjusted humanitarian zone and in the Al-Mawasi coastal area.
 
Now, it's important to note that we've heard these evacuation orders before. The Al-Mawasi coastal area has previously in other forms been designated as a humanitarian safe zone. But we have seen airstrikes targeting this area. We have seen airstrikes targeting other so-called safe zones as well. 
 
So there is very little confidence from many civilians who are now being forced to flee again over their safety in this adjusted humanitarian zone. And, of course, for many civilians, this is not the first time they've been told to evacuate. They've had to move time and time again. Oftentimes, they have been targeted in the areas that they have fled to. So there is real concern there.
 
And as we continue to see the security situation in the south worsen, there is real concern for what that will mean for humanitarian organizations as well. The south, again, a vital gateway for aid. We've seen for weeks now obstructions in aid getting in through these areas.
 
But, of course, the situation is only worsening. The famine situation is only deepening. And that will certainly be a key focus as ceasefire talks continue.
 
MACFARLANE: Nada, thanks very much.
 
FOSTER: Days after a massive tech outage caused havoc around the world, some users are still struggling to get back to normal. Among them, Delta Airlines. The Atlanta-based carrier cancelled more than 1,000 flights on Monday, more than any other airline.
 
MACFARLANE: That's after a rough weekend that grounded thousands of flights around the world, leaving passengers struggling to find a way home.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't know how we could have prevented it, truthfully. I think it was just something happened and they weren't prepared for it. And we're just kind of, you know, the guinea pigs to something that was pretty catastrophic.
 
I'm going to get compensated for it because this is out of control. It's not -- it's not OK. So I want them to take responsibility, accountability and compensate us where we're due.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MACFARLANE: Delta says the CrowdStrike outage disrupted its crew scheduling software and it will take a few more days to get things back on track.
 
FOSTER: Britain's Prince George has turned 11 and, per tradition, his parents have released an official portrait to mark his birthday. Taken by the Princess of Wales, the black and white image was published on Kensington Palace's official social media channels with a message wishing the Prince a very happy birthday. 
 
I think there's always a bit of a story there. He's in a shirt and jacket, you know, a bit more sort of regal, formal, moving into that.
 
MACFARLANE: I just can't believe he's 11 already. I feel like he's my own child.
 
FOSTER: You realize how old you're getting.
 
MACFARLANE: Indeed. OK, ahead, worldwide reaction to Kamala Harris becoming the Democratic torchbearer in the race for the White House.
 
FOSTER: With the Olympic Games just days away -- see what we did there? Paris is gearing up for a massive security operation. A look at how officials are planning to keep Paris safe after this short break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
(Beyonce song "Freedom" performed)
 
FOSTER: Get used to that, Beyonce's song "Freedom." You'll be hearing a lot more of it. Kamala Harris has ramped up her presidential campaign of course.
 
MACFARLANE: Who better, Beyonce has given Harris the approval to use the song and Harris did just that in her first official visit to her campaign headquarters on Monday.

(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MACFARLANE: Strict clearance guidelines for her music but a source close to Harris says the pop star quickly granted her permission for the use of Freedom.
 
FOSTER: Beyonce's mother Tina Knowles endorsed Harris on Sunday, posting a picture of herself with Harris on Instagram calling her youthful, sharp and a great leader. I think that's interesting because she's got such a broad base, Beyonce, hasn't she?
 
MACFARLANE: Yes.
 
FOSTER: And just the idea of having her support is one thing.
 
MACFARLANE: And it appeals to the female ticket, as we know Harris is already trying to do.
 
FOSTER: Now less than two days after U.S. President Joe Biden bowed out of the race for the White House, his vice president is on the cusp of becoming the Democratic presidential nominee.
 
MACFARLANE: According to CNN estimates Kamala Harris already has enough delegate endorsements. They are non-binding but she's been backed by more than the 1,976 pledged delegates needed to win the nomination. Harris crossed that threshold after a wave of endorsements from one state delegations -- sorry from state delegations on Monday.
 
And we're getting some global reaction to the rise of Harris. The Kremlin spokesperson said it is too soon to assess her candidacy but noted that her past statements about Russia contained unfriendly rhetoric.
 
FOSTER: But she received praise from the German Chancellor Olaf Scholz who called Harris an experienced and competent politician. Also kind words from the Australian Prime Minister. Salma has been looking across it all.
 
It's difficult for these world leaders. They have to stay out of internal politics but they clearly have a view on who they prefer over the two candidates that have lined up now.
 
SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: And I think, look, it's a roller coaster ride, American politics, isn't it? 
 <br>[04:45:00]
 
I don't think anyone is going to count their eggs before they hatch. Yet another loophole in the 2024 race. And you have remember for world leaders, Kamala Harris is a relatively unknown entity. You heard that comment from Olaf Scholz, the German Chancellor, of course, describing her as experienced and competent.
 
So that's the hope among world leaders, is that she's a steady pair of hands, that she would continue Biden policies and that she would be a known entity in that way. But there's no guarantee that of course. Again, there's a huge foreign agenda that she has to deal with. And President Biden was a towering figure, of course, on the world stage, all of those many decades of experience. 
 
How is she going to pick up the Israel-Gaza conflict, for example? That's a very key one. We know Prime Minister Netanyahu is in DC this week. He's going to address Congress.
 
We know Harris is not going to be in attendance but she will have a one-on-one meeting with him. So already she's building her negotiating position on that key issue. 
 
Of course, the other one, NATO and Ukraine, where does she stand on that? The idea is that she would continue Biden's policy, continue pouring that support into Kyiv, continue bolstering NATO. But again, everyone is going to be waiting, listening, seeing if that's indeed her intention. 
 
She also brings a great deal of diversity to the office, of course. First Black woman, first female, first Asian American. What does that mean in terms of her outreach around the world? 
 
So I think for many world leaders, to be frank, there was a sort of acceptance that a Trump presidency was coming and a preparation for that. Now we have another question mark and another candidate for them to get to know.
 
MACFARLANE: Perhaps a degree of relief as well all round. Salma, thanks very much. 
 
Donald Trump will join the U.S. Open golf champion Bryson DeChambeau on his Break50 YouTube channel Tuesday. DeChambeau dropped the news about the taped episode Monday. 
 
Break50 is a challenge where DeChambeau and a guest try to score less than 50 from the shortest tee boxes over 18 holes. DeChambeau says he invited both Trump and Biden to play. 
 
He says, this is about golf, not politics. It's an incredible honor to be able to enjoy a round of golf with any sitting or former president. And all have an open invitation to join me any time. FOSTER: How does it not become about politics when you've got Trump? 
 
MACFARLANE: That's a strange comment to make.
 
FOSTER: Visitors to the Paris Olympics can take an iconic smell of France home with them. We'll explain why when we return.
 <br>[04:50:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: France pulling out all the stops to protect the Olympic Games. With just three days until the spotlight shines on Paris, the country's national terror alert remains at its highest level.
 
MACFARLANE: Meanwhile, roughly 45,000 police officers are expected to keep the opening ceremony secure. CNN's Melissa Bell has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MELISSA BELL, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Paris is taking no chances. Hopes of a spectacular Olympics stalked by fears of the worst.
 
BELL: Part of the problem for French authorities is the sheer ambition that lies at the heart of these Games. For the very first time, an Olympic opening ceremony is going to happen, not inside a stadium, but actually through the main city, on its main archery, on the Seine River itself.
 
BELL (voice-over): Despite a terror threat in France that's still at its highest level, some 320,000 people are expected to line the banks of the river over six kilometers to watch the biggest crowd ever to attend such an event in person.
 
GEN. ERIC CHASBEOUF, OLYMPIC GAMES MILITARY FORCES: We'll have more than 10,000 soldiers, more than 35,000 policemen. It will be completely secure.
 
BELL (voice-over): Street patrols leave regularly from the largest military camp erected in France since the end of World War II. And beyond the terror threat, there are also fears linked to crime, social unrest and cyber attacks.
 
NICOLAS NORMAN, PARIS DEPUTY MAYOR FOR SECURITY (through translator): There are lots of exercises, crises, simulations, sometimes quite extraordinary events, where everyone during an entire day tries to anticipate and then to manage them. And so today, we're ready and we're calm.
 
BELL (voice-over): The Olympic flame arrived in Paris to welcoming crowds, but nothing compared to what is to come. Officials say that some 10 to 15 million people are expected, far too many for human eyes only to watch. So AI has been brought in to help monitor CCTV.
 
MATTHIAS HOULLIER, CO-FOUNDER, WINTICS: The idea is to detect abnormal situations, like, for example, when there is intrusion of people on railways, when there is unattended item that could be suspicious package, etc. We detect them and then the operator gets notified in real time so that he can decide what should be done.
 
BELL (voice-over): An unprecedented security operation made up of police, military, foreign forces and even AI start-ups that officials hope has made Paris ready for anything.
 
Melissa Bell, CNN, Paris.

MACFARLANE: Back to the sport. LeBron James helped Team USA squeak by Germany 92-88 in the final tune-up game ahead of the Olympics.
 
FOSTER: The NBA legend dropped 11 of his 20 points in the fourth quarter. He also made some crucial defensive stops and steals. This will be his fourth Olympic appearance as USA men's basketball seeks a fifth straight gold medal this year.
 
MACFARLANE: Interestingly, LeBron has also been chosen to be the U.S. flag bearer for the Olympic ceremonies in the Paris Games. The Team USA posted a video showing the moment he had been selected.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: On behalf of the entire men's Olympic basketball team, we would like to nominate LeBron James to be the flag bearer for all of Team USA. He got that honor, so you get to wave the flag in Paris, my man.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: The Lakers superstar will be the first male basketball player to carry the flag for the U.S. He described the feeling of being honored to represent America at this particular time.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[04:55:00]
 
LEBRON JAMES, OLYMPIC BASKETBALL PLAYER: I understand it right now in a country that's so divided. I hope this moment and that moment will unite us or bring us together. I understand it right now in a country that's so divided.
 
I hope this moment and that moment will unite us or bring us together, even for those split seconds or those hours that we're traveling across that water in Paris. I will hold that responsibility with a lot of honor and just appreciate it once again. Thank you, man.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: You won't be able to miss him. They're a very high flag. MACFARLANE: Very true. I hadn't thought of that. I was just thinking no better person to carry the flag.
 
FOSTER: No, I would agree. 
 
Those visiting Paris for the Games can enjoy not just the sights, but also the smells of France. And they can even take some home with a scratch-and-sniff stamp showing the country's iconic bread, the baguette.
 
MACFARLANE: Now, we're told the stamps don't actually smell like baguettes, but more like the sweet bakery scents Paris is known for and that I personally love so much. The stamps were unveiled back in May for Saint Honore's Day, the patron saint of bakers. What do you think about that, Max?
 
FOSTER: I don't get that. Well, you could say it smells of baguette and it doesn't smell of a baguette. I think it's a bit of a get-out. They're thinking these baguettes are baguettes.
 
MACFARLANE: I would take a bakery smell any day of the week, frankly.
 
FOSTER: I was there recently, and it does strike me every time how you can go to a regular cafe in France and have amazing bread that you can never get in London. 
 
MACFARLANE: You do not get that in London. 
 
FOSTER: Unless you're a Michelin-starred restaurant.
 
MACFARLANE: The place we'll come to is Scratch and Sniff, I think. 
 
But anyway, thank you so much for joining us here on CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Christina Macfarlane.
 
FOSTER: I'm Max Foster. CNN "THIS MORNING" is up next after a quick break.
