MAX FOSTER, CNN ROYAL CORRESPONDENT: Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us from all around the world and to everyone streaming on CNN Max. I'm Max Foster.
 
Just ahead. A ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel is now in effect. But the big question now is, can it hold?
 
Reactions from Mexico, Canada and China to Donald Trump's proposed tariffs. How they could put the countries on a potential trade war footing with the U.S.?
 
And with tensions high in Pakistan's capital. The party of former Prime Minister Imran Khan calls off the mass protests, at least for now.
 
ANNOUNCER: Live from London. This is CNN NEWSROOM with Max Foster.
 
FOSTER: It is 9:00 in the morning right now in Beirut, Lebanon. Just five hours since the new ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah went into effect on the scene. The scene apparently calm after fighting ramped up more than a year ago now. This is what Beirut skyline looks like just 24 hours ago. This is -- as Israel bombarded the city in the hours leading up to the ceasefire deal. At least 25 people were killed across Lebanon on Tuesday.
 
Meanwhile, Hezbollah launched rockets at Israel that were intercepted. The Israeli government has vowed to respond against the Iran-backed group if the ceasefire is breached. A 2006 U.N. Security Council resolution is the basis of the ceasefire deal. Under the terms, Israel will gradually withdraw its forces over 60 days whilst Lebanon's army takes control of its border area with Israel to ensure Hezbollah does not rebuild infrastructure there. The U.S. and France will help enforce the deal.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I applaud the crazy decision made by the leaders of Lebanon and Israel to end the violence. It reminds us that peace is possible. Say that again, peace is possible. As long as that is the case, I will not for a single moment stop working to achieve it.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: Live now to Abu Dhabi, CNN's Paula Hancocks. I mean, all cease fire deals are slightly different, aren't they? So how will this one be defined and what could break it?
 
PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Max, this one is a 60-day ceasefire at this point. So, in theory, it is temporary. But what all sides hope is that that will form the basis then for a more lasting truce between the two sides. It has been welcomed. We have heard from the Lebanese prime minister that he welcomes the deal, also thanking the U.S. and France for being the two key countries that brokered this agreement.
 
And we've heard from the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who cleared this through his security cabinet in a 10 to one vote just before he announced it. And he said there were three reasons he decided this cease fire had to go through now. He said, one, he wants to focus on the Iranian threat. Secondly, he said that the military needs to regroup and rearm. And thirdly, he said that it will leave Hamas isolated in Gaza.
 
There has been internal disputes, though within Israel, we know the far-right elements of his coalition did not support this ceasefire. And we also know that some of the mayors of the towns in northern Israel are concerned that this was not the time to do this. Some calling it a surrender agreement and a disgrace on a national scale. So, there is not widespread agreement within Israel.
 
But what we have seen is that it is a ceasefire deal that is being put in place. 60 days. There will be this agreement and within that 60 days, Hezbollah has to move north of the Litany River. So about over 40 kilometers north of the border in some areas. And during that time, we also know that the Israeli military has to pull out of southern Lebanon. Now the Israeli military has said to residents of southern Lebanon, do not come home yet. We are still in place.
 
We are not leaving immediately. And what we heard from one U.S. senior administration official, is that the Israeli military doesn't want to leave and cause a vacuum that could be filled before the Lebanese military is able to really occupy that area and to monitor and patrol that area. 
 <br>[02:05:04]
 
We have those seen from Lebanese state media that many people are returning to southern Lebanon. They have shown cars building up traffic filled with families returning to see what is left of their homes. And we have seen that also in the eastern area of Beqaa. Max?
 
FOSTER: Still a very fragile situation, though. So much distrust on both sides. As you say, there will be, you know, Israeli military amongst Lebanese and there will be concern there are members of Hezbollah amongst that. And how do they deal with, you know, an unexpected situation which may flare up, but isn't, you know, profound, but may be seen as such and could affect the whole situation?
 
HANCOCKS: So, this was exactly why these negotiations were so tricky. We understand that Israel wanted to reserve the right to respond if it believed that Hezbollah was violating this ceasefire. Now, as we understand it, this is not a clause that has been written into this ceasefire deal itself. But we have heard from the U.S. side that there will be some kind of a monitoring mechanism, like an international committee which the U.S. and France will be part of if they believe there's a violation, they're the first port of call, and they will try and rectify it before Israel feels the need to go in militarily. Max?
 
FOSTER: Thank you so much. Paula Hancocks there for us in Abu Dhabi. Live now to Tel Aviv and Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute and a former Israeli lawmaker. Thank you so much for joining us. What is the atmosphere like there today?
 
YOHANAN PLESNER, PRESIDENT, ISRAEL DEMOCRACY INSTITUTE: Well, you know, after 14 months of war up in Israel's northern front, I think there's a sigh of relief and also anxiety. Relief because the Israel's northern border has been bombarded with a Hezbollah attack starting on October 8th. And now it seems like it's going to end. We have to hope that this ceasefire will hold, but also anxiety, because we know that in 2006 once we reached a ceasefire and an end of war agreement, Hezbollah use this time, obviously, with Iranian support to build divisions and divisions of a terror army targeting at Israel.
 
Both 200,000 rockets and the -- an army of Hezbollah operatives ready to raid Northern Israel. So, the big question, the litmus test, is whether Hezbollah will actually be marginalized within Lebanon by the Lebanese forces, by the Lebanese armies -- Lebanese army or whether Hezbollah will actually start to rearm with Iranian support? Israel will have to prevent it, and we might roll back to escalation.
 
FOSTER: Do you expect Israelis to return to their homes in northern Israel in the same way as we're seeing the Lebanese returning to their homes in southern Lebanon?
 
PLESNER: Well, over time, of course, but it will not happen in a day. Northern -- the sort of strip of dozens of communities in alongside the northern Israeli border. Many of those communities have been destroyed. So, one has to rebuild the homes, rebuild the public facilities. It will probably take about, you know, anywhere between a few months and a year. So, as long as the ceasefire will actually hold, we will see Israelis moving back to the north, but it will take time. 
 
It's not a matter of days. But yes, I think that the big picture here now is that Iran's -- probably the jewel in the crown, in Iran's proxies of terror that are deployed in the region. The jewel in the crown, which is Hezbollah, has been largely dismantled. And if we will be able to keep this reality as it is right now, at this point in time, I think it's good news for Lebanon, good news for the region. And also, good news for Israel that a big threat that has been threatening us has been removed off the table.
 
FOSTER: I can't remember the exact wording that the Prime Minister of Israel talked about pulling back, allowing Israel to focus instead on Iran. What do you think he meant by that?
 
PLESNER: Look, the violence in the region, there's one source and this is Iran. Iran supported Hamas with doctrine, with financing, with capabilities. Iran supported Hezbollah and very much encouraged it to open an attack on Israel and it supports other proxies in the region, and it also attacked Israel directly with a clear, explicit goal of annihilating the State of Israel and tilting the entire region in the direction of the jihadist forces.
 <br>[02:10:12]
 
So, anything that doesn't change deal with the Iranian motivation to tilt the entire region in its direction will not solve the root cause of the problem. So this -- and it's not only an Israeli challenge. It's a challenge of the moderates in the region, including the Gulf States and Saudi Arabia. It's a challenge of NATO and led by, obviously, the United States. And if that focus on Iran, will actually either change the regime or fundamentally change the motivations of the regime, we've really achieved something significant and I think this is what the Prime Minister was alluding to.
 
FOSTER: OK. Yohanan Plesner in Tel Aviv. Thank you so much for your insight today.
 
PLESNER: Thanks for having me.
 
FOSTER: U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has named several more picks for key roles in his new administration, including Jamieson Greer to be the next U.S. Trade Representative. He served as Chief of Staff to the Trade Representative in Trump's first term. It comes amid Trump's threats to impose a 25 percent tariff on products from Mexico and Canada on his first day in office.
 
He claims the move is in retaliation for illegal immigration, crime and drugs coming over the border. Mexico's president issued a statement saying neither threats nor tariffs will solve the issue of migration or drug consumption.
 
Claudia Sheinbaum now says that cooperation and shared understanding are key to addressing these problems. She also warned that one tariff will lead to another in response putting shared companies at risk.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CLAUDIA SHEINBAUM, PRESIDENT OF MEXICO (through translator): I am convinced that the economic frontier of North America, that the economic strength of North America lies in maintaining our commercial society so that we can continue to be more competitive against other economic blocs. I believe that dialog is the best path to understanding peace and prosperity for our nations.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
FOSTER: The Canadian Prime Minister also taking a diplomatic approach, Justin Trudeau said he and Trump recently spoke about some of the challenges they can tackle together.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JUSTINE TRUDEAU, PRIME MINISTER OF CANADA: The reality is we're going to continue to work constructively with the incoming administration to protect Canadian jobs, to protect Canadian growth, to take the responsible approach. That isn't steeped in partisanship, that pulls together the team Canada, approach that stands up for Canadians, instead of throwing their arms up and saying, all is broken, like the leader of the opposition.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GIFT: Well, the big fear is that back-and-forth tariff hikes will lead to an all-out trade war and consumers will pay the price.
 
CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich explains which goods could soon become much more expensive.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS AND POLITICS CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): A trade war is brewing.
 
DONALD TRUMP (R) PRESIDENTIAL-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're going to tariff the hell out of them.
 
YURKEVICH (voice-over): The casualty, the American consumer.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We're going to see higher prices.
 
YURKEVICH (voice-over): On his first day in office. President-elect Trump says he's putting a 25 percent tariff on all imports from Mexico and Canada. China will get hit with an additional 10 percent tax on top of existing tariffs. The reason Trump says incentive for these countries to stop the flow of migrants and illegal drugs coming into the U.S.
 
GENE SEROKA, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, PORT OF LOS ANGELES: I suspect we'll encounter some new headwinds that our industry will have to navigate.
 
YURKEVICH (voice-over): Mexico, Canada and China are the United States key trading partners. The U.S. imports, the majority of cars and car parts from Mexico. So, the price of your car could go up. Shares of the big three U.S. automakers all finished lowered with G.M. down nearly nine percent. America's top import from Canada is oil. The tariffs could send gas prices up 25 to 75 cents in some regions. And the U.S. imports a lot of electronics from China, in addition to sneakers, toys, sports equipment and furniture. For example, China makes a sneaker. A U.S. company buys it, pays the import tariff and then makes a choice, eat the cost, or pass it to you. Before the higher tariffs announced Monday night, Americans could expect to spend $2,600 more each year under Trump's original tariff proposal.
 
Inflation is expected to rise by one percent. U.S. retailers like Steve Madden are already moving production out of China to beat the tariffs and keep prices low for U.S. consumers so. Small businesses don't have that same option.
 
RYAN ZAGATA, PRESIDENT, BROOKLYN BICYCLE COMPANY: There isn't really an easy solution beyond passing that cost on to consumers. Small businesses are very much uniquely challenged. I don't have the option of calling up Jamie Dimon at J.P. Morgan to do a bond offering to build a factory.
 
YURKEVICH (voice-over): And then there are retaliatory tariffs, which could also impact U.S. businesses who export to other countries. Mexico's president hinted at that very notion, Tuesday.
 <br>[02:15:08]
 
One tariff will be followed by another in response and so on, until we put common businesses at risk.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
YURKEVICH: There are people that support President-elect Trump's tariffs, but mostly in his inner circle. Elon Musk says that tariffs are highly effective. Billionaire Bill Ackman says that tariffs can be used as a weapon to help achieve foreign policy, political and economic outcomes. And then there is Trump's pick for Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, who says that he supports targeted tariffs but thinks that excessive tariffs or blanket tariffs could actually hurt the economy.
 
Vanessa Yurkevich, CNN, New York.
 
FOSTER: Ron Brownstein, a CNN senior political analyst and a senior editor at The Atlantic. He joins us from Los Angeles. Thank you so much for joining us, Ron. I think a lot what a lot of people are confused by here is that Donald Trump promised to bring prices down during the election and this, by definition, will increase prices, which he'll be aware of, won't he? What do you think he's thinking?
 
RON BROWNSTEIN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, look, I mean, this was the tension all the way throughout. Because not only do economists, almost universally, with the exception, as the report noted, of people in his actual inner circle believe that tariffs will be passed on to us consumers and result in higher prices. But the mass deportation program, that is the other pillar really of his -- of his domestic agenda, is widely considered to be inflationary by reducing the labor force in key areas like construction and agriculture. So, you know, this was -- this was a challenge for the Harris campaign all the way throughout. I mean, you had analyses from Moody's and J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street firms consistently concluding that if Trump actually moved down the roads that he proposed, that prices would be more likely to go up than down in his presidency. And yet, for most voters, you know, the immediate comparison, their frame of reference was that prices were more affordable when Trump was president than when Biden was president.
 
It was hard to get them to look forward, not back. I think Trump, you know, believes that perhaps, that he can bluster and move these other countries in this direction without actually imposing these tariffs, but he is obviously taking an enormous risk, both with the domestic economy and with U.S. international relations.
 
FOSTER: See that would make more sense, wouldn't it? Looking back, you know, you can't always compare what he says and what he actually does. This could just be a negotiating tactic to get Mexico and Canada to secure those borders and they just need to show that they've done some of that, don't they? For this to be seen as a win for Trump and him backing down on the tariffs.
 
BROWNSTEIN: Well, you know, look, I mean, the tariff proposals in this campaign were more sweeping and more explicit than previously, 10 percent across the board, tariffs on all imports, up to 60 percent on China, you know. The three countries that he targeted here. As you know, Mexico, Canada and China are the three largest U.S. trading partners. We import over $1.3 trillion I believe, is the figure in 2023, of goods from these countries.
 
So, if in fact, he does go forward with these tariffs, you are talking about a major impact on American consumers on a lot of different fronts. Auto industry in particular but, you know, agricultural products, apparel, toys. People would feel this in a lot of different ways. And one other point about this that's worth noting. This is not the only threat he has made toward Mexico. It's not only an economic threat.
 
You know, explicitly and repeatedly during the campaign, he said he would pursue unilateral U.S. military action inside Mexico against the cartels, with or without approval from the Mexican government. And he also said he would use the U.S. Navy to, you know, to blockade Mexico to prevent the importation there of the precursors for fentanyl. So, there are a lot of different threats that he is, you know, kind of brandishing here already and it can lead to, I think, a very turbulent period. Might work out for him. Might just be a lot of choppy water ahead.
 
FOSTER: Can we use, you know, NAFTA as an example here, something that Donald Trump wanted to get rid of. Did get rid of, but it was replaced by something not dissimilar, if I can say that, but it did allow Donald Trump to be able to say, I did this.
 
BROWNSTEIN: Yes, right. So that's the question. Like, what, you know, what -- where will he declare victory? As I said, the threats on many fronts against Mexico and, you know, both military and economic were more explicit and repeated in this campaign. 
 <br>[02:20:00]
 
The threats against other trading partners on tariffs were more explicit and far reaching. I think, you know, Wall Street by and large is, you know, anticipating that this is kind of bluster and negotiating tactic and discounting the possibility. I think it's, you know, premature to assume that Donald Trump does not mean what he says. I mean, you know, the history in the U.S., the research for by academics is that presidential candidates try to do what they say when they get elected.
 
They don't always succeed in doing it. They get stopped them, sometimes by Congress, sometimes by the courts. But I think it is kind of over -- overly sanguine to assume that everything that Trump is kind of all the saber rattling is only that and that none of this can come to pass. You know, the Mexican president, you know, portrayed, I thought, in a very accurate way that, you know, much as in a, you know, a military conflict, an economic confrontation of this sort can get out of hand and both sides can get pulled to a place they don't really want to go.
 
FOSTER: Ron, as ever, thank you so much for your analysis.
 
BROWNSTEIN: Thanks for having me.
 
FOSTER: Just ahead. An attempt to deescalate tensions in Pakistan following the latest clashes between security forces and supporters of jailed for Prime Minister Imran Khan.
 
Plus. Russian President Vladimir Putin, is warning the West that it won't pay to arm Ukraine. The latest from Moscow just ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: The party of Pakistan's imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan says it's calling off protests demanding his release for the time being. The announcement comes with Pakistan security forces have been cracking down on protesters who breached the capital Islamabad, launching a late-night operation targeting thousands of Khan supporters.
 
Our Mike Valerio is following the latest developments from Seoul. Why the pause then in this, Mike?
 
MIKE VALERIO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Why the pause? Because they felt as though, according to our reporting on the ground, perhaps this wasn't going anywhere. Max, that's the best answer that we can marshal at this hour. There were negotiations that were ongoing when we wrapped up our news gathering last night between Imran Khan's party and the government of Prime Minister Sharif.
 
And there was no progress that was being made. So, as you alluded to, pause for now, and really, none of the protesters demands Max have been met. As we were talking about yesterday, there were three central demands, first and foremost, for Imran Khan, the former prime minister to be released. In addition to people whom the protesters deemed to be "political prisoners."
 
They also wanted a constitutional amendment repealed and they also wanted seats returned to them that they felt as though they won fair and square in February. So, none of those things happened. Really the question is, what is either of these -- what are these opposing parties going to do? Imran Khan's party and the government. 
 <br>[02:25:03]
 
His wife Bushra Bibi certainly marshaling a large force of support -- galvanizing supporters on convoys from the outskirts of Islamabad into the central business district and towards the outskirts of the park that rings Parliament that's in front of Parliament (INAUDIBLE) so we're going to see if she returns to party headquarters and what is next on the drawing board for Imran Khan's party.
 
Again, he is still in prison, facing 150 plus criminal cases. But we're also going to be looking in the next couple of days, what is happening with Prime Minister Sharif and his government. They certainly don't want this happening again. We're seeing internet service beginning to be restored throughout different quarters of Islamabad roads, clearing of protesters. This is certainly a significant challenge to his government that has been marshaled by these protesters.
 
So, we will be seeing what happens with the protesters' demands not met from this latest show of their dissatisfaction in some pretty dramatic pictures, Max.
 
FOSTER: Yes. Absolutely. Mike in Seoul, thank you so much for that update.
 
Germany investigating whether a deadly plane crash on Monday was the result of sabotage. A cargo plane flying from Leipzig to Lithuania crashed just before landing, killing one crew member. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz says the government can't be sure but "many bad forms of hybrid warfare are being seen in Germany." A Lithuanian official pushing back.
 
ARTURAS URBELLS, PROSECUTOR (through translator): Plane did not fall from the sky. It did not fall directly down. It's obvious that such a situation indicates that maybe some technical problems or interference were in the aircraft, maybe some neglect. As we investigate the circumstances, we might determine evidence of other criminal actions, and if we do, only then can we discuss investigation on other counts of the criminal code.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: The plane's black boxes have been recovered from the wreckage. But while a government spokesperson says they can't rule out terrorism, they also can't definitively say the case qualifies for it.
 
Russia warning the West that supplying weapons to Ukraine is a dangerous decision. This comes after Ukraine began using U.S.-made ATACMS missiles and British-French made Storm Shadow missiles to target military sites inside Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin saying that those, "reckless decisions" will not go unanswered. Frederik Pleitgen has the latest.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): Moscow for the first time acknowledging the effectiveness of Ukraine's use of us supplied missiles to hit targets inside Russia, admitting ATACMS struck a radar and an airfield showing photos of fragments they claim come from the American rockets. Kremlin- controlled T.V. ripping into U.S. and British officials lobbying to give Ukraine more firepower.
 
These same people are then sincerely outraged that Putin is preparing to strike an American Air Defense Base in Poland and not only there, the host says.
 
PLEITGEN (on camera): The Kremlin says it's trying to send a very clear message to the west. If the U.S. and its allies continue to give Ukraine longer distance weapons and allow Kyiv to fire those weapons deep inside Russian territory, the West is playing with fire.
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over): And that message is playing on repeat across Russia since Vladimir Putin ordered a strike against Ukraine with a new type of intermediate range ballistic missile called Oreshnik. State T.V. showing behind the scene's footage of Putin after a televised statement announcing a launch last week. The Russian leader saying, I think it's clear and understandable enough. And if it wasn't clear enough, a Russian lawmaker showed up to Parliament in a Putin t- shirt and the Oreshnik missile launching.
 
Oreshnik is the Russian word for hazelnut tree. The writing on the shirt means tough nut. Perhaps, after Oreshnik was put to work, they scratched their heads
 
 and understood that they need to listen and hear what our president says, the lawmaker says. He never throws words into the wind. He warns. With Ukraine's army on the back foot, struggling against overpowering Russian forces on several fronts, Moscow accuses the Biden administration of escalating the conflict in the final days before Donald Trump takes over.
 
The countries of the Western bloc are suffering a fiasco in the conflict in Ukraine, but at the same time, we believe they won't calm down, Russia's foreign spy chief says. They'll act as usual and will try to create chaos on the territories of our allied states and chaos in the Russian federation. And U.S. missiles fired at Russia, the Kremlin says, will make it harder for the incoming Trump administration to end the Ukraine war.
 <br>[02:30:07]
 
Frederik Pleitgen, CNN, Moscow.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN CO-ANCHOR OF "CNN NEWSROOM:  Still to come. U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken is expected to meet the Pope this hour. We'll have a live report from our correspondent.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER:  More now on our top story this hour. Right now, the 60-day ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon is in effect. But just a day ago, the skyline of Beirut was very different, filled with thick smoke as Israel says it hit the city 20 times in two minutes, would you believe? At least 25 people were killed by Israeli strikes across Lebanon. Displaced residents began returning to their homes in Southern Lebanon on Wednesday morning, although Lebanon's Army has urged them to delay their return.
 
The deal to end the year-long conflict calls for Israeli ground forces to withdraw from Lebanese territory. The deal also requires Lebanese government forces to regain control of an area currently held by Hezbollah. The U.S. and France will work with both sides to ensure the deal is enforced. The French president praised the deal.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
EMMANUEL MACRON, FRENCH PRESIDENT (through translator):  This agreement should not make us forget the war which continues to wage in Gaza, where France will continue its efforts for a cessation of hostilities, the freeing of the hostages and the large-scale arrival of humanitarian aid, and of course, a just and lasting political solution through two states. This agreement should also open the route towards a ceasefire, which has been needed for too long in the face of the incomparable suffering of the people of Gaza.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER:  U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken is in Italy, where he is expected to meet with the Pope this hour. He's been meeting with foreign ministers of G7 countries earlier this week amid the escalating conflict between Russia and Ukraine and wars in the Middle East. These international concerns will be up for discussion during Blinken's meeting with Pope Francis in Vatican City. Our Vatican Correspondent Christopher Lamb, joining us now with the latest. So, an opportunity to bookend the Biden Administration's relationship with the Vatican, but also to look ahead to the next one.
 
CHRISTOPHER LAMB, CNN VATICAN CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, that's right. I mean, Pope Francis is meeting with Secretary Blinken, a way for the Pope to continue to push for peace in the Middle East and in Ukraine, something he's been trying to do for a long time now, both with his meeting with world leaders and publicly.
 
Of course, there have been significant differences between the Biden Administration and the Pope on Ukraine and the Middle East, the Pope saying that Ukraine should negotiate peace deal. Even saying that Ukraine should have the courage of the white flag in an interview, and also saying that allegations of genocide should be investigated in Gaza. So some significant differences, but broadly speaking, Secretary Blinken and the Pope have agreement on some key issues and they're going to, I would say, have a good and productive discussion.
 <br>[02:35:00]
 
Of course, the Pope will be encouraged by the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. But obviously, it's a chance to say farewell from this Biden Administration, President Biden, second Catholic president had a warm rapport with Francis, but now moving into a more uncertain period with second Trump term.
 
FOSTER:  OK, Christopher, thank you very much indeed.
 
Much of the U.S., this Thanksgiving could be a wet one. Certainly wet in London today. When we come back, the weather conditions travelers can expect for the holiday weekend in the U.S.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER:  Mother Nature serving up some unappetizing conditions for parts of the U.S. this Thanksgiving. Our Meteorologist Elisa Raffa has the holiday forecast.
 
ELISA RAFFA, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  Well, we got rid of one travel headache for the Thanksgiving holiday week, but the other one is already starting to brew. For Wednesday, your travel delays continue to work their way east. We'll find some possible hiccups over parts of the central plains, getting into the Tennessee Valley, as our next potent storm continues to develop. We got rid of one from Tuesday. 
 
Again, here comes the next one where we could have some rain and snow impacting the Rockies, parts of the Midwest. And then by Thursday, this thing really flourishes and explodes with some rain and snow up in the northeast. Could have a couple of inches of snow for parts of interior New England and then that range stretches from New York down to D.C., Charlotte, Atlanta, even down towards New Orleans. Much of the southeast will have a pretty soggy Thanksgiving. Then after that, it gets cold, high pressure comes in and temperatures will start to nose dive by Black Friday. So your travel forecast again, we'll have some hiccups across the Rockies with some of that snow as that storm develops across parts of the Midwest. And by Thursday, really shifts to some of those big cities along the East Coast from New York, D.C., Atlanta, down to New Orleans with rain and snow impacting travel. We could find some hiccups at airports on Thursday. If you're doing any last-minute traveling by Thursday morning, things will be wet along that I-95 corridor. And then by Friday, you'll find some snow really impacting parts of the New England area where we'll have a couple of inches of snow possible in Maine.
 
So, it's a soggy go for your Turkey day, rain for that Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. We'll find the shower stretching down the East Coast, and it gets really chilly behind this front, some of the coldest temperatures of the year so far. That cold air coupled in with the rain will leave temperatures stuck in the 40s during that Parade in New York City on Thanksgiving Day.
 
FOSTER:  Elisa, thank you. And the traditional Thanksgiving feasts may be a bit cheaper this year for those celebrating the holiday. The cost of a classic Thanksgiving meal for 10 people has dropped to just over $58. That's down 5 percent from last year, but the feast is still more expensive than before the COVID pandemic.
 <br>[02:40:00]
 
The American Farm Bureau Federation says 16-pound turkeys, pumpkin pie mix, frozen pie crusts, frozen peas, and whole milk have all got cheaper this year. But not everything is cheaper. Cranberries and dinner rolls are more expensive than last year.
 
Calling all adrenaline junkies, meanwhile, if heights give you the frights, look away now. China's newest tourist attraction has just opened in Hunan province. It's called the Sky Ladder, which stretches between two cliffs 5,000 feet up, and that's a dizzying kilometer-and- a-half up in the air. We can't even see it at this point, so you don't know what I'm talking about. But for comparison, Dubai's Burj Khalifa is only about half as tall. In terms of protection, you do get hand rails, a harness and two carabiners to attach you to the Ladder. A strong stomach and knees aren't included though. It's pretty terrifying. And when we bring you the pictures, you'll see exactly why.
 
Meanwhile, for the first time in more than 50 years, a painting by British artist George Stubbs is up for auction and it's expected to sell for up to $2.5 million. The "Spanish pointer" considered one of the artist's most famous works, has been in a private collection. Now, the painting is on display to the public at Sotheby's in London until early December, if you want to have a look. After that, it may not be seen again for decades depending on who buys it.
 
But this is an emoji we're likely all to be familiar with in the time coming forward. But you can spot the same design in this video here, possibly? According to the sculptors of this installation on England's South Coast, the wicker shelter is meant to be in the shape of a sea snail's shell. However, the design has been the target of national and social media reports that have compared it to the unsavory emoji. Local bird watchers and dog walkers can't make their minds up about the structure. To flush away any confusion, one of the sculptors has defended the creation for you.

MARK ANTONY HADEN FORD, ENVIRONMENTAL ARTIST, TWO CIRCLES DESIGN:  We, as artists, we don't court controversy at all. This was intended to be a periwinkle from the very start. Now, I love the fact that people can interpret art in very different ways and the fact that some people think it's not a periwinkle and it could be a poop emoji. Well, that's up to you to make your decision.
