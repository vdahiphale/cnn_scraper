COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. Happy Friday, Friyay. Tomorrow is the first official day of fall. The Autumn Equinox. The Equinox 
 
 happens once in the fall and once in the spring. And it marks the only days where there is nearly the same amount of daylight and darkness at all 
 
 latitudes.
 
I`m Coy. This is CNN 10. And on this penultimate day of fall let`s tackle today`s headlines. We start with a troubling new study out of Stanford 
 
 University, where researchers found that wildfire smoke is undoing progress toward cleaner air across America. Air pollution from wildfire smoke can 
 
 spread for miles like this summer when smoke from Canada drifted into the U.S. turning skies in New York City, yellow.
 
And wildfire smoke is a type of particle pollution or PM2.5 because the particulates are so tiny. They can sneak past our body`s natural defenses 
 
 and get into our system. If they get into your lungs and bloodstream, they could trigger asthma attacks or even heart attacks in some people. And 
 
 long-term exposure can lead to deadly diseases taking months or even years off of your life. 
 
PM2.5 had become less concentrated in recent decades. Thanks to air quality improvement measures. But this new study shows that progress has been 
 
 slowed or even reversed in 35 states because of wildfire smoke. Here`s CNN`s Chief Medical Correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta with more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Look around you, take a breath. What do you notice? It`s hard to imagine, but even air that looks 
 
 and feels clean could still be harmful. Air pollution is when anything chemical, physical or biological changes the atmosphere. 
 
Now, the main culprit of air pollution has long been fossil fuels, but wildfires like the ones that we`ve been seeing a lot of lately are 
 
 increasingly impacting our air quality. In fact, as things stand now, according to the World Health Organization, nearly all of us breathe air 
 
 that is polluted. 
 
What you might notice again, even if the air seems OK, our symptoms like eye, nose or throat irritation, wheezing, coughing, headaches, fatigue, 
 
 dizziness, and one type of air pollution called particle pollution or PM2.5 can be especially dangerous. And that`s because of how tiny the particles 
 
 are. These particles can be 1/20th, the width of a human hair, which means they can travel past your body`s usual defenses. 
 
Now, I know you hear this and a lot of this might worry you, but there are also ways that you can protect yourself. First of all, just like you might 
 
 check the weather before you leave the house, you should also check your air quality. 
 
In fact, many countries now have tools where they monitor the air quality index, something known as AQI. The United Nations also has a live air 
 
 pollution exposure calculator. So when the air quality is bad, you know that you should start staying indoors if you can. If you do have to go 
 
 outside, try to do activities where you`re not breathing as hard, go for a walk instead of a run. The extra careful when it`s hot, outside is higher 
 
 temperatures can increase particle pollution, but the big picture for all of us pay attention to the air around you.

GRADY JARRETT, ATLANTA FALCONS:  Yes, sir. 
 
WIRE:  With our CNN 10 family today, sharing some tips and tactics for achieving success in life. What inspires you, Grady? What motivates you?
 
JARRETT:  Man, really, you know, especially at this point, man, just being the best I can be, you know, and then that`s whatever aspect, anything I 
 
 decide to get involved in. I want to be the best that I can be. And I feel like if I`m the best that I can be. I can be one of the best to do it. So I 
 
 mean, as a player, you know, going out emptying to take every day, putting into work, whether it`s physical, mental, you know, on the recovery side of 
 
 things, just doing the things that`s -- when it`s time to go, I`m ready to go.
 
WIRE:  Now things in life rarely go straight. 
 
JARRETT:  Yeah. 
 
WIRE:  How important do you think adversity is? 
 
JARRETT:  Mm-hmm.
 
WIRE:  In shaping us as people?
 
JARRETT:  Man, adversity is inevitable. You know, it`s going to come, but it`s how you handle it, you know? When things get hard that shows your true 
 
 character, you know, it`s easy for you to be excited when things are going your way. When you know the outcome is going to be good and your favor, you 
 
 just got to be ready for when adversity comes and to keep conquering and keep conquering. That`s what life about.

JARRETT:  Yeah. 
 
WIRE:  Maybe facing a setback, an injury, a big loss. 
 
JARRETT:  Mm-hmm.
 
WIRE:  What advice would you have for them?
 
JARRETT:  At the end of the day, all you can do is control where you`re at right now and give your best foot forward every day. You know what I`m 
 
 saying? So when you do overcome whatever you`re going through, whether it`s an injury and you miss some time, now you back on the field. Now you can 
 
 appreciate them hard days when they come and you don`t take it for granted because you know what it`s like to not have. 
 
I think sometimes people, we`re so hard on ourself like thinking, you know, we should always feel happy. It`s always feel happy. Always supposed to be 
 
 good, but it`s OK to be, you know, down sometimes, sad. Like that`ll make you a weak person that don`t make or like it`s something wrong with you or 
 
 something like that. Like you`re human. 
 
But at the end of the day, those time makes our higher times better, you know? Because you got to know like, you know, pain is inevitable. Things 
 
 not going your way is inevitable. But it`s always about how you react to it and overcome it. You know, you got to have that undeniable unstoppable 
 
 mindset.

JARRETT:  Yeah, you always see everybody highlights.
 
WIRE:  Look and feel happy all the time. 
 
JARRETT:  Mm-hmm.
 
WIRE:  That`s not real life. 
 
JARRETT:  Yeah. It`s not real life. And that`s OK that it`s not real life. You know what I`m saying, is I think when you look at it, like it`s OK not 
 
 for everything to be OK. 
 
WIRE:  Yeah.
 
JARRETT:  You know? And then you won`t be as hard as yourself or like feeling like, you know, maybe you`ll get so far left behind in life doing 
 
 certain things or you got to run -- you got to run your race at -- at your pace. 
 
WIRE:  Now for those folks out there who are striving to be great, is there a motto or mantra that you`ve learned along the way that helps drive you 
 
 towards your full potential?
 
JARRETT:  I want to do what I can while I can. So when I cannot, I will not wish I would have when I could have. And all that mean to me is just don`t 
 
 have any regrets.
 
WIRE:  All right. One big lesson, I`m reminded of by Grady is no matter how famous or successful you get, stay humble, stay hungry, never get too big 
 
 for your britches. Keep shining Grady. Thanks for spending time with our CNN 10 tribe today. I`m Coy Wire.

 move it. Look at him, go leading police on a chase in Springfield, Missouri. It was probably thinking lemur alone, dudes. I`m finally free. 
 
 Its owners reported that it escaped. And with the help of two bystanders and a towel, the cops finally caught the ring-tailed runaway, no problem 
 
 lemur. They turned it over to a wildlife rescue agency. A real-life lemurgency averted.
