JAKE TAPPER, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST: She stopped a munch on some grass. And the circus folk caught up, loaded her onto a trailer and took her back to 
 
 the show. No harm done apparently.
 
You can follow the show on X, @theleadcnn. If you ever miss an episode of "The Lead," you can listen to the show whence you get your podcasts. The 
 
 news continues on CNN with Wolf Blitzer right next door in a place I like to call "The Situation Room." See you tomorrow.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST: It's 6:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, 8:00 a.m. in Sydney, and 6:00 p.m. here in New York. I'm Julia Chatterley. And 
 
 wherever you are in the world, this is your "First Move."
 
A warm welcome once again to "First Move." And here's today's need to know. Israel will make its own decisions. Prime Minister Netanyahu's response to 
 
 calls for restraint against Iran.
 
A criminal cover-up. That's how a former manager described Boeing's handling of the Alaska Airlines flight that suffered a door plug blowout 
 
 back in January.
 
U.S. President Joe Biden calling for a tripling of tariffs on Chinese steel.
 
And -- 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CROWD: Five, six, seven, eight. Rumor, rumor, rumor, rumor. (INAUDIBLE). Rumor, rumor, rumor, rumor.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHATTERLEY: -- it's not a rumor, it's real. Cantopop boyband, Mirror, reflecting on their music, their New York tour and of course, who's single 
 
 and who's not. That conversation and plenty more coming up.
 
But first, a diplomatic flurry in the Middle East and Israel weighs its response to Iran's airstrikes. The British and German foreign ministers 
 
 travelled to Israel on Wednesday to call for restraint. This after meeting with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said his country will 
 
 make its own decisions.
 
Meanwhile, a new poll suggests that the Israeli public has a clear preference. Nearly three out of four respondents said that they would 
 
 oppose retaliatory strikes if it undermines Israel's security alliances. Nic Robertson has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over): As protesters in Tel Aviv were trying to unseat Israel's prime minister 
 
 Saturday, demanding he stop the war in Gaza, allow the release of hostages, Iran was launching attack drones towards them. The two things are not 
 
 disconnected.
 
Iran appears to think Benjamin Netanyahu is vulnerable, unpopular at home, increasingly alienated from his ironclad ally, America.
 
GERSHON BASKIN, FORMER HOSTAGE NEGOTIATOR: He has created so much damage to our society. The sacrificing of hostages is the kind of harm that will take 
 
 a generation or more for Israeli society to heal from.
 
ROBERTSON (voice-over): Gershon Baskin negotiated Israel's last major hostage deal with Hamas, the release of IDF soldier, Gilad Shalit, in 2011. 
 
 He fears Netanyahu isn't negotiating in good faith.
 
BASKIN: He wants to prolong the war because he knows on the day that this war is over, the commission of inquiry headed by a Supreme Court judge will 
 
 be formed that will hold him responsible for what happened on October 7th and for what led up to October 7th.
 
ROBERTSON (voice-over): The hostage issue is just one of many pulling the country apart. The prime minister says there will be an inquiry once the 
 
 war is over.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Prime Minister Netanyahu, you have to be strong.
 
ROBERTSON (voice-over): At pro government rallies, attitudes are uncompromising, risking alienation with America by shunning U.S. demands.
 
ROBERTSON: But they're saying 33,000 Palestinians is too many to be killed.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We want 5,000 -- 100,000 people to burn.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Look, in World War II there was an attack, there was Hiroshima, but America wanted to win the war.
 
ROBERTSON: They're calling here for more people to come out on the street and support the prime minister, telling him to be strong. But the reality, 
 
 according to independent polling here, is that only 52 percent of the people believe the prime minister can bring the hostages home. This is a 
 
 divided country.
 
ROBERTSON (voice-over): Six months after Hamas' brutal attack, the Nova Music Festival site, where more than 350 people were slaughtered by the 
 
 terror group, has become a memorial.
 
Orna Kadmon, whose brother was killed, came back. Says she feels the loss more now.
 
ORNA KADMON, BROTHER KILLED ON OCTOBER 7: There is one solution, very clear, very simple, but it's not politically correct.
 
ROBERTSON: What's your solution?
 
KADMON: Airforce, clean all Gaza.
 <br>[18:05:00]
 
ROBERTSON: This is -- everyone's support you.
 
KADMON: I know it's impossible, but this is my wish, you know.
 
ROBERTSON (voice-over): Israel's war in Gaza has 33,000 people, according to the health ministry there, and triggered a humanitarian crisis of 
 
 catastrophic proportions. Baskin gets Israeli's anger, says they're still living in the trauma of October 7th, but that won't bring peace.
 
BASKIN: The ultimate victory over Hamas is not military. It's political. It's when the Palestinians have freedom and dignity.
 
ROBERTSON (voice-over): Iran's missiles that impacted Sunday might focus minds. Israel's enemies are exploiting divisions, or it could deepen the 
 
 wedge as debate over how to respond drags on.
 
Nic Robertson, CNN, Jerusalem.

CHATTERLEY: Safety experts and Boeing whistleblowers testifying earlier on Capitol Hill. The focus was on the embattled plane maker's safety culture 
 
 and not one but two Senate hearings. A Boeing quality engineer said, "They are putting out defective airplanes." Another witness made alarming 
 
 comments about key documents relating to January's door plug incident.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ED PIERSON, FORMER SENIOR MANAGER, BOEING: The NTSB chair reiterated to Congress last week that Boeing has said there are no records documenting 
 
 the removal of the Alaska Airlines door. I'm not going to sugarcoat this, this is a criminal cover-up. Records do in fact exist. I know this because 
 
 I've personally passed them to the FBI.
 
A few -- a five-minute testimony is not nearly enough time to explain how insidious this story is. Boeing's corporate leaders continue to conceal the 
 
 truth. They continue to mislead and deceive the public about the safety of the planes. That is the safety culture at the top of the Boeing company 
 
 right now.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHATTERLEY: And Pete Muntean has been following the hearings in Washington for us. Pete, it's hard to describe some of the comments that came out of 
 
 this as anything other than damning in many respects. We've heard a lot of concerns about the safety issues, but I think also what came out today, and 
 
 you can correct me if I'm wrong, was the fact that for some of these whistleblowers, they're suggesting that one of the quotes, "I was ignored, 
 
 I was told not to create delays, I was told frankly to shut up."
 
PETE MUNTEAN, CNN AVIATION CORRESPONDENT: Well, Boeing says it doesn't retaliate against employees. That's the big insistence from Boeing right 
 
 now. But after these allegations, after allegations against Boeing in these dueling Senate hearings today, Boeing has taken another black eye.
 
And this newest allegation from whistleblower Sam Salehpour, he was a quality engineer on the 787 line, he saw big sections of the 787 fuselage 
 
 being joined together, and he says the gaps in those pieces are huge too big, which creates stress and wear, which could lead to fatigue failure 
 
 over time.
 
Now, Boeing insists there is no evidence of that in the 13 to 16 years the 787 has been flying. There's about 1,100 of them flying worldwide, none 
 
 lost to a crash. But here's a clip from Salehpour in which he said the 787 is being put together dangerously.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SAM SALEHPOUR, BOEING ENGINEER: From what I've seen, the airplanes are not being built per spec and per requirement. As the plane gets older, you 
 
 know, all of these things that, you know, you took -- you know, you said it's not a safety issue, it becomes a safety issue.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MUNTEAN: The Federal Aviation Administration here in the U.S. says it's investigating this allegation. Boeing held a press briefing on Monday, but 
 
 executives would not comment directly on Salehpour's allegations. Here's the statement from Boeing. They say, we are fully committed to the 787 
 
 Dreamliner. These claims about structural integrity of the 787 are inaccurate and do not represent the comprehensive work Boeing has done to 
 
 ensure the quality and long-term safety of the aircraft.
 
Just another blackeye in the chapter of this saga, years-long issues and disasters at Boeing. Two 737 MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019, killed 346 
 
 people abroad. Led to a 20-month long grounding worldwide. Then this past January, there was the door plug blowout on Alaska Airlines 737 MAX 9. But 
 
 remember, this latest accusation has to do with the 787. It's not been that without its problems, though.
 
Deliveries of the 787 were paused in 2021 and 2022 because of quality issues. Some of that, Boeing says, is because the tolerances are so tight. 
 
 The gaps allowed between the main fuselage sections are five one thousandths of an inch. The width of two sheets of paper. As thin as a 
 
 human hair. Boeing says it set that tolerance and maybe a little bit more extreme than necessary for a plane to be safe. Julia.
 <br>[18:10:00]
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes, it was described as hyper conservative. I thought his response to that was interesting though. When operating at 35,000 feet, the 
 
 size of a human hair can be a matter of life or death.
 
He also referred, Pete, and I think this was important, he said not only when he was talking about the documentation that that documentation with 
 
 regards to the door plug blowout on that aircraft back in January, he said, look, it's the same kind of treatment that the two MAX crashes got as well 
 
 and that there was this scramble allegedly to cover up the details of what happened.
 
We can talk about Boeing's response in any of these cases, and I know and we've talked in the past about the efforts that they're now making to 
 
 tackle some of these issues that the ultimate question is, does hearing an event or two events like this today make consumers, travelers more 
 
 reluctant to travel on Boeing jets and particularly the 787 and the 777?
 
MUNTEAN: I think the traveling public is really paying attention to this. The good news here is that Senator Richard Blumenthal, who called this 
 
 hearing, says he thinks that this does not have a commentary on the safety of flying right now. He does think that the airplanes remain safe.
 
Although, that's the big question for consumers, and people come up to me all the time saying that they're looking at their tickets to see if they're 
 
 on a MAX 9, to see if they're on a 787. It has really affected Boeing's reputation, one that was so sterling for this manufacturing Goliath, and 
 
 really could not be shaken.
 
So, it had this squeaky-clean image. Now, we will see, as this plays out, if airlines will begin shelving their orders for Boeing airplanes, if 
 
 they'll pivot to buying more air buses. This could have a really big ripple effect here. We are only just now seeing the start of it, Julia.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes, and it's an important point, I think, to separate current travel and current travel situations versus what we've seen in the past, 
 
 but it doesn't stop questions being asked. Pete, great to have you. Thank you. Pete Muntean there in Washington.
 
OK. U.S. President Joe Biden channeled his inner tariff man during a campaign stop in the critical swing State of Pennsylvania Wednesday. Move 
 
 over Donald Trump, Biden announcing that he could soon triple tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum imports saying Beijing is not playing fair on 
 
 trade.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: Because Chinese steel companies produce a lot more steel than China needs, it ends up dumping extra steel onto the global 
 
 markets at unfairly low prices. And the prices are unfairly low because China's steel companies don't need to worry about making a profit because 
 
 the Chinese government is subsidizing them so heavily. They're not competing. They're cheating.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHATTERLEY: The president is under an election year pressure from labor unions to take a firmer stance on Chinese imports. He also says he still 
 
 opposes the proposed merger of Japan's Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel, which of course is also based in Pennsylvania. Kevin Liptak joins us now from 
 
 Washington.
 
Kevin, I think we all know that he's made a renaissance in manufacturing, a keystone of this presidency and his hopes, I think, indeed for the future. 
 
 Steel would just be one piece of what they're analyzing, but, what, tariffs are, 7.5 percent today, the suggestion is then that they could perhaps go 
 
 to 25 percent. China won't be happy.
 
KEVIN LIPTAK, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: No, and I think they've already responded to another aspect of what the president did today, which 
 
 was order this new investigation into the Chinese shipbuilding industry, which he similarly is accusing of overly being benefited by government 
 
 support. And they have said that that's wrong. They said that this could have the potential to harm the bilateral relationship.
 
And you'll remember, this is something that President Biden has been trying to improve over the course of his presidency, and he does feel like he's 
 
 made some success. He's spoken regularly with Xi Jinping. Just this week, the defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, spoke with his counterpart for the 
 
 first time in over a year.
 
So, there has been some progress on improving what had been quite a chilly relationship between the two -- world's two largest economies. But this 
 
 does have the potential to threaten that in some ways. And I think President Biden has taken the gamble that it is to the benefit of his own 
 
 political campaign in November to try and win some of these industrial states, to try and look tough on China, and to try and rebuff some of 
 
 Trump's own accusations that he's weak on China to put these tariffs in place, or to at least suggest that these tariffs could go into place.
 
There is a big difference between the tariffs that Trump applied when he was president, these, according to the Biden administration, will be much 
 
 more strategic, much more targeted. They won't be sort of this broad scale across the board tariffs that Trump has talked about putting in place if he 
 
 were to gain the White House again.
 
But it is still this sort of protectionist stream of industrial policy that President Biden is really embraced to the detriment of some of these 
 
 bilateral relationships across the board, not only in China, but certainly in Europe as well when it comes to subsidies for electric vehicles and that 
 
 sort of thing.
 <br>[18:15:00]
 
So, this is sort of a strategy by the Biden administration to demonstrate that they are on the side of American workers, and I think it will be 
 
 essential in places like Pennsylvania, but also states like Michigan and Wisconsin, which have this heavy concentration of union workers that 
 
 President Biden very much wants to demonstrate he's behind.
 
Certainly, those states will be essential. It's called the blue wall. President Biden really cannot win reelection if he doesn't maintain his 
 
 advantage in those states, and I think that's part of why you're seeing what he's doing today.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes, and perhaps this is one way to do it. Kevin, thank you for that. Kevin Liptak there.
 
All right. Straight ahead, dangerous to our health and our livelihoods. A brand-new study says the climate emergency will make the world poorer.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to "First Move." And another day of Wall Street weakness tops today's "Money Move." Sadly, U.S. stocks in the red once 
 
 again with the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq now down four sessions in a row. That's despite Wednesday's sizable drop in oil prices. We also saw bond yields 
 
 pulling back slightly too. Investors now gearing up for the start of tech earning season. We've got Netflix reporting results on Thursday.
 
Now, a mixed day in Asia. Japanese stocks finished the day below the 38,000-mark as a new survey shows wanting business confidence, but the 
 
 Shanghai composite rallied more than 2 percent. So, you can see bucking the broader trend there.
 
Now, roads are underwater, flights are disrupted after a years' worth of rain fell in less than a day in the UAE. Some areas saw more than 250 
 
 millimeters on Tuesday. This was the scene at Dubai International Airport. Large jets there looking more like boats as water sprayed and waves rippled 
 
 as they moved through the flooded runways and tarmacs.
 
One woman said her flight circled in the air for around three hours before diverting to Abu Dhabi. Eleni Giokos has more.
 <br>[18:20:00]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ELENI GIOKOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Powerful storms, torrential rainfall, bringing Dubai to a standstill, disrupting the lives of 
 
 thousands. Among the towering skyscrapers, the rain fell so heavily and so quickly, streets were turned into rivers, highways into lakes.
 
Cars submerged underwater. People stuck for hours on the main road to the airport, forced to abandon their vehicles as the flooded water rose. And at 
 
 Dubai International Airport, planes battled against flooded runways. Emirates Airlines halted all departing flights from Dubai on Wednesday, 
 
 with incoming flights being diverted to neighboring countries.
 
Severe weather also affected other Gulf states. In neighboring Oman, at least 18 people died in flash floods, according to the country's National 
 
 Committee for Emergency Management.
 
GIOKOS: This region is known for its hot and dry weather. That is why scenes like this are completely unprecedented. We're talking about four 
 
 inches or 100 millimeters of rain in the course of 12 hours. That is what Dubai normally experiences over one year. Now, this is also record rainfall 
 
 since data began around 75 years ago. Dubai is known for its dazzle, it's known for its innovation, but perhaps, in many ways, infrastructure has 
 
 been overlooked because it simply cannot cope with this type of rainfall.
 
And with climate change becoming a reality globally and also here in the Middle East, perhaps that needs to change.
 
GIOKOS (voice-over): Rain is expected to taper off in the region, but a few showers may linger Wednesday before dry weather returns.
 
Eleni Giokos, CNN, Dubai.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHATTERLEY: Now, a popular tourist destination in Central Mexico is grappling with the opposite issue. This is what Lake Patzcuaro looked like 
 
 before it was hit by drought. And this is what the lake looks like now. A viral video shows that much of it has dried up. Cracked soil lays where the 
 
 water once was. The local government blames severe environmental factors and water theft too.
 
Now, climate change could cost the world an estimated $38 trillion by 2050. That's according to a new study in Nature. And the burden, as you can well 
 
 imagine, won't be shared equally across the globe. The Middle East, Africa, and South Asia are all projected to see median incomes drop in the coming 
 
 decades by more than 20 percent.
 
Bill Weir joins us now. Bill, we'll talk about that because that's going to further constrain their ability to tackle this, whether it's mitigation 
 
 efforts or adaption. But can we first talk about that headline number and say that actually -- and it's still a massive number, but the cost of 
 
 meeting the Paris targets is a fraction of that, $6 trillion.
 
BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT: Exactly, and the most troubling result of this, or conclusion that comes out of this Nature study, Julia, 
 
 is that a lot of that damage, that $38 trillion dollars, is baked in, despite the mitigation efforts. And that can be brought down with smart 
 
 adaptation programs now, but we no longer live in a world where Dubai can take for granted drainage problems.
 
You know, it's just a -- it's the kind of problems they deal with in Singapore, not in the middle of the desert. But this is the new crazy water 
 
 cycles we're seeing as we go whiplash from mega drought, lakes disappearing, to lakes reappearing in places where they haven't been in 
 
 generations. As the planet heats up and starts reacting in ways, we just have no precedent for.
 
CHATTERLEY: How much is baked in, Bill, to your point? Because I think there are still those out there that say, hey, look, we've had extreme 
 
 weather in the past. We have the odd years. I remember, you say this to people, perhaps a few decades older than me. I remember back then when we 
 
 had extremes like this before, I mean, we feel a change. I certainly think in the last five to 10 years there's been a dramatic change.
 
WEIR: Yes.
 
CHATTERLEY: But how much is baked in? And how much of this is about one particular year versus a trend that we feel and see, at least most of us 
 
 do?
 
WEIR: That key is the word -- keyword you just said there is trend. And if you look at where we're headed, just this -- over the last year, every 
 
 single day has set a new record for ocean temperatures on that particular calendar day. We're just in unprecedented areas now, literally off the 
 
 charts.
 
And so, if you just play out the math that we're seeing right now, if you live -- whether you live in Dubai or you live in somewhere where tornadoes 
 
 just took down your house, rebuilding is more expensive. Insurance is more expensive as a result of that. Medical care, long-term health, mental 
 
 health as a result of this.
 <br>[18:25:00]
 
The productivity goes down as temperature goes up, even for workers in air- conditioned factories because often times, they don't have air conditioning at home and are suffering through hot nights as well.
 
There was another study that just came out today from Consumer Reports, very respected organization, nonprofit, who put a price tag on it and said, 
 
 a baby born in 2024, over the course of their life, will cost $500,000, half a million dollars in their life of these added costs, harder to grow 
 
 food and move it, supply chains, shelter, all of that.
 
And as you can see there, as you mentioned, it's so unfair. Europe and North America, half the pain of the folks in the Global South who have tiny 
 
 contributions to the overall problem.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes, I was just, earlier this morning, doing a panel at the IMF about conflict regions and it was the Middle East and Central Asia and how 
 
 we do a better job of helping support them. A few conflicts have created 47 million displaced people in that region, and then you overlay that kind of 
 
 income drop with climate change. It's frightening and we need to do better to address it. Bill, great to have you with us. Thank you.
 
WEIR: Good to see you, Julia.
 
CHATTERLEY: Bill Weir. Now, drought in Mexico. Floods in Dubai, as we were discussing. You can add to that laundry list of extreme weather. Tornadoes 
 
 in Central United States. Chad Myers joins us now to give us sadly more bad news, Chad.
 
CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST: 28 of them over the past 72 hours, Julia. Yes, tornadoes were on the ground for much of yesterday, even a little bit 
 
 of today. Not too much in the way of damage, though. For the day and what it looked like last week on the computer models, we could have had 100 
 
 tornadoes, it didn't happen. And that is at least some of the good news.
 
We still have some severe weather right now. Any tornado watch, which means some storms can spin. Some storms could contain a tornado. At least for 
 
 right now, that is not the case. There's hail out there. There's wind damage still happening out there.
 
And as we work our way into tomorrow, we're going to have another area of severe weather around St. Louis in the U.S. And then, finally, moving away 
 
 and everything calming down by the weekend. Everything's going to calm down after tomorrow, really, because cold air is going to come by, push all this 
 
 humidity away and take that potential for any tornado damage completely away.
 
Look at for you, 49. For me, in the 80s down here in Atlanta. For China here and for all of East Asia, good morning, there will be some heavy rain 
 
 north of Hong Kong. There will be some spots with 250 millimeters of rain. That's more than they saw in Dubai in many places. And we saw what kind of 
 
 flooding that would happen there. And this is the area here, north of Hong Kong, that could see that in the coming days. Julia.
 
CHATTERLEY: Chad, thank you for that. Chad Myers there. Stay with "First Move." We'll be right back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:31:00]
 
CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to "First Move." And a look at more of the international headlines this hour. The U.S. Senate has swiftly rejected the 
 
 articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. The body voted to end the trial on a party line vote 51 to 49. 
 
 Republicans had targeted Mayorkas over his handling of the U.S.-Mexico border. Democrats, meanwhile, have slammed the proceedings as a political 
 
 stunt.
 
Donald Trump's hush money trial is set to resume Thursday after a midweek break. Tuesday's proceedings ended with seven jurors chosen from an 
 
 eventual 12. That's not counting the alternates, which could total up to six. The judge admonished Trump for his conduct in the courtroom, including 
 
 talking and gesturing at a juror while she was being questioned.
 
The president of Columbia University testified before the U.S. House Wednesday over her institution's response to antisemitism. Critics say 
 
 Minouche Shafik has not done enough to protect students from prejudice on campus. The House Education Committee has been investigating a reported 
 
 spike in incidents since the October 7th attack on Israel.
 
And Bangladesh has made major strides in reducing chronic hunger. But during the COVID-19 pandemic, it worsened not just in Bangladesh, but 
 
 around the world. That's when one showrunner stepped in, providing food through what some people call the "Hunger Games." Kristie Lu Stout has the 
 
 details.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): From the far-flung corners of rural Bangladesh, an unlikely internet sensation is making quite 
 
 a splash. With billions of views and counting, and millions of subscribers, this is the "SS Food Challenge." Often called the "Hunger Games" with a 
 
 social twist, it's also reminiscent of another global rage, "Takeshi's Castle." An epic game show from Japan in which players overcome obstacles 
 
 to win.
 
While the comparisons are inevitable, the beginnings of "SS Food challenge" are rooted in necessity rather than the sole thrill of it.
 
OMAR SUNNY SOMRAT, CREATOR, SS FOOD CHALLENGE: The journey off to "SS Food Challenge" started in 2020. But when inflation hits in Bangladesh and the 
 
 price of edible items go so high. It was a viral topic. Then we come with the idea of giving edible items as rewards.
 
STOUT (voice-over): Rising living costs have been a sore point for Bangladesh, a country where around a fifth of its over 170 million people 
 
 live below the poverty line.
 
RUCHIR DESAI, FUND MANAGER, ASIA FRONTIER CAPITAL: Inflation has been pretty high over the last few years for multiple factors. There's 
 
 combination of the war in Ukraine, high commodity prices, high fuel prices in 2022 and also removal of many subsidies linked to domestic consumption 
 
 such as fuel and cooking gas in 2023.
 
STOUT (voice-over): The ripple effects are still quite evident.
 
MOHAMMAD BABLU, RICKSHAW PULLER (through translator): We are barely surviving with prices of everything going up. I struggle to balance between 
 
 buying rice and lentils and my children's expenses. I can't fix this dilemma.
 
STOUT (voice-over): This is where the "SS Food Challenge" steps in. A silver lining to a very dark cloud. A source of entertainment in grim times 
 
 with social welfare at its core.
 
SOMRAT: My biggest challenge is to control the crowd. Everyone wants to participate in the games. But in a game day, I can only allow 100, 120 or 
 
 at most 150 people.
 
STOUT (voice-over): Yet, backed by a tiny team of 25, a simple phone camera and zero sponsors, this noble venture manages to keep the calm on site.
 
While taking the online world by storm, at the same time ensuring that no participants, even those who lose, leave empty handed.

CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to "First Move." The boy band Mirror is not only one of the most popular musical acts in Hong Kong, it's also helped spark a 
 
 revival in pop music sung in Cantonese, aka, Cantopop.

(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes, and as you can and are well aware, that wasn't Cantonese, but Mirror has also released two songs in English, "Rumours" and "Day 0," 
 
 which could earn them millions of new fans around the globe. And they recently performed live in the New York City area.
 
I had the chance to meet with all 12 members of the group to hear their amazing story and of course, their fabulous music. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHATTERLEY: Mirror, welcome to New York.
 
CROWD: Yes.
 
CHATTERLEY: For people who don't know, who is Mirror? What is Mirror? Ian?
 
IAN MIRROR MEMBER: Mirror, we are a boy band for sure. And we actually come from a reality show, reality TV show. When we participated in this show, 
 
 we're mainly maybe student or some of us work as maybe dancer. We are not clearly from the industry. So, the show brought us together and then we 
 
 grew up as a band.
 
CHATTERLEY: Tell me how you make this work because you are -- and there's 12 of you. You have lots of different projects going on your own and then 
 
 you come together and then you become boy band Mirror. How do you fit everything in?
 
STANLEY, MIRROR MEMBER: Each of us has their own interests.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes.
 
STANLEY: Yes. For example, for me, I like acting. Elton and Norman do the candidacy rap (ph) and singer, songwriter. Yes. So, we are so unique. So, 
 
 we, like, group together as Mirror. That's the uniqueness of Mirror.
 <br>[18:40:00]
 
CHATTERLEY: That's what you're seeing, and that's what makes you unique.
 
STANLEY: Yes.
 
CHATTERLEY: OK. Explain Cantopop, because when I talk to people in America and in the U.K., and I say, I'm meeting the band Mirror, they're like, is 
 
 that K-pop? I'm like, no. So, explain, in your words, what it is that you do. And I know it's a mix of things.
 
ANSON LO, MIRROR MEMBER: Yes, the most outstanding thing is the Cantonese is not English. But I think Canton pop is something that we've been trying 
 
 to explore and also trying to embrace and also absorb from different countries of styles, different genres of music.
 
And then, we have to put in and also add in our unique music style of Hong Kong as well. Because in Hong Kong, we often do melodic songs very often. 
 
 So, I think that's a mixture of those things together that Canton pop, I think.
 
CHATTERLEY: I'm glad he explained it, because I couldn't. Beyond the Cantonese, I see all sorts of influences. I mean, Taylor Swift, maybe a bit 
 
 of Michael Jackson. There's hip hop in there sometimes. Your musical influences, James Brown. Awesome. Another one. It kind of varied.
 
And throughout the time that you've already been going, I see lots of changes in your music. And you also sing in English, just to be clear. 
 
 "Rumours" and "Day 0," I hope you're warmed up. Is everyone warmed up even on two hours sleep? Give me a rendition of whatever you want, whether it's 
 
 "Rumours" or Day 0" in English.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In five, six, seven, eight.
 
(MUSIC PLAYING)
 
CHATTERLEY: Awesome. OK. "Rumours."
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Wow.
 
CHATTERLEY: Different reel now.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Five, six, seven, eight.
 
(MUSIC PLAYING)
 
CHATTERLEY: Brilliant. Maybe -- some of these lyrics are naughty, naughty. Dating? Who's dating? I would never be forgiven by your fans if I didn't 
 
 ask. Who's dating? Who's available? Are you allowed to answer?
 
IAN: Well, speaking of the -- I mean, we have one that's getting married soon.
 
STANLEY: I have a stable relationship.
 
CHATTERLEY: Right.
 
IAN: Very stable.
 
CHATTERLEY: Very stable if they're getting married. This is good news.
 
STANLEY: It's way before I get into this industry.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Who's available?
 
CHATTERLEY: Hands up.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Who's single? Who's single? Who's single?
 
CHATTERLEY: Oh, my. This is breaking news. OK. Good. This is what we like. The single guys. OK. Can we please talk about Rolling Stone? Because I do 
 
 feel like that probably should have been like the highlight of the Rolling Stones.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, Rolling Stones.
 
CHATTERLEY: I know. Even they didn't break news about who's single and who's getting married.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Top secret.
 
CHATTERLEY: Top secret. Not anymore, my friends. OK. So, I want to start over here. I want you to sign it for me. That's going to be worth a lot one 
 
 day. What was it like? What did your family say when they realized you were going to be in Rolling Stone?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Amazing.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Exciting.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Surreal.
 
CHATTERLEY: Surreal.
 
STANLEY: Yes. There's like too much. So surprised like -- because Rolling Stone is like -- it's unreal to getting on the magazine.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Magazine.
 
STANLEY: Yes.
 
CHATTERLEY: Do you guys ever argue?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Argue?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sometimes.
 
CHATTERLEY: Do you? What do you argue about?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Food.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
 
CHATTERLEY: Food?
 
STANLEY: What are we going to eat?
 
CHATTERLEY: Really?
 
STANLEY: Lunch or for dinner?
 
EDAN, MIRROR MEMBER: Actually, I think we didn't argue much. But sometimes we will have different opinions on, for example, like what songs we are 
 
 going to publish, or what style of dancing we are going to do. So, we have some -- not arguments, but -- 
 
CHATTERLEY: Creative differences?
 
EDAN: We have some discussions, yes, but -- 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Strong discussions.
 
CHATTERLEY: Loud, loud discussions. Who's the peacemaker? Who's the person who like solves the arguments or the discussions?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Me or (INAUDIBLE).
 
CHATTERLEY: Really?
 
ANSON LO: Yes, I think.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are the bridge of -- 
 
CHATTERLEY: You're the bridge?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are quiet.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're quiet. We're quiet.
 
CHATTERLEY: You quietly say, this is what we're doing, we're not arguing?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
 
CHATTERLEY: OK. Are you on like a WhatsApp group?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, yes.
 
CHATTERLEY: Are you? All of you?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
 <br>[18:45:00]
 
CHATTERLEY: Are you on separate WhatsApp groups as well or do you have like little groups within the group, or is it all just one big WhatsApp group?
 
ANSON KONG, MIRROR MEMBER: Sometimes, we'll -- because we would do some solo -- some separate different projects. Also, we some separate group.
 
CHATTERLEY: Who's the worst at responding on the main chat?
 
STANLEY: Worst responding?
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes.
 
STANLEY: I think maybe, Jer. He's never replied -- 
 
CHATTERLEY: He's like, don't look at me.
 
STANLEY: He never reply in the group. He's on mute. Yes.
 
CHATTERLEY: You just disappear. You need your alone time.
 
STANLEY: Yes.
 
CHATTERLEY: What do you do to chill out? Just to relax and be -- 
 
ANSON KONG: I will hang with my dog.
 
CHATTERLEY: With your dog?
 
ANSON KONG: Yes.
 
CHATTERLEY: What dog do you -- 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The whole day.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Some of us like to basketball.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Some of us like playing video games.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Driving.
 
CHATTERLEY: Driving.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Because you can have your own personal space inside your car.
 
CHATTERLEY: What's your dog called?
 
ANSON KONG: Chai Chai. Hi. You are in CNN, Chai Chai.
 
CHATTERLEY: If you could collaborate with any artist in the United States or in the U.K., who would you collaborate with? I know you've just done 
 
 one, obviously on "Day 0." Who would you, who?
 
ANSON KONG: Usher.
 
CHATTERLEY: Oh, Usher.
 
ANSON KONG: Yes. I love him. I love him so much.
 
CHATTERLEY: OK. If he's watching, message to Usher, to say -- 
 
ANSON KONG: Usher, I hope you can collaborate us. Thank you so much.
 
CHATTERLEY: Anyone else?
 
STANLEY: I would say Bruno Mars.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
 
STANLEY: Yes. I like him.
 
CHATTERLEY: Bruno Mars. OK. Now, we're getting the influences, I think, in your music.
 
STANLEY: And his dance move is so great. Groovy.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes. Any women? A bit of girl power?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Taylor Swift.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Taylor Swift.
 
CHATTERLEY: I was about to say, come on, guys, Taylor Swift. She's pretty awesome Yes.
 
STANLEY: So many superstars.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I would say some band, Bon Jovi.
 
CHATTERLEY: Bon Jovi.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Those hard rock bands. Yes, it will be great.
 
CHATTERLEY: Because like I hear that in your earlier music as well, there's a definite kind of rock vibe to it.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
 
CHATTERLEY: This is the beauty, I think, of Cantopop. There are so many influences, so you have options to go in all directions. What next? What 
 
 are your ambitions, both as a group and individually?
 
ANSON LO: As a group? I think we are planning to release more English songs, but nothing -- nothing's confirmed yet. But I think back -- when 
 
 we're back to Hong Kong, then we'll definitely keep releasing Mandarin songs as usual. Because we'll have -- quite of us are like solo -- went 
 
 solo. And so, we will sometimes put out solo songs and once in a while group songs. So yes, a lot of songs will be coming up.
 
LOKMAN, MIRROR MEMBER: And we are planning to do some mini group, mini group of song. Yes.
 
CHATTERLEY: A mini group?
 
LOKMAN: Yes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. It was separate.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And we will open another WhatsApp group.
 
CHATTERLEY: But only the people in it are going to know. For you guys, you kind of began as individuals and you have your own strengths and actually 
 
 that's embraced within the group. Do you think that's also part of the unique power of Mirror is that your differences are also part of your 
 
 strengths in many ways, like your talents are part of the strength?
 
EDAN: Yes, absolutely. Because all of us have our own strengths and own personality and own characteristics. So, we have different solos, projects, 
 
 but all of the projects, we have different styles of music and different styles of genre. And even though we can take part in many different film 
 
 projects, we can act as different characters.
 
So, this makes Mirror so special that not only just performing, dancing, and singing. Yes.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes. Who is your music for? Who are you singing for?
 
ANSON LO: I think we sing for people who look for positivities and also look for cheers and happiness because we always tend to bring up the energy 
 
 and the positive vibes through our songs and that nothing's impossible, because through -- with our different backgrounds and we came from a 
 
 variety show and that we've never seen that -- we've never imagined that we could come this far.
 
So, I think that, yes, we sing for people who wants to believe in them. Yes.
 
CHATTERLEY: You are flying the flag for the entertainment industry for the music artists, actors, hip hop dancers in Hong Kong. Are you proud to come 
 
 from Hong Kong and bring that positivity?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Of course.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, sure.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHATTERLEY: Look, and I've got my magazine here, perfectly signed. And from pitch perfect singing to performing on the pitch, four of Europe's top 
 
 footy clubs have been battling it out in the Champions League quarterfinals. We'll tell you who made it through and who's feeling a 
 
 little blue, next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:52:07]
 
CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to "First Move." It's been another dramatic night in the Champions League as two more teams secure a place in the semifinals. 
 
 The dream is over though for reigning champions Manchester City who were beaten by Real Madrid in a breathtaking penalty shootout. Bad news too for 
 
 Arsenal after they were knocked out by Bayern Munich.
 
Patrick Snell has all the live action for us. I have to admit, I do love penos. I do love it when it goes to penos, but there's going to be some 
 
 miserable Mancunians tonight, certainly.
 
PATRICK SNELL, CNN WORLD SPORT: They're there. You know, Julia, they're every fan's worst nightmare. If your team loses on the penalty shootout, if 
 
 your team wins on the shootout, it's a feeling of elation and ecstasy.
 
Real Madrid, there's no (INAUDIBLE) more successful in this competition. Los Blancos know what it takes. They're going for a 15th -- a record 
 
 extending 15th title, would you believe? And they are still on track to do that.
 
Manchester City and Real Madrid going head-to-head in Manchester on Wednesday night. It was thrill after a thrilling first leg, and it would be 
 
 visiting Real who strike first. Through their young Brazilian star Rodrygo turning in the cross for compatriot Vinicius Junior in the 12th minute, 4-
 
 3. Los Blancos at that point overall.
 
Now, Julia, City was so dominant in the second half. No surprise when they get their leveler through their Belgian Star Kevin De Bruyne taking 
 
 advantage of a defensive slip quite literally from Antonio Rudiger, that made it four-all on aggregate over the two legs.
 
Just over 10 minutes to go, Kevin De Bruyne trying his luck. He's just over the top there. A good effort there from the Belgian player. This match 
 
 going to extra time. And right at the end of the first half of extra time, it would be that man, Rudiger, with a great chance to put his team ahead, 
 
 the chance not taken though. No further scoring. An extra time means penalties Man City's Bernardo Silva going right down the middle, but Andriy 
 
 Lunin saves it without even moving.
 
City's Mateo Kovacic denied again by Lunin. Back-to-back saves from the Ukrainian keeper, the hero of the night for Real. It all comes down to the 
 
 veteran Rudiger, and he makes no mistake, cool as you like. Real Madrid through to a 33rd semifinal in this competition. And you can see right 
 
 there what it means to Carlo Ancelotti's team, a night of drama in Manchester.
 
Now, in Wednesday night's other match, six-time winners Bayern Munich facing arsenal at the Allianz Arena. This tie also level after the first 
 
 leg at two apiece. And it's the Bavarian Giants to go ahead on the night, a stooping header from the talented youngster Joshua Kimmich, the deposed 
 
 Bundesliga champs now 3-2 up on Aggregate. And you know what? That was the only goal of the night.
 
And after a season of relatively domestic disappointment for Bayern amid Bayer Leverkusen's title joy, special moment there for Harry Kane, of 
 
 course. He used to play for the Gunners big North London rivals Tottenham. Bayern Munich looking to win this tournament for a seventh time. Look at 
 
 those scenes of joy then, Bavaria on Wednesday night at the expense of Mikel Arteta's Arsenal.
 <br>[18:55:00]
 
So, what does this all mean then in terms of the semifinals? Those semifinals are now set on Tuesday night, Julia, we learned Paris Saint-
 
 Germain looking for their first ever title. They'll face the 1997 winners Borussia Dortmund. And Bayern Munich, another German team, are right there 
 
 against Real Madrid on Tuesday night.
 
We saw two Spanish sides exit the tournament on Wednesday night, Julia. Two English teams exiting this most prestigious of European club competitions. 
 
 Back to you.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes. Wow. It's shaping up to be a cracking semi and a final. We'll see. We'll talk about it, no doubt. Patrick, thank you. Great to have 
 
 you.
 
And finally, on "First Move," it sounds like a crossover worthy of Hollywood. The excitement of "Snakes on a Plane" meeting the Marla Millet 
 
 (ph) thrills of Brad Pitt's "Bullet Train." Stay with me.
 
But for passengers on a real-life bullet train in Japan, things were a little less exciting when a small snake stowed away between Nagoya and 
 
 Osaka. It resulted in a 17-minute delay as passengers switched trains just as a precaution. 17 minutes might not sound long, but bear in mind that 
 
 once a railway company in Japan apologized because a conductor left the station 20 seconds early. Wow. We could learn a few things here.
 
That wraps up the show. I'll see you tomorrow.
