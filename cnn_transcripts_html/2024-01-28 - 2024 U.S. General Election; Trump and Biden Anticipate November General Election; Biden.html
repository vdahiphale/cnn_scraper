(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANNA COREN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Welcome to all of you watching in the United States and around the world. I'm Anna Coren, live from Hong Kong. Ahead on "CNN Newsroom."
 
We're getting a good look at what could be ahead in the race for the White House as Donald Trump and Joe Biden exchange insults from the campaign trail. They're also touting their plans on border security. We'll bring you what each is saying about this growing crisis.
 
Plus, the head of the U.N. pleading for countries to continue funding its humanitarian aid work in Gaza. As countries withhold support amid allegations. Some U.N. aid agency staffers had a role in the October 7th Hamas attack.
 
Well, Donald Trump and Joe Biden are treating this weekend as the opening salvo for the 2024 general election. Both men are visiting states they'll be sure to win in February's nomination contests. Well, Former President Trump is in Nevada, while current President Biden is in South Carolina. And the insults are flying from opposite sides of the country.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  You're the reason I am president. You're the reason Kamala Harris is historic vice president. And you're the reason Donald Trump is a defeated former president. You're the reason Donald Trump is a loser. And you're the reason we're going to win and beat him again.
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Let there be no doubt what Joe Biden is doing is a crime against our nation. It's an absolute betrayal of our country, and it's an atrocity against our constitution. Nobody's ever seen anything like it. Crooked Joe will not get away with these crimes. He will be tried at the ballot box in November.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COREN:  Well, the other Republican candidate, Nikki Haley, was in her home state of South Carolina as well. She's also escalating her attacks on Trump after largely avoiding conflict for nearly a year. With the South Carolina primary weeks away, the state's former governor faces an uphill battle but she isn't holding back.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
NIKKI HALEY, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  And Donald Trump was totally unhinged. He was a bit sensitive, and I think his feelings were hurt, but he threw a temper tantrum out on stage. The next day, unhinged again, says, for anybody that supports Nikki Haley, you will be barred from MAGA.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COREN:  And while Haley launched attacks at Trump, he didn't have much to say about her in Nevada. CNN's Alayna Treene is traveling with the former president.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ALAYNA TREENE, CNN REPORTER:  Well, Nevada is a state that Donald Trump and his team feel like they have already won. And part of that is because Nikki Haley is not participating in the caucus here. Instead, she's on the ballot for the state's primary. But the caucus is really where the state's crucial delegates will be awarded.
 
And so, that was really a big part of Donald Trump's message on Saturday. He was telling voters to skip the primary altogether and make sure they get out for him on caucus day. But because Donald Trump and his team don't really see Nikki Haley as a player here, that allowed him Donald Trump to pivot to more of a general election message. And a big part of that message was talking about the border.
 
One reason is because the border is a key issue for Nevada. It's a state with a large migrant population. But another part of it is the timing. And that's what I found really noteworthy. He spent a lot of time railing against Congress's bipartisan negotiations over securing the southern border, and he went farther than he had before in declaring that there is, "Zero chance I will support these horrible open borders betrayal of America." Take a listen to how he put it.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TRUMP:  When you have a very small majority. Very tough. Mike Johnson, Speaker, he just said it's dead on arrival in the House. It's dead on arrival. We want either a strong bill or no bill, and whatever happens, happens. But this is the single greatest threat to our country right now is the people pouring into our country because we have no idea who they are. The fact is that if Joe Biden truly wanted to secure the border, he doesn't really need a bill.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[04:05:00]
 
TREENE:  Now, part of the reason Donald Trump spent so much time talking about this is because he wants to keep campaigning on immigration ahead of November, but he also sees it as a key vulnerability for Joe Biden. And so, I think you're going to continue to hear Donald Trump rail against the border, rail against this deal. And he also argued that he was happy taking the fall for its potential failure.
 
Now, one more thing I just want to point out that I found very noteworthy is that Donald Trump did not address the $83.3 million dollars that a jury decided he owes E. Jean Carroll during a trial on Friday. It's something that angered Donald Trump very much from my conversations with his advisors, but he did not bring it up once or address it.
 
Alayna Treene, CNN, Las Vegas.

COREN:  In the meantime, Mr. Biden is vowing to put tougher immigration measures in place as he tries to counter Trump's attacks. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is traveling with the president and has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER:  President Joe Biden drew a sharp contrast from Former President Donald Trump here in South Carolina on Saturday. In what was a preview of his general election arguments, casting the former president as, "Defeated and a loser." President Biden also making the case that Trump is only thinking about himself and not the country saying, "What's good for America is bad for him politically."
 
But the president also spent time making connections with what his administration has done on a range of issues to what communities are seeing on a day-to-day basis, be it investments in HBCUs, driving down insulin costs, and also student loan debt relief, which earned applause in the audience.
 
But notably, the president also weighing in on border security and putting his support behind a border deal that Senate negotiators have been working on for weeks. Saying that if given the authority, he would shut down the border and do it quickly.
 
BIDEN:  That bill with the law today, I'd shut down the border right now and fix it quickly. A bipartisan bill would be good for America and help fix our broken immigration system.
 
ALVAREZ:  Now, as he has faced in other remarks in the last few days and weeks, there were also protesters in the audience calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. They were escorted out and President Biden did not engage with them. But it was yet another example of the fractures within the coalition that the president is having to navigate.
 
But the bottom line here was that he needs South Carolina. It's a state that he has credited for turning the tide in 2020, and it is one that's going to have its primary next week. It will be the first after the Democratic National Committee overhauled the schedule with President Biden's support. The president reflecting on that. And while this is not a competitive primary, it will be a test of his standing with black voters, a key constituency to clinch that win in November.
 
Priscilla Alvarez, CNN, South Carolina.

COREN:  Well, meantime, a Michigan mayor representing the largest concentration of Arab-Americans in the U.S. has declined to meet with the Biden campaign manager over the war in Gaza. Abdullah Hammoud says any conversations with the president should be one of humanity not politics.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ABDULLAH HAMMOUD, MAYOR OF DEARBORN, MICHIGAN:  We have been expressing our disdain for the decision-making that's coming out of the White House for over 100 days now. And so, if you actually respect us and you dignify us for the human beings that we are, you don't send campaign staff to talk about such a pressing issue. You bring forward your senior policy delegation, you bring forward your cabinet members to have such a conversation and dialogue.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COREN:  The United Nations' Secretary General is asking countries not to suspend funding for the agency helping Palestinians in Gaza. These nine countries paused funding for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, also known as UNRWA, after accusations by Israel that a handful of UNRWA workers were involved in the October 7th attack.
 
Israel has not publicly released its evidence. UNRWA provides humanitarian and other services to the more than 2 million people in Gaza. In a statement, U.N. Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, says, the abhorrent alleged acts of these staff members must have consequences. But the tens of thousands of men and women who work for UNRWA should not be penalized. The dire needs of the desperate populations they serve must be met.
 
Well, CNN's Paula Hancocks is live in Abu Dhabi with more on the UNRWA controversy. And Paula, obviously we just heard from the U.N. Secretary General, but the head of UNRWA has also spoken out, calling the suspension of aid collective punishment for the people of Gaza. Tell us what the consequences of this decision by the major donors.
 
PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Anna, the chief of UNRWA has said that the decision by these donors to temporarily pull their funding was shocking. They had pointed out that some 2 million Gazans who rely, at the moment, they rely completely on humanitarian aid being brought in by UNRWA and by others, but UNRWA is the biggest operator within Gaza.
 <br>[04:10:00]
 
So, to lose the ability of UNRWA to be able to give humanitarian aid, there really is no other group that can take that place. And this is what we're hearing from the U.N. Secretary General as well, pointing out that the funding will only go as far as next month. It won't even be enough to see out the end of next month. And we all know the dire situation in Gaza at this point, as some officials are warning of a potential looming famine.
 
Now, for the UNRWA chief himself, Philippe Lazzarini, he did issue a statement which said, "It would be immensely irresponsible to sanction an agency and an entire community it serves because of allegations of criminal acts against some individuals, especially at a time of war, displacement, and political crises in the region." So, U.N. officials are calling on those countries to reconsider their decision. Anna.
 
COREN:  Paula, we are learning new details about a possible hostage deal that is being negotiated. What can you tell us?
 
HANCOCKS:  Well, we know that Bill Burns, the CIA director, is meeting in the coming days with his counterparts of both Israel and also Egypt. And there are hopes that there will be a replica of what happened last November when there was a cessation in hostilities and a chance for some of the hostages to be released and also Palestinian prisoners to be released by Israel as well.
 
Now, this is the hope that this is going ahead at this point, despite the fact that there has been some fairly bitter back and forth between Qatar, which is one of the main mediators, and the Israeli Prime Minister. Israel's Prime Minister, pointing out that he doesn't believe that Qatar has been doing enough.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Qatar hosts the leaders of Hamas. It also funds Hamas. It has leverage over Hamas. Qatar committed to make sure that the medication will reach the districts of Hamas to our hostages, and Qatar said that it can help bring them back. So, therefore, to put pressure on them, they position themselves as mediators. So, please, go right ahead and prove it. Let them be so good as to bring back our hostages.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HANCOCKS:  And just last week, there was some alleged leaked audio of the Israeli Prime Minister criticizing Qatar for not doing enough, and he really has doubled down on this weekend. But there are hopes that there is at least some movement towards a potential cessation in hostilities in order to be able to release some of the hostages and some of the Palestinian prisoners as well.
 
The White House had said a number of days ago that they didn't believe it would -- it could be termed as negotiations at this point. They didn't believe it had reached as far as that. But with the CIA director coming to meet with the intelligence chiefs of Israel and Egypt, there is a hope that this will be moving forward in the near future. Anna.
 
COREN:  Paula Hancocks joining us from Abu Dhabi, great to see you. Many thanks for the update.
 
Well, Christopher Gunness is the former spokesperson for the UN Relief and Works Agency. He joins me now from London. Christopher, what does it mean for some of the largest donors, especially the U.S., to even pause funding right now? And what is going to be the impact on the ground?
 
CHRISTOPHER GUNNESS, FORMER SPOKESMAN, U.N. RELIEF AND WORKS AGENCY: Responsibilities that the U.N. owes not just to the Palestinian people, but to the Palestine refugees, because they were displaced in a primordial catastrophe, 750,000 of them. driven from their homes or fled their homes. And the UN must protect the mandate of UNRWA. What we're seeing feels like a coordinated political attack on the -- on the only one organization mandated to serve the people of Gaza.
 
So, UNRWA needs to step up to the plate. The U.N. needs to step up to the plate and do everything it can to defend its mandate. And let me be clear. Israel, it seems, is laboring under the misapprehension that by getting rid of UNRWA, it will magically get rid of the refugees, the 6 million refugees that UNRWA serves. This is a fiction.
 
These are human beings with rights, both individual and collective rights. And you cannot just have here today, gone tomorrow politicians, be they in Israel or Western capitals, deciding that by getting rid of the agency, cutting off or suspending funding to the agency that serves them, that this problem will go away. What will make the problem go away is a just and durable solution for the Palestine refugees and only that.
 <br>[04:15:00]
 
And even if UNRWA, the agency, mandated to serve them would disappear, the refugees would still be human beings with inalienable rights. And that is a truth that needs to be the ground rock, the bedrock of this discourse.
 
UNRWA has shown that it has a proactive zero tolerance policy. It's come out proactively and put out this statement and it's explained to the world what it's done. It's escalated this to the level of the Secretary General. The Office of Internal Oversight in New York is investigating. Let's see what that investigation turns up.
 
Meanwhile, we need to protect the mandate. We need to protect the refugees because they are underneath 2000-pound bombs in Gaza, they need to be fed. And of course, already the world -- the U.N. is estimating that more people may die of starvation than the Israeli bombardment. So, let's ground this debate in the historic responsibilities of the U.N. towards the Palestinians.
 
COREN:  Christopher allegations that UNRWA is somehow involved with Hamas, this is nothing new. We know this has been going on for decades, this back and forth between Israel and UNRWA. But now these allegations that a dozen staffers out of 13,000 took part in the October 7th terror attack. Israel has not made its evidence public as yet, but how damaging is this to the agency's reputation?
 
GUNNESS:  Make no mistake about it, it certainly feels from within UNRWA as if there is an existential threat due to what feels like a coordinated political and economic attack on the agency. So, yes, it is extremely serious. And I pray and I hope that UNRWA will see the need to move out to the Arab world.
 
Where is the Arab world? We've got these Western donors, launching this. It feels -- what feels like a coordinated political attack on the agency. This is a Middle Eastern problem. The Palestine refugee problem is in the neighborhood, in the backyard of these Arab states who've got billions and billions in oil money. Why can't they step up to the plate and give UNRWA the funds it needs to deal with what is effectively a problem which is destabilizing their region?
 
Listen to what the Houthis say. They say that what is going on in Gaza is the cause of their war, the cause's bellies, so to speak. And what these Arab donors need to realize is that their attitude towards UNRWA in this specific moment will have wider regional implications. Western donors, the very Western donors who say they're worried about a wider conflagration in the Middle East, they're the ones, ironically, who are suspending aid to UNRWA. But the Arab world needs to step up to the plate.
 
And let's also be clear about one thing, this comes within days of the ruling of the ICJ, the Supreme Court of the World. And the president of that court made it very clear in issuing these provisional measures. And that's not just Israel, it's all the 150 state parties to the Genocide Convention, they are in violation of that convention if they are going to impede the delivery of humanitarian aid.
 
And what is happening now is that it looks like these western states are complicit in the violation of that convention and supporting Israel. We've got former Israeli officials on Twitter, X saying that they will never win this war unless they defeat UNRWA. This is highly political. And the United Nations from Antonio Guterres down needs to recognize this is a political attack and they need to step up to the plate and defend UNRWA's mandate and its historic responsibilities.
 
COREN:  Christopher, you used to work with UNRWA. What do you think are the discussions being held right now in the top echelons of the U.N. to recover from this and move forward amid possibly the greatest humanitarian crisis the agency has faced in its history.
 
GUNNESS:  My concern is that they are just going to ground and they're absolutely terrified. But it's silly because these attacks have happened before, and there is long experience with UNRWA in dealing with them. I think that the Secretary General needs to get this report out, the investigation report out as quickly as possible. And to move on, move swiftly, particularly to the Arab world, and say, we need you to step up to the plate.
 
It is the general assembly of which they are some of the richest members that give UNRWA its mandate. That mandate needs to be, not just protected, it needs to be paid for. And that's the kind of messaging which the U.N. should be putting out today. It needs to ground this whole international discourse, not in the agenda being set by some politicians in both Israel and the West, who for some reason, see it's in the interest of stability and the reason to destroy UNRWA.
 
The U.N. needs to proactively put this chapter behind it and move on with a much more important task of serving 2.3 million people in Gaza who desperately need humanitarian aid today. We need to refocus this debate on them and on the U.N.'s historic responsibilities.
 <br>[04:20:00]
 
COREN:  Christopher Gunness in London, we certainly appreciate your time. Thank you very much.
 
Well, protestors in Israel are pleading for the world to remember the plight of the hostages and to demand their release. Demonstrators marched in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem on Saturday, carrying Israeli flags and protestors -- posters, I should say, with photos of the more than 130 hostages who are believed to still be in Gaza. Well, they say they are trying and failing to keep hope alive.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ARYDH DOOBOV, PROTESTER:  We're over 100 days into this tragedy. There was the period of shock and uncertainty. But with every passing day, unfortunately, we feel more and more despair. I feel more and more despair. We always hope that Hirsch (ph) and all of the hostages will come home, will come back to their families, will return to living the lives they wish to live. But with every passing day, I feel that we are abandoned.

COREN:  Russia launches a widespread offensive in Ukraine, but the big guns on the defender's side often say silence, and it's not by choice. We'll explain after the break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[04:25:00]
 
COREN:  Russian President Vladimir Putin is repeating his claims about Nazism in Ukraine as he marked a major Soviet victory in World War II. On Saturday, he was joined by his ally, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko to mark 80 years since the siege of Leningrad was broken.
 
Mr. Putin compared Ukraine's government with Nazi Germany, which is a line he's been using to rally support for the war. But historians and political commentators have dismissed the comparison, and so has the Ukrainian government.
 
Well, Russia holds presidential elections in March when President Vladimir Putin is considered a shoo-in to win. But he's still facing a challenge from an anti-war candidate whose presidential ambition is raising questions of why he's even allowed to run. Clare Sebastian has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Under heavy snowfall and amid the chill of ever tighter limits on freedom of speech, this is a rare spark of Russian public opposition to Vladimir Putin. Patiently lining up to try to get an anti-war candidate on the ballot in upcoming presidential elections.
 
This is the only candidate that wants to stop the military action on someone else's territory, says Anatoly.
 
For some, it goes even deeper than the war.
 
I feel that my rights may be infringed, says Masha. I don't feel safe sometimes.
 
The candidate is Boris Nadezhdin, a 60-year-old physicist, former MP and advisor to the late opposition leader Boris Nemtsov. His manifesto describes the so-called special military operation in Ukraine as a fatal mistake. Pledging to immediately start peace talks if elected.
 
SEBASTIAN:  People have been arrested and sent to prison in Russia for a lot less than that. Why are you getting away with this?
 
BORIS NADEZHDIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I don't know. I don't know exactly why I am not arrested. I know Putin very well from '90s, even when he was not a president. He was a normal Russian bureaucrat, and I was normal Russian bureaucrat.
 
SEBASTIAN (voice-over):  Supporters have been lining up not just in Moscow, but outside Nadezhdin campaign headquarters in dozens of cities across Russia and even abroad. He has united the old guard of the Russian opposition, including key allies of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, his wife Yulia adding her signature on Wednesday, and exiled oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky. He's now racing to collect the required 100,000 signatures with strict regional quotas by the end of January.
 
SEBASTIAN:  People are saying that there is either -- there's a deal, perhaps, with the Kremlin to allow your campaign to go ahead to create the illusion of a real democracy or that they are using this as a way to distract the anti-Putin electorate. What do you say to those theories?
 
NADEZHDIN:  I am absolutely sure the situation will change because a lot of people now in Russia which started to see me in YouTube, in TV, in Telegram, they begin believe me.
 
SEBASTIAN (voice-over):  In the Moscow queue, Ivan (ph) tells us he doesn't care if Nadezhdin is a criminal plant or not.
 
IVAN (PH) (through translator):  I am prepared even for the candidates to be, as we say here, a representative of one of the Kremlin towers. For me, the most important thing is that military action should stop.
 
SEBASTIAN:  If President Putin is re-elected for a fifth term, what will you do?
 
NADEZHDIN:  I am absolutely sure that even if Putin will win in this election, the next presidential election will be much closer than six years. I am absolutely sure. And I will proceed with my job.
 
SEBASTIAN (voice-over):  He believes he is already succeeding at one job, exposing the fragility of public support for Putin's war.

COREN:  Well, just ahead, we have rare footage of blindfolded Palestinian detainees in Israeli custody. That report is next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[04:30:00]
 
COREN:  Welcome back to our viewers in the United States, Canada and around the world. I'm Anna Coren. This is "CNN Newsroom."
 
Well, the head of the U.N. agency helping Palestinian civilians in Gaza says the group might have to end operations there if it loses its funding. Well, nine countries stopped funding for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency after accusations by Israel, that a handful of their workers were involved in the October 7th Hamas terror attack. 2 million civilians in Gaza rely on that aid from UNRWA.
 
Well, meanwhile, CNN's Jeremy Diamond has new rare footage of blindfolded Palestinian detainees being held by Israeli authorities.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  While we were in Southern Israel on Saturday morning near the border with Gaza, when we spotted more than two dozen men sitting or kneeling on the cold, wet ground, Israeli soldiers standing guard near them. Now, we now know that those men were Palestinians who were arrested by the Israeli military inside of Gaza and brought to Israel for questioning.
 
Now, these men were blindfolded, they were barefoot. And if you look in this video, you can see their hands are tied behind their backs, and all they are wearing are these disposable white coveralls. Now, it's important to keep in mind that it was about 50 degrees Fahrenheit, 10 degrees Celsius, and quite rainy, when we filmed this video. And the men in this video seem to be physically exhausted. You can see them kind of swaying around, their heads bobbing as they seem to be falling asleep. One man was actually lying on the ground before an Israeli soldier came to rouse him and prop him up.
 
Now, the Israeli military, for its part, said, "The individuals shown on camera are suspected of terrorist activity and were arrested in Gaza and transferred to Israel for further interrogation. Relevant suspects are taken for further questioning within Israel. Individuals who are found not to be taking part in terrorist activities are released back into Gaza as soon as possible."
 
Now, the Israeli military also addressed the condition in which we found these Palestinian detainees. They said that they were wearing these white coveralls because they had been stripped and searched to ensure that neither they nor their clothing had any explosive devices or weapons on them. And they said that they were about to be placed on a heated bus and taken to a detention facility where they would be provided with actual clothing.
 <br>[04:35:00]
 
Now, we weren't able to verify exactly how long these men were sitting outside in the cold because an Israeli soldier came to us and directed us once he saw we were filming to leave the premises. Now, as it relates to this claim by Israel that these men are suspected of terrorist activity, it's important to note that while this is the first time that we have actually been able to directly document the detention of these Palestinian men from Gaza.
 
There has been a lot of footage circulating from Gaza of Palestinian men being detained, and, in many cases, those men actually turn out to be civilians. They are spotted by their relatives or their friends as civilians. And in December, we actually spoke with 10 Palestinian men and boys who had been detained by the Israeli military, held for five days and ultimately released without charge.
 
Now, these men and boys, all of them had swollen wrist. Some of them bruises on their wrists from having their hands tied behind their backs for five days. Now, the Israeli military, for its part, maintains that it treats all of these detainees in accordance with international law.

COREN:  The U.S. National Security Advisor and China's Foreign Minister met in Bangkok this weekend to discuss a myriad of issues. Among them the attacks on ships in the Red Sea by the Iranian backed Houthi rebel group. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan implored China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, to use his country's, "Substantial leverage with Iran to bring an end to the attacks, a source tells CNN.
 
The U.S. also expressed that it is deeply concerned about North Korea's recent weapons testing and the growing relationship between North Korea and Russia. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs says the discussions were candid, substantive and productive.
 
The U.S. says, it's currently reviewing its sanctions policy with Venezuela after the country's Supreme Court upheld an election ban against opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, taking her out of the presidential race this year. Machado's team accuses Nicolas Maduro's government of starting a, "Repressive escalation."
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GERARDO BLYDE, CHIEF NEGOTIATOR FOR VENEZUELA'S OPPOSITION (through translator):  We also demand that the decision made yesterday be reversed because the procedure was violated and the procedure agreed upon was a trial.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COREN:  Both the opposition and the U.S. say Venezuela is repudiating the Barbados agreements signed in October. The country pledged to hold free and fair elections in exchange for sanctions relief. Without offering evidence, a government spokesman accused the opposition of masterminding a coup d'etat that included killing the president. CNN cannot independently verify that claim.
 
The U.S. is also repeating its call to restore democratic order in Haiti where the deployment of an international security force has suffered a setback. On Saturday, a judge in Kenya blocked its government from sending about a thousand police officers there. They were set to lead an international force to restore stability and try to get gang violence under control. The Kenyan judge said the deployment would violate its constitution. But the government plans to appeal. The U.S. which pledged $100 million to the mission says it still supports the project.
 
We're taking a look at the weather across the U.S. The threats of flooding are expected to ramp up on the West Coast as they're winding down in the east. CNN meteorologist Elisa Raffa has the latest.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ELISA RAFFA, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  Our eyes go to the West Coast this week where an atmospheric river could unfold. We're looking at potentially hazardous rainfall where you see those orange dots, Southern Oregon, Northern California over the next couple of days. Look at all the Pacific moisture headed towards the West Coast starts to shift south a little bit as we go into the work week with parts of Northern California feeling the brunt of some of the threat of flash flooding by Tuesday and Wednesday.
 
Here's a look at the series of storms that just continues with the fire hose of the heavy rain Monday morning. Another storm there by Tuesday morning, bringing some of that rain into Seattle and Portland. Then notice that front starts to drape into California. Some of that heavy rain making it as far south as San Francisco. Some of the showers getting in to Southern California. And then look at the white too, you're looking at some snow up in the higher elevations of the Sierra Nevadas.
 
So, we're looking at some four to six inches of rain possible around the Seattle area this weekend. And as we go through the next couple of days, that heavy rain swath works its way south, looking at some two to four-inch totals down to San Francisco. And then again, the spine in the Sierra Nevadas where you can find some of that heavy snow.
 
Here's that flash flood threat as we get towards Wednesday, as that really starts to work its way down the west coast. That yellow is that area where we could find, some flash flooding. ?We're looking at much above average amounts of moisture in the air for this time of year from Eureka down to San Francisco. So, something to watch out for.

All of this coming with some really warm air. Temperatures 10 to 15 to 20 degrees above average in a lot of this area as we go into the work week. Temperatures in the 60s and 70s from San Francisco to Sacramento. Some 60s up in Seattle. We're looking at multiple records possible by Sunday and Monday.

One of the most famous museums in the United States is taking down some of its displays this weekend. Still ahead, a change in the way museums treat indigenous culture. Stay with CNN.

COREN:  Well, the state of Utah has passed a bill banning diversity, equity and inclusion programs commonly known as DEI. Friday, Utah lawmakers voted to effectively prohibit DEI programs from the state's public schools and in government. Republican Governor Spencer Cox is expected to sign the bill into law. It's the latest in a growing movement among conservative lawmakers across the U.S. to ban diversity and equity efforts, which they argue are forms of indoctrination.
 
Well, museums across the U.S. are closing or changing their exhibits, featuring cultural artifacts from Native American tribes. The move is in response to new federal regulations aimed at obtaining consent from, or returning the items to the tribes that consider them sacred.
 
Well, CNN's Gloria Pazmino reports from the world's largest natural history museum about how they're adapting to the changes.

GLORIA PAZMINO, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  So, this is an iconic location, not just here in New York City, but really in much of the world. The American Museum of Natural History is one of the most visited museums in the entire world. It draws about four and a half million people every year. So, the fact that they're making this change really sends a major signal to the rest of the field.
 <br>[04:45:00]
 
And here's what's happening. The museum is closing two major galleries this weekend, including the Eastern Woodlands and the Great Plains Gallery. And what they contain is several Native American cultural items. Some pretty sizable big objects as well, many of them recognizable to anyone who has visited this museum. And they are going to be covering up those display cases.
 
Now, we actually asked to go inside the museum today to try and get some video of these displays that will no longer be viewed by the public. But we were not allowed because part of the whole point here is to no longer show off or display any of these pieces in any way.
 
Now, why is this happening? Well, they're trying to be in compliance with these new federal guidelines, which are now going to require museums and federal agencies to consult and obtain informed consent from descendants, tribes or native Hawaiian organizations before displaying or researching human remains or cultural items.
 
Now, this is actually an update to the 1990 Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act. And this law has been on the books for a while now. But there has been criticism from indigenous people that the experience of the nations and indigenous voices was not centered enough in the process. So, this is an attempt to rectify that. Take a listen to museum -- to the museum president who we spoke with early this morning, describing what is actually behind this effort.
 
SEAN DECATUR, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY:  The intent of the regulations, and I think the intent of this process is to make sure that the voices of indigenous peoples have a say, both in how their stories are told in museums and participate actively in the presentation of their narratives and museums.
 
PAZMINO:  It's not just this museum here in New York City, but also other major organizations around the country, including the Field Museum in Chicago, the museum in Denver, and the Cleveland Museum as well. They have all taken measures to either remove or cover up their exhibits as they begin this process.
 
Now, the question is whether or not some of these exhibits will ever return. And the museum president issued a letter to his staff here yesterday saying that while some items might return, others might not return after they are returned to their rightful owners.

COREN:  There are international calls right now for major museums to give back items that were taken from other cultures years ago. The U.K. says it will send back gold and silver artefacts that were looted from Ghana nearly 150 years ago. Two British museums announced the move is part of a new loan agreement to put the objects on display in the West African country.
 
Museum officials say the artefacts were taken from Ghana during the 19th century. They add that many of the objects, including more than a dozen pieces from the Asante Royal Court, were looted during war. And some of the relics were believed to hold the spirit of past royal figures.
 
Well, just ahead, the FA Cup always produces that magic. We'll hear from the manager who pulled off what football fans are calling the Maidstone Miracle.

COREN:  Another high-profile resignation in European football, FC Barcelona manager Xavi Hernandez has announced he will leave the club at the end of the season despite recently signing a two-year contract extension. Xavi broke the news following the team's five-three loss against Villarreal, and assured fans it's in the best interest of the club.
 
Well, if there's one thing English football fans will tell you, it's to expect the unexpected, especially when it comes to the FA Cup. And that's precisely what happened when sixth-tier Maidstone United defeated Ipswich Town to advance to the final 16. Our Patrick Snell caught up with the manager of the match on his club's thrilling victory.

PATRICK SNELL, CNN WORLD SPORT ANCHOR:  Now, when we say the magic of the cup, we really do mean it, especially on this Saturday. Maidstone United in the sixth-tier of English football, pulling off a historically huge FA Cup upset after beating second-tier Ipswich Town. Maidstone sit almost a hundred places below their opponents in the English pyramid and they take the lead here just before the break when Lamar Reynolds produces the sublime dink over the keeper. His first ever goal for the club. What a moment for the Jamaican player.
 
Ipswich who are battling to return to the premier league levelling, but then Maidstone getting their way with Sam Corne, finishing off a wonderful team move on the road there at Ipswich. Scenes of pure elation for each and every one of those Maidstone players.
 
Remember, they are a semi-professional, non-league team. Their home stadium holds just over 4,000. But now, they're dreaming big as they reach the FA Cup's fifth round. Their ecstatic head coach from Cameroon, George Elokobi. Now get this, the former Wolves player, and just 80 months ago, still a Maidstone player. Someone who's also appeared in the hit "Ted Lasso" series as an opposing player to AFC Richmond on multiple occasions.
 
GEORGE ELOKOBI, MAIDSTONE UNITED MANAGER, PLAYED "FOOTBALLER"ON "TED LASSO":  I doff my hat out to our community. This is for our community, Maidstone. Again, the magic of the FA Cup. We have to believe. This is an inspirational moment for us all, for Cameroon, for Africa, for every young man that has gone through what I've been through in life. Always believe there is hope. Always believe there is faith. Believe in yourself. Always stay humble and respectful. And if you got that, you can create a group like I've done. You can create a club like our football club.
 
SNELL:  What a special story. He is as well, as I mentioned, he's even played a role on the hit series "Ted Lasso." He certainly brings that joy, that spirit in real life too.
 <br>[04:55:00] ELOKOBI:  Firstly, "Ted Lasso" is a brilliant show. When I had a call -- when I got a call, I wasn't the manager then. So, I was using some of my spare time to explore, was around, explore some of my strengths. I'm a man of many talents. And when the opportunity came to appear in that series, I jumped onto it. It was a fantastic experience to be casted as one of Man City's player at the time.
 
Also, got a chance to obviously meet Pep. We did some shootings down at the Etihad. I know I've played there before as a Premier League player, but this time I came in as a little bit of an actor, if you want to say -- put it that way. It was a fantastic experience, but also learned a lot from it, from the actors. And I met some incredible people in that process, made some connections. And you never know, one day I may find myself in Hollywood, right?
 
SNELL:  And our very special thanks indeed to George there. What a wonderful story. And our congrats to all at Maidstone United. And who knows, he may just meet up with Pep Guardiola and Man City when the draw is made later on Sunday. But for now, it's right back to you.

Well, the men's singles final of the Australian Open is in the second set right now in Melbourne.

Sinner defeated defending champ Novak Djokovic in the semifinals and is hoping to nab his first Grand Slam title.
 
And in the women's final yesterday, Aryna Sabalenka defended her crown, beating China's Zheng Qinwen in straight sets. Sabalenka is the first woman since Serena Williams in 2007 to win the Open final without dropping a single set.
