(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ERICA HILL, CNN HOST, CONNECT THE WORLD: You're looking at the scene in Sicily at this hour, of course, 03:00 p.m. there. Rescue teams now in their 
 
 third day of searching for the missing passengers from that sunken yacht. Thanks for joining me this hour. It is 09:00 a.m. here in New York City. 
 
 I'm Erica Hill in for Becky Anderson. This is "Connect the World".
 
Also happening over the next two hours, rousing speeches from the Obamas at the Democratic National Convention, taking aim squarely at Donald Trump as 
 
 they rally for Kamala Harris. Hope for a ceasefire in Gaza fading after Israel's Prime Minister bluntly warns there might not be a deal. This 
 
 despite continued efforts from world leaders, including U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken. And Argentina quarantines a cargo ship as concerns 
 
 grow over the outbreak of Mpox.
 
We're also keeping a watch, of course, on stock market futures. Markets here in New York City open just about 30 minutes from now. Little bit of 
 
 green there for you to start your Wednesday on the East Coast of the U.S. we'll keep an eye on that. 
 
Meantime, all focus on politics here in the United States. And it is a big, big night for Governor Tim Walz, who, of course, will be the headliner 
 
 tonight. He is Kamala Harris's running mate taking the stage in Chicago. Former President Bill Clinton also on deck Tuesday night, providing a night 
 
 of Democratic star party at the party's national convention.
 
And a little Stevie Wonder there for you. Former First Lady Michelle Obama, getting a raucous reception, really bringing down the House as she made her 
 
 impassioned case for Kamala Harris to be the next president. Her husband, the 44th President of the United States, focusing on themes of unity and 
 
 hope as the driving forces to get Harris elected. 
 
But both Obamas really taking the gloves off last night and hitting back at the man who succeeded Barack Obama in the White House and who has attacked 
 
 them for years. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MICHELLE OBAMA, FORMER U.S. FIRST LADY: For years, Donald Trump did everything in his power to try to make people fear us. See his limited, 
 
 narrow view of the world, made him feel threatened by the existence of two hard work and highly educated, successful people who happen to be black. 
 
 Who's going to tell him that the job he's currently seeking might just be one of those black jobs.
 
BARACK OBAMA, 44TH U.S. PRESIDENT: There's the childish nicknames, the crazy conspiracy theories, this weird obsession with crowd sizes. We do not 
 
 need four more years of bluster and bumbling and chaos. We have seen that movie before, and we all know that the sequel is usually worse.
 
America is ready for a new chapter. America is ready for a better story. We are ready for a President Kamala Harris.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HILL: A lot of energy, a lot of electricity as I have heard it described from multiple people this morning in that room last night. Stephen 
 
 Collinson joining me now from the convention in Chicago. As I mentioned, a lot of people using the word electrifying in terms of what they felt in 
 
 that convention hall. 
 
I think what was also striking to a lot of people is that for years of leaning perhaps on the words of Michelle Obama, when she said, if they go 
 
 low, we go high, it was almost giving permission to Democrats to just fight back.
 
STEPHEN COLLINSON, CNN POLITICS SENIOR REPORTER: Yeah, that was right, Erica. I think one way to understand the tumultuous politics of the last 
 
 decade and a half or so is as a struggle between Obamaism and Trumpism. Obamaism appealing to the increasingly diverse nature of the United States 
 
 with a younger, more diverse coalition.
 
And Trump almost a reaction to that kind of politics, pushing back against what some people see as a lessening of the traditional white culture of the 
 
 United States. So, we saw that playing out. The Obamas remain even eight years nearly after they left the White House, the most strident Democratic 
 
 opponents to Former President Donald Trump.
 
And I think a lot of the language that they coined last night is what we're going to see playing out over the next few months in the rhetoric of Kamala 
 
 Harris, Tim Walz and the other Democrats. So, they were really not just attacking Trump last night. They were setting the agenda for the rest of 
 
 this campaign. 
 <br>[09:05:00]
 
HILL: And in terms of that agenda, I'm going to steal your words here, my friend, because, as you said, so well in your piece overnight. Now it's 
 
 about right turning that joy into votes, that enthusiasm, that electricity, that excitement that we're seeing there in Chicago, of course, with the 
 
 party faithful, it is now on to Kamala Harris and Tim Walz to move that into actual, tangible support. Is there a plan for that?
 
COLLINSON: There are certainly plans at the grassroots levels to exploit this massive surge of enthusiasm that we've seen. People who are involved 
 
 in the campaigns at those levels, in the swing states, they're saying to me that they have really got a boost over the last month. It's completely 
 
 transformed the campaign. 
 
People who perhaps didn't see a reason to vote, who felt disconnected from the process and now seeing the stakes if they're Democrats on why they need 
 
 to get to the polls in November? Michelle Obama led the crowd last night in a refrain of, do something, do something. 
 
She was pleading with Democratic voters not to be complacent, because often when you're in a convention, and we've been in this almost Democratic 
 
 bubble for the last month, as this new ticket has unfolded, it can seem like the outcome is preordained, that Democrats are going to win this 
 
 election, but it is going to be a very close election. 
 
Donald Trump is exceedingly strong in some of these swing states, notwithstanding the fact that Harris has improved upon Former President Joe 
 
 Biden's position and Trump still leads in most polls on the two key issues in this election, the economy and immigration. So, Democrats have a great 
 
 deal of work to do. Tim Walz will begin that the Vice-Presidential Nominee with his speech tonight.
 
HILL: Stephen Collinson, great to have you this morning. Thank you. We're keeping a close watch on developments in the Middle East, where U.S. 
 
 Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, is leaving once again with no deal for a ceasefire and hostage release. 
 
This follows, of course, his most recent visit, where he was in Egypt, Qatar and Israel. Blinken saying late Tuesday that Israel had in fact 
 
 agreed to the withdrawal terms in this latest proposal hammered out by mediators.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: The United States does not accept any long-term occupation of Gaza by Israel. More specifically, the 
 
 agreement is very clear on the schedule and the locations of IDF withdrawals from Gaza. And Israel has agreed to that.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HILL: It's important to point out, though that also on Tuesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly told hostage families Israel will 
 
 not leave the Philadelphi Corridor that of course, is the narrow strip between Gaza and Egypt, which has been a real sticking point in these 
 
 negotiations. 
 
Nic Robertson joining me now from Tel Aviv with more on this. The messaging from the U.S. and Israel appears to be out of sync, and this is not the 
 
 first time that we've seen that, Nic?
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: It's not the first time -- you know -- those words spoken by Secretary Blinken there came right at 
 
 the end of the trip the day before he was here in Israel, and he really thought that he got an agreement from the prime minister. 
 
And as you've just said, the prime minister spoke to a small group of hostage families who are supporters this particular group, the supporters 
 
 of the prime minister. And he told them that he wasn't going to leave -- the Israeli troops weren't going to leave the Philadelphi Corridor, the 
 
 border between Gaza and Egypt, because it's a strategic asset for the government. 
 
They think that if they're not on the border there, then Hamas will dig tunnels under the border and resupply and rebuild its military. That's why 
 
 he wants to hold on to it. But it's not, as you heard from Secretary Blinken there the agreement that he understood that Prime Minister 
 
 Netanyahu had agreed to. 
 
They met 2.5 hours, one-on-one, face-to-face. I mean, it was really a lot of time to try and hammer out an understanding. And actually, the hostage 
 
 families, according to them, had asked Netanyahu why he had given into Secretary of State, Antony Blinken? And he said, well, what? Why -- 
 
 according to the hostage families, he replied, why do you think it was me giving in to him and not the other way around? 
 
So that's part of the sort of picture of why these current rounds of diplomatic efforts may be, may be stalling out because it's not clear that 
 
 Prime Minister Netanyahu is fully committed and that's something that has always worried Hamas, and Hamas has already said they haven't rejected this 
 
 bridging proposal from the United States yet.
 
But they've already said it sides too much with Israel. They've indicated they're not inclined and not inclined to accept it, but they haven't 
 
 rejected. And that's where things actually stand at a technical level, if you will, waiting for Hamas to accept that bridging proposal. 
 <br>[09:10:00]
 
There are some technical level talks we understand that are sort of supposed to be underway right now. But what those technical talks are about 
 
 are about implementing parts of the bridging proposal, and if both sides haven't agreed to it yet or are questioning the content of it, therefore 
 
 the picture looks the way that it does right now.
 
That it's -- there is a lot of concern around right now that this deal may be foundering. It's not founded yet. But despite the huge efforts by 
 
 Secretary Blinken, hasn't made it over, over the next line of hurdles, if you will.
 
HILL: Nic appreciate the update. Thank you. In Iran, that nation's pledged retaliation against Israel for the killing of a top Hamas political leader 
 
 must be, quote, carefully calibrated. That's according to Iran's permanent mission to the UN which tells CNN in a statement it wants to avoid 
 
 adversely impacting a possible ceasefire deal. 
 
And all of this, of course, comes just a day after the country's foreign ministry about a deal was unrelated to Iran's plans for Israel. The Middle 
 
 East, of course, has been on high alert since last month's assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. It's important to note, Israel has neither 
 
 confirmed nor denied any role in Haniyeh's death. 
 
CNN's Senior International Correspondent, Fred Pleitgen is at the Iranian parliament in Tehran. So, I know you have been given some rare access there 
 
 inside Iran's parliament Fred. What are you hearing? What is the feeling in there, in terms of what a potential response to Israel could be and when it 
 
 may come?
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hi, there Erica. Well, we just left the Iran parliament, actually, because that session is 
 
 over. What was going on today is actually quite memorable here for the Iranians, because now the government of the newly elected President, Masoud 
 
 Pezeshkian, has now been approved by parliament.
 
The transition of power here in Iran after, of course, the president of this country was killed in a helicopter crash a couple of months ago, that 
 
 is now complete as well, in this situation of big turmoil in the Middle East, where, of course, exactly what you were talking about. The situation 
 
 in the Middle East very much on the minds of the parliamentarians there, the possible retaliation, first and foremost. 
 
Now you read part of that statement that the UN mission of Iran gave to CNN earlier today. I want to read a little more of it they said quote, 
 
 furthermore, Iran's response must be carefully calibrated to avoid any possible adverse impact that could potentially influence of a perspective 
 
 ceasefire. 
 
So, the Iranians are now saying that a ceasefire for them is directly linked to their possible retaliation against the Israelis. The Iranians 
 
 also not saying what that retaliation is going to look like. However, I was able to speak to the former head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, 
 
 and he said he believes what Iran needs now is deterrence. Let's listen in.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MOHSEN REZAEE, FORMER COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, ISLAMIC REVOLUTIONARY GUARD CORPS: The occupying power of Jerusalem is a regime that will continue its 
 
 evil acts if it does not receive a harsh response. Also, the United States and Europe have not been able to control this regime.
 
PLEITGEN: How does Iran find the right measure to prevent this from turning into a bigger war in the region?
 
REZAEE: We have investigated the possible repercussions, and we will not let Netanyahu, who is sinking in a swamp, save him himself. The Iranian 
 
 actions would be very calculated.
 
PLEITGEN: The United States has threatened Iran, though, with what they call cataclysmic consequences if Iran strikes Israel. What's your reaction 
 
 to that? 
 
REZAEE: The U.S. is highly vulnerable to Iran. The commanders of the U.S. military are aware of Iran's capabilities; therefore, they will avoid 
 
 taking action against Iran. On the other hand, the U.S. is facing problems regarding their own defense costs. 
 
There has to be a ceasefire in Gaza soon. The United States and Israel should not repeat their mistakes. If in the first weeks of the Gaza war, 
 
 the United States has stopped Israel and Netanyahu the war would not extend. So, the main element of the extension of the war are the U.S. and 
 
 Israel. The more this war extends, the more the United States will be damaged.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
PLEITGEN: So that was Mohsen Rezaee, the Former Head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Some of the things that he was saying is what we 
 
 heard from parliamentarians today, as well as the Iranians, are saying they do want a ceasefire.
 
For them they believe that a ceasefire is absolutely necessary in Gaza, but they're not very optimistic that one is going to happen, because they don't 
 
 trust the Israelis. Obviously, they don't trust the U.S. either. 
 
But I think the key thing that we've taken out of the last couple of hours Erica, that's really a new development here, is that the Iranians are now 
 
 saying that they don't want to do anything as far as their retaliation is concerned, that could have adverse effects on any sort of ceasefire 
 
 negotiations Erica.
 
HILL: Yeah, that is certainly an important development, and important to highlight it agreed. Fred, thank you. A specialized divers have now began 
 
 searching inside the luxury yacht which sank in violent weather off Sicily earlier this week. 
 <br>[09:15:00]
 
A dive team is looking for those who are missing, which should include two Americans and four Britons, among them British Tech Tycoon Mike Lynch and 
 
 his 18-year-old daughter. What has been tough, though, for these crews is not only the depth of the wreck, but also furniture and other obstructions 
 
 on board that vessel. 
 
There is some newly released grainy image you can see in this. This is from early Monday morning, which shows what appears to be the moments just 
 
 before that yacht sank, as this sudden storm whipped up and hit the vessel. CNN's Barbie Nadeau joining us now from Porticello in Sicily.
 
So, some of the challenges, and you had talked to us a little bit about this, is that the vessel itself is intact, so harder to get in there, get 
 
 through the vessel, as well as its depth. Where do things stand on day three now?
 
BARBIE LATZA NADEAU, CNN REPORTER: Yeah, you know, I mean, they're still really working very hard to try to find the bodies they believe are inside 
 
 the vessel. Now, we've just seen a shift change, basically behind me, the divers came in, and a new set of divers, or different set of divers, have 
 
 gone back out to this area right behind us here. 
 
Now what we understand is that they have been able to get inside and look through at least one of the suites. There were six sleeping suites. Didn't 
 
 find anybody -- any bodies in there. They're going to keep going, though, you know, there's a lot of debris.
 
And they also said that because of the way this vessel is placed on the seabed, it's basically on the -- you know the main opening. So, they're 
 
 going to have to try to figure out what they need to do to try to access that and eventually get those bodies up. They're not talking at all about 
 
 bringing up the boat, at least not yet. But they're still searching around the clock, they say until they find these six missing people.
 
HILL: Barbie there live in Porticello for us. Thank you. Still to come here on "Connect the World" a top Chinese official meeting with Russian leaders 
 
 as Beijing shrugs off Western criticism of its Kremlin ties amid the war in Ukraine.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HILL: As Kyiv presses forward with its incursion into Russia. Moscow's Mayor says Ukrainian military forces just launched one of their largest 
 
 drone attacks on Russia's capital. And as for that push, meantime, into Russia by Ukraine, this is some new video into CNN from Russia's Kursk 
 
 Region, where Ukrainian special forces attacked temporary Russian pontoon bridges on Monday.
 
Russia responding by destroying the barrage of drones which had been aimed at Moscow and also the Kursk and Belgorod regions. Russia also says it is 
 
 launching fresh drone attacks of its own over Kyiv and other Ukrainian regions CNN's Clare Sebastian, following all these developments for us from 
 
 London. 
 
So, Clare Ukrainian Commander I know, told CNN, Russian forces in that Kursk Region are battling hard against the incursion, but says Ukraine's 
 
 troops are still making gains. Those gains have been a little bit more incremental, as I understand it, over the last couple of days. But is it 
 
 still accurate to say that they are in fact gains?
 
CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, I think it's accurate to say that Ukraine still has the initiative there. It is still attempting to push 
 
 forward. 
 <br>[09:20:00]
 
Certainly, the video that you just showed -- shows with just how much force they are attempting to do that and in a strategic way as well, right? We 
 
 saw them blow up several bridges over that Seine River as it's called, a critical Russian supply line. Now, Russia has come in and built temporary 
 
 pontoons, and Ukraine is going after them as well.
 
But we're now over two weeks in the element of surprise has gone. And we do see signs that Russia is starting to organize its resistance a bit better. 
 
 This same commander that you referenced said that they bring in more artillery. They're starting to storm Ukrainian positions are not he said, 
 
 surrendering in the hundreds anymore, although some he claims, are still surrendering when attacked. 
 
So, it looks like possibly a new phase in this conflict, although obviously we still see Russia presented with, in President Biden's words, this 
 
 dilemma right of how to allocate their forces, whether to prioritize keeping hold of gains in Donetsk and moving forward, or trying to push the 
 
 Ukrainians out. Of course, it seems at this point they haven't fully decided to really focus on Kursk.
 
HILL: So, as we look at all this too, there's also this meeting between a top Chinese leader and Russian leaders in Moscow today. What more do we 
 
 know about that meeting itself?
 
SEBASTIAN: Yeah, this is the Chinese Premier, essentially the number two official Lee Chang. And this was a long-planned meeting. It's sort of an 
 
 annual thing that the two heads of government meet. But I think, look, this does help with Russian efforts, certainly to present to the people in 
 
 Russia that it's business as usual, that the events in Kursk isolated a terror attack, as President Putin has repeatedly called them.
 
And that they are carrying on with scheduled events. This is, in fact, the third big international meeting that Putin will have had since the August 
 
 6th incursion. I think worth noting as well that look, if you see that Russia has really two key allies in the world as it tries to sort of build 
 
 up this axis against what it sees as Western dominance. 
 
They are China and India. And Prime Minister Modi of India is actually scheduled to go to Kyiv on Friday. So, this provides a sort of useful 
 
 counter programming for Moscow on that score as well Erica.
 
HILL: Clare Sebastian with the updates for us. Appreciate it. Thank you. In Argentina, the government, they're ordering a cargo ship quarantined after 
 
 reports that one of its crew members has shown signs of Mpox. This is the Liberian flagged ship. It's there, docked in -- anchored rather in 
 
 Argentinian waters. 
 
Just last week, of course, the World Health Organization declared the virus a public health emergency. CNN's Ivan Perez Sarmenti is following all of 
 
 this for us from Buenos Aires. So, what more do we know about this ship, and is it just one passenger who is of concern at this point, or one crew 
 
 member rather?
 
IVAN PEREZ SARMENTI, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Hi, how are you? Well, health authorities here in Argentina announced on Tuesday they will inspect and 
 
 quarantine a cargo ship in its wars after a crew member from India showed symptoms of Mpox. It is not confirmed yet, and it is unlikely that this 
 
 will be the case. 
 
Anyways, inspection is carried out by the border health service, and it's planned that the medical personnel board the ship and inspect whether the 
 
 crew members symptoms are comparable with Mpox. If they are they will take samples for study, but in the meantime, the entire crew will be quarantined 
 
 until the results of the tests are available according to the health ministry statement.
 
So far, authorities have not said how many people are on board this ship named Ina-Lotte with a Liberian flag. It comes from Brazil, where it last 
 
 docked at Santos Port and was sailing to San Lorenzo Port here in Argentina. Now it is close to this port where it is not allowed to dock. 
 
Previously, between June and July, it was in Russia, and it has not had any port calls out of Europe since at least before April. According to the 
 
 health ministry, so far, Argentina has not registered any cases of the clade 1V variant of Mpox. 
 
Nevertheless, on Friday, local authorities called for strengthening borderline health control measures all over the country, two days after the 
 
 World Health Organization declared this public health emergency of international concern due to an outbreak of Mpox in part of Africa. 
 
But let me say too that all Latin American countries, such as Colombia, El Salvador, Venezuela, and Mexico, have announced similar surveillance 
 
 measures. But for now, we'll have to wait for the results, but it could take up to 48 hours.
 
HILL: All right. Well, we'll be waiting then for those next two days. Ivan, appreciate it. Thank you. Stay tuned, "Connect the World" continues in just 
 
 a moment. Going to fit in a quick break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:25:00]
 
HILL: Welcome back. I'm Erica Hill, joining you from New York City today. This is "Connect the World". Donald Trump says he is open to Robert F 
 
 Kennedy Jr., playing a role in his potential second administration, if, and here's the if, the independent candidate decides to drop out of the race 
 
 and endorsed Trump. All of this, as RFK Junior's running mate acknowledged in a new podcast interview, that is actually a very real possibility.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
NICOLE SHANAHAN, INDEPDENTED VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Or we walk away right now and join forces with Donald Trump.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HILL: So could it happen? This as the battleground state tour continues for Trump and his running mate J.D. Vance, the two set to make a campaign stop 
 
 together in North Carolina in the coming hours, where they're expected to really hone in on national security.
 
CNN's Alayna Treene joining us now from Washington with more on that interview with Nicole Shanahan really getting a lot of attention. So, you 
 
 know, if, if, if they decide to drop out, put their weight behind Donald Trump, that could be a good thing potentially for that Trump ticket. How 
 
 much so? What's the sense of the impact that could have?
 
ALAYNA TREENE, CNN REPORTER: It's hard to say, because it's been so fascinating to watch RFK Junior's candidacy, and I've done a lot of 
 
 reporting on this to see, does he hurt Donald Trump more? Does he help Donald Trump more verse then Joe Biden and now Kamala Harris, and it's been 
 
 a mixed bag. 
 
There's a lot of people that I've spoken with, including people on the Trump campaign who have said this, but also -- you know more strategists in 
 
 general for both sides, who say it's very unclear who RFK Jr., could hurt more with his own candidacy and if he moves ahead with being an 
 
 independent, who could get on the ballot. 
 
But I will say Trump, for his part, seemed open to the idea of him dropping out and not only endorsing him, but also potentially serving in his own 
 
 future administration. Take a listen to what he told our own Kristen Holmes about it.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I would love that endorsement, because I've always liked him.
 
KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Would you also consider putting him in the administration? 
 
TRUMP: You're asking me a very unusual question. I haven't been asked that question yet. I like him a lot. I respect him a lot. 
 <br>[09:30:00]
 
I probably would if something like that would happen. He's very different kind of a guy, very smart guy. And yeah, I would be honored by that 
 
 endorsement.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TREENE: Now, Erica, it is interesting that Donald Trump said this. First of all, it's the first time he's kind of went so far in saying how much he 
 
 would welcome RFK Jr., into his own potential administration. But also remember, RFK Jr., has a lot of progressive policies.
 
And Donald Trump and his team have long been trying to label him as a radical liberal, as someone who is super progressive, even more so than Joe 
 
 Biden and now Harris. That is the same lines that they have used for months now in their oppo against RFK Jr.
 
So, kind of a weird turnaround for Donald Trump there. And I also -- you know I think be interesting to see if other Republicans would be so 
 
 accepting to having him be a key part of not only the Trump campaign, but also in a future administration. 
 
Now, I also just want to quickly, we actually just heard from J.D. Vance of course, Trump's running me this morning on Fox &amp; Friends. He was asked 
 
 about this comment. I'm going to just read for you a little bit of what he said. I don't think we have it written up yet, because he just made these 
 
 remarks. 
 
But Vance said that he thinks that having RFK Jr., endorsed Donald Trump would, quote, be good for the campaign. He went on to say that his pitch to 
 
 him until a lot of his voters would be the Democratic Party of my grandparents that supported his Uncle John F. Kennedy for president has 
 
 been completely abandoned by the modern leadership of the Democratic Party. 
 
Now I think -- you know a lot of people would question that last line from Vance. But Vance is backing Donald Trump on this saying -- you know I think 
 
 we should welcome him, and it would show a line of people leaving the Democrats, particularly given he is a Kennedy and joining the Republican 
 
 ticket. 
 
But also, worth noting in all of this Erica that RFK Jr., himself had said that he would potentially consider dropping out and endorsing Kamala Harris 
 
 and her administration. And so -- you know -- they didn't seem as open to that idea, but it looks like he's kind of playing both sides here.
 
HILL: I was just going to say there are some questions about whether he is trying to dangle a carrot and seeing which campaign actually bites, as he 
 
 is apparently also angling for a role, perhaps in a future administration, whoever may end up putting that administration together. Alayna, appreciate 
 
 it. Thank you.

HILL: The famous fedora worn by Harrison Ford for Indiana Jones in the Temple of Doom, just sold for $630,000 at auction. The rabbit felt hat was 
 
 made with a more tapered crown specifically for the second movie in the series. It is in good conditions, but perhaps not surprisingly, it just 
 
 shows signs of wear. 
 
It was, of course, used in several key scenes, including that memorable minecart chase. Several fedoras were actually made for the film, but this

ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Lights, camera, fan, smile. With August slipping away, Taylor Swift's European Tour is coming to a 
 
 close, leaving behind wind bull profits. Swift has dazzled fans in Dublin, shaken it off in Warsaw and styled it out in Stockholm, all to the tune of 
 
 millions of dollars in sales and a boost to retail, travel and hospitality businesses.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: She's got to be tired, because if I am, she's going to be tired too. 
 
STEWART: How much Taylor Swift have you played in the last few days?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh, hours. My whole life.
 
STEWART (voice-over): In the UK, the average fan is spending $1,100 all in. According to analysis from Barclays Bank, they estimate a $1.27 billion 
 
 boost for the British economy. Gelsenkirchen in Germany hosted almost as many Swifties as the city's population, giving the hotel sector a swift 
 
 lift. Fans say it's all worth the hype. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I spent a lot of money; it is not good.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: -- spent it last year. So, it's like it's not real. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: True. True.
 
STEWART: You forgotten all about it?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yeah.
 
STEWART: I love that. 
 
STEWART (voice-over): Eras is the highest grossing tour of all time, according to Pollstar, eclipsing $1 billion in sales before the 2024 
 
 concerts in South America, Asia and Europe even began. And it's had no shortage of viral moments in Europe, from celebrity appearances to fans 
 
 without tickets hammering to get a view.
 
And the guy on the chiefs, London had to bolster security after three Vienna shows were cancelled due to a terror threat. But even then, Swifties 
 
 in the Austrian City rallied with fans singing her music in the streets. After more than 40 sold out shows across Europe Miss Americana is heading 
 
 back to North America. Swift gets a two-month break until she hits Florida, Louisiana and later Canada.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Like the adrenaline probably keeps her going. I'm sure when she finishes the tour, she'll sleep for about two years.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yeah, she must be knackered, like they say in the UK.
 
STEWART (voice-over): But for now, it's so long. London. Anna Stewart, CNN, London.

HILL: Anna Stewart, with all the clever, little, Swifty references in there, I heard what you did there. A Pink River dolphin was rescued and 
 
 returned to the wild after becoming stranded on a river bank in Central Bolivia. Take a look at this. 
 
Villagers actually worked with local authorities. They want to help get the dolphin to deeper, safer waters. Conservationists consider these dolphins a 
 
 particularly vulnerable species, susceptible to the impacts of climate change, deforestation and pollution. 
 
And how about this? A limited-edition Doritos, Minis, Cool Ranch, Zero Gravity Tortilla Chips say that five times fast is getting ready to zoom 
 
 into outer space. The chips which were created for consuming in zero gravity will travel on the SpaceX Polaris Dawn mission scheduled for later 
 
 this month.

Doritos partnering with St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital in the U.S. for that release, and they'll donate $500,000 to the hospital. If you would 
 
 like a -- you can get one. You're just going to have to shell out $200 to the hospital again going to a good cause, and that's on a special Doritos 
 
 branded page. 
 
The world's top ranked men's tennis player getting some welcome news just days before the start of the US Open. Jannik Sinner will not be suspended 
 
 after testing positive for a banned substance earlier this year. Patrick Snell joining me now, I guess that is a major relief.
 
PATRICK SNELL, CNN WORLD SPORTS: Yeah, this is -- this is a very, very high-profile story, Erica in the world of tennis and beyond really. Just to 
 
 reset briefly for our viewers, Sinner won his first Grand Slam singles title early on this year at the Aussie Open in Melbourne. 
 
And we now know Erica that less than 24 hours after winning in Cincinnati on Monday, his fifth title of the year, the 23-year-old avoiding a 
 
 suspension despite twice testing positive for a prohibited substance. This was back in March during the Indian Wells Tournament.
 
Sinner, saying he wants to put what he calls this challenging and deeply unfortunate period behind me. On "World Sport" just a few moments from now, 
 
 how Sinner successfully appeal the provisional suspension which led to him being able to continue to play, and what other players as well, Erica are 
 
 saying about it all? Some high profile players with some very high-profile opinions as well. We'll have that in just a few moments for now, though, 
 
 it's back to you.
 
HILL: Yeah, I would imagine that's what I call one hell of a tease, my friend, because I'm definitely sticking around for that story. We'll see 
 
 you in just a few moments on "World Sport" after a quick break. And I'll be back with you at the top of the hour with more "Connect the World" 
 
 including the latest on that search for the missing on board that yacht which sunk, of course, off the Coast of Sicily. Stay with us.
