PAULA REID, CNN HOST: New Year's Eve in Paris. Let's watch the fireworks celebration there. 
 
(FIREWORKS DISPLAY)
 
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
 
(MUSIC)
 <br>[18:06:57]
 
REID: A spectacular light display in the City of Lights. 
 
I want to bring in my friend and colleague, Harry Enten. 
 
Harry, this is amazing. 
 
HARRY ENTEN, CNN SENIOR DATA REPORTER: Oh, my God. I have to get myself over to Europe, France, Paris. My God, I am psyched, and I also have to update my playlist because the music they're playing makes me want to swim, run, jump, dance into 2024 like nobody's business, Paula. This is amazing, right? 
 
REID: Absolutely. I think they started off with some Madonna. We're moving through that just more modern pop, techno. It's spectacular. 
 
Look at the choreography, the music, the trees, the fireworks. I don't know how they did it. 
 
ENTEN: I don't know what they're doing over there, but we have to import it over to the United States. They have the fireworks and the Eiffel Tower and the lights and the music and they've got it all. 
 
As I said, I am so psyched. Normally I'm the type of guy who wants to go to bed early, but given this, I am psyched, ready and pumped for 2024. 
 
REID: First of all, I don't believe that you're the kind of guy who wants to go to bed early and not go out and party, but I will say, Paris they are preparing for the Olympics so they're expecting a lot of these kinds of celebrations and it's just such an amazing display. ENTEN: It is something else. You know, I always loved watching the
 
 different countries go through the new year because I'm always picking up ideas of what I will do in the next year and while I can't replicate Paris maybe for July 4th I might get a fireworks display like this and try to duplicate this because I'm getting ideas going through my head and this is the idea that I want to use for 2024. 
 
REID: OK, Harry, I think that's a terrible idea. I do not trust you to implement something like this, that is why there are so many restrictions on fireworks because of people like you who want to do things like this. I mean, this is -- we'll leave this to Paris. 
 
I think we also have live pictures of Berlin, and we want to take you there to see how they are ringing in 2024. 
 
(FIREWORKS DISPLAY)
 <br>[18:11:07]
 
REID: Another beautiful display, dignified.
 
Harry, what is your take on Berlin? 
 
ENTEN: You know, the 6:00 p.m. poll closings, I have my rankings out. Paris is number one. Berlin is number two. Look, fireworks, they're fine. They're good, but it lacked the soundtrack of Paris and lacked the elegance of Paris. 
 
I am not necessarily so surprised and I don't necessarily think of Berlin and think of parties. So, Paris remains my number one. 
 
REID: I think that's fair. I also think the camera angle. I get the sense there's more going on, but I mean, Paris probably impossible to top. 
 
But I am told we have pictures of Warsaw. So, we can take a look at those and see how they're ringing in 2024. 
 
(INAUDIBLE)
 
REID: So no sound, but this looks pretty spectacular, fireworks, some choreography here. Harry, what's your take? 
 
ENTEN: All right. I have a new, updated rankings. Paris is still number one, but Warsaw is moving into number two. This is a much better display than Berlin was, let's be honest. Yes, I know camera angles and maybe the camera adds five pounds to Berlin's sort of parade. 
 
But the fact is Berlin is number three, Warsaw putting in a strong effort, it's very tough, very tough to top Paris, but Warsaw is giving Paris a good run for its money. 
 
REID: I mean, Paris was absolutely incredible and I can't wait to see what they do with the Olympics based on that. Berlin, beautiful. Warsaw also beautiful. And at the end of the hour, get ready because we have Anderson Cooper and Andy Cohen live from times square to ring in the New Year here in the U.S. it all starts at 8:00 here on CNN and we will have a live report next because Richard Quest is standing by in the crowd. We'll talk to him when we come right back. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:17:03]
 
REID: We are counting down to the start of the New Year here in the United States with just hours until the ball drops in New York City's Times Square. 
 
I am here with my colleague Harry Enten, and let's check in with CNN's Richard Quest who is watching all of the action down there in Times Square. 
 
All right, Richard. We are less than six hours away from 2024. It looks like you added a hat. Is it getting a little cold? How are things down there? 
 
RICHARD QUEST, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It is 41 degrees Fahrenheit which is 5 degrees Celsius. So we've had much, much, much worse. This is almost tropical. What's happened in the last half hour? You see the ball right at the top there. 
 
Now it's red, and they send the ball up to the top with fireworks and now there's a Chinese dance, and that ball will stay there until one minute until midnight when it will make its process down as we count in New Year. 
 
They say it's up to a million people in Times Square all of the way up towards Central Park. Let's go and see some of them. 
 
Hello! Oh, lord, they are quiet tonight. You're got a book. What have you brought? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We both have a book. 
 
QUEST: Oh, good luck, been a lot reading.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We are half way through the book already. 
 
QUEST: Where did you come from? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Marietta, Georgia. 
 
QUEST: And what time did you get here? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Ten a.m.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yeah, 10:00 a.m.
 
QUEST: Ten a.m.
 
If you want to get into the square, this is pretty much the time. 
 
That's a very warm coat. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you. 
 
QUEST: Where are you from? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Nashville. 
 
QUEST: Well, of course. Nashville, they wear that sort of thing. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm from Colombia.
 
QUEST: Sorry?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm from Colombia. I'm very happy still here. It's the first time.
 
QUEST: Colombia. Excellent. Well done. 
 
Now they have hours to wait, Paula and Harry, but if you look at this side, we have one group. On this side, we have another, and we can keep them warm. We can almost conduct our own New Year's Eve orchestra. Are you ready? 
 
CROWD: Yes!
 
QUEST: Our own New Year's Eve orchestra. 
 
(CHEERS)
 
QUEST: There, you see? We're already to the New Year spirit here in Times Square and there's not a drop of alcohol anywhere to be seen, at least not that we can see -- Paula. 
 
REID: That is amazing, you carry that off, even without alcohol, Keith Lockhart, eat your heart out. 
 
All right. Richard -- Harry has questions for you, too. 
 
Harry, what have you got? 
 
ENTEN: All right. I've got one question for you, Richard, and one question for the crowd. My question for you is, how did a New Year's in Times Square compare to the New Year's back in England? That's my question for you.
 
And then afterwards, I want you to ask each side of the crowd which one of them is more looking forward to the New Year.
 <br>[08:20:05]
 
And we will judge the winner based upon how loud they can get. 
 
QUEST: My gosh, you don't want much, do you? For me, I've been in Times Square at New Year's Eve for the last 20-
 
 odd years. I think there is -- the London's nice, the fireworks in London with the London Eye along the River Thames are spectacular, but this has a feeling of majesty. When you're here, "Imagine" and then the New Year and then we all start singing "New York, New York." it brings tears to even this cynical, skeptical miserable old goat that you're looking at. 
 
Now as to your question, all right. What was the question again, Harry? Sorry. 
 
ENTEN: The question was which side your left or your right is more looking towards the New Year and we will judge it based upon which one is able to shout the loudest. 
 
QUEST: All right. So the question is which side is more looking forward to New Year and 2024? Is it this side?
 
(CHEERS)
 
QUEST: Or is it this side? 
 
(CHEERS)
 
QUEST: Right. We'll try that again because it was pathetic from both. Is it this side? 
 
(CHEERS)
 
QUEST: Or this side? 
 
(CHEERS)
 
QUEST: All right. Which one do you think one? 
 
ENTEN: I feel like it's camera right. Camera right won, that is the side to your left, if I understand my direction. But I'm interested. You're on the ground, Richard. Who did you think won? 
 
QUEST: Oh, who do I think won I have to be with these people for the rest of the night and therefore to be nice to me. 
 
I think it was a draw.
 
(CHEERS)
 
QUEST: I think I just gave the worst answer. Now I think I pissed everyone off and they're more pissed off on the other side. 
 
REID: You have six more hours with those folks, Richard. I think you did the right thing. 
 
People seem pretty chill there. Are they going to make it till midnight? 
 
QUEST: Oh, yeah. Come with me. Look, I'll show you. Hello, welcome.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I love your program. 
 
QUEST: You're very kind. Welcome aboard.
 
These are the heroes of the night. Absolute heroes. They are looking after the whole community. They're having to put up with an enormous amount of everything. Well done. 
 
And as you come further north -- sorry. There we go. Put it on. Where are you from? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Italy! Italy! 
 
QUEST: Italy, Italy.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: France!
 
QUEST: France.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Argentina!  
 
QUEST: Argentina.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Philippines. 
 
QUEST: Philippines.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mexico. 
 
QUEST: Mexico. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: L.A.!  
 
QUEST: It's everywhere. Never say that the world isn't all here. Hello. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hello! How are you doing? Happy New Year!
 
QUEST: It's an amazing experience. You've got to do it happens once, Harry. If you haven't done it once, you have to do it once. 
 
ENTEN: I may have to do it once. I tell you, I've lived in New York my entire life and you can tell by the accent and just seeing you out with the people, Richard, and I don't know if I necessarily want to do Times Square and I definitely want to do New Year's with you at least once. 
 
QUEST: You know, the thing is you haven't asked the question which I'm very surprised, knowing you, very surprised and bearing in mind they can't leave. If they leave, they can't come back. That means that when we leave here at midnight there are all sorts of bottles of very strange liquids. 
 
ENTEN: Well, that was going to be my question which is how the heck do these folks hold it in for so long or do they hold it in? 
 
QUEST: Well, the rumor is -- can we talk about this at this time? The rumor is some of them is some of them might be wearing undergarments that assist in that regard. 
 
ENTEN: I feel like it's -- 
 
REID: There's no other way. 
 
ENTEN: There's no other way. 
 
REID: There's no other way. I think yeah, this is a generally accepted part of the Times Square tradition. 
 
QUEST: I'll tell you what you do see in some of the further deeper parts, you will often see a coat being taken off to surround some young lady who might need some facilities, but they manage it. I mean, they get -- what time were you here? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Eleven o'clock. 
 
QUEST: He's a late comer, 11:00. He's come part-time, to get right in the square down there you've got to be here about 9:00 in the morning, but if you come at about 10:00 or 11:00, you can get way further up. 
 
ENTEN: I am just amazed by all of this. The amount of people who are willing to put themselves out at least for one time only.
 <br>[18:25:04]
 
And you know what, Richard? You asked earlier on whether or not it's too early to ask that type of question. No, man, we're already into New Year's Eve celebration. It's never too early. We're already into the p.m. hours, buddy. 
 
QUEST: Look at them. They're all in a need of a rest. That was a pathetic cheer. Come on!
 
(CHEERS)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Happy new year!  
 
ENTEN: Richard, you might have to go out there and get them some coffee. 
 
REID: He can't leave. 
 
QUEST: No, don't worry, Paula, I can leave, and I can come back and yes, I can go to the bathroom. We can't tell them that.
 
REID: Okay. With that power comes great responsibility. You need to go get some people some caffeine, Richard. 
 
ENTEN: Yeah. 
 
QUEST: Hey. It's New Year's Eve. Each one to their own, I'm afraid at this point. 
 
You know, I simply ask myself, just think about it, guys. Just think about it, I say to you, hey, I've got a great idea, we're going to shove a ball at the top of a pole and we'll all watch it come back down again.
 
And that's essentially what we're doing tonight. They've shoved the ball to the top of the pole with the thousands of crystals and LEDs and it will take a minute to come back down again. We'll all cheer, there will be huge amounts of confetti and then we'll do New York, New York, New York, New York, and then we all go home. 
 
REID: I mean, it's creative. It's different, right? I mean, it's our own tradition. It's weird, but it's ours. 
 
All right, Richard and Harry, stand by. 
 
QUEST: Weird, it's brilliant. 
 
REID: All right. Stand by. 
 
Let's check in with CNN's Melissa Bell. She is in Paris. 
 
It looks stunning there. The fireworks, Melissa. They were incredible for us watching on TV. What was it like there on the ground? 
 
MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Oh, just an amazing fireworks display this year, Paula. Now, we knew it was going to be big. We knew that it was going to be special because although, of course, this is a great tradition and you were talking about American traditions, here the tradition is either for the French to sit at the table and eat foie gras and oysters or to come out to the Champs Elysee and watch the fireworks display and the first time we were able to have one since COVID, and that was pretty spectacular.
 
And tonight, the French did put on an extraordinary show because, of course, they intend for 2024 to be the year of France. We've got the Paris Olympics coming up in the summer. We've got the re-opening of Notre Dame cathedral as well in 2024.
 
And so, they really wanted to give the world a taste of the kind of show that only the French can put on, and so you saw an awful lot of that tonight, and acrobatic displays and there were deejays playing and all along the Arc du Triomphe behind me, projections showing climbers fencing, just a taste of summer, the summer games that the French capital will be hosting this year.
 
So, an extraordinary show that was put on tonight. It was a very little loud because beyond the fireworks displays itself, there are a million people down there on the Champs Elysee. For a little while it went quiet as they listened to the fireworks.
 
But there's been a lot of chanting, a lot of singing, a lot of chaos down there as we said, as well, but really a fantastic night here in Paris as the French capital looks ahead to what they hope, as I said will be an extraordinary 2024 -- Paula. REID: Well, Melissa, if that is a preview of what to expect from
 
 France and the Olympics, we are certainly in for a treat. Thank you so much for keeping us up-to-date in the City of Lights and happy New Year. 
 
BELL: Happy New Year. 
 
REID: I also want to check in on our new year's eve forecast with CNN meteorologist Elisa Raffa. 
 
All right, Elisa, what can we expect over the next several hours as folks welcome 2024?
 
ELISA RAFFA, CNN WEATHER ANCHOR: It's quiet over most of the country. You can see looking at the satellite and radar there is a big empty spot here, and things are quiet with high pressure in control. I want to zoom in to New York City, though. We were watching Richard Quest in Times Square. We can see some high clouds that are moving in. There are some showers off to the west in parts of Pennsylvania rain and snow. It doesn't look like it will make it to New York, you might have one snow make flying around with the confetti and not looking at it getting into New York. You'll just keep some of the cloud cover.
 
Here is the system that's spinning over the great lakes and it's bringing rain and snow showers from Chicago to Cleveland, and trying to make its way through parts of Pennsylvania there. As we go through the overnight and into tomorrow the system is going to try to work its way east, but it's not going to really do too much. 
 <br>[18:30:04]
 
We're looking at a dusting of snow at best and maybe up to four inches or so in the highest elevations of the Appalachia Mountains there in West Virginia. But other than that, pretty unimpressive. So, there it goes as we go into tonight and into tomorrow and there's the big area of high pressure that's going to keep us quiet as we go through not only tonight, but even New Year's Day starting on 2024 on a quiet note. 
 
So that midnight tonight, a look across the U.S., you can see there, Times Square, New York City around 40 degrees, those rain and snow showers trying to creep in and they stay out to the west. Lots of dry here in the middle of the country, temperatures chilly, though. And you're looking at temperatures in the 20s, below freezing from Rapid City to Denver, Minneapolis, 25 degrees at midnight. 
 
So, taking a look at the ball drop in New York City. Times Square will find the mostly cloudy skies, again, maybe a few flurries with a little bit of wind -- wind-chills can be in the middle and upper 30s, but overall, again, looking at that temperature at 40 at midnight, and I loved when Richard Quest was saying oh, this is nothing, right? Because remember, a couple of years ago in 2018, it was one of the coldest ball drops on record, nine degrees in 2018. So, we were rivaling that top spot in New York City.
 
But the last two years in Times Square have been top five warmest. We rang in 2023 at 54 degrees, which was third warmest on record, and we rang in 2022, fifth warmest on record at 51 degrees. So the last two years have been warmest. This year kind of seasonal, but a few years ago, it was very cold with those temperatures in the single digits. 
 
So good thing not feeling dangerously cold out in New York and going into tomorrow, New Year's day, again, quiet for most of the U.S. and the temperatures are on the cool side and overall starting out on a calm note there, Paula. 
 
REID: Thank you, Elisa, and happy New Year. 
 
RAFFA: Happy new year. 
 
REID: We are still -- we are still more than five hours away from the top of the New Year on the East Coast, but people around the world have stepped into 2024 and they are celebrating in style. 
 
We'll be right back. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:36:46]
 
REID: You are looking at a live picture of Big Ben. London will ring in the New Year in just a few minutes here. 
 
We've been checking in with our reporters around the world as different countries welcome 2024. 
 
And the New Year means a New Year resolution. If you want to exercise more, read more, spend more time with family or spend more time with your work family like I'm doing tonight with my buddy Harry Enten who is back with us. He is here to run the numbers. 
 
I mean, look, this is my resolution, and I'm already winning, Harry. In the last block, you talked about how you don't usually stay awake to ring in the New Year. I don't know if I believe that. I don't think anyone believes I stay awake through New Year's. I have an 18-month- old. 
 
But according to the numbers, how many people actually stay awake until midnight? 
 
ENTEN: I want to have a clarification. I didn't say what I usually do. I say what I want to do. I usually do stay awake, but I wish that I'd go to bed early. 
 
Now, if we look at the numbers of Americans on this particular score turns out most of them, in fact, do stay awake until midnight and 70 percent, but I really want to be part of that 30 percent because I've got to tell you, with the long hours that you and I work, the idea going to bed and maybe entering the new year on an energetic rise to me sounds so glorious, but I will report back to you, Paula. It will be a Paula Reid exclusive whether or not I'm actually able to go to bed before midnight this year and we'll have to wait and see what happens. REID: I would love that exclusive. You call me and you let me know,
 
 join us, that 30 percent and that's where you want to be. 
 
Now, I don't know, Harry, do you have a new year's resolution? 
 
ENTEN: Do I? You know, I stole my one. I was going to say, and I was going to charm the pant off you and say I wanted to spend more time with you at least on this side of the screen. You in D.C. and me in New York although I can come to D.C. one time if the bosses allow it.
 
But if you look at where Americans are on this particular score, whether or not they have a resolution or not, what we generally see is that, in fact, only a minority of Americans have a New Year's resolution. The majority, the 60 percent say no.
 
But you know, I don't know if I'm with the 60 percent here because why not try and have a resolution? Why not try and better ourselves? Yeah, I know, January 1st is kind of arbitrary, but why not start now? 
 
REID: Yeah, why not, right? What would your resolution be? Do you have one in mind? 
 
ENTEN: Do I have one in mind? Well, you know, if I was being real maybe it would be to take a step off the pedal a little bit. Maybe not show up to work every Saturday or Sunday. Don't worry, Tim, I'll still come here for the hits and Tim is the executive producer in case you don't know.
 
But here are some ideas here. Some top New Year's resolutions. Exercise more. I could do that. Eat healthier, I think I can do that. 
 
Save money. You know, the truth is I'm probably a little too good at that. More family time. Spend more time with the girlfriend, I can do that. 
 
Get a new job, no. And quit smoking -- I can say in all honesty, right to the television audience here, I have never once smoked. 
 <br>[18:40:05]
 
My mother made me promise her, and I have backed up that promise. 
 
But, Paula, what about you? 
 
REID: Yeah, for a New Year's resolution I would like to work on a book. I'm sure our bosses would be thrilled to hear both our resolutions, but I want to know, would you try dry January? I know you said you don't smoke, but drinking, would you try it? Have you tried it? 
 
ENTEN: I have to be honest with you, that would be the easiest thing in the world, dry January. I very rarely drink, maybe once every six months. If I do drink, it might be, you know, a Bailey's with a Coke Zero, might curl a little, but I love the idea of soda. 
 
Dry January wouldn't necessarily be tough. Maybe dry pasta, that would be tough. 
 
REID: That would be terrible, Harry. That would be terrible. 
 
ENTEN: That would be terrible, or a month without pasta, a month without chicken. Maybe I would go pescatarian for a month, that would be something I could attain, but would be difficult. But that might be the type of thing I would go for, but dry January would be a walk in the park and I have to be honest to you and the audience. 
 
REID: Fascinating, Harry Enten, I learned so much about you tonight. Thank you so much and happy New Year. 
 
ENTEN: Happy New Year, next year in Times Square. 
 
REID: Yeah. That will be fun. 
 
All right. Let's get back to CNN's Julia Vargas-Jones who's on one of the most popular beaches in the world, Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 
 
All right. We all in Rio, they know how to party. So, what's at there -- what's it like out there right now? 
 
JULIA VARGAS-JONES, CNN JOURNALIST: Paula, it is a full-on party. As you can see this beautiful crowd behind me they've been here for hours and hours and we've been here for many hours today and people just don't stop coming. The shows have begun. 
 
There's pop divas on stage right now. The big name is Gloria Groove (ph). She's a singer and she's on right now and that's probably why I'm yelling here.
 
But it's still about four hours until midnight. At the stroke of midnight, Paula, there will be a 12-minute long fireworks show. They will be set off from ten different boats on the bay in the ocean and this crowd is going to have the first look of it -- at it. There will be an orchestra set up on the stage where we're at, but right now, the party just rolled on. 
 
So 2023 was a big year for Brazil. We started with political turmoil. Brazil had its own invasion of the capitol, nothing of that -- nothing like that matters right now. People are here to party and to bring in the New Year, as you can see. I'm wearing white as is tradition in Brazil where white to ring in the New Year brings peace and harmony for 2024. 
 
Another really fun thing that we'll be seeing is a crown. I have my colorful crown to wear and I'm very exciting about that and I'm waiting for the countdown in Copacabana beach. Back to you, Paula. 
 
REID: I love the white. I love the crown. Rio de Janeiro, they know how to throw a party and welcome in 2024. Julia, thank you so much. 
 
And we are counting down until the ball drop. A look back now at midnight in Abu Dhabi earlier.

REID: CNN is all around the globe following big cities ringing in the New Year. 
 
CNN's Hanako Montgomery was in Tokyo for the midnight celebration. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
HANAKO MONTGOMERY, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Happy New Year from Tokyo, Paula. 
 
We kicked off tonight by first attending the Tokyo metropolitan government's lantern release festival. Here people wrote down their new year's resolutions, their hopes and aspirations for 2024 on these orange lanterns and released them up into the sky. It was a beautiful show, beautiful presentation, and now we're at Sensoji, the temple behind me where thousands of people gathered to bring in the New Year. It's one of the most famous temples in Japan. 
 
And once here, you can celebrate in many different ways and you can pull fortunes written on tiny slips of paper. You can hear the New Year's bell being rung eight times, one for each of the 208 worldly desires or vices that are said to afflict humans in Buddhism. 
 
You can, of course, also pray to your local gods and thank them for the year that you've had and just a few ways to welcome the New Year here in Japan -- Paula. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
MONTGOMERY: All right. Now to Sydney, Australia. CNN's Angus Watson rang in the New Year at Sydney Harbor with a massive fireworks display. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANGUS WATSON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Paula, the city of Sydney estimates half a billion would tune in to the fireworks display. That's spectacular, as Sydney, one of the first major cities in the world to celebrate 2024 right in that New York, 1 million people packed the harbor to get a glimpse of the stunning fireworks display.
 <br>[18:50:02]
 
Tens of thousands of fireworks lighting up the harbor sky, finishing in a stunning waterfall of light from the Sydney Harbor Bridge. The Sydney Opera House turned 50 in 2023, a year of celebration capped in a momentous fireworks display. I am here at Luna Park, a heritage amusement here on the show, as thousands of people had already had a wonderful 2024 -- Paula. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
REID: All right. In Asia, CNN is in Bangkok, Thailand. 
 
Will Ripley rang in the New Year with a huge fireworks display at the iconic Temple of Dawn.

WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Happy New Year from Bangkok, Paula. I cannot imagine a better spot than the one we were at to watch the fireworks go off at midnight. They were directly above us. It was so close.
 
I swore I could feel the heat coming off of them at times. I don't know if I actually could, or if it was just my mind making it up, but it was amazing. It was so loud. It was spectacular. And we have a beautiful sight on this rooftop along the Chao Phraya River to watch the fireworks as they just sparkled overhead. 
 
The Temple of Dawn, an iconic spot, a very auspicious spot on any day of the year, but a particularly auspicious place they say to ring in the New Year. It's a temple that symbolizes new beginnings. That's what we had here in Bangkok. 
 
For the last two years, things have been picking up. You know, after all of those COVID lockdowns, that feels like a distant memory now. I actually met a couple on their honeymoon from New York, they got married in 2021, and they postponed it until coming here to Bangkok to ring in the New Year and celebrate their marriage. 
 
You find stories like this up and down the incredible city. I was walking down one city block, Paula, I heard five or six languages spoken in the course of just a few minutes. Truly an international feeling here as people from the around the world come to ring in 2024 in Bangkok -- Paula.

REID: Wow. Will Ripley, thank you. 
 
And we are moments away from midnight in London. Here are live pictures of Big Ben. 
 
The new year in Dublin. We have live video of a pub cam. Check that out. We'll be right back.

REID: Welcome back. Right now, London is just moments away from midnight. And the excitement is building as the iconic Big Ben gets ready to ring in the New Year and fireworks get ready to light up the night sky. And we're still hours away from the clock striking midnight here on
 
 the East Coast. But already thousands of people from around the world are gathering in New York to witness firsthand the city's iconic ball drop in Times Square. 
 
CNN's Richard Quest reports on how the descent of that giant aluminum ball has become a universal symbol of welcoming the New Year. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
QUEST (voice-over): In the city that never sleeps, at that moment when the year changes -- well, this is the only place to be. Of course, Times Square, New York. A New Year's Eve tradition more than a century old drawing in the masses every December 31st. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's a wonderful. Unbelievable, it's the most exciting New Year's Eve of my life. 
 
QUEST: What's it all about? That. The crystal ball that sits atop one Times Square. It weighs more than 11,000 pounds. Frankly, the whole thing is a bit odd, eccentric to be certain. 
 
Why do we all watch a ball slide down a pole on New Year's Eve? 
 
JEFFREY STRAUSS, PRESIDENT, COUNTDOWN ENTERTAINMENT: The first two years, they actually did fireworks atop the building, but I would rain down on the revelers below burning their heads. And they had to come up with a good idea. And they took this world tradition, this idea, these time balls that drop at noon around the world so that navigators can adjust their timepieces to the local added, and they added an electricity, light bulbs and created a lighted time bulb that would drop at midnight to mark the beginning of a New York. 
 
QUEST: Keeping everyone entertained is no easy task. This is a party with more than 1 million guests. 
 
STRAUSS: Over 1,000 people work on this show that night. That doesn't include the New York police, fire, sanitation, all the city agencies that make this a safe, friendly, happy celebration. 
 
QUEST: New Year's Eve in Times Square for many is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. For me, it's the only place to be. 
 
I am everywhere tonight. 
 
ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST: We heard there's a shoe emergency. 
 
QUEST: There is. It suddenly fell apart. 
 
I believe that we will win. I believe that we will win! I believe that we will win! 
 
I am, indeed, a pretzel. 
 
The phant -- the phantom of the opera. 
 
It's Hamilton, which, of course, is the sensation. 
 
Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses, yearning to breathe free. I lift my golden lamp beside your golden door. 
 
(CHEERS)
 
QUEST: The next time I see these numbers lit up, it will be 2024. The New Year will have arrived. We will have sung New York, New York. 
 
For more than 20 years, I've been in the Square, watching the ball drop to a happy new year. With loved ones, because really there's nowhere better to be. 
 
Richard Quest, CNN, Times Square, New York.

REID: I love him in that Lady Liberty costume. But the pretzel is pretty good, too. 
 
All right. That does it for us on the CNN NEWSROOM.
 
Coming back, a look at some of the top highlights at 2023.
