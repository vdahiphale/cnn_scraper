JESSICA DEAN, CNN HOST: Hi and thanks so much for joining us. I'm Jessica Dean in Washington alongside my colleague Jim Sciutto in Tel Aviv.
 
We have breaking news in the Middle East and also here in the US that we are monitoring and that's where we start in the Southeastern United States where the death toll from the devastating storm, Helene is rising this afternoon.
 
Officials now saying at least 64 people were killed across five states, and there are fears that number will likely grow.
 
Scores of people remain unaccounted for especially in parts of Western North Carolina and the damage there is simply catastrophic.
 
Roads and bridges washed out, destroyed; entire towns remain underwater right now and more than two million people are still without power.
 
Helene made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane on Thursday, but today, rescue and recovery efforts still remain a challenge.
 
GOV. ROY COOPER (D-NC): Many people are cut off because roads are impassable. They don't have power or communications.
 
Because it is so difficult to get trucks in by land, yesterday, we began airlifting supplies, including food and water into the region.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
DEAN: CNN's Rafael Romo has been surveying the damage and talking with people in Asheville, North Carolina where so much damage has been done. He joins us now on the phone.
 
Rafael, we are looking at pictures right now of the beginning of cleanup in Asheville, North Carolina, but there is still so much should we done. Rescue and recovery efforts still underway.
 
RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (via phone): That's right, Jessica, so much to be done and the major problems remain lack of water and lack of power for many people in Asheville. There are other towns that are also without the service, and North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper described what happened here as widespread, catastrophic damage that Hurricane Helene has caused the western part of the state especially.
 
He is issued a major disaster declaration for 25 western North Carolina counties and the eastern bend of Cherokees. This disaster declaration has already been approved by the White House and it will provide funding for the Individual Assistant Program and people are already signing up and that is a good thing because the need here is so great, Jessica.
 
And we've been going to different neighborhoods in the city. We went earlier to a neighborhood called West Asheville, where a resident told us the river overflowed its banks, bringing all kinds of debris and trash to the streets in front of her house. Let's take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LUCY TAVERNIAR, ASHVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA RESIDENT: It is indescribable. I don't know. It just was covered in litter and trees and mud and it is stinky, and it was all the way up the street up here.
 
It just looks like the bottom of a river.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ROMO: And Jessica, Buncombe County officials said yesterday, there are more than 60 people who are accounted for.
 
Today, they said they have received more than 1,000 reports of missing people and the main problem here, like I was saying before, Jessica, is communications including both mobile service and internet.
 
People cannot call to let their relatives, their loved ones know that they're okay and I can imagine that most of those 1,000 people are probably okay. It is just very difficult for them to communicate with the outside world, and let their families know what is going on here.
 
So a very dire situation here, and it is going to take many weeks, many months before this part of the country gets back to normal -- Jessica.
 
DEAN: Really devastating. All right, Rafael Romo on the ground there in North Carolina. Thank you so much.
 <br>[15:05:10]
 
And for more, let us bring in Evan Peterson. He is the national spokesperson for the American Red Cross.
 
Evan, thanks so much for being here with us.
 
EVAN PETERSON, NATIONAL SPOKESPERSON, AMERICAN RED CROSS: Of course. We really appreciate you taking the time to talk about this very important topic.
 
DEAN: And so, let's just start first and level set for people because we do, do weather coverage a lot. And I think helping people understand the scope of this particular disaster and what people are seeing right now.
 
Can you help people understand, give them some context around the damage that has been done.
 
PETERSON: I will certainly do my best.
 
Just to paint a picture, imagine you're looking at the United States like you would on a school chalkboard. This storm we are talking about has impacted millions of people and to put that into perspective, we are talking about from the southern most part point of Florida all the way up to the Midwest.
 
And now, we see remnants of Hurricane Helene over in the northeast portion of the country. Along this path, we are not just talking about hurricane force winds that have cut off power to so many people, but we are talking deadly water rising and now receding, which is still moving water, which can be very dangerous.
 
On top of that, we've heard about the infrastructure problems in terms of getting communication, the fear of not being able to talk with your loved ones. It has been so horrible for so many people, but that is where we come in.
 
We had the good fortune of being able to see this coming on the radar, and thanks to reports like you all were providing, we moved people and resources into these areas in the path of the storm in advance, so that when the all-clear was given, we had a place to welcome people in who needed refuge, to provide the comfort and care for so many who need it.
 
DEAN: And so what are you seeing as the greatest needs right now?
 
PETERSON: The greatest needs right now, our organization is focused on what is going on in the immediate. We've talked about how that water level is still receding in some areas, so imagine, there are people who, for the better part of a week have not had a chance to return home yet.
 
For some people, when they do get that all clear, they go back, they see just a puddle on their front door and maybe that's the extent of their damage, but I would definitely say that that is the minority of people.
 
A lot of people are going home, if their home is still standing, they are opening the door to a foot of water inside their home or worst- case scenario, their home is no longer there anymore, so were working to provide comfort, care, meals for people and then have someone to listen to them.
 
We know this is the fourth storm now in just over a year, the trauma that is associated with, continuing to deal with this is very palpable and we want people to know we are going to get through this together.
 
DEAN: And looking specifically at North Carolina, I know there that the governor, Roy Cooper says his state is now airlifting supplies to people in need because so many of the roads simply are impassable at this point, or you mentioned just broadly, infrastructure has been damaged as well.
 
Are you all encountering challenges in trying to get to people?
 
PETERSON: The exact same challenges. We are communicating with our team at every level and our counterparts at every level of a disaster response, so not just like the residents that live in these communities, and the community partners that are there, but at the municipal, county, the state and even the federal government, we are trying to find ways to get supplies in to people.
 
Earlier messaging I've seen talked about how we are also trying to airlift supplies and getting resources, food, water to these essential safe points. And a lot of these are high up on the mountaintop, so we are hoping that we can work with our teams to get those farther down.
 
As I mentioned, we did stage people there in advance, so we do have teams in safe areas at our hubs there that are working to get resources out to the community, but without having roads in, it is making our options very difficult in terms of how fast we can get resources and get help in.
 
DEAN: And so looking ahead to what comes next, how do you see the next several days, even the next few weeks going? How long do you think these recovery efforts will last?
 
PETERSON: I am here in Tallahassee where we, all day, have had trucks coming and going from this port behind me, getting resources out into the community.
 
This is not something that is going to be disappearing in the next day or so or next couple of weeks. This is months, if not longer, we are talking about because again, there are some people who have not had the chance to go back home yet.
 
We want people to know, we see you. We are here with you and we are here for the long road to recovery because it is going to be a long road to recovery and we are committed to that.
 
DEAN: I know. We are looking at video as you're talking of just some of the damage that has been done and it is truly staggering.
 
All right, Evan Peterson with the Red Cross, thank you so much for your time and good luck with all of those rescue -- with all of those recovery efforts and helping those people who need it. I am sure they are glad to have you.
 
PETERSON: Thank you.
 
DEAN: Coming up, Israel continuing to hit Lebanon with airstrikes, but it is also targeting the Houthis in Yemen. We are live from Tel Aviv. That's just ahead.
 
And as the war in the Middle East escalates, there is a renewed effort to free the remaining hostages in Gaza. We are going to speak with the father of a missing IDF soldier who has been held captive by Hamas since the start of the war, what he is hearing about a potential hostage deal. That's just ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
JIM SCIUTTO CNN ANCHOR AND CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: New today, as tensions in the Middle East threatens to boil over again, Israel today is turning its firepower on targets south in Houthi- controlled parts of Yemen.
 <br>[15:15:00]
 
The IDF says it attacked a power station and seaport there. The Iran- backed Houthis are behind recent rocket and missile attacks on Israel, including in the last 24 hours, as well as on US warships and commercial ships in the region.
 
This attack comes as Israel and Hezbollah continue to exchange fire across Lebanon's border.
 
Ben Wedeman joins us now from Beirut.
 
Ben, I know that the strikes have been continuing a pace there in Beirut and in Southern Lebanon.
 
Tell us the view of the war from where you're standing in these last 24 hours.
 
BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Jim, in Beirut, the strikes have been sporadic on the southern suburbs, but they seem to be more concentrated in the south, as well as in the eastern -- the Beqaa Valley where there have been some one strike that according to the Ministry of Health, killed 21 people and injured 47. There was another strike outside of the southern city of Sidon, which killed 32, wounded 53.
 
In total, it appears that the death toll for today's strikes exceeds 70. What we are not seeing however, is any sort of significant Hezbollah response. Certainly, in the aftermath of Friday's killing of Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah, and so far we've seen that Hezbollah has claimed responsibility for 11 strikes over the border, but nothing particularly out of the ordinary.
 
Now is that because they are holding their fire for some sort of surprise salvo or is it because as a result of the decimation, well over actually, decimation of its military and political leadership.
 
Today, Hezbollah acknowledged that two of their senior commanders were killed. One is Ali Karaki, who is responsible for the southern front, in other words, the border with Israel. The other is Nabil Kaouk, who was the head of preventative security, and also a member of Hezbollah Executive Council. Now, today, a Lebanese security source told CNN that the body of Hassan Nasrallah has been recovered, although that has not been acknowledged by Hezbollah itself. Now, it is interesting, Jomana Karadsheh, our colleague, was out and about today speaking with people, some of them supporters of Hezbollah, some of them have actually not actually accepted that Nasrallah is dead.
 
They go back to the 2006 war when there was a period of three days during the initial phases of that war, when people thought he was killed and then suddenly he reappeared on television. So there are those who are hoping that, strangely enough, he might still be alive.
 
Now, beyond that Beirut and the rest of Lebanon is suffering from this massive influx of people who have fled the south of Lebanon, the southern suburbs, and the Beqaa Valley as well. Tens of thousands have fled to Syria.
 
And in Beirut, what we are seeing is that people are still desperately looking for some form of shelter. Many of them still camping out in the Central Martyrs' Square in downtown Beirut. Others, just along the Coronation, on beaches -- Jim.
 
SCIUTTO: Well, they are fleeing for their lives or in fear of their lives.
 
Ben Wedeman in Beirut. Thanks so much.
 
Well, families of hostages still held in Gaza almost a year after the October 7th attacks say they fear the expanding fighting between Israel and Hezbollah could not just overshadow the plight of their loved ones, but also really challenge any ceasefire talks.
 
Next week marks the one-year anniversary of the October 7th attacks.
 
Joining me now is Ruby Chen. He is the father of 19-year-old Itay. He was an American member of the IDF believed by the Israeli forces that he was killed on October 7th. His body remains at Gaza.
 
His father is with me now.
 
Ruby, thanks so much for joining. I often think of you, your family and the families of other hostages and I appreciate you taking the time.
 
RUBY CHEN, FATHER OF ITAY CHEN: Thank you for having me.
 
You know, we are one of the seven US hostages.
 
SCIUTTO: Yes. Seven and that number is so important.
 
I often think of you as well when the fighting expands, whether that be in Gaza, but now in Lebanon, but I wonder if your hope dwindles of some sort of ceasefire agreement, not just between Israel and Lebanon, but between Israel and Hamas in Gaza that would might allow for the freedom for those hostages. CHEN: Yes. So as you see, I have here on my jacket the number of days. This was the last time that I spoke to my son and we've gone through a full cycle of birthdays, anniversaries, holidays with an empty seat.
 <br>[15:20:17]
 
My youngest son had his bar mitzvah a week after October 7th, and we just had this weekend, we celebrated his 14th birthday and it is like a year of one day that is a continuous day that just never ends and you just keep on waking up and you see that you are still living this hell that we have.
 
And the challenge that we have is that we feel this has been normalized, where the fact that the hostages, you wake up in the morning and say, okay, they are hostages yes, there are seven US hostages of the 101 hostages and we've come somewhat of a lower priority and that is unacceptable.
 
And when we look at this deal of ceasefire, we believe it needs to be a comprehensive deal. Why? Because if it is only contained to Lebanon, then this whole thing started from Gaza, so we need and what we are asking and demanding from the Israeli government as well as from the US, to broker a deal that is comprehensive, that includes the hostages as part of that comprehensive deal.
 
SCIUTTO: Who do you blame? And there are many parties involved -- who do you blame or who do you believe holds most of the blame for not getting such an agreement across the finish line?
 
CHEN: So that's a difficult question because let's start with saying Sinwar, he is Satan.
 
SCIUTTO: Of course.
 
CHEN: But at the end, I am an Israeli citizen and a US citizen, so the only people that I could go to are my elected officials and I do believe that the prime minister here in Israel, there were opportunities, missed opportunities to get a deal done and at the end of the day, it is totally unacceptable, a year, people were taken out of their beds and taken hostage.
 
I just came back from a small retreat where I, for the first time met one of the hostages that was in captivity for over 60 days and when you listened to her, you say, for the love of God, every television show, each day needs to open up what she endured.
 
She is 80 years old, her son was immediately killed on October 7th and her other son was killed later. That is what we need to talk about.
 
But I also have critique, I have my critique about the US administration as well and the US administration has been very open and have been very accessible. We've met Jake Sullivan for about a dozen times. We just met him last week, as well as with the CIA Director Bill Burns, and this is -- they -- it is natural for hostage families to meet officials, but at the end of the day, they also have a responsibility. SCIUTTO: Do you believe -- and there has been an investment of us diplomatic capital first in the Gaza ceasefire hostage deal, and in the attempted ceasefire in Northern Israel.
 
From a US perspective, in terms of the Biden administration, do you believe it is a lack of sufficient effort to get a deal across the finish line or is it a lack of sufficient influence over the Israeli government to make some of the concessions they believe are necessary to do so?
 
And by the way, in asking that question, I am certainly not eliminating Hamas has responsibility. I am just talking about that piece of it.
 
CHEN: So I've been meeting Jake for about a year. And --
 
SCIUTTO: Jake Sullivan.
 
CHEN: Jake Sullivan and after I think six, seven weeks, I asked him a very simple question, what is Plan B? And I have still been waiting to hear what is Plan B.
 
So when you add those components, I would also add a lack of creativity. Like, I know they look at all the options all the time and we need to question those option.
 
Each single day we wake up in the morning, Jake Sullivan and his team need to look at those assumptions, how to get all the hostages with a specific focus on the US citizens and that is the task in front of them and that needs to be accomplished.
 
And today, they don't get a passing grade.
 
SCIUTTO: When you say Plan B, are you talking -- does that include a direct, if possible channel between the US and Hamas through intermediaries, perhaps to get the seven Americans out of Gaza/
 
CHEN: The US administration has an obligation, a legal obligation, a moral obligation to get US citizens out of harm's way.
 
I am not a politician. I do not know what is the best way to do it. I just know that they need to find a way to make it happen where all the assumptions need to be on the table and analyzed, and if the US claim that they do not have assets today in order to get the US citizens out, then please create those assets.
 <br>[15:25:06]
 
SCIUTTO: October 7th is just a few days away. You described a year of pain with what I can only imagine is an empty seat at the table for all of these events you described -- birthdays, bar mitzvahs, holidays, and of course, we have a High Holiday coming up as well.
 
How are you going to mark October 7th, and I might  even say, how are you going to get through the anniversary of October 7th? CHEN: We've been talking about that a lot. You know, the initial instinct would be to get on a plane and just disappear someplace, but there are many people here that have been with us throughout this year and we feel that we, as a family, need to be together and there are various events happening on that day that we will kind of pick and choose what feels the best, but where we cannot be is we cannot be together as a family, and that marks the most difficult aspect of it.
 
And we just need somehow to find a way to get this government, Bibi Netanyahu's government, as well as the US government on the same page, to get a comprehensive deal to put it an end to this because it is not just in the interest of the state of Israel, it is also a strategic interest of the United States to deescalate.
 
What is happening here in the Middle East, because it can go and blow up and become something that nobody wants, so they need to find a way to de-escalate, get the hostages out, which is a vital component, the de-escalating.
 
SCIUTTO: Well, listen, I hope and I know our team here and elsewhere at CNN hopes that this number on your lapel doesn't rise to many more digits in the coming days and weeks. We wish you and your family the best.
 
CHEN: Thanks for having me.
 
SCIUTTO: Ruby Chen, one of seven American, one of seven American families waiting for their loved ones to come home and we will be right back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[15:31:25]
 
DEAN: We are following breaking news.
 
Right now, you are looking at a live picture outside Atlanta where evacuations are underway as a massive chemical fire burns in the city of Conyers.
 
Residents near the area are being told to leave and Interstate 20 is closed for several miles near that fire. It all started around 5:00 AM apparently because of a faulty sprinkler head. That fire breaking out at a company called Biolab. It reportedly handles swimming pool and spa chemicals.
 
At one point, the fire was out. It has now reignited and according to local affiliate, WSB, a shelter-in-place is now in effect for that area.
 
The plumes for the fire can be seen for miles and that is a live camera from Atlanta where you can see the fire. The city of Conyers is roughly 30 miles away.
 
New polling giving us an insight into how two critical voting groups are leaning ahead of the November election. A new NBC Telemundo, CNBC poll showing Vice President Harris with a 14-point lead over Trump, among likely Latino voters. Harris getting 54 percent in that poll, while Trump has 40 percent.
 
A new CNN poll also shows Harris leading with voters aged 65 and older. She currently has a four four-point edge over Trump with senior voters. If she holds that support through the election, Harris would be the first Democrat to carry voters aged 65 and older since Al Gore in 2000.
 
Former President Trump is campaigning in the battleground state of Pennsylvania this afternoon and CNN's Jeff Zeleny is at the rally in Erie.
 
Jeff, I know when we talked to you, it looks like he is still on stage behind you. He was there in the last hour. What is he focusing on during this rally?
 
JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Jessica, former President Donald Trump is entering the second hour of his speech here in Erie, and Erie, of course, is a battleground within the battleground of Pennsylvania.
 
If you look back at recent elections, Barack Obama won it twice in 2008 and 2012, Donald Trump won it in 2016, and Joe Biden won it in 2020.
 
Driving around this town, you see Trump signs, you see Harris-Walz signs, so that really sets the table for why this part of Western Pennsylvania is so critical.
 
We have heard very little from the former president in terms of his policies, his proposals for a potential second term, but he has been assailing his rival going after Vice President Harris intensively on immigration and other matters. And once again, her mental acuity.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Joe Biden became mentally impaired, sad, but Lying Kamala Harris honestly, I believe she was born that way.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
TRUMP: There is something wrong with Kamala and I just don't know what it is, but there is definitely something missing.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ZELENY: So from intentionally mispronouncing her name to mocking her abilities and intellect, there is no doubt that this is music to the ears of the many Trump supporters in the base, the question is, what does it do for that sliver of undecided or persuadable voters here in Pennsylvania or elsewhere? That is very much an open question.
 
Many Republicans we talked to, certainly, a list the former president would stick to immigration and other issues like the economy -- Jessica.
 
DEAN: Yes, where polling has shown he actually holds an edge over the vice president.
 
Jeff Zeleny in Erie, Pennsylvania, thank you so much for that.
 
And be sure to tune in to CNN as Tim Walz and JD Vance come face-to- face for their one and only debate, a CNN special event, the vice presidential debate simulcast. It is hosted by CBS. It airs live Tuesday at 9:00 PM Eastern right here on CNN.
 
And when we come back, as Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon continue, buildings have collapsed and families are being displaced. The latest on the humanitarian effort, next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[15:39:51]
 
SCIUTTO: On Saturday, President Biden called the death of Hezbollah's longtime leader, "a measure of justice" for his many victims, but also the president called for de-escalation in the region.
 <br>[15:40:03]
 
Hassan Nasrallah's death by an Israeli airstrike is worsening fears of an escalating multi-front conflict, something Biden has said repeatedly, he is actively working to avoid, and with six weeks before the presidential election in the US, the political stakes, incredibly high as well.
 
CNN Washington correspondent, Sunlen Serfaty joins me now.
 
Sunlen, I wonder how the White House is reading these escalations, not just from a security standpoint, national security standpoint, but also a political one.
 
SUNLEN SERFATY, CNN WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: That is absolutely right, Jim/
 
There are two fronts here that the White House has to take into account as they manage this rapidly evolving situation and conflict. And we've really seen the White House, President Biden and his aides throughout the weekend attempt to lower the temperature on all fronts.
 
As you said, emphasizing that they want to de-escalate the conflict, emphasizing that they believe that the route here to take us through diplomacy only, and that is something that we heard just moments ago from President Biden as he made his way back here in Washington from Rehoboth where he spent the weekend.
 
He spoke with reporters at Dover Air Force Base in this is something he emphasized saying that an all-out war in the Middle East should be avoided, needs to be avoided. Here is what he told reporters.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REPORTER: Can an all-out war in the Middle East be avoided?
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It has to be. We really have to avoid it. We've already taken precautions relative to our embassies and personnel who wanted to leave, and -- but we're not there yet, but we're working like hell with the French and many others to see (inaudible). Thank you.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SERFATY: Now, notably, President Biden there also told reporters that he anticipates that he will speak with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu soon. We do not know when he will speak with him, only him revealing this morning, he will get on the phone with him at some point soon, and this comes Jim, as you know, the US assessment is that potentially, a very limited ground incursion into Turkey by the Israelis is on the potential drawing board, but US officials also tell CNN that they believed that that decision has not been made by Netanyahu yet.
 
So clearly a very important phone call in the coming days that President Biden have with the Israeli prime minister -- Jim.
 
SCIUTTO: Yes, clearly the US is invested, of course, the question is, is Israel invested in those ceasefire talks? And of course Hezbollah and any intermediaries.
 
Sunlen Serfaty at the White House, thanks so much.
 
Joining me now for perspective on the humanitarian costs of the war, expanding war now, inside Lebanon is Deepmala Mahla, chief humanitarian officer for CARE.
 
Thanks so much for joining us this afternoon.
 
DEEPMALA MAHLA, CHIEF HUMANITARIAN OFFICER, CARE: Of course, hello.
 
SCIUTTO: Now, we are hearing reports from my colleagues on the ground in Lebanon and seeing images of people fleeing for their lives, right? Some of them forced to sleep on the beach because they're not sure where is safe in Lebanon tonight.
 
What is the humanitarian situation there and how are the movements of all these people being handled as they flee the gunfire and the airstrikes?
 
MAHLA: The humanitarian situation, especially since last Friday is deteriorating very, very fast. As the airstrikes have intensified, now targeted not only to the south of the country, but also towards the suburbs of Beirut, Beqaa Valley and other locations.
 
What we are hearing is fear, chaos, panic, a lot of uncertainty, like several of the roads leading to Beirut from the Beqaa Valley and the south are flooded. People are desperate in fear, and so many shelters are being set up. Anything which can serve as a shelter, mostly schools and other buildings. Last when I checked, the total number of shelters set up across the country is 789, but it is really growing very fast and several of the community members, people, self-organized groups are trying to deliver aid, humanitarians like CARE are also on the ground trying to deliver aid.
 
But what is happening, Jim, actually, the number of people forcibly displaced is very high. The official number is around 233,000 this is the registered number. But in reality, it is probably around a million, and people were forced to be leaving behind everything --
 
SCIUTTO: Wow. That is an enormous --
 
MAHLA: -- everything they knew.
 
That's an enormous number, and while all of this is happening, it is putting a lot of pressure on the already strained electricity and water infrastructure.
 
SCIUTTO: Okay, let me ask you this then. Is CARE able to get the aid to those people where they need it? Are they able to get -- is CARE able to get additional aid into the country right now into Lebanon?
 <br>[15:45:10]
 
MAHLA: To a certain extent, but we are really struggling.
 
So far, we have been able to help some people with hot meals, safe drinking water, mattresses, blankets, pillows, hygiene kits, and dignity kits.
 
Tomorrow also, we plan to do some distributions, but we are really struggling because of first, the availability of commodities, the supply chain is disturbed. The roads are flooded and because of the airstrikes, our physical access is restricted and humanitarian personnel are also really going through a lot of mental trauma because what is happening in the last one week, especially the airstrikes on Friday, it has triggered the trauma of the Beirut explosion for many, many people.
 
And I must say, it breaks my heart to say this, but one more time, the price is being paid by the civilians. Women and children are being disproportionately affected.
 
SCIUTTO: I wonder about warnings that have gone out to civilians because I know for some strikes, the Israeli military has warned civilians to leave before those strikes happen. They did not prior to the strike on the Hezbollah leader, Nasrallah.
 
Have there been sufficient warnings given to civilians in your view about upcoming Israeli airstrikes?
 
MAHLA: What have been hearing after the massive air strikes which happened in Beirut on Friday, let's not forget that. They were in densely populated urban suburbs. And yes, we have heard of some evacuation orders, but what we are hearing, they are not systematic. They do not give people enough notice. And also for large numbers of people, tens and hundreds and thousands of people to move at an hour's or at a notice of certain hours is really not practical.
 
It actually creates a lot of panic and then the roads are flooded. People are going everywhere. There is no clarity where to go. Yes, shelters are being set up. NGOs and community members are doing their very best, but these evacuation orders, they are not sufficient. In my view, they are absolutely unfair.
 
What is happening right now? A complete disregard of international humanitarian law and there has to be focused on protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure. It is not there and it is not acceptable.
 
The people of Lebanon deserve and need an immediate ceasefire.
 
SCIUTTO: Too often, the civilians caught in the middle of that fire.
 
Deepmala Mahla of CARE, thanks so much for sharing a vision into the humanitarian cost of this.
 
And still to come on CNN NEWSROOM, as storm aftermath still being assessed in the south, we are live from Asheville, North Carolina, next, where there is truly extensive damage and flooding as you see in the pictures we've been showing, please do stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[15:52:49]
 
DEAN: Now, more on our top story.
 
The extremely challenging recovery efforts that are underway right now in the southeast after the Storm Helene ripped through that region, causing widespread historic destruction in some areas.
 
CNN's Rafael Romo is joining us live near Biltmore Village in Asheville, North Carolina. That is an area that has been devastated by flooding.
 
Rafael, walk us through what you're seeing there.
 
ROMO: Yes, Jessica, this behind me is Biltmore Avenue. It is one of the most affected areas here in Asheville, North Carolina. You can see the front end loaders working diligently here to try to clear the street, but there is a layer of mud that they still have to work through and if I walk this way, you're going to see in the background that Wendy's, there is a layer of mud all around it and its probably not going to open its doors anytime soon.
 
There is also a Long John Silvers on the other side that is also surrounded by debris and look at this gas station, there is a layer of mud all around it. So the chances of it being operational in the near future are slim to none.
 
And I wanted to show you this, Jessica, because if you multiply this by dozens, perhaps hundreds of times, you begin to get an idea of the kind of damage North Carolina, especially its western part is facing right now.
 
We heard earlier from Governor Roy Cooper who said that his request for a federal major disaster declaration has been approved by President Biden, so that's going to free funding to help this community and others in the state get the basic necessities. Water is a major problem right now because many people here and elsewhere in Western North Carolina have no running water.
 
The other problem that people are telling us about is, the fact that communication is hard, for the most part down. I am talking about mobile service, no internet. Part of the reason why the University of North Carolina Asheville decided to close its doors until October 9.
 
So the cleaning effort is barely beginning here, and officials have a lot to do.
 
They tell us that first responders are overwhelmed and the same goes for utility workers -- Jessica.

DEAN: So much devastation there.
 
All right, Rafael Romo for us. Thank you so much.
 
Still to come, we are just days away from a port strike on the East and Gulf Coasts, that may have a major ripple effect across the country. We are going to tell you where the shortages might be.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LINDY WEST, WRITER AND EXECUTIVE PRODUCER, "SHRILL": No one was having this conversation on television when I was 16.
 
TELL HOLLIDAY, MODEL: Yes. Do I feel like were completely there yet and rejoicing? No. But I wish I could tell the twelve-year-old me drinking Slim Fast on the way to school that I would be able to share space with you guys now.
 
WEST: It is so special to be here today because I don't feel like I get to have nuanced, complicated conversations about fatness and diet culture. It is so healing to me always to get to spend time with other fat people. HOLLIDAY: Wait, I'm fat?
 
WEST: It is such -- I mean, actually great news for you.
