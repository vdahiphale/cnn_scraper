(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BECKY ANDERSON, CNN HOST, CONNECT THE WORLD: It is six o'clock in the evening here in Abu Dhabi. I'm Becky Anderson. This is "Connect the World" 
 
 wherever you are watching. You are more than welcome, a crucial day of meetings for America's top diplomat in region. Right now he is in Israel, 
 
 after Masks proposed a three phase plan for a potential hostage release and ceasefire deal.
 
Well, a grim morning in Ukraine after a barrage of missiles hits six regions. We're live for you there in Kyiv. And what is Donald Trump's next 
 
 move after a federal appeals court ruled he is not immune from prosecution. Plus, Jordan can almost taste the victory as the country's football team 
 
 heads for the finals of the Asian Cup. 
 
Right, the markets in New York will open in about 30 minutes from now. 9:30 in the morning there, it is nine at present. And the indication is that 
 
 this least these stock markets in the U.S. will a little higher today. Let's see. Well, no deal and no way. An Israeli official close to 
 
 negotiation says there is no way Israel will accept a new counter proposal by Hamas, which itself responded to a plan aimed at releasing hostages in 
 
 exchange for a pause in fighting.
 
Hamas put forward a three phase proposal last night which included the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, something that Israel has 
 
 repeatedly rejected. Well, Jeremy Diamond is in Tel Aviv with the very latest from there. We know that the Secretary of State is now on the 
 
 ground. He's been in Egypt and Qatar. He started this trip in Saudi. So what do we know about what Israel's response is at this point to this 
 
 counter offer? 
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT: Well, the Secretary of State is discussing that with Israeli officials as we speed meetings with the 
 
 Israeli prime minister and his top cabinet as well as the president of Israel today. And we know that this comes as the ball is now firmly back in 
 
 Israel's court as it relates to this latest counterproposal from Hamas, which looks at three phases consisting each of 45 days.
 
If you look at the first phase of this deal, it's actually not all that dissimilar from what Israel agreed to as part of this broad framework 
 
 proposal that was sent to Hamas about 10 days ago. And that's because it looks at the same types of individuals who would be released in that first 
 
 phase, women, children, the sick, the elderly, in exchange for an intensification of humanitarian aid and the withdrawal of Israeli forces 
 
 from key population centers in Gaza. 
 
There is however, a key point of disagreement here, because Hamas seems to be calling for the release of all Palestinians detained by the Israeli 
 
 military since October 7th. An Israeli official making clear that that is a red line for Israel, they will not release any individuals who were 
 
 involved in the October 7th terrorist attacks on Israel.
 
And then when you get to phases two and three, that's where the real brunt of the disagreement stands between Israel and Hamas. And that's because as 
 
 soon as phase two, Hamas is already outlining the withdrawal, the total withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip. And then in phase three, 
 
 you would see the exchange of bodies and the remains of the deceased. 
 
So the major question now, Becky, is whether or not that is an insurmountable gap. The idea of a total withdrawal of Israeli forces, the 
 
 end of this war effectively, which is something that the Israeli prime minister has said, he will not agree to. And whether or not they could 
 
 reach an agreement on the first phase of this at least and move forward with that first phase while they continue to negotiate for what would 
 
 happen after those initial six weeks. 
 
We know that the United States, the president said yesterday that he found Hamas's initial response, a little over the top. And today Secretary of 
 
 State Blinken is certainly discussing that with Israeli officials to see whether or not there is a path forward. 
 
But important to keep in mind that this is a negotiation, there was no way in which Hamas's counterproposal was going to be immediately accepted by 
 
 Israel. And so now the hard work will indeed continue for how much longer remains to be seen. 
 
ANDERSON: Yeah, I mean, what has happened is that the ball is back in the Israeli court as it were, at this point. At least that will be the 
 
 perception from this region, a region that is called for a ceasefire, a phrase that is echoed around the region where I am. 
 <br>[09:05:00]
 
Question will be at this point, how much pressure might the U.S. at this point bring to bear on Israel at least to provide a sort of, you know, a 
 
 schedule, a process through this and indication of how long this might go on. That is why we care about this. And that is why it makes our headlines. 
 
 Jeremy, thank you. 
 
Well, Ukraine says a massive Russian missile attack has hit cities across the country. Four people were killed by a strike on Kyiv early on 
 
 Wednesday. 38 others were injured including a pregnant woman according to local officials. There you can see large fires burning across several 
 
 stories of this apartment building, parts of the Capitol were also left without power. 
 
One person was killed in the southern city of Mykolaiv where officials say 20 buildings there on out without their roofs. Let's get you to CNN's 
 
 Senior International Correspondent Fred Pleitgen live in Kyiv. We are seeing images of destruction in Kyiv. 
 
The capital, we have Mykolaiv back in the headlines again at this point. Where are we at, Fred, just given us as an assessment of what is going on 
 
 here. I mean, this is as the EU's Foreign Policy Chief Josep Burrell, of course, is currently visiting the country and we've heard from him about 
 
 these attacks. 
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, we certainly have, he was the one who said that he had to go into bomb shelter 
 
 earlier today. And he wasn't alone. A lot of people here in the Ukrainian capital had to do exactly the same thing. And you know, when you're asking 
 
 where we are at, this is really one of the first really large scale Russian missile attacks that we have seen in quite a while. 
 
And I think, you know, two things that you point out are definitely really important about this. One of them is that they happened in the entire 
 
 country. Some of the reasons that you mentioned are in the south of the country. But there were also missile strikes that took place in the west of 
 
 the country as well. Then also in the border regions in the sort of Northeast close to the border with Russia, they get shelled by missiles a 
 
 lot. 
 
But I would say that the brunt of things certainly happened right here in the Ukrainian capital. And, you know, we've seen some of those images that 
 
 you were just showing of that apartment block that was on fire, obviously largely destroyed by what we believe may have been debris from a missile 
 
 that was shot down by anti-aircraft, missiles by the air defense systems that here in around the Ukrainian capital.
 
But it certainly shows that the Russians definitely wanted to do a lot of damage with these strikes. It's unclear why that is. One reason could be 
 
 because the Ukrainians recently successfully sank a Russian warship in occupied Crimea and that certainly would have been something that has hurt 
 
 the Russians a great deal.
 
In any case for the residents here of the Capitol, it was a -- terrifying morning. This went on, and then this is the second part, part of the thing 
 
 that I think is very important. This is something that went on for an extended period of time. There was a first wave of missiles that struck the 
 
 Capitol then for a while we thought things had quieted down. But then we learned that a second wave of missiles was coming. 
 
And the other thing I think that we've seen once again, that a lot of these western anti-air defense systems or air defense systems are functioning 
 
 extremely well. We saw them at work above the Ukrainian Capitol today. It certainly is an awe inspiring thing to see as those missiles take down to 
 
 shoot down some of the incoming that's coming from the Russians. 
 
One of the things Becky that the Ukrainians seem to be dealing with is that they are able to shoot down a lot of the missiles that the Russians are 
 
 firing. They say about two thirds of them were shot down. But there's certain missile types that the Russians fire that are extremely difficult 
 
 for the Ukrainians to come to terms with there's a ballistic missile called the Iskander, where apparently a couple of those hit.
 
And then also one called the X22, which is gigantic cruise missiles that actually made to destroy aircraft carriers, the Ukrainian saying extremely 
 
 hard for them. They of course have been saying they need more air defense systems. And the one thing that really is a concern for the Ukrainians is 
 
 what if the missiles for the anti-tank (ph) for the air defense systems that the U.S. sent what if those run low or run out that would of course be 
 
 a huge concern for the Ukrainians, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Good to have you. Thank you. Fred Pleitgen is on the ground. Well in Pakistan, multiple blasts set of what are Thursday's elections have 
 
 killed at least 22 people in the state of Baluchistan. Local officials say 12 people were killed in the first blast at an independent candidate's 
 
 office, and another 10 were killed in a second explosion at the election office of a different candidate.
 
According to the U.N. Human Rights Commission and there have been at least 24 attacks by armed groups against candidates from various parties in the 
 
 lead up to this vote. Well, Thursday's general election will be the first since the collapse of Imran Khan's government of course in 2022. 
 <br>[09:10:00]
 
The former prime minister remains wildly popular, but he is currently imprisoned on multiple convictions and banned from contesting. Meantime, 
 
 the country is facing mounting economic uncertainty. My colleague CNN's Anna Coren has more. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANNA COREN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The aftermath of an explosion in Southern Pakistan, just one of a string of attacks targeting political 
 
 candidates across the country. So as the nation of more than 230 million people prepares to go to the polls, there's an air of unease. Pakistan's 
 
 widely popular Former Prime Minister Imran Khan is behind bars, charged with corruption and revealing state secrets and is banned from running in 
 
 the election. He denies any wrongdoing. 
 
After Khan was arrested by paramilitary police in May last year, his supporters took to the streets some of them out. What followed was an 
 
 extensive crackdown, by what many say was led by the country's powerful military, a claim it denied. Protesters were detained, journalists 
 
 censored. Among those jailed, social media activist Sanam Javaid, a supporter of Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf or PTI party. 
 
The 36-year-old mother of two is facing terrorism charges; accused of inciting her thousands of followers to commit arson on the day Khan was 
 
 arrested. She denies the charges. Her father says her incarceration is an example of authorities silencing dissenting voices.
 
IQBAL JAVED, FATHER OF SANAM JAVED: I know that all of this is fake and created and being done to victimize the political party of Imran Khan. This 
 
 is a political case. 
 
COREN (voice-over): Pakistan's Information Minister denied those claims, saying law enforcers and prosecutors had evidence against Javed. With the 
 
 fall of Imran Khan has come the return and rise in popularity of his predecessor, Nawaz Sharif. Sharif is back in Pakistan after corruption 
 
 charges led to years of self-imposed exile. He's now widely expected to win a historic fourth term. 
 
TIM WILLASEY-WILSEY, POLITICAL ANALYST: The good prognosis is that Sharif is elected. He builds a coalition which includes Bilawal Bhutto and starts 
 
 to run the country pragmatic. But he's a pragmatist and starts to you know, balance relations between U.S. and China get the economy back on track. 
 
COREN (voice-over): Standing between Sharif and the top job is Bilawal Bhutto Zardari. The 35-year-old is descended from one of Pakistan's 
 
 political dynasties. Yet even with Zardari's useful appeal, many young voters have been left disillusioned by Pakistan's recent political 
 
 disorder. 
 
RAJA IKRAM, ISLAMABAD RESIDENT: The whole country knows that the decision has already been made.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't think stability will come because I think after the elections a lot of problems will be created. 
 
HASSAN, LAHORE RESIDENT: We as the voter feel disenfranchised because even if a certain government comes into play all governments have -- feel 
 
 disappointed us at most levels. 
 
COREN (voice-over): Pakistan faces mounting challenges from economic issues to climate catastrophes and militant attacks. Just last month, Pakistan and 
 
 Iran carried out strikes against alleged militant targets in each other's territory, citing the threat of terrorist attacks. For Pakistan and its 
 
 people, unified government after years of uncertainty will be a must to avoid tension spilling beyond the country's borders. Anna Coren, CNN, Hong

ANDERSON: Well you're watching "Connect the World" with me Becky Anderson. Still ahead this evening, a U.S. appeals court deals a big blow to Donald 
 
 Trump as lawyers for the U.S. Republican presidential front runner prepared to argue another case before the U.S. Supreme Court. More on that is coming 
 
 up. And the heir to the British throne soldiers on putting a brave face on a rough time for the royal family. We are live in London, after this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:15:00]
 
ANDERSON: Former U.S. President Donald Trump will not be at the Supreme Court tomorrow for arguments over what is the Colorado decision to 
 
 disqualify him from that state's primary ballot. That's at least according to sources familiar with his plans. That decision coming not long after a 
 
 federal appeals court ruled. 
 
Trump is not immune from prosecution for alleged crimes that he committed during his presidency tied of course to the January the sixth Insurrection. 
 
 Trump is likely to appeal that case to the Supreme Court. Look, those cases are all part of a presidential campaign season like no other in the United 
 
 States with the Republican front runner bouncing between primary races and court dates. 
 
Let's break this all down with Katelyn Polantz. And let's start with that appeals court ruling which had some very blunt language rejecting Trump's 
 
 immunity argument. Just briefly explain if you will. 
 
KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE REPORTER: Yeah, Becky, what the appeals court did in D.C. yesterday in Donald Trump's criminal case in 
 
 the federal court related to the 2020 election, they said that it should go forward and it must go forward in the court system. He has been charged by 
 
 a grand jury even though Donald Trump has tried to make claims that he has immunity because he was serving as president after the 2020 election.
 
The court said the president is not above the law. The court system has the ability to try the president even if he has been impeached in Congress for 
 
 those same sorts of actions. And also the specific things that Donald Trump is accused of doing, obstructing the vote, trying to obstruct Congress, a 
 
 conspiracy to overturn the result of the 2020 election, what voters were casting their ballots for to elect Joe Biden as President and not him. 
 
That's exactly the sort of thing that a person could be held accountable for in the court system. And so, this was a thorough ruling. It was a 
 
 unanimous ruling; it was 57 pages coming only four weeks after oral arguments were heard, so quite a lot that the appeals court tackled in a 
 
 very short amount of time. 
 
And that calendar that you were showing just a minute ago, Becky that can make your head spin. But even the next couple of days are going to be 
 
 extremely busy for Donald Trump in court. So we have this decision from the appeals court yesterday. And in six days from that moment, Monday, he is 
 
 due to go to the Supreme Court to try and delay his case further if he wants to continue challenging his criminal case or else.
 
It goes back into the hands of the trial court, and he's back on the path to trial, making it very possible even likely that he sits for trial this 
 
 year as a criminal defendant doesn't even include tomorrow, the separate case where Donald Trump and his personal lawyers are arguing before the 
 
 Supreme Court.
 
ANDERSON: I'm exhausted just listening to you. I can't imagine what it feels like to be Donald Trump and his team at present. There you go. Not my 
 
 job to imagine how it feels to be Donald Trump and his team. We are reporting the news as we get it. Thank you. 
 
Let's get you up to speed on some of the other stories that are on our radar right now. These are important. Former Chinese -- sorry, let me start 
 
 that again. Former President of Chile Sebastian Pinera has died in a helicopter crash according to his office. The chopper went down in Southern 
 
 Chile on Tuesday. 
 <br>[09:20:00]
 
The cause of the crash is under investigation according to authorities. 74- year-old served as president twice. Well, militants in Indonesia's West Papua region are urging a rebel leader to free a New Zealand pilot 
 
 kidnapped one year ago today. The tribal warlord has threatened to kill Philip Mehrtens unless New Zealand pressures Indonesia to allow West Papua 
 
 to become an independent state. 
 
That has not happened a year on the militancy killing Mehrtens will only serve to hurt their cause. Lufthansa says it expects to cancel up to 90 
 
 percent, nine zero, 90 percent of its flights out of Germany today amid a ground crew strike. Media reports say the strikes service salary impacting 
 
 about 100,000 passengers. Lufthansa urged passengers to not travel to airports in Germany. 
 
Well, Prince William is resuming his royal duties for the first time since his wife Princess Catherine had surgery last month. And this of course also 
 
 follows the cancer diagnosis of his father King Charles, III, which has shocked the UK. A royal source telling CNN, William will not meet with his 
 
 brother, Prince Harry who flew to Britain from California on Tuesday to see his father. 
 
But some reports in the UK media say the heir to the throne is expected to speak about what his family has been going through in recent days. Well, 
 
 Anna Stewart covering all of this from London. Look, I mean, anytime there's a whiff of sort of, you know, interest in the royal family I mean, 
 
 the media are all over, including Prince Harry arriving to see his dad in the UK.
 
As I understand it, he's gone. But after years of estrangement between father and son, this meeting is fueling speculation of a possible 
 
 reconciliation, which people care about. So what do we know of that? 
 
ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, we are never short on speculation. And wouldn't you like to be a fly on the wall to see some beautiful family 
 
 reunion. But the truth of the matter is, we really don't know. We're aware that there was a meeting between Prince Harry and his father, it was 
 
 apparently quite a brief meeting, because we saw the king had to Sandringham shortly afterwards. 
 
And it's unclear whether there'll be a follow up another meeting at this stage. But I think the images of Prince Harry were really in stark 
 
 contrast, of course, to what we're seeing today. You see him there in the back of a car, living, of course, his private life. And on the flip side, 
 
 we're today seeing Prince William, his brother go about his business back to work, having taken a few weeks off to support his wife following her 
 
 surgery. 
 
And this is a real test of character coming back to work just after he's learned that his father has this cancer diagnosis. And of course, he has to 
 
 take on more work as a result of this, because he's got to take on some of the additional public facing engagements that the king would have had in 
 
 the coming weeks. Now you're seeing Prince William there at an investiture that was earlier today.
 
And you're seeing him in a much more formal role with something like this sort of ceremony. We're seeing him in the uniform of the aid camp to the 
 
 king. And it's an interesting one, because we're so used to seeing Prince William and on many types of engagements, often bringing a more casual 
 
 element to the role, often without a tie. But there is this other side to the job. 
 
And I think this is what we'll see more and more from him in the coming weeks given he's got to take on this additional work. And in many ways, 
 
 it's giving us a flavor of perhaps what's to come in the future. You know, this is the job that he will take on one day. 
 
ANDERSON: Good to have you. 
 
STEWART: Pleasure. 
 
ANDERSON: Stunning new report reveals how Boeing's 737 plane lost a panel mid-flight. She'll remember this, the key pieces of that plane that were 
 
 missing and how that blew the door plug out is coming up. And the result of what is a landmark case in the United States, testing the legal limits of 
 
 whether a parent can be held responsible for a school shooting that their child committed, more on that after this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:25:00]
 
ANDERSON: Welcome back. 27 minutes past six here in Abu Dhabi, I'm Becky Anderson. You're watching "Connect the World". Four bolts were missing on 
 
 the Boeing 737 Max 9 passenger jet when the Alaska Airlines flight blew out the door plug last month. 
 
The stunning revelation comes from U.S. aviation investigators after the event, or Max 9 jets were grounded for 19 days. And it has also reignited 
 
 concern over Boeing's fatal Max 8 crashes in 2018 and 2019. CNN's Aviation Correspondent Pete Muntean has more on this latest investigation. 
 
PETE MUNTEAN, CNN AVIATION CORRESPONDENT: This is a bombshell from the National Transportation Safety Board. The investigation of this incident 
 
 has focused on the door plug bolts from the start. Four bolts like this one hold the door plug onto the side of a Boeing 737 Max. There are two at the 
 
 top and two at the bottom. Both Alaska and United Airlines said they found planes in their fleets with loose bolts. And now the NTSB says, Alaska 1282 
 
 was missing all four bolts. 
 
How are they able to tell? Well, investigators recovered the door plug from a backyard in Portland. They brought it to a lab in DC for inspection. And 
 
 the NTSB saw damage patterns that showed the door plug moved up and out. They also noted a lack of damage around the bolt holes meaning the bolts 
 
 were not there. Here's the smoking gun and the NTSB report. 
 
It says the four bolts that prevent upward movement of the door plug were missing before the door plug moved. There is one more amazing detail here. 
 
 The NTSB suggests this plane flew for two months without the door plug bolts, meaning it was essentially a ticking time bomb. The fuse set last 
 
 September at Boeing's Renton factory when the plane was still being built. 
 
Boeing removed the door plug to do repair work on some nearby rivets. This is the photo taken when the work was completed. And the NTSB says it shows 
 
 the door was put back. But the bolts were not. Is only pours gas on the FAA's audit of Boeing quality control? The head of the FAA told Congress 
 
 yesterday that it now has two dozen inspectors at the 737 factory. 
 
No finding of blame or probable cause yet that will probably come out in the NTSB's final report about a year from now. Right now Boeing CEO Dave 
 
 Calhoun says, whatever the final report says Boeing is accountable for what happened, back to you. 
 
ANDERSON: And for the first time in the United States, a parent of a school shooter is being held directly responsible for the crime to their child 
 
 committed. 
 <br>[09:30:00]
 
Jennifer Crumbley was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter on Tuesday, more than two years after her son killed four students at a Michigan High 
 
 School. CNN's Whitney Wild has more on what is this unprecedented case. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We find the defendant guilty of involuntary manslaughter. 
 
WHITNEY WILD, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): 45-year-old Jennifer Crumbley found guilty becoming the first parent in U.S. history to 
 
 be held criminally responsible for a mass shooting committed by their child. 
 
Crumbley's son is already serving life in prison for murdering four students Hannah St. Juliana, Justin Shilling, Madison Baldwin and Tate Meir 
 
 and wounding seven other people at his high school in Oxford, Michigan in 2021, when he was 15.
 
CRAIG SHILLING, FATHER OF SHOOTING VICTIM JUSTIN SHILLING: It was a long time coming, but it's definitely a step toward accountability, like what 
 
 we've been talking about. It's kind of been our goal the whole time. 
 
WILD (voice-over): Over the nine day trial, prosecutors argued that Crumbley ignored warning signs her son was a threat and failed to lock up a 
 
 firearm and ammunition he used to kill his classmates. Prosecutors pointed out that hours before the rampage, Crumbley's school administrators and the 
 
 shooter had a meeting over this violent drawing on his math worksheet.
 
Crumbley didn't pull her son from classes, despite being told he needed help. And never told school administrators she had given her son a gun and 
 
 ammunition.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You didn't tell them that you had gotten him that Christmas gift. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't think it was relevant, no. 
 
WILD (voice-over): Prosecutors argued that Crumbley could have prevented the killings, but instead did nothing. 
 
KAREN MCDONALD, OAKLAND COUNTY PROSECUTOR: She walked out of that school, when just the smallest, smallest of things could have saved Hannah, and 
 
 Tate and Madison and Justin. And not only did she not do it, she doesn't even regret it. 
 
WILD (voice-over): Defense Attorneys argued Crumbley didn't know about her son's deteriorating mental health and had no way to predict the shooting. 
 
JENNIFER CRUMBLEY, MOTHER OF OXFORD HIGH SCHOOL SHOOTER: Of course I look back after this all happened and I've asked myself if I will have done 
 
 anything differently. And I wouldn't know. 
 
SHANNON SMITH, DEFENSE ATTORNEY: That the Crumbley's son was a skilled manipulator and they didn't realize it. 
 
WILD (voice-over): But prosecutors grilled Crumbley on the warning signs they said she ignored, including a phrase her son wrote in the drawing 
 
 found by his teacher the morning of the shooting. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What about the thoughts once stop helped me, does that ring out to you?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, that was concerning to me. 
 
WILD (voice-over): The jury foreperson described the evidence that sealed the guilty verdict.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The thing that really hammered at home is that, she was the last adult with the gun. 
 
SHILLING: You cannot choose to take your own interest over your child, especially when it comes to mental health and addressing concerns. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
WILD (on camera): Jennifer Crumbley faces up to 15 years in prison. Meanwhile, the shooter's father and Jennifer Crumbley's husband James 
 
 Crumbley is also charged with four counts of involuntary manslaughter. He's set to go to trial March 5th Whitney Wild, CNN Pontiac, Michigan.
 
ANDERSON: Well, two titans of women's tennis on the court here in Abu Dhabi tonight. My interview with Ons Jabeur is up next and so close and yet so 
 
 far. Jordan advances to the final of the Asian cup dreaming of victory.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:35:00]
 
ANDERSON: Right. Tennis stars Ons Jabeur and Emma Raducanu face off on the court tonight just about an hour or so from now here in Abu Dhabi. The two 
 
 are playing in the Mubadala Abu Dhabi Open, a WTA event. Now Ons Jabeur is the first Arab woman to reach three Grand Slam finals. The World Food 
 
 Program, also just announcing she is its newest, global goodwill ambassador.
 
I spoke to Emma and you heard part of that interview yesterday, just earlier this week. And I spoke to Ons as well about what her -- what it 
 
 means for her to work with the WFP. We also talked about the situation in Gaza and the upcoming tennis season, have a listen. 
 
ONS JABEUR, TENNIS PLAYER: Feels amazing. You know, I played the exhibition here before. I was sad that I missed last year, but I'm glad to be back. 
 
 And you know, healthy to play the tournament. You know, I always love to be here if it's like home, so looking forward to see all the fans.
 
ANDERSON: What do you think of the draw?
 
JABEUR: Tough. I mean, I was expecting it to be tough for sure. Everyone wants to come and play here, but you know, I love tough competition, I'm 
 
 ready for it. And hopefully the crowd will help me be motivated and win the matches. 
 
ANDERSON: The crowd will absolutely be behind you. Not least of course, because you are the first Arab Muslim and African woman to reach a Grand 
 
 Slam final. And the crowds here always love seeing you. How important is that representation to you in this sport?
 
JABEUR: I think is very important. Growing up, I wanted to be you know, inspired by other players. But when you see, you see different players from 
 
 different countries, you know, but no one basically from the Arab world, but you want to be inspired by that. You know, we had a lot of different 
 
 players, but you always want to push more and show that it's not impossible to win, especially a grand slam.
 
ANDERSON: Ons, who were you inspired by being growing up?
 
JABEUR: Not to lie to you. My mom -- my mom was my inspiration. She teaches me how to be this tough girl to always try and win everything. And yeah 
 
 obviously when I grew up a little bit, I watched Kim Plaisirs (ph) playing. She's a very nice girl and I met her also now, so it's really inspiring. 
 
ANDERSON: What is it about the sport and how much responsibility? Do you sort of feel to help and support these youngsters as they come through? 
 
JABEUR: I think it's important to have a certain relationship with these players; especially the transition from juniors to professional is very 
 
 tough. And I know that you know, so they're more friendly engineers, less very friendly and professional circuit. And I feel for these young players 
 
 that maybe they don't have a lot of experience and they're new and they want to find a friendly face. 
 
So they know me, I'm always open to talk to, to even like chat about random things, maybe not about fashion, because I saw him that level. But in any 
 
 other things I'm happy to give any advice. And I feel like it to be a friendly tour, but also a fierce competition on the court.
 
ANDERSON: How do you think you've done to date? What's the strategy for 2024? 
 
JABEUR: I think I had really good preparation, you know, maybe I didn't get into the competition very well. I think I need more matches. That's why I'm 
 
 playing you know, the full Abu Dhabi, Doha, Dubai to get myself ready. But definitely looking forward to play here and start my season much better 
 
 than I did in Australia Open. 
 
ANDERSON: It's an Olympic year. The season is busy enough, you know, on a regular year, what's the plan?
 
JABEUR: The plan is to be healthy. You know, as I said, it's tough. The year is already very tough with four grand slams, to add another kind of 
 
 Grand Slam is very tough. But you know, let's see how it goes. You know me and my goal is really wounded on, so let's see how that goes. 
 
ANDERSON: You have spoken not just tennis of late, but how tough it is to be from this region, in this region and you see what's going on in Gaza. 
 
 How has the situation in Gaza affected your season and you as an individual?
 
JABEUR: It's tough for me. I feel sometimes when I'm happy, I'm laughing, I should not be you know, because to have children, woman, men dying every 
 
 day even honestly journalists you know, it's very tough to see that.

And I wish the world could wake up and do something about it. I'm trying to support as much as I can. I'm trying to speak up as much as I can. But 
 
 yeah, I'm not going to be quiet. I will speak, speak up and speak about this. This is a human thing to do so. I'm not trying to get into politics 
 
 or anything. This is me as a human being trying to do the right thing. 
 
ANDERSON: Just talk about the work that you're doing off the court?
 
JABEUR: I think it's important to show the human side of me and always wanted to help. So launching my foundation and be part of an amazing 
 
 organization as the WFP in the world that I'm trying to help people for now. More, you know, in Gaza with WFP and with my foundation, hopefully, 
 
 I'm trying to help my country and help Africa in general. Hopefully help the children and woman in need.
 
ANDERSON: Is this setting you up for a life after tennis. I mean, is this where you want to focus your attention? 
 
JABEUR: I think so. Yeah, I need to set up a certain thing from you know, after career and me helping others is one of the things I want to focus on. 
 
 And, and definitely, you know, I felt like if when I was young, I probably needed help as well. So if I can give that help to kids, I think that will 
 
 change the world. 
 
ANDERSON: Well, Ons Jabeur is on court tonight against Emma Raducanu in the Abu Dhabi Open. That's for a place so whoever wins that gets placed in the 
 
 quarterfinals. That's what's up for grabs. Raducanu, of course is only in her third tournament since she came back from injury. And she says she 
 
 knows that the crowd will be behind Ons Jabeur tonight. 
 
But I've got to tell you, I mean, Ons is a fantastic woman. Emma's such a fantastic woman as well. She will have a great deal of support here in Abu 
 
 Dhabi. So we wish them both the best. Well, fans of the Jordanian football team are ecstatic after last night, and for a very good reason.
 
The country has reached the Asian Cup final for the first time beating South Korea, no less to nil. The final is on Saturday. The question is who 
 
 will win the other sports? Amanda Davies joining me now, what are your thoughts? 
 
AMANDA DAVIES, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR: Yeah, Becky as a huge second semifinal set to take to the pitch in not very long 15, 20 minutes or so Iran against 
 
 Qatar. Very much the favorites you suspect the winner of this one heading into the final against Jordan after what has been without doubt the biggest 
 
 moment of their footballing history. 
 
Jordan, a country who only qualified for the Asian Cup for the first time between two years ago is pulling off that stunning result to beat South 
 
 Korea, one of the top ranked sides in the region. Their coach just said to his team, just go out there and have fun, it certainly worked for them.
 
But it's not only the Asian Cup we're getting to the serious end of the competition, also semifinals day at the Africa Cup of Nations. And we got 
 
 more on that coming up as well in just a couple of minutes in "World Sport". 
 
ANDERSON: Well it was a cracking match last night. Let's hope for a cracking match, Qatar, Iran now. And I know you got a lot more as you say 
 
 from the African Cup, it's all about soccer. And that is "World Sport" after the short break, stay with us.
