THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
JIM ACOSTA, CNN HOST: You're live in the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.
 
We begin the hour with President Biden heading to Europe tomorrow to shore up alliances at a critical time. During his week-long trip, he will attend a NATO Summit and Russia's unprovoked war in Ukraine will be the big subject.
 
CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware for us where President Biden is spending the weekend.
 
Priscilla, NATO allies will have a lot to discuss, as well as this war in Ukraine is going to be a huge part of the conversation. What can you tell us?
 
PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: It's going to be the key topic of discussion as this war is ongoing, and especially as there are questions as to what aid can be provided to them in the long term.
 
So President Biden heading out tomorrow, he will start his trip in the United Kingdom where he is going to meet with King Charles, as well as the British prime minister.
 
He'll then move on to Lithuania where he will attend the NATO Summit and conclude his trip in Finland. But that NATO Summit is going to be critical and it is one in which there will be questions about whether Ukraine will be joining the alliance.
 
And yesterday, National Security adviser, Jake Sullivan told reporters that it is unlikely that they would come out of the Summit with Ukraine joining, but they could make steps in that direction.
 
And President Biden himself noted that it is premature for now for Ukraine to join, but the discussions will be about what could happen moving forward. Take a listen.

FAREED ZAKARIA, CNN HOST, "FAREED ZAKARIA GPS": When you go to the NATO Summit, the big strategic issue is that Ukraine wants membership in NATO. Should it get membership in NATO? JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I don't think it's ready for membership in NATO, but here is the deal -- I spent, as you know, a great deal of time trying to hold NATO together, because I believe Putin has had an overwhelming objective from the time he launched 185,000 troops in Ukraine and that was to break NATO.
 
He was confident in my view, and many in the intelligence community, he was confident he could break NATO. Holding NATO together is really critical. I don't think there is unanimity in NATO about whether or not to bring Ukraine into the NATO family now, at this moment in the middle of a war.
 
For example, if you did that, then, you know, we -- and I mean what I say, we're determined to commit every inch of territory that is NATO territory. It is a commitment that we've all made no matter what.
 
If the war is going on, then we're all in a war. You know, we're at war with Russia, if that were the case.
 
So I think we have to lay out a path, a rational path for Russia, for -- excuse me, for Ukraine to be able to qualify to get into NATO, and we have when the very first time I met with Putin two years ago in Geneva, and he said I want commitments on no Ukraine in NATO, I said, we're not going to do that, because it's an open door policy. We're not going to shut anybody out.
 
NATO is a process that takes some time to meet all the qualifications, from democratization to a whole range of other issues. So in the meantime, though, I've spoken with Zelenskyy at length about this, and one of the things I indicated is the United States would be ready to provide while the process was going on, and it's going to take a while, while that process is going on, to provide security ala the security we provide for Israel, providing the weaponry, the needs, the capacity to defend themselves, if there is an agreement, if there is a ceasefire, if there is a peace agreement.
 
And so I think we can work it out, but I think it's premature to say, to call for a vote, you know, now, because there are other qualifications that it would need to meet, including democratization and some of those issues.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ALVAREZ: This issue of Ukraine potentially becoming a member in the future will be a flashpoint in the gathering next week, and President Biden would be a key player determining for example, criteria, or timelines, but you heard him there say that there is commitments that the United States is providing to Ukraine as the war is ongoing, including for example now sending cluster munitions to Ukraine, which has come under some controversy within members of President Biden's own party.
 <br>[18:05:11]
 
So the question of whether Ukraine will be part of the alliance in the future and what aid will look like moving forward will be looming over the Summit next week -- Jim.
 
ACOSTA: All right, Priscilla Alvarez, thank you very much.
 
And you can see the entire interview with President Biden tomorrow at 10:00 AM Eastern on "Fareed Zakaria: GPS" right here on CNN.
 
We are also learning new details about a potential prisoner swap with Russia.
 
Yesterday, White House National Security adviser, Jake Sullivan confirmed there have been discussions regarding the release of "Wall Street Journal" reporter, Evan Gershkovich. Friday marked 100 days since the 31-year-old American was first detained in Russia.
 
And joining us now to discuss all this is former governor of New Mexico, Bill Richardson. He's also a former US ambassador to the United Nations. He has long been a key figure in bringing wrongfully detained Americans home.
 
Governor, great to see you. Mr. Ambassador, great to see you. The White House says so far, there is no clear pathway to Gershkovich's release, but talks are continuing. I suppose the fact that the talks are happening is a good sign.
 
BILL RICHARDSON, FORMER US AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS: It is a good sign.
 
I'm not part of those talks. I mean, we've got three other hostages in Russia we're working on, but good sign. One, the Russian Foreign Ministry says talks are ongoing. Two, access was given to the American ambassador for Evan. That's positive.
 
I'm concerned. I'm concerned. I think that we've got to move forward on a lot of other issues. I'm concerned with this cluster bomb decision. I think it's wrongheaded. I think it kind of complicates relationships on the prisoner issue.
 
I'm concerned that it has been inconsistent international law. Our allies aren't doing it, but we'll see.
 
I think the president has done a good job of bringing NATO countries unified on Ukraine. I want us to help Ukraine, but again, on the prisoner issue, I'm concerned that we're not moving forward.
 
We've got to find a way, Jim, to get Paul Whelan as part of the discussions with "The Wall Street Journal" reporter. It's got to be a package that involves both. We can't leave Paul Whelan, the Marine behind.
 
ACOSTA: And you are involved with those discussions. I want to talk about cluster munitions in a moment, but you are involved in those discussions in securing the release of Brittney Griner, and Paul Whelan was not a part of that arrangement and that swap.
 
I'm just curious, since you mentioned Paul Whelan, in his case, is it possible this time around, that he could be part of a package deal with Evan Gershkovich. You hate to talk about it in that fashion, a package deal, but I know -- I've talked to the Whelan family. They are just desperate to get him out of there.
 
RICHARDSON: Well, we have to include Whelan with Gershkovich. We can't just do one or the other. It's got to be a package.
 
And I supported the president. I think that he did the right thing with Griner and Bout, the arms dealer, but I think now we have to move beyond that. And there are other like American hostages in Russia that are not high profile that we need to deal with, we need to find ways to help them.
 
But I think the relationship right now is at the lowest step ever, but the Russians, you never know what they're going to do. It could be an effort that it is going to take a little time, I mean, with Evan. He is detained until the end of August. But at the same time the Russians are ready to deal at any time. It depends on many other factors.
 
But you know, I worry. I never tried to mix the issues of geopolitical issues with human rights issues. I think human rights issues, prisoner changes, it is going to take prisoner changes to bring Evan, "The Wall Street Journal" reporter back and Paul Whelan.
 
But you know, when we mix all of these other geopolitical issues, I support the president's policy in Ukraine, but I think this cluster bomb issue, I don't know why we are doing it.
 
ACOSTA: Yes, let me ask me about that. Let me ask you about that because you heard the president talk about this with our Fareed Zakaria. He defended the decision to make cluster munitions part of this latest military aid package to the Ukrainians.
 
The president said he did wrestle with the decision, but ultimately decided after talking to his advisers, that it was the right thing to do.
 
If you were in the president's -- in that team of advisers talking to the president about this, it sounds as though you would have advised him against this, why?
 <br>[18:10:03]
 
RICHARDSON: I would have, because first of all we've given -- we're supporting Ukraine, $40 billion plus ammunition, all kinds of military assistance. Our allies are not supportive. Germany and France are not doing it.
 
I think it's inconsistent with international law. I worry about civilians, non-combatants getting exposed to this. So I'm concerned, I don't know who advised the president on this. I'm sure that he has got a capable National Security team, but apart from the prisoner issue, I don't see the justification.
 
So it's not a liberal or conservative issue, it is a military issue, it is a moral issue. America stands against -- well, we're for human rights. We are not for exposing our moral issues to finding ways to do this kind of action. So I'm very concerned.
 
ACOSTA: I want to ask you about what we saw a couple of weeks ago with the Wagner Group, and they're attempted insurrection last month.
 
What do you think that impact is going to be on Putin's authority in Russia? Do you see a destabilization there around Putin? Or has he been able to patch things up and put himself in a position where essentially, he was able to suppress what Prigozhin and Wagner was attempting to do, at least temporarily?
 
RICHARDSON: Well, it might -- you know, I've spent a lot of time on Russian issues. I think, it has exposed instability in Putin's leadership, but I think he is in control. I think it exposed the vulnerability.
 
We don't know the answer on this. You've got all of these speculative people saying this is going to -- we don't know. But right now, I think he's still in control. He's still in charge.
 
I think it has exposed a vulnerability, but at the same time, I think -- I am encouraged, Jim, with some reports I've seen that the Biden administration is talking to track through channels, unofficial channels to Russia. I think that's good.
 
I think we have to find a way to deal with these issues, these strategic issues. We're totally behind Ukraine, I am for them, but I think for the instability that exist in that region of the world, the fact that Russians have thousands of nuclear weapons, we've got to find a way to bring some stability to the region. So, I'm encouraged with those negotiations.
 
I'm also discouraged by this cluster bottom decision, which I think strategically doesn't make sense. It's against our moral authority. It's inconsistent with our allies, Germany and France aren't doing it. There's a treaty against this. So, a very volatile situation.
 
My main objective is the prisoners, American hostages. There are 59 around the world in Iran, Venezuela, Russia. We have to bring him back, especially in Iran and Russia and Venezuela. That's what we should try to do.
 
ACOSTA: All right, former UN ambassador, Bill Richardson, thank you very much for your time. Always good to talk to you. Appreciate it.
 
RICHARDSON: Thank you.
 
ACOSTA: All right, we are working on some breaking news right now out of New York City. Police say a man on a scooter shot four people killing one of them. A live update is just ahead.
 
Plus, former President Donald Trump says his poll numbers are rising. What effect might that have on President Biden's campaign? Our political panel weighs in.
 
And a soccer trailblazer announces her retirement. We'll have a look at Megan Rapinoe's impact on and off the field. You're live in the CNN NEWSROOM.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:18:02]
 
ACOSTA: Speaking to Iowa's farming industry, former President Donald Trump continue to play a game of chicken with federal prosecutors. Trump spent a big chunk of his speech yesterday griping about his own legal troubles while taking swipes at his GOP rivals.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It's no wonder the swamp is getting truly desperate as they see us leading very big in the polls. They're getting crazy.
 
Well, that's why every time I get a subpoena, you know, my polls go up. I get more and more subpoenas. The weaponization of the Department of Justice and the FBI, we have never had anything like this and it is all [bleep], too. It is all stuff --
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ACOSTA: Former president using some barnyard language there.
 
Joining us now to discuss that and more of today's top political stories, CNN senior political commentator and former assistant to President George W. Bush, Scott Jennings; and CNN political commentator and Democratic strategist, Maria Cardona.
 
Scott, let me start with you. What is going on with more legal trouble Donald Trump seems to be getting in? It seems to have an inverse effect on his poll numbers. At some point, does he stop defying gravity?
 
SCOTT JENNINGS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, great question.
 
I mean, we don't know. He hasn't yet. His people believe all of these legal troubles are just evidence that there is this cabal of, you know, actors out there trying to tear him down, and so they dig in even more.
 
I mean, I think about half the party wants to go with Trump again, and about half the party wants to do something else. The trouble is the half of the party that doesn't, is all fragmented up among everybody from Ron DeSantis to all the other people who are in the race.
 
And so while that fragmentation is still occurring, it really won't matter what happens to Donald Trump because if his people stick, he is destined to get the nomination.
 
So my sense is that he is either going to collapse or he's not. I don't know if money or anything else is really going to make the difference here. People are either going to decide they've had enough or they won't and right now, they seem to be okay with it. ACOSTA: and some of them might be affected by current events, but I mean in the meantime, Trump is leading his closest opponent, Ron DeSantis.
 <br>[18:20:10]
 
Let me put this up on screen -- by more than 30 percentage points. That's up from earlier this year.
 
Maria, if you're a member of Biden's re-election team, how do you bet the farm at this point to go back to some of the farming vernacular there.
 
MARIA CARDONA, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I think right now --
 
ACOSTA: Is that 00 I mean, does that -- should that be a concern to Democrats, that as he gets into more legal trouble, his poll numbers seem to do better? Or is it just a phenomenon on the Republican side?
 
CARDONA: Well, I think Democrats would be smart to never assume that the election is going to be easy, right, no matter who the presidential primary opponent is going to be on the other side, even if it's Donald Trump, right?
 
I think Joe Biden will win if it is Joe Biden versus Donald Trump. I think the winner if it is DeSantis, too. But I think Democrats will be smart to focus on what the administration and Joe Biden and Democrats need to be doing right now, which is talking up every single proposal, accomplishment, massive economic growth that is happening right now, the Bidenomics tour.
 
I know Republicans love to sort of poo-poo it, but it is working. The numbers are showing that this has been the greatest economic growth post-pandemic of any country in the world, lowest inflation of any country in the world, massive job creation. That's what Democrats need to be focused on.
 
And look in terms of Donald Trump, it does seem like right now, in the presidential primary, his poll numbers continue to go up, the more he talks about all of his impeachments, all of his indictments, but I believe what will happen in the general election and why so many sane Republicans who don't want him as a nominee are worried is that then the mirror image, the inverse will happen, right?
 
You have sane Republicans, Independents, suburban women, every single other voter group that Trump would need in order to win is going to be saying that it's not what we want as president.
 
ACOSTA: Yes and Scott, Iowa Republicans today announced the date of their first in the nation caucus next year, January 15th. That sounds extremely close in ways that many Americans are probably not ready for at this point. They don't want it to come back.
 
What is your sense of it? Because I've covered Iowa caucuses many times, and you know, it just seems like going back to 2016, this fractured field is going to help Donald Trump. Now Ted Cruz, I mean, he won in 2016. Donald Trump did not win the Iowa caucus in 2016, but over time, we saw it primary after caucus after primary that fractured field just worked to his advantage.
 
SCOTT JENNINGS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Yes, it has actually not been since George W. Bush that candidate has won the Iowa caucus in a contested situation and gone on to be the Republican nominee, I guess back to Obama for the Democrats.
 
So Iowa hasn't, at least, recently picked the nominee. However, in this particular case, because of the dominant position Trump is in, if he -- and you would think of the -- of what's going on out there, which state would he be most vulnerable in? It would probably be Iowa, I would think.
 
And so if you can't stop him in Iowa, what would happen at that point? I mean, there are a lot of people in the Republican Party and a lot of political observers who think if he wins Iowa, it is over, that it won't be easy to stop him in New Hampshire or even South Carolina.
 
So yes, the fragmentation. We've been talking about this, it feels like since he got into the race, but if this field doesn't get smaller, and DeSantis can't get some of these folks out and consolidate their support, it's going to be difficult to stop him.
 
I do think if DeSantis were to come very close to him, narrowly beat him or, or come in just underneath him, that would keep the race going.
 
But If Trump were to somehow pull off a dominant win in Iowa, there would be a head of steam there for him. And obviously, he has got money, he has got organization. And look, at this point, he is the establishment. It's hard to beat the establishment.
 
It happens sometimes, but he is the establishment and all the trappings that come with it, sometimes, it has hard to beat.
 
ACOSTA: Yes, I mean, he is the party right now. You can't really argue with that.
 
Maria, Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had this to say about whether she's going to back the president next year. Let's listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The president's only primary opponents are Marianne Williamson and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Haven't been any rumors about anyone else even thinking about jumping in. Will you be supporting Joe Biden for re-election?
 
REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): I believe given that field, yes.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ACOSTA: Yes, the little wind up there was longer than the answer, but Maria, I mean, AOC getting behind Biden at this point.
 
CARDONA: Yes.
 
ACOSTA: It is a big deal.
 
CARDONA: It's big. Absolutely, it is big, because I think what it allows Democrats to do is to show unity at a time when I think it's very important to show unity, especially when you have some others on the fringe trying to make a case against Joe Biden. And I think what it also shows is that the Democratic Party in terms of what the Biden administration and his messaging is going into the general election is behind him.
 <br>[18:25:07]
 
The vast majority of Democrats understand again, the historic accomplishments. And frankly, I think the American people will also see the more that Democrats unite behind him, the more that they are going to be focused on, well, this is somebody that we should continue to support. And as Joe Biden says, to be able to finish the job.
 
ACOSTA: Yes, and Scott, I have to ask you about this. Marjorie Taylor Greene was booted from the House Freedom Caucus, apparently by her fellow conservative hardliners.
 
I mean, there's -- a lot doesn't surprise us in Washington, DC. This kind of surprised me. And this was after her fighting with Lauren Boebert, aligning herself with Speaker McCarthy. What was your reaction to that, Scott, when you saw that?
 
JENNINGS: Yes, I was surprised. I mean, it would be hard for me to imagine that this fighting with Boebert is what did it.
 
I mean, truly, though, where Marjorie Taylor Greene has been deriving her power and attention lately has not been from saying crazy things, but from aligning herself with Kevin McCarthy.
 
Now, she helped him become speaker. She is aligned with him on all the policy issues, including the debt deal that he wanted to do and got done.
 
And so my -- I imagine that it has more to do with that than just having a spat on the floor with another member, which I assume happens, you know, more than we know.
 
And so I was a little surprised by it, but I wonder if it has more to do with her helping out the leadership. I mean, the House Freedom Caucus, you know, doesn't exist to make the lives of people in House leadership easy; it exists to make their lives miserable.
 
And if you're helping them instead of making their life miserable, you're not really fulfilling your mission, I guess.
 
ACOSTA: Yes. I mean, I thought she was kind of the House Freedom Caucus. But you know, and Maria, with all the squabbling going on inside the GOP conference, and we've seen this almost since Kevin McCarthy became the speaker of the House, shouldn't Democrats be able to take advantage of that and take back the House next year?
 
CARDONA: Well, that is certainly going to be something that they're going to try to do. And the message there, Jim, is, look what happened when Republicans were in power. They didn't focus on what the American people wanted. They didn't focus on what they themselves promised they would do if given the power to lead Congress.
 
It also gives us a huge ability to contrast the extremism of the Republican Party, especially the ones that are in power that, frankly, extend to Donald Trump. So I think this also helps with the general election message in contrast to Democrats who when they were in power, again, going back to the massive accomplishments and the historic economic growth and everything else, but I think it also focuses on the extremism when it comes to cultural issues, right?
 
A woman's right to choose, threats to democracy -- all of that will be ripe for Democrats to be able to talk about.
 
ACOSTA: Yes. Well, and taking back the House for the Democrats might go through Lauren Boebert's district. They got very close last time around.
 
CARDONA: That's right. Exactly.
 
ACOSTA: Maria and Scott, great conversation. Thanks very much.
 
CARDONA: Thank you.
 
ACOSTA: Appreciate it.
 
JENNINGS: Thanks, Jim.
 
ACOSTA: We also want to talk about this, meanwhile, police say a man on a scooter opened fire at several locations in New York City. Four people were shot, one of them has died. A live report coming up in just a few moments here in the CNN NEWSROOM. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:32:27]
 
ACOSTA: We're following Developing news out of New York City where police say a man on a scooter shot four people killing one of them in a series of attacks this morning. Police believe the shootings which happened over the course of 20 minutes, targeted people at random.
 
Our Polo SANDOVAL is following developments for us.
 
Polo, very scary situation in Queens, what more do we know?
 
POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: What's particularly disturbing here, Jim, is the indiscriminate nature of this shooting here. When you look at the shooting locations from this afternoon's series of incidents, you can see how they're essentially clustered together here, a very short driving distance from each other. Some of them taking place in the Queens' neighborhood of Richmond Hill, while another that you see there in the Cypress Hills, Brooklyn neighborhood.
 
The suspect aboard a scooter armed with a nine millimeter pistol and if you look at the photographs that have been released by the NYPD, there's a scooter and then you look at the close up of the weapon itself, you can see an extended magazine that investigators say was actually used.
 
In all those five scenes a total of four people shot, one of them sadly did not survive. Police say that he was an 87-year-old man who was shot in the back. One of the individuals who did survive, a 44- year-old man who was shot in the face sped to the hospital and currently in critical condition.
 
The arrest actually happened less than two hours after the spree began with police officers quickly getting images of the suspect and they detained him without incident. Currently, he's only identified as a 25-year-old Hispanic male that had been previously arrested on at least one occasion by the NYPD.
 
I want you to hear from one top NYPD official as he updates - as he updated us just a few moments ago, when it comes to a possible motive.
 
Right, so we're going to work to get to that in the next hour. But essentially, what we hear is that this method of operation that he was simply - that the suspect was just randomly targeting individuals, and the victims here have really nothing in common. So that's what leads him to believe that this is a random act of violence.
 
Now in terms of the weapon itself, that they're going to have to trace it. At this point, they haven't been able to find a serial number on the weapon that leads him to believe that it might potentially be a ghost gun, which is those privately assembled weapons that are nearly impossible to trace or it simply was just scratched off.
 
So they're certainly going to lean on their federal partners to try to find out more about that.
 <br>[18:35:00]
 
But look, the greater framing with a lot of this, Jim, remember, it was just this past Monday that a masked, armed and armored individual randomly opened fire on a neighborhood in southwest Philadelphia shooting and killing five people. So sadly, this is not the first random act of violence of its kind that we see this week.
 
ACOSTA: Yes. And so Polo, I mean, just to bring our viewers up to date, this 87-year-old man who died, this was not any kind of act of violence, where the intentional target was this 87-year-old man. It sounds as though from what you're hearing from authorities is that this man, this suspect on the scooter was just driving around, just firing off his weapon for fun and hitting people is that essentially it? It's terrible.
 
SANDOVAL: On one occasion, he had just opened fire on a nail salon there in the - in a Queens neighborhood, so that tells you a lot. In terms of what you just mentioned, Jim, what we also heard from investigators today is that when they look at the surveillance video shot nearby, they don't see any indication that this 25-year-old man was specifically targeting or stalking any of the people who were shot. And that's what leads him to believe that this is a random act of violence.
 
Now in terms of what have inspired him to do that, we'll have to see in the days ahead.
 
ACOSTA: Yes, just terrible.
 
All right. Polo Sandoval, thank you very much. Appreciate it.
 
In the meantime, one of the Greats of women's soccer announced today that she is retiring. Megan Rapinoe is a trailblazer both on and off the field. A look at her career and impact, that's coming up next with another women's soccer great, there she is right there, Brandi Chastain. We'll get her perspective on all of this in just a few moments, stay with us.
 
You're live in the CNN Newsroom.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:40:40]
 
ACOSTA: In a surprise announcement today, U.S. Women's National Team star Megan Rapinoe says she will retire from professional soccer at the end of the 2023 season.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MEGAN RAPINOE, 2-TIMEWORLD CUP WINNER: I feel like as excited to play the rest of my career as I do to retire and to step away from this beautiful games. I know that I'm really lucky to be in this position that I get to have agency over the end of this really beautiful part of my life. And so in a way I feel like to live little bit of borrowed time and something I feel really grateful for and really excited about.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ACOSTA: Rapinoe has received the highest honors for her achievements in soccer and off the field for championing many social issues, even becoming the first soccer player to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
 
I want to bring in Brandi Chastain, another soccer legend to talk about this. And she is a World Cup and Olympic champion, by the way, co-founded a National Women's Soccer League's new expansion team, Bay FC.
 
Brandi, great to see you. Good to catch up. It's been a while since we last spoke. But what do you think of Megan Rapinoe retiring? I guess it had to happen sooner or later, but what a remarkable career she's had. BRANDI CHASTAIN, WORLD CUP &amp; OLYMPIC CHAMPION: Absolutely, and to be honest with you, I wasn't expecting the news today. But I knew that it was in the near future, Megan has contributed 199 times to the U.S. Women's National Team. I'm very excited that her 200 cap will be here in San Jose in Northern California where she grew up.
 
She has been an inspiration to so many young people and impacted not only social change, but I believe our league and our U.S. women's national team, but also the global game of soccer in a positive way. So kudos to her and I'm super glad that - like she said she has the power to make the decision about when her retirement is and now is the time.
 
ACOSTA: And what do you think is going to define her legacy? I mean, obviously, what she's done on the field, but what she's done off the field as well has really made a huge contribution to American society.
 
CHASTAIN: Well, yes, absolutely. I feel like the array of impact she's had on the field is obvious, whether that be in winning championships, gold medals and World Cups, that that has a certain amount of time, but what's the runway for the future of what she can do and the impact she wants to have is really - as long as she wants it to be.
 
She is always been outspoken, she has always been herself in an authentic a genuine way and I believe she will continue to do that. And I am sure she's looking forward to some downtime, which ...
 
ACOSTA: Yes.
 
CHASTAIN: ... playing professional sports and playing on the national team at the same time. You don't get very much of that.
 
ACOSTA: And what does it meant to women's sports to have players like Megan, like yourself, put a spotlight on issues that matter to women's - women sports or women athletes like equal pay? I mean, that has been an issue that I know folks and women's soccer have been working on tirelessly.
 
CHASTAIN: Right. Yes, thank you for bringing that up. And I believe that's probably one of the greatest legacies for Megan and I think for the national team. It's not been an issue for the time that she's been on the national team has been four to five decades in the making to - for pay equity. And we still have a long way to go as far as women in ownership and C-suites and making important decision, making - having important decision making opportunities.
 
But I think her impact on the NWSL, which we are entering here in the Bay Area come 2024 and we're very excited about our expansion team. We've invested more than any other ownership group in the league and I feel that her contribution has made that possible.
 <br>[18:45:01]
 
Women's soccer and the talent that is involved is the deepest riches well of resources we have and there's greatness that is going to come out of our league because of people like Megan Rapinoe. ACOSTA: And tomorrow, Team USA plays Wales for the first time. How do you expect Rapinoe and the team are preparing for this historic match? And I guess what is it about - I mean, every time this gets going, the whole country is just - I mean, I remember it, how many times have we all done this gather around the TV?
 
You know, you were on the field when we were all watching and cheering it on, what is it about, I guess, seeing the women's team go out there and dominate the way they do that just captures the nation's attention. It just seems to happen every time.
 
CHASTAIN: Well, we all have to remember that soccer and football is the world's game. And so it's not just going to be our country, it will be the world watching and ...
 
ACOSTA: Yes.
 
CHASTAIN: ... this is the greatest, largest field of teams that have ever been a part of the Women's World Cup. It's 32 teams on a new continent in Australia, New Zealand. And so there's so many - they've already sold over a million and 300,000 tickets for this event and it's going to be the biggest one ever.
 
And so what we're going to expect tomorrow is a great match because this is the last match before the women go off - they leave tonight or tomorrow night, excuse me after the game to head to New Zealand. And so this is a game that is of great significance in terms of preparation, maybe not in score, but we do like to win games. That's what the U.S. women's national team does. And we are hopeful as fans and as former players, that they will go on to victory as well come the championship game on August 20th.
 
ACOSTA: All right. Well, we can't wait to watch and, of course, we'll be cheering on Megan Rapinoe even though she is retiring. We're going to be cheering all of them on. Brandi Chastain, another legend in the sport. Thanks so much for taking time with us this afternoon. We really appreciate it. Good to talk to you.
 
CHASTAIN: As always, Jim, thank you so much.
 
ACOSTA: All right. And we'll be right back.

ACOSTA: Over the past few days, there were five separate shark attacks across New York City beaches. This comes as even more shark sightings are reported including this one a possible close call in Florida with a hammerhead shark. So are we really seeing a spike in these sorts of encounters? And if so could rising temperatures be part of the reason why?
 
Just this week, the planet saw the hottest day ever recorded four days in a row. And joining us now to talk about this is wildlife and conservation expert and TV host Jeff Corwin. Jeff, great to see you. I understand you just happened to be exploring some shark infested waters in Cape Cod earlier today. We have some pictures of this. What did you see and what do you make of some of these recent shark attacks? What are your thoughts?
 
JEFF CORWIN, WILDLIFE &amp; CONSERVATION EXPERT: Well, greetings, Jim from a very thick fog bank along the coasts of southeastern Massachusetts. And indeed I was this morning in my lobster gear in the balmy 54 degree waters off of the coast where I live, diving for what we call lobsters (ph). And I had a successful day, albeit not one single shark spotted.
 
But as we've discussed, that does not mean I was not close to a shark. Because in a healthy, vibrant ecosystem like this beautiful environment where I live, if you're in the water, you're never more than about 300 feet away from a wild shark.
 
Now, what's interesting is that we are starting to see some negative human shark encounters along the eastern coast of New York and Connecticut. And, of course, in places like Florida.
 
ACOSTA: Well, and when you say negative human shark encounters, I think of something that sounds a lot more nefarious than that. But what do you make of - I mean, I know --
 
CORWIN: I'm trying to be politically correct.
 
ACOSTA: I know you are.
 
CORWIN: Basically, you're in - you're at the - you're in the wrong end of a shark.
 
ACOSTA: Yes. But what do you think? Are we seeing a spike and the shark attacks are close calls? Is it just more media coverage? What is the reality?
 
CORWIN: I think it's a combination of both. I think we are seeing a little bit more coverage of sharks, with social media, all these incredible apps that people have now. On my phone alone, I can't show you because I'm using it, I've got three apps that tell me if you're about to go in the water, you may be sharing that with a 14 foot great white shark and you might want to reconsider your decisions. So we have that aspect.
 
But if you look at the ratio of shark attacks from this year to last year, right now we're up by one, so not that significant statistically. But what's happening right now?
 
Well here along gorgeous New England, we have a bumper crop of seals, harbor seals, grey seals, that's what brought all the great white sharks back with the reintroduction or the migration of seals into this area. Lots of seals means open buffet for sharks.
 
Jim, in the south it's a little different.
 
ACOSTA: There we go.
 
CORWIN: A lot of people are in the same waters as the sharks are. They're there to fish, lots of bait brings in the shark.
 <br>[18:55:00]
 
They're swimming in the waters where sharks are popping with their next generation, where they're feeding. All of that increases the opportunity of a negative encounter. Look at the weather, we've had a lot of rain, lots of rain, turbid environment, it's very murky, again, mistaken identity by again being politically correct.
 
ACOSTA: I know you are, you're being sensitive. But I want to ask you about something that is disturbing. And that is this past week beginning Monday the earth recorded the hottest day in modern history. Four days in a row and having four days in a row, your thoughts on that. That is not good and it sounds like to me, and I'm no expert on this. I know you more of an expert than I am, mean a sign of things to come and not good signs.
 
CORWIN: Well, we've known our Earth has been warming for a very, very long time. I remember way back in the day doing Planet in Peril with CNN.
 
ACOSTA: Right.
 
CORWIN: And that was the story no one was talking about going to this giant (inaudible) and glacier in Greenland that released, back then - way back then was releasing enough water in a day from climate change to supply New York City with water for a year.
 
So we are seeing a changing environment because our environment is warming. And jokingly, my wife - we say, who knows, maybe we'll be the next Mediterranean. But in a very serious note, what is the impact. We know there's an environmental impact. We have North Atlantic right whales that are migrating up from Florida, they get here. The Gulf of Maine is the fastest warming body of water on the planet.
 
So they arrive and their food source is gone. We're seeing nesting animals, for example, because of climate change, Jim, turtles nesting along Florida's coast are hatching out 99 percent female, because warmer temperature means more females than males.
 
ACOSTA: Yes.
 
CORWIN: So all these problems economically, the olive oil crop has collapsed in Spain, because of climate change. So it affects us at every level and - including the biological level.
 
ACOSTA: So many examples. And Jeff, I remember Planet in Peril very well and all of your great work on that. We'll come back and talk about it, again, because it's such an important topic. But Jeff, great to see you. Thanks so much, really appreciate it.
 
CORWIN: My pleasure. Thanks, Jim.
 
ACOSTA: All right. And we'll be right back.
