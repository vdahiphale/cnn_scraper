ERICA HILL, CNN ANCHOR: Lawmakers have unveiled a massive government spending bill -- funding bill that must pass in order to avoid a government shutdown on Friday. 
 
JIM SCIUTTO, CNN ANCHOR: And, by the way, something that's going to last for a few months. Imagine that. Right now it is expected to go through. Time, though, still of the essence. No one wants to threaten congressional vacations. 
 
CNN's Manu Raju joins us now from Capitol Hill. 
 
This is a big one, $1.7 trillion I believe is the figure. So, what made it in?
 
MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, this was a massive bill. More than 4,000 pages. $1.7 trillion. It was unveiled at 1:23 in the morning in the Senate. And they want to jam this through Congress in just a matter of a couple of days with very little time for most members of Congress to review it, very little time for the public to grasp it. 
 
We are just starting to get some of the details on this proposal, which, by the way, is almost three months late. The original deadline was September 30th. They have kicked the can now until this Friday to avoid a government shutdown. Now the pressure is on to get the votes and get an agreement for votes in the Senate, and then votes in the House. 
 
Now, this bill totals $1.7 trillion in funding across the federal government and has a whole host of measures, including more than $44 billion in aid to Ukraine. The measure also includes some key provisions. It has an overhaul of the Electoral Count Act of 1887. That is something that is designed to prevent another January 6th, try to prevent an effort by a president to pressure another future vice president to simply overturn the election results. That simply cannot be done as Donald Trump had to do with Mike Pence under this legislation. 
 
Now, in addition to that includes what's called the Secure Act 2.0. It's a retirement package. Try to make it easier for Americans to save for retirement. And also would ban TikTok from federal devices. That is something that is also included in this bill. 
 
But there are some key provisions not included in this bill. That includes something that was known as the Safe Banking Act. That is something that was pushed by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to - he wanted to allowed cannabis companies to use their cash reserves, use the banking system. That is not in this proposal. Also an expansion of the child tax credit. An extension of that expansion. This -- that was also not included despite Democratic demands. 
 
There are a whole host of corporate and individual tax breaks that were not included in this bill. And there's also no decision on the FBI headquarters, whether to move that to Maryland or Virginia. There was a huge fight between those delegations in the final hour as they try to cut this massive deal. 
 
But this bill also includes $5 billion in funding for veterans who suffer from toxic burn pits. That was legislation that was approved earlier this year to include funding for that. In addition, $38 billion in disaster aid. 
 
So, there's a lot in here for a lot of members to like. A lot in here for a lot of members not to like. And a lot of members want more time to review the process. So it still remains to be seen how this plays out and whether they can get this done by Friday. 
 
Guys.
 
SCIUTTO: Yes.
 
HILL: Four thousand pages, eight hours ago. 
 
SCIUTTO: Wow.
 
HILL: Even the best speed reader, that is a challenge. 
 
Manu Raju, appreciate it. Thank you. 
 
RAJU: Thank you.
 
SCIUTTO: All right, to Uvalde, Texas, now. A disturbing revelation. CNN has learned than an inspector, posing as an intruder, managed to get into a school cafeteria through an unlocked door. 
 <br>[09:35:05]
 
This despite new safety protocols touted by the school district and, of course, imposed since the horrible shooting there.
 
HILL: Now, the school superintendent says this was all part of a safety audit. It comes, of course, with the horror of the Robb Elementary School massacre still understandably top of mind there. 
 
CNN's Martin Savidge joining us now. 
 
So, I mean, it leaves you speechless, Martin, to see that this happened. MARTIN SAVIDGE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It does. Yes, I was taken aback
 
 when I heard this information. 
 
So, let me give you a bit of background here. 
 
It was revealed at the school board meeting last night in Uvalde, Texas. They had been undergoing a security audit. This was essentially a test. Never at any time were students or staff in any kind of danger. But this test was conducted, as you point out, just seven months after that horrific massacre that took place inside the elementary school in which 21 people, 19 students, two teachers were murdered. 
 
So the way it works is that an auditor went to three schools. We don't know which schools. We don't know if Robb Elementary was among them. But they went around to all the exterior doors because, remember, that's how the gunman got inside, testing to see if these doors were now locked. Two of the schools passed the test no problem. But a third school, again, we don't know which one, the auditor was able to go to a loading dock by the cafeteria where there was a door that was closed but with a lot of force that auditor yanked the door open. 
 
Here's the superintendent talking about how this happened. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GARY PATTERSON, UVALDE INTERIM SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT: There were no students in the cafeteria and he was stopped by staff in the cafeteria. And so that -- that's what we're supposed to do. But they gained access and that was disappointing. 
 
The delivery of goods into loading docks was just something, quite honestly, that I overlooked, but I won't overlook it next time. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SAVIDGE: You could understand the deadly potential consequences there had this not been just a test but had it been the real thing. One door overlooked in a loading dock could have had horrific consequences. 
 
Also at that meeting, they have revised now and plan for more security doors, more cameras and, of course, a revamped school police department. But, still, stunning to think of, again, seven months out. 
 
SCIUTTO: Yes.
 
HILL: Yes, it certainly is. 
 
Martin Savidge, appreciate it. Thank you. 
 
SAVIDGE: You're welcome. 
 
SCIUTTO: Well, still -- still ahead, new CNN reporting on U.S. plans to support, and even upgrade, Ukraine's weapons supply. A tool that could turn a so-called dumb bomb into a precision guided munition. That's coming up. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:42:02]
 
HILL: The Biden administration is preparing its next round of security aid for Ukraine. Sources tell CNN the package will include weapons aimed at helping Ukraine bust through Russia's defensive lines. 
 
SCIUTTO: CNN Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr joins us now. And, of course, this is her reporting. 
 
So, the U.S. is trying to help, you know, sort of achieve this balance here, help the Ukrainians but not escalate to the point where they end up into direct conflict with Russia. 
 
Can you tell us what's in the new package, how it fits into that plan? 
 
BARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: Well, we've talked a bit about, you know, the patriot air defense missiles. And that's expected to come within days as part of the next package of assistance. But now sources are telling CNN there's something else in that aid package, and that is something called JDAM (ph). 
 
What these are are precision kits. They're kits that bolt on essentially to a so-called dumb bomb. A bomb that would fall off an airplane on to the battlefield and hit wherever it hits. These bolt on kits turn those so-called dumb bombs into precision guided weapons. It will have guidance. They will be able to aim at particular targets, at a particular point in time. And that could give Ukraine's air forces a critical advantage that they haven't really had so far. 
 
When Russian troops are dug in during the winter, they may be able to hit those targets once they get all of this in place. Not so easy, no the so fast, because the kits have to get there and the Ukrainians have to figure out a way, along with the U.S. and other allied partners, how to use these weapons on their Soviet-era fighter jets. So there will have to be some modifications made so they will be able to use these precision weapons provided to them.
 
But all of this very much in progress, we're told, and the announcement about all of it could come within the next couple of days, this week it's largely expected to be announced. 
 
Erica. Jim.
 
SCIUTTO: Well, Barbara, before you go, far more important stuff. This is - and folks watching might not know this, but this is your last day at CNN. I've known you for a heck of a long time, maybe 20 years, and I'm really going to miss you. And I'm sure our viewers are going to miss you, too, because you're damn good at your job and you also happen to be a really good egg. So, thank you for being a colleague and friend. 
 
STARR: That is so gracious of both of you. Thank you. 
 
HILL: You are already missed, Barbara. And to Jim's point, you are so well-respected, not only here at CNN, but in the broader community of journalists. 
 
SCIUTTO: Yes.
 
HILL: I know how well-respected you are at the Pentagon, your sourcing. You are also just a really great human and thank you for all the times that I have asked you for guidance or help on something. You are always one of the first people to respond when somebody asks you for that. And so we already miss you, but wish you nothing but the best. And I hope you're not a stranger. 
 
STARR: Thank you so much.
 
SCIUTTO: Yes, I know for a fact that folks at - folks at the Pentagon look up at the screen when you are reporting something, to see what you have to say. I know for a fact. So, that's a sign of respect. 
 <br>[09:45:01]
 
STARR: Thank you both very much. 
 
SCIUTTO: Barbara Starr. 
 
HILL: Still to come here, winter storms posing a blizzard threat to parts of the Midwest. And there is a whole lot of holiday travel that could be caught in the crosshairs. Already some airlines now issuing travel waivers, encouraging travelers to reschedule their flights. We have the latest forecast for you, next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
SCIUTTO: Winter storms might cause some travel trouble during the holiday week. These storms, including what's known as a bomb cyclone up in the Northeast, they're going to bring rain, possible blizzard condition as well. 
 
HILL: Yes, airlines already issuing travel waivers. 
 <br>[09:50:03]
 
Experts say this is the time right now for you to change your plans. 
 
SCIUTTO: Yes.
 
HILL: CNN meteorologist Jennifer Gray joining us now. 
 
So, we know it's going to happen. So, I guess the question now is, how bad is this going to be? 
 
JENNIFER GRAY, AMS METEOROLOGIST: Well, it depends on where you are. But if you're in the Midwest, the northern plains, I would take advantage of those travel vouchers. It is going to get really bad. 
 
This is where the storm is now. Just in its infancy. But this is going to intensify rapidly as it travel to the east. Already winter weather alerts. Windchill alerts out as well. We could see those windchills dip as low as 50 below zero. And this is where the storm is going to cause the most problems. By
 
 the time we get into tomorrow even, this is Thursday evening, we could have blizzard conditions across portions of the Midwest. As we go through Thursday night into Friday morning, Chicago will be in the blizzard conditions most likely. And then it's finally going to lift to the north and east. This is where it becomes the bomb cyclone. Really intensifying. We could have winds exceeding 50 miles per hour. It's still windy in the Midwest even after the storm ends. And we're also going to see those windy conditions across all of the Northeast. It looks like the I-95 corridor is going to be all rain, but interior sections will get the snow. The interior sections of the Northeast and New England getting the snow. But windy conditions will remain for everyone. 
 
Here's a look at the snowfall totals. We could see about a foot of snow potentially across portions of the Midwest. More widespread amounts, though, will be anywhere from four to six inches. Look at this. Just east of Chicago, picking up least a foot of snow, adding to that the very cold temperatures. If you don't get the snow, I promise you, you will get the cold. We are going to see much of the country blanketed in extremely cold temperatures, below zero temperatures are in the pink. That arctic air moves to the south. Every state in the lower 48 will at least be below freezing, but a large chunk of folks will be below zero. This is a dangerous cold. Guys, in the northern plains, frost bite could set in, in as little as five minutes. 
 
HILL: Wow! Ouf (ph), that is rough.
 
GRAY: It's intense. 
 
SCIUTTO: Yowsers (ph).
 
GRAY: Yes.
 
HILL: Jennifer Gray, appreciate it. Thank you. 
 
GRAY: (INAUDIBLE).
 
SCIUTTO: All right, well two of the nation's biggest pharmacy, Walgreens and CVS, are now limiting how much over-the-counter children's pain medicine people can buy. Shortages. Mean, I don't know if you've seen it, Erica. I've definitely seen it, trying to find basic stuff like, you know, Children's Motrin, you know, that sort of thing. It's really hard to find. 
 
HILL: I'm certainly hearing about it from friends with younger children. The products, as you know, Jim, you've seen it, they're flying off the shelves, if you can even find one. This is being chocked up to these high rates of respiratory infections across the country, in addition to supply challenges. 
 
So, CVS is restricting in person and online purchases to two of these children pain relief products. Walgreens limiting online purchases as well, although that's six over the counter fever reducers per transaction, but there is no in-person purchase limit. SCIUTTO: Well, the shortage in medicines, as well as increased rates
 
 of flu and RSV infections, could make getting together over the next couple of weeks for the holidays kind of tricky. Health officials are also concerned about a rise in Covid-19 infection rates. That's a triple threat.
 
HILL: Yes, so a lot of people wondering, so how do I maybe keep my plans? How do I still see friends and family and make sure that everybody stays safe. 
 
CNN medical correspondent Dr. Tara Narula is here now to help us with those decisions.
 
So, what is the best thing that we can do to reduce the chance of getting sick while traveling?
 
DR. TARA NARULA, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, as someone who got Covid in Christmas, right, of 2020.
 
HILL: Oh.
 
NARULA: And couldn't see any of her family, I can attest to the fact that it really stinks to get sick right before the holiday. So, there are things you can do. You want to think about what events are important to you in the next two or three weeks and count back about five days. Around that time you want to start avoiding large, indoor, crowded spaces if you're unmasked. Certainly try to travel at times, again, when you're avoiding peak hours of being around these small, crowded groups. If you do have to go to a party or a big group event and you want to wear a high-quality mask, N-95 or other. In addition, you want to make sure you're up-to-date, we keep talking about this, on your flu shot, on your Covid updated booster shot. And then certainly whoever you're going to be gathering with, you want to make sure you're all following that same strategy or plan and making sure that if there are vulnerable people in the group, elderly, immune suppressed or chronic health conditions, if you are sick, you want to stay home and stay away. 
 
SCIUTTO: All right, so folks listening now, heck, I'm one of them, it's like, do we have to go through pandemic stuff again? Are you talking about masking? Are you talking about distancing? Are you talking about taking about taking tests before you have big holiday gathering events? What's necessary? What's recommended? 
 
NARULA: I think it's a little bit of a mix. I think certainly if you are a healthy person who's been vaccinated, you're weighing the risks and benefits, it's probably safe to attend. But I think you want to take good measures. So that includes things like making sure you're in a well ventilated space. If you have a hepa filter, use it. Open the windows. If you live somewhere warm, you can celebrate outdoors. Again, handwashing. If you are somebody who is higher risk or more venerable, it may be appropriate to wear a mask in those smaller group settings. 
 <br>[09:55:00] And then certainly those rapid Covid antigen tests are really key. Either taking them, you know, the same day that you're about to go, or even having them at the door of the event and providing them to guests, that's a great way to keep everyone safe. 
 
SCIUTTO: Yes.
 
HILL: You started to touch on this, but it also brings up the question of, OK, at what point do you maybe say we postpone what we have planned, maybe we try to move it to another day? Is that based on numbers of people? Is it based on age or perhaps whether they're immunocompromised? Who should be thinking about that?
 
NARULA: I think it's like, with everything in medicine, you're always weighing the risks and the benefits. And you have to look at your own threshold for what you feel comfortable with, who you are, what your health conditions are and make those decisions. Again, I think if you tend to be someone who's healthy and vaccinated, these gatherings are probably safe. But if your are in one of those categories where you have a chronic health condition or you're more vulnerable, then maybe you either do want to stay in a smaller group, avoid or mask if you're going to attend. 
 
HILL: Yes. Lots of things to consider. 
 
SCIUTTO: Yes.
 
HILL: As we always say, I have to say in my family because, you know, work gets in the way on holidays, it's not about the day all the time, sometimes it's the quality of the time. So, if you have to postpone it, maybe not the worst thing. 
 
NARULA: That's right.
 
HILL: Dr. Narula, thank you. 
 
NARULA: Thank you.
 
SCIUTTO: Wise words, as always, Erica Hill. 
 
Well, still ahead, just a day after the January 6th committee referred criminal charges against former President Trump to the Justice Department, another House committee will debate today whether to release his tax returns to the public. We're going to be live on the Capitol -- at the Capitol, coming up.
