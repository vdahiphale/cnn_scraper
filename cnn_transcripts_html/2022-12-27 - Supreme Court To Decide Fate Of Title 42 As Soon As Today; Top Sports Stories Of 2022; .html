JEAN CASAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It was the Governor of Michigan, also an enhancement that he was the leader in all of this. Now, here are some other aspects to the sentence. Let's look at that. Not only 16 years in federal prison, but it will be concurrent on both counts. So the sentence will be served together after that, however, five years of supervision once he's out.
 
While he's in prison, substance abuse treatment, mental health treatment. And once he is out, he cannot have a firearm at all. He cannot have any type of weapon on his person or in his possession at any time. And then that mental health treatment has to continue, and the probation officer will have to monitor that mental health and substance abuse treatment as he goes forwards in his life.
 
AMARA WALKER, CNN HOST: All right, Jean Casarez, thank you for those details.
 
While cities along the southern border are struggling to keep up with the surge of migrant crossings, in El Paso, Texas, shelters are at or over capacity, and migrants are sleeping on the streets in frigid temperatures. This as the Supreme Court weighs the fate of Title 42. A decision on the Pandemic era immigration policy could come down at any moment.
 
CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is following this story for us. Priscilla, I know we keep talking about Title 42. Some people may not be following this story so closely. First off, tell us what Title 42 did in effect and what a post Title 42 southern border would look like.
 
PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: Well, Title 42, to remind viewers, dates back to March of 2020. The onset of the Coronavirus pandemic is a public health authority that was invoked by the Trump administration and allowed border authorities to turn migrants back to Mexico or quickly return them to their native country, all on the basis of public health. Now, it has been criticized for years. Immigrant advocates and public health experts said that it was essentially a pretext to just keep migrants out, many of whom may be eligible for asylum in the United States.
 
Now, we're at the point where it could go away. And what that means is essentially a return to protocols that existed for decades before this authority came to be in March of 2020. That means that migrants who come to the border are processed and they're either released into the United States while they go through their immigration proceedings, detained or returned to their native country.
 
Now, as the anticipation has built up on whether or not this authority goes away, migrants have been coming to the U.S.-Mexico border. We know that approximately 22,000 migrants are across just three cities in Northern Mexico waiting for what happens next because they would no longer be turned away in the way that has happened since the pandemic began.
 
Now, what is the Administration doing? Well, the Department of Homeland Security says that they are setting up temporary facilities, scaling up air and ground transportation, cracking down on human smugglers and working with NGOs as they have been doing in El Paso, which you see there.
 
Of course, this has been a concern for the administration primarily that when Title 42 lifts, there would be a surge of migrants, and they have been preparing for that ahead of when it could happen. Amara?
 
WALKER: A lot of it seems to be coming down to the resources. Do we have any indication, Priscilla, on when that ruling from the Supreme Court could come down? 
 
ALVAREZ: The Supreme Court could do whatever they want, whenever they want. So we are waiting to hear what they decide. The administration did say in a filing last week that whatever they do, decide and say that it is lifting Title 42, that they give them time to scale up those preparations and make sure everything really is in place. Because they also acknowledge that there could be a jump in crossings. But again, it is just wait and see at the moment.
 
WALKER: All righty, Priscilla Alvarez. Appreciate it. Thank you.

And still ahead, a new wave of concerns surrounding concussions in the NFL, a quarterback who suffered a severe concussion earlier this year not pulls off the field after another apparent incident.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
WALKER: Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa is in concussion protocol for the second time this season, meaning he's being monitored by teen doctors ahead of Sunday's game against the Patriots. Now, Tagovailoa played the entire game Sunday. The Dolphins head coach said he is not sure when the quarterback, excuse me, might have suffered a head injury, but there's been focus on a play where he fell to the ground. Tagovailoa got a concussion back in September in a game against the Bengals after being sacked. He laid on the field for several minutes and was taken off on a stretcher. Earlier this season, the NFL updated its concussion protocols to mandate any player who showed symptoms of a head injury had to sit out the rest of the game.
 
From the Olympics in Beijing to the world cup and Qatar, 2022 was a remarkable year for athletes on and off the field. Here's Andy Scholes with a look at the top 10 sport stories this year.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDY SCHOLES, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR: In 2022, we saw records fall, an epic World Cup and many sports legends say goodbye. But the story garnering the most attention was one star athlete's battle for her freedom.

Number ten, Aaron Judge homering his way to a historic season. The Yankee slugger becoming the American League all-time home run king, hitting 62 long balls, breaking Roger Maris's record.
 
AARON JUDGE, BASEBALL OUTFIELDER: Getting a chance to have my name next to, you know, someone as great as Roger Maris, Babe Ruth, those guys is incredible.
 
SCHOLES: Before the season, Judge, bet on himself, turning down a contract extension. In December, the gamble paid off as he received the richest deal ever, a reported nine year, $360 million to return to New York, and Judge's Yankees were swept by the Houston Astros in the ALCS. The Astros went on to win their second World Series title in six years.
 
Number nine, Steph Curry and the warriors also becoming champions once again. Steph with an all time performance in game four of the finals against the Celtics, scoring 43 points in Boston. The warriors would take the series four games to two, with Steph winning his first ever NBA Finals MVP.
 
STEPHEN CURRY, AMERICAN PROFESSIONAL BASKETBALL PLAYER: Every so once in a while, you got to remind yourself.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You got to remind yourself.
 
CURRY: We got four.
 
SCHOLES: In the WNBA, the Las Vegas Aces claimed their first championship in franchise history, beating the Connecticut Sun in four games, crowning coach Becky Hammond as the first rookie coach to win the WNBA title.
 
Number eight, the NFL playoffs in 2022 was one of the best we've ever seen. Patrick Mahomes, with just 13 seconds on the clock, got the Chiefs in position to tie the Bills, who they would eventually beat in an overtime thriller, 42 to 36. The Chiefs, though upset by the Bengals, who made it to the Super Bowl for the first time since 1989. And Super Bowl 56 was another home game for the NFC champions. 
 
The Rams, playing at SoFi Stadium, made a comeback, led by Matthew Stafford and Cooper Kupp to beat Cincinnati 23 to 20, giving the city of Los Angeles their first Super Bowl title since 1984. The city of L.A. would get to celebrate another title in November, as LAFC won the MLS Cup in dramatic fashion in just their fifth season.

SCHOLES: Number seven, despite COVID concerns and lockdowns in China, the Beijing Olympics were held in February, figure skating under the spotlight once again after it was discovered that 15-year-old Russian skating phenom, Kamila Valieva, tested positive for a banned substance before the game. Valieva helped the Russians win gold in the team event, but no medal ceremony was held. Nathan Chen, meanwhile, shining for Team USA, winning the men's gold.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Tonight, Novak Djokovic, the world's top ranked men's tennis player, has been ordered to leave Australia.
 
SCOTT MORRISON, PRIME MINITER OF AUSTRALIA: If you're not double vaccinated and you're not an Australian resident or citizen, well, you can't come.
 
SCHOLES: Djokovic, who said he'd rather miss tournaments than get vaccinated against COVID, only competed in two Grand Slams in 2022, winning Wimbledon for his 21st Grand Slam title.

SCHOLES: Number four, less than 15 months after his severe car crash that required multiple surgeries on his right leg, Tiger Woods was back at the Masters with a huge gallery following him. Tiger coming through with what he called the most impressive performance of his career making the cut, he finished 47th, which would be his best finish at a major in 2022. Tiger only competed in three events this year, but he did fight for the PGA Tour off the course. The new Saudi backed live golf poaching notable PGA Tour players Dustin Johnson, Brooks Koepka and Bryson DeChambeau with the lure of massive multimillion dollar contracts in their first year.
 
TIGER WOODS, AMERICAN PROFESSIONAL GOLFER: To play there, I disagree with it. They've turned their back on what has allowed them to get to this position.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My dad said to me a long time ago, once you make your bed, you lie in it. And they've made their bed.
 
SCHOLES: Number three, 2022 was a banner year for sports stars retiring and unretiring.
 
WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: Tom Brady, as seen by so many as the greatest NFL quarterback of all time, is retiring after 22 seasons.
 
SCHOLES: Well, less than two months later, Brady changed his mind.

JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: She's safe. She's on her way home. After months of being unjustly detained in Russia, held under intolerable circumstances, Brittney will soon be back in the arms of her loved ones. And she should have been there all along.

WALKER: All right, up next, news that is sure to be music to your ears. The gas price Madness of 2022 is not likely to see a repeat performance next year.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:52:10]
 
WALKER: GasBuddy has just shared its gas price prediction for 2023 exclusively with CNN, and it's a mix of good and bad news. CNN reporter Matt Egan is crunching the numbers. Hey, Matt, we only want good news, not good news first. But go ahead, tell us the good part.
 
MATT EGAN, CNN REPORTER: Well, Amara, there is definitely some good news here. GasBuddy is projecting that prices at the pump will average 3.49 a gallon next year. That is down from 3.99 this year. To put this in real terms, that would translate to family spending almost $300 less for the whole year on fuel than they did in 2022.
 
Now the bad news, though, is that gas prices could go back towards that dreaded $4 a gallon threshold as people start driving more in the spring and summer and as refineries switch over to more expensive summer gasoline. GasBuddy is projecting that gas prices could go from around 3.10 a gallon right now to as high as 4.05 a gallon in May and 4.25 in August. That is, of course, uncomfortably high. Now, listen to what GasBuddy's Patrick De Haan told me about what people should expect about gas prices next year.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
PATRICK DE HAAN, GASBUDDY: 2023 is not going to be a cakewalk for motorists. It could be expensive and it could be made either better or worse, depending on the luck of the draw, that is refineries have been a tremendous story of importance this year, and if anything should disrupt refineries, we could again be seeing prices that are unseasonably high.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
EGAN: Now, beyond refineries, there's a lot of other swing factors here that we have to pay attention to. Everything from the war in Ukraine to potential hurricanes could drive prices higher. On the other hand, if the economy stumbles and there's a recession in 2023, that would translate to lower prices. Amara, at the end of the day, hopefully after a year of painfully high gas prices, next year brings some real relief.
 
WALKER: There are just so many unpredictable factors that are just out of our control. So, I mean, looking to your crystal ball, is there a risk of another $5 a gallon spike like we saw earlier this year?
 
EGAN: Well, Gas Buddy says that is improbable, but it's not impossible. Right now, that is not what they're forecasting. That spike to $5 a gallon was painfully high. And Amara, hopefully we don't see anything like that in 2023.
 
WALKER: Yes, I'm liking the threes right now. Matt Egan, appreciate it. Thanks.
