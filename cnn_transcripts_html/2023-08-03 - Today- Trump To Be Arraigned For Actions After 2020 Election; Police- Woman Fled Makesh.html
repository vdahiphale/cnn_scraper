(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR: In just hours, Donald Trump will head to Washington, DC for his third arraignment and arrest in four months. His charges were fueled by lies that he crafted and orchestrated. That's according to Special Counsel Jack Smith in that indictment.
 
New polling from CNN, though shows that the majority of Republicans still believe those lies. Look at these numbers. Nearly 70 percent of Republicans in this new poll say -- in these new numbers that President Biden's 2020 election win was not legitimate.
 
Joining us now, a Democratic congressman from California, Ro Khanna. He also serves on Joe Biden's campaign advisory board. Congressman, thank you for joining me.
 
I want to ask you about those -- the polling in just a second. But on today, which is going to be a moment to watch in this historic day of Donald Trump's arraignment in Washington, DC, what do you think today means for Donald Trump in your view?
 
REP. RO KHANNA (D-CA): Well, I'm proud that it affirms the rule of law and it affirms a lot of the work that the House January 6th Committee did. The reality is that there was an elaborate plot that the Trump administration had to-- try to overturn a legitimate election.
 
And we in this country need to hold elections sacred. We can't have politicians after the fact trying to nullify what the voters say. And so, I'm glad that the rule of law will be upheld.
 
BOLDUAN: Donald Trump's defense team is preparing a defense that. Saying his actions, his words around January six is protected political speech protected by the First Amendment. Do -- you don't agree with that, I know. But do you -- are you concerned this -- that is going to be a tough case for prosecutors to prove beyond a reasonable doubt?
 
KHANNA: Well, this is not about his free speech. I mean, if he wants to go out and give a speech and cast aspersions on the validity of an election, that's unfortunate, it's leading to that polling you cited. But that's not what is criminal of -- what the allegation is, is that he was interfering with the Justice Department, interfering with White House personnel to plot the overthrowing of legitimately elected electors, and trying to subvert that process using government resources. This is not Donald Trump just making speeches. And that is the distinction.
 
BOLDUAN: I want to ask you about that poll number and some others. Nearly 7 in 10 Republicans still -- in this poll -- recent new CNN poll still say they believe that Joe Biden did not legitimately win the 2020 election. That number is ticking back up. That number is higher than earlier this year, higher through last fall -- than we saw through last fall. Why is that?
 
KHANNA: Well, it's unfortunate but not surprising because as we head to another presidential election, this country is deeply polarized and people are getting into their partisan camps. And it's no secret that Donald Trump is leading decisively in the polls and is likely to be the Republican nominee. And he's out there and continuing to say the election was stolen.
 
And that's why 2024 is really going to be a decisive election in this country. In my view, it's going to be a rematch between President Biden and President Trump. And the American people really are going to get to weigh in on whether we count our votes, whether it's OK if you lose an election to try to subvert the process. That's what's at stake.
 
BOLDUAN: Another part of this poll that is important to talk about is Joe Biden's approval rating. Overall, his approval rating is sitting at 41 percent. That is not great. His approval on handling the economy is even lower than his overall approval rating. Handling of the economy is sitting at 37 percent, Congressman.
 <br>[11:35:02]
 
I mean, this is where the number sits when you've got a series of good reports coming in about the economy. If that's where it sits when you're getting good news on the economy, how do you make a case that Joe -- that Joe Biden is doing OK?
 
KHANNA: Well, we have to talk about what the president has achieved and what he will achieve. He inherited a tough situation. He came in towards the end of COVID.
 
And that was an economy that was hurting because of unemployment. We had to have spending to bring the unemployment rate down, and that hurt with inflation. So, he inherited a tough situation.
 
But what did he do? We've got construction going on around this country because of the infrastructure bill. We're bringing home manufacturing with semiconductors. We are bringing the fundamental technology to have the industries of the future with batteries and electric vehicles.
 
Some of that is going to take time, but we're beginning to see the results. And I think as those results become more evident to the American people, and as we talked about how consequential this president has been, his numbers will improve.
 
BOLDUAN: That's the case you make, but as we're sitting in August of 23, and that's the case that has been being made for months now on talking about Biden economics. If it's -- are you OK if that approval rating of -- on the economy is still sitting at 37 percent heading into '24?
 
KHANNA: Well, I don't think it will become next November. But look, people were making this argument that the president's numbers were too low before the midterm. And everyone then was surprised that the Democrats did better.
 
People were making arguments against this president back in 2020, including me when I was co-chairing the Bernie Sanders campaign. But Joe Biden won. So, I think he's underestimated. And I believe when people going to the voting booth, they're going to know he's a decent human being, he's a patriot, he's trying his best, and he'll be reelected.
 
BOLDUAN: Real quick. CNN cameras exclusively caught up with President Biden on a bike ride this morning and asked him if he was going to be monitoring this arraignment today. And he, in passing -- as he was passing by, he said, no. But I'm curious how much you think you'd like to hear Joe Biden when he's hitting the campaign trail talking about this -- talking about this indictment against Donald Trump when he is campaigning, and also still a president of course?
 
KHANNA: I don't think he should be. I think he should be focused on how he's going to continue to lower the price of eggs and milk. That's what I heard back in my district, how he's going to lower the cost of childcare, how he's going to continue to bring manufacturing back, and how he's going to try to heal this country.
 
You know, one thing I think the president probably regrets is that he really wants to unify this country. He wants to bring people together. That's what his inaugural was about. That's who he is as a person.
 
And I think he knows that if he starts commenting on these things, that aspiration becomes harder. It's the hardest thing to do in American politics. I hope he'll continue to try to do it. I think that's what motivates him to run and to seek a second term.
 
BOLDUAN: Congressman Ro Khanna, thanks for coming on. John.
 
KHANNA: Thank you.
 
JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: So, the FBI says a woman escaped from a makeshift dungeon. Why do they say there may be more victims out there? And Lizzo is now responding after being sued by three former dancers alleging harassment and a hostile work environment.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:42:51]
 
BERMAN: This morning, police are looking for possible additional victims after a harrowing escape in Oregon. A woman broke out of a makeshift cinderblock dungeon inside a garage. She told the FBI she had been sexually assaulted.
 
Now, a 29-year-old man is in federal custody on suspicion of interstate kidnapping. And investigators fear there may be more victims in other states. CNN's Natasha Chen has the details of this really just awful case. Natasha.
 
NATASHA CHEN, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: John, it's extremely disturbing. Police say that this man picked up his victim in Seattle, pretended to be a police officer. After an alleged sexual encounter, showed her a badge, handcuffed her, put leg irons on her, put her in the car.
 
She asked why it was taking so long to get to a police station and he said I'm taking you to a substation. But investigators say he was really driving her across state lines to Southern Oregon. And she realized she was being kidnapped when she saw his phone's GPS say that they still had hours left to go until the destination, which was his home, investigators say.
 
He put her in a cinderblock cell that he made in his own garage, I think we have photos of. And she, the next morning, was able to pound on the door and break out of that cinder block, calling for help, getting to the hospital, contacting police. Police are really crediting her bravery and will to survive for potentially flagging other victims across the country. Here's what they said.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
STEPHANIE SHARK, ASSISTANT SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE, FBI PORTLAND: And while the alleged perpetrator is already in federal custody, the disturbing evidence uncovered today points to an individual's ongoing and escalating pattern of violence targeting women in multiple states throughout the country. We believe there may be more victims. Victims may know Zuberi by the name of Sakima. And it is believed he may have used several different methods to gain control of his victims too including drugging their drinks and impersonating a law enforcement officer.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHEN: And police also found this handwritten note in that home with the title, operation takeover, saying to leave his phone at home and to find victims with not a lot of people in their lives because he didn't want any type of investigation.
 <br>[11:45:16]
 
Well, now, that investigation spans multiple states. If you take a look at this map. Police say he lived in about 10 states in the last decade, and they believe there could be more victims out there. Asking people to come forward with information. I did speak with a person with knowledge of this investigation saying that he was new to the FBI -- not known to the FBI before this incident, and now he has been indicted by a grand jury for kidnapping, John. BERMAN: Such a troubling case. Natasha, thank you so much. Keep us posted on this. Kate?
 
CHEN: Thanks.
 
BOLDUAN: Yes, no kidding. On our radar this hour. An American mother of three charged with plotting to kill her husband in the Bahamas has been granted bail. 36-year-old Lindsey Shiver is accused of conspiring with two Bahamian nationals to kill her estranged husband months after they filed for divorce. She is now required to wear an ankle monitor device and remain in the Bahamas until her court appearance in October.
 
Public school students in Louisiana may notice a new display inside classrooms as they are going to get heady -- ready to head back to school. Under a new law, all Louisiana public schools are now required to display the national motto, In God We Trust, in classes. Critics of the move have long argued that displays like this blur the lines of separation between church and state. The bill's author though says it is a positive message for kids.
 
Singer Lizzo is responding to allegations from three former dancers. Now, they accuse her of creating a hostile work environment and of harassment. On posting on social media, Lizzo now says that she's hurt by the allegations. Says, the allegations are sensationalized stories created by unprofessional former employees. Those former employees that have filed a lawsuit, they spoke to CNN this morning.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ARIANNA DAVIS, FORMER LIZZO DANCER: It took me actually until leaving the camp that I figured out that everything that went on was bad because I just chalked it up. So you know all those little might be a diva or you know, this is just the industry. This is what we go through.
 
Me, personally, looking at the response from Lizzo was so disheartening because she was there. She was there. And to fix your hand to write on a piece of paper that you don't believe -- that you discredit everything we're saying is incredibly frustrating.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOLDUAN: The dancers say that they were weighed shamed and subjected to racial and religious discrimination and say that there is nothing sensationalized about their claims. John?
 
BERMAN: All right, very shortly, Donald Trump will leave New Jersey to face arrest in Washington, DC. We are on the scene. And the dramatic announcement of a high-profile marriage split with international implications.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:52:28] BOLDUAN: Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says that he and his wife Sophie are separating. Posted the news on Instagram saying that the parent made the decision after many meaningful and difficult conversations. They married in 2005.
 
BERMAN: Our friend Erica Hill is with us now. And, Erica, they say they're still going to you know move forward as a family though.
 
ERICA HILL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, absolutely. So they both posted -- as you said, they both posted on Instagram in English and French on both of their Instagram accounts yesterday talking about these meaningful, difficult conversations that they had between themselves. And then the office of the Prime Minister actually releasing an official statement.
 
And we have part of it there, noting that they remain a close family, they're focused on raising their kids in a safe loving, and collaborative environment. And that both parents will be a constant presence in their children's lives. And you should expect to see the family together.
 
In fact, the Prime Minister's Office and that official statement that we were given, also noted that they're going on vacation together next week. So, which is interesting to see, right, as different families navigate what each family does individually, which is their private decision. How do they do that? They have three kids, 15, 14, and nine in their focus, as we often hear is on them, and request for privacy. Also out of respect for the kids.
 
BOLDUAN: You know, those ages, you know they're in the thick of it. So, you know that at -- that into if -- even if you're not the leader of a country -- 
 
HILL: Yes.
 
BOLDUAN: And under such a microscope, you know -- you know, a lot goes into that decision and those conversations for sure.
 
HILL: Yes. It absolutely does. And what's interesting, too, I think they will be even more focused now. So, Sophie Gregoire Trudeau has announced -- she announced in May she has a book coming out next spring.
 
She's a really active advocate for mental health and mental health awareness. Her book is called "Closer Together: Knowing Ourselves, Loving Each Other." And in that release in May, she said she'd be sharing some of my own deeply personal stories learned on her mental health and well-being journey. You can imagine there will be more scrutiny on that now.
 
BERMAN: You know, obviously, this is a very private thing by definition, but it's happening to the most public family in Canada. And that makes it even harder, right?
 
HILL: Yes. BERMAN: You know, I was reading and I don't know how true this is or not but that the duties of the spouse of the prime minister in Canada are not quite the same -- 
 
HILL: Not the same as the first lady here.
 
BERMAN: Yes, as the first spouse in the U.S. They're not quite as public or have official duties as much.
 
HILL: But even if it's not an official duty, right, you look at the white -- the role of a political spouse. And they can often be very helpful, whether it's on the campaign trail, whether it's at events, whether it's dealing with. You know, the president was just there, of course in March. They were at the coronation in May, in terms of being a part of all of these big moments.
 
BOLDUAN: Yes.
 
HILL: Interesting to note too. Justin Trudeau's father, also a former prime minister, Pierre Trudeau, also separated from his wife while he was in office. Just sort of an odd turn of events.
 <br>[11:55:09]
 
BERMAN: I didn't know that. Yes.
 
BOLDUAN: Odd factoid.
 
HILL: Yes.
 
BOLDUAN: All right.
 
BERMAN: Erica Hill, great to see you. Thank you so much.
 
HILL: Nice to see you, my friends. Thank you.
 
BOLDUAN: Thank you.
 
BERMAN: All right, very shortly, Donald Trump is expected to depart from New Jersey. He is heading to Washington where he will be under arrest as he faces federal charges over his actions leading up to and on January six.
 
BOLDUAN: When he gets to court -- when he gets to DC, he gets to the courthouse, Donald Trump is expected to enter a plea of not guilty. One big question is among many, is it -- will there be any hints offered today during this arraignment of the timing of a trial? Has that -- he got huge ramifications. He's expected in court at 4:00 p.m. Eastern. CNN will have special live coverage.
 
BERMAN: Thank you all for joining us on CNN NEWS CENTRAL. "INSIDE POLITICS" is up next.
