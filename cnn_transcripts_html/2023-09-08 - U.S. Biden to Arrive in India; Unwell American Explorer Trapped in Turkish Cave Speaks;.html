(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ZAIN ASHER, CNN HOST, FIRST MOVE: A Warm Welcome to "First Move". I'm Zain Asher in for my colleague Julia Chatterley. Just ahead on today's show 
 
 summit countdown U.S. President Biden set to land in New Delhi this hour for this weekend's G-20 meetings.
 
Biden, a G-20 participant but Russia's Putin and China Xi will both be no shows this time. We'll discuss what exactly can be achieved at this summit 
 
 and why it's such an important showcase for India and for Prime Minister Narendra Modi?
 
Plus car countdown, the big three U.S. automakers and the United Auto Workers are still far apart on a new contract with less than one week to go 
 
 before a potentially crippling strike. We'll discuss the impact a walkout would have on the U.S. economy just ahead.
 
The countdown to Wall Street trading day is on as well. A losing week so far but a flat open on top for the major averages. European stocks 
 
 currently trading mixed. Let's hone in on Apple shares. They're set for mostly higher open after a horrible week for shareholders.
 
The stock has actually been tumbling on reports that workers in the Chinese government and state run organizations will be banned from using iPhone all 
 
 this ahead of a new iPhone product launch for Apple next week.
 
Meantime, it was a week Friday session in Asia. The Hong Kong exchange closed today amid the chaos caused by flash flooding in the city details on 
 
 that later on in the show. But first U.S. President Joe Biden expected to arrive in India very soon ahead of the G-20 Summit this weekend. Shortly 
 
 after landing in New Delhi he's going to be meeting with the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
 
China's Xi Jinping and Russia's Vladimir Putin are not attending this year's summit. Let's bring in Jeremy Diamond who is live for us in New 
 
 Delhi. So how much will Biden's presence there sort of filling the void left by China's Xi and Russia's Putin?
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well listen Zain President Biden has said that he's disappointed that Xi Jinping will not be here. And 
 
 the President's National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan says that those two leaders not being here in particular, the Chinese President doesn't 
 
 necessarily change Biden's pitch to world leaders here at the G-20.
 
But privately, U.S. officials very much acknowledging that Xi Jinping not being here certainly leaves an opening for President Biden to more 
 
 forcefully deliver the message that he intended to deliver here. And that the United States is the most reliable the best partner for the developing 
 
 world going forward.
 
And President Biden is coming to this G-20 in India armed with a key deliverables targeted for that pitch. And that is that the President is 
 
 coming here talking about reforming some of the multilateral development banks including the World Bank, and also coming armed with proposals to 
 
 increase funding for the World Bank by billions of dollars.
 
And that would be $25 billion of additional funding proposed by the U.S. bring it to $100 billion if other countries come on board, which is 
 
 something that U.S. officials do indeed expect. But there's no question that this will be a divided G-20 as well regardless of whether Xi Jinping 
 
 and Vladimir Putin are here their representatives will be and they will be objecting two key parts of a joint communique that leaders are trying to 
 
 get here in particular, as the U.S. looks to continue to condemn Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.
 
Last year at the G-20 these leaders agreed to a joint declaration a leaders declaration that pointed out the differences among the leaders as it 
 
 relates to the war in Ukraine. We will see if this time they are able to get together that joint communique.
 
But it seems that if they do it will be unlikely to voice strong condemnation of Russia's actions in Ukraine. No less because India is 
 
 hosting this summit and the Indian government has refused to sign on to some of the sanctions and they have also refused to condemn Russia 
 
 explicitly for their invasion of Ukraine.
 
There are also a host of bilateral issues to be worked out. This visit comes just a couple of months after Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited 
 
 the White House. There were some key security and trade agreements that we expect to be expanded upon today as President Biden and the Indian Prime 
 
 Minister sit down.
 
One last note saying there will be no press in the room as those two leaders meet just a few hours from now. That's a result of a decision by 
 
 the Indian government. Top U.S. officials telling us that they did try. They tried to press the Indians to allow press into this room about the 
 
 absence will indeed highlight India's issues with press freedom are ranked as one of the worst country as it relates to issues of press freedom in the 
 
 world Zain.
 <br>[09:05:00]
 
ASHER: All right, Prime Minister Narendra Modi rarely answers questions from reporters. Jeremy Diamond live for us there thank you so much. While 
 
 the leader of the world's second largest economy skips the G-20 tensions remain high between China and the United States.
 
In particular the conflict over tech and chips concern is mounting about the tech inside phones made by China's Huawei. And this week Apple lost 
 
 $200 billion of its market value in just two days amid reports of an iPhone ban for China's government officials.
 
Anna Stewart is Live in London. So here you have Apple, the world's most valuable company, essentially limited in terms of how much business it can 
 
 do in the world's second largest economy. Investors look at this Anna they think what?
 
ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It's not been a great week for Apple; I have to say I think we have a share price of their performance from the 
 
 week. Share price was down 4 percent on Wednesday, 3 percent yesterday, as you said that's $200 billion wiped off its valuation.
 
And all on these reports about a limitation on its iPhone being used in China, a market that accounts for about a fifth of its revenue last year so 
 
 this kicked off on Wednesday with the Wall Street Journal reporting that government officials would be banned from using iPhone then we had 
 
 Bloomberg and some other outlets saying that would be extended to also include employees of state backed firms.
 
If true, that would be tens of millions of people potentially. We have had a statement though from China. A spokesperson from China's Ministry of 
 
 Foreign Affairs essentially said that foreign companies are welcome in China as long as they obey the rules and regulations and added this line.
 
China's approach is fundamentally different from some individual countries who abused the so called security concepts to suppress and contain Chinese 
 
 enterprises. Of course, the U.S. has banned Huawei since 2019 in terms of communications devices, so I suggest there is some messaging there. And the 
 
 timing of all of this Zain, so as you mentioned, Huawei launched this week to great panic I think in the U.S.
 
Its latest phone, the Mate 60 Pro, you're seeing it there it has a very high tech, apparently Chinese made chip in it. And this all ahead of next 
 
 week when Apple is expected to launch the latest iPhone 15.
 
ASHER: Right, the timing, as you point out, certainly suspect. Anna I do want to talk about Norway. Norway has one of the biggest sovereign wealth 
 
 funds in the world and their reports that they're going to be shutting their Shanghai office in a pivot to Singapore, which is interesting, just 
 
 walk us through that.
 
STEWART: So this is an interesting move from them. So moving out of their Shanghai Office where they've been I think, since 2007, ever since they 
 
 were granted a license to trade in onshore Chinese stock exchanges.
 
And this pullback from you know, the biggest investor really in equity markets around the world has $1.4 trillion in assets is big news. It 
 
 follows something of a trend so many banks and financial services firms have pulled back or scaled back their expansion plans in China over recent 
 
 years for a number of reasons.
 
Firstly, there's of course, politics. It's becoming increasingly unpredictable in China for business. The anti-espionage law earlier this 
 
 year, the broadening of that definitely scared quite a few firms. And then you've got the economic backdrop in China and the fact that is becoming 
 
 less and less attractive for foreign investment, Zain.
 
ASHER: Right. Anna Stewart, live was there, thank you. A major new development in Spain's ongoing women's football Scandal; the National 
 
 Prosecutor has just filed a complaint against Luis Rubiales the suspended President of the country's Football Federation on the grounds of sexual 
 
 assault and coercion.
 
It stems from the now infamous incident last month when Rubiales kissed star player Jenni Hermoso on the lips after her team's victory in the World 
 
 Cup final. Hermoso says she did not consent to being kissed anyway what so ever. The complaint could open the way to charges against Rubiales who have 
 
 rejected all calls to resign. Amanda Davies is here with more Amanda, what more can you tell us here?
 
AMANDA DAVIES, CNN WORLD SPORTS: Hi, Zain. Yes, what we know is that this is another step in a process from the Spanish legal structures that has 
 
 been ongoing now for nearly three weeks since that incident, as you mentioned, that took place in Sydney on August the 20th.
 
It is a step that yes is called a complaint. But what it has done is it has opened the way for the Spanish prosecutors to begin to gather evidence to 
 
 build a case which could lead to criminal charges. And what this announcement has done today is that it has named the charges and the crime 
 
 that will be investigated, as you mentioned is for sexual assault and coercion and it follows testimony that Jenni Hermoso the player gave 
 
 earlier this week with her lawyer.
 <br>[09:10:00]
 
There's been some interesting added information that has come from the statement that has been issued today. Saying from the prosecutor's office, 
 
 Jenni Hermoso, also referred in her statement that both she and people close to her suffered constant and repeated pressure from Luis Rubiales and 
 
 his professional environments.
 
So interestingly, perhaps, we are now talking about a broader scope than just the incident that took place on August the 20th. And perhaps refers 
 
 more to the letter that those 15 players, last 15 as they became known, wrote to the Spanish football authorities complaining about the management 
 
 structures and the processes in place as they represented their national team.
 
Of course, all of that going on in the background as Spain went on to win that historic first ever Women's World Cup. Luis Rubiales, for his part we 
 
 know was already been suspended by World Football's Governing Body FIFA for an initial period of 90 days.
 
But up to this point, he has remained defiant. He has refused to step down from his post as President of the Spanish Football Federation, despite 
 
 growing pressure on him to do so, as well as the criminal case here.
 
So this might then open the way for the Spanish sporting tribunals and bodies to take more of a stance. They looked into charges of misconduct 
 
 last week. They said they decided that it could be only described as a serious offense.
 
Rather than a very serious offense, which is the bar by which they are able to take action? So you wonder at what point in these legal processes that 
 
 would give the sporting tribunals more grounds to take action of their own?
 
ASHER: Yes, we await some kind of reaction from Rubiales on the possibility that he may indeed face criminal charges. We will be watching closely 
 
 Amanda Davies live for us there. Thank you so much.
 
All right, more now on the American trapped inside one of Turkey's deepest caves. 40-year-old Mark Dickey fell ill while he was about 1100 meters 
 
 below the surface with gastrointestinal bleeding. Turkish officials say the operation to bring Dickey could begin tomorrow and it will take 
 
 approximately four days.
 
Nada Bashir joins us live now. So Nada, here you have a man who is about thousand meters below ground, the sort of operation to bring him to the 
 
 surface would be a complicated one, even for a healthy person and when you add to the fact that he may need a stretcher, just walk us through how much 
 
 that does indeed complicate things?
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER: Yes, absolutely Zain. This is a deeply complex operation. We're talking about a mission that could take days several 
 
 multinational teams involved in this rescue effort. And as you mentioned that this is an individual who isn't in the best state when it comes to 
 
 health?
 
Of course, there are concerns around the pressure put around the stomach area that is where he suffered that injury earlier this week. So that is a 
 
 key area of concern. That is something that the teams on the ground are considering before they make the decision whether or not to begin that 
 
 rescue effort tomorrow.
 
Now of course, we are talking about a deep area, winding narrow passageway. So that will be a complex logistical mission. But we've heard, of course 
 
 from Mark Dickey in a message released yesterday. Take a look at where he is right now. He is seemingly in a better condition. But of course there 
 
 are still several obstacles ahead for him.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BASHIR (voice-over): In the dark and cavernous depths of Turkey's mocha sinkhole, a welcome update.
 
MARK DICKEY, CAVE EXPLORER: Mark Dickey from nearly thousand meters.
 
BASHIR (voice-over): American Caver Mark Dickey now set to be in a stable condition after falling ill some 3500 feet below ground almost a week ago.
 
DICKEY: You can see I'm up, I'm alert I'm talking but I'm not healed on the inside yet, so I need a lot of help to get out of here.
 
BASHIR (voice-over): Rescuers say Dickey suffered gastrointestinal bleeding during his research expedition and required urgent medical attention at 
 
 face camp. According to officials, six units of blood had to be delivered to him.
 
It's an operation which has drawn about 150 rescuers from across the globe to Turkey's third deepest cave. The Turkish Caving Federation says it 
 
 typically takes a full 15 hours for an experienced caver to reach the surface in ideal conditions. But Dickey's health is still in a delicate 
 
 state, and the narrow winding passages of the cave, as well as frigid temperatures could pose a major challenge to rescue us.
 
GRETCHEN BAKER, NATIONAL CAVE RESCUE COMMISSION: The team on the ground is very happy that Mark's condition seems to be proving so that it looks like 
 
 that he will not have to be in a litter the entire way out. But there may be portions of the cave that he has to be in that litter.
 <br>[09:15:00]
 
So the more he can help, the faster the rescue can go. But even with him helping, we're anticipating that it will take days to get him out of the 
 
 cave.
 
BASHIR (voice-over): For now, Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Authority says the operation is running smoothly. And though this is a huge 
 
 logistical undertaking, there is cautious optimism for Dickey's safe return.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
BASHIR (on camera): Hopes that that rescue effort will begin tomorrow but a further assessment will really need to be undertaken to assess Dickey's 
 
 health we're talking about a truly multinational fit.
 
We have teams from Hungary, Poland, Italy, Croatia and Bulgaria on the ground as part of this effort including some 32 individuals who are in this 
 
 cave at the moment supporting that effort. Now preparations are being made. But as I said, this is a process that could take days, Zain.
 
ASHER: All right. Nada Bashir live was there. Thank you so much. OK, still to come here on "First Move", you list is out naming the cream of the crop 
 
 in the world of artificial intelligence. We'll discuss with the Times Editor-in-Chief after the break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ASHER: Welcome back to "First Move". AI has been the buzzword for 2023 from education to big tech giants developing new programs. Artificial 
 
 Intelligence is pretty much just about everywhere. Now Time Magazine has revealed its inaugural Time100 AI lists highlighting the hundred most 
 
 influential people in artificial intelligence.
 
You can see handful them on the front cover there. The list features well- known names in the space including obviously Elon Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, scientists, musicians and even Japanese author who used AI to 
 
 produce the first completely AI illustrated Japanese comic also made the cut as well.
 
It also featured policymakers government officials like Omar Al Omar, who became the world's first Minister of Artificial Intelligence in 2017 taking 
 
 office in the United Arab Emirates. Joining us live now is Times Editor-in- Chief Sam Jacobs. Sam, thank you so much for being with us.
 
So just walk us through how exactly you put the list together. Obviously there are some household names that you've all heard of, I mean the likes 
 
 of Sam Altman, Elon Musk, but they're also some surprises on the list as well take us through it.
 <br>[09:20:00]
 
SAM JACOBS, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF AT TIME: Thank you for having me. We're so excited to have the time 100 AI out in the world today and to be able to 
 
 share it with you. We have a many knowledgeable reporters and editors. They spent months talking to their sources.
 
Doing interviews, talking to people throughout the artificial intelligence community to try to build the best picture we can of the people who we 
 
 believe are shaping perhaps the most important scientific and technological transformation that we've seen in decades.
 
ASHER: What I thought was interesting, is that it was quite a diverse list just in terms of yes, there are, of course, a number of Americans. But 
 
 there are also a number of sort of scientists and thought leaders from other countries. And I also found it interesting that you used people who 
 
 were also in the creative sphere as well.
 
So there were writers that were sort of show runners, I mean, one of my favorite shows is Black Mirror, and the creator of Black Mirror also made 
 
 the cut as well.
 
JACOBS: This is an argument. It's an argument about, who is shaping AI today, who's being impacted by it, who's having influence. And we think 
 
 while it's important to recognize the investors, the corporate leaders, the CEOs, the startup founders, who are driving transformation forward.
 
We wanted to widen the aperture we wanted to look beyond the traditional places. And like you said, look at the artists, look at the innovators look 
 
 at the people who are maybe working at the fringes, because this is a technology that's going to grow and be pushed by the people at the 
 
 frontiers.
 
ASHER: Yes, it also included an 18 year old who has put together a youth led movement for ethical sort of pushing for ethical AI. One of the things 
 
 I also just want to get at is why this list is important. When readers open TIME Magazine, they look through this list. I mean, what is the goal here 
 
 just in terms of what you hope them to gain from understanding who's who and AI.
 
JACOBS: Two things, this is an argument one about the importance of AI today, by connecting it with the time 100. We're trying to elevate a 
 
 conversation about why this matters. And second, I think understanding artificial intelligence can be a little bit alienating, it can be 
 
 dehumanizing.
 
We think about these technologies that are maybe matching or exceeding human ability, all the concerns about existential risk. And what we wanted 
 
 to do was to privilege the people who are making AI possible to remind our readers and people around the world that while this technology is moving so 
 
 quickly, and growing at leaps and bounds.
 
There are individuals who are making decisions every day there are relationships that matter. And there are people on all sides of the, AI 
 
 debate whose ideas, vision, their flaws, their insights are shaping what's happening with this technology. So we're providing both a map for people to 
 
 understand the relationships that matter when it comes to AI.
 
But we're also providing an argument to say people matter in this conversation. And these are the people who matter in the conversation 
 
 around AI.
 
ASHER: And do you have sort of an equal number of people who are skeptical and concerned about some of the challenges that AI is going to sort of pose 
 
 as you do people who are really embracing it?
 
JACOBS: Not only is this list an argument, it is the list that is full of arguments. And so we have voices, we talked to over 90 people who are on 
 
 the list of the AI 100. And each of them is making a different case. What's fascinating to me as a reader and an editor is just how much change is 
 
 happening at this moment?
 
How much argument is happening among these people? So we have ethicists and philosophers. We have scientists, academics. We have people who are shaping 
 
 the debate and whose conversations are shaping how we understand where AI is going. So these are not just boosters, or people who are pushing hype.
 
There are people who are thinking really intelligently about what matters. And we're seeing that kind of intelligent debate happening both within the 
 
 AI industry within Silicon Valley, but also among all the different institutions, regulators, thinkers who are challenging what AI means today.
 
ASHER: Right. Sam Jacobs live for us there, thank you so much appreciate it. Meantime, staying with AI and Microsoft says suspected Chinese 
 
 operatives are using images made by artificial intelligence to spread disinformation to American voters ahead of the 2024 U.S. election. From 
 
 Beijing, Steven Jiang reports.
 
STEVEN JIANG, CNN BEIJING BUREAU CHIEF: This latest finding doesn't really come as a surprise to anyone who has been paying attention. Back in 
 
 February, we reported the discovery of China based bot accounts supplanting fake news casts on Twitter and Facebook using AI generated avatars to read 
 
 stories focused on America's shortcomings and flaws while amplifying narratives in line with Beijing's strategic ambitions and goals. Back then, 
 
 experts told us those videos didn't gain too much traction.
 <br>[09:25:00]
 
But fast forward to this latest finding the AI technology and AI generated contents have become a lot more sophisticated making it even harder for 
 
 average users to tell the difference between what's real and what's fake. And that's why this time it seems these contents have generated a lot more 
 
 engagement from real social media users.
 
Now that's something of course, that has been long been warned by U.S. officials and experts, especially in the current U.S. political climate is 
 
 so divisive and polarizing, making Americans easy prey. Now, the Chinese government has pushed back on the latest allegation, calling this report 
 
 full of prejudice and again, as an example of malicious speculation against China.
 
But the matter of fact is ever since Russia adopted this playbook during the 2016 U.S. elections, U.S. officials really seen this coming with the 
 
 FBI, for example, pointing to both Russian and Chinese state actors get involved in influence campaigns during the 2022 midterm elections.
 
And just last month, the parent company of Facebook, Meta actually took down thousands of China based accounts that the company says are tied to 
 
 Chinese law enforcement targeting not just Americans, but also people in Taiwan and elsewhere as part of "cross platform" covert influence 
 
 operation.
 
So this case is definitely not the last time we're going to be hearing about this, with the fast growth of the AI technology and the proliferation 
 
 of AI generated contents. The worry the concern, of course is this is going to deepen the threats posed by cyber-attacks and disinformation campaigns 
 
 aimed at not only interfering with U.S. democracy. But also stealing U.S. data and infiltrating into American society. Steven Jiang, CNN, Beijing.
 
ASHER: Alright, coming up after the break. These are live pictures here Air Force One just landing in New Delhi where it's gone 7 o'clock in the 
 
 evening, any moment now President Biden going to be stepping off that plane, there's going to be an arrival ceremony. Of course, President Biden 
 
 is in India for the G-20 summit.
 
We'll discuss some of his objectives in terms of positioning the U.S. as an economic counterweight to of course Russia and China both of those leaders 
 
 not attending this year's summit. So much discuss with our guests after the break, that's next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:30:00]
 
ASHER: Welcome back to "First Move", U.S. stocks up and running for the last trading day of the week. A flat open for the major averages after a 
 
 rough few days on Wall Street, September is truly living up to its reputation as problematic month for stocks. So far the major averages 
 
 pressured by stronger than expected economic data that could put another Fed rate hike in play later this year.
 
That means next week's read on U.S. consumer prices will be very important for market sentiment. Add to that weakness in shares of artificial 
 
 intelligence chipmaker Nvidia and also Apple as well to other Tech's biggest winners this year.
 
Apple trying to move higher in the first few minutes of trade but shares tumbled more than 3.5 percent on Wednesday and almost represented Thursday 
 
 on concerns that the Chinese government is going to be restricting iPhone usage in that country. So all in all really a rotten week for Apple but 
 
 shares still up over 35 percent so far this year.
 
Returning now to Russia's war on Ukraine, Ukraine says it has started exporting its grain by sending it to port in Croatia. Officials have been 
 
 exploring alternative shipping routes after Russia pulled out of a deal in July allowing Ukrainian exports via the Black Sea.
 
Meantime, Britain says it will discuss ways around Russia's grain blockade at the G-20 Summit this weekend. Nic Robertson joins us live now, Nic; this 
 
 is really perfect timing, because as we're speaking, President Biden has literally just landed in New Delhi, he's about to get off the plane, when 
 
 he gets off that plane.
 
We're going to bring everyone live pictures, but just in terms of what we can expect from the G-20 Summit in terms of commitments when it comes to 
 
 Ukraine, not all members of G-20 are on the same page. As we well know when it comes to Russia's war with Ukraine. What sort of commitments can we 
 
 expect coming out of this?
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Lesser it appears than came out of the Bali G-20 Summit last year and the European Union when 
 
 working over a draft of the final agreed statement. These things get worked on in advance. And of course, the leaders put their signature to it after 
 
 going over some of the details.
 
The European Union said this doesn't match standards this this fall short of what the G-7 wants. So there will be not a meeting of minds there 
 
 indeed, Narendra Modi has not accepted to have President Zelenskyy come to the G-20. Because he feels that would be somehow put all the focus on 
 
 Ukraine.
 
Obviously, President Putin not there, President Xi of China not there as well, so not perhaps strong commitments but that's what the British Prime 
 
 Minister says he's going to try to do. Undoubtedly, this is something President Biden will be part of as well, which is trying to assure many of 
 
 those others present there.
 
The sort of Global South, if you will that it is Ukraine that's losing out. That's Russia. That's the aggressor, Rishi Sunak says look 26 since Russia 
 
 pulled out that grain deal in July. They bombed and damaged 26 different Ukrainian grain facilities. One-third of Ukraine's grain storage facility 
 
 has now been put off the map.
 
And I think this has become a more pressing issue for Ukraine because we heard when President Erdogan of Turkey met with President Putin at the 
 
 beginning of the week in Sochi. President Putin said I want some international sanctions. They have access to the Swift international 
 
 financial mechanisms rollback before I get back into the grain deal.
 
Which is, why Ukraine saying it's working on this alternative route that takes its grain to Croatia to get to Croatian ports that is down the 
 
 Danube, it's a bit of a Niche route because it's not particularly big, but they're also saying they're going to push ahead with a route down the Black 
 
 Sea and independent route independent of that deal.
 
That U.N. brokered that involve Russia as well. It goes closer to the coast that appears Bulgaria, Romania, coastlines, and that's what may make it 
 
 attractive what Rishi Sunak the British Prime Minister brings to this. He said British intelligence British surveillance will help monitor the 
 
 whereabouts of Russian ships.
 <br>[09:35:00]
 
And also apparently has been talking to the British shipping insurance industry and Lloyds in particular who've said that they will support the 
 
 U.N. and its ongoing efforts to continue to get grain out of Ukraine. The big message here is it's not as President Putin puts it, that all of the 
 
 grain of the majority of the grain that comes out of Ukraine goes to Europe.
 
Rishi Sunak said, like two thirds of the grain before the war that came out of Ukraine was going to developing nations 170,000 tons of the grain that 
 
 was shipped out during the war has gone to Yemen and Somalia. So I think there will be a strong push to try to set the record straight on what 
 
 Ukraine grain does for developing nations and the support perhaps, therefore, that they feel it should get more broadly at the G-20.
 
ASHER: Yes, a lot of we talked about this a second ago that a lot of the countries are not on the same page when it comes to the war in Ukraine. But 
 
 there are a lot of countries who do want to show that they are on the side of the global south when it comes to this particular issue. Nic Robertson 
 
 we have to leave it there, thank you so much. We'll have much more news, after the break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ASHER: As you've heard, there are a couple of notable absentees from this year G-20 Summit in India. One of them is of course Chinese President Xi 
 
 Jinping, it's the first time he's missed the annual gathering since taking power in 2012. Joining us now let's talk about why Xi is staying away and 
 
 what it means the G-20?
 
Michael Hirson, Head of China Research, 22V Research. Michael, thank you so much for being with us. So I'm not sure if anyone really knows the answer, 
 
 but just try to sort of shine a light on why President Xi has decided to skip this year's summit. Is it to do with solidarity with to Russia? Or was 
 
 there more to it than that?
 
MICHAEL HIRSON, HEAD OF CHINA RESEARCH 22V RESEARCH: It's really not clear. I doubt that this is just about solidarity with Russia. I think there are 
 
 probably a few factors here. She has a very difficult domestic situation particularly with the economy. China, India, tensions are notably high and 
 
 of course, Delhi is the host of this G-20 meeting.
 
And then it is a difficult time right now between China and the U.S. and to some extent China and Europe. So these may all be reasons why Xi Jinping 
 
 decided not to attend I think, regardless of the reason it is, I think vulnerability for China.
 <br>[09:40:00]
 
It does provide President Biden in particular with a much better environment now to project U.S. Global Leadership at a time when the U.S. 
 
 is in a rivalry with China for this role.
 
ASHER: And I just want to sort of remind our viewers and just talk about what we're seeing on camera right now. We're actually seeing President 
 
 Biden he stepped off Air Force One he's now meeting with dignitaries on the tarmac. Of course, he just arrived in New Delhi for the start of the G-20 
 
 Summit.
 
There is going to be an arrival ceremony for him. It's just gone. Almost a quarter past seven in the evening. I do want to talk about President 
 
 Biden's relationship with Narendra Modi, the fact that you have Xi Jinping not attending that is of course an opportunity for Narendra Modi.
 
How important is this summit for him, the fact that India is hosting the G- 20 and India sort of showcasing itself to the world here?
 
HIRSON: It's quite important for Prime Minister Modi. And he has clearly put a lot of effort into making this G-20 Summit, something of a coming out 
 
 party, if you will, for India, really, as you know, something of a global power. The fact that Xi Jinping is not there is a bit of a snub to Prime 
 
 Minister Modi.
 
It comes as China-India tensions are raising in particular over their border dispute and just their broader rivalry within Asia. But it is going 
 
 to be a chance for Modi to show a strong relationship with the U.S. in particular, and that meeting between Biden and Modi is going to be you 
 
 know, I think, quite important, that's another sign of the strengthening U.S.-India relationship.
 
ASHER: And in terms of the U.S. sort of filling a void if you will, left by Xi's absence, we know the U.S. is going to be announcing $200 billion worth 
 
 of investments for poor country and things like climate change education, loans to various countries in the Global South. This is sort of seen as a 
 
 rival to China's Belt and Road Initiative.
 
But when you look at the actual number, it's really only a fraction of the kinds of investments that countries like China provide, for example, 
 
 African countries and have provided African countries over the course of many years. Just explain to us how exactly the U.S. is positioning itself 
 
 in terms of filling the void here left by China?
 
HIRSON: Well, you're right. It's kind of a drop in the bucket, if you look at if you match it up with China's lending and investment in these 
 
 countries. But it's still important, it's important that the U.S. show that it is not leaving diplomacy to the Global South to China.
 
And China really has focused its diplomatic efforts on the Global South, as its relationship with the U.S., Europe, Japan, and the advanced economies 
 
 has worsened. I don't think the U.S. is trying to match China dollar for dollar. It is trying to stress the quality of this assistance being 
 
 channeled largely through the multilateral development institutions.
 
But it is a steep challenge for the U.S. to match the kind of economic haft that China now has in Africa and other parts of the developing world.
 
ASHER: Alright, Michael Hirson, live for us, thank you so much. We appreciate it. All right, there are further concerns from the U.S. over 
 
 China this time with Beijing buying up American farmland. Some people getting worried about what the Chinese Communist Party plans to do on U.S. 
 
 soil. David Culver has the story.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DAVID CULVER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Just a couple of hours into our drive from Seattle, we start to see the markings of American pride 
 
 Stars and Stripes lining the highways of rural Washington State. This is part of the agricultural backbone that keeps us fed. But as we look closer 
 
 here, we find what might be for America is in some cases, non-American.
 
REP. DAN NEWHOUSE (R-WA): This is something we've kind of woken up to and thought we should do something.
 
CULVER (voice-over): Dan Newhouse splits his time between Sunnyside Washington working as a hops farmer and the other Washington where he 
 
 serves on Congress's recently created Select Committee on the CCP.
 
CULVER: I think a lot of folks Congressman would look at where we are and say, how does that relate to the committee that focuses on the Chinese 
 
 Communist Party?
 
NEWHOUSE: I think there's a huge connection. We've seen a tremendous increase in the number of acres for instance, being purchased by Chinese 
 
 businesses. The increase in the investments has grown by a factor of 10 over the last decade.
 
CULVER (voice-over): A sharp rise he worries will continue.
 
NEWHOUSE: But the one thing that people need to understand is China's not an ally. They're an adversary.
 
CULVER (voice-over): Lawmakers on both sides fear that with control of U.S. farmland, China could manipulate U.S. food supply, surveil sensitive 
 
 military sites, or even steal valuable intellectual property.
 <br>[09:45:00]
 
China's Foreign Ministry says the U.S. is playing off of unwarranted national security fears to discriminate. We drive about an hour from 
 
 Sunnyside to see how close the business ties to China are?
 
CULVER: You ready to see the sign? It's called Syngenta. This is a seed and pesticides manufacturer. It's one of the largest in the world. Let me show 
 
 you something else. As you look from the outside here. Nothing about this suggests that it's for known in fact you can even see that right there. 
 
 It's an American flag that's flying.
 
CULVER (voice-over): Syngenta is headquartered in Switzerland, but owned by ChemChina, which is 100 percent Chinese state controlled and designated 
 
 last year by the Defense Department as a military company. It's CEO, a Former Government Official and member of the Chinese Communist Party.
 
Syngenta is operating here legally, and neither it, nor its parent company has been accused of wrongdoing. In a statement to CNN they stressed that 
 
 Syngenta has approximately 4400 U.S. employees in 43 states and all its activities are conducted on fields and farms in the U.S. to benefit 
 
 American farmers.
 
Newhouse is sponsoring a house bill that would heavily vet and restrict future investment from Chinese entities. A similar effort passed the Senate 
 
 in July and more than two dozen states have either passed or proposed their own restrictions on foreign ownership of land.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They were all family. Now there are no families left.
 
CULVER (voice-over): The restrictions on certain foreign investment could mean fewer options for family farms facing increased financial pressures 
 
 and needing to sell.
 
CULVER: Would you be hesitant in selling to any sort of foreign group that's coming in even if it was a Chinese own company.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I wouldn't like it. But money is money, if they're the only check that he got when he got to do.
 
CULVER (voice-over): The legislation could also have wider consequences.
 
CULVER: One of the biggest counter arguments is oh, that's going to lead to xenophobia, right? That's going to create a prejudice to that you say.
 
NEWHOUSE: I think we can make that distinction between the Chinese people in the Chinese Communist Party. And we're not looking at trying to create 
 
 an anti-Chinese settlement in our country. We're just trying to be smart about how we respond to the Communist Chinese.
 
CULVER (on camera): Amidst increasingly polarized U.S. population efforts seen as tough on China, particularly leading into the 2024 elections are 
 
 among the very few areas in which both Democrats and Republicans find agreement, common ground shared or what they consider to be a common 
 
 adversary. David Culver, CNN, New York.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ASHER: All right, still to come auto angst, U.S. carmakers and a major union a careening toward a potentially damaging strike, very latest on the 
 
 stalled negotiations, just ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:50:00]
 
ASHER: All right here in the U.S. the Big Three automakers are facing a possible very expensive strike. The United Auto Workers Union, which 
 
 represents more than 140,000. And the industry says its members will down tools if there was no deal by the time their contracts expire next week.
 
Vanessa Yurkevich joins us live now with the details. So just give us a sense, Vanessa. I mean, how likely is the strike at this point? And what 
 
 are some of the major sticking points?
 
VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS AND POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: Well, just yesterday, the union received an offer from General Motors. General Motors 
 
 offered a 10 percent increase in pay for workers. But that was not good enough for the Union. They are asking for a 40 percent pay increase across 
 
 all three automakers.
 
And they say that is in part to recoup a lot of the concessions that they made in 29, excuse me in 2008, 2009 during the auto bailout. Now, we have 
 
 never seen a union the UAW strike against all three automakers but they are not backing down saying they will in fact do that. If they don't get the 
 
 deal they're looking for.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
YURKEVICH (voice-over): There's a showdown in Detroit. The United Auto Workers Union is less than a week away from a possible strike against the 
 
 Big Three U.S. Automakers, General Motors, Ford and Stellantis teeing up what would be the second largest U.S. labor strike in a quarter century. 
 
 UAW says their demands have not been met waiting nearly a month on new proposals.
 
SHAWN FAIN, PRESIDENT OF UAW: I'll tell you what I want to do with their proposal. I'm a file it in its proper place, because that's where it 
 
 belongs the trash.
 
YURKEVICH (voice-over): Tensions have been high between the two sides. The union representing 145,000 workers at the three automakers even filed 
 
 unfair labor practice complaints against GM and Stellantis, accusing the companies of not bargaining in good faith, which they deny.
 
GERALD JOHNSON, EVP OF GLOBAL MANUFACTURING AT GENERAL MOTORS: These negotiations are serious and they matter. The outcome impacts all of us, 
 
 every team member and quite frankly, every stakeholder across the country.
 
YURKEVICH (voice-over): GM sent a new offer Thursday with higher pay raises. UAW says it doesn't come close and to "stop wasting our members 
 
 time". Ford also sent a new offer the UAW is reviewing the union called their previous proposal and insult Stellantis says it will have a counter 
 
 by the end of the week,
 
FAIN: This trash can is overflowing with a -- that the Big Three continue to peddle.
 
YURKEVICH (voice-over): For the first time ever, the UAW could strike all three automakers at once. The last strike in 2019 against General Motors 
 
 cost the company $2.9 billion over six weeks. A strike against all three could mean $5 billion in losses in just 10 days.
 
JULIE SU, ACTING U.S. LABOR SECRETARY: We respect their process and are hopeful that they are going to grapple through some hard issues and 
 
 hopefully come to an agreement that's a win-win.
 
YURKEVICH (voice-over): President Joe Biden and the Acting Labor Secretary have stayed out of negotiations. But Biden appointed trusted White House 
 
 Senior Advisor Gene Sperling to keep tabs. Despite talks coming down to the wire. The President said he believes a strike can be avoided.
 
The union has some ambitious demands, asking for a 40 percent pay raise over the course of the four year contract, restoring cost of living 
 
 increases and pension plans for all workers.
 
FAIN: They've had our demands from the outset. And we told them we expect to get there by September 14. And that is September 14 is the deadline, not 
 
 a reference point.
 
YURKEVICH (voice-over): And as the Big Three pivot to electric vehicles, they're planning 10 new battery plants, not under UAW contracts. The union 
 
 is hoping these next contracts protect their members in the future.
 
FAIN: Workers can't be left behind in this transition. You're talking about 20 percent of the power train workers in the Big Three that stand to lose 
 
 their jobs down the road, if we go from ice engines to battery power.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
YURKEVICH (on camera): There's no question that electric vehicles are the future of the auto industry. According to the Economic Policy Institute, if 
 
 legislators and auto companies here in the U.S. invest in electric vehicles right here in the United States that could create 150,000 jobs by 2030.
 
However, if jobs are moved abroad, and there's not investment from legislators into producing these kinds of vehicles here, that could be a 
 
 loss of 75,000 workers and that's what the UAW is concerned about.
 
But, Zain, we just heard a week or two ago, the President announced President Biden announced a $15 billion investment into electric vehicle 
 
 battery plants to try to re-tool current auto plants to produce electric vehicles as well as re-training and re-hiring auto workers to work in that 
 
 capacity.
 <br>[09:55:00]
 
But President Biden, Zain, has a really delicate dance here. He is trying to support the unions. He's a pro-union President. He wants the bargaining 
 
 process to play out. But at the same time, inflation is still too high here in the U.S., the public and polling does not really think that the 
 
 President has a handle on the economy.
 
So at the same time, he does not have any control over these negotiations. He doesn't have the same power that he did say in the rail strike. So the 
 
 President is watching this closely, because at the end of the day, he does not want to strike because that could have serious economic impacts for the 
 
 U.S. economy, something he's really trying to dig his way out of with voters, especially here, Zain.
 
ASHER: Yes, one year until the election and as you pointed out, the poll numbers are not looking favorable for him. So this is the last thing he 
 
 needs and as you point out, he doesn't really have the same power as if it was an airline potentially striking or real worker striking. Vanessa 
 
 Yurkevich, live for us thank you so much. And that is it the show, "Connect the World" is up next. You're watching CNN.
