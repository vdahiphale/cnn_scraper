JAKE TAPPER, CNN HOST: And we're back with more, on Steve Bannon, the former Trump White House adviser, sentenced to four months in prison, and a $6,500 fine, for contempt of Congress, after defying a subpoena, to appear in front of the January 6 committee.
 
Minutes after, the punishment was handed down, a defiant Bannon, gave this warning shot, to Democrats.

STEVE BANNON, FORMER TRUMP ADVISER: Today was my judgment day, by the judge.
 
On November 8th, they're going to have a judgment on the illegitimate Biden regime and quite frankly, and quite frankly, that Nancy Pelosi and the entire committee. And we know which way that's going. 
 <br>[21:15:00]
 
This is democracy. The American people are weighing and measuring what went on with the Justice Department, and how they comported themselves.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
TAPPER: And Steve Bannon' attorney, David Schoen, joins us now.
 
David, thanks so much for taking our questions, really appreciate it. 
 
So, Steve Bannon says he's going to appeal the court's decision. What's the argument that the jury got it wrong?
 
DAVID SCHOEN, STEVE BANNON'S ATTORNEY, REPRESENTED ROGER STONE AND DONALD TRUMP: There are several arguments, by the way. 
 
What was extraordinary, today, is that the judge, first of all, found that a state pending appeal as appropriate. That was not extraordinary. That was appropriate. But that he mentioned, at least four issues that he considers to be substantial questions, for the appeal, meaning that he understands that reasonable jurists could disagree, over at least four questions. 
 
So, the first reason, I say the jury got it wrong? I mean, the jury did their job, appropriately, I think. They couldn't have come to any other conclusion, based on the testimony they heard.
 
But one of the key mistakes in the case, we believe, is that the judge prohibited Mr. Bannon, from putting on any evidence, before the jury or even making reference to any reason, for his response to the subpoena. That is that he believed executive privilege applied, that he relied on the directives of his lawyer, and so on. All of that was prohibited from going before the jury, so.
 
TAPPER: So, you also -- you advised Bannon, not to testify in court? Why not?
 
SCHOEN: Well, if he couldn't tell the story of what happened, then, I didn't think there was any point in having him testify. 
 
People may or may not have noticed it. I actually declined to participate in the trial, in terms of examining witnesses, and making argument, because I had a bit of a disagreement, over strategy, and whether it was appropriate. And I didn't want to legitimize that process.
 
Once the judge made a ruling that all of the defenses in the case would be barred, I didn't want to legitimize the process, by going through the motions, and making it sort of good enough, by asking questions, and so on, so that anyone reviewing would say, "Well, you got a fair trial for that reason." 
 
Couldn't, get a fair trial, in this case, not because of anything bad that the judge did. He gave his reasoned rulings. And he's a very thoughtful and careful judge. But because, I think, overall, those rulings were unfair.
 
I think the jury did deserve to hear all of the facts of the case, and then make a decision, one way or the other.
 
TAPPER: So, this is about his contempt of Congress charge, because the committee, investigating January 6, wanted him to come, and testify. 
 
And I think there are a lot of us, who wonder, why didn't he just go before the committee, and do what so many other, potentially prosecutable suspects, in this investigation have done, General Flynn, Roger Stone, Eastman, et cetera, and just assert the Fifth Amendment, for any answers that might incriminate him?
 
SCHOEN: Yes.
 
TAPPER: I don't understand why he didn't just do that.
 
SCHOEN: He, because he's Steve Bannon. He doesn't like the optic, of taking the Fifth Amendment. I have said before that I tend to think I would advise any client,
 
 appearing before this committee, to take the Fifth, quite frankly, because I have real problems with the political composition, of the committee. 
 
I think it was inappropriate to make Chairman Thompson, the Chairman, after he sued former President Trump, alleging that former President Trump was responsible, for the events of January 6th, and that he, Chairman Thompson, suffered personal injuries, from him. I don't think that's the kind of Chair for a committee that can gain the confidence of the whole country.
 
TAPPER: I want to focus on, on Mr. Bannon. Because, he talks, very freely, about January 6, on the air. Why would he feel fine talking about January 6 on the air, but not under oath, as required by law?
 
SCHOEN: Well, the subpoena, from this committee, raised a peculiar issue. I mean, that's, again, one of the things the Judge mentioned today. What are the rights and obligations of the recipient of a subpoena, from a congressional committee, when executive privilege is invoked? 
 
Now, there are all sorts of issues around that, obviously, the extent to which a former President can invoke privilege, the degree, to which the incumbent can supersede that invocation of privilege.
 
But Mr. Bannon, as I said, today, in court, is a person -- take away the name, Bannon, because that presents a lot of sort of inflammatory thoughts, among people. But Mr. Bannon, is a person, who believes in the Constitution, respects the institution of the presidency, and in this case, respected the invocation of executive privilege, and the presumptive validity of such an invocation.
 
TAPPER: So, the prosecution says Bannon, quote, "Acted in bad faith throughout by claiming he was merely acting on former President Trump's instructions," the executive privilege claims you're referring to, "even though former President Trump's attorney made clear he was not," unquote. 
 
So, did Trump ask him not to testify? And when was the last time they spoke?
 <br>[21:20:00]
 
SCHOEN: Well, this guy you're talking about, Justin Clark, President's so-called attorney, I call, one of the thugs, of that administration, based on personal experience with him, and I wouldn't believe anything that he says, wrote a letter, the same letter he wrote, to Meadows, and Scavino, and everyone else, with one exception, regarding immunity, nothing to do with privilege, wrote a letter, saying, condemning the committee, and saying President Trump, is invoking privilege.
 
This is a protective assertion of privilege. So, it's sort of pre- emptive. They don't know what documents exactly would be an issue. He now began cooperating with the government, and all of a sudden has said, "Oh, well, he didn't say this. And he didn't mean that," and so on.
 
The lawyer clearly was aware that this guy, Clark, was trying to pull something at the time, and warned Bannon about that. But he invoked privilege. And President -- former President Trump made that clear, on July 9th, when he wrote a letter, confirming that he invoked executive privilege, when Bannon got the subpoena.
 
TAPPER: But executive privilege protects people, who work in the White House, or the administration, who are giving the President, advice. 
 
Steve Bannon was a private citizen. He had nothing to do -- he didn't work with the administration. I've never heard, of a successful executive privilege claim, applying to somebody who's outside the government.
 
SCHOEN: Well, you make a point that many people try to make. And unfortunately, with all due respect, it's just not accurate. 
 
There's a Justice Department opinion, right on point. And it makes sense, if you think about it. That opinion was, whether someone, who no longer employed, in the executive branch, can still enjoy executive privilege, with the President. The Office of Legal Counsel, in the Justice Department, said absolutely.
 
So, think about it. If President Biden today somehow concluded that the economy is not where he wanted to be, and he called in the CEO of some successful company, and they shared thoughts? That CEO has the right to believe his discussions will be privileged, and President Biden has the right to make those conversations privileged. That person never worked in the executive branch.
 
Henry Kissinger would be another example, who had worked there, but no longer does. There are reasons the institution maintains that executive privilege, even with people outside the executive branch.
 
TAPPER: This all has to do with the January 6 investigation.
 
Listen to your client, the day before that horrific assault, on the Capitol.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BANNON: All hell is going to break loose tomorrow. Just understand this. All hell is going to break loose tomorrow.
 
It's not going to happen like you think it's going to happen, OK? It's going to be quite extraordinarily different. And all I can say is, strap in.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: What did your client mean by that? What did he know about what was planned for the next day?
 
SCHOEN: I don't know the answer to that question. I think what he meant is, things are going to be chaotic, the next day. I certainly don't think he anticipated any violence, the next day and so on. But I really don't know the answer to that question.
 
TAPPER: Your client repeatedly told the public lies about the election, including about Dominion voting machines. 
 
Those claims were thoroughly investigated, and refuted by senior members of the Trump Administration, under oath. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BILL BARR, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP: That there was this systemic corruption, in the system, and that their votes didn't count, and that these machines, controlled by somebody else, were actually determining it, which was complete nonsense.
 
PAT CIPOLLONE, FORMER TRUMP WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL: Attorney General had reached a conclusion that there wasn't sufficient election fraud, to change the outcome of the election.
 
RICHARD DONOGHUE, FORMER ACTING U.S. DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL: He said there's lots of fraud going on here.
 
Told him flat-out that much of the information he's getting is false.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: There was obviously -- well, there was the former Attorney General Barr. That was Pat Cipollone, from the White House, and the former acting Deputy Attorney General, Donoghue. 
 
Has your client stopped telling the specific lies, about Dominion? And why does he continue to tell these other lies about the election?
 
SCHOEN: When did you stop beating your wife? I don't really mind--
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
TAPPER: They are lies. They are empirically lies.
 
SCHOEN: --Steve Bannon says.
 
TAPPER: I mean, these are -- these are Trump officials, saying it. Take their word for it, not mine.
 
SCHOEN: But I can -- I understand. I can tell you this. Despite what they've written in the media that some have suggested, Trump knew otherwise, and so on? Having spoken both to President -- former President Trump, and Bannon, on the subject, I can tell you that they believe, in their heart of hearts, they believe they've investigated and so on, that there was election fraud. They believe that. 
 
So, it's not something that, despite whatever in the media, they think they're making up. I understand your point completely. But, I am telling you, I believe they sincerely think -- believe in what they're saying.
 
TAPPER: Well, I can believe that all the gold in Fort Knox is mine. That doesn't mean I can go in there and get it!
 
So, let me just ask you one final question, sir. Joshua Green, in Bloomberg, today, writes, quote, "In his own mind, and almost certainly in the MAGA hive mind," Bannon's "now a martyr to the cause, a "patriot" who refused to testify on (shaky) grounds of executive privilege. He'll surely take advantage of it. As one of his old colleagues predicted to me a few weeks ago: 'If Steve gets six months, he'll treat it like he's Nelson Mandela. He'll write a memoir. He'll treat himself as a political prisoner.'"
 
Does he see himself, like that?
 
SCHOEN: I don't know that he does. I've said, from the beginning of this case, what a terrible mistake this committee was making. They were banding in about in the press that they're going to make an example of Steve Bannon. 
 <br>[21:25:00]
 
I've said, from the beginning, I believe they will make him a martyr, by criminally prosecuting him, under the circumstances, of this case, when they had an option, when they could have gotten the information, from him, gotten him to testify, simply through a civil enforcement proceeding, as he suggested.
 
I think there's that real possibility. I think that people are very upset, about what happened here. The criminal liability was imposed on someone, who believed he did the right thing, and the only lawful course, open to him.
 
TAPPER: David Schoen, thank you so much, for taking our questions. We appreciate it.
 
SCHOEN: Thank you.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
TAPPER: David Schoen, in an interview, we taped, earlier today.
 
Coming up, vodka, wine and sweet letters, Italy's former leader, has been caught on tape, gushing over the barbaric leader of Russia. It's causing a major headache, for his country, just as a new government is about to take over. That bizarre and upsetting story, next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[21:30:00]
 
TAPPER: Too often, on cable news, hosts, on the left, and the right, feed you bogus stories, to outrage you. Often these stories are false and demonizing and dumb.
 
But here's a story that should genuinely make you mad. 
 
Newly leaked audio, of former Italian Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi, is exactly what the people of Ukraine, do not want to hear. They are already facing a brutal winter, possibly with no power, due to Russian attacks, on civilian power stations. 
 
Meanwhile, Berlusconi, the 86-year-old wealthy former four-time Prime Minister was just re-elected to Parliament. So, the guy, who's about to play, a key role, in forming the majority government, got a call, from an old friend.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SILVIO BERLUSCONI, FORMER ITALIAN PRIME MINISTER (through translator): I have re-established relations with President Putin a bit, quite a bit.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: His office confirmed to CNN that these clips are legit. 
 
The new Prime Minister of Italy, Giorgia Meloni, just officially named today, has promised to keep sending Ukraine, weapons.
 
But this next part of the audio, makes it clear, this wasn't a "Hey, how you doing" kind of chat between Berlusconi and Putin.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BERLUSCONI (through translator): For my birthday, he sent me 20 bottles of vodka, and a very sweet letter. 
 
I replied with bottles of Lambrusco and an equally sweet letter.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: Sweet?
 
An adviser, to Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, wrote, in Italian, on Twitter, quote, "He must be under the influence of Russian vodka."
 
Berlusconi's propensity to party, and the scandals that ensued, have marked his decades in power. By 2010, the phrase "Bunga bunga" was used to describe his notorious sex parties. There were later convictions, including for tax fraud, and bribery, one for paging an underage prostitute, was later overturned.
 
Italy has played a key role in Europe's united response, to Putin's brutal war, on the Ukrainian people.
 
But, on the tapes, Berlusconi appears to blame, Ukraine, for the invasion. 
 
In an interview with an Italian newspaper, Berlusconi said, quote, "I don't deny my past friendship with Vladimir Putin," unquote. That would be hard to do, anyway, when he once named a bed, after the guy, and gave him bedsheets, which showed the two of them shaking hands! 
 
Can you imagine being one of the poor besieged citizens, of Ukraine, victimized by Putin's bombs, war crimes being committed, against women and children, and you hear this filth, from Berlusconi? I guess, for some, Putin's barbarism is nothing compared to his access, to good vodka!
 
With just over two weeks, until the midterms, the pressure's building. One of the highest profile races is the competition for the U.S. Senate's. It's an open seat, in Ohio, where Democratic congressman, Tim Ryan, is facing off against Republican author, J.D. Vance. 
 
One of those two candidates will join me next.
 <br>[21:35:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
TAPPER: 42 years ago, tonight, was one of the best memories, of my childhood. It's when the Philadelphia Phillies won their first ever World Series. I was 11, watching on a little black and white TV, in my room. 
 
My next guests also love the Phillies, but they are also diehard San Diego Padres fans, which is tough, since, right now, those teams are facing off for the National League Championship Series.
 
The parents of Phillies pitcher, Aaron Nola, and Padres catcher, Austin Nola, are literally crisscrossing the country, to support their sons. 
 
Austin and Aaron made history, on the field, this week, marking the, first time, siblings faced each other, as batter and pitcher, in the postseason. That game of course, leaving their parents, A.J. and Stacie Nola, to probably be the only people in the stadium, rooting for both sides. 
 
I talked with them, tonight, before the first pitch, in Game 3.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
TAPPER: A.J., one of your sons, is going to have his heartbroken. Hopefully, Austin! And one of your sons is going to head to the World Series. Hopefully, Aaron! That must be quite a mix of emotions?
 
A.J. NOLA, DAD TO THE PHILLIES' AARON NOLA AND THE PADRES' AUSTIN NOLA: Yes. It's a ton of emotions, running through my head, right now, Jake. It's, yesterday, we celebrated the Wednesday night win, with Austin. And then, a few hours later, we consoled Aaron. So it's, yes, it's very emotional for us, but then thrilled, at the same time.
 
TAPPER: Stacie, as parents, we'd do anything for our kids. I went to see my son, my 13-year-old, play football, earlier this week. 
 
But the sacrifices, you have made, for your sons, must have been, and continue to be, extraordinary?
 
STACIE NOLA, MOM TO THE PHILLIES' AARON NOLA AND THE PADRES' AUSTIN NOLA: They are. It's been a -- it's been a long ride. But it's been good. They have both worked really hard. And we would do anything for them. 
 
As you can see, we're traveling, literally, across the United States, to support both of them. And we wouldn't have it any other way.
 
TAPPER: A.J., you guys have literally been traveling, all over the country, to support your sons. We're going to show the viewers, a map. 
 
Since October 6th, you've gone, from your home, in Baton Rouge, to New York, then St. Louis, back home to Baton Rouge, on to Philly, Baton Rouge again, at the San Diego, back to Philly, Baton Rouge again, San Diego once more, and then Philly.
 
That's quite a grueling schedule! How are you able to do it?
 
NOLA: Well, I'll tell you, what. This could be a once-in-a-lifetime ordeal. And we just made the sacrifices too. We've done it, when they were little league, and traveling all over, for tournaments. And so, now they're big leagues. So, we're doing the same. And even though it's a gruel, and it's red-eye flights, and less sleep than what we really want? And, man we're having the time of our lives, right now.
 
TAPPER: I'll bet! 
 <br>[21:40:00]
 
And Stacie, I understand, you all had planned to have a family dinner, last night, but took on babysitting, so Aaron and Austin could go out together. How are they feeling about today? 
 
I know Wednesday's matchup, where Austin hit off Aaron, and turned the game around, for the Padres, was must -- it was tough for me. So, I can't even imagine what it was like, for Aaron.
 
S. NOLA: It's, yes, it's -- that was hard. That was hard for all of us. But yes, we let them go out, and have some fun. And they're both doing well with it. I think they're going to just have some fun.
 
TAPPER: And A.J., you coached them, through their freshman years of high school. Game 2, on Wednesday, was the first time, in postseason history that siblings faced each other, as batter and pitcher. 
 
What was that like for you? Because, you were part of that, you were part of the history there. Were there moments that you wanted to get in there, and coach Aaron or Austin, at any point?
 
NOLA: Oh, man, I am. Hey, I'm locked in on Aaron's every pitch, and then I'm, when I'm watching it on TV, I'm fighting with the TV, is why they called this pitch, why they called that pitch. 
 
And I'm so into the game, and like, I was, Wednesday night, I was -- I was locked in the game. And I was just hoping that he would go a little longer, in the game, and give Phillies, a little bit more of a chance. But hey, that's baseball, man! That's why I love it so much. It's unpredictable.
 
TAPPER: He's so great. He's such an asset, to the team.
 
And Stacie, I hear that you're the one, who agonizes, the most, during games. How are you feeling about tonight, Game 3? S. NOLA: I'm good. I mean, I'm good, right now, because Aaron's not pitching. So, I can just go and enjoy, and whichever team wins, wins, and I don't have to worry about it. 
 
I get more nervous, during -- when he's pitching. And it just magnified, to have him pitching against Austin. Now it's -- and I'm hoping that one of these teams does it (ph), in 5, so I don't have to see him have to do this again.
 
TAPPER: Phillies in 5, I hear you. OK.
 
A.J., this series is tied one-to-one.
 
S. NOLA: You bet, yes (ph).
 
TAPPER: Do you have any feelings about tonight's game?
 
NOLA: Well, I think Musgrove's got the advantage, tonight, over Suarez, man. I mean, I think, that's my opinion on it. But, on the flip side, you've got home field advantage. 
 
And we were here, for the Braves series, in which these Philly fans were, I mean, it shook the building, I thought there was -- the building was going to fall. It's no lie. You'll see it, when you come. But these Philly fans are -- I don't even know how to describe them. They're supportive. They're rowdy. They cheer every single pitch. 
 
It's, they're hungry for a championship. They haven't won it in the 11 years, you know? And I think both of these teams are hungry. San Diego is 16 years out, never won a championship at all in any sport. So, it's going to get interesting, these next few games.
 
TAPPER: Well, you don't have to describe Philly fans to me! I am one!
 
Stacie and A.J., congratulations, on what you've done, raising these two incredible boys, who also have great reputations, as good people. Enjoy the game. Maybe I'll see you, Sunday. I hope to be up there.
 
S. NOLA: Thank you.
 
NOLA: Thank you, Jake.
 
S. NOLA: Thank you, appreciate it.
 
NOLA: Thanks for hearing our story, man. Appreciate it.
 
TAPPER: Of course. Go Phils! 
 
We'll be right back.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 <br>[21:45:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) TAPPER: We're less than three weeks, from Election Day. And a number of critical races that will determine control of the Senate are neck- and-neck. 
 
In Ohio, Democratic congressman Tim Ryan is holding his own, against lawyer, turned author, turned politician, J.D. Vance. The race is getting heated, with the two, going at each other, at a recent debate. 
 
Voters are worried about their pocketbooks, according to a new poll that shows 41 percent of Ohioans think the most important issue of this election is the economy, well over every other issue, including any threats to democracy, or the abortion rights battle.
 
Democratic Senate candidate, and Ohio congressman, Tim Ryan, joins us now.
 
We should note that we have invited J.D. Vance, as well, to come anytime he wants.
 
Congressman, thanks so much, for joining us.
 
So, President Biden, and a lot of other Democrats, have been spending a lot of time, and money, campaigning on abortion rights. Senator Bernie Sanders told me, a week ago that he thinks it's a mistake, for Democrats, to focus entirely on that, that they should be talking more about the economy. 
 
What do you think?
 
REP. TIM RYAN (D-OH): I agree. I mean, the economy has been the, the issue, the driving issue, for us, here in this race, the last 18 months. Ohio's an economic state. People are hurting. They need help. I've been pushing the tax cut. 
 
But we're also bringing the jobs of the future here, electric vehicles, the chip-manufacturing Intel project, which will be $100 billion, solar panels, in Toledo, natural gas, in the southeast part of the state. 
 
It's about rebuilding the great American middle-class, and making sure that people have opportunity, and a good job and some -- a dignified retirement. And that's what we're fighting for. That's what Ohio wants.
 
TAPPER: Obviously, inflation and rising prices are top of mind, for Ohioans. That must be hurting your campaign, just being in the majority party. 
 
And yesterday, House Majority Whip, Jim Clyburn, said this, about the $1.9 trillion economic recovery plan that Democrats passed last year. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. JAMES CLYBURN (D-SC): Well let me make it very clear. All of us are concerned about these rising costs. And all of us knew this would be the case, when we put in place, this recovery program. Anytime you put more money, into the economy, prices tend to rise.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: You voted for the bill. Did you vote for it, knowing that it would push prices up?
 <br>[21:50:00]
 
RYAN: Yes, no, not at all. And, I think, right now, we need a tax cut. I mean, we were experiencing a pandemic. We did a number of rescue packages, when President Trump was in, and then, again, with President Biden. We had to rescue the economy. And we had to make some significant investments. 
 
We are moving into a phase now. And we have to return the supply chain. We got to stop the price gouging that's we know is happening out there. Some of the big corporations are doing it. But we got to move the supply chain back. That was the CHIPS Act. That was the Infrastructure bill. That was the Inflation Reduction Act. 
 
For 30 years or 40 years, Jake, the corporations, the wealthiest people, in this country, shipped our jobs, overseas, sold out the American workers, and we have hollowed-out communities. And then, a pandemic hits, and we realize we're not we're not making anything in the United States anymore, we got to bring it back.
 
TAPPER: Yes.
 
RYAN: So, that's the effort moving forward. And, I think, in Ohio, there's a clear contrast. 
 
A guy like me, who wants to take that issue on, take on the corporate interest, take on China, and move the manufacturing back. 
 
You got a guy like J.D. Vance, who's actually investing into China, making money off it, and shipping the products back here. 
 
So, they're not (ph) getting the supply chains back.
 
TAPPER: Yes.
 
RYAN: And I'm the guy, in Ohio, that's going to get it done.
 
TAPPER: So, was Jim Clyburn wrong, when he said that? You didn't all know that putting money into the economy was going to cause inflation?
 
RYAN: Well, you got to remember. I mean, we were coming out of the pandemic, you know? There were a lot of -- there weren't many good choices there. 
 
We needed to put some money into the economy. We had to rescue businesses, families. People were on unemployment. The economy locked up. And then the globe locked up. And so, we had to get that done. 
 
I don't regret doing it. What I'm saying now is give people a tax cut, so that they can actually have some money in their pocket. That's the solution.
 
TAPPER: So, you're reluctant to criticize Congressman Clyburn. And that kind of like dovetails, with the fact that you've been hit hard, and with a lot of ad money, for voting 100 percent of the time, with Speaker Pelosi. With the benefit of hindsight, are there any votes you regret?
 
RYAN: Well, let me say, I love Jim Clyburn. He's one of my best friends in Congress. And he's a good man. 
 
And, I ran against Nancy Pelosi, Jake. You remember that. You covered that.
 
TAPPER: Yes.
 
RYAN: I think one of the hardest things, in Washington, D.C. to do, is for you to take on your own party's leadership. And I did that. And I've got the scars to prove it. And that's the kind of leadership we need. 
 
And it's great contrast to J.D. Vance, who Donald Trump said he was an ass-kisser, from the stage, in Youngstown, Ohio, and J.D. went back up on the stage, after he took his dignity from him, shook his hand, and looked at the crowd, and said, "Aren't we having a great time here tonight?"
 
I've taken on my own party. I've disagreed with President Biden, on reducing tariffs, on solar panels, coming in from China, on relaxation of Title 42, at the border, the student loan issue. I've taken on former Democratic administration, on trade, on Fasttrack.
 
TAPPER: Right.
 
RYAN: And I've agreed with Trump on issues.
 
TAPPER: Yes.
 
RYAN: Like, I'm here for Ohio. And if people want an Ohioan, in the Senate, they can help fuel this campaign. I'm not a big-money guy. But they can go to timforoh.com, and chip in a few bucks, to help fuel this campaign.
 
TAPPER: But is there -- do you regret any votes? You've voted 100 percent of the time with Nancy Pelosi. You're saying, no, you don't regret anything?
 
RYAN: Well, what I'm saying is I get -- let me just say this, Jake. Running against House leadership is a very, very difficult thing. So, the question is, do you have the courage to take on your own party? Yes, I have. And I've got, as I said, got the scars to prove it.
 
But I will say, when you are in the majority, you work issues, into the bills that you're going to vote on, so that your members can vote for it. 
 
I got the Buy American Provision, in the Infrastructure bill, so that we're going to be buying American steel, American Concrete, instead of Chinese steel, to build these bridges. I got that in that bill, so I voted for it. The CHIPS Act, I was very instrumental in helping that bill pass. So yes, of course, I'm going to vote for it. The Inflation Reduction Act?
 
TAPPER: Yes.
 
RYAN: I wanted the natural gas stuff that was in there. We wanted the electric vehicle stuff that was in there. I wanted the $300 billion in deficit reduction in the Inflation Reduction Act.
 
TAPPER: OK.
 
RYAN: So, I help get those in the bills, and then you vote for them. So, the bill's not going to come to the floor, unless guys, like me have what we want, the priorities for Ohio, in the bill.
 
TAPPER: So, just lastly, we're running out of time, but J.D. Vance, your opponent's getting a lot of financial backing, from the Republican Senate Leadership Fund, other national Republican and conservative groups. 
 
You have complained publicly that you're not getting the same kind of help, from the Democrats. Why not? Do you think they just don't think you can win?
 <br>[21:55:00]
 
RYAN: Let me be clear. I'm not complaining at all. I built this campaign, 18 months ago, to go without the Democratic Senate committee, because there -- they often have not helped, in places, like Ohio. 
 
And I just take issue with the fact, like some of these consultants are saying, "You got to put money into States that have a higher number of people with college degrees." I think that's absolutely ridiculous. That goes against everything that Democratic Party stands for.
 
And what I'm trying to say is we got working-class people. We need to start respecting people, who don't have a college degree. We need to start investing into communities with people, who don't have a college degree. 
 
To just say, "Oh, we're going to go play in this state because, there's more people with a college degree," I think, is complete BS. And I wholly reject it. And I'm going to fight the party, the Democratic Party, from going down the road, where you need a -- you need a college degree, as a passport, to get into the party. We got to start focusing on working-class people.
 
And we're going to win this thing. We're getting fueled by 350,000 low-dollar donors. J.D. Vance has two donors. He has Peter Thiel, gave him $15 million, and Mitch McConnell, who's given him $40 million--
 
TAPPER: Yes. RYAN: --from the corporations, who shipped our jobs, overseas.
 
I want people, to help us, with this campaign. Go to timforoh.com. We're going to absolutely shock the world. And we're going to get the Democratic Party back, where it needs to be.
 
TAPPER: OK.
 
RYAN: And that's with the focus, on working people, whether they're White, or Black, or Brown, or men, or women. That's where the focus of the party needs to be.
 
TAPPER: Ohio Democratic congressman, Tim Ryan, thank you so much, for your time. Really appreciate it. 
 
We'll be right back.
 
RYAN: Thanks.
