(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN HOST, "FIRST MOVE":  It's 6:00 a.m. in Taipei, 8:00 a.m. in Sydney, and 6:00 p.m. here in New York. I'm Julia Chatterley. And 
 
 wherever you are in the world, this is your "First Move."
 
And a warm welcome once more to "First Move," and here's today's need to know. Network nightmare. Governments, hospitals, and airlines in reboot 
 
 mode after a software update crashes computer systems around the world, some travelers left facing the so-called blue screen of death.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I was online, I couldn't find my flight. I was like, did I do something wrong, you know? But apparently, when I got here, I 
 
 don't know if it's a cyber thing or what, but I'm just waiting like everyone else.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHATTERLEY:  President's pledge. Joe Biden returning to the campaign trail next week, despite 32 now Democratic lawmakers calling for his exit from 
 
 the race.
 
And Paris prepares. How the French capital is counting down to the Olympic Games. That conversation and plenty more coming up.
 
But first, the computer software meltdown heard and felt around the world. Industries critical to the global economy. We're talking airlines, 
 
 retailers, factories, and government agencies attempting to get their computer systems back online after a cyber security update went horribly 
 
 wrong, even some of the huge billboards in New York's Times Square went dark. It might end up, in fact, being the largest I.T. outage in history. 
 
 It's also a reminder of how quickly a digitized global economy can literally come unstuck.
 
The airline industry particularly hard hit with thousands of flights either cancelled or delayed around the world. This time lapse may video showing 
 
 the dip in U.S. air traffic during a 10-hour period Friday morning as thousands of planes were grounded. The tech community has been quick to 
 
 allay fears that the computer outages were caused by a cyber-attack, however, and that a fix is in place, but it's little comfort though to the 
 
 millions of people disrupted by this enormous tech failure. Jason Carroll has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JASON CARROLL, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  It was the blue screen that had customers from critical industries worldwide seeing 
 
 red.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I'm so upset right now. There are eight people in my party. Eight people.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There's 13 in ours.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  $456 a ticket, and they're giving me a hundred dollars back. That is it. And we're screwed. This man is getting married.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Anxiety. When I walked in, I got straight anxiety with all these people. Because I was online, I couldn't find my flight. I 
 
 was like, did I do something wrong?
 
CARROLL (voice-over):  Anger at airports in the U.S., Canada, Asia, and Europe as major carriers struggled to deal with the fallout of what had 
 
 happened.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It's been really wild. It's crazy. It's crowded. People cursing, yelling.
 
CARROLL (voice-over):  Confusion at banks as some financial systems were impacted overseas, disruptions at United Kingdom's National Health System, 
 
 and others around the world, as well as broadcast networks.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  And a major global I.T. Outage is impacting many of the world's largest companies, including us here at Sky News.
 
CARROLL (voice-over):  All due to that massive global technical outage linked to CrowdStrike, a cyber security provider. The company's CEO 
 
 apologized for the incident, saying it was not a cyber-attack. Instead, he says a defect in a software update CrowdStrike was doing crashed Microsoft 
 
 Windows, causing the outage. He also says a fix has been deployed.
 
GEORGE KURTZ, PRESIDENT AND CEO, CROWDSTRIKE:  We've been on, you know, with our customers all night and working with them. Many of the customers 
 
 are rebooting the system and it's coming up and it would be operational because of -- you know, we fixed it on our end.
 
CARROLL (voice-over):  The Department of Homeland Security is working with CrowdStrike and Microsoft to fully assess and address system outages. 
 
 Meanwhile, 911 services taking a hit in jurisdictions across the country, impacting states such as Alaska and Arizona.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHATTERLEY:  And Jason Carroll is at Newark Airport in New Jersey for us. Jason, you told a great story there of simply how many sectors were 
 
 impacted by this in different ways. How are things looking there at least at this moment?
 
CARROLL (on camera):  Well, the short answer is not very good. I mean, just within the past hour or so, we've been talking and listening to people who 
 
 are still experiencing delays and cancellations. And, Julia, as you heard from the piece there, it's not just the airline industry, the hospital 
 
 industry in the United States, many hospitals all over the country have had to either delay or cancel surgeries.
 <br>[18:05:00]
 
In addition to that, you've got businesses such as UPS and Federal Express that are saying expect delays on their end as well. As for CrowdStrike, 
 
 their CEO says it's going to be a lengthy process before things actually start to get back to normal. So, as bad as things are here right now, looks 
 
 like a lot of folks are going to have to simply wait it out until all of this can be sorted out. Julia.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes. And that could take some time. Jason Carroll at Newark Airport for us there. Thank you for that.
 
Now, the global I.T. crash is shining an unwanted spotlight on the tech firm CrowdStrike. In addition to Microsoft, it provides cyber security 
 
 services to many of the Fortune 500 companies. CrowdStrike shares tumbled 11 percent on fears about how the outage will affect its business, and 
 
 Microsoft shares fell some three quarters of a percent. Experts warning that it will take time for affected businesses to fully recover from the 
 
 crash, and that the fix will be costly, complicating matters, the need for manual reboots to computer systems.
 
And joining us now, Bryan Palma, the CEO of Microsoft. Cyber security firm Trellix. Actually, we're having trouble getting through to him. OK. We will 
 
 get him as soon as we can. For now, we will move on and establish connection back with him when we can.
 
For now. 32, that's the number of democratic lawmakers now calling for President Joe Biden to exit the race. Multiple leading Democrats tell CNN 
 
 they feel caught in what one described as a doom loop, with every move to keep President Biden in or push him out, further destroying their chances 
 
 against Donald Trump.
 
In a statement released earlier, the president said he's looking forward to getting back on the campaign trial -- trail as he continues to recover from 
 
 COVID. Let's get more now with MJ Lee. The president suggesting -- at least in the campaign, suggesting he's going to be back on the campaign trail, 
 
 MJ, next week.
 
Oh, unfortunately, we don't have MJ either. Wow. Well, at least I can tell you that this isn't down to the global I.T. outage that we've seen around 
 
 the world, but we do seem to be having a few difficulties here.
 
Oh, and I'm pleased to say Bryan Palma of Trellix is back with us. Bryan, you've literally saved us. Welcome to the show.
 
BRYAN PALMA, CEO, TRELLIX:  Hi, Julia. How are you?
 
CHATTERLEY:  No words.
 
PALMA:  Good to see you. Always have a backup plan, Julia. Redundancy is important. So, I was prepared.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Apparently. The backup to the backup to the backup failed there, but now, my friend, you join us.
 
PALMA:  That's right. That's right.
 
CHATTERLEY:  What do you make of this scale of the outage that we've seen today? And what are you hearing from customers?
 
PALMA:  Yes, I think the first thing is, you know, we stand together with CrowdStrike. So, what's really important about the security industry is 
 
 we're there to protect our customers. And I think in moments like this, it's really important that we don't forget who the bad guys are.
 
So, Trellix support, we've been fielding calls from customers. We've been trying to help wherever we can to get those customers back up and running. 
 
 I think that's the first thing. Because like you said, it's a significant event. Very, very costly, very serious problem. Many industries impacted, 
 
 critical infrastructure industries, and we're just working to help those customers get back and be protected.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Can you just explain what some of the challenges are that they're facing? Because the -- it seems that it was a very simple software 
 
 patch that CrowdStrike was trying to achieve here, and they're a cyber security firm, that impacted Microsoft systems, which are prolific around 
 
 the world. And I think that points to this. What are some of the basic challenges that the customers are facing and simply getting their computer 
 
 systems back up and running?
 
PALMA:  Yes, the issue is that the fix is relatively simple. You know, you have to boot your computer in safe mode and then you have to obviously go 
 
 in and delete the file that was corrupt, the bad file, and then you go ahead and reboot.
 
The issue is when you have to deal with that at scale. So, if you were doing that at your computer, you could run through it maybe with a little 
 
 bit of help and get it done very quickly. Many of these customers have hundreds of thousands and millions of devices out there, and all of those 
 
 devices have been what's called the blue screen of death, they've been rendered not functional. So, you've got to go out there and get this update 
 
 out to all of them. You've got to get hands on keyboards and that's very, very challenging and something that's going to take time. This won't be 
 
 over, unfortunately, in 24 to 48 hours.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Wow. I mean, you've got differences in size of the companies here that are impacted as well. I mean, if you're a big company, chances 
 
 are you have an internal I.T. system. If people are working from home, it's a problem if you have to physically get your hands on the hardware in order 
 
 to fix this problem. But if you're a smaller company, you don't have that. I mean, the challenges of here, depending on the size of the business, are 
 
 vast.
 
PALMA:  That's right. Yes, there's different challenges between the companies that are at scale and the companies that are smaller. And you hit 
 
 it right on, Julia, it's the difference between the expertise to be able to take the action and then just the sheer scale of what you're going to have 
 
 to go do and how serious this was that these computers are not -- they're not functional, they're not talking to anything, which makes it that much 
 
 more difficult.
 <br>[18:10:00]
 
CHATTERLEY:  I mean, you're a competitor to CrowdStrike, and I think no one wants to benefit from the misfortune of others. But is there a lesson here 
 
 perhaps in some diversification in terms of who's providing cyber security protections? Because Microsoft, prolific, most people probably not going to 
 
 be able to change from their operating systems, but perhaps diversification in the security systems and who's providing these perhaps should be 
 
 considered at this moment.
 
PALMA:  That's right, Julia, and some of the basic concepts around security are defense in depth. Making sure you have defense at many different 
 
 places. Redundancy. We joked about it with me getting on. I actually couldn't get on my laptop and I got on my phone. Redundancy is built into 
 
 what security firms do.
 
And when the customers are thinking about this, having a heterogeneous security environment helps you as well. This is something I've talked about 
 
 a lot. It's something we've seen a concern raised here in the U.S. federal government with the dependency, as you mentioned on Microsoft, and it's 
 
 really important that this lesson is around that, around the importance of redundancy and heterogeneous systems.
 
CHATTERLEY:  I think the other thing that worries me about this and for those people that might be watching this and are considering now whether 
 
 actually the best form of action, at least in the short-term, is to not automatically do the software updates in case something like this happens. 
 
 What's your advice to people about, perhaps ahead of time, putting some form of protections in, and do people tend to spend more or less on cyber 
 
 security after an event like this? Because it wasn't a cyber-attack, but arguably a cyber-attack would have the same impact. And as we've seen, it's 
 
 global.
 
PALMA:  Yes, that's right. It's a very good question. Look, people have to do those updates because that's how you're getting the latest content out 
 
 there. I think it's very important that the security doing that in a way that obviously doesn't cause this type of outage. So, there's going to be 
 
 work there and there'll be obviously people looking into this to see how they'll be able to do that better.
 
But you've got to get the latest content to protect you, as I said in the beginning, against the bad guys. That -- that's really who's out there. And 
 
 by the way, they're going to take advantage of this too. Our advanced research center team is already seeing fake websites domains that are 
 
 purporting to be giving CrowdStrike support, phishing e-mails that say, click here and we'll help you. They're already up and running. So, the bad 
 
 guys take advantage of this stuff very quickly. And I would just caution all of your viewers to make sure they're being very smart about what they 
 
 click on and they're going through the proper channels if they do need remediation.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes. News you can use. That is great advice. Bryan, thank you so much for that, and thank you for having a backup to the backup, even if 
 
 we didn't.
 
PALMA:  Thank you, Julia. Great to be here with you today.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Likewise, sir. Thank you. All right. We're going to take a break here on "First Move." Coming up, a lethal Houthi rebel drone strike 
 
 on Tel Aviv, but the U.S. secretary of state saying he sees movement on a Gaza ceasefire deal.
 
Plus, sentencing day for Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, an American citizen imprisoned in Russia. A full report, next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:15:00]
 
CHATTERLEY:  Welcome back to "First Move." And TGIF to all our viewers in the U.S., U.K., and across Latin America. And a good Saturday morning if 
 
 you're waking up with us across Asia.
 
The global I.T. meltdown causing investors to frown this Friday. The U.S. closing out the worst week on Wall Street since April. Firms like UPS and 
 
 FedEx saying their operations will be affected by the tech outage, along with major U.S. carriers like Delta and American, as we've already 
 
 discussed.
 
The NASDAQ underperforming this week, too, as investors sold tech stocks and bought cheaper, smaller stocks that will benefit from expected rate 
 
 cuts. Chip stocks also struggled, and that didn't help amid fears of new U.S. curbs on sales to China. The former president also saying Taiwan 
 
 should pay the U.S. for its defense.
 
And Friday's session was softened for Japan ahead of the Bank of Japan meeting next week. China, however resilient in the face of those global 
 
 tech issues. Few domestic Chinese firms reported any tech problems and few use CrowdStrike. Interesting contrast. Many in the country believe what 
 
 happened across the globe justifies China developing its own operating systems beyond Microsoft. One word, the splinternet.
 
All right. To other stories now, to Israel, where 10 people hurt in a drone strike on Tel Aviv have been released from hospital. One person lost their 
 
 life in the attack, which was launched by Houthi rebels in Yemen.
 
Meanwhile, the U.S. secretary of state says he believes Israel and Hamas are very close to a ceasefire agreement. Jeremy Diamond has the story.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Secretary of State Antony Blinken offering a very optimistic assessment of the hostage and ceasefire 
 
 negotiations, saying that he believes that we're "inside the 10-yard line and driving toward the goal line in terms of getting an agreement."
 
He noted the fact that Hamas has effectively agreed to a framework proposal, the one President Biden laid out in a speech several weeks ago. 
 
 We know that for the last couple of weeks, it does appear that Israel and Hamas effectively have a framework agreement to try and build out a final 
 
 deal for a ceasefire here. But over the course of those last two weeks, we've seen officials shuttling between Doha, Qatar, and Cairo, Egypt, 
 
 without actually a clear sense of how close they are actually getting to a deal. So, very notable to hear the secretary state now offering this 
 
 assessment.
 
At the same time, he did note that he doesn't want to be "naive," saying that sometimes it is those last 10 yards that are often the hardest. The 
 
 secretary of state and President Biden may have an opportunity next week to convince the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to get across 
 
 those final 10 yards as the Israeli prime minister is set to travel to Washington this weekend for a series of meetings, including with President 
 
 Biden, as well as an address to a joint meeting of Congress.
 
Now, as all of this is happening, the International Court of Justice issuing a very significant ruling, a non-binding ruling, but one that is 
 
 unprecedented in its kind as it relates to this situation. The International Court of Justice ruling that Israel's presence in the West 
 
 Bank and East Jerusalem is illegal. They offer that in an advisory opinion that stems from a request by the U.N. General Assembly in 2022 to assess 
 
 the legality and the consequences of Israel's ongoing occupation of Palestinian territories captured in the 1967 war.
 
The International Court of Justice ruling on this separate from its ongoing case regarding South Africa's allegations that Israel is committing 
 
 genocide in Gaza. But even this ruling from the International Court of Justice, an advisory ruling that is not legally binding, receiving harsh 
 
 recriminations in Israel. The Israeli prime minister saying that the Jewish people are not conquerors in their own land. Saying that no false decision 
 
 in the Hague will distort what he calls a historical truth.
 
Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Tel Aviv.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 <br>[18:20:00]
 
CHATTERLEY:  Thanks to Jeremy there. Now, human rights and press freedom groups are condemning a Russian court for sentencing a Wall Street Journal 
 
 reporter on Friday to 16 years in prison. The court found Evan Gershkovich, an American citizen, guilty of spying. But Russia's never offered any 
 
 public evidence of its claims.
 
The deputy director of the Human Rights Watch Europe and Central Asia Division calls the Russian proceedings a "disgrace and a farce." And he 
 
 calls the sentence monstrous. Amnesty International said in a statement on X that espionage charges are dubious and followed a "secret trial in an 
 
 abusive criminal justice system." It went on to say that Russia persecutes dissident, treats journalism and free speech as a crime. This conviction 
 
 must be overturned. Matthew Chance has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CORRESPONDEN (voice-over):  Ahead of the verdict in the Russian courthouse, cameras jostled for a glimpse of the U.S. journalist in 
 
 his glass cage.
 
After finding him guilty of espionage, the judge asked Evan Gershkovich if he had any questions about the 16-year prison sentence he'd been handed. 
 
 Looking thin and tired, the Wall Street Journal reporter answered no. The critics say his guilty verdict was inevitable and underlines how 
 
 politicized Russia's judicial system has become.
 
A strongly worded statement from Gershkovich's employers called it a disgraceful and sham conviction that comes after his 478 days in prison, 
 
 wrongfully detained, and away from his family.
 
CHANCE:  You can see Evan Gershkovich is in there. Hi, Matthew from CNN. Are you holding up alright?
 
CHANCE (voice-over):  It's been a saga which has seen Evan Gershkovich, now 32, make several tightly controlled court appearances since being detained 
 
 and accused of gathering secret information a Russian tank factory for the CIA. Allegations denied by Gershkovich and the U.S. government.
 
There are other U.S. citizens held in Russia --
 
PAUL WHELAN, AMERICAN, PRISONER IN RUSSIA:  I am innocent of any --
 
CHANCE (voice-over):  -- like Paul Whelan, a former Marine, sentenced in 2020 to 16 years for spying and also designated by Washington as wrongly 
 
 detained.
 
Dual citizens Ksenia Karelina, an amateur ballerina from L.A., and journalist Alsu Kurmasheva are also in custody. As are Gordon Black, a 
 
 staff sergeant in the U.S. Army, and U.S. school teacher Marc Fogel. Critics suspect the Kremlin has been collecting U.S. citizens as bargaining 
 
 chips for a future deal. But even now, that deal could still be months, or perhaps years, away.
 
Matthew Chance, CNN, London.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHATTERLEY:  More "First Move" after this. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:25:00]
 
CHATTERLEY:  Welcome back. 33, that's the number now of Democratic lawmakers calling for President Joe Biden to exit the 2024 race. The latest 
 
 just moments ago is Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio. He's up for re-election in November, and he's now the fourth senator.
 
Multiple leading Democrats tell CNN they feel caught in what one described as a doom loop with every move to keep President Biden in or push him out, 
 
 further destroying their chances against Donald Trump. In a statement released earlier, the president said he's looking forward to getting back 
 
 on the campaign trail as he continues to recover from COVID.
 
Joining us now is Bradley Tusk. He's a venture capitalist and former Democratic strategist who worked on campaigns for Chuck Schumer, Michael 
 
 Bloomberg, and Andrew Yang. Bradley, always great to have you on the show.
 
You know what it's like to wrestle with some pretty big egos. First and foremost, if a campaign is saying, look, he's going to be back on the trail 
 
 next week, would you expect them to do that, even if they were unsure whether or not he was going to step down? It doesn't sound like retreat is 
 
 on the cards.
 
BRADLEY TUSK, CEO, TUSK VENTURES:  No, but you also wouldn't say that you were going to retreat until it actually happens, because I think, given 
 
 that they don't know for sure what Biden's going to do, they've got to proceed as if the campaign is ongoing. So, you know, until literally the 
 
 minute that he announced his withdrawal, they will act like the campaign is at full steam.
 
CHATTERLEY:  You wrote an op-ed saying that, look, he's a career politician. He doesn't care, actually, what's in the best interest of the 
 
 nation. He thinks he does, but he's a politician, and therefore, he'll prioritize his own interests, first and foremost.
 
TUSK:  Yes.
 
CHATTERLEY:  And if they want him to leave, they have to incentivize him. Bradley, just talk us through that, because that's a punchy comment to make 
 
 about President Biden.
 
TUSK:  Yes. I mean, you know, as I've -- and it's not that he is any particularly better or worse than any of the other politicians, but that's 
 
 how they are. The people who run for office, in my experience, desperately need validation. They desperately need affirmation. They're desperately 
 
 insecure, and holding office fills a hole in their psyche, and they're not going to give it up unless they absolutely have to.
 
So, the question is, what's in it for Biden if he were to step away? And there are a few things. Like the first is, he can pardon his kid Hunter. As 
 
 a candidate for office, it is very hard to do something like that because it speaks to so much favoritism and nepotism and everything else that you 
 
 wouldn't want to do it as a candidate because it would hurt you with the voters. But if you're no longer a candidate, it doesn't really matter. He 
 
 can go ahead and do it the next day if he wants. So, that's the first.
 
The second is legacy. So, Lyndon Johnson made a similar decision to step down in March of 1968. And even though Richard Nixon ended up winning that 
 
 election, no one blames LBJ for Nixon, right? And LBJ's legacy is partly Vietnam and partly that he stepped down, but it's also the Civil Rights Act 
 
 and the Voting Rights Act and Medicare and Medicaid and a lot of things that he did that were very impressive.
 
You know, Biden is at a point right now where, you know, continue with this campaign means that likely his entire legacy will simply be he was the guy 
 
 too selfish to step aside and he allowed Donald Trump to return to the presidency as a result. Whereas, if you were to step aside now, he can 
 
 still salvage some of it, and he has meaningful accomplishments in office as president and he was vice president, he was senator, and he could still 
 
 salvage that but only if he makes the right move and steps aside.
 
And the third is that even if he stays in and somehow wins, which seems very tough at this point, but even if he does, winning is losing. The 
 
 entire next term he's going to go from ages 82 to 86. He's going to be on literal death watch. The media all day, every day is going to be sort of 
 
 monitoring his mental condition. There will be calls for the 25th Amendment to be invoked in the cabinet and Congress to remove him from office. It 
 
 will be virtually impossible for him to govern. And it's not -- these problems aren't going to go away just because he wins the election. So, 
 
 there's really no upside in staying in.
 <br>[18:30:00]
 
CHATTERLEY:  And what if he still says no, Bradley? How do you force someone, whether they like it or not? Because -- 
 
TUSK:  I mean, the only way you could -- 
 
CHATTERLEY:  Go on.
 
TUSK:  Yes. I mean, it's tough, right? So, the only way you could do it is that you'd have to get the delegates who are pledged to him to say, that in 
 
 good conscience, we simply can't vote for him. And it's really, we simply can't vote for him because we don't think he has the medical capacity to do 
 
 the job. I don't think you can say, we can't vote for him because we don't think he'll win, right?
 
But, you know, given his age and given his health issues, it is reasonable to say that you don't think that he is, you know, fully mentally up to the 
 
 task. But look, that's never happened before. It would take, you know, all of the delegates, many of whom have been, you know, known Biden for years 
 
 or decades to all abandon him. It would be very hard to do.
 
So, if Biden refuses to leave, odds are he will be the nominee. And I think that the way he might be thinking about it, if you try to put himself in 
 
 his shoes, is he's not going to go out on someone else's terms. He's a career politician. He understands that sometimes you run elections and 
 
 lose. I think he can live with that. But the notion that other Democrats, who he thinks haven't been his allies over the years anyway, can force him 
 
 into something, I think is calling to him. And if he does stay in, it's because he has decided that no matter what the cost is to him and his 
 
 legacy and anything else, he is staying in the race and he will leave on his own terms and nothing else.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes, I think the most convincing part of that for me actually was your point about winning being losing. And actually, nothing will 
 
 change over the next four years, and he'll be literally in some way handicapped in many respects, making policy decisions because people are 
 
 waiting for the worst, literally the worst.
 
Can I ask you? I want to get your tech sector hat now and donor wisdom and experience. What do you see happening in the tech sector? We've got J. D. 
 
 Vance, who Donald Trump has chosen his vice president option or pick, who we know is backed by someone very prolific in the venture capital industry, 
 
 Peter Thiel. We've also had Elon Musk come out and offering an enormous strange amount of money, it seems, to back a Super PAC for Donald Trump, 
 
 maybe you could explain that, I can't.
 
And what do you see happening specifically in the tech sector? Is it just more vested interest sort of similar to politicians in a way, these guys 
 
 know what they're doing?
 
TUSK:  I think it's a few things. I mean, the first is, you know, the people who are coming out strongly for Trump have always been conservative, 
 
 right? Peter Thiel has always been a conservative. He supported Trump in 2016, spoke at the convention in 2016. Elon Musk has always been pretty 
 
 conservative, especially in the last couple of years. So, one is that's who they are.
 
Two is they're trying to get out ahead of this because if you think Trump's going to win and you have investments in companies or own companies that 
 
 are highly reliant on government contracts or government regulation, you want the president to like you, right? SpaceX, Starlink, Tesla, you know, 
 
 these are all countries -- these are all companies that rely on government contracts, government incentives, government tax credits. X relies on the 
 
 federal government, not repealing Section 230, which is essential to the platform's economic survival. So, you know, it makes sense for them to say, 
 
 strategically for our companies and our investments, this is the best path.
 
And then, finally, you know, venture capitalists are human beings. Some people might think that we're not, but we actually are. And, you know, 
 
 human beings look at their own sort of recent experience and use that to decide how to vote. It's not Biden's fault, but there's basically been 
 
 almost no venture liquidity since Biden has taken office, very few IPOs in the venture world, very little M&amp;A. And so, you know, people blame him for 
 
 that.
 
And under Trump -- and I don't know that Trump had anything to do with it, but nonetheless, under Trump, there was a lot of liquidity, a lot of exits, 
 
 lots of IPOs, lots of M&amp;A. So, it was under one president, people were making a lot of money, on the next president, they're making no money. And 
 
 so, they do what people do and say, when was I better off? And the answer for them is not Biden.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Do the business community believe that now? Even if they're not saying it, Bradley, they're actually Trump will be a next --Trump 
 
 administration will be far better simply because, as you said, it's been a pretty rough patch over the last four years? And is there any concern, 
 
 perhaps it's mitigated by the fact that Trump's sort of pulling away in the polls now of the chaos, quite frankly, that we went through last time with 
 
 the disagreement over who actually won? I mean, is that all forgotten now? And perhaps is it easier that leading the polls?
 
TUSK:  I mean -- I think people, you know, really, really like to back the winner. So -- to a certain extent. But I think fundamentally -- 
 
CHATTERLEY:  The actual winner .
 
TUSK:  -- if you were trying to make a -- yes, yes. The actual -- right. From a business case, you know, what you would weigh is Trump is a 
 
 Republican and someone who has spent his career in business and therefore is likely to be for lower taxes and less regulation and things that 
 
 business tends to like. But you have to weigh that against the utter chaos of a Trump presidency, and markets require stability. They require knowing 
 
 that the government is functional and competent and rational and sane, and you don't have any of those things under Trump.
 <br>[18:35:00]
 
And so, what you've got to compare is the value of his policies compared to Biden's versus the value of stability versus chaos. And the part of the 
 
 reason why I think Biden's having a hard time is his stability argument is a lot weaker when it looks like he is just too old for the job and mentally 
 
 not up to the task. If he were younger or if he were in better shape mentally right now, he could really make that contrast with Trump around 
 
 stability and chaos. But that's harder for him because it's hard to have confidence in him these days either.
 
CHATTERLEY:  It kind of feels like we're picking poisons here at the moment. I'm trying to look for the optimism in this.
 
TUSK:  Yes. (INAUDIBLE) OK. You know, the third-party option isn't any better.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes. OK. What did you -- very quickly, what did you make of the former president's speech by the way?
 
TUSK:  You know, it's funny. It was almost two speeches, right? The first part of it was him sticking to a strategy of let's try to show unity, let's 
 
 try to show that I will not be as chaotic as I was before and people can relax and feel, you know, assured in voting for me. And he stopped that for 
 
 a while. The telling of the shooting was obviously compelling. But then, because he just refused to get off the stage, he kind of wandered back into 
 
 his old tendencies and habits of grievances and kind of random asides and things that didn't really make sense.
 
And what that did say is he's still Donald Trump, right? And that means he is still generally unpopular with the public overall, even if he's very 
 
 popular with his base, and he is still a massive wild card at all times. And so, if you had a different Democratic nominee, especially maybe someone 
 
 like a Gretchen Whitmer, that becomes a competitive race again.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes. He's still Donald Trump, and for Biden winning is losing. So, something's got to give.
 
TUSK:  Yes.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Bradley, great to get your insights.
 
TUSK:  Yes.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Thank you.
 
TUSK:  Julia, thanks for having me on.
 
CHATTERLEY:  As always. Great to have you. Thank you. Now, as Bradley was just saying, there's clearly lots at stake for American voters this 
 
 election season. In the swing states of Wisconsin, Gary Tuchman spoke with some of the country's most sought after voters to get their take on Donald 
 
 Trump's speech at the RNC. Just take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
GARY TUCHMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  But what I want to ask you all first at this point, all 13 of you, what you thought of the speech. Not a yes or no 
 
 answer if you thought it was good or not good. I want you to give a letter grade to it like you're in school. So, I'm going to start here with you. 
 
 What letter grade do you give that speech?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  B.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  C.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  B.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  C.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  D.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  B.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  A.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  C.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  B.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  B.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  C.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  A.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  B.
 
TUCHMAN:  So, B and C seem to be the most prevalent grades. I'm going to start with you, Kevin and Dawn, married couple right here. You are both 
 
 still undecided about who you will vote for. Tell me what the most important thing you thought about when you watched the speech.
 
KEVIN, WISCONSIN VOTER:  I was listening to his tone of voice, to his way of speaking and encouraging us and bringing unity to the country and those 
 
 individuals that might be outside of the Republican Party.
 
TUCHMAN:  And what grade did you give it, again?
 
KEVIN:  B.
 
TUCHMAN:  Dawn, what grade did you give it again?
 
DAWN, WISCONSIN VOTER:  I gave it a C.
 
TUCHMAN:  And what did you think of the speech?
 
DAWN:  I thought the beginning was really good. I was looking for unity, speaking outside of the Republican Party. And I thought I heard we a lot 
 
 and not so much about himself.
 
TUCHMAN:  Kevin, you're supporting Donald Trump. You've already said that. You gave the grade of?
 
KEVIN 2:  B.
 
TUCHMAN:  And what did you think of the speech?
 
KEVIN 2:  I thought it was too long. I think it started off slow, but as it progressed, I believe it got a lot better.
 
TUCHMAN:  Lena (ph), you gave what grade?
 
LENA (PH), WISCONSIN VOTER:  C.
 
TUCHMAN:  A C. And Lena (ph) and Rich are also married right here.
 
LENA (PH):  Yes.
 
TUCHMAN:  Why did you give it a C?
 
LENA (PH):  Because his rhetoric hasn't changed about the election, 2020 election. And I'm really concerned that we're going to have another issue, 
 
 depending on who wins. So, you know, I'm just really praying that, if Trump wins, that the guardrails of democracy will hold.
 
TUCHMAN:  Rich, what grade did you give it?
 
RICH, WISCONSIN VOTER:  So, I gave the speech a D.
 
TUCHMAN:  Tell me why.
 
RICH:  It started out great. But then he went into mistruths and grievances and attacks, and it just totally contradicted itself in terms of what he 
 
 wanted to achieve with unity.
 
TUCHMAN:  The Wisconsinites we talk with are well aware of how critical their state will be in this upcoming presidential election.
 
And while they had their disagreements, they do agree that it's good to have your vote mean so much.
 
Gary Tuchman, CNN, Waukesha, Wisconsin.

CHATTERLEY:  Our thanks to Gary there. OK. Coming up on "First Move," investigators are exploring whether the would-be assassin of the former 
 
 president was actually plotting some kind of mass shooting. We'll have the latest, next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:40:00]
 
CHATTERLEY:  Welcome back to "First Move" with a look at more of the international headlines this hour. A passenger train derailment in northern 
 
 India has killed three people and injured 32 others. It happened Thursday in Uttar Pradesh. India's ministry of railways has ordered an 
 
 investigation. Compensation payments of $12,000 have been announced for the families of the victims.
 
Protests in Bangladesh have erupted into deadly violence as police clash with demonstrators. Dozens of people have reportedly lost their lives this 
 
 week, with hundreds more hurt. The demonstrations were sparked by students demanding an end to civil service job quotas, which they say are 
 
 discrimination. Our Sophia Saifi has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SOPHIA SAIFI, CNN PRODUCER (voice-over):  Violence as protester and deadly in the Bangladeshi capital of Dhaka. Students armed with sticks and rocks 
 
 clashed with armed police and ruling party supporters after widespread anger erupted across the country.
 
We came here in the morning, soon after that, police and members of the charter league started to attack us, protester Ali said, referring to the 
 
 ruling party student wing. 
 
Two students have been shot in front of me.
 
Plumes of black smoke spilled over an overpass bridge in Dhaka on Wednesday as tensions boiled over. But Thursday marked the bloodiest day yet, with 
 
 scores skilled and hundreds injured. A judicial investigation is underway.
 <br>[18:45:00]
 
Students began taking to the streets earlier this month. Their demands relating to civil service job quotas, they say are discriminatory. Favoring 
 
 the prime minister's ruling party, creating a two-tier country where a politically connected elite benefit by their birth, receiving job security 
 
 and higher pay. And anger is rising over high unemployment.
 
Now, accusations of police and ruling party supporters' brutality are rising. Police say protesters attacked them, leaving dozens injured and 
 
 that officers retaliated. 100 policemen were injured in the clashes Thursday.
 
We want justice for our brothers kills, said 18-year-old protester Bidisha (ph).
 
Amid the chaos, a moment of prayer for those killed. Symbolic coffins were laid out in the street Thursday. A near total internet blackout now in 
 
 place in the capital. A ban on public rallies also ordered for Friday after government buildings were torched.
 
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has called on protesters to await a Supreme Court verdict on the scrapping of the quotas.
 
The demonstrations, a serious challenge to her power, the student demands as yet unmet.
 
Sophia Saifi, CNN, Islamabad.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHATTERLEY:  And Donald Trump's would-be assassins searched online for information about explosives and the arrest of a mass shooter before his 
 
 attempt on the former president's life. Those details were shared by the FBI and Secret Service during a briefing with lawmakers. Investigators are 
 
 now exploring whether the gunman was plotting a mass shooting at the Trump rally.
 
Zachary Cohen is in Washington. Zachary, what more do we know about their investigations? And it's starting to help us build a picture, perhaps, of 
 
 what the motivation behind this may have been.
 
ZACHARY COHEN, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTER:  Yes, that's right. Investigators are trying to piece together the evidence that they have in 
 
 the shooter's cell phone and that they're getting from the shooter's other devices and its search history to try to understand who this individual was 
 
 and what potentially could compelled them to open fire at Donald Trump's rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday.
 
But so far, we're told that investigators have not yet established a motive, and they can't even decide, based on the evidence that they've 
 
 reviewed so far, whether or not the shooter had any sort of political ideology that might have motivated the attack. They're really still combing 
 
 through the cell phone data and the search history on these cell phones. There was two of them recovered from the various scenes here.
 
And the search results are equally as confusing. We're told that the search results do include searches for information about Donald Trump, about 
 
 Donald Trump's rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday, as well as other rallies that Donald Trump has announced that he will be holding in the future. But 
 
 the search results also included searches for information about the Democratic National Convention, which -- including the date, the time, the 
 
 location of that and also information about a variety of other political figures across the various spectrum and across the various parties.
 
So, really no clear indication that the attack on Donald Trump, based on this evidence that has been collected so far, was politically motivated per 
 
 se. And there's an emerging theory amongst law enforcement, sources that we're talking to, that potentially the shooter was motivated more so by the 
 
 desire to carry out a mass casualty attack and the Trump event really presented the most convenient option for doing so. It was the closest 
 
 political event to his house in Pennsylvania. The timing of it was the most -- was the closest to the search dates of these various political events.
 
There's also other search results that are raising questions as well. We're learning that the shooter also looked up Ethan Crumbley. You might remember 
 
 Ethan Crumbley. He was the school shooter who killed four of his classmates in Michigan in 2021. That is something that officials note is sort of 
 
 historically, you know, consistent across a lot of people that have committed mass murders and mass shootings in the past. This tendency to 
 
 research other shooters and draw inspiration from that.
 
So, really early days in this investigation still. But investigators are trying to find out answers for why this was carried out and also how to 
 
 prevent it in the future. We're seeing U.S. Secret Service ramping up security ahead of Donald Trump's coming rally in Michigan this weekend. 
 
 We're learning that part of the reason for that is recent assessments since the shooting on Saturday that are concerns about copycat or imitators 
 
 potentially trying to carry out something similar in future rallies as well. So, we'll have to see how the Secret Service implements these 
 
 changes. But really, a lot more questions than answers at this stage.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes, certainly, but it is all important to try and build some kind of profile of what this man was thinking and who and what he is and 
 
 what might have driven him to this moment. We're also going to hear, aren't we, from the Secret Service director next week as well. So, that will be 
 
 instructive, we hope, too. Zach, for now, great to have you with us. Thank you. Zach Cohen.
 <br>[18:50:00]
 
All right. This just in, too. We're just learning about a phone call between Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The 
 
 former president described it as a "very good call." In a post on social Trump says Zelenskyy congratulated him for becoming the Republican nominee, 
 
 and he condemned the assassination attempt last Saturday.
 
The call, of course, would mark their first conversation since Trump left the White House and comes amid concerns in Europe about what Trump's policy 
 
 towards Ukraine would be if Trump were to win the presidential election in November.
 
OK. Coming up for us, Olympic organizers in Paris also hit by the global computer outage. Ahead on the show, the glitch it created ahead of the 
 
 opening ceremony. All the details next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHATTERLEY:  Welcome back. Friday's global I.T. outage is a reminder of how quickly a digitally connected world can suddenly become unstuck. Among the 
 
 entities affected with the Paris Olympics. Now, just a week away for a time, organizers were unable to give accreditations to some of the arriving 
 
 athletes and officials. Our Patrick Snell has more.
 
Accreditations is one thing. At least the ticket sales, I believe, were unaffected. Just if you're thinking about the money.
 
PATRICK SNELL, CNN WORLD SPORT:  Julia, just imagine, though, you know, as a journalist who has covered so many major sporting events over the years, 
 
 you can't go anywhere without your accreditation at these events.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes.
 
SNELL:  So, just spare a thought for the athletes as well, who've been arriving in their droves in the hearts of the French capital. And this less 
 
 than a week away now from the opening ceremony ahead of the 2024 summer games, a day of -- no other way of putting it, Julia, just a day of 
 
 disruption in the French capital amid that global outage.
 
At one point, the outage seeing the accreditation distribution centers suspending, shutting down for a matter of hours before, thankfully, later 
 
 in the day, as it was indicated, everything was thankfully resolved. So, that's certainly much relief, I would imagine, to the athletes and the team 
 
 officials, all the traveling parties in question.
 
Now, in terms of actual competition, there's no question, the excitement really has been ramping up. The first athletes now arriving in the Olympic 
 
 Village. The Olympic Village studio always attracts a lot of attention, and for so many different reasons. This time around, Paris '24 officials saying 
 
 they are looking, they are hoping, they are aiming to make these games the most responsible and sustainable games in history.
 
The Village contains 82 buildings plans. Afterwards, they're planning to convert the whole area into office space for thousands of workers and 
 
 apartments as well for people to live in, to house another several thousand people as well, around the 6,000-mark in total. The site for the Olympic 
 
 village chosen in the hopes that he would actually revitalize, regenerate some of the capital's historically impoverished northern suburbs. And I 
 
 think that's really important in terms of legacy.
 <br>[18:55:00]
 
And of course, then the big, big day on Friday of next week, history in the making with around 300,000 people expected to gather on the banks of the 
 
 River Seine for the opening ceremony featuring a parade of around 10,000 plus athletes who will have arrived on site there in Paris. No Olympics 
 
 ever has staged an opening ceremony quite like this one.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TONY ESTANGUET, PRESIDENT, PARIS 204 OLYMPICS:  We want to open wide the games and we believe that doing it in the center of Paris with 100,000 of 
 
 people. And also, it's, again, a great combination of -- with the creativity of the artistic team to celebrate people of Paris in this 
 
 regard. So, you will see that at the end. It's about people. It's about artistic. It's about sports.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
SNELL:  And, Julia, first day of competition in Paris is actually before the opening ceremony. It's going to be on Wednesday. Rugby sevens and 
 
 football taking center stage. Then we got the opening ceremony that we just heard about on the 26th of July. The games continuing until August the 
 
 11th. The eyes of the world will be on Paris and we are looking forward to it immensely. We'll be following all the top storylines our team on the 
 
 ground there as well in the French capital.
 
CHATTERLEY:  I cannot wait. I'm wondering if the open ceremony has all sorts of drone activity and stuff. Thank goodness this outage didn't happen 
 
 in a week's time. Yes. Patrick, great to have you with us. Thank you. Looking forward to it.
 
And that just about wraps up the show. Thank you for joining us. Have a wonderful weekend. We'll see you next week.
