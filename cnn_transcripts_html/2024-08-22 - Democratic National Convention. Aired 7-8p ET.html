SEN. ALEX PADILLA (D-CA):  But I was proud to carry on legislation that she championed to protect workers, to safeguard public lands, to provide kids with more access to quality education. 
 
You see, Kamala and I believe that all of our kids deserve a shot at the American dream. It's the American dream after all that brought my parents to the United States decades ago. 
 
(SPEAKING HISPANIC LANGUAGE)
 
PADILLA:  But today, we know that the dream is out of reach for far too many families. So my question for all of you tonight is this. This November, who is ready to defend the dream?
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
(SPEAKING HISPANIC LANGUAGE)
 
PADILLA:  Tim Walz is ready to defend the dream. Kamala Harris will defend the dream. Between now and Election Day each of us must work to defend the dream, too, by working to elect them as vice president and president of the United States of America. 
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
PADILLA:  So I want to thank you. May God bless you. Now, lets go win this thing. 
 
(MUSIC)
 
ERIN BURNETT, CNN HOST:  All right. If you're just joining us, we are live in Chicago. The final night of the Democratic National Convention is underway. What happens in this arena tonight is pivotal for Kamala Harris and her presidential campaign. Delegates, the American people, they will all have a chance to hear the vice president speak at length tonight on a national stage for the first time since her meteoric rise to the top of the ticket literally just one month ago. 
 
And we are coming to you tonight from inside the convention hall on this special edition of OUTFRONT. We are told the vice president, when she speaks soon, will be sharing the story of her upbringing, a middle-class upbringing, talking about her parents and her sister, talking about that background, fueling her decision to become a prosecutor. And they campaign official tells us she will also lay out what she believes are the dangers posed by Donald Trump agenda if he wins. 
 
And now, as we are continuing to watch this program, let's listen to the honorable Marcia L. Fudge, former U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. 
 
MARCIA FUDGE, FORMER HUD SECRETARY:  Kamala Harris, Kamala Harris has fought to protect homeowners and renters her entire career. As attorney general, she held big banks accountable for their role in the foreclosure crisis, and won billions of dollars for California homeowners. As vice president, she and President Biden helped over 400,000 homeowners at the risk of foreclosure during the pandemic. And as president, she will build 3 million new homes and rentals, limit unfair rent increases, and offer down payment support for first-time homebuyers. 
 
It's personal. Kamala remembers her mothers pride at buying their first home after saving for 10 years. She knows housing is a human right, and a pathway to the middle class. Where you live determines what schools your children go to, what healthcare you receive, and whether you can get a good job without spending hours commuting. Where you live, too often, determines how you live. 
 
Donald Trump has no idea how housing works for everyday Americans. He doesn't care. He started his career being sued for denying housing to Black families. As president, he sat by while the cost of housing skyrocketed. 
 
Now, we can hand the keys to our housing policy back to a negligent landlord, or we can elect a president who believes in safe, affordable housing for all. 
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
FUDGE:  Let's ensure we have an opportunity by voting for Kamala Harris. 
 <br>[19:05:07]
 
Thank you. 
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
(MUSIC)
 
BURNETT:  Going to be speaking in just a moment as we continue to follow this program. 
 
On the floor, Kaitlan Collins, you're in the midst of obviously an energized and full room tonight. 
 
KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN CHIEF CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Erin, it is quite hectic here. It's more packed that we've ever seen. I'm standing in the California delegation with Honey Mahogany, a California delegate who was also, more importantly, from Vice President Harris's hometown of San Francisco. 
 
What do you want to see on that date from her tonight? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We're really excited to see her speak. We want her to bring us all together. We are so excited that our hometown girl could be president, will be president. 
 
COLLINS:  Clearly, your jacket shows that excitement, as is everyone here. The California delegation here, I can tell you, has been hyped all night. They have the prime time sitting right up front for this. 
 
BURNETT:  All right, Kaitlan.
 
And Ted Lieu, as we said now, representative from California, heavy representation from California tonight. Ted Lieu coming out, Kamala Harris's friend. 
 
Let's listen in to Congressman Lieu. 
 
REP. TED LIEU (D-CA):  As a computer science major, I am so impressed with how large this A.I.-generated crowd looks tonight. 
 
I first got to know Kamala Harris during the Great Recession, when I was a California state legislator. Millions of hard-working families were facing foreclosure. 
 
My constituents told me stories about predatory and unfair loan terms, and about how hard they work fighting to keep their homes that they loved. 
 
Thankfully, they had someone fighting just as hard for them, Attorney General Kamala Harris. She led an investigation of the mortgage industry to root out fraud. She helped pass the homeowners bill of rights. And she held the big banks accountable, bringing back $20 billion to homeowners. 
 
Since those days, I've seen her continue to fight for affordable housing as vice president, and as president, she's going to cut red tape so we can build more houses, help new homeowners afford a down payment, and take on corporations and unfairly high cop rent.
 
Kamala Harris fights for affordable housing because she gets it. You know, when her mom was raising two girls, she did what so many parents do, work early hours and work late nights, pay the bills and put on a brave face so her girls did not know how hard it really was. 
 
It shouldn't be this hard in America, and President Kamala Harris will make sure it's not. She'll fight to lower housing costs so that everyone, everywhere can find a place to call home. BURNETT:  Congressman Ted Lieu talking about Kamala Harris's
 
 background, which is an essential part of what they want to do tonight, and one of her essential goals in what we expect to be a more than hour-long speech where she's going to talk about her past and contrast with the future as she sees it with the future that Donald Trump wants to present. 
 
MJ Lee is learning more about what the vice president will be saying as we're following this program and getting ready to hear her speech. 
 
MJ, what are you learning? 
 
MJ LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Erin, the vice president has been basking in everything that we have seen in Chicago this week, and, as you know, joy has been a theme of her campaign, and the convention in Chicago this week. 
 
But I am told that if she has been really buoyed by this burst of energy and enthusiasm that we have seen, she says she ascended to the top of the ticket, there is another word that describes her mood right now, and that is serious. I asked the senior adviser to the vice president what her frame of mind has been heading into this big night tonight, and he said it is both excitement and seriousness, and that, really, few people, obviously, understand the gravity of accepting a party's presidential nomination, and she knows that when this party is over, she needs to run a race and win a race -- Erin. 
 
BURNETT:  MJ, thank you very much. 
 
And now lets listen to the program, Senator Tammy Baldwin from Wisconsin. 
 
SEN. TAMMY BALDWIN (D-WI):  Tonight, I want to talk about family. We know that all families don't look alike. My mother was a teenager when I was born, and she struggled with addiction. I never met my father. 
 
But I had two incredible grandparents who stepped in and raised me, David and Doris Green. 
 <br>[19:10:02]
 
Everything I know, I learned from them. In every way a child needs, my grandparents were there for me. And as they grew older, it was my privilege to be there for them. 
 
So when I work to protect Medicare and Social Security, I do it with a personal knowledge of what those big programs meant in small, but deeply meaningful ways to my grandparents. And I know what they mean for your parents and grandparents. 
 
But let's be clear. That is all at risk today. Donald Trump was asked what he would do about Social Security and Medicare, and he said, and I quote, there's a lot you can do in terms of cutting. 
 
Cutting? He's talking about cutting Social Security and Medicare, while giving a huge new tax break to billionaires and corporations? Well, Kamala Harris is not going to let that happen. And Tim Walz is
 
 not going to let that happen. We are not going to let that happen. 
 
You know, they've got it backwards. We Democrats, we honor our elders, and ask the wealthiest to pay their fair share. 
 
Wisconsin states motto is forward, and, my friends, that's where were headed!
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
BURNETT:  Senator Tammy Baldwin from Wisconsin. As we are building up here to the main event of the evening, the speech by Kamala Harris.
 
Coming up, we're going to take a very brief break, and we will be back. Senator Elizabeth Warren speaking in just moments as well, with our special coverage here live from Chicago. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[19:16:00]
 
REP. JOE NEGUSE (D-CO):  Don't let anyone -- don't let anyone tell you that the American dream is dead. It is alive and well, and it will grow even stronger with Kamala Harris as the next president of the United States. 
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
NEGUSE:  How, how do we know that? How do I know that? Well, it's because Kamala Harris believes that college can be a ticket to the middle class, and she has fought to make it more affordable her entire career. As California attorney general, she took down one of the biggest for-profit colleges, securing $1 billion, $1 billion for students who were defrauded. 
 
Alongside President Biden, she expanded Pell grants and secured record funding for HBCUs. And Kamala Harris made public service loan relief a reality for teachers and first responders and firefighters and nurses, and countless others across our land. 
 
Vice President Harris delivered before, and she will do it again. As president, she will build a brighter future, a more affordable future, a future where going to college doesn't break the bank. A future where my five-year-old daughter, Natalie, who's watching us back home in Colorado right now, a future where she can live her dreams. 
 
So those are the stakes. Let's make it happen, America. Let's make history, America. Let's elect Kamala Harris, the 47th president of the United States. 
 
Thanks so much. God bless. Thank you. (CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
BURNETT:  Joe Neguse, representative from Colorado. We are hearing from some of the rising stars, and John, plenty of California, obviously. Neguse is Colorado, but we have heard California colleagues trying to introduce her. The video to introduce her, she is all building into the speech. 
 
JOHN KING, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Look, she is the main event. She is number one, two, three, and four tonight in terms of what matters in the campaign. It'll be interesting to watch as the Republicans try to put her left and say she's a San Francisco liberal out of the mainstream, do they try to take -- you know, these -- people from California, they're her friends. They're the people who know her best. 
 
So, of course, they are best prepared to fill in her biography. I worked with her for years. I watched her do this. So it makes perfect sense for her to fill in the biography, it is also an opening for Republicans to say California Democrat, out of the mainstream of the country. 
 
That's what Trump -- that's what the Trump campaign says its going to try to do. Trump himself has been very uneven, because he focuses more on, you know, is she Indian or is she black, or a coup against Joe Biden. He's lost away from how the campaign would like you to present the case. 
 
That's one of the things that are going to try to do. They're going to try to put her left, and California gives them an opportunity, because much of the country does think California is this, you know, utopia out west. 
 
BURNETT:  Gavin Newsom is not on the speaker list, even though he is here. 
 
JAMIE GANGEL, CNN SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT:  We have seen this week the next generation, the deep bench, turning the page. We have actually seen, I think, 20+ young Democrats, senators, governors, that the party wants to point to, notably Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, has not been among them. 
 
But, to John's point, when they started tonight, there was a quick intro video that they had of Kamala Harris. The first word on that video, with all the pictures, it's like a big campaign ad, right, is "trust". And then we know about joy, we know about hope, we know about strong. 
 
They are introducing her once again tonight, but I think we should not forget that what's going to happen is in the next 75 days of what this campaign looks like, what the debate looks like, how she handles questions. 
 
But its, they are doing quite a job. There's an expression, building an airplane while flying. 
 <br>[19:20:03]
 
Four weeks ago, this was a completely different convention. There, you know -- but well --  
 
BURNETT:  One thing, one thing, we have not heard Joe Biden's name yet tonight. Not yet. 
 
ASHLEY ALLISON, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  Well, he had a speech. He is going to pay tribute to him. This night is about Kamala Harris. The, the torch has been passed. 
 
To Jamie's point, four weeks, there's been at least 40 videos that have played, and the night is just beginning. The performers, just everything that has been curated in this short amount of time. But they're also doing something else. 
 
Yes, we're on network television. They have creator down there introducing John Legend last night who have millions of followers. They need to get this excitement, how the country that the Democratic Party is unified, we're moving in the right direction. 
 
And these tens of thousands of people are going to disperse to all 50 states, talk to their neighbors, talk to their friends, and help her win this election. 
 
This, tonight, is about Democrats. He will say, though, Adam Kinzinger, talk to independents, Oprah talked to independents last night. There are other Republicans. 
 
The DNC and Minyon Moore, the chair, they understood the assignment for tonight, and they're delivering.
 
DAVID URBAN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  I would just say, though, so what -- 
 
ALLISON:  Can't even talk, it's so loud. 
 
URBAN:  The one person who tried to bury, Randi Weingarten from AFT, right?
 
BURNETT:  Yeah, she spoke, hold on. 
 
URBAN:  Let me tell you, because of this. Study buddy, education week, right? The harbor school closures and last a lifetime new research shows. There are plenty of parents in this arena watching at home all over America but remember, during the pandemic, the Randi Weingarten and the teachers union kept kids home, wanted to keep kids home forever, and that's permanently affected. 
 
And you know will suffered a lot? Kids at the lower end of the socioeconomic spectrum suffered the greatest. So I'm surprised that they're honoring her, but they're kind of burying her. She represented big union --  
 
BURNETT:  But not a prime time slot. Let's put it that way. 
 
URBAN:  I promise you, we're going to see and hear about that topic more as we move forward. 
 
BURNETT:  All right. We'll hit pause for just a moment, because we have more tonight coming from the final night of the DNC. You hear the energy. You hear the dancing, can barely talk over it. That is the feeling this room. 
 
We are closing in on the main event, as John King just that. Main event number one, two, three, and four, all of it is Kamala Harris formally accepting her party my denomination, coming up here as we cover it all live from Chicago. We'll be back. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[19:26:18]
 
WOLF BLITZER, CNN HOST:  This is Kamala Harris's night here at the Democratic national convention in Chicago as she prepares to deliver the speech of a lifetime, accepting her barrier breaking presidential nomination. 
 
We're going to go back to CNN's Sara Sidner. She's here in the convention hall. 
 
Tell us about the outfits, Sara, that some delegates are now wearing. 
 
SARA SIDNER, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  I shall. I am here with the state of Washington, and Ashley Potvin (ph). Now, everyone here, you'll notice, has a fantastic sparkling cowboy hat, but it is particularly for cowboy Kamala , which, I am assuming, as to do with cowboy Carter? Is there some hope that, ma'am, the president of all things music and fashion and style, i.e., Beyonce, is going to show up? Queen Bey? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You know what, I hope show. If she doesn't, I have no doubt that her heart and her supportive here to begin with. You know, were all here for her, were all here for president, or vice president Harris. If she shows up, great, but, I mean, let's face it. Kamala is the star of the show today. 
 
SIDNER:  Kamala is the star of the show. This is a political, Democratic national convention. Can I ask you about the cat? Because I'm assuming this is a little something to do with something J.D. Vance has said. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It does, it does. This is Gina. This is on behalf of all the childless cat ladies and cat gentlemen who feel like they don't have value. I want you to know that you are sparkly, you are fabulous, and we Democrats love and support you. 
 
SIDNER:  You are also a nurse. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I am. 
 
SIDNER:  You had to deal with 2020, and what happened to this country. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I did. 
 
SIDNER:  What is it like being in a room where, four years ago, this would've been a super spreader event, right? I mean, you're here now, no mask. What has that been like for you as a healthcare professional? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It's been incredibly freeing. I feel that we are incredibly blessed to have the art of finance and vaccinations, and also those who don't wish to get a vaccination have the ability for masks. It's about freedom of choice. 
 
This needs the world, to know that you can take care that, well, the government is taking care of us. And it feels really good to breathe air and see everyone smiling faces. 
 
SIDNER:  Seeing their full face. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Seeing their full face. 
 
SIDNER:  Ashley, thank you to you and your kitty, and all of your friends from Washington state. 
 
Wolf? 
 
BLITZER:  All right, here is the Democratic senator from Pennsylvania, Bob Casey who is going to be speaking. Let's listen in. 
 
SEN. BOB CASEY (D-PA):  Here's a real -- here's a real question. Moms asked me in Pennsylvania. What am I -- what am I supposed to do if I can't afford diapers? In just six months, a box of diapers went up $15. The corporations say your prices are up only because their costs are up. 
 
They're selling you a lie. It's in the bag with the diapers. Prices are up because these corporations are scheming to drive them up. 
 
Most companies are good companies. It's the food conglomerates that sit behind the supermarkets, the faceless wholesalers. They're the ones who are extorting families at the checkout counter. 
 
This is greed-flation. I've been fighting a long time. So has Kamala Harris. And finally, were starting to win. When big pharma jacked up the costs of insulin, we passed a bill to stop them. 
 <br>[19:30:04]
 
Now, for millions of Americans, its capped to $35 a month. So that's one. I've been fighting to ban price gouging on food. And next year, when she's president, Kamala Harris will sign a bill to do just that. So that's another. 
 
And when corporations take advantage of a crisis, like toilet paper during the pandemic, we'll hit them with harsher fines when Kamala Harris is president. Now, Americans don't expect stuff to be free. But we do expect it to
 
 be fair. The people I'm talking to from Allentown to Erie, they don't tolerate being ripped off. 
 
Americans are hard-working, honest people. And that's what we've been fighting for. We're fighting for honesty. 
 
I'm fighting for it. Kamala Harris is fighting for it. Will you fight for it? 
 
CROWD:  Yes!
 
CASEY:  All right. Let's go out and win this thing. Thank you. 
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
ANNOUNCER:  Please welcome, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. 
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
(MUSIC PLAYS)
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA):  You know what I love best about Kamala Harris? Kamala Harris can't be bought, and she can't be bossed around. 
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
WARREN:  Now, I first met, let in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crash. The banks had flat out broken laws, cheated people, and stolen homes. Millions of Americans had lost their jobs, their savings, their homes. 
 
Now, I was setting up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Go CFPB! 
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
WARREN:  Yeah! 
 
Kamala was protecting families as California's attorney general. You bet. And Donald was scamming students at Trump university, and trying to make money off people losing their homes. 
 
Kamala Harris stepped up. She enforced the law. She fought the giant banks. And she delivered billions of dollars of health for families. 
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
WARREN:  And that is the difference between a criminal and a prosecutor. 
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
WARREN:  You know what else I love about Kamala? She gets it. We need to make life more affordable for working people. 
 
Yeah. 
 
Donald Trump, the felon, has no plans to lower costs for families. He doesn't know how. And basically, he doesn't really care. When did he ever fill up a gas tank, or worry about a grocery bill? The only bills he worries about are from his criminal defense lawyers. 
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 <br>[19:35:01]
 
WARREN:  But Kamala, she cares deep down, and she will take on the giant corporations that are squeezing American families. In fact, it's something she's done before. During the California wildfires, she went after the price gougers. 
 
During the pandemic, we work together in the Senate to stop price gouging. And as president, she will lower costs for your family. 
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
WARREN:  She'll take on the Wall Street firms that buy up millions of houses and apartments, and then jack up the rent. She'll take on drug companies that charge an arm and a leg for prescriptions. She'll take on corporate monopolies that rip off consumers and billionaires who don't pay taxes. 
 
And she'll take on right wing extremists who think they should decide who has access to abortion or IVF. Kamala will protect abortion rights nationwide. 
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
WARREN:  Yeah. And there it is. Groceries, gas, housing, healthcare, taxes, abortion. Trust Donald Trump and J.D. Vance to look out for your family? Shoot, I would let those guys, I wouldn't trust them to move my couch. We need Kamala Harris. 
 
This election is about your family and your future. I've seen Kamala Harris fight. I've seen her win. And when it comes to our families and our futures, Kamala Harris is someone we can trust. 
 
So here it is. With joy in our hearts, let's elect Kamala Harris, the next president of the United States! 
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
BURNETT:  This rousing applause, and so far, I mean, standing ovation, she couldn't start on time, Ashley. And then she was crying. There were tears in her eyes. She was incredibly moved. So far, tonight, that is the speech that has moved this room. 
 
ALLISON:  I mean, she's not even a sitting -- a former president. She's a senator. But she has fought for the working people. She goes to work. 
 
The crowd is electric. The fourth night, night after night after night, people are excited. People are here to win. She knows Kamala Harris very, very well. 
 
But Elizabeth Warren deserves that rousing cheer. She has done so much for working people, and so much for this party. 
 
BURNETT:  And it was a genuine moment. She had us moved to tears there. 
 
All right. We're going to take a very brief break here as we continue to keep this program live for you. So much more ahead for you here at the DNC in Chicago, and Kamala Harris's big speech coming up here, quick break. 
 
We'll be back on CNN. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[19:42:24]
 
REP. JASON CROW (D-CO):  Come from our people, from our allies. Donald Trump's Project 2025 would abandon our troops, abandon our veterans, our allies, and our principles. 
 
In chapter 4, Trump plans to do Putin's bidding by abandoning Ukraine, and walking away from our NATO allies. 
 
In chapters 2 and 3, he plans to fire our national security and military professionals, and then replace them with MAGA loyalist. But I refuse to let Trumps golf buddies decide when and how our friends are sent to war. 
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
CROW:  When we join the military, we raise our right hand, and we take the oath. We know that it comes with sacrifice, but we also know that it comes with a promise, that America will have our back. 
 
Trump will break that promise. In fact, in chapter 20 of Project 2025, he plans to slash veterans benefits, and then privatize V.A. healthcare. 
 
(BOOING)
 
CROW:  As a paratrooper, we learned that the leader of the unit jumps first. And then the others follow. Leaders always go first. 
 
But Trump -- Trump, he would push your son or daughter out of the plane and then abandon them when they come home. 
 
Our troops deserve a commander-in-chief who will always have their back. That leader is Kamala Harris. 
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
CROW:  And together, we will make Kamala Harris our next commander in chief!
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
BURNETT:  Representative Jason Crow of Colorado, former army ranger there, and obviously referencing project 2025, which Trump, of course, just to be clear on the facts, has disavowed any parts of, even though some of his former staffers have worked on that project. 
 <br>[19:45:07]
 
On the floor, though, the enthusiasm palpable. 
 
Kaitlan, what are you seeing where you are right now? 
 
COLLINS:  I mean, Erin, we were standing right here by the Massachusetts and the Ohio delegations, but it has really been a total party here in the floor. They've been DJ-ing in between the speakers, everyone is up dancing. The House Minority Whip Katherine Clark was dancing just a few moments ago. 
 
But also, this line right here, standing room only. That is how crowded it is here tonight. Some delegates can't even make it to their seats, but they're all here standing and watching, Erin. 
 
BURNETT:  The really good shot if you're not out here, you will not get to see the main event. 
 
As the program continues, Elissa Slotkin, representative from the state of Michigan. Let's listen in. 
 
REP. ELISSA SLOTKIN (D-MI):  Good evening. I'm Elissa Slotkin. I am honored to be your U.S. Senate nominee from the great state of Michigan. Go, blue! Go, green! From Michigan.
 
My life in service began in New York City on September 11th. As the smoke cleared, I knew my career would be spent protecting the country we all love. 
 
I was recruited by the CIA and served three tours in Iraq alongside our military. 
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
SLOTKIN:  And I worked at the White House under presidents of both parties, and as an acting assistant secretary of defense under President Obama. 
 
I want to talk tonight about national security, because the choice in November is stark. America retreating from the world, or leading the world. 
 
Trump wants to take us backwards. He admires dictators, a lot. He treats our friends as adversaries and our adversaries as friends. 
 
But our vision is based on our values. The values that took us to the shores of Normandy and helped us win the Cold War. We believe America should inspire and lead at home and abroad. We recognize that it's not just about having a strong military, but about tackling global challenges, like A.I. and climate change, together. 
 
And guess what? That takes friends. You got to have friends to do that. 
 
Vice President Harris understands our strength abroad is inextricably linked to our strength here at home. Our schools, a strong middle class, and the health of our democracy. 
 
So for everyone here and everyone watching, I want you to proudly claim your patriotism. You are here because you love your country. Do not give an inch to pretenders who wrap themselves in the flag, but spit in the face of freedoms it represents. 
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
SLOTKIN:  This November, lets elect a president who will lean forward to embrace the future because America doesn't follow. We do not retreat. We are the damn United States of America. We lead. 
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE) BURNETT:  Elissa Slotkin, rousing applause here, congresswoman from the state of Michigan. 
 
We take a brief break. Still ahead, so many speeches, Gretchen Whitmer, Mark Kelly, and the showstopper, the big speech by Kamala Harris, coming up later on tonight. And we will be right back. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[19:51:37]
 
BURNETT:  And you are with us in Chicago, live for the grand finale for the Democratic national convention here in Chicago, as we get ready for the main event here tonight, the marquee speech by the Vice President Kamala Harris coming up here in Chicago. 
 
And Jeff Zeleny is here with me in this convention center -- Jeff.
 
JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT:  Erin, I am on the podium here just to the side, and as I look across the United Center convention hall, it literally is a party tonight. I see cowboy hats that are lit over there. We see every delegate in this room standing and dancing between speeches. There's an interlude of music. 
 
There is going to be a lot of music tonight from the Chicks and Pink as well, perhaps a surprise guest, we shall see. But I was just outside this hall talking to a few delegates who say they cannot get in. The floor has been closed. That happened at every convention, slightly earlier tonight. You can see across the hall, this is a party for Kamala Harris. 
 
I am told when she arrives in the coming hours, she is going to absorb this energy, and then tell these Democrats to get to work for the next 75 days of this campaign -- Erin.
 
BURNETT:  And, Jeff, as you said, the doors already are shut. That floor is at capacity. The party feel, and already the emotion. You saw the tears on Elizabeth Warren's face, and the unbelievable roar when she came out there. I just only site that that was a moving moment, and yet it will be a -- it will pale in comparison to what we are going to see later on tonight. 
 
ZELENY:  It definitely will, no doubt. And this is so different that the convention the Democrats were sort of worrying about. This is a party for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. 
 
But, Erin, just a feel of exuberance and joy, partly because there haven't been party conventions for eight years. We talked to so many delegates here who have not been to a convention for that long, some have never been here. 
 
So this is not moment. This is that party, the pent up energy and enthusiasm, anticipation is on the floor tonight. As I look around, I see dancing in the California delegation. I see hands raised in the Pennsylvania delegation. This crowd is alive here with excitement for Vice President Harris -- Erin. BURNETT:  It certainly is.
 
And right now, let's continue to watch this program tonight. Al Sharpton, the Reverend Al Sharpton, obviously a stalwart of Democratic politics, now coming out to speak, along with the Central Park Five. 
 
Let's listen to Reverend Al Sharpton. 
 
REV. AL SHARPTON, FOUNDER &amp; PRESIDENT, NATIONAL ACTION NETWORK:  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. 
 
Good evening. I'll stand before you as the president of National Action Network. We do not endorse candidates, but we report where candidates stand on criminal justice, economic empowerment, health equity, and other issues. 
 
On one side of this race is Donald Trump, a fellow New Yorker I've known for 40 years. Only once, once in that time did he take a position on racial issues. He spent a small fortune on full-page ads calling for the execution of five innocent young teenagers. 
 
(BOOING)
 <br>[19:55:03]
 
SHARPTON:  Well, I'm going to bring them out in a minute, but, and you'll hear from them tonight because they were not executed. They're here to continue the fight. 
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
SHARPTON:  But it was there that I saw Trump love to san racial flames. 
 
On the other side is a woman that I've walked with in Selma, Alabama, to commemorate the 59th anniversary of Bloody Sunday.
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
SHARPTON:  Kamala Harris spoke to me that day about unity and passing bills. All I ever heard from Donald Trump was how he could get an advantage. 
 
I see one candidate who wants to protect the right to vote while the other has tried to cook up 11,000 votes in Georgia. 
 
I see a candidate who, with Joe Biden, brought leaders to the White House to confront violent hatred, running against a man who said neo- Nazis in Charlottesville were fine people. 
 
(BOOING) SHARPTON:  I see a candidate who has sought to reform and uphold the law, and a man who wrongly assumes his mug shot appeals to Black Americans. 
 
I worked with Kamala Harris. In every job she's had, she has consistently committed to making government work for those of us who've been disadvantaged. All Donald Trump has been consistent about is making himself richer, and sowing division to get that done. This man sat right here in Chicago a few weeks ago, refusing to apologize for claims that migrants were taking Black jobs. 
 
Well, in November, we're going to show him when Blacks do they job! 
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
SHARPTON:  And we are going to join with Whites and Browns and Asians, and we going to do a job on those that have done a job on us!
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
SHARPTON:  Tonight, we are going to realize Shirley Chisholm's dream. 
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
SHARPTON:  Fifty-two years ago, I was one of the youth directors in her campaign for president, and 52 years after she was told to sit down, I know she's watching us tonight as a Black woman stands up to accept the nomination for president of the United States. 
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
SHARPTON:  We have fought too hard for women to be told to get out of the kitchen. We are now on our way to the Oval Office. We won't go back!
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
SHARPTON:  We fought hard. We fought hard for LGBTQ loved ones to get out the closet. We won't go back!
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
SHARPTON:  We fought hard for the right to choose, the right to education. We suffered and died in blood with the jail to get the right to vote. We won't go back!
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
(CHANTING)
 
SHARPTON:  So we must be committed, no matter how the Supreme Court tries to roll back on civil rights, no matter what the amount of money they have, we are here because of those fought and suffered for us.</pre>
