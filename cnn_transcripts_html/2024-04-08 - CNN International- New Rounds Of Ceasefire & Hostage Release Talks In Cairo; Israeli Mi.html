THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
<br>[08:00:00]
 
AMARA WALKER, HOST, "CNN NEWSROOM": To our viewers all around the world, I'm Admiral Walker. This is CNN Newsroom. 
 
Just ahead, a glimmer of hope in the latest ceasefire and hostage talks, the U.S., Israel, Hamas and Qatar have been negotiating in Cairo since Sunday. And it's the final countdown, the total solar eclipse makes its way across North America today. Will the sky stay clear for you to see it? We will have the forecast. And ahead of a key meeting this week with President Biden, Japan's Prime Minister tells CNN, the world is at a historic turning point.
 
We begin with a new round of ceasefire and hostage release talks being held in Cairo six months into the Israel-Hamas war. Egyptian state media reports significant progress. This as the Israeli military says it has withdrawn its ground forces from the southern city of Khan Younis so that they can recuperate and prepare for future missions. Now, Israel leaves behind destruction as far as the eye can see. One Palestinian man who returned to Khan Younis says there is no hope for anyone ever living in the area again. 
 
CNN's Nic Robertson is joining us now live from Jerusalem. Hi, there, Nic. Let's start with the ceasefire talks underway in Cairo. Where do things stand?
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: It's not clear. There is a thought that says, because the IDF pulled out of Khan Younis, this perhaps changes the dynamic at the negotiating table. The sticking points, though, as we still understand, have been the hostages. How many Palestinian prisoners would Hamas -- would Israel release from jails for the hostages that Hamas would release? And then, Hamas' demands for a permanent ceasefire, a complete pullout of Israeli troops, and the return of people displaced to the south of Gaza return back to the north. These have been the sticking points. 
 
What we know at the moment is that the meetings went late into the night, Sunday night. CIA chief, Bill Burns, we understand, is headed back to Washington. The Egyptians are saying that they think that the talks could resume in a couple of days and they're creating an impression that there is a slight shift in the dynamic, but no details at the moment, which also in itself can be indicative that perhaps there is a sense, more optimism behind the scenes, because oftentimes if the two sides feel they've got nothing out of it, they walk away and say nothing has changed, the other side sticking. We're not hearing that right now. But, it's too soon to know, for sure.
 
WALKER: And Nic, what is your assessment? I mean, we were talking to you over the weekend about when this happened, when the IDF said it had withdrawn its ground forces from Khan Younis. Are you seeing that as a good faith move as a part of these talks, or is Israel potentially preparing for this ground invasion of Rafah that we've been hearing so much about?
 
ROBERTSON: It's quite possible to read it both ways and be correct. Absolutely, Prime Minister Netanyahu wants to put maximum pressure on Hamas. So, the threat that the IDF could go back into Rafah would be part of that picture. Absolutely, Prime Minister Netanyahu is under pressure from the United States not to go into Rafah because of the potential for the widespread deaths of civilians that could happen there. He recognizes what the military is facing on the ground, which is they haven't been able to stamp out Hamas much, while the Prime Minister says this is still possible to do it. 
 
In a way, in a negotiation, both sides are trying to get the maximum by leverage, and you can certainly take the pulling out of Khan Younis as something that may be presented by the Israeli side as a good faith gesture. But, the Prime Minister also faces pushback from his cabinet that -- from some members of his cabinet, if he doesn't go into Rafah, then he is going to lose political support, could force the country into elections, all sorts of pressures. So, I think the best way to read this is that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is trying to play the strongest hand that he has on every single front, pushing back international pressure, pushing back domestic pressure, and pushing for the release of the hostages. 
 <br>[08:05:00]
 
So, at this stage, it really could go either way. 
 
WALKER: And we are learning that a Hezbollah commander was killed in an overnight strike by the IDF. What are you learning about that, Nic? And obviously, the next question would be, again, these heightened concerns of an escalation, especially after the Israeli strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus that killed several IRGC figures.
 
ROBERTSON: The IDF is saying that this was a senior Hezbollah commander who had orchestrated attacks across the border from southern Lebanon into Israel. He is perhaps at a level of many of the other Hezbollah commanders who we've seen Israel target recently without forcing or without triggering Hezbollah into an escalation. The magnitude of what the United States says was Israel's strike on the consulate, the Iranian consulate in Damascus, and the death of a very senior, at least, one very, very senior IRGC commander in place, and Iran is giving the impression and certainly what I'm hearing from sources in the region is that Iran will make the response for what happened in Damascus, and it won't come from Hezbollah. 
 
So, this may not trigger a bigger confrontation with Hezbollah at the moment. It's certainly not going to dampen the current tit-for-tat strikes we're seeing in of itself. I don't think it's going to lead to an escalation. While the talks are going on in Cairo, if something can be achieved in Cairo with Hamas, then that opens the door for more effective U.S. diplomacy to tamp things down between Israel and Hezbollah. The dynamic is fluid. But, I don't think this particular strike on this particular Hezbollah commander triggers a massive escalation. I don't think that will happen. 
 
WALKER: Nic, well, always appreciate your perspective and your experience. Nic Robertson, thank you so much. 
 
Well, in just a few hours, North America will be treated to a spectacular show in the sky. Millions of people will be able to see the total solar eclipse across North America. 10 U.S. states will see the moon completely cover the Sun. In all 49 states, people will see at least a partial eclipse. It has been seven years since the last total eclipse was visible from the United States. The next won't be visible in the U.S. until 2044. So, the question is, who will have clear skies to view the eclipse, and where will the weather be a spoiler? That is the big question, right, because we don't want those clouds obscuring this once in a few decades experience, Allison. What do we know? 
 
ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Yeah, that's right. Look, there are going to be plenty of fantastic spots to be able to see the eclipse today. That includes Carbondale, Illinois; Cape Girardeau, Missouri; Evansville, Indiana, and also another really good spot, basically from Burlington, Vermont, all the way up through Caribou, Maine. 
 
But, there are going to be a couple of tricky spots where we're talking about an excessive amount of cloud cover, especially places like Erie, Pennsylvania, up through Rochester, New York, and really a good chunk of Texas and Arkansas. And the reason for that in that particular area is we also have the potential for some strong to severe thunderstorms. Now, the good news here is that those strong severe thunderstorms are expected after the eclipse is over. The concern, though, is all of those people that don't live where the eclipse is but maybe traveled there are going to have to travel home, and they may end up encountering some of those strong to severe thunderstorms as they do, and it could be dealing with large to very large hail. We're talking tennis balls, possibly even larger, some damaging winds, and yes, even the potential for some tornadoes.
 
You'll take a look, some of those showers and thunderstorms already developing, say three, four o'clock this afternoon, but many of them continue into the evening. So, as people are headed west or even east, they may encounter some of those stronger storms after the eclipse is over. Now, with that said, there is still going to be some very nice places and some places that will remain dry. Dallas is going to be dry. But, you're going to see an increase in that cloud cover as we go through the afternoon out ahead of those storms. 
 
But, a place like Indianapolis, Indiana, that's going to be different. They have most of their clouds this morning. So, if you are there hoping to see it, don't panic if you wake up this morning and you see a bunch of clouds, because a lot of them are actually going to decrease as we go through the day today and especially into the afternoon hours. 
 
Now, Niagara Falls, New York, different story. You are looking at least 70 percent to 80 percent cloud cover for most of the day today. But, a place like Burlington, Vermont, not too far away, you're looking at about 20 percent cloud cover at absolute highest. So, a very nice spot to be able to go out there today. And you can see that cloud cover map here again. Here is some of those clearer spots right there along the path. So, we mentioned say Carbondale, Illinois, one of the spots. It's going to be very nice today, and they are a very interesting spot because they were also in the eclipse back in 2017. 
 <br>[08:10:00]
 
So, both spot -- both eclipses that have happened have hit that particular city. So, again, a very spot likely today in terms of weather. And again, a good other area is going to be up around Northern New Hampshire, portions of Maine as well as northern Vermont. 
 
Now, one thing to note too, Amara, which is always kind of interesting is that you will actually feel the temperature drop if you are in totality. And here you can see that, for both Carbondale and Indianapolis during totality because we are covering the Sun. It will actually drop the temperature back by a few degrees, but it will come right back and jump right back up as soon as the Sun comes back out again.
 
WALKER: I was reading about how a lot of animal experts are really curious to see how animals at zoos and at home react to this, right, the darkness and also the temperature change. So, that'll be interesting. I just love you, the fact that you're always dressed for the festivities, those earrings, your eclipse shirt.
 
CHINCHAR: In this case, I only get to wear this every few years now. 
 
WALKER: I know.
 
CHINCHAR: So, I have to take advantage. Yeah.
 
WALKER: Hopefully, you'll be able to wear it again in 20 or so years when the next one happens. Good to see you, Allison. Thanks so much. 
 
CHINCHAR: You too. 
 
WALKER: Well, we've got reporters stationed along the path of the eclipse. Of course, we do. Gustavo Valdes will be joining us from Mexico. But first, let's bring in Rosa Flores in Kerrville, Texas, Rosa, hi. It looks like you're ready for "Mardi Gras", but this is the eclipse. Tell me about those glasses.
 
ROSA FLORES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Amara, Kerrville is definitely ready for the eclipse. But, I'm still trying to figure out which eclipse glasses are actually real. There are so many out there. And this is where we do our public service announcement, because there are -- and you really need to protect your eyes if you're actually going to experience this celestial show. 
 
And here is one big takeaway. If you can put your finger through the glasses, they're not good. They're not the real ones. They need to meet the international standard. So, yes, these are the real ones. And right at the center of this third eye is very important information. You see that it says eclipse times two. Well, that's because Kerrville is actually a really special place to be for this eclipse. We have a map from NASA and I want you to look at this, because there is an x of two paths of totality. And right in the middle, that is Kerrville. So, there was an annual eclipse in October and then there is the eclipse that is happening today. And that's why people think that this particular spot is so special because it is going to experience two eclipses in a matter of six months. 
 
Now, I talked to the mayor of this town. She said that they're expecting about 100,000 people from all over the world. She is preparing. They're preparing for traffic contraflow to make sure that people can exit after maximum totality. But, I ask her about the weather? Because like you were just saying, a lot of people are concerned, are we going to see this thing or not? Well, she gave me a little secret. She says that she tapped into a supernatural power. Take a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JUDY EYCHNER, MAYOR OF KERRVILLE, TEXAS: Yes.
 
FLORES: One of the concerns, of course, is the weather. 
 
EYCHNER: Weather, well -- 
 
FLORES: Will it be clear? Will it not be clear? Will it rain? Will it not rain?
 
EYCHNER: I checked my magic ball this morning --
 
FLORES: Oh, fantastic.
 
EYCHNER: -- and it says no rain. And we're going to be able to see it. So --
 
FLORES: What else does that magic ball help you?
 
EYCHNER: I will have to look harder. So --
 
FLORES: Does it tell you the lottery numbers because if it does --
 
EYCHNER: Oh, no. 
 
FLORES: -- I want those too. 
 
EYCHNER: That's the secret. That I can't share. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FLORES: And Amara, I borrowed her crystal ball. I do see that there are clear skies, a very clear eclipse, lots of people cheering, lots of people experiencing the eclipse. And you know what, Amara? I can see the lottery numbers, but I'm going to keep those to myself. 
 
WALKER: Oh, come on. You cannot tease that and not tell us what those numbers are. I'm going to just say goodbye to you because I'm not happy about that. No, I can't. Quickly, have you been talking to the people in the area? Because it's -- I mean, we have been also excited about this event. You're in the path of totality. Well us what people are doing and how they're preparing for this.
 
FLORES: There is so much excitement here, especially in Kerrville. I'm going to take this off because this is silly. There is so much excitement, really. And people are desperate to find merchandise that is eclipse related, like the t-shirt that I have on. I got to give a shout out to my producer Sara Weisfeldt because she had to make this because they're running out of t-shirts. There are no t-shirts in town. And so, people are going out and about, desperate, late at night, trying to get this merchandise. 
 
And there is just this excitement and in part it's because of what I was sharing earlier. Like this is really a special place to be for this eclipse. Now, will it rain? Will it not rain? It's unclear. 
 <br>[08:15:00]
 
But, we also talked to this other business, that this is actually where we got the crystal ball, there is seen a lot of people from out of town and people from town go there and ask questions about, OK, are we going to experience this or not? And what they said, Amara, even if we don't see the eclipse because there is cloud cover, the energy is still going to be here. So, we're still going to feel something. That energy is going to be in and around all of us. We're still perhaps going to see some glow or not. I'm not sure. But, I'm positive that the clouds are going to part. It's going to be clear. It's going to be perfect, or at least that's what my crystal ball tells me. 
 
WALKER: Yeah. Yeah. Listen, your crystal ball says it. I believe it, and that shirt is pretty impressive by your producer, Sara, who made that. That's very nice. Good to see you, Rosa. We'll check back. And let's head over to Mexico where -- that's where our Gustavo is. And are there going to be huge crowds there as well? What are you hearing about how people are preparing?
 
GUSTAVO VALDES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Amara. Well, we are in, they call an urban forest in this metropolitan area. They're expecting 30,000 people, not just in this office space. But, you see, there are tree everywhere, and the Sun started to come out. You can see so far mostly clear skies. We are hoping for hoping for a clear day, so we can enjoy this eclipse. 
 
Another -- the reason people are coming to Torreon is not only because the eclipse is obviously going over, but NASA is utilizing two telescopes that are here permanently, and they are going to be following the eclipse. There are tens of scientists from all over the world. And we have seen tourists come from as far as England, Barcelona that have made the trip to see what happens here in Mexico. And what I'm hearing from most of them is, well, this is real Mexico. A lot of them say, well, we've been to Cancun. We've been to Cabo. Those are the tourist destinations. This is real Mexico. So, it's also giving people a chance to know other parts of the country. 
 
Also, science is going to be a big part of this event. You can hear, we were mentioning the animals. Here in this forest, it's a natural habitat for a lot of birds. You can hear them right now. And we have noticed over the morning, as the Sun has risen, how different birds have been making different sounds. And right now, they're actually more quiet than when we started about an hour ago. So, those are the kinds of things that scientists are going to be listening to starting out. So -- and people are going to be able to enjoy. 
 
The city is excited, not only the city, the whole country, Mexico is going to be the first country to experience the eclipse. It is going to start in Mazatlan, Mexico, right on the Pacific Coast. They run out of hotels. I was told a year ago they're expecting an extra half million people in that city. Here, they are expecting over 750,000 people to be in the different points. Torreon has a little hill where they have a statue of Christ, the second largest in the world after Rio de Janeiro. So, that's another destination. 
 
And farther north is, there is a desert, Desierto de Cuatrocienegas, where they expect that if they're lucky enough to have the total darkness, it is total darkness because there is no cities around. There is no artificial light. So, it's going to be a really nice show to watch before it gets into Texas.
 
WALKER: Gustavo, the ambient sounds there, where you are, is just fascinating to hear. And I'm curious to know what it's going to be like during that moment of totality, four minutes and 20 seconds of totality, where you are, how the animals will react, and if they'll get confused. Well, they think it's nighttime, and prepare for night. We will have to see. Gustavo Valdes, just fascinating stuff. Thank you so much. Good to see you there in Mexico. 
 
All right. Just ahead, and in-flight scare for Southwest Airlines passengers when the engine cover on one flight just walloped the wing flap. What the airline is saying? And ahead of his summit with the U.S. President, Japan's Prime Minister speaks with CNN.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[08:20:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
WALKER: The U.S. air safety watchdog is investigating after another scary moment on board, this time a Southwest Airlines Flight. An engine cover flew off of this Boeing and hit one of the plane's wing flaps. You can see parts of that blue piece there, just kind of flailing around in the wind. A passenger posted this video of the damage to social media. The crew made an emergency landing in Denver just shortly after taking off. No injuries were reported. And it is the latest in a string of mechanical and structural problems to occur with a Boeing aircraft operated by various airlines in recent months. Gabe Cohen is following the story from Washington, D.C. That's
 
 frightening, if I were sitting in that airplane, looking out the window. What are you hearing about what exactly happened, and what Southwest is saying, Gabe?
 
GABE COHEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Amara, that is under investigation right now what exactly happened here. But, the airline says that maintenance crews are already looking at the plane. They put out a statement yesterday, Southwest did, saying. "We apologize for the inconvenience of their delay", speaking about the passengers on that plane, "but place our highest priority on ultimate Safety for our Customers and Employees." 
 
And you can imagine, Amara, what those customers and employees who were onboard that plane were thinking is this terrifying scene was playing out Sunday morning as that plane was taking off from Denver. You can tell from that video that the passengers could actually see this cowling, this engine cover, rip off the aircraft and strike the wing flap as the plane was taking off. And yet, that plane did still take off and was up in the air, close to 10,000 feet up, for about 35 minutes flying before returning to Denver for that emergency landing. We do have some air traffic control audio between the pilot and folks on the ground. Take a listen to what was said.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Alright let's go ahead and declare an emergency for Southwest 3695. And we'd like an immediate return. We got a piece of the engine cowling hanging off apparently. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It was the right side. I am not hundred percent sure it was the engine. I think the flaps on the inboard side of the engine between the engine and the fuselage ripped off on takeoff. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Southwest 3695, copy that. Thank you.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The engines seem to be fine but we are structurally damaged.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COHEN: And we know that the FAA has now launched an investigation into the incident. And you mentioned, Amara, the issues that Boeing planes have had here in recent months, specifically maintenance issues. I do want to be clear. While this is a Boeing plane, this is not the MAX 9 that has been under the microscope and under scrutiny now for months. You'll recall that incident back in January when a door plug actually blew off in Alaska Airlines flight which led the FAA to temporarily ground the MAX 9 and ordered Boeing to address what they called systemic quality control issues. 
 
But, this is not the MAX 9. We are talking about the 737-800. It has been in use a lot longer than the MAX 9, in this case, close to nine years. It is a workhorse for a lot of major airlines. And we don't know in this case, Amara, if this was a Boeing problem, or perhaps it was a Southwest maintenance issue. That is something the FAA is still working out as they investigate what happened here.
 
WALKER: That's a good question to pose. But, of course, this is happening at a pretty tough time for Boeing, and Boeing seems to have been the common denominator on all of these airline incidents we've been seeing. 
 <br>[08:25:00]
 
Gabe Cohen, thank you so much. Good to see you. 
 
COHEN: Thank you. 
 
WALKER: Well, rising concern in the Middle East is a concern for Japan's Prime Minister ahead of a trip to Washington this week. Fumio Kishida is set to meet with President Joe Biden. And it's important to remember, Japan is moving away from decades of pacifism as conflicts around the globe flare up. 
 
CNN's Hanako Montgomery reports from Tokyo.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
HANAKO MONTGOMERY, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The world at a historic turning point, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida tells me ahead of a summit with U.S. President Joe Biden this week. The longtime partners will upgrade their defense relationship to the next level in the backdrop of mounting international security challenges.
 
FUMIO KISHIDA, JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER (Interpreted): In our neighborhood, there are countries that are developing ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons, and others that are building up their defense capabilities in an opaque way. Also, there is a unilateral attempt to change the status quo by force in both the East China Sea and South China Sea. 
 
MONTGOMERY (voice-over): Kishida says soaring geopolitical tensions forced Japan, long a pacifist country, to change its defense posture, moves not seen since World War Two. Under his leadership, Japan plans to boost its defense spending to two percent of its GDP by 2027, and purchase weapons, including U.S.-made Tomahawk cruise missiles, acquiring counterstrike capabilities for the first time in decades. 
 
MONTGOMERY: So, if Japan has a security pact with the United States, why does it need counterstrike capabilities? 
 
KISHIDA (Interpreted): Missile-related technology is evolving year by year. As missiles become more sophisticated, Japan must constantly consider what kind of technology is needed to protect the lives and livelihood of its citizens. 
 
MONTGOMERY: And you've asked for a summit with Kim Jong Un, but there seems to be some mixed messages coming from North Korea about its engagement with Japan. What is your current level of communication between your administration and North Korea? 
 
KISHIDA (Interpreted): We believe that resolving various concerns between Japan and North Korea and stabilizing relations is important not only for the interests of our two countries, but also for peace and stability in the region. For this reason, we believe that it is important to hold a summit meeting and under my supervision. I've been conducting high-level outreach to the DPRK. 
 
MONTGOMERY (voice-over): Following the U.S.-Japan summit, the two nations will convene with the Philippines, the first trilateral meeting of its kind to address rising security threats from North Korea weapons testing and aggression in the South China Sea.
 
KISHIDA (Interpreted): We are not targeting China specifically or a specific country. As Japan, we've been working to strengthen the Philippine's maritime enforcement capabilities. We're also providing them with defense-related equipment.
 
MONTGOMERY: You mentioned that it's not directed towards any one country. But, wouldn't you say that the Philippines is gravely concerned about China's actions in the South China Sea?
 
KISHIDA (Interpreted): It's true that there are some developments, as you pointed out. I think it's important for the Philippines to defend its sovereignty, to protect its own territory, territorial waters and airspace. I believe that these things are very important in maintaining and strengthening a free and open Indo-Pacific based on the rule of law.
 
KISHIDA (Interpreted): The U.S. and Japan, an enduring bond confronts its pivotal moment as a volatile world seeks to unravel their global sway. 
 
Hanako Montgomery, CNN, Tokyo.
 
(ENND VIDEOTAPE)
 
WALKER: All right. Still to come, the U.S. is on high alert and Israel's military has a warning for Iran. We will explain next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[08:30:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
WALKER: The Israeli military says it is ready to deal with Iran quote "offensively and defensively" after Tehran blamed Israel for a strike on its embassy compound in Syria last week, and that killed seven officials. The IDF's Chief of Staff says Israeli troops are, in his words, prepared and operating in the north south, the West Bank and beyond. In the U.S. Senate -- in the U.S., I should say, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer says Washington is prepared to respond swiftly, if necessary, against any attacks by Iran or its proxies. This comes with the Pentagon on high alert for what it says could be a significant attack by Iran. 
 
Let's bring in CNN's Alex Marquardt for more. Hi there, Alex. So, as you mentioned, the U.S. being on a high alert, what exactly does that mean in terms of its assets in the Middle East? And what's the expectation in terms of timing and how Iran could attack? 
 
ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, the U.S. has not specified what they expect in terms of retaliation by Iran. That's certainly something they're trying to figure out how, when, where a retaliation could take place. But, it is something that we're told they do expect imminently. It could be in the coming days. It could be against U.S. interest, or obviously countless American targets all across the Middle East. It could come against Israeli targets. 
 
Remember, administration and intelligence officials have said for months since this war began after the October 7 attacks, that Iran has no interest in getting involved directly. They're happy to have their proxies in Yemen, in Iraq, Syria, in Lebanon, to carry out strikes against U.S. and Israeli interest, but they themselves did not want to get involved directly and expand that war. That may be changing now, Amara, because of that Israeli strike that took place last week, very dramatically against the Iranian consulate in Damascus that killed senior level Revolutionary Guard commanders, seven IRGC officials that U.S. officials now believe Iran will retaliate for. 
 
The U.S. has made clear that they were not involved. They have said that this was Israel's attack, that the U.S. had no advanced knowledge and no participation. And the U.S. has warned Iran against retaliating against U.S. targets. But clearly, Amara, if Iran were to strike directly against Israeli and/or American targets, this could expand the conflict dramatically. Amara.
 
WALKER: And how do you take the warning from the IDF that it's ready to deal with Iran?
 
MARQUARDT: Well, certainly, that there is this potential for an escalation and for a widening conflict. You had the head of the IDF saying yesterday that they're ready to deal with Iran, offensively and defensively. And I think we need to be paying very close attention as well to Israel's northern border. You've had this low-level war going on between Hezbollah in Lebanon and Israel for the past six months, at the same time that the war has been going on in Gaza. U.S. officials have said in the same way they've spoken about Iran, that Hezbollah doesn't want to expand this conflict. 
 
But, Israel is now saying that they are ready to move from defense to offense against Hezbollah, that they are ready to attack. U.S. officials have been working to try to come up with some kind of diplomatic solution to push Hezbollah away from the southern border to create a buffer zone. But, Israel indicating here that they are ready to open up a second front in the northern part of their country against Hezbollah in Lebanon. Amara.
 <br>[08:35:00]
 
WALKER: All right. Alex Marquardt, appreciate your reporting. Thank you. 
 
The Vatican is reaffirming its opposition to sex change treatments in a new document on human dignity. The declaration approved by Pope Francis says no to changing sex and to gender ideology, stating sex change surgery risks threatening a person's unique dignity. The document largely restates Catholic teaching on a range of topics that also include opposition to abortion, surrogacy and the death penalty. 
 
CNN's Vatican Correspondent Christopher Lamb is joining us with more. Hi there, Christopher. Tell us more about what else is in this document.
 
CHRISTOPHER LAMB, CNN VATICAN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Amara, this is an important document that the Vatican has produced. It's been in the works for five years, and focuses on the whole question of human dignity, particularly with relation to those topics you said on surrogacy, on gender identity, and on gender-affirming surgery, reiterating what the Pope has consistently said on these topics, saying that gender ideology is a dangerous thing. He has been very clear on that. It also talks about things such as the death penalty, the plight of migrants, poverty, trying to set the whole question of human dignity in a broader context. 
 
Now, there are some in the church who would like the Vatican and the Pope to focus on one issue such as abortion. But, Pope Francis and the Vatican are very clear that this issue has to be looked at in the round that the defense of human life in the womb, as the Vatican has said, is not something that is done by fanaticism but is part of a seamless garment approach. Now, we should also state that Pope Francis has shown a pastoral welcome to those who are transgender Catholics to LGBTQ community more broadly. 
 
And also in the document is a strong condemnation of the criminalization of homosexuality, and that was something that was emphasized today at the Vatican by Cardinal Fernandez repeatedly. He said he was very surprised and shocked that some Catholics supported these laws. So, what we're seeing is, I think, a clear defining of where the Catholic Church's position is on these topics, these contested topics, but also a desire to be pastoral and open, a difficult balancing act, Amara.
 
WALKER: It sure is, and a lot of this is not surprising in terms of where the Catholic Church stands. Are you hearing anything in terms of reaction from the faithful?
 
LAMB: Well, there are some groups who are upset with this condemnation of gender theory. LGBTQ groups are upset about that. There'll be others, I think, who will be welcoming the document because they're concerned about these trends. I think we'll see a mixed response. But, I think what was interesting was the Cardinal today was emphasizing that even though Catholics may disagree, everyone is welcome in the church. And so, it's this balance between the pastoral response and the concern about what it sees as -- what the church sees violations of human dignity. 
 
It is also coming soon after a Vatican document at the end of last year that sent shockwaves through the church because it allowed for blessings of same-sex couples. So, there has been pressure on the Pope and the Vatican over whether it really is maintaining church teaching. I think today it was saying that, no, the Pope and the Vatican, under his leadership, are keeping to Catholic tradition and the church's teaching, but trying to do so in a pastoral way.
 
WALKER: Yeah. I'm sure critics will have a hard time reconciling how the church is welcoming certain groups of people, but at the same time condemning some other actions. Christopher Lamb, good to have you. Thank you. 
 
LAMB: Thank you.
 
WALKER: Still to come, the Sun and the Moon are about to do their cosmic dance, and millions across North America have a front row seat. The details. Also later, we will tell you about the promises Donald Trump made to a group of billionaires at a really big fundraiser over the weekend.

WALKER: Continuing our coverage of today's spectacular total solar eclipse, millions of people across North America are in the path of totality, which stretches from Mexico all the way up to eastern Canada. Along this path, the Moon will completely block the Sun for about three and a half to four minutes. If you're not in the path, however, you may still get a show. 49 U.S. states will be able to view at least a partial eclipse. 
 
Let's bring in Hillary Olson from the Rochester Museum and Science Center, which has been preparing for this eclipse for many years now. Hi there, Hillary. Thank you so much for joining us on this really exciting day. Tell us about your preparations and how the Science Center will celebrate this event today.
 
HILLARY OLSON, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, ROCHESTER MUSEUM &amp; SCIENCE CENTER: Sure. So, we've been preparing for this for five years, and really trying to convince everyone in Rochester, Hey, a lot of tourists are going to come. We're going to have a great deal of opportunity to engage people in who the city is and what the city does. And we couldn't be more thrilled. We have a lot of people coming into town and they're all experiencing science here at the RMSE (Rochester Museum and Science Center). So, we have a lot going on. We have a science festival happening, an eclipse festival. And then, the main event today is at 3:20 when the total solar eclipse starts. But, the entire experience of the eclipse is four hours long, and we will have celebrations and music and all kinds of speakers, and it's going to be a lot of fun.
 
WALKER: Yeah. I've been reading too just about how the eclipse could impact people with certain signs, like I'm a Sagittarius, so the fire signs will be impacted more. But, in terms of real science, I mean, what can we learn from solar eclipses? As I know, scientists from around the world and of course NASA scientists will be watching specific things very closely. 
 
OLSON: Yeah. So, the most interesting thing that happens during the eclipse scientifically is it gives us an opportunity to view the corona of the Sun, which is the outer atmosphere of the Sun, which is something that you can't normally see. So, we have a couple of satellites that can do a little bit of that. But, the scientists will be looking at the corona which is super hot plasma and the late people will be looking at the corona. That's the only thing that you'll be able to see if you're in the path of totality during those moments of totality.
 
WALKER: Do you have a lot of these eclipse glasses for the people who are visiting because I --
 
OLSON: Oh my goodness. 
 
WALKER: -- we -- OK.
 
OLSON: Yeah. We ordered 500,000 a couple of years ago when people thought we were crazy, and we are almost out. We still have them for today. But, we're going to make -- we're going to cut it pretty close, which is an incredible testament to how excited the entire region is. 
 
WALKER: Yeah. I had a hard time getting my hands on these. And of course, Allison Chinchar, our meteorologist here at CNN, was kind enough to gift this to me over the weekend. So, I'm holding on to this. You compare this eclipse to 10 Super Bowls. Why is that? 
 
OLSON: Yeah. So, it's -- we have so many people coming into our region and all the regions across the path of totality, that preparing for it means preparing all the restaurants, all the bars, all the venues, all the museums, science centers, wherever it is, everybody had to get ready for it. So, it's not just one venue and it's not just one activity. The city of Rochester and our county Monroe has been creating, there is hundreds of activities happening. 
 <br>[08:45:00]
 
So, there is something for everyone in our area to come see, especially here at the planetarium.
 
WALKER: I mean, you've been planning this, you said, for five years. I mean, you must be so excited about this. What are you, Hillary, personally looking forward to today the most?
 
OLSON: I am looking forward to the crowd experiencing it with me. So, we'll have a few thousand people out in our -- it's our planetarium parking lot. That's our main viewing area. And I experienced the 2017 eclipse and it was really powerful, but it's also really powerful to watch other people experiencing it. So, I want to see the first timers just understand that this is -- it's an incredible solar spectacle. I want people to ooh and aah. And the bigger goal, as I run a science museum, is to have people thinking about the Sun, the Moon and the Earth in ways that maybe they haven't before, and ask a lot of questions. 
 
WALKER: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm definitely looking forward to seeing so many people just come together and feeling that communal feeling from all this. Hillary Olson, great to have you from the Rochester Museum &amp; Science Center. 
 
OLSON: Thank you so much. 
 
WALKER: Thank you. We'll have to leave it there. 
 
OLSON: Have a great day. 
 
WALKER: You as well. Thanks. 
 
Hospitals in the path of the eclipse across America are getting set for extra patients today, patients as in people. Millions of people are expected to travel to get the best possible view. And if there is extra traffic, of course, there is always the risk of more accidents. Another possible hazard is that some eclipse viewers will fail to protect their eyes, although it's well known that staring at the eclipse without protection can damage your vision. Your eyeballs can get damaged. 
 
Let's bring in CNN's Meg Tirrell. I mean, again, we can this enough, do not look directly at the Sun if you don't have protective glasses. Meg, how have hospitals been preparing, first of all?
 
MEG TIRRELL, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah. These hospitals say that they've been working on this, in some cases, for more than a year, especially hospitals in smaller communities that are preparing in the path of totality for a huge influx of people, maybe double or even triple their populations coming to that community. So, there is a lot of concern about traffic, being able to get patients to care where they need to get. 
 
Waco, Texas, AirLift Texas says that they're going to have an additional medical helicopter stationed there for three days around the eclipse for that purpose. At Ozarks Healthcare in central Missouri, serving also northern Arkansas, they're extending walk-in clinic hours. They're encouraging folks to use the walk-in clinics for things that are non-life threatening and to save the emergency department for actual emergencies. 
 
Reet Health in Indiana says they could see up to 150,000 additional people coming to their community. They are actually closing some of their routine or more specialty clinics this afternoon so that they're not going to have as many places open, but they will have those urgent cares open. OhioHealth in Ohio actually says they're going to be sending some folks through mobile clinics to provide first aid at eclipse viewing events at a fairground for example. And up in Vermont, Northwestern Medical Center, they're particularly concerned about traffic patterns. So, they're asking folks not to come to their campus unless they need care, and they say that they are going to be sort of restricting some of the traffic patterns around where they are, just to make sure that people can get in if they need to. 
 
Overall, hospitals across the path of totality are increasing staffing and their emergency departments also increasing. They've stocked up on supplies to make sure that they're prepared. We know from 2017 that there were, unfortunately, an increase in traffic fatalities around that eclipse that was sort of similar to the holiday weekend just because so many more people are on the road. We also know that there is an uptick in sort of more minor accidents that might take people to emergency departments, minor injuries, heat-related injuries. Gastrointestinal illnesses were something that were also recorded, a small uptick in a community in Kentucky that did a study. 
 
And of course, those eye injuries that you mentioned. But, it's not all serious. We have heard from some hospitals, in particular, they're making eclipse onesies, Cleveland Clinic, but posted on social media that they've made eclipse onesies for the babies in their NICU, and that is something pretty adorable, and a keepsake that they can remember. Amara.
 
WALKER: How cute is that picture. I was hoping you would say clips onesies for the adults as well, because I know a fellow, on air friend who loves adult onesies, but I won't mention his name, Victor Blackwell. So, what should people do to make sure that they stay safe while watching the eclipse?
 
TIRRELL: Well, as you said, those eclipse glasses are absolutely key, and you can still get them. I loved hearing that the Rochester Science Museum had ordered 500,000 pairs and they're almost out. 
 
WALKER: Yeah.
 
TIRRELL: That's really incredible, because damage from looking at the Sun can happen within seconds, which is sort of crazy to think about. You may not notice symptoms if you've damaged your eyes for a couple hours, but it can cause blurry vision and a hole in your vision, to serve distorted color vision, a lot of issues, and unfortunately, if you look at the Sun long enough, that can be permanent. That has been documented. So, these glasses are so important because they're more than 1,000 times darker than the darkest sunglasses. They only allow in a fraction of the Sun's visible light. 
 <br>[08:50:00]
 
You should make sure that they're ISO certified. And if you're not absolutely positive that you've got a good pair of glasses, because unfortunately there are some counterfeits out there, you can test them by making sure that you look through them at really bright light inside or Sun's reflection outside, making sure you can only see a faint outline of that light. It should be comfortable to look at the Sun through them. But, if you're not absolutely positive, only look at the Sun for a couple seconds through the glasses at a time. You'll still see the eclipse and you'll protect your vision.
 
WALKER: Yeah. Really, really good and very important advice. Right? Make sure you test out these glasses and make sure they're real. I was just doing that, listening to what you had to say, Meg. And there are so many lights in this little studio here. And when I put these glasses on, you can't see anything. It is pitch black. So, I think this is the real deal. 
 
Meg Tirrell --
 
TIRRELL: It's crazy. WALKER: Yeah. It is. Good to have you. Good to see you. Enjoy today. Thanks so much. And make sure you join us later today for the total solar eclipse. We'll be tracking it from Mexico across America and into Canada. You can experience the eclipse from numerous locations. We will also fill you in on the science and bring you all the excitement of eclipse watchers across North America. Our special coverage starts at 12 p.m. Eastern. More news after the break.

WALKER: Donald Trump has finally addressed one of the major issues of the presidential campaign. In a video posted to social media, Trump says abortion should be left up to the states, dashing conservative hopes that he might back a national abortion ban of some type. Now, Trump said he is in favor of allowing abortions for women who have been raped or where the life of the mother is in danger. He also took credit for the landmark Supreme Court decision that struck down Roe v. Wade. 
 
Now, for months, one of the stories of the 2024 race for the White House has been a big financial advantage for Joe Biden over Donald Trump. But, Trump did have one really good night. His campaign says it raised more than $50 million on Saturday from a glitzy event for super rich donors. It cost a quarter of a million dollars just to get in. Trump told the audience of billionaires he would make sure nothing happens to the valuable tax cuts they got under his last administration, and also, a Melania Trump sighting, we should mention. 
 
Our Alayna Treene is covering both of these stories for us. Hi there, Alayna. OK. So, tell us more about what Trump had to say, because he is obviously trying to neutralize Democratic attacks by taking a leave it up to the states stance. Right?
 
ALAYNA TREENE, CNN REPORTER: That's exactly what he is trying to do. And look, Donald Trump has really sidestepped this issue for over a year now despite him taking credit for the overturning of Roe v. Wade, which he did in that video as well. He has also been very wary of the political ramifications of coming out and backing a national ban after a certain amount of weeks. And I think that's what a lot of his anti- abortion allies and pro-life -- members of the pro-life movement were looking for him to do. They wanted him to clarify his position and come out around a certain number of weeks. However, he did not do that. He said that this should be left to the states. 
 
Now, I do just want to read for you one statement we got from Marjorie Dannenfelser. She is the President of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life, a leading anti-abortion group. This is what she said to us in a statement this morning. 
 <br>[08:55:00]
 
She said quote, "We are deeply disappointed in President Trump's position. Unborn children and their mothers deserve national protections and national advocacy from the brutality of the abortion industry." The statement went on to say, "Saying the issue is back to the states' cedes the national debate to the Democrats." And look, I think that's how a lot of people on the right are going to respond to this. 
 
And really, what Donald Trump did with that statement does leave him open to attacks from both sides. Donald Trump really did try to take, I think, the politically safe mood -- move by saying we should leave this up to the states. However, Democrats are still going to continue to blame him for any strict abortion laws they see statewide -- in different states across the country, while Republicans on the right, as we saw with that statement, are going to argue that he isn't going far enough. But again, Donald Trump leaving this to the states and not coming out with a specific number of weeks that he believes abortion should be banned.
 
WALKER: All right. Alayna Treene, we are out of time. So, we will leave it there. Thank you. 
 
And thank you for joining me here on CNN Newsroom. I'm Amara Walker. Connect the World with Becky Anderson is up next.
