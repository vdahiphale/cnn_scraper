(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
PAULA NEWTON, CNN ANCHOR:  Brand new strikes against the Houthis as the United States quest for retaliation continues. Officials say it's not over 
 
 and there are more strikes to come. "One World" starts right now. 
 
The United States is striking back. Iran says the U.S. is just trying to draw attention from the real problem. Also ahead right now, some of the 
 
 wealthiest zip codes in the world are at risk. Damaging landslides and excessive rainfall are in the forecast for millions right across 
 
 California. 
 
And later, it's what everyone's talking about, surprise appearances, stunning performances, and Taylor Swift makes history yet again. The best 
 
 moments from music's biggest night. 
 
Live from New York, I'm Paula Newton. Zain and Bianna are off today. You are watching "One World". The United States is vowing to take further 
 
 action against Iranian-backed militias in the Middle East as the ripple effects of the Israel-Hamas war continue to spill right across the region. 
 
 The U.S. has hit dozens of targets now in Iraq and Syria over the past few days in retaliation for the deaths of three American soldiers in Friday's 
 
 drone attack in Jordan. U.S. officials say 84 of 85 targets were destroyed or damaged. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
NEWTON:  Also, the U.S. is continuing to target Houthi rebels in Yemen who are disrupting the vessels in the Red Sea. The Houthis claim their 
 
 operations are carried out in solidarity with the Palestinian people. 
 
Sunday's attack targeted Houthi weapons comes a day after joint U.S.-U.K. strikes on three dozen Houthi targets in Yemen. I want you to listen now to 
 
 the U.S. President's response to a reporter's question about those strikes. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNKNOWN:  Are the airstrikes working? 
 
JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  Yeah. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NEWTON:  So, the developments come as the U.S. Secretary of State makes his fifth visit to the region since the October 7th Hamas attacks in Israel. 
 
 Antony Blinken landed in Saudi Arabia earlier today, his first stop on a trip that will see him visit Egypt, Qatar, Israel and the West Bank. 
 
Among his key objectives, progress on a hostage deal, coordinating the day after for Gaza, and trying to ensure the region that the U.S. does not want 
 
 to escalate the situation any further. 
 
CNN's Diplomatic Editor Nic Robertson is following all of these developments and is standing by for us in Tel Aviv. But we begin now with 
 
 CNN's National Security Reporter, Natasha Bertrand at the Pentagon. 
 
And Natasha, I want to go right to Jake Sullivan, the National Security Advisor. And he was blunt on the weekend, right? He said there are more 
 
 strikes to come. And this is interesting. He underscored that it's Iran that has, in his words, a significant and pernicious responsibility for 
 
 this instability. 
 
So, I'm wondering, are you getting a sense of what further action may look like in the hours or days to come? 
 
NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTER:  Well, we don't yet know because the administration really is not telegraphing what next steps are 
 
 going to take, just as they didn't, leading up to those, you know, several round of strikes on Friday in Iraq and Syria. 
 
However, the one sign we are getting pretty clearly is that the administration is deeply reluctant and probably won't strike inside Iran 
 
 itself. President Biden and his national security team, they have said publicly that they do not want to get into a war with Iran. 
 
But the attack on that U.S. outpost in Jordan that killed three American soldiers clearly required a response. And that is why we saw that round of 
 
 strikes in Iraq and Syria on Friday night that, as you said, it managed to destroy, according to Pentagon officials, 84 facilities that were being 
 
 used by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, as well as other Iran- backed militias. 
 
Now, in terms of what's next, I mean, it really could take a number of different forms. It could be additional strikes on Iraq and Syria on these 
 
 militant groups because we don't know yet just how much of their capabilities have been degraded as a result of these strikes over the 
 
 weekend. It could also come in the form of some kind of non-kinetic action like an offensive cyber attack for example. 
 
There are many options that the administration has been weighing in recent days and weeks but one thing is clear is that they're trying to ratchet 
 
 tensions down instead of escalate and that is why something that an official told us is really interesting about the post-strike analysis they 
 
 have done following those strikes, which is that they do not believe that any Iranians themselves were killed in those strikes over the weekend. 
 <br>[12:05:00]
 
NEWTON:  Yeah, which is certainly significant, as you say, for those wanting to see a de-escalation, not an escalation in this sense. Nic, now 
 
 to you in Tel Aviv. I'm interested to get your take. You've, of course, heard from all sides here, and you know what the argument is, right? It's 
 
 either the U.S. isn't hitting back strongly enough or the strikes are further destabilizing an already combustible situation. 
 
 So, that brings us to a possible deal, right? Between Israel and Hamas. Most say, look, you're not going to solve any of this unless things settle 
 
 down. Are you getting a sense of where we are with perhaps a truce to come in the coming days or weeks? 
 
The State Department at the moment believes that the ball is in Hamas' court. Egyptian intelligence chief along with the chief of the CIA, the 
 
 Qatari Prime Minister and the Israeli head of Mossad had a meeting in Paris. They hammered out a proposal for Hamas. Hamas has got that. 
 
 Indications are from Hamas. 
 
They're not going to budge on their demands, but everyone's still waiting for an answer and there's daylight between what Hamas is saying they want 
 
 and what Israel is saying it wants. Indeed, we've just heard from the Israeli Prime Minister sort of doubling down saying that absolute victory 
 
 includes killing the Hamas leadership and we cannot stop the military operation in Gaza until then. 
 
So, that's a pretty -- sounds like an immovable position. I think, you know, when you take the language that's being used in the region by Iran's 
 
 proxies and by Iran, which is in essence, that if you can just get a deal in Gaza, then all this other trouble, like the hitting of ships in the Red 
 
 Sea by the Houthis and the uptick --significant uptick and killing of U.S. forces in the region by their proxies, all that will melt away. 
 
But I think the reality that's understood here is that what they're talking about is a deal in Gaza that favors Hamas, weakens Israel, therefore 
 
 weakens the U.S. interest in the region which is the long game of what Iran is doing, and it's using its proxies to do that. So, we are at that 
 
 position. At the moment, it appears, waiting for Hamas's answer. 
 
So, the risk, therefore, of a miscalculation and escalation is as big as it ever was and will continue as such. It does not seem, at the moment, as if 
 
 that deal over Gaza is close. Who knows? It could be around the corner, but it doesn't sound that way.
 
NEWTON:  Yeah, and as you reminded us before, the public posturing certainly sometimes gives us no indication as to where the deal is going. 
 
 Nic Robertson for us in Tel Aviv, Natasha Bertrand, thanks so much, really appreciate it. 
 
And we go to California now, where nearly 40 million people are under flood advisories, and they're bracing for more. Check out what is normally a 
 
 walk, right? No walk in the park there. That is a cascading waterfall, thanks to flash flooding at Santa Barbara's Botanic Garden in Ventura 
 
 County. Meantime, nowhere for all of that rain to go as sewer lines are backed up and drivers try and navigate high water. 
 
Remember, you're told not to navigate high water. You're told to turn around. And in San Jose, meantime, fire crews had to rescue people and 
 
 animals stranded by flood waters. Los Angeles had its wettest day in two decades on Sunday. 
 
Joining us now from the Los Angeles area at CNN's David Culver. Good morning to you. Quite a way to start the work week. I mean look at the 
 
 destruction behind you. I'm still stunned. These are places that we're dealing with drought just a few years ago and look at it now.
 
DAVID CULVER, CNN SENIOR U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Definitely no drought situation right now, Paula. I mean, even as I'm talking to you, on 
 
 the phone line, I'm hearing the emergency alerts for flash flooding, which is continuing to go on here where we are. We're up in the Hollywood Hills. 
 
 And you can see, as you pointed out, there's a lot of destruction. 
 
Let me walk you up through some of this debris path. I'm seeing here some of the rocks that obviously pushed off from the hills, knocked off an 
 
 entire home from its foundation. So, I see kind of some personal effects. You can see drywall, parts of a piano, and that is the rest of the piano up 
 
 there. 
 
The home was unoccupied. So, that's good news here, but there are four homes around it that had folks inside. Those are damaged. Six cars wiped 
 
 away. Some of them are still buried and there's a massive path that will work our way up in the next few hours to get a better view from a safer 
 
 vantage point that has almost looked like a ski slope going down, but just of pure mud. 
 
And we've seen this driving around the hills here in Hollywood. It's interesting because you go to some parts, for example, farther out west and 
 
 some of the low lying areas. You don't see nearly this situation. I mean, certainly have rain coming down, but they were spared the brunt of this. 
 
We're seeing it here that I mean, look, look at the side of these roads and the hills. They basically have developed their own rivers. There's some air 
 
 pods there and then you go all the way down. 
 <br>[12:10:00]
 
You can see that's the rest of that piano along with the facade of the home and some more folks who are gathering just trying to take it all in as 
 
 light has come up here on the West Coast and maybe, at one point had some of the concerns of a gas leak and we could smell some of the gases we 
 
 pulled up. They were able just a short time ago to shut it off. 
 
But Paula, this is the concern is that you have these sudden unexpected moments. One of the neighbors here said it was just a loud boom and within 
 
 seconds part of his house was damaged. And then he looked to his neighbor's house and realized there is no longer a house there, just the foundation. 
 
 The house now in the middle of the street behind me. Paula. 
 
NEWTON:  Yeah, just terrifying looking at those scenes, just trying to keep everyone safe. And again, this is a place that's usually used to wildfires, 
 
 right? Or at least has been the last few years. 
 
CULVER:  Right.
 
NEWTON:  David Culver, I know you'll continue to stay on the scene. Really appreciate it. Now, CNN meteorologist Alison Chinchara has been following 
 
 this for days. You give us an update on how long this storm is sticking around, because it's different, isn't it? It's not moving on. 
 
ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEROROLOGIST:  It's not. This is definitely one of the slower moving storms, which has been one of the problems with this is 
 
 that it's not moving out very quickly, allowing some of these areas to just have storms that train over the same areas over and over again. 
 
It's still raining right now across portions of Northern California, especially up around Eureka, Crescent City, even Central California, still 
 
 looking at some heavy bands from time to time. But really the bulk of the heavy moisture is still focused across Southern California, specifically in 
 
 and around the Los Angeles area. 
 
That's where we still have the most recent of the flood watches, still in effect for a lot of these areas. We had a flash flood warning in this area 
 
 that has now since come down. That does not mean it's done raining. It just means that what's coming down a little bit lighter at this point in time, 
 
 but we could still get more of those as we go throughout the rest of the day. 
 
This behind me is Mission Creek. You can see that creek is completely swollen, that water level all the way up to this bridge right here, flowing 
 
 over onto the roadway there, and it's one of many roads that we've seen that water piling up on. There have been swift water rescues in some of 
 
 these communities, as well. 
 
Looking at some of these numbers, it's no surprise. Look at this. Several areas picking up well over 200 millimeters of rain just in the last few 
 
 days and they're likely going to pick up as much as 100 millimeters more on top of what they've already had. And that's why you still have that 
 
 widespread threat for many of these areas for flooding today. 
 
Now, the target point is still going to be down to the south. Areas that does include Los Angeles, portions of Long Beach where you see this pink 
 
 color here, that is a level four out of four, the highest risk possible for flooding. To emphasize how rare this actually is, high risks are issued 
 
 fewer than four percent of the days per year on average, but they account for more than 80 percent of flood damage and nearly 40 percent of 
 
 fatalities. 
 
Again, the other concern is also power outages still looking at over half a million people without power in the state of California. And Paula, no 
 
 surprise again, take a look at some of these numbers. Wind gusts exceeding 200 kilometers per hour. Some areas could still see them exceeding 100 
 
 kilometers per hour through the day today. 
 
NEWTON:  Yeah, what you would normally see in hurricanes. Allison, thanks so much for the update. Really appreciate it. Joining me now is Santa 
 
 Barbara Mayor Randy Rouse. And good morning to you on what I'm sure is a difficult day ahead. So, at this hour, given what we just saw and heard, 
 
 what's your main concern for your community? What have you dealt with, and what do you think you're going to be dealing with in the hours to come? 
 
RANDY ROWSE, MAYOR OF SANTA BARBARA CALIFORNIA:  Yeah, well, good morning. Well, our biggest event was yesterday in the early afternoon where we got 
 
 our most concentration of rain, both on the flatlands and up in the foothills. And when those two combined, that's when we got the really 
 
 swollen creeks and the flooding problems. 
 
So, right now, we're in the cleanup and recovery mode. We are expecting more rain this afternoon, but we're not expecting the intensity or the 
 
 volume that we had yesterday. Most of the energy seems to have moved south into the L.A. basin. NEWTON:  Yeah, and we just got that update as Allison 
 
 was giving us an update on the map. But in terms of how unprecedented these conditions are, what would you say to everyone watching right now? You guys 
 
 certainly are not used to dealing with this. 
 
ROWSE:  Well, actually, Santa Barbara has dealt with a few disasters in the last few years, beginning with, of course, the very famous Montecito 
 
 mudslide a few years back. But that combination of being this close to our mountains and the beach, really does combine for this kind of event from 
 
 time to time. 
 
What was unprecedented was the amount and the duration of the rain that's why Mission Creek and Luguna Channel and Sycamore Creek, all of our 
 
 drainages were at or over capacity. 
 
So, we have a drain system that is basically a century old that's designed for a twenty five year event and these are hundred-year storms that we've 
 
 actually had a more frequently than a hundred years. 
 
NEWTON:  Yeah, I mean, you're talking about the resiliency of your community. And as you point out, you've dealt with a lot. I think I was 
 
 pointing out the fact that, look, it wasn't too long ago we were reading about droughts in Santa Barbara. 
 <br>[12:15:00]
 
I mean, how confident are you about your community to withstand this, given you were so well-prepared. And now, you're not dealing with once in a 
 
 generation events, you're dealing with once in a century events? 
 
ROWSE:  Well, and the odd thing about this particular storm was the amount of wind that came along with it. We had wind velocities that were really 
 
 not completely unheard of, but very, very strong for this area. Some gusts up to 50 knots. So, that's very, very strong wind. 
 
We had excellent preparation. We had great public service. All that's been great. We have had no loss of life, no serious injuries that I'm aware of, 
 
 some downed power outage, downed power areas, but Edison has been here to work with us. 
 
So, we've been reacting to everything and we've had to do some evacuations, we're re-populating those areas, as we speak. So, things are looking pretty 
 
 good for the kind of event that we just had. 
 
NEWTON:  And as you say Mayor Rowse, perhaps out of the woods, so to speak, for the next few days. What is your message though to people who are 
 
 looking at this damage? And these are things, these events keep piling up. I noticed you guys were just dealing with other events just in December, 
 
 you were still cleaning up from that. What is your message to people in communities like yours? 
 
ROWSE:  Well, the biggest message is, you know, please pay attention to the alerts. Please pay attention when -- during the warnings for evacuations 
 
 and very much, please do not venture out to go look and see because the less traffic on the road, the more capacity we have for our emergency 
 
 vehicles. And we've only had one major water rescue, so far, the vehicles which -- the last time we did this, we rescued about 110 vehicles. 
 
So, we were much more proactive about blocking off streets and the community has been great as far as response. We do need to look at our 
 
 coastal resiliency with the oncoming sea level rise and looking at our drainage systems that frankly are going to need mechanical solutions. I 
 
 don't think gravity is going to do it for us because we're pretty low lying next to the coast. 
 
NEWTON:  Yeah, the reality of what the climate is doing to so many coastal communities there. Randy Rouse, good luck with everything. We certainly 
 
 hope you move on to cleaning up in the next few hours. Appreciate it. 
 
ROWSE:  All right. Thank you very much. Now, dozens of active wildfires meantime raging throughout Chile, and authorities warn the death toll 
 
 likely to rise. The government says at least 122 people have been killed so far, and hundreds of people now reported missing. 
 
The fires began last week and gathered some momentum over the weekend. They've been particularly devastating in the central and northwestern part 
 
 of the country until they began a two-day national mourning period earlier today. 
 
Okay, coming up for us, the fate of a convicted school shooter's mother is now in a jury's hands as they decide whether parents should be held 
 
 accountable for their children's actions. Then, surrounded by violence with a health care system on the brink of collapse, the dire situation facing 
 
 pregnant women and newborns. in Gaza. We'll have that when we return. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:20:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
NEWTON:  The Israeli army is once again urging civilians to evacuate parts of Gaza City and where much of the fighting is now focused. But it's 
 
 unclear how many people are aware of the orders given the lack of internet and mobile service. That is still a problem in the besieged enclave. 
 
Now, the United Nations humanitarian office says in recent days thousands of Palestinians have fled south to Rafah. The U.N. describes the border 
 
 town as a quote, pressure cooker of despair where more than a million displaced people have already taken refuge. 
 
The Israel-Hamas war, in the meantime, will hit the four-month mark in just a few days. And according to the Hamas-controlled health ministry, more 
 
 than 27,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since October 7th. For those left behind, the situation on the ground is dire, especially for 
 
 pregnant women and their newborns. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh has our story. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN INTERNATIONL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Born into this world all alone. No parents by her side. Only a stranger's touch for 
 
 the baby with no name. Delivered by C-section last month to a mother already gone, fatally injured in an explosion. She's been in an incubator 
 
 since. Stable now, but still fragile, doctors say. 
 
She's one of the nearly 20,000 born into this war. Every 10 minutes, a baby is born in Gaza, the U.N. says. Gaza is where the blessings of life are now 
 
 a curse. Umm Yazan is five months pregnant. Like most Gazans, her family's homeless. This, the toilets of a school turned shelter, is where they live. 
 
This is our life in the toilets, Umm Yazan says. We lay our mattresses and sleep here. Umm Yazan and her husband can hardly feed their children. 
 
 There's not enough for their unborn child. I'm in my fifth month craving foods, but there's no food, no flour, nothing, she says. She's not had her 
 
 iron supplements, not even a check-up in months. 
 
We wanted to check if there's a heartbeat, but there are no hospitals. They're only dealing with emergencies, she says. There are no scans to see 
 
 if the baby's alive or not. Life is nonexistent for pregnant women. 
 
Gaza's few remaining hospitals are overwhelmed with the seemingly endless flood of war casualties. There's no chance of carrying out routine care. 
 
 And the estimated 50,000 pregnant women and their unborn babies are left out in the cold. They're already precarious situation before the war, now 
 
 dramatically worse. 
 
About 40 percent of all pregnancies are now high-risk, eight groups say. Miscarriages, stillbirths, preterm labor, maternal mortality are much more 
 
 likely. For first-time mothers like Hiam, the excitement is overshadowed by this miserable existence that's now her life, soon to be her babies. 
 
Being pregnant with your first child should be nice. You eat, you rest, you sleep. But I didn't get any of that, Hiam says. Instead, she's had to flee 
 
 several times, taking shelter in overcrowded hospitals, walking miles searching for safety. 
 
After walking for many hours, I was exhausted, she says. The baby was very weak. They told me I should be staying in the hospital, but there was no 
 
 room, so I had to leave. She's now in this tent, sleeping on a sand floor. 
 
How will I give birth in war when I have nothing for the baby, no formula, no diapers? We're in a tent and it's very cold for us. What will life be 
 
 like for a tiny baby born into these conditions? 
 
It's hell. This burnt-out classroom in what's left of northern Gaza is the only shelter Nujood could find. She barely made it through the bombardment 
 
 and labor, struggling to keep her newborn healthy, clean and warm. 
 
We want to clean the classroom but there's no disinfectant, Nujood says. There's no health care, no clinics, no vaccinations for the baby. 
 <br>[12:25:00]
 
War has separated Nujood from her husband. She's only been able to reach him once when she told him they had a baby girl, Habiba. Nujood's mother 
 
 spends her days trying to find what she can to feed her daughter. 
 
This is my first grandchild. It's supposed to be happiness, she says. But I couldn't celebrate. I wanted to prepare so many things for her to celebrate 
 
 her arrival, my precious first granddaughter. She didn't even get the new clothes I bought her. 
 
It's never been harder to be a mother in Gaza. All you can do is hold your baby tight and hope you both survive this nightmare. Jomana Karadsheh, CNN,

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
NEWTON:  And welcome back to "One World". I'm Paula Newton. A jury is now deciding the fate of Jennifer Crumbley in what could be a landmark case. 
 
 She faces four counts of involuntary manslaughter, one for each of the students her son Ethan killed when he opened fire at a Michigan high school 
 
 in 2021. Now, he was just 15 years old at the time. 
 
The jury's decision, we'll remind you, must be unanimous. And the trial marks the first time a parent could face prison time for their child's 
 
 actions in a mass shooting. 
 
CNN's Jean Casarez joins us now from Pontiac, Michigan. You have been following every detail of this case. 
 <br>[12:30:00]
 
Can you bring us right up to date on what happened this morning? Because as I understand it, there are new developments. 
 
JEAN CASAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  There are new developments. Let me tell you that the jury has a question. So, they've been deliberating a little 
 
 over two hours now. We haven't heard anything from them, and now a question. 
 
So, what has happened is that the attorneys have assembled in the courtroom. They are looking at photocopies of the question. And you have so 
 
 many prosecutors, and they are all together standing, reading this question, conferring with each other. 
 
The defense attorney, she's all alone. She does not have a co-counsel. She is sitting at her desk, really not studying the question too much. But you 
 
 try to discern what's the question. 
 
Now, we're going to hear it. We should hear it in open court, waiting for the judge to take the stand. The defendant, I didn't see in the courtroom. 
 
 But the question can be anything. But it can be potentially a roadmap for both sides to see what the jury is interested in looking at, what exhibit, 
 
 what testimony or where they are and what side does it help. 
 
You can't always read the tea leaves but possibly, you can. Now, the morning started with jury instructions being read by the judge --the judge 
 
 really focusing in on that there can be more than one cause of death. That even though Ethan Crumbley, the 15-year-old son of Jennifer Crumbley was 
 
 the one that had the gun that pulled the trigger horrifically, killing four students for them not to have their lives anymore, this took this community 
 
 to its knees. 
 
The emotion that was involved and this jury is from this community. But the defense has said that Jennifer Crumbley did not have warning signs. She had 
 
 no idea her son had any type of mental issues. He was sad, he lost his grandmother, his dog, and his best friend recently, but she didn't think he 
 
 needed mental help. 
 
The family had a hobby of guns. They had gotten a gun for Ethan purchased by the father. Black Friday, several days later, unbeknownst to the 
 
 parents, he got a hold of that gun, went to the school, and he shot and killed and injured so many. Paula? 
 
 NEWTON:  Yeah, such tragedy, and again, the emotion of all of it playing out for the victims' families there in that courtroom. Jean Casarez, I know 
 
 you'll come back to us as soon as we hear more from the courtroom. Appreciate it. 
 
And it is time now for The Exchange. Joining me is defense and trial attorney Misty Marris. I -- Misty, I got a ton of questions before we get 
 
 to that, though. This whole thing about coming back after a couple of hours and posing a question, fairly normal, right, in a case like this? 
 
MISTY MARRIS, DEFENSE ATTORNEY:  It certainly is. The jury often comes back and has questions that can range from a variety of different things. It 
 
 could be asking for clarification on the jury instructions that were given by the judge this morning. It could be asking to see a piece of evidence 
 
 again or hear a read back of certain testimony. 
 
From the seat of the prosecutor and the defense, Oftentimes both sides will try and read into the question to see if they can glean on whether the jury 
 
 is leaning one way or another, or at least it gives an indication of what the sticking points are. We try and interpret it, we can't always do it, 
 
 but it will be interesting to hear what it is. 
 
NEWTON:  Yeah, as will all of us, because as you've remarked many times and many others have, this could be a precedent-setting case, and I want to get 
 
 to that. Now in closing arguments, the prosecution put it very plainly in trying to condemn this mother saying, look, it takes, in their words, the 
 
 unthinkable, and she has done the unthinkable, and because of that, four kids have died. They are trying to prove that as a parent, as a mother, she 
 
 too is responsible. Can you lay out, if this verdict comes back as guilty, what that would mean? 
 
MARRIS:  Well, it certainly opens up a whole can of worms with respect to holding parents criminally accountable for the acts of their children. Now 
 
 here we're seeing it in a mass shooter context. This is opening up the scope of who can be held responsible in a mass shooting for those deaths. 
 
Keep in mind. There's been legal responsibility for parents before, but the theories had been child negligence, you know, that there's been ignoring 
 
 the child or failure to lock up a firearm, child neglect. It has never been holding a parent accountable for the deaths of the victim. 
 
So, this is a very, very novel legal theory that can open up the door to other potentially fact-specific type cases that go beyond just this mass 
 
 shooting realm. So, it's really, really significant. And this decision is certainly something to watch from the legal perspective. 
 <br>[12:35:00]
 
NEWTON:  Yeah, and it's good -- for good reason. The entire country and beyond has been absolutely riveted. I was struck when Jennifer Crumbley 
 
 herself took the stand in her own defense and actually said -- and I'm quoting her now, "I've asked myself if I would have done anything 
 
 differently." She testified. And she said she wouldn't have done anything differently. 
 
What did you make of that at that point in time? And legally, could she have done anything else? Because if she showed any contrition, would it 
 
 have essentially, would have been admitting guilt? 
 
MARRIS:  That's exactly it. So from the perspective of a defense lawyer, you're going to prep your client when they're on the stand. And the whole 
 
 argument in this case is that Ethan Crumbley's actions of going into that school, pulling out a gun and opening fire was not foreseeable to her. 
 
So, in order to establish that, she cannot go back and say, I would have done X, Y, Z differently because that would undercut that defense. However, 
 
 I will say, I was struck by that, and I think many people were. And there's probably a way to say it that's a bit different that is now looking back 
 
 with hindsight of 2020, of course I would. 
 
But at the time, I had no idea that Ethan was capable of such horror, or something to that extent. But I do understand why the defense attorney had 
 
 her keep it tight because that is the entire crux of the case falls on whether or not this was foreseeable. 
 
NEWTON:  Yeah. And if the verdict, depending on what happens with the verdict, how much could this really change American parents and how they 
 
 are held responsibly? Could it actually change the threat that school shooters pose. Again, given the fact that this young man had access to guns 
 
 and he had access to guns because his parents gave him that access. 
 
MARRIS:  Well, I think it's really two-fold here. First of all, just from a public policy perspective, the mere fact that this case is in the 
 
 courtroom, in a criminal courtroom, moving forward, it sends shockwaves out because just the mere fact that this is a fact-specific scenario that can 
 
 be a criminal charge and hold a parent accountable is meant to send a message for parents to be more vigilant, to pay more attention. That's the 
 
 public policy aspect. 
 
As far as the legal aspect, this will set a precedent whereby there is case law to support this type of criminal charge. And that means that parents 
 
 can be held responsible for the acts of their kids. Now, it will always be fact-sensitive. It will always relate to what jurisdiction it's in, to what 
 
 exactly the law says in that jurisdiction and what the actual facts of the case are. 
 
So, it's not as if there's going to be a bright line rule. It will still be fact sensitive, but it absolutely creates a whole new level of 
 
 accountability for these types of cases. And especially in these tragic cases, we have way too many of them, of mass shootings and who is 
 
 ultimately responsible. 
 
So, this is a huge case from that perspective on both fronts, both public policy and awareness as well as legal repercussions. Yeah, and certainly 
 
 the testimony has been absolutely heartbreaking and chilling and so many eyes now on that courtroom. Misty Marris, I know you'll continue to follow 
 
 this for us. Thanks so much, really appreciate the perspective. 
 
Now, the first hearing was held in a Canadian court today for five former junior hockey players facing sexual assault charges. Now, a woman accused 
 
 multiple members of Canada's world junior hockey team of sexually assaulting her in London, Ontario, back in 2018. 
 
Four are currently professional hockey players and another a former professional. The case came to light in May, 2022 after a sports channel 
 
 reported that Hockey Canada had paid out more than $2 million to settle a lawsuit brought by the alleged victim. 
 
Okay, just ahead for us, the Swifties, they're rejoicing. Not only did Taylor Swift make history at the Grammy Awards, she also made a surprise 
 
 announcement. Yes, a mic drop at the Grammys. We've got that for you coming up.

NEWTON:  The Super Bowl, I don't have to remind many of you, is now less than a week away. The San Francisco 49ers and the Kansas City Chiefs 
 
 arrived in Las Vegas that is, Sunday. The latest betting odds, in case you're interested, of the 49ers as two-point -- just two-point favorites to 
 
 win. That means it's going to be a close game, likely. 
 
Kansas City star quarterback Patrick Mahomes was first off his team's flight. A win for the Chiefs on Sunday would give Mahomes his third -- 
 
 already his third, Super Bowl victory. 
 
Hong Kong's top sporting official says the government made repeated requests for Lionel Messi to play in Sunday's match, but he never entered 
 
 the game. And this was the reaction. Listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
NEWTON:  Yeah, no mystery there as to how they were feeling. They booed when the superstar failed to take the pitch during the match between his 
 
 Inter Miami team and a group of local standouts. 
 
The Hong Kong government said the event's organizers, Tadler owes fans an explanation. Now, Tadler expressed, quote, "extreme disappointment", but 
 
 denied knowing that the World Cup champion wouldn't play. Inter Miami's coach said Messi and another player sat out because of injuries. 
 
CNN's Kristie Lu Stout was there at the match. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Here in Hong Kong, no show on the pitch for the Argentine football superstar, Lionel Messi, and the fans here 
 
 are disappointed. What was initially cheers in the stands here at Hong Kong Stadium turned into jeers, boos, and even chants of, "Where is Messi?" And 
 
 "Refund, refund". 
 
Some 40,000 fans here in Hong Kong clamored for the opportunity to see Lionel Messi play with his team, Inter Miami, for a pre-season friendly 
 
 against a Hong Kong squad. This was Inter Miami's first ever international tour. Its co-owner David Beckham also here adding to the football star 
 
 power. But when Lionel Messi failed to get up from the bench, the mood inside the stadium soured and the fans have been leaving utterly crushed 
 
 and disappointed. 
 
Joining me now is a super fan here in Hong Kong of Lionel Messi. Christopher, Leon, a lot of people disappointed tonight. How are you 
 
 feeling? 
 
CHRISTOPHER LEON, DISAPPOINTED LIONEL MESSI FAN:  Disappointed just like everyone is. Yeah, very disappointed. Really wanted to see him play, even 
 
 for five minutes. So --
 
LU STOUT:  Really disappointed. You named your son after Lionel Messi. You paid for the ticket. How much did you pay for your ticket? 
 
LEON:  Like $2300. Yeah. Hong Kong dollars. 
 
LU STOUT:  So, that's about $300 U.S. dollars, right? 
 
LEON:  Yeah. Yeah, very disappointed. And most people are. It's really -- it started -- the disappointment started from yesterday, I think, with the 
 
 training session because that was not cheap either. That was a hundred bucks. 
 
So, then today, you know, we really, like, we saw the signs, right? He wasn't on the substitutes list, actually. And he was dressed in full 
 
 tracksuit. So yeah, we were praying for good, but we're expecting the worst, I think, a little bit. 
 
LU STOUT:  Your prayers weren't answered, Chris Leon, I'm so sorry. Thank you for joining us. 
 
LEON:  Thank you. 
 
LU STOUT:  Now, the Hong Kong government, they were really hoping that an event like this would turn Hong Kong into a hub for mega events to help 
 
 drive tourism and help to reboot the economy. 
 <br>[12:45:00]
 
But for all the fans that showed up tonight, it was never about the economy. It was always about the beautiful game. It was about football. It 
 
 was about seeing their hero, Lionel Messi, on the pitch. But that was a dream that was ultimately denied. Kristie Lu Stout, CNN, Hong Kong.

NEWTON:  And you are watching "One World". We'll be right back in a moment. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
NEWTON:  So, that wild weather we've been telling you about, which is plaguing of course Los Angeles and most of Southern California, it didn't 
 
 put a damper on music's biggest night. It did threaten to make some of them late, but Sunday's Grammy Awards ceremony saw some history making moments, 
 
 not to mention some very emotional tributes. CNN's Elizabeth Wagmeister wraps it all up for us. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
CELINE DION, SINGER:  Taylor Swift.
 
ELIZABETH WAGMEISTER, CNN ENTERTAINMENT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  From anti-hero to history maker, Taylor Swift becoming the first artist to win 
 
 album of the year four times. Stunned and overjoyed, Swift accepted the award for her 2022 album, "Midnights". 
 
TAYLOR SWIFT, WINNER, ALBUM OF THE YEAR:  I would love to tell you that this is the best moment of my life, but the award is the work. All I want 
 
 to do is keep being able to do this. I love it so much. 
 
WAGMEISTER (voice-over):  An award presented by the legend, Celine Dion, who shocked the crowd with her unannounced appearance. The Canadian singer 
 
 has been open about her health issues. 
 
DION:  When I say that I'm happy to be here. I really mean it from my heart. 
 
WAGMEISTER (voice-over):  Swift, now a 14-time Grammy winner, her first one of the night for best pop vocal album. Then, making a surprise 
 
 announcement. 
 
SWIFT:  My brand new album is called -- it's called "The Tortured Poets Department". 
 
WAGMEISTER (voice-over):  Music's biggest superstars made the biggest headlines in a night filled with historic performances. As 80-year-old 
 
 legend Joni Mitchell performed for the first time on the Grammy stage. 
 
(JONI MITCHELL PERFORMING "I REALLY DON'T KNOW LIFE AT ALL")
 
WAGMEISTER (voice-over):  Billy Joel rocking the crowd with his first Grammy performance in 30 years. 
 <br>[12:50:00]
 
(BILLY JOEL PERFORMING "TURN THE LIGHTS BACK ON")
 
WAGMEISTER (voice-over):  Earlier in the night, the crowd sang along with Tracy Chapman, joining Country Star Luke Combs. 
 
(LUKE COMBS PERFORMING "FAST CAR" WITH TRACY CHAPMAN)
 
WAGMEISTER (voice-over):  SZA had the most nominations and took home three Grammys, including Best R and B Song. 
 
SZA:  I came really, really far, and I can't believe this is happening. 
 
WAGMEISTER (voice-over):  Miley Cyrus celebrated her first win with a powerful performance of flowers, complete with a tribute to Tina Turner, 
 
 which wasn't the only tribute to the legend. Fantasia Barrino, part of a star-studded memorial to those music-lost. 
 
(FANTASIA BARRINO PERFORMING "ROLLING ON THE RIVER")
 
(STEVIE WONDER SINGING WITH ARCHIVAL VIDEO OF TONY BENNETT)
 
WAGMEISTER (voice-over):  As Stevie Wonder sang with archival video of his fallen friend Tony Bennett. And Annie Lennox bought back tears remembering 
 
 Sinead O'Connor. 
 
(ANNIE LENNOX PERFORMING)
 
WAGMEISTER (voice-over):  Jay-Z awarded for his lifetime of work, with wife Beyonce looking on, accepting the award with his daughter, Blue Ivy. And 
 
 taking aim at the Recording Academy for never awarding Beyonce Album of the Year. 
 
JAY-Z:  Think about that. The most Grammys never won Album of the Year. That doesn't work. You know? 
 
WAGMEISTER (voice-over):  But ending with the powerful message. 
 
JAY-Z:  Got to keep showing up until they give you all those accolades you feel you deserve, until they call you chairman, until they call you a 
 
 genius, until they call you the greatest of all time. You feel me? 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
NEWTON:  So many epic moments there. Elizabeth Wagmeister, you were there. Can you give us just a sense of what went on? And I do think we went back 
 
 to that moment that Celine Dion announced that Taylor Swift was the winner, and yet there was controversy there. 
 
WAGMEISTER:  Yes, it was a great night. This was one of the best Grammys that I can remember, and the room was really loving it. You know, that 
 
 Celine moment, she walked out on stage. Such a big surprise, especially after she has been so open about her health recently. 
 
While when Taylor Swift came up on stage, she did not acknowledge Celine. She took the award from her, but she didn't hug her. She didn't say hi to 
 
 her. So, social media is up in arms over this today and last night, but the pair did have a moment backstage. We saw some photos of them, so it seems 
 
 that all is well. But you know, Taylor always has people talking, doesn't she? 
 
NEWTON:  Yeah, absolutely, and especially on that night, but so many performances, and I'm so happy that you highlighted so many of them. I 
 
 watched the show, and go on social media, guys, and repeat it, I mean, starting with Tracy Chapman and Luke Combs, but then also Joni Mitchell. So 
 
 many emotional moments. 
 
In terms of you being there, I mean, what was the vibe? Especially, you showed some controversial moments, as well, with Jay-Z. 
 
WAGMEISTER:  You know, when Jay-Z took the stage, everybody was so excited because that was also a surprise. It was not previously confirmed that he 
 
 and Beyonce would be there, but when he did take aim directly at the recording academy on the Grammy stage, the room was shocked. 
 
You actually heard an audible gasp, and we saw, you know, Beyonce even looked surprised by what he was saying, but of course, you know, he's 
 
 standing up for his wife. But Beyonce is the all-time Grammy winner. She has more Grammy Awards than anyone, but what Jay Z was saying is while she 
 
 does have all those Grammy Awards, she doesn't have an Album of the Year Award. 
 
So, you know, he meant to have a positive message, but it did shock the room probably even more than it shocked people at home. But as you said, so 
 
 many great performances, a huge night for women, a really amazing night of reuniting the old and the new. You had all of these legendary stars from 
 
 Joni Mitchell to Billy Joel and then younger stars like SZA and even Miley Cyrus who has been in front of our eyes since she was a little girl. 
 
But to see her win her first Grammy, which, it's hard to believe that's her first Grammy was a great moment. And on that Miley note, I loved when Miley 
 
 was up there with Mariah Carey. You could really feel her excitement and that kicked off the night and being there in the room, everybody was on 
 
 their feet cheering for Mariah when she came out. 
 
NEWTON:  Yeah, and I'm so glad you were there because we're really getting a sense of it and just from watching it, to me, it certainly had an 
 
 authenticity that maybe I haven't seen from these awards shows in the recent past. And do you think this has revived this kind of an awards show, 
 
 especially when the ceremony, pardon me, the performances and not the awards really took center stage? 
 <br>[12:55:00]
 
WAGMEISTER:  Absolutely, and you know, we have seen a trend of declining ratings across the board with award shows, but the Grammys last year, they 
 
 were actually up, and this year, as you said, so many huge performances from legends in the music world that it'll be interesting to see what the 
 
 TV ratings are, but it's all that anybody is talking about today. So, ratings aside, the impact is absolutely still there. 
 
NEWTON:  Elizabeth, so glad you were in the room. Get by your ticket for next year. Make sure you are sitting there again. Thanks so much, really 
 
 appreciate the wrap there. Now, a pianist is taking his music to new heights in Germany. Listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
NEWTON:  On-lookers in Munich who were in for an early morning treat as Swiss pianist, Alain Rocher, put on a show, yes, in midair. Your eyes are 
 
 not deceiving you. An illuminated grand piano hung from a crane as Rocher performed a piece called "Winter Solstice". 
 
Look at that sky, a piece he said was inspired by nature. Rocher plans to perform every morning before sunrise until the summer solstice. We can't 
 
 wait to see more of that. Incredible. That does it for us here on "One World". I'm Paula Newton. Thanks for watching. Amanpour is up next.
