CHRISTINA MACFARLANE, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: I'm Christina Macfarlane live from London. This is the CONNECT THE WORLD. Coming up this hour. 
 
 Fleeing Sudan. Thousands of people continue to leave the country amid a fragile ceasefire.
 
Kevin McCarthy addresses Israel's Parliament during his first trip abroad as U.S. House speaker. 
 
French protesters take to the streets for May Day demonstration's unhappy with the new pension reform.
 
And First Republic Bank becomes the second largest bank failure in U.S. history.
 
A perilous journey with a happy ending at least for those lucky enough to escape the fighting in Sudan. Evacuees from all over the world and making 
 
 the more than 800-kilometer journey across the desert to Port Sudan. From there, they're ferried across the Red Sea to Saudi Arabia. This is video of 
 
 American evacuees in Port Sudan boarding a U.S. ship for the trip to Jeddah. The New York Times reports American drones have been flying 
 
 overhead to monitor land convoys headed to Port Sudan.
 
Well, meantime, there's another extension of a 72-hour truce but smoke is rising over Khartoum and witnesses report more gunfire in the capital. 
 
 Doctors say more and more dead bodies lining the streets creating an environmental catastrophe. But we're covering all angles here with Larry 
 
 Madowo in Jeddah and David McKenzie is in Johannesburg for us. But let's go to Larry first in the port of Jeddah.
 
Larry, those there who have been evacuated are definitely the lucky ones. What have they been telling you about their escape and those that have 
 
 remained behind?
 
LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: There's a sense of relief, obviously, because they're safe. They're finally out of the conflict after making an 
 
 arduous journey from the capital Khartoum through more than 500 miles. It's over 830 kilometers to Port Sudan and then waiting, sometimes for days to 
 
 get on a ship to cross the Red Sea to here in Jeddah. There are also a lot of kids in the midst of it.
 
People who I just met a three-week old baby who was born at the beginning of this conflict. That wait an extra week to get a British travel document 
 
 for her. Her name is Nur, which means light and Arabic. So, these are the stories that you see so much about. When they get here to Jeddah, they 
 
 process a place like this, where the British or Australian or German or American embassy will look at their papers.
 
And then they go over to customs. You see over there, officials from the U.S. embassy who have been receiving them this morning, a big consignment, 
 
 a big ship run by the U.S. Navy came through here. The USNS Brunswick and they had mostly Americans, more than 105 Americans, more legal, permanent 
 
 residents as well as 24 Brits, for instance, people from other parts of the world.
 
And in the midst of that, there's still kids running around and playing and enjoying the moment, which is, I think, a good reminder that even in 
 
 through so much adversity and so much pain, children will be children. This innocence in the midst of it. They don't know how bad it's been for the 
 
 parents worried for them, worried about the bombing and the shelling and the gunfights and not sure if they're going to make it safely in that long 
 
 convoy from Khartoum to Port Sudan.
 
And then across the 10, 12-hour journey to Jeddah, we did that trip over the weekend with the Saudi Royal Navy, took a Navy warship to Jeddah and 
 
 then evacuated 52 people back. And that's the problem, even though there's so many of these shadows being run by the Saudis they can only take so many 
 
 people. There's a lot more important to them that are desperate to leave.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MADOWO: There's so many children who are having to live through this.
 
AMEL HAMIMY, SUDANESE EVACUE: Yes, a lot. And I have a lot of friends and family who like their kids are having like trauma from this and like 
 
 they're still -- there already came out Sudan but they're still having like, you know, how their heartbeat and like, you know, sweating when they 
 
 hear any sound on their like, wake up suddenly. Yes. They are very scared until now.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MADOWO: I just met a nine-year-old Omar Muhammad (ph) who told me he wants to be an astronaut. And I asked him if he's looking forward to going back 
 
 home. He said he never wants to see Khartoum again, because he's afraid that if he goes back, it might start all over again and they can't leave.
 <br>[10:05:03]
 
MACFARLANE: It is desperate, isn't it, Larry? Especially for children as you say a three-week-old there fleeing for their life and the lives of 
 
 their family at that time. Let's turn to David, in Johannesburg. David, the ceasefire we know was due to expire Sunday night has been extended another 
 
 72 hours. But what hope is there that this will be effective given we know it's been repeatedly broken in recent days?
 
DAVE MCKENZIE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: I think the hope is pretty limited. And has -- Larry has been reporting with the people 
 
 streaming out both foreign, nationals and Sudanese. You don't anticipate that stopping because the fighting hasn't stopped even if on paper, there 
 
 is a ceasefire. Now, it must be said there have been some periods of more calm than there has been fighting over the last few days. And that has 
 
 allowed people to stream out of the capital on buses and on planes from north of Khartoum from an airfield there, particularly British nationals.
 
But even this morning and into today, there are reports from CNN journalists on the ground of significant fighting north of the capital. 
 
 There's also been a sporadic fighting around the presidential palace in Khartoum. And it speaks to the overall very dicey situation for civilians 
 
 there. You mentioned the Sudan Doctors Union saying they were buddies on the street, also pointing to the fact that garbage hasn't been collected 
 
 and services haven't come through.
 
There is some sign that international aid is getting in dribs and drabs. And that's very significant. The World Food Program saying they're going to 
 
 be able to resume their operations in the country to feed those who are hungry after several of the staff members were tragically killed in the 
 
 opening days of this conflict. You've also had the International Committee for the Red Cross that is getting a second plane into Khartoum with vital 
 
 aid.
 
Over the last few days and over the weekend, we've been speaking to doctors within Khartoum who've run out of all kinds of critical supplies. So, you 
 
 know, while people who can afford it or have the support from their governments to get out of the country, those who are stuck in the country 
 
 are very much facing a terrible situation. Christina?
 
MACFARLANE: Yes, absolutely. David McKenzie there live from Johannesburg. Thanks, David to you.
 
Now, U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy making history just minutes ago addressing the Knesset Israel's parliament. This was the scene about an 
 
 hour ago when McCarthy entered the Knesset. This marks only the second time in history that a U.S. House Speaker has made such an address. Newt 
 
 Gingrich was the first to do so 25 years ago. McCarthy will be holding a news conference soon.
 
Our Hadas Gold has been covering this visit and joins us now from outside the Knesset. A significant day, a historic day, Hadas. Do we have any sense 
 
 of what the House Speaker has been saying in his opening speech?
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Yes, Christina. He actually just wrapped up his speech. And I'm standing in the room where the press 
 
 conference is expected to start any minute now. And for Kevin McCarthy, this was a very much a pro-Israel stump speech. He was invited as the 
 
 second speaker to ever address the Israeli parliament since Newt Gingrich in 1998. And it was actually his first trip abroad since being elected 
 
 speaker.
 
And despite the many controversies swirling around this Israeli government, whether it be the extreme right-wing ministers in positions of power to the 
 
 massive judicial overhaul that the Israeli government has now paused, Kevin McCarthy instead focused on the long-standing alliances between the U.S. 
 
 and Israel and the threats that are facing Israel and the United States.
 
Specifically, he said that as long as he is speaker of Congress, he will continue to fully fund the very big security assistance that the U.S. gives 
 
 Israel. And he says he will also do things like in trying to increase pressure in ways to support Israel in the national arena. He talked about 
 
 Iran. He also had some slight warnings to Israel about being careful about things like Chinese investment.
 
But overall, he talked about how Israel is a modern miracle. He talked about U.S. recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital. This is a much 
 
 different sort of tone than what we've been hearing recently. And the relationship between the Joe Biden administration and Israel. If you 
 
 remember, just a few weeks ago, President Biden scoffed at the idea that Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister will be invited to the White 
 
 House for a visit saying it wouldn't happen anytime soon.
 
President Biden saying he hopes Netanyahu walks away from this traditional overhaul plan. Instead, Kevin McCarthy yesterday saying that if Joe Biden 
 
 doesn't invite Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House anytime soon, Kevin McCarthy will invite Benjamin Netanyahu to address Congress with or without 
 
 a White House invitation. That will be a pretty significant event. McCarthy even joked in an interview with an Israeli newspaper that he's being 
 
 treated the same way as Netanyahu because McCarthy says he also hasn't been invited to visit with President Biden since he was elected.
 
So, it's been a very warm reception here right now. In the next few minutes, this will be the first time that McCarthy will be directly 
 
 questioned by members of the media.
 <br>[10:10:00]
 
So, there will likely be some tough questions from the media here about the U.S.-Israel relationship, about the current controversy surrounding the 
 
 Israeli government. But for Kevin McCarthy this was really for him an opportunity to highlight what he says is the longstanding friendship and 
 
 support of Israel. Christina?
 
MACFARLANE: Yes, Hadas. Those questions in the press conference likely to be more wide ranging and we will of course check back with you as and when 
 
 that press conference gets underway. But for now, Hadas Gold there live from the Knesset. Thank you.
 
Now unions are organizing protests today across Europe to mark International Workers Day. In France, we're seeing massive crowds still 
 
 angry about President Emmanuel Macron's pension reform. Some protesters in Paris and other French cities even clashing with police. The French 
 
 President's decision to raise the retirement age by two years unleashed a wave of strikes over the last few months.
 
It says the change which he signed into law last month was needed to keep the pension system running. Well, our Melissa Bell is live for us in Paris. 
 
 And Melissa, despite this pension reform set to become law, you are seeing their huge protests continuing. Tell us about what you've been seeing and 
 
 why people are continuing to protest, given the situation is now a foregone conclusion.
 
MELISSA BELL, CNN PARIS CORRESPONDENT: I think that's one of the issues here today, Julia, is that this is going to become law and from September, 
 
 the French are going to start seeing the difference in the amount of time they have to work before they can get their pension incrementally raised to 
 
 2030. And I think that's part of what's fueling the anger you're seeing on the streets of Paris today.
 
What we're showing you now is what's happening all along the head of the march. Letters it is and it's always tends to be the case of these marches 
 
 by the Black Bloc. These are the most extreme elements that seek confrontation with the police. So far, that's been pretty successful today. 
 
 Behind them are many more tens of thousands of protesters we expect on the streets today. The trade unions are out once again to make their anger 
 
 plain.
 
But we were always expecting today, Julia, to be particularly tense. The authorities were because of that convergence of the traditional May 1st 
 
 Labor Day protest. And of course, all the anger about the pension reform itself. And I think on both sides, there's a determination ready that today 
 
 should in a sense, from the point of view of the protesters be a barometer of the wider anger in the French population on the part of the government, 
 
 that this may be one last moment when they're out to vent.
 
And the government hopes put an end to it because remember, Julia, that this pension reform was one of the early ones in Emmanuel Macron's mandate, 
 
 second term, his determination is that there will be many more. The determination of the protesters is that that's not going to happen, Julia.
 
MACFARLANE: Yes. I mean, I suppose the hope with Macron is that these protests will begin to peter out. We have seen, Melissa, President Macron 
 
 out and about in recent weeks trying to address the issue. Trying to talk to the French people in wind back support. I mean, has he had any success 
 
 in that?
 
BELL: It's been pretty difficult for the French president to make himself heard above the din with the French reinventing, bringing back that very 
 
 ancient protest of the (INAUDIBLE) where they make as much noise as they can. It goes back to the 19th century, before that, medieval times. A 
 
 traditional French revolutionary noise that is made. And that's been chasing Emmanuel Macron around the country as he's tried to make his peace 
 
 in his case with the French public. 
 
And I think one of the things -- the thing -- that thing at the forefront of the minds of the protesters out here. I'll just show you the images, 
 
 Julia, if I may behind me because as you'll see, throughout the day, you're going to see a lot of the fires that are being led just behind the 
 
 protesters, perhaps you can see the smoke rising up from there. This is something we've seen a lot these last few weeks and we're likely to see a 
 
 lot more of today.
 
The determination I think of the protesters out here is also driven, Julia, by the knowledge that the wider public feels as strongly as it does. It is 
 
 62 percent of the French who are opposed to the pension reform. And one of the most interesting things is how -- what a great proportion of French has 
 
 actually increased in support of this protest movement. Despite all these many weeks of strikes, despite all these many weeks of inconvenience.
 
And indeed, some of these chaotic scenes that we've seen week out on the streets of Paris, Julia.
 
MACFARLANE: All right. So, Melissa Bell there in amongst the protesters on the streets of Paris. Melissa, thank you and do stay safe.
 
All right. Let's connect you to a story with huge ramifications for the banking and finance industries. For the third time, in just six weeks, 
 
 another American bank has collapsed. First Republic is now the second largest bank failure in American history. JPMorgan Chase will now buy most 
 
 of the bank's assets and assume its deposits.
 
Well, CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich is outside First Republic Bank in New York and joins me now live. Vanessa, it was only what? Six weeks ago, that 11 
 
 banks pitched in $30 billion of a lifeline for First Republic. 
 <br>[10:15:06]
 
And now we have the second biggest bank failure in history. Why is this happened again?
 
VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS AND POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: Yes. And as U.S. customers are going to bank branches around the country, including the 
 
 one behind me, it is now owned and operated by JPMorgan. This was a deal that came together late last night and was announced early this morning by 
 
 the FDIC. And we're learning new details about how this deal came to be.
 
Yesterday on Sunday, the FDIC held an auction for First Republic and JPMorgan was the top bidder. It then took 800 employees from JPMorgan as 
 
 well as others from the FDIC and Treasury to make this deal happen by early this morning. As part of the deal, JPMorgan is assuming the deposits of 
 
 about $92 billion. This means that if a U.S. customer is going into a First Republic Bank today, it is business as usual.
 
Your deposits are safe. They're also assuming $173 billion in loans and they're also paying the FDIC $10.6 billion to make this deal happen. But 
 
 this, as you mentioned, happened just weeks after a huge $30 billion cash infusion led by JPMorgan, we heard from Jeremy -- Mr. Dimon just a few 
 
 moments ago on the media call with JPMorgan. The CEO saying that he hoped that this cash infusion of 30 billion would help stave off this very issue.
 
But in the end, it was probably just a little bit of a stretch to get the bank through these last six weeks. But the big question here now is, is 
 
 this the last bank failure or is this a signal of more to come? Mr. Dimon saying on that call, again, that he believes that we may see one more 
 
 potential bank failure, but this is really the end of the road. He went on to say that he believes that the banking system is sound.
 
He also said that he does not believe this deal will have any impact on a recession nor did he go ahead and make this deal to stave off a recession. 
 
 Christina?
 
MACFARLANE: Yes. It'll be very interesting to see if this loss of confidence continues as you say. Vanessa Yurkevich live from outside the 
 
 bank there. Thank you very much.
 
All right. Still to come on CONNECT THE WORLD. A massive manhunt in the U.S. state of Texas for this man accused of killing his neighbors.
 
And just a little later. Why the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia are playing nice on the diplomatic front as Russia's war in Ukraine grinds on.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
MACFARLANE: Welcome back. In Cleveland, Texas. A massive manhunt is underway for a man accused of killing five people including a child.
 <br>[10:20:01]
 
Police say, Francisco Oropeza open fire after one of his neighbors asked him to stop shooting his gun outside his home because it was making his 
 
 baby cry. An FBI official says they have "zero leads on the suspects whereabouts." Authorities are offering an $80,000 reward for information 
 
 that leads to Oropeza's arrest.
 
The Honduran consulate in Houston is offering support to the families of the victims whose bodies will be repatriated to their native Honduras. 
 
 CNN's Rafael Romo has more from family members of the victims.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
RAFAEL ROMO, CNN SENIOR LATIN AMERICAN AFFAIRS EDITOR (voice-over): Francia Guzman says her daughter had a dream. Sonia Guzman left her native Honduras 
 
 for the United States in 2014, hoping to make enough money to build a house for her mother and her siblings because they didn't have a home they could 
 
 call their own.
 
We didn't have a house. We didn't have a place to live. We would go from one place to another and she didn't want that for her siblings, she said. 
 
 The 29-year-old Honduran immigrant is one of the five people murdered Friday night in Cleveland, Texas, in what authorities described as almost 
 
 execution style. Everybody was shot above the neck including Sonia Guzman's nine-year-old son identified as Daniel Enrique Laso-Guzman.
 
SHERIFF GREG CAPERS, SAN JACINTO COUNTY, TEXAS: I don't care if he was here legally. I don't care if he was here illegally. He was in my county. Five 
 
 people died in my county and that is where my heart is.
 
ROMO: Herman Guzman, the boy's uncle and his mother's brother says, everybody living up the house where the shooting happened were members of 
 
 the same extended family from Honduras.
 
We truly got along very well as siblings and we also truly got along very well with all of them as relatives, he said. I have no words to tell their 
 
 parents and siblings about what happened because this is very painful. Sonia Guzman's dream came true. With the money she made in the United 
 
 States, she was able to help her mother buy a home in the town of La Mision located in the Honduran province of Comayagua.
 
She never left me alone. It's very difficult to know that I won't hear her voice anymore, her mother says. She left full of excitement and now I'm 
 
 just hoping she will come back even if it is in a coffin so that I can say goodbye.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE) 
 
ROMO: In the middle of their pain. The family is asking for help to be able to transport the remains of their loved ones back to their native Honduras. 
 
 Sonia Guzman's mother told CNN that all she wants now is to be able to give their daughter and grandson a proper burial in the land where they were 
 
 born. Rafael Romo, CNN, Atlanta.
 
MACFARLANE: All right. Let's get you up to speed on some other stories that are on our radar right now. Boaters in Paraguay have elected Santiago Pena 
 
 of the ruling conservative Colorado Party as their new president. Pollsters have predicted a tight race since persistent corruption allegations have 
 
 eroded support for Pena's party. But he won easily with about a 43 percent of the vote.
 
Turkey says its forces have killed the head of ISIS in Syria. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says Turkish intelligence was tracking the man 
 
 learners Abu al-Hussein al-Husseini al-Qurashi for "a long time." The news comes ahead of Turkish elections later this month.
 
China's most famous destinations are being mobbed during the May Day holiday also known as the Labor Daybreak. State media reporting more than 
 
 214 million people will travel across the country and abroad during the five-day break that began on Saturday. This follows the end of three years 
 
 of strict pandemic controls.
 
The U.S. has sent in the troops to get Americans out of Sudan. We'll have the latest on evacuations and alive reports from the State Department 
 
 coming up.
 
And where Russian oil is proving too tempting for some Gulf countries despite U.S. objections.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:26:24]
 
MACFARLANE: Welcome back. I'm Christina Macfarlane in London. And you are watching CONNECT THE WORLD. For the third time in just six weeks, another 
 
 American bank has collapsed. First Republic has become the second largest bank failure in American history. JPMorgan Chase will buy most of the 
 
 lenders' assets and assume its deposits. Minutes ago, U.S.  Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy wrapped up a historic speech in Jerusalem.
 
He became the second U.S. Speaker of the House to address Israel's parliament, the Knesset. This three-day visit was McCarthy's first overseas 
 
 trip the Speaker of the House.
 
And here are your headlines this hour. Americans and others are arriving in Saudi Arabia after evacuating Sudan. Earlier today, the U.S. consul general 
 
 in Jeddah said a U.S. Navy ship carrying 100 Americans docked in the Saudi Port. Video shows people being screened by troops in Port Sudan before 
 
 crossing the Red Sea.
 
Well, for the latest on Washington's response to the conflict in Sudan, CNN's Kylie Atwood is joining us live from the State Department. And Kylie, 
 
 the U.S. have drawn some criticism for the way they have been evacuating their diplomats versus their response to the U.S. citizens on the ground in 
 
 Sudan. And what has been their strategy of any here to get people out?
 
KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, listen, what we heard from the Secretary of State last week was that the U.S. believes that 
 
 the way to essentially have a sustained capability to get Americans out of the country is through convoys overland. And so, they said that that is the 
 
 reason that they haven't organized U.S. government flights for those citizens that are still in the country, they think those are a bit more 
 
 dangerous.
 
And they also have allies that are doing those flights and allowing American citizens onto the flight. So, they are looking at these overland 
 
 convoys. For the first time over the weekend, there were two U.S. government organized convoys that left the country -- excuse me, that 
 
 headed out of the country to Port Sudan. Those were the first efforts that were actually completely organized for U.S. citizens by the U.S. 
 
 government.
 
We heard over the weekend, from the State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller describing essentially the support that they gave to those convoys, 
 
 you know, they were able to provide surveillance, running over the top of those to make sure that they didn't run into any violence along the way. We 
 
 don't know exactly how many Americans were part of each of these convoys that were taking these citizens to Port Sudan to get to a safer place.
 
Of course, out of the country, but what we do know from the State Department, as if they say they have facilitated the departure of nearly 
 
 1000 citizens from Sudan. So, essentially, what that means is that, you know, these convoys and other efforts with allies have meant that about 
 
 1000 U.S. citizens have gotten out of Sudan, with some kind of support from the U.S. government.
 
And what they say also is that there are fewer than 5000 Americans who have reached out for some kind of support in Sudan. Not all of those Americans 
 
 want to leave. And when you talk to State Department officials, they make it clear that some of these Americans are obviously, you know, also 
 
 Sudanese Americans. They want to leave one day. They might want to stay another day if the violence goes down in the areas where they're leaving.
 
But we'll have to continue to watch this space, because as you said, there had been some criticism that the U.S. government wasn't doing more for its 
 
 citizens when compared to the other countries that were providing these government sponsors flight out of the country.
 
MACFARLANE: All right. Kylie Atwood there live from the State Department. Thanks very much, Kylie. 
 
Now, Ukraine coming under a new wave of Russian bombardments. Officials say Moscow has launched its latest missile strikes on several eastern Ukrainian 
 
 regions injuring at least 34 people.
 <br>[10:30:00]
 
Right now, you're looking at video of what military officials say is Ukraine's air defense system above the capital of Kyiv intercepting 15 out 
 
 of 18 cruise missiles fired by Moscow. Russia, one of the world's biggest exporters of crude is also keeping an eye on the price of oil. Right now, 
 
 it's heading lower as investors await the U.S. Federal Reserve's latest rate setting meeting this week.
 
The Fed is expected to raise interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday. Concern over that is outweighing support for new oil 
 
 production cuts announced last month by OPEC Plus which includes Russia. Those cuts took effect today.
 
As you'll know from watching this program, Russia has been hit with Western sanctions intended to put a dent in the oil revenue that funds its war in 
 
 Ukraine. But some Gulf countries still like the look of cheap Russian oil. CNN's Eleni Giokos explains why.
 
ELENI GIOKOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia have been playing nice on the diplomatic front as Russia's war in Ukraine 
 
 rages on. While Moscow is under a plethora of sanctions due to its invasion, Russian oil is not banned and is still on the market and up for 
 
 sale. And it's business as usual in the region. Russia as part of OPEC Plus and one of the world's largest exporters of crude.
 
In December 2022, the G7 imposed a price cap on Russian crude oil at $60.00 a barrel in an attempt to curb government revenue that would ultimately 
 
 help fund its war.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ROBIN MILLS, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, QAMAR ENERGY: the intent of the sanctions on Russia was not to take Russian oil off the market. Unlike the 
 
 sanctions on Iran, it was to allow Russia to keep selling to avoid shortages and spikes in prices, but to try to cut the revenues going to 
 
 Russia. So, in that sense, it's entirely legitimate to buy discounted Russian oil.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GIOKOS: That means Russian oil is in the markets at an attractive and discounted price. The question is, who is buying it? China boosted imports 
 
 of Russian oil to an average of 1.9 million barrels per day in 2022, up 19 percent from 2021 according to the International Energy Agency. India too 
 
 is taking advantage of low prices, buying up cheap crude, but that comes at a price. Reputation of helping keep Russia's watch is full. And the U.S. 
 
 has made it clear. It's not happy. 
 
It doesn't want anyone to buy Russian oil refined or not. But the U.S. knows completely removing Russian oil from the market would tamper with 
 
 inflation and prices at the pump. Now according to a recent Wall Street Journal article, countries in the Gulf who would not normally purchase 
 
 Russian oil or taking advantage of discounted rates.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
MILLS: Fujairah which is a port on the east coast of the UAE is a very important oil bunkering port. So, it stores oil, it supplies or for ship 
 
 fuel. And there's a lot of Russian oil and often many other countries being stored there, traded there, and then sent off to other locations, whether 
 
 in Asia or Africa or elsewhere. And we've certainly seen more and more Russian oil turning up there because it's a very important transshipment 
 
 point and a shipper can then -- can sell on the oil to someone else and this is important for managing these complicated logistics that the price 
 
 cap imposes.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GIOKOS: According to Mills, the UAE and other Gulf nations can use the products domestically, while other outputs is freed up for exports selling 
 
 at higher market prices. That means Russian oil is ending up on the global markets. In a statement to CNN, the UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs said 
 
 the UAE strictly abides by U.N. sanctions and has clear and robust processes in place to deal with sanctioned entities.
 
Adding that the UAE will continue to trade openly and honestly with its international partners, and apply the applicable laws and regulations of 
 
 the geographies in which it seeks to do business.
 
And while no rules are being broken. The question now becomes, how does this bold move impact relations with the West? Eleni Giokos, CNN, Dubai.
 
MACFARLANE: Now tonight is the deadline for negotiations between the Writers Guild of America and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television 
 
 Producers. If they can't agree, writers of T.V. and movie scripts could walk out on Tuesday. The Guild wants to factor in the growth of streaming. 
 
 The Alliance represents the interests of studios including Amazon, Disney, Netflix and CNN's parent company Warner Brothers Discovery. The studios 
 
 maintain there are more projects for writers today than ever before. The last strike in 2007 lasted 100 days.
 
All right. Still to come. Tears at Anfield. Spurs fans had so many hopes but their luck ran out. So, what next for Tottenham?
 
And if you watch the crown series, you might think you're a royal expert. So, what do you know about the coronation of King Charles? Details after 
 
 the break.

MACFARLANE: Welcome back. We're now less than a week away from the coronation of King Charles III. The ceremony this Saturday will be 
 
 Britain's first in seven decades. Of course, it will have all the pomp and pageantry you'd expect as well as rituals dating back hundreds of years. 
 
 There will also be some notable differences compared to the coronation of his mother, Queen Elizabeth.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN ROYAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Not since 1953, that we had a glimpse of this sacred moment. The crowning of a monarch, Queen 
 
 Elizabeth, then just 27 thrust to the throne after her father's untimely death. Her coronation designed to introduce the young queen to the world 
 
 and give a morale boost to postwar Britain. 70 years on, and amidst the cost-of-living crisis, King Charles' coronation will have many of the same 
 
 traditions incorporated, albeit slightly toned down.
 
Up to 2800 guests in Westminster Abbey, CNN understands. Versus the 8000 who gathered for the late Queens.
 
ELIZABETH NORTON, ROYAL HISTORIAN: The King has actually ruffled some feathers by not inviting many members of the ancient nobility, including 
 
 some of the dukes in fact. But instead, actually the king is invited members of the community. So, charitable workers, for example.
 
FOSTER: A sign perhaps that Charles wants to make the monarchy more accessible, though much of the pomp and ceremony will of course remain.
 
He'll sit on the coronation chair used by monarchs for more than 700 years. And here we crowned with the St. Edward's crown, a gold velvet and jewel 
 
 and crusted (INAUDIBLE) weighing more than two kilograms. 
 
The coronation is first and foremost, a religious ceremony. It culminates in the king's anointing with holy oil, which has been consecrated in 
 
 Jerusalem.
 
NORTON: It seen as symbolizing the king's commitment to God because of course, he's a very religious man himself. He's now the head of the church 
 
 and it's a sacred moment.
 
FOSTER: His wife, Camilla, will also be anointed and crowned. Charles' sons William and Harry will be there. Although Harry's wife Meghan will remain 
 
 at home in California with their two young children.
 
It remains to be seen what role Harry will play in proceedings now that he's set back from his senior role duties.
 
FOSTER (on camera): For many in Britain. The coronation is about more than just another public holiday. There'll be street parties up and down the 
 
 U.K. and thousands will come here to Buckingham Palace to witness the famous balcony moments to see for the first time the newly crowned king and 
 
 queen.
 
FOSTER (voice-over): Many more will lie in the streets for the coronation procession just as they did for Queen Elizabeth seven decades ago. 
 <br>[10:40:10]
 
The king and queen will travel in this gilded carriage accompanied by a huge military procession. Nighttime rehearsals spotted in the streets of 
 
 London as the Capitol gears up for a moment in history.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE) 
 
MACFARLANE: Max Foster reporting there for us. And CNN will air special live coverage of the coronation of King Charles III on Saturday, May 6. CNN 
 
 Anchor Anderson Cooper will be live outside Buckingham Palace with analysis and reporting from CNN's Christiane Amanpour and Max. It all starts at 5:00 
 
 a.m. in New York, 10:00 a.m. in London, that's 1:00 p.m. in Abu Dhabi, right here on CNN.
 
Now prepare for a tale of rags to riches. Some back to rags again inside one Premier League match. This is exactly what happened to Tottenham. When 
 
 they clashed with Liverpool. Spurs found themselves three nil down then rallied up and it was all three all but that wasn't to be when Liverpool 
 
 scored again. And if that wasn't enough for one night, Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp found himself with a yellow card.
 
But why? World Sports Anchor Patrick Snell has more details. And Patrick, some are saying he was lucky not to get a red card in this incident.
 
PATRICK SNELL, CNN WORLD SPORT ANCHOR: Hi, Chrissy. Yes. Great to be on with you. Yes. When you look at the video, he's right in the fourth visual 
 
 space there. This all goes back to an incident in the build up to Spurs, leveler then the controversial remarks the clock made in connection with 
 
 the referee Paul Tierney as well. But I will say this about that video. Klopp himself saying hey, I guess I kind of got punished in the end because 
 
 look, he appears to pull the hamstring there, Chrissy.
 
Jurgen Klopp, perhaps not as young as he once was. Hey, none of us are but Klopp with a hamstring injury there. I guess he would rather -- he get the 
 
 hamstring injury right. The one of his players, Chrissy. World Sport in just a few moments from right now. Back to you.
 
MACFARLANE: Yes. As you say, at least it was off the pitch or not on the pitch here, Patrick. We'll have more to come. Look forward to seeing more 
 
 highlights from that game just after the break. Stay with us. "WORLD SPORT" coming up next with Patrick.
