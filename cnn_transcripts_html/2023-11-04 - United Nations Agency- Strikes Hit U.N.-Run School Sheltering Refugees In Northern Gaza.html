FREDRICKA WHITFIELD, CNN ANCHOR: Hello again, everyone. Thank you so much for joining us. I'm Fredricka Whitfield in Atlanta, alongside Wolf Blitzer in Tel Aviv. Wolf, we'll get to you in a moment.
 
We're watching several new developments across the Middle East, as Israel pushes forward with its war against Hamas.
 
Earlier today, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Arab foreign ministers in Jordan for a high stakes Summit. Blinken made it clear that now is not the right time for Israel to enter a ceasefire.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANTONY BLINKEN, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE: It's our view that a ceasefire now, it simply leave Hamas in place, able to regroup and repeat what it did on October 7th.
 
And you don't have to take my word for it. Just a few days ago, a senior Hamas official said that it was their intent to do October 7th again and again and again.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WHITFIELD: We're seeing more air strikes across Gaza today as Israeli forces close in on Gaza City. And significant developments at the Rafah Border Crossing between Egypt and Gaza.
 
A U.S. official says Hamas is now blocking foreign nationals from exiting Gaza, until Israel guarantees that ambulances from Gaza can reach the crossing. A source tells CNN, more than 700 people are waiting to cross into Egypt, including nearly 400 Americans. Wolf.
 
WOLF BLITZER, CNN HOST: Fred, thanks very much. We're continuing to watch major developments on the ground here in the region.
 
CNN International diplomatic editor Nic Robertson is joining us. He is right near the Israel Gaza border.
 
And Nic, earlier today, there was an explosion at a U.N.-run school in Gaza, which was serving were told as a shelter and a refugee camp in northern Gaza. So far, the IDF, the Israel Defense Forces, has not responded to CNN for comment.
 
But what more are you learning about that blast at the U.N. school?
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Yes. Wolf, the U.N. agency relief and humanitarian agency that runs it inside of Gaza, say that it was sheltering about 16,000 civilians, people often go to these un schools in Gaza to get away from the possibility of being hit by missiles, because they think that the schools are safe because the U.N.-run their designated and they're safe.
 
But what the U.N. is saying that in the sort of courtyard area where people had their tents pitched, that's where the missile struck, according to the U.N. And they say that 15 civilians were killed, 70 wounded.
 
This school, Al-Fakhoura School is in the Jabalia refugee camp. And, of course, in the past couple of days, there have been -- there have been strikes there that were the IDF was targeting Hamas control and command center, a commander in an underground bunker on another occasion.
 
And just yesterday, targeted a convoy of ambulances that the ICRC had said -- the International Committee for the Red Cross, who said was getting ready to be a humanitarian convoy to go to the south of Gaza.
 
But the IDF said, look, inside one of those ambulances there was Hamas operatives, or Hamas -- or Hamas weapons inside one of those ambulances. That said, that attack caused, again, 15 civilian deaths, and 80 civilian casualties.
 
So, again, to have something like this at a U.N.-run score in the Jabalia refugee camp, again, gets to the center of what Secretary of State Antony Blinken is talking about with counterparts from the region.
 
We've heard from the Egyptian foreign minister, saying that Israel's strikes at the moment are not a legitimate form of defense. And, of course, this is part of the conversation with Secretary Blinken -- we heard him saying that it's not time for Israel to have a ceasefire.
 
So, when you get a situation like that, again, in this school in Gaza today, it just, again, highlights the civilian casualty toll at a time when there is so much pressure increasing on Israel to call for a ceasefire. Wolf.
 
BLITZER: As you noted, Nic, the Israel has claimed responsibility for that strike in an ambulance convoy near Gaza's largest hospital, which cost several civilian casualties. We also saw a strike hit near the al-Quds Hospital in northern Gaza. What is the IDF saying about those two incidents?
 
ROBERTSON: Yes, about this strike near the al-Quds Hospital, there was video from there.
 <br>[13:05:03]
 
And the Hamas-run Palestinian health officials in Gaza, who give all the figures that we have that we can report in -- that come from Gaza say that there were 21 civilian casualties around the impact that was just outside the al-Quds Hospital.
 
Again, Palestinians talk about how they use the hospitals as a place to go that they think will be safer. And we heard from another hospital today in the northern part of Gaza, the al-Wafa Hospital. They say that there was an IDF strike there on their main generator.
 
They say they have 70 patients that they're treating in that hospital that they're now essentially unable to treat, because they don't have power from their main generator.
 
The IDF hasn't responded specifically to these incidents. But what the IDF has drawn attention to today is the humanitarian corridor they've opened from the north of Gaza to the south. They have told civilians to leave the north of Gaza.
 
And according to U.N. figures, between 800,000 and a million people have already done that have moved from the north of Gaza to the south. But this humanitarian corridor on the main highway, the Al Salahuddin Road runs north south in Gaza between 1:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. today.
 
The IDF had said, it was safe for civilians to travel with the IDF has now said, while a soldiers -- their soldiers were helping patrol that humanitarian route, they were targeted by mortars and rocket fire by Hamas, which shows you how tenuous and potentially dangerous not just for the IDF, but also for the civilians on these humanitarian corridors.
 
It's a very, very dangerous and precarious situation continues to be that way in Gaza and Hamas targeting IDF troops as they're trying to hold open a humanitarian corridor. Wolf.
 
BLITZER: It certainly very dangerous indeed. Nic Robertson, thank you very much. Stay safe over there in Sderot.
 
Hundreds of foreign nationals, including many Americans are so desperate to get out of Gaza right now. But a U.S. official says Hamas is now demanding guarantees that ambulances from Gaza will be allowed to reach the Rafah crossing before it allows any more evacuations.
 
And it comes as the White House says the U.S. embassy in Cairo has helped more than 100 U.S. citizens and families out of Gaza since Wednesday.
 
CNN's Melissa Bell is joining us now live from Cairo. Melissa, what can you tell us about this latest blockade?
 
MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, what it means, Wolf, is that the 700 or so people, including 400 Americans that had been due to get out today, they were on that list. We've seen those lists published now, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, today, that stop. They simply have been able to go to get out. No one has gotten out of Rafah today, ever since, as you say Hamas linked the ability of those foreign nationals to get through the Rafah crossing to get out of Gaza to the safe passage of ambulances from Gazan hospitals to the Rafah crossing.
 
This is -- ever since that strikes, just outside the Al Shifa Hospital yesterday that saw 15 people killed, a strike claimed by the IDF. Greater Palestinian health authorities and the Red Cross say that, that has been a convoy that it had been heading down to Rafah to take the wounded.
 
Very difficult to see how this can get unblocked from the start. The question of whether the Rafah crossing would be open to civilians, or be it only foreign ones was linked in negotiations by Hamas to the exiting of wounded Palestinians.
 
Initially, Hamas had wanted some of their wounded to be included in that deal. That fell through is unacceptable to Israel. It was all unblocked last Tuesday, which allowed all those civilians to get out including the 100 Americans that you mentioned, because Hamas back down and said, fine, they won't be Hamas fighters, but they need to be wounded Palestinians.
 
Since then, several dozen have gotten out. Now, that appears to have stopped.
 
Now, we've been hearing today from David Satterfield, the U.S. special envoy to the Middle East, feeling about -- speaking about the necessity not just to reopen Rafah in terms of people coming out and the aid getting in, but actually to see more points to south of Gaza reopen, given the humanitarian needs that are involved in that nearly million people that Nic just mentioned now in the south of Gaza. Fairly catastrophic situation for the civilians there. Wolf.
 
BLITZER: All right, Melissa, Thanks for that update. Melissa Bell in Cairo for us.
 
Right now, I want to bring in retired U.S. Army Brigadier General Mark Kimmitt for some analysis.
 
Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Arab foreign ministers earlier today in Jordan. He says Israel should not enter a ceasefire because that would only allow Hamas to regroup.
 
What did you make of that, General? What did you make of that statement? What a ceasefire only hurt Israel's goal of destroying Hamas?
 
BRIG. GEN. MARK KIMMITT (RET.), FORMER ASSISTANT SECRETARY, STATE FOR POLITICAL-MILITARY AFFAIRS: Well, Wolf, it's good to see that the administration did this flip flop. Of course, when Secretary Blinken came in, he was calling for humanitarian pause.
 <br>[13:10:00]
 
I think after consultation with both the Israelis and the Arab leaders, he recognized that this is not the time to do that. You're absolutely right this would.
 
I think after consultation with both the Israelis and the Arab leaders, he recognized that this is not the time to do that. You're absolutely right. This would give Hamas a chance to reorganize, particularly, since so many of their facilities had been bombed. It would give them a chance to repair their communications, probably build new headquarters, probably get some of their fighters out on these ambulances that they're demanding.
 
Allow them to continue firing on that humanitarian corridor to kill their own people.
 
So, yes, this is not the time for a ceasefire. But if they do agree, it would likely be a ground ceasefire, since the forces have already encircled Gaza City. But I don't see the idea of stopping their air campaign.
 
BLITZER: Yes. The Israelis out here are making it abundantly clear they are not going to accept any ceasefire at all, because that will just give Hamas an opportunity to regroup, and potentially come back and do what they did on October 7th, come in to Israel, and kill 1,400 people at those various communities along the border with Gaza/. And capture and bring back to Gaza what 241 or 242 hostages.
 
The Israeli military, again, called on Gaza residents to move south today, General, as it focuses this attention, it's offensive against Hamas in Gaza City, and northern parts of the enclave.
 
In your view, is the Israeli military doing enough to ensure that civilians are allowed to escape the war zone?
 
KIMMITT: Well, I think the important thing is -- I'm not on the ground, so, I can't really make a judgement. But we do have David Satterfield, one of our finest diplomats monitoring that. So, I'm going to defer to his view. And if he doesn't believe the IDF is not doing enough, that's when the United States ought to be putting pressure on the Israelis to allow that to happen.
 
BLITZER: As you know, the Israeli ground forces are closing in on Gaza City. What challenges will Israel likely face as they try to root out Hamas terrorists around that that whole area?
 
KIMMITT: Well, both you and Nic have been around this business for quite some time. You've seen Fallujah, you seen Mosul. You've reported on Aleppo. This is the tough this kind of fighting for ground forces to do. All the advantages is that they have tanks, long range artillery, long range anti-tank weapons. To a great extent, those capabilities are neutralized.
 
This is door to door, house to house, neighborhood to neighborhood. Significant number of casualties, and all of this is done with civilians in the area. I've never seen it done quickly. Fallujah took about nine weeks. Mosul took about nine months, and I would not expect the Israelis to do it any quicker.
 
BLITZER: Yes. I was in Fallujah and Mosul. I remember vividly what was going on then.
 
KIMMITT: Yes.
 
BLITZER: And one of the major complications, as you know, the Israelis have right now, all these underground tunnels that Hamas has built.
 
And presumably, some of those hostages are being held in those underground tunnels.
 
Back in 2014, I was the first journalist allowed to go into one of those tunnels that went in from Gaza into Israel. And it's a real complicating factor right now, isn't it?
 
KIMMITT: It certainly is. We talked about our times in Vietnam, when we sent specialized American troops into these tunnels that have been set up by the Viet Cong. We call them tunnel rats. And the amount of casualties that they took in trying to clear those tunnels was enormous on a relative basis to regular ground combat.
 
So, the Israelis will have to get into those tunnels. That's where the storage of supplies is. That's where the troops are. But unfortunately, it very well may be that that's where the hostages are.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
BLITZER: Yes.
 
KIMMITT: So, they've made urban fighting far more complicated by the presence of these tunnels. And that's why this is, as President Netanyahu -- Prime Minister Netanyahu says, this is going to be a long war if they are going to fight it.
 
BLITZER: Yes. That's what I was told the other day at a briefing with a senior Israeli military officer said, not days, not weeks, but months. This is going to go.
 
General Kimmitt, thanks so much for joining us. Appreciate it.
 
KIMMITT: You stay safe, Wolf.
 
BLITZER: All right, Fred, back to you.
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Wolf, happening right now in Washington, D.C. pro-Palestinian demonstrators are holding a rally to demand a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war.
 
You're looking at live pictures right now as the crowds grow before the event even officially begins. Organizers expect thousands to join in a march later on today as well, which ends with a visual right across the street from the White House. [13:15:00]
 
CNN correspondent Gabe Cohen joining us live from Freedom Plaza in Washington, D.C.
 
Gabe, tell us what's happening.
 
GABE COHEN: CNN CORRESPONDENT: Fred, I have to admit, I can hear you particularly well. The crowd has grown rapidly here in the last few minutes. You can see here, Freedom Plaza, now filled with these protesters, and even extends out into the streets behind me, shutting down several blocks here in D.C.
 
We just heard a speaker say that there are buses that haven't been able to get into this area with even more people who are coming. So, we do expect this crowd is going to grow even more.
 
Organizers said it would be the largest free Palestine rally in U.S. history. That remains to be seen. But we are going to see speeches starting in the next few minutes until 4:00 p.m. Eastern. And that's when these demonstrators are going to march, just a few blocks from where we're standing to the White House, where they're going to demonstrate there.
 
And what we expect to hear Fred in the speeches is more political pressure on President Biden to call for a ceasefire and break that unequivocal support that he and U.S. leaders have offered Israel up to this point.
 
We have heard, not just from people here, but congressional leaders like Rashida Tlaib, who said in a post yesterday in a video that if the president doesn't call for a ceasefire, potentially she and others could urge voters not to vote for him in 2024.
 
So, again, we're expecting more of that political pressure from speakers here today, Fred.
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Gabe Cohen, I will keep checking back with you there from the nation's capital. Appreciate it.
 
All right. Up next, from protests to threats. American college campuses are being challenged on how to handle today's social activism, as the conflict between Israel and Hamas escalates. We'll bring you the latest.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[13:21:03]
 
WHITFIELD: Cornell University officials announced classes will resume on Monday. CNN's Danny Freeman is on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania, which has also seen a major controversy surrounding the Israel-Hamas war. Danny.
 
DANNY FREEMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Fred. Listen, it's no secret that college campuses have really had a challenging and charged few weeks really across the country, but as you said, Penn and Cornell University, they really have been at the center of a lot of it.
 
Cornell canceling classes back on Friday after a student was arrested for making anti-Semitic threats towards other students. And that here at Penn, there is been a backlash from donors over an argument that the school has not done enough to protect students ready to fight back against anti-Semitism.
 
Well, both schools are here in Philadelphia, they're on the football field today, because it's the University of Pennsylvania's homecoming weekend. And there is clearly an effort to make a cheerful atmosphere.
 
We've been hearing the band play. We've been hearing cheers from inside the stadium. But this conflict and this tension is still very much on people's minds. Take a listen to one student we spoke with, and also one alum just moments ago.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
FREEMAN: Do you feel other students feel safe?
 
AHNGELIQUE DAVIS, GRADUATE STUDENT, UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA: I want to tell you they don't. Right now, I think people are unsafe emotionally at the pain of other people. Watching it, feeling it, and seeing it, is absolute trauma.
 
DAVID HARRIS, ALUM, UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA: I'm very uncomfortable with the anti-Semitism, and basically racism in any way is horrible. And it's really its own ignorance. And people are very, very uncomfortable.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FREEMAN: Now, here at Penn, just a few days ago, the president of the university actually announced an action plan to combat anti-Semitism. Saying, in a message to this large University of Pennsylvania community, "We must find and build common ground and be a community that sees, hears, and supports all of its members."
 
So again, an effort this weekend, definitely to put on a cheerful atmosphere, a fun atmosphere for homecoming. But these two universities that are playing on the football field, they have been through it the past few weeks. Fred?
 
WHITFIELD: Indeed. All right, Danny Freeman, thank you so much.
 
I'm joined now by Shamil Idriss, the CEO of research for common ground, a peacekeeping group based in Washington, D.C. So, great to see you.
 
I mean, to underscore all of this and the height in which this has reached, we're talking about a 21-year-old Cornell University junior, who was arrested and faces federal charges now in connection with online posts and threats against Jewish students.
 
So, you know, college campuses have long been a place, you know, to host and even foster social justice movements. So, is what we're seeing on campuses today over the Israel-Hamas conflict different or in step with historical conflicts on campus, in your view?
 
SHAMIL IDRISS, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, SEARCH FOR COMMON GROUND: Well, thanks for having me, Fred.
 
You know -- and yes, at Search for Common Ground, we've had a lot of experience with youth activism for social change. And as you point out, actually, whenever fundamental change, really fundamental, even radical change is needed on almost any social or political issue.
 
Young adults are almost always the ones to initiate it. And, you know, this is why they're oftentimes, you know, the big heroes of driving these kinds of changes. Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela, Gandhi, they all were called radicals, and they all really made their mark in their early 20s.
 
King was 26, when he led the bus boycott. Mandela was only 25 when he established the youth wing of the African National Congress, and Gandhi was only 24 when he established the Natal Indian Congress in South Africa before returning to India.
 
So, you're right. There is this -- there's not only a tradition, but it's almost a tautology it's almost always started by young adults.
 <br>[13:25:05]
 
Unfortunately, you know, what's happening on college campuses today in the U.S. is reflected of what's happening in our society more broadly. And so, young adults who are arriving on college campus today, who are growing up with an incredibly adversarial and hate filled political discourse, popular culture, certainly the social media that all of this generation has grown up with, doesn't prepare them particularly well, for what is for most of them -- the most diverse community there ever they've ever been a part of.
 
And so, yes, you have on the one hand, the horrible incidences that you talked about, violence, outright violence, vandalism, swastikas on Jewish center walls, on the campus, just a couple of miles from my home, and anonymous death threat against the Palestinian administration number.
 
And so, we are seeing that. I will say it is nonetheless gratifying that most of what we're seeing is not only non-violent, but it's not engaged in that kind of dehumanizing, threatening, doxing kind of behavior.
 
WHITFIELD: So, from many made reference to, you know, from civil rights movement, to Vietnam War, to LGBTQ, you know, related issues. You know, these movements are expressed on campus.
 
But now, particularly as we highlight the case, you know, out of Cornell, with an arrest involving a student facing a federal hate crime. I mean, is this just the beginning as this conflict in the Middle East seems far from over?
 
Or is it your worry or concern that there will, you know, be other incidents that rise to that level? IDRISS: Yes. I mean, I think, look, this war has been obscene from the very start. From the attacks, the slaughters committed by Hamas on October 7th, unspeakable attacks that were entirely unjustified.
 
And to, you know, 2,000-pound bombs being dropped this week on a refugee camp, densely populated urban centers. And as a result, we're not going to have, you know, pieces and just made in the antiseptic halls of, you know, the backrooms in Geneva or whatever. It's also made by people who are deeply affected, deeply traumatized by the violence, coming into contact with one another and figuring out a better way forward.
 
I am absolutely concerned, absolutely concerned that we'll see more extremist violence threats, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia. Unfortunately, Fred, you know, as I think, you know, and I think you've covered long before this war, we were already seeing years of increases in this kind of hate filled rhetoric on campuses and in our society more generally, here in the U.S.
 
So, this is only fueling that. But I do think it's very important to highlight those incidences which are actually in the majority, where not only have campuses done the right thing, in terms of a no tolerance policy for that kind of violence and intimidation.
 
But where oftentimes the campus and even the students have taken the lead in reaching out across the dividing lines. The Jewish students reaching out to Muslim students issuing joint statements of Muslim and Christian students reaching out to escort Jewish students who feel understandably uncomfortable on certain campuses right now.
 
And a lot of activism that isn't reported on as much as the -- as the -- as the hate filled activism that we really need to support and amplify.
 
WHITFIELD: Quickly, is there something different that you think leadership on college campuses should be doing to get ahead of what is likely to be, you know, more, I guess, conflict of opinion?
 
IDRISS: Yes. I think there are two things that campuses have to do. And the fact that we quickly set up a resource center, not even just with their own resources, just for anyone who wants to help address this issue, campusunite.org with some of the resources that we've seen out there that help colleges to do this.
 
They have, on the one hand, absolutely have to do everything to prevent the violence, intimidation, vandalism intended to threaten or intimidate. And when those things regrettably do happen to respond to them in a way that first and foremost takes care of the vulnerable communities and make sure that they have that solidarity from the campus leadership, you know, the university leadership in all those students.
 
And in addition to doing that, they really have to, you know, you're inheriting students coming in from such an adversarial political discourse in our country, you have to give students the experience and invest in them, train them to actually engage in civil discourse. And I will just say to you, the campuses that have done that, some of the tools that they've used are at that campusunite.org site, they are not seeing nearly the same kind of vitriol played out in the way that it is on campuses that haven't prepared in that way.
 
I'll end with one thing. You know, the -- one thing that we've seen with college students everywhere is that the single most important experience for them to have in order to embrace being a constructive member of their diverse campus is not the experience of being agreed with all the time.
 <br>[13:30:01]
 
It's actually the experience of being heard and respected. What people do when they don't feel heard and respected is they double down all the more. 
 
If you can give students the experience and the skills to facilitate those kinds of conversations, they can actually lead the way and drive some of the fundamental change that on this conflict is really needed. 
 
FREDRICKA WHITFIELD, CNN HOST: Shamil Idriss, thanks so much for being with us.
 
IDRISS: Thank you.
 
WHITFIELD: U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is meeting with Arab leaders from Jordan and Egypt today after meeting with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday. What those leaders are saying about the escalating conflict, next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
WOLF BLITZER, CNN HOST: CNN was part of the first group of foreign press granted access to Israeli forces inside Gaza. 
 <br>[13:34:57]
 
Journalists embedded with the IDF in Gaza operate under the observation of Israeli commanders in the field and are not permitted to move unaccompanied within the Gaza Strip. 
 
As a condition to enter Gaza under IDF escort, outlets have to submit all materials AND footage to the Israeli military for review prior to publication. 
 
CNN has agreed to these terms in order to provide a limited window into Israel's operations in Gaza.
 
Here's CNN's Jeremy Diamond from inside Gaza. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT: We're right now at an Israeli military post inside the Gaza Strip about one kilometer inside of Gaza. Gaza City is just this way. As you can hear behind me, there is a lot of ongoing fighting between
 
 Israeli forces and Hamas militants. What they're trying to do right now is to flank the Hamas positions. That's what the battalion commander just told me. 
 
All of this intended to try and cut off Gaza City from the southern part of the strip as Israeli forces also move in from the north. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BLITZER: We're going to have much more of Jeremy's reporting from inside Gaza in the hours ahead, including in the next hour right at the top. 
 
Meantime, today, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with officials from several Arab countries in Amman, Jordan, to discuss the situation inside Gaza. 
 
CNN's Jennifer Hansler was also on the scene for us. She's traveling with the secretary of state. She's joining us live. 
 
Jennifer, the Arab foreign ministers are calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. What has Secretary Blinken said? 
 
JENNIFER HANSLER, CNN STATE DEPARTMENT REPORTER: Well, Wolf, Secretary Blinken continues to maintain his opposition to a ceasefire in Gaza at this time. 
 
He says the U.S. assesses this will give Hamas time to regroup and potentially attack Israel yet again. 
 
It puts him at odds with almost everyone who sat at that table with him today. You heard from foreign ministers from Jordan and Egypt. 
 
Egypt, who has called for a humanitarian ceasefire citing the humanitarian toll on the ground in Gaza. 
 
And Secretary Blinken sought to emphasize that they are on the same page about trying to stem that toll but they need to do through humanitarian pauses.
 
It's important to note, Wolf, that Blinken really did try to downplay the differences in opinions between the U.S. and their partners, saying they agreed ultimately that they have the same objectives but not the same means of getting there. 
 
He also said they did agree to try to stem any further escalation of this war. 
 
This is what he said at a press conference after that summit. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANTONY BLINKEN, SECRETARY OF STATE: Throughout this conflict, countries across the Middle East and beyond have played an essential role in preventing its spread. Today, we all agreed on the importance of using our respective
 
 influence and capabilities to deter any state or non-state actor of opening another front in this conflict or taking other destabilizing actions. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HANSLER: We also saw Blinken this morning meet with the acting prime minister of Lebanon, the caretaker prime minister, to emphasize his concern about the skirmishes we've seen between southern Lebanon and Israel. And emphasizing the need for the conflict not to spread onto Lebanon soil.
 
Yesterday, we saw the heard of Hezbollah, Nasrallah, sort of take a medium stance here on the conflict and didn't necessarily commit to getting involved here. 
 
So the U.S. is trying to take advantage of this window to keep any conflict from spreading here -- Wolf? 
 
BLITZER: Jennifer Hansler, reporting for us from Amman, Jordan, thank you very much. 
 
Israel's blood supply has certainly become a critical resource, especially during wartime. This can help determine if a person lives or dies. 
 
I visited what is believed to be the only shielded underground blood bank in the world right here in Israel where the country's entire blood supply is tested and processed. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BLITZER (voice-over): On the surface, it looks like an ordinary office building, but it's what lies beneath that makes this facility one-of- a-kind. 
 
PROF. ELAT SHINAR, DIRECTOR, MDA NATIONAL BLOOD SERVICES DIVISION: You can't really live without blood, and there's no artificial blood. 
 
BLITZER: Just outside of Tel Aviv, nearly 50 feet below ground, lies what is believed to be the world's only shielded underground blood bank. 
 
SHINAR: All the blood comes here, and we process it. 
 
BLITZER: Israel's entire blood supply is processed and tested here at the Marcus National Blood Services Center operated by Israel's Magen David Adom. 
 
SHINAR: The whole idea of this place is because we built in a shelter. So, we are now actually in the shelter and the convention -- 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
BLITZER: Below -- deep underground. SHINAR: Yes. 
 
BLITZER: Because this, presumably, would be a major target for Israel's enemies? 
 
SHINAR: Absolutely. And we were very concerned about the people who work, and the blood, of course, the blood inventory. In the case of sirens now, the rocket attack, we are protected. It's a shelter. 
 
BLITZER: The organization actually moved into the building on October 9th, just days after the Hamas terror attacks. It is now more vital than ever in a country at war. 
 <br>[13:40:06]
 
SHINAR: We receive blood to all the hospitals and to the army. 
 
When we evacuate the patient, either the civilian or the military ambulances or helicopters, they get blood on the way to the hospital already, provided by us. 
 
BLITZER: They are three levels underground, each level more secure than the next, and all designed to operate even if there is a direct attack. 
 
On the first level, they sort, label and test the blood. 
 
SHINAR: So, we are now in the testing laboratory, which we call the mega lab. The idea is, they put all the tubes in here, and everything is automated. It is like hands off. 
 
BLITZER (on camera): So, this is a state-of-the-art technology. 
 
SHINAR: Absolutely. Absolutely. 
 
Then the results are transmitted to the main computer system, to boost the file of the unit, and the file, it will be known. 
 
Here, you can see they are waiting for their turn. And once they can go on, they will go in. 
 
BLITZER (voice-over): The center handles more than blood. They also handle plasma. Plasma is used to increase volume when someone has lost a lot of blood. It is stored frozen. 
 
(on camera): It's cold. 
 
SHINAR: Too cold, minus-30 degrees. 
 
BLITZER: So cold. 
 
(voice-over): Running all this requires electricity, which is why the lowest level is key to the operation. 
 
(on camera): So, where are we going now? 
 
SHINAR: Now we are going to the minus-three, the most protected place in the building. 
 
BLITZER: The lowest level. So, we will be deep underground. 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
BLITZER: So, if the enemy of Israel were launching rockets or bombs, and hit the top, people in this building would be safe? 
 
SHINAR: Absolutely.
 
BLITZER: The whole building is like a bomb shelter. 
 
SHINAR: The blood will be safe. Everything that we do would be safe. 
 
BLITZER: The blood would not be destroyed. 
 
(voice-over): The power for the whole operation is protected by enormous blast doors that are some of the largest in Israel. 
 
MOSHE NOYOVICH, PROJECT DIRECTOR, MARCUS NATIONAL BLOOD SERVICES CENTER: In an emergency, when we get an alert from the IDF, we close the blast doors. 
 
BLITZER: Professor Shinar says, this facility IS so deep underground, it can withstand a chemical attack, poison gas or biological attack, protecting lifesaving blood and plasma for a country at war. 
 
(on camera): We are very deep below the ground. 
 
SHINAR: Yes.
 
BLITZER: So, it's very secure. God forbid, if a bomb -- 
 
SHINAR: Absolutely. 
 
BLITZER: -- this would be fine.
 
SHINAR: Yes. And you can look to the window, we talked about windows, OK? 
 
BLITZER: Yes.
 
SHINAR: The outer window is a shelter window, which would close. 
 
BLITZER: So, it's secured. 
 
SHINAR: Yes, in peacetime, we can open it so daylight can come in. 
 
BLITZER: This is not peacetime now. 
 
SHINAR: Absolutely. 
 
BLITZER: No.

BLITZER: Very impressive facility, indeed. 
 
Happening right now, by the way, GOP candidates are speaking to voters at the Florida Freedom Summit. We're going to go there for a report when we come back. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[13:46:42]
 
WHITFIELD: GOP presidential candidates are in Kissimmee, Florida, today, at the Freedom Summit. 
 
And already fireworks with hopeful, Chris Christie, responding to boos, saying their, quote, "anger against the truth is reprehensible." 
 
Christie is among the most vocal of opponents against former President Trump. 
 
Other notable speakers at the summit today, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, lawmakers, Matt Gaetz and Byron Donalds. 
 
Joining me is CNN reporter, Alayna Treene, who is at the summit. 
 
So, Alayna, Christie did not back down at all, did he? 
 
ALAYNA TREENE, CNN REPORTER: No, Fred, he did not. I have to say today is really a summit - I apologize for me speaking quietly there, speaking behind me right now.
 
But today is an opportunity for all of the Republican primary candidates, the ones that are here, to make their case to Florida voters. 
 
We've heard from many of them already today. Former Governor Hutchinson from Arkansas. Chris Christie and Doug Burgum. Two of them, Burgum and Hutchinson, were repeatedly and loudly booed for speaking negatively about Donald Trump. 
 
I think that shows you how pro-Trump this crowd is. They really did not want to hear much of what they had to say, particularly when it was negative about the former president. 
 
Let's listen to what they said and the response from the crowd. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHRIS CHRISTIE, (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: What a shock you're for Trump. I'm going to fall over dead. 
 
The problem is you fear the truth. 
 
(BOOING)
 
CHRISTIE: The problem is you want to --
 
(BOOING) CHRISTIE: -- shout down any voice that says anything different than what you want to hear. 
 
ASA HUTCHINSON, (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I can say that there is a significant likelihood that Donald Trump will be found guilty by a jury on a felony offense next year. 
 
(BOOING)
 
(SHOUTING)
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TREENE: Now, Fred, we are currently hearing from Casey DeSantis, the first lady of Florida, and the Governor Ron DeSantis is going to be speaking here shortly. 
 
Then later today, we will hear from former President Trump, who will be headlining this summit. 
 
I have to say this crowd is -- again, even though they're hearing from all of these different candidates, they're really focused on DeSantis and Donald Trump, the two candidates from Florida. 
 
I think when DeSantis takes the stage shortly, he has a challenge ahead of him. He needs to try to draw support away from Donald Trump, especially away from donors who in recent weeks have been flocking to the former president. 
 
I think you're going to hear him really hammer in on his record here in Florida and try to make the case for why he is a better candidate than the former president. 
 
But of course, he has to thread a very careful needle, because a lot of people in this room are fans of Donald Trump. They do not want to hear DeSantis speaking negatively about him or he could be booed like some of the other candidates today. 
 
So we're going to hear him shortly after Casey DeSantis leaves this stage. I think you're going to hear a big call for them to rally around him and his record in Florida. 
 
I do think you're going to see some cheers. We've heard many cheers from DeSantis supporters in the room. Holding signs saying, "This is DeSantis country." So a lot more to come shortly -- Fred? 
 
WHITFIELD: All right, Alayna Treene, keep us posted. Thanks so much.
 <br>[13:50:02]
 
We'll be right back. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BLITZER: A Palestinian-American family in mourning after 42 of their relatives were killed by airstrikes in Gaza. In just one day's time, three generations of this family were gone, the youngest among them just 3 months old. 
 
Some images you're about to see are disturbing. 
 
CNN's Isabel Rosales brings us their story. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
ISABEL ROSALES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A crowd of neighbors and survivors working together to bury loved ones. Wrapped in white burials shrouds, their bodies are carried and lined up inside a mass grave. 
 <br>[13:55:01]
 
They belong to one family. 
 
Thousands of miles away in the U.S., family members across three states are united in grief. 
 
EYAD ABU SHABAN, 42 RELATIVES KILLED IN GAZA: I am still in this nightmare. I'm still not -- I haven't woke up yet.
 
ROSALES: In Florida, Eyad Abu Shaban cannot bear the unimaginable loss. 
 
ABU SHABAN: That's my cousins.
 
ROSALES: Three generations gone in a single day. Back-to-back airstrikes, the families says, in Gaza killing 42 relatives, the youngest is 3-month-old, Abu Shaban tells CNN. 
 
A video shot by a neighbor shows charred ruins and rubble, all that is left of the family compound. 
 
ABU SHABAN: We have never seen in this day and age where the whole world is watching innocent people are being torn apart, whole families just being wiped off the map. 
 
ROSALES: The family blames the deaths on Israeli airstrikes. 
 
CNN cannot independently confirm that. 
 
Israel has launched numerous airstrikes on Gaza City since the terror attacks on October 7th, including multiple strikes in the area that day. 
 
The Israel Defense Forces did not comment on the purported airstrikes. 
 
ABU SHABAN: I mean, in my family, we have no Hamas members. They are just ordinary people, grandmothers and grandfathers and uncles and aunts and children. I mean, if you want to exterminate Hamas, you should go to the source. 
 
ROSALES: Among the dead, four brothers, all doctors. Family members say they operated the largest network of family owned eye clinics. 
 
An independent journalist on the ground captured the aftermath and the moment survivors pulled body after body from beneath the rubble.
 
Including Mona Abu Shaban's uncle, his wife and son. The three had recently left their home in a different part of the city to stay at the compound, Mona says. 
 
MONA ABU SHABAN, 42 RELATIVES KILLED IN GAZA: Their previous home where they were before, they were told to evacuate so they assumed they would be safe, so they went to a safe area, a safehouse, basically. 
 
ROSALES: Watching from afar in Ohio, Mona is pleading not only for a ceasefire, but long-term action. 
 
M. ABU SHABAN: No. We cannot say that if people stop bombing that it's over. You have to give them, you know, their dignity. You have to give the Palestinians a place to call home. 
 
ROSALES: In Minnesota --
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
ROSALES: -- committee members fill up an Islamic center, praying in support of the family.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
ROSALES: In the face of so much loss -- 
 
M. ABU SHABAN: The family has no time to properly mourn. 
 
ROSALES: -- overcome by constant worry for the more than two million Palestinians in Gaza caught in the crossfire.
 
ABU SHABAN: There is a sense of helplessness. There's no -- the only thing we can do is pray.
