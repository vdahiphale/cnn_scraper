UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over):  Live from CNN Center, this is CNN NEWSROOM with Laila Harrak. 
 
LAILA HARRAK, CNN ANCHOR (voice-over):  Hello and welcome to our viewers here in the United States and all around the world, I'm Laila Harrak. 
 
Ahead on CNN NEWSROOM, from a historic win and celebrations to heartache and tributes for a sporting world legend, we will break down all the highs and lows from the World Cup in Qatar. 
 
Plus, part of a cliff collapses onto a beach in California, as millions nationwide brace for a storm system that could bring more danger ahead. We're live at the CNN Weather Center with the latest. 
 
And NASA's historic Artemis mission is coming to a close. In the coming hours, the unmanned spacecraft will make its return after going further into space than any spacecraft before. 
 
(SPORTS) 
 
HARRAK:  As the World Cup continues, journalists are mourning one of their own. U.S. reporter Grant Wahl died doing what he loved, covering soccer. He collapsed at the Argentina-Netherlands match on Friday. The 49-year old had spoken days before, feeling unwell. But the cause of death remains unclear. 
 
FIFA is among those honoring Wahl. Flowers and a picture of the journalist were placed in the media section ahead of the England versus France match on Saturday. While Wahl was passionate about soccer, he wasn't always a fan of FIFA. He was critical of corruption at the organization. 
 
He also opposed Qatar hosting the tournament over its human rights record. He was detained last month in Qatar wearing a shirt in support of LGBTQ rights. 
 
CNN Medical analyst Dr. Leana Wen spoke to CNN about Wahl's death and what, if any, ties it may have to symptoms he reported earlier. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DR. LEANA WEN, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST:  There is so much that we just don't know, we heard about his sudden collapse. 
 <br>[04:05:00]
 
WEN:  We heard about this viral illness that preceded it. But we don't know whether these two things are necessarily related.
 
People get viral illnesses all the time. This is the season when many people have colds or the flu or other things. And especially for somebody who's generally young, and what it sounds like pretty healthy. It's extremely rare for them to die, much less to die suddenly from that viral illness.
 
And also for people who do die, it ends up -- it's not usually sudden. In fact, there is gradual deterioration, somebody may be getting short of breath, they're in the hospital, et cetera. So that sudden death, it could be related. 
 
I mean, there is -- there are possibilities, maybe the viral illness, and we don't know this, but maybe the viral illness somehow affected the heart in some way.
 
But there are other possibilities, too, including whether the sudden death could be caused by a sudden heart rhythm problem or a heart attack or a blood clot. Again, we just don't know. And again, it's just so tragic at this point.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK:  The Biden administration is also reacting to Wahl's death. CNN's Arlette Saenz has details from the White House. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  The White House offered condolences to the family of Grant Wahl and also detailed some of the contacts the Biden administration has had with his family and officials in Qatar, where he passed away while covering the World Cup. 
 
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre tweeted on Saturday saying, quote, "Grant Wahl was an inspiration to many. Our thoughts are with his wife, Dr. Celine Gounder, and those who loved him. 
 
"State Department officials are in touch with Grant's family and with senior officials in the government of Qatar to ensure his family gets the support they need." 
 
This statement largely mirrored what we heard from the State Department, which said they had been in close communication with Wahl's family as well as officials in the country. 
 
It's also worth noting that Dr. Celine Gounder, the wife of Grant Wahl, has very close ties to this White House. She served on the coronavirus advisory board for then president-elect Biden during the transition period. 
 
So certainly many of the thoughts here at the White House are with Celine Gounder and her family as they mourn the passing of Grant Wahl and wait to learn more details about his death -- Arlette Saenz, CNN, the White House.

HARRAK (voice-over):  Here is a moment the rocky wall came crumbling down. Luckily no one was injured but the massive collapse forced the closure of a beach.

HARRAK:  Meantime, a major storm -- winter storm is pummeling parts of the Western U.S. with heavy snow and rain. At least 9 million people in more than a dozen states are under storm alerts through Monday. Flood warnings are up for parts of California, while some places in the Sierras can expect as much as 5 feet of snow.

HARRAK:  WNBA star Brittney Griner continues to undergo a medical evaluation at a U.S. Army hospital in Texas following her 10-month detention in Russia. 
 
Griner's wife posted an update on Saturday saying in part, "As BG and I started our journey to heal our minds, body and spirits, I want to personally say thank you to some of the hands, seen and unseen, that helped make it possible for me to see my wife again."
 
Cherelle Griner also called for imprisoned American Paul Whelan and others to be brought home. The Biden administration says it tried to include Whelan in the prisoner swap with Griner but Russia refused. 
 
In Los Angeles, Karen Bass is set to make history as the city's first female mayor. She will also be the first woman of color in the post. Bass will be sworn into office later today by Vice President Kamala Harris. 
 
Harris also endorsed Bass during her campaign. Bass' six-term congressman was on President Biden's short list for a running mate during his 2020 campaign. Bass has said that tackling Los Angeles homelessness issue is her top priority in her first 100 days. 
 
Saturday was winter graduation day at the University of Idaho, the school attended by four college students, who were killed last month. The ceremony, normally an occasion for celebration, had a somber feeling. There were tributes to the four young people found stabbed to death in their off-campus home, including a moment of silence. 
 
Investigators say they're making progress and sorting through thousands of tips but no arrests have been made. They're asking for the public's help finding a white Hyundai Elantra spotted near the victim's home on the day of the killings.

HARRAK:  The European Union is moving to give Ukraine a headstart in future reconstruction on Friday. The E.U. Council approved more than $18 billion  in loans for Ukraine's short term financial needs. And that includes repairing its infrastructure and making the first steps toward postwar reconstruction. 
 
Help is also coming from Norway, which is pledging $100 million for fixing up Ukraine's energy system. We're getting reports that Ukraine is firing back after Russia knocked out power to the city of Odessa. 
 
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Iranian made drones hit key power facilities around the city on Saturday, leaving it largely in the dark. This is how he described the situation in his evening address. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  The key for today is energy. The situation in Odessa region is very difficult. After the night strike, the strike by Iranian drones, Odessa and other cities and villages in the region are in the dark. 
 
As of this time, more than 1.5 million people in the Odessa region are without electricity. Only critical infrastructure is connected and as much as it is possible to supply electricity. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK:  But now, Ukraine says, its missiles later hit the occupied city of Melitopol. A Russian news agency says the same happened in the Russian held Eastern Ukraine, while unconfirmed social media reports are describing widespread explosions across the Crimean peninsula. 
 
Our reporters are standing by. Barbie Nadeau is in Rome. But, first, we go to Sam Kiley in Kyiv. 
 
Sam, what's the situation like there on the ground?
 
I understand Ukraine has been launching attacks on self proclaimed Donetsk and occupied Melitopol. 
 
SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  The most significant new development, really, is these attacks on Melitopol, which, unusually, has been confirmed by both sides. 
 
Of course, there is a lot of disinformation but we have now got the confirmation that Melitopol, which is an important town strategically in Russian hands, one of the cities taken early on in the Russian campaign, it's been a hot bed of resistance against the Russian occupation. 
 
It has a mayor and other administration outside of the city still being sponsored effectively by the Ukrainians. And it also is likely to be a significant target if the Ukrainians launch an offensive in the southern sector. 
 
They haven't been; it is expected that had they may well do that, particularly if they could take the pressure off the east of the country, where fighting is intense around Bakhmut. 
 
Also they're hitting at the Crimean Peninsula illegally annexed by Russia in 2014. That has been the target of successive Ukrainian attacks over the last few months. 
 
But they are intensifying, as it seems that the Ukrainians are getting more confident and perhaps more able to actually produce their own missiles and drones capable of reaching now deep into Russian-held territory to go after some of those more strategic locations, such as the port in Crimea and also potentially airports. 
 
HARRAK:  Sam, we heard President Zelenskyy describe the situation in Odessa as very difficult. 
 <br>[04:20:00]
 
HARRAK:  Ukraine's power infrastructure, we understand, continues to be targeted. 
 
Is there any power in Odessa?
 
KILEY:  At the moment there is, according to the government; only essential services are being powered in Odessa following these latest airstrikes by, the Ukrainians say, Russian drones. 
 
Odessa has so far been spared a lot of the worst of these attacks on the infrastructure, the energy infrastructure of Ukraine. The country suffered at least eight mass attacks by drones and cruise missiles. 
 
It had been assumed by the Ukrainians that perhaps the Russians were running out of these missiles; in particular, running out of these cheap Ukrainian-made drones. But it would appear that they've used about 15 in this latest attack on Odessa. 
 
The Ukrainians say they shot down 10 of them. But of course, if you send enough into the air, they can overwhelm the air defenses. And of course, again, the Ukrainians constantly are asking now for more and more air defenses in order to keep these sorts of attacks at bay. 
 
So that places like Odessa can continue to be spared what is potentially catastrophic outage. The Ukrainians also are very quick usually to repair things. So I imagine by the end of the day, they will have most of the power to Odessa back up and running. That has been the pattern in the past. 
 
HARRAK:  Sam Kiley reporting from Kyiv, Ukraine, thank you for your continued coverage. 
 
Let's go now to Barbie Nadeau in Rome. 
 
Norway and the E.U. freeing up funds to help Ukraine. 
 
What more have you learned?
 
BARBIE NADEAU, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  It's interesting because this isn't military aid, we are talking about this $18 billion package. This is for post-war rebuilding and restructuring. 
 
And a large chunk from Norway with its $100 million pledge goes directly to infrastructure. Something that President Zelenskyy was very much appreciative, let's hear what he had to say about it. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ZELENSKYY (through translator):  There is a new support package from this country in the amount of $100 million and precisely for the restoration of our energy system after these Russian strikes. 
 
I thank all Norwegians for this decision. I'm thankful to the government. In general we receive defense, economic and very important political support from Norway, as well as a lot of humanitarian assistance. Norway also helps with the purchase of gas. We will work together on the reconstruction of Ukraine. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NADEAU:  And, you know, that's really, really important, because this is really looking beyond the war now. We're looking at, you know, Europe says they are not going to abandon Ukraine. They want Ukraine to be part of the European community to some extent. And that's something that is forward-looking. 
 
Again, this isn't military aid; this is restructuring money that's going to go to the future of Ukraine, not the present right now. 
 
HARRAK:  Barbie Nadeau, thank you so much. 
 
Convicted Russian arms trafficker Viktor Bout, now back in Russia, is voicing his full-throated support for Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, saying he would volunteer if he could. 
 
Bout had been serving a 25-year prison sentence in the U.S. when he was set free on Thursday in a controversial swap for American basketball star Brittney Griner. Many U.S. officials opposed the trade, fearing Bout would use his trafficking skills against Ukraine and the West. 
 
A Russian lawmaker said on social media that the first thing Bout asked him was, "How can I help Donbas?"
 
A Russian Nobel Peace Prize laureate is blasting president Vladimir Putin and his invasion of Ukraine. Yan Rachinsky is the chairman of the Russian human rights group Memorial. 
 
At an award ceremony in Norway on Saturday, he slammed Russia's, quote, "insane and criminal war."

YAN RACHINSKY, CHAIRMAN, MEMORIAL (through translator):  In Russia, hatred is incited against Ukraine. Its culture and language are publicly declared inferior and the Ukrainian people are deemed not to have a separate identity from Russians. Resistance to Russia is called fascism. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
While Memorial was ordered to close by Russia's supreme court last year, it was co-awarded this year's peace prize, along with Ukraine's Center for Civil Liberties and the jailed Belarusian activist, Ales Bialiatski, whose wife accepted the award on his behalf.

HARRAK (voice-over):  Tens of thousands protested in the streets of Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, to demand the resignation of the prime minister. The rally was organized by the Bangladesh nationalist party, the country's main opposition. 
 
The demonstrators blame prime minister Sheikh Hasina for rising fuel prices and the soaring cost of living. They want her to step down for new elections under a caretaker government. 
 
The prime minister has called opposition leaders "arson terrorists" and Western officials have expressed concerns about her government's response to the protests.

HARRAK:  Despite global condemnation of the execution and the crackdown on demonstrators, Iran vowed Saturday that the punishment of protesters would continue. 
 
According to state affiliated media, Iran's deputy interior minister said punitive measures, quote, "will definitely go on." 
 
On Friday, another Iranian figure signaled additional executions will take place in the coming days. The U.N. says 11 more Iranian protesters have been sentenced to death. 
 
At least 20 people were injured during clashes in southern Peru, four of them police officers. The motive for Saturday's protest is not clear. But it took place in one of several towns where people have taken to the streets, demanding the release of ousted and now jailed former president, Pedro Castillo. 
 
Meanwhile, Peru's new president, Dina Boluarte, named her new cabinet just days after Castillo was sacked by congress and later arrested for rebellion and conspiracy. Castillo has been accused of attempting to dissolve the legislature to prevent an impeachment vote. 
 
A man who held hostages Saturday in Dresden, Germany, shutting down the famous Christmas market there has died. Two people were held at a store near the market. Police say, while they were rescuing them, the suspect was mortally wounded. 
 <br>[04:40:00] HARRAK:  They say the 40-year-old man is also suspected of killing his mother before the hostage taking. Police say the man appeared to have psychological problems. The two hostages were not injured. 
 
Well, the holidays will be bleak for many people across the U.K. They're struggling just to put food on the table. CNN's Nada Bashir looks at how the rising cost of living is impacting thousands of working families. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  For some children at this south London school, lunch might be their only meal for the day. It's a reality for many families across the U.K. The cost of living crisis making even the most basic necessities difficult to afford. For family support worker Majorie Damah, it's an issue at the forefront of her mind. 
 
MAJORIE DAMAH, FAMILY SUPPORT WORKER:  Even our dinner ladies are noticing that some children in particular are asking for more food. But I think it's really, really sad when people have to decide, am I going to heat my house or am I going to do a big shop? 
 
BASHIR (voice-over):  Single mom Tash Grant is one of the many parents now struggling to put food on the table. Despite working nights at a local supermarket, she says she has on occasion been forced to send her kids to school hungry and is now having to rely on a local food bank. 
 
TASH GRANT, SINGLE MOTHER:  Sometimes you choose in between food, heating, things for the children and basic things for the children -- clothes, shoes -- so, yes, we are feeling it. 
 
BASHIR (voice-over):  Tash is not alone. Thousands of working families across Britain are having to make difficult decisions every day to cut back on costs. 
 
According to a survey from The Food Foundation, nearly 4 million children were forced to eat less or skip meals in September alone. One official figure shows that the number of students depending on government support for free school meals has continued to rise since 2019, with nearly 2 million pupils eligible at the beginning of this year.
 
But with U.K. inflation now at an eye-watering 11 percent and food prices rising by more than 16 percent over the last year, the situation isn't improving. And the pressure is being felt by both parents and schools. 
 
NADINE BERNARD, HEAD TEACHER:  Government are definitely completely out of touch. I think they actually need to come and spend a day in a school and actually see what we are dealing with day in and day out. 
 
BASHIR (voice-over):  Schools have become a vital source of support for many struggling parents, stretched between paying skyrocketing household bills or paying for their weekly food shop. And with the holidays fast approaching, there are more difficult
 
 decisions to be made. Some parents now foregoing Christmas presents just to keep their children fed and warm. 
 
GRANT:  Definitely won't be no extras this year. The times when I struggle the most is when the children are off school, because breakfast, lunches is three meals a day. So that's when I will be struggling the most this year. 
 
BASHIR (voice-over):  Nada Bashir, CNN, London.

DR. ESPEN KNUTSEN, PALEONTOLOGIST:  There's still so much we don't know about these animals that were swimming in this ancient inland sea 100 million years ago, including how many species of these long-necked plesiosaurs, how many species there were there. We don't really know exactly. 
 
So this animal here, that has a head with a body attached to it, allows us to unravel some of that species diversity.

HARRAK:  NASA's historic Artemis I mission is set to splash down off the coast of Baja California later today. Let's take a look at the mission by the numbers. 
 
According to NASA, the uncrewed spacecraft took a 25-day trip around the moon. Total distance traveled, 1.3 million miles. And the re-entry speed will be more than 24,000 miles an hour. Michael Holmes looks at what lies ahead for this ambitious space program. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And here we go.
 
MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The leadup to the Artemis I launch might have been a bumpy ride after a series of delays due to technical glitches and bad weather. But NASA says, once its mega rocket got off the ground, it's been smooth sailing. 
 
MIKE SARAFIN, ARTEMIS MISSION MANAGER:  We got to witness the world's most powerful rocket take the Earth by its edges and shake the wicked out of it. And it was quite a sight. 
 <br>[04:50:00]
 
HOLMES (voice-over):  After 3.5 weeks in space, filled with engine burns, lunar fly-bys and stunning views of the Earth and the moon, NASA's Orion spacecraft is almost home. 
 
But before its splashdown, it needs to pass a critical test. 
 
In one of the most nail-biting times of the re-entry process, the Orion capsule will separate from its service module, then complete a skip maneuver off the edge of the Earth's atmosphere, which will bring it closer to its landing site and cut down on the G-forces that future astronauts will have to endure. 
 
After that, all eyes are on the heat shield as Orion blazes back to Earth at temperatures twice as hot as molten lava. NASA says the heat shield has been tested more than 1,000 times.
 
And making sure it can take the heat is one of the primary goals of this mission. From the outset, the uncrewed Artemis I mission has been a dry run to make sure the spacecraft is safe enough for astronauts to fly on board. 
 
BILL NELSON, NASA ADMINISTRATOR:  We are stressing it and testing it in ways that we will not do to a rocket that has a human crew on it. 
 
HOLMES (voice-over):  If Artemis I is success, it will be followed by Artemis II, which, like the first mission, will fly around the moon but this time with a crew. That will be followed by Artemis III, which intends to return astronauts to the moon's surface, including the first woman and person of color. 
 
Later missions will aim even further, with the goal of sending astronauts to Mars. But NASA says, before any of that happens, the Orion capsule must successfully complete its journey on Sunday. 
 
STEVE PLATTS, CHIEF SCIENTIST, NASA HUMAN RESEARCH PROGRAM:  As we progress, we will spend -- we'll land on the moon, we'll step foot on the moon and then we'll extend the time we're on the moon longer and longer. 
 
HOLMES (voice-over):  Michael Holmes, CNN.

HARRAK:  I want to bring in Dan Dumbacher, the executive director of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. He joins me now from Maryland. 
 
Sir, very good day. 
 
How did this test flight go?
 
DAN DUMBACHER, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF AERONAUTICS AND ASTRONAUTICS:  This test flight is going absolutely fantastic. Tomorrow, we have the re-entry and the return and the landing, a high risk event, but hopefully it will all go well. 
 
HARRAK:  What has NASA learned from this trip to the moon?
 
DUMBACHER:  NASA has learned a tremendous amount. We've learned, number one, that all of the launch systems and the spacecraft systems are working basically as we had planned. 
 
We've learned a few things along the way to make it better the next time around. And by all indications, short of what we will learn tomorrow, the systems are ready to put the astronauts and crew on it and return to the moon. 
 
HARRAK:  How close did the capsule get to the moon?
 
DUMBACHER:  The capsule a couple of times got within 70 or 60 miles as I recall. But it also went the furthest that a spacecraft has ever gone from Earth out beyond the moon. And that was intentional so that we could learn as much as possible. 
 
HARRAK:  And so how close would you say are we to a manned mission to the moon?
 
Because I understand this mission didn't have people on board.
 
But when will people ride this rocket?
 
DUMBACHER:  Artemis II is scheduled a couple years down the road. The hardware is all coming together. There's already spacecraft hardware in Florida. The launch vehicle is coming together at the assembly facility near New Orleans. So the hardware is coming. They need to put it together, get it all checked out and it will be ready to go. 
 
HARRAK:  And realistically when will we see humans return to the moon surface? DUMBACHER:  Well, we have to get the human landing system in place, probably no earlier than 2025, and the NASA team is working hard to make all into happen. 
 
HARRAK:  As you know, the rocket is huge, the price tag astronomical. A lot of questions are raised about if this is a sustainable project. It's very exciting.
 
But is it sustainable?
 
What would you tell people who question if NASA should really build this moon program around such an expensive rocket?
 
DUMBACHER:  Well, I would say, first of all, the first time -- first couple of times you build it and fly, it will be expensive. What we learn along the way will get the costs down. NASA already has plans, along with the industry team, to get those costs reduced significantly. 
 
And along with everything we learn, we have established -- reestablished the launch capability and being able to return people and payload to the moon for the first time since 1972. And this is an important set of capability as we work to extend the human neighborhood, build the space economy. 
 <br>[04:55:00]
 
DUMBACHER:  And get to sustainable operations on the moon. 
 
HARRAK:  Exactly, I wanted to ask you about that, in terms of what's the wider objective here?
 
Yes, it's exciting to send people to the moon but what's the goal?
 
DUMBACHER:  The goal here from an exploration perspective is to learn how humans live and work on the moon. Remember, when we went in Apollo, we basically went to the lunar equator. And now the Artemis system gives us the ability to explore all over the moon. 
 
And it then provides us the capability, as we learn, to go on to Mars and beyond. Along with this, this will be the beginning of opening up the space economy, all the way from lower Earth orbit out to the lunar surface and opening up new opportunity for generations to come. 
 
HARRAK:  Dan Dumbacher, Thank you so much for talking to us. 
 
DUMBACHER:  My pleasure. Have a great evening.

HARRAK:  And take a look at these pictures from the Hubble telescope. The first one is using blue filters to get a look at what's called a globular cluster. 
 
This next photo is the same cosmic neighborhood but looks very different because a red filter was used. It is thought that these stars are about 100 million years old. By the way, that's considered relatively young for a star. 
 
And that wraps up this hour of CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Laila Harrak. I will be back in just a moment with more news. See you then.
