(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANNA COREN, CNN CORRESPONDENT AND ANCHOR: Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us from all around the world. I'm Anna Coren, live from Hong Kong. Just ahead. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: You cannot divide us, and we'll be with Ukraine until they prevail in this war.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COREN: The U.S. President sends a firm message to Russia, signing a major security pact with Ukraine. But will it turn the tide of war? 
 
Making his first return to Capitol Hill since the attack on January 6, 2021, Donald Trump meets with Republican lawmakers as he seeks to retake the White House. 
 
And as India copes with record-breaking heat, we'll look at an innovative program helping women cope economically.
 
Day two of the G7 summit is just about to kick off in southern Italy, and US President Joe Biden has a busy day planned, including meetings with Pope Francis and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. Day one was dominated by Ukraine. Leaders agreed on a $50 billion loan for Kyiv to be paid back with interest from Russian assets frozen during the war.
 
Well President Biden also signed a 10-year security commitment with his Ukrainian counterpart. It includes training for Ukrainian forces, weapons and military equipment, and greater intelligence sharing. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BIDEN: Would we stand with Ukraine? Would we stand for sovereignty, freedom and against tyranny? The United States, the G7 and countries around the world have consistently answered the question by saying, yes, we will. We will say it again. Yes, again and again and again, we're going to stand with Ukraine. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COREN: President Zelenskyy is also calling on G7 leaders to come up with a plan to rebuild Ukraine after the war, similar to the Marshall Plan, which helped rebuild Europe after World War II. More now on the summit from CNN's international diplomatic editor, Nic Robertson. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NIC ROBETSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over): Brisk handshakes, hugs, even a kiss or two. Italy's PM Giorgia Meloni welcomes G7 leaders.
 
Then they all wait for the top guest, Meloni finding the time to take a selfie. Eventually Joe Biden arrives, more than half an hour behind the carefully choreographed schedule. 
 
Like Biden, many here, six total, facing electoral challenges. The U.K. P.M. almost certainly his last G7 as leader for a while. Meloni, on the other hand, buoyed by a bounce in recent European elections. 
 
I'm very proud to have the double honor of being Italy's prime minister and G7 president, she told the other leaders.
 
Hosting not just the G7 leaders, Ukraine's Zelenskyy joining them at the symbolic olive wood table. 
 
A $50 billion loan, unprecedentedly structured from $300 billion of frozen Russian assets, getting political agreement at the highest levels. 
 
Later, bilaterally with Biden signing a 10-year security agreement with the United States.
 
BIDEN: By providing weapons and ammunition, expanding intelligence sharing, continuing to train brave Ukrainian troops at bases in Europe and the United States, enhancing interoperability between our militaries in line with NATO standards. 
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT: This is an agreement on steps to guarantee sustainable peace, and therefore it benefits everyone in the world because the Russian war against Ukraine is a real, real global threat. 
 
ROBERTSON (voice-over): Ukraine, not the only G7 focus Thursday, Africa, climate development and the Mideast also dominating leaders' conversations.
 
Biden taking the lead on infrastructure and development to help farming and agribusiness in Africa and beyond. 
 
BIDEN: Just look at the progress we've made over the past, over the last year, the Lobito corridor and sub-Saharan Africa.
 <br>[02:05:07] We've mobilized $3 billion for clean energy projects, which will bring electricity, clean electricity to 1.5 million families who had no access to it before. 
 
ROBERTSON (voice-over): More back-to-back meetings planned Friday and another G7 first. The Pope expected at the sumptuous Puglia resort to help lead conversations about A.I.
 
ROBERTSON: But after a long day and not for the first time in recent years, President Biden bailing early on the others, skipping the leaders dinner with Italy's president. 
 
Nic Robertson, CNN, Monopoli, Italy. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
COREN: Well meanwhile, NATO's defense ministers are kicking off the final day of their meeting in Brussels at this hour.
 
They're expected to finalize a deal that would give the alliance greater control over future aid for Ukraine and the training of its troops. Well some officials say that's motivated by concerns that Donald Trump, who's skeptical of military support for NATO and Europe, could win the next U.S. presidential election. But the alliance's secretary-general says it's a common-sense decision.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JENS STOLTENBERG, NATO SECRETARY-GENERAL: More than 99 percent of all military support to Ukraine is provided by NATO allies. So it makes sense that NATO takes on a greater role in these efforts. This will put our support on a firmer footing, provide predictability for Kyiv and address both immediate and long-term needs.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COREN: Joining me now is Tymofiy Mylovanov, President of the Kyiv School of Economics and the former Ukrainian Minister of Economic Development, Trade and Agriculture. Great to have you with us. 
 
Let's begin with this 10-year security pact that has been agreed to. What does it mean for Ukraine's future? 
 
TYMOFIY MYLOVANOV, PRESIDENT, KYIV SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS, AND FORMER UKRAINIAN MINISTER OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT: It means more stability. It means more training, more technology transfer, more support. It means strategic partnership.
 
And this is not the only agreement. There are multiple other agreements with different other countries. In some sense, it creates a network of agreements which are not quite like NATO, but that's a bridge towards that.
 
COREN: President Biden has delivered a very strong message to the Russian President Vladimir Putin saying he cannot wait us out. The concern, however, is whether this pact will survive the outcome of the U.S. election in November. In other words, is this Trump-proof? 
 
MYLOVANOV: Yes, it's a very important question which makes a lot of allies nervous. But the way the situation or relationship with Russia is going is that Russia is doing everything possible that this agreement and other agreements would be in the best interest of the United States. 
 
COREN: You say it makes allies nervous. How does it make Ukraine feel? 
 
MYLOVANOV: Ukraine is nervous about the elections. We understand that elections put in pressure domestically on the United States. We have seen a delay in the aid for Ukraine. We will work with whatever government and whatever administration, whatever president will be elected. We are actually confident that both Biden and Trump will continue to support Ukraine, but we understand that the internal politics of the United States create frictions and delays. 
 
COREN: We cannot deny that Donald Trump has made no secret of his disdain for Ukraine and the U.S.' financial commitment to this war. He has said he could end the war in 24 hours. Buried in the fine print of this signed security agreement, it says, quote, "either party may terminate this agreement by providing a written notification through diplomatic channels that would take effect six months after". Is that not a loophole that a future-President Trump could very well exploit? 
 
MYLOVANOV: Well, you know, this is Biden administration, and that means that the United States believe that's in their interest. So they have not created this loophole for President Trump.
 
And also if we think about, if we recall that President Trump was one of the first U.S. presidents who provided lethal weapons to Ukraine. 
 
COREN: Tymofiy, the $50 billion loan that has been offered, this will be repaid from interest generated from the $300 billion worth of frozen Russian assets left in Western financial institutions before Russia's full scale invasion. How soon will that money arrive and how do you expect Vladimir Putin to react? 
 <br>[02:10:08]
 
MYLOVANOV: Well, Vladimir Putin is already reacting and making all kinds of threats.
 
And even yesterday, he threatened retaliation. Now there is movement on the "Wall Street Journal" on the journalist arrested in Russia. 
 
And Vladimir Putin is actually furious because he has lost, at least diplomatically.
 
When the timing of the funding is important, there is a talk. There is an expectation that it might be dispersed even before the end of the year. However, the mechanics of this have to be still worked out. And sometimes it takes time. 
 
COREN: This loan is to rebuild devastated ports, power plants, but also to buy weapons, much-needed weapons that Ukraine needs. I mean, this is all good and well looking into the future, but surely the priority is Ukraine's short term needs and the country's mere survival.
 
MYLOVANOV: Absolutely. The energy infrastructure going into the winter is the priority. Air defense is a priority and sustaining the defense is a priority. So, yes, the immediate needs, the immediate existential needs are the key here in this package. 
 
COREN: How would you say that the war in Ukraine is going at the moment and how do you see things panning out over the summer, which we know will be a very tough fight? 
 
MYLOVANOV: The spring was the toughest time. We didn't have support or sufficient support. A lot of our units were completely out of artillery rounds and the air defense was depleted. And that's what allowed Vladimir Putin to wage a systematic campaign which has destroyed or deteriorated the Ukrainian energy generating capacity. 
 
We also have had difficulties with mobilization. Now, all of that has been improving since the U.S. aid has been approved. The situation on the front lines stabilized. The Kharkiv-Northern Offensive has been stabilized. Ukrainian forces have been able to push back. The air defense is improving and the energy generation is stabilized, although we are having temporarily blackouts and expecting them to continue. But we overall see the situation stabilizing and gradually improving.
 
COREN: Well it's good to hear that things are improving. Tymofiy Mylovanov, joining us from Kyiv, we thank you for your time. 
 
Well, now to the war in Gaza. While at the G7, the U.S. president said he was not at all confident that a ceasefire deal will be reached soon. But Joe Biden added, I haven't lost hope. And he called on Hamas to step up.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BIDEN: I've laid out an approach that has been endorsed by the U.N. Security Council, by the G7, by the Israelis. And the biggest hang up so far is Hamas refusing to sign on, even though they have submitted something similar. Whether or not it comes to fruition remains to be seen. We're going to continue to push. I don't have a final answer for you. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COREN: Yet neither the Israelis nor Hamas have publicly committed to the ceasefire and hostage deal. CNN's Paula Hancocks picks up the story. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: With talks on a potential hostage ceasefire deal seeming to be in limbo, the Biden administration at this point is blaming Hamas. We have heard from the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who was just in the region that he's questioning whether Hamas is negotiating in good faith. This after they came back with their official response on Tuesday, which U.S. officials say did have a number of amendments, including on issues that had previously been agreed by Hamas. 
 
Now, the U.S. President Joe Biden was asked about whether he was confident of a ceasefire. He was asked this in Italy for the G7 meeting, and he said no. But he also pointed out that he still has hope. But the Biden administration really putting pressure publicly on Hamas, saying it is now up to them to come back to the table and say yes, Secretary Blinken saying it's really up to one man. 
 
ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: You have one man who's probably somewhere deep underground in Gaza for Hamas, Mr. Sinwar, who's making all of these decisions. Well, he's relatively safe underground. The people that he purports to represent, they're suffering every day. So if he has their interests at heart, he will come to a conclusion to bring this to a conclusion. That needs to happen and it needs to happen now. 
 <br>[02:15:07]
 
HANCOCKS: Hamas, for its part, though, has rejected the criticism, saying that they believe they are showing the necessary positivity. We have also heard from Hamas saying that the amendments that they have suggested are in the interests of the Palestinian people.

COREN: The Israeli military and Hezbollah have exchanged more fire along the Israel-Lebanon border. Lebanese media say one person died from a strike in the southern part of the country and 10 others were wounded. And Israeli military says 40 rockets were fired from Lebanon toward northern Israel and the occupied Golan Heights, setting off at least 10 fires. This is the latest fallout from the assassination of a senior Hezbollah commander earlier this week. 
 
Well, the last time Donald Trump was near Congress, his followers stormed the capital. Now, three and a half years later, Trump returned to the Hill to meet the Republican leaders. Find out what he talked about in those meetings. 
 
And the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously rejects a challenge to the use of the abortion pill Mifepristone. The reasoning behind it and what it means going forward, straight ahead on CNN. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
COREN: For the first time since leaving office after the January 6, 2021 riots, former U.S. president Donald Trump returned to Capitol Hill on Thursday.
 
Well, Trump's meeting with House Republicans was supposed to be about policy, but sources say he spent much of the time ranting about various topics. CNN's Kristen Holmes has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: We have to take this this beautiful place and we have to make it really something very special again. Right now, it's not special. 
 
KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Former President Donald Trump returning to Capitol Hill as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee and a convicted felon. 
 
TRUMP: This is an outstanding group of people. I'm with them a thousand percent. There was me a thousand percent. 
 
HOLMES (voice-over): Hoping to rally congressional Republicans and streamline the messaging ahead of the presidential election. House Republican leadership, unsurprisingly, giving the meeting positive reviews. 
 
REP. ELISE STEFANIK (R-NY): We just concluded a very successful special political conference with our special guest, President Donald J. Trump. We are 100 percent unified behind his candidacy.
 
HOLMES (voice-over): The Trump team said his meetings were expected to focus on policy, but sources inside the House meeting told CNN Trump tore through a list of complaints lamenting about his legal woes, calling the Justice Department, quote, "dirty no good bastards". 
 
Wondering about Taylor Swift's endorsement of President Joe Biden, quote, "why would she endorse this dope?" Calling Milwaukee the site of the upcoming Republican convention, quote, "horrible". A comment allies said was in reference to crime in the city.
 <br>[02:20:02]
 
But Republicans said Trump did also talk about some policy, offering guidance on how Republicans should discuss abortion rights. 
 
REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA), SPEAKER OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: He said, make sure that you exercise your own conscience, talk about it, share your conviction and do that in a way that makes sense to people. And I think he had made a good point. He has said that after the Dobbs decision, that the states are handling the issue right now and that's where he's comfortable keeping it. 
 
HOLMES (voice-over): And Trump addressed inter party politics after a year of infighting over the speakership. 
 
REP. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE (R-GA): He saw me in there and he was like, hello, Marjorie. He's always so sweet and recognizes me. And he said, are you being nice? He was joking. Are you being nice to Speaker Johnson? And I said, yeah. And he said, OK, be nice to him. And I nodded my head. 
 
HOLMES (voice-over): After the meeting with House allies, Trump moved on to the National Republican Senatorial Committee for another closed- door meeting. TRUMP: Everybody here, you're all either elected or you're going to be elected again and reelected. And I'm with every one of you. And you know that. 
 
HOLMES (voice-over): Ahead of Trump's return to Capitol Hill, the Biden campaign releasing a new television ad seeking to remind voters about Trump's role leading up to the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol. 
 
UNKNOWN (voice-over): There is nothing more sacred than our democracy, but Donald Trump's ready to burn it all down. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
COREN: A few hours after the House meeting, Trump held a closed door meeting with Senate Republicans. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell had a distant and icy relationship with the former president. But during the meeting, McConnell shook hands with Trump and later said it was entirely positive. 
 
In its first abortion decision since Roe vs. Wade was overturned two years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously rejected a lawsuit challenging the Food and Drug Administration's approach to regulating the abortion medication Mifepristone. The court ruled the doctors and the anti-abortion groups that filed the legal challenge did not have standing to sue. Well, Paula Reid has more. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PAULA REID, CNN CHIEF LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: It is rare to get a unanimous decision on an issue like abortion from the high court, but here are the justices collectively decided to sidestep the question before that, which is whether the FDA had exceeded its regulatory authority when broadening access to this drug, Mifepristazone.
 
And there are a lot of stakeholders watching this very closely, including women who would need access to this drug. The FDA, as any possible decision restricting their regulatory authority, would have an enormous impact on many industries, including, of course, the pharmaceutical industry. 
 
And of course, depending on which way this went, it also could have had an impact on anyone seeking office this year. 
 
Right now, they have effectively preserved the status quo, but because the justices did not decide the issue and instead just sort of tossed it out based on standing, it is possible, even likely, that this issue could return to the high court in the coming years. 
 
Now, for anyone who has concerns about Mifepristone, but does not have standing to bring a lawsuit, here is Justice Kavanaugh's advice for them. Quote, "citizens and doctors who object to what the law allows others to do may always take their concerns to the executive and legislative branches and seek greater regulatory or legislative restrictions on certain activities". So now all eyes on another abortion case before the justices as they release most of their key opinions over the next few weeks. This next case is out of Idaho and deals with what you do when you have a state with more restrictive abortion laws and that comes up against the more permissive federal laws. All eyes on that case, certainly one of the top ones the justices will decide for the next few weeks.
 
Paula Reid, CNN, Washington. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
COREN: "Wall Street Journal" reporter Evan Gershkovich, who's been detained more than a year in Russia, will stand trial for espionage in Russia. 
 
Well, that's from Russian prosecutors who formally approved his indictment on Thursday. They claim they have evidence he was spying on a Russian tank factory for the CIA before his arrest. The Journal and its publisher called the accusations baseless and the upcoming trial a sham. One U.S. official says Gershkovich will likely be moved to a different prison and may be unreachable for a while. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ROGER CARSTENS, U.S. SPECIAL PRESIDENTIAL ENVOY FOR HOSTAGE AFFAIRS: If it's anything like what happened to Brittany Griner, Paul Whalen, Trevor Reid, there'll be a period when he leaves Lefortovo where we won't have any contact with them. It'll almost be like it's gone dark. But eventually an American or I would say detainees surfaces in Yekaterinburg and we'll have a chance to reestablish that connectivity from there. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COREN: Russian President Vladimir Putin has hinted that he's open to exchanging Gershkovich for a former Russian spy convicted of murder in Germany.
 
Argentina is seeking criminal charges against protesters following Wednesday's clashes with police. They happened during Senate debate on a sweeping reform package central to President Javier Melei's economic overhaul scheme. 
 <br>[02:25:06]
 
Well, dozens of people have been detained so far. The country's security ministry says it anticipates more arrests as more demonstrators are identified. Argentina's Senate narrowly approved Mr. Melei's key reform bill and fiscal package on Wednesday, but not without significant concessions. Now heads back to the lower chamber of deputies for another review.
 
Well, not everyone gets to meet Whoopi Goldberg in the morning and Joe Biden in the afternoon, but that's what Pope Francis has planned. Those details just ahead. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
COREN: Welcome back. Well, Pope Francis has a busy day ahead. He's expected to meet with more than 100 comedians at the Vatican this hour before heading to the G7 summit in southern Italy later in the day. 
 
Well CNN's Vatican Correspondent Christopher Lamb is following all of this from London. And Christopher, Pope Francis is, of course, the first pontiff to participate at a G7 where I believe artificial intelligence and migration are at the top of his agenda. 
 
CHRISTOPHER LAMB, CNN VATICAN CORRESPONDENT: Well, that's right, Anna. It's going to be a hectic day for Pope Francis. A mixture of comedy and geopolitics. As you can see, the meeting with the Pope and the comedians is underway in the Vatican. The Pope invited Whoopi Goldberg, Stephen Colbert, Chris Rock, Jimmy Fallon, a whole range of comedians for a kind of conclave of comedic talent in the Vatican. 
 
And it's part of the Pope and the Vatican's outreach to the world of culture and also the world of comedy. Pope Francis is a pope who likes to crack a joke. He's talked about the importance of a sense of humor, lamenting the lack of a sense of humor in the church at times. So this meeting is to emphasize the importance of humor, but also how comedy and comedians can uplift us at a time when there is often difficult and gloomy news to contend with. 
 
But after that meeting with the comedians, he's going to be heading down to the south of Italy to Puglia for the G7 summit, where, as you mentioned, artificial intelligence is going to be top of his agenda. 
 <br>[02:30:12]
 
He's participating in the session of world leaders on A.I. Of course, Francis is the first pope in history to participate and address in- person a G7 gathering. He will be talking about A.I., something he's concerned about. He's called for a treaty to regulate the growth of A.I., but he will also be at the summit meeting with world leaders, including this afternoon, President Biden. 
 
It will be a meeting that follows because on from there, what meeting in the Vatican in 2021, the president, of course, is a Catholic and he has a good relationship with Pope Francis. I expect there'll be discussing the war in Gaza, the war in Ukraine. 
 
Pope Francis will also be meeting with President Zelenskyy of Ukraine and other world leaders when he is there. So a busy day for the pope.
 
But in keeping with a pontiff who never likes to stay still and has been very active throughout his 11-year papacy -- Anna. 
 
ANNA COREN, CNN ANCHOR:  Yeah, Christopher. I don't think the pope is cracking any jokes just yet. I'm seeing a lot of serious faces there in the Vatican from those comedians. Maybe the humor will come a little bit later. 
 
Christopher Lamb in London, many thanks. 
 
One of the worlds biggest religious gatherings -- I beg your pardon. 
 
Scorching heat is taking a heavy toll in India where people are struggling to stay hydrated. Now, a unique insurance plan is looking to help ease some of the financial burden. Those details next on CNN.
 
And the number of female sea turtles is on the rise in Malaysia. Why? And what do conservationists say about the consequences? We'll find out next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
COREN:  India is embroiled in a scorching summer and officials say it's the country's longest heatwave since record keeping began. 
 
Temperatures across the 50 degrees Celsius mark in several cities recently, officials estimate dozens of people have died across the country due to heat related illnesses. And things are expected to get even worse. 
 
A U.N. report predicts India will lose nearly 6 percent of its daily working hours due to heat stress by 2030. 
 
Well, one of a kind insurance policy is starting to make payouts to tens of thousands of women across India to help them cope with the financial impact of extreme heat. 
 
Well, joining me from London is Kathy Baughman McLeod, CEO of Climate Resilience for All, a non-profit that helped design the insurance plan. 
 
Kathy, lovely to see you. 
 
India as we've just said, suffering brutal temperatures this summer and with climate change, this could very well become the norm. 
 <br>[02:35:04]
 
It has a huge impact on workers, in particular, the poor. 
 
How does this insurance scheme help these people?
 
KATHY BAUGHMAN MCLEOD, CEO, CLILMATE RESILIENCE FOR ALL:  Well, extreme heat doesn't hit people equally and women are disproportionately impacted. And so, women informal workers, poor workers exposed to extreme heat and to climate effects are suffering more than any other group. 
 
And this union of, of women workers, the self-employed women's association, is our partner. And together, we designed a package of financial solutions to help support their income lost from extreme heat.
 
And when you think about someone working outside or selling things out in the sun or in the heat, their bodies are affected, their health is affected, but also the things that they're selling are melting or shattering, or going rancid before they can sell them. They're missing hours. Men can work at night. But women need to take care of their kids. 
 
And so, for lots of factors, cultural, physiological, and financial, women are in need of some of these solutions. And so, we're excited to launch this first ever combination of cash plus a micro-insurance for 50,000 women.
 
COREN:  Yes. I was going to say, this financial package you're rolling out is for these 50,000 women. I mean, tell us about these women and how to assist them.
 
MCLEOD:  Well, their work is in -- the union is divided into trades. They're organized around the trades. We selected the eight most heat exposed trade. So think of construction workers, home-based workers, and in hot homes with oftentimes roofs that are making it hotter inside, like steel roofs over -- the metal roofs over the top. 
 
They are street vendors and farmers. And so they are in need of a way to take a break from work because it's hurting their bodies and that means hurting their income and that means hurting your families. 
 
And we know that women -- research shows us, women invest more in their communities and they are the pillar of communities in our families and so, it's a great investment and it just makes sense to support their income in the face of this threat that they have contributed nothing to. 
 
COREN:  Kathy, insurance companies -- I mean, they're not known for being overly generous. How did you get them agreed to this plan? 
 
MCLEOD:  Well, this is a combination of philanthropy and the women themselves pay a small participation fee. And so, this is a pilot. It's a test. Is this a product that provides value to this community and so, we'll be exploring what is the future sustainability of product and an approach like this. 
 
I think it's important to share that it's not just about money, there also factors that reduce their risks and exposures to heat, including physical equipment that can shade them or coolers to keep their things cool. There are also an early warning system that we're designing, enrolling out just for them. And so, we want to reduce those risks of extreme heat, but also then transfer them as they say with -- with an insurance.
 
COREN:  And, Kathy, the World Bank has reported that up to $130 million people could be pushed into extreme poverty by 2030 because of climate change. I mean, this situation is only going to get worse.
 
MCLEOD:  Yes, it is. And we're going to need all sorts of solutions. And so you'll see and India is the birthplace of extreme heat solutions. Some green roofs and cool roofs and designing buildings for airflow and lots of nature-based solutions, you know, urban forests and green spaces, they all keep communities and cities cool. 
 
There are all sorts of new materials close that we wear that will keep us cooler, changing the hours when workers work, you're paying really close attention to nighttime temperatures. That's one of the biggest indicators of waking up, feeling tired and making mistakes work, hurting yourself.
 
And so, our ambition is that all 3 million members of the self- employed women's association would have the opportunity to be a part of a package like this of financial supports and the insurance, but also well beyond South Asia, Southeast Asia, Africa, East and West (ph), it has promised four great scale, as they say across places where women and vulnerable communities are suffering from extreme heat, and will continue to, as the heat continues to grow.
 
COREN:  Of course. Well, we wish you the very best of luck with this pilot program. And hopefully as you saying, can roll it out in other countries. 
 
Kathy Baughman McLeod, thanks so much for your time. 
 
MCLEOD:  Thank you. 
 
COREN:  Well, the effects of climate change are many, and varied and causing troubling consequences throughout the world. 
 
CNN meteorologist Elisa Raffa reports on how sea turtles in Malaysia are at risk.
 
(BEGIN VDIEOTAPE)
 
ELISA RAFFA, CNN METEOROLOGIST (voice-over):  These sea turtle hatchlings are being moved to shadier patches. The rising surface temperatures in Malaysia are changing this sex ratio among sea turtles, which is dependent on its environment. 
 
According to scientists, incubation temperatures over 30 degrees Celsius can lead to all female baby turtles. 
 
NICHOLAS TOLEN, SEA TURTLE RESEARCHER, UNIVERSITY OF MALAYSIA TERENGGANU:  We hypothesize about 29.1 degrees Celsius is our pivotal temperature points. So what would produce 50, 50 male, female sex ratio? So understanding that, basically is such a very small span, a very small range of degrees.
 
RAFFA:  For decades, the population of marine turtles has been in serious decline across the country often due to the harvesting of their eggs, overfishing, and lack of policy enforcement. 
 
Observers at the Chagar Hutang turtle sanctuary in the Malaysian Island of Redang are already seeing fewer males being hatched in recent years. Now, volunteers are carefully moving the eggs to cooler parts closer to the islands rainforest, and away from the hot sands.
 
TOLEN:  Sea turtle conservationists were concerned that uncontrolled global warming in the future, in the next 15, 20, 30 years will be detrimental to sea turtle nesting populations worldwide because it will feminize central hatchling populations, which will then lead to less productivity, less -- less female turtles being able to mate and lay more eggs.
 
RAFFA:  Researchers say that artificial incubators are not a viable option as they might disrupt the hatchlings understanding of the Earth's magnetic field, and they will not be able to find their way back to the nest.
 
MOHD UZAIR RUSLI, SEA TURTLE RESEARCH UNIT TEAM LEADER, UNIVERSITY OF MALAYSIA, TERENGGANU (through translator):  We are concerned that if we produce these turtles and release them into the ocean, they will lose their sense of direction and won't know where to swim. And for sure, such turtle mothers won't nest back here in Terengganu when they've reached adulthood because they aren't familiarized with it.
 
RAFFA:  Climate change might have a detrimental effect on the sea turtle population, and it might only get worse from here. Due to the lasting effects of El Nino, increasing heat waves are being prolonged in the country.
 
In Redang, after hatching, the sea turtles are moved to a small nursery before being released at night. 
 
These little ones will wobble their way into a cooler future.
