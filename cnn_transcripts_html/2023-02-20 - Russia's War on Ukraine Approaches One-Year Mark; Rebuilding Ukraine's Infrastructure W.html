MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN ANCHOR: Hello, and welcome to our viewers joining us all around the world. I'm Michael Holmes, appreciate your company.
 
Coming up on CNN Newsroom, as Ukraine approaches a year of full-scale war with Russia pressure mounting on allies to provide key with the resources it needs to push the Russians back.
 
This as American officials warned that China could be on the brink of sending lethal aid to support Moscow's war.
 
And rescue efforts winding down in Turkey two weeks after the devastating earthquake that left tens of thousands dead. But for many survivors, recovery feels further away than ever.
 
ANNOUNCER: Live from CNN Center, this is CNN Newsroom with Michael Holmes.
 
HOLMES: And we begin this hour in Ukraine where President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says his country is inflicting significant losses on Russian troops in one key eastern town as the war nears that grim one year mark.
 
The progress is being reported Vuhledar in the Donetsk region, where the situation has been described as very difficult.
 
Still, Mr. Zelenskyy emphasize that the more losses Russia suffers across the front lines, the sooner the war can end with a Ukrainian victory. It's a hope shared by residents of Vuhledar, who lived through the heavy fighting and describe the terror they felt during recent shelling.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Scary is not the right word. It is really terrifying. When it all started. I couldn't get away from it at all. Can you imagine?
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) HOLMES: Further to the south in the Kherson region, authorities say three civilians were killed five wounded including three children during Russian shelling there on Sunday. A mother and father were among those killed.
 
Meantime, Ukraine's foreign ministry is accusing Russia of blocking the rotation of experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency to the Zaporizhzhian nuclear power plant, that plant currently occupied by Russian forces.
 
U.S. President Joe Biden meanwhile, preparing to visit Poland to mark the one year anniversary of the war in Ukraine. And ahead of that two top Republicans in the House are urging him to boost military support for Ukraine, saying lawmakers on both sides of the aisle want to continue to fund the war.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MIKE MCCAUL, U.S. HOUSE REPUBLICAN: For the past year, we've been very slow at getting these weapons in, in the name of it being too provocative, whether it be stingers, javelins, these short-range artillery now longer-range artillery attack them, they can take out the Iranian drones and Crimea, and also aviation like F-16. If we put this stuff in from the very beginning of this conflict, a year from now may have been very different as we look at the anniversary on February 24. The longer they drag this out, they play into Putin's hands. He wants us to be a long-protracted war, because he knows that potentially, he'll lose, we can lose the will of the American people. And therefore the Congress will we're seeing the same dynamic and the European Parliament's strong support now, but they're worried that if this doesn't end with a resolution, you know sooner rather than later, this will be an issue for us.
 
HOLMES: CNN Sam Kiley is following developments and has more now from Kharkiv in Eastern Ukraine.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Inevitably, with the visits of the US president to Poland here in neighboring Ukraine, there will be a hope among Ukrainian officials and indeed the population that perhaps the U.S. president would nip in as an expression of solidarity and visit perhaps even Kyiv as other heads of government and world leaders have done in the past. But of course that is fraught with very serious security concerns. And as John Kirby recently said, there were no plans to do that.
 
But nonetheless, this is all coming at a time when there is in the words of the U.S. their convening policy and their convening abilities to bring together other allies supporting Ukraine is beginning to solidify policy behind the notion that perhaps Russia needs to be defeated in Ukraine rather than merely contained.
 
Now that was would be if it does solidify that in that direction, a very significant step forward. That is certainly the signal coming from the top E.U. a diplomat, this is what he says. JOSEP BORRELL, EUROPEAN UNION FOREIGN POLICY CHIEF: Zelenskyy and Ukrainians have a lot of applause (ph) and not enough ammunition. That is a paradox. They need to be less applauded and better supply with armed. Ukraine is fighting, paying the highest price in lives, but this war happens on European soil, affects us and has a global impact around the world, which also affects our security.
 <br>[01:05:17]
 
KILEY: Now, if you combine that with Secretary Blinken saying that the world is also being affected by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, warning that if the Russians were able to prevail here, or continue to hold a significant chunk of territory illegally seized, that would encourage imperial aspirations and warlike notions in other countries around the world with disastrous consequences, we are seeing a greater solidification of policy behind the idea as I say that a Russian defeat here would be a victory.
 
Now what that means in terms of for Ukraine is how to deliver that victory from the Ukrainian perspective. They're saying they need weapons urgently. They not -- it's not just about tanks, which are a tactical weapon. They want strategic weapons, they want jets, long range artillery missiles, and the ability to interdict, the ability of the Russians to continue to supply their large numbers of troops and material that they're pouring into this war. Sam Kiley, CNN in Kharkiv.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HOLMES: Russia has regularly targeted civilian infrastructure in Ukraine since the beginning of the war deliberately so. And when reconstruction begins, it will not be cheap. A recent estimate by the Kyiv School of Economics estimates the total damage to Ukraine's infrastructure at almost $138 billion. And even before that begins, Kyiv is seeking aid to cover its budget deficit to right out this year.
 
All right, to talk more about this, I'm joined by Arup Banerji, who is the regional banks -- World Bank's Regional Country Director for Eastern Europe. He joins me from Vienna. Thanks so much for doing so. Do you think people can truly comprehend the scale of destruction in Ukraine just how enormous the task of rebuilding will be?
 
ARUP BANERJI, REGIONAL COUNTRY DIRECTOR FOR EASTERN EUROPE, THE WORLD BANK: Thank you for having me, Michael. Indeed, a year ago, no one could have imagined the scale of destruction that we see. And the costs that the Ukraine and the world will have to incur to rebuild it all. Three months after the war, we calculate the needs, which is more than the damages at around $350 billion. That number is much, much higher now. And so therefore, it is a testament to the resilience of Ukraine's government and the people of Ukraine. But they've been able to shoulder this destruction, but still carry on.
 
HOLMES: Is there a plan yet an outline, at least of what needs to happen when reconstruction is possible? BANERJI: Yes, there is the beginnings of thinking about it. But the destruction is still ongoing, right. And we don't know how long this war is going to last. The most important short-term need, though, as you pointed out, is going to be to support the Ukrainian people while the war is going on. And that's why thanks to partners of Ukraine, across the world, there have been billions of dollars that have been flowing into Ukraine to allow the payment of pensions, social support, to make sure that salaries are paid. And that is really, really critical in a war-torn country to make sure that the economy functions as well as it can. And that makes the eventual reconstruction much easier and cheaper.
 
HOLMES: Because it's important, isn't it that Ukraine rebuilds, not just houses, buildings, even infrastructure but rebuilds an economy and a functioning economy, and industry and farming and so on. Those are just as important, are they not?
 
BANERJI: Indeed, and that's exactly the reason to make sure that Ukraine's economic capacity is not destroyed totally. Even though of course, it is severely damaged, but also to build a better Ukraine for the future, a modern Ukraine, one that wants to look towards Europe, and have the creating relationships with Europe. So we will see the future of Ukraine not only transformed in terms of the reconstruction, as you say, of the buildings and the infrastructure, but also an economy that is distinctly different from the post-Soviet economy that entered the war with an economy that will actually be a trading partner with Europe and the world rather than just the former Soviet Union.
 
HOLMES: Yeah, ironically, there are opportunities when it comes to reconstruction in terms of reshaping things. And to that point, Mr. Zelenskyy has been cracking down on corruption lately, and a rebuilding program worth tens of hundreds of billions of dollars is obviously ripe for corruption. How will contracts the awarding of them the execution of them and so on be monitored for fraud, who controls the process and oversees its integrity?
 <br>[01:10:11]
 
BANERJI: So that is something that I think is where all the partners, including the World Bank are trying to help the government build a structure that can do that.
 
Now, there are good things to build on. So Ukraine has the ProZorro procurement system, a digital procurement system that's among the most transparent in the world, if that is used, the prospects for corruption are going to be much less. Ukraine also has actually compared to many other war-torn countries, really, really strong fiduciary systems, especially in the Ministry of Finance and the budget, which is why the World Bank actually has mobilized over $18 billion that we are sending through Ukraine's budget. It's because we are relatively comfortable that those systems work.
 
So there are these bases to build on. But then, obviously, when the huge reconstruction comes, these systems will not only have been strengthened, but also used systematically and without exception. And that's I think, what they're looking at.
 
HOLMES: As you pointed out, you know, it seems ironic to be talking about this while the bonds are still falling, but it does need a lot of preplanning. Some have suggested that sees Russian assets be used to pay or help to pay for reconstruction. Is that likely to happen? Should it happen?
 
BANERJI: We have seen that some governments have taken the initial steps towards that. And I think that is something that if it happens, and it can be made happen legally, would provide an important basis for these investments. But again, as you say, it's early to think about this. Right now, the important thing to do is to make sure that Ukraine survives this war not only militarily, but also economically.
 
HOLMES: A massive task. Arup Banerji, thank you so much, really appreciate your time.
 
BANERJI: Thank you for having me.
 
HOLMES: A pro-Russian party has organized a protest in Moldova against the country's leadership, several 1000 people turned out with many demanding the removal of the new Pro Western government. It's led by Prime Minister who has pledged to make Moldova a full member of the European Union. The former Soviet republic is trying to strengthen its ties with the West amid growing fears of Russian interference.
 
Last week, the Moldovan President echoed warnings from Western leaders that Moscow could in fact be plotting a coup. Russia denies those claims.
 
Right now the U.S. Secretary of State is in Turkey where he is meeting with top Turkish officials about the devastating earthquake that has shattered that country. The meeting comes a day after Antony Blinken announced an additional $100 million in disaster relief for both Turkey and neighboring Syria, which of course, was heavily damaged itself.
 
On Sunday, the top U.S. diplomat surveyed the earthquake damage in some of Turkey's worst hit areas. He said the rebuilding process would be difficult, but that America will be there to help.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: This is going to be a long- term effort. The Search and Rescue unfortunately is coming to an end, the recovery operation is on and then there'll be a massive rebuilding effort. When you see the extent of the damage, the number of buildings, the number of apartments, the number of homes that have been destroyed, it's going to take a massive effort to rebuild. But we're committed to supporting to continue that effort.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HOLMES: Blinken also met with serious White Helmets to discuss their rescue efforts in the rebel held northwest of Syria and thank them for their work. More than 46,000 people in Turkey and Syria have been confirmed dead two weeks after the earthquake struck. Turkey says rescue workers have stopped searching for survivors except in two of the worst hit regions. Among them the province of Hatay where more than 13,000 buildings have been either damaged or totally destroyed. Official say those who survived the disaster are in urgent need of shelter.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): I have been waiting for 15 days on this chair in the coal, 15 days. Where will I go? My daughter, her husband, her son and daughter, four people from the same family are here.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HOLMES: In Hatay, many of the collapse buildings are now covered. And you can see them there in red balloons placed there by volunteers to honor all of the children who died in the earthquake. So far, they've tried more than 1000 balloons and they plan to continue until they cover most of the city.
 
CNN's Nada Bashir joins me now from the southern city of Adana in Turkey. And Nada, this sad reality is sinking in that the rescue phase of the operation is coming to a close?
 <br>[01:15:14]
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN PRODUCER: Yeah, absolutely, Michael. It has been remarkable to have seen survivors being pulled from the rubble this far after the earthquake struck southeast in Turkey. But as you said there, the window for finding survivors appears to be closing their search and rescue effort now winding down any two provinces left with those operations are still ongoing, but there is still so much more work to be done to support those survivors 1000s and 1000s of people left homeless.
 
And what we're beginning to see now in Turkey is many families, many individuals from the southeast region who have been left homeless now being evacuated to other parts of the country where they can be housed temporarily, but this is going to be a long process, a significant challenge for the Turkish government.
 
And in fact, when we were back in Istanbul, we were able to see and meet with some of those families who have been impacted and among them, we've also met with some children who have lost their parents, lost their loved ones, some of them we don't even know their names, that the authorities here are still trying to figure out whether or not they have any relatives still alive. Take a look.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BASHIR: The laughter hides their loss, pulled from the rubble, their parents still missing. The identities of some, a mystery. This orphanage has become home to some of Turkey's youngest earthquake survivors. Authorities say the search for living relatives continues. But some of these children are believed to have lost everyone.
 
MERVE BAS, ISTANBUL PROVINCIAL SOCIAL SERVICES (through translator): When we first received these children, we observed signs of post- traumatic stress disorder, the children were very fragile. So as well as providing shelter and security to these kids, we also began providing psychosocial support.
 
BASHIR: The devastation wrought by the earthquake has left countless children orphaned or separated from their loved ones. And one authorities say they're so far managed to reunite more than 900 children with their families, many are still waiting to be processed. And NGOs fear that millions could be at risk of acute psychological distress.
 
OBEN COBAN, TURKEY SPOKESPERSON, SAVE THE CHILDREN: They already have their loved ones lost. They already have their homes lost. They already have their schools lost. All schools are gone. But if they also lose their hops, that means loss of generations.
 
BASHIR: That loss is all too familiar to this Syrian family. Three generations now temporarily hosted in a small one bed apartment in Istanbul, their home in Antakya now a mountain of rubble. 26-year-old Raghad says she was the first to wake when the earthquake struck, pulling her mother and four sisters to safety just moments before their home collapsed.
 
RAGHAD, EARTHQUAKE SURVIVOR: When the earthquake happened, I think it's European judgment day. Yes, there is a very, very big sound that it's not going out from my head every time, it's here.
 
BASHIR: You still hearing?
 
RAGHAD: Yes.
 
BASHIR: But this is not the first time Raghad and her family have faced a tragedy of this magnitude. Originally from the Syrian city of Homs, the constant barrage of airstrikes forced the family to flee their home in 2014. But having her life upended by catastrophe, time and time again, has taken its toll on Raghad mental health.
 
RAGHAD: That's not my first time I get a life from a war or something too bad. And every time I said why. And now I'm asking myself, why? Why I'm alive? Maybe it was easy if I'm not -- 
 
BASHIR: Easier than going through this.
 
RAGHAD: Yes, because it's not my first time that I'm start from zero.
 
BASHIR: Yeah.
 
(Voice-over): Starting from zero for these children may not be as challenging. It's a catastrophe. They are simply too young to understand. But just like Raghad and her family, their lives have been changed forever by the earthquake.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE) BASHIR: Look, Michael, these are just some of the families that have been evacuated. But of course here in southeast Turkey, here in Adana, there are still 1000s and 1000s people, 1000s of families who are being put up in temporary accommodation, others living in tents, cities and internally displaced homes. And that is the reality of course as the country begins to get to grips with the scale of the destruction that has brought by this earthquake across the southeast region, as you mentioned there as well in northwest Syria. There is a huge challenge ahead the destruction difficult to grasp and the message that we are hearing from aid groups from those working on the ground here is that they need more support, and they don't want to be forgotten by the international community. Michael.
 <br>[01:20:00]
 
HOLMES: Powerful reporting, Nada. Thank you. Nada Bashir there in Turkey for us.
 
All right, still to come here on the program. There's international condemnation as North Korea launches two more
 
 ballistic missiles, a live report from Beijing coming up.
 
Also a small town in Georgia coming to terms with the news that their beloved former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, is in hospice care. We'll take you there for details when we come back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HOLMES: Tensions are escalating in the Korean peninsula as North Korea launched two more ballistic missiles on Monday morning. Pyongyang says the tests are in response to the joint military drills held by the U.S. and South Korea. In a statement the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said they deemed the presence of U.S. forces in the region as a threat and would take corresponding measures. The United Nations has strongly condemned the launch.
 
For more, let's go to CNN Paula Hancocks, who joins me now live from Seoul in South Korea. And speaking of the U.N., the Japan is calling for a U.N. Security Council meeting over these incidents, just how worried is the region?
 
PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Michael, there's certainly concern here in South Korea and in Japan as well. Although the question is, what can the U.N. Security Council do at this point when you have Russia and China unlikely to sign on to any additional sanctions, for example.
 
Now South Korea today had its own unilateral sanctions, it independently sanctioned for North Korean individuals who are linked to the missile program. But what we've been seeing over recent days is really an uptick in the tit for tat, if you like. It started this particular cycle on Saturday, when there was what appeared to be a long-range missile launch by North Korea. They confirmed on Sunday that it was an intercontinental ballistic missile.
 
And Kim Yo-jong, Kim Jong-un's sister gave a statement saying that they have now mastered the reentry technique and technology for missiles. Of course, that is just what North Korea says it's impossible to verify that at this point, but what it did lead to is a show of force, if you like from the U.S. and South Korean Air Forces they -- there was a B-1B bomber that came over the Korean Peninsula or at least one escorted by South Korean fighter jets. And that is what North Korea says it was responding to Monday morning by firing what it said was a super large multiple rocket launcher exercise.
 
So what we're really seeing is this uptick in retaliation on both sides. But at the same time we are seeing North Korea carrying out its third ICBM test in less than a year. These are the missiles that do concern Washington the most of the missiles that North Korea claims can hit mainland United States.
 <br>[01:25:00]
 
Now, the issue at this point is the tension is unlikely to ease because there are more drills coming up which North Korea regularly react to. We know that this week at the Pentagon, there is expected to be a nuclear tabletop drill between the U.S. and South Korea. And then next month, there will be a larger joint drill between the U.S. and South Korea, it's expected to last 11 days. And it is the main spring exercises that in the past have always solicited some kind of response from North Korea. So this is really what we can expect over coming weeks. Michael?
 
HOLMES: Yeah. And to that point, I mean, North Korea's messaging is clear. And it's well stated. But, you know, we always talk about the unintended consequences. Where is this headed? What does North Korea want?
 
HANCOCKS: Well, it depends who you ask as to what exactly North Korea wants, whether it wants to be accepted as a nuclear state, whether it wants to go back to negotiations with the United States and South Korea, and negotiate to have a stronger negotiating hand.
 
Now, of course, at this point, it's showing no inclination whatsoever to have any kind of dialogue. North Korea has publicize that it wants a five-year military modernization plan that started just over two years ago. So there's still three years of that to go and they're ticking through that list, that wish list of what they want to be able to achieve.
 
Just in January the beginning of this year, we heard from the leader himself, saying that he wants an exponential increase in the country's nuclear arsenal, highlighting the necessity of mass producing tactical nuclear weapons. And then shortly afterwards, we saw that military parade where there were at least 11 ICBMs being paraded through the streets and through Kim Sol-song square in Pyongyang. So really what North Korea is saying it will do when it comes to military and nuclear weaponry capability at this point. It is carrying out. It says that it will increase mass producing. It is increasing mass producing. So of course at this point, it's very difficult to see what the U.S. South Korea and the U.N. can do to try and deter them otherwise.
 
HOLMES: All right, Paula Hancocks with the update there for us from Seoul, I appreciate it.
 
Now, in just a few hours, the government of Binyamin Netanyahu is expected to introduce a controversial bill in the Knesset that would overhaul Israel's judicial system. For weeks now, marches have filled Israeli streets protesting the plan. It would limit the Supreme Court's powers to rule against the legislature and the executive and give lawmakers much greater latitude in appointing judges.
 
The prime minister and his supporters say the High Court is overreaching into politics and must be stopped but critics say the plan will weaken the courts in dangers civil liberties, and ultimately damage the country's economy and its ties with Western allies.
 
The people of the small town of Plains Georgia and many others around the world are praying for the former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, as he receives hospice care at home. On Sunday, the church where Carter has taught Sunday school for decades, prayed for his family.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We come to pray, we come to intercede and Lord we'd be amiss this morning if we did not lift President Carter to You. Lord, we pray that you'd be with his family, Lord those around him and God we thank you for his service to this nation.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HOLMES: CNN's Isabel Rosales is in Plains, Georgia with more.
 
ISABEL ROSALES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: We know from an official that President Biden has been maintaining close contact with the Carter family, has been informed of Carter's declining health and his decision to undergo hospice care. But now we're hearing from President Biden directly via tweet, he put out this comment saying to our friends, Jimmy and Rosalynn and to their family, Jill and I are with you in prayer and send you our love. We admire you for the strength of humility that you have shown in difficult times. May you continue your journey with grace and dignity. And God grant you peace.
 
So I am standing right now, very close to Main Street here in Plains, Georgia, the hometown of Jimmy Carter, where everywhere you look, there was a piece of history, of Carter history here. To my left beyond what you can see through these trees behind me, his high school where he learned about American history and probably never thinking that one day he wouldn't become Mr. 3 -- 39 President of the United States.
 
And actually as we look down this way beyond the train tracks, less than a mile away, a couple of blocks is the home that he built in 1961. The home that he still lives in today with his wife. And over to your left right here, this building, that's now museum, that is a presidential campaign headquarters for his 1976 presidential bid. This is the spot where 1000s of people would drop by to get a sense of how a peanut farmer wanted to become President of the United States.
 <br>[01:29:47] I also want you to take a look at this video, this hospice news is
 
 really coming four and a half months after he celebrated his 98th birthday. This video you're looking at was the weekend before that where they are at the Plains Annual Peanut Festival waving at the crowds there. This may have been one of his last public appearances here in Plains. 
 
Now the news, this hospice news of Carter preparing for his end of life. His family preparing, is understandably rocking Plains. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
PHILIP KURLAND, OWNER, PLAINS TRADING POST: This is emotional. The fact that he won't be coming in the store anymore, he won't be here, he won't be at meetings. But you know, everything little thing I do here he will be with me. 
 
If I said something to his family, I would say, yes I know you are mourning and yes I know you are hurting, but I hope you celebrate his life too because what a life. What a well-done life. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ROSALES: And Carter has always been known as a man of deep, deep faith. In fact, he taught at Maranatha Baptist Church Sunday school every single week until his health issues really forced him to take a step back away from that. 
 
In Sunday services, his congregation, his fellow people of faith, were sending out prayers to him and wishing his family comfort.
 
Isabel Rosales, CNN -- Plains, Georgia. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN ANCHOR: Still to come here on the program, U.S. officials tell China there will be consequences if they give military support to Russia in its war on Ukraine. We'll will discuss after the break. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HOLMES: And welcome back to our viewers all over the world. I'm Michael Holmes. 
 
You're watching CNN NEWSROOM. 
 
The U.S. believes China might provide military support to Russia amid its continued invasion of Ukraine. During a meeting with China's top diplomat, the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken says that he warned Wang Yi of consequences if that should happen. 
 
The U.S. ambassador to the U.N. echoed those sentiments. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LINDA THOMAS GREENFIELD, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS: We welcome the Chinese announcement that they want peace, because that is what we always want to pursue in situations like this. 
 <br>[01:34:44]
 
THOMAS-GREENFIELD: But we also have to be clear that if there are any thoughts and efforts by the Chinese and others to provide lethal support to the Russians in the brutal attack against Ukraine, that that is unacceptable. Again, that would be a red line. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HOLMES: Blinken also said that Chinese companies have already been providing nonlethal support to Moscow. Wang Yi is expected to visit Moscow, the first visit from a Chinese official to Russia since the start of the war. 
 
And CNN's Beijing bureau chief, Steven Jiang, joins me now with more on this. So what clues do we have about how China might respond to the U.S. talking red lines. 
 
STEVEN JIANG, CNN BEIJING BUREAU CHIEF: Yes Michael. You know, in a readout about the meeting between Wang Yi and Blinken in Munich over the weekend, the Chinese made some veiled references and very strong pushback, saying how its relations with Russia are bilateral sovereign matters and basically accusing the U.S. of hyping this up and saying they do not accept the U.S. finger point inclusion (ph) on them on this issue. 
 
Now the timing of this revelation, of course, is very interesting, as you mentioned Wang Yi is going to the Moscow after Munich, on the eve of the anniversary of the war and meeting with senior Russian officials and likely Putin himself. And according to Russian media, paving the way for Xi Jinping visit to Russia later this year.
 
Now the revelation by the U.S. of course, really shows how increasingly frustrated American officials are with China on their role in this war despite Beijing's repeated pledge of, quote-unquote "neutrality". 
 
What has been happening in the past year, of course is the two sides, Russia and China have grown closer not only politically but especially economically with trade volumes soaring to a new high. 
 
And that, of course, is related to part of what Blinken was saying from day one. They were concerned about China helping Russia dodge severe western sanctions, even before the latest assessment came out. And this, of course, also comes on the heels of the whole spy balloon saga which means the fallout makes it even more challenging for China to be willing to work with the U.S. on this issue. 
 
Now interestingly, Wang Yi did meet with his Ukrainian counterpart in Munich, at least publicly saying how China still respects Ukraine sovereignty and territorial integrity. But the reality, of course, is that Chinese state media still refuses to call the Russian military campaign an invasion, not to mention Putin and Xi have talked in person and via phone multiple times in the past year but Xi has yet to pick up the phone to talk to Zelenskyy. 
 
So all of that is why analysts think despite the growing isolation of Russia on the global stage, Xi Jinping is very much sticking to Putin and the so-called no limits partnership. And that is why China's assertion is that it is the only peacemaker in this conflict just rings hollow to many people, Michael. 
 
HOLMES: Yes. Great wrap up of the situation, Steven. Thank you. Steven Jiang in Beijing there. 
 
Concerns are growing that Belarus, Russia's only major European ally and Ukraine's northern neighbor could join Russia's expected spring offensive. Belarus was used as one of the launching pads for the Russian invasion in the early days of the war and the two countries have been stepping up joint military drills in recent months. 
 
Fred Pleitgen has rare access to the Belarusian side of the border with Ukraine. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: As Russian forces ramp up their assault in eastern Ukraine, Kyiv believes the Kremlin's massive spring offensive may already be well underway and Russian President Vladimir Putin could again use Belarus as a launching pad for attacks. 
 
On a visit organized by the Belarusian government, we saw the Ukrainians are not taking any chances. 
 
The Belarusians say from their side, this border crossing is open, but you can see over there that is Ukrainian territory and over there that crossing is definitely shut. There are several layers of barbed wire and also earth mounds to make sure no one can get through. 
 
Russia launched its main thrust towards Kyiv through Belarus almost a year ago, penetrating all the way to the gates of Ukraine's capital before its forces were decimated and retreated. 
 
Today, the situation of the Belarusian-Ukrainian border remains tense. Although this crossing is usually calm, even here some trolling. The Ukrainians fly the white-red-white flag of the Belarusian opposition on their side of the border, one of the many provocations the Belarusians say and they have beefed up their own forces here. 
 
ANTON BYCHKOVSKY, SPOKESPERSON, BELARUS STATE BORDER COMMITTEE (through translator): Mainly border guard units have been expanded, if before it was two people, now it is three or five. The armaments and equipment were also updated. 
 
PLEITGEN: Belarus says all the measures they are taking here are purely defensive. But Minsk recently conducted large-scale air force drills with the Russian military and the U.S. believes Russia is amassing aircraft in Ukraine's border. [01:40:00]
 
PLEITGEN: Putin recently hinting he is even considering placing nukes into Belarus. 
 
VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): I consider it possible to continue the implementation of the president of Belarus's proposal on training the crews of combat aircraft of the army of Belarus, which has been converted for the possible use of air launched ammunition with a special warhead. 
 
PLEITGEN: Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko acknowledging he needs Putin. 
 
ALEXANDER LUKASHENKO, BELARUSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Let's be honest, are we capable alone without Russia to defend our sovereignty and independence? We are not. 
 
PLEITGEN: In the towns near the Belarusian, Ukrainian border, the war next door weighs heavily. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It makes me cry, of course. It is scary. You are afraid for the people there and of course, you want to influence the situation somehow. But I am an ordinary person. 
 
PLEITGEN: Others fully in Putin's corner. I asked this man if he thinks Belarus should support Russia? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are one nation with Russia. We absolutely should help them. 
 
PLEITGEN: For now, all is quiet at the Belarusian-Ukrainian border, a nervous calm folks here hope will hold somehow. 
 
Fred Pleitgen, CNN -- at the Belarus-Ukraine border.

HOLMES: British police looking for a missing mother of two announced Sunday that they have discovered a body. Police were searching the River Wyre in northern England where 45-year-old Nicole Bulley went missing more than three weeks ago. 
 
While the body hasn't been identified, Bulley's family was notified by officials. Police say they are working on a formal identification.
 
Bulley disappeared in late January after dropping her children off at school. Her dog was found wandering alone and her phone was left on a bench near the river. 
 
A dramatic escape took place at a New Jersey gas station earlier this month. That is where a New Mexico woman's terrifying year-long abduction ordeal came to a dramatic end with the help of the station's owner. 
 
CNN's Polo Sandoval with the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It was a dramatic end to what police describe as a nearly year long, cross-country kidnapping. The woman, seen running into this New Jersey service station in early February is escaping her suspected captor who was close behind. A man later identified as James Parrillo Jr.
 
The year long ordeal started in New Mexico where the couple first met last February. The woman says she agreed to give Parrillo a ride to Arizona. They eventually made their way to California where she says their relationship took a violent turn. 
 
That is where police say Parrillo physically assaulted the woman, taken away her phone and debit cards. Eventually the pair made their way cross-country in what New Jersey state police described as a year long nightmare. 
 
Cameras inside the store captured the moment the bare-footed woman dead bolts the store, preventing her alleged kidnapper from entering. 
 
BOBBY MADAAN, GAS STATION OWNER: All you could hear is screaming like I've been kidnapped. 
 
Bobby Madaan (ph) is the owner of the service station. He remembers the frantic look of the woman desperate to get away. 
 
MADAAN: The lady was really scared like she was really scared. She was looking at the back wall in the office, thinking that he is going to come through the back door, break into the wall to come in. 
 
So I told her -- I just reassured her that you're fine, you're safe, the door's locked, nobody's coming in. And the police is on their way. 
 
And she just kept repeating that, you know, he has kept me against my will. And eventually the state trooper did get there. 
 
SANDOVAL: New Jersey state police are looking into the possibility that Parrillo may have held other women against their will in the past. He's already been charged with kidnapping and aggravated assault in connection with what police say was a heroic escape. 
 
New Jersey state authorities actively reaching out to investigators in other jurisdictions as, well hoping to make contact with anybody who may have known Parrillo. 
 
Meanwhile, CNN did reach out to his attorney, and we have not immediately heard back.

HOLMES: Still to come, New Zealand struggling to recover from Cyclone Gabrielle. It will be a very long road. We will have an interview from Wellington about the impacts of climate change. [01:44:14]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HOLMES: Following Cyclone Gabrielle in New Zealand, officials are still trying to figure out the status of more than 3,000 people. 11 people have been confirmed dead. Cleanup efforts are underway, there is a long road ahead. Power and telecommunications still down for parts of the country. 
 
The cyclone hit the North Island eight days ago and raked its way down the East Coast, inflicting widespread destructions. Prime Minister Chris Hipkins is calling Gabrielle, New Zealand's biggest natural disaster of the century. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHRIS HIPKINS, NEW ZEALAND PRIME MINISTER: There is no doubt that as a country, we have a steep mountain ahead of us. And we will climb that together. 
 
Our teams (ph) over the past week has been focused on the initial emergency response. Rescuing those stranded, restoring lifelines, and removing hazards. 
 
In some areas, the storms remains very much the focus. In other areas though, recovery is starting to get underway. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HOLMES: And I'm joined by James Renwick of Victoria University of Wellington. He is a professor of physical geography. Professor, it is good to see you. 
 
So what had the floods, the cyclones and other events exposed in terms of vulnerabilities in New Zealand? 
 
JAMES RENWICK, VICTORIA UNIVERSITY OF WELLINGTON: That is a great question. I think it has exposed a lot of vulnerability and a lot of underprepared areas. We have had massive rainfall events, a lot of sediment flowing down rivers, trees -- you name it, a lot of damage in a number of places in the North Island. 
 
And really there is a lot of questions being asked now about how well prepared this country is for those kinds of events, because we know there were going to be more of them and they are going to be worse in the future. 
 
So how we build our roads and bridges, whereabouts the settlements, how well protected houses are -- these are all questions that are being asked at the moment and it's obvious there is a lot of work to do in probably all of our urban areas around the country. 
 
HOLMES: Yes. And you know, when it comes to climate change and how New Zealand's being dealt a blow really to some of these people who live near the coast and around the rivers as well, there is already an adaptation plan in New Zealand. What would adaptation look like for a country like New Zealand where people live so close to the sea and the rivers? 
 
RENWICK: Yes, so I think it is a good thing that there is a national adaptation plan on the table. It was put out by the government only last year, so it is quite new, and there hasn't really been a lot of action yet. 
 
But the kind of things that need to happen -- one thing that's being talked about a lot is managed retreat. That is if you live very close to the beach, or you live perhaps on a floodplain of a river, we really need to think about those (INAUDIBLE) moving away from the really hazardous regions. 
 
Not so much moving all the houses that are there now but making sure that new construction is not in such risky places. So over time, moving settlements, moving houses, moving communities away from the major hazards. 
 
Other things that could happen include building levees, building sea walls, even putting houses up on stilts, now this has been done in a number of other places around the world already. So when there is a flood, the water can flow underneath. So all of those things are possible. 
 <br>[01:49:54]
 
HOLMES: Yes. Yes, I remember covering Hurricane Sandy here in the U.S., entire houses have been picked up and dumped, you know, literally half a mile from the coast. And that speaks to the idea of managed retreat. 
 
Relocating communities, I mean you know, considering large towns, large numbers of people, it is daunting in magnitude but it is true that so too is the cost of rebuilding after the fact. 
 
Is planning now so-called future proofing being done with enough urgency? 
 
RENWICK: Well, to be honest, no. I do not think it has been done in the past with much urgency. But I am hopeful that the terrible events we've seen recently will spur more action and will spur a conversation in the communities around the country as to what are those we need to do. 
 
It is a hard conversation to have, but after Hurricane Katrina in the U.S., and, you know, over 1,000 people died in New Orleans. There was talk about shifting the whole city. 
 
Well that didn't happen because people do not want to move from where their families have lived for a long time. So it is a difficult -- it is quite an intractable difficult situation to deal with. 
 
Ultimately, if you are living in a risky place such as very close to the coast or like I said on a major flood plain, we do have to look at this. And I think it's something we need to start now and overtime, over the next few decades, achieve those moves. 
 
HOLMES: Yes. Exactly. It is daunting -- the cost to lives but so is the cost of rebuilding over and over again.
 
There are challenges and difficulties in things like adaptation or managed retreat. But I imagine there are opportunities as well in terms of things like equitable opportunity, more climate friendly design. There could be social and structural upsides. 
 
RENWICK: Absolutely. And that's a really good point and I think it is a feature of government's plan, government's legislation around response to climate change, to make it a just transition, to help to reduce the inequalities we have in the country at the moment and yes, to make life better for everybody. 
 
So building homes that are better insulated, and places that are safer, and making sure that cross sections of the community have access to those houses. And that would be a real burden for society at large in this country, as well as making the whole place a bit safer around climate change and extreme events. 
 
HOLMES: A fascinating discussion, important issues that need talking, not just for New Zealand but globally.
 
Professor James Renwick, thanks so much. Appreciate you making the time. 
 
RENWICK: Sure. My pleasure. 
 
HOLMES: And we will be right back.

HOLMES: The biggest night in British film and television was dominated by a war movie. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: "All Quiet on the Western Front".
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HOLMES: The big winner of the night was the latest interpretation of the classic book about World War I, "All Quiet on the Western Front". The film took home seven BAFTAs, the book is Germany's best known anti-war novel but this first film adaptation made in the German language. 
 
And the CNN Films and HBO co-production documentary on Alexei Navalny won the BAFTA for best documentary on Sunday night. But it is highly likely the Kremlin critic himself isn't even aware of the honor. 
 <br>[01:55:00]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Alexei Navalny has taken on the most dangerous job in the world -- challenging the leader of the Kremlin, Vladimir Putin. 
 
ALEXEI NAVALNY, RUSSIAN OPPOSITION LEADER: If I want to be a leader of this country, if I want to fight Putin, I have to organize people. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HOLMES: Navalny is serving nine years in a maximum security Russian prison on charges of fraud and contempt of court. Earlier this month he was transferred to solitary confinement for six months. But his daughter was at the BAFTA ceremony in London and spoke with CNN about the importance of the award.

DASHA NAVALNAYA, DAUGHTER OF ALEXEI NAVALNY: Thanks to our amazing, incredible, very passionate, very talented team who were here. I am very happy that the story about my father and about the work that he is doing is getting noticed. It is amazing. 
 
Not a lot of people remember that Russia is not a democratic country and we are really trying to fight for the freedom of the people there.

HOLMES: Now a piece of fine art is in pieces after an art fair attendee knocked over a fragile sculpture. The $42,000 balloon dog figure was on display in Miami when an art collector accidentally kicked the podium, sending the pricey pooch to the floor. 
 
The blue porcelain sculpture is one of nearly 800 additions and stood at 40 centimeters tall. Artist Jeff Coons created hundreds of balloon animal figures, some of which have sold for millions at auction. And they are amazing.
