ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN ANCHOR: You are in the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Alex Marquardt here in Washington. Jim Acosta has the day off. Thank you so much for joining us today. 
 
Indicted but unrestrained. Former president Donald Trump hitting the campaign trail after he becomes the first former president in U.S. history to face federal charges. His first stop Columbus, Georgia. 
 
CNN's Kristen Holmes is there while Daniel Dale joins me here on set to fact-check some of Trump's claims that he has just made. 
 
Kristen Holmes, I want to go to you first. Trump has now responded to these federal charges for the first time in public calling them, among other things, ridiculous. What else did he say? 
 
KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Alex, ridiculous, a joke, they're horrendous for the country. He said that people were crying at night because of this indictment. 
 
I do want to note one thing before we get into exactly what he said in detail, I'm going to play some sound for you. He has been warned or at least advised by legal advisers about what he says, to watch what he says, that it could be used against him if there is inevitable trial. However, it doesn't seem to be stopping him from almost saying anything. 
 
He spent the first 40 minutes of this speech talking about various legal battles, not just that federal indictment, and also talking about the 2020 rigged election. He said again that this is a joke of indictment. He said all that it's done is raise his polls, his fundraising is through the roof, which of course we won't know until see those filings. 
 
He said that in the end they're not coming after me, they're coming after you. and I am just standing in the way. And he went after Jack Smith, calling him deranged, saying he and his wife are Trump haters. 
 
And we actually also heard an argument that we've just started hearing from Trump. It's relatively new after that document was unsealed essentially him saying that he couldn't have done anything wrong because the boxes were in plain view when he left the White House. Take a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: When I left office and was moving to Florida, boxes were openly sitting on the White House sidewalk. Everybody was taking pictures of them. This isn't somebody smuggling boxes out. Pictures of them, you've all seen, sitting with people from GSA and other people waiting to put them on a truck. But they were literally sitting outside of the White House waiting for a truck to come. Then the truck come. It was after a long time. And they put it in and they brought it down to Florida. And they make it sound like it's a biggie. 
 
If that's a spy operation or if that's something bad, we did a very poor job I will tell you. First thing you learn is don't put them on the sidewalk in front of the White House. As the former president, we were negotiating with the National Archives and Records Administration just as every other president has done. And the next thing I knew Mar- a-Lago was raided by gun-toting FBI agents. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HOLMES: And Alex, I do just want to point out two things really fast. Obviously it's unclear what he means by that first argument with the boxes. Those are boxes that were sealed up, packed by his team, and ready to go. So there was no indication to anyone else what was inside of them. The other thing, through our extensive reporting we know that the negotiating period had been over with the National Archives by the time the FBI went to his Mar-a-Lago home. 
 
MARQUARDT: All right. Kristen Holmes, stay with us. Daniel Dale with us here in studio. 
 
From what you just heard there, what really stood out to you? 
 
DANIEL DALE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: There was a lot of dishonesty just in the last couple of sentences of that clip we played. So first of all, Trump is trying to suggest that his negotiation after his presidency with the National Archives was standard, that every other president does it. That is not at all true, Alex. The Presidential Records Act says that the moment a president leaves office NARA, the National Archives, gets custody and control of all presidential records. 
 
And that is usually how it goes, that you leave office, you walk out, your successor is inaugurated, and NARA has the documents. So what happened with Trump was extraordinary. And number two, this idea that oh, they were just negotiating, and then all of a sudden there was a raid. Remember the "Seinfeld" Yada Yada episode? I'm dating myself. You know, I went to work and Yada Yada, now I have to back off. 
 
MARQUARDT: Right. Right. 
 
DALE: So he's skipping like the entire middle of the story. It wasn't just negotiate and raid. NARA asked for the documents back. He didn't get them back. They asked again, didn't give them back. They got the Department of Justice involved. They sent a subpoena. Even then they didn't give all the documents back. And only after all of this, after a year and a half of trying, at that point the raid came. 
 
MARQUARDT: And those documents that are in the indictment are the ones that only came after that subpoena. 
 <br>[16:05:03]
 
I want to go back to Kristen Holmes at the Trump rally. 
 
Kristen, the former president also bringing up his predecessor Joe Biden quite a few times. What did he say? 
 
HOLMES: Yes, and much to the happiness of his audience. I do want to note, Alex, we were wondering how Republicans were going to respond. I've spoken to so many Republicans in Washington who were very concerned about the charges in that indictment and how it would play in the 2024 election. However, he is speaking currently to a packed house. And his arguments against Biden, blaming him essentially for this indictment, saying that it was his corrupt DOJ, and also saying that it was unfair for him to be prosecuted and not President Biden when President Biden also took boxes of documents. Take a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TRUMP: By the way, Biden has got 1850 boxes. He's got boxes in Chinatown, D.C. He's got boxes all over the place. He doesn't know what the hell to do with them. And he's fighting them on the boxes. He doesn't want to give the boxes. And then they say Trump is obstructioning. He's obstructing. No. It's a sad day for the country. Think of it. 1850 boxes he had. Mine is peanuts. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HOLMES: And again we have heard these arguments before. He also compared himself to former Vice President Mike Pence. But as we know, these are not the same situation. It was not simply just about taking the boxes. 
 
MARQUARDT: Yes. And Daniel, and I should say that President Biden of course is Trump's successor, not his predecessor. Explain why this comparison to the 1850 boxes of Biden's, why that's a false equivalence. 
 
DALE: Yes. So the 1850 boxes do exist. But they are papers from President Biden's 36-year career in the United States Senate. And that's a key distinction here because unlike presidents who again are governed by the Presidential Records Act that says the government owns all of their papers, senators can do what they want with the papers that their offices have created and maintained. They could give them to me, they could throw them in the trash, they could set them on fire. 
 
What Biden did instead was donate them to his alma mater, the University of Delaware. They're not a secret. They've been there since 2012. The university published an article at that point on its Web site. And another key thing here, Alex, is that President Trump -- he's suggesting there might be classified documents in here. There's no indication of that to date. In fact, President Biden and his legal team consented to two FBI searches at the University of Delaware, and in February a source told CNN's Paula Reid that there was no initial indication there was anything classified in there let alone all 1850 boxes has been classified as has been suggested repeatedly by Trump and his allies. 
 
MARQUARDT: Yes. Consenting to those FBI searches, no evidence of any kind of resistance, and the DOJ still looking into what Biden had. 
 
DALE: Correct. 
 
MARQUARDT: Daniel Dale, Kristen Holmes, thank you both very much. We will get back to you in the coming hours as President Trump does continue to speak there in Columbus, Georgia. Thank you both. 
 
And joining us with some legal analysis, a former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti and Julian Zelizer, a historian and professor at Princeton University. 
 
Thank you both for joining me. 
 
Renato, to you first. You just heard Kristen there mentioned Trump's legal team warning him not to say things. We have heard in the wake of this indictment the former president attacking Jack Smith, the special counsel. Let's take a listen to that. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TRUMP: Jack Smith. What do you think his name used to be? I don't know. Jack Smith. Sounds so innocent. He's deranged. Deranged Jack Smith. And I watched him yesterday go up and talk. He talked for about two and a half minutes. He was shaking. He was so scared. He didn't want to be there because ultimately these are cowards. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MARQUARDT: Renato, he called him deranged. He has called him a thug, Trump hater. How big an issue could it be for the former president to go after the very person who is bringing charges against him? 
 
RENATO MARIOTTI, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: Well, it's something I don't advise my clients to do. Ultimately throughout the course of a prosecution you often are trying to negotiate with the prosecutors. There are times where you need accommodations from the prosecutors. You're trying to work out details with them. Throwing tomatoes at them or bricks or whatever you want -- however you want to characterize this is generally not productive in any way. 
 
And I have to say one thing that the former president should keep in mind, if you read that indictment, Alex, there's some paragraphs in that indictment that contain quotes that Trump said publicly throughout his campaign, throughout his presidency. Mr. Smith and his team are not afraid to take Trump's words and use them against him. And I know when I was a prosecutor, for example, when my office prosecuted Rod Blagojevich, they were recording all of his appearances on the "Celebrity Apprentice" and on talk shows and they would send those to Blagojevich's attorneys as potential exhibits. I wouldn't be surprised if Mr. Smith does the same thing here. 
 <br>[16:10:15]
 
MARQUARDT: And it has been very interesting to see the Republican reaction since this indictment came down. 
 
Julian, you wrote an op-ed on Thursday about the Republican Party, the so-called party of law and order, that has continued in a large way to back Donald Trump. You have Republican presidential candidates trying to walk a line. You have lawmakers coming to his defense, many of them arguing some that there is a two-tiered justice system. 
 
So, Julian, what do you think that says about today's Republican Party? 
 
JULIAN ZELIZER, HISTORIAN AND PROFESSOR, PRINCETON UNIVERSITY: Well, I think they have a lot of tolerance for whoever's at the top of the ticket. They're willing to see power stretched or abused. And in the case of someone who's now under two indictments, I still think there's a lot of Republicans who won't respond the way some expect them to probably respond. 
 
They will stand by their candidate if Trump is seen as the most valuable official in the pack. I still believe that they'll be either silent or support for him and they will take on his narrative that he is fighting against the system, rather than someone being investigated for serious, serious accusations. 
 
MARQUARDT: One surprise over the past week, Renato, was that all of the actions, so to speak, has been happening in Florida, in Miami, which is of course near Palm Beach where the president has his residence Mar-a-Lago. And the judge who has now been assigned to hear this case is Aileen Cannon. She is a Trump-appointed judge. She's the same one who oversaw proceedings relating to that search at Mar-a-Lago last summer. 
 
So what do you make of her being put in charge of this case? 
 
MARIOTTI: Well, it's a great draw for Trump. I think, you know, there's not a lot of good news that has come out in the last few days for former President Trump. I mean, that indictment was devastating. But the selection of Aileen Cannon, I think which is generally done randomly, was a very good thing for him because she went out of her way to issue rulings that helped him. She was very harshly criticized by the court of appeals for her rulings which were outside the bounds of what we would expect from a judge. 
 
So I think that's a positive development for him. I do think it's even more of an indication that if he wants to, that he's going to be able to delay this case until after the election. But at the same time, you know, it's going to be very challenging and I think the court of appeals ruling is an indication of the fact that that judge is not going to be able to save him necessarily from an indictment. And at the end of the day, you know, there's also the potential she could be replaced on the case. 
 
So I think, you know, he should have some confidence from that or take some solace in that, but it's not going to necessarily outweigh the evidence and the charges here. 
 
MARQUARDT: Renato, do you think she could perhaps be defensive because she is seen as this Trump-appointed judge, someone who may be perhaps allied with the former president, that she may be eager to prove her independence? 
 
MARIOTTI: Well, that would be the rational thing for her to do. And frankly that would have been the smart thing for her to do in any event when she was, you know, handling this case for the former president. I mean, she could have, you know, certainly given him a very fair shake, but nonetheless been very careful and thoughtful and tried to stay within the lines. She, you know, I think exercised poor judgment and obviously the court of appeals agreed including multiple Trump appointees agreed with that assessment. 
 
And so I don't want to predict that she's going to suddenly exercise good judgment, although I think that would make a lot of sense here for her to, you know, go out of her way to show that she is in fact fair and that she's going to give him a fair hearing, but nothing more than that. 
 
MARQUARDT: Right. Julian, you're the historian. We come to you for the big picture. Looking back at recent modern history, the closest that we've come to something like this was probably Richard Nixon. But of course he resigned before he could be impeached. He was tried in Congress. The former President Trump obviously cannot make these federal charges go away. Very serious. Very lengthy indictment. 
 
What kind of impact do you think that this process going forward is going to have on the country? 
 
ZELIZER: I think it will be incredibly disruptive and unsettling, just as January 6th and the effort to overturn the election was as well. And I think President Trump, former President Trump, candidate Trump, keeps shaking norms, violating and dismantling guardrails. 
 <br>[16:15:10]
 
And I think a lot of the country watches and they're either unsettled or they're numbed to it. And in both cases I think that's a dangerous direction for the country. And obviously in this case the Department of Justice is trying to say accountability will matter and we will see how that unfolds in coming weeks and months. 
 
MARQUARDT: Julian, have you been surprised at how the White House has responded in that they really haven't? 
 
ZELIZER: I'm not surprised at all. I think President Biden is being incredibly cautious and does not want to fuel the accusations he knows Trump is going to make, that this is a political persecution and prosecution and that's what this is about. So he is staying out of it. He's trying to let the legal system be in the central arena where this happens. But it's going to be difficult because, as we just heard, the former president won't be quiet and he is going to throw accusations out there and put a lot of pressure on President Biden to say something. But Biden is going to try to resist. 
 
MARQUARDT: Renato, we only have a couple of moments left but I want to ask you about the kind of sentence that you think the former president could be facing. He could be looking at decades in prison. Knowing what we do now from the indictment, do you expect that he will be facing prison time? 
 
MARIOTTI: Certainly. Others who have similar cases without the obstruction have gotten a few years. I would expect with the obstruction we'd be looking at high single digits. But of course the judge who'll determine his sentence is Aileen Cannon. 
 
MARQUARDT: All right. Renato Mariotti, Julian Zelizer, thank you so much. 
 
And coming up, Ted Kaczynski better known as the Unabomber is dead. He sent a series of bombs that killed three and left many others injured. We have a look back at how the FBI was finally able to crack the case. 
 
Plus we'll take you live to Miami where security is ramping up ahead of the former president's court appearance on Tuesday. 
 
And later, the incredible survival story of four kids found alive after 40 days in the Amazon jungle. How they did it ahead, details, coming up live in the CNN NEWSROOM. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[16:21:31]
 
MARQUARDT: He killed three people and injured many others with sophisticated bombs that he mailed or hand-delivered. Now Ted Kaczynski better known as the Unabomber has dead. He was found dead in his cell in North Carolina at 81 years old. It was a case that alluded the FBI for nearly two decades. Ted Kaczynski's own brother helped crack the case. 
 
CNN's Polo Sandoval joins me now with more. 
 
Polo, this is a case that terrorized America for years. So what happened in the end here? 
 
POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: And we are still waiting for the Federal Bureau of Prisons to expand or at least to tell us more about the circumstances of the man's death here, known notoriously as the Unabomber. Ted Kaczynski, 81 years old, had been recently I should say in December of 2021, it's been some time here, had been transferred to a security federal medical center in eastern North Carolina which actually houses prisoners with medical conditions. He was transferred there from Colorado's supermax when he was about
 
 two decades into serving eight life sentences after his 1998 guilty plea, admitting to sending a series of mail bombs, some 16 devices which killed three people, wounded 23. This reign of terror spanning 17 years starting in 1978 until his 1996 arrest. He planted bombs on an airplane, university buildings, computer stores and mailing some to professors and executives. 
 
His own words that were at the time published in his manifesto were initially what led FBI agents in the mid-'90s to this very primitive cabin in the woods of Montana. I want you to hear directly from his brother in an interview back then and his sister-in-law who initially tipped federal authorities on Kaczynski's whereabouts. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DAVID KACZYNSKI, BROTHER OF TED KACZYNSKI: When she said, well, I think maybe your brother is the Unabomber, I thought, well, this is not anything to worry about. Ted's never been violent. I've never seen him violent. 
 
LINDA PATRIK, SISTER-IN-LAW OF TED KACZYNSKI: They had posted the first few pages of the manifesto on the screen computer in the lobby of the library. So Dave went with me and then as Dave read the first page, I was sitting there beside him, and his jaw dropped. 
 
KACZYNSKI: I thought I was going to read the first page of this, turn to Linda and say, see, I told you so. But on an emotional level it just sounded like my brother's voice. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SANDOVAL: Truly an incredible look back now just decades later that sort of the inside police work that was done there, working with federal authorities to track him down as he was terrorizing Americans across the country. 
 
As part of his deal with prosecutors to avoid the death penalty, Alex, he admitted to all of the 16 bombings. In fact during his 1998 sentencing, the widow of Jill Murray, one of the Unabomber's victim, said, quote, "He will never, ever kill again." Alex? 
 
MARQUARDT: All right. Polo Sandoval, thank you very much for that report. 
 
And still ahead, alive after 40 days in the Amazon jungle. How four kids beat the odds and survived. 
 
You're live in the CNN NEWSROOM. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[16:28:47]
 
MARQUARDT: We have an incredible story of survival from the depth of South America's Amazon rainforest. Four children including an 11- month-old are found alive after spending 40 days stranded in the wilderness. The president of Colombia announcing that the astounding rescue happened on Friday saying -- he announced this on Friday saying they were able to survive because they are, quote, "children of the jungle." 
 
CNN's Stefano Pozzebon is following this story closely and joins us now live from Colombia. 
 
So, Stefano, how are these children doing after this ordeal? 
 
STEFANO POZZEBON, CNN JOURNALIST: Yes, Alex, so we are standing and we're talking to you in front of the hospital where the four children have been taken during the hours of this Saturday. And they've spent the first hour since being rescued after 40 days in the jungle and are receiving medical treatment. 
 
We were able to speak with a relative of the children who said that they are, of course, very weak, they're very stressed and, you know, with some of the relics from this adventure, but at the same time that the entire family and then the entire nation is rejoicing for these outstanding achievements, finding them four children after more than five weeks in the thick of the jungle. And it's just interesting to know how -
 <br>[16:30:00]
 
But at the same time that the entire family and then the entire nation is rejoicing for these outstanding achievements, finding these four children after more than five weeks in the thick of the jungle. 
 
And it's interesting to know how both the Colombian military and indigenous scouts -- the indigenous community normally doesn't have a great relationship with the army. They worked together to find them and to achieve the same goal. 
 
I spoke about this with one of the armed force generals that are here at the hospital. Take a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
GEN. PEDRO SANCHEZ, COLOMBIAN SPECIAL FORCES: When the goal and the aim is the same, it doesn't matter the blood. We can work very fast, very coordinate each other with -- between soldier and indigenous. But the reason is the goal, bring those kids to their home. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
POZZEBON: He said bring them home was the sole objective. And the indigenous and the military joined forces, almost signifying how the nation came together in hope that they could be found alive. 
 
Talking here a couple of hours ago, the Colombian defense minister told the press the children will stay in observation in hospital for between two and three weeks. They're, of course, receiving physical, medical treatment.
 
But also psychological support. We can only imagine how affected they are from these experiences. 
 
But again, a nation coming together, Alex, here in Colombia in a rejoicing moment for these outstanding statements of survival -- Alex? 
 
MARQUARDT: Just a remarkable story. 
 
Stefano Pozzebon, thank you so much for that report. 
 
Now to the latest on the war in Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy giving his clearest indication yet that Ukraine's long-awaited push to recapture land from Russia is underway. 
 
Zelenskyy said, quote, "Relevant counteroffensive and offensive actions are taking place in Ukraine." 
 
Zelenskyy was responding to Russian claims that the counteroffensive was underway, but not finding success. 
 
This is happening while, in the south, five people are now dead and more than 2,600 others are evacuating following the collapse of a major dam in the Ukrainian-controlled area of Kherson in southern Ukraine. 
 
Military officials saying the water levels are receding. But the flooding continues to affect thousands who are left without water. 
 
Retired Air Force colonel and CNN military analyst, Cedric Leighton, is here with us. 
 
Colonel, we'll talk about the damn and the flooding in just a moment. 
 
But I want to get your thoughts on the counteroffensive. I've been speaking to numerous officials who say it appears it's underway. We're not seeing major movements. 
 
But what indications are you seeing that this long-awaited offensive is, in fact, now happening? 
 
COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, Alex, there's several indications and they're quite interesting. 
 
A lot of it has to do with military movements, particularly in the east. What you're looking at is what's happening around the town of Bakhmut. And then further down south but also in areas right around here. 
 
In essence, what you're looking at is a three-pronged effort by the Ukrainians to move toward the east, to the Russian controlled territories of their country. 
 
MARQUARDT: Take us further to the west, closer to the Dnipro River. What's happening around Kherson that plays into this counteroffensive? Kherson is where we've been talking about the flooding as well. 
 
LEIGHTON: Yes, absolutely. So, of course, this is Kherson right here. This is the dam that was breached and had that extensive flooding right in here.
 
So what you're seeing is, of course, the Ukrainians have concentrations on the other side of the Dnipro River. On this side, this is all Russian-occupied territory still. 
 
But we do have certain indications that the Ukrainians are doing things like moving into areas where they can potentially shell, like this resort right here. That area has been a target. 
 
The reason for this being targeted is unknown, but there's a possibility that it might have had a concentration of Russian troops being hidden in this area. 
 
That's sometimes what you do when you're targeting these kinds of things, you look for the concentration of troops and go after it in a way that makes it easier for your forces to come across these particular areas. 
 
They're not going to come across here on the Dnipro, but they're probably going to go this way, toward the Sea of Azov. 
 
MARQUARDT: We have seen that before on both sides where essentially Russian and Ukrainian forces using whatever structures, schools, hospitals, resorts, to use as barracks for troops. 
 
But, Colonel, we are now seeing this rescue effort, the humanitarian effort underway because of the flooding. 
 <br>[16:35:02]
 
How is that being impacted by the fighting which is very close by? 
 
LEIGHTON: It is really close by. The rescue efforts are basically happening in this area right in here, on the Ukrainian side. Those are the rescue efforts we can see. 
 
On the Russian side of the Dnipro River, we're not seeing those kinds of rescue efforts because they're not granting access to the press. 
 
They're also not granting access to international organizations, even though President Zelenskyy asked for international organizations be allowed into this area. 
 
So that's a major problem and it could significantly impact on the Ukrainians' ability to move into this direction and also to protect this area.
 
But there's a huge economic consequence to this. 
 
The flood stage was over 18 feet above normal in this area. You have over 200 square miles in this area right here that has been flooded by the dam breach. 
 
MARQUARDT: Just the last thing the residents of this area needed. 
 
It's not just the water doing damage, threatening lives and flooding homes. It's also what's in the water. 
 
What are you seeing in terms of debris and other dangers? 
 
LEIGHTON: This is the beach at Odessa. The worry is that not only normal debris, such as pieces of wood and construction, but also that mines end up in this particular area. 
 
That could significantly affect everything down stream on the Dnipro. There's a huge fishing industry or was a huge fishing industry before the war. 
 
This could affect the grain exports from Odessa and other ports that have been worked out between Russia, Turkey and Ukraine. 
 
Mines that are unknown could significantly impact the ability of Ukraine to export grain to the rest of the world. 
 
MARQUARDT: All right, Colonel Cedric Leighton, a very important moment in this fight, this counteroffensive. We understand they're prodding, they're trying to break holes in that front to widen that up. 
 
But it's a critical moment for the Ukrainian forces and their fight against the Russians. 
 
Colonel Cedric Leighton, thank you very much. 
 
LEIGHTON: You bet, Alex.
 
MARQUARDT: And coming up, a massive security operation now underway in Miami in preparation for former President Donald Trump's court appearance this week. We'll take you live to Miami and discuss those plans, next, live in the CNN NEWSROOM. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[16:41:28]
 
MARQUARDT: The federal courthouse in Miami, Florida, will be under heavy scrutiny Tuesday when the former president arrives. It's expected he'll be formally arrested, processed and have his initial appearance in that same building. 
 
CNN's Shimon Prokupecz joins us now.
 
Shimon, law enforcement, they have had to scramble to come up with a plan for Tuesday because they didn't get a heads up this was happening. 
 
SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME &amp; JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: No, they didn't get a heads up. In fact, on Friday, just yesterday, law enforcement officials were meeting to try and come up with this security plan. 
 
But you know, the Secret Service, it's not the first time they're doing this. They have already had experience with this in New York City in Manhattan's criminal court when the former president appeared there, was arrested and processed in much the same way that he's going to be processed here. 
 
The one thing here is that they're dealing with a much more secure area in Miami. It's a federal courthouse. There are many more restrictions. They have underground capabilities. 
 
They want to try and drive the former president underground and bring him up to a courtroom and a processing center all in the same building so that he'll never have be outside. 
 
The biggest concern is, what will happen outside? Will supporters gather? Certainly, will anyone try to start any kind of trouble? 
 
And a lot of that is because of January 6th. That is very much on the minds of many law enforcement officials as they prepare here for Tuesday. 
 
MARQUARDT: Yes, of course, that is a major concern. 
 
And, Shimon, when the former president was arrested in New York, you were there for days in the leadup to that. 
 
But hundreds of additional officers have been called in to help with security both inside and outside the courthouse. Do we know whether -- if law enforcement there is asking for additional help from law enforcement organizations, from police, from anybody else? 
 
PROKUPECZ: Yes, so you have the Miami police, their police department. You have the county, the Miami-Dade Police Department assisting. Then you have the state police assisting. So you have all of those resources. 
 
Many of the officers from the local police department won't have days off. They told them not to take off. They'll put officers in uniform, much like we saw in New York City. 
 
Officers are normally on desk duty or in plain clothes, dresswear. They'll be told to wear their uniforms on that day. 
 
Then they'll have extra resources just around, not just around the courthouse, but in the area in case they need to mobilize. 
 
You also, Alex, have the state police, Florida, here. They'll be assisting. Then federal resources. The FPS, the Federal Protective Services, which provides security for the courthouse, part of the Homeland Security. They are sending extra officials in as well. 
 
There's going to be a lot of extra officers just to make sure everything goes smoothly and everyone is safe. 
 
MARQUARDT: All-hands-on-deck for what promises to be just an extraordinary scene. 
 
Shimon Prokupecz, in Miami, thanks very much.
 
Now to a few other stories that we're following today. In New Mexico, they have reached a $500 million settlement with
 
 Walgreens over the pharmacy chain's role in distributing highly addictive prescription pain killers. 
 
The settlement is the latest in New Mexico's push to get retailer outlets to pay for supplying the drugs. To date, the state's opioid litigation has brought in at least $1 billion.

The Vatican Press Office didn't provide any specific details on the nature of what work the pope is doing. The pope's surgeon said the pontiff's respiratory system is stable and he is not experiencing any heart problems. 
 
Now, up next, how do Americans feel about Trump's federal indictment? We'll be running the numbers next, live in the CNN NEWSROOM. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[16:50:26]
 
MARQUARDT: The indictment is in, and it lays out just how former President Donald Trump handled classified information. This will now, of course, play out in a court of law. 
 
But let's check in on how it's playing out in the court of public opinion with CNN senior data reporter, Harry Enten, who is joining us now to run the numbers. 
 
Harry, what does the polling show us about whether Americans believe that Trump should have been indicted over his handling of these classified documents? 
 
HARRY ENTEN, CNN SENIOR DATA REPORTER: Yes. You know, this poll was conducted, of course, before the indictment came down. We'll see what the polling looks after.
 
Beforehand, most Americans believe that, in fact, Trump should face criminal charges over how he's handled the classified documents. What we saw in an ABC/"Washington Post" poll was that 54 percent of
 
 Americans overall agree that he should be charged, just 38 percent said no. 
 
Of course, we have one of these splits where Republicans disagree with the public overall. Just 17 percent of Republicans believe that Trump should be charged with a crime versus the large majority of Republicans, 75 percent, who believe he should not. 
 
Again, this split between how Republicans feel and how the public, overall, feel on this question -- Jim? Sorry -- Alex? 
 
MARQUARDT: Of course.
 
And on that split, Harry, when you look at Republicans specifically, did they differ on how they viewed Trump's indictment in New York, the last indictment? Those were local charges, of course, regarding those charges around potential campaign finance violations. 
 
ENTEN: Yes. So this has just been consistent numbers from Republicans and how they view these different indictments. 
 
What we saw back in New York was, again, the clear majority of Republicans did not believe Trump should be charged with a crime. 
 
Just 15 percent in New York believe he should have been charged with a crime for falsifying business records versus 17 percent federally who believe he should be charged with a crime of mishandling classified documents. 
 
So we're seeing this steady Republican base that very few think he should be charged with a crime. 
 
Of course, overall, again, there's that clear majority that believes he should be. There's that split I keep talking about over and over and over again where Republicans feel one way and the overall public feels a very different way. 
 
MARQUARDT: He is, of course, the first former president to be indicted on federal criminal charges. 
 
He faces that indictment in New York on local charges. Did that indictment in New York hurt him politically for the Republican nomination? 
 
ENTEN: No. It didn't, Alex. And I think this is the real question going into what happens after this indictment is whether it changes the polls. 
 
The fact is, at least among Republicans, we saw that Trump's numbers actually went up. They went up. He had 47 percent on average in the Republican primary polls. Today, he's at 53 percent. 
 
What we saw of Ron DeSantis was his numbers went down. Trump's lead went from 17 points to 31 points. If we see that type of bump again, I'm not quite sure if anyone can stay completive with Trump in the Republican primary race.
 
I think Republicans would be happy if Trump didn't see his poll numbers move at all. But the idea that they would move down, history does not suggest that that's likely to happen. Trump has a clear -- a large percentage of the Republican base behind him. 
 
MARQUARDT: It's counterintuitive but, of course, that's politics today. 
 
And lastly, Harry, looking ahead to a general election. Of course, the former president is the leading contender on the Republican side. President Joe Biden, of course, will be the Democratic nominee. 
 
What is a hypothetical general-election matchup look like? 
 
ENTEN: Yes. This to me is perhaps the most surprising of the slides, given that most of the public believe Trump should have been charged in New York and believe that he should be charged in the federal case as well. 
 
Look at the polling before Trump was charged in New York. Biden had a one-point lead. Basically, a dead heat. Look where we are today. Those numbers did not move. 
 
In fact, if anything, there was slight movement in Trump's direction. We stand at a tie today in the national polls, 46 percent to 46 percent. 
 
So just because you see the American public believing Trump should be charged down in Miami, do not necessarily expect that Biden will benefit in the polls. 
 
The fact is, at this particular point, we're looking at a very, very close race for 2024. 
 
MARQUARDT: Neck and neck. But there's a long way to go. Just over 18 months before the election in November of next year. 
 
And in that time, of course, Harry, we will be seeing a lot of you. 
 
Harry Enten, thank you very much.

This weekend, on an all-new episode of CNN original series "THE 2010S," we take a look back at major the social movements, from Occupy Wall Street to Black Lives Matter to "Me Too." People took to the streets and made their voices heard in the largest demonstrations and mass protests seen since the 1960s. 
 
Here's a quick look. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LESLIE CRUTCHFIELD, AUTHOR: It helped further the Occupy goal of putting economic and equity, the 99 percent versus the 1 percent into the public discourse. And that became mainstream. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It lives on in Democratic Party politics in a big way on the Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren wing of the party. 
 
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT) This campaign is sending a message to the billionaire class. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whereas the Tea Party lays the groundwork for Trumpism, the MAGA movement, Trump's election. 
 
FAREED ZAKARIA, CNN ANCHOR, "FAREED ZAKARIA, GPS": Occupy Wall Street and the Tea Party are, in some ways, two sides of the same coin. The coin is a kind of populist frustration with the way elites run America, and the idea that maybe there's a way to change all this. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have a job. 
 
CROWD: We have a job. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That job -- 
 
CROWD: That job -- 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: -- is to change the world. 
 
CROWD: -- is to change the world.
