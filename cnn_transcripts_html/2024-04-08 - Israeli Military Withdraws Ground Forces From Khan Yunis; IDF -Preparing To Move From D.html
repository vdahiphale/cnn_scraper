ANNOUNCER: Live from CNN Abu Dhabi. This is CONNECT THE WORLD with Becky Anderson.
 <br>[10:00:01]
 
BECKY ANDERSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST: Will a major battlefield shift underway by Israel as the war surpasses six brutal months? 
 
Welcome to our second hour of CONNECT THE WORLD. I'm Becky Anderson in Abu Dhabi, where the time is just before 6:00 in the evening.
 
As the IDF withdraws forces from Khan Yunis in Gaza, the military says it is preparing to move from defense to attack on the Lebanese border. 
 
Plus, CNN sits down with the Japanese Prime Minister, why his country is reinforcing its defense capabilities after decades of pacifist policies. 
 
In the United States, the Biden administration unveiling a new student loan forgiveness program, but will it go into effect in time for the November 
 
 election? 
 
And later in this show, we are live from a mass wedding, where star crossed lovers plan to tie the knot under the solar eclipse.
 
Well, some major battlefield shifts by Israel this hour as Israeli troops withdraw from Khan Yunis, people first started returning to that devastated 
 
 city in Gaza. This CNN footage shows utter ruin and destruction as far as the eye can see and the IDF says it is, "Far from stopping military 
 
 operations in Gaza."
 
Israel's defense minister says troops are leaving Khan Yunis in order to prepare for, and I quote here, "follow up missions," including the border 
 
 city of Rafah where more than a million Palestinian civilians are crammed in. 
 
CNN's Nic Robertson is live from Jerusalem. Nic, what can you tell us about what is going on on the ground and this military withdrawal from Khan 
 
 Yunis?
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: The 98th division, that was the one in Khan Yunis, was at times the biggest division ever in 
 
 Israel's history. It had the most brigades in it that have ever been used, which gives you an idea of the scope of the battle. The IDF there found 
 
 themselves facing multiple layers of Hamas tunnels as they tried to find the hostages there. 
 
The destruction on the city though after four months of their presence has been huge. And in the past 24 hours, people have been able to get a look 
 
 and see it for themselves. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ROBERTSON (voice over): Khan Yunis's highway of hell shattered witness to four deadly months of Israeli occupation. Nothing untouched. 
 
The Jaffa Mosque reduced to rubble. The AFA (ph) gas station destroyed, spreading out from the thoroughfare a city sized stamp of destruction. 
 
 Almost every building in the southern Gazan hub. Once home to 420,000 Palestinians wrecked by Israeli troops searching for Hamas. 
 
The scale testimony of the ferocity of the fight, the graffiti left behind. Venom Gaza for the Jews, it reads. The IDF's sudden departure over the 
 
 weekend, opening the way for residents to return to what's left of their homes. 
 
It is a shock, a shock what happened. It was not small while coming here in the car, I saw things, the destruction is unbearable. Mohammed Abou Diab 
 
 tells the cameraman, I'm going to my house and I know it's destroyed. I'm going to remove the rubble and get a shirt out. 
 
Return is not victory here. It's resilience. Salim going back to his destroyed home. I will put a tent on it. Even if they destroy all of Khan 
 
 Yunis, we will stay here and we are steadfast. 
 
At first, just a trickle of people coming back, many weary that withdrawal not what it seems and with good reason. 
 
A drive along the border fence where the troop pulled out showing just that. 
 
ROBERTSON: We've just seen two huge explosions over there coming from Khan Yunis area. Looking along the horizon, I can see other detonations in here. 
 
 The fighter jets pulling off into the distance. It's clear, this is still a very active battle front. 
 
ROBERTSON (voice over): A mile away, scores of recently withdrawn tanks and fighting vehicles parked up. The IDF saying the surprise move marks and end 
 
 of ground operations in Gaza in their current form. warning though, troops out to recuperate and prepare for future operations. 
 
HERZI HALEVI, IDF CHIEF OF STAFF (through translator): The war in Gaza continues, and we are far from stopping.
 <br>[10:05:03]
 
ROBERTSON (voice over): Whatever next for the people of Khan Yunis, these days are a respite. Impossible to say if the IDF withdraw an inflection 
 
 point towards a ceasefire and an end to the destruction and killing. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ROBERTSON (on camera): Well, there's still a large number of troops, IDF troops left in the north of Gaza along the corridor that separates the 
 
 South and the North as a brigade there, the 162nd division, still a presence in the north. 
 
And the question, of course, that hangs in the air on everyone's minds, not least the White House that has guided Israel against this would be the IDF 
 
 troops going into that town of Rafah on the border with Egypt where there's an estimated 1.4-1.5 million Palestinians living. We don't know which way 
 
 at the moment the outcome is going and the talks in Cairo, the same.
 
ANDERSON: I mean, the Egyptians have suggested significant progress, but at this point, and we've been there before, and so, we continue to monitor 
 
 what is going on those hostage ceasefire talks. 
 
As you can see from Nic's report, the destruction of the assault in Khan Yunis, very much evident. Thank you, Nic.
 
As Israel says its mission then in Gaza is anything but over more than 100 hostages still held captive as we surpass six months of war. It is also 
 
 moving its military into attack mode and its border with Lebanon. Israel says it has killed a Hezbollah commander in an overnight strike on southern 
 
 Lebanon. The IDF has been exchanging fire with Lebanese militant group Hezbollah since October but in a statement on Sunday, the IDF said it would 
 
 move from defense to offense. 
 
Meantime, Iran's foreign minister is in Damascus as both Israel and the U.S. are on high alert for an attack by Iran. Tehran blames Israel for a 
 
 strike on its embassy compound in Syria last week that killed seven officials.
 
CNN's Ben Wedeman is in Beirut. And Ben, what do you make of this threat from Iran? On the one hand, and secondly, what is the situation on the 
 
 Lebanese border at present? Two, different questions but of course, they have the -- they meet in the middle as it were.
 
BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, they meet with the fact that Hezbollah is closely related to Iran. But certainly, what 
 
 we've heard from multiple sources is that some form of Iranian retaliation for the Israeli strike last Monday on the Iranian consulate in Damascus is 
 
 inevitable. The form, the place, the time is not at all clear. 
 
But even last Friday, we were attending a rally where Hassan Nasrallah a speech was made by him, he wasn't actually physically present. He said that 
 
 there is no question an attack by Iran, an answer by Iran is inevitable. So, certainly, that has raised tensions quite a bit. 
 
But of course, on top of that, there's that statement from the Israelis yesterday. We're going from defense to offense or as it was translated in 
 
 Arabic by the Israeli military, from defense to attack. And that is certainly set off alarm bells here in Lebanon. I can't tell you how many 
 
 Lebanese friends I've heard from asking me is there going to be war. 
 
Now, we spoke with someone today who said that they've actually counted up the number of times the Israelis since the seventh of October, who said 
 
 they were going to attack Lebanon. They said it was more than 130. 
 
So, certainly, people are accustomed to a certain extent to bellicose language coming from the south, but there are other elements that are 
 
 leading people to worry. 
 
For instance, last week, at the end of last week, the Israelis came out and said that they were suspending all leaves for combat units, and that they 
 
 were also calling up reserves for air defense units as well. 
 
So, put it all together and it certainly is very concerning. 
 
Now, the question is, is this bellicose talk or an intention to actually do something, that is not altogether clear. You have daily Hezbollah strikes 
 
 on Israel and Israeli strikes on Hezbollah. Today has been relatively quiet. 
 
Now, Hezbollah has conceded that two of their fighters were killed, they announced that today, we don't know when they were actually killed. But by 
 
 our count, and also according to the Telegram channel run by Hezbollah, only one attack on Israeli positions so far.
 <br>[10:10:12]
 
Nonetheless, tensions high, concern is high that things could get worse, unless, of course, there is some sort of ceasefire in Gaza, because we saw 
 
 back in November, when there was a ceasefire, Hezbollah also respected that ceasefire, and the border area was quiet, Becky?
 
ANDERSON: Yes. No sign of that as of yet. Let's just be quite clear before I let you go. What is the extent of a potential threat from Hezbollah on 
 
 Israel, Ben, should this kickoff?
 
WEDEMAN: If there is a full-scale war between Israel and Hezbollah, as Hezbollah certainly has capabilities that Hamas does not have, it has much 
 
 better weaponry, long range precision missiles, it has battle hardened fighters who got experienced for instance in Syria. Hezbollah is a 
 
 sophisticated, probably the most sophisticated, well-trained, well-armed non state actor in the world, they have the ability to inflict pain on 
 
 Israel, and Israel is well aware of that. 
 
And as we've seen, they are preparing for the possibility of some sort of war. So, it would be a very destructive war on both sides. 
 
I was here, you were here in 2006 and we saw the amount of destruction that was happening on this side of the border, also within Israel, there was 
 
 huge disruption. Tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of Israelis had to leave the northern part of the country because of 
 
 Hezbollah's ability to fire missiles well inside Israel, so a war between the two sides would be very disruptive. 
 
And for instance, we've heard -- we saw a statement from the Prime Minister's spokesman in Jerusalem, saying that Hezbollah goes to war with 
 
 Israel. Israel will copy and paste Gaza on to Lebanon, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Well, we know through your very good reporting of the extent of displacement on the -- in the South of Lebanon, we also know some 70,000 
 
 people displaced in the north of Israel, you know, currently in temporary accommodation. That is something Israel says they are not willing to put up 
 
 with. And so, it goes on, Nic -- Ben, sorry. It's good to have you, sir. Thank you very much, indeed. Well, Ben there talking about a lack of a 
 
 ceasefire at present. 
 
An Israeli official says the reopening of the Erez crossing for humanitarian aid has been delayed. The checkpoint between Israel and 
 
 northern Gaza was set to open on Sunday. This had been an offer from the Israelis, but officials say they are still making logistical preparations 
 
 to ensure that that checkpoint can accommodate truckloads of aid.
 
Now, the timing of the reopening remains unclear. This much needed humanitarian aid comes as the war in Gaza has now ticked past the six-month 
 
 mark, that was on Sunday. 
 
CNN's Nada Bashir shows us the scale of destruction and the human tragedy since the war erupted and some of her images as you, I'm sure will 
 
 understand, some of the images in her report are disturbing.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER (voice over): Celebrating a graduation full of hope for the future. This was life in Gaza for On Ihap's (ph) family, 
 
 before the war. 
 
Now, On Ihap is one of almost two million Palestinians that have been displaced. We never needed anything from anyone before the war, On Ihap 
 
 says. But now we are in a situation where I'm forced to beg for a loaf of bread just to feed the children. 
 
In this makeshift shelter without access to adequate food supplies or medical care, On Ihap's husband became severely malnourished and later 
 
 died.
 
The hardest thing was losing my husband, the way in which he died, she says. We're all going to die one day, but every death has a reason, he died 
 
 from hunger, from oppression. He had no food and no water for 55 days. It's very difficult for me to accept this. 
 <br>[10:15:00]
 
Satellite images show the scale of the destruction in central Gaza buildings, roads completely destroyed by Israel's relentless bombing 
 
 campaign. Israel says it is targeting Hamas, but six months on and the death toll has now surpassed 33,000, the vast majority civilians. 
 
Each week has brought with it yet more horror. More bodies pulled from beneath the rubble of destroyed homes, more funerals. Survivors forced to 
 
 flee from one battleground to another. 
 
And now, more children left emaciated by a hunger crisis which is threatening to push Gaza deeper towards famine. U.N. experts have accused 
 
 Israel of intentionally starving the Palestinian people by restricting access to aid with dire shortages leading to deadly desperation. 
 
What few hospitals remain in Gaza are overrun and desperately lacking in essential supplies. Gaza's largest medical facility Al-Shifa now turned 
 
 into a graveyard by Israel's bloody 14-day seed on the complex. 
 
In just six months, this war has become the deadliest conflict for children, aid workers and journalists.
 
Fuad Elmani (ph) has worked through multiple wars in Gaza. But he says he has never seen anything like this before. His son, a fellow paramedic was 
 
 killed by an Israeli airstrike while responding to an emergency call. 
 
Others have lost tens of family members, Fuad says. But losing my son feels like I've lost the entire world. 
 
Desperate to escape Israel's near constant air assault in Gaza. More than a million people have sought refuge in the southern border city of Rafah 
 
 where Israel says it is preparing free ground incursion, a move the U.N. warns would lead to unimaginable disaster. 
 
Israel's actions in Gaza have triggered a genocide hearing to the International Court of Justice, allegations Israel denies and a U.N. 
 
 Security Council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire. But hopes for peace remain elusive. 
 
The beach makes me forget our pain, our sadness, our martyrs, On Ihap says. Every time I come, I complain to the sea, hoping that God will respond and 
 
 finally take us away from this pain. 
 
Nada Bashir, CNN, London.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE) 
 
ANDERSON: And more on the war, including an interview with a relative of the youngest hostage taken on October the seventh, that is coming up later 
 
 in this show. 
 
Well, now to the United States where President Joe Biden is racing to enact a new student loan forgiveness plan ahead of the November election. It is 
 
 the president's second attempt to broad student loan forgiveness after the Supreme Court struck down his first plan.
 
So far, four million people have had their federal student debt forgiven under Mr. Biden, totaling $146 billion. 
 
Well, joining me now is CNN White House Correspondent Priscilla Alvarez. Good morning. Who would be eligible under this new plan? 
 
PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, according to the White House, there would be millions of people that would be eligible for 
 
 this new plan. Let me read you some of those, that includes borrowers who already qualify for student loan forgiveness under existing programs, but 
 
 have not yet applied. Those who entered repayment at least 20 years ago, as well as those experiencing financial hardship. 
 
The White House says that in total, with all of the measures combined, more than 30 million people could see some level of student loan debt relief in 
 
 the coming months. Some of them perhaps in the fall, others though perhaps next year. This of course still needs to go through a public comment 
 
 period. And that process alone can take months. 
 
But of course, Becky, this comes at a critical time the head of the November elections where this is an issue that voters are thinking about, 
 
 particularly young voters and the president and his campaign is trying to reach those voters and trying to demonstrate how they are working to lower 
 
 costs for Americans. 
 
In fact, today, the president is going to be in battleground Wisconsin, a state that he only narrowly won against his Republican rival Donald Trump 
 
 in 2020, to talk about the various measures that his administration is taking to help the American pocketbook. 
 
And chief among them is these plans. Again, as you mentioned there at the top, his first attempt at trying to provide some student loan debt relief 
 
 was struck down by the Supreme Court last year, the administration has tried to take multiple measures since then to continue to provide relief in 
 
 the ways they can. 
 <br>[10:20:02]
 
This is another example of that this new -- this new plan, but just as his first plan, it very well could be challenged in the courts again. 
 
For now, though, the White House is saying that millions have the chance to potentially have that student loan debt relief in the months to come.
 
ANDERSON: Yes, just one of those points really struck me, those who ended repayment more than 20 years ago, that would effectively put the near 40-
 
 year-old plus in play for this. And it just shows the extent of the impact that this has over so many years for so many people. It's good to have you, 
 
 thank you very much indeed. 
 
Well, after weeks of waffling, Donald Trump has finally addressed one of the major issues of the presidential campaign. In a video posted to social 
 
 media, Trump says abortion should be left up to the states, dashing conservative hopes that he might back a national abortion ban of some type.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: My view is now that we have abortion where everybody wanted it from a legal standpoint, the states 
 
 will determine by vote or legislation or perhaps both, and whatever they decide must be the law of the land. In this case, the law of the state.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, meanwhile, his campaign says it raised more than $50 million on Saturday night from a glitzy event for super rich donors. It 
 
 costs a quarter of million just to get in. 
 
Well, coming up on CONNECT THE WORLD, Japan's Prime Minister speaks to CNN ahead of his summit with the U.S. president. Could Tokyo see a big upgrade 
 
 in defense ties? More on that is coming up.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: Well, Ukraine today is denying that it launched a drone attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Now, that plant in southern Ukraine 
 
 is controlled by Russia at present. The Kremlin blames Kyiv for the attack. 
 
The IAEA says that the plant was hit three times on Sunday resulting in one casualty. The group says nuclear safety was not compromised. 
 
The Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warns his country will lose the war if the U.S. does not approve military aid in Washington. The fight over 
 
 that aid could be coming to a head. 
 
Congress comes back this week from recess and some House Republicans have threatened to oust their speaker Mike Johnson, should he move forward with 
 
 a vote on a Ukraine aid package. 
 
CNN Congressional Correspondent Lauren Fox is following this looming showdown. Lauren for us from Capitol Hill. And walk us through if you will, 
 
 the infighting on this aid package as it stands today.
 <br>[10:25:05]
 
LAUREN FOX, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, this is nothing new in some ways, Becky, in the sense that House Republicans, conservatives have 
 
 been opposed to moving forward with this aide for a long time. 
 
What is different now though, is the fact that speaker Johnson has been signaling and having conversations privately that he is on the cusp of 
 
 wanting to do something when it comes to aiding Ukraine as they continue their war against Russia. 
 
Now, one thing that remains very clear is that Democrats, Republicans in the Senate, they believe now is the time for House Republicans to do 
 
 something. But Johnson has yet to unveil the specifics of a plan. 
 
He has been floating a series of ideas including repossessing some assets that are seized from Russia, transferring those assets to Ukraine, creating 
 
 some kind of loan program, so that the money that the U.S. sends to Ukraine would be repaid in some form. 
 
But that can be difficult when you're talking about the presidential drawdown fund, which essentially just replenishes U.S. weapons supplies 
 
 that the U.S. is sending to Ukraine. 
 
So, he has several ideas who has been floating behind the scenes, his office has been having conversations with the Biden administration. But the 
 
 issue for Johnson personally is if he moves forward with this aid against - - to help Ukraine, he could face a vote to oust him from Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has been threatening to bring this forward if 
 
 Johnson moves ahead with any additional funding for Ukraine, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: She's been threatening very briefly. How much is in that threat do you think?
 
FOX: Yes, I mean, I think that it's a looming question. She has not made clear specifically what would trigger her to try and oust the speaker, but 
 
 it is very clear, she's serious. And she's concerned about additional funds flowing to Ukraine. 
 
The problem for Johnson is he has been looking at all of these different ideas like that loan idea that I was talking about earlier. And it's clear 
 
 that anything he does on Ukraine, even if he structures that is alone, even if he gets creative in the way that it's financed that that is not enough 
 
 for some of the hardliners like Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene.
 
Now, she says she's not drawing any red lines. But she also says she's not drawing red lines. So, she's being very vague on purpose to try to keep the 
 
 speaker guessing on what her next move is.
 
ANDERSON: Stay on it for us. Thank you. 
 
Well, the war in Ukraine is one of the big concerns on the Japanese Prime Minister's agenda ahead of a trip to Washington this week. Fumio Kishida is 
 
 set to meet with the President Joe Biden, it is important to remember Japan is moving away from decades of pacifism as conflicts around the globe flare 
 
 ups. CNN's Hanako Montgomery reports for you now from Tokyo.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
HANAKO MONTGOMERY, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: (voice-over): The world at a historic turning point, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida tells me 
 
 ahead of a summit with U.S. President Joe Biden this week, the longtime partners will upgrade their defense relationship to the next level. In the 
 
 backdrop of mounting international security challenges.
 
FUMIO KISHIDA, JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER (through translator): In our neighborhood, there are countries that are developing ballistic missiles 
 
 and nuclear weapons and others that are building up the defense capabilities in an opaque way. Also, there is a unilateral attempt to 
 
 change the status quo by force in both the East China Sea and South China Sea.
 
MONTGOMERY (voice-over): Kishida says soaring geopolitical tensions forced Japan long a pacifist country to change its defense posture, moves not seen 
 
 since World War II. Under his leadership, Japan plans to boost its defense spending to two percent of its GDP by 2027. And purchase weapons including 
 
 U.S. made Tomahawk cruise missiles, acquiring counter strike capabilities for the first time in decades.
 
MONTGOMERY: So, if Japan has a security pact with the United States, why does it need counter strike capabilities?
 
KISHIDA (voice-over): Missile related technology is evolving year by year. As missiles become more sophisticated, Japan must constantly consider what 
 
 kind of technology is needed to protect the lives and livelihoods of citizens.
 
MONTGOMERY: And you've asked for a summit with Kim Jong-un. But there seems to be some mixed messages coming from North Korea about its engagement with 
 
 Japan. What is your current level of communication between your administration and North Korea?
 <br>[10:30:03]
 
KISHIDA (through translator): We believe that resolving various concerns between Japan and North Korea and stabilizing relations is important, not 
 
 only for the interests of our two countries, but also for peace and stability in the region.
 
For this reason, we believe that it is important to hold a summit meeting. And under my supervision, I've been conducting high-level outreach to the 
 
 DPRK.
 
MONTGOMERY (voice over): Following the U.S.-Japan summit, the two nations will convene with the Philippines, the first trilateral meeting of its kind 
 
 to address rising security threats from North Korea weapons testing and aggression in the South China Sea.
 
KISHIDA: We are not targeting China, specifically, or a specific country. As Japan, we've been working to strengthen the Philippine's maritime 
 
 enforcement capabilities. We're also providing them with defense related equipment.
 
MONTGOMERY: You mentioned that it's not directed towards any one country. But wouldn't you say that the Philippines is gravely concerned about 
 
 China's actions in the South China Sea.
 
KISHIDA: It's true that there are some developments, as you pointed out. I think it's important for the Philippines to defend its sovereignty to 
 
 protect its own territory, territorial waters, and airspace.
 
I believe that these things are very important in maintaining and strengthening a free and open Indo Pacific based on the rule of law.
 
MONTGOMERY (voice over): The U.S. and Japan, an enduring bond confronts its pivotal moment as a volatile world seeks to unravel their global sway.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
YIFAT ZAILER, FAMILY MEMBERS KIDNAPPED BY HAMAS: Then, thank you. Oh, the institutions of the world that helped kidnap civilians, please do something 
 
 to force Hamas to release them alive.
 
This is a precedent nothing like this happened before. We need everyone's help.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[10:35:03]
 
ANDERSON: Well, that was my interview six months ago with the Yifat Zailer, just after the Hamas terror attacks in Israel. It was October the 9th when 
 
 we spoke.
 
Hamas kidnapped her cousin, her cousin's husband, and their two children, the younger child, just 9 months-old. At the time. Well, their cousin's 
 
 parents were initially believed to be hostages, but later identified among the dead.
 
Six months on, the others are still being held hostage and there is still no clarity on their condition, or when they will be released.
 
And Yifat Zailer joins me now via Skype. from Tel Aviv. It's good to have you.
 
Just explain where you are emotionally.
 
ZAILER: There's no words that can explain what this six months has been like for me and for my family. It's a torture, it's a nightmare. Still, I 
 
 can't believe that we're speaking again after six months, and nothing has changed. We know nothing. We have no news, no sign of life, nothing.
 
I can't even explain how much I was terrified when I spoke to you. I hear that interview. I've heard it now. And I'm even more terrified now. I feel 
 
 very hopeless. And I hope this all will be over soon. Although, I can't express these words without having the concern that we might speak again, 
 
 in a few months from now with us, not knowing anything about those two beautiful boy, my cousin, and her husband.
 
ANDERSON: Just four years old, and as you say, nine months old. Those little kids at the time of the kidnapping. You posted an Instagram post 
 
 recently, or today, I think. There isn't a day or night that I don't cry with frustration.
 
I feel like they have forgotten you. I feel like I'm not being let -- allowed to be angry, that you've been abandoned. This is considered 
 
 treason, you say. This is a failure after six months.
 
Just explain what motivated you to write that post.
 
ZAILER: For six months, we've been traveling the world, meeting world leaders, meeting people who are interest in hearing our story and helping 
 
 us. I think after six months living in a democratic state, I have the right to criticize the way my government has been dealing with this horrible 
 
 tragedy.
 
It is complex, we are dealing with Qatar organization that basically took my family out of bed into captivity into hell without giving any, you know, 
 
 any sign of life, any proof, anything.
 
But here I have the right to come to my leaders and my prime minister and ask him, where is this all going? We are -- I cannot be the one crying for 
 
 help to release those hostages. I'm just a simple woman from Israel, a mother who doesn't want to see anyone being harmed in war, and I want my 
 
 family back.
 
This is what makes us different from terror. And we want innocent civilians back home and children, our children. This is how I was raised. This is how 
 
 my cousin was raised. And I feel that because of the situation and because of this horrible war, and because of this turmoil that we're in.
 
It's time to ask the hard questions. And I've been asking them since the beginning, and now, you know, I know that a lot of people hear what it says 
 
 on the press. I know a lot of people in the government, in the intelligence, in the IDF, they are doing their best to come to a deal and 
 
 ceasefire, and release the hostages -- and it's not easy.
 
But I feel like feeds are being dragged, you know? Something is being stalled. There's should be a solution. Those are -- those are innocent 
 
 people. They -- Hamas has a price, pay it
 
OK? There is no price for freedom. I know it's not the -- maybe the right thing to do to negotiate with terror, but it's the smart thing to do, 
 
 because life has value. And it's hard -- It's hard, and it's so complicated.
 <br>[10:40:01]
 
I don't want to cry again.
 
ANDERSON: Yifat, we can -- know, we can only imagine what you're going through.
 
You just said it was time to ask where this is all going. What is your hope? Where is this all going at this point? You've just talked about the 
 
 idea that something is stalling or somebody is stalling. What do you mean by that?
 
ZAILER: I read the news and I'm not a politician. I'm not a government -- I'm not government official, I'm not an army official. I read the news. 
 
 This is how we get informed, no one has given us, the family, if there is any, you know, internal information.
 
And I see the world pressure, I see what's happening in Gaza. I'm not blind to it. I see the humanitarian crisis. I see the amount of soldier we lose. 
 
 I see all the effects of the war in the economy, I see that has been six months and that hostages are being killed in captivity.
 
Just yesterday, we buried (INAUDIBLE) who was kidnapped alive and documented two times. He was killed in captivity. I feel like there is no 
 
 more time. And what I hope, I was really -- before October 7th, I -- you can consider me, you know, a left-wing person I believed in my family, 
 
 build bridges and live their downside of believing that they can live peacefully but something broke in me.
 
You know, I'm scared. I'm scared because I saw my cousin being kidnapped and no one checked whether who she voted for what her believes. And if she 
 
 wants peace or not. They took her and they murdered others. They murdered my aunt -- my aunt and uncle. They burned them alive. It took two weeks to 
 
 recognize them.
 
So, it's something broke. But I have to -- I have for my children and the future of my family believe that things here in the Middle East can be 
 
 different. But I'm tired of this. I feel like there's a different war, war of interest, war of gun industry, war of money, war of everything that 
 
 keeps the situation in Israel in the Middle East the way it is. And I don't -- I can't point exactly where is the problem, because I don't think there 
 
 is only one place that you can point at.
 
And someone needs to mediate this and someone needs to finished this, and Gaza should be freed from Hamas, it cannot be, you know, blinded this 
 
 question of, you know, how do you let terror organization control for 15 years? And the future of those children? If -- I don't -- I don't know -- I 
 
 don't want to raise my children into this hatred. I don't want to make them to believe that every Palestinian wants them dead or want to kidnap them. 
 
 That's not -- that's not good for the generational effect of what's going to be here in Israel.
 
But I miss my family, and I need them back?
 
ANDERSON: You're talking about Shiri, her husband Yarden. Ariel, and their little baby boy Kfir. We wish you the best.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
ZAILER: Who's celebrated (INAUDIBLE).
 
ANDERSON: And we hope for the best for them. Absolutely. Thank you for joining us again, and I'm so sorry that we are speaking six months on from 
 
 what was a devastating, devastating time for your family and for so many others.
 
Thank you for joining us.
 
ZAILER: I hope they are going (INAUDIBLE).
 
ANDERSON: You're watching CONNECT THE WORLD, there is more news ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:45:54]
 
ANDERSON: Take a look at this, yet, another scary moment onboard a Boeing plane. This time, on a Southwest Airlines flight. What you're seeing here 
 
 is the engine cover, hitting one of the plane's wing flaps, after it flew off.
 
The crew made an emergency landing in Denver, shortly after takeoff. No injuries thankfully were reported. The U.S. safety watchdog is 
 
 investigating the incident.
 
Well, Gabe Cohen, following this from Washington, D.C. What more do we know at this point, and what is Southwest actually saying about this?
 
GABE COHEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, the incident itself is under investigation. The airline telling us that maintenance crews are going to 
 
 be looking at that plane.
 
In a statement Southwest said about the passengers who experienced that emergency landing. "We apologize for the inconvenience of their delay but 
 
 place our highest priority on ultimate safety for our customers and employees."
 
And you can imagine what those customers and employees who are onboard that flight, were thinking as all of this was unfolding, this terrifying scene 
 
 Sunday morning as that plane took off from Denver airport.
 
Passengers who were on the plane could see that cowling. The engine cover actually ripping off the aircraft and strike the wing flap, and yet, that 
 
 plane still took off and was in the air for about 35 minutes before eventually making its return to Denver for that emergency landing. You can 
 
 see the video there of the cowling actually coming off the plane.
 
We've also obtained air traffic control audio of the conversation between the pilot on the plane and folks on the ground. Take a listen. This was 
 
 what was said.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: All right. Let's go ahead and declare an emergency for Southwest 3695. And we'd like an immediate return. We got a piece of the 
 
 engine cowling hanging off apparently.
 
It was the right side. I'm not 100 percent sure it was the engine.
 
I think the flaps on the inboard side of the engine, between the engine and the fuselage ripped off on takeoff. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Southwest 3695, copy that. Thank you.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Our engines seem to be fine, but we are structurally damaged.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COHEN: Now, the FAA has launched an investigation. But, look, to be clear, while this is a Boeing plane, this is not the MAX 9, which is the aircraft 
 
 that has had a lot of issues and has been under the microscope and under scrutiny for months now you'll recall that incident back in January, when a 
 
 door plug blew off an American -- an Alaska Airlines flight, and led the FAA to temporarily ground the MAX 9, and ordered Boeing to address what 
 
 they called systemic quality control issues.
 
This is not the MAX 9, this is a 737-800, which has been in use a lot longer than the MAX 9, in this case, about nine years.
 
We had still don't know if this was a Boeing problem, perhaps, a Southwest maintenance issue. That is what's under investigation.
 
ANDERSON: Good to have you, sir. Thank you.
 
COHEN: Thank you.
 
ANDERSON: Well, it sounds almost like a country song. U.S. country star Morgan Wallen has been arrested for allegedly throwing a chair from the 
 
 roof of a bar in Nashville. The chair landed just feet from two police officers.
 
Wallen is charged with three felony counts of reckless endangerment, his attorney says he is cooperating.
 
Well, next, Bonnie Tyler, eat your heart out. We meet the couples giving Total Eclipse of the Heart a new meaning, as they prepare to say I do 
 
 during the celestial event.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:51:35]
 
ANDERSON: Well, whether it's Pink Floyd or Bonnie Tyler, there is nothing quite like a solar eclipse to grab the world's attention. Well, in the next 
 
 few hours, parts of North America will finally begin to see the moon completely block out the sun for a few minutes. Whether depending.
 
These are images of when it happened in Chile five years ago. More than 30 million people in the U.S. alone will experience this year's total eclipse. 
 
 The forecast for part of the path of totality as it's known, could ruin the view of this once in a lifetime experience though for many.
 
Meteorologists Elisa Raffa has the details.
 
ELISA RAFFA, CNN METEOROLOGIST: We are watching those clouds so closely on the path of totality. It looks like we have a storm system though 
 
 developing on the southern end of the path where a severe risk is growing for damaging winds, large hail, even isolated tornadoes from Texas into 
 
 Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana.
 
The good news is though, it looks like the storms do blow up after the eclipse. We've got a couple of showers kind of right as the eclipse is 
 
 starting, that partial eclipse and then, they blow up right after that peak, probably after three or 4:00.
 
So, you might have a one to two-hour window to seek shelter. If you're in a place like Dallas outside to watch the Eclipse. Though, it will come with 
 
 cloud cover mostly cloudy skies in Dallas temperatures in the 70s. 1:42 is your total solar eclipse time, then, it ends at 3:00, and those storms will 
 
 fire up shortly after.
 
It's all part of the system that kind of stalls right near that path of totality, bringing you some showers from middle Tennessee, and then over 
 
 towards the Carolinas.
 
We do have some clouds that will come with it from Texas into Louisiana on the southern end of the path. Some clearing, across the Ohio Valley. And 
 
 even some clearing in New England too. Also, looks like a pretty good spot to catch the total solar eclipse.
 
If you're looking at some places like Little Rock, where we'll have some mostly cloudy skies a little bit close to that system, your totalities at 
 
 1:51. Place like Rochester, also, finding some mostly cloudy skies with your peak at 3:20.
 
Now, what's so cool about this too is we will find temperatures taking a dip while you have the peak totality of that shadow, because it's cutting 
 
 off the energy from the sun. So, those temperatures are going to briefly come down and will pop back up once the shadow moves away from the sun, and 
 
 we get those temperatures to rebound.
 
So, something that we'll have to watch out for closely. So not only will you experience the total darkness in totality, you'll experience that 
 
 temperature drop, the relative humidity increases as the temperatures dip closer to that dew point the winds could have decreased too. And so could 
 
 your cloud cover.
 
ANDERSON: Right. For some people it's not just a solar spectacle that is in the air if they can see it. It is love. Stephanie Elam is at a mess -- a 
 
 mess wedding? A mass wedding in Arkansas, Steph.
 
STEPHANIE ELAM, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I do have a mass wedding coming up later. But right now, Becky, I thought she would like to see some Beatles? 
 
 Maybe, you want to see some Beatles? (INAUDIBLE) beetle.
 
How about some Liverpool legends? Why don't we go with that? What do you guys think about that?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: oh, yes, yes.
 
ELAM: All right. What are your names?
 
DAVE, PLAY AS PAUL IN BEATLES: Hi, I'm Dave. I play Paul in the group.
 
MARTY SCOTT, PLAY AS GEORGE IN BEATLES: I'm Marty Scott. I played George.
 
JOE, PLAY AS JOHN IN BEATLES: Hello, I'm Joe. I played John.
 
REAGAN, PLAY AS RINGO IN BEATLES Hey, I'm Reagan, and I play Ringo.
 
ELAM: OK. And so, you guys are going to be performing right after the eclipse. Are you going to be able to enjoy the eclipse happening, or are 
 
 you going to be too focused on playing, Here Comes the Sun?
 <br>[10:55:08]
 
SCOTT: Oh, well, the game is glasses. So, we'll probably just kind of turn around as we are singing. I don't know. It's an interesting show for us. 
 
 We've never done -- we've done a lot of things in our life, never opened up for the sun.
 
ELAM: Well, I mean, that's a -- that's the biggest opening there could ever be, I think.
 
SCOTT: For sure.
 
ELAM: So, yes. Just to let you know, they are here in Arkansas. We are in Russellville, Arkansas. Some 358 couples are scheduled to get married right 
 
 before the eclipse. And then, they will pause, everyone is going to look up at the sky. And then, there is going to be the first dance and that first 
 
 song will be played by these legends right here.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
 
ELAM: And so, that is what is going to happen here. We're in a big soccer field. You see we've got hot air balloons out here. There's just a lot of 
 
 excitement. And also, most importantly, Becky, the sun is actually out right now. And we do have some thin clouds, but we should be able to see 
 
 the eclipse.
 
So, before we go, guys, can you just play like a little bit for us right now as we go back? Go for it.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Here comes the sun. Here comes the sun, and I say It's all right.
 
Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter -- 
 
ELAM: All right. There you go, Becky. We're having a great time out here.
 
ANDERSON: A long lonely winter.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Little darling.
 
ANDERSON: Little darling. It's wonderful. Good on you. Thank you, chaps, thank you, Steph. That's it for CONNECT THE WORKLD. I'm Becky Anderson. 
 
 "AMANPOUR" is up next.
