MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN ANCHOR: Hello and welcome, everyone. I'm Michael Holmes. Appreciate your company.
 <br>[00:00:33]
 
Coming up on CNN NEWSROOM, a bottleneck of humanitarian aid sitting on the side of the road, despite what Israel is calling a tactical pause along a route in Southern Gaza. 
 
Taking action to prevent violence against women. The Australian state of Victoria appointing an official in charge of men's behavior change. I'll speak with him live. 
 
And CNN speaks one-on-one with Bryson DeChambeau after winning his second U.S. Open title.
 
ANNOUNCER: Live from Atlanta, this is CNN NEWSROOM with Michael Holmes.
 
HOLMES: Despite Israel's, quote, "tactical pause" to allow more aid into Gaza, there was little for Palestinian Muslims to celebrate on Sunday. Eid al-Adha is normally a joyous celebration. There were prayers amid the rubble, like this event in Khan Younis.
 
But with many Palestinians hungry, there wasn't much of a feast. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MAHMOUD ABDEL JAWAD, PALESTINIAN IN GAZA (through translator): As you know, the Eid is for all Muslims. And for us, it is sacrificing animals to shed blood.
 
But this Eid, there isn't any sign of that. Rather than sacrifice animals, now, we sacrifice ourselves. We sacrifice our own bodies, but there's no Eid celebrations in Gaza.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) HOLMES: The death toll in Gaza is now more than 37,300, according to Gaza's Ministry of Health.
 
The tactical pause ordered over the weekend created confusion at the highest levels of Israel's government, one source telling CNN the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, was unhappy when he first heard about it, until he was assured that the fighting in Rafah will continue. 
 
CNN's Oren Liebermann is in Haifa with more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The tactical pause announced over the weekend by the Israeli military is intended to get more humanitarian aid into Gaza. 
 
Israel says there about 1,000 trucks waiting at the Kerem Shalom crossing, and that's one of the only functional crossings at this point, especially as the Rafah --
 
LIEBERMANN: -- border crossing between Israel, or rather between Egypt and Gaza, is currently shut down. 
 
The goal of this tactical pause, which will go from eight in the morning until 7 p.m., so 11 hours a day --
 
LIEBERMANN (voice-over): -- will allow trucks of humanitarian aid, more of them, to flow in through Kerem Shalom to the European hospital in Khan Younis. So just North of Rafah there. 
 
The intent here is to alleviate some of the major problems across Gaza. That is, concerns about sanitation, sewage. The U.N. warning that some 50,000 children are suffering from malnutrition, as well as concerns over famine, especially in Northern Gaza.
 
The U.N. welcomed the announcement of the tactical pause but also said this isn't enough, and more aid needs to get through. It's a serious concern, of course, especially as the U.S.-built pier that was meant to flow humanitarian aid through a maritime corridor isn't functioning right now because of heavy seas. 
 
Now, according to an Israeli official --
 
LIEBERMANN: -- when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu found out about the tactical pause, he was -- he said it was unacceptable to his military secretary until he was reassured that the fighting in Rafah would continue. 
 
And at least from what we've seen so far, that fighting did continue on Saturday over the weekend. But it raises the question of who then gave the order to conduct the tactical pause, an order that was given, presumably, to the military from its civilian leadership and perhaps from the war cabinet, or from the security cabinet. 
 
That question, at this point, remains unanswered. We'll only begin to see the effect of this tactical pause over the next few days as aid begins to, or at least is supposed to begin flowing in, in greater numbers.

HOLMES: Now, one of the eight Israeli soldiers killed in Rafah over the weekend was buried Sunday in Israel's national cemetery. 
 
Eliyahu Moshe Zimbalist was among those killed when their vehicle was hit by an explosion on Saturday. Hamas says it was behind the attack.
 
Zimbalist was posthumously promoted to sergeant. At the funeral, his sister saying he was the best brother ever.
 
Meanwhile, tensions escalating at Israel's Northern border with Lebanon. Israel and Hezbollah have been ramping up cross-border attacks after months of low-intensity fighting.
 
There are concerns about another war stretching Israel's military while it's still fully engaged in Gaza, and also ramping up incursions into the West Bank. 
 
But there are some in Israel who say the country should take broader action there. CNN's Ben Wedeman with more.
 <br>[00:05:02]
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
 
BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Every day the message goes out from South Lebanon, in slick propaganda videos accompanied by a stirring soundtrack: Hezbollah's ready to go from daily skirmishes to full-scale war with Israel. 
 
Mired in what appears to be an unwinnable war in Gaza, Israel has vowed to turn its military might on Hezbollah. Earlier this month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the border, saying, "We are prepared for very strong action in the North." 
 
But the Iranian-backed group is by far the most formidable, battle- hardened foe Israel has faced on its borders since the 1973 October War. 
 
After its guerillas forced Israel to pull out of South Lebanon 24 years ago in 2006, Hezbollah fought Israel to a standstill, although the war left parts of Beirut and much of Southern Lebanon in ruins. 
 
Retired Lebanese Army Brigadier General Elias Hanna knows the militant group well. 
 
BRIG. GEN. ELIAS HANNA (RET.), LEBANESE ARMY: Hezbollah is an exclusive club: well-disciplined, monitored, and they have, which is the most important issue, the charismatic leader. 
 
WEDEMAN (voice-over): Since October, Israeli strikes have killed more than 300 Hezbollah fighters, including last week, high-ranking Commander Taleb Abdullah, given a hero's farewell in Beirut.
 
At the funeral, senior Hezbollah leader Hashem Safieddine warned, "We will increase our operations in intensity and force, in quantity and quality." 
 
Analysts believe Iran has provided Hezbollah with an arsenal of sophisticated, long-range missiles capable of reaching Tel Aviv and beyond.
 
Until now, Hezbollah has mostly limited its strikes to military targets along the rugged, mountainous frontier, hitting Israel's extensive network of surveillance posts. 
 
It also says it has taken out an Iron Dome battery, the backbone of Israel's missile defenses, and has used ground-to-air missiles to shoot down three top-of-the-line Hermes 900 drones, in the process, forcing tens of thousands of Israelis to flee their homes in the North. 
 
Hezbollah is learning faster than Israel can adapt, says Hanna.
 
HANNA: They are learning. It's like a learning process. It's like trial and error. 
 
So as far as you go in time, you are seeing more intensity, more combined use of weapon, and then more in-depth and more effectiveness against the Israelis. And what is the problem that the Israelis have? No, I have no answer for that. 
 
WEDEMAN (voice-over): Since October, Israel is bolstered its forces on the border and held exercises to prepare for war. 
 
Hezbollah is also ready for war, a war that is just one miscalculation away. 
 
Ben Wedeman, CNN, Beirut.

HOLMES: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrapped his peace summit in Switzerland with a warning: There will be no lasting peace if Ukraine doesn't maintain territorial integrity.
 
This coming after Russian President Vladimir Putin unveiled his terms for a so-called peace proposal on Friday: maximalist demands, which many called a surrender demand. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Ladies and gentlemen --
 
HOLMES (voice-over): A path to peace in Ukraine was the ultimate goal that, after a two-day summit in Switzerland, attended by more than 100 countries and international organizations, that outcome's still elusive. 
 
From the beginning, there was little chance of making meaningful headway. Russia was not invited. China did not attend. 
 
Still, it was a show of continued support from Ukraine's Western allies, although Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy did offer one way for peace talks to begin. 
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Regarding negotiations with Russia, I think I've said it in a detailed manner. Russia can start negotiations with us tomorrow, not waiting for anything, if it retreats from our lawful territory. 
 
HOLMES (voice-over): Russia has dismissed the summit. And on Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin laid out his terms for peace talks, namely the withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from four provinces that Moscow only partially controls and claims to have annexed. And Ukraine abandon its bid to join NATO. Proposals neither side will accept. 
 <br>[00:10:06]
 
Even at the summit, there were some divisions on a final statement, which most delegations signed, reaffirming the importance of Ukraine's territorial integrity and political independence. And calling for Ukraine to, once again, control the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. 
 
But there were key holdouts who did not sign the communique, including India, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and the United Arab Emirates, who have trade relations with Russia. 
 
Attendees say a follow-up summit is possible, and the joint statement cited the need for dialogue between all parties in order to reach peace, though just how and when to engage with Russia was left unanswered. And some leaders left skeptical. 
 
URSULA VON DER LEYEN, EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESIDENT: Putin is not serious about ending the war. He's insisting on capitulation. He's insisting on ceding Ukrainian territory, even territory that today does not -- is not occupied by him.
 
He's insisting on disarming Ukraine, leaving it vulnerable to future aggression. No country would ever accept these outrageous terms. 
 
HOLMES (voice-over): Meanwhile, the war grinds on, with Russian forces still holding a fifth of Ukraine and gaining ground in some frontline villages. 
 
There haven't been peace talks in more than two years, and the discussions held in Switzerland right now make no difference on the battlefield.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HOLMES: Meantime, some Ukrainian soldiers are hoping for more weapons and equipment as they try to push back Russian advances near the border. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
"KUZIA," UKRAINIAN TANK COMMANDER (through translator): I think that good sense will prevail. Good sense of the world's country's political leaders will prevail, and we will be given weapons. We will chase away the enemy from the territory of Ukraine, because you can talk to them only from the position of strength.
 
"FIERCE," UKRAINIAN TANK GUNNER (through translator): I would ask for more aviation, giving him and the resources we have on the ground now. We managed to hold the enemy and even to take back the territories. But we have a very big weakness in the air.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HOLMES: Military bloggers say that fierce fighting continues in a Ukrainian town in Kharkiv region. The Ukrainian squad commander describing the situation as difficult but controlled, saying Russian troops are surrounded.
 
The Kremlin claims its forces have been trying to create a buffer zone at the border that could help protect Russian cities like Belgorod.
 
U.S. President Joe Biden is warning Americans that a second Trump presidency would be catastrophic for the nation. At a star-studded Los Angeles fundraiser, he framed this year's presidential election as an inflection point in U.S. history, hoping this will rally more support for his reelection campaign.
 
Priscilla Alvarez reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: President Biden over the weekend underscored the stakes of the election --
 
ALVAREZ (voice-over): -- at a glitzy fundraiser in Los Angeles and a conversation that was moderated by Jimmy Kimmel.
 
The president warned about a second Donald Trump presidency, but he did so this time by focusing on the Supreme Court, saying that in the next four years, it's possible that there will be more vacancies on the Supreme Court. And pose the question as to what that could mean if it was Donald Trump as president during that time.
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The next president is likely to have two new Supreme Court nominees. Two more; two more. He's already appointed two that are -- have been very negative in terms of the rights of individuals.
 
The idea that, if he's reelected, he's going to appoint two more flying flags upside-down is really -- I -- I really mean it.
 
JIMMY KIMMEL, BIDEN FUNDRAISER HOST: Could this be -- could this be the scariest part of all of it? BIDEN: Well, I think it is one of the scariest parts of it. Look, the
 
 Supreme Court has never been as out-of-kilter as it is today.
 
After the decision that overruled Roe v. Wade, the Dobbs decision, you had Clarence Thomas talking about the fact that there are going to be other things we should reconsider, including in vitro fertilization, including contraception, including all these things. 
 
ALVAREZ: The president in talking there about reproductive freedoms, a galvanizing issue for the Biden campaign. And one that they have fanned out across the country to talk about and to make the argument that they are at risk, reproductive freedoms are at risk if Donald Trump were to win a second term. 
 
But seated next to President Biden was also former President Barack Obama, who also talked about the values of candidates. And that, too, should be considered by voters when they go to the polls. 
 
But this was also an event that would -- that allowed Democrats to rake in more money. And indeed, this was the largest ever Democratic fundraiser, with more than $30 million raised.
 <br>[00:15:04] 
 
And that is the momentum that the Biden campaign is trying to keep going into November as they also try to maintain that cash advantage over Donald Trump.

HOLMES: And do be sure to tune in later this month as CNN hosts the U.S. presidential debate. It happens Thursday, June 20, 9 p.m. Eastern Time in the U.S. That's 9 a.m. Friday in Hong Kong. 
 
Quick break on the program. When we come back, the Chinese premier visiting Australia for the first time in seven years. We'll have more on that.
 
Also in Australia, one state has created a parliamentary position to address shocking levels of violence against women. I'll talk to the man appointed to that post, straight ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HOLMES: Record-breaking flooding is forcing more than 11,000 people to flee their homes in Southeast China. Chinese state media says heavy rainfall across Fujian and Guangdong provinces has caused 17 rivers to flood, triggering power outages and other damage. 
 
One county recorded 375 millimeters of rain in just over 24 hours. 
 
Landslide alerts have been issued for multiple counties. 
 
Australia's prime minister officially welcomes Chinese Premier Li Qiang to the start of a four-day visit to the country. The two nations have reached memorandums of understanding to address issues including trade practices, investment, and climate change. 
 
This is the first visit to Australia by a Chinese premier in seven years and the latest sign of thawing relations between Beijing and Canberra. 
 
Beijing has eased economic pressure on Australian goods, while state media now says China will provide Australia -- Australia's Adelaide Zoo with new pandas.
 
China loans out pandas to nations, of course, as tokens of friendship. 
 
And staying in Australia, where 31 women have been killed in gender- based violence this year, the state of Victoria has created a new position: parliamentary secretary for men's behavior change. 
 
Recent rallies against gender-based violence helped to prompt the government to take the action. The new post is a state-level office, but Australia's prime minister says the problem is a national one. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANTHONY ALBANESE, AUSTRALIAN PRIME MINISTER: We want to change this. we want to change this in a way in which we all have to take responsibility, because violence against women is not a women's problem to solve. It is a whole-of-society problem to solve. 
 
And men in particular have -- have to take responsibility.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HOLMES: And the statistics on domestic violence are truly horrifying in Australia, according to one organization, Our Watch, one woman is killed every nine days by a current or former partner. 
 <br>[00:20:06]
 
One in three women has experienced physical violence since the age of 15, and one in two women experiences sexual harassment in their lifetime.
 
And I'm pleased to be joined by the man appointed to the new position, Tim Richardson, Victorian state M.P. and parliamentary secretary for men's behavior change. 
 
Welcome, Minister. I guess the real shame is that there is a need for a parliamentary secretary for men's behavior change anywhere. But here we are. 
 
And we just heard the statistics. Very sobering. One other one, too. Intimate partner violence contributes more death, disability and illness in women, aged 25 to 44, than any other preventable risk factor. 
 
So tell me more about how this initiative is going to change that, and how difficult is it to turn that ship around.
 
TIM RICHARDSON, PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY FOR MEN'S BEHAVIOR CHANGE: Thank you, Michael. And good to be with your viewers here. Those are startling statistics. 
 
And we're seeing people across Australia take to the streets to call for changes, and that enough is enough. 
 
And as we heard from our prime minister, Anthony Albanese, it starts with a whole community approach.
 
And so this role, appointed by our premier in Victoria, Jacinta Allan, looks to put that accountability at boys and men and that it's not all men, but all men and boys can make a difference, and it starts with us. 
 
And some of those damaging stereotypes and norms that we see in community and the cultural change that we need to go on into the future is going to make that change. The Australian government has a target to end gender-based violence in a generation, and it starts in our communities. 
 
HOLMES: I -- I'm an Australian, albeit an ex-pat here in the U.S. for decades. And -- and, you know, Australia, I think you and I can agree, has had a historical culture of the perhaps macho outback, tough type of bloke. I think you even called it Rostodon (ph) stereotypes.
 
But, you know, is Australia or Victoria any worse than other countries? Or perhaps is there just more of a desire to move proactively to change those things that we were talking about? 
 
RICHARDSON: Well, we still want people to have positive masculinities and positive role models. But we're saying that the change in attitudes towards women and being good upstanders in communities starts with all men and boys. 
 
And so that's -- that's sort of culture and that jovial, larrikin nature that we know as Australians, that can coexist. But respect starts with each and every one of us; and treating women and girls with respect and not having a tolerance for some of that -- some of those damaging gender-based norms. 
 
And as you said, more women than not in Australia have experienced sexual harassment. And one in five have experienced sexual violence. So we need to change that over time. And -- but role modeling is really important. And I think that starts with all men and boys; and that's the mission that were on here in Victoria. 
 
HOLMES: Yes, of course, women's rights took huge leaps forward in the '70s and '80s and so on. But do you think there's been something of an alpha male resurrection in recent years in a negative sense, not in that sort of larrikin type away. I mean, it sometimes feels that way here in the U.S. 
 
And -- and I was reading, when I was looking into this story, in Australia, I know one popular radio host called creating your position part of what he said, "collective punishment" on men. And quoting again, "treating all men like an enemy." 
 
How do you -- I don't think that's true, by the way. But how do you combat that? 
 
RICHARDSON: yes. Well, I reflect on my own circumstances as a -- as a father of two young girls. And I want them to grow up in a community that has respect and safety for all. 
 
And so it's not saying that all men need to change behavior, but we all have a role to play. And we can all make a difference. Being good upstanders and great role models in our lives is a really important thing. 
 
And when we see the innovations in social media and technology, and some really poor and damaging attitudes towards women and girls, we know we're losing ground in that space, as well. 
 
And so we need to see, what does positive and healthy masculinities look like? What does it look like to be a good boy and man in our community, and stand up and support one another, and have those conversations and be able to lead by example.
 
I think that's the real critical thing. And so it's not about taking on masculinities as such. It's about positive and healthy role models and masculinity.
 
It's not, I think, anyone that thinks of their -- you know, as someone close to them. It might be their sister. It might be their mom. It might be my two kids that I reflect on. 
 
And we want them to grow up in a healthy and safe society. And that starts with all of us.
 
HOLMES: Yes. Apart from the obviously far more important impacts on women, which are the physical and emotional one, I was reading, too, there's an economic cost, as well.
 
Australia's Our Watch website pointed out that violence against women in Australia costs Australia, $21.7 billion a year. So there are -- there are myriad impacts of this. 
 
RICHARDSON: Well, that's exactly right, Michael. So there's the -- there's the social traumas and the lived experience traumas that go on. 
 
But then there's a whole societal and economic cost, and that's lost productivity, workplace outcomes, the cost of our judicial system, the housing that's needed to support victims, survivors. The work that you've done (ph) in male accountability and perpetrator accountability. 
 <br>[00:25:06]
 
So all of those investments take tens of billions of dollars. There's got to be a better way. But if we're going to end gender-based violence in a generation, like
 
 the Australian government has the plan, it starts with a societal and cultural change. And that will have economic benefits.
 
Here in Victoria, we role-model that, as well, by having half of our boards, our government boards, are women in leadership. And I think that's a really important role to show and showcase pathways for women's -- women and girls. But also societal attitudes, as well. You see women in leadership. And it really benefits those societal norms and stereotypes, as well. 
 
So the economic cost is massive. If that's all people's motivation was about economics, it makes sense that, from a societal community and safety standpoint, we can't waste a day. 
 
HOLMES: Well put. If I can invoke my Australian heritage after 30 years, it's a bloody good idea, and good luck with it. Tim Richardson, appreciate it. 
 
RICHARDSON: Thanks for your time, Michael. 
 
HOLMES: Good for them.
 
Police in Germany shot a suspect who threatened officers with a pickaxe and an incendiary device in the city of Hamburg on Sunday. 
 
A warning: The video you're about to see is disturbing. 
 
You will see the man out walk towards officers; attempts to climb a barrier initially before being confronted and surrounded.
 
Police stay -- you see him running away there on the left. Police say he was shot in the leg and is receiving medical treatment. 
 
The incident happened just hours before the city was gearing up to host the European football championship match between Poland and the Netherlands. The incident not believed to be related to football, nor linked to terrorism. 
 
Still to come on the program, shocking allegations against British soldiers stationed in Kenya, being investigated after being overlooked for decades. The details when we come back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HOLMES: Kenya is investigating claims of sexual assault committed near a British training base North of Nairobi. 
 
Locals revealed horrific tales of gang rape and other forms of sexual violence by British soldiers to a parliamentary committee investigating the troop's conduct. 
 
Similar complaints have been made for decades. We do warn you: some may find the subject matter disturbing. Our Larry Madowo reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LARRY MADOWO, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): She's just 17, but Marian lives alone in this single-room house, a mixed-race girl in rural Kenya, where nobody looks like her. 
 
MARIAN PANNALOSSY, SEARCHING FOR FATHER: They actually call me, "poor white girl." I don't know why they call me "poor white girl." They always say, Why are you here? Just look for a connection that you will go to your own people. You don't belong in here. 
 <br>[00:30:10]
 
MADOWO (voice-over): Marian's mother, Lydia Duma (ph), was among hundreds of women who accused soldiers from the British Army Training Unit Kenya, BATUK, of rape. 
 
She was interviewed in this 2011 documentary. 
 
LYDIA DUMA (PH), ACCUSED BRITISH SOLDIERS OF RAPE: Because in our tribe, you -- we can't report that thing. It's a big shame if you go and say that you've been raped. 
 
MADOWO (voice-over): Lydia Duma (ph) died two years after that interview, and Marian has never met her father. 
 
She has to fend for herself in a society that ostracizes her.
 
MADOWO: You have not lost hope of finding your father someday?
 
PANNALOSSY: No, I've never lost hope. 
 
MADOWO (voice-over): Mixed-race children keep being born in the remote villages where the British army trains in Kenya. 
 
Generica Namoru says she was in a consensual relationship with a British soldier while she worked at their base. But she claims he has never supported her since she gave birth.
 
GENERICA NAMORU, CLAIMS BRITISH SOLDIER ABANDONED DAUGHTER (through translator): I'm a woman with a white child. It's not easy for my family, especially because of a child's expensive. She's suffering for no good reason. 
 
MADOWO: So you just want him to take responsibility for his daughter?
 
NAMORU: Yes. I want him to take him dedication, health. 
 
MADOWO: Have you ever received a cent from him since she was born? 
 
NAMORU: I've never received any cent. 
 
MADOWO (voice-over): Generica is jobless and says she has unsuccessfully tried to petition local authorities and the British army to find her ex-boyfriend. 
 
The British High Commission told CNN it cooperates with local child support authorities in paternity claims. But the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights says the U.K. government has made no effort to hold soldiers accountable in such cases. 
 
MARION MUTUGI, COMMISSIONER, KENYA NATIONAL COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS: These children really deserve British citizenship. They're British kids. Their fathers were British. 
 
MADOWO: So the British government is just not interested in resolving these cases?
 
MUTUGI: We don't think they are interested. We call it BBBB: British boys behaving badly. 
 
MADOWO (voice-over): The U.K. pays Kenya about $400,000 a year to allow up to 10,000 British soldiers to train in the country. Kenya renewed the five-year deal in 2021, despite opposition from some local groups, lawmakers, and human rights defenders.
 
MUTUGI: We have also had cases where these women and people who have reported have been intimidated. So there is a conspiracy to make sure that justice does not happen for these women. 
 
MADOWO (voice-over): Allegations of rape and other crimes, including murder, by British soldiers in Kenya date back to the 1950s.
 
These elderly women accused BATUK officers of rape in the '70s and '80s in a landmark case in London, over 20 years ago. 
 
Ntoyie Lenkanan says she was one of them.
 
NTOYIE LENKANAN, ACCUSED BRITISH SOLDIERS OF RAPE (through translator): I was going to fetch water when I was ambushed by a group of British soldiers who were hiding in the grass near the river. One of them grabbed me and raped me.
 
MADOWO (voice-over): In 2007, Britain's Ministry of Defense dismissed over 2,000 claims of rape from mostly Maasai and some rural women, saying quote, "There was no reliable evidence to support any single allegation." 
 
The government in Nairobi lost the case files without explanation. 
 
A Royal Military Police investigation concluded that most of the Kenyan evidence appeared to have been fabricated. 
 
One Kenyan official called it a cover-up. They did not conduct DNA tests on any of the 69 mixed-race children alleged to have been born as a result of rape by British soldiers. 
 
Lawyer Kelvin Kubai is working to reintroduce the case in Kenyan courts. 
 
Seventeen-year-old Marian will be the lead plaintiff, taking up a fight her mother didn't win in her lifetime. 
 
KELVIN KUBAI, LAWYER: It is traumatic. And it's psychologically disturbing to people like Marian and many others who continue to see the British training amidst them with all these unresolved trauma and historical injustices.
 
MADOWO (voice-over): Larry Madowo, CNN, Nanyuki, Kenya.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HOLMES: And the British High Commission told CNN that it takes all allegations raised by the community seriously, and it ensures thorough investigations. 
 
It added that all sexual activity and which involves the abuse of power is prohibited. 
 
Crowds of Malawians paying respect to President [SIC] Saulos Chilima, whose body is lying in state in the country's capital. 
 
Chilima died in a plane crash with nine other people last week. 
 
On Sunday, he was honored in a ceremony by Malawi's president and the country's interim opposition leader, along with various dignitaries who said they remember Chilima as a leader with a zeal for peace, prosperity, and a bright future for Malawi. 
 <br>[00:35:09]
 
REBECCA ADDA DONTOH, U.N. RESIDENT COORDINATOR IN MALAWI: The loss of this certain vice president is a huge loss, because this is a vice president who was very visible, very engaging, very energetic, very positive in his outlook. 
 
He was a go-getter for Malawi and had confidence that Malawi was on the right path. 
 
So it means a lot. Many people are mourning, especially young people, who also identified with him.

HOLMES: A fire in California's Los Angeles County has burned more than 14,000 acres, and authorities say it's only 2 percent contained so far. The National Weather Service is warning overnight conditions could potentially fuel the flames. 
 
High wind gusts, along with very dry air, have made it difficult for firefighters to contain the blaze. The area remains under a red flag warning until Monday afternoon. 
 
The fire, which began on Saturday, has forced hundreds of people to evacuate. 
 
Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay says he's lucky to be alive after a recent cycling accident. He took to Instagram on Sunday to underscore the importance of wearing a helmet, while also revealing a massive purple bruise he says he sustained from the accident.

GORDON RAMSAY, CELEBRITY CHEF: As a policy, you've got to wear a helmet. I don't care how short the journey is. I don't care, you know, the fact that these helmets cost money. But they're crucial.
 
Even with the kids, a short journey, they've got to wear helmet. Now, I'm lucky to be standing here. I'm in pain. It's been a brutal week, and I'm sort of getting through it. 
 
But I cannot tell you the importance of wearing a helmet.

HOLMES: Ramsay went on to say he believes the helmet saved his life. CNN has reached out to a representative to Ramsay for comment. 
 
Now, Bryson DeChambeau became U.S. Open champion for the second time after it was a pretty topsy-turvy day of golf towards the end at Pinehurst in North Carolina. 
 
Known as "The Scientist" for his precise and sometimes eccentric approach to the game, DeChambeau applied his calculus to win by one stroke after an early challenge from a surging Rory McIlroy. 
 
McIlroy led at one point after a string of birdies but folded in the homestretch with a string of bogeys. Three of the final four holes, in fact, and narrowly missed out on his fifth major. It's been ten years since he's won one.

DeChambeau held his nerve with a crucial cool-headed shot out of the bunker at 18 to save par, and, at one over for the round, six under for the tournament, secured his second championship in five years.
 
And after that victory, our Patrick Snell caught up with a thankful and thoughtful Bryson DeChambeau.

PATRICK SNELL, CNN WORLD SPORT ANCHOR: Well, Bryson, many congratulations. Second U.S. Open title. It was a crazy, wild finish. Take us out there on the course with you. 
 
You're down the stretch with Rory McIlroy. And I'm wondering, where do you rank that bunker shot at the very last moment? 
 
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU, U.S. OPEN CHAMPION: That bunker shot at the very last was possibly my best golf shot in my entire life. 
 
I didn't know that practicing those 50-yard bunker shots when I was a kid would have brought me to this point at Pinehurst No. 2 to one, my second U.S. Open, but sure enough, it did, and couldn't be more proud.
 
SNELL: Yes, little place in history. Absolutely. It's one of the wonderful images from this whole week, your engagement with the fans. You told me earlier in the week, though, that you know, three years ago, the landscape was very different for you and that you could have handled things differently. 
 
Compare that to that euphoria and the warmth you felt all weekend at Pinehurst.
 
DECHAMBEAU: A lot of personal growth. 2022 was a rock-bottom year for me and pushed me to be the person I am today. And I've got a lot of people that stuck around me from 2022, which has allowed me to be the person I've grown to be now. And I can't thank them enough, because without them, I wouldn't be here. 
 
And it's been a long road, but I'm certainly very blessed and thankful to have those individuals sticking with me and continuing to push me forward.
 
SNELL: The memory of your late father, Jon, is of course, forever special, especially so on Father's Day. What would he have said to you about this victory? And how did he inspire you to achieve this title? 
 
DECHAMBEAU: He'd have probably said, why'd you pull it on 18 off the tee shot, knowing him and his witty humor. But he would have been smiling, hugging me, and giving me a lot of praise. So he was a good man. 
 
SNELL: Did you feel his presence out there?
 
DECHAMBEAU: All day. There was numerous times on two, three, four, or even five where I was just thinking -- I was walking down the fairway thinking about him. 
 
As much as I was engaging with the fans, they're at the forefront of my mind, still.

HOLMES: That's a new Bryson these days. Good for him.
