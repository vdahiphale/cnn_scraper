(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANNA COREN, CNN ANCHOR:  Welcome to our viewers from all around the world. I'm Anna Coren, live from Hong Kong. 
 
Ahead on CNN Newsroom, firing back. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNKNOWN:  Our military will firmly respond to it. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COREN:  Well, South Korea responds to North Korea's 10 missiles launches with a page from their own book.
 
In Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu says he's on the cusp of a huge victory. But Yair Lapid urges patience until all the votes are counted. We're live in Jerusalem. 
 
And how Iranian missiles could change the dynamic on the battlefield in Ukraine. We'll be live in Kyiv.
 
Well, South Korean officials say they fired three air-to-surface missiles in response to a series of North Korean missile launches just hours earlier. The military says it carried out precision strikes targeting the international waters south of the de facto into Korean maritime border. 
 
Early Wednesday, Pyongyang launched 10 missiles of various types, including three ballistic missiles. The South Korean president called the launches effective territorial encroachment. The launches follow warnings from Pyongyang on Monday for the U.S. and South Korea to stop their large-scale joint military operations which began this week. 
 
For more on these latest developments, I'm joined by CNN's Will Ripley in Seoul for us. Will, this is certainly a much more defensive response from South Korea than what we've seen in the. 
 
WILL RIPLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes. And, and a far more offensive response, sort of offensive provocation, I should say, Anna, than we've seen in quite a while. It's been at least, several months since North Korea has launched this many missiles in a single day.
 
Back in June, they launched eight in one day. Today, 10 various types of missiles, as you mentioned, including ballistic missiles. The 29th launch event of this year. It is truly an unprecedented blitz, a missile testing binge, if you will, by North Korean leader Kim Jong- un.
 
South Korea's Ministry of National Defense says that these missiles were fired from both the east and the west coast of North Korea, including the coastal city of Wonsan, a place that I visited five years ago. A place where also Kim Jong-un happens to have one of his luxury palaces right along the seaside. 
 
These missiles, according to the Japanese, some of them had, what they're calling an irregular trajectory, which indicates that they might be the kind that can change course mid-flight and make them particularly difficult, if not impossible to shoot down.
 
This is the first time also that some of these missiles have crossed since, if I should say the first time since the division of the Korean Peninsula, these missiles went south of what's known as the northern limit line. That's the de facto maritime border between the North and South. 
 
And so, in response, South Korea and the United States conducted a precision strike bombing exercise using fighter jets. And they fired surface to, or I should say, air-to-surface missiles to the north of that de facto maritime border. The joint chiefs of staff says that North Korea is the one that's provoking them, they say, North Korea is fully responsible for all of this.
 
But they have a different view in the north of course. The North is angry and they've been issuing warnings in recent days about Operation Vigilant Storm, which is a five-day military exercise between South Korea and the United States involving 240 aircraft, thousands of service members from both South Korea and the U.S. 
 
The North has called this in recent days an invasion rehearsal, and they have threatened that the United States and South Korea will pay a terrible price if they do try to attack in the north towards North Korea. 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the North, said that there will be even more powerful follow up measures to come if these military exercises continue. So, this could be a very tense several days here in the region, Anna. 
 
Of course, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog group has been warning since last week that there could be a nuclear test on the horizon, but the fact that you have these missiles actually cross into, you know, very near South Korea's territorial waters, triggering air grade sirens, in some of the islands off of the Korean peninsula. It is just truly an extraordinary day. 
 
And tomorrow, on Thursday, the U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and the South Korean Defense Minister Lee Jong-sup will be meeting at the Pentagon in the U.S. So certainly, they will have quite a lot to talk about, Anna. 
 
COREN:  Absolutely. Will Ripley joining us from Seoul. We appreciate the update.
 <br>[03:04:59]
 
Israel's fifth general election in four years came with plenty of exasperation, but that did not keep voters from the polls. Election authorities put turnout at more than 71 percent, the highest of all these recent votes. Final results are expected by Thursday. And it appears former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is on the cusp of another comeback.
 
His Likud Party is already bringing out the bubbles after exit polls showed their alliance has scraped together a narrow majority.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  I intend to form a strong national steady government. I think the atmosphere has changed. I can feel it. I hear from the people and they say, we now want the real change. We want to return the state of Israel to the place it deserves, and I intend to do it together with my friends.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COREN:  And Bibi's friends include Israel's far-right parties who propelled Likud to its likely majority after more than doubling their representation in the Knesset if the exit polls turn out to be correct. But Netanyahu's main rival, the acting prime minister says it's not over until every last vote is counted.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
YAIR LAPID, ISRAELI DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  We have no intention to stop. We have no intention to cease every Israeli citizen.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
LAPID:  Religious or secular, left as to right, as Jewish or Arab, straight, or LGBT should know tonight that we will continue to fight for Israel to be a Jewish and democratic, liberal and progressive state. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COREN:  Well, journalist Neri Zilber comes to us live from Jerusalem. And Neri, as you could hear, Yair Lapid is not giving up. But do we think that the exit polls are correct? NERI ZILBER, JOURNALIST:  Well, good morning, Anna. So, as of 9 a.m.
 
 Israel time, we've had about 70 percent of the actual votes come in and it seems like the exit polls were correct in the sense that they were predicted a Netanyahu victory, that he would secure a parliamentary majority. And if anything, that lead that majority seems to be growing just based on the actual votes coming in. 
 
And on the other side of the ledger, the anti-Netanyahu forces, the anti-Netanyahu camp, seems to be in major trouble with at least several left-wing and Arab parties dangerously closed to the electoral threshold, so they might not even make it into the next Israeli parliament, thereby potentially increasing Netanyahu's parliamentary majority and paving its way, as you've said, to a likely comeback as the exit polls predicted. 
 
COREN:  Now, as we know, Netanyahu's formed an alliance with some ultranationalist parties. Let me read to you some of their slogans that they've said in the last 24 hours. The time has come for us to be the landlord of our country. The public voted for a Jewish identity. 
 
I mean, this could be one of the most right-wing governments in Israeli history. 
 
ZILBER:  That's right, Anna. And I would venture to say that if Netanyahu does form the next government with what he has termed these natural partners of his, it would arguably be Israel's most right-wing government ever. This religious Zionism Party, this far-right alliance of several smaller factions, really has been promoting, like you said, a Jewish identity. 
 
Its policy prescriptions include things like deport -- deporting, rather, citizens deemed disloyal, loosening the Israeli military's rules of engagement of live fire against Palestinians in the West Bank. Revoking citizenship, for those Arab Israelis deemed to be disloyal or perhaps meddling in terrorism, and so on and so forth.
 
It's a long litany of policy prescriptions and it's important to note, if Netanyahu forms the next government along with this religious Zionism Party, they will be his senior most coalition partners. They will have major influence on him as prime minister and the potential policies of the next Israeli government.
 
COREN:  Certainly, does not bode well for centrist and Arab Israelis. Neri Zilber joining us from Jerusalem, we appreciate the update. Thank you. 
 
One of the biggest challenges for the new Israeli prime minister will be tackling inflation. It rose to 5.2 percent back in July, which was a 14-year-high. It's now down to 4.6 percent. Thanks in part to forceful moves by the Bank of Israel. 
 
Its benchmark interest rate is now 2.75 percent the highest in a decade. A recent survey found the cost of living was the top issue of nearly half of Israeli voters. 
 
The election also comes amid soaring tensions with Palestinians who are skeptical a political solution can ever be reached if Netanyahu was back in charge and far-right parties potentially gain more power within the Israel government. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUSSAM DOTASH, PALESTINIAN PRESIDENT OF HEBRON, WEST BANK (through translator):  We already experienced Netanyahu's policy. His policy is always the same. It will never change. We know its impact on the Palestinian people. Netanyahu and his party will benefit from all of that, but the Palestinian people will not. They will not benefit whether economically or socially or in terms of peace and security stability.
 <br>[03:10:09]
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COREN:  Well, the run up to this election has coincided with growing violence in the West Bank. 
 
We're following developments out of Ukraine where officials say the southern city of Nikopol and a nearby town along the Dnipro River were hit by multiple rocket launches overnight. 
 
Well, this as Ukraine reports that Russian forces are keeping up their barrage of artillery and rocket attacks on the front lines of the war, with parts of the Donetsk region among the hardest. Ukraine says more than 50 settlements were hit in 24 hours from Kharkiv in the north to Zaporizhzhia in the south. 
 
Meantime, Russia could soon get a boost on the battlefield. As we learn, Iran is preparing to send the country more weapons. Western officials tell CNN about a thousand additional weapons are expected to be sent to Russia, which will include attack drones.
 
Well, CNN correspondents are tracking all these developments. Salma Abdelaziz joins us from Kyiv, and Clare Sebastian is live from London. 
 
Salma, let's start with you. We know that a major battle is gearing in Kherson with Ukrainian officials saying that they are determined to take it back no matter how high the cost. Tell us more.
 
SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN REPORTER:  Absolutely. This really could be the next big moment in Ukraine's counter offensive that has successfully grabbed back a great deal of territory in recent weeks and months. Kherson is critical. Both sides reporting an intensification of fighting. Russian backed officials saying, that earlier this week 70 people were killed and military equipment was destroyed by Ukrainian shelling. 
 
Ukraine for its part saying that Russian troops are firing upon communities and surrounding villages and areas, putting innocents at risk. I just want to pull up a map, Anna, to show you exactly why this is such an important and strategic city for President Putin. And of course, for the Ukrainians to take back. It's right there on the Dnipro River, a vital supply route. It's just
 
 north of Russian occupied Crimea, and it's that corridor that connects Russian occupied Crimea to those other Russian occupied areas, Mariupol up through the Donbas. So very critical corridor there that the Kremlin is not going to back down from easily. 
 
And then of course, there's the propaganda side of this. The P.R. side of this. Kherson was taken on the seventh day of the invasion. It was boosted as a major victory for President Putin. so, absolutely, Russian troops are going to dig in as much as possible and try to hold onto that city. 
 
Ukrainian officials reporting that Russian backed officials on the ground are spreading misinformation to try to force civilians to evacuate their homes. Russian backed officials saying that these are evacuations, that these are tens of thousands of people who need to get out of the battle zone. It is a major population center, so we are yet again going to be looking at innocents just caught there in the crosshairs, Anna. 
 
COREN:  Clare, if I can now go to you. Let's talk about the reports Iran is planning to send a batch of more than 200 combat drones among other weaponry to Russia. This will obviously only further pressure on Ukraine's already challenged air defenses. 
 
CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, this is a report from Ukrainian military intelligence that would suggest that the delivery of drones, that it's believed by Western officials and Ukrainians took place over the summer that has formed the backbone of this strategy shift by Russia. These new attacks on Ukraine's civilian energy infrastructure. That that was not a one off. 
 
Ukrainian military intelligence say they expect another 200 drones, combat drones to be delivered to Russia at the beginning of this month. So around now crucially, they would include not only the Shahed drones, those small disposable drones that we've already seen in action on the battlefield, but a larger model, the Arash-2, a newer model with a much bigger payload. So that would be an alarming development for Ukraine. 
 
That report comes on top of a report that CNN put out on Tuesday, citing western officials who monitor Iran's weapons program closely that that a delivery of a thousand weapons to Russia is on the cards, including not only drones, but surface-to- surface missiles, precision guided missiles. This would really be a step up in that, essentially trade relationship that we're now seeing between Russia and Iran. 
 
Now, this of course, suggests that Russia has found a new route to resupply its military, that it is having trouble doing domestically because of sanctions. And that is something that Ukraine's ambassador to the U.S. was keen to point out. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
OKSANA MARKAROVA, UKRAINE'S AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S. So right before the winter, they're destroying the heat, water supply, electricity supply. And unfortunately, they're doing it not only with their weapons. It must be very embarrassing to them to turn to Iran for weapons. 
 <br>[03:14:58]
 
But again, Iranian regime like Belarus decided to be accomplice of Russia in this war of aggression.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEBASTIAN:  So, both Russia and Iran continue to deny that this is happening, that that this supply of drones is taking place. And meanwhile as you suggested, this is going to put more pressure on Ukraine's air defense System.
 
President Zelenskyy held a call with President Macron of France, where President Macron pledge to do more essentially to back up Ukraine's air defense systems and help them get through winter. So, it seems that as of yet, western support for Ukraine is not waning as a result of this. 
 
COREN:  Clare Sebastian in London, Salma Abdelaziz in Kyiv. Many thanks to you both.
 
Well, Vladimir Putin's unprovoked war on Ukraine has faced strong criticism from some prominent Russians. And now, one billionaire says he's renouncing his Russian citizenship in protest. 
 
CNN's Matthew Chance has the details.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): He's one of the most high-profile richest Russians to publicly condemn the Ukraine war. The billionaire who founded the Tinkoff Bank, one of Russia's biggest lenders now renouncing his Russian citizenship. A major slap to the Kremlin's face.
 
He's even posted the termination document online along with scathing criticism of the Russian state.
 
I can't and won't be associated with a fascist country, Tinkoff wrote on his Instagram page, a country that started a war with that peaceful nation. He went even further calling on other wealthy Russians to also leave the country behind. I hope more prominent Russian businessmen will follow me, Tinkov writes, so it weakens Putin's regime and his economy and puts him eventually towards defeat.
 
The post was quickly deleted, which Tinkov blames on Kremlin trolls. It's not the first time Tinkov has publicly criticized Putin and his Ukrainian conflict. But these almost daily scenes of violence and its horrors seem to have galvanized the billionaire.
 
Back in May Tinkov who is suffering from cancer spoke of how his own fight for survival made it impossible to stay silent in the face of so much killing. 
 
OLEG TINKOV, FOUNDER, TINKOFF BANK (through translator):  You see kids, women, people dying for nothing, being murdered by someone. I mean, the Russian army is killing them for nothing. You can die from cancer, but why should you die from a bomb just because you live in Ukraine? This is messed up, especially in the 21st century.
 
CHANCE:  -- in a way to try and repay that debt, Mr. Deripaska.
 
Of course, there have been other prominent Russian billionaires who criticized the Ukraine war, even Oleg Deripaska, a metals magnate known to be close to Putin has called it a colossal mistake, though stopping short of blaming the kremlin.
 
OLEG DERIPASKA, RUSSIAN INDUSTRIALIST:  Get lost, please. 
 
CHANCE:  And earlier this month, another billionaire investor, Yuri Milner, said he renounced his Russian passport too. Tinkov seen here in London, where despite British sanctions, he still spends much of his time, says he only ever met Putin once for a beer more than 20 years ago. But he says he hates Putin's Russia and he's now severing himself from it altogether of what he calls Putin's crazy war.

COREN:  Well, much more still to come this hour, including -- Supporters of Brazilian Presidents Jair Bolsonaro remain defiant as the far-right leader finally breaks his silence days after losing reelection.
 
And as mourning claim the belongings of their loved ones, CNN speaks exclusively to friends of some of those killed in the deadly crowd crush in South Korea.
 <br>[03:20:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
COREN:  Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has finally broken his silence days after losing his reelection bid to leftist former leader, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Mr. Bolsonaro gave a speech from the presidential palace Tuesday where he vowed to abide by the Constitution. He notably did not explicitly concede defeat, but his chief of staff says he'll work with the incoming government.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CIRO NOGUEIRA, CHIEF OF STAFF, BRAZILIAN PRESIDENCY (through translator):  President Jair Bolsonaro has authorized to be when prompted. Based on the law, we will begin the transition process. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COREN:  Well, the chief of staff there signaling Mr. Bolsonaro's cooperation with the transfer of power. Brazil's Supreme Court says the outgoing president effectively acknowledged his loss. Well, Mr. Bolsonaro supporters were listening closely to his first public comments since losing reelection. Many have been blocking major roads and highways to protest his defeat. 
 
And as CNN's Paula Newton reports, some Bolsonaro supporters heard what they wanted to hear from his speech.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PAULA NEWTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  As President Jair Bolsonaro prepare to finally break his silence, police forces across the country move to break up hundreds of blockades, snarling traffic, slowing supply routes, and rattling already frayed nerves. Police were acting on orders to use force, orders that never came from Bolsonaro himself.
 
Instead, in a terse two-minute statement, he said he would respect the Constitution, but he neither admitted defeat nor recognized the results of the election and had this to say to supporters blocking roads across the country.
 
BOLSONARO (through translator):  peaceful demonstrations will always be welcome, but our methods cannot be those of the left like property invasion, destruction of goods, and restrictions on the rights to come and go.
 
NEWTON:  On the barricades. Some of the protestors mounting insurgent campaigns nationwide had this to say. 
 
UNKNOWN (through translator):  This was a statement where he didn't say anything conclusive. It gives us the impression that there was something wrong with the elections. That is a plus for us to continue our stand and keep protesting.
 
NEWTON:  Many here say they are committed to a patriotic cause standing up for the president they elected. 
 
UNKNOWN (through translator):  Country and freedom, just that we don't accept those who won, not just us, but a large part of Brazilian population. 
 
NEWTON:  These protests, sporadic, unpredictable, and yet effective, are taking a damaging toll on this fragile economy and more. This trucker was stuck on the road overnight and his wife fell ill and had to be taken to hospital. 
 
UNKNOWN (through translator):  Personally, I'm against this. The people have made their choice. If they wanted to lock things down, they shouldn't do it to business. People have to work. 
 
NEWTON (on camera):  Even among officials that back Bolsonaro, there is a great reluctance to support any kind of civil disobedience. It's the reason that they have ordered these blockades to end even if police have to use force. They do not believe that these kinds of protests will resolve any of the division in the country. RODRIGO GARCIA, SAO PAULO GOVERNOR (through translator):  It will not
 
 be a demonstration or a riot that will make society not recognize the result of the polls. To the victors, the mandate, to the losers, the acknowledgement of defeat.
 <br>[03:25:00]
 
NEWTON:  After a bruising campaign and a vague signal from Bolsonaro that he will give up power to President-elect Lula da Silva, Brazil seems destined for more political division now playing out on its streets and jeopardizing an already tense transfer of power. 
 
Paula Newton, CNN, Sao Paulo, Brazil.

COREN:  The leaders of Venezuela and Colombia have welcomed the return of a leftist government in Brazil, and they're also mending their own strained ties. Colombian President, Gustavo Petro was welcomed by his Venezuelan counterpart, Nicolas Maduro in Caracas on Tuesday. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GUSTAVO PETRO, COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  After many years, the press says six a Colombian and a Venezuelan president meet and talk. Now we want to invite Chile, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Peru to accept the reintegration of Venezuela as a member of the ending community with all its powers, rights, and duties. We have also solicited, we will discuss it later, for Venezuela to integrate the inter-American system of human rights.
 
NICOLAS MADURO. PRESIDENT OF VENEZUELA (through translator):  To continue to strengthen diplomatic and consular relations, the fair treatment of migrants between Venezuela and Colombia. It has been a fruitful first meeting. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COREN:  Well talks between the two leaders come despite the Maduro government's international pariah status. It's widely accused including by a U.N. -- sorry, a U.N. report of being a major human rights violator. But the two sides have been taking steps to repair diplomacy since August. 
 
They both appointed ambassadors for their respective countries. Then they restored border trade, which had been closed for years. In addition to regional cooperation, the meeting focused on key issues like human rights, peace talks with Colombia's largest leftist guerrilla group and the environment and Amazon Rainforest.
 
Well, South Korean officials say a special police unit probing what went wrong in the Seoul crowd crush tragedy, have raised the Yongsan police station and seven other officers across the capital. Well, they say police took documents about the emergency call reports and internal police report documents. Now this comes as grieving families are now tasked with collecting the belongings of their loved ones from a gym after more than 150 people were killed in a massive crowd surge during a Halloween celebration in Seoul.
 
CNN's Ivan Watson spoke with survivors and friends of some of those killed. He filed this exclusive report.

IAN CHANG, FRIEND OF VICTIM STEVEN BLESI:  Everybody was very fond of Steven. Steven was the kindest person there ever was. He will be there for you. He was a, like a good friend for everybody, a kind soul. 
 
IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Ian Chang, a 21- year-old from Florida is talking about his friend Steven Blesi. 
 
CHANG:  That's me and Steven.
 
WATSON:  The two American university students met here in South Korea during their semester abroad in Seoul.
 
CHANG:  Like this was like one of his big adventures to come here by himself. 
 
UNKNOWN:  Show me some cooking skills. 
 
WATSON:  The young Americans mixed classwork with exploring Korea. 
 
CHANG:  He definitely like the fruit here for sure. 
 
WATSON:  The barbecue. 
 
CHANG:  Yes, Korean barbecue.
 
WATSON:  And that included late nights out in Seoul's bars and nightclubs.
 
That is until Saturday night when everything went horribly wrong. 
 
CHANG:  I didn't thought it was real, you know, the whole thing because I saw him that day. Right. And just learning the news that he passed away. He just, you know, doesn't seem to be true. 
 
WATSON:  The two Americans planned to meet here in Seoul's Itaewon district to celebrate Halloween. But that night, Korean authorities estimate more than 100,000 other people were also coming to party here.
 
UNKNOWN:  At the beginning we thought it was funny.
 
WATSON:  Stuck in the crowd, Anne-Lou Chevalier, 22-year-old French exchange student filmed herself with friends at first laughing, but then she suddenly looks distressed. 
 
You were hurt. What happened to you? ANNE-LOU CHEVALIER, SURVIVOR OF CROWD CRUSH:  At some point I had no
 
 air and I -- we were so crushed to other people that I couldn't breathe at all. So, I just pass, passed out. 
 
WATSON:  Unconscious. 
 
CHEVALIER:  Yes. Unconscious.
 
WATSON:  Bystanders pulled Chavalier limp out of the crowd. She was one of the lucky ones. 
 
This narrow alley was ground zero on Saturday night. Hundreds of partygoers collapsed into a deadly pile up here and began suffocating under the weight of the crowd. 
 <br>[03:29:59]
 
At least 156 people. South Korea is still processing this staggering loss. 
 
Days later, lost belongings on display for grieving relatives to identify. 
 
IAN CHANG, FRIEND OF VICTIM STEVEN BLESI:  So, I message Steven to tell him like, hey, don't come to our place anymore.
 
WATSON:  On Saturday night, Ian Chang got to the crowded neighborhood first and warned his friends not to come, but the Atlanta native who loved hip hop and international travel, never answer.
 
The next day, authorities identified Blesi and Anne Giske (Ph), another American student from the same exchange program as two of the many victims. Just weeks ago, this group of friends went on a weekend hiking trip together. 
 
CHANG:  She was such a great person, like a great friend.
 
WATSON:  Steven and Ian shared plans for the future, hopes and dreams that will now never be fulfilled.
 
CHANG:  I wish I could have made more memories with him, you know. Just, I'm going to miss him.

COREN:  Well, the Indian state of Gujarat is holding a day of mourning for 135 people killed in Sunday's bridge collapse. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the site of the accident and spoke with survivors in the hospital. Mr. Modi pledged compensation from the government, but families want someone to be held accountable for the tragedy.
 
Police have made at least nine arrests so far in their investigation. They say all suspects are connected to a company that did make maintenance work on the bridge. 
 
Still to come on CNN, how Iranian demonstrators are responding after the government threatens public trials for protestors.

COREN:  We're learning disturbing new details about the man charged with viciously attacking House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband Paul. San Francisco's district attorney tells CNN David DePape intended to target other public officials. And Pelosi's home was the first stop on that mission.
 
The case is still very fresh, so the D.A. is not able to share specific details of who that DePape was trying to target. Well, meantime, the 42-year-old suspect was in court Tuesday for his initial appearance. He's charged with a litany of crimes including attempted murder. 
 <br>[03:35:00]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
WILLIAM SCOTT, CHIEF, SAN FRANCISCO POLICE DEPARTMENT:  What is Crystal clear to me is he tried to kill Mr. Pelosi. Now what was going on in his mind as to why he did that? I can't speak to that, but what I -- what is very clear to me from viewing that body-worn camera is he tried to kill Mr. Pelosi. 
 
BROOKE JENKINS, SAN FRANCISCO DISTRICT ATTORNEY:  I think we've seen just like on January 6th that this insightful commentary that goes on, what has become, I think accepting behavior of people encouraging violence, encouraging people to take these extreme standpoints and viewpoints is certainly laying a pathway to this type of conduct.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COREN:  In court Tuesday DePape waived his right to a hearing within 10 days and he's behind bars until his next court appearance on November 4th. He faces charges that could lead up to life in prison if convicted.
 
In Iran, state media report public trials are being held for about a thousand alleged anti-government protesters, but if that was meant to end demonstrations, it certainly has not worked.
 
This was Tehran on Tuesday where a protest took place on a university campus in support of jailed students. CNN obtained this video from the pro-reform activist outlet IranWire. The nationwide protests now in their seventh week are the ruling theocracies biggest internal challenge in years despite a brutal crackdown to stop them.
 
Well, for more on this, let's bring in CNN's Jomana Karadsheh who is following developments. Jomana, these protestors will not be deterred despite these mass public trials, all the regime's brutal crackdown.
 
JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Anna, this is really what has been so remarkable about these protests. The theme has really been this defiance and determination by the protesters that we have seen now for nearly seven weeks. I mean, the government has tried all the tactics that it's used in the past to crush protests, and that doesn't seem to be working.
 
We have seen that brutal crackdown on the streets, the beatings, the use of live ammunition according to human rights organization, the arrests of hundreds and hundreds of people across the country, if not thousands. And the horrors that take place behind closed doors at detention facilities according to human rights organizations and protesters who we have spoken to.
 
And then you have that real severe warning. Probably the most severe warning we have had to date. Coming from the hand of the feared and powerful revolutionary guard corps over the weekend, telling protesters that Saturday was their last day of protest, that they shouldn't come back out onto the streets.
 
And many people took that to mean that a harsher and possibly bloodier crackdown might be coming. And the response from the streets, the response from these protestors has been more protests. We have seen university students taking -- staging protests on university campuses across the country over the past couple of days.
 
And also, you know, this is also happening as these trials, Anna, are taking place. They began over the weekend, public, trials and revolutionary courts according to Iranian state media. And we expect that many of those on trial will be possibly facing the death penalty when you look at the charges that be -- are being brought against them in court.
 
All of that doesn't seem to be deterring these protestors as we enter the seventh week of protests right now, the government is really struggling to contain what has become a national uprising calling for regime change, Anna.
 
COREN:  They are facing the death penalty for protesting. Absolutely horrifying. Jomana Karadsheh joining us from Istanbul, many thanks for the update.
 
Well, Iran may be doing more than selling just weapons to Russia with both the U.S. and Saudi Arabia increasingly concerned that Tehran is planning an attack on energy infrastructure in Saudi and across the Middle East. 
 
A source says officials in Washington and Riyadh have been sharing intelligence that indicates an attack is imminent. A second source says American fighter jets are in Saudi Arabia and prepared to counter any threats. The U.S. believes Iran may be trying to focus attention on Saudi Arabia, which Iran accuses of helping fuel its nationwide protests. 
 
Well, meanwhile, the attack on an immigration center in Dover, England by a man throwing incendiary devices is reviving scrutiny of the United Kingdom's home secretary, the official responsible for immigration and border security. 
 
Suella Braverman recently caused an uproar by describing the recent surge of asylum seekers an invasion.
 
Bianca Nobilo has the story.

BIANCA NOBILO, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT:  A man throws incendiary devices at a U.K. immigration center in the Southern English port of Dover, Kent before killing himself. A day later, dozens of charities called for urgent action over overcrowding and inhumane conditions at the Manston Center where some 700 migrants were moved after the arson attack. 
 
In an open letter to U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, all this amid a highly charged political debate in the U.K. over immigration fueled in part by comments made by newly reappointed home secretary Suella Braverman.
 
SUELLA BRAVERMAN, BRITISH HOME SECRETARY:  The British people deserve to know which party is serious about stopping the invasion on our southern post, and which party is not. So, let's stop pretending that they are all refugees in distress. The whole country knows that that is not true. 
 
NOBILO:  Charities have asked her to create safe routes for refugees who are mainly from Albania, Afghanistan, and Iran to travel to Britain. But Braverman known for her anti-immigration views has defended her policies, including the controversial plan to deport some migrants to Rwanda. 
 
BRAVERMAN:  We have seen an unprecedented number of attempts to illegally cross a channel in small boats. Not only is it unnecessary because many have come from another safe country, it is lethally dangerous. We must stop it. 
 
NOBILO:  Braverman is seeing growing pressure to explain her actions as she's also admitted sending government documents from her personal e-mail in a breach of security rules and the ministerial code, which led to her resignation under former Prime Minister Liz Truss before she was reappointed by current Prime Minister Sunak.
 
As the number of illegal crossings through the English Channel approaches an unprecedented 40,000 this year. Charities are calling for an urgent solution as several diseases have reportedly already been detected at Manston. 
 
CHARLIE ZOSSEDER, DIRECTOR, SAMPHIRE CHARITY:  It's just not suitable accommodation. They've only just had a doctor go in there, and that's after four cases of diphtheria. And those are just the ones that are actually reported. We also know that there was someone in there with MRSA who has been since moved. There's scabies. 
 
My message to the government would be they need to have some compassion and they need to get their act together. 
 
NOBILO:  A call for help as thousands remain in limbo with their future unknown.

COREN:  Well, dozens are missing after two boats carrying migrants capsized off the coast of Greece. This was the view from a Greek coast guard ship as it searched for survivors. Some have been rescued. One of the migrant boats was carrying more than 60 people when it capsized on Tuesday and other capsized on Monday with more than a dozen people on board.
 
Greece has been on the front line of Europe's migration crisis with refugees fleeing war and poverty across parts of the Middle East. 
 
Still to come on CNN, there are reports of bird flu outbreaks in the United States, Mexico, and Europe. Find out what measures health officials are taking against this highly contagious virus and what the risks are for humans.
 <br>[03:45:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
COREN:  Welcome back. Well, U.K. health officials have ordered that all poultry and pet birds across England are to be kept indoors beginning Monday. The decision comes as the United Kingdom is battling the worst bird flu outbreak in its history.
 
There have been 85 confirmed cases of the H5N1 bird flu strain in England since the beginning of October, and 219 cases of H5N1 in England since the start of the outbreak a year.
 
Meanwhile, in the United States, avian influenza was first detected in February, and poultry outbreaks have been reported in 43 states. There has been only one human case in the entire country. More bird flu cases have also been reported in Mexico, as well as in several European countries. 
 
Well, Dr. Scott Miscovich is the president and CEO of Premier Medical Group USA. He joins us now from Kalua, Hawaii. 
 
Doctor, great to see you and have you with us. 
 
Tell us about bird flu and what risks it poses to humans. 
 
SCOTT MISCOVICH, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, PREMIER MEDICAL GROUP USA:  Well, bird flu and is an influenza A, and that's the family that it's in. Interestingly, as everyone knows right now, we're also in the middle of flu season in the Northern Hemisphere, which also happens to be in the family of influenza A.
 
So, in general, it's a flu. Now is it a risk to humans? Fortunately, as you've just mentioned, there has been one case very early on in the United States, one I think in a duck keeper in the U.K. back around January, and they all did fine. So, it's a very, very low risk to humans right now from where it stands. 
 
And you know, the people that are -- that are concerned should be people working in the poultry industry. But nowadays, since we have people that are, you know, keeping their own chickens and their own birds in their home across the world for eggs and for other reasons. You know, that's the simple risk that we have that it could be there now. 
 
How would you know if you had bird flu? Well, unfortunately, you're going to have to get tested because basically it presents just like the flu, you know, with the cough and sore throat and the achiness, et cetera.
 
And guess what? Also, presents like that, of course it's COVID. So, it's a challenge -- it's a challenging thing when it comes to a diagnosis. And fortunately, it is treatable at this stage with the simple same medicines we use for flu like Tamiflu. So, it's a very low risk. It's, you know, prevention is the droppings and that, you know, don't touch a dead bird or that type of thing.
 
But it's mostly through droppings and then through oral with maybe some aerosol inhalation around those droppings. But it is very preventable, very low risk right now. 
 
COREN:  Well, let's now turn to COVID. The director of the CDC, Dr. Rochelle Walensky raised concern about protecting ourselves from the newest Omicron subvariants. What can you tell us about these variants? 
 
MISCOVICH:  Well, these variants have been from the Omicron variants. They are -- their basic starts have been from the BA.4 and BA.5. That's probably the good news, Anna. And yet we now have the BQ. 1.1 even developing, and they're all kind of taking that route that we've watched the COVID take, which is it finds a way to escape the immunity that we are presenting, and that's what she discussed today. 
 
And what does concern us is that they show more what we call immune escape from our vaccinations. And you know, we're seeing about eight of those spike proteins that are changing now in the most advanced variants, which makes it challenging. 
 
And the big problem that she brought up also today is like, for example, a medicine called Evusheld that we have been prescribing to our like long-term chemotherapy and immunosuppress people where they can get a shot and then have a good three to six month shield around them of protection. It's breaking through that. Also, some of those monoclonal antibodies that you could go in and get via IV or injection. It's also not responding to those. 
 <br>[03:49:57] But there is still Paxlovid. That's the pill that allows us to give it to a patient when they at first have signs of COVID. So, her warning today was, please, don't, you know, don't stay at home if you are at risk, seek out treatment because we still have the pills that are very effective. And we are coming up Anna, right now to a cold and flu season. That will include another spread in peak of COVID. No doubt about it. 
 
COREN:  And finally, doctor, there was obviously this urgency for us all to get vaccinated, but what about boosters? Because I'm sure there has been a drop off and does that apply to children as well? 
 
MISCOVICH:  Wow. I can tell you, my organization across the country still is very active doing boosters and it has been so sluggish, the uptake of, boosters. And we know this, we've read this and it's been in the news across the country. And that's a shame because we are seeing. You know that waning immunity. 
 
And the good news out of the new Bivalent booster is there's a really nice antibody surge that will really give you that four month or so, really strong protection.
 
And I would recommend it to everyone because look at where we are right now. We just started November. We're really looking that the holiday get togethers are really, probably going to happen. I don't think there's any chance that that will not occur, and that's when this spread will occur. 
 
And so, if you would be going and seeking your booster right now, you're going to have a nice protection when you get with loved ones over the holiday, and I would highly advise it to give us that window in through that, you know, hopefully February, March, April window when this should all then be dropping off.
 
COREN:  We all need to be listening to doctor's orders. Dr. Scott Miscovich, great to speak to you as always. Many thanks.
 
MISCOVICH:  Thanks, Anna. 
 
COREN:  Well, China has imposed a week-long lockdown in parts of Zhengzhou, including a major factory for iPhone supplier Foxconn. This is anxious workers reportedly fled the facility on foot in recent days.
 
CNN cannot independently verify if or how many COVID cases have been found at the Foxconn plant. 
 
Well, for more I'm joined by Steven Jiang at CNN's Beijing bureau. Steven, what can you tell us about these workers who have apparently escaped?
 
STEVEN JIANG, CNN BEIJING BUREAU CHIEF:  Well, Anna, you know, you've seen these, viral videos showing hundreds of them hauling luggage, you know, trying to escape their factories. And sometimes you see sympathetic local residents leaving out food and drinks along the way, basically for them to take to feed and hydrate themselves throughout their arduous journey homes.
 
And they are fleeing because of not only because of the cases on the factory ground, but also because of the lack of information and growing uncertainty. That is really part of the problem because we have not heard much from the company, as well as local authorities until very late. At first, they didn't even acknowledge the situation existed.
 
But now of course, that weeklong lockdown you just mentioned. That is actually an extension of the already -- of the just ended citywide lockdown. So, in a way, the authorities seem to be a cutting off this escape route for these workers. And all of this scene of chaos and misery is really a poignant reminder of the tolls, economic social tolls. 
 
China's zero COVID policy has been taking on its population affecting really millions of people. Now, Foxconn is attracting a lot of attention because this factory employs more than 200,000 workers, and they make as much as 85 percent of the entire world's iPhones. So that is getting attention, especially ahead of the holiday season. 
 
But this is not a single case. We are seeing this kind of scenes being replicated across the country, especially after the conclusion of that Communist Party Congress. We see a people in the northwest part, of course, you know, a very remote part, pleading desperately for food, lockdown residents there. 
 
And in Lhasa in Tibet, people even taking to the streets to protest a two and a half -- a two and a half month long lockdown. In one instance, we see a young father basically, being taken into police custody after he tried to drive his car through a police barrier, trying to buy formula for his baby. 
 
So, all of these things is, again, showing you the growing frustration and even resentment towards the policy. But one thing for sure, Anna, as this policy is not going away, because as the top leader Xi Jinping himself said, it is a correct and effective and sustainable policy. And I think from the local official's perspective, they are only seeing -- they aren't seeing no benefits of, you know, not doing it. They would rather air on the side of overreacting and over enforcing, at least for the foreseeable future. Anna?
 <br>[03:54:59]
 
COREN:  Zero COVID here to stay on the mainland. Steven Jiang joining us from Beijing. Good to see you. Thank you.
