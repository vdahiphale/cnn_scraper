BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN ANCHOR: Buenos dias. Welcome to your weekend and to CNN "This Morning", I'm Boris Sanchez.
 
AMARA WALKER, CNN ANCHOR: Hi Boris. I'm Amara Walker.
 
A string of powerful tornadoes, ripping through three states and leaving at least one person dead 10 others injured. A search is underway now for the missing and more than 100,000 people without power.
 
SANCHEZ; Plus, the final push and the final pitch just three days before Election Day, candidates are sprinting to the finish line. We're going to have the latest for you from the campaign trail.
 
A. WALKER: And it is said to be the largest lottery prize in history. Now, $1.6 billion is up for grabs and tonight's Powerball drawing.
 
It is Saturday, everyone thank you so much for waking up with us. Good morning, Boris and thanks to our producers for that reminder that the Powerball dry is coming up. I got to get my lottery tickets. Are you playing?
 
SANCHEZ: I am now yes, thanks for the reminder.
 
A. WALKER: Exactly.
 
SANCHEZ: I appreciate that, yes.
 
We begin this morning with the final sprint to the midterm elections. The candidates and their surrogates are making a final push just three days to go before Election Day. A. WALKER: Yes, and the battle for control of the Senate. It comes down to a handful of key states including Pennsylvania. President Biden, Barack Obama, Donald Trump all campaigning in the state today. The President is keeping his focus on democracy, also, the economy. Republicans heading into Tuesday's elections, though with a slight edge.
 
SANCHEZ: But millions of voters have already cast their ballots. Early voting is up compared to the last midterm elections of 2018. Almost 35 million people in 47 states have voted early.
 
Let's bring in CNN politics reporter Jasmine Wright. She joins us now live and national politics reporter Eva McKend.
 
Jasmine, let's start with you. President Biden set the campaign making his final appeal to voters. What's his message?
 
JASMINE WRIGHT, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: Well, the President has been talking about what's at stake this election he will wake up this morning in Chicago, where on his last-minute swing across the country. He will be giving remarks on the suburbs talking about how to lower prescription drug prices, Social Security and Medicare. 
 
Then we'll see him back on the east coast this afternoon in Pennsylvania, where he and former President Obama will host a high- profile rally supporting John Fetterman. Of course, John Fetterman in Pennsylvania is in one of those very tight races that could determine whether or not Democrats retain control over the Senate.
 
So, this is a big deal for the President. Now as Democrats have become more anxious, as the days get closer to Tuesday on how they will fare on that day, the President says to reporters that he is not yet ready to concede really adopting this optimist and chief role here when he was talking in California.
 
Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES: I know you always asked me, how are we doing? We're going to win this time around. I think I feel really good about our chances. I haven't been in all the House races. But I think we're going to keep the Senate pick up a seat. I think we have a chance to win in the House. I don't think we're going to not win, keeping the house. So, I'm optimistic. I really am.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WRIGHT: Now, those comments come from the President optimistic, but they come as Republicans seem to be gaining momentum in these last final days -- last night. At a fundraiser in Chicago, the President really put a nod to that appearance of momentum saying that it would be the worst two years if Republicans took control of the House and the Senate. 
 
So, Biden has been trying to blunt that momentum really using a two- pronged message here in the final days. First, he has been delivering stark warnings to Americans that democracy is under assault when it comes to election deniers that are on the ballot come Tuesday. And of course, he has been trying to reframe the election as a choice between the two parties instead of a referendum on Democrats who currently hold control of Congress.
 
So, I expect that we will hear that message from the President basically trying to make the case that yes, the economy net may not be the best under us right now. But it would be worse under Republicans for his events later on today.
 
Boris, Amara.
 
A. WALKER: Yes. And of course, control the Senate could come down to a critical Senate race in Georgia that is our Eva McKend is. What's the latest when it comes to this contest between Raphael Warnock and Herschel Walker.
 
EVA MCKEND, CNN NATIONAL REPORTER: Well, good morning. It is game day here at the University of Georgia. Republican Senate candidate Herschel Walker will rally with his supporters later this morning. Of course, this is a homecoming of him of sorts. 
 
He's from Wrightsville, Georgia, but it is here in Athens where his football career got started. Meanwhile, Democratic incumbent senator Raphael Warnock, holding several stops on his bus tour. He'll be in his hometown of Savannah tomorrow.
 
When it comes to these two candidates. They can't rarely get any more different. Walker has worked endlessly to try to tie Warnock to President Biden blaming them both for the state of the economy while Warnock has argued that Walker is just unfit to serve in the United States Senate.
 <br>[08:05:14]
 
We're also monitoring the governor's race here, not getting as much as attention as the Senate contests, kind of getting crowded out by the Senate race. But key as well, a key rematch between Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams, and incumbent Republican Governor Brian Kemp. 
 
Kemp has argued that he should be reelected another four years for how he has led the state through inflation, how he has led on the economy. Meanwhile, Stacey Abrams argues that the policies that Kemp has championed are just too dangerous for Georgians. I caught up with her on her campaign bus this week.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
STACEY ABRAMS (D-GA) GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: The reality is our lives are at stake. Women are losing more and more of their rights. And this governor has said he intends to pursue even further legislation that comes to his desk. He's willing to sign legislation to deny access to contraception. This is a governor who has weakened the gun laws in the state of Georgia and he wants to do more.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MCKEND: So, Georgia often referred to as the center of the political universe, and maybe you can understand why two key races to watch here.
 
Amara, Boris.
 
SANCHEZ: Eva McKend reporting from Georgia. Thanks to Jasmine Wright as well.
 
Let's dig deeper now on that pivotal Senate race happening in the all- important battleground state of Georgia. Here to discuss is Patricia Murphy. She's a political reporter at the Atlanta Journal Constitution.
 
Patricia, great to share a weekend morning with you. Polls are showing that Georgia Senate race is going to be a nail biter. But Herschel Walker says he does not believe it's going to go to a runoff listen to this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HERSCHEL WALKER (R-GA) SENATE CANDIDATE: The gap has been closed. So, I'm not sure what polls you're looking at. But what I continue to tell my team is we go like way down. And that's what we've been doing the momentum has been swinging this way.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SANCHEZ: Do you see either candidate in that race avoiding a runoff?
 
PATRICIA MURPHY, POLITICAL REPORTER, THE ATLANTA JOURNAL CONSTITUTION: Well, we as you said, we have a state law here in Georgia that any candidate has to get at least 50% plus one vote in order to avoid a December 6 runoff. But here in the state, especially in that Senate race, we have two dynamics happening, about 5% of voters are still undecided in that Senate race. 
 
And there's also a libertarian Chase Oliver, who is also pulling down about 5%. And it's that crucial 5% to the libertarian that looks like it is keeping both Raphael Warnock and Herschel Walker under 50% right now. Neither one of those two has ever pulled close to 50%. They've always been in about 46, 47, 48.
 
One hope from Republicans is that Governor Brian Kemp, who is pulling ahead of 50%, up at 51, 52%. Republicans are hoping that Governor Brian Kemp can have such a big day on election day that he could kind of drag Herschel Walker across the finish line Kemp is more popular than Herschel Walker right now. 
 
But if he can get enough Republicans out to the polls, on his own, the Herschel Walker campaign is hoping that would be enough for Herschel Walker to also be able to avoid a runoff. But that would be a tall order, looking at where the polls are right now.
 
SANCHEZ: So interesting that in even in these divided times, there are still undecided voters out there. Hard to imagine. If this does go to a runoff. Patricia, how do you anticipate this might change the dynamic of the race come early December? Does it change all that much?
 
MURPHY: I think it could really change depending on what happens with control of the U.S. Senate. If again, as we had in 2021. If control of the Senate comes down to this single Senate seat in Georgia, first of all, that will just flood the state with outside money. 
 
It will totally nationalize that race, it will mean that this is less of a choice between Raphael Warnock and Herschel Walker, and more of a choice between Joe Biden's administration and something that could put the brakes on that administration or help him keep doing what he's doing. And that will be really a referendum on the Biden administration.
 
If, however, either Democrats have clear control of the Senate or Republicans have controlled the Senate, it comes back to a more personal choice between these two gentlemen. Herschel Walker especially, I think would benefit from Republicans not having control of the Senate being able to totally nationalize this race. 
 
We are hearing from some Republicans who right now are choosing between these two gentlemen and its control of the Senate that really is weighing on their minds. They are concerned about Herschel Walker, the accusations against him and his fitness for Office.
 
However, to them, it's more important to have control of the Senate and that's why they're voting for him. If that's off the table. That doesn't help Herschel Walker in a runoff. It would help Raphael Warnock but we'll have to see exactly what happens on election day before we get there.
 
SANCHEZ: Yes, turning to the governor's race, their democratic nominee Stacey Abrams says that there was voter suppression still happening in Georgia. CNN's Eva McKend pressed her on that claim and here was her response.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[08:10:03]
 
ABRAMS: Voter suppression makes very little sense to those who've never faced it. When you've had your right to vote challenged, when you've been told that you are an adequate as a citizen, then you understand what voter suppression is. But for those for whom is always been easy, they will not necessarily have a visceral understanding.
 
(END VIDEO CLIPS)
 
SANCHEZ: Now, Patricia, critics have pointed to Georgia breaking records for early voting during a midterm election as a way of undercutting Abrams claims about suppression. What do you make of that back and forth?
 
MURPHY: So, this is the same debate we've been having in Georgia for decades and decades, it's so important to think about the history of Georgia, the history of voter suppression here in the state, which has been very real dangerous and deadly for black Georgians for as long as many of them can remember. So that's that that's the history up around this conversation. 
 
Now, as for whether it's easier or harder to vote here in Georgia, it is harder to vote by mail. Although in-person early voting has really skyrocketed. A lot of that is because it's very hard to vote by mail compared to the way it was before. Deadlines have been moved up. The timeframe has been shortened, drop boxes have been moved inside from outside.
 
So, all of that has made it harder to vote by mail. But in many ways, it's easier to vote in-person the state has added required Saturday voting in every county in Georgia, that was not the case. It's extended the mandatory times for early voting and so they made it easier to vote in-person herder by mail.
 
And so, it really does come down to really what's in the eye of the beholder. And because the Abrams campaign has not been able to bring forward individual voters to say I tried to vote and I couldn't. That makes it harder for them to sort of prove that negative you can't find people who aren't voting that's hard to do. 
 
But with the history of this state, and the precursor to the new election law here in the state, which was Donald Trump's false claims of election fraud, that is what has really contributed to this cocktail of a lot of confusion around this election law, and whether it's harder or easier to vote here on the state.
 
SANCHEZ: And quickly Patricia, zooming out outside of Georgia, what other races nationally? Are you going to be watching closely on Tuesday night?
 
MURPHY: We are absolutely watching that Senate race in Pennsylvania and we're watching that Senate race in Arizona. Those are the other two races around the country that have been back and forth, neck and neck in the last couple of weeks. And I think if the Republicans have a really good night in Arizona and Pennsylvania, Georgia Democrats feel like they're not going to have a good night. 
 
Republicans feel like it'll be a great night for them as well. If Republicans can harness thing national headwinds that are moving those races in Pennsylvania and Arizona, they feel like that this is their Senate race to win.
 
SANCHEZ: Patricia Murphy, appreciate your reporting. Thank you so much.
 
MURPHY: Thank you so much.
 
SANCHEZ: Of course.
 
So, this morning, looking at some severe weather across the country, the central United States, several states are picking up the pieces after tornadoes ripped across Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas yesterday, at least 18 tornadoes reported since Friday night. Dozens of homes destroyed after the storms with power lines down across the region, affecting thousands.
 
A. WALKER: Officials in Lamar County Texas have declared a disaster after a tornado caused significant damage to homes and a lot of structures there. And just north and McCurtain County, Oklahoma authorities are still searching for several missing people after the storm left one person -- at least one person dead.
 
Let's go now to meteorologist Chad Myers in the CNN Weather Center for more on this. A bit off season, right Chad?
 
CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST: It is except there's a small fall season that we don't really get to talk about because sometimes it never even exists. We know about spring when the warm air is trying to push back winter. But now we have winter trying to push back summer. So that's the that's the clash of the two air masses. And when they get together, you get this. 
 
Now every red square that you see here, that's a tornado warning that was issued yesterday, every symbol with a tornado those are the 18 that actually did touchdown. Weather Service will be out later on today, seeing how big they were, seeing if there was more, if they skipped along, all of those things still to be determined. Sometimes that can take days.
 
Now there was hail all the way to Madison, Wisconsin yesterday. So, from Lake Michigan all the way down to the Gulf Coast, that's how big this system was. And for the (INAUDIBLE) it still is although the tornado threat is gone. It's a wind and lightning threat now for today. 
 
The wind across parts of the Great Lakes could be gusting to 60 miles per hour here that could bring down some power lines and take out your power. The threat of severe weather though in a small area across the south. This is a level one threat out of five. Yesterday we were level four out of five. So significantly less severe weather.
 <br>[08:15:00]
 
I move you ahead to hear to halftime at some of these college football games, there will be thunderstorms there will be lightning and you may have to take cover if you're outside
 
A. WALKER: Very good advice. Make sure you pay attention to your weather alerts. Chad Myers, thank you.
 
MYERS: Your welcome.
 
SANCHEZ: Still become a stronger than expected jobs report for October, but find out why it may not be enough yet to help cool inflation.
 
A. WALKER: Plus, Vladimir Putin telling civilians to evacuate in preparation for an attempt by Ukraine to take back a key city.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) SANCHEZ: U.S. stocks ended the week in positive territory as investors cheered the last jobs report before the midterms. The U.S. economy added 261,000 jobs in October but unemployment ticked up to 3.7% as wage growth began to cool off.
 
A. WALKER: That jobs number is lower than the previous month, but still it's a little higher than expected and it could be a sign that inflation is peaking. And it might give the Federal Reserve enough reason to start slowing its pace of interest rate hikes.
 <br>[08:20:09]
 
CNN's Alison Hosik has the latest on the U.S. labor market.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ALISON HOSIK, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on-camera): Good morning, Amira and Boris.
 
It was a mixed bag for the October jobs report with a bigger rise than expected in job additions for the month. And in the unemployment rate as well. U.S. employers added 261,000 jobs more than the 200,000 jobs economists had predicted. And the unemployment rate it ticked up to 3.7%. But it's still low by historical standards. We saw the most job gains in healthcare, manufacturing, and professional and technical services, which includes positions in architecture, engineering, and advertising.
 
The trend of job creation is beginning to slow but there is still underlying strength in the labor market, which remains resilient. Despite growing fears by many economists about a possible recession and efforts by the Federal Reserve to tamp down the pace of economic growth as a way of fighting stubborn inflation.
 
Fed Reserve Chair Jay Powell has warned that the economy may need to shed jobs in order to bring price pressures under control. But so far, the Feds a string of large interest rate hikes hasn't stopped employers from looking for more help. Wages a key metric the Fed is also focusing on that also continued to climb in October, though at a slower pays higher wages can create inflationary pressure, because with Americans earning more money that could drive up demand for goods and services.
 
The continued strength in the labor market could leave the door open for the Fed to continue to hike rates at its upcoming meetings. But there is concern that the Feds aggressive rate hiking strategy could trigger a recession that may not be easy to bounce back from.
 
Amara, Boris.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
A. WALKER: Alison, thank you. So here to discuss what these latest jobs report means for the U.S. economy is Heidi Shierholz. She is the president of the Economic Policy Institute. And she's also the former chief economist of the Department of Labor under the Obama administration.
 
Good morning to you, Heidi. Looks some are calling this a mixed bag with employers still hiring but also unemployment rising. The Biden administration said it was looking for just the right mix in this report. It seems like that's what they got, right?
 
HEIDI SHIERHOLZ, PRESIDENT, THE ECONOMIC POLICY INSTITUTE: Yes, I would characterize this report as it's a labor market that is slowing, but still very, very strong. The 261,000 jobs we added that is a really solid job growth number. But it's way down. Like in the first quarter of this year, we added over 500,000 jobs a month, on average. So, it's that encapsulates it slowing, but still very strong.
 
A. WALKER: You know, I feel like we've been talking about the big R word for months and months, right. And everyone asked me, well, when is this recession going to happen? Is it really going to happen? And it looks like so many corporations and employers are really tightening their belts, you know, heading into the new year. 
 
And, you know, I was Googling recession, what are the signs? And I read that it's, you'll see sustained job losses and a spike in unemployment. That's not what we're seeing right now. So how likely is the recession?
 
SHIERHOLZ: That is the $60,000 question we are, there's no doubt we are not in a recession right now. And there, it is not possible to tell at this point, whether the Feds actions are going to do what we want, which is bring down job openings without causing an increase in unemployment. 
 
Or if it's, you know, if they've already perhaps even baked in a recession in coming months. It's a really what the Feds doing. It's a really blunt tool, and it takes a while for the impact to really reach the broader economy.
 
So, it's an unknown. I -- what I do think is know is that what the Fed has done so far, has really secured a major decline in recession -- in inflation in coming months. I think it really points to, you know, by the measures that we're seeing in this jobs report that came out yesterday, their work to reduce inflation is largely done and just holding now to try to avoid as much as possible triggering a recession, I think, is really the important thing.
 
A. WALKER: Yes, look there's you know, so many theories or so many numbers and percentages to look at. But you know, at the end of the day, people at home, are thinking, OK, well, if a recession does come at some point, and there are you know, I'm laid off or if someone is laid off, what will the job market look like, you know, in the coming months? 
 
And you talked with our producer about this really big discrepancy that you've been seeing in the public versus private sector. Talk about that and you know, where people should I guess be putting the energy in terms of finding a new job if they have to?
 <br>[08:25:05] SHIERHOLZ: No, yes that's -- there's a couple of strange there that, what we're seeing now in this recovery, we're still in a very strong recovery is that private sector jobs, not in every industry, but overall private sector jobs have really come just roaring back unbelievably quickly. And public sector jobs, state and local governments, they have not. And that's a real problem, like we're seeing teacher shortages, when you hear all about the kinds of trouble that state and local governments are having hiring that points to usually need to raise wages in order to attract and retain the workers that they need.
 
So, there's a -- we have a big gap in state and local government jobs. And like there's almost 300,000 jobs, fewer people in K through 12 education than there were pre-COVID.
 
A. WALKER: Wow.
 
SHIERHOLZ: This is going to have long term effects. If this doesn't get -- if this doesn't get fixed. If state local governments don't raise wages so they can attract and retain your workers that they need. But as far as the recession going forward, when we have a recession, what the Fed is trying to do is slow down demand for goods and services. So, if they do that (INAUDIBLE).
 
A. WALKER: Yes, so that quickly because we do have to get going regarding inflation, because again, everyone wants to know well, when am I going to stop paying these sky-high prices for milk and meat? What are we going to see the impact of the Fed raising these interest rates? Like how soon?
 
SHIERHOLZ: We're already starting to see it, but the inflation it's the causes that we're seeing of inflation are all ameliorating. Gas prices are coming down the supply chain snarls, which have been a big contributor to efficient are ameliorating. The shift in spending from services to goods. 
 
That's all normalizing. So, we are seeing the causes of inflation really abating and we can expect to see inflation coming down in in coming months, but it's not going to be immediate.
 
A. WALKER: Well, at least we're seeing the signs of it. That's a bit of good news this morning, Heidi Shierholz, appreciate you. Thank you so much.
 
SHIERHOLZ: Thank you.
 
A. WALKER: All right, new developments to talk about in Russia's war on Ukraine. A major battle could be brewing as Ukraine tries to regain control of a key city residents being told to evacuate. We're going to have the latest in Kyiv, when we come back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[08:31:40]
 
SANCHEZ: Amnesty International says up to 10 people, including kids have died in anti-government protests across Southeast Iran.
 
In the city, Khash, protesters threw rocks and chanted death to Khamenei, Iran Supreme Leader. Separately an Iranian teachers group says the death toll is actually higher than as many as 16 protesters were killed in the violence.
 
A. WALKER: And another video from Iran stay media shows plumes of smoke rising from the building there. Their news agencies saying rioters shot weapons and set fire at a police kiosk injuring several officers. CNN cannot verify the claim or reports of civilian deaths.
 
Also, in the capital of Tehran and dozens of other cities, supporters of, excuse me, the Iranian regime packed the streets for probe government rallies. Some chanted down with America outside the former U.S. Embassy.
 
The Pentagon says it is sending an additional $400 million in military aid to Ukraine as the war rages on. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says more than 4.5 million Ukrainians are without power after Russian attacks on Ukraine's infrastructure.
 
SANCHEZ: Meantime, military experts are watching the key city of Kherson, where Russian forces may be pulling back from the front lines. Let's take you to Kyiv now and CNN Selma Abdelaziz was there live for us. Selman, we'll get to that battle in Kherson for a moment, but there was significant news this morning because Iran admitted for the first time that they provided drones to Russia.
 
SELMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: A really significant admission there from Iran's foreign minister today who said in a press conference that Iran had provided Russia with drones, but it says that this was months before the conflict. The foreign minister then went on to say that he's in touch with his Ukrainian counterpart, the Ukrainian foreign minister that he's asked Kyiv to provide evidence that these drones are being used here in Ukraine by Russian forces. 
 
And then went on to say that, if indeed, Tehran receives evidence that Russia is using these Iranian made drones to attack here in Ukraine, that Tehran would, quote, be not indifferent on the matter, that's rather vague.
 
But let me give you a little bit of context here. First of all, we do know Iranian made drones are being used by Russian forces here in Ukraine, because the remnants of those drones have been found on the ground after they've hit buildings and other things by Ukrainian forces. So we know that. Iran had for its part so far, denied, denied, denied, but U.S. officials have said that Iran is not only providing drones, it's also providing missiles to Russia, and it's preparing to provide even more.
 
So a very curious statement here. We'll see if Kyiv does provide that evidence to Tehran and what the next steps would be. But the last thing I really want to point out here is there's also consequences for Tehran in this, of course, the United States, other allies, have warned that they would impose further sanctions if Tehran continues to provide weapons to Russia in this fight. SANCHEZ: Selma Abdelaziz reporting live from Kyiv. Thank you so much, Selma.
 
Up next, CNN is hitting the road in Arizona to speak with voters about the midterm elections and some of them say they will not trust the outcome of the election. We'll explain why next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[08:39:43]
 
WALKER: Welcome back, everyone. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband Paul now at home after surgery to repair a skull fracture, that was following that brutal attack in a couple of San Francisco home last week.
 
SANCHEZ: And 42-year-old David DePape is now facing multiple charges including attempted murder, burglary, and assault. He's pled not guilty to all of those charges and also waived his court appearance on Friday.
 <br>[08:40:06]
 
Meantime, the House Speaker is making her first comments on camera about the attack. Watch this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. NANCY PELOSI (D), HOUSE SPEAKER: Thank you, thank you, thank you for your kind words, your prayers and your good wishes for Paul. It's going to be a long haul but he will be well, and it's just so tragic what happened. But nonetheless, we have to be optimistic. He's surrounded by family. So that's a wonderful thing.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SANCHEZ: DePape's status hearing is set for November 28. A preliminary hearing is also set for mid-December.
 
WALKER: Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett has once again denied a request to challenge President Biden's Student Loan Forgiveness Plan. But her brief order will not change the status quo. Several lawsuits remain in play temporarily blocking student debt cancelation. And experts believe that a single challenge brought by six states will likely make it to the High Court because it has the fewest procedural hurdles. That case is currently before the Eighth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
 
SANCHEZ: Misinformation about the voting process has grown rapidly in the last two years. And while confidence in elections has fallen to a new low, there are still many out there who will doubt the results of the midterm election.
 
WALKER: Absolutely. And CNN's Donie O'Sullivan headed to the key swing state of Arizona, where he spoke to Republican voters with concerns about voting. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In the crucial swing state of Arizona, Republican nominees up and down the ballot allege with no substantiated evidence that the 2020 election was stolen. Take for example, Kari Lake, the Republican nominee for governor.
 
KARI LAKE (R), ARIZONA GUBERNATORIAL NOMINEE: Anybody who was involved in that corrupt, shady, shoddy election of 2020, lock them up.
 
O'SULLIVAN (voice-over): CNN spoke to voters at her recent campaign events about their confidence in the upcoming elections.
 
RICHARD SHOTTS, ARIZONA VOTER: It's hard to trust anybody anymore.
 
RODNEY CLUFF, ARIZONA VOTER: If we have honest elections, there's no no question that Kari Lake will win.
 
O'SULLIVAN (voice-over): We asked Maricopa County Board of Supervisors Chairman Bill Gates, who happens to be a Republican to address their concerns.
 
BLAKE MARNELL, KARI LAKE VOLUNTEER: I think I want to ask them about the extent that they can verify that mail ballots that were mailed out or actually filled out by the people they were intended for and returned by them, and not filled out by anybody else.
 
BILL GATES, CHAIR, MARICOPA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS: On the envelope itself, they fill out an affidavit and they sign an affidavit that indicates that it was them. And then if that signature doesn't match the signature that we have in our voter registration records, then we will call them up and try and confirm, did they actually do this?
 
O'SULLIVAN (on-camera): And I think there's some election officials who have gone through FBI type training to look at signatures and to compare them, right?
 
GATES: Yes, absolutely. So many eyeballs are looking at this.
 
SANDY YOUKHANA, KARI LAKE VOLUNTEER: Do we have people who are trustworthy, who have gone through thorough background checks that we can put in securely, knowing that our elections, both sides can have a fair chance at winning fairly?
 
GATES: You know, some of them, it may be their first election, but a lot of them we have a track record, knowing that these people are trustworthy. We have representatives of the Democrat and Republican Party working together. So even if you do have, you know, some sort of rogue actor, there's so many people watching them. We even do have the live stream cameras.
 
There's so many checks and balances in our system that people just aren't aware of, because we've never had to go out and articulate that to people because people have accepted for the most part, the results of elections. CLUFF: We got to get rid of those machines, and go to paper ballots counted by the precinct committeemen.
 
GATES: People vote on paper, but we do use a tabulation machine. And again, we've used those for decades. We know that those machines have been audited over and over again. We've shown time and time again by many experts that our machines are not connected to the internet in any way.
 
And here's the reality, the machines themselves, are do a more accurate job of counting votes than humans do. When the count is over, when the machine count is over, we do a hand count audit to confirm that the machines are operating properly.
 
SHOTTS: Just to be honest, do a job for the state and your party. Don't make it personal.
 
GATES: I agree with him. And so, I am a Republican. But having said that this is a nonpartisan role that we have. The references made to being personal. I think all this has gotten horribly personal. And the personal insults that are hurled back and forth are not good for our Democratic Republic but further than, it's not good for our civilization for our culture, that's why this is so important.

WALKER: Well you may have seen the viral video. A woman is attacked and gored by a wild bison in Texas. Well that woman is talking to CNN about the experience and what she says it was all her fault, next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
WALKER: So a woman hiking in a Texas park shares her story of a bison attack. You know that really big animal with those horns? Yes, the attack was caught on camera.
 
SANCHEZ: Yes. Video of the attack went viral on social media and it's shining a light on the park that's trying to protect the rare breed of bison. CNN's Ed Lavandera has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Walking under the vibrant sky and rustic cliffs of Caprock Canyon State Park, feels like a journey into a Lost Age.
 <br>[08:50:03]
 
In this corner of West Texas, this sprawling land is home to a herd of southern plains bison, a species that centuries ago dominated the landscape. Today, it's a park where the bison and the humans roam.
 
REBECCA CLARK, HIKING ENTHUSIAST: So this is kind of just my memory wall. LAVANDERA (voice-over): Last month, Rebecca Clark visited the park for a week of solo hiking.
 
CLARK: That's actually him.
 
LAVANDERA (voice-over): She didn't think the experience would end up immortalized on this wall.
 
CLARK: I want to remember that time and all the things that happen.
 
LAVANDERA (voice-over): It's a story she's lucky to tell.
 
CLARK: Come on, keep going. I just want to get back, OK?
 
LAVANDERA (voice-over): Clark recorded on her phone as she crossed paths with bison roaming past a trail, much closer than the 50-yard minimum distance recommended.
 
(on-camera): At what point did you realize you were in trouble?
 
CLARK: Well, I think it's when I use profanity in my video.
 
Thank you. I appreciate it.
 
When I saw him turn, it's like instantly I knew he was going to come after me.
 
Oh my God! Help!.
 
LAVANDERA (voice-over): The Bison gored Clark in the back.
 
CLARK: It was so fast. He hit me in the back, ran to me hooked me and then flipped me, face forward into the mesquite bush.
 
LAVANDERA (on-camera): What is going through your mind at that time?
 
CLARK: I thought I was paralyzed.
 
LAVANDERA (on-camera): You've kept the backpack intact?
 
CLARK: Oh yes, this is my backpack. I might wash it eventually. I had to eat a lot of humble pie for this one.
 
LAVANDERA (voice-over): The bison's horn cut a wide gash in her back.
 
CLARK: I still know that I was too close. You know, I wasn't as diligent as I should have been. 
 
LAVANDERA (voice-over): Clark posted her video on Tik Tok, it went viral. And it also put the spotlight on this unique state park.
 
DONALD BEARD, SUPERINTENDENT OF CAPROCK CANYON STATE PARK: Bisons are definitely the keystone species.
 
LAVANDERA (voice-over): Donald Beard is the superintendent of Caprock Canyon State Park and a passionate advocate of growing bison herd populations across the country.
 
BEARD: It's really cool to be able to drive through this park and have bison walk across the road in front of you and seen them and know the history of them.
 
LAVANDERA (voice-over): In the 1870s, the Texas bison were decimated in the great slaughter but famed ranchers Charles and Mary Ann Goodnight saved a few. The descendants of those bison were bred and kept on a private ranch for decades. In 2011, the park released the bison to begin roaming freely through much of this 15,000-acre park. Since then, Beard says the herd grew from 80 animals to 350.
 
BEARD: The song, give me a home where the buffalo roam, that's where we live.
 
LAVANDERA (voice-over): Visitors are warned repeatedly to keep their distance. Here, the bison are king.
 
BEARD: They are survivors. You know, they've survived our best attempt at trying to get rid of them. And they're making a comeback.
 
LAVANDERA (on-camera): Has this changed your relationship with this animal?
 
CLARK: I'm sorry. Gosh, I can't believe you did this to me. I'm trying to protect the opportunity to go experience nature.
 
LAVANDERA (voice-over): This is what makes Rebecca Clark emotional. She'd be devastated if her encounter prevents others from this bison experience.
 
(on-camera): You love the outdoors that much? No, I think that's -- 
 
CLARK: Yes, wow.
 
LAVANDERA (on-camera): I'm so sorry.
 
CLARK: Wow. No, you'd said aha moment for me either. So, yes. I hope I didn't -- 
 
LAVANDERA (on-camera): Yes.
 
CLARK: -- somebody else from that.
 
LAVANDERA (voice-over): Ed Lavandera, CNN, Caprock Canyon State Park in Texas.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
SANCHEZ: To be fair, Ed Lavandera has made me cry on multiple occasions. He's such a good reporter. We appreciate that from him. Sadly, the woman didn't appear to be going after the bison. So many times on social media when you see people get hit by them, it's jerks. Could use other words jerks that are trying to go viral.
 
WALKER: Yes, yes. No, I -- and look, it's good on her for speaking out. You know, I'm sure she got her fair share of backlash just for what had happened. But look, she said, she had been it, it was her fault. She got too close. And, you know, she is a hiking enthusiast and she hopes that, you know, people will continue to enjoy the wild.
 
Just remember it's their land. We're encroaching on their space. So -- 
 
SANCHEZ: Yes, got to (INAUDIBLE).
 
WALKER: Yes, she's lucky. But I will not keep that backpack if -- I mean -- I wish I'm traumatized. Every time I walk by in, I'm like, this is what could have done to my entire torso. But anyway.
 
SANCHEZ: Yes, painful reminder. So have you bought your tickets yet, Amara? $1.6 billion, that's how much is up for grabs in tonight's Powerball drawing. It's been three months since anybody's won the Powerball jackpot.
 
WALKER: OK, but is anyone really hoping to win? I mean, your odds of winning are pretty slim one in 292.2 million, OK? But hey, I guess you can't win if you don't play. The jackpot has a lump sum option. Of course, you got to take the lump sum of an estimated $782 million.
 <br>[08:55:01]
 
And tonight's prize is on track to be the largest jackpot in history. But look, I never play the lottery but my husband called me and said please go buy some tickets. So I will go ahead and do it. You?
 
SANCHEZ: When if this -- when it's this high of a jackpot, you just have to play to a little bit of santeria (ph), get the spirits involved try to make your luck happen.
 
WALKER: You haven't even gotten your tickets yet, though. You're waiting to the last minute.
 
SANCHEZ: It's not too late. Yes, I feel like, you know -- 
 
WALKER: I guess.
 
SANCHEZ: -- some added juice to those tickets. Hey, thank you so much for joining us this morning. We appreciate it. We're going to be back here in just about an hour from now.
 
WALKER: And that's right. Smerconish is up next. We'll see you soon.
