BIANNA GOLODRYGA, CNN ANCHOR: The creation of a Ukrainian security zone on Russian soil is underway. ONE WORLD starts right now.
 
Ukraine has conducted its biggest attacks since the war began, as Russia is pulling reserves from Ukraine to try to hold back advances.
 
Also ahead, a pivotal moment. Negotiators are heading back to the table to discuss the war in Gaza. The key player that won't be attending.
 
And later, I'll bring you out the best in your date. It'll bring you the best in your date. The secret ingredient that has this cologne flying off 
 
 the shelves.
 
Hello, everyone. I'm Bianna Golodryga. Zain is off today. You are watching ONE WORLD.
 
Well, pushing forward, gaining ground, and hoping to change the dynamics of a deadlocked war. Ukrainian troops are advancing further inside Russia, 
 
 more than a week after a brazen cross-border incursion took the Kremlin by surprise.
 
Overnight, a security source says Kyiv conducted its biggest attack on Russian airfields since Moscow's full-scale invasion.
 
And while the intent of the operation is still unclear, one Ukrainian official says the objective is to protect the country's border region and 
 
 create a security zone on Russian soil.
 
Meanwhile, a military commander tells CNN that Russia is now pulling soldiers from the Ukrainian frontlines to try and halt Kyiv's advanced in 
 
 southwestern Kursk.
 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday, that a large number of Russian servicemen there have already surrendered.
 
CNN cannot independently verify those claims. We'll get back to Ukraine in just a moment for more coverage.
 
Well, ceasefire hostage talks will resume Thursday, but a key stakeholder will not be there. A diplomatic source tells CNN that Hamas will not take 
 
 part in the talks.
 
However, the source adds that the group is willing to speak to mediators if there are developments or a serious response from Israel.
 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office denies that he has added extra conditions to a May proposal that Hamas had supported. A key goal of a 
 
 ceasefire hostage deal is to stop a wider war in the Middle East that could reduce tensions with Israel's neighbor, Lebanon.

AMOS HOCHSTEIN, U.S. SPECIAL ENVOY: The deal would also help enable a diplomatic resolution here in Lebanon, and that would prevent an outbreak 
 
 of a wider war and create the conditions for the displaced Lebanese people to return to their homes in the South and the displaced Israeli residents 
 
 who return to their homes in their North.

GOLODRYGA: Nic Robertson is following the story from Tel Aviv and joins us now.
 
And, Nic, our colleague, Barak Ravid, is reporting that the prime minister approved the participation of the Israeli negotiations team in the Doha 
 
 meeting tomorrow, as well as the mandate for the talks.
 
So it looks like things are moving forward.
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Yes. David Barnea, the head of Mossad, the head of intelligence, Shin Bet, Ronen Bar, and also the 
 
 man in charge of the intelligence around all the hostages that Hamas is holding.
 
General Nitzan Alon, all three going, representing the Israeli government and Prime Minister Netanyahu. And of course, as you say, what remit he 
 
 gives him is hugely important.
 
There have been times when one and some -- or some of this delegation have essentially gone to talks with a remit of listening and not been empowered 
 
 to negotiate.
 
Now it's not quite clear what the term set for them and what latitudes will be, but what comes out of that meeting. And I think, you know, in terms of 
 
 the sort of sequential nature of all the talks that have happened in the past with the Israeli delegation in the room there with the mediators, 
 
 Qatar and Egypt, as well as Bill Burns, the head of the CIA, all being around the table together.
 
And then there's a pause because these are proximity talks. And then the Hamas delegation, the conditions that Hamas are putting on the -- on the 
 
 talks right now that will happen in Doha tomorrow is that they will engage if they feel that the talks are gone positively.
 
And when they say positively, that means no additional -- no additional sort of add-ons, if you will, put on to whatever the proposal is on the 
 
 table that they say should be the same proposal that they agreed to back in May. That was seemed to be running at least until the end of July.
 <br>[12:05:19]
 
So Hamas, using what they call ambiguity about their presence at the talks, my understanding is that there will be someone available to speak to the 
 
 mediators, but of course, it's going to depend on what comes out of those talks.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes. And so much focus on these talks. Many in the Israeli government, in the defense establishment in particular, are really 
 
 stressing that this may be the last opportunity for a hostage in ceasefire deal.
 
Nic Robertson, thank you so much.
 
Well amid the threat of a wider regional war in the Middle East, and as hopes for a Gaza ceasefire fade, the Biden administration has approved 
 
 roughly $20 billion in new weapon sales to Israel over the next several years.
 
It includes 50 F-15 fighter jets and air-to-air missiles and it's believed to be the largest single weapons package ever approved for Israel. 
 
 Deliveries will not begin for years and the sale must still be approved by Congress.
 
Minnesota Governor Tim Walz is facing new criticism following a video shared by "The Washington Examiner." It shows the Democratic vice 
 
 presidential candidate, while he was running for governor of Minnesota, praising a Muslim leader who had shared anti-Semitic content.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TIM WALZ, THEN -CANDIDATE FOR MINNESOTA GOVERNOR: I would like to, first of all, say thank you to Imam. I am a teacher. So when I see a master teacher, 
 
 I know it.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLODRYGA: On sharing anti-Semitic material and neo-Nazi propaganda on social media, the Imam, Asad Zaman, says he sometimes shares things without 
 
 fully reading them. Both Zaman and Walz deny a personal relationship.
 
Meanwhile, Walz is also defending his military record after Republican vice presidential candidate, J.D. Vance, accused Walz of lying about his 
 
 military service for political gain.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
WALZ: I am damn proud of my service to this country and I firmly believe you should never denigrate another person's service record.
 
If anyone brave enough to put on that uniform for our great country, including my opponent, I just have a few simple words, thank you for your 
 
 service and sacrifice.

GOLODRYGA: Meantime, Donald Trump returns to the campaign trail today with a rally in the crucial state of North Carolina.
 
The event is significant for a couple of reasons. First of all, North Carolina has been seen as a state that should be somewhat safe for Trump. 
 
 The fact that he is going there, perhaps is a sign of how the race has tightened within the last few weeks.
 
Perhaps more importantly, however, his campaign is billing this speech as major address on the economy. Republicans have been urging Trump to focus 
 
 more on the economy and less on personal attacks and grievances.
 
He followed that advice in a conversation with Spanish language network, Univision, on Tuesday.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We are going to get rid of inflation. Inflation has hurt the Hispanic population 
 
 so badly, but it's hurt everybody.
 
She's never going to do anything about inflation. She has no idea. She doesn't even know what it means. The word means.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLODRYGA: Let's go to CNN's Alayna Treene. She's tracking the Trump campaign for us.
 
So he was on message for that interview, but I know -- I believe, correct me if I'm wrong, we're expecting another press conference from the former 
 
 president tomorrow?
 
What do we know about this? And are there concerns within his own campaign that he may veer off topic again?
 
ALAYNA TREENE, CNN REPORTER: I think there are definitely concerns. But, yes, you're right, Bianna. We had just learned this morning that he is now 
 
 going to be holding a press conference tomorrow at his club in Bedminster, New Jersey. It will follow an event that he's doing with Jewish supporters 
 
 earlier in the day.
 
And this is all part of a messaging strategy by the Trump campaign to argue that, look, Donald Trump is willing to show up and, you know, be answered 
 
 tough questions from reporters. Kamala Harris hasn't done that.
 
And to their point, we haven't had a press conference from Kamala Harris or have her sit down with a major media outlet since she became the 
 
 presumptive democratic nominee. So that is a message that they are trying to push.
 
And you can expect them to talk a lot about that tomorrow. And you'll probably hear Donald Trump talk about that both today in North Carolina, 
 
 but also in New Jersey tomorrow.
 
Now, I do just want to talk a little bit more about North Carolina and this rally that he's holding there later today.
 
You're right. North Carolina is a state that has gone for Republicans in the last 10 out of 11 elections. However, Democrats have consistently run 
 
 very close there. And so the Trump campaign, as well as the Harris campaign, view North Carolina as a battleground state.
 
And even though he is going there today, he's been there a lot in the past over the course of this cycle. They've recognized that they will not just 
 
 win North Carolina easily, they actually have to work for it.
 <br>[12:10:05]
 
Now, as for his messaging, he does plan to focus on the economy. I talked to some of Donald Trump's advisors and they said, a part of that is because 
 
 they anticipate that Harris, who is also in North Carolina today, will be rolling out her own economic message, as well as a healthcare message.
 
And so his focus on that is to try and compare and contrast what Harris is saying with his own policy record. You can expect Trump to talk a lot about 
 
 -- excuse me, about gas prices, but also grocery prices. 
 
But also she's going -- he's going to argue that, you know, if she has a different policy from President Joe Biden, why is that different? This is 
 
 kind of part of their messaging of trying to tie Harris to the Biden administration and argue that she has been a mastermind behind a lot of 
 
 what Biden has done. We'll see how that works out for them today.
 
And then on healthcare, they're going to try to argue that Harris has been flip-flopping. They're going to point to her previous support of mental 
 
 care for all.
 
Now she's not as full-throated in support of it. They're going to be trying to hype that up, not only in these speeches, but also have Donald Trump 
 
 surrogates go out and hit the airwaves with that type of messaging.
 
But I think the big picture and what I'm trying to look for both in this rally today, but also in that press conference tomorrow, is whether or not 
 
 Donald Trump can actually stay on message.
 
It's no secret that, over the last several months, but particularly the last few weeks with now Harris being his new opponent, they have wanted 
 
 Donald Trump to talk about immigration, crime, the border. That is how many people think he will win in November.
 
But instead, he has gone off-script. He's done personal attacks. And a lot of his allies have been telling him this personally to stop attacking her, 
 
 but we've actually heard over the last 48 hours, a lot of those allies go on TV to make that case publicly as well.
 
And so I'm looking to see whether or not he heeds that advice.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes. One of those allies being Nikki Haley yesterday going on Fox News telling them to stop with the grievances and the personal attacks.
 
Alayna Treene, tracking the Trump campaign for us. Keep us posted. Thank you.
 
Well, Trump's economic speech comes in the wake of some very good economic news today. The consumer price index, a widely watched indicator of U.S. 
 
 inflation, has cooled to less than three percent over the past year.
 
Now, that is important because it is the lowest inflation rate since March of 2021. Economists say that should give the U.S. Federal Reserve room to 
 
 lower interest rates at its next meeting in September.
 
To help us understand the latest economic numbers and also look at their impact on the presidential race, we're joined by Justin Wolfers. He is a 
 
 professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan.
 
Another reason for you to smile this morning, Justin, is this positive report, for the first time inflation edging below three percent in several 
 
 years, three years now.
 
Looking through this report, specifically, the only problem spot, perhaps, if you're looking for one, is the cost of housing rose faster in July than 
 
 it did in June. Other than that, nothing but positive numbers here.
 
In terms of what we're expecting to hear from Donald Trump tomorrow about how bad the economy is, do you see any of that in this latest report?
 
JUSTIN WOLFERS, PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS AND PUBLIC POLICY, UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN: Bianna, this was really big news. This is the first time, I 
 
 think, economists can look you in the eye and say, it looks like that inflation surge is behind us.
 
We entered the pandemic with inflation at about two point something percent. It's now round about two point something percent and it's 
 
 continuing to decrease.
 
And in terms of the stuff that really bites for many of our viewers, grocery store prices. Grocery store prices have been not moving, no 
 
 inflation at all, neither up nor down over the past six months. It's giving a chance for people's wages and incomes to catch up. And people are 
 
 starting to feel like they're getting ahead.
 
And so if I were a political candidate who'd run a campaign on economic mismanagement, who hoped that fear of inflation would sustain me through to 
 
 November, I'd realized that story is pretty much run out of puff. And people are going to start to see the reality now that we're in a low 
 
 inflation environment again.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes. I mean, looking at these numbers and thinking back to what we heard from Donald Trump last week, he spent a lot of time specifically 
 
 talking about prices at the grocery store, which, let's be honest, were a real problem the last few years.
 
But this number suggesting that year over year, groceries overall up just one percent. In energy, the same. Airline prices down nearly three percent. 
 
 Use cars, a big focus several years ago, down 11 percent.
 
What does that tell us about what we can expect from the Fed tomorrow -- the Fed next month? Is a rate cut guaranteed in your view?
 
WOLFERS: So what we're hearing from the punters, people out there is a big sigh of relief that this inflationary moment's behind us.
 
And also what you're hearing right now is the Fed scrambling to adjust.
 
For the past three years, it had understood defeating inflation as its most important problem. It understood the importance of not raising the mission-
 
 accomplished banner too soon.
 <br>[12:15:08]
 
But now it's absolutely clear that inflation didn't take off, a wage price spiral didn't happen, inflation expectations still remain right where we 
 
 want them. And it's time for the Fed, instead to be worried about making sure that this economic recovery continues.
 
So I took a quick look at Futures markets just before we spoke. And they say not only is it a sure thing that the Fed cuts rates at the next 
 
 meeting, and I believe that. But, in fact, it's going to be a really big argument. The argument is going to be, should we cut rates slowly or 
 
 quickly?
 
And I think the case for cutting rates quickly is starting to build, which is if inflation's not a problem, you don't need rates at historically high 
 
 levels. And so we've got to move from a high level to a medium level. We want to do that quickly, so that's going to require a couple of big jumps.
 
GOLODRYGA: While Biden had been at the top of the ticket for the election, you saw a big delta in terms of American support and confidence in how he 
 
 was handling the economy versus Donald Trump. That has closed significantly now that Harris is on top of the ticket, even though the data hasn't really 
 
 changed much, and we don't know anything about the new policies she plans or perhaps will be implementing or rolling out.
 
We're expected to hear a little bit of that on Friday. And I'm just wondering from your perspective, you're not a political expert. But given 
 
 the trajectory things are on, the "Financial Times" over the weekend actually had a poll suggesting more Americans trust Kamala Harris in 
 
 handling the economy now.
 
Do you think that it's smart for her to get into any specifics at this point and deviate perhaps from the current Biden-Harris economic policy?
 
WOLFERS: Well, I'm not going to give Vice President Harris direct advice over her. She wants it, she knows how to call me.
 
But I think what we're seeing is unprecedented, which is people are now saying that they trust Kamala Harris on the economy more than Donald Trump.
 
Historically, people tend to say they would trust Republicans more than Democrats. I know a lot of Democrats were very frustrated by that who'd say 
 
 that they do a pretty good job on the economy, but I guess people tend to think of Republicans as being the party of business, and maybe that's got 
 
 something to do with the economy.
 
But this time, Kamala, as a head, and one question is why? And given how that she's not currently in power, she is, after all, only vice president. 
 
 And that she hasn't said that much.
 
I think what's really happening is that people are listening to Donald Trump. Trump's economic policies, almost every single one of them, would 
 
 boost inflation, adding tariffs, which are another form of tax to everything we buy. Reducing the competition on local retailers from China 
 
 is going to lead them to jack up their margins. And that's going to hurt all of us.
 
Or undermining the independence of the Fed and saying that President Trump, from the White House, should be setting interest rates. That gives no one 
 
 confidence.
 
And I think what's happening is all that Vice President Harris has to do is explain to the broader public what it is that Trump is saying inside his 
 
 rallies. And they'll -- and they are starting to disassociate Republicans from being a party of economic responsibility.
 
GOLODRYGA: And one thing we did see, throughout his administration, was his tendency to break norms. And once again, we're hearing from the former 
 
 president saying that perhaps the Fed, not even perhaps, that he should have some control. The president of the United States should have some 
 
 control and authority over the Fed's decision-making. Obviously, that has always been an independent body, and that is something that Kamala Harris 
 
 has reiterated.
 
Do you think there's any concern within the Fed now, perhaps, in terms of how they weigh in next month and if they decide on 25 basis points or half 
 
 a percentage point in terms of rate cuts? Do you think any of this will factor into their decision-making, given that we are likely, very likely, 
 
 to hear from Donald Trump once again expressing his disappointment with the Fed?
 
WOLFERS: It's a very tough balancing act, the Fed's official view. And I think they mean it, is that they're not affected by politics. They mean it 
 
 so much that they want to be perceived as not being affected by politics, which sometimes leads them to think about politics, to try and do the 
 
 opposite of what you would do if you were thinking about politics.
 
And if that feels like a sort ahead -- make your head explode, absolutely it would.
 
Look, there is a very serious issue, which does -- is very much on the minds of people both at the Fed and in financial markets, which is we have 
 
 plenty example -- of examples of populist strongmen who decide that they should run monetary policy from the president's office.
 
The most common -- the most recent example of this is Turkey. And, of course, that leads to a very unconventional monetary policy and an enormous 
 
 inflationary headache.
 
So I think it's important for people to realize, normally when economists in the United States are talking about policy things, we're talking about 
 
 things would affect a percentage point here, and a percentage point there, and things could be a little bit better or a little bit worse.
 <br>[12:20:06]
 
But if we lose the idea of the set of norms and institutions that have successfully guided industrialized countries, that's what caused Argentina 
 
 to shift from being one of the richest countries in the world to barely getting by.
 
That's what shifted Turkey from being a real powerhouse of an economy to one where people are struggling.
 
And so I think that the most important economic issue is not what happens this month versus next month. There are a quarter of percentage point here 
 
 versus there. But whether we stick with the model that's working of an independent central bank, a coherent fiscal policy and integration with the 
 
 global economy.
 
GOLODRYGA: Justin Wolfers, we will leave it there. Thank you so much for joining us. Always great to see you.
 
WOLFERS: Pleasure is mine.
 
GOLODRYGA: Well, still to come for us, CNN investigates a farming startup company, partially funded by J.D. Vance that allegedly had grueling working 
 
 conditions.

GOLODRYGA: A closer look at that company and Vance's response to the way it was managed.
 
Plus, a new study shows two-thirds of American women worry that a country- wide abortion ban could put them or a loved one in danger. We'll have more, up next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
GOLODRYGA: Well, two more U.S. states will let voters decide whether to establish a right to abortion and their state constitutions come November. 
 
 This has a growing number of women say they are concerned about abortion bans.
 
According to a new survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, about eight in ten democratic women of reproductive age, and four in ten Republican women 
 
 worry about abortion access if it's needed to preserve their life or health.
 
The survey also found that about 14 percent of Democrats and 12 percent of Republicans say they themselves have had an abortion.
 
CNN medical correspondent Meg Tirrell joins us now with more on this.
 
Meg, we know this is a major issue heading into the election. What more are we hearing from the survey?
 
MEG TIRRELL, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Bianna. It's really interesting to see the survey looked at almost 4,000 women of reproductive 
 
 age across the United States since Roe v. Wade was overturned. This was done just a couple months ago in 2024.
 
And what they find is sort of similar views on things among women in this age group even across the political spectrum.
 <br>[12:25:59]
 
Now, overall, as you mentioned, about two-thirds of women in this survey say that they're concerned that either they or someone close to them would 
 
 not be able to access an abortion if needed to preserve their life or health.
 
Sixty-four percent say that their concern that abortion bans may affect the safety of a future pregnancy for them or somebody they know.
 
And in these data, eight percent of respondents said already it had been difficult for them to access an abortion since Roe v. Wade was overturned. 
 
 And that's up to 13 percent in states that have abortion bans.
 
Now, across the spectrum, 70 percent of women of reproductive age in this survey say they support a nationwide right to abortion. The study also 
 
 broke this down by political affiliation. And what they find is that Democrats, 86 percent of women in this survey, say that they oppose leaving 
 
 this issue up to states.
 
For independents, that was 73 percent. Or if people don't affiliate with either party.
 
For Republicans, it was still a slim majority, 53 percent. So they don't want this to be left up to the states.
 
Now, you were talking about states that will have abortion on the ballot in November. We're expecting at least eight, including some recently added 
 
 initiatives.
 
The survey specifically looked at Florida and Arizona as particularly important states, both for abortion access and thought to be important 
 
 swing states in the election more broadly.
 
What they find is that 70 percent or more of women of reproductive age in those states believe that abortion should be legal in all or most 
 
 circumstances.
 
So, of course, there's a lot of eyes on whether these abortion laws in these states will get changed as a result of the election. And also, if 
 
 this will drive more people to the polls and influence how they vote across the ballot, Bianna.
 
GOLODRYGA: All right. Meg Tirrell, really interesting. Thank you so much.
 
Well, Israelis want the hostages in Gaza to come home now. And they're making their voices heard. Now that talks are set to resume tomorrow, 
 
 they're demanding that Israel end the war, the U.S. agrees.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:30:47]
 
GOLODRYGA: Welcome back to ONE WORLD. I'm Bianna Golodryga.
 
Well, in less than a day, ceasefire talks resume in Doha. Hamas has opted not to participate. That's according to diplomatic source, which adds that 
 
 Hamas left the door open to talking with mediators if there are positive developments.
 
U.S. President Joe Biden spoke to reporters about wider implications of a ceasefire deal.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It's getting hard. We'll see what Iran does and what we'll see what happens if there's any attack. But 
 
 I'm not giving up.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are those two things tied together? Do you have any understanding that Iran could cease or stop doing an action if a ceasefire 
 
 deal was possible?
 
BIDEN: That's my expectation, but we'll see.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLODRYGA: Meanwhile in Israel, protesters are demanding that Prime Minister Netanyahu work out any agreement that brings Israeli hostages 
 
 home.
 
One former hostage, whose husband is still being held, tells CNN their desperation is growing, but their patience is running out.

AVIVA SIEGEL, FORMER HOSTAGE HELD BY HAMAS: I'm begging the world, please let it happen. I'm begging the world.
 
I don't -- I can't even imagine what will happen if it will fall apart. Because I'll fall apart. And so many people will fall apart. We are waiting 
 
 and waiting and we've been waiting for so long.

GOLODRYGA: Time now for The Exchange. And someone who knows the pain of having a loved one taken on October 7th, Rachel Goldberg-Polin is the 
 
 mother of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, one of the eight Americans being held in Gaza, and one of the five Americans believed to still be alive.
 
Rachel, thank you so much for joining us today. Here you are. I see that tape you're wearing day 313. It is so hard to believe.
 
But I also heard you recently say that every day that goes by without bad news, you view as good news. And here we are on the eve of a very important 
 
 ceasefire hostage deal negotiation set for tomorrow. One that many in the Israeli government are saying, this is the last best hope for a deal right 
 
 now.
 
What is your message for the negotiators?
 
RACHEL GOLDBERG-POLIN, MOTHER OF HERSH GOLDBERG-POLIN: Well, we are all as my friend Aviva, who you just played part of her interview from yesterday, 
 
 every single hostage family, and not just every single person I speak to in this entire region, is suffering so terribly.
 
This must come to an end. It's not just for the hostages and the hostage families and the people in Israel, it's for the hundreds of thousands of 
 
 innocent Gazan people who are suffering horribly.
 
Every single person in this region has a surplus of torment and agony, and we are all begging the negotiators and the leaders of the two parties to do 
 
 what is best for the people, put ego aside, put every other interest and equity aside. And I know that that's a really huge ask, but the time has 
 
 come to be human and to care about your people.
 
GOLODRYGA: Right. There is so much at stake here, both for the civilians in Gaza and obviously for the hostages as well, including Hersh.
 
And as we've been focusing on recently, the past few days, there is now a very public disagreement within this government, especially within the 
 
 intelligence and defense establishment versus the prime minister's office.
 
The defense establishment saying now is the time for a deal that they are reassured that there can even be a ceasefire in place that they believe 
 
 could still guarantee safety for Israelis that would get these hostages home.
 
And I want to read for you some of the statements that we're hearing. The Mossad Chief, Barnea, who will be taking place -- to taking part in that -- 
 
 in that meeting tomorrow, on Channel 12 in Israel a few weeks ago said, there is a deal. If we hesitate, we may miss the opportunity. We have to 
 
 take it.
 
Defense Minister Gallant on a readout, many of his readouts with his counterparts, this most recent one with Lloyd Austin. He highlighted the 
 
 urgency of achieving an agreement for the release of the hostages.
 <br>[12:35:05]
 
And, Rachel, knowing that I would speak to you, a senior security official in the Israeli government told me this. There are people within the system 
 
 who are still pushing and still believe the conditions are right for a deal. We believe this first and foremost because we want the hostages to 
 
 come home. The defense establishment is committed to the hostage deal. There should be no doubt about it.
 
So given all of that, what is your message to the Prime Minister himself directly? Because there is so much focus on what action he will take 
 
 regarding the deal.
 
GOLDBERG-POLIN: Well, I think that it's important to remember that this deal was presented by Prime Minister Netanyahu on May 27th to the Americans 
 
 and President Biden elucidated the deal, I believe it was on May 31st.
 
And everyone in the security establishment who is saying those different ideas that you were just reading back to me, is based on Prime Minister 
 
 Netanyahu's framework.
 
And I know that he knows what he's doing. I know he wouldn't have created that framework if he didn't believe in it. And the fact that his security 
 
 establishment is all behind it and saying, this is what we should do and we should move forward. And we know that from the other side, there's such 
 
 horrible suffering as well that now is the time.
 
And so I, of course -- I'm aware that Prime Minister Netanyahu knows how to negotiate and knows how to create a deal. And if the security establishment 
 
 believes in that deal, I -- I'm just a mother. I am a high school teacher. I'm not a military tactician. I trust that the security establishment and 
 
 Prime Minister Netanyahu being the crafters of this. I trust them. And I think that we should move forward.
 
GOLODRYGA: Obviously, this would end if Hamas released the hostages. They are ultimately to blame here, but there are many pointing to the fact that 
 
 there has been a deal on the table now for many months and the Prime Minister himself has not publicly embraced it to the fullest extent.
 
And there's criticism now, even from, again, within the defense and military establishment to comments that he made recently about the hostages 
 
 saying, they're suffering, but they aren't dying.
 
And we have seen video Hamas has released, horrible images over the past few months. We did get proof of life of Hersh. But we're hearing reports 
 
 that there just isn't much time left.
 
And in fact, someone in the defense establishment said, no, they are suffering. They are actually dying too.
 
What is your message to the world now, given that we know that the conditions are so dire for these hostages? And I would imagine you think of 
 
 Hersh every single day that goes by sitting there and perhaps feeling more and more vulnerable.
 
GOLDBERG-POLIN: Of course. I think the dialogue really has to be not an or but an and. Meaning, I can be worried about the hundreds of thousands of 
 
 innocent civilians in Gaza. And I can be worried about the civilians in Gaza who were dragged there on October 7th, including my only son, Hersh, 
 
 who, as you know, before being stolen, had his left dominant forearm blown off. And we are all in agony.
 
And we all need for this to end. And we aren't any more privy to information than you are than normal people are who are following news or 
 
 media. And we don't know what's happening behind the scenes.
 
And I really hope and pray, and I try to stay optimistic. And we always say every morning, my husband and I, when we get out of bed, hope is mandatory. 
 
 It's not a suggestion. It's not advice. It's absolutely mandatory. And we need to move forward. And this entire region needs to move forward.
 
And the quickest way to reduce the tension and take the pressure off of this entire region is to bring hostages home and have a halt to this 
 
 horrible situation that we all find ourselves in.
 
GOLODRYGA: Rachel, I know you call yourself just a mother or just a teacher. Those in and of itself are very important jobs. But you should 
 
 also know that you are a voice for so many, for so many that are suffering now, that have loved ones, that remain hostage.
 
You say you put on a mask, that this is an alternate reality that you live in, but you are doing such important work. And I think about that new Torah 
 
 scroll that you and your husband dedicated to the 115 hostages that remain in Gaza.
 <br>[12:40:06]
 
We will be closely monitoring these talks tomorrow and hoping for the best.
 
GOLDBERG-POLIN: Amen and thank you, Bianna, for the opportunity and may we hear good news soon. Miraculous, good news.
 
GOLODRYGA: Amen, indeed.
 
Rachel Goldberg-Polin, thank you so much for joining us.
 
And as Rachel noted, for families like the Goldbergs and those living in the war zone, a peace deal can't come soon enough.
 
Just in the past 24 hours, the toll from Israeli strikes has ticked up, including 3-day old twins and their mother.
 
CNN's Jeremy Diamond has this heartbreaking report.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): How do you console a man whose whole world has been shattered?
 
A man who hours earlier was locked in the warm embrace of his wife and newborn babies, but now cries out in agony, begging to see them one last 
 
 time?
 
His new horrific reality is too much to bear.
 
His wife and twin babies are dead, killed in an Israeli strike on their apartment in Central Gaza, according to hospital officials.
 
Ayssel and her brother Asser (ph) were just 3 days old. The Palestinian Ministry of Health says they are among 115 infants born and killed during 
 
 the war in Gaza.
 
Hours earlier, their mother, Jumana (ph), a pharmacist, was blissfully responding to congratulations and well wishes on Facebook. I feel like it 
 
 was a miracle. Alhamdulillah, sister, everything is going well.
 
Jumana, Ayssel, and Asser now lie here in a room consumed with Mohammed's inconsolable grief.
 
These are the birth certificates, he says. While I was getting them, I received a phone call telling me our apartment was targeted. And that my 
 
 wife and children were at Al-Aqsa Hospital.
 
Neighbors are still sifting through the aftermath of that strike. Hospital officials say an Israeli shell hit the building. The Israeli military did 
 
 not respond to CNN's request for comments.
 
The victims of several other strikes in Central Gaza also pour into Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, where more parents grieve the deaths of their children.
 
How can I live after you, my son? This mother cries.
 
Amid the grief, there is also anger and exasperation, including from the dead man's father.
 
The entire unjust world does not care about this. That's all I can say, Hassan (ph) says. Just numbers. We are just numbers. But for God, we are 
 
 martyrs.
 
One by one, their bodies are brought out of the morgue so the living can pray for the dead, including nine-month-old Jamal and his father, Uday 
 
 (ph).
 
Mohammed is performing the same rituals for his wife and twin babies. But prayers offer little comfort for a man who has lost everything, for a new 
 
 father with no children to raise.

GOLODRYGA: All right. Turning now to U.S. politics. Donald Trump's vice presidential pick, J.D. Vance, has proclaimed that he's a champion for the 
 
 working class.
 
But a new CNN investigation found that before entering politics, Vance was an early investor in a farming startup. That company promised to provide 
 
 jobs for locals in Kentucky. Ultimately, it failed. And workers allege they experienced, quote, nightmare conditions and were eventually replaced with 
 
 migrant laborers.
 
CNN's Kyung Lah has the story.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MORGAN: A nightmare. It was a nightmare that should have never happened.
 
LAH (voice-over): That nightmare happened here at this nearly empty greenhouse in Eastern Kentucky. AppHarvest, a failed high-tech startup, 
 
 promised local workers a future that spiraled into broken promises.
 
Anthony Morgan bought into the company's public pitch that it was for Appalachia, by Appalachians.
 
MORGAN: We was being told that, hey guys, he's from here.
 
SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH), U.S. VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Thank you. Wow.
 
LAH (voice-over): He is J.D. Vance, the Republican nominee for vice president.
 
VANCE: I will be a vice president who never forgets where he came from.
 
LAH (voice-over): Leaning on his personal rise out of poverty to reach swing state voters as Donald Trump's running mate.
 
TRUMP: I chose him because he's for the worker. He's for the people that work so hard and perhaps weren't treated like they should have been.
 
LAH (voice-over): But before politics, Vance was a venture capitalist, an AppHarvest's first outside investor, eventually steering millions of 
 
 dollars to the company.
 
Vance was a lead pitchman for the vertical farming startup, tweeting he was a supporter and investor, writing, "I love this company."
 
VANCE: It's a great business that's making a big difference in the world.
 
LAH (voice-over): The company's investor presentation pledged a commitment to Appalachia, estimating thousands of new jobs to a poverty stricken area.
 
MORGAN: A major emphasis with them was we want to bring work to Eastern Kentucky. This is why we are here.
 
LAH (voice-over): Morgan left a stable job to join AppHarvest as a crop care specialist, pruning the greenhouse grown vegetables.
 
A single father with 6-year-old twins. The job rapidly turned when production fell behind under what a dozen workers described to CNN as 
 
 mismanagement, including dangerous conditions.
 
Employees filed multiple complaints to the state and federal government alleging heat exhaustion, working in extreme temperatures, and lack of 
 
 water breaks. Though the cases were all closed with no citations.
 
MORGAN: I think about the hottest that I experienced was around 128 degrees.
 
LAH: Inside?
 
MORGAN: Inside. A couple days a week, you'd have ambulance show up, and you've seen people leaving on gurneys to go to the hospital.
 
LAH (voice-over): The cuts came next to promised worker benefits. And then foreign workers came in to fill those so-called local jobs.
 
MORGAN: The second round of folks they brought in was folks on work visas and they didn't bring just a van full, they brought bus loads.
 
LAH (voice-over): Documents show AppHarvest hired contract workers from outside the region. At one point, as many as 500, the majority of its 
 
 workforce, not locals.
 
But that's not the image AppHarvest wanted the world to see. This is Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell visiting in 2021.
 
LAH: Mitch McConnell coming through. Were the migrant workers there at the time?
 
(LAUGHS)
 
You're laughing. I mean, I look at the video, it doesn't look like there's any --
 
MORGAN: They hid these guys. They took them out of the plant. They was gone. And then Mitch McConnell was giving a speech about all this work that 
 
 AppHarvest has brought Eastern Kentuckians.
 
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): I like the idea of taking the tomato market away from the Mexicans. How about that?
 
LAH: So they were trying to hide the migrant workers?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Specifically, yes.
 
LAH (voice-over): This worker, who asked not to be identified, says the hiring of migrant workers became part of a mirage that AppHarvest was 
 
 helping the region.
 <br>[12:50:09]
 
He took this video as his co-workers clapped for visiting investors.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And any time they did that, they kept workers off the floor doing our like stationary parade while people come through. And, yes, 
 
 it was -- it was awkward having to stand there and just be a prop.
 
LAH: A prop for what?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You know, look at all of these poor folks were employing.
 
LAH (voice-over): The worker says it's impossible to forget about his time at AppHarvest as J.D. Vance ascends to national politics.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's gotten away with a lot of money and fame for pretending to be one of us.
 
VANCE: O-H-I-O.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's just another grifter, just another carpetbagger, another tourist who wants to tell us what we are.
 
LAH (voice-over): Vance left the board in April 2021 to run for the Senate. Shortly after, shareholders filed suit claiming they were misled.
 
By 2023, AppHarvest had filed for bankruptcy a little more than two years after its public launch. But the workers in this failed startup say they 
 
 are the real people in the Vance story.
 
LAH: Do you blame J.D. Vance for any of this?
 
MORGAN: I blame all of the original investors at AppHarvest. The original board of directors know what was coming. You would have had to have been an 
 
 idiot not to have.
 
LAH: CNN's review of documents and interviews with a dozen former workers show that problems emerge while Vance was still a member of AppHarvest's 
 
 board.
 
Now after he departed, he was still an investor and had more than $100,000 invested in the company according to disclosures.
 
A spokesman for Vance says the CNN in a statement, "J.D. was not aware of the operational decisions regarding hiring, employee benefits, or other 
 
 workplace policies which were made after he departed AppHarvest's board. Like all early supporters, J.D. believed in AppHarvest's mission and wishes 
 
 the company would have succeeded."

GOLODRYGA: Well, a hot new scent for men is spreading across the gridiron ahead of football season.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They try to define you. But you are the ingredient to your own success.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLODRYGA: Oh, my goodness. That is Tennessee Titans quarterback, Will Levis, announcing his new cologne collaboration with Hellman's mayonnaise. 
 
 That's right.
 
The fragrance -- the fragrance is inspired by his love of whipped eggs and oil. It features notes of tart lemon and parsley with coffee, musk, and 
 
 vanilla undertones. And, of course, mayonnaise.
 
The cologne, you should know, sold out within 90 minutes online.
 
Not to worry. You can get a second helping starting today.
 
OK. I have to be honest. That just sounds so unappealing, but to each their own.
 
And that does it for this hour of ONE WORLD.
 
I'm Bianna Golodryga. Thanks so much for watching. "Amanpour" is up next.
