KATE BOLDUAN, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  Right now, rescue efforts are under way in Turkey to save an American explorer who is stuck deep inside a cave. Officials say, Mark Dickey, he is an expert caver. He's been doing this for some 30 years but he fell ill while caving this time and he's sick enough that it's made it impossible for him to climb out on his own.
 <br>[10:35:00]
 
Dickey is stuck more than 3,000 feet down, and officials say, it could take days to get him out. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh has more on this risky mission ahead.
 
JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Kate, we don't really know the full details of what really happened, but what we do know from the Turkish Caving Federation is that American caver Mark Dickey, who is part of a local and international research team fell ill a few days ago, more than 3,000 feet from the entrance of Turkey's third deepest cave.
 
The Hungarian Cave Rescue Service that is involved in this rescue operation say that he lost a lot of blood as a result of the gastrointestinal bleeding. He has received six units of blood, and has been stabilized. His condition is improving. His bleeding has stopped. He is able to walk on his own, and in stable condition, according to the Turkish Federation. He is, right now, at base camp and that's still about 3,000 feet from the entrance, and it is a real logistical challenge to get him out of there.
 
This is a rescue operation right now involving more than 150 personnel from Turkey, from its emergency and disaster agency, as well as rescuers from many countries, including U.S., Bulgaria, Italy, Poland, Croatia, and many others. And this is a very complex rescue effort. Mark Dickey, himself, according to his bio is a very experienced caver. He has been doing this for decades right now. He has been caving in 20 U.S. states and 10 countries since is '90s, he's a rescuer himself and a rescue instructor. He's the chief of the New Jersey Initial Response Team focusing on cave, cliff and abandoned mine rescue.
 
The Turkish Federation says, it takes 15 hours for an experienced caver to reach the surface in ideal conditions. And this cave has really narrow and winding passages, making it hard to get him on a stretcher and get him out of there. They're consulting with doctors on moving him out. And they expect that this effort could take days. Kate.
 
BOLDUAN:  Jomana, thank you so much. We'll keep us updated on this.
 
Sara.
 
SARA SIDNER, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  All right. We're following two manhunts under way this morning. The first is out of Washington. D.C. Metropolitan Police are looking for this man that you see here to my right. He is 30 years old. His name is Christopher Haynes who, they say, escaped custody while at George Washington University Hospital yesterday. An emergency alert describes the homicide suspect as armed and dangerous.
 
Now, that comes as police in Pennsylvania is searching for Danelo Cavalcante. He escaped prison last week after this incredible video where he's crab-walking his way up the walls. He looks just a bit like Spider-Man when you see that video.
 
I want to discuss all of this with Former U.S. Marshall John Muffler. Thank you so much for joining us, John. We're seeing this dramatic video of Cavalcante, sort of, making his way up the wall. Very much like Spider-Man. And apparently, there was another inmate that almost, an identical escape in that same place back in May. What is your reaction just seeing this video and how he did this and that nobody caught it?
 
JOHN MUFFLER, FORMER U.S. MARSHALL:  It's -- yes, it's quite remarkable that it happened twice. Once was plenty, that should have been fixed. I know there was an assessment done to fix that. Those recommendations required them to fix that, but it did not happen. And another inmate took advantage of that, and was able to, as you say, be Spider-Man and go up the wall very easily. It shows you some strength there, too, on his behalf and able to exploit that gap that wasn't fixed.
 
SIDNER:  Exactly. I do want to ask you about some of the ways that authorities are trying to find him. There's densely wooded areas. It is very hot. But they're using some sort of heat-seeking technology, as we understand it. Can you explain what it is and how it's used?
 
MUFFLER:  Yes, I know that the -- it's very hot there in Southeastern Pennsylvania right now. So, that will impact the infrared that's used to detect that type of body heat. So, there are some complications with that. But, yes, and you're looking to find any way to gain an advantage using technology to locate this person, via drones or whatever it may be. But that is one way they're looking into it to track him.
 
SIDNER:  So, obviously, residents in the area have been warned and they are -- they should be on edge. Is there anything that you can tell people in order to keep themselves safe as this manhunt goes who knows how long?
 <br>[10:40:00]
 
MUFFLER:  Yes, be vigilant. Don't let your guard down. Report anything that seems remotely suspicious, whether that's, you know, as I have said before, you know, loose change from your car being stolen, those are small items but, you know, Cavalcante has to survival somehow. It's hot. He's got to be hungry and thirsty. He is obviously moving at night time. So, be vigilant. Lock your doors. Report all of those things.
 
I will say this, too. I just learned this from some sources, but our law enforcement authorities have been in contact with Brazilian law enforcement authorities. And they've learned that, you know, he lived in the trees in Brazil after -- while he was on the run in Brazil. So, that's something that investigators need to keep in mind. It's not just what is in front of them or under them, he could be up in the trees, which is a very heavily wooded area in that part of the state.
 
SIDNER:  Wow. That is quite some information. So, you learned that, you know, authorities in Brazil, where he was also accused of serious criminal activity said that he lived in the trees. And he is in an area that is filled with trees. So, that's something that authorities need to understand and know as they are looking for him. This is an ongoing investigation. Obviously, we will be checking in with you as to how it goes, and after you check with your sources. Thank you so much for bringing us that new information and for coming on this morning. Appreciate it.
 
John.
 
JOHN BERMAN, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  They should start looking up, not just at the ground, apparently.
 
A federal judge has just ordered Texas to remove the floating barriers that had injured migrants as they try and cross into the U.S. A new response from the Texas governor.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:45:00]
 
BERMAN:  This morning, Texas Governor Greg Abbott is vowing to keep the floating barriers in the Rio Grande despite a federal judge ordering the state to remove them. The judge gave Texas just over a week to pull them out of the water after the Justice Department argued they violated the law. But Governor Abbott's office says, the ruling will be overturned. And added, they are ready to take this fight all the way to the Supreme Court.
 
CNN's Rosa Flores joins us now the very latest on this. Rosa, where is it headed?
 
ROSA FLORES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, you know, John, this is going to be a big Texas brawl between Governor Greg Abbott and the U.S. Department of Justice. But let me take you through this order by this federal judge, because it's very interesting. This judge from get-go said that he was going to stick to the facts, and he laid out the facts in his latest order saying that by federal law the State of Texas needed a permit to deploy these border buoys in the river, and that the State of Texas did not obtain that permit.
 
Let me read you a portion of this ruling. The judge saying, "Governor Abbott announced that he was not asking for permission for Operation Lone Star, the anti-immigration program under which Texas constructed the floating barrier. Unfortunately for Texas, permission is exactly what federal law requires before installing obstructions in the nation's navigable waterways."
 
Now, this judge goes on to say that the State of Texas tried, attempted to use a self-defense argument here. In essence saying that the State of Texas is under an invasion by migrants and by the cartels. But this judge was not buying it. He did not buy it in court. I was inside that courtroom. He actually stopped the attorneys from the State of Texas multiple times telling them to stick to the issues and not to fentanyl or to widespread immigration issues. And he did the same thing in this order, saying that he was just not buying the argument. Saying, "It was unconvincing."
 
Now, Governor Greg Abbott striking back. Sticking to the fact that, according to Governor Abbott, the State of Texas has constitutional authority to deploy these buoys. Saying in a statement, "This ruling is incorrect and will be overturned on appeal. We will continue to utilize every strategy to secure the border, including deploying Texas National Guard soldiers and Department of Public Safety troopers and installing strategic barriers."
 
John, this is a brawl. It will continue. We will follow it all. Back to you.
 
BERMAN:  All right. Rosa, keep us posted. Really just the beginning here. Appreciate it.
 
Kate.
 
BOLDUAN:  Still ahead for us, Americans are stealing show at the U.S. Open. And now, we could be looking at an all-American women's final, potentially. Preview of tonight's semifinals, next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:50:00]
 
SIDNER:  Ooh, that's a good little jingle.
 
Three Americans are just one match away from reaching the finals at the U.S. Open. And two of them will be on the court tonight.
 
CNN's Sports Correspondent Carolyn Manno joins us now from Arthur Ashe Stadium. Carolyn, we could have all three Americans finalists on the women's side? This is incredible. CAROLYN MANNO, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT:  It is certainly possible that these two American women, Sara, could make it past the next round, but it's going to be a very big challenge. Both have been playing with a tremendous amount of confidence. A lot of casual tennis fans really know Coco Gauff as this teenage sensation who burst onto this scene at Wimbledon back in 2019 when she beat Venus Williams and made a deep run. And they haven't really been following what's happening with her since.
 
And since that time, she's continued to developed her game. The forehand is there. And what she's done has proven that she is worth the initial hype.
 <br>[10:55:00]
 
I mean, she is having a phenomenal tournament so far. She just runs into a player, Karolina Muchova, who is going to be really tough to beat. A fantastic all court player who really knows how to switch up the pace. It's going to be a really tight contest. And I think whoever serves the best is probably going to win.
 
Then you have Madison Keys who's been playing great. Again, with a lot of confidence. The only problem there is that she runs into an absolutely buzz saw in Aryna Sabalenka who, at the end of this tournament, will be the top ranked player in women's tennis. For Aryna Sabalenka, the serve has looked phenomenal. She has just been locked in and ice cold.
 
And then you mentioned the American men on the men's side that has captivated everybody's attention, Sara. Ben Shelton, that 20 years old who is the absolute break out star of this tournament, going to face Novak Djokovic. His serve has been phenomenal. It is huge. Offensively he's got tremendous firepower but it's not easy to get past Novak Djokovic. Very few players are able to do it. So, that's going to be a tough test for him. But after beating Frances Tiafoe in this popcorn ready moment, this is more appointment viewing for this young collegiate player who is just phenomenally well. It's very exciting, Sara, to see how the American have done.
 
SIDNER:  It is. Ben Shelton, Coco Gauff, Madison Keys, we are watching -- these shots of them as athletes, man. I just -- I hope for the best for them. This is going to be really, really cool. Thank you so much Carolyn Manno. Appreciate it. Have fun. Have fun watching in person.
 
John, should we go?
 
BERMAN:  Let's. Let's.
 
SIDNER:  Let's go.
 
BERMAN:  Let's go, America.
 
All right. The new CNN poll that is a huge warning sign for President Biden. What issue concerns voters that most and who is the only Republican with a clear lead over President Biden?
