MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR: Hello and warm welcome to our viewers joining us in the United States and all around the world. I'm Max Foster in London. Just ahead --

STACEY ABRAMS, U.S. DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR GEORGIA GOVERNOR:  They like to use that power to strip us of our freedoms, our freedom to vote. Our freedom to be safe from gun violence. Our freedom to control our own bodies in the state of Georgia. 
 
SEN. RICK SCOTT (R-FL): This idea that government can build an economy is just complete fallacy. It's never worked anywhere. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Voter suppression is just as much a lie as voter fraud. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I turned around and I told the crowd, you can't come this way. People are dying.

ANNOUNCER: Live, from London, this is CNN NEWSROOM with Max Foster. 
 
FOSTER: It is Monday, October 31st, 8:00 a.m. here in London, 4:00 a.m. on the U.S. East Coast where the final stretch of the midterm elections has begun. So far more than 20 million early ballots have been cast and to get more votes candidates are hitting the campaign trail with some urgency. Polls show Republicans have a slight edge right now and trying to keep that advantage by pledging to fix the economy. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEN. RICK SCOTT (R-FL): This is our year. Democrats can't run on anything they've done. People don't like what they've done. They don't like high inflation. They don't like gas prices, food prices up. They don't like -- the public didn't like an open border. They don't like high crime. And that's what the Democrats are known for. You know, they've done all these things. Democrats did it. They did it. And they want to run away from it. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: Meanwhile, a number of Democrats are trying to sway voters by painting the other side as a threat to democracy. But not everyone thinks that strategy will work. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER: There is this last-minute push that is going on in certain segments of Democratic base to try to turn out black voters, an argument that's called black pack that has a script that they're using when they knock on doors saying that Republicans tried to throw out our votes in Atlanta and Philadelphia and in Detroit in 2020. We have to stop that from happening. There's a push on all sorts of -- trying to get to the voters who voted in 2018 and 2020 but are not regular voters and get them concentrated. They feel like, look, there are a lot of race that are still very close here and if they can push up 5,000 votes, 10,000 votes in a race that could decide a lot of these races. 
 
A lot of Democrats whether they're elected officials, party leaders, strategists are panicked that they feel like things are not going well for them in the midterms right now. They are panicked beyond that because they're thinking that this is about democracy and its very core that might be at stake here. Whether it's election deniers who are coming in or people who think they may be paving the way for a Donald Trump return. 
 
I was in Baltimore yesterday at a campaign event, Senator Chris Von Holland leading Democrat in the Senate said that authoritarian is on the rise from Moscow to Mar-a-Lago. That's the way Democrats feel here and they feel in a real existential way like if they don't do well next week in the midterms, that American democracy is in trouble and they are worried that that's where things are headed. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
FOSTER: One of the people leading the Democrat's push is former President Barack Obama. He's been rallying for his party in the five- state tour. Other big names on the campaign trail include President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump. In Georgia, Republican Governor Brian Kemp and Democratic nominee Stacey Abrams are faced off on Sunday in their final gubernatorial debate. The pair sparred on key issues like the state's economy, abortion rights and concerns over growing crime and gun safety. Here is a portion on what they said as gun control. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
STACEY ABRAMS, U.S. DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR GEORGIA GOVERNOR: Georgia is known as lead pipeline. It is so terrible and George are when it comes to the weakened gun laws in this state that we were the subject of an episode of "FBI Most Wanted" because Georgia is so easy to get a gun and transfer a weapon. BRIAN KEMP (R) GEORGIA GOVERNOR: Ms. Abrams is trying to scare you at
 
 home about the constitutional carry legislation that was simply a let you abide by your Second Amendment rights. And she doesn't want to talk about her cosponsoring legislation that actually would confiscate your firearm.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE) 
 
FOSTER: The two also clashed over the economy and the best way to manage it. Take a listen. 
 <br>[04:05:00]
 
KEMP: Americans are hurting right now because of a disastrous policy agenda by Joe Biden and the Democrats that have complete control in Washington, D.C. Thankfully in Georgia because we were open even when Ms. Abrams didn't want us to be, our economy has been incredibly resilient. We've had two record years for economic development in a row, record number of investment, record number of jobs and people's salaries are going up. The problem is they're not going up fast enough to keep up with Joe Biden's inflation. 
 
ABRAMS: We also have the responsibility of understanding what is driving jobs away from Georgia. Under this governor we've lost $150 million in investment. Music Midtown pulled out. We lost MLB games. We know that the entertainment industry is thinking about leaving Georgia because of the abortion ban that is driving women away. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
FOSTER: Governor Kemp has led in most polls but Abrams has a strong base of support and officials say Georgia is on track to see 2 million people cast their ballots in early voting. CNN's Nadia Romero shows us how some churches are mobilizing the faithful. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NADIA ROMERO, CNN U.S. CORRESPONDENT: It is the last Sunday of early voting here in Georgia. Traditionally called "Souls to the Polls" here. And that means that people from black churches, once church lets out Sunday service, they head over to the polls stroll, either in the stroll or walk, or they're bussed over to gather as a group to vote in that next election. That's what's happening all throughout today on Sunday. 
 
And it is so important to keep that vote for this community, a community -- a community that makes up a great percentage of votes here in the state of Georgia. And that's what we're hearing from a senior pastor. We're here at Beulah Missionary Baptist Church in Decatur, Georgia, just outside of Atlanta. I want you to hear from Deacon Brown was 99 years old, on Friday, it was his birthday and he made sure he voted. We also spoke with other people in the congregation to tell us why it is so important to keep up this right to vote.
 
DEACON RALPH BROWN, 99-YEAR-OLD VOTER: There was a time when we were called all different kind of names and there was even a time when they gave us money to keep our mouths shut.
 
JO HANDY-SEWELL, DIRECTOR OF SOCIAL JUSTICE MINISTRY, BEULAH BAPTIST MISSIONARY CHURCH: The intimidation here in Georgia is subtle. You take the drop boxes away. You confuse people about the dates and the times and the where.
 
ROMERO: Now "Souls to the Polls" continues -- not just here in the state of Georgia but all across the country.
 
Nadia Romero, CNN, DeKalb County, Georgia.

FOSTER: While the election drama builds in the U.S., Brazilians have already gone to the polls and counted the ballots as well. They've elected former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva by a razor thin margin in Sunday's presidential runoff. Thousands of Lula supporters cheered and celebrated in the streets after the results came in. The leftist Lula won just over 50 percent of the vote in the second round defeating the far right and current President Jair Bolsonaro. He finished with about 49 percent. 
 
In his victory speech, Lula said he is part happy, part worried about the transition of power. He said he's not yet received a call from Mr. Bolsonaro conceding the race. An emotional Lula think supporters and spoke passionately about his priorities in office. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LUIZ INACIO LULA DA SILVA, NEWLY ELECTED PRESIDENT OF BRAZIL (through translator): On October 30 the majority of Brazilians made it very clear that they want more and not less democracy. That they want more and not less social inclusion. That they want more and not less opportunities for all. They want more and not less respect and understanding among Brazilians. To summarize, they want more freedom, equality and fraternity in our country. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: The head of Brazil's electoral authority says he thinks Mr. Bolsonaro will accept the results, however videos posted on social media show apparent Bolsonaro supporters blocking highways in two states after his loss. 
 
CNN has exclusive new details about the assault on U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband. Our Veronica Miracle is following this story from San Francisco where the attack occurred inside the couple's home. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
VERONICA MIRACLE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Sources familiar with this incident say the suspect brought the hammer that was used in this attack in addition to the duct tape and the zip ties. We're also told by the district attorney's office that the suspect went upstairs into Paul Pelosi's bedroom where he was sleeping. Now, Paul Pelosi is still recovering in the hospital. He suffered a
 
 skull fracture and injuries to his hands and arm when he was hit with that hammer. It's without a doubt a difficult time for Speaker Pelosi who is now back in San Francisco. We did see her leave her residence. She ducked into her motorcade out of her garage and did not stop to talk to the media, but she did send a letter to her colleagues in the House of Representatives emphasizing the grief her family is experiencing right now. Saying our children, our grandchildren and I are heartbroken and traumatized by the life-threatening attack on our pop. 
 <br>[04:10:00]
 
Congressman Kevin McCarthy, the minority leader of the House, who is also a representative from California was on Fox News putting aside all differences and condemning the attack, expressing his support for the Pelosi family. 
 
REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): Let me be perfectly clear, violence or threat of violence has no place in our society. What happened to Paul Pelosi is wrong. Having heard it I reached out and called the Speaker. She was on a plane back for her husband so we were able to communicate by text. She said the surgery went well. I wanted to convey our thoughts and prayers with her and her family and with Paul and we hope for him a speedy recovery and we're able to stop this crime across our country. 
 
MIRACLE: The suspect David DePape is expected to be charged Monday with multiple felonies including attempted homicide, an assault with a deadly weapon and elder abuse among other charges. He is expected to be arraigned in court on Tuesday.

FOSTER: An investigation is underway after a deadly bridge collapse in India on Sunday. Rescue crews assisted by the Indian military are scrambling to find survivors. At least 134 people were killed when the foot bridge gave way, plunging dozens into the river below. Officials say the 19th century bridge had recently been renovated. CNN's Kristie Lu Stout is following the story and joins us live from Hong Kong. We've been looking at that horrendous video -- Kristie. 
 
KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: And, Max, the death toll continues to climb this day in India. This recently renovated suspension bridge collapsed in Sunday in the western India state Gujarat killing at least 134 people including children. 
 
Earlier today we heard from the home minister of Gujarat state. He said that the state have lodged a criminal complaint against the agency responsible for the maintenance of the bridge and that an investigation is under way. Authorities say that 200 people were on the bridge at the time of the collapse. It collapsed Sunday evening, 6:30 p.m. local time. You're looking at pictures that came up earlier of the search and recovery operation that is under way this day. Now I want to show you know disturbing and distressing video that has
 
 been circulating widely on social media showing the immediate aftermath of the bridge collapse. And if we could bring up this video for you, you'll see people trying to just hold on to the cables and the twisted wreckage of what remained of the bridge attempting to clamber up, to climb up the bridge to get to safer ground. Many did not make it. Others went into the river to try to swim ashore. A number of the victims are children. 
 
I want you to listen to what this eyewitness had to say. Unfortunately, we don't have that sound bite available for you. But according to that eyewitness, he said many children were there during the holidays Diwali and when they collapsed the bridge took place, all of them fell, quote, one on top of another, unquote. 
 
Now today, search and recovery teams are now combing the river to find the missing. We know that the bridge was a popular tourist destination. It was built during British rule in the 19th century. It had recently undergone months of renovation, only recently reopened to the public and we heard also earlier from the Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi who expressed deep sadness about this incident. He is, of course, from Gujarat. That's his home state. He has also offered compensation to those injured as well as the families of the victims. Back to you, Max. 
 
FOSTER: OK, Kristi, thank you. 
 
South Koreans are demanding answers from authorities after at least 154 people died in a crowd surge on Saturday. Many want to know why there was little crowd control during the Halloween celebrations in Seoul. The area was brimming with party goers making it hard to move or breathe. Many people fell over and were trampled by others around them. Some were so desperate to escape the trapped masses that they tried to climb over walls. It was so crowded. But by the time emergency crews got there, they struggled to reach people in need. Let's get more now from CNN's Ivan Watson in Seoul -- Ivan. 
 
IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Max, I'm at this makeshift memorial that's been erected right near basically what was ground zero where so many young people lost their lives Saturday night and the mood here is somber. People coming one by one, laying flowers, lighting candles, putting bottles of soju down after just a tragedy that I think is still sinking in in Korean society here for the sheer numbers of people who lost their lives. 
 
Now, we've been talking to survivors of what took place on Saturday night. And I'd like to introduce you to two French exchange students, Anne-Lou Chevalier and Alice Sannier Thank you for speaking with me again. And you were both here Saturday night, very close to where we're standing. 
 <br>[04:15:02]
 
And you were afraid for your lives for what you told me. 
 
ANNE-LOU CHEVALIER, SURVIVED CRUSH: Yes. WATSON: Why? 
 
CHEVALIER: Because there were like so many people who were pushing us. And like we cannot breathe at all for a moment. And a lot of people were trying to save others, but it was so difficult, like really. 
 
WATSON: And you were hurt. What happened to you? 
 
ALICE SANNIER, SURVIVED CRUSH: At some point I had no air. And we were so crushed to other people that I couldn't breathe at all, so I just passed out. 
 
WATSON: Unconscious. 
 
SANNIER: Yes, unconscious. 
 
WATSON: Then what happened to you? How did you escape? 
 
SANNIER: So, my friend told me that there were people around me that helped me to get out of the crowd. And they put me on the ground next to some security guard, next to a bar. And I stayed there and then I passed out again when the barriers start to come to me because there was too many crowds. So, the barriers couldn't hold them. Then I passed out again and then I don't know. 
 
WATSON: Both of you -- you're 18 years old. You're 22 years old. You've been in Seoul for some time now. Did you ever feel at risk going out at night as a young woman in the city before? 
 
CHEVALIER: No. It is like we are safe here. Like really night life in Seoul is really, really safe. It's like the first time that I -- so that's really -- 
 
WATSON: And one of the things I'm hearing is how confusing things were at night. That nobody could get real information. Is that a problem that you faced? 
 
CHEVALIER: No information like, no.
 
WATSON: Did you know that people were dying near where you were standing? 
 
CHEVALIER: No, no, no, no, no. 
 
SANNIER: No. 
 
CHEVALIER: Like we were just there. And we were just trying to save our life first. We were trying to help people but it was -- 
 
WATSON: And this wasn't quick. This took place over many minutes, right? 
 
CHEVALIER: A lot. 
 
SANNIER: Like 30 minutes, maybe 40 minutes. I don't remember because when you are in -- you don't have the notion of time at all. So, you just wait and try to look up to the sky to see that -- 
 
CHEVALIER: Get some air. 
 
SANNIER: Yes, and some air. And hope that you will get out alive. 
 
WATSON: Well, I'm so grateful and thankful that you guys are OK. Thank you for taking the time to speak with us about this. 
 
And Max, just trying to bring home what a surreal situation it was. So many thousands of people packed into tight alley ways that the death toll, 154 people killed. And just so you know, at least five of the victims were high school students here in Korea. One of them was a middle school student. The government has declared days of mourning. This is a special disaster area here with a large police presence. And an investigation has been declared, but a lot of questions being asked right now about how a city with the reputation for safety could have lost so many young lives on a Saturday night --Max. 
 
FOSTER: Ivan, thank you so much. As you say, the reality only really still setting in there in Seoul. Really shocked for that country and the world. 
 
Now more than two dozen foreign nationals in 14 countries were amongst those killed in Saturday's crush. U.S. President Joe Biden is expressing grief after learning two of them were American. 
 
He says he and the first lady are devastated and that their hearts go out to the victim's families. 
 
China's leader Xi Jinping says he was shocked to learn of the tragedy which also killed four Chinese nationals. He sent condolences to the president of South Korea, the victims and all the grieving families. 
 
Now affirmative action in college admissions is taking center stage at the U.S. Supreme Court later today. Ahead on CNN, why some say diversity on college campuses could be at stake. 
 
Plus, the committee investigating the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol has now obtained emails that could show the possible planning of a crime. We'll take a look at what they involve. 
 
And later, Russia is accused of using food as a weapon of war, after deciding to suspend its participation in a grain export deal. The details just ahead. 
 <br>[04:20:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: The January 6th committee has obtained eight emails showing the possible planning of a crime after the 2020 presidential election. A judge determined those emails show Donald Trump and his lawyers planned to defraud courts and obstruct the Congressional vote on the presidency. They appear to show Trump attorneys knew key details of their challenges were false and that filing lawsuits could delay the certification of Joe Biden's win. The committee have been fighting for those records for months. Trump attorney John Eastman is now seeking a court order to have the emails returned or destroyed. 
 
The seditious conspiracy trial of five Oath Keepers will resume in the coming hours. Proceedings were delayed last week after leader Steward Rhodes tested positive for coronavirus. He tested negative on Sunday. Before the break, prosecutors said they only needed a few more days until they rested their case. They'll resume calling witnesses this week. The charges are connected to the January 6th 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol. 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments on whether colleges and universities can continue to take race into consideration as a factor in admissions. It's a case that could potentially lower the number of black and Hispanic students in higher education. CNN's Jessica Schneider is following this high stakes, closely-watched battle. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: The Supreme Court will hear arguments in two cases involving UNC Chapel Hill and Harvard and a re-examine of affirmative action. 
 <br>[04:25:00]
 
This solidly conservative court could quite possible ban the use of race in admissions decisions at colleges and universities across the country despite the fact that they've allowed it since 1978. 
 
Over the past decade, Asian American and white students have sued to say they're being discriminated against in favor of black and minority students. Now, these cases have been moving up through the courts for years. And all of the lower courts have ruled against these students who have sued UNC and Harvard, saying that the Supreme Court has repeatedly allowed affirmative actions at universities. But that could potentially all change. 
 
In fact, there are nine states around the country that currently ban affirmative action in admissions decisions at their public universities. And in fact, "The Washington Post" did do a poll where 63 percent of the people polled said that affirmative action should go away. So, this is a high-stakes, high-interest case. 
 
What's interesting here is that two of the schools in those states that has actually banned affirmative action, University of California and the University of Michigan, they have argued against banning affirmative action because they say it's just not possible to get the diversity that campuses and schools need without using affirmative action. 
 
So, this case will be closely watched. The oral arguments will happen on Monday. And then at some point in the spring or early summer, this conservative court will decide potentially banning affirmative action nationwide. 
 
Jessica Schneider, CNN, Washington.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE) FOSTER: Respiratory illnesses like RSV are causing a spike in medical
 
 center admissions. U.S. pediatric hospitals have been swamped by patients in recent weeks. And doctors are worried that colder weather will boost a surge in respiratory illnesses. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DR. WILLIAM SCHAFFNER, VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER: We're having three respiratory viruses out there at the same time kind of revving up. The first is, of course, COVID. That's been with us for a while. Second, as you and Elizabeth just were saying, influenza has struck early, a month to six weeks early. And it is seemingly preferentially hitting children. 
 
And then there's this third virus that's been in the news, RSV -- respiratory sensational virus. It's a January, February virus. What's it doing here now? Well, it's here and it was spreading particularly among children and putting a strain on the beds and the emergency rooms in our children's hospitals. 
 
And of course, some of that particularly the RSV part is because we have taken off our masks. We're no longer social distancing. We're traveling. We're going to religious services. The children are back in school. And all of this provides an environment for these viruses to spread. Now, the good news is we have two vaccines against these three viruses. One against COVID, the other vaccine against flu. It's time for everyone to get both of those vaccines to provide the best protection for ourselves, our families and our communities. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
FOSTER: Now, when we return, the Federal Reserve could make news this week to tackle inflation, but it's raising concerns on Capitol Hill. 
 
Later, growing calls for Russia to renew its participation in a U.N. brokered grain export deal as concerns grow over its effect on the global food supply. The latest in a live report from Kyiv coming up.
