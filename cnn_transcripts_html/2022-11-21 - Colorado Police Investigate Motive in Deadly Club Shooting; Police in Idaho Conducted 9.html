MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR: Hello and warm welcome to our viewers joining us in the United States and all around the world I'm Max Foster in London. Bianca's off for the day. But just ahead on CNN NEWSROOM. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I was dancing. I heard shots. Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's really, really an act of unmitigated evil. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Two heroic people inside the club confront and fought with the suspect. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There are no suspects in custody. And we have not located a weapon. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We want justice. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The only people that need to be out there are public safety individuals, so stay off the roads. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Resources, people, equipment from all over the state of New York, we were able to avert many tragedies.

ANNOUNCER: Live from London, this is CNN NEWSROOM with Max Foster and Bianca Nobilo. 
 
FOSTER: Well, it is Monday, November 21st, 9:00 a.m. here in London, 2:00 a.m. in Colorado where investigators are still searching for a motive and piecing together why a 22-year-old suspect allegedly opened fire in an LBGTQ nightclub in the city of Colorado Springs over the weekend. The police chief says they're looking into whether it was a hate crime. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHIEF ADRIAN VASQUEZ, COLORADO SPRINGS POLICE DEPARTMENT: Detectives are also looking to identify if there were any other individuals who assisted the suspect. The motive of the crime is part of the investigation and whether this was a hate crime is part of that investigation.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
FOSTER: Well, police say the suspected shooter Anderson Lee Aldrich entered a club or Club Q as it's called late on Saturday and opened fire with a rifle, killing at least five people and injuring 25 others. And authorities say that number could have been much higher, had it not been for two people inside the club who confronted the shooter, fought with him and disarmed him. The club is calling their actions heroic and the mayor of Colorado Springs says he's grateful for their quick action. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOHN SUTHERS, MAYOR OF COLORADO SPRINGS: The call came into the police at 11:57 p.m. Police were on the scene by 12 -- an amazingly quick response. This incident was over by 12:02, and that's largely because of the intervention of at least one, possibly two, very heroic individuals who subdued this guy. Appears to have taken his handgun. He had a handgun with him. And used it to disable him. And so, did not shoot him, but to hit him with the gun and disable him. But for that, as tragic as this incident is, it's a horrible crime, it could have been much, much worse.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
FOSTER: The suspect survived and was being treated at hospital. Police say he was arrested in June of last year in connection to a bomb threat that led to a standoff at his mother's home, but no charges were filed in that case. The mayor of Colorado Springs tells CNN that 19 of the 25 people who were injured in the club shooting suffered gunshot wounds. And officials say some of them are in critical condition. CNN's Nadia Romero has more on the story. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NADIA ROMERO, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Another terrible update in this story. 25 people now injured. Overnight, that number was just 18. So, now at 25 injured, 5 people dead. We were told by authorities that number could continue to fluctuate. We know that not everyone was initially accounted for. Some people may have taken themselves to a hospital, some people may not have gone at all or reported their injuries. And that number of people dead stands at five right now, but that number could change sadly because we know there are people in the hospital right now in the intensive care units fighting for their lives. 
 
I want you to hear from two medical professionals as they discuss what it has taken to take care of these patients overnight and into the day hours. DR. BILL PLAUTH CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER, PENROSE HOSPITAL: We've taken
 
 care of seven members of our community, two remain in critical care but are in excellent hands. The other five patients mainly had extremity injuries and two have already been treated and released back to the community. And then the others have been to the hospital or still undergoing treatment. 
 
DR. DAVID STEINBRUNER, UCHEALTH MEMORIAL HOSPITAL: We do have patients in critical condition as well, but like anything else, it's a moving target. We have all of our physicians actively taking care of everybody as appropriate depending upon their injuries. 
 <br>[04:05:00]
 
ROMERO: Now police have yet to release any of the names of the victims or those people who were impacted, either injured or killed. They say they're still notifying family members, but we do know the name of the suspect, 22-year-old Anderson Lee Aldrich. Now police that say they recovered two guns in the nightclub that they believe he used a long rifle in the shooting. 
 
Now the district attorney in that area says they believe he acted alone, but as far as a motive, that's something that people are speculating about. You may see that on social media. Police right now say that they are looking into whether or not this was a hate crime, that this particular nightclub was targeted because it was an LBGTQ, a gay nightclub. Now, we know that the FBI is also investigating. That's one of the angles that they'll be looking into as well as we await more answers to many of the questions that still remain. 
 
Nadia Romero, CNN, Atlanta.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE) 
 
FOSTER: We're hearing from witnesses and members of the community that have been impacted by this tragic shooting. Here is how Joshua Thurman, who was inside the club when the shooting happened, describes the ordeal. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOSHUA THURMAN, CLUB Q PATRON AND SURVIVOR: This is our home. This is our space. We come here to just enjoy ourselves. And this happens? I lost friends. I was on the dance floor dancing when I heard four to five shots. I thought it was the music, so I kept dancing. Then I heard another set of shots. And then I -- me and a customer ran to the dressing room and got on the ground and locked the doors and called the police immediately. It was so scary. I heard shots, broken glass, bodies. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm sorry. 
 
THURMAN: It was -- how? Why? 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) FOSTER: CNN spoke with Joseph Shelton whose friend was injured in the shooting. He described Club Q is a place where everyone is free to express himself. And he had a message for homophobes. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOSEPH SHELDON, FRIEND SHOOTING VICTIM: My hopes is we come out strong from this, you know, we show the communities that don't want LGBT people to be out and about, we show them that we are here. We aren't going and hiding in a hole. We are staying strong and we are continuing to fight forward and we don't give up. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: Members of the community are paying tribute, leaving tokens of unity and love. The governor of Colorado has ordered flags at half- staff until Saturday. He called the shooting an act of evil. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JARED POLIS (D) COLORADO GOVERNOR: This was just a place of safety for people. It was a place where people could in a conservative community often get the acceptance that too many of them might not have had at home or in their other circles. And to see this occur has really put us in a state of shock across Colorado and across the country. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: President Joe Biden issued a statement offering prayers to the victims and families. And he condemned the increasing threats of violence against the LBGTQ community. 
 
He said, quote: Places that are supposed to be safe spaces of acceptance and celebration should never be turned into places of terror and violence. Yet it happens far too often. And he continued the quote saying: We must drive out the inequities that contribute to violence against LBGTQI+ people. We cannot and must not tolerate hate. 
 
Now a week on and police in Idaho are still searching for a suspect in the killing of four university students. They fielded more than 600 tips and conducted over 90 interviews, but so far, no answers. As CNN's Camila Bernal reports, the lack of progress is upsetting the community. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
CAMILA BERNAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It has been very frustrating because we are now getting specific answers from authorities in terms of the latest on this case. During the latest press conference, they did go into a few details about the 911 call that was placed on Sunday after the killings. They will not say exactly who made that 911 call, but what authorities are saying is that it was made on the phone of one of the surviving roommates. They say by the time police arrived there were other friends at the home when officers arrived to the scene. 
 
Now they also went over the time line in the latest press conference. A lot of the details that we knew in the sense that they're saying the two surviving roommates, they went out that night. They were back home at around 1:00 a.m. in the morning. They again mentioned Kaylee and Maddie going to a sports bar, then going to a food truck, getting a ride home and then getting home at around 2 in the morning. Xana and Ethan, also going out to a party that night, coming home also at around 2:00 a.m. in the morning. What police are saying, though, is that they have ruled certain people out who they don't believe are suspects in this case. 
 <br>[04:10:00]
 
Here is the captain overseeing this investigation. 
 
CAPT. ROGER LANIER, MOSCOW POLICE: We do not believe the following individuals are involved in this crime, the two surviving roommates, a male seen at the Grub Truck food vendor downtown specifically wearing a white hoodie, a private party who provided rides home to Kaylee and Madison in the early morning hours of November 13th. Currently there are no suspects in custody and we have not located a weapon. 
 
BERNAL: Now police also saying they know Kaylee and Maddie did make multiple phone calls to a man the night they were attacked. They're also saying they believe this man is not a suspect in this case. They've talked to about 90 people that may have some sort of knowledge into this case. They say they've gotten about 650 tips but they are still reviewing. They are now asking for the public's help in terms of tips, in terms of surveillance video and really any information that they have that may lead them to an arrest in this case.

FOSTER: New York's governor is praising local and state agencies for their preparation after a historic snowfall blanketed the region over the weekend. Nearly 80 inches of snow, around 200 centimeters fell across the state since Thursday. And the governor has requested an emergency declaration from FEMA and the White House. Meteorologist Britley Ritz joins me now from Atlanta with more on the winter weather as well as conditions heading into the Thanksgiving holiday. 
 
BRITLEY RITZ, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Absolutely, Max. We are talking about 80 inches of snow, specifically at Orchard Park in New York with the lake-effect snow that ran over Ontario as well as Lake Erie. For Buffalo, over three-daytime span we picked up 36.9 inches. And that's the second snowiest three-day period for the month of November. Now, a daily record was set on Saturday picking up 21.5 inches, previous record was set back in 2014 at 7.5 inches roughly. 
 
So, there it is. This is what causes the lake-effect snow. We get that wind to set upcoming right off of the lake so that cold air rushes over the warmer waters that forces the warmer air up, it cools and condenses and then falls in the form of snow. Thankfully the winds are starting to switch directions. So, they're pulling more out of the southwest, but they will pick up speed at 40 to 45 miles per hour near Buffalo and Watertown later this afternoon and throughout the upcoming day. 
 
So, blowing snow going to be an issue, not just falling from the sky. So, from Watertown to Rochester, back into Buffalo, we do have wind advisories in effect. We have the lake-effect snow warnings and winter weather advisories now expired because the winds have shifted. And as that high moves in, the winds will continue to shift more out of the south, so we won't have to worry about the snow. 
 
Now, we still have to deal with a few scattered snow showers here this morning. Some of the heavier snow bands lifting up further north now where we're picking roughly three inches an hour, where you're seeing the darker grays and the purples. But here like I mentioned, there's very scattered shower activity here in the upcoming days as we roll into Thanksgiving. So, an additional one to two inches of snow expected. 
 
But that system that rolls through, of course, cools us down, but eventually trying to warm it back up here in the upcoming week. Expect temperatures on Thanksgiving in the 30s around the Great Lakes and northeast back through the Ohio Valley in the 40s and 50s down through the south. Well, our next cold front trying to work its way through increasing our rain chances from Texas back on up into places like Atlanta and even into the Carolinas -- Max. 
 
OK, Britley, thank you very much indeed. We'll be watching now. 
 
In a surprise move, bob Iger is returning to run Disney and the current CEO Bob Chapek is stepping down immediately. No reason was given but Chapek's management is being criticized of late with Disney's stock more than 40 percent down this year. Disney says Iger will serve as CEO for just two years to help turn things around and ultimately help choose his successor as well. Iger previously led the company for 15 years and oversaw the acquisitions of Pixar, Marvel and Lucas Film which brought the "Star Wars" franchise to Disney and seen as a big success. 
 
Superstar Kyrie Irving is back on the basketball court. What he had to say and how he performed after the eight-game absence. 
 
After an eight-year absence, the U.S. is about to make its return to the World Cup. But how will they fair against Hungary? A Hungary Wales team? Will go live to Doha for the first full day of competition. 
 
Plus, the January 6th committee investigating the Capitol riot, plans to release its final report soon. Here what one committee member is saying about it.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
FOSTER: It's fun to hear the FIFA World Cup is under way in Qatar. And the hours ahead we'll see a full day of action with three games in the schedule. First, the 2018 semifinalist England will face off against Iran. Then the African champion Senegal will take on the Netherlands. And later the U.S. and Wales will both make their return to the World Cup on the last match of the day. Ahead of that contest, the Americans received a call from their supporter in chief, President Joe Biden. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It says POTUS, that's where it's coming from. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I have the U.S. men's national soccer team. 
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Coach, put me in, I'm ready to play. You guys, I know you're the underdog, but I tell you what, man, you have some of the best players in the world on your team. And you're representing this country. I know you're going to play your hearts out, so let's go shock 'em all.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
FOSTER: Amanda Davies in Doha for us. Well, America hasn't played in the tournament in a while but I don't think Wales has played in more than 60 years. So, it really is the match of the underdogs. 
 
AMANDA DAVIES, CNN WORLD SPORT: Yes, it is, Max. 
 <br>[04:20:00]
 
But you know, with the U.S. having the youngest squad in this tournament, perhaps they should take 80-year-old Joe Biden up on his offer to add a little experience to this team. They got that phone call at the same time over the weekend as they were receiving messages of support from families back at home. And of course, they had those massive Ted Lasso billboards, the players in their hometowns cheering them on as you mentioned their first World Cup appearance in eight years having missed out on that tournament in Russia in 2018. 
 
It's a young, experienced but really, really talented U.S. team. There's players like Christian Pulisic and Tyler Adams, Weston McKennie, who play in Europe but really don't have this experience on the world stage. Their manager Gregg Berhalter says, though, on their day, they can beat anybody because this is really the start of a building process to when they're going to be co-hosts in 2026 with the Mexico and Canada. 
 
As you mentioned, they're up against the Wales team for whom this tournament is a massive, massive occasion. Their first World Cup since 1958. They're actually the longest gap of any team between their first and second appearance at a World Cup finals. The Welsh fans have been arriving in their numbers over the last couple of days. Gareth Bale, of course, leading the way for them. Their veteran captain who a lot of the U.S. players know very well because he's made an impact with LAFC helping them win the MLS cup final just a couple weeks ago -- Max. 
 
FOSTER: And how did the hosts do in their opening match yesterday? 
 
DAVIES: I have to say, it wasn't an occasion that did much to calm the criticism from the naysayers of this tournament. It was a spectacular opening ceremony at Al Bayt Stadium, complete with the star power of Morgan Freeman and that message of hope and respect and unity. But when it came to the football and the atmosphere, well, it was
 
 really quite bizarre for a World Cup opener. Yes, you had the Ecuador fans bringing their usual yellow wall and chorus of chants. Then they were opposed by a really well orchestrated group of Qatari fans with their songs, with their chants, who we'd actually seen practicing when we were here in April for one of the games. 
 
But that group was in stark contrast to the majority of the Qatari fans watching in a much more moderated stoic fashion. And when it came to the second half, a lot of them decided not to stick around. They had seen enough of the football because it really wasn't very inspiring from the hosts. This was their big moment on the world stage, a first-ever World Cup finals match with the eyes of the world watching. It really didn't go to plan. Their coach Felix Sanchez -- I think understatement of the year -- said there's room for improvement. But remember, Max, this is the day that this tournament was meant to start. Let's hope that with the matches on the agenda that will be the case. 
 
FOSTER: OK. Amanda, thank you. Busy day ahead. 
 
Now, one of the artists behind the World Cup theme song walked out of an interview in Qatar after being grilled about the host country's poor human rights record. Columbian singer Maluma was asked where he stood on Qatar's violations especially considering that other artists refused to participate in the World Cup because of the abuses. Here is how he reacted. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Maluma, don't you have problem with human rights violation on this country? 
 
MALUMA, COLOMBIAN SINGER: Yes, but it's something that I can't resolve. I just came here to enjoy life, enjoy soccer. The party of soccer is not actually something that I have to be involved with. I'm here enjoying my music. And beautiful life playing soccer, too. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But can you understand just people going to say that by the very presence of you here, you're helping whitewashing the -- 
 
MALUMA: Do I have to answer that question? OK, but just I think that people are going to ask. What the problem? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What's the problem, I mean, I'm rude? Why am I rude? Maluma? I think this is what people say. This is what people think. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
FOSTER: The controversy continues after that interview the singer went on to perform at a FIFA fan festival in Qatar's capital. 
 
Basketball superstar Kyrie Irving returned from an eight game suspension on Sunday. Irving was suspended after he tweeted a link to a documentary contained antisemitic messages and initially refused to apologize. He's issued multiple apologies since then and says he's happy to be back.

KYRIE IRVING, BROOKLYN NETS POINT GUARD: Felt good. Felt good. Just miss my teammates, miss the coaching staff, you know, just getting prepared with them in the morning or in the rising and then carrying over to the game. Felt good.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
FOSTER: Irving scored 14 points and grabbed 5 rebounds as his Brooklyn Nets defeated the Memphis Grizzlies. 
 
Ahead on CNN, we're learning new details about the January 6th investigation including when the final report will be made public. 
 
Plus, Republican Kevin McCarthy is promising to remove some Democrats from their committee's if he becomes the new House Speaker. You're watching CNN NEWSROOM.

FOSTER: Welcome back to CNN NEWSROOM I'm Max Foster. You're watching CNN NEWSROOM. And these are the top stories this hour. 
 
Authorities are still searching for the motive in this weekend's shooting at an LBGTQ nightclub in Colorado Springs, Colorado. At least five people are dead and 25 others injured after gunman opened fire before being stopped by at least two people in the club. 
 
And in Idaho, officials still have no suspect or murder weapon in the murder of four university of Idaho students. The FBI is assisting in that investigation. 
 
Now, we're following new reaction to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland's decision to appoint a special counsel to weigh potential charges against Donald Trump in two federal investigation. House intelligence committee chair Adam Schiff is hitting back at the former president's suggestion that the move was politically motivated. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They're still going to say it's political. 
 
REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): They're still going to say it, but it's the right thing to do. And most particularly, if you ensure that it won't cause any delay. So, if the same prosecutors that had been investigating the former president and others can be moved on to the special prosecutor's team, then there's every reason to do it, no reason not to do it. And I think the personal he's chosen seems to be capable and qualified.
