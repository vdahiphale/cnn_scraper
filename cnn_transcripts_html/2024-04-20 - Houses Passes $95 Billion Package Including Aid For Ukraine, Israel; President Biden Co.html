WALSH: -- how elephants remotely pose a threat, but how this story is a stark visual way of explaining how crowded this planet has become and the perilous decades we have ahead -- Fredricka. 
 
WHITFIELD: Very extraordinary. Can't wait to see that, Nick Paton Walsh. Thank you so much. 
 
And be sure to tune in to an all-new episode of "THE WHOLE STORY WITH ANDERSON COOPER," one whole hour, one whole topic airs tomorrow at 8:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific only on CNN. 
 
Thank you so much for joining me today on a very busy Saturday. I'm Fredricka Whitfield. The CNN NEWSROOM with Alex Marquardt starts right now. 
 
ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN ANCHOR: You are in the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Alex Marquardt in Washington. Thank you so much for joining us. 
 
We begin with breaking news on Capitol Hill. After months of delays and political turmoil, in a rare Saturday vote, House lawmakers passed a $95 billion package of aid for Ukraine, for Israel and Taiwan. Now the deal heads to the Senate for a vote before it can be signed by President Joe Biden. 
 
We have reporters across Washington as well as in Kyiv and in Jerusalem. Let's start with CNN's Lauren Fox on Capitol Hill to help break it all down. 
 
Lauren, what is the latest? 
 
LAUREN FOX, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, obviously this vote a long time coming, Alex, and there has been a lot of questions about whether or not Speaker Mike Johnson was ever going to get to this point, putting this Ukraine aid package as well as additional aid for Israel and Taiwan on the floor of the House of Representatives. And the reason for that, of course, was because of these threats coming from conservatives against his job. 
 
The question of whether or not he could continue to serve as the speaker of the House and get aid to the U.S.' allies across the world. The main concern coming from people like Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene was additional funding for Ukraine, but you are hearing despite the fact that conservatives are frustrated, they are mad at the speaker, they are questioning whether or not he deserves to be in this job, you are still hearing from defense hawks like Representative Mike McCaul, like Representative Don Bacon, who are applauding the speaker's efforts. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. MIKE MCCAUL (R-TX): He showed true leadership by what he did today, took what he gets in the face of the opposition but he knows that if we didn't do this, the consequences would have been severe not just for the United States, but for the free world. 
 
REP. DON BACON (R-NE): We need to stop Russia, and when we need to support our ally, Israel. So I think he did everything he could to try to get all three done. Like I said, you don't want to have one failure, I mean, the other two things fail as well. I think that's what we got. I've always been a -- Mike's a friend. He's a man of character. He's honest. He's always said he's for Ukraine, and I've always believed him. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOX: And of course, it wasn't just Republicans who are applauding the speaker. I talked to one Democrat, Representative Mike Quigley, when I asked him whether his view of the speaker has changed over the course of the last several weeks he kind of paused for a minute, he said I guess it has. I guess what happened today I wasn't sure was ever going to happen, but obviously there was bipartisan support for that package. 
 
It now heads to the United States Senate. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announcing just a few two minutes ago, Alex, that a key vote will begin in the Senate on Tuesday. We still are not sure when the final passage of this package would come together, but it does say a lot because the Senate was supposed to be in recess next week. They're returning to Washington because they view this as so needed, so immediately important that they want to take action as soon as possible -- Alex. 
 
MARQUARDT: Yes, the Senate very eager to pass this. 
 
Lauren, before I let you go, speaking of the Senate, they passed a bill late on Friday to reauthorize the FISA Warrantless Surveillance Program. That's despite bipartisan concerns and after hours of intense and acrimonious debates. So what helped push it through? 
 
FOX: Yes, I think there was just a resounding view from so many folks that this needed to pass before the deadline which happened last night at midnight. So there was sort of this last-minute ditch effort where they were able to put together a package, passed it on the floor, gives some votes, gives some amendment votes to those who wanted them, and move this forward. 
 
But we should just note, this is another moment where Speaker Mike Johnson and really worked with Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to pass this through his own chamber, frustrating and outraging those on his right flank once again so there's a lot of bills that Mike Johnson has done over the course of the last several weeks that have angered his right flank. That's something to keep an eye on when lawmakers return, not next week in the House, but the week after -- Alex. 
 
MARQUARDT: All right. Lauren Fox, up on Capitol Hill on a very big day. Thanks very much. 
 
President Joe Biden is saying that the House's passage of the foreign aid bill sends what he calls a clear message about the power of America's leadership to the world. 
 
White House correspondent Priscilla Alvarez is with me here in the studio. 
 <br>[16:05:01]
 
So, Priscilla, what else are we hearing from the president? 
 
PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, there's no doubt, Alex, that this is a significant moment for the White House and a win for them after months of wrangling for this aid. Now the president applauding this in a statement this afternoon saying, quote, "Today members of both parties in the House voted to advance our national security interests and send a clear message about the power of American leadership on the world stage. At this critical inflection point, they came together to answer history's call. passing urgently needed national security legislation that I have fought for months to secure." 
 
And then he goes on to say the Senate needs to quickly send this to his desk. Now, of course, to remind viewers, this was something the president asked for last October, and he actually addressed the nation, making the point that it wasn't just about providing help to an ally abroad but also that this was in the national security interests for the United States and important not to cede any ground to Russia. 
 
And that has been the drumbeat from U.S. officials, including, as we saw some losses on the battlefield in Ukraine where U.S. officials put that squarely at the feet of Republicans in Congress saying that not sending that aid to Ukraine was resulting in some of these losses. So clearly this has been urgent. It has been necessary. 
 
We also got that stark warning from the CIA Director Burns this week where he said Ukraine could lose the war by the end of the year if they didn't get the funding. Well, now the president is applauding that they can. Of course, White House officials were in touch with members of Congress and their staff over the course of the last few days, especially today on Saturday. We're expecting to see what happens next in the Senate. But clearly a win for the White House, which has been asking for this aid for months. 
 
MARQUARDT: Yes, top intelligence and military officials, to your point, they have been essentially begging lawmakers to get Ukraine this aid, which is so desperately needed. Priscilla Alvarez, great to have you in studio. Thanks very much. 
 
Now to Ukraine where the months-long delay in passing this American aid is being blamed for some recent Ukrainian losses and Russian gains on the battlefield. Following the vote, Ukraine's President Zelenskyy posted a thank you message to the U.S. for its support. 
 
We find our senior international correspondent Fred Pleitgen in Kyiv right now. 
 
Fred, great to have you there. We've got this thank you from Presidents Zelenskyy. It must be a huge feeling of relief where you are. 
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, it absolutely is. And you could feel that really reverberate around the city, around Kyiv, and really around the entire country. And also, Alex, you mentioned there that thank you tweet essentially by Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the president of that country, that came out only a couple of seconds after the House vote went down. 
 
So clearly, the Ukrainians were waiting for this and were hoping for this, and some of the things that Priscilla mentioned, obviously for the Ukrainians have been really real issues that they've been having. The lack of ammunition as far as artillery is concerned, also air defense systems and air defense missiles as well. 
 
One of the things of course, Alex, that we've been talking about over the past couple of weeks and that you've been reporting about out as well, is the fact that the Russians have launched this massive aerial campaign against Ukraine's energy infrastructure. And the Ukrainians are saying, look, in some cases, we simply don't have the air defense missiles to hold that up. So it's a big deal for them. 
 
We've actually been in touch with a couple of troops who are on the frontlines fighting there. There was one of them who said that they had essentially felt they would have been forgotten by the United States. And now they realize that that's not the case. Another one was also saying that this aid, which they hope will come soon, also motivates a troops who are fighting on the frontlines, hoping that they can turn things around. 
 
The president of this country, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, again, he came out and he says once again this shows the leadership of the United States. 
 
I want to listen in to some of what he had to say. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
PRES. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINE (through translator): We appreciate every manifestation of support for our state and independence, our people and our lives, which Russia wants to bury in ruins. America has shown its leadership from the first days of this war. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) PLEITGEN: So you have Volodymyr Zelenskyy speaking really only moments after the vote in the House happened. Of course we do have to always remind viewers that right now the situation I would say it's still in a stalemate. It is certainly one were the Russians have the initiative and the momentum at this point in time. They've been pushing the Ukrainians back in some areas. 
 
The Russians also, Alex, have really found ways to use their air force a lot more effectively than they did in the early days of the war. That's one of the reasons why the Ukrainians keep calling for those air defense systems. And while they understand they might not be able to turn things around immediately with this aid, they do say that it will help them at least stabilize the situation going forward. 
 
I also want to read you what we got from the foreign minister of this country because these were comments made directly to CNN. He said, quote, "Enabling Ukraine to push back Russian aggression is equal to preventing a larger war in Europe and averting the risk of all wannabe aggressors plunging our world into chaos. I sincerely thank the U.S. House of Representatives," Alex. 
 
MARQUARDT: Yes. So important, Fred, as you say, not just materially but psychologically for those troops who have been struggling on the frontlines against Russian forces. 
 
Fred Pleitgen in the Ukrainian capital. Thanks very much. 
 
Now to Israel, where the House actions today sets up $26 billion in U.S. aid with some strings. 
 <br>[16:10:06]
 
CNN senior diplomatic editor Nic Robertson is in Jerusalem. 
 
Nic, what are you hearing there in terms of reaction? 
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Yes. As you can imagine there has been a lot of thanks for the United States, a lot of thanks for Speaker Johnson, a lot of thanks for House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries. What we heard from President Hertzog, he said this shows that Israel has no stronger ally than the United States. 
 
The prime minister here, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying that this shows by-parties and support for Israel, which is quite an important thing for him to be saying, to be pointing out the bipartisan nature of it, of course, because there's been a sense that the way Prime Minister Netanyahu has been fighting the war in Gaza, high number of Palestinian casualties there, more than 34,000 people dead, this has alienated some Democrats. 
 
So it's quite -- it's important I think to understand part of what he is saying that this is we Israel, my administration is getting this bipartisan support. The defense minister, you know, and the points are important to him. He said, look, we face seven enemies right now, seven different enemies. This shows the strength of the relationship between the United States and Israel. We heard from the foreign minister as well talking about the strength of the ties, the strategic partnership between the two countries. 
 
And an important comments as well I think coming from the speaker at the Knesset who said, look, this is a message to all the enemies of Israel that the United States and Israel stand strong together. And why is that an important thing to say right now? Because there's an assessment here that Iran believed that it could have that massive attack just last weekend on Israel, more than 350 drones cruise and ballistic missiles fired into Israel or at Israel last Saturday night into Sunday, because they thought that the United States was not as strongly behind Prime Minister Netanyahu's government and behind Israel, and perhaps there was a small fracture there that they could exploit. 
 
So the message from the speaker of the Knesset very clearly and in essence, what we hear from the other leaders that this strength of support, it's not just giving us the military equipment that we need to fight this fight, that the Iron Dome, David slaying the arrow, all these missile intercept systems that was so performed at such a high level and so successfully last weekend, it's the messaging. 
 
It's the messaging that whatever is happening in Gaza, whatever the political disquieting in United States is about that, and with other allies around the world, the United States is still standing and committed to arming Israel to fight its enemies. 
 
MARQUARDT: And Nic, we can't forget, of course, about the West Bank as well, where there has been a lot of violence lately. Again today, a Palestinian ambulance driver killed while trying to evacuate wounded during a raid by Israeli settlers. What more do you know? 
 
ROBERTSON: Yes, this is something that Palestinian officials are saying that the ambulance crew had tried to drive in to get people who were injured by settlers, and we saw just last weekend thousands of settlers encroaching and going into Palestinian villages. They were on a rampage that weekend because one of their community, a young shepherd, 14 years old, had been found dead. 
 
They blame the Palestinians in a nearby town. And we're seeing shades of that violence again this weekend, and here the crew, the ambulance crew were trying to get to injured Palestinians, the driver was shot, other members of the ambulance crew came under gunfire in the ambulance. And it's not the only thing going on in the West Bank. The IDF has had a days-long raid now into Tulkarem Refugee Camp inside the occupied West Bank. 
 
There, the IDF says they've killed 10 terrorists, arrested eight suspects. Palestinian officials say that five other people have been killed including one child. So very bloody and violent times in several places in the West Bank in the past 24 hours. 
 
MARQUARDT: And clearly this is a major concern of the Biden administration. They just put new sanctions on two groups linked to extremist settlers and one settler, expanding their sanctions there in the West Bank. 
 
Nic Robertson in Jerusalem, thank you very much for that reporting. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and the State Department are not
 
 losing sight of keeping relations with China. Today, we just learned that Secretary Blinken will be traveling to China very soon this week in fact. It will be his second trip there in the last year after his visit last summer. This time he's set to meet with senior officials in both Shanghai and Beijing. He plans to voice concerns about China's support of Russia's military industrial complex, as well as human rights abuses and economic practices.

In two days, opening statements are going to be beginning in a historic trial as the former president Donald Trump becomes the first former president to face a criminal trial. What we can expect from prosecutors and Trump's legal team on day one, that's ahead in the CNN NEWSROOM. Stay with us. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[16:20:02]
 
MARQUARDT: Opening statements in the first ever criminal trial of a former president are set to begin on Monday. Donald Trump will return to a Manhattan courtroom as prosecutors present their arguments in the New York hush money case. But before they can begin, Trump is hitting the campaign trail, holding a rally in North Carolina later today. This comes after a dramatic final day of jury selection. But a process that was expected to take weeks was over in just days after the judge yesterday swore in 12 jurors as well as six alternates. 
 
Let's discuss all this with CNN contributor and former Nixon White House counsel John Dean. 
 
John, thank you so much for being with us. Big picture, a jury was just seated for the first ever criminal trial of a former U.S. president. You of course know a thing or two about big political moment. So what do you make of this moment ahead of those opening statements on Monday? 
 
JOHN DEAN, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: There's going to be a lot of focus on trial worldwide because it is a unique situation. And the government is going to lay out its case. As you said, there'll be opening statements and the government will paint a picture of behavior that it thinks is criminal. So that's what Mr. Trump is in for, and the world is waiting to hear that story because while we think we know it the prosecutors will have facts we don't know. 
 
MARQUARDT: And John, so much focus also on the jurors who will have the fate of the former president in their hands. We now have the final jury is seated, but there are also two potential jurors who were excused yesterday after telling the judge that the trial was too stressful, one even began crying in the courtroom. So how high are the stakes for these men and women on the jury? 
 
DEAN: I think they realized the hype and the focus on this jury is because they know they're going to be anonymous and the courtroom is empty except for the jury. The press is really not covering it other than through an outside room with television cameras, that closed circuit show the proceedings. So they sense something is unusual. And then they of course see the former president of the United States sitting there and know that, you know, this is a very savvy jury pool and jury that emerged because New York is well-educated and a fairly attentive to these kinds of events and knows the significance of what's going on. 
 
MARQUARDT: In addition to those 12, we have these six alternates, but given how high profile and high stakes this trial is, do you think that six is enough? 
 
DEAN: Good question. I think this weekend will tell us if there's a problem with those that were seated already. Obviously, they'll come in and tell the judge they have a problem or they think they've been identified. You know, it's very unusual to have an anonymous jury. That happened during Watergate, at some of the big trials, they were sequestered juries that were really anonymous and remained anonymous for decades. Only a few who wanted to be identified ever came forward. 
 
So it is a it is a new tension for them. They are a group strangers that are getting together to make a very big decision. So it's got to be certain stress levels that they're not used to. 
 
MARQUARDT: And certainly there are going to be plenty of people who are trying to uncover their identities. And John, prosecutors have refused to reveal the witness list with the defense and they're citing Trump's previous tweets about witnesses. Judge Merchan says that he won't be forcing them to hand it over. Do you think the judge made the right move? 
 
DEAN: I think he did. He was sending a message in that move that indeed he agreed that Mr. Trump could have used the information so they've withheld until very late on Sunday night. They're apparently going to give the first witness that the government is going to call. But the protocol and the courtesy is normally to provide who your first three or six witnesses might be, so that the defense can prepare and be ready for cross-examination. 
 
Because of Trump's tweets, because his effort to influence the proceedings through out-of-court statements, you know, he has put them as potential targets, so they want to be very careful and the government is exercising its right not to be courteous because Trump is not paying that favor back. 
 
MARQUARDT: There is this major question hanging over all this, whether the former president will take the stand. If you were advising him, would you tell him to? 
 
DEAN: It's very unusual for a defendant to take the stand because particularly in a situation like Donald Trump where he is known to be a terrible witness. His depositions are bad. His few court appearances have been disastrous. 
 <br>[16:25:00] It would just be almost inconceivable that he do so and very high theater should he choose to, somewhat suicidal actually, because it opens him up to cross-examination on everything relating to his character and truthfulness. And we know he's pretty vulnerable in that area. 
 
MARQUARDT: Well, one thing is certain it is going to be a remarkable and historic week. 
 
John Dean, thanks so much for your thoughts today. 
 
DEAN: Thanks, Alex. 
 
MARQUARDT: Nearly $100 billion in foreign aid now on its way to the Senate after the House passed a package of bills, despite pushback from hardline Republicans. Ahead, we'll be speaking with Democratic Congressman Gerry Connelly about the contentious lead-up to these votes and the importance of supporting U.S. allies. 
 
You're in the CNN NEWSROOM. Stay with us. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[16:30:11]
 
MARQUARDT: We are following a busy day on Capitol Hill. Billions of dollars of foreign aid for Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan now officially approved by House lawmakers. Those bills are now heading to the Senate where they are expected to pass later next week. 
 
Now, earlier, Speaker Mike Johnson took a victory lap, saying this was the right thing to do. But after today, his job may be more at risk than ever. 
 
Let's discuss this with Democratic Congressman Gerry Connolly, a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. 
 
Congressman, thank you so much for joining us today on such a big day. 
 
REP. GERRY CONNOLLY (D-VA): Thank you.
 
MARQUARDT: The House has now just voted for essentially the foreign aid parts of that Senate bill that passed back in February, which you supported. Are you frustrated at how long this has taken the House or how are you feeling now that this has passed?
 
CONNOLLY: Yes, I am. This could've been done months ago. And when you realize what's happening on the -- on the Ukrainian front, thousands of Ukrainian casualties have occurred that might have been averted had we not dithered.
 
The same vote we had today, we could have had months ago. So I think it's really tragic that the Congress and the speaker took so long to finally come around to basically ratifying what the Senate did months ago back in February, by a 78-29 vote in the Senate. MARQUARDT: In terms of the consequences that you just touched on, you've also been quite vocal about the war in Gaza, saying the death toll is way too high.
 
In terms of this new aid for Israel, would you have wanted to see more conditions attached? 
 
CONNOLLY: Yes. I believe that none of the aid provided in today's vote should be used for any offensive operations in Gaza until the hostages are released, massive humanitarian aid flows into Gaza, and an understanding about what, if any, operations would be commenced with respect to Rafah.
 
We have a humanitarian crisis of unprecedented proportions. That has to be addressed first.
 
MARQUARDT: And my understanding is there -- there are very few conditions in this. Is that right?
 
CONNOLLY: That's right. Those conditions are going to have to be negotiated between the Biden -- the Biden White House, the State Department and the Israeli government. 
 
MARQUARDT: And the administration has -- has repeatedly said that they will likely not condition that aid.
 
Congressman, you told our colleague, Manu Raju, earlier today, that Democrats should not save Congressman Mike Johnson as speaker. How do you see his fate after today's votes? 
 
CONNOLLY: I feel the same. A lot of my colleagues in the Democratic caucus feel that somehow we're beholden to Speaker Mike Johnson because of today's vote, a vote that could have taken place months ago and should have.
 
My view is different. My view is, finally, Speaker Johnson did what a speaker is supposed to do, which is allow legislation to come to the floor and let the will of the House be exercised. 
 
We were telling him and others, months ago, that there were well over 300 votes for Ukraine in the House if you'd just let it come to a vote. Well, that's exactly what we got today.
 
And so I don't think we owe Speaker Johnson anything. And as Democrats, frankly, his views on gay rights, gun-rights, women's reproductive rights, voting rights are at -- and of course, the certification of the election of Joe Biden, are antithetical to everything we hold dear as Democrats. 
 
Why would we want to preserve him in the speaker's chair? And frankly, I want to vote for Hakeem Jeffries. That's my candidate for speaker, not Michael Johnson.
 
MARQUARDT: As frustrated as you may be that this could have been done months ago, do you see today is a win for Democrats? Because the Senate bill -- in the Senate, Democrats were essentially forced to add on a section that was on the border and border security, which -- which was struck down today. It didn't pass. 
 
So the fact that the three sections that Democrats were really trying to push through, do you see that as a win for Democrats? 
 
CONNOLLY: Well, I guess I wouldn't frame it that way. I think this is a real win for the country. 
 
This is the Congress finally, you know, rededicating itself to the proposition that the United States is a beacon of hope for all freedom- loving people, especially Ukrainians right now. And we finally reaffirmed that commitment today. 
 <br>[16:35:08]
 
I also think it's a big win, frankly, for President Biden. Essentially, a Republican majority-controlled Congress in the House ratified his initial request for aid to Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan, and humanitarian aid for Gaza.
 
That's a big victory, foreign policy victory for Joe Biden. And he deserves a lot of credit.
 
MARQUARDT: All right, Democratic Congressman Gerry Connolly, thank you very much for joining us today.
 
CONNOLLY: My pleasure. 
 
MARQUARDT: As the U.S. prepares to shift more aid towards Israel, Washington is working to prepare for what could be a new equation in the region as tensions remain high between Iran and Israel.
 
You're in the CNN NEWSROOM.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[16:40:31]
 
MARQUARDT: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has thanked the House of Representatives for passing a crucial aid package, which includes some $26 billion for his country. 
 
The Israeli foreign minister says that Israel faces threats from seven fronts, including from Iran. 
 
Simmering tensions between Israel and Iran added to the growing urgency to get the bills push through after an exchange of strikes between the countries this month has spiked fears of a widening regional conflict. 
 
Joining us now is Norman Roule. He's a former senior U.S. intelligence official. 
 
Norm, thanks so much for being with us, as you have been throughout so much of what we've seen in the past week.
 
Given what we now know about the limited scope of Israel's counter- strike early on Friday morning Iran time, what do you expect in terms of an Iranian response?
 
NORMAN ROULE, FORMER SENIOR U.S. INTELLIGENCE OFFICIAL: Good afternoon. I think we've seen the Iranian response rollout in some detail. First, they will recognize within their military that their most sophisticated air defense system was not able to prevent an Israeli strike.
 
This will cause a strategic discussion within the Iran Revolutionary Guard as they think about, can they protect their key installations and personnel?
 
Indeed, I should note that the next generation of the system that was reportedly destroyed in Isfahan was destroyed and in -- by Ukraine in Crimea yesterday.
 
Which more broadly speaks of the superiority of U.S. technology worked by the U.S. with its partners, and the inferiority of Iranian technology, even when obtaining the best from Russia. 
 
I think that's a significant restraint on Iran in general.
 
MARQUARDT: Just before the strike by Israel against Isfahan Thursday night, our time, Friday morning in Iran, the Iranian foreign minister had told CNN that if Israel were to strike, they would respond to immediately and with maximum effect. That clearly has not happened.
 
So how keen do you think Iran is to lower the temperature now?
 
ROULE: Well, Iran is famous for its bluster and its harsh rhetoric. The foreign minister is not a significant actor in Iran decision- making circle. And he certainly would not be a dominant voice in the discussions to how much strategic risks Russia -- Iran would take on. 
 
I think you've also seen a great success of U.S. diplomacy, where the United States and its partners put diplomatic pressure on Israel and Iran to restrain themselves and to prevent this from becoming a broader conflict. 
 
I think Iran is responding to this pressure as well because it does want to maintain engagement with Europe, Asia, and regional actors.
 
MARQUARDT: In terms of that decision-making circle that you just mentioned, my colleague, Katie Bo Lillis, and I have just written about how last weekend's strike by Iran against Israel has essentially upended years of intelligence assumptions, analysis about Iran's appetite for confrontation. 
 
If you were still in the intelligence community, advising policymakers, how much would the events of the past few days change your view of the Iranian supreme leader and the Revolutionary Guard and what they're willing to do?
 
ROULE: I think the last few weeks has shown that the concept of deterrence against Iran has eroded significantly. And that Iran is responding accordingly. We should keep in mind that Iran has undertaken one of the largest
 
 military actions the region is seen in decades. And has effectively paid no international price for this. 
 
Its nuclear program is at an all-time high. It conducts hostage taking, assassination attempts. So I think, more broadly, this does speak to the challenge of deterrence against Iran. 
 
And when met deterrence is absent, Iran tests red lines.
 
MARQUARDT: But you do have these new sanctions that were rolled out by the U.S., the U.K., and the E.U. late last week, late this week.
 
To what extent do you think that those are going to hurt Iran?
 
ROULE: While the sanctions will certainly underscore to the international community that businesses dealing with Iran are putting a fair amount of their capital at great risk. 
 
Iran is a terrorist sponsor, aggressive actor, a depressive actor to its own people, et cetera, et cetera. This -- this isn't a good place to put your money. And the sanctions have just underscored that.
 
This said, these sanctions do not directly touch the supreme leader or his innermost circle. And these sanctions do not appear to immediately erode Iran's capability.
 <br>[16:45:06] 
 
MARQUARDT: Yes, there were primarily directed at the drone program after there were more than 100 drones that were launched at Israel last weekend.
 
Norman Roule, we have to leave it there. Thanks as always for your time and your perspective. 
 
More protests happening today on the campus of Columbia University in New York as hundreds descend on the university to either protest for or against Israel's war in Gaza.
 
You're in the CNN NEWSROOM. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[16:50:10] 
 
MARQUARDT: Tensions are high as more pro-Palestinian demonstrators are gathering at Columbia University in New York today. The NYPD was called in this week to break up another protest with more than 100 people arrested. But still protesters remained on campus.
 
This all comes after the university's president testified on Capitol Hill about the school's response to anti-Semitism on campus. 
 
CNN's Polo Sandoval was escorted onto the Columbia campus and joining us now. Polo, what's the scene there?
 
POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: And so, Alex, I'll share with you in a few moments images from inside the campus from a few moments ago.
 
But first, let me just set the scene for you. The demonstration that you see behind me here, this is actually very similar to the roving protests pro-Palestinian demonstrations we have seen since the October 7th attacks.
 
What is different here, however, is that this group of demonstrators are bringing their message quite literally to the gates of Columbia University. The reason this is as far as they can go is that's, because University officials have restricted access to all the faculty and current students onto campus. 
 
As you mentioned earlier today, the university working through the Columbia School of Journalism is allowing access to credentialed press onto the campus for a couple of hours. They escorted us onto campus. After that, we are free to go anywhere.
 
We then walked up to a portion of the south lawn, where there is still that persistent presence of demonstrators. They've called it the Gaza Solidarity Encampment. 
 
The main message that they're trying to really stress is still what we saw a couple of days ago when the NYPD was asked to intervene and basically detained over 100 offices -- over 100 individuals.
 
Their messages is to pressure Columbia University to divest funds from companies connected to Israel. And that's still what we keep hearing today. 
 
However there are still well over 100 students, not just at Columbia, but also neighboring Barnard College, who were suspended, facing disciplinary action because of their role in that demonstration after the Columbia University president labeled earlier this week a disturbance.
 
I want you to hear from one of those Barnard students who participated in that -- in that encampment a few days ago. Her name is Maryam Igbal. She told me a little ago that she would do it all over again, even if it means suspension again.

MARYAM IGBAL, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY, BARNARD STUDENT: I don't regret anything that I did. I -- like, this is probably the best moment of my life. I remember, like, for the last so many years of my life, it's been like nobody knew what Palestine was.

SANDOVAL: So for students like -- like the one you just heard from, this really -- it does mean a re-galvanizing moment. As you just heard, she would do it all over again. For universities, however, Alex, so this really speaks to the wider conversation beyond Columbia. 
 
This is a moment where many institutions of higher learning need to grapple with how they will be able to respond to these pro-Palestinian protests and potential counter protests in the days and the weeks or months ahead into the summer. 
 
So really multiple stories here at play. There is still the element here at Columbia University. But for so many universities from coast- to-coast in the U.S., this is something bigger.
 
MARQUARDT: Polo, what has been in the University's response to the protests? And in terms of those arrests, what updates are there?
 
SANDOVAL: That's a really good question. In terms of some of the people who were detained a few days ago, including the one you just heard from, they were basically just process for a trespassing charge. 
 
The one you heard from told me that she's scheduled back in court in May. She is certainly hopeful that this would not be prosecuted. And there is an expectation that that may or may not actually happen.
 
But I think one of the biggest questions it seems, like, I've had for some of these students is, what happens to their -- to their education?
 
The one you heard from, she's a first-year student. She is -- she has the support of her parents. And she is pursuing potential legal action she told me. But -- so that speaks to that.
 
In terms of the university, they are continuing to cut off access to some of those who are not students who are not staff.
 
It really speaks to the delicate -- the delicate balance that they have to strike between guaranteeing freedom of speech for students on campus. But at the same time, also ensuring the safety of those individuals on campus, not just here, but so many others across the country. 
 
MARQUARDT: Yes, universities all across the country are really grappling with this.
 
Polo Sandoval, outside Columbia University, thank you very much.
 
As Sri Lanka undergoes rapid developments, a battle is raging between man and elephants. The areas where the animals once roamed freely is now covered in farmland, villages and trash heaps. 
 
This is the focus of this week's "THE WHOLE STORY" with Anderson Cooper. 
 
Here's a preview of Nick Paton Walsh's report.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This is what he's come for, to feast on garbage. Not deterred by smoke that's stings our eyes either. So hungry or warped in his diet that this is what he'll endure electric shocks to eat.
 <br>[16:55:08]
 
Around 20 of the hundreds of elephants that circulate Sri Lanka's trash heaps have died in recent years, some poisoned, others starving as the plastic has filled their stomachs. 
 
They were simply never meant to be this use to the human world.

MARQUARDT: Be sure to tune in. An all-new episode of "THE WHOLE STORY" with Anderson Cooper airs tomorrow at 8:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific, only on CNN. 
 
We'll be right back.
