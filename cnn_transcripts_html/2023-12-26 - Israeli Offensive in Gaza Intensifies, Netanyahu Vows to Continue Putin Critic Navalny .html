JOHN VAUSE, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Coming up here on CNN, we are not stopping. The Israeli Prime Minister urges on his troops as their military offensive in Gaza expands and the Palestinian death toll surges. Lost but now found. Jailed Putin critic Alexei Navalny said to be located nearly 2,000 miles from Moscow in a remote Siberian penal colony. And thousands of migrants heading on foot for the U.S. An exodus of poverty set to make the ongoing border crisis even worse.
 
ANNOUNCER:  Live from Atlanta, this is CNN NEWSROOM with John Vause.
 
VAUSE: As Israel's military offensive on Hamas ramps up and the death toll in Gaza soars, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a second wartime visit to the Palestinian territory, urging Israeli troops to stay the course. And a warning, some of the latest images from Gaza may be disturbing for some viewers. Images recorded by a drone show some of the funerals being held in central Gaza.
 
According to the bus-controlled health ministry, at least 250 people were killed in one 24-hour period. CNN could not independently verify any of the numbers released by the ministry in Gaza. Meantime, in northern Gaza, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned of a long fight ahead, putting him at odds with the White House. One source tells CNN Netanyahu has dispatched a senior official to Washington to discuss the next phase of the war with the Biden administration. The Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said he would not stop until the end of the war.

BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (voice-over): Whoever talks about stopping, there is no such thing. We are not stopping. The war will continue until the end.

VAUSE: An Israeli airstrike on a refugee camp in central Gaza killed at least 70 people, according to the bus-controlled health ministry in Gaza. CNN's Will Ripley is following developments. He has the very latest now, reporting in from Tel Aviv. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Under the constant buzz of Israeli drones, Palestinians in Gaza once again dig through the rubble with bare hands. It's not a rescue mission. What they find? Remains of loved ones crushed under a collapsed building.
 
UNKNOWWN (through translator): My nieces and nephews, they were all displaced in Al-Barej. They fled the day before yesterday. It was their fate to be martyred here in their uncle's house. My nieces, Leon, Lana and Rana and my nephew, Hamada. Hamada was only three months old. They are still under the rubble.
 
RIPLEY (voice-over): It's one of the deadliest 24 hours in Gaza, in a war approaching its 80th day. More than 250 people killed in Israeli airstrikes on the Al-Maghazi refugee camp and nearby Burij and Nusayrot since the start of Christmas Eve, according to the Hamas- controlled Gaza health ministry. UN officials say they found the ministry's figures in past conversations, but they don't know if the conflicts to be accurate.
 
Responding to CNN questions, the IDF said, in response to Hamas's barbaric attacks, the IDF is operating to dismantle Hamas' military and administrative capabilities. Children, children, children, he says. Innocent children. This man lost 10 members of his family. And over the collapsed building, he bids farewell to his beloved Dina, the 10-year-old. He says, was the playful one. In the mangle of debris, glimpses of the lives that sought safety from one place in Gaza to the next.
 
It's up to the neighbors to find the bodies of families trapped beneath. The injured rushed to Al-Aqsa hospital through the night, the hospital already struggling with an influx of injuries and bodies from other airstrikes. By daylight, the community came together to the ritual of mourning. I was waiting for you to grow up, he says. The family moved from one shelter to another in pursuit of safety, this man says. My eldest son. Around every corner, families grappling with the scale of the loss.
 
UNKNOWN (through translator): My daughter Amay was martyred. My five brothers, their children and their wives, all gone. They were displaced from Beit Hanoun. There were 96 people in that building, all gone.
 <br>[00:05:09]
 
RIPLEY (voice-over):  Survivors of previous airstrikes come to the aid of the new survivors. Khalid lost his grandchildren last month. 
 
KHALID (through translator): This is utmost criminality. We are in festivities celebrating Jesus Christ. Peace be upon him. People talk about human rights, mercy, the Security Council, the Red Cross and humanity. Where are these human rights?
 
RIPLEY (voice-over):  The question Gazans keep asking, where is it safe? 
 
RIPLEY: And that is a question that so many people in Gaza are asking right now. Where is safe? Another question people are asking, how will they survive, given that the entire population of Gaza is believed to be suffering from acute food insecurity and this war shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. The question now, how many people, how many more people will die, not necessarily from airstrikes or not necessarily from bullets but from starvation? Will Ripley, CNN, Tel Aviv.

VAUSE: To Jerusalem now, Yaakov Katz, senior columnist at the Jerusalem Post. Welcome back, it's good to see you.
 
YAAKOV KATZ, SR. COLUMNIST; THE JERUSALEM POST: Thank you, John.
 
So, on Monday, the Israeli Prime Minister visited troops in northern Gaza. In a statement which was posted by the Likud party, he promised to stay the course in Gaza. Quote, it will be a long fight and it's not close to ending. We don't stop. We keep fighting and we deepen the fighting in the coming day. The Israelis expect the high intensity phase of this war, at least privately, to continue for at least another month. So will that timeline be determined by Israel alone? Is that likely to change because of domestic and international pressure, especially from the White House?
 
KATZ: I think that the Israelis would like, like you said, about four to six more weeks of the high intensity stage. What we're seeing pretty much now with continued operations of several divisions of the IDF on the ground, moving in the north, but the focus now is on the south. That's where the Hamas leadership is believed to be holding itself up inside some of those bunkers and underground tunnels alongside the 129 hostages or those who are still alive and are being held inside the Gaza Strip.
 
So, Israel wants to keep that going because they have yet to bring about the toppling of Hamas's regime. However, we know that the Americans want Israel to wind down that high intensity stage. And I think that this is what the conversation is about right now. How much more time can everyone be on the same page about? How much more time does Israel have for this high intensity stage? And also, what does the next stage look like? What does the Israeli presence in Gaza look like at that stage? What is a buffer zone, a potential security zone Israel will want alongside its borders? So, there's a lot of coordination going on right now between Jerusalem and Washington exactly on those questions.
 
VAUSE: Well, in an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal, Netanyahu outlined the three prerequisites for peace. Destroy Hamas, demilitarize Gaza, deradicalize the whole of Palestinian society. He also ruled out any role for the Palestinian Authority for opposed to Hamas Gaza. And again, that puts him at odds with the White House. So out of all of that together, it seems Netanyahu is essentially spelling out what will be long term occupation of Gaza. KATZ: I think John, Netanyahu is also we have to remember is being constrained by internal Israeli politics. Right. His coalition, which leans very hard to the far right because of several members. If he were to say, yes, I embrace, for example, the prospect of the Palestinian Authority coming in and replacing Israel for running the civilian affairs of the Gaza Strip at the end of this war, he could potentially lose his government.
 
So, he's trying to walk a delicate balancing act of sorts between articulating to an extent what the day after will look like at the same time being able to keep his coalition intact. Now, we could say that's not the right type of leadership. I have my criticism of that. But we also have to understand where it comes from. I think that no Israeli lives under any illusion that there's some other option besides for the Palestinian Authority that will come into Gaza the day after. The question, though, will be, John, what does that Palestinian Authority look like?
 
And we have to be honest for a moment. The Palestinian Authority, as it is now, the one that rules the West Bank, incites in its education system, has laws on the books that pay people to kill Jews. Right. So, all those people, all those Hamas terrorists who massacred Israelis on October 7th, and that horrific, barbaric, unprecedented attack, they would potentially be eligible for a Palestinian Authority paid salary because of what they did. Those laws have to be revoked. There has to be an end to the corruption. And they need new leadership.
 
They have the same man, Abu Mazen (ph), Mahmoud Abbas, leading them for 20 years after being elected for four-year terms. So, there's a lot of, you know, the Americans talk about revitalization. There needs to be reforms, substantive reforms, to the Palestinian Authority. And then hopefully they would be able to take over.
 
VAUSE: And hopefully, you know, their position will work. They'll be empowered rather than weakened once those reforms are put in place. But that's obviously a long way down the road. At home, Netanyahu is also facing this continued pressure to bring home all of the hostages still being held in Gaza. And families of the hostages staged a protest at the Knesset as Netanyahu was delivering a speech.

VAUSE: Well, the chanting is now, now, bring them home now. So, when it comes to prerequisites for Gaza in that op-ed, of the 655 words that Netanyahu wrote, not one of them is the word hostage. 
 
KATZ: Look, this is a very huge challenge for Israel. And Netanyahu would obviously, and I think all of Israel, would obviously prefer there be no hostages. It would make the operation simpler and easier to implement and to carry on. However, we have the presence of 129 people who are still being held in the Gaza Strip. And that is partly due to a failure of his government and a failure of the Israeli security forces. And this is a breach of the social contract between a state, its country, and our people, the people who were taken.
 
They have to be retrieved. And that has to be one of the top goals and objectives of this war. Netanyahu is trying to continue this Gaza operation, while on the one hand he pays lip service to the hostages. You are right that in that op-ed there was no mention of them. And that is something that is great. And that is a great concern to those families who feel that their loved ones are being neglected and are being left behind.
 
And I think that the government has a responsibility to better articulate what it is doing for those hostages to try to reach a deal that might include another pause, like a few weeks ago that brought back 100 hostages. We would do again to bring back these hostages. There has to be a plan in place. Because if we end this war, John, with those hostages still being held in Gaza, it would be viewed internally in Israel as a failure.
 
VAUSE: Yaakov, thanks for being with us. I know it is early there. And it has been a while. So good to see you. Thank you for your time. 
 
KATZ: Thank you. 
 
VAUSE: Well, the U.S. has struck three locations in Iraq used by Iran- backed militants to carry out attacks on American forces. The group Qutai (ph), who has been claimed responsibility for a drone attack Monday morning, which wounded three U.S. service members. One is still in critical condition. U.S. Central Command says early assessment shows the retaliatory strikes by the U.S. likely killed a number of militants. But there is no indication, they say, of any civilian casualties.
 
The whereabouts of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny may now be known, but for the most part, it's still kind of a mystery. He's been located in a penal colony in Siberia two weeks after his lawyers say they lost contact with him. The so-called Polar Wolf compound is one of the most remote in Russia. More than 3,000 kilometers, more than 2,000 miles almost from Moscow. CNN's Nara Bashir has details.

NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER: Well, news of Alexei Navalny's whereabouts has come as a huge relief after his legal team lost contact with the jailed Kremlin critic more than two weeks ago. But there is still deep concern over the situation he now faces after he was located on Monday at a penal colony in northwestern Siberia, described as the Polar Wolf colony. Now, in a statement on Monday, the director of Navalny's Anti- Corruption Foundation said that Navalny's lawyer had been able to, to visit him at the penal colony, adding that this particular colony is one of the most remote, with conditions known to be harsh and restricted contact with detainees. Navalny was sentenced back in August of this year to 19 years in prison after he was found guilty of extremes and related charges. Navalny has, of course, posed one of the most serious threats to
 
 Putin's legitimacy during his rule, known for organizing anti- government street protests and using his blog and social media to expose alleged corruption in the Kremlin. His incarceration has drawn widespread international condemnation, the White House earlier this month reiterating its call for Navalny's immediate release. Nada Bashir, CNN in London.

VAUSE: Now to the war in Ukraine. Ukraine, where Ukraine's air force says it has struck a Russian vessel carrying Shaheed drones, which was basically stationed in Crimea. Russia acknowledged an attack Tuesday but said a fire which resulted from the attack is now under control. It comes as Russia claims it has captured a key village in Donetsk region on Monday. The Russian defense minister told President Vladimir Putin his forces have gained full control of Marinka, a strategically important village. But Ukraine is denying Russia's claims and says the fight, fighting for Marinka, is still ongoing. The captured village would be Russia's most significant gain since it took Bakhmut back in May.

When we come back, migrants arriving at the US southern border say that going back to their country is just not an option. Some of their stories after a quick break.

VAUSE: Deadly outbreak of violence in parts of central Nigeria has left more than 100 people dead over the weekend in Plateau State. Hundreds more were injured. Local officials say bandits launched well- coordinated attacks but did not say who those bandits actually are. The region is home to several ethically and religiously diverse states. In recent years, hundreds have died in conflicts between different religious communities. Experts say climate change and competition for resources playing a role in all of this. 
 
Right now, thousands of migrants are walking from southern Mexico to the U.S. border. Many are from the Central and South America, as well as the Caribbean, Cuba, and Haiti. Organizers are calling the caravan a, quote, exodus of poverty. And CNN's Rafael Romo has details.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: This holding area behind me was empty when we arrived. Here this morning, and now there are hundreds of migrants waiting to be processed after surrendering to immigration authorities once they cross the Rio Grande. All those shiny spots you see behind me are Mylar blankets. Border Patrol agents have provided them. And it appears this new migrant search is going to go on for a while longer. There's a new caravan that departed on Christmas Eve from the border city of Tapachula, Mexico, at the border with Guatemala. We're talking about thousands of migrants who will be here at the U.S. southern border in the next few weeks, in addition to the ones that have already arrived here.
 
We are in Eagle Pass, Texas, at the border with Mexico. This is a community of less than 30,000 people that has to deal with thousands of immigrants arriving every week. Federal officials say the influx of migrants they're currently seeing across the southwest border is presenting a serious challenge to CBP personnel. This new migrant search is also putting a lot of pressure on local law enforcement. This is what Maverick County Sheriff's Office is reporting.
 
SHERIFF TOM SCHMERBER, MAVERUCK COUNTY TEXAS: Last week, the Border Patrol called us to see if we could escort the buses that they're being bused, those immigrants they're apprehending and processing to bus them to Laredo, Texas. So, I'm having two units, two vehicles with my deputies escorting those buses to Laredo.
 
ROMO (voice-over): And who are these people coming to America? We met a woman who flew from her native Cuba to Nicaragua and then traveled by land to Mexico before seeking asylum in the United States, claiming she was targeted by the Cuban government for speaking openly against it being in America. She said it's a wonderful Christmas gift.
 
UNKNOWN: That I'm going to spend it with my family, that I'm going to live in a free country, that at least, I don't know, I'm going to be happy because I'm going to live in a free country where the rights of citizens are respected. That wasn't the case where I lived. I was under a lot of pressure. 
 <br>[00:20:29]
 
ROMO: How many immigrants have entered the United States recently? According to the latest figures released by Customs and Border Protection, nearly a quarter of a million people were detained at the U.S. border with Mexico during the month of November. In a statement, CBP said that U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions so far in fiscal year 2024, which started on October 1st, are lower than at this point in the previous fiscal year. It remains to be seen if that changes once December figures are included. Rafael Romo, CNN, Eagle Pass, Texas.

VAUSE: Like many farms around the world, Israeli farms depend on foreign workers. But since Hamas attacked, farmers are facing a severe labor shortage. What they're telling CNN in just a moment.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
VAUSE: Pope Francis has joined the international calls for an end to the fighting between Israel and Hamas. In his Christmas message, he pleaded for the release of all remaining hostages in Gaza, calling the war an aimless voyage and an inexcusable folly. The Pope also said a special prayer for children affected by the war. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
POPE FRANCIS (through translator): How many slaughters of innocents in the world, in the womb? In the routes of the desperate, in search of hope. In the lives of so many children, whose childhood is devastated by war. They are the little Jesuses of today.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: The Pope also called for peace in other conflicts around the world, including Ukraine, Syria, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and South Sudan.
 
Well, the Israelis believe that thousands of foreign farm workers fled in fear after many were killed or taken hostage by Hamas on October 7th. CNN spoke to some Israeli farmers. Some of them are now struggling to keep their farms operational. Nic Robinson has details.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over): In a safe room on a dairy farm, a respectful recovery is underway. Ten foreign workers murdered in here by Hamas October 7th. The farm's camera recorded others taken at gunpoint, later found executed. Twenty-three foreign workers on this farm, mostly Thai, some Nepalese. Brutally killed. Some of them taken through this door.
 
STEVIE MARCUS, DAIRY FARM MANAGER: Every time I come out, I have, I see the safe room where ten foreign workers were slaughtered, and the living quarters where another six or seven were killed. It's always there.
 
ROBERTSON (voice-over): Stevie Marcus runs the farm, Gaza close, across his fields. His surviving foreign workers all fled. And that's a problem.
 
MARCUS: Basically, the foreign workers run the farm.
 
ROBERTSON: He has 730 calves and cows, 350 producing milk. A shortage of skilled labor is limiting productivity.
 
MARCUS: We have four volunteer milkers.
 
ROBERTSON: But this is a technical business as well.
 
MARCUS: Yeah. 
 
ROBERTSON: You need skills. 
 
MARCUS: Yeah. So, we're doing the bare minimum we need to do, making sure they have food and clean water, milking them. 
 
ROBERTSON : This is where the Thai workers were living. It's completely torched and destroyed. According to the Thai government, before October 7th, there were about 5,000 Thai workers in what they describe as the danger zone around Gaza.
 <br>[00:24:59] ROBERTSON: So, you got your weapon after the attack? 
 
YOSSI INBAR, VEGETABLE FARMER: Yes. 
 
ROBERTSON: Why is that?
 
INBAR: Because we need to protect ourselves. 
 
ROBERTSON: Yossi Inbar is a vegetable farmer. His farm close to Gaza, too. Half his foreign workers fled, volunteers saving his crops.
 
INBAR: I can't stop smiling. You know, I all the time thank them and tell them how grateful about it, because without them, I just close the water and everything, you know, everything would die. 
 
ROBERTSON: You'd lose the whole crop without them. 
 
And that could be bad for the whole of Israel. According to Israel's Farmers Federation, 40 percent of vegetables consumed in Israel are produced close to Gaza. It's what motivated Avi Leibovich to use his day off from his tech job in central Israel to help on Yossi's farm. 
 
AVI LEIBOVICH, FARM VOLUNTEER: It seems like they need us to come and support them, to support us, because without them, probably the markets will be empty. 
 
ROBERTSON: Danny Parizada is on a day off from his tech job, too, came despite the dangers of rocket fire from Gaza. 
 
DANNY PARIZADA, FARM VOLUNTEER: We really don't have enough. People are afraid to come next to the Gaza Strip, fear of bombs. You know, if something happens, we only have 15 seconds. 
 
ROBERTSON: Yossi knows his farming on borrowed time. Eventually, the volunteers will go back to their regular routines. 
 
But can you really make a business here in the future if there isn't additional security around? 
 
INBAR: No, no, no. Nobody will come back.
 
ROBERTSON: At Stevie's dairy farm, the same concerns. 
 
MARCUS: At the end of the day, everyone, no one's going to come and live here if it's not safe. And that's not just for the farm. It's for the population, the whole population. 
 
ROBERTSON: What does being safe look like here? 
 
MARCUS: Quiet.
 
ROBERTSON: And that seems a very, very long way off. Nick Robertson, CNN, Al-Umim, Israel.
