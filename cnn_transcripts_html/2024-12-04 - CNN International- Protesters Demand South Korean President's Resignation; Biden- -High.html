ERICA HILL, CNN HOST, CONNECT THE WORLD: The scene here in Seoul after the most dramatic 24 hours in South Korean politics since the 1980s. Hundreds 
 
 of protesters gathering outside the National Assembly and outside the Office of President Yoon Suk Yeol one day after he tried to declare martial 
 
 law, a move that both shocked and drew condemnation from those in South Korea and around the world. It is now 11:00 p.m. in Seoul, 09:00 a.m. here 
 
 in New York. I'm Erica Hill in for Becky Anderson today. This is "Connect the World".
 
Also ahead, Iran allows Nobel Peace Prize Winner Narges Mohammadi to leave prison for 21 days for health reasons. We will hear from her family. Plus, 
 
 the U.S. Supreme Court set to hear arguments in a high-profile case regarding transgender rights. We have those details for you.
 
At the stock market here in New York set to open just about 30 minutes from now, as we take a quick look at the futures, there little bit of green 
 
 flat, but a little bit of green, and we will take that on a Wednesday morning.
 
In South Korea, a major display of dissent in the capital, hundreds of protesters took to the streets, marching to the Office of President Yoon 
 
 just one day after he tried to declare martial law. Essentially, it's being seen as a political power play gone drastically wrong, creating an 
 
 immediate crisis for the president and for his government. 
 
Mr. Yoon's Defense Minister his Chief of Staff and a number of other top officials have already submitted their resignations, and pressure is now on 
 
 the president, that pressure growing for him to resign. All of this, of course, set into motion by that surprise declaration of martial law from 
 
 the president that happened just about 24 hours ago. My colleague Mike Valerio has been in the thick of all of this in Seoul, watching it unfold.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MIKE VALERIO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Soldiers clashing with citizens in a shocking scene outside of South Korea's Parliament. As crowds 
 
 chant dismiss the martial law after the country's president declared nationwide military rule the first time since 1980 in an unusual late night 
 
 TV address.
 
YOON SUK YEOL, SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT: I declare emergency martial law to defend the Republic of Korea from the danger of North Korean communist 
 
 forces. 
 
VALERIO (voice-over): All this in response to a number of actions by the opposition, including rejecting a budget bill and attempts to impeach 
 
 officials from Yoon's administration. Yoon Suk Yeol, said the moves were intended to, quote, incite rebellion, and accused opposition lawmakers of 
 
 trying to destabilize the country.
 
CHO KUK, REBUILDING KOREA PARTY LEADER: This decision is a crime. Is this someone who we will let run this country? No, will we let this slide? No.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It doesn't make sense. As far as I know, this is the first martial law declared since the Kwangju Democratization Movement. It 
 
 is really happening in the 21st century.
 
VALERIO (voice-over): Broken windows and rifle wielding soldiers standing at the National Assembly building as tensions between the presidency and 
 
 opposition lawmakers spills into mass protests.
 
VALERIO: We're here in the crowd, and there are two military vehicles that are trying to get out of here. We're just a few blocks away from the 
 
 National Assembly. There were some soldiers that were saying their military vehicles are trying to leave the area and get back to their base. 
 
 Protesters, of course, voicing their huge outrage in this -- at this moment.
 
VALERIO (voice-over): The extraordinary measure the president insists was to do away with what he claims are groups sympathetic towards North Korea. 
 
 Hours later, Yoon forced into reversing his decision after lawmakers voted to overturn his order, leaving a rattled South Korean public reeling from 
 
 the political chaos.
 
VALERIO: The question now what will be the president's next move amid growing anger across South Korea. Mike Valerio, CNN, Seoul.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HILL: Joining us now live from Seoul Sungmin Cho who's a Professor at Sungkyunkwan University and a Fellow of the Asia Society. It's good to have 
 
 you with us at this hour. As we look at how all of this is unfolding. I read that you called it sort of an unfortunate move of stupidity on the 
 
 part of the president. 
 
What does this translate to for the next not just the next several days, but frankly, as we wait to see how it unfolds, whether it will be an 
 
 impeachment or a resignation? There is a certain amount of instability that will stick around for the coming weeks, potentially months.
 
SUNGMIN CHO, PROFESSOR, SUNGKYUNKWAN UNIVERSITY: Yes. So, we already have South Korean people already have this experience of impeaching Former 
 
 President Park Geun-hye. So, since we already have this past experience, politicians and civil society, they will move on to impeach President Yoon 
 
 Suk Yeol. There are already gatherings and demonstrations ongoing outside. 
 <br>[09:05:00]
 
So as there is a growing pressure from the parliamentary and also civil society, first, they will -- President Yook Suk Yeol will be under pressure 
 
 to voluntarily resign, step down. As there will be a pressure for impeachment, there will be an internal pressure from inside, since he 
 
 doesn't have a much many allies now at this point. 
 
So, things are moving very fast, from martial -- declaring martial law and then overturning. Everything moves so fast. So, it is also possible that 
 
 whether impeachment or resignation can also move very fast.
 
HILL: Looking at this too, as it is all moving so quickly, there is also a broader global discussion about democracy in this moment, and democracies 
 
 that are being tested. What does the response and where we're at some 24 hours later tell you about the strength of Korea's democracy?
 
CHO: Well, it is unfortunate that our democratic system produces a leader who could make this apparently wrong decision. So, his decision itself is a 
 
 production of the system, but at the same time, it is also the system that put a break on this wrong decision. So National Assembly overcome the 
 
 decision, and then that's a perfect example of check and balance system. So, separation power works again, like it did before, during the Park Geun-
 
 hye impeachment.
 
HILL: In this -- in this initial martial law declaration, which, of course, was revoked a few hours later. But it was interesting that it also targeted 
 
 the news media publications saying they were under control of this martial law, under command of it. You noted that very quickly the press in Korea 
 
 actually moved to put out information about parliament, about the authorities about what the laws are. How important do you think that was 
 
 for citizens to see that information?
 
CHO: It is very important for citizens to be educated about the legal steps. So, before this happens, no one really bothered to read the 
 
 constitution, and then the law governing martial law and its legal steps. But since this incident happened, the media and then social media, they all 
 
 spread this information about martial law and how to overcome that. 
 
And then, through this process, South Korean people, they learn the legal steps, and then they move fast to support the National Assembly. So, 
 
 information work, educating South Korean people, and then many people rushing to the National Assembly to let the legal steps to move forward. 
 
HILL: What are you seeing in terms of the region -- what are you seeing from, for example, China, North Korea, even Russia, in terms of how they 
 
 view the last 24 hours?
 
CHO: I think the Chinese are very interested in about what is happening. But then maybe there are -- there may -- there may be there -- pure 
 
 curiosity about what is happening. What we are concerned is about North Korea's response compared to Park Geun-hye's impeachment, there has been no 
 
 response from North Korean regime yet. 
 
And then our -- the Chairman, Joint Chief of Staff, he announced that our military is sharply focused on deterring North Korea. He also shared the 
 
 information that he communicated with the Commander of the U.S. Forces Korea. So, we are sharply -- our military is sharply focused on deterring 
 
 North Korea to prevent their miscalculation.
 
HILL: Sungmin Cho, really appreciate you joining us. Thank you. Well, the turmoil in South Korea jolting markets, injecting a bit of uncertainty into 
 
 Asia's fourth largest economy. South Korea, of course, is home to some of the world's biggest companies, including tech giants Samsung and LG as well 
 
 as car makers, including Hyundai. 
 
Striking workers from the country's main union may affect some production. South Korean stocks fell about 2 percent at the open on Wednesday, before 
 
 recovering, the index closed down by 1.4 percent.
 
Well, the White House says it is relieved the Korean President reversed course on his martial law declaration. A National Security Council 
 
 Spokesman going out to say the U.S. will continue to monitor the situation. President Biden, who is wrapping up a visit to Angola, has yet to say much 
 
 publicly about the events. He and President Yoon, of course, have met numerous times. 
 
Mr. Biden has called him a great friend. Arlette Saenz is traveling with the president and joins us now from Wanda, Angola. So, and we also have 
 
 Jennifer Hansler with us who is tracking developments over there at the State Department. Arlette to you first, this move came as a huge surprise 
 
 to many around the world, including, apparently to the United States and to the Biden Administration. What are they saying? 
 
ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, Erica. The White House said that they this was a complete shock to them, as they received no heads up from 
 
 South Korean President Yoon that he was going to move forward with declaring martial law in his country.
 <br>[09:10:00]
 
Now, last night, a National Security Council Spokesperson expressed relief that the situation has come to the end, but officials were watching this 
 
 with great concern. They've been in touch with the South Korean government and are still trying to ascertain exactly what happened here and what will 
 
 come next?
 
For President Biden's part, we have yet to hear directly from him on this matter. Yesterday, he briefly said that he was about to get briefed on the 
 
 situation when he was asked by reporters, but did not engage any further. It's a curious decision, especially when you think about the fact that 
 
 President Biden has staked so much of his presidency on the fact on the need to protect and preserve democracy and democratic institutions, both in 
 
 the U.S. and abroad. 
 
So, we will see whether there is any other type of further reaction from President Biden, as this was a pretty stunning and surprising move from a 
 
 President in South Korea who has been a close ally for President Biden and a key part of his strategy in trying to build up relationships in the Indo 
 
 Pacific, as the U.S. further looks to find ways to counter China in the region. 
 
HILL: And Jennifer, to that point the fact that South Korea is such a major ally, of course, what is the State Department looking for, especially as we 
 
 move into this -- into this moment where the question is, will there be a resignation? Will there be an impeachment? And either way, there will be 
 
 some uncertainty and an interim leader?
 
JENNIFER HANSLER, CNN STATE DEPARTMENT REPORTER: Clients in the rhetoric we are hearing from the State Department and the U.S. government, they are 
 
 emphasizing that the partnership is ironclad. They have welcomed the news that President Yoon has rescinded his martial law order. 
 
Secretary Blinken noted this morning that there had been the unanimous vote from the National Assembly, and Yoon had honored that vote. So, they are 
 
 trying to show that they are still key partners here. Another interesting thing Erica is Blinken this morning, he emphasized that South Korea has 
 
 been an example of democracy building in the region over the past three or four decades. 
 
He was asked if it was a mistake, in hindsight, to host the summit for democracy there earlier this year, and he said, no, they were delighted to 
 
 have South Korea take up that role, and they will be looking to them to continue that example. So, they are giving them a lot of leeway here to 
 
 course correct, to follow the rule of law. 
 
They said they expect that any sort of conflicts -- resolved peacefully and according to law, be it in South Korea or around the world. Yesterday, we 
 
 heard from the State Department saying they were seeking to have contact with South Korean counterparts, both in Washington and in Seoul. It remains 
 
 to be seen whether those contacts have happened yet, but Erica, we do expect them to remain in close touch on this and to continue to press South 
 
 Korea to follow the rule of law here.
 
HILL: Yeah. Certainly, and Arlette the president wrapping up his trip there in Angola. What is left on the agenda for today?
 
SAENZ: Yeah. Well, President Biden just wrapped up a summit with leaders from some of the countries who will be benefiting from a major U.S. 
 
 investment here in Africa. The president has really centered his trip on trying to highlight the Libido Corridor that is backed by the U.S. and 
 
 Europe and is an 800-miles railway project which is aiming to bring critical minerals from interior countries over to the ports for exporting, 
 
 exporting that could also head towards the United States. 
 
This all comes as the president has really been trying to find ways to counter China's influence in the region. China has already poured hundreds 
 
 of billions of dollars into the continent over the last decade through its Belt and Road Initiative, which funds infrastructure projects. 
 
But the U.S. is trying to find ways to counter that, and the Libido Corridor is key. President Biden spoke a little bit of the -- about the 
 
 alternative that the U.S. is able to offer to these African countries. Take a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: I want to be clear about something. All these project investments are designed to have high 
 
 impact and meet the highest standards for workers, for the environment and for the communities, because the United States understands how we invest in 
 
 Africa is just as important as how much we invest in Africa?
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SAENZ: Now, the next time we will see President Biden is when he is departing on Air Force One to head back to Washington, D.C. This really 
 
 wraps up a long-promised trip to Africa -- Sub Saharan Africa. Biden had promised two years ago that he would make the trip, but there have been 
 
 other things that have come up that have taken away some of the attention for him.
 
But it's also a trip. It's one that he was very committed to making, but it's one that has become overshadowed by the controversies back at home of 
 
 the president's own making, relating to his son Hunter Biden as he decided to pardon him, and also that turmoil in South Korea.
 
HILL: Yeah, absolutely. Arlette Saenz traveling with the president. Jennifer Hensler at the State Department thank you, both. Turning now to 
 
 the conflict in Ukraine. 
 <br>[09:15:00]
 
CNN's Fred Pleitgen sat down for an exclusive interview with the Russian Deputy Foreign Minister in Moscow, who says the risks are, quote, high and 
 
 growing regarding current geopolitical tensions.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SERGEI RYABKOV, RUSSIAN DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER: My appeal and my message to people in the outgoing administration is very clear one. We will respond 
 
 if they provoke. We will find our way forward. How to assert our strong will and our interests? So, I'm not threatening here anyone. I'm referring 
 
 to, what was the case all along? 
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Do you think that the Trump Administration will follow through on its pledge, or Donald 
 
 Trump will follow through on his pledge to try and solve the crisis as fast as possible? 
 
RYABKOV: We have never heard anything from him or his team directly. We only saw what was made public by some people in his entourage. We saw 
 
 equally some statements by President-Elect Trump from his electoral campaign time when he said that he can resolve this issue in 24 hours. 
 
Some conflicts cannot be even resolved in 24 years, as we see it in the Middle East. But I'm not suggesting anything otherwise than the moment when 
 
 these people decide to come up with some ideas. We will be there. We will definitely have a very careful look. But please make no mistake, not at the 
 
 expense of what are the basic elements of our national position.

HILL: Well, coming up, climate leaders now sounding the alarm again on desertification and the silent killer drought. CNN sat down with Saudi 
 
 Arabia's Deputy Environment Minister, that conversation is next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HILL: Drought, desertification and land degradation, all in focus this week at the UN's COP-16 Conference in Saudi Arabia, home to some of the biggest 
 
 deserts on the planet, that drought is a major issue that, of course, hits close to home for the Kingdom. 
 
And now, as climate leaders gather there in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia is hoping to lead the charge in combating some of these growing issues, both at home 
 
 and around the world, pledging time, money and resources to work toward a solution. My colleague Becky Anderson, spoke with the Saudi Deputy 
 
 Environment Minister about the importance of investing in climate solutions.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
OSAMA IBRAHIM FAQEEHA, SAUDI DEPUTY ENVIRONMENT MINISTER: Drought is the silent killer. 1.8 billion people are impacted by drought, mostly rural 
 
 communities really forgotten. We see the -- maybe the side effects. We see people migrating, leaving, and then we talk about challenges with 
 
 migration. But why they're migrating? Because they lost their livelihood. They have to migrate or die in silence. 
 <br>[09:20:00]
 
So that's why drought is a high priority for the COP-16 to reduce the Saudi Arabia announced the Riyadh global drought resilience partnership. And the 
 
 whole objective is to shift from reactive response to drought after it is in the moral relief to a more proactive, comprehensive resilience before 
 
 drought it.
 
BECKY ANDERSON, CNN ANCHOR: And I wonder what that resilience looks like. You've placed $150 million we've also seen big pledges from the OPEC fund 
 
 of a billion, from the Islamic Development Bank for a billion, from the Arab Coordination Group pledging 10 billion by 2030. These are significant 
 
 financial commitments.
 
FAQEEHA: Yeah.
 
ANDERSON: Where's the effort from the richer developing countries?
 
FAQEEHA: Who would like to have a larger portion of that a higher percentage associated with to drought and that every dollar invested in 
 
 drought resilience save us between $5 to $10 in drought response. So, it is really, makes a lot of sense to do to invest in drought before it hits in 
 
 the form of early warning capacity building drought resilient crops, water infrastructure and this kind of produce.
 
ANDERSON: I know that drought and finance are two key priorities for you here in hosting COP 16 in Saudi Arabia. Let's talk about financing. We've 
 
 heard that some 2.5 trillion dollars are needed by 2030, that's the GDP of France, for example. It's an awful lot of money to address the sort of key 
 
 land issues that are being discussed.
 
We live in a very polarized, distracted world where finance is tough to get and there are lots of competing issues. How do you ensure that land issues, 
 
 the really important stuff that is being discussed here gets the attention that's needed, and how does the private sector play a role?
 
FAQEEHA: Let's talk about the dollars. Yes, you are right. We need about $2.3 trillion to restore the 1.5 billion hectares that we need to achieve 
 
 landing -- by 2030. And this looks very high number, but if you look to the contrary, we actually put around similar figures, about 2 trillion every 
 
 year in non-degrading substance.
 
We -- the world is put about $2.3 trillion a year on defense budget. So really, it's not about putting additional money, I think redesigning, 
 
 repurposing, some of the money that is putting for harmful activities, if you put a fraction that translate to $1 billion a day to restore, but we 
 
 are putting $13 billion a day to degrade.
 
ANDERSON: Talk to me about those subsidies, that you talk about, land degradation subsidies. What do you mean by that?
 
FAQEEHA: -- For example, unsustainable agricultural practices, unsustainable mining practices, there is a lot of practices, if we just 
 
 basically shift to more sustainable practices insisted. So basically, the whole idea is we are putting around at least $6 billion a day, indirectly, 
 
 destroying land, degrading lands.
 
And this is the whole issue. People say we cannot put a billion dollars out for a story. Take it for another. What we are losing by degrading? The land 
 
 degradation, you know, economic landing nation report estimate between six to ten trillion dollars every year are lost due to the loss of ecosystem 
 
 services.
 
ANDERSON: How do you get to the end of what is going to be 10 days of really hard work, ministerial debate here and come out of this with some 
 
 success? What will success look like?
 
FAQEEHA: I think, realization that when we inventing in land, we cannot lose, because it's inventing in food security, water security, 
 
 biodiversity, we will $1 invested in land is winning in those funds. And in climate resilience. I think the interconnect, the inter relation between 
 
 land, biodiversity and climate, food security, water security, social stability, because of the migration issues.
 <br>[09:25:00]
 
I think we need to realize the synergies and we represent, not about choosing to support one of the others. I think we have to find the sweet 
 
 spots where we win in all and I think the nature best solution in the climate the land restoration, drought resilience, climate adaptation, 
 
 resilience we win, winning all of those.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HILL: Breaking News here at CNN, the CEO of United Healthcare shot and killed in New York City earlier this morning. That is according to a law 
 
 enforcement official, Brian Thompson, who, of course, was the leader of one of the largest health insurance companies, United Healthcare, here in the 
 
 United States, was reportedly walking toward the Hilton Hotel in midtown Manhattan on his way to a conference when a gunman opened fire.
 
Investigators say they do believe this appears to be a targeted shooting. The gunman still at large at this point, we are working on more details 
 
 here. We're going to bring you updates as we have them, including hopefully from United Healthcare. We have reached out, have not yet received a 
 
 comment, but again, we will continue to stay on top of that story.
 
Also want to get you up to speed on some of the other stories on our radar at this hour, French lawmakers look set to oust the government in a no 
 
 confidence motion Wednesday. This was sparked when Prime Minister Michel Barnier -- tried to push through part of his government's 2025 budget using 
 
 a clause.
 
Pardon me, that allowed him to bypass a parliamentary vote. NATO Foreign Ministers wrapping up their meeting in Brussels on Wednesday without 
 
 extending a formal invitation to Ukraine to join the alliance, even with strong calls from Kyiv that It would agree to nothing less than NATO 
 
 membership to guarantee its security.
 
Meantime, protests in the country of Georgia show no signs of slowing down. Police and pro-European Union protesters there continuing to clash in the 
 
 capital of Tbilisi, this has been going on now for nearly a week. The Former Soviet Republic, of course, rocked by demonstrations after the 
 
 ruling party had announced that it would delay EU membership talks until 2028. Here's CNN's Matthew Chance with more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Another night of May head on the streets of Tbilisi, the capital of the 
 
 Former Soviet Republic of Georgia, is now torn between Russia and the West. Protesters here furious their government, seen as increasingly close to the 
 
 Kremlin, is delaying further talks to join the European Union.
 
NIA TKHELIDZE, PROTESTER: We should be the members of European family, and unfortunately, our government tries the best not to let us and not to allow 
 
 us.
 
GIORGI BAGRATION DAVITASHVILI, PROTESTER: I think Georgia government thinks that Georgia is Russian and will act as Russian people do, and no one will 
 
 come out in the street if others are beaten, if others are disheartening, but they are wrong in this. You know, this is Georgia, and Georgian people 
 
 are not like that.
 
CHANCE (voice-over): For years now, the conservative ruling party, the Georgian dream, has denied any formal links with the Kremlin but by-passing 
 
 repressive laws like limiting civil society and gay rights, similar to those in Russia. It's thrown into question the country's future with the 
 
 West.
 
Over in Ukraine, a daily sobering reminder for Georgians of the price of defined Moscow. Georgia suffered a brief war of its own with Russia in 2008 
 
 but avoiding this devastation of their Ukrainian neighbors. The conflict that began with a popular uprising known as the Maidan is what the Georgian 
 
 ruling party says now justifies its crackdown.
 
IRAKLI KOBAKHIDZE, GEORGIAN PRIME MINISTER: So, the attempt to organize the Maidan in Georgia is already over, I would call everybody to keep quiet, 
 
 let's say, and to keep peace in this campaign. So, we are responsible for that. I can assure everybody that there will be peace in this country.
 
CHANCE (voice-over): But that's not how it looks on the streets of the Georgian capital with police and pro-Western protesters outside the 
 
 embattled Parliament what looks like a pivotal standoff. Matthew Chance, CNN, London.

HILL: Just ahead here on "Connect the World". What happens next as South Korea's President now faces mounting pressure to step down. Plus, Iran just 
 
 releasing a Nobel Laureate from jail for three weeks on medical grounds, a move her family says is too little, too late.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:30:00]
 
HILL: Welcome back. I'm Erica Hill in New York. You're watching "Connect the World". More now on our top story, South Korea and the grip of 
 
 political chaos at this hour as it's embattled President Yoon Suk Yeol faces a possible impeachment vote amid calls to resign.
 
According to South Korean media, a vote on an impeachment bill is expected to happen on Friday or Saturday. Yoon sparked that political crisis, of 
 
 course, when he abruptly declared martial law late Tuesday, really, just about 24 hours ago. Only just scrapped that order under pressure, a few 
 
 hours later.
 
Protesters clashed with troops outside the parliament building after that emergency order was announced. CNN's Ivan Watson has been there speaking 
 
 with protesters in Seoul.
 
IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: This is a protest march, people walking by candle light carrying signs saying President Yoon 
 
 must resign. This of course, after the South Korean President on Tuesday night, made a sudden and shocking declaration imposing emergency military 
 
 rule on this East Asian democracy.
 
And that triggered confrontations in the South Korean National Assembly where soldiers tried to stop lawmakers from gathering there. In the end, 
 
 they did, about 190 of them voting down military law, including 18 members of President Yoon's own political party. He then backtracked within about 
 
 six hours of the initial declaration.
 
It might be one of the shortest periods of military rule that the world has ever seen, but it has triggered real condemnations of the sitting president 
 
 that have also come from within his own party, with demands for his defense minister to resign, one member of his party telling me that he sees no way 
 
 that President Yoon could continue to govern after he made this aborted attempt to impose military rule.
 
Meanwhile, the opposition is drawing up plans to try to impeach the sitting president. That could be if it moves forward a very lengthy process, 
 
 because it would require the appointment of another judge to South Korea's Constitutional Court. But in the meantime, the president, who was already 
 
 tremendously unpopular before the developments of the past 24 hours now there are calls for candlelight protests like this.
 
Around South Korea, what is striking is how kind of peaceful society appears. Where the main International Airport in Incheon was functioning 
 
 normally this morning, the restaurants around here were busy with the usual lunchtime office traffic.
 <br>[09:35:00]
 
Here's for example, one sign, let's take a pivot over here of what one protester is holding here. So South Korean society responding with 
 
 revulsion to what appears to have been an attempt to overturn the country's democracy, but also responding peacefully to what took place over the last 
 
 day. Ivan Watson, CNN, South Korea.
 
HILL: Turning our attention now to the situation in Syria, where rebels are closing in on the key City of Hama, rapidly trying to shift the battle 
 
 lines in a war that had in many ways been long dormant. This comes after a shock offensive by opposition fighters last week that captured Aleppo and 
 
 Idlib province and also caught President Bashar Al-Assad's government by surprise, as well as a number of folks in other governments around the 
 
 world.
 
Syrian jets, joined by Russian war planes, are pushing back intensifying their attacks. Dozens of civilians have been killed in this escalating 
 
 violence. And according to the U.N. some 50,000 have now been displaced. 
 
Elsewhere in the region, Israel now warning Lebanon of dire consequences should that cease fire with Hezbollah fall apart despite the tit for tat 
 
 strikes between the two sides however. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, insisting today that the truce is in fact holding.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: We have an oversight mechanism if there are concerns that one party or the other is violating the cease fire, 
 
 it comes to us, and one way or another, we engage the parties. That's exactly what's happened. The cease fire is holding. And we're using the 
 
 mechanism that was established when any concerns have a risen about any alleged or purported violations.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HILL: Those comments coming just a day after Israel's Defense Minister visited troops near the Lebanese border, where he threatened to directly 
 
 target the Lebanese state should the deal disintegrate. Iran's most prominent human rights activist has been freed from jail for three weeks to 
 
 recover from major surgery.
 
On Tuesday, an Iranian prosecutor suspended Narges Mohammadi's prison term to allow her to recover from an operation for a suspected cancerous lesion. 
 
 The Nobel Laureate has spent most of the past two decades as an inmate at a prison notorious for housing critics of the Iranian regime.
 
Even though, as that regime allows the high-profile activists to leave jail, albeit briefly, Parliament is tightening the country's already harsh 
 
 dress code imposed on ordinary women in Iran, one of course, that has previously sparked protests. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz is following all of 
 
 these developments for us from London.
 
So, first of all, I know we are hearing from Narges Mohammadi's family reacting very strongly to this decision to let her out for only a few weeks 
 
 there in terms of recovery, what are we hearing from them? And just and just remind us, if you could why she has been in that prison for so many 
 
 years?
 
SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely! So, we got word from her family this morning that she was being released, being sent by ambulance, 
 
 if you can believe it, that ambulance was not covered by state funds. It was something her family had to pay for. They have been appealing for her 
 
 to have a recovery period.
 
This is a 21-day release to recover from a very serious surgery in November. She had a portion of her left leg bone removed because there was 
 
 a lesion on it that was thought to potentially be cancerous. Since then, she's been in excruciating pain behind bars. Her family says unable to walk 
 
 again.
 
They asked for three months' time to recover. That's what they say. The doctors told them she needed but she has only been granted three weeks by 
 
 an Iranian prosecutor. During this time, of course, they're going to cram in as much medical attention as they possibly can, but they're also going 
 
 to continue to voice what is her primary message, which is freedom for women in Iran.
 
She has spent over a decade in jail already. She is serving up to 30 years in prison for multiple sentences. The Iranian government accuses her of 
 
 violating national security, of spreading lies about the state. She says these are simply consequences for steep for speaking out, for her activism, 
 
 for her work calling for freedom for women and girls.
 
In this sentence, as you mentioned, this release, rather comes just as the country tightens its restrictions, tightens its hijab laws. It imposes even 
 
 harsher punishments on those that violate it.
 
HILL: That timing is interesting, that happening today, right as we're learning about this temporary release. There's also as we know it, 
 
 according to a UN report, Iran's as it's referred to institutional discrimination against women and girls has led to numerous human rights 
 
 violations, some of which account to crimes against humanity. We are looking at in this one story we're looking at, but that is just one of many 
 
 of course, Salma.
 
ABDELAZIZ: Absolutely! And let's, if you don't mind, go through the details of this new bill that was passed by Iran's Parliament on Sunday.
 <br>[09:40:00]
 
I want to just pull up what this so-called hijab and modesty law outlines in it. It imposes harsher penalties for improper dress for women whose 
 
 outfits that expose the body below the neck or above the ankles or above the forearms. For men, the exposure is of shoulders and below the chest and 
 
 above the knees
 
If we could pull up that next slide, because I want to go straight into what the punishments are under this new bill. The financial penalties 
 
 include, for initial there's a financial penalty for initial offenses rather and multiple violations can include a prison sentence, travel bans, 
 
 driving restrictions, internet access restrictions.
 
What was so interesting and concerning about this new bill is that it could accuse women or find women guilty of violating these laws on social media. 
 
 So, if you post an image of yourself online without a hijab, that could cause consequences, it also imposes penalties for businesses.
 
So, if you own a shop and you allow someone to walk around without a hijab on, you could face penalties. Now, if you can believe it, one of those 
 
 opposing this new bill is the country's president himself. He calls the slaw vague. He says it could cause discontent. Want to read you a direct 
 
 quote from him, in my opinion, the hijab law, which I have to implement, is vague.
 
We should not do anything to disturb the harmony and empathy of society. We have to talk and interact about the issue. As you know, his fears of 
 
 discontent are very much real. It was only a couple of years ago that a young woman, Mahsa Amini, died in the custody of the morality police for 
 
 allegedly wearing her hijab improperly.
 
That sparked nationwide demonstrations that went on for months and months. Iran's government responded with brute force, and if we could just take 
 
 this back, of course, to our story about Narges, she actually organized demonstrations inside prison behind bars, against these hijab laws.
 
That's why this is so astounding. And a final thought on Narges, who was released for 21 days. Those 21 days will not be counted as medical 
 
 furlough, meaning they will be added to her final and total sentence.
 
HILL: Added to her final sentence her family had to play for the ambulance. It is all something. So many developments, important developments on this 
 
 day. Salma, I really appreciate you walking us through all of that. Thank you. Still to come here, even Donald Trump's loyalists say today is a 
 
 critical day for Pete Hegseth, amid new allegations threatened to derail his nomination to lead the Pentagon.
 
Those details just ahead. Plus, the U.S. Supreme Court taking up a very high-profile issue in this country, transgender rights for minors, what the 
 
 court could be deciding ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:45:00]
 
HILL: We are continuing to follow the Breaking News out of New York. The CEO of United Healthcare shot and killed in midtown Manhattan this morning. 
 
 That is, according to a law enforcement official, Brian Thompson, you see his picture on your screen there, who was leading one of the largest health 
 
 insurance companies in the United States, was walking toward the Hilton Hotel in Midtown, there to attend a conference when a gunman opened fire on 
 
 the street.
 
We do have some new aerial images of the scene outside the Hilton, of course, a massive hotel well known to anybody who has spent time in New 
 
 York City, and often the site for people who may be in town for a conference. Investigators say they do believe this appears to be a targeted 
 
 shooting.
 
As for the gunman, the suspected gunman got away on a bicycle, a manhunt underway now in the City of New York. We will continue to update you with 
 
 further details as we get them. Sources telling CNN, Donald Trump's team is now actively considering alternatives for defense secretary, now that his 
 
 initial pick of Pete Hegseth appears to be in jeopardy.
 
Two names being floated, Iowa Senator Joni Ernst, a combat veteran, and also Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. This is a critical day for Pete 
 
 Hegseth. He is set to sit down for his first TV interview since these new accusations of sexual misconduct, alcohol abuse and inappropriate workplace 
 
 behavior surfaced.
 
CNN's Steve Contorno, following all of these developments for us. So, first of all, before we get to all of the developments in this day for Pete 
 
 Hegseth, the fact that there are names being floated to replace him is actually a big development, because that tells you that there are things 
 
 happening.
 
There are wheels in motion behind the scenes. Tell us a little bit more about how either Senator Ernst or Governor DeSantis could really fit the 
 
 bill for the Trump transition team?
 
STEVE CONTORNO, CNN REPORTER: Yeah, there are a lot of Republicans in Donald Trump's orbit, as well as in the Senate, who remain concerned 
 
 whether Hegseth can get the 54 votes needed for confirmation, and they are now doing their due diligence around some other potential names who could 
 
 potentially replace Hegseth, if he were to step down or Trump take him off his list of consideration.
 
Now I will say the two names that you mentioned, Joni Ernst and Donald, or, excuse me, Ron DeSantis, are very interesting for two different reasons. 
 
 Ernst is interesting because she is considered one of the swing votes on Capitol Hill, who could determine, ultimately, Hegseth's faith, and yet she 
 
 is herself, potentially in the mix with that combat experience that you mentioned as a potential replacement.
 
Now Ron DeSantis is a sort of a stunning name to emerge at this moment, because him and Donald Trump have not been on good terms ever since 
 
 DeSantis decided to run for president in a primary that everyone knew Donald Trump intended to fight for, and the these two once allies had an 
 
 acrimonious end to their relationship during that primary.
 
And Donald Trump is also surrounded by a lot of advisors and individuals who once worked for Donald, or excuse me, Ron DeSantis and have a lot of 
 
 bad blood from that time. However, he does have some interesting qualifications. He is someone who has served in the military himself.
 
He also has a very buttoned up a home image, which is obviously in stark difference to what has emerged out of Pete Hegseth in recent weeks. And 
 
 he's someone who has vocalized a lot of the same concerns about the Pentagon and the military that we've seen Hegseth and Donald Trump speak 
 
 about recently. So that is a reason why these two individuals are being considered.
 
HILL: When it comes to Pete Hegseth himself. There was a lot of attention given to a letter that Hegseth's mother, an e-mail that she wrote to him a 
 
 few years ago, calling him a quote, a man that will belittles, lies, cheats, sleeps around and uses women for his own power and ego.
 
She said she later apologized for that e-mail, and she just is wrapping up an interview, as I understand it, with Fox. What more did she have to say 
 
 about her son and about those allegations?
 
CONTORNO: Yeah, I think it's important to point out that she did say that she no longer stands by what she wrote in that e-mail, that it was written 
 
 in a sort of a moment of passion, and she now stands by her son, and she also turned to Hegseth's Former Employer, Fox News, to share her version of 
 
 what transpired. Take a listen to some of what she told the network.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
PENELOPE HEGSETH, PETE HEGSETH'S MOTHER: They were going through Pete and his wife at the time, were going through a very difficult divorce. It was a 
 
 very emotional time, and I'm sure many of you across the country understand how difficult divorce is on a family. There are emotions. We say things, 
 
 and I wrote that in haste. I wrote that with deep emotions. I wrote that as a parent.
 <br>[09:50:00]
 
And about two hours later, I should -- my husband tells me I should think through things a little bit more, but Pete and I are both very passionate 
 
 people. I wrote that out of love and about two hours later, I retracted it with an apology e-mail, but nobody has seen that.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CONTORNO: Now, I will point out that Hegseth has been defending himself as well. In addition, he will go on Fox News and give his side of the story, 
 
 and just moments ago, on Twitter, excuse me, X he wrote doing this for the war fighters, not the war mongers. And warriors never back down, and 
 
 neither will I, Erica.
 
HILL: So, as we continue to follow that, there is also one other development I wanted to talk to you about the transition team, Donald 
 
 Trump's team now agreeing to background checks on nominees. This actually came after a push from Maine Republican Senator Susan Collins. What does 
 
 this effectively change?
 
CONTORNO: It clears the path for Donald Trump to use the Department of Justice resources, including the FBI, to background check members of his 
 
 cabinet. It does not guarantee that he will do it, but it makes them available, and this is something that they had resisted, in part because 
 
 they had said they were going to do their own background checks on certain people and handle that in house.
 
However, this change in position has come amid concern from Republicans on the Hill that a background check from the FBI could go a long way to -- 
 
 way, some of the fears about some of Trump's picks and with some people, including Senator Collins like you, said outwardly saying they would not 
 
 they would like to see what the FBI has to say about these allegations that have been raised against Pete Hegseth.
 
So obviously, two separate developments, although they are in many ways linked to what is happening with the hexagon nomination.
 
HILL: Yeah, certainly, they are connected. We are keeping you very busy this Wednesday morning. Steve, appreciate it. Thank you. And stay with us. 
 
 "Connect the World" continues after the short break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HILL: Happening soon, transgender rights front and center at the U.S. Supreme Court today. Justices will begin hearing arguments in just a few 
 
 minutes, challenging Tennessee law which bans gender affirming care, including things like puberty blockers and hormone therapy for children 
 
 under the age of 18.
 
CNN's Chief Legal Affairs Correspondent, Paula Reid, joining me now from Washington with more support. You're there outside of the Supreme Court, 
 
 what specifically will justices be deciding in this case?
 
PAULA REID, CNN CHIEF LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Right now, they're going to hear arguments on whether minors have a constitutional right to certain 
 
 forms of care if they want to transition. Last year, the state of Tennessee banned certain medical treatments for minors who want to transition.
 
And we had one of the rare interviews with one of the teens at the center of this case, and she and her parents talked to us about her decision to 
 
 transition. Initially, her parents were skeptical, but they did get her in touch with a therapist and began medical treatments, but those were 
 
 disrupted when this Tennessee ban went into place, they now travel to Ohio to get her care.
 
But we also talked to a doctor who supports Tennessee's ban. He says that he believes that minors cannot really give informed consent for this kind 
 
 of treatment, and there should be more emphasis on psychiatric care for teens who say they want to transition.
 <br>[09:55:00]
 
Though he says he has no problem for adults who want to transition. Now, we know the justices will begin hearing arguments in just a few minutes, but 
 
 Erica, we don't know when they'll release their opinion, but we do know the Republican administration that comes in, in about seven weeks does not 
 
 support this kind of care.
 
But even if they don't have federal support for their case, this teen and her parents say that they expect that their lawyers at the ACLU will 
 
 continue to advocate for them.
 
HILL: Paula, appreciate it. Thank you. A Russian stowaway who snuck onto a commercial flight from New York to Paris just over a week ago is now on her 
 
 way back to the United States. This video, which we have, this turns to the moment that the stowaway was confronted by flight crew members.
 
Last week, the 57-year-old woman boarded a Delta Airlines flight without a ticket. This, of course, all unfolding during the very busy U.S. 
 
 Thanksgiving holiday travel rush. The TSA says the woman managed to blend in with different groups of travelers and the flight crew to enter the 
 
 plane without a boarding pass.
 
That does it for this hour of "Connect the World", stay tuned. We pick things right back up at the top of the hour. You're watching CNN.
