COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, and welcome back to another week of awesome. It`s Monday, October 2nd. And this year has been flying by -- I 
 
 feel like it was September, just two days ago. I`m Coy. This is CNN 10. And we start with today`s latest on the government shutdown. Last week, we 
 
 covered how senators and representatives were struggling to agree on how to fund the government. And if they didn`t figure it out by Saturday at 
 
 midnight, the government would shut down, meaning millions of federal workers, responsible for services like the military, transportation and 
 
 clean drinking water would stop getting paid. That doesn`t mean all these services would end. Even if the government did shut down, essential workers 
 
 would continue showing up unpaid to keep Americans taken care of and safe. 
 
But that`s a lot to ask from anyone who lives paycheck to paycheck, right? Fortunately, Congress averted a shutdown, by passing a short-term funding 
 
 bill, which president Joe Biden signed right before the deadline on Saturday. Biden said the bill would give Congress more time to work out 
 
 funding for the year ahead. New deadline is now November 17th. 
 
So Saturday`s bill keeps the government open and takes care of aid for natural disasters. But it does not include any money for Ukraine and its 
 
 war with Russia`s efforts or security at our borders. And that means we could see additional bills addressing these issues in the coming weeks 
 
 ahead. 
 
While politicians in Washington, D.C. were dealing with the shutdown about 200 miles north, New Yorkers were facing a crisis of their own. The city 
 
 was hit with record setting rain on Friday. Brooklyn saw a month`s worth of rain in just three hours` time. And more rainfall at John F. Kennedy 
 
 international airport than any other day since 1948. The water overwhelmed new York`s sewer system flooded streets and buildings. Even the city`s 
 
 famous subway. CNN`s Polo Sandoval takes us there now.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Chaos in New York City as heavy rain pounded the five boroughs and the surrounding areas. Brooklyn 
 
 saw a month`s worth some 4.5 inches in only three hours. Knee deep water flooded streets.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Within I guess, about 10 minutes, it waste high water.
 
SANDOVAL (voice-over):  Forcing some residents to abandon their cars and others to create makeshift barriers to protect their homes and businesses. 
 
 Flooded subway stations in Brooklyn with at least 10 lines suspended. And even buses taking on water while still in service.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Oh, my goodness.
 
SANDOVAL (voice-over):  As they tried to wade through the floods. New York`s airports weren`t spared either. LaGuardia`s historic Marine Air 
 
 Terminal flooded. In the Bronx, the National Weather Service warning that the Bronx River reached major flood stage, with levels hovering close to 5 
 
 feet. Mayor Eric Adams declaring a state of emergency for the city.
 
MAYOR ERIC ADAMS (D), NEW YORK CITY:  This is time for heightened alertness and extreme caution. If you are at home, stay home. If you are at work or 
 
 school, shelter in place for now.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  China opened its first overwater bullet train line. It can take you to a city, 160 miles away in under one hour. The new line in 
 
 Fujian Province goes along the west side of the Taiwan, straight with the trains running as fast as 217 miles per hour. Fujian province is the 
 
 closest part of mainland China to the self-governing island of Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, despite having never controlled 
 
 it. In September, China`s ruling communist party stated its aim to facilitate better connectivity and integration between Fujian and Taiwan.

WIRE:  Ten second trivia.
 
Which of these is not a requirement to become president of the United States? 
 
Be a natural born citizen, be at least 35 years old, served in the U.S. military for a year, lived in the U.S. for at least 14 years?
 
All of these are requirements to be president of the U.S. except having served in the U.S. military, according to article two of the constitution. 
 
While there is a minimum age to be president, 35, there is no maximum and recent CNN polls have shown that Americans are worried about the age and 
 
 capability of the people who want to lead this country. But what about young voters? CNNs? Omar Jimenez talked to students at William &amp; Mary, a 
 
 public research university and the second oldest institute for higher learning in the U.S. to get their thoughts on whether age is just a number.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  How many of you think that president Biden is too old to be president again? And so why, why do you feel that 
 
 way?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  He does make a good president, but I just think that there is not a lot of representation for our generation in the entirety of 
 
 the government right now. And I`d like to see more of that.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It`s like president Biden capable of serving another term, I think absolutely. They should look to his legislative record and 
 
 not necessarily to his -- his age or his persona.
 
JIMENEZ:  It`s a key distinction for these William &amp; Mary students, age versus ability. President Joe Biden would be 86 years old at the end of his 
 
 second-term, while former president Donald Trump is just three years behind him, a different world than those who weren`t even teenagers when Trump was 
 
 first elected.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I was 11, I think that happened. They don`t say, go look at somebody graduated 40 years ago, 20 years ago, 30 years ago or 50 
 
 years ago to ask them for college advice. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I`m just looking for a candid who`s appealing, but the current candidates, Trump and Biden, I mean, they`re fossils.
 
JIMENEZ:  There are other candidates on the Republican side to choose from, but to some young conservatives, it`s more about perception.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I was in 6th Grade when Donald Trump won. He seems the same as he was in 2016 as I remember him. I don`t see his age affecting 
 
 him. 
 
JIMENEZ:  Some Republicans believe it can`t just be about age.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  They dismiss us all the time for our age. So we`re not going to dismiss people on the other end of the spectrum for their age 
 
 either.
 
JIMENEZ:  If I asked you, is Biden -- president Biden too old to run? You would say don`t focus on age?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Correct. 
 
JIMENEZ:  OK. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  If you`re in really strong, great health and you look and you`re being perceived by the entire world as confident and in control, 
 
 then age wouldn`t come up.
 
JIMENEZ:  The White House has maintained. Biden has more than demonstrated his fitness for the job. In 2020, voters under the age of 30 turned out in 
 
 greater numbers than in recent elections with exit polls showing they backed Biden by more than 20 points over Trump. 
 
It`s part of why at Hampton University in Virginia, Vice President Kamala Harris kicked off her fight for our freedoms college tour, hoping to drive 
 
 young turnout on some of the issues they care about most.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We want people in office who are going to listen to us and make changes according to that as well.
 
JIMENEZ:  It`s especially important for those who plan to vote for the first time.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I feel like a real adult. Just because we`re younger does not mean that we don`t have an understanding.
 
JIMENEZ:  And to some that understanding doesn`t have an expiration date.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  If somebody is 80 years old, pushing 93 years old, as long as they know what they`re doing, that`s all that matters.
 
JIMENEZ:  But to others, age means understanding, especially on issues like climate.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  They don`t have as long of a future on this planet as we do.
 
JIMENEZ:  Hey, direct about it. Yeah. Are you enthusiastic about placing your first ever presidential vote for president Biden?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Given what he`s done in office? Yes, I am happy to vote for Biden. Just wish that we had another candidate who could relate to 
 
 us a little bit more.
 
JIMENEZ:  It`s a bottom line that could swing an election by the youngest of margins.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I think in like all the difference. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yeah. I think it`ll be pivotal. A single college campus could make a difference, youth turn out as maybe the most important factor 
 
 in the next election.
 
JIMENEZ:  Omar Jimenez, CNN.
