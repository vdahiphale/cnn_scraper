COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello and welcome to CNN 10, your quick hitting 10 minutes of news where I tell you the what, letting you decide what to 
 
 think. Happy Friday, Friyay. I`m Coy Wire.
 
Be sure to head to our CNN 10 YouTube channel to like, subscribe, and send us your shout out requests. I`m going to start by showing some love today 
 
 to my friends up in Germantown, Maryland. Ms. Frankenberger`s class, Seneca Valley High School, rise up. Thank you for making us part of your day. 
 
All right. Our first story of the day deals with concerns around deepfakes and the presidential election. A deepfake video or audio is when a person`s 
 
 face, body, or voice is digitally altered to appear to be someone else. The concern is that this artificial intelligence could be used to confuse 
 
 voters about importing voting information, like when or how to vote at their polling places. 
 
Misinformation during the elections is nothing new, but deepfake technology has improved over the years, making them tougher to spot. Earlier this 
 
 year, an AI generated version of President Joe Biden`s voice was used in automatically generated robocalls to discourage Democrats from taking part 
 
 in the New Hampshire primary. 
 
While deepfakes are likely going to keep appearing, one nonprofit is trying to combat them by teaching us all how to spot them. Recently, the 
 
 nonpartisan anti-corruption organization "RepresentUs" released a public service campaign highlighting how scammers could use the tech to mislead 
 
 voters. And they point viewers to reliable sources of information ahead of the election. 
 
CNN`s Hadas Gold shows us which famous faces lent their likeness for the campaign and why it`s so hard to spot real versus AI fake.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN MEDIA CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Quick: is this actually Chris Rock? Amy Schumer? Rosario Dawson?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  A fake message saying --
 
GOLD (voice-over):  Not all of these celebrities are who they seem to be.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Because this election, bad actors are going to use A.I. to trick you --
 
LAURA DERN, ACTRESS:  -- into not voting.
 
GOLD (voice-over):  With just two weeks left until the election, fears are growing over the influence of artificially generated content.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We already know what they`re going to do.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  They`ll use fake phone calls --
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  -- videos or messages to try to change when, how, or where you vote.
 
GOLD (voice-over):  Warnings like this from the nonpartisan anti- corruption group RepresentUs, trying to urge voters to think twice.
 
JOSHUA GRAHAM LYNN, CEO, REPRESENTUS:  The risk here is if they trick enough people in, say, one target district in one swing state, in a state 
 
 that really matters to this election, they could throw the whole election.
 
GOLD (voice-over):  Deep fakes have been keeping campaigns and government officials on their toes. Now having to fight a new front in the battle 
 
 against disinformation.
 
Like this fake robocall back in January, with a voice resembling President Joe Biden urging voters not to go to the polls during the New Hampshire 
 
 primary.
 
ROBOTIC VOICE:  Voting this Tuesday only enables the Republicans in their quest to elect Donald Trump again. Your vote makes a difference in 
 
 November, not this Tuesday.
 
GOLD (voice-over):  The FCC fined the political consultant behind the fake call $6 million. He is facing 26 criminal charges in New Hampshire. He`s 
 
 pleaded not guilty. 
 
But not all deep fakes are as targeted. Manipulated images are all over the Internet, some showing celebrity endorsements that aren`t always true.
 
(On camera): Many experts aren`t as concerned about fake celebrity endorsements. They`re worried that manipulated content online will confuse 
 
 voters, or in some way, keep them from going to their polling stations. And it`s incredibly easy to make manipulated images. 
 
I`m going to use a program to manipulate a real photo into showing something that didn`t actually happen.
 
So, I`ll take this photo. I`m going to say, show me a car crash. And here we go. What could be taken -- several options of what could be a real car 
 
 crash between two vehicles.
 
Now experts are worried that somebody might take an image like this and share it online and say something along the lines of, "The polling station 
 
 is closed because of this severe car crash that took place."
 
And that might not actually be true, but that could keep people home.
 
(Voice-over):  So, this election, be aware and always double check what you see online with your state`s election officials.

WIRE:  Pop quiz, hot shot. 
 
In physics, there is only one particle that is confirmed to have a mass of zero, making it massless. Which is it?
 
Neutron, quark, photon, or antimatter? Ding ding. If you said photon, you are correct.
 
Photons are the smallest possible particles of electromagnetic energy that include radio waves, gamma rays, and visible light. 
 
While photons have no mass, there`s another mysterious particle out there that has some mass, but scientists still don`t know exactly how much. 
 
Scientists in China are on a mission to study neutrinos, high energy cosmic particles that are tiny, vaporous, and can pass through any kind of matter. 
 
 It`s no wonder they`re sometimes called ghost particles. These ghostly particles almost never interact with other matter, including the tens of 
 
 trillions of neutrinos from the sun that stream through us undetected every second. 
 
CNN`s Marc Stewart shows us how scientists plan to unravel their mysteries.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MARC STEWART, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  More than 700 meters underground, researchers in Southern China are busy solving a mystery, one 
 
 that could lead to a scientific breakthrough. For a decade, these scientists have been constructing Juno, an underground observatory. With 
 
 construction almost complete, they`re ready to execute their plan to better understand neutrinos.
 
These tiny subatomic particles are among the most abundant particles with mass in the universe, and they move at nearly the speed of light. Neutrinos 
 
 are all around us, even passing through our bodies, and scientists need to know more about them.
 
WANG YIFANG, PROJECT MANAGER, JUNO: The goal of this facility is to study the properties of neutrinos, in particular the mass hierarchy of neutrinos.
 
STEWART:  That is, they want to study which types of neutrino are the heaviest and lightest. JUNO`s experiments also seek to solve multiple other 
 
 mysteries, including why they change types while in flight. They`ll measure neutrinos emitted by two nuclear plants located about 50 kilometers away.
 
Knowing what makes up the fundamentals of neutrinos can open the door to learning more about the past and future of the universe, and discover the 
 
 nature of matter and energy. China isn`t the only country working to understand these tiny particles. Other countries are in the race to be the 
 
 first to solve the enigma.
 
YIFANG:  So the one in the U.S., the one in Japan that`s in the construction, there`s one in France in the seawater, it`s in the 
 
 construction. There`s one in South Pole in the planning. So all of this trying to understand neutrino mass hierarchy.
 
STEWART:  In a few months, JUNO will be sealed off for 30 years running experiments and collecting data. And while it may take decades, JUNO`s team 
 
 says they`re confident they`ll be the first to finish their research and solve the mysteries. If they come first, they could set the tone for what 
 
 we know about the universe moving forward.

WIRE:  Today`s story getting a 10 out of 10 is pumpkin spice and everything nice. This New England car wash chain is pumpkin spicing things up for a 
 
 good cause. You won`t be tasting any pumpkin on your trip through the suds, but your olfactory senses will be swimming in the scintillating spiced up 
 
 scent that`s infused into the suds.
 
Proceeds are going to a non-profit that provides medically customized meals for the critically ill. So for all the pumpkin spice lovers who can`t get 
 
 enough of the fall flavor, this might just be the extra dose of fall fragrance you didn`t know you needed. 
 
All right, it is shout out time. And today`s shout out goes to the bald Eagles at Barrington High School in Barrington, Rhode Island. We thank you 
 
 for tuning in and showing your love for our show. I had an awesome time staying on top of the news with all of you this week. Go out and make it a 
 
 great weekend.
 
Remember the power you possess. You never know when or how, but you just may be the light someone needs. Shine bright y`all. You are more powerful 
 
 than you know. 
 
I`m Coy Wire. It`s been a blessing to spend this week with you.
