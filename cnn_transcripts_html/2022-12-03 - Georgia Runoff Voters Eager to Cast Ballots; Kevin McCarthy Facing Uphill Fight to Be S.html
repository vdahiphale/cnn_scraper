BRUNHUBER: We are just a few days away for the runoff election for Georgia's U.S. Senate seat. Friday was the last day of early voting. Nearly 1.5 million voted early by the end of Thursday. 
 
On Tuesday, Democratic incumbent Senator Raphael Warnock and Republican challenger Herschel Walker will face off once again. A new CNN poll by SSRS found Warnock is leading Walker by about 4 percentage points. The poll indicates Georgia's Black voters overwhelmingly back Warnock
 
 by 96 percent. The runoff election will be held on Tuesday. CNN's Dianne Gallagher looks at the final moments of early voting. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I've never seen it like this --
 
DIANNE GALLAGHER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Long lines, once again, wrapping around polling places.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I started around the corner.
 
GALLAGHER: As voters go above, waiting hours.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: About two hours. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's pretty much the same thing, the lines wrapped around the building.
 
GALLAGHER: And beyond.
 
LORETTA ROSS, GEORGIA VOTER: My absentee ballot did not arrive in Massachusetts, so I had to fly here this morning to vote and my flight is at 4 o'clock. So I'm heading back to the airport. You do what you got to do, baby.
 
GALLAGHER (voice-over): Just to cast their ballots early in the Georgia Senate runoff election.
 <br>[04:15:00]
 
NASHA GOODWIN, GEORGIA VOTER: As long as it takes, because I know how important it is for my vote to be counted.
 
GALLAGHER (voice-over): Making a choice, most for the second time, between the Democrat, Senator Raphael Warnock, and Republican Herschel Walker.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If they don't steal the race from Herschel Walker, he will win.
 
GOODWIN: I'm going to vote for Warnock.
 
GALLAGHER (voice-over): Both candidates on the campaign trail Friday.
 
SEN. RAPHAEL WARNOCK (D-GA): Let's hear from the voters of Georgia who are turning out.
 
GALLAGHER (voice-over): Convincing voters to get to the polls today or make a plan to do it on Tuesday, while they deliver their closing messages.
 
HERSCHEL WALKER (R-GA), U.S. SENATORIAL CANDIDATE: I love this country. I love you guys. GALLAGHER (voice-over): A new CNN poll shows a tight race, with Warnock holding a narrow 52 percent to 48 percent lead over Walker among likely runoff voters. 
 
While Warnock confronts national headwinds, negative views of Walker appear to be a drag on his candidacy, with 52 percent of likely voters saying Warnock is well-qualified to serve as the senator but just 27 percent saying that for Walker.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No candidate is perfect, so I think it's really important to go with this at this point in time.
 
GALLAGHER (voice-over): From Thursday, nearly 1.5 million Georgians had already cast ballots, breaking records for the most votes in a single day of early voting this week. But overall, Georgia is not on pace to reach the 2021 runoff early vote total, with the state's new voting law, reducing the number of days of early voting in this year's runoff.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's not enough. They should at least staying in for 10 days. 
 
GALLAGHER (voice-over): Still, voters say they are encouraged by the number of people showing up to be heard, even if it means, for some, spending hundreds of dollars on a three-hour flight to do it.
 
ROSS: I was an election monitor in South Africa, in 1994, when Mandela got elected. And I watched those South Africans stand in line for three days. And I came home, saying, I will never not vote again in life.
 
GALLAGHER: Now that early voting is complete, it is all hands on deck for both campaigns to try to make sure that anybody who didn't show up to the polls for early voting gets to them on Tuesday -- Dianne Gallagher, CNN, Atlanta.

BRUNHUBER: U.S. House lawmakers are racing to finish their investigation into the January 6th insurrection before the current congressional term ends. Still undecided is whether to refer the committee's work to the U.S. Justice Department for potential prosecution. CNN's Sara Murray has those details. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
REP. BENNIE THOMPSON (D-MS): The clerk will call the roll.
 
SARA MURRAY, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Running up against an end of year deadline --
 
REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA), CHAIR, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: We're close to the putting down the pen and going to print. The House Select Committee investigating the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol convening privately today to weight its final moves and discuss its final report.
 
REP. ZOE LOFGREN (D), MEMBER, JANUARY 6 SELECT COMMITTEE: If we don't make a recommendation and this is not relevant to Mr. Trump or any other person, it doesn't mean necessarily that we don't think they shouldn't investigate. But we want to make sure we are on firm ground if we make any recommendations over the DOJ.
 
MURRAY: The committee still weighing what to do about criminal referrals. The panel also discussing what to how to present evidence of possible obstruction, perjury and witness tampering in its final report and deciding whether to hold accountable to five GOP lawmakers, including House Republican Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Congressman Jim Jordan for refusing to comply with committee subpoenas.
 
REP. MO BROOKS (R-AL): I've got a message that I need you to take to your heart and take back home and along the way, stop at the Capitol.
 
THOMPSON: The ayes have it.
 
MURRAY: Committee Chair Bennie Thompson telling reporters, there are three options. Refer the lawmakers to the Ethics Committee, hold them in contempt of Congress or quote, do nothing. The committee also vowing to make interviews with more than 1000 witnesses and volumes of other evidence available to the public.
 
SCHIFF: We are also going to be releasing the evidence, which maybe the most important thing. The voluminous transcripts, the documents and emails -- we want to make sure that that is put before the American people.
 
MURRAY: As McCarthy is still scrambling to secure the votes to become the speaker the next Congress --
 
REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): We'll take the speaker's fight to the floor. MURRAY: warns the January 6 committee to preserve all of its records and transcripts.
 
LOFGREN: They have been pretty clear that they'd like to undermine the work that we have done but we are going to prevent that. We're going to release all the information we've collected so it cannot be selectively edited and spun.
 
MURRAY (voice-over): Also waiting on those transcripts, the Department of Justice. The committee says DOJ will see them when the public does. 
 
In the meantime, federal prosecutors are moving ahead. Trump's former White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, and his deputy, Patrick Philbin, spotted at court today, after a judge ordered them to provide additional grand jury testimony in DOJ's criminal probe into efforts to overturn the 2020 election -- Sara Murray, CNN, Washington. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
BRUNHUBER: When Republicans take control of the U.S. House next year, there's a big question mark over who they will pick as House Speaker. The current GOP leader, Kevin McCarthy, has long been considered a shoo-in with the party's poor showing midterm elections has put McCarthy's quest in doubt. CNN's Melanie Zanona has our report. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MELANIE ZANONA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Republicans are bracing for a potentially messy floor fight over the Speakership in January. Under House rules, if no candidate secures a majority of the vote on the first round, the House keeps voting until someone does. 
 
They last time that that happened was in 1923 and now we have some of McCarthy's critics saying that they're going to oppose him in January and they have enough to deny him the speakership. 
 
Meanwhile, McCarthy is saying that he is prepared to take this all way to the floor and that he is willing to go through as many ballots as possible until he gets there. So this is really shaping up to be up a political game of chicken. 
 
Meanwhile the prospect of a messy, chaotic floor fight is starting to anger some of the more moderate members in the Congress. 
 <br>[04:25:00]
 
ZANONA: They wrote a letter to their colleagues, warning them that a messy floor fight could undermine the GOP just as they enter into the new majority. 
 
They wrote in a letter, "Such quarrels will only delay our ability to establish a working majority in the people's house. Make no mistake, we will not allow this conference to be dragged down a path to a paralyzed House that weakens our hard fought majority." 
 
Now at this point, no serious challenger has emerged to Kevin McCarthy. But it's not for lack of trying. I'm told the anti McCarthy group has been meeting with some Republicans, having informal talks, trying to gauge whether they'd be interested in running in the race. 
 
But so far, until nobody has committed that everyone right now is saying that they would not challenge McCarthy as long as he still in the race. However, it's really unclear what would happen on January the 3rd if McCarthy decides to drop out or if he can't get to 218 votes. 
 
So just a ton of uncertainty playing into this Speaker's race right now -- Melanie Zanona, CNN, Capitol Hill.

BRUNHUBER: Welcome back to all of you watching us here in the United States, Canada and around the world. I'm Kim Brunhuber, this is CNN NEWSROOM. 
 
The European Union and other countries are once again targeting Russian oil. That bloc, along with the G7, have agreed to set the $60 barrel price cap on that crude. 
 <br>[04:30:00]
 
BRUNHUBER: Some team members wanted a much lower cap of $30 or $40 a barrel. Now the decision has come ahead of the European Union's embargo on Russian oil traveling by sea, which takes effect on Monday. 
 
Together they represent one of the most comprehensive attempts yet to cut into Russian oil revenues, which helped fund the war in Ukraine. The head of the European Commission explained how the price cap will work. Here she is. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
URSULA VAN DER LEYEN, PRESIDENT, EUROPEAN COMMISSION: This price cap has three objectives. First, it strengthens the effects of our sanctions. Second, it will further diminish Russia's revenues. 
 
And thirdly, at the same time, it will stabilize global energy markets because it allows some Russian seaborne oil to be traded broker (ph) transported by E.U. operators to their countries, as long as it is sold below the cap. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER: Global energy experts admit they cannot predict what impact the price cap will have on the oil market or how Moscow might respond. 
 
Now in Ukraine, new indications that Russia is preparing to evacuate civilians from some occupied towns in the Zaporizhzhya region. One community had posted a notice from pro Russian officials asking residents to prepare for a possible evacuation. 
 
Ukraine says that Russian troops have already withdrawn from three settlements in the region. 
 
Meanwhile, new video shows the aftermath of a Russian rocket strike in Kharkiv region. Ukrainian officials say a rocket tore through this apartment building on Thursday, wounding two people. The rocket apparently took out an entire chunk of the building, leaving it in ruins. 
 
But some of the missiles Russia has been firing on Ukraine are reportedly dummies. Ukrainian military those are nuclear capable but don't have any kind of explosive warheads. But Ukraine says that they are far from harmless and Russia is using them for a reason. For more, Will Ripley joins us from Kyiv. 
 
What more are we learning about Russia's use of those dummy missiles?
 
WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The assessment from the Ukrainian side is that Russia still has a very sizeable stockpile of missiles that are viable. They don't need to necessarily use these dummies, these 1980s engineered nuclear capable missiles, that they are firing without warheads. 
 
And there's no indication that there is any radioactive material in these missiles which are hitting largely civilian infrastructure targets here in Kyiv and across Ukraine. The last attack last week, Russia fired more than 70 projectiles in total. Some of them with warheads and, Ukrainian officials said, some of them without. 
 
Why would they be doing this?
 
Well, one school of thought is that, by firing so many at once or in a short period of time, over four or so hours, the goal is to exhaust the air defense systems here because out of those 70 plus that were fired, Ukrainians shot down more than 50 of them. 
 
But -- that -- the large volume that was fired makes it almost impossible to shoot everything down. So if the Ukrainians are wasting their resources, shooting down these dummies, that increases the likelihood that missiles with warheads can strike these civilian air infrastructure targets. 
 
Of course, the power generation systems is the top target, Kim, the hope being that Russia can inflict maximum damage while exhausting the air defenses. That is one of the possible reasons why Russia is firing these older dummy missiles. 
 
It's not necessarily that they are running out; they're just trying to overwhelm essentially with these attacks. And there is, potentially, you know, they're bracing themselves here for another attack in the coming days. 
 
Basically, they assume that Russia is giving Ukraine enough time to rebuild these power systems before they then launch another onslaught. So that's something that we're going to be watching very closely here. 
 
BRUNHUBER: Yes, I want to ask you about, they've been scrambling to restore power but there are still millions of Ukrainians in the dark. 
 
What's the latest on that front?
 
RIPLEY: You know, it's certainly more grim outside of the capital. Here in Kyiv, people are living without power for several hours every day. There are parts of Ukraine, however, where people are only have power for a few hours a day and the rest of the time, they are in the dark. 
 
And if they are living in one of these old Soviet era high-rise buildings where you need the elevator to go up and down, that could be incredibly difficult. You're not only dealing with the cold but also in the dark, but also having to climb flights upstairs to try to go up and down to get the essentials to go on with your daily lives. 
 
So that is certainly a struggle here in Kyiv. It is very well organized, I have to say. If there is a power outage, a lot of small businesses now have been able to procure generators. And so when the lights go out, you'll hear the buzz of these generator engines turning on and businesses will continue to serve coffee, serve lunch.
 
They might have a smaller menu during times of a power cut. But yet, they are just resilient and they continue to forge ahead. But certainly, if there is yet another large attack, that could cut power capacity very significantly. 
 
Right now, here in Kyiv, they have about 70 percent of what they normally would have available in terms of electricity. 
 <br>[04:35:00]
 
RIPLEY: But that number could shoot down very quickly, depending on how successful Russia would be in their expected next wave of attacks, Kim. 
 
BRUNHUBER: All right, thank you so much, Will Ripley, in Kyiv, appreciate it. 
 
Ukraine says it diplomatic outposts have become targets of a fear campaign. That's after 17 Ukrainian embassies and consulates received either letter bombs or suspicions packages in recent days. 
 
In some cases, letters contained separate animal eyes. One package exploded at the embassy in Madrid on Wednesday, injuring an employee. Ukraine's foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba spoke exclusively with CNN about who may be behind it. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
DMYTRO KULEBA, UKRAINIAN MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS: Well, it started with an explosion in the embassy of Ukraine, in Spain. But what followed was this explosion was more weird. I would say, even, sick, because we started to receive letter us with eyes, animal eyes, cut off.
 
MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Animal eyes?
 
KULEBA: Animal eyes, yes.
 
In some cases or in one case, it is most probably an eye of a cow and an eye of a pig, in another case.
 
CHANCE: Let me ask you, who do you suspect?
 
Who does Ukraine suspect of being behind this?
 
KULEBA: Well, of course, I feel tempted to speak -- to name Russia, straight away, because, first of all, you have to answer the question, who benefits from that?
 
It is, definitely, this campaign that is aimed at sowing fear and terrorizing Ukrainian diplomats. I think it is either Russia itself or someone who sympathizes to the Russian cause.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
BRUNHUBER: And security has now been stepped up at Ukrainian diplomatic offices around the world. A short time ago, Russia's foreign ministry responded to Dmytro Kuleba's suggestion that Moscow could be behind the packages. 
 
It issued a statement calling him, quote, "psycho." 
 
Now 2.5 months after protests erupted in Iran over the death of a young woman in custody of the country's morality police, demonstrations showed no signs of stopping. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER (voice-over): Women marched in protests Friday after prayers in the provincial capital in southeastern Iran. The scene captured in this video from the NGO, Iran Human Rights. 
 
Shots could be heard in the social media video from the same city. Pictures showed one protester with minor injuries but no casualties were reported. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER: And amid the ongoing protests, a female Iranian rock climber recently competed internationally without covering her hair. Now a pro reform news outlet is reporting the destruction of her family home inside the country. Nada Bashir has the story from London. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, this comes just six weeks after Elnaz Rekabi returned to Tehran after competing at a rock climbing contest in South Korea, without her mandatory hijab. 
 
Footage obtained by pro former news outlet, IranWire, appears to show the pro athlete's family home being demolished. Her brother seen crying in the video beside the rubble. CNN cannot independently confirm whether the alleged demolition of Rekabi's family home took place by order of government officials. 
 
And at this stage, the Iranian authorities have not issued any comment. But concerns about possible repercussions for Rekabi's actions in Seoul have persisted since her return in October. 
 
The pro rock-climber quickly became a symbol of protest against the regime's severe restrictions on women's rights. And while she later issued a statement, saying that she had competed with her hair uncovered by accident, there were concerns at the time that she may have been speaking under duress. 
 
Of course, the alleged demolition of the athlete's home comes just days after reports emerged that authorities in Iran had issued threats to the country's national soccer team and their family members while they were competing at the World Cup in Qatar. 
 
A source telling CNN that the warning came after players refused to sing the national anthem at their opening match. 
 
Meanwhile, the regime's brutal crackdown on protests in Iran shows no signs of easing. Amongst the latest victims is Mehran Samak, who was reportedly killed by security forces in northern Iran on Tuesday, during public celebrations following the national football team's defeat against the USA in Qatar. 
 
Iranian authorities have, according to state aligned media, denied responsibility for his death and said that several suspects have been arrested in connection with the incident. 
 
But the Norway-based Iran Human Rights organization says it believes Samak was shot in the head by security personnel, citing several independent sources. The death of Mehran Samak has become yet another symbol of the protest movement, with mourners at his funeral on Thursday, chanting, "death to the dictator" -- Nada Bashir, CNN, London.

(MUSIC PLAYING) 
 
BRUNHUBER: The U.S. economy added more than a quarter of a million jobs last month, so while that was good news for most Americans, Wall Street didn't quite see it that way. After sinking at the open, markets closed relatively flat on Friday. 
 
The 263,000 new jobs in November was much higher than expected. But analysts fear it could lead to more interest rate hikes. The unemployment rate still held steady at 3.7 percent. 
 
Now Americans are also taking home bigger paychecks with hourly wages rising at their fastest pace in almost a year. President Biden says Americans should feel good about where the economy is headed. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We are in a position now where, we hear things are moving and moving in the right direction. As we go into the holiday season, here's what this all means: Americans are working, the economy is growing, wages are rising faster than inflation. And we have avoided at a catastrophic rail strike. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER: The president's upbeat assessment isn't shared by the financial markets. CNN's Matt Egan explains why Wall Street has turned sour on some good economic news. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MATT EGAN, CNN BUSINESS SENIOR WRITER: The hope was for a Goldilocks jobs number, not too hot -- that would chill inflation -- and not too cold -- that would hint at a recession.
 
We did not get Goldilocks. We got hot. Jobs growth has slowed but the slowdown recently has been glacial. You almost need a magnifying glass to see it. 
 
Now some sectors did lose jobs of retail, transportation and temporary help. They were all down in November. But otherwise, there was a lot of demand for workers, as leisure and hospitality recovers from COVID, adding almost 90,000 jobs in one month alone. Health care, government and construction, all of them added jobs. 
 <br>[04:45:00]
 
EGAN: The part of the jobs reports catching the attention of economists and investors is wages. Coming in, the thinking was that wages would cool off, which would be encouraging, because that would take some pressure off inflation. That did not happen. Wages heated up, growing by 5.1 percent year over year. 
 
For context, that is roughly twice as hot as the pre-COVID pace. That's a just very strong demand for workers. At the same time, the supply of labor is shrinking, as the worker shortage continues. The labor force participation rate dipped for the third month in a row. 
 
Now this will not please the Federal Reserve, which is trying to get inflation under control by easing this imbalance between supply and demand in the jobs market. Now this is good news for workers in the sense that their paychecks are getting hammered by inflation, so they want pay, of course, they go up. 
 
But despite the hot wage number today, wages are still not keeping up with the inflation. I think when we take a step back, this is a good news/bad news situation. The good news is that there is nothing about the November jobs report that screams imminent recession. This jobs market is still chugging along and that is a relief. 
 
Nobody wants to see the job market go ice cold. The bad news, though, is that this jobs report is probably going to embolden the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates to cool this economy off. 
 
Not just at the upcoming meeting this month but also raising rates into next year. And the problem is that, the more the Fed does, the greater the risk that they will eventually do too much, tipping the economy into recession -- back to you. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
BRUNHUBER: Plus the soaring cost of living remains at the forefront of the global economy. "The Economist" intelligence unit released its list of the world's most expensive cities. The guide tracks everyday expenses in 172 cities worldwide. Have a look. 
 
New York and Singapore tied for first place. For the first time, the Big Apple has landed at the top of the list. Increasing gasoline prices were the biggest cause of increases in Western Europe. 
 
And the report found the average cost of living in the world's largest cities is up more than 8 percent this year. 
 
All right, well, it's not just a line in a Christmas song. The weather outside is frightful for millions of Americans.

BRUNHUBER: Incredible eruption of the Mauna Loa volcano is so awe inspiring it's become a tourist attraction in Hawaii. David Culver has the latest. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DAVID CULVER, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The nighttime glow of Mauna Loa's oozing lava, well, you just have to pull over to properly admire it. And it's basically the middle of the night. 
 
And you guys are out here. 
 
Why?
 
PILANI ZYCH, OAHU, HAWAII RESIDENT: Well, I mean, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to be able to experience this. And we decided to come early in the morning so we didn't have to sit in the traffic.
 
CULVER: Having hopped from Oahu to here, the Big Island, this family, three generations, came to respectfully honor the Hawaiian interruptions.
 
ZYCH: It's all beautiful to us. And so, we pay huge reverence to this. It's very culturally significant for us as well. So it's a big deal.
 
CULVER: A site made even more alluring with a site of sunrise, which brought the crowds to old saddle road. 
 <br>[04:55:00]
 
CULVER (voice-over): Officials turning this stretch into a one-way street, allowing passersby the chance to stop and let the views seep (sic) in.
 
CULVER: And that keeps drivers from pulling over and stopping on this, what is one of the main highways connecting one part of the island to the other. USGS and state officials warned the lava flow, while slowed in recent days, is inching closer to cutting off this highway. It's within three miles now. The other worry not here on the ground but up in the air. 
 
What looked like plumes of smoke, experts say those are acid gases. Officials monitoring the levels, warning it could become toxic for residents and visitors of the Big Island. CULVER (voice-over): Mauna Loa is the second of the Big Island's five volcanoes currently erupting. Kilauea still rumbling after destroying within 600 homes here in 2018.
 
ERECH ZYCH, OAHU, HAWAII RESIDENT: This is very significant, like my wife -- we made leis on our wall, we brought them over here and we gave it as an offering, you know, just you come with respect.
 
CULVER (voice-over): But many Hawaiians see the potential path of destruction as simultaneous creations, surfacing from this, the world's largest active volcano. 
 
CULVER: And with the eruption continued at its current, pacing officials feel they should give folks up to two days' notice should the lava make its way onto that major thoroughfare heading off that highway. But they also warned, when it comes to the flow of lava, there is no forecasting-- David Culver, CNN, Hawaii.
