CHRISTINA MACFARLANE, CNN HOST:  Hello and a warm welcome. I'm Christina Macfarlane in London. This is THE GLOBAL BRIEF. 
 
Moscow amplifies its attacks across Ukraine, launching over 70 missiles in one day. 
 
Then, two bombings rocked Jerusalem, killing a 15-year-old boy. 
 
And as the U.N. Human Rights Council gets ready to hold an emergency session on Iran, we speak to a doctor who argues the international 
 
 community has failed Iranian protesters. 
 
Russia has unleashed what Ukraine calls a large-scale assault across the country. The Ukrainian military says the Russian side launched as many as 
 
 70 missiles on Sunday. The majority of them were shot down, but not all. Policing a residential building in Kyiv was hit, killing at least four 
 
 people. Every region in the country saw outages because of these attacks. 
 
We're hearing power has now been restored in some areas. Authorities had to shut down nuclear plants and suspend the capital's water supply. There was 
 
 also a Russian strike in the Zaporizhzhia region. Officials say a maternity ward was hit, killing a newborn baby. 
 
CNN international correspondent Sam Kiley is joining me from Kryvyi Rih in central Ukraine. 
 
Sam, this continued shelling is creating a national crisis for Ukrainians. Kyiv's mayor today says they're bracing for the worst winter since World 
 
 War II. From what you're seeing, how desperate is this situation becoming for civilians on the ground? 
 
SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, across the country, and you can see here, I'm outside, you wouldn't know it. There's 
 
 no street lights, no lighting of any kind, because this city, which is a very large industrial city indeed, at the center of an iron ore industry, 
 
 has got no electricity. 
 
Now, this is -- we are not sure whether this is because it's been a hit in this very widespread cruise missile attack across the country, Christina, 
 
 or whether it was electricity cut off here because it is needed elsewhere. And that is because across the country, as winter closes in, things are 
 
 going to get harder and harder. But in the city of Kherson, which already did have electricity, because its infrastructure had been destroyed by the 
 
 retreating Russians, people were still living under daily bombardment from just across the river. 
 
And it's also a location where the resistance fighters who were able to kill and fight and spy against the Russians are now emerging into the 
 
 daylight. 
 
This is their story. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KILEY (voice-over):  Archie killed twice while he was still a teenager. 
 
If I am the guy, he stops to pee, so I'm having a pee, and then what do you do?
 
Oh, god, I got a chill in. 
 
He says he left his victim to bleed on the grass in the pitch-dark. Archie struck again moments later. Another drunk Russian soldier. Another throat 
 
 cut. 
 
He acted alone, but now he was one of Kherson's resistance fighters. 
 
ARCHIE, KHERSON RESISTANCE FIGHTER (through translator):  They're wasted. It had only been a few days since they entered the city. I finished the 
 
 first one immediately, and then caught up with the other one and killed him on the spot. I threw away the knife and the jacket covered with blood and 
 
 just left. 
 
KILEY:  Archie was only 19 when the Russians captured his city in March. With a friend, he says, he drove around the city gathering intelligence to 
 
 send to Ukraine's armed forces. 
 
ARCHIE (through translator):  At least ten Russians were slaughtered every night. I wasn't the only one in Kherson. There were a lot of athletic and 
 
 clever partisan guys. 
 
KILEY:  For eight months, Ukrainian partisans waged psychological wars against the occupiers and their collaborators, targeting Ukrainians who 
 
 took top posts handed out by Russia. 
 
KIRIL STREMOUSOV, RUSSIAN APPOINTED DEPUTY HEAD OF THE KHERSON REGION (through translator):  As a result of a sneaky terrorist act today, our 
 
 colleague, my friend has died. 
 
KILEY:  Stremousov himself would die in the final days of Russia's occupation of Kherson city, which ended three weeks ago. 
 
Kherson was the only regional capital to fall to Russia. But its population made sure that the invaders were unwelcome from the start. 
 <br>[17:05:06]
 
That's incoming. 
 
In the last hour or so that we've been here in Kherson, there's been a constant shelling backwards and forwards. Almost all of that shelling will 
 
 ultimately rely on somebody on the ground telling the gunner where to drop those bombs. 
 
Ihor is a young father. This warehouse is wrecked because of him. 
 
IHOR, KHERSON RESIDENT (through translator):  The Russian military kept here around 20 to 30 vehicles. There were armored trucks, APCs. And the 
 
 Russians live here. I was passing by this place and I saw all the vehicles. 
 
KILEY:  Ihor communicated on his phone app with his handler, code name "the smoke".
 
IHOR (through translator):  I turned on the camera and pointed it at the building. And I was just walking and talking on the phone. And the camera 
 
 was filming. I deleted the video, of course, because if they would stop me somewhere and check my videos and pictures, there would be questions. 
 
KILEY:  Less than a day later, he says, Russian vehicles were a mangled mess, as Russian rained missiles down on a newly identified target. It was 
 
 a crucial step in destroying Russia's capacity to hold onto the city. With the Russians now massed on the eastern side of the Dnipro River, they're 
 
 close and still control 60 percent of the province, which they claim is now part of Russia. No doubt there are many Ukrainians among them who were also 
 
 prepared to prove them wrong and to kill. 
 
Do you feel sorry for the guys you killed at all? 
 
ARCHIE:  No. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
KILEY (on camera):  Now, Christina, there is a great dear of help coming into Ukraine, and they're being extremely efficient in their efforts to 
 
 repair the national infrastructure. But this is at least the fourth massive wave of cruise missile strikes against, particularly, the electrical 
 
 infrastructure, the beginning of winter, effectively, and no doubt the Russians will continue to cripple Ukraine's ability to look after its 
 
 people. 
 
MACFARLANE:  Sam, your report there, a stark reminder of how Russians are feeling at the stage in the war, and the resistance that they're willing to 
 
 show. Thank you very much for that. 
 
Well, this Russian assault on critical infrastructure is also affecting Ukraine's neighbor, Moldova. Officials say more than half of the country 
 
 has lost power. We saw similar park cuts across the border last week after Ukrainian energy facilities -- not to this extent. It's the first time a 
 
 neighboring country has been so directly affected since Russia invaded Ukraine nine months ago. 
 
Now, Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid find those responsible for a double bombing in Jerusalem, calling them heinous terrorists. Explosive devices 
 
 went off at two bus stops Wednesday, about 30 minutes apart. A 15 year old boy was killed in the first blast. Hundreds of mourners gathered for his 
 
 funeral hours later. Police say there hasn't been a coordinated attack like this in Jerusalem in years. They believe it was carried out by a well 
 
 organized cell. 
 
Let's get more now from CNN's Hadas Gold, joining us live from Jerusalem. 
 
Hadas, what are we learning about who might have been responsible for the attacks? 
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT:  So far, there's been no claim of responsibility by any militant group. Israeli authorities are not yet 
 
 pointing the finger at who they think may have carried out this attack that injured more than 14 people, including that boy who is on his way to 
 
 school. Among those injured, two American citizens. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Sirens ringing out during rush hour after a double bombing shook Jerusalem Wednesday morning. 
 
 A 15-year-old student was killed, and more than 14 injured and what authorities are calling a suspected coordinated combined terror attack. The 
 
 first explosion captured on CCTV footage, widely spread on social media, rocking a bus station on one of the main entrances to the city. The blast 
 
 so strong, debris and pockmarks reaching past three lanes of traffic. 
 
Authorities believe a bag or package was placed at the bus stop around 7:00 a.m., and was likely detonated remotely. The first blast killing the 
 
 teenage boy, a Canadian Israeli citizen, who is a student at a religious school, injuring at least 11 others. A second blast occurred not far from 
 
 the first, around half an hour later, at the city's remote junction, likely injuring three people. 
 
A spokesman for first responders at the same telling CNN the injuries inflicted shut the hallmarks of terror. 
 
RAPHAEL POCH, SPOKESPERSON, UNITED HATZALAH INTERNATIONAL:  There was shrapnel, nails, ball bearings, things like that, which are very common to 
 
 placing bombs that detonate for the sake of terror. They were definitely a factor as well. 
 
GOLD:  The incident, reminiscent of the style of attacks carried out in the Second Intifada, organized, and technically sophisticated. 
 <br>[17:10:03]
 
POCH:  This is something very tragic. It's something we haven't seen in a very long time. We hope it doesn't come back to become a routine, or 
 
 regular situation. 
 
GOLD:  Israel's Prime Minister Yair Lapid also noting the development. 
 
YAIR LAPID, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  This event is different from what we've seen in recent years. An extensive intelligence 
 
 effort is now underway that will lead us to find these heinous terrorists, those behind them, and those who provided them with weapons.
 
GOLD:  As Israeli police search for suspect, the man pushing to become public security minister in the incoming government arrived at the scene. 
 
The far-right leader, Itamar Ben-Gvir, calling for sweeping security measures in response. 
 
ITAMAR BEN-GVIR, JEWISH POWRE PARTY LEADER:  Charging the price for the terror means checking where these terrorists came from, reaching the 
 
 villages, whether they're in Israel or Judea and Samaria, imposing a curfew, going from house to house, and searching for weapons, and bringing 
 
 back deterrence and governance. 
 
GOLD:  A deadly escalation in what is already been one of the most violent years in this region since the days of second intifada, as fears grow as 
 
 this attack will bring more. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
GOLD (on camera):  And, Christina, although no militant group has claimed responsibility for this attack, groups such as Hamas, and Hezbollah have 
 
 praised the attack. Meanwhile, the Israeli authorities have placed a gag order on Israeli media from reporting any further developments into the 
 
 investigation of who is behind this attack. They intend to do this for fear that reports on their investigation could tip off the people behind it. 
 
And so far, we've also just learned that Israeli authorities are closing in one of the border cross points between the West Bank and Israel near Jenin, 
 
 which has become a militant stronghold in the past year or so, Christina. 
 
MACFARLANE:  Interesting. I know you'll continue to keep cross this for us. Hadas, thanks very much for now. 
 
Investigators are trying to learn why a man shot and killed six people inside a Walmart in the U.S. state of Virginia. At least six others were 
 
 injured after opening fire on Tuesday night. The man took his own life. Sources tell CNN the gunman was a manager at this store. 
 
The U.S. has had more than 600 mass shootings this year. This is according to the Gun Violence Archive, which tracks the attacks. 
 
Now, the U.N. Human Rights Council will hold an emergency session on Iran Thursday. The country has arrested as many as 14,000 protesters. At least 
 
 1000 have been charged, and at least six have received death sentences. Iranian lawmakers have been calling for protesters to be taught, quote, a 
 
 good lesson to deter others who would threaten the authority of the Iranian government. 
 
CNN's Jomana Karadsheh is live for us from Istanbul tonight with more.
 
Jomana, I know you've been speaking to one protester about their relentless determination to keep going. What have they been saying? 
 
JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  You know, Christina, you and I have been discussing this for more than two months now. The Iranian regime has 
 
 been using all the same old brutal tactics to try and crush these protests. Hundreds of people have been killed. As you mentioned hundreds have been 
 
 arrested. Many say that they've been tortured and constantly stopped by the authorities. And you got six protesters so far who have been sentenced to 
 
 death. 
 
But none of this seems to be working. None of this seems to be stopping the protesters. What it seems to be doing is making people angrier, more 
 
 determined to continue protesting and risk their lives for regime change. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KARADSHEH (voice-over):  Iranians have been risking it all for freedom, to break free of the shackles of a repressive regime, its brutality and 
 
 bullets only fueling the anger of those on the streets, making them more defiant than ever. 
 
IRANIAN DOCTOR AND PROTESTER:  I know as long as the Islamic Republic is ruling the country, I couldn't do my duty. 
 
KARADSHEH:  This doctor, who are not identifying for safety reasons, was one of hundreds of medical professionals who gathered in Tehran last month 
 
 for a demonstration organized by their council. It was violently broken up. Doctors tell CNN at least one person was killed. Many injured, including 
 
 one shot in the eyes and blinded. 
 
IRANIAN DOCTOR AND PROTESTER:  As soon as I arrived there, the area was full of all kind of forces. Plain clothes forces was too much and they 
 
 literally shoot everyone that was walking on the sidewalk of the street. I have bruises, multiple bruises, in front of my body and back, and all of 
 
 them was above my waist. But, I saw injuries with batons and they beat a lot, electric shocks.
 
KARADSHEH:  Just for going out and protesting. You could go to jail or get killed. 
 
IRANIAN DOCTOR AND PROTESTER:  It's not just death. It literally could be worse -- we wish they'd kill us on the street rather than they arrest us.
 <br>[17:15:06]
 
KARADSHEH:  Because of all the horrors in detention facilities. All these risks, threats to you and your family, that's not stopping you and others. 
 
IRANIAN DOCTOR AND PROTESTER:  Of course not. They killed more than 1,500 in three days, in less than a week, about two years ago. We know it could 
 
 happen, and all of us, we will continue. 
 
There's no other way. We came from a long journey, and we realize the Islamic Republic cannot change, and don't want to change. It is our duty to 
 
 our next generation to fight it, and hopefully, change it. 
 
KARADSHEH:  Only Iranians can change it. This protester and others say. But they believe the international community can do more than just watch, 
 
 condemn, and announce symbolic sanctions. 
 
IRANIAN DOCTOR AND PROTESTER:  They could close Islamic Republic ambassadors, the United Nations, UNICEF, pay more attention. We need actual 
 
 action. The most important question is, are they willing to do that or not? To stand on the right side of history or not?
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
KARADSHEH (on camera):  And, Christina, the U.N. Human Rights Council will convene a special section on Iran tomorrow in Geneva. Iranians around the 
 
 world, human rights advocates and groups are urging member states to take urgent action, and to vote to establish an independent investigative and 
 
 accountability mechanism that will ensure they say that the perpetrators of these horrors in Iran are held accountable for their crimes. What we're 
 
 seeing now, they say, as the result of decades of impunity that must come to an end. 
 
MACFARLANE:  Yeah. I would certainly be an important state. Jomana, things very much, Jomana, front tonight. We'll continue to cover this tomorrow, as 
 
 Jomana says. Now, at the World Cup, the German team is striking back against the FIFA ban ahead of their 2 to 1 loss to Japan. Germans put their 
 
 hands over their mouths during the pre-game photo. I'm sure you've seen the picture. It was in protest after FIFA said players will be yellow carded if 
 
 they wore "OneLove" armbands opposing discrimination. 
 
Germany's interior minister was in the crowd, and she did wear the armband, you could see it there. 
 
"WORLD SPORT's" Don Riddell is in Doha following the story, joining me now.
 
Good to see you, Don. I know you were at that came. Clearly, FIFA have been coming under a lot of fire for that decision not to allow players to wear 
 
 the "OneLove" bans. But how much did this for a public German protest -- more pressure on the governing body? 
 
DON RIDDELL, CNN WORLD SPORT:  Hey, Christina. I think what FIFA have done is really poor gasoline onto the fire. And there was speculation that 
 
 perhaps the German captain Manuel Neuer would wear the armband regardless. He didn't. 
 
So, instead, we had this moment of silence that was so loud that it quickly echoed all the way through the world. A lot of fans in the stadium missed 
 
 it when it happened because it was far away and it was so quick, but as the game was underway, pictures emerged. And then, of course, the conversation 
 
 began. 
 
The fans I would set closely to, we're all for it. There are very impressed, very proud of those players for doing that. One must wonder how 
 
 that null will influence other players and other teams in the days to come. 
 
Of course, by the end of the game, it was the German fans who've been silenced. Incredible comeback from Japan. We'll be talking about that 
 
 shortly in "WORLD SPORT". 
 
MACFARLANE:  Yeah. We're very much looking forward to seeing that. Don live there from Doha, thanks very much for now, Don. 
 
All right. Still to come, the death toll from Indonesia's earthquake rises. A child survives today's buried beneath the wreckage. We hear from the 
 
 survivors.
 
Plus, Jair Bolsonaro, not leaving without a fight. Brazil's outgoing president challenges the results of last month's election. That story, 
 
 next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[17:22:14]
 
MACFARLANE:  The death toll from Monday's powerful earthquake in Indonesia West Java Province, has risen to 271. Over a third of the victims were 
 
 children. This was the moment a six-year-old boy was pulled alive from the wreckage, surviving two days under the debris, next to his grandmother's 
 
 body. Authorities say 40 people are still missing, and more than 60,000 are displaced. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SITI HAMIDAH, EARTHQUAKE VICTIM (through translator):  Everything was destroyed. My house, my neighbor's house, everything is gone. Thankfully, 
 
 we all survived. My nephew's head was split open. But he was able to get medical support right away. 
 
There are still so many things we need. I have one year old, and it's difficult to get children's necessities here, like diapers, food, and 
 
 clothing for my baby. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  The evacuation will take time. We're still using the hand tools. That's our main challenge right now. 
 
 We're searching through rubble with small hand tools. We're waiting for big equipment to arrive. 
 
DR. SURYA, HIEAD OF FIELD HOSPITAL (through translator):  The hospitals are overcrowded. So we need to intervene and create this makeshift hospital. 
 
 Otherwise, they'll be many patients that we neglected. Now, we're trying to tend to as many as we can. 
 
(EDND VIDEO CLIP) 
 
MACFARLANE:  All right. Let's take a look at some of the other key stories making international impact today. Authorities in Haizhu district in 
 
 China's Guangzhou City have extended a COVID-19 lockdown for five more days. The district has been under strict lockdown since November 5th, 
 
 prompting residents to protest against the restrictions. Videos of those protests have gone viral on social media across the world. 
 
The Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon has expressed disappointment after the U.K.'s Supreme Court rejected the Scottish government's bid for 
 
 another independence referendum. The court ruled another referendum would only be possible after approval from the U.K. parliament. Sturgeon also 
 
 said the Scottish national party is not abandoning routes to independents. 
 
To Brazil, now, where outgoing President Jair Bolsonaro's party has launched a petition challenging the results of October's election. 
 
 Bolsonaro narrowly lost a runoff vote against Luis Inacio Lula de Silva, who is due to take office in January.
 
Well, joining me now to discuss, is Stefano Pozzebon.
 
Stefano, just explain why Bolsonaro is bringing this claim, and what response there has been from the Lula camp? 
 
STEFANO POZZEBON, JOURNALIST:  Yes. The claim from Bolsonaro's party is quite serious. They are alleging that a series of electronic voting 
 
 machines that were dating back from older than before 2020 presented irregularities. 
 <br>[17:25:05]
 
And because of that, they've requested the electoral authority to displace the votes cast through those electronic machines. Just to give a bit of 
 
 context, Christina, we're talking about of 58 percent of the electronic voting machines that were used in the first round and second round of these 
 
 elections. 
 
But, the devil is in the details. And the Brazilian party of Jair Bolsonaro presented the request that only to dismiss the votes used in the second 
 
 round which is the round that Bolsonaro lost against Lula. 
 
And the first round, which is where the party obtained its best results at the legislative election. Because of that discrepancy, asking, perhaps, to 
 
 dismiss the results, of the second half of the match not the first half of the match. The supreme electoral authority of Brazil dismissed the claims 
 
 saying that if they wanted to appeal the decision, it would have to be an appeal on both decisions. 
 
I think, Christina, what we're looking at here is really the losing side complaining about the results for weeks after the referee blew the final 
 
 whistle, just to -- as we're talking about football these days, and basis show of that is that this morning, Luis Inacio Lula Da Silva, who is the 
 
 upcoming president elect, tweeted a photo of his transitional team holding meetings in Brasilia to discuss how the cabinet will look once he will take 
 
 office on January 1st. 
 
Nobody is disputing the fact that Lula has won will -- eventually take power in Brazil on January 1st. It's more Bolsonaro just giving more air to 
 
 these innuendos and doubts without real proof -- Christina. 
 
MACFARLANE:  Yeah, it'll be interesting to see, if this goes anywhere. 
 
Stefano Pozzebon for us live tonight, thank you very much. 
 
And that was THE GLOBAL BRIEF. Thank you for watching. 
 
"WORLD SPORT" with Don is up next with more from the World Cup. And with that, we will leave you with scenes of utter joy in the streets of Tokyo 
 
 after Japan's shock upset of Germany.
