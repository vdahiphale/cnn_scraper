ANNA COREN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hello and welcome to our viewers all around the world. I'm Anna Coren live from Hong Kong. Ahead on CNN NEWSROOM.
 
Russia is President admits to serious challenges in his war on Ukraine, as Moscow continues to push its unfounded dirty bomb claims.
 
Britain's new leader vows to unify his party's turmoil and tackle the country's economic crisis. They'll start explaining how in the coming hours during his first prime minister's questions in Parliament.
 
Plus, 40 days after a young woman died in the custody of Iran's morality police. Anti-government protests are growing louder and spreading.
 
It's 9:00 a.m. in Moscow where there is yet another indication of the trouble Russian troops are facing in the war in Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin has told his newly formed coordination council to speed up their decision making as the invasion enters its ninth month. He's also demanding faster production of efficient and modern military equipment.
 
Meanwhile, at the U.N. Russia's deputy ambassador is discussing what Russia calls a potential disaster that could threaten the entire Earth. Moscow is circulating claims that Ukraine is planning to use a dirty bomb and blame Russia. Ukraine calls that a pure lie. It says U.N. nuclear experts will visit Ukraine to disprove the allegation. Western nations are also sounding the alarm saying Russia's false claim could be a pretext to escalate the war.
 
U.S. President Joe Biden had this morning.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Russia would be making an incredibly serious mistake were it to use a tactical nuclear weapon. I'm not guaranteeing you that it's a false flag operation yet, don't know. But it would be a serious, serious mistake.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COREN: -- London where CNN's Clare Sebastian is tracking the latest developments. Clare, the Russians began these accusations of a dirty bomb on the weekend without providing any evidence. Is Russia bluffing or searching for a pretext to unleash such an attack?
 
CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: You know, and it's just not clear yet what exactly they're planning but they are doubling, tripling down on this story, this dirty bomb allegation that becomes ever more elaborate. What is clear, though, is that in this war, so far, only one party has actually openly threatened to use nuclear or radioactive weapons and that is Russia. And what is also clear is that they are ramping up this sort of psychological pressure on the west.
 
It's a long-time tactic of Russia to sort of alongside military activity use what it's called active measures try to sort of sow chaos and confusion, influence public opinion. And I think that's why we see this allegation around Ukraine allegedly building a dirty bomb become ever more elaborate. The letter that Russia circulated at the U.N. for this closed security council meeting, said that Ukraine was allegedly going to use -- spend fuel from its civilian nuclear power plants.
 
The testing systems were already in place that it was allegedly going to do this with the support of the west and that it was Ukraine planning a sort of false flag operation to try to frame Russia for this. So they are not backing away from this. Meanwhile, though, a U.K. deputy ambassador at the U.N. called this pure Russian disinformation. And it is still worth noting that the Pentagon said yesterday, reiterating what we've heard from Western officials that there is no evidence as of yet that Russia has actually done anything concrete to prepare to use any kind of nuclear or radioactive weapon. But this is something they are closely monitoring, Anna.
 
COREN: Clare, what are we hearing from the Russian president?
 
SEBASTIAN: Yes. So he spoke to a meeting of this new coordinating council that Russia has set up to essentially manage the home front in this war to do what it can to sort of support the military operation. This was set up in a decree last week. A meeting really, I think designed to show to the Russian people still reeling from the shock of this mobilization that they are they're in control of the situation.
 <br>[02:05:01]
 
Really though it sort of had the opposite effect, you know, he talked about how they need to do more to cut back on bureaucracy to move quicker to increase production of equipment and weapons, and things like that. Take a listen to a portion of what he had to say.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA (through translator): But now we also need to address that at a faster pace, the issues related to ensuring the needs of the special military operations and dealing with the economic restrictions that we have encountered which are without any exaggeration unprecedented. (END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEBASTIAN: Reference there at the end to the economic sanctions that Russia is under which we know one of the most immediate and serious effects of which had been to cripple Russia's industry. Its ability to produce all kinds of things including weapons industry that was reliant on western parts and machinery which are now of course banned from being exported to Russia. So, an admission from President Putin that things are perhaps not as easy as he would like, but also trying to project the sense of control over a situation that we know has been fairly chaotic for Russia.
 
COREN: And Clare, finally, Ukraine's request, the U.N. nuclear watchdog, the IAEA will revisit Ukrainian sites in the coming days following the dirty bomb claim. What more do we know?
 
SEBASTIAN: Yes. So Ukraine, as it says invited inspectors from the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, the IAEA to come to specifically two sites that Russia has named as being involved in the building of this dirty bomb to provide independent verification to show in the words of the Ukrainian foreign minister that they have nothing to hide. Worth noting, though, Anna as well, that the IAEA has been very active in Ukraine.
 
The head of the IAEA has visited multiple times, they've been monitoring the situation at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant which has been in the hands of Russian forces since the beginning of the war. And so far, they have not noticed anything untoward in terms of any preparation for radioactive weaponry in Ukraine. But this is something that Ukraine wants to do to try to debunk the Russian claim that it's now so heavily circulating.
 
COREN: Clare Sebastian, we really appreciate the context. Joining us from London. Thank you. Well, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Ukraine has not received a single cent towards its fast recovery plan. It was set up to rebuild hospitals, schools, transport and power plants. He spoke via video link to an international conference on Ukraine's reconstruction. Mr. Zelenskyy says more than a third of Ukraine's energy sector has been destroyed by Russian attacks. 
 
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz also called for a new Marshall Plan at the conference, arguing Ukraine's recovery will be a challenge for generations.
 
Well, cause for the rebuilding efforts come at a pivotal moment on the battlefield. Ukraine's military says Russia is preparing for a potential retreat from the city of Kherson. Well, CNN cannot confirm that. Our team was able to travel to her son's front lines with a Ukrainian reconnaissance unit. Fred Pleitgen has this report.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): En route to the front in one of the most active areas of the brutal war in Ukraine with a rocket artillery team taking aim at Vladimir Putin's forces. They're called Kherson (ph) and use light trucks with missile pods mounted on the bed. The rockets carry a message of retribution. This one signed on behalf of a fallen soldier for (INAUDIBLE) from the which, it says.
 
TARAS, UKRAINED ARMED FORCES (through translator): Our vehicle is very effective because we can set up quickly fire and get away again.
 
PLEITGEN: Now they're aiming at Russian positions several miles away.
 
But Russia's artillery is also dangerous and could fire back fast. It's not safe, he scream. 
 
PLEITGEN (on camera): We have to get out of here faster. We have to get out of here as fast as possible because the Russians might target the position after they got hit by the salvo from our rockets.
 
PLEITGEN (voice over): Their key to accuracy comes from the air. The drone scopes out the target and then watches as the artillery hits a Russian military repair shop, the unit says.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): We are the eyes of the unit. We do reconnaissance and then make sure the target gets hit.
 
PLEITGEN: The Russians are under such pressure they've started evacuating tens of thousands of people from Kherson. And the Ukrainians believe Moscow is making its unfounded claims about key of preparing to use a so called dirty bomb because Russia's  troops are pinned down in this area. Kherson's commander believes it's only a matter of time before they oust Vladimir Putin's army from here.
 <br>[02:10:02]
 
TARAS: By the end of the year we believe Kherson will be under Ukrainian flags.
 
PLEITGEN: And they hope their unit will make a small difference in the battle for Kherson. 
 
Fred Pleitgen, CNN in the Kherson region, Ukraine.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COREN: Well, Russian attacks have destroyed much of Ukraine's power grid and Ukraine's prime minister is asking for billions of dollars in foreign aid to help his country get through the winter.
 
According to the U.N., there are more than seven million Ukrainian refugees across Europe. Ukraine's deputy prime minister has asked them not to return during the colder months so they don't further strain the electrical grid. For now Ukrainians are doing what they can to prepare. These volunteers are making woodstoves residents of a village near the frontlines.
 
Well, Britain's new prime minister says the U.K. support for Ukraine remains as strong as ever. The pledge for continued solidarity came during a phone call between Rishi Sunak and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Both leaders agreed to write a new chapter in their country's relations.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): I believe that the partnership between our countries and the already traditional British leadership in the defense of democracy and freedom will be further strengthened. Ukraine and Britain have achieved the best relations so far, but there is still potential to increase our cooperation to bring more benefits to our societies.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COREN: In London, Rishi Sunak is beginning his first full day as the British government's new leader and he will face a grilling from lawmakers during his first prime minister's questions in Parliament.
 
Mr. Sunak was greeted by mostly cheers as he arrived at 10 Downing Street for the first time as prime minister on Tuesday. He's Britain's third prime minister in just seven weeks. And he's vowing to steer the country out of crisis and fix the mistakes of his predecessor Liz Truss, who stepped down after just 45 days in office.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
RISHI SUNAK, PRIME MINISTER OF BRITAIN: Some mistakes were made, and I have been elected as leader of my party and your prime minister, in part to fix them. And that work begins immediately. I will place economic stability and confidence at the heart of this government's agenda.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COREN: Mr. Sunak's new cabinets includes many familiar faces, including Jeremy Hunt, who will remain as Britain's finance minister. Another notable appointment is Suella Braverman. Back is home secretary after days -- just days after she resigned under Truss.
 
Well, CNN's Max Foster takes a closer look at Britain's new prime minister. His rise to the top and what he's pledging to do next.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SUNAK: Right now, our country is facing a profound economic crisis.
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN ROYAL CORRESPONDENT (through translator): Britain's new prime minister, Rishi Sunak, the first person of color and first Hindu to hold the position. Clear on why he was chosen to lead.
 
SUNAK: This will mean difficult decisions to come.
 
FOSTER: The former hedge fund manager steered the United Kingdom through the pandemic as finance minister with catchy spending initiatives such as eat out to help out. Now the 42-year-old, Britain's youngest prime minister in more than 200 years, says he's ready to lead Britain into the future.
 
At Buckingham Palace on Tuesday, King Charles III gave him the go ahead to form a new government.
 
SUNAK: I pledge that I will serve you with integrity and humility. And I will work day in, day out to deliver for the British people.
 
FOSTER: His pledge perhaps a dig at the scandal ridden Boris Johnson, who he famously served under as finance minister before helping topple his premiership by resigning. But man of the people Sunak is not much has been made of his immense wealth and privileged background. He studied at the exclusive private Winchester College, Oxford and then Stanford Universities.
 
SUNAK: -- friends who are in a working class, but I'm not working class but I mix and match.
 
FOSTER: In this clip of a young Sunak in 2001 BBC documentary doing him no favors after it later went viral. Sunak has also been scrutinized over the non-domicile tax arrangements of his wife, Akshata Murthy. The daughter of an Indian billionaire. A tax status she said was entirely legal, whilst adding she would renounce his advantages. The couple this year appeared on the Sunday Times Rich List of the U.K.'s 250 wealthiest people with an estimated joint net worth of 730 million pounds, $826 million.
 <br>[02:15:14]
 
Now Sunak has the job of leading Britain despite soaring inequality, and a severe cost of living crisis. His predecessor Liz Truss lasted just 45 days in office. Sunak can only hope for better. Max Foster, CNN, London.

COREN: Well, after months in Russian detention, American basketball star Brittney Griner asked for clemency from a Russian appeals court on Tuesday.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRITTNEY GRINER, U.S. CITIZEN DETAINED IN RUSSIA: I've been here almost eight months and people with more severe crimes have gotten less than what I was given.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COREN: But the court largely upheld the Olympic gold medalist nine- year prison sentence on drug charges. The U.S. says it's working to free the WNBA star but if nothing changes, Griner could be on her way to a penal colony. Matthew Chance has the latest developments.
 
MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, the outcome for Brittney Griner was not good. She appeared in that courtroom outside of Moscow by video conference. She didn't appear in person. And she made an impassioned plea to the judge to reduce her sentence. And then she did that by apologizing again for what she'd done. She admitted her guilt again, but said it was so hard for her essentially to paraphrase her to be away from her family. And she said that other people should she had seen committed much more serious crimes had received much, much, you know, less of a prison sentence, much reduced sentences. But none of that emotional plea seems to have had any impact on the Russian judge. The judge upheld the conviction, a guilty verdict for Brittney Griner for smuggling drugs essentially into the country. Remember, she was caught with a tiny quantity, less than a gram of cannabis oil in her luggage when she -- when she came into Russia back in February.
 
And he also basically upheld the sentence as well, they did reduce it a little bit by a couple of months. So instead of serving nine years now she'll be expected to serve 8-1/2 years. So it's not much consolation there. The lawyers on behalf of Brittney Griner have said they're surprised and devastated that this -- that this has happened, they were expecting a much bigger reduction of the sentence.
 
I spoke to them last week actually in Moscow. And that's what they told me. They're now unfortunately kind of at the end of the road legally, it's not clear whether they'll be able to appeal again to a Russian court. And so now what happens is that Brittney Griner will eventually be taken away from her pretrial detention center outside Moscow where she is now and moved to a more permanent location, a penal colony elsewhere in Russia, it could be close to Moscow, it could be further away.
 
And of course, the conditions in those Russian penal colonies leaves much to be desired to say the least. And so perhaps the worst sort of moments for Brittney Griner are still potentially ahead of her. So not a good day at all in terms of news for that American basketball star. 
 
Matthew Chance, CNN, London.
 
COREN: CNN's Wolf Blitzer spoke with one of Griner's lawyers on Tuesday. He asked if she has any other legal avenues.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MARIA BLAGOVOLINA, BRITTNEY GRINER'S LAWYER: There is next step, which is called cassation or the second appeal. But normally we do not expect much from this legal step. So, I mean, Brittney definitely hopes for this hope to happen. Yes.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COREN: The lawyer also says Griner continues to hope to be released in a prisoner swap. President Joe Biden says the United States is in constant contact with Russia in an attempt to get Greiner and Paul Whelan back home, but he admits the response hasn't been very positive.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
NED PRICE, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN: What we saw this morning was a reminder that this process has been a sham from the start. Today has been another sad day for justice in Russia. I use that term justice very loosely, of course, because justice has eluded this case from the start. The rule of law has eluded this case from the start.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COREN: The WNBA commissioner issued a statement saying "Today's decision, while unfortunate was not unexpected and Brittney Griner remains wrongly detained. We greatly appreciate the ongoing efforts of the administration and U.S. Department of State and leading the negotiations. It is time to bring this case to an end and bring Brittney Griner home.
 
Well, protesters in Iran are still pressing for more freedoms and regime change.
 <br>[02:20:02]
 
Forty days after a young woman died in the custody of the country's morality police. Those details just ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
COREN: Full cries and anger and frustration are getting louder across Iran as anti-government protesters call for regime change after a young woman Mahsa Amini died in police custody 40 days ago. Videos provided by pro-reform activist outlet IranWire show students of a Tehran University chanting freedom in a yard that appears to be on campus.
 
And a Kurdish rights group has released this video showing what appears to be security forces in Mahsa Amini his hometown on Tuesday night.
 
And Norway rights group says more than 200 people have been killed across 21 of Iran's 31 provinces since the government crackdown began last month.
 
Well, CNN's Nada Bashir is following the developments from London and has this report.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN INTERNATIONAL REPORTER (voice over): From the streets to the classroom, at least a dozen universities in Iran now gripped by anti regime demonstrations. Students are at the forefront of a protest movement which is posing the biggest threat to the Iranian regime in years.
 
In Tehran government spokesperson Ali Bahadori Jahromi was met with crowds chanting against the regime.
 
The familiar rallying cry of women, life, freedom, followed by some calling for the spokesman to "get lost," forcing him to abandon his talk ahead of schedule.
 
And in the holy city of Qom, another frosty reception for the government official. Their message, we do not want a murderous guest at our university. But the movement has also spread to the country's high schools. Young girls seen here bravely defying the regime strict dress code. Some even joining the call for regime change. But just as protests continue to gain momentum, so does the regime's brutal crackdown.
 
College students in Hamadan seen here, mourning the death of their classmate Megina Abdul Meleke (ph). According to Human Rights Group Hengaw, the 21-year-old was killed by Iran security forces during the protest. Hengaw alleges she was beaten by a baton, sustaining injuries to her head and skull. The Iran semi-official Farsnews Agency denies those reports. Another name, another life. Added to the growing list of those being hailed as martyrs.
 <br>[02:25:00]
 
Each death only galvanizing the country's youth in their growing fight for change.

COREN: Nahid Siamdous is an assistant professor of Middle East and Media Studies at the University of Texas. She joins us now from Austin, Texas. Nahid, great to have you with us. One of the key slogans we are hearing from these brave and courageous activists is woman, life, liberty. Please tell us the meaning and significance of that.
 
NAHID SIAMDOUST, FORMER MIDDLE EAST JOURNALIST: As you know, these recent protests started with the killing of Mahsa Jina Amini in the custody of the morality police, she was on a visit from Kurdistan. She's Kurdish and at her burial, people started chanting the Kurdish chant, Jin Jian Azadi. The chant comes from -- the slogan comes from the Kurdish context of the women's liberation movement there.
 
And it was instantly adopted by Persian speakers in the country as Zan, Zendegi, Azadi. Really to encapsulate that, you know, unless there's liberty for women, there won't be liberty for anyone. And this is, you know, a meaning that it's taken sort of a couple of, you know, more than four decades for Iranians to really come around. It's -- the sentiment has been there. The women's movement in Iran has been strong for at least 100 years.
 
But, you know, people have reached this point where they've understood that unless there's liberty for women, everybody else in the country can also be infantilized and patronized.
 
COREN: Yes. As you say, this was prompted by the death of Mahsa Amini. Back in mid September, it has grown from a protest about the hijab, obviously, about her death but about women's rights to, as you say, universal rights of all Iranians. I mean, these protests have become all encompassing.
 
SIAMDOUST: That's right. You know, this was the lightning rod, you know, the killing of Mahsa Amini. It was really the lightning rod for bringing all these different strands of grievances that have been brewing for many, many years together. And for Iranians really to have gotten to this point where they realized that no other paths have worked. The paths of, you know, reforms, the paths of dialogue that no matter what happens and how they protest, the state is unwilling to really compromise and negotiate with the people. 
 
And so, what we see now are these very defined protests that are no longer asking you for negotiations with the state, but for the downfall of the -- of the entire system.
 
COREN: Which is quite extraordinary, because as you say, I mean, these protests come from decades of repression. Iranians that I speak to and obviously, you're very much in touch with people back in Iran say the time for talk is over. But, you know, human rights groups is saying that thousands of people are arrested and that's probably a very conservative number, hundreds have been killed. I mean, what are you envisaging in the weeks, if not months ahead?
 
SIAMDOUST: More of the protests to go on and more of these very stark and violent crackdowns, and where this ultimately leads, is not exactly foreseeable at the moment but what we do see is that the nature of the protests has changed, the nature of the discourse has changed. And these are simply different protests and nobody on the streets, none of the slogans are people asking for, you know, for things to change from within.
 
These are very drastic and undefined chants. And it's hard to foresee, really, at this point, to be honest, where they will be going. What we've seen is that the state has been clamping down very hard. And yet, you know, the people on the streets, students, many of them very young ones, school, you know, school children, as well as university students are not backing down.
 
COREN: Do you think this is the beginning -- the end for the regime?
 
SIAMDOUST: I mean, that's certainly what the chants are calling for. And, you know, some of the graffiti that we see on the walls and the kinds of performative acts that we see, the dances the, you know, the unprecedented, you know, acts on the streets, that's what they're calling for but it's too soon to really call it that because, you know, the regime is very strong and -- but that's certainly what the protesters are projecting.
 
COREN: Nahid, from the people that you are speaking to back in Iran, what are they telling you? What are they telling you about their determination to continue protesting but also the fear that they must be feeling on a daily basis?
 
SIAMDOUST: It's a very dynamic situation at the moment. So there's both excitement and joy over the possibilities that could be but there's also a lot of fear. And people have seen that, you know, the security forces are not holding back, shooting at very young people and everybody, you know, they're not really discriminating. And so, it's a very dynamic moment in which no one's able to foresee what's going on. And I also have to tell you, you know, for some of the people in Iran, I mean, they're really asking us what's going on because the internet's shut down unless they're venturing out on the streets and unless they happen to be, you know, in places and in moments where certain acts are taking place where there's protests or, you know, smaller acts of defiance or graffiti spraying.
 <br>[02:30:00]
 
If they are not sort of encountering those as they go through their lives during the day, then they know a whole lot less than we do because from our vantage point, we're able to collect all these sorts of, you know, social media streams of the different videos that people are taking and collect them and see sort of the spread of a whole day.
 
Iranians and Iran, at the moment, have maybe an hour, two at most three hours of internet. It's random. They don't know when the internet is actually on. And so, they are quite cut off.
 
COREN:  We know the Iranian diaspora is very strong and no doubt inspiring those back in Iran. Nahid Siamdoust, we thank you for your time in your insight.
 
SIAMDOUST:  Thank you.
 
COREN:  Well, it's now been a year since the military coup in Sudan. Tens of thousands of pro-democracy protesters were back on the streets Tuesday, facing tear gas and stun grenades as they march towards the presidential palace in Khartoum.
 
A human rights group says that more than 100 have been killed in protests over the past year. The military takeover has halted Sudan's transition to democracy and plunged an economy already in crisis into further turmoil.
 
Weeks of devastating flooding have taking a heavy toll on Nigeria killing hundreds and displacing more than a million people. Now, some worry that the worst is yet to come and many Nigerians say the government isn't doing nearly enough to help them. That's next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
COREN:  The worst flooding that Nigeria has seen in a decade is putting many people at greater risk of cholera and other serious health dangers. And International Rescue Committee warns that more than a million children in the country's north could suffer from acute food insecurity this year. Our Larry Madowo has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover):  Communities still submerged nearly a month after the flooding began with no end in sight. Boats have become the only way to get around much of Bayelsa State in Southern Nigeria. The streets have turned to rivers driving entire communities away from their homes. Mama Obique (ph) takes us to what is left of her home, the water is still waist high. We have really suffered, she says, tell the government to help us.
 
MAMA OBIQUE (PH):  Again, tell them to come help us.
 
MADOWO (on camera):  Everything you own is here under the water and this is your house? 
 
MAMA OBIQUE (PH):  Yes. Everything.
 <br>[02:35:00]
 
MADOWO (voiceover):  Some are living rough on the streets, washing with this water, cooking with it and bathing in it.
 
MADOWO (on camera):  Even people's homes and businesses and livelihoods are already submerged, it's still raining and there is more expected. The Nigerian government is warning this could go until November, so even more of this.
 
MADOWO (voiceover):  This is Nigeria's worst flooding in a decade. Aniso Handy has remained in this house through it all.
 
ANISO HANDY, FLOOD VICTIM:  Nigerians are used to manage. If not, we would have all died. We have not seen this situation where people are not cared for. But Nigerians care for themselves. We are just like infants that have no father, no mother.
 
MADOWO (voiceover):  The feeling of abandonment runs deep here. The victims are disappointed with the Nigerian government's response which hasn't declared the flood a national emergency.
 
MAMA OBIQUE (PH):  We're not very comfortable. Another fear for (INAUDIBLE).
 
MADOWO (on camera):  We're next to the local cemetery, and residents have reported seeing bodies floating here in this water. This flood has displaced not just the living, but also the dead.
 
MADOWO (voiceover):  The floods have affected 33 of Nigeria's 36 states partly due to well above average rainfall. Bayelsa is among those cut off from the nation with major highways underwater. The situation has been exacerbated by poor drainage infrastructure and an overflowing dam in neighboring Cameroon. But with a warmer climate causing more intense rainfall, authorities have also blamed it on climate change, angering some Nigerians.
 
In this community though, there are more short-term consequences.
 
MADOWO (on camera):  So, you're worried about the children mostly? 
 
NDIA OKAZI, FLOOD VICTIM:  Yes, my children. They won't go to school again. No way. Now, that's (INAUDIBLE) me.
 
MADOWO (voiceover):  It is a tough life to navigate for humans and animals alike, but life must go on. Larry Madowo, CNN, Bayelsa State, Nigeria.

COREN:  Shocking scenes there. Well, a new report has found that even though governments and companies around the world are well aware of the damage caused by carbon pollution, the use of fossil has only increased.
 
The Lancet found nearly 80 percent of the governments in their reports were undermining efforts to reverse climate change by incentivizing the extraction and burning of fossil fuels. Researchers say continued dependence on coal, oil and gas will not only lead to increasing energy costs but also present in other health issues.
 
The U.N. secretary general says that the world's reliance on fossil fuels has spiraled out of control, adding, "the climate crisis is killing us. It is undermining not just the health of our planet, but the health of people everywhere."
 
Well, the head of JPMorgan Chase says he is more worried about geopolitics than a U.S. recession. Jamie Dimon and his comments came at a Future Investment Initiative which got underway Tuesday in the Saudi capital. The annual conference draws thousands of policymakers, investors and scholars.
 
CNN's Richard Quest is there and moderated a panel with top Wall Street bankers, many of whom focused on the risk posed by recent political developments around the world. Here's what Dimon had to say.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
Jamie Dimon, CEO, JPMORGAN:  Some very good news right now in the United States. People see it, consumers, businesses still spending, still lots of money, a lot of physical stimuluses. But there's a lot of stuff in the horizon which is bad. And could -- it doesn't necessarily, but could, put the United States in a recession. But that's not the most important thing for when we think about it, what matters right through that. I would worry much more about the geopolitics of the world today.
 
RICHARD QUEST, CNN BUSINESS ANCHOR:  You're worried about geopolitics. What side of the geopolitics particularly? 
 
DINOM:  I think the most important thing is the geopolitics was going to Russia, Ukraine, America, China, you know, the relationships of the western world and -- that would have to be far more concerning, whether it's mild or slightly severe recession.

COREN:  Recession fears are weighing down Google's core business, its parent company Alphabet has released its earnings report for the quarter. And Google's digital advertising revenues fell short of Wall Street expectations, growing 2.5 percent year over year, compare that to 43 percent growth a year ago. The broader downturn is also being felt by Microsoft. It posted a 14 percent decline in third quarter profits on Tuesday versus a year ago. Demand for personal computers is down, and Xbox revenues have also dipped. But Microsoft's net income of more than $17 billion for the quarter is still better than analysts expected.

COREN:  Up in flames. This is just one pair of Yeezy sneakers being torched by a man in Florida, protesting the business relationship between Adidas and Ye. The rapper, formerly known as Kanye West. Ye's recent string of antisemitic comments have prompted fans to burn their shoes, urging Adidas to cut ties with him as well.
 
Well, Danny Shiff says he spent tens of thousands of dollars on about 40 pairs of shoes, and has burned $15,000 worth so far. He plans to auction off the rest and donate the money to charities finding racism and antisemitism.
 
Well, many people got their wish on Tuesday after Adidas announced that they were ending a nearly 10-year relationship with Ye. They are the latest brand to dump the rapper after his offensive remarks, ending profitable relationships with him after years of growth and success. The sudden retreats have been enough for Forbes to take Ye off their billionaires list, claiming he's only worth about $400 million now. Ye had previously bragged Adidas could not get rid of him.

YE, RAPPER:  The thing about me and Adidas is like, I could literally say antisemitic -- and they can't drop me. I could say antisemitic things and Adidas can't not drop me. Now, what? 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COREN:  Well, other clothing brands like the Gap and Foot Locker have pulled all Yeezy merchandise from their shelves. The Gap says hate in any form is inexcusable and not in accordance with its values.
 
Well, thank you so much for joining us. I'm Anna Coren. World Sport is up next, and I'll be back in about 15 minutes with more of "CNN Newsroom."

GRASHEL:  We had water. We're getting wet and they brought us down food after we requested it. And then, after many questions that were asked, they finally decided that, besides myself, my wife, Sherry, the toddlers and the baby, there was no way in the world that we were going to be able to make it up. I've got back surgery scheduled. I've got -- my wife has got two artificial knees and is having trouble with those.
 
CAMEROTA:  And let me just point out, because we have a picture of this, there is an emergency staircase or stairs, I guess, 22 flights. And this is the picture of them, which is not comforting. Because basically, Sherry, describe for us what those stairs, 22 flights up, were like, what it would be like to climb those.
 
JIMENEZ:  Well, your footing would be set on a steel plank that was smaller than the size of a regular ladder. And one side had a hand rail that was completely open. There was no measure of protection from the stair to the top of the handrail. It was completely open. On the right side and on the left side, there was nothing, no handrail or anything at all.
 
CAMEROTA:  And why did it take the folks who run this elevator 31 hours to get you all out? 
 
JIMENEZ:  We -- I believe they did not want to call any emergency services. We were told -- we asked them to call for 911. We had no service whatsoever down there. So, there was no way for us to call anybody or use the phone. So, we had told them that we want them to call emergency services, the fire department, somebody to get us some help. And initially, they declined, saying that they would not come out because they have an escape route, which is the stairway within the shaft of the elevator.
 
GRASHEL:  But they originally told us that the Hualapai Mountain -- or the Hualapai Mountain but the Hualapai Fire Department had been called at 5:00. And they refused to come out because there was no medical emergency. They never called at 5:00.
 
JIMENEZ:  They never called about 12:00 when we -- when the smoke was there. We asked them to call and they never called. We kept insisting. Initially, they said they wouldn't because they wouldn't come out. Well, after several requests, they said they did call. And Peach Springs, which is the Hualapai tribe, declined to come out because there was no emergency medical condition that resulted in the need of their emergency services. Nobody was dying, basically or needs medical attention.
 
CAMEROTA:  Yes. But there was -- I mean, there could have been at any given moment, given that you had a five-month-old baby, you know, without food and a toddler and some compromised seniors. I just want you guys to know that we did call Grand Canyon Caverns for their response and their explanation. We have not heard back yet. But we will let you know when we do.
 
JIMENEZ:  Yes.
 
CAMEROTA:  Douglas and Sherry, we're just -- we're happy that you guys are OK. You made it out alive. But I know that that was pretty traumatic. But thanks so much for being on and sharing your story with us.
 
GRASHEL:  Well, there's a lot more to this story.
 
CAMEROTA:  Yes.
 
GRASHEL:  If you've got about an hour or so -- 
 
CAMEROTA:  Well, I don't, but I can tell that your phone will be ringing with a Hollywood producer at any moment, I'm sure. And you guys will have a prime-time movie to discuss everything that went on for those 31 hours. So, just consider this the start.
 
JIMENEZ:  Thank you.
 
CAMEROTA:  All right. Guys, thank you. Great to talk with you.
 
JIMENEZ:  All right.
 
GRASHEL:  All right.
 
JIMENEZ:  Thanks. Bye-bye.
 
CAMEROTA:  Thanks so much.
 
GRASHEL:  Bye.
 
COATES:  Oh, my gosh. Literally, my eyelash popped off. It was so -- they didn't want to stay on, they didn't want to be down there with them. They didn't want to be in my eye. I mean, I can't.
 
CAMEROTA:  I don't know if you could see that ladder, but the ladder -- it's a ladder.
 
COATES:  No.
 
CAMEROTA:  It's a ladder, basically without a railing up 22 floors. You are carrying a five-month-old, a two-year-old, it was impossible. They had to wait. And then, we have another picture of them actually having to hoist them up 22 stories in like, you know, a sort of hammock thing that they -- well, I don't know it's that one. But, anyway, it was intense.
 
COATES:  Unbelievable.
 
CAMEROTA:  And I think that Douglas is right, there's more to that story that they want to tell.
 
COATES:  Yes. There's more to that story, and more about how I will not be there. What would you do if you got stuck in Grand Canyon Caverns? Tweet us @AlisyCamerota and @thelauracoates. And someone come fix my eyelash too, because it did pop off. Use this #CNNSoundOff.
 
CAMEROTA:  Those are both emergencies.

COATES:  So, when is retirement not retirement? Because it's beginning to seem like a big trend of sports heroes that are retiring, and then Alisyn -- 
 
CAMEROTA:  Unretiring.
 
COATES:  -- unretiring. Of course, there is Serena Williams who announced at the U.S. Open, that she would "evolve away from tennis," only to tell the audience at a tech conference just last week, and I'm quoting here, "I'm not retired." And then, there's Tom Brady whose unretirement from the NFL may have, they say, cost him his marriage to Gisele Bundchen. Whether that's true or not, we'll see.
 
CAMEROTA:  I think it's very interesting that while much of the workforce is quiet quitting --
 
COATES:  Are they doing that?
 
CAMEROTA:  -- there is notable people who are unretiring. There's got to be a happy medium between quiet quitting and unretiring. Somewhere in there you have to be happy. But I do think it's interesting, also, you were saying that a lot of politicians are unretiring.
 <br>[02:55:00]
 
COATES:  Oh, yes. Are you kidding? Well, look at the governor's race in Florida, that's Charlie Crist -- 
 
CAMEROTA:  Charlie Crist, yes.
 
COATES:  -- who, by the way, unretired from the governor to then become a member of Congress to them become a gubernatorial candidate again. Then you have people like --
 
CAMEROTA:  Donald Trump.
 
COATES:  Or Joe Biden.
 
CAMEROTA:  And he's considering unretiring. And Joe Biden unretired.
 
COATES:  Joe Biden unretired again.
 
CAMEROTA:  Yes.
 
COATES:  I mean, what is it about the power? The idea is it just -- is it the public service notion?
 
CAMEROTA:  I don't think so.
 
COATES:  Is it the power? 
 
CAMEROTA:  Public service.
 
COATES:  Maybe. CAMEROTA:  I think it's that -- like with Serena and Tom Brady, I
 
 think it's that when you are so identified with something, it's your identity and it's really hard to know what you are after that and walk away from it.
 
COATES:  Well, and you're so good. I mean, it's not as if either of them are at the bottom of their game. It's -- we're talking about both in their own respects, the G.O.A.T.
 
CAMEROTA:  Yes, you're right. And so, why leave when you're still that good?
 
COATES:  I mean, well, why haven't you left because you're that good?
 
CAMEROTA:  I know. We can relate.
 
COATES:  There you go.
 
CAMEROTA:  OK.  Let us know what you think about all of that.
 
COATES:  Not about the G.O.A.T. It's not. Leave the G.O.A.T. alone.
 
CAMEROTA:  Meanwhile, two weeks out from election day. Major debates in the hotly contested races that could determine the balance of power in Congress and the major line of attack, well, one of them is crime. So, we are going to bring you the big moments on that topic, right after this.
