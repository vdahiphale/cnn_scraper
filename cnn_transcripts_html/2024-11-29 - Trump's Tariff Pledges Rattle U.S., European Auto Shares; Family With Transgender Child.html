JONATHAN HAIDT, SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGIST: It wasn't because of COVID. It began as soon as the kids got smart devices in school. Guess what? They stopped paying attention to the teacher and each other. They've started to feel more lonely at school since 2012. Every school that goes phone free says the same thing. We hear laughter in the hallways. Again, every school that bans phones loves it. 
 
ERICA HILL, CNN ANCHOR: Let me ask you about the role of adults here. Right? And I don't mean just the role of the parent. Right. But adults as we are modeling this behavior because I feel like it's probably rewired my brain too. I mean, I sit there doom scrolling on Instagram and then I have a moment where I say to myself, what am I doing? There's not even anything for me to look at. It was the same as it was three minutes ago. So shouldn't some of this also maybe apply to us? 
 
HAIDT: Well, you know, I and lawmakers are reluctant to tell adults what to do. As adults, we all feel overwhelmed by this, but we all went through puberty in the old world where we could pay attention to each other, we could look people in the eye. 
 
The key to keep your eye on is puberty. If we let young humans go through puberty, which is a massive rewiring of the brain, if you let that process happen guided by feedback on TikTok and Instagram, you're going to get bad results. What I see in students all over the place, what I see in my own students is it's very difficult for them to pay attention. It's hard for them to sit through a 75 minute class. I've been teaching for 40 years. It didn't used to be like that. 10 years ago, 15 years ago. 
 
HILL: Yes. It is important to see. Jonathan Haidt, really appreciate joining us this morning. Thank you. 
 
HAIDT: Thank you, Erica. 
 
HILL: Just ahead here, a remarkable glimpse inside the newly restored Notre Dame Cathedral five years after it was engulfed by flames. And one of the country's most popular grocery stores out with a major recall this morning of an everyday staple. The concern, salmonella. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[08:36:17]
 
OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: President elect Trump's promise of 25 percent tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada is sparking concern across many industries, including the auto industry. Joining me now is Brian Moody, senior editor at AutoTrader and Kelley Blue Book. Good to see you. 
 
So, you know, one aspect I think is really interesting is the U.S. government tracks what percentage of each car's parts is made domestically and none really exceeds 75 percent even for a broad definition like American made, which you know can also include Canadian made parts. I just wonder how you view the plan to potentially impose a 25 percent tariff on all goods coming from Mexico and Canada. 
 
BRIAN MOODY, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, AUTOTRADER: Well, it's likely that the Trump administration will keep the existing tariffs in place. Remember, the Biden administration just increased tariffs on electric vehicles and some other related type things in May of this year. They'll likely keep those. 
 
The problem is that when you said, as you stated correctly, when you start getting into the nitty gritty of the pieces and the parts. Like we don't have any fully Chinese electric vehicles here in the U.S. right now, but certainly many of the parts come from those countries. 
 
So that's going to be the difficulty. Politicians often say one thing, but when you get into the nitty gritty of how that's going to work out. It may look quite different than what we hear right now. 
 
JIMENEZ: And let's throw China into the mix because Trump also promised to increase tariffs on China an additional 10 percent beyond the existing measures. And as you mentioned, we don't import a lot of cars from China, but it's a major source of, you know, low price auto parts. How do you see that trading relationship differently than the ones with Mexico and Canada Outside of the formal USMCA? Of course. 
 
MOODY: Right. Of course. Canada and Mexico are top trading partners with us, and so we want to be careful when we're imposing tariffs on those countries. The goal is to limit the ability of China to get cars into or get products into the U.S. through those channels. The 10 percent tariff doesn't really have much to do with cars. It's a way of the government saying, hey, we want you to have a better handle on fentanyl and those types of things. 
 
It is possible that through some of these actions that the short term result will be an increase in car prices, at least new car prices for American consumers, although there's already downward pressure on new car prices because they remain high. And there's a huge gap between new car prices and used car prices. 
 
So, there's these two competing forces that will have to be worked out for this to be to the benefit of American consumers in the long term and in the short term. 
 
JIMENEZ: And you know, one of the things, as you mentioned in the short term, concerns about a price increase. There is an argument that all this tariff talk is just the beginning of a negotiation and posturing to sort of get a better deal out of our trading partners. 
 
MOODY: Sure.
 
JIMENEZ: I mean, I guess the broader question is the nature of our trading relationship with these countries built to withstand significant change like this or sudden change when a new administration comes in? 
 
MOODY: Right. I think that what's happening, and this is very similar to the voluntary export restriction that the Reagan administration did in the 70s where there was a rapid change. There's a rapid change in the marketplace. They don't want to eliminate it completely. They want to manage it to a degree where it's easy for American companies to catch up. 
 
So like you said, could there be a short term harm? Yes, there could. But the long term goal is kind of like electric cars in general. Right. They're expensive to begin with, but many people agree that the long term result is going to beneficial. In this case, you're right. It probably is a negotiating tactic because that's kind of what people do in politicians and political, you know, endeavors. 
 <br>[08:40:06]
 
They lead with something and then the reality on the back end is a little bit less harsh, maybe even more diplomatic. 
 
JIMENEZ: Well, speaking of those diplomatic efforts, Mexican -- the Mexican president has suggested Mexico would retaliate with counter tariffs. So I guess from a trade standpoint, how do counter tariffs change the dynamics of trade? And of course, what effect could that have on, you know, prices for folks who might be thinking of buying a car next year? 
 
MOODY: Yes, it could have a short term impact on prices, meaning that cars could be more expensive. But counter tariffs and tariffs of 100 percent that kind of thing, that's not likely going to be good for consumers other than it's going to protect American jobs. If you look at the Reagan administration example, what happened as a result was a lot of Japanese automakers brought the production inside this country and we see that now. Honda, Toyota, Nissan, many others making their cars inside this country. 
 
The same is likely true with some other countries that produce electric vehicles. They may want to produce them inside this country to eliminate the tariff. That would be the good that would come from it. It would be jobs and it would increase the tax base in all those local communities, such as where Hyundai and Kia are building cars. That would be the long term positive result. 
 
JIMENEZ: And more broadly here, I mean, I kind of alluded to it if you are. Obviously this is all happening at a policy level. It's all happening very high level. But it all of course affects people on the other side of the spectrum when you're thinking about buying. And so if you are talking to someone about buying or selling a car next year, are you telling them to keep a watchful eye on these stocks? I mean, how soon would a ripple effect actually hit what people see at dealerships? 
 
MOODY: Well, because we're talking about producing things in real time, it would have a delayed effect. So right now there's high incentives on new cars, meaning that it's between 7 and 10 percent depending on the segment that you can get that much of an incentive from the automaker. 
 
So right now is a good time to buy. Does it make sense to wait? That depends on your budget. But these types of things generally take a while before they start to impact the American consumer. So I would keep an eye on it, but I wouldn't be overly worried that tomorrow, all of a sudden, something catastrophic is going to happen. 
 
JIMENEZ: Yes, something to keep an eye on, indeed. Brian Moody, thanks for being here of AutoTrader and Kelley Blue Book. Thanks. 
 
MOODY: Yes.
 
HILL: When Missouri banned transgender Care for minors, one family left the state to find a place for their 12 year old transgender daughter. President-Elect Trump's promise though to roll back transgender rights has these parents now wondering whether their child will be able to get the healthcare she needs. Here's CNN's Gabe Cohen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
GABE COHEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: So what am I looking at here?
 
KATIE, TRANS CHILD: My pride flag. This shows to the world that I don't want to hide and pretend to be someone else. I want to be me.
 
SARAH HALUF, KATIE'S MOTHER: Our child should have the same rights as any other child because she's transgender doesn't make her any different.
 
COHEN (voice-over): Twelve-year-old Katie and her family moved across the country last year to flee state restrictions on their daughter's rights. At her parent's request, we're not showing her face and we're using an alternate name.
 
S. HALUF: I don't have the answer of why people hate her and have never met her. Where is Katie allowed to exist, how is she allowed to exist?
 
EREZ HALUF, KATIE'S FATHER: Is she allowed to exist?
 
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: We won't be changing your children's gender with their transgender craziness.
 
COHEN (voice-over): Transgender rights have become one of the biggest flashpoints in this country's culture wars, marked in many cases by flat out lies and conspiracies.
 
TRUMP: There are some places your boy leaves to school, comes back a girl.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Kamala supports taxpayer funded sex changes for prisoners.
 
COHEN (voice-over): Republicans spent more than $200 million on anti- trans ads before the election.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.
 
E. HALUF: This is 100 percent BS.
 
S. HALUF: It's sowing fear. And then by doing that, you're sowing hate and all of this comes back to people like our child. We thought that by leaving Missouri and coming to Maryland, that we would be safe. And now were being threatened with anti-trans legislation on a federal level.
 
COHEN (voice-over): At least 26 states, including Missouri, have passed restrictions on gender affirming care for minors.
 
S. HALUF: This was their final protest in Jefferson City. We did everything we could to fight this and there was nothing that we could do to change their minds.
 
We moved to Maryland to be able to access gender affirming care for Katie what that looks like is therapy services. It's clothing. It's haircuts. 
 <br>[08:45:06]
 
And at this age, it is a hormone blocker, to prevent her from going through puberty.
 
KATIE: This is my hormone blocker right here.
 
COHEN: Could that treatment be reversed at some point?
 
S. HALUF: Yes, absolutely. It's really a pause button. Katie gets more time to live in the body that she has now.
 
TRUMP: On day one, I will revoke Joe Biden's cruel policies on so- called gender affirming care.
 
COHEN (voice-over): Trump has promised federal restrictions on transgender rights, including far stricter rules about gender affirming care especially for minors.
 
One trans rights organization saw a nearly 700 percent increase in calls to their crisis hotline after the election.
 
COHEN: What would happen if your daughter didn't get that care?
 
S. HALUF: She would end up going through puberty and it would be traumatizing to her to see all of those things happen to her body.
 
COHEN: I know you get some treatment from doctors from other care. What would happen if you didn't get that?
 
KATIE: I would be upset and scared.
 
E. HALUF: In the LGBTQ community, the suicide rate is high for those who are not being supported by their caregivers.
 
S. HALUF: We want her to survive childhood.
 
COHEN (voice-over): So families like Katie's are trying to prepare for what's ahead, even drafting an asylum application.
 
S. HALUF: We have to start thinking about a backup plan.
 
E. HALUF: If push comes to shove, we will need to go north. We will go to Canada.
 
COHEN: What would it take for your family to say we need to leave this country?
 
S. HALUF: The federal health care ban would likely be the moment we know that it's time to leave here.
 
COHEN: What does this symbolize to you?
 
KATIE: Freedom and rights this proves that everybody has their own rights to be themselves.

HILL: And our thanks to Gabe Cohen for that piece. Well, this morning, we're introducing you to one of this year's top five CNN Heroes. Every year, nearly 1 million shelter animals in the U.S. are euthanized. Many are pets whose owners just couldn't find temporary care when they needed it. Well, now Stephen Knight is drawing on his own personal experience to change that. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
STEPHEN KNIGHT, CNN HERO: When somebody makes that decision to go into treatment, it's one of the bravest decisions they'll make.
 
Everything's going to be OK.
 
When people do need to go to rehab and they don't have a place to put the dog, what we're finding out is how big of a need it is. We provide free temporary fostering services for people that are ready to change their life.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Guys, she hasn't seen me in so long. Hi.
 
KNIGHT: And it becomes their motivator to stay healthy.
 
Oh, that face. When we find a foster, we will do a temporary foster contract. You're saving that dog's life and the owner's life, and we're able to prevent a dog going to shelter. We cannot have the solution to euthanize dogs. We can't. I want to be the voice of the dog and to help them, because they don't have that voice.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HILL: Head to CNNHeroes.com right now where you can vote for Stephen or any of our CNN Heroes for the CNN Hero of the Year. You have 10 votes per day through December 3rd, so you can help the ones who inspire you the most. 
 
New this morning, more bird flu found in raw milk, new warning from California officials and everything a pug should be. It is Vito, the big winner from the National Dog show. Who fits that bill? We'll tell you more just ahead. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[08:53:14]
 
HILL: This morning, a first look inside the iconic Notre Dame Cathedral as it prepares to reopen its doors more than five years after being ravaged by a devastating fire. French President Emmanuel Macron toured the church before it opens to the public on December 7. 
 
The restoration process was understandably a massive undertaking to the tune of more than $700 million. And along with all that cost came some really remarkable attention to detail, restoring even some of the imperfections that were there before the fire. CNN's Melissa Bell is with us now from Paris. 
 
So you've been in, you've seen these renovations. I am struck by those pictures in terms of how different it looks inside with all the cleaning that also happened. 
 
MELISSA BELL, CNN PARIS CORRESPONDENT: That's right. It's almost unrecognizable for the amount of light that you now have inside, which allows you to see so much more of this extraordinary structure. As you can see behind me, so much the scaffolding still surrounds Notre Dame, right, because the actual full renovation won't be done till 2030. 
 
This was the last visit by the French president of the construction site. He's spoke to some of the 2,000 men and women who've been involved in that, telling them they've been working on the construction site of a lifetime. And he was really quite moved as he thanked them. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
EMMANUEL MACRON, FRENCH PRESIDENT (through translator): You have been the alchemists of this work site, and you have transformed the blackness into art, the flame, was a national wound, and you've been the remedy through determination, commitment and work. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BELL: That blackness that he refers to, you'll remember, just over five years ago, Erica, here on CNN, we'd watched live as the cathedral went up in flames that had been watched around the world by millions that night. 
 <br>[08:55:10]
 
The flames quickly brought under control. But in terms of the restoration, to give you an idea, those five years, two of them, were spent just securing the building and make sure -- making sure that this extraordinary Gothic edifice wouldn't entirely collapse. 
 
HILL: And that is remarkable. That that alone took two years. So much of this, I can't wait to go see it the next time I'm in Paris, frankly, to see just how different it is. I know the organ was also a major part of these renovations. Talk to us about that. Were you able to see that in this preview visit? 
 
BELL: So were sort of rushed through quite quickly. But the first thing that strikes you, and you're quite right, I can't urge you enough to come back and have a look inside because you will rediscover it as you've. No one has ever really seen it before. Not in this lifetime, anyway. Not just restored to its glory of five years ago, but to many centuries before because of the light, because of the restoration of the artwork, because the stone is now white. 
 
You can see inside the paintings, the guilt work, the extraordinary detail, the intricate art. It's colorful in a way that it wasn't before. There was this overall impression of something somber and dark and cavernous, and you had a sense of its scale. Now you can see it, Erica, and it's extraordinary. The org is back -- the organ is back. And one of the first pieces I understand, to be brought back inside. 
 
The other -- when you get a chance to come back to Paris, is the Crown of Thrones, the Crown of Thorns. You'll remember that is one of those relics that had been rushed rescued out of the cathedral on the night of the fire. It was donated to a French king in the Middle Ages from Constantinople. It goes back. It is a relic, of course, of the time, said to be the very crown that Jesus had worn during his procession on the day of his crucifixion. That crown now fully restored and an entirely new piece of art around it, all golden, really exposed in a way that never had been before. 
 
Again, a symbol of the wider cathedral, which has been really restored to a grandeur that none of us had known before from the very blackness of the soot and the debris and the devastation of five years ago. An extraordinary monument now. 
 
HILL: Yes, it really is. It is so impressive. Melissa, really appreciate it. Thank you. Omar. 
 
JIMENEZ: All right. This week, workers found a man who disappeared weeks ago while camping in Canada and they found him alive. Sam Benistic was reported missing on October 19th. Workers found him Tuesday on a service road, partially wrapped in a cut up sleeping bag for warmth. And he told police he first stayed in his car a couple of days before moving on and camping, eventually building a shelter in a dry creek bed. Wow. 
 
And meet Vito, the charming two and a half year old pug who has taken the dog show world by storm. Vito is the first pug in 20 years to win best in show at the 92nd annual National Dog show, beating out about 2,000 other dogs at the show in Philadelphia. Veto added this top title to his impressive record of 25. Best in show wins. What a legend. 
 
And new this morning, health officials in California say another batch of raw milk has tested positive for the bird flu. It reportedly came from the same farm in Fresno where another lot of raw milk tested positive a few days ago. More testing at that farm is underway. No human bird flu cases linked to the milk have been reported. 
 
And this morning, thousands of eggs sold at Costco are under recall because of salmonella concerns. We're talking about select cartons of Kirkland Signature eggs. CNN health reporter Jacqueline Howard is following this for us. So Jacqueline, how sweeping is this recall here? 
 
JACQUELINE HOWARD, CNN HEALTH REPORTER: Omar, this involves more than 10,000 cartons of organic eggs impacting five states. What we know the supplier of the eggs, Hansom Brook Farms, voluntarily recalled its organic pasture raised 24 count eggs that are sold under the Kirkland Signature Brand. These eggs were distributed to Costco stores in Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. 
 
And the supplier says that these were sent by accident. They were not intended to go to retailers because of this salmonella concern they are being called. If you have these at home, they have the Best Buy date of January 5th. Do not eat the eggs. Return them to the store. Again because of the salmonella concern. Symptoms of salmonella to look out for. There have not been illnesses reported as part of this recall, but the symptoms do include fever, diarrhea, stomach cramps, nausea and vomiting. So that's important to look out for as well. Omar.
 <br>[09:00:00]
 
JIMENEZ: All good things to look out for. Jacqueline Howard, appreciate it. For everyone else, a new hour of CNN News Central starts right now.</pre>
