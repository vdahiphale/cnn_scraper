ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us from all around the world. I'm Rosemary Church. Just ahead here on CNN NEWSROOM. Despite Russia's relentless assault on Ukraine's power grid, Ukraine's defense intelligence chief says a Russian loss is inevitable and he's predicting when it'll happen. She says it was a mistake, but human rights groups fear Iran could punish this female athlete for not wearing a head covering during a competition abroad.
 
Plus, the human catastrophe unfolding in Haiti right now with gangs in control and food and water running out. I'll speak with the nation's former prime minister about what must be done to put an end to the suffering.
 
ANNOUNCER: Live from CNN Center, this is CNN NEWSROOM with Rosemary Church.
 
CHURCH: And thanks for joining us. Vladimir Putin's top commander is speaking out saying Russians and Ukrainians are one people. Upping the ante just hours ahead of a meeting between the Russian president and his security council. The commander says Russia wants a friendly Ukraine while acknowledging a tense situation on the ground and a very difficult situation in the southern Kherson region.
 
That's where Ukrainian forces have made significant advances in recent weeks. The head of Ukraine's Defense Intelligence Agency says he hopes to recapture the occupied city of Kherson by year's end. One of the significant victories he's predicting. And by next summer the Intel chief expects a Ukrainian victory saying "Russia's loss is inevitable." Still, Russian forces continue to launch drone and missile attacks across Ukraine striking critical infrastructure. 
 
Ukraine's president says 30 percent of his country's power stations have been destroyed since October 10th.

DAN RICE, SPECIAL ADVISER TO UKRAINIAN COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF: The Russian attack under this new general is ruthlessly attacking the civilian population which is a war crime, but they've never been charged with any of the other wars. But they're attacking the cities trying to attack the grid, making it a very difficult winner. They are trying to -- in my opinion, trying to get to the negotiating table to try to go back to the 2014 lines.
 
Ukraine won't have it. Ukraine wants all of their land back back to the '91 lines. They really need air defense systems they need aircraft.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: CNN's Nic Robertson is following developments and joins us now live from Kyiv. Good to see you, Nic. So what is the latest on Putin's drone and missile strikes hitting cities across Ukraine and targeting power stations?
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Yes. It was Mykolaiv in the south that was a target of drones overnight. 12 shot down according to Ukrainian officials and Kryvyi Rih, a town in the -- in the sort of middle east of the country. The middle, you know, north south and towards the east of the country was the target of a strike against the electrical power grid. Again, part of Russia's attritional campaign to essentially try to turn the lights off here in Ukraine.
 
Sergei Surovikin, Russia's new general in commander forces in Ukraine speaking about Kerch on state T.V. yesterday. As you were saying, saying that Russia wants to have friendly relations with Ukraine. The conundrum of course, is that they continue to bomb and kill Ukrainian. So, a slightly inverse logic. The fact that he talked to television to tell the Russian audience that the situation with Kherson is tough, that he is organizing a withdrawal and a pullout back deeper into Russian-held territory of the civilian population there appears to be an indication that Russia may be setting the stage for withdrawal of its forces in Kherson.
 
Although he says that they will stay there and continue to grind against the enemies advanced. The fact that Russia is pulling out civilians in of itself raises questions because in the war so far, Russia has not cared for the loss of life of civilians. It raises questions why are they pulling them out here right now? Could this be -- could this help Russia withdraw its troops? Not clear. But again, Surovikin can being on state television with these -- with this information begs the question of how hard Russian troops are going to fight to hold that area when it appears that Ukrainian forces may be headed in that direction soon.
 
And coming from Russia's --rather Ukraine's defense chief, Budanov very strong comments victory by next summer.
 <br>[02:05:06]
 
And as you are saying the -- he -- he's saying that Russia's loss is inevitable that it cannot be stopped. And it will lead to Russia's defeat. So, this is very strong language coming from Ukraine about a possible victory. And from the top general on the Russian side, appearing to set the stage for a possible pull out of the last piece of territory that Russia controls. That's on the western side of the Dnipro River. There's big sort of a river, but a tactical military feature that runs north to south in Ukraine.
 
CHURCH: Nic, since the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February this year, it hasn't only been a war on that nation, but also a war on truth, particularly on the battlefield. What have you learned about Russia's disinformation campaign?
 
ROBINSON: Yes. And I think when we look at again, just to mention Sergei Surovikin, the general that Putin has put in charge of Russia's forces fighting in Ukraine. When he speaks on the television, you have to sort of frame that with the way that the narrative that's been framed for the Russian people about this war that they don't even call a war is not an accurate, one that's full of truth.
 
It's one that's full of propaganda. And I got an insight into that by speaking with a former Russian soldier who had quit in disgust over the way that Russia's military was handling the war in Ukraine and had joined the State Information Service, TASS.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ROBERTSON (voice over): Since the war in Ukraine began, Russians have been denied the truth about what's happening to their army.
 
GLEB IRISOV, FORMER RUSSIAN AIR FORCE LIEUTENANT AND JOURNALIST: So when the war started, I was at military desperate, TASS agency, the main Russian Information Agency and I --
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
ROBERTSON: Gleb Irisov, a former Russian air force lieutenant turn state journalist is lifting the lid on the state secrecy.
 
IGOR KONASHENKOV, SPOKESPERSON, RUSSIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE (through translator): Four hundred ninety-eight Russian servicemen died.
 
ROBERTSON: It was March 2nd, more than a week into the war before Russia admitted its troops were dying in Ukraine. But Gleb says they'd known since the get go. He was manning the military desk phones at tasks as the war began.
 
IRISOV: I started to receive a lot of messages from my sources that are taking heavy -- extremely heavy casualties.
 
ROBERTSON (on camera): What numbers?
 
IRISOV: So numbers was an enormous.
 
ROBERTSON (voice over): He served in Syria in the Air Force, but quit in disgust over Russia's part in Assad's war. His wife worked at TASS. He got a job there thinking he'd be able to report facts about the poor state of Russia's military. But as soon as the war started in Ukraine, and Russian casualties began piling up. His hopes fell victim to Putin's propaganda machine.
 
IRISOV: Instructions from the Ministry of Defense, from FSB, from the office of the president.
 
ROBERTSON: New laws preventing protests over the war in Ukraine put Gleb, his wife and young family in danger. He quit a week into the war. A week later, they fled for safety to Armenia, then Georgia, then Turkey, then Mexico, finally to the USA, and a chance to tell the truth about the war.
 
IRISOV: If you're once a (INAUDIBLE) you need to be at some kind of safe place.
 
ROBERTSON: His insights are remarkable, rampant corruption and warlordism.
 
IRISOV: Putin and his friends, they use this military systems, they washed tons of money through this military system.
 
ROBERTSON: Gleb's observations about Putin's newly promoted general Sergei Surovikin reveal the propaganda machine he fled remains in overdrive. General Armageddon, as Surovikin is known, actually a danger to his own sight.
 
IRISOV: He has made the life of his commanding officers there absolutely impossible. So --
 
ROBERTSON: Gleb knows Surovikin, served under him in Syria. He says the general signed off on his resignation.
 
ROBERTSON (on camera): Is he going to change the morale in the Russian forces?
 
IRISOV: I strongly believe that nothing can change the morale of Russian forces. No way.
 
ROBERTSON (voice over): Putin's propaganda machine may be working.
 <br>[02:10:05]
 
His army is not. Gleb is witness to both and brave enough to speak about it.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
And his insights about Sergei Surovikin place him no greater, no worse, no better endowed with a sort of military intellect than any of the generals that have come before him. His assessment of Surovikin really is that is not going to change the dynamic on the battlefield.
 
CHURCH: A remarkable report there. Nic Robertson, many thanks to you joining us live from Kyiv.
 
Well, nationwide protests against Iran's authoritarian regime are in their fifth consecutive week. Demonstrations erupted last month after Mahsa Amini died in the custody of the morality police for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly. CNN obtained this video from the pro- reform activist outlet IranWire. It shows protesters gathering around a fire in the birthplace of Amini on Tuesday. And she's become a symbol in the fight for women's rights and freedoms in Iran.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH (voice over): These are university students in northern Iran chanting for freedom and equality during their protest march on Tuesday.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: Well, meantime, and Iranian rock climber is now back in Tehran after competing without her hijab in South Korea on Sunday. Elnaz Rekabi told Iranian state media on arrival that she accidentally competed without her hijab. But as CNN's Nada Bashir reports, there's growing concern she could face repercussions given Iran's current climate.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN INTERNATIONAL REPORTER (voice over): The fate of Iranian athlete Elnaz Rekabi could hang in the balance of the video merge showing the prominent rock climber competing in South Korea without her mandatory headscarf or hijab. The religious veil is mandated by the Iranian regime both at home and overseas when officially representing the country.
 
ELNAZ REKABI, IRANIAN CLIMBER (through translator): The future is very bright, especially for women in rock climbing.
 
BASHIR: Her hopes for the future however now in limbo. In a post on Instagram, Rekabi issued an apology saying she had been called to climb unexpectedly creating an unintentional issue with her hijab. There's some activists have questioned whether her statement was written under duress. And now that she has returned to Iran some fear she may face punishment.
 
MAHMOOD REZA AMIRY-MOGHADDAM, DIRECTOR, IRAN HUMAN RIGHTS: Based on the knowledge that we have from the Iranian authorities, they will do whatever they can to try to undo the so called damage she has done to their authority.
 
BASHIR: Iran strict dress code is enforced, often violently by the country's notorious morality police. The very authority under whose custody, 22-year-old Mahsa Amini died in September. She had been detained for allegedly wearing her hijab incorrectly. Amini's death has however, sparked a moment of reckoning for the country's hardline regime with nationwide protests now entering their fifth week.
 
Women and girls across the country removing their mandatory hijabs and even cutting their hair in a show of defiance against the regime's severe restrictions on women's rights. A movement which has gained support across the international community. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What we have to stress is that women should never be prosecuted for what they wear.
 
BASHIR: But the Iranian regime continues to pursue a brutal and deadly crackdown on protesters. And there are growing concerns that Rekabi could be used by the regime as an example to other women.
 
AMIRY-MOGHADDAM: The bravery that she has shown will certainly inspire millions of Iranian girls. And I think that's the main problem.
 
BASHIR: While the Iranian embassy in Seoul claims that report Rekabi will be arrested upon her arrival in Iran are "fake news." Fears remain that she too, will face the brutal repression of the Iranian regime. Nada Bashir, CNN, London.

CHURCH: Still to come. U.N. officials are divided over how to help patients from running out of food and water. Haiti's government is asking for help and many there appear do not want it.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:16:50]
 
CHURCH: Haiti is grappling with a worsening humanitarian crisis amid efforts to manage violent gang activity. Thousands of residents have been in the streets for weeks venting their anger and frustration, as vital resources like fuel have become scarce.
 
Food and water are now luxuries many don't have. Outside countries have offered help. But that outreach has been met with even more protests. Some Haitians are blaming countries like the United States and Canada for the increasing violence. Meantime, the United Nations is split over how to help. Some member countries have proposed sending in defense forces, while others say they need to honor the wishes of the Haitian people. 
 
Former Haitian Prime Minister Laurent Lamothe joins me now from Miami, Florida. Thank you, sir, for being with us.
 
LAURENT LAMOTHE, FORMER PRIME MINISTER OF HAITI: Thank you for having me.
 
CHURCH: I wanted to start by asking you what's behind this increase in gang violence and kidnappings across Haiti with a capital mostly controlled by gangs. How did this happen?
 
LAMOTHE: Well, everything started a while back. But it got worse after the death of -- the assassination of President Jovenel Moise who was basically the last break of constitutionality. His death created a huge (INAUDIBLE) and all his programs, he had a lot of programs, social programs that he was doing and everything stopped for the past 15 months. So that created a situation of despair, and actually fueled the gangs and the violence. The pressure, the frustration in the country, basically reinforced the gangs. And all along the president had a task force that was, you know, very aggressive on the gangs and that task force actually was dissolved creating a vacuum. And the police being under equipped, the army being non-existent. The only -- became the gangs and there is eight warlords. Today, there is close to 200 gangs to just to give you some numbers.
 
There is over 10 to 15,000 of them in a part of the gangsters and they're terrorizing, you know, the whole -- the whole country I would say. 75 percent of the capital of Port-Au Prince is occupied by a gang. It's a very difficult situation and it's there, you know, the country is at a standstill right now. The gas deliveries have stopped. They occupy the terminal -- the field terminal -- those are closing. clinics are closing, schools cannot open. It's really a situation of guerrilla warfare right now.
 
CHURCH: And so in response to this, U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has drafted a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing the deployment of foreign troops to Haiti. What's your reaction to that move? Is that what needs to be done?
 <br>[02:20:02]
 
LAMOTHE: Well, this is one step that needs to be done. One step in the right direction. Of course, you know, it's not the first time that Haiti would be receiving foreign troops. So, I hope that the international community learns from their mistakes in the past. You know, the problem is not simply sending the troops in. This time, it will be sending the troops but not a military occupation, more of assistance to the police and the army, in equipment, in resources, in training and intelligence in order to defeat the gang.
 
That's priority number one. But in order for that to work that has -- that alone, is not going to solve the problem. That has to be accompanied with an aid package. Because, you know, for the past 15 months, the people of Haiti has seen terrible misery and poverty. So the assistance to the police needs to be accompanied with an aid package. And afterwards, train the police, train the army, equip the police, equip the army, but that never again will be the face this gang war (INAUDIBLE) right now.
 
CHURCH: Meantime, what's Haiti's current prime minister doing about these multiple crises gripping the nation?
 
LAMOTHE: Well, the prime minister, as you know, is a provisional government that came after the assassination of President Moise. The prime minister came on a mandate of four months. Basically, the mandate was pretty straightforward, which was -- his job was to organize elections and do a referendum for a new constitution. And, you know, he had four months to do it, he didn't do it. We are 15 months in.
 
And that also has -- and the prime minister has basically imposed -- has tripled the price of gas, gasoline prices and diesel prices on the market which has caused even more frustration. And this as you seen, have -- has really upset many people. And people have taken to the streets asking for the ouster of the prime minister. So the prime minister, you know, if I was in his place, I would put a temporary halt under price hike to allow the tensions to come down, allow the troops to come in, you know, basically take control of the gangs.
 
Because today with the presence of the gangs, you know, nothing is possible because everything is stopped and everything is blocked. It's a situation of national standstill.
 
CHURCH: Former Haitian Prime Minister Laurent Lamothe, thank you so much for talking with us. Appreciate it.
 
LAMOTHE: Thank you very much for having me.
 
CHURCH: This just into CNN, inflation has risen yet again in the United Kingdom reaching 10.1 percent last month which was up from 9.9 percent in August. Higher food and beverage prices were the biggest drivers of the increase, as those prices are up more than 14 percent. And in the coming hours, Britain's Liz Truss will face tough questions during the weekly prime minister's questions. That's if she shows up to Parliament.
 
Of course she was notably late on Monday and deputize the House of Commons leader to speak on her behalf. The prime minister is also under fire from her own peers, putting her leadership into question after her fiscal growth plan was scrapped by the new finance minister. A new snap poll released Tuesday shows two-thirds of British adults say conservative lawmakers should replace Liz Truss.
 
The prime minister said she wants to be honest with the public about the tough times ahead. According to a readout from her latest cabinet meeting.
 
Well, tens of thousands of workers went on strike across France on Tuesday demanding better pay to help cope with sky-high inflation. The walkouts have now expanded beyond the oil industry into other parts of the energy sector, as well as school and transport workers. Regional train service was cut in half on Tuesday and many teachers didn't show up to work. Meantime, the government is struggling to end the weeks long oil strike which has left almost a third of the country's gas station short on supply.
 
CNN's Melissa Bell has more now from Paris.
 
MELISSA BELL, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The context of today's March here in Paris but in other French cities as well, was of course there's queues we've seen at petrol stations, the strikes in refinery that have led to such problems these last few weeks. Today it was a different strike. One about the cost of living, inflation and the impact that is happening on ordinary workers.
 <br>[02:25:01]
 
So this was a strike and a march that was called by four unions. And it's just coming to an end here now (INAUDIBLE) the thing was the number of people they managed to get onto the streets today. The strike itself not as crippling as the unions would have liked, but a lot of people on the streets and it had been a couple of years since we'd seen that many people out on the streets of Paris.
 
COVID, of course, but of course also ever since the yellow vests had run out of steam in 2019 we hadn't seen this kind of social protest. The trouble for Emmanuel Macron now, he's having to get through his 2023 budget by bypassing a parliamentary vote. So fragile is his parliamentary majority. And behind that, still hoping to get through his controversial pension reform. Given the anger on the streets today, it's looking set to be for him a complicated autumn with threats from the unions that they're going to try and put in place a rolling stripe.
 
CHURCH: And still to come. CNN's Clarissa Ward speaks with a Ukrainian intelligence officer and gets an exclusive look at one of the drone shot down of Ukraine. That's just ahead.
 
And we'll have an update on basketball star Brittney Griner who celebrated her birthday in a Russian jail as she waits for her appeal hearing next week. Back in just a moment.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHURCH: Let's get you up to date on our top stories this hour. U1kraine's military intelligence chief predicts the country will be able to declare victory against Russia by next summer. Saying Russia's loss is inevitable and cannot be stopped. Iran is again denying providing Russia with drones and other weapons for Moscow's war in Ukraine. The latest denial comes as Reuters reports Tehran has promised to provide Russia with additional missiles and drones. 
 
Ukraine has reported many Russian attacks carried out with Iranian- made kamikaze drones in recent weeks. And Ukraine's Intel chief says Russia's supply of missiles is running critically low, which would explain the increased use of drone attacks.
 
Well, CNN chief international correspondent Clarissa Ward was in Kyiv on Monday when Russia launched its drone attack. She now has an exclusive look at one of the drones wreaking havoc in cities across the country.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
CLARISSA WARD, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): At an undisclosed location, Ukrainian military intelligence officer Alexey takes us to see one of Russia's newest threats on the battlefield. An Iranian-made drone known as the Mohajer-6.
 
WARD (on camera): It's big.
 
WARD (voice over): Used by the Russians for reconnaissance and bombing.
 
WARD (on camera): Yes, it was shot. I can see this is the hole from where you shot it down. [02:30:00]
 
OLEKSI, UKRAINIAN MILITARY INTELLIGENCE OFFICER:  Yes, this is a hole from the rocket of Ukrainian forces. You can see, zero, two, 2022.
 
WARD (on camera):  So, this is the date when it was made?
 
OLEKSI:  We think that this plane was made in this year. When the Russians began to fly these drones. We have new problems on the field -- battlefield.
 
WARD (voiceover):  In just the last eight days, more than 100 drones have been fired at Ukraine, mostly kamikaze Shahed 136 drones. Smashing civilian infrastructure and terrorizing ordinary people. The Kremlin today said that only Russian equipment with Russian numbers is used in its so-called special operations. But Oleksi says that there is no doubt where this drone comes from.
 
WARD (on camera):  Now, I don't see any writing in Farsi, in Iranian language. How do you know? (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE).
 
OLEKSI:  We know that it is Iranian plane by two main things. The first thing, we watched exhibitions of the planes in other countries. And some years ago, Iranian other companies showed -- 
 
WARD (on camera):  This exact model?
 
OLEKSI:  -- this -- this plane. And the second thing, why we -- this Iranian plane is we have one, only one writing -- writing by their hand.
 
WARD (on camera):  Can you show me?
 
OLEKSI:  Yes.
 
WARD (on camera):  So, that's Farsi.
 
OLEKSI:  I think, yes.
 
WARD (on camera):  Yes.
 
OLEKSI:  You're you right.
 
WARD (on camera):  So, if I understand, they're -- you are saying that they tried to hide the fact -- 
 
OLEKSI:  Absolutely -- 
 
WARD (on camera):  -- that this was made in Iran.
 
OLEKSI:  Yes.
 
WARD (voiceover):  Ukraine has called for more sanctions against Iran for supplying the drones, but so far sanctions have had little effect. The components are commercially available in a number of different countries, from Japanese batteries to an Austrian engine and American processors.
 
WARD (on camera):  This is the Mohajer-6.
 
OLEKSI:  Yes.
 
WARD (on camera):  Now, we are seeing these kamikaze drones, the Shahed 136. And you say there is a new generation of drone coming to the Arash 2?
 
OLEKSI:  Arash 2, yes. We worry very much from this.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHURCH:  CNN military analyst and retired lieutenant general Mark Hertling weighed in on Russia's use of drones and the challenges Ukraine faces fighting back against them.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LT. GEN MARK HERTLING (RET), CNN MILITARY ANALYST AND FORMER COMMANDING GENERAL, U.S. ARMY EUROPE AND SEVENTH ARMY:  You have to have several layers to deal with different types of incursions in your country. Ballistic missiles, rockets. These kinds of drones that Clarissa was just pointing out, the Mohajer-6, which is more of a command and control drone. That drone specifically has about a 250 or 130-mile range. Has a max speed of 200 kilometers per hour. It has forced lodged per missiles. But that particular drone has the ability to see the battlefield. And it can shape the targeting of the Shahed 136 drone which we have seen the last couple of days going in in swarms which don't have a camera on board.
 
So, these two drones work in tandem. They are very different. One is an unmanned combat aerial vehicle. The other one, the Shahed, is a loitering munitions drone. I don't mean to get too technical but they have to work together in order to attack the targets. And it is very difficult because these drones work below the normal level. They have a very low radio -- radar signature. So, it's hard to knock them down.

CHURCH:  American basketball star Brittney Griner celebrated her 32nd birthday in a Russian jail on Tuesday. And her lawyers tell CNN she is anxious ahead of her appeal hearing next week. Griner was detained in Moscow in February and sentenced in August to nine years in prison for drug smuggling. Her family has launched a, "We Are B.G." social media campaign. And Griner thanked her supporters through her lawyer. A top White House official says discussions to free her continue.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOHN KIRBY, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL SPOKESPERSON:  I cannot speak for Russian intentions. I can tell you that we have made a very serious proposal. We continue to be in discussions with Russian officials about finding a way to bring her and Mr. Whelan home. She shouldn't have to spend another day, let alone another birthday in wrongful detention in Russia. (END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[02:35:00]
 
CHURCH:  In a video released as part of the campaign, Griner's wife thanked President Biden for the administration's efforts to secure her release.
 
The son of an American citizen imprisoned in Saudi Arabia is urging the U.S. government to secure his father's freedom. The state department confirmed on Tuesday 72-year-old Saad Ibrahim Almadi has been sentenced to 16 years in a Saudi prison. His crime, tweets considered critical of the kingdom. Tweets he wrote when he was in the United States.
 
After his 16-year prison sentence, he's banned from leaving the country for another 16 years. His son says if his father was being held in a Russian or Iranian jail, his name would be in the headlines every morning. The U.S. State Department says it is still working to determine whether Almadi should be declared wrongfully detained.
 
Analysts are warning that it is not a matter of if China will try to take Taiwan, but when and how. We'll take a look at why it could happen sooner than many expect.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHURCH:  Welcome back, everyone. Well, America's top diplomat is warning that China is moving much faster with its plans to seize Taiwan under Xi Jinping. During his keynote speech at the Communist Party Congress, the Chinese leader made no secret of his plans for what he calls reunification. And CNN's Will Ripley joins us now live from Taipei.
 
Good to see, Will. So, what all did President Xi have to say about this, and how the Taiwan respond?
 
WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, he basically said the same thing that he's been saying for years now, Rosemary. That, in his words, reunification with an island that the communist rulers in Beijing have never actually controlled over more than 70 plus years of this island having its own government.
 
He says it is essentially inevitable and he's not ruling out, at once again, the use of force. There is huge applause in the room at the Communist Party Congress in Beijing. But here on the island of Taiwan, the government says they take this as a sign that they need to be prepared for possible military confrontation with China. The only question, what are they going to do and when will they do it.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
RIPLEY (voiceover):  The loudest applause at China's Communist Party Congress, when leader Xi Jinping promised reunification of Taiwan, the self-governing democracy claimed but never controlled by Beijing's communist rulers. XI JINPING, CHINESE LEADER (through translator):  We insists on striving for the prospect of peaceful reunification. But we will never promise to give up the use of force.
 
RIPLEY (on camera):  Do you think Xi Jinping actually believes that peaceful reunification will happen?
 
IAN EASTON, AUTHOR, "THE CHINESE INVASION THREAT" AND SENIOR DIRECTOR, PROJECT 2049 INSTITUTE:  No, absolutely not. If he did, he would not be engaging in the largest tailored offensive military buildup that the world has witnessed in at least a century.
 <br>[02:40:00]
 
RIPLEY (voiceover):  China's power, bigger, economically, and militarily than the former Soviet Union says Ian Easton.
 
EASTON:  Their biggest military strength is size. Size of their missile force, size of their amphibious force, size of their air force, their navy, their cyber capability, their space capabilities.
 
RIPLEY (on camera):  Is there any doubt in your mind that Xi Jinping is going to try to make a move on Taiwan?
 
EASTON:  No, there's no doubt. The only question is, how and when.
 
RIPLEY (voiceover):  That burning question, top of mind for Taiwan's government. The island's record defense spending, dwarfed by China's massive military.
 
SU TZU-YUN, DIRECTOR, TAIWAN INSTITUTE FOR NATIONAL DEFENSE AND SECURITY RESEARCH:  Taiwan right now is facing a threat from China. It's very huge and immediate.
 
RIPLEY (on camera):  The threat from China is huge and immediate?
 
TZU-YUN:  Yes.
 
RIPLEY (voiceover):  And getting bigger. U.S. intelligence says, President Xi gave the order. China's military must be ready to take Taiwan by 2027. But he is still deciding if he'll do it.
 
President Joe Biden said, repeatedly, the U.S. military would defend Taiwan. He's authorized more than $1 billion in arms sales to Taipei. Taiwan, taking cues from Ukraine, focusing on asymmetric, unconventional warfare.
 
TZU-YUN:  That can give Taiwan more opportunities to defeat such a huge force.
 
RIPLEY (voiceover):  Defending this democratic island from its nuclear armed nemesis will be the greatest military challenge of the 21st century, Easton says.
 
EASTON:  So, if Taiwan falls and Xi Jinping is able to shatter the U.S. alliance system, democracy will cease to exist in our country. Taiwan is the front line. It is the geostrategic nerve center of our world to date. And that is likely to remain true for decades to come.
 
RIPLEY (voiceover):  The U.S. and its allies must do more than sell weapons, he says. Defending Taiwan is defending the free world.

RIPLEY (on camera):  Experts say, the key to preventing this from happening is deterrence for the U.S. and its allies to work with Taiwan to convince Beijing and Xi Jinping that it would be far too difficult if they were to attempt to invade this island, and in fact they could lose everything as opposed to the reunification that they've been talking about for decades every Chinese leader since now.
 
But if you look at the sheer numbers, one thing you need when you're invading an island like Taiwan is a large and powerful navy. And China has been growing its navy at a faster pace than any other nation in the world, according to comparative estimates by the U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence in 2020. China's on track to have more than 63 battle force ships -- 63 more battle force ships than the United States. Rosemary.
 
CHURCH:  All right. Will Ripley bringing us that report from Taipei. Many thanks.
 
And, we do want to leave you with a stunning image captured far above Earth. An astronaut on the International Space Station took this photo of what appears to be too bright blue orbs from the earth's atmosphere. While they seem mysterious it's actually the result of two unrelated rare events.
 
The blue sphere on the bottom is a lightning strike, they're usually hard to see from the space station because they're covered by clouds. But in this case, there was a gap in the clouds and the lightning eliminated the surrounding cloud walls. The other blue sphere in the upper right was created by light from the moon, hitting tiny particles in the earth's atmosphere. Gorgeous.
 
Thank you so much for joining us. I'm Rosemary Church. World Sport is coming up next. Then, I'll be back in 15 minutes with more CNN Newsroom. Do stay with us.

MARKLE:  It was solely about beauty and not necessarily about brains. And when I look back at that time, I will never forget -- I'll never forget this one detail because moments before we would get on stage, there was a woman who ran the show, and she would be there backstage. And I can still hear her. She couldn't properly pronounce my last name at the time, and I knew who she was talking to because she would go, Mark-el, suck it in. Mark-el, suck it in.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COATES:  Wow. CAMEROTA:  Meghan Markle sat down with socialite, Paris Hilton, to the dissect labels of bimbo and dumb blond.
 
Back with us, Laura Barron-Lopez, Ashley Allison, and Kirsten Powers. OK. I admit, Laura, I'm confused by. This this confuses. She took the job as, basically, in model that carries a briefcase of fake money on a game show. And she thought it was about brains, and she had no lines. So, yes, she was objectified. The role called for being objectified, let's be honest.
 
Now, she also was a star on a different show called "Suits", where she had a substantial role. That was a different character she was playing. So, are we supposed to be outraged that she was a objectified on "Deal or No Deal"?
 
LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST AND WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, PBS NEWSHOUR:  I mean, look, you're right. She did take this job. She -- 
 
CAMEROTA:  Was paid.
 
BARRON-LOPEZ:  -- presumably knew what she was entering when she took the job. That doesn't mean that she should have to deal with someone who is telling her to suck it in. I think that it's refreshing that Meghan Markle talks about these things, even though that was part of that jobs M.O. and that job description.
 
And I think it -- her talking about it potentially raises a question as to whether or not, do we need models next these suitcases? I mean, do we need women to -- standing next to all these suitcases? Do we really need Vanna White in all -- 
 
CAMEROTA:  Well, I don't know. Vanna White's had a long career.
 
BARRON-LOPEZ:  -- all these lengthy dresses.
 
COATES:  I love "Wheel of Fortune".
 
CAMEROTA:  You know.
 
BARRON-LOPEZ:  Sorry, not to attack "Wheel of Fortune".
 
CAMEROTA:  And that's why some of this -- this is a model -- the other term for models, because it works.
 
KIRSTEN POWERS, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST AND COLUMNIST, USA TODAY: Yes, but Alisyn, the -- I think the bigger problem is that if you're making Markle starting out, however many years ago this was, this was a while ago, these are the options for women. And men have different options. And then that's what the point is. The point is, she probably didn't really have a choice. She did have to do this. It doesn't make it any less humiliating that she was doing it. And you don't -- 
 
CAMEROTA:  She didn't have to take that job.
 
POWERS:  Well, I don't think that's fair. I actually think that's kind of, like, blaming the victim. The fact that a woman does not have a lot of options in Hollywood, except to have to play bimbos, you know, is not Meghan Markle's fault. It's Hollywood's fault.
 
And so, you know, I do not know that she had a lot of options to break in. And then that's the problem is that women are -- these are what women -- the options that women are given. And there's all these other options for men. And we know for a long time it's starting to change because we're having more women directors and things like that, especially because of streaming. But at the time, she was breaking into the business. I don't think there were a lot of options. And I think that this just speaks badly to the people who were in control.
 
ASHLEY ALLISON, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR AND FORMER NATIONAL COALITIONS DIRECTOR FOR BIDEN-HARRIS 2020:  I agree. I also think is, what is the standard of beauty. Do you have to be a size four with straight hair, and have large breasts. And all of the things that people say like this is what the Barbie image of what you need to look like.
 
Spray tan, for a certain complexion, but not too dark of a complexion. And it does go to -- just like, the game still would've existed without the woman next to the suitcase. Like, the deal was in those -- the case, not the women.
 
CAMEROTA:  I guess, but I don't know if anybody has ever gone broke putting beautiful women on TV. I mean -- 
 
COATES:  Well, that's the point, though. I mean, in part of it. And I think it's, kind of -- like, I've had this conversation, and I'll note this goes back to cheerleaders. I fully support everyone doing what they want to do. But are you that much more interested in the game by the presence of this? Some will argue the halftime show. I mean, I'm not discriminating against that notion of it.
 
But I look at it as more of a reflection of what Hollywood requires. And the idea that saying, look, here's what we know is going to feed the audience. Here's what we know is going to (INAUDIBLE) enticing to people. And she was also speaking to Paris Hilton as part of this conversation, who has been very vocal in years since her original debut as a socialite to talk about how it was a feigned put on, sort of, dips.
 
CAMEROTA:  Yes.
 
COATES:  And that served her well to be thought of coquettish and meek and not fully in the room.
 
CAMEROTA:  A bimbo.
 
COATES:  And, you know, in reality, there was a lot more going on. And I think that does speak about why it would be, that's a safe space for people to go, oh, she's not threatening. There's nothing there there. And we are, by the way, five-year anniversary of the MeToo Movement. These conversations have been happening over and over again.
 
CAMEROTA:  But I mean -- I guess, I would just say about Paris Hilton, she was playing a role, and Meghan Markle was playing a role. And she made it her brand. I mean, Paris Hilton made that her brand. Now, of course, we can talk about who is forcing her to make it that brand, and did she have to make it her brand. But she rode that brand for 10 years.
 <br>[02:50:00]
 
POWERS:  But I don't think it's about anybody would even force to do anything. I just think things happen. I -- you have to remember how young she was and that you get into these situations and I'll just speak about it getting into television, and maybe you could as well. You come into -- 
 
CAMEROTA:  I know that this is ringing true for you.
 
POWERS:  -- you come into it thinking, oh, I'm here to talk about politics. And I'm here to do all these other things. And next thing you know, you've got people telling you how to wear your hair and how to wear your makeup. And why don't you wear more makeup?
 
You know, it's -- I've actually had -- you know, someone said if we don't say, it's good to be attractive. It's good to be pretty. But it doesn't make you not serious. Can we make you a little prettier? Can we play this up a little bit more? And you, kind of, go along with it because you don't really know what's going on.
 
This was 15 years ago for me what I'm talking about, right. Now today, I don't know that you guys will put up with that, right? Like, would you? I don't -- 
 
ALLISON:  It's a tough -- 
 
POWERS:  Yes.
 
ALLISON:  I mean, as much as I am a feminist and I try and stand in my truth and power, like, I want to be on CNN. And so, like, you do what you need to do to be -- not to say that they would not have me on the show if I didn't look a certain way or what.
 
But I think the point though of this is that, where does it stop? Yes, Meghan was holding a briefcase on a game show and Paris was playing a reality star, one of the first to introduce. But we also know it carries over in other sectors. It carries over in television. It carries over in politics. Candidates, what do they look like? What are they wearing?
 
COATES:  They dissect the vice president's wardrobe.
 
ALLISON:  Every day.
 
COATES:  Every single day.
 
ALLISON:  How she wears her hair. Oh, she takes how long in makeup? Well, if she came out without looking professional, what would you call her then? Michelle Obama looked like this. You know, name the -- 
 
COATES:  Probably other women, too. Get it, by the way.
 
ALLISON:  Yes, everyone.
 
BARRON-LOPEZ:  The one thing I'll say is, you know, whether or not she put herself into that position with the "Deal or No Deal" job, that I think the fact that she's talking about this makes all women, you know, and hopefully men realize when they're treating women in this way in their places. Because I've been objectified by members of Congress, you know, multiple times. And it's very difficult to come forward and talk about that. And it happens, you know, somewhat to women on a regular basis.
 
And I think that if they see, you know, conversations like this that we're covering, that hopefully men start to realize and women who do it as well, because that was a woman that did to it Meghan Markle, that that's not acceptable. That that shouldn't be done anymore.
 
COATES:  I'm sorry. I don't want to leave this point, though, when that has happened to you is in the course as your profession as a journalist, that congressmen are doing this? And how do you react in those moments?
 
BARRON-LOPEZ:  I think early on when I was younger, I didn't totally know how to act. When it happened in more recent years, I confronted the member with others around me, you know, right outside the floor, so. And I said that they needed to stop.
 
COATES:  And did they?
 
BARRON-LOPEZ:  Yes, they did. They have since.
 
POWERS:  But there was a time if you did that, you would lose your job, right?
 
BARRON-LOPEZ:  Right.
 
POWERS:  And that's what Meghan Markle, I think is talking about. Is that if she had pushed back against that, she would have lost her job. And so, it's like you have to just realize. And then I do think what happens -- and I think, Alisyn, I keep looking at you because I know we've gone through this through our career. Is you -- as you get older and you mature and society changes and the standards change, and you start looking back to going, why didn't I say something?
 
CAMEROTA:  Well, yes -- I mean, and -- 
 
POWERS:  Why didn't I do something?
 
CAMEROTA:  To Laura's point, the MeToo Movement, I do think it changed a lot of things, in particularly the national conversation and the way we all think about this. And for that, I think we're all grateful.
 
COATES:  Thank you for sharing, Laura.
 
CAMEROTA:  Thanks so much, ladies. OK. Next, what James Corden did to get himself barred from a top New York City hot spot. He may have been a jerk. It's possible. I know, sad.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:55:00]
 
COATES:  "Late Night" host James Corden temporarily banned from New York City hot spot Balthazar. The restaurant's owner, Keith McNally, is alleging verbal abuse by Corden against the staff. McNally calling Corden, "Tiny Cretan of a man" and "The most abusive customer in Balthazar's history".
 
CAMEROTA:  This makes me very sad, because I think that James Corden is so appealing, and he is so funny and he is so talented. And it's a bummer that he is a jerk. But he has now apologized, profusely, we're told. The ban has been revoked, thank goodness.
 
McNally, Balthazar's owner, says tonight in a self-deprecating statement, "Anyone magnanimous enough to apologize to a deadbeat layabout like me does not deserve to be banned from anywhere. Especially Balthazar." CNN has reached out to Corden for comment, we haven't heard back yet. But this is -- there's a lesson here. Don't ever be rude to the wait staff. Don't ever be rude to the waiters. I mean -- 
 
COATES:  Or to anyone.
 
CAMEROTA:  OK. That's a more universal. That's a -- 
 
COATES:  That's the lesson.
 
CAMEROTA:  That's better.
 
COATES:  That's the lesson.
 
CAMEROTA:  But particularly, you just are a jerk. If you're rude to the waiters and waitresses, it's just like you have a huge jerk sign. And by the way, the things he was doing, in June, Corden demanded that a round of drinks come this second and then previous round be comped because he had found a hair in his food. That is gross.
 
COATES:  But the food, not the drinks.
 
CAMEROTA:  Yes. And also, did he really? I mean, I don't know. Anyway, he was extremely nasty to the manager. He also, on another occasion that month, came into the restaurant with his wife for brunch and said to the server that there was a tiny bit of egg yolk in her egg white omelet. That's jerky.
 
COATES:  I got to tell you. I mean, I -- as somebody who is awfully new to being sometimes recognizable to people, I spend a lot of my time being invisible. And I can tell you, I love it, because I know who people really are and how you've treated people that I've watch. And I'm kind of, like, I see you. And I think when it comes to -- I've been a waitress.
 
CAMEROTA:  Yes, me too.
 
COATES:  I've had all sorts of odd jobs. And I can tell you about a -- if the person treats people because they have this perceived sense of superiority.
 
CAMEROTA:  Yes.
 
COATES:  I don't care what kind of schmoozing you can do, you'll always be seen. So, maybe that's what happened here. I've also never been to Balthazar, though.
 
CAMEROTA:  Oh, I'll take you there. It's great. Fantastic.
 
COATES:  If I do my hair and suit, do I get to get a free meal?
 
CAMEROTA:  Oh, you're are you buying?
