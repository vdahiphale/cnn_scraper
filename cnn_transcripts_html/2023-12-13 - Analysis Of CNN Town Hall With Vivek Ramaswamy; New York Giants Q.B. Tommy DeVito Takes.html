KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN HOST: Is elevating a January 6th conspiracy theory the way to win over those voters?
 
SCOTT JENNINGS, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: No, I don't think so. I don't think his campaign is in very good shape. Truthfully, I think he's mostly playing for the future, whether that's as a Donald Trump surrogate in the near term, whether that's as a member of his administration, whether that's as a future presidential candidate in 2028. I mean, he is a young man.
 
So, no, I don't think this is the way to. I mean, but this was the most decaffeinated we've seen Vivek. I mean, he has been a very hyper candidate through all the debates and other. But the most animated he got tonight was on January the 6th, and pushing this idea that was an inside job. I mean, it wasn't inside job. I mean, the head of the federal government at the time was sort of encouraging it, I mean, if you want to go down that road, but not. But that was the most animated. Everything else, he was very decaffeinated. He was very subdued.
 
And, you know, look, I'm reminded by watching him tonight, there's a marketplace for conspiracy theorists in our politics. He knows it. And that's why he's doing it. That's why Robert F. Kennedy Jr., I think, has a following out there, because he's been a conspiracy theorist. So, why is he doing it? Because there's a market for it, not enough, but there's a market for it.
 
ANA NAVARRO, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: But there's always a market for a flash in the pan, shooting star, outsider candidate, right, whether it's a Herman Cain or Andrew Yang, in this term it's Vivek Ramaswamy.
 
When you dig a little deeper, when you listen a little closer, you realize that Vivek Thomas Jefferson Ramaswamy, if you'll spend 55 minutes quoting Thomas Jefferson, says talks and talks and talks and talks, but says precious little. It's all platitudes and cliches and spreading of conspiracy theories and hawking books and hawking podcasts and saying very little, really not answering anything. COLLINS: And what did you make of his demeanor? Because as Scott noted, he came out not as rambunctious as he did even the last debate. I mean, at that debate, he told Chris Christie to go eat a meal in a disagreement. He called Nikki Haley a fascist. He compared her to a Dylan Mulvaney ad. I mean, he was asked a question by Riley Miller (ph), a voter there, about they want a vivacious president, but he said, I want a president who has tack.
 
NAVARRO: I'm fascinated by how different people, different demographics, react to Vivek Ramaswamy. In my family, I have everything from 30-year-old and 40-year-old crypto bros who call each other dogs. I have young women. I have people my age and older. The crypto bros think he's eloquent, think he's well-rounded, think he's the best thing that they've ever heard. The people my age and older think he is a snake oil salesman. And the women, by and large, think he's Weasley (ph) and don't like him at all, find him impolite and insufferable.
 
JENNINGS: Yes. He has a real ability to just sluff (ph) off and forget about things that he said five minutes ago, five days ago, five weeks ago.
 
NAVARRO: Or wrote about in his books.
 
JENNINGS: Yes, attitudes that he's exhibited and pretends like it never happened, and he did that tonight. It was interesting.
 
COLLINS: Scott Jennings, Ana Navarro, as always, thank you for watching the town halls with me and here to break it all down.
 
Thank you so much for watching our special coverage tonight of the Republican Presidential Town Hall with the Vivek Ramaswamy.
 
Stick around because King Charles starts right now.
 
GAYLE KING, CNN HOST: Welcome, welcome. We thank you for joining us tonight. This is our third episode of King Charles, our weekly show right here on CNN, about the news that matters to us and hopefully to all of you.
 
And, Charles, I don't know about you, we're three shows in, and people are very comfortable stopping me on the street telling me what they think. Is this happening to you too?
 
CHARLES BARKLEY, CNN HOST: Yes.
 
KING: Okay, one person just said to me the other day, why do you call it King Charles?
 <br>[22:05:00]
 
Why do you let Charles allow the show to be named after him? And I said, but it's called King Charles. Yes, but he's taking all the title. Do people say that to you?
 
BARKLEY: And, first of all, they're dumber than rocks, because if they actually look -- if you look at that monitor, fools, it says Gayle King and Charles Barkley.
 
KING: And then I said, well, it's called Gayle King, so that was one thing. The other thing people say to me, could you tell Charles Barkley to stop yelling? We can hear him. I never feel like you're yelling. Do you feel like you're yelling?
 
BARKLEY: I don't think I'm yelling.
 
KING: I don't he feels -- I don't think you're yelling either.
 
BARKLEY: I definitely don't think I'm yelling.
 
KING: The other thing they said to me, is Charles okay sitting in that chair? He looks like he's uncomfortable.
 
BARKLEY: Listen, these were the same people, if I laid back, they'd be like, why does he always know you are. You know, listen --
 
KING: You are comfortable in the chair?
 
BARKLEY: I am. And, first of all, I want to give you credit. Your color selection on the chairs is magnificent.
 
KING: No. When I went to Charles and said, what do you think about these colors? What do you think about this style chair? He go, yes, I don't care about the chair. You pick out the -- I don't care about that. I don't care about that. I look at it as even I get sometimes taken aback by the K.C. because I think Kansas City or I think Kelly Clarkson, but it really is King Charles. I sort of see us like Kelly and Mark, the couple that's not married without the hot sex, but we're doing okay.
 
BARKLEY: We're good. We made it three episodes. We're good. We're on a roll.
 
KING: We're on a roll. We've got an absolutely jam-packed show for you tonight, including an exclusive intrepid reporting from our own Clarissa Ward. She is so good. We are the first news organization to get unaccompanied access to Gaza. Clarissa has a footage and you will see it here first and only here. We hope you won't miss that.
 
We'll also talk to Bomani Jones tonight about the explosion of gambling. You know a little bit about gambling around sports.
 
BARKLEY: Yes.
 
KING: Do you want to elaborate? Is that it?
 
BARKLEY: No.
 
KING: Okay. And what it means for everyone involved.
 
And one of the stars of the color purple. You can't say color purple without singing it, Corey Hawkins is here. He's going to talk to us about stepping into the shoes of a classic film and cultural touchstone for so many of us. And, Charles, here's the question. Is there a limit on how long you should be engaged?
 
BARKLEY: Yes.
 
KING: You want to share later or now?
 
BARKLEY: Later.
 
KING: Let's hear it later.
 
If you've been watching the news today, we know it's been heavy. It's a lot of bad stuff out in the world today. But there is a story here in New York, across the country, bringing people a whole lot of joy. I love the story, the unexpected rise of Tommy DeVito.
 
Take a look at the front page. The undrafted -- he's undrafted, third string quarterback for the New York Giants has basically taken over this city. He's won one, two, three games in a row. That doesn't seem like a lot, but it's a big deal here.
 
BARKLEY: It's only three he's played.
 
KING: Okay. He lives at home with his parents and his mom still does his laundry. He's 25. He was just named the NFC Player of the Week.
 
So, what are you thinking as you watch this story? I can't get enough of this guy and his family, and his family.
 
BARKLEY: I think it's amazing.
 
KING: Yes.
 
BARKLEY: I think it's great. It's exactly why I was so upset about Florida State not making the playoff, because if we're going to say -- if we're going to lose starters, we don't cancel the season. Florida State won three games in a row with backup. That's a great story.
 
The New York Giants have won three games with this kid because the beautiful thing about sports, we lace them up, you go play, and whoever wins, wins, wins. But just because their starting quarterback got hurt, we don't cancel the season.
 
KING: Yes.
 
BARKLEY: I love what this kid is doing, and it's a great story. Living at his home with his parents, hey, man, that is awesome.
 
KING: At 25?
 
BARKLEY: At 25. He got to make sure he got a job.
 
KING: Okay.
 
BARKLEY: This is of --
 
KING: And I understand mom is a really good cook and she does his laundry, too.
 
We've got some late news. This happened just as we were starting to go on the air. Golden State Warriors forward, that's Draymond Green, has been suspended indefinitely after striking an opposing player in the face last night. Now he says, Charles, that it was an accident. You've seen the videotape.
 
BARKLEY: Yes, he's lying. He's lying.
 
KING: Why do you say that?
 
BARKLEY: Well, because if you ask -- look, he takes a look where the guy's face is. If he had to just flip -- flail around, he wouldn't have caught him squarely on the face. You have to really slow the tape down.
 
KING: I don't see him looking around.
 
BARKLEY: Look. Oh, you saw it then, though, didn't you?
 
KING: No. But, listen, he spins around.
 
BARKLEY: Yes, with a fist.
 
KING: I've met Draymond. I've always thought he was a really nice guy.
 
BARKLEY: I like Draymond, but you can't punch guys.
 
KING: But the way he was spinning around -- I'm being serious here. The way he was spinning around, it did seem like it was sort of out of control. It didn't look deliberate to me.
 
BARKLEY: He didn't slap him. He punched him. There's a difference.
 
KING: Okay.
 
BARKLEY: I'm surprised it's indefinite. I thought it would be a big number because he was just suspended for five games. Indefinite makes me -- I don't even know what that really means, honestly. But it sounds to me like they're going to make him undergo some type of counseling.
 <br>[22:10:01]
 
Listen, everybody likes Draymond.
 
KING: They do, right?
 
BARKLEY: Yes. But at some point, if you keep doing stupid stuff, we can't keep saying he's a good dude. I mean, yes, every likes Draymond, but if you keep doing stupid stuff, you lose the right to be called a good guy.
 
KING: Yes, the same stuff. I'm a little worried about that.
 
And here's a story that I know you've had feelings about. We were talking to the people outside before we started. Athletes from Russia and Belarus who were banned from most international competitions in 2022 after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, we know this story, will be able to compete in the Paris 2024 Olympics, but they have to do it as neutral athletes. So, that means no flag, no anthem, no colors or any other identifications, whatsoever, of Russia or Belarus will be displayed at the Olympic Games, Paris 2024.
 
Now, I know, listen, you're the only athlete on stage right now. This may surprise you, but I have no athletic ability. I know you thought I did, right?
 
BARKLEY: That's why I'm taking you golfing.
 
KING: Golfing, boring. But you have stood on the podium. You know what it feels like to win a gold medal.
 
BARKLEY: Yes.
 
KING: So, I'm curious about what that's like and what that means if you win a medal and now you're standing there and you can't play anything associated with your country.
 
BARKLEY: This is a really interesting situation for me. Number one, out of everything I've been blessed to do in my life, standing on that podium, when they playing the national anthem, it gives you chills. It gives you chills. I was blessed to do it twice. And I'm standing beside some of the greatest players ever, and we're like, yo, man, this has given us chills. So, it's one of the most amazing feelings I've ever had in my life.
 
But the problem I have, why are the athletes being punished for some -- they're getting punished and penalized for something their president is doing.
 
Now, obviously, the situation in Ukraine and Russia is awful and it's evil, but unless if these guys and ladies haven't fought in the war, they shouldn't get penalized, in my opinion. I just don't -- are we going to hold politicians in the United States some of the stuff we've done? Are we going to not play our national anthem?
 
So, I think it's really unfair to them, but it's one of the greatest feelings I've ever had in my life.
 
KING: I'll bet. I still get chills when I hear the national anthem at any event. And whether I -- regardless of where you are, there's something about those words and the music that always makes me so proud.
 
But when you get the gold medal, what is it like to get the gold medal, Charles? And how valuable are they, because they seemed very heavy?
 
BARKLEY: Well, they're not bad (ph), but you probably should win the bronze medal.
 
KING: Why? BARKLEY: Well, because I gave to -- I had two gold medals. I gave one to my mother and grandmother. And I said, you know what, we should probably get these insured just in case somebody steal them.
 
So, I took them to the jeweler.
 
KING: Where do you live?
 
BARKLEY: A small town, Leeds, Alabama. I said, in case somebody steal them. I took them to the jeweler. He said, well, how much do you think they worth? I said, I don't know. That's what -- I bought them here in Fuji (ph). He says, well, they're worth about $19.95 because they're just gold plated. And he's made the joke. He said, if you really wanted some value, but you probably should have won the bronze medal.
 
So, it was a really cute story, but the medals have great sentimental value. Representing your country, it was an honor. 
 
KING: Yes, I totally agree with you.
 
Coming up, a CNN exclusive with the one and only Clarissa Ward. CNN, we want you to know, is the first western media outlet to enter Southern Gaza and report independently. And we're the only ones that have that footage. Coming up next, what Clarissa saw right after the break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[22:17:28]
 
KING: It may be hard to believe, but we are now 67 days into the war between Israel and Hamas. And our next guest has been crucial in bringing our reporting to you.
 
I have to tell you, her name is Clarissa Ward, and I used to work with Clarissa Ward back in the day. I have always admired her reporting because she is a badass and she is fearless, especially her desire to be on the ground where the biggest and often most dangerous news is breaking. There she is. And tonight is no different.
 
Thanks to Clarissa, CNN is the first western media outlet to get access into southern Gaza and report in Gaza, rather, and report independently. She has footage you won't see anywhere else. And this is the first time she's talking about it since returning.
 
Clarissa Ward is CNN's chief international correspondent. Clarissa, we thank you for joining us. It's really good to see you.
 
CLARISSA WARD, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Thanks, Gayle. It's really good to be with you.
 
KING: Every time I see you on T.V., I tense up a little bit. And please, please let her be safe, let all the people over there who are covering this war, but it's so crucial and so critical the job that you're doing.
 
But I want to start with the obvious, because most of the world is watching from home. We're watching from the safety of our homes, watching from the safety of our countries, wherever that may be. But you are often there. You have a front row seat. What are you seeing on the ground?
 
WARD: So, up until this point, we've been lobbying for weeks and weeks to try to get into Gaza, Gayle, but it just hasn't been possible. Basically, the borders have been blocked by Israeli officials, by Egyptian officials. And so the reporting that's been done up until now has been done by the extraordinarily brave journalists of Gaza who have been paying an incredibly high price. More than 60 journalists killed, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, since this round of hostilities began. That is truly an extraordinary number.
 
We enjoyed a very privileged position on this trip. We went in for a short window. There was de-confliction preparation that went into it to ensure our security and the security of the UAE medical volunteers, the Emirati medical volunteers who we went in with to their field hospital. But still, even in that brief window, Gayle, you really got a sense of the absolute horrors that have been taking place in Gaza.
 
This hospital was filled with the youngest victims of this war, children who have been disfigured, who are in full body casts, who are covered in burns.
 <br>[22:20:03]
 
According to the United Nations, some two-thirds of the deaths that have happened since Israel retaliated after the horrific October 7th attacks with this massive bombardment. Two-thirds of the victims have been women and children.
 
And we definitely saw that borne out in this hospital. There was a strike just minutes after we arrived near the hospital. Two casualties brought in, a 13-year-old boy who had lost half his leg, an older man with his foot hanging off.
 
And so it was chilling, it was harrowing, and a very sobering experience to see just how difficult life is on the ground there.
 
KING: And once you see it, Clarissa, you cannot unsee it, but I'm just struck by something you said. You said there was a strike there at the hospital while you were there. What happens? What do you do in that situation? What does that mean exactly? In the movies you see it, and it looks like the whole place is decimated. What happens?
 
WARD: Well, I think the most interesting thing about it, Gayle, was that it was very loud. I can't say exactly how close it was. But the doctor who was showing me around didn't even flinch. He turned to me and he said, this is our everyday, this happens about 20 times a day.
 
And then minutes later, he gets a phone call saying, the first casualties are coming in. Because this field hospital that the United Arab Emirates has set up near the southern border is literally, Gayle, the only hospital with empty beds in Gaza.
 
And so what's happening is that these casualties will be rushed to one hospital. They will tie some kind of a makeshift tourniquet. They don't even have tourniquets left, most of these hospitals. And then they get brought to this field hospital, which is state of the art, which has MRIs, which has supplies coming in on a regular basis, although it is still a challenge every single day.
 
And so this has become part of the fabric of daily life for ordinary Gazans. It's not something you can ever truly get used to, particularly when you see the scale of the suffering, when you see the fact that it's women and children who are largely bearing the brunt of it.
 
But there's a sense in Gaza right now that nobody has time to even take a breath. You just have to keep going, keep moving, keep trying to save lives to the best of your ability. And I do think it's important to underscore as well, Gayle, that for the people of Gaza, we get to leave at the end of our visit. They do not. They have no way of going out and they have no safe place to go to. And they are facing a level of bombardment that does not have a precedent in modern warfare. It is truly a catastrophe, Gayle.
 
BARKLEY: How is the humanitarian aid getting through to all the people? I know that was a big question mark we've been talking about over here for a while. Is any humanitarian aid getting through?
 
WARD: So, Charles, some aid is getting through, but just nowhere near the volume that needs to be getting through.
 
There's this one border crossing between Egypt and Gaza, the Rafah border crossing. It is totally overwhelmed. It was never built to deal with this capacity. When you approach that border, you just see miles and miles of trucks lining up, hundreds of them, that are laden with this aid that is so desperately needed.
 
And even when they manage to cut through the bureaucracy and go through the various inspections and get into Gaza, the problem, according to aid workers, is they can't actually distribute the aid to where it needs to go because the bombardment is so ferocious, because it is so dangerous to make road moves around Gaza at the moment.
 
And so, essentially, these aid workers are completely hamstrung and the ordinary people are very much cut off from the basic necessities, whether it's food, whether it's medicine. I talked to the doctors again. They said, we're getting injuries in here and illnesses that should be relatively easy to treat.
 
But by the time they reach us, we're looking at severe cases of sepsis, of infection, simply because the hospitals and medical facilities in Gaza are completely overwhelmed. The bottom has fallen out in the healthcare system. And so you're seeing things that should be easy to deal with turn into life threatening diseases, illnesses and infections.
 
KING: Clarissa, before you go, listen, I remember when you had your first child and now you're the mother of three. And I've often wondered this about you. When I described you as a badass, I really mean that because I've seen you in action. I know how you work. I know how hard you work.
 <br>[22:25:00]
 
How are you so fearless? Are you ever afraid? Are you ever afraid? And do you feel safe when you're there?
 
WARD: So, first of all, I just have to say, Gayle, that, honestly, the real badasses are the journalists in Gaza who are doing this, who are getting killed and injured every single day, the doctors who are staying in these hospitals that are getting bombed, where there is a complete breakdown and continue with no sleep, with very little support to do whatever they can to try to help their own people.
 
We enjoyed a very privileged position on this occasion. We did feel relatively safe. We were only on the ground for a matter of hours.
 
But as a war correspondent who's been doing this for almost 20 years now, and particularly as a mother, you never get used to seeing children who have been maimed, who have been disfigured, who have lost their entire families.
 
We spoke to the aunt of an 18-month-old called Amir, who doesn't know yet that both of his parents and his siblings were killed in a strike that has left him literally broken. That is not something that ever gets easier to process. And I can honestly say I don't think we've ever seen it quite on this scale as what we are seeing take place on the ground in Gaza right now.
 
KING: All right, Clarissa. I think you're being very modest about what you do because you put yourself in harm's way. I know that there have been times that it's been very dicey for you, but I appreciate you talking about the bravery of others, but I also know the job that you do.
 
Thank you so much, and we really hope that you will stay safe. I can't wait to see you again. Thank you so much.
 
BARKLEY: Thank you.
 
WARD: Thank you.
 
KING: We'll be right back with more of King Charles.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHARLES BARKLEY, HOST: We got a couple questions for you. Go ahead, Miss Gayle. 
 
KING: Okay. Have you ever bet on sports? 
 
UNKNOWN: Yes. 
 
KING: And what's the most you've ever won or lost? Are you crying because you're here with -- are you crying? 
 
UNKNOWN: Yeah, I've lost a lot of money.
 
KING: Have you ever bet on sports? 
 
CARLY: Yes. 
 
KING: Oh, all right, Carly. How much did you win or lose? 
 
CARLY: Well, I kind of lost a lot of money. 
 
BARKLEY: Nothing wrong with betting on sports. 
 
KING: Have you ever bet on sports? 
 
UNKNOWN: I have not, actually. 
 
BARKLEY: Wow. 
 
UNKNOWN: Believe it or not. 
 
KING: I believe you because you've never lied to us. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
BARKLEY: Those were some of the people we talked to earlier today about their own betting habits. If you follow sports in anywhere across any media, then you're also seeing the gambling ads everywhere. 
 
GAYLE KING, HOST: They are everywhere. That's because since the 2018 Supreme Court ruling cleared the way for legal sports gambling, 39 states rather have or are about to legalize it. So last year, Americans bet more than -- listen to this number -- $93 billion with a B on sports. 
 
For reference, the NFL reported its revenue as $12 billion last year. Bomani Jones knows a thing or two about this topic. Why do you know a thing or two about this topic, Bomani Jones? Hold that, he's an Emmy Award winning sports commentator and host of "Right Time with Bomani Jones" podcast. Welcome, welcome, 
 
BOMANI JONES, HOST, THE RIGHT TIME WITH BOMANI JONES PODCAST: I was just about to read that about myself. I was going to say, well, actually, I'm an Emmy Award winning sports commentator. 
 
KING: Yes, you are. So guys, has it gotten out of control? JONES: I mean, I have been watching games and it's in the broadcast
 
 where it seems that the broadcast is built for people to gamble. Like it's one thing if we're playing a game on television or we're watching it and they're letting you know, hey, you can do this. Hey, if you want to gamble or whatever. 
 
But the crux of the broadcast now seems more and more geared toward making people gamble than it is talking about the games. And I contend that none of us got into sports because you wanted to gamble. 
 
It might have been something that you found after the fact, but I feel like we're losing the plot in the direction that we're going in, but the way that we're presenting sports as a reason to gamble as opposed to the gambling is something to do while you watch sports. 
 
KING: Yeah, well, we heard you in that piece. Charles, saying there's nothing wrong with gambling. 
 
BARKLEY: Well, because I have dirty hands. 
 
KING: Okay. What does that mean? 
 
BARKLEY: I advertise for FanDuel. So, I'm part of it and I love to gamble. Do I think it's gotten out of hand? Yes. As a person who loves to gamble, he does endorsement for a website or app. Because --
 
KING: What do you get out of it? I'm just curious. 
 
BARKLEY: Well, I get paid. 
 
KING: No, no. What do you get out of gambling? 
 
BARKLEY: I love to gamble. 
 
KING: You were just in Las Vegas last week. 
 
BARKLEY: Yes and I stayed up all night gambling. 
 
KING: You stayed up all night gambling? 
 
BARKLEY: All night. I did. 
 
KING: What does that mean? What does that mean?
 
BARKLEY: It's exciting. I mean, I did. 
 
KING: Did you win? 
 
BARKLEY: I did. I won a little bit, but it was fun. I love to gamble. 
 
KING: Can I ask what a little bit is? 
 
BARKLEY: A little bit. 
 
KING: Okay. 
 
BARKLEY: Like a little like your outfit. I can get you another one of those. The problem I have when I say it's gotten out of hand --
 
KING: Yeah.
 
BARKLEY: Like, if you want to bet on the game, I got no problem with that. 
 
KING: Okay.
 
BARKLEY: But when you can bet who's going to score the next basket, well, the person got to make both free throws and things like that. You're just throwing gasoline on the fire.
 
KING: Yeah. 
 
BARKLEY: Like I say, I love the gamma. I'm never going to get on here and be a hypocrite. But I'm never going to bet during the game. I don't even bet first half, second half. 
 
KING: So, you bet before the game. 
 
BARKLEY: I bet before the game. Because I think, number one, if you bet at halftime, you're chasing. But also, like, I got no idea who's going to score the next baskets in an NBA game. 
 
KING: And people are betting like that. 
 
BARKLEY: Yes. 
 
KING: That specific. 
 
BARKLEY: Yes. 
 
JONES: Yeah, like there is a daily fantasy app, which is, I mean, gambling more or less, right, is by a different name, that advertises on my podcast. Basically, anybody that's in this business now, the money is coming from gambling, because that was where the opportunity for money post-COVID. People missed a lot of checks during COVID, so you had to find new money. 
 <br>[22:35:00]
 
This was the new money. And so the gambling money has been coming in at every turn, and we have to be honest about what we're doing. We're offering people little dollops of cocaine, right? Little dollops of cocaine. Like this is a dopamine rush that people get when they gamble. There's the excitement that comes with it. 
 
The difference between gambling and every other activity is it's the only one where you can put in money and you might get your money back. You can have a good time on X amount of dollars and you may walk out with that same money that you have. People are really into it, but we're taking something that we know can really get people charged up. 
 
KING: Charged up. 
 
JONES: And we just give them a little bit at a time, a little bit at a time, and that's a bit worse. 
 
KING: But guys, what about reports from players that say they get a lot of hate on social media? Chris Boucher from the Raptors said, somebody said, I chose the wrong slave today because I only had five points, he needed me to score 10. Or Houston Rockets, Fred VanVleet said, he gets DMs every day that said, I hope your mom dies. Every day on DM because he didn't play the way somebody betted for him to do. 
 
JONES: Yup.
 
KING: How is this okay? 
 
JONES: It's not okay. 
 
KING: Yeah, but why would you think that gambling is good though if it's going to lead to that kind of behavior? 
 
BARKLEY: Just cause, well --
 
KING: Is that extreme? Is that extreme? 
 
BARKLEY: Well, it's extreme, but it's going to happen more and more because when somebody bets on you as a player, like if you don't do that, they're going to say bet, because everybody's Superman on the keyboard at home behind their computer. They would guarantee you they wouldn't say that to Mr. Boucher's face. 
 
KING: Yeah.
 
BARKLEY: They would not say that to Fred's face. But a lot of these people are cowards. But you know, one thing that scares me, Gail, that we need to touch on, kids should not be able.
 
KING: Exactly. 
 
BARKLEY: Every kid we know. 
 
KING: More and more kids will want to hear that too. 
 
BARKLEY: Every kid got a phone. They need to find a better way to make sure kids can't bet on sports. There should be an age limit, in my opinion, just because you've got a cell phone that can get an app. That should be an age limit in my opinion where you should not be able to bet on sports. So, I mean --
 
KING: Isn't there an age limit, 18? Isn't there an age limit? 
 
JONES: I mean, you know, the age limits are there. It's just about how well you're able to enforce them. And people doing basically the equivalent of Joe Camel of gambling, which is like finding these ways to make gambling look cool to kids. Like all of this is going to happen. The capitalism is going to win out. And we are going to look up one day and we're going to ask ourselves what the hell we were doing. 
 
KING: Yeah. Well, Bomani, you had the last word on that. Thank you. If you or someone you know is struggling with gambling, call or text the National Problem Gambling Helpline at 1-800-GAMBLER. Coming up next, how long is too long to be engaged to be married? Our first installment of King Charles Court of Etiquette coming up next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 <br>[22:42:18]
 
BARKLEY: "Sports Illustrated" Sportsperson of the Year and my own pick for Sportsperson of the Year, Dion Sanders. He's going through it right now, Gayle. 
 
KING: He's going through it right now and it is true. We've all heard about it. We all love around here, but unfortunately, we have to tell you there's been a breakup. The Colorado football coach and his fiance of five years, producer Tracy Edmonds, recently ended their decade- long relationship, which got us thinking around here in today's King Charles Court of Etiquette. Number one, I love this graphic. Don't you? 
 
BARKLEY: I hate that graphic. 
 
KING: I love this graphic. 
 
BARKLEY: You got my big old head with that little crown and got your little head with that big old crown. 
 
KING: Well, what I'm thinking is they just wanted to showcase all the brain power there. I like it. I like it. Here's a question. Go ahead, go ahead. 
 
BARKLEY: You saying I got a small brain? 
 
KING: No, I said it's showcasing that big brain of yours. 
 
BARKLEY: Okay. 
 
KING: So, you're not paying attention. 
 
BARKLEY: Okay. 
 
KING: Okay, now this is the thing. I want to say upfront, we both really like Dion. And I actually know Tracy and like them too. 
 
BARKLEY: Dion, I love you, man. I love you, Dion. 
 
KING: Yes, and he's been going through it on and off the football field. I like them both. We should also say, neither Dion or Tracy have asked us for any type of advice on this issue. They've never asked me. Did they ask you? 
 
BARKLEY: No, they did not. 
 
KING: So, we have no personal knowledge. So, we're just using that as a jumping off point. And the question is, how long is too long to be engaged? Now, they were engaged for five years. 
 
BARKLEY: Two. 
 
KING: Two?
 
BARKLEY: Two is the number, Gail. 
 
KING: Two is the number. 
 
BARKLEY: Two is the magic number. 
 
KING: Why? 
 
BARKLEY: You can only be engaged for two years. 
 
KING: Why? 
 
BARKLEY: A man know after two years if you're the one. 
 
KING: And so, if he doesn't propose after two years, what does that mean? 
 
BARKLEY: Kick rock, keep it moving. Gail, two years is plenty of time. 
 
KING: I disagree with you about that. 
 
BARKLEY: What? 
 
KING: Because I think that when you get engaged, it means that you want to marry the person. So, I like a year. I like a year. 
 
BARKLEY: Oh, you say it should be quicker.
 
KING: Yes, I do. I think it should be quicker. I think maybe 18 months, maybe 18 months, but I think, two -- why do you say two? Because a year you've gone through all the holidays, the families have met each other. If somebody's engaged you for five years, which is in that case, what does that mean to you? Does that mean there's not going to be a marriage?
 
BARKLEY: I don't think there's going to be one. 
 
KING: No? 
 
BARKLEY: That's just my personal opinion. Two years is to match. You know after two years that somebody's the one. 
 
KING: Yeah, yeah. I say, I say, a year. Okay, we also -- everybody in the room, we all like money. We can agree on that, right guys? Everybody likes money, right? 
 
AUDIENCE: Yes. BARKLEY: Yes.
 
KING: Well, the most sought, I do too. Well, the most sought after player in baseball history -- I love this story -- Shohei Otani has just signed a record shattering deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers. What is the number, Charles? What was he paid?
 
BARKLEY: $700 million for 10 years. 
 
KING: That makes $70 million a year, but there's a catch. The baseball star is going to defer $68 million per year until the end of the contract when he'd likely retire. 
 <br>[22:45:00]
 
Meaning, the Dodgers will only pay him $2 million every year while he's playing, allowing the team to spend more money on players right now. So, I actually thought that this was a good idea. And I still do because --
 
BARKLEY: You think it's a good idea? 
 
KING: I do, because he went to the Dodgers and suggested that. I think it's a way of bringing in more talent. 
 
BARKLEY: Yeah, they're cheating at the cap. 
 
KING: How is that cheating? 
 
BARKLEY: Well, he's the best player in baseball. 
 
KING: Right. 
 
BARKLEY: And they're only paying him $2 million. 
 
KING: Right. 
 
BARKLEY: But they're going to be able to, first of all, they already got one of the best teams in baseball. They got Mookie Betts, Freddie Freeman, guys like that. They got a great team. But now they're going to be bringing, they're kind of trying to buy a championship. I don't think that's fair. 
 
KING: But I looked at that as being, I looked at it as being very magnanimous on Shohei's part to say, I'll defer my salary. 
 
BARKLEY: What does magnanimous mean? 
 
KING: You know what magnanimous means.
 
BARKLEY: No, I don't. I've never used that word before. What does that mean? 
 
KING: It means being very generous. 
 
BARKLEY: Well, why don't you just say very generous then? KING: It means very generous. So, you don't think that that's such a nice --
 
BARKLEY: I do not. I do not. I don't think it's fair at all. 
 
KING: I liked it. I liked it. Okay, also, this happened today. Well, this happened for me today, happened to you for last night. Charles and I have some very nice friends. I was in D.C. earlier today to celebrate Oprah during her portrait unveiling at the National Portrait Gallery. I took the Amtrak up, took the Amtrak back, made it in time to do the show. So, this portrait of Oprah, listen, listen to this, will be alongside the likes of Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, Abraham Lincoln, Harry Tubman and John F. Kennedy. And now Oprah Winfrey's in the National Portrait Gallery. Isn't that cool? 
 
BARKLEY: This one -- she's one of the most accomplished women in the history of the world. 
 
KING: No, today she was called a cultural icon, check, check. Impact on the world, they said, is wide and deep and that she never runs out of ideas. This is true. Never has changed her commitment to make us all better. So, congratulations to Oprah tonight. 
 
BARKLEY: You know, she's one of, when I met her the first time, I was like, hard to believe I was speechless. She's one of the most --
 
KING: You were speechless? 
 
BARKLEY: I was. She's one of the most accomplished women --
 
KING: I think so. 
 
BARKLEY: In the history of the world, not just television. 
 
KING: Yes, yes.
 
BARKLEY: What she's done on television, all television, is, I'm not friendly with her, to be honest with you. I've met her a few times. She's always been great and gracious, but it's been an honor and a privilege to watch her entire career. 
 
KING: And she speaks highly of you too, Charles. So, that's one of my friends, but your friend had a good night, too. 
 
BARKLEY: Yeah, I want to give a shout out to Ernie Johnson. 
 
KING: Hey, Ernie Johnson. Shout out to you. 
 
BARKLEY: He went into the broadcast in Hall of Fame last night. We surprised him. 
 
KING: How so? 
 
BARKLEY: We were supposed to be on television. 
 
KING: So, there's Shaq. There's Shaq. BARKLEY: Yeah, Shaq's the ugly one. Kenny's the next short ugly one.
 
 And then good looking in the back there was me. 
 
KING: And the good looking one is you? 
 
BARKLEY: Yes. 
 
KING: Okay, if you say so yourself. 
 
BARKLEY: Well, that's one of my secrets, Gayle.
 
KING: What? 
 
BARKLEY: I hang out with ugly people so I look better. But that was a great honor for Ernie, well deserved going into the Hall of Fame. And we surprised him. He is well deserved. 
 
KING: Yeah, you know what I'm thinking, Charles? We know some really nice people. 
 
BARKLEY: Yes, we do. Congratulations. Congratulations, Ernie. 
 
BARKLEY: Congratulations to Oprah and Ernie Johnson. 
 
KING: Yes, yes. Hear, hear. We are so excited about our next guest. Can't wait for you to meet him. Corey Hawkins is here. He's joining us to talk about his new role in "The Color Purple". I actually wore purple tonight because of Corey. What is like -- why are you laughing? 
 
BARKLEY: I love that. 
 
KING: I did, I wore it for him. What is it like to be part of recreating such an iconic movie? We'll talk to Corey Hawkins about that right after the break. We'll be right back. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[22:53:36]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KING: That is Corey Hawkins in action. He can sing, as they say. He is a two-time Tony and Emmy nominee. Thank you very much. Playing Harpo in this latest adaptation of Alice Walker's similar work, "The Color Purple", which will be in theaters on Christmas Day. We welcome you to "King Charles", Corey. Can I say, I wore purple in your honor today. 
 
COREY HAWKINS, EMMY AND TONY NOMINATED ACTOR: Oh, come on now. This is an honor to be here with you two legends and talking about this beautiful work. And thank you for the beautiful purple, by the way. 
 
KING: Yes, well, that's our color. 
 
HAWKINS: Yeah, yeah. 
 
KING: But really, we're so glad you're here. Charles said that "Color Purple", the original was his favorite. You said that was your favorite movie. 
 
BARKLEY: It's up there. It's my favorite movie. And did you feel added pressure? Because like, when something's done like perfection, like the first "Color Purple", then you're doing this adaptation or remake, however you want to phrase it. 
 
HAWKINS: Yeah, especially in our community, too. 
 
KING: No, Corey before you came, he goes, I don't know why they had to redo it because the original is always so good. Why do they have to redo it? If it ain't broke, don't fix it. 
 
BARKLEY: You sound like my uncle. 
 
HAWKINS: To that we say -- we say, bring yourself to the film. Because this version of "The Color Purple" is, as Oprah says, it ain't your mama's "Color Purple". It's not a --it's a beautiful re-imagining, it's not a remake of "The Color Purple". And that's what's special about it, because it invites the older generation, but it invites the younger generation, as well. 
 <br>[22:55:00]
 
And it's just, there's a power in Alice Walker's words in this poem that she wrote in that novel that lives on. So I'm just thankful to be a part of it. 
 
BARKLEY: You know, when I was reading on your bio, Juilliard. 
 
HAWKINS: Yes, Sir.
 
KING: Juilliard-trained.
 
BARKLEY: And like, as a young kid, when did you make, you like, this is what I want to do and then decide to go to Juilliard? 
 
HAWKINS: It was a long journey to get there. But, and again, you never know what God sort of has in store for you in your life. But that journey, I mean, it started with being inspired by my mother, by my grandmother, black women in my household, by Debbie Allen when I was a kid who came to D.C. 
 
KING: Debbie Allen inspired you? 
 
HAWKINS: Yeah, she was like an auntie to all of us, like, you know, just in terms of inspiring young artists and reminding us that anything was possible. And had I not had that, I honestly wouldn't be sitting here in this moment. 
 
BARKLEY: It's funny you say that. HAWKINS: Yeah, it's true. It's real.
 
BARKLEY: No, it's just funny you saying that. I think we got --
 
KING: Why is it funny he said that, Charles? 
 
BARKLEY: Because remember, we were trying to figure out how to get there. We got a surprise for you. 
 
KING: A surprise for you, Corey Hawkins. 
 
BARKLEY: We do. 
 
HAWKINS: Okay. 
 
KING: Roll tape, please. 
 
HAWKINS: Oh, wow. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DEBBIE ALLEN, ONE OF COREY HAWKINS' FIRST MENTORS: Hi, King Charles. Surprise, surprise, Corey. Yes, it's Debbie Allen, one of your first mentors when you were seven years old at the Kennedy Center, teeny tiny, tepid Theo. Honey, I am just so excited over your career. You're living up to my expectation and more. I knew at seven years old you were going to go all the way and look at you now. 
 
BARKLEY: Wow.
 
KING: Look at you now, Corey. 
 
HAWKINS: Wow. 
 
BARKLEY: No, but we were in the production meeting. We were trying to figure out how to, we were like, well, what if he, how do we get to Debbie Allen? 
 
HAWKINS: Wow. 
 
BARKLEY: And you said it, man. 
 
KING: Because we had heard she was one of your mentors and we reached out to her. 
 
HAWKINS: Yeah.
 
KING: And we said, but how do we get a conversation about Debbie Allen? You just did it naturally. 
 
HAWKINS: It's crazy. 
 
KING: Yeah, she really meant something to you. 
 
HAWKINS: She did. And that's the type of woman that she is. She's selfless in that. She's been inspiring people for generations. She's touched so many people that you don't even know. So, I'm just glad that I still get to speak her name and honor her because if it wasn't for her, you know, I wouldn't be where I am. I truly believe that she spoke life into me and I'm thankful for that. 
 
KING: This movie has been so much about sisterhood.
 
HAWKINS: That's right. 
 
KING: But there also is a very important scene. The men play a very pivotal role in this movie, as you know. 
 
HAWKINS: Yeah. 
 
KING: How has it changed you or affected you being part of this production? 
 
HAWKINS: A lot of what we're dealing with is generational trauma and abuse and how to break those cycles of generational trauma, especially within our community, but in the larger community. And that's what "The Color Purple" does beautifully. 
 
Harpo, for me, is a beautiful sort of manifestation of black joy, black boy joy, you know? And I'm glad that I got the opportunity to breathe life into him because that's what he represents for me. You know -- possibility, hope, joy. He loves Sophia with all his heart. 
 
KING: He really does. And it's also a way, you know, to talk about how we love our black women today, you know, in ways that maybe our parents and our parents' parents didn't have the language to. 
 
KING: And I've heard that this movie has been healing as a relationship between you and your dad. I didn't understand what that meant.
 
HAWKINS: Yeah. My father and I, we've had a strong, beautiful, but also complicated relationship growing up, and my father means the world to me. And it was his first time getting to come to a premiere, or anything. 
 
KING: Oh, his first premiere with you? 
 
HAWKINS: Yeah, with me was "The Color Purple" last week. And it's crazy to look over and see this man who, you know -- my whole life I have a vision of who he is and just to watch him be affected by this film. He never saw the original. 
 
BARKLEY: Wow. 
 
HAWKINS: He's not a movie watcher. But to watch him get emotional and to be able to talk to him about it afterwards was powerful. It was powerful. It changed me, I know it changed him, but that's what we talking about healing. Because it is a story about sisterhood, but it's also about how we all come together, you know. BARKLEY: Oh man, I'm so proud of your success.
 
HAWKINS: Thank you, man.
 
BARKLEY: You know, going back to "Straight Outta Compton", the 24 remake. 
 
HAWKINS: Yeah.
 
KING: "In the Heights". 
 
BARKLEY: "In the Heights", man. Continued success. 
 
HAWKINS: Thank you. Thank you and God bless you. 
 
KING: Cheering you on always, Corey Hawkins. And I know what I'll be doing Christmas Day. Where are you going to be Christmas Day, Corey Hawkins?
 
HAWKINS: Oh, we're going to be in the theater. You know what I'm saying? 
 
KING: We're going to be in the theater. We hope everybody follows us there. Thank you. Thank you so much. 
 
HAWKINS: Thank you all for having me. 
 
KING: It's a beautiful way to end the show with you, tonight. We thank you for watching King Charles. Charles, we coming back next Wednesday? I'm coming back. 
 
BARKLEY: I'll be here. 
 
KING: Same time, same place. 
 <br>[23:00:00]
 
We're going to change our clothes. You can catch me tomorrow on CBS Mornings at 7 o'clock. We'll see you next week. Abby Phillip will be here tomorrow night at 10 o'clock, fresh off her trip to Iowa. But don't go anywhere, because guess what? "Laura Coates Live" starts right now.</pre>
