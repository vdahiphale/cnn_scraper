ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Hi there. Thanks for joining me. I'm Alex Marquardt in today for Fredricka Whitfield. We begin this hour with a murder investigation in Dallas, Texas where police say that a woman was shot and killed by her boyfriend over an abortion. 26-year-old Gabriella Gonzalez who lived in Texas was shot in the head the day after she returned from Colorado where she went for an abortion.
 
Let's get straight to CNN's Isabel Rosales who's been following this story for us. Isabel, what more do we know about this investigation?
 
ISABEL ROSALES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Alex, police are piecing this together. They're looking through surveillance video that captured the shooting. And also, they're speaking with witnesses including the victim's own sister who heard the shooting, unfolding. This all happened on Wednesday, Dallas police got a 911 call. They rushed to a parking lot. And they're on the ground, they found 26-year-old Gabriella Gonzalez shot and killed.
 
Now court documents indicate that through surveillance video they saw the suspect Harold Thompson walking with Gonzalez. They had been dating all of this right before the fatal shooting. Thompson in the video, the court documents detail was seen attempting to put Gonzalez in a chokehold. She then shrugs it off, and that is when Thompson reaches for a firearm and shoots Gonzales in the head.
 
And as she falls to the ground, he then continues to shoot at her. Now according to the arrest warrant, an affidavit in there, it says "further investigation revealed that Gonzalez went to Colorado to get an abortion and returned the night before. It is believed that the suspect was the father of the child. The suspect did not want the complainant to get an abortion. Now court documents also indicate here past history of violence against Gonzalez. She told police that Thompson had beaten her up several times before and he had an active family violence strangulation warrant during the time of the shooting. That was for a March incident that occurred while Gonzalez according to the court documents was pregnant with his child. So far, Gonzalez has refused to put out a statement or speak with police. He has been charged with murder and assault to a family member.
 
And according again to those court documents, he's been denied bond and will be appointed a public defender. Alex?
 
MARQUARDT: Just a horribly tragic story. Isabel Rosales, thank you very much for that report. 
 
Now to the U.S. southern border where officials are saying that they're seeing fewer migrants crossing than expected despite Title 42 expiring at midnight on Thursday. Authorities say that the long lines of people who once waited to enter the U.S. have dissipated that many of the border crossings, many officials had expected a surge after the COVID era policy expired. But there are also new warnings about a potential for that surge to worsen in the coming weeks with one Border Patrol official projecting as many as 14,000 migrants who could try to enter the U.S. per day.
 
CNN's Polo Sandoval is in El Paso, Texas. Polo, what are you seeing there?
 
POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hello again, Alex. So, it is certainly less chaotic than what authorities had expected. At least it has been that way in the last 48 hours since the lifting of Title 42. But you better believe that authorities here on the ground will certainly not take the weekend off. They are certainly going to be focusing on the well over 20,000 people that are still in CBP custody to process them and then eventually find out what happens next for them. 
 
Are they subjected to the new Biden immigration policy then potentially be sent back across the border or are they processed and released and allowed to travel into the interior? And that is really where much of the focus will be at least for the next few days. If things remain at least relatively calm here will be -- some of these American cities that will continue to see their numbers increase regardless of what we'll see here on the border.
 
I had an opportunity to speak to some local officials here on the ground, even personnel at one of the local shelters here in El Paso and they told us that they continue to see people after their process of release, setting their compass to New York primarily. That continues to be the number one destination because they either know people there or because they have resources.
 
The result, Alex, as we've been reporting for the last year will be some of these municipalities both large and small struggling to keep their head above ground in terms of providing housing and opportunities for the some of these asylum seekers. This certainly a very polarizing issue. So, regardless of whether people think they should or should not be here, the reality is they will be here for years to come with many of them more court dates well in the future.
 <br>[13:05:02]
 
The question is, what will they be able to do? And that's what we see in the last couple of days really intensify are those calls for the Biden administration to provide some kind of humanitarian relief, and eventually some kind of employment opportunity for them to work on the books while they're here in the United States. But again, the big question, what will we -- what will we see on the actual border itself?
 
I think a lot of it will depend on what some of the migrant communities just across the border from where we are, how they receive some of the news of some of the deportations that we're seeing, and also, most importantly, what we see in some of the American cities thousands of miles away from where we are. Alex?
 
MARQUARDT: Yes. A huge challenge for those border cities and towns as well as for the Biden administration. Polo Sandoval in El Paso, Texas. Thank you very much.
 
Now here with me now with more perspective on all this is Raul Reyes. He is an immigration attorney who also writes for CNN Opinion. Raul, thank you so much for joining us. I want to ask you first about the change in policy. Title 42 has expired. Title eight, as it's known, has now taken effect and that does impose harsher penalties for migrants who tried to cross into the U.S. illegally.
 
But the process for migrants to claim asylum, to seek asylum can be quite lengthy and complicated. Do you think that the system we have now is sustainable?
 
RAUL REYES, CNN OPINION WRITER: Well, basically the immigration system that we have overall, it's really barely a system at all. Our asylum process as we know it, it was truly designed for a very different era. And now what the Biden administration is trying to do, they're trying to balance a mixture, they're creating some new legal pathways to entry, increasing the number of refugees admitted, but at the same time, they are causing this -- basically a transit ban for asylum seekers.
 
And that's going to be very problematic on the ground because this asylum ban will affect potentially hundreds of thousands of people who do have a lawful right to seek humanitarian relief at the border. And balancing that with our own inadequate so far as we've seen response at the border. And I mean, to put this in perspective, we are seeing early on, as you mentioned, right? Perhaps fewer numbers of migrants at the border.
 
But for the Biden administration at this point, honestly, that whether it's fair or not, the fact that there may be fewer numbers right now, that's less important than these images. These are very powerful images we've been seeing all week. And that's a tremendous political problem for the Biden administration. President Biden's approach to immigration, according to Gallup, presently is only approved by 33 percent of the American public. And that's actually lower than President Trump was known for his extreme policies, that number is actually lower than Trump. So, big problem for the Biden administration going forward.
 
MARQUARDT: And Raul, potentially further complicating things for the Biden administration is this federal judge in Florida who has temporarily blocked the administration from releasing migrants from border patrol custody without court notices. And now that was, as you know, one of the key tools that the White House used or had hoped to use to manage the number of migrants. How do you think that that could impact border enforcement?
 
REYES: Well, the way it's likely to impact border enforcement, it is going to -- if it's this, this court order will lead to severe overcrowding in detention facilities along the border. And even in years past, these facilities were known for inhumane conditions, there were reports or very credible reports of abuses, lack of basic needs being met. So, we're going to see more families potentially placed in detention.
 
That will be a strain not only on Customs and Border Patrol and Immigration agents, but it will cause -- in my view, a lot of unnecessary suffering for the migrants who are in custody. The alternative which the Biden administration refers is to release people on humanitarian parole, so they could go, they could travel state just like New York. Places around the country where they have support networks, where they do have some opportunities to work.
 
So, on the ground, the effects of this -- of this court order will be very severe. And overall, the Biden administration will be facing other legal challenges because we have progressive groups like the ACLU who have vowed to sue over the asylum ban. So, the Biden administration is in a tough spot, not entirely of its own making, because immigration has basically been neglected by multiple administrations.
 
And in the beginning, the lifting of Title 42 may have been sort of a mixed blessing for the Biden administration because it allowed them to hold back at least migrants for the short term, but as we're seeing now, it's just -- with the court order lifted, it's really more like in practical terms, a curse because a perfect storm of increased migration, legal challenges on both sides and widespread dissatisfaction with the Biden administration's approach to the issue.
 <br>[13:10:11]
 
MARQUARDT: And in terms of the resources that the Biden administration has sent down to the border, there are thousands of federal agents and man troops who have been deployed, surge to the border to help with us the asylum application process, but given the sheer magnitude of migrants who could be coming in, you probably are to say, one border official projecting up to 14,000 per day.
 
Do you think that though, that reinforcement of troops and other agents is enough to keep up with the demand? REYES: No, no. In fact, I'm confident saying that because I know that Department of Homeland Security has repeatedly asked Congress for additional funding for more searching of resources to the border and Congress has not allowed it. And to put in perspective, the backlogs that we are talking about people, as we -- as we look ahead, right now, the average asylum case, it takes 4-1/2 years to resolve.
 
And that's just start, you know, for many of these migrants, their cases that they have not even begun. So, we're looking at tremendous backlogs, not only along the border itself in government facilities, but in our court system, in our asylum system. And as much as the administration has been sending troops and resources to the border, their policies are still very problematic because they don't address the root causes that the -- say the push factors that drive people to migrate from Latin America and Central America to the U.S.
 
MARQUARDT: Right.
 
REYES: And also, all factors here which is the United States demand for cheap labor. That's the overall problem. And multiple administrations have failed to address it. And now it's the president who owns this problem.
 
MARQUARDT: Yes. There are calls for much more to be done in those countries of Oregon -- origin that those migrants are coming from. Raul Reyes, we really appreciate your time and expertise today.
 
REYES: Thank you.
 
MARQUARDT: And still ahead, violence between Israelis and Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. This caught by a CNN camera just moments ago.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: MALE: OK. All right. There are missiles going off over our head. One, I see several. OK. And I can see that going over there. You can hear another one.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MARQUARDT: That was missiles coming from Gaza while the Israeli military also launched another round of airstrikes on the narrow strip today against sites that they say belong to the militant group Islamic Jihad.
 
Plus, more explosions hit the suburbs of the Russian-occupied city of Luhansk. That's in eastern Ukraine. Russian official saying that six children were injured in Friday's bombings. We will go live near the Eastern Front in Ukraine next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[13:17:00]
 
MARQUARDT: Violence between Israelis and Palestinians in the Gaza Strip continues to escalate. This is the moment that an Israeli rocket slammed into a building in Gaza earlier today. Take a look.
 
That is just one of the many rockets that the Israeli military has launched during their latest round of strikes on Gaza. Israel saying that the sites belong to the militant group Islamic Jihad, which is based in the Gaza Strip. These deadly strikes on Palestinian targets have been ongoing since Tuesday.
 
Meanwhile, Palestinian militants have also been launching rockets towards Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. Palestinian officials say at least 33 people have been killed so far. That includes militants and civilians. CNN's Ben Wedeman is in southern Israel near Gaza where he has witnessed volleys of rockets flying overhead.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
WEDEMAN: And also, what we've seen today is strikes coming into Gaza by the Israelis. Multiple strikes in the northern end. And now there's more. You can see more rockets being fired out of Gaza. That's the northern end to the left of an area -- to the right of an area that's known as Sheikh Zayed. Now what you can hear -- you can see missiles now being fired from Israel. That's the Iron Dome system at work intercepting those missiles being fired out of Gaza.
 
And we can hear drone overhead as well. And oftentimes what happens shortly after these missiles are launched, there are airstrikes that come in to hit the spots where those missiles were fired from. Now, it seems to have stopped for just the moment. But this gives you an idea of what can happen here without any warning.
 
I'm Ben Wedeman, CNN stood out outside Gaza.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MARQUARDT: Extraordinary scenes there in southern Israel. Thanks to Ben Wedeman.
 
Now, the Biden administration is looking to trade high-value Russian prisoners in exchange for two Americans who are according to the State Department wrongfully detained by the Putin regime. Evan Gershkovich and Paul Whelan. You can see them right there. There is however, just one problem. The U.S. doesn't have any Russian detainees to offer up.
 
So, CNN has learned that the administration is now scouring the globe for any countries that have high-profile Russians in custody to see if a third-party prisoner swap could be worked out. CNN's Kylie Atwood has more on this CNN exclusive.
 
KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: As U.S. officials are trying to gin up an offer to Russia that could to potentially secure the release of Evan Gershkovich and Paul Whelan. Two Americans wrongfully detained in Russia.
 <br>[13:20:05]
 
We know that U.S. officials' outreach extends to countries including Germany, Norway, Brazil and a former Soviet bloc country as they go to those countries that have recently arrested Russian spies. And the key here is countries that have Russian spies because the United States does not currently have a high-level Russian spy in its custody. And when you talk to U.S. officials in their engagements with Russia over efforts to try and secure the release of Paul Whelan, Russia made it very clear that they expect to get someone in return who is part of Russia's intelligence gathering apparatus.
 
They want a Russian spy in return for the release of Paul Whelan because they are considering him as a spy. The same is true for Evan Gershkovich. U.S. officials expect that they're going to have to offer up someone on the table who Russians view in a similar bucket. And when it comes to these efforts, they're also extending to countries that are U.S. allies that don't necessarily have Russian spies, but could potentially offer something up to the U.S. to be used as leverage at the negotiating table again to gin up interest on Russia's side to engage in some sort of deal to try and get out these two Americans who remain wrongfully detained in Russia. 
 
Kylie Atwood, CNN, the State Department.
 
MARQUARDT: Thanks to Kylie Atwood for that very important report.
 
And coming up. The brutal journey to reach the southern border, and how some migrants make the trip on top of a freight train to get to the U.S. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[13:25:46]
 
MARQUARDT: Many migrants fleeing Central and South America end up on a freight train that some called the train of death. The journey to the U.S. border is fraught with danger, despair, but also lots of faith.
 
CNN's David Culver filed this report near the U.S.-Mexico border.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DAVID CULVER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): We're just outside Ciudad Juarez and this is the last train stop for this freight train. that's eventually going to head into the city. And you can see already, dozens of migrants in several of these cars on top of them all about. They're asking us if we have water, we have food.
 
CULVER (voice-over): We climb on. The train slowly starts up again heading north. We meet migrants from all over.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Honduras.
 
CULVER (on camera): Honduras. He says he's from Honduras originally and wants to go to the US.
 
CULVER (voice over): Felipe and Marcela (ph) from Colombia, also hoping to enter the U.S.
 
CULVER (on camera): I asked her why the U.S., she said to have a better future.
 
CULVER (voice over): Omar from Venezuela.
 
OMAR, FROM VENEZUELA: In Baltimore.
 
CULVER (on camera): He is trying to get to Baltimore, Maryland.
 
CULVER (voice over): We rode for an hour. They had been here on here for days, 12 days for Roberto and his family.
 
CULVER (on camera): He's with his dad and his sister.
 
He says they've been attacked, they've been robbed. He describes a really treacherous track.
 
CULVER (voice over): Part of the train journey north for some is on what's called La Bestia, the beast. It's also known as the train of death and often controlled by cartels.
 
Roberto wears a face mask to not infect the others. He tells me he got sick early on in his travels.
 
CULVER (on camera): He says, a lot of them have been sick and over the journey, he has had to leave his two kids, young ones.
 
CULVER (voice over): He tells me his two toddlers nearly died. So, he sent them back with family in Honduras as he continues on.
 
They stand, sit, and sleep on metal construction beams covered in plastic, dirty clothes and cardboard used to make it as comfortable as possible. The heat and sun brutal. At night, it is the cold and wind. The smells a range, sewage at times and burning trash as we drove past what appears to be an incinerator.
 
Their soles worn down.
 
CULVER (on camera): He says it's very dangerous for women, too, and they said food is just really scarce right now.
 
CULVER (voice over): Omar spent four days on board already. Food, he has run out. He showed us the little water he has left and the documents he clings to, keeping secured and plastic.
 
CULVER (on camera): He is really through all of the different situation that would allow you to enter the U.S. and he's got it printed out in Spanish, and he has got the address of his friend in Baltimore that he hopes to get to.
 
Four days on the train for him, he said the first day, he just got really sick because the sun was just so strong. And now he is making sure to keep cover as much as possible. He wants to go to New York.
 
CULVER (voice over): For Omar, it is a familiar journey. He left Venezuela six months ago, already expelled once from the U.S. for trying to cross. He'll try again.
 
Legally or illegally, he will cross, he tells me. I asked him if he's hopeful.
 
I've got a lot of faith, he tells me.
 
CULVER (on camera): Ultimately, he hopes to get money sent back to his two kids in Venezuela.
 <br>[13:30:00]
 
As we pull into Ciudad Juarez, about 25 miles from the border wall with El Paso, we and the others climb out. 
 
(on camera): And that's it. You can see, first, everyone now getting off. It's basically the last stop. 
 
(voice-over): Omar, among the last off, carrying his only belongings and, somehow, a smile. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
 
CULVER: Planning to cross immediately. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
 
CULVER (on camera): And most of those migrants we met had the same destination, this place right behind me, the border wall. That's technically U.S. territory from Mexico looking on towards Texas. 
 
You can see it's been barricaded off by Texas National Guard and Texas state troopers. 
 
We've also noticed that the migrants have been split into various groups, including single men, families and unaccompanied minors to begin processing their claims for asylum. 
 
David Culver, CNN, Juarez, Mexico. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
MARQUARDT: Thanks to David for that amazing report.
 
Now new developments in Russia's war on Ukraine. Earlier today, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with Pope Francis for 40 minutes discussing the Vatican's efforts of finding a peace plan. 
 
Zelenskyy also meeting with Italy's prime minister who pledged Italy's unwavering support to Ukraine. 
 
Now this is all happening as new explosions hit the Russian-occupied city of Luhansk in eastern Ukraine. It comes one day after the city was struck by two missiles. Russian officials saying six children were also injured in Friday's bombings. 
 
CNN's Sam Kiley is in southeastern Ukraine. 
 
Sam, these strikes coming as Ukraine appears to be carrying out what are being called shaping operations ahead of a planned counteroffensive.
 
SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, absolutely, Alex. These operations may go on for some time. We know President Zelenskyy said the other day that the conditions weren't quite ready for the full-scale offensive to be launched. 
 
That said, there have been local tactical gains by the Ukrainian armed forces in that long-running and very, very brutal battle for Bakhmut with the capture of a couple of kilometers both to the north and the south on the flanks there.
 
With the Wagner mercenary group taking heavy casualties we understand from Ukraine officials. And Nic Robertson has been reporting on that.
 
But I think, much more widely, the delivery of Storm Shadow missiles -- these are cruise missiles from the United Kingdom -- offer almost a strategic upgrade in the capabilities of the Ukrainians. 
 
They're the first longer-range missiles capable of reaching any target they choose within Ukrainian territory occupied by the Russians. That's very important in terms of breaking down the logistical chains. 
 
That may well be what they're trying to do in places like Luhansk and as we've seen elsewhere in the Crimean Peninsula, too. 
 
There's no evidence that cruise missiles were used in the air strikes against Luhansk, although that's something the Russians will claim, particularly if there were any kind of civilian casualties. 
 
But the Ukrainians make their own missiles and cruise missiles and other missiles capable of hitting there. 
 
What will be the real sign that an offensive is even more imminent is if we see a significant increase in these campaigns against the logistics chain of the Russians. That's going to be crucial as part of any kind of shaping operations -- Alex? 
 
MARQUARDT: Sam, on the other side, in terms of missile strikes, there was an attempted strike, we believe, on Kyiv by a Russian hypersonic missile intercepted by the famous Patriot Missile Anti-Air System. 
 
What more do we know about the Russians perhaps targeting that Patriot battery? 
 
KILEY: I think it's absolutely clear -- and the Pentagon has confirmed this -- that the Patriot battery itself was targeted by this hypersonic missile, which is the absolute jewel in the crown of the air attack capabilities of the Russians. 
 
They say they're the only nation on earth that have got this missile that can fly at 10 times the speed of sound. Clearly, they had intelligence they could hit it. We didn't know a Patriot, though, could fight back so effectively -- Alex? 
 
MARQUARDT: Sam Kiley, in southeastern Ukraine, thank you very much.
 <br>[13:34:32]
 
And up next, the U.S. Marine veteran who held a homeless street artist in a fatal chokehold on a New York subway is now out on bond and facing a second-degree manslaughter charge. We'll have the details ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
MARQUARDT: A New York man who held a homeless street performer in a deadly chokehold on the subway is out on bail. And 24-year-old Daniel Penny surrendered to police on Friday morning. He is now charged with second-degree manslaughter in the death of Jordan Neely. That was last week. 
 
CNN's law enforcement reporter, Mark Morales, joins me now.
 
Mark, Penny is a decorated Marine. He has a humanitarian medal. Meanwhile, Neely's family is saying this was intentional, so he should be charged with murder. 
 
MARK MORALES, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT REPORTER: Right. The attorney representing the Neely family argues that Neely wasn't hurting anyone, had gotten on the subway, wasn't attacking anyone. And it resulted in him being choked to death. 
 
They're overjoyed by the step in the process. They feel comforted by this. But they also say they would have rather seen a murder charge from here. Still, it was a step for them in the right direction. 
 
What we saw -- this is a pretty significant step in this case, because this case really touched a nerve in this city. 
 
When you look at protesters that have been going to the subway stop where Neely was killed.
 <br>[13:40:01]
 
And you see how the attorneys for Penny had set up a legal defense fund that's now over a million dollars, you could really see how this has touched a nerve in this city. 
 
When we go back to the arraignment and you look how prosecutors laid out their case, they start saying how Neely had gotten on the subway, was making threats and had scared some riders, and that's when Penny came up behind him and put him in that chokehold. 
 
MARQUARDT: And, Mark, excuse me, sorry. What can we expect next for Penny? When will he be back there in court? 
 
MORALES: Penny is due back in court on July 17th. This is going to be a long process at this point, so there's going to be a lot of work for his attorneys, a lot of work for the prosecutors. 
 
Right now, he's looking at about 15 years in state prison if he's convicted. But again, this is a long legal process. That's going to be further down the road. He has not entered a plea. He doesn't have to. That might happen if he does get indicted. That's where he would enter a plea. 
 
MARQUARDT: As you say, it certainly has touched a nerve in New York. 
 
Mark Morales, thank you so much for all of that reporting.
 
Now she's known as the "doomsday mom." Lori Vallow found guilty of killing her two children and conspiring in the murder of her husband's first wife. We'll be talking about what's next for her when we come back. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[13:46:56]
 
MARQUARDT: An Idaho woman has been found guilty of killing her two children and conspiring to kill her husband's ex-wife. Lori Vallow Daybell was charged with murder after her 17-year-old daughter and 7- year-old son went missing back in 2019 and then were found dead months later in June of 2020. 
 
Her husband, Chad Daybell, is also facing charges and is still awaiting trial. 
 
The 3-year-long investigation included bizarre claims of zombie children and apocalyptic religious beliefs.
 
CNN's Camila Bernal joins me now live from Los Angeles.
 
Camila, tell us more about this case. 
 
CAMILA BERNAL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Alex. It's definitely a chilling case. You mentioned that religious aspect of all of this. Prosecutors said those extremist views essentially justified and motivated the killings here. And then the jury agreed. 
 
Now the family released a statement saying they're thankful and pleased with the verdict and what they see as justice, but they also know this is not the end of the story. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Answer, guilty. Answer, guilty. 
 
BERNAL (voice-over): Lori Vallow Daybell stood almost motionless as one guilty verdict after another was announced. She was found guilty on all murder, conspiracy, and grand theft charges. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: -- the court find in a unanimous verdict. 
 
BERNAL: The jury's decision closes the book on the monthlong trial for the Idaho mother who prosecutors say was motivated by money, power, and sex to kill her two children and conspire to kill her husband's wife at the time. 
 
And while she decided not to testify, her lawyers argued she was innocent. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Listen, just tell people what is happening. There's people around the country praying for your children. 
 
BERNAL: The harrowing case, which involves a tangled web of family deaths and doomsday religious beliefs, began in September of 2019 when two of Vallow Daybell's children from a previous marriage, 16-year-old Tylee Ryan and 7-year-old Joshua, or J.J., were last seen. 
 
Shortly afterwards, she married Chad Daybell, whose wife died in her sleep just weeks before Chad and Lori's wedding in Hawaii. 
 
When authorities conducted a welfare check on J.J. in November of 2019, police say Vallow Daybell told them her son was with a friend in Arizona. They returned the next day with a search warrant, only to find the couple had vanished. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Just tell us where your kids are. 
 
BERNAL: The couple was located in Hawaii in January of 2020. But J.J. and Tylee's whereabouts remained a mystery. 
 
After a months-long search, law enforcement located the remains of the children at Chad Daybell's property in southeast Idaho. 
 
ASSISTANT CHIEF GARY HAGEN, REXBURG POLICE DEPARTMENT: Chad Daybell, who resides at that residence, has also been taken into custody. 
 
BERNAL: Daybell and Vallow Daybell were ultimately indicted for murder in May of 2021. Chad Daybell's trial is being held separately. He's pleaded not guilty. 
 
(on camera): The couple's apocalyptic religious worldview was a focus throughout the trial. Prosecutors say they believed they were religious figures who used the system of rating people as light or dark. 
 
CHARLES VALLOW, FORMER HUSBAND OF LORI VALLOW DAYBELL: I can't get in touch with my kids. 
 
BERNAL (voice-over): But before the children went missing, Vallow Daybell's estranged husband, Charles, told police about her beliefs. 
 
VALLOW: She thinks she's a resurrected being and a god. 
 
BERNAL: He filed for divorce, but prosecutors say the Vallow Daybell's brother, Alex Cox, shot and killed Charles in July of 2019. 
 
She's facing a conspiracy to commit murder charge in Arizona in connection with that killing. Cox died in December of 2019. 
 
Hearing the verdict was emotional for many who followed this tragic case, but perhaps none more so than family.

BERNAL: And that grandfather saying that he's going to be there for the sentencing to ask Lori why and for what. 
 
She could face life in prison. We're expecting that sentencing in about three months. 
 
Keep in mind, she does have to go back to Arizona to face the charges there. So, again, this is not the end of the story -- Alex? 
 
MARQUARDT: No, it certainly isn't. 
 
Camila Bernal, thank you very much for that report. 
 
Police have arrested two suspects, a man and a woman, accused of helping two inmates escape from a Philadelphia prison. Officials say both will face multiple charges of conspiracy and criminal escape. 
 
U.S. Marshals have arrested one of the two escapees, while a manhunt is still under way for the second inmate. 
 
CNN's Danny Freeman takes a closer look at the case.

DANNY FREEMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: There have been a lot of developments on this story that we first brought to you at the beginning of the week. Two prisoners escaped at the beginning of the week. Now there have been two arrests but still one inmate is on the loose according to police. 
 
But first, let me tell you about the inmate who was re-arrested. And 24-year-old Nasir Grant, he was arrested on Thursday evening at 10:30 p.m. 
 
And a U.S. Marshals spokesperson said they were surveilling an area where they believed Grant may have been hiding out in Philadelphia. 
 
And then they saw a man walk out of a home in what they call full female Muslim garb with a head covering. The U.S. Marshalls followed that man to an empty parking lot and that's where they confronted him and ultimately arrested him. 
 
They say that Grant was visibly surprised when they approached him, but he did surrender without incident to the U.S. Marshals. 
 
Meanwhile, there was also a second arrest earlier this week in this case, a 21-year-old woman, Xianni Stallings, she's accused of actually helping these two men break out of prison back on Sunday.
 
But at this point, we still don't have a lot of details as to how she potentially helped these men escape. This one, she's facing four felonies, including the felony of escape. But her defense attorney was not giving any comment earlier this week
 
 to CNN when we asked. 
 
Meanwhile, the last suspect, Ameen Hurst, that's the 18-year-old, he's one of the gentlemen who is accused of escaping that prison, also, on Sunday. He's still on the loose.
 
And he was in prison initially suspected of four homicides. The U.S. Marshal said he is still considered to be armed and dangerous. 
 
But I should say, the Marshal said that, earlier this week, they were splitting up their time, devoting energy to finding two escaped inmates. Now they said, while it's been a long week, they can focus all of their energy on bringing back this one potentially escaped inmate.
 
Back to you.

Up next, a major shift when it comes to women's health. Why a health task force now says that women should start screening for breast cancer at 40 instead of 50. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[13:57:10]
 
MARQUARDT: There is significant news when it comes to fighting breast cancer. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force is now proposing that women at average risk should start their screenings as early as 40 years old instead of 50 years old. 
 
The proposal also recommends that women receive screenings every other year until the age of 74. The rate of breast cancer diagnoses has risen each year among young women according to that task force. 
 
CNN health reporter, Jacqueline Howard, has more. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JACQUELINE HOWARD, CNN HEALTH REPORTER: For women at average risk, the task force sees more benefits than risks for them to start mammograms at age 40. 
 
This is a draft update. It's available for public comment from now through June 5th. 
 
But based on current incidents rates, it's estimated that 12.9 percent of women born in the United States today will develop breast cancer at some time during their lives. 
 
And it's important to catch these cancers early. That gives a better chance of survival. Now meanwhile, this update does not change recommendations for women
 
 at high risk of getting breast cancer. Those women should still keep in contact with their doctors for what's best for them.
 
But for all of us, for all women, it's important to discuss with our doctors our family history of cancer, whether you have dense breasts. 
 
Ask for a breast exam at your next appointment and talk to your doctors about when to start screening for you based on your own risk factors and how often. 
 
Back to you.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: In the 2010s, if you bought a Mac and had broadband, you could start making music that sounded good. And then you put the song on Sound Cloud or on YouTube and then it gets all this traction.
