KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR:  Breaking news this morning, Hurricane Milton is now a Category 5 storm closing in on Florida's gulf coast hours away from landfall, possibly one of the most destructive hurricanes to ever hit that west central coast. One official warning residents in the evacuation zones this is not survivable.
 
JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR:  Yes. We have the latest up to the minute storm track as some gas stations are running out of fuel.
 
BOLDUAN:  An exclusive CNN reporting the CIA struggling behind the scenes facing allegations of sexual assault and harassment at the agency.
 
I'm Kate Bolduan with John Berman. Sara Sidner is out today. This is CNN News Central.
 
BERMAN:  All right. And we do have major breaking news. Hurricane Milton is closing in on Florida as a catastrophic Category 5 storm. It is poised to be one of the most destructive natural disasters in Florida's history. Officials just forecast the storm will hit as a Category 4 along the west coast, Tampa, St. Petersburg, Sarasota, you can see down to Fort Myers, all in the path, big population centers, all extraordinarily vulnerable to a predicted huge storm surge.
 
The outer bands are now being felt. Bridges to some barrier islands have already been shut down. Officials say if you can get out, get out, but that window is closing.
 
CNN is stationed along the coast. First, let's get the new forecaster from Meteorologist Derek Van Dam. Derek, tell us what you're seeing.
 
DEREK VAN DAM, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  Yes, John. We are less than 24 hours away from one of the most powerful top ten Atlantic Basin hurricanes to ever form that will impact western and southwestern portions of Florida. This did not weaken overnight and those are sobering words because we're only a matter of hours until we experience tropical storm force winds in this region and it's only a matter of hours before we start to see the water levels start to come up. The latest track from the National Hurricane Center does show a Category 4 major hurricane making landfall late tonight into early Thursday morning. The exact location of that most powerful right front quadrant of the hurricane is so important. We know this is a game of miles, right? One computer model still showing a worst case scenario for Tampa Bay but there are other computer models that bring it to the south. We should expect these types of wobbles with this type of an intensity of this magnitude. These storms tend to wobble back and forth and that again determines who will see the worst impacts.
 
One thing's for sure, the catastrophic winds will not be confined just to the coastline, they will stretch far inland. And notice this updated map, this has extreme catastrophic winds, that's major hurricane force from Hillsborough County into Lee County, including Charlotte, as well as Sarasota.
 
Now, in terms of this unsurvivable storm surge, again, it is that right front quadrant that is so critical, 10 to 15 feet. You can see that includes Sarasota, the Port Charlotte region. We are watching the satellite depicting every moment in its track is so critical on whether or not this has a southerly component or a northerly component and who gets the worst impacts.
 
Flooding, rain will be a concern from this. John, we're talking about over two to three months of rain falling from the sky through the duration of this storm. It's already been raining. We've already seen tornadoes spinning up in Miami-Dade County earlier this morning. And that will increase through the course of the day today.
 
I'm going to leave you with this, John. We have a rare risk of excessive rainfall leading to flash flooding where you see that shading of pink. Remember, if we've learned anything from Hurricane Helene, it is these rare high risks that caused the most destruction and also the most deaths.
 
BERMAN:  There is so much to be concerned about so much. We have to pay attention to. Derek Van Dam, We're to keep coming back to you throughout the morning to get the very latest forecast because every little movement, every little wobble impacts millions.
 
Let's get to Randi Kaye, who's in Sarasota, Florida, right now, right in the center of this path. Randi, what are you seeing this morning?
 
RANDI KAYE, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, good morning, John. It has been raining steadily here this morning. We know that conditions are expected to get much worse here because we are, as you heard, potentially in the bull's eye for this storm.
 <br>[07:05:04]
 
We are on South Shore Drive here in Sarasota. You can see there, there's a dock behind me and some water and that boat. We don't know how long that boat will remain there. We're also seeing some lightning here in the area as well.
 
But we are expecting a potentially record-breaking storm surge of 10 to 15 feet here. They thought Helene was record breaking at seven feet here. So, certainly, they are very concerned. They're also concerned about the winds that are expected to pick up this afternoon, about 40 miles per hour and up starting with the tropical storm force winds this afternoon. We're hearing some thunder in the area as well.
 
People, John, have been evacuating here. They know what Helene did. They see the debris around the neighborhoods. People have emptied out their homes. One woman told me she spent 15 hours cleaning debris out of her home after it was basically destroyed by Helene.
 
So, there's debris all over the neighborhoods that can potentially turn into projectiles. There's also people boarding up their businesses, their homes, the restaurants are closed here. We spoke to one woman who told me that her husband rode out the storm on Siesta Key, one of those barrier islands that is now shut down. He was chest deep in water. He rode out Helene there and they are still staying to ride out Hurricane Milton. Here's what she told me.

K.T. CURRAN, RIDING OUT HURRICANE MILTON IN SARASOTA, FLORIDA:  Now, as this hurricane is barreling down directly on our community, it feels like maybe Helene was just a rehearsal for what's to come.
 
They're talking possible 15-foot storm surge. None of us in a hundred years have seen anything like this. It is shocking.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KAYE:  And, John, they are riding out Hurricane Milton on the ninth floor of a condo building in downtown Sarasota that is built to withstand a Cat 5 hurricane, so they hope to be safe. John?
 
BERMAN:  Randi, the thunder, the lightning all around you, just the beginning of what will be a chaotic day. Please stay safe.
 
Let's get right to Isabel Rosales, who is in Tampa now. Tampa, I know bracing for the worst case scenario. We can see the rain falling on you.
 
ISABEL ROSALES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  John, good morning, right? We're starting to feel those outer bands. The rain is starting to pick up in moments. There's a little bit of a gust, but we know these conditions are only going to get worse.
 
Right now, we're in front of Tampa General Hospital. We're keeping an eye on the Hillsborough Bay. We know that from Helene, the storm surge got so bad here that the waters actually touched and got several feet high up to the walls of Tampa General Hospital, the region's only level one trauma center. With Milton, we're looking at worst case scenario, double that storm surge, so ten feet on up. So, this is a precarious situation we're keeping our eyes on.
 
And, of course, you have Florida officials telling folks that if you haven't already, please evacuate or seek shelter. We heard from Sheriff Chad Chronister of Hillsborough County saying that this is the 11th hour. Please get out. This is your shortening window of time to leave the area.
 
Another matter of concern here is once these winds reach about 40 miles per hour, this is a community of bridges, you're going to start seeing the Sunshine Skyway, the Howard Franklin, the Corny Campbell Causeway, these bridges beginning to shut down. Also, first responders not as willing to go out for their personal safety.
 
Over in Treasure Island, in Pinellas County, one of the one of the barrier islands, residents heard this. Listen,
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  A local emergency currently exists, quickly secure your home or business and safely evacuate the area.
 
Listen to local media and authorities for additional information.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ROSALES:  And one of the major concerns has been debris. All of this debris piling up here from Helene still out in the streets. Those could become flying projectiles, very serious and very dangerous. John?
 
BERMAN:  Very dangerous, indeed. Isabel Rosales in Tampa, again, please stay safe. This is just the beginning of what will be perhaps a catastrophic 24 hours.
 
Kate, just watching them as the rain begins to come down, the thunder and lightning bracing for what is to come.
 
BOLDUAN:  It's absolutely that. And also this video of just all the debris that's still left behind from Helene and what's going to happen when the water comes in and the wind, bracing is right.
 
So, life-threatening storm surge, it's a main concern, a big concern of Florida officials. The record storm surge could be headed their way. We're going to talk to a local sheriff who is warning, do not gamble with your lives with this one.
 
And we'll also talk to two people who are riding out this storm, why they plan to stay put as Hurricane Milton approaches.
 
And also this, who is the candidate you would most like to have a beer with? A question that everyone kind of ponders every election, well, Vice President Kamala Harris cracked open a cold one with Stephen Colbert last night.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[07:10:00]
 
BOLDUAN:  We're just hours now from landfall with Hurricane Milton. The storm could wreak havoc on a region still battered and just starting to recover from Hurricane Helene just two weeks ago. Areas like Davis Island, south of Tampa in Hillsborough County, still cleaning up, look at this video, still cleaning up piles of wreckage from Helene, and now basically a ghost town as many people -- so many people have cleared out.
 
The Hillsborough County sheriff, Chad Chronister, has warned anyone thinking about staying and writing it out, do not gamble with your lives. And Sheriff Chronister joins us now. Sheriff, thank you very much. It's just basically brace for impact is kind of how to describe these coming hours.
 
You've heard what the mayor said. Your warnings have been very specific as well. The mayor saying if you choose to ride this out in these evacuation areas of the county, you're going to die.
 <br>[07:15:02]
 
I mean, do you agree the threat is that serious here?
 
SHERIFF CHAD CHRONISTER, HILLSBOROUGH COUNTY, FLORIDA:  I think there's too many variables. The storm continues to wobble when there's going to be a lot of rain, a lot of flash flooding, a lot of wind, a lot of downed trees, already saturated areas. And then we always have to talk about the deadliest of them all, the storm surge, and we don't know what that's going to be like. Why gamble? Why would you gamble with your life or the lives of your loved ones? Get out, even if it's outside the evacuation area, to a hotel, to a friend's house. We know it's an inconvenience. We know you're going to be uncomfortable, but you'll be alive.
 
BOLDUAN:  That's quite something sheriff. That is so true. How are evacuations going? I mean, do you have a sense of how many people you think are staying behind versus people by people listening to the evacuation orders?
 
CHRONISTER:  Listen, I'm very happy. I think it's gone phenomenally well. Two days ago, we issued evacuation orders and we saw the traffic on the major highways with individuals leaving. We even work with the highway patrol and open up the emergency lane to help give those individuals who wanted to leave the ability to do so. I saw the long lines of gas stations. I saw the long lines at grocery store and supply areas where people were getting those essential needs.
 
Listen, I think a lot of people did heed the warning with a little help of Hurricane Helene. They saw how horrible it can be, and this is going to be a lot worse.
 
BOLDUAN:  Do you think Hurricane Helene was a wakeup call for everybody? I mean, you guys know storms. Florida knows storms. But just the serious turn, the deadly turn that these storms are now taking?
 
CHRONISTER:  It absolutely was. You know, a lot of years, we talk about hurricanes coming two years ago. Catastrophic worst hurricane in the history of Florida was coming right for Tampa Bay and it changed and it went to the Fort Myers-Naples area. These storms are unpredictable. That's why they call them the cones of uncertainty because of the uncertainty. I think everyone saw during Helene when this time they called for seven feet storm surge and we got every inch of that storm surge. Now, they're being prepared. We knew then that a lot of people didn't heed the warnings. They almost became a little too complacent. The good part was is the winds never became to sustained over 40 miles an hour and we never had to suspend service. We conducted over a thousand rescues with our amphibious vehicles, our marine unit with air boats.
 
You know, this storm is going to be different. When it becomes too dangerous, we're going to have to suspend service. It's just too risky for our personnel who will be prepared and ready for that after-storm response.
 
So, imagine that sickening feeling that I can't even think about when you figure it out, like, hey, I shouldn't be here, hey, I need help, and helps not coming.
 
BOLDUAN:  Because at some point, people need to understand it's too dangerous for your teams to go out. They have to hunker down just like everyone else. There's a period of time when you are on your own in these deadly storms.
 
I saw officials in Orange County have actually told residents that they want them to be finished with preps and hunkering down by noon today. What's your advice? Is that what you want to see with folks?
 
CHRONISTER:  Yes, I think that's great advice. I know the county. A lot of people are putting it out that, hey, listen, be where you're going to be by 7:00 A.M. today. A benefit that came with the storm slowing down a little bit, yes, it's more powerful and there's a lot of disadvantages. Was it allowed us the opportunity to have more time to plan? But I think any time after lunchtime today, we're really going to see these conditions deteriorate.
 
So, my recommendation be if you're going to go somewhere, if you're not hunkered down and sheltered in for this storm, you better do so now.
 
BOLDUAN:  Do it now. And by lunch, that's basically -- that should -- everyone should think of that as their deadline to hunker down and be in place. Sheriff, thank you very much. Good luck over the next hours.
 
We're going to keep in touch with the sheriff there in Hillsborough County. We're also going to hear from two people who decided to write out the storm on a barrier island near St. Petersburg, why they're doing that and what they're preparing for.
 
And on the other side of the country, a sin city send-off for the famous Tropicana Hotel and casino.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[07:20:00]
 
BERMAN:  All right. Happening now, mandatory evacuations in place in Fort Myers Beach and Sanibel Island, those communities bracing for Hurricane Milton, more than 3 million people facing the highest level of storm threat with tornadoes also possible.
 
Let's get right to CNN's Carlos Suarez in Fort Myers. Carlos, what do you see in this morning?
 
CARLOS SUAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, John, good morning. So, we are in Downtown Fort Myers live along the Caloosahatchee River, where just two years ago Hurricane Ian made a mess of things out here. The concern at this hour for the folks that live across Southwest Florida is the storm surge that we're going to see because of Hurricane Milton.
 
Right now, we're looking at anywhere between 8 to 12 feet of storm surge, depending on exactly where this hurricane ends up tracking. Everything here behind me along the Caloosahatchee is going to flood if these forecasted storm surge holds.
 
A large part of the reason that this takes place is because the Caloosahatchee River runs from Lake Okeechobee in Central Florida out into the Gulf of Mexico. And so that kind of topography really allows itself, it lends itself for the fact that when all of this water begins to rush in from the Gulf of Mexico, when you add in all of the rainfall that's expected to hit this part of Southwest Florida and then you throw in high tide, that water has nowhere to go.
 <br>[07:25:10]
 
And so the river itself serves as a funnel, and then at some point, without anywhere else to go, the water is just going to move inland.
 
Yesterday, we were live about two blocks from where we are here in the general direction of downtown Fort Myers, because that's really the entertainment district, that's where a lot of business is, and some apartment and some hotels are. And they were the ones that were trying to get ready for this storm surge. They had sandbags out. They had plywood up along the windows there. Just about everyone that we spoke to yesterday told us that they expect their homes and their businesses to flood.
 
Now, over in Cape Coral to the north of me, Charlotte Harbor is the same kind of layout, the same kind of topography. They've also got a river that runs from Central Florida out into the Gulf of Mexico. And so those folks are going to see the same thing that we're seeing. And, of course, the further north you get, you're going to get into Tampa and the Tampa Bay area. And so as we get ready for this hurricane to continue on the path that it is on, that is kind of the overall sense out here.
 
Yesterday, I did drive around parts of Southwest Florida that were hit pretty hard by Hurricane Ian, including Fort Myers Beach. And, John, I had to tell you, it was pretty much a ghost town. Most of the folks there had to leave yesterday because there was a 10:00 curfew now in effect 24 hours.
 
BERMAN:  Carlos Juarez, where you were standing could very well be covered by water about 12, 16 hours from now. Stay safe. Thank you very much. This morning, anti-Semitic and violent threats lobbed at hurricane response officials. We've got new reporting on the dangerous attacks.
 
And as Carlos was just talking about, Milton expected to cause catastrophic flooding with storm surge that is almost impossible to comprehend.
