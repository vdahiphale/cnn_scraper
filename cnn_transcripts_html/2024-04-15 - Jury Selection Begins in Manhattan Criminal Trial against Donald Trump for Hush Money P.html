GENERAL MARK HERTLING, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: They certainly have some capabilities, and they have a lot of them, just like Russia does. So countering this kind of action, unlike what Russia does, they synchronize their operations with a lot of things going in at one time. Iran was very bad in terms of sequencing their different weapon systems. 
 
JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR:  Got it. General Mark Hertling, always great to see you. Thank you so much. 
 
We are standing by to see Donald Trump leave Trump Tower on his way to his criminal trial in New York.
 
A new hour CNN NEWS CENTRAL starts now. 
 
SARA SIDNER, CNN ANCHOR:  Just moment from now, were going to witness something that's never happened before in American history. A former president will head to a New York court to face a felony trial. It all begins with jury selection this morning. We're live outside the courthouse in the Donald Trump hush money case. 
 
Also, we have some breaking news for you. The FBI and Coast Guard have now launched a criminal investigation into the deadly Baltimore bridge collapse. 
 
And in just hours, the woman in charge of weapons on the "Rust" set will be sentenced for her role in the fatal shooting of a cinematographer. New details on the insults she hurled at jurors in recorded jail phone calls. 
 
I'm Sara Sidner with John Berman and Kate Bolduan. This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL.
 
BERMAN:  And the breaking news this morning, never before in U.S. history has a former president faced criminal trial. Never before in U.S. history has former president been charged with falsifying documents to cover up an alleged relationship with an adult film actress. Never before has a presumed presidential nominee had to sit in a courtroom for four days a week listening to these allegations. It is all happening today. We are standing by to see if Donald Trump speaks on his way to the courthouse where he faces 34 criminal charges for his alleged role in a hush money scheme that sought the silence of a porn star before the 2016 election. Trump denies any wrongdoing, including the affair. 
 
Jury selection begins today in that trial. It could last as long as six weeks. Let's go right to the courthouse. CNN's Kristen Holmes is there. And Donald Trump has been venting, you might say ranting, on social media already this morning. 
 
KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  John, you took the words right out of my mouth. If you have any indication of where Donald Trump's mindset is that, you can look at his Truth Social. He did a series of posts over the last couple of hours ranting about this case, particularly the gag order against him. A lot of it not true, saying that they are, "they" being the court, is able to speak about him, but he's not able to speak about them. I think we can all agree we haven't seen anything from the judge in this case posting about Donald Trump on social media.
 
But he is expected to leave Trump Tower within the next half-hour. And when he gets there, that's the beginning of jury selection. So what exactly does that look like? We are talking about 500 people, Manhattan citizens, and that is important because Trump's team had hoped that some of the outer boroughs would be considered. Those are the boroughs where they are most likely to see a Trump supporter. Then they will come, and they've filled out a questionnaire, which I will get to in one second. Once that weeds out people, you're talking about roughly 100 people going into the courtroom at one to be vetted. Ultimately, they are going to land on 12 jurors with six alternates there. 
 
Now, let's talk about what exactly they're going to be asked in the questionnaire, because again, this is what is going to be the first line of defense that's going to weed out people automatically. Some of the questions there are, where do you get your news? Do follow Trump on social media? Have you ever attended a Trump rally? Do you have any affiliation with groups like QAnon, the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers? Have you ever participated in an anti-Trump event. Then they will move on to this vetting by the judge. And just to note, both the prosecution and the defense are allowed to veto without any questions asked 10 people on each side. 
 
So this is just the beginning of what could last up to two months, this trial as a whole. What does that look like? Again, as you said, this is unprecedented. You are going to have Donald Trump, he is required to attend in a courtroom roughly four days a week. They're going to be some holidays here and there. That is every weekday except for Wednesdays. How does this square with his campaign? Well, we're really not sure yet. This is the real juggling act you're about to see. They had said that he was going to campaign on Wednesdays and Saturdays. We know there's nothing on a schedule this Wednesday. But there is a chance he's actually going to hold events around New York during the court days after he gets out of court, possibly on those Wednesdays. And we know that he is expected to travel on every Saturday. 
 
Now, at the end of all this, I do want to just note here because this is what we're all working towards, what are the possible penalties if Donald Trump is convicted. So we're going to pull this up for you. maximum prison sentence if he is convicted on those 34 charges, four years for each count. 
 <br>[08:05:00]
 
But there is a 20-year sentencing cap for this type of felony. Also, he could be sentenced to probation, and the president cannot pardon himself in state crimes. So just overall here, Donald Trump is expected to make the most of this, and what I mean by that is that he's going to stop the cameras at every chance that he gets. He wants this to be a media spectacle. That is the way he is going to get on camera. We also expect that he's probably going to deliver press conferences nearly every day. Unclear on today, we're told that that's going to be a day of, perhaps even just hours before decision, John. 
 
BERMAN:  Yes. And that's why we're watching. We've got our cameras set up outside Trump Tower right now, watching to see if he walks out, watching to see if he says something. Kristen Holmes down at the courthouse, this is an unprecedented day. Great to have you there. Thank you very much. Kate? 
 
KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR:  We're going to keep a close eye on all of the live pictures for you. 
 
Joining us right now is former Manhattan prosecutor Jeremys Saland. It's good to have you back with me. Talk about this part of the process. I am fascinated by jury selection when it comes to the first and the unprecedented nature of just all of this. How long do you think this takes? 
 
JEREMY SALAND, FORMER MANHATTAN PROSECUTOR:  It's not measured in hours or days. It's measured in north of a week. Two weeks is certainly plausible. This is not an easy process. A misdemeanor case could take hours, sometimes even a couple of days. A lower-level felony that's not too complicated can take days. Unequivocally, with everything that's at stake, far, far longer. 
 
BOLDUAN:  What's the approach or the strategy that you think prosecutors should have as they begin this process today when it comes to the jury?
 
SALAND:  Both parties want to vet out anyone who has bias, anyone who has an agenda, especially someone who might be hidden in that crowd to get into that jury to sort of set what they want to see happen. So I think that's critical, and obviously Donald Trump wants to do that because he doesn't want someone who's going to predetermined his guilt. 
 
At the same time, you have the prosecution that doesn't want to set something up for an appeal if there are these bad jurors, for lack of a better term. So it's critical that they're going to engage them and it's not going
 
 to be dry and plain where it's just, I have a question, what's your answer? I expect there to be some back and forth so you can really understand, who is that juror, what might they say, what are their views? 
 
BOLDUAN:  And I was actually seeing some interesting reporting on how much social media, not in how Donald Trump will be reacting to the trial on a daily basis, but even in jury selection, how looking into the social media with publicly available from potential jurors could play a really big role here. 
 
SALAND:  Yes, absolutely. In smaller cases, you don't see that. It's pretty quick. You don't have the time to go looking through this. But in this matter, absolutely, because what is someone posting on social media? Are they saying that they have these hard feelings about the former president one way or another, or they're just happy go lucky people like you and I and regular folks. 
 
BOLDUAN:  I don't know, you can't put me in the category of happy good luck. I mean, you, yes. Absolutely.
 
SALAND:  You don't know me that well.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
BOLDUAN:  OK, so after the jury is seated, things begin, and the jury will then begin to hear from witnesses. We know, we've seen the list of potential witnesses in this case, including Hope Hicks, a longtime aide to Donald Trump, Michael Cohen, longtime former attorney for Michael -- Donald Trump, and Stormy Daniels among them. Who do you think is the most important of the witnesses? 
 
SALAND:  Well, when you break it the most important, you have Stormy Daniels is going to give you sort of the back understanding of why this is all happening. Why is it president even considering this? of course, the former president is going to deny that relationship. But it's relevant to his intent and what he wants to do. 
 
At the same time, there is Michael Cohen, who is the person who's in the room figuratively speaking and literally speaking, but he also has the most for the former president to attack because he's been convicted of a crime. He's lied and misrepresented. So those two people are critical. But at the same time, there's ample evidence. And remember, Stormy Daniels didn't come out and say this happened at first. She was quiet about and denied it. Just a lot of fodder here.  
 
BOLDUAN:  Do you do you think the prosecution would like to see Donald Trump take the stand? 
 
SALAND:  Absolutely. Let me say that again -- 100 percent. 
 
Now he's going to play games and he's not going to say whether in fact he will, or maybe he says he does because we want to keep them off guard. 
 
BOLDUAN:  He says he wants to, but then his legal team says he shouldn't. 
 
SALAND:  Of course not. The man is so bombastic and so uncontrollable that he could sink his own ship. I mean, you would learn to cross- examine this former president and have him contradict himself, have him go on a tirade, alienate the jury. He's ripe for prosecution to be cross-examined. 
 
BOLDUAN:  Let's not get too far ahead of ourselves, though. First, we're going to see Donald Trump leave Trump Tower and head downtown to lower Manhattan. And then, well, let's see what happens from there.
 
SALAND:  Absolutely.
 
BOLDUAN:  The sun rises in the east. That's the only thing I know for certain right now. It's great to see you, Jeremy. Thank you so much. 
 
SALAND:  You as well. 
 
BOLDUAN:  And the historic criminal trial of former President Donald Trump begins today. Jury selection in New York City and CNN special live coverage of all of it starts next hour right here on CNN and streaming on Max. Sara?
 
SIDNER:  All right, just in, there has been another stabbing attack in Sydney, Australia. A man has been arrested this morning for stabbing several people at a church. This is of course, after a man stabbed and killed six people at a busy shopping mall this weekend. We'll have more on that. 
 <br>[08:10:02]
 
Plus, furious and unrepentant, what prosecutors say the armorer from the film "Rust" said about jurors in her case. She is set to be sentenced today. 
 
And WNBA star and former Russian prisoner Brittney Griner making a huge announcement, how her life will be changed forever.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
SIDNER:  As we speak, Israel's war cabinet is meeting to decide on its response to Iran's weekend attack. 
 <br>[08:15:00]  
 
The looming questions, whether to strike back, when, where and how large of a response.  
 
The decision comes after an unprecedented attack by Iran on Israel where Israeli military officials say 99percent of the more than 300 munitions directed at Israel were intercepted.  
 
This morning, we've learned that Israel is not only considering a military response, but also a diplomatic one that could further isolate Iran.  President Biden and other world leaders have been urging Israel
 
 against any retaliation. Last hour, our national security council spokesperson, John Kirby spoke to our Kate Bolduan about the president's response.  
 
ADM. JOHN KIRBY (RET), COORDINATOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS AT THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL:  He has also been very clear, Kate, that we don't want a war with Iran. We don't seek to widen and broaden this conflict. We don't want to see things escalate.  
 
As a matter of fact, what we want to do is see things de-escalate and defending Israel the way we help do on Saturday, it should have that effect.  
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)  
 
SIDNER:  All right, joining us now is president of the Eurasia Group, Ian Bremmer.  
 
Thank you so much for being here. You just heard John Kirby saying, we do not want to escalate this. So what could a response look like from Israel? And do you see that going forward considering that the right flank of the party is really pushing for a major response?  
 
IAN BREMMER, PRESIDENT, EURASIA GROUP:  Sure. I mean, after 300 drones and missiles were launched against Israel, you can imagine there are a lot of people inside Israel, including in the War Cabinet, that are saying, you can't just allow this to sit irrespective of how successful Israeli and allied defense was, you have to take a military step, a military action against Iran itself.  
 
Now, I think if they decide to do that and certainly the Biden administration is doing everything they can to restrain it, it is going to be seen as less spectacular, as smaller, as against Iranian military facilities. Certainly not against any civilians.  
 
And more likely than not, against Iranian military capabilities outside Iran than actually on the  territory.  
 
But again, there are differences between the way that Bibi Netanyahu and his far right government feels about an escalation here, especially because of the potential to then drag the Americans into a conflict with Iran, something that they don't mind at all.  
 
And someone like Benny Gantz, who would like to be Netanyahu's successor, has a much warmer and stronger relationship with the Biden administration and would be on the side of restraint, would be on the side of not punting, to have a major response to what Iran did.  
 
SIDNER:  Ian, I do want to ask you, if this looks like the beginning of a regional war, if there is a response here, Iran said it was responding, it was retaliating for the death of seven people in Syria due to an Israeli attack there, including some of its commanders.  
 
And now you have this response from Iran, and now Israel is responding back and forth. I mean, are we headed into -- is this a real clear view that were headed into the beginning of a regional war?  
 
BREMMER:  I think we are in a regional war, but it is a proxy war right now. It is not a war directly between Iran and Israel with the Americans involved.  
 
And again, both Iran and the United States want to prevent that from happening very strongly. Israel is divided. Israel's political system is very divided. Their War Cabinet is divided. So that is where this pivot right now is occurring. That's what it's all dependent upon.  
 
But look, you'll remember when three American servicemen and women were killed in Jordan, the United States waited for a week to respond, and that response was telegraphed clearly through the Iraqi government, through the Turkish government, to make sure the Iranians knew what was coming and they were able to prepare and get their people out.  
 
And that helped to ensure that we didn't immediately tip into the United States fighting Iran and $150.00 to $200.00 oil and all the other consequences, right?  
 
This is exactly what the Iranians were trying to do over the weekend. They waited for a week responding to the Israeli strikes in Damascus on an Iranian diplomatic building against an Iranian military leader.  
 
They telegraphed what they were going to do to the Iraqis to the Turks in advance, who got the information to the United States.  
 
I mean, if they had wanted to cause huge damage to Israel, they wouldn't have told people in advance, here is when we are going to attack, here is how were going to attack.  
 
US, you and the allies, make sure you get it and help these guys, right? I mean, so clearly, the Iranians, were trying to limit the likelihood of having further escalation, but they also wanted to have some kind of spectacular show of force.  
 
And let's face it, it is hard to accomplish both of those things at the same time. And this is dangerous, it's a very dangerous environment.  
 
SIDNER:  Extremely dangerous environment. Incredible when you think about the number of munitions that there was no major damage according to the Israeli officials and no injuries or death.  
 <br>[08:20:08]  
 
Ian Bremmer, thank you so much for talking that out with us on this really important issue and that the Cabinet is still meeting at this hour. We should note -- John.  
 
BERMAN:  All right, any moment now, Donald Trump, the first former president ever to face criminal trial is set to depart Trump Tower. I think I just saw one of his key political aides leaving just a moment ago, we are standing by to see if Trump speaks ahead of jury selection today.  Park Rangers are asking the public to help them find two people caught
 
 on video destroying ancient rock formations in a national park. Look at that. If caught they could face jail time.  
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  
 
BERMAN:  Today, the armorer convicted of involuntary  manslaughter on the set of the movie, "Rust" faces sentencing in New Mexico. Prosecutors are asking that Hannah Gutierrez-Reed spend 18 months behind in bars, adding that she has shown a complete and total failure to accept responsibility for her actions.  
 
Her attorneys are asking for probation.  
 
New court documents reveal that Gutierrez-Reed lashed out on jurors at the trial. In recorded phone calls from jails, she called those jurors, "idiots and a-holes."  
 
CNN's Josh Campbell is with us now. So how will that impact what happens today, Josh?  
 
JOSH CAMPBELL, CNN SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, we will see what the judge ultimately decides that his hearing taking place just a couple of hours in New Mexico. This after Hannah Gutierrez-Reed was obviously convicted on a charge of involuntary manslaughter after Halyna Hutchins, who was the cinematographer on the film, the set of the movie, "Rust," was fatally shot.  
 
Now, as you  mentioned, prosecutors filed this motion last week asking for the full maximum sentence here, which would be 18 months in prison, as well as a $5,000.00 fine.  
 
And just to remind viewers we know that there was a death that occur heard here, but take a listen here to the closing arguments from prosecutors as they explained that although there was a death, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed was not prosecuted based on one isolated incident.  
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  
 
KARI MORRISSEY, PROSECUTOR:  This is not a case where Hannah Gutierrez made one mistake and that one mistake was accidentally putting a live round into that gun. That's not what this case is about.  
 
This case is about constant, never-ending safety failures that resulted in the death of a human being and nearly killed another.  
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)  
 
CAMPBELL:  Now Reed's attorney had indicated that his client was being scapegoated obviously, John. The jury saw it differently. We will wait to see what the judge does this morning as she is sentenced.  
 
BERMAN:  And the judge is also weighing a motion to dismiss when it comes to Alec Baldwin here?  
 
CAMPBELL:  That's right. You know, that case involving Alec Baldwin, which is set to go to trial this summer, has gotten very messy. It is not unusual to have prosecutors and defense attorneys engage in heated conversations, but it has gotten very personal.  
 
They are essentially lobbing insults at each other through court filings. I will show you this motion that Baldwin's attorney filed in March asking for this case to be thrown out. They wrote that prosecutors publicly dragged Baldwin through the cesspool created by their improprieties.  
 
This is an abuse of the system and an abuse of an innocent person whose rights have been trampled to the extreme.  
 
Prosecutors again, then responded, calling Baldwin and his legal team, calling them ignorant, calling them arrogant, calling them liars.  
 
And one filing saying that to watch Mr. Baldwin's conduct on the set of "Rust" as to witness a man who has absolutely no control over his own emotions and absolutely no concern for how his conduct affects those around him. So really, really stunning words there from both sides, again, not unusual to see defense counsel try to get a case dismissed. It is unusual to see the tone that we are seeing in some of these court filings -- John.  
 
BERMAN:  All right. Josh Campbell, thanks so much for being with us this morning. Great to see you, as always -- Kate.  
 
BOLDUAN:  The reports of multiple stabbings at an Australian Church this morning and this is as the entire country is still trying to come to terms with another rare mass casualty event that we've been talking about at that Sydney mall.  
 
And the next chapter in the already historic career of basketball phenom, Caitlin Clark, the next chapter is about to begin  tonight.
