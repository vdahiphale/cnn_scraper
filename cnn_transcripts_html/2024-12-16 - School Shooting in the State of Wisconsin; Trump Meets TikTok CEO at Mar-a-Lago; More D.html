UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Time never lies, and so if you look at the time, no matter what, this couldn't have happened. It's not even possible that this 
 
 happened.

ELIZABETH WAGMEISTER, CNN ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER:  All right. Now, I reached out to Jane Doe's attorney, and he says that they did vet her 
 
 claims, and he tells me, quote, "Our client remains adamant about her claim."
 
JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR:  Elizabeth Wagmeister, thanks. The news continues on CNN with Wolf Blitzer in The Situation Room. I'll see you tomorrow.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN ANCHOR, FIRST MOVE:  It's 8:00 a.m. in Seoul, 10:00 a.m. in Sydney, and 6:00 p.m. here in New York. I'm Julia Chatterley. And 
 
 wherever you are in the world, this is your "First Move."
 
And a warm welcome to "First Move." As always, here's today's need to know. School shooting, a teacher and a student have been killed, and at least six 
 
 more were injured in the U.S. State of Wisconsin. Social solution. Donald Trump says he has a warm spot for TikTok as he meets the CEO of Mar-a-Lago. 
 
 Drone dilemma. More sightings across the nation as the president-elect claims the government knows more than it's letting on. And chip charge. The 
 
 author of new book, "The NVIDIA Way." We'll discuss the tech trials and tribulations of the A.I. stock everyone wants to own. That conversation and 
 
 plenty more coming up.
 
But first, we begin with the latest shooting at an American school, a teacher and a student losing their lives in Madison, Wisconsin. The shooter 
 
 is also dead. Six students are hurt, two of them with life threatening injuries. A law enforcement source saying the suspect was a 17-year-old 
 
 girl who also attended the school. She's believed to have died from a self- inflicted gunshot wound. We're also expecting authorities in Madison to hold a news conference in around 30 minutes time. We will bring you that 
 
 update live. For now, Whitney Wild is covering the story for us from the City of Madison.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Today is a sad, sad day, not only for Madison, but for our entire country.
 
WHITNEY WILD, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  In Madison, Wisconsin, two people are dead, a teenage student and a teacher, both shot 
 
 by a teenage female student, according to a law enforcement source briefed on the school shooting.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Abundant Life Christian Church, 49-01 for engine 5 and medic 5 for a shooter.
 
WILD (voice-over):  Two people are dead, a teenage student and a teacher, both shot by a teenage female student.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Six other people were injured. Two students are now in critical condition in the hospital. And these injuries are considered life 
 
 threatening injuries.
 
WILD (voice-over):  Four other students are being treated for non-life threatening injuries. The Madison chief says multiple shots were fired. 
 
 Calls coming in at 10:57 a.m. at the K through 12 Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, just hours after the school day began.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  When officers arrived, they found multiple victims suffering from gunshot wounds.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Ambulance, ambulance, squad car, fire engine.
 
WILD (voice-over):  Madison police officers were on scene within minutes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Officers located a juvenile who they believe was responsible for this deceased in the building.
 
WILD (voice-over):  Shots were fired using a 9mm pistol and the suspect was found dead at the scene, according to police.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  PD is saying everybody can come in. All EMS can come in. Shooter is down.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Many of you have asked me about the why of this, why did this happen? What do we know? What was the motivation? I do not know. 
 
 But I will tell you this, our detectives are working hard in the investigative process to find out as many answers as we can so that we can 
 
 further prevent these things from happening.
 
WILD (voice-over):  Some medics responding directly from their training to reports of shots fired at the school.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The protocols are simple, stop the killing, stop the dying, find out who's doing this. And the officers did that.
 
WILD (voice-over):  The officers did not fire any shots according to the police chief. Instead, they assisted injured staff and students. The 
 
 shooting in Madison is the third at a small private Christian school in recent years. The second took place in Oroville, California less than two 
 
 weeks ago.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think we can all agree that enough is enough and we have to come together to do everything we can.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I think we need to do better in our country and our community to prevent gun violence.
 
WILD (voice-over):  The Madison School on its website asking for prayers today while frantic parents waited to hear if their kids were safe.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I pray with my kids every morning that this won't happen and it's the world like that we live in.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHATTERLEY:  Steve Moore is a law enforcement contributor. He served as a supervisory special agent at the FBI. Steve, good to have you with us. 
 
 Another U.S. community in mourning today and some obvious questions being asked there, what possessed this 17-year-old girl to enter the school and 
 
 carry out as she did? What motive could she have had?
 <br>[18:05:00]
 
STEVE MOORE, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT CONTRIBUTOR AND RETIRE SUPERVISORY SPECIAL AGENT, FBI:  You never know until long after the shootings. If we knew 
 
 about the motive beforehand, possibly we could have interdicted it. There is no -- obviously there is no adequate justification for this, but one of 
 
 the things that we are working on as a society is trying to identify people early on in the process of their mental health degradation, identify them 
 
 as people who bring violence. There are other things we have to get better at, obviously, but it's just disheartening each time this happens.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Deeply. Steve, to your point, and I think it is the next question, what was missed and where their clues perhaps or hints that will 
 
 look at now in hindsight and say, perhaps these things should have been identified to perhaps prevent this from happening in the first place? To 
 
 your point, hindsight is perfect site.
 
But one of the other questions I think that people will be asking now is how someone of a 17-year-old could age managed to get hold of a firearm in 
 
 this case too?
 
MOORE:  See, and this is the -- you know, the dichotomy of the whole thing of trying to keep guns out of the hands of people who -- of dangerous 
 
 people like this. She wasn't even legally allowed to own it or possess it. So, right now, you have a situation where the laws right now should have 
 
 prevented this.
 
And so, you know, we have to come to grips with the fact of the number, the millions and millions of guns that are possessed by Americans. And even if 
 
 we were to stop the sale and future possession of guns today, we still have to do something to protect students in the schools right now, because we're 
 
 not predicting them very well. And we're not interdicting them at the source of the shooting quick enough. We are quick -- I mean, if the police 
 
 hadn't shown up, who knows how many people we would have dying on this, but we have to get even better.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Steve, this is, by our count, the 83rd school shooting this year. It's a record since at least CNN started counting back in 2008. And 
 
 the point is, the numbers continue to increase. So, whether we seem to split down political lines that there needs to be more checks and the 
 
 remedy is to focus on perhaps mental health, or then the opposing side is more restrictive gun laws. And I think the average person would argue 
 
 actually both are required. We're not doing enough today, certainly, because these numbers are rising.
 
MOORE:  Yes. And, you know, obviously, there's a strong psychological reason for this. If you go back 30, 40 years in America, we weren't having 
 
 these shootings and guns were more available. So, we have to deal with social media and how things -- how information and how it is transferred 
 
 and how people are motivated by this.
 
But one thing we have to do, yes, we have to work on guns. We're trying. There's literally hundreds of millions of guns already in American society. 
 
 You're not going to get rid of those in the near future no matter how successful you are in getting gun control.
 
So, what we have to do is go to the third point. And the third point is this, it takes police an average of two to three minutes to respond to our 
 
 call for a school shooter. If we can delay the school shooter two minutes, three minutes from getting into a school we can prevent many of these 
 
 shootings and would have probably prevented this one had we kept that shooter out of the school for three minutes.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes. To your point, it presses the need for greater emphasis on preventative measures, whether that's mental health measures or in the 
 
 immediacy, in the immediate minutes before this.
 
MOORE:  All of it.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes. Steve, good to have you, sir, thank you. Law enforcement contributor there, Steve Moore.
 
MOORE:  Thank you.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Meanwhile, President-Elect Donald Trump is apparently meeting with the CEO of TikTok, that's according to a person familiar with the 
 
 plans. Ahead of the meeting, Trump suggested he might help TikTok avoid a pending ban. Let's just listen to his exact words.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP, U.S. PRESIDENT-ELECT:  We'll take a look at TikTok. You know, I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok because I won youth by 34 points. 
 
 And there are those that say that TikTok has something to do with that.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHATTERLEY:  We should note Trump actually lost younger voters to Harris, according to exit polls. But TikTok is facing a U.S. ban just ahead of 
 
 Trump's inauguration, unless it's sold to a non-Chinese company, something that the Chinese have been resisting. TikTok asked the U.S. Supreme Court 
 
 on Monday to put that deadline on hold.
 <br>[18:10:00]
 
Stephen Collinson joins me now. That warm spot involves 170 million users of TikTok in the United States as well. So, this is an important question, 
 
 but it's one of the rare areas of bipartisan agreement that there were national security reasons for trying to force this sale or enacting a ban. 
 
 Do we expect a U-turn on this, Stephen, in the new year?
 
STEPHEN COLLINSON, CNN POLITICS SENIOR REPORTER:  Well, at least I guess Trump is being honest. He's saying that any reprieve for TikTok would be 
 
 based on his self-interest when he becomes president. This is going to be quite fascinating because not only did Trump once try to ban TikTok 
 
 unsuccessfully, many members of his incoming cabinet want it banned and actually led the charge in Congress to get it banned. For example, 
 
 Secretary of State Designate Marco Rubio, Mike Watts, the incoming White House national security adviser.
 
So, Trump is going to have to fashion some kind of climb down if he doesn't want to get TikTok banned and it's going to be very interesting to see how 
 
 he gets himself out of this. He could ask Congress to repeal the law, the ban TikTok, that would seem a heavy lift in this anti-China Congress. He 
 
 could not enforce the ban. That would be cause all sorts of legal challenges, or he could try and find some way to certify that the asset was 
 
 divested.
 
You've got all these CEOs going through -- of tech firms going through Mar- a-Lago, maybe that's his idea. But it's going to be interesting to watch when he takes office, as with many other things.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Separating the China question and the national security risk sounds like the hardest route here, trying to find some kind of business 
 
 solution and tech solution, and using it with leverage with the Chinese perhaps too improve relations might be the answer to your point.
 
Something else that he suggested today or talked about, which I thought was quite interesting, was that he suggested that the situation in the Middle 
 
 East might improve or it's going to be in a better place. He described the Ukraine-Russia situation is actually being far harder. And just bearing in 
 
 mind, he suggested previously that he could solve that or resolve that issue in 24 hours previously, it suggests he's recognizing that this 
 
 situation is perhaps far more complicated to resolve and bringing Russia to the table in this circumstance is going to be tougher than he realized.
 
COLLINSON:  Yes, this is a classic clash between the campaign trail rhetoric and reality. And the reality in Ukraine has actually shifted in 
 
 the last few months. At the moment, and given Trump's contacts with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, it appears that the Ukrainians are more 
 
 amenable to some kind of end to this war than the Russians might be, notwithstanding the severe economic effects we're starting to see in Moscow 
 
 because of U.S. and international sanctions. The tide on the ground in the war appears to have turned in Putin's favor in recent months.
 
Now, Trump is faced with the position of trying to get President Vladimir Putin to do a deal, a deal that will be acceptable not just to Ukraine, but 
 
 to Europeans and every other stakeholder in this conflict, and it's going to be difficult. What exact leverage does Trump have right now if Putin 
 
 doesn't believe it's in his interests to stop?
 
And either way, Putin is going to drive a very hard bargain. You've got this very difficult question of how do you not reward Russia for an illegal 
 
 invasion of a sovereign democratic country? Trump might not be -- might not care about that too much. But the problem is he doesn't want to set himself 
 
 up with a situation and some kind of peace deal that might last a few years and then erupt into war in the middle of his presidency. So, this is a very 
 
 thorny issue.
 
CHATTERLEY:  I was going to say, you have to ensure that whatever agreement is reached doesn't end up in Russia re-invading or trying to take more 
 
 territory, at least certainly in the near-term, or at least in the next four and a half years.
 
COLLINSON:  Yes. And you know, Trump doesn't seem very convincing in a lot of his arguments here. He doesn't have a solution. There are some people 
 
 behind him, some of the foreign policy advisers who have talked about various solutions, but they would fall well short of NATO's guarantees or 
 
 NATO membership down the road for Ukraine that Kyiv appears to want in this situation.
 
And just saying, as Trump does say, that this would never have happened if I was president. When it comes to the actuality of ending the conflict, the 
 
 tough negotiations that will be required, that doesn't really help him.
 
CHATTERLEY:  No, and both things can be true. It doesn't make it less complicated to end it, even if it perhaps wouldn't have started, which is 
 
 up for debate when he was president. Yes, Stephen Collinson, sir, thank you.
 
COLLINSON:  Thanks.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Now, Donald Trump also saying the U.S. government knows more about the recent drone sightings than what they're letting on.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TRUMP:  For some reason they don't want to comment, and I think they'd be better off saying what it is. Our military knows and our president knows, 
 
 and for some reason, they want to keep people in suspense. I can't imagine it's the enemy, because if it was the enemy, they'd blast it out.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[18:15:00]
 
CHATTERLEY:  More drones were spotted over the weekend with reports emerging in Ohio on top of other states. Defense officials say the 
 
 government is now sending drone detection and tracking systems to two military facilities in New Jersey, where the sighting started now almost a 
 
 month ago. Polo Sandoval has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
TRUMP:  They're very close to Bedminster. I think maybe I won't spend the weekend in Bedminster.
 
POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  The president-elect offering a drone theory of his own about the mysterious sightings first reported over New 
 
 Jersey, including over his golf course.
 
TRUMP:  The government knows what is happening. Look, our military knows where they took off from. If it's a garage, they can go right into that 
 
 garage. They know where it came from and where it went.
 
SANDOVAL (voice-over):  Donald Trump declined to say if he's been briefed on the investigation into the unexplained drones that were first reported 
 
 four weeks ago, he did seem to eliminate the possibility of foreign involvement, a theory that had already been previously shared by the 
 
 current administration.
 
TRUMP:  I can't imagine it's the enemy because it was the enemy that blasted out. Even if they were late, they'd blast it.
 
SANDOVAL (voice-over):  Unanswered questions have hovered over some residents in New Jersey and beyond. Similar drone reports have come into 
 
 authorities in at least six states now. The FBI, which briefed New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy Sunday night, insists many of the reported sightings 
 
 are actually manned aircraft.
 
DHS maintains the unexplained sightings don't pose a public safety threat and stated unequivocally that not all of them are airplanes.
 
ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS, U.S. HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY:  There's no question that people are seeing drones, and I want to assure the American public 
 
 that we in the federal government have deployed additional resources, personnel, technology to assist the New Jersey State Police in addressing 
 
 the drone sightings.
 
SANDOVAL (voice-over):  That does little to assure elected officials on both sides of the aisle.
 
ERIK PETERSON, NEW JERSEY STATE ASSEMBLY:  They've been trying to discredit these sightings from the very beginning.
 
SANDOVAL (voice-over):  Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut told CNN that assurances from the government, quote, "fall 
 
 flat."
 
SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT):  My fear is that the federal government knows little or nothing about most of these sightings.
 
SANDOVAL (voice-over):  Two weekend incidents demonstrated a disruptive potential from drones in civilian and military airspace. Two men in Boston 
 
 were arrested for trespassing after flying dangerously close to Logan Airport. And in Ohio, flight restrictions were temporarily put in place due 
 
 to drone activity at one of the Air Force's most critical installations.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHATTERLEY:  Bashar al-Assad's exit from Syria caught the world by surprise. Including the dictator himself. This statement purportedly from 
 
 Assad was posted on the Syrian presidency's Telegram account. It says, my departure from Syria was neither planned, nor did it occur during the final 
 
 hours of the battles, as some have claimed. On the contrary, I remained in Damascus carrying out my duties until the early hours of Sunday, 8th of 
 
 December, 2024, as Fred Pleitgen reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over):  As Syrians celebrate the demise of the Assad regime, the deposed dictator 
 
 seemingly delusional, apparently speaking out for the first time since fleeing to Russia. His statement on the social media page of the former 
 
 Syrian presidency, appearing to be from Assad himself, datelined Moscow. I have never sought positions for personal gain, but have always considered 
 
 myself as a custodian of a national project, the statement says.
 
This after Syrians ransacking Assad's palace discovered the luxury the dictator and his family were living in. Including a garage with dozens of 
 
 luxury cars, including Ferraris and a Lamborghini.
 
Assad's wife, Asma, also known for her lavish outfits, once called, quote, "a rose in the desert" by Vogue magazine. But Assad also admitting as 
 
 rebels were closing in on his palace, it was Russian leader Vladimir Putin who bailed him out. Assad fleeing to Russia's air base in Syria as he 
 
 claims to oversee combat operations. But then quote, "It became clear that our forces had completely withdrawn from the battle lines and that the last 
 
 army positions had fallen," his statement reads, "With no viable means of leaving the base, Moscow requested that the base's command arrange for an 
 
 immediate evacuation to Russia on the evening of Sunday, December 8th."
 
That was not only the end of Assad's rule in Syria, but possibly also the beginning of the end of Russia's military footprint in Syria, as Russian 
 
 forces have been seen apparently flying some of their equipment out of their air force base.
 
And Israel is now busy bombing Syrian military installations like this naval base in Latakia. Russian-Middle East experts warning about the huge 
 
 loss to Russia in the wake of Assad's fall. When I saw these ships with our weapons burning, I simply felt like crying, this expert says. These are our 
 
 weapons, our gears after all and our help to the Syrians to protect their statehood.
 <br>[18:20:00]
 
But those now in charge in Syria are working on a new statehood without Assad, the former dictator seemingly grappling with his loss of power. When 
 
 the state falls into the hands of terrorism and the ability to make a meaningful contribution is lost, the statement says, any position becomes 
 
 void of purpose, rendering its occupation meaningless.
 
Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Moscow.

CHATTERLEY:  OK. Coming up here on "First Move," the inside story on a stock lots of people wish they'd bought this year, A.I. chip giant, NVIDIA. 
 
 It wasn't always an unstoppable force. How NVIDIA became, well, NVIDIA, next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHATTERLEY:  Welcome back to "First Move." And it's tech investor bliss on the week before Christmas topping today's Money Move. Not quite rhyming 
 
 there, but we tried. Wall Street finishing mostly high on Monday, with the NASDAQ hitting fresh records, thanks in part to the ongoing rallying chip 
 
 firm Broadcom, whose earnings and A.I. forecast wowed investors last week. Broadcom shares up another 11 percent after that 24 percent rise on Friday.
 
Alphabet still riding high after announcing a breakthrough last week with its quantum computer chip. It shares gaining another 3.5 percent. Bitcoin 
 
 also hitting fresh records. All this, of course, as investors await the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates on Wednesday, another quarter 
 
 of a percentage point cut priced in.
 
Asia, softer as investors await policy decisions later this week too from the Central Banks of both Japan and China. And South Korean stocks fell 
 
 after the country's parliament voted to impeach their president on Saturday too, just a two-tenth of a percent decline there.
 
Now, in other business news call it to take it to the bank promise from Japanese tech giant SoftBank. Masayoshi Son met with President-Elect Donald 
 
 Trump at Mar-a-Lago on Monday and promised to invest some $100 billion in the United States over the next four years. It's a move he hopes will 
 
 create 100,000 new jobs in the A.I. industry.
 
The two men then engaged in a bit of impromptu back and forth negotiation with the president-elect, asking him to double his commitment. Just listen 
 
 to this.
 <br>[18:25:00]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MASAYOSHI SON, SOFTBANK GROUP CEO:  We were discussing and President Trump said, Masa, you know, double that, it's not enough. Maybe, you know, go for 
 
 more, right?
 
TRUMP:  That's right. I'm going to ask him right now, would you make it $200 billion instead -- he can actually -- believe it or not he can 
 
 actually afford to do that if he wants to. Would you do that?
 
SON:  Well, my promise is $100, but, you know, he's now asking to do more. I think, you know, with your leadership, my partnership with you, with your 
 
 support, I will try to make it happen.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHATTERLEY:  Trying to work out if that was a happy laugh or a nervous laugh. Son also controls the SoftBank Vision Venture Capital Fund. And by 
 
 the way, he made a similar cash commitment back in 2016 after Trump's first presidential win, vowing to invest $50 billion in the US. He ended up 
 
 exceeding that goal with a total investment of some $75 billion.
 
Now, Masayoshi Son maybe one of the world's savviest tech investors, but he appears to have made at least one movie regrets over his highly successful 
 
 and volatile career, his decision to sell SoftBank's entire stake in NVIDIA years before the A.I. chipmaker became a Wall Street darling. SoftBank was 
 
 one of NVIDIA's largest shareholders before Son unloaded he's almost 5 percent stake in the firm back in 2019. He even commiserated with NVIDIA 
 
 CEO Jensen Huang about the move at an A.I. conference in Tokyo last month.
 
And this year, NVIDIA remains one of Wall Street's outperformers up 174 percent since January with a market cap of almost three and a quarter 
 
 trillion dollars. And taking a wider view, it's up more than 2,000 percent over the past five years. Look at that chart.
 
A new book called "The NVIDIA Way" is the inside story of how the chipmaker transformed itself from a firm specializing in computer gaming chips to the 
 
 A.I. trailblazer it is today. And it was written by Tae Kim, who spent years writing about the company. And I'm pleased to say Tae joins us now. 
 
 Fantastic to have you on the show.
 
Two things stand out for me in this book, and it is the highs and lows sort of technically and technologically of in video and what it took to get to 
 
 the place they're at today. But it was also about the unique leadership, I think, that Jensen provides and the corporate culture that he built and 
 
 sort of the anti-fragile business that it created. And actually, that's where I want to start.
 
According to the book, he's got 60 direct reports. I mean, most CEOs have a fraction of that. He's intimately involved in even the most junior people 
 
 via an e-mail method. Just describe the culture first and foremost, because I think it's key.
 
TAE KIM, AUTHOR, "THE NVIDIA WAY":  The culture is very flat. And it's one of speed and velocity. They talk about this concept called speed of light, 
 
 where you do things as fast as possible. It's not based on, you know, 10 percent better than competitor, 10 percent better than last time. Jensen 
 
 wants you to do it as fast as possible. No lag time. And only to the limits of physics. So, everything is held to that standard. And Jensen has those 
 
 kind of high standards for everyone.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes. And that was crucial in chip building as well, because he didn't let absolute perfection like some others did get in the way of 
 
 creating a chip and it allowed them to be, in certain cases, critical few months ahead of some of their competitors, but we'll come back to that.
 
But he's also seemingly a brilliant selector of talent, I think, and also a tactician, to your point about speed. But also, there were times when he 
 
 tried to hire people, they said no, he'd keep going after them. At times when they were in crisis and he'd raise money, he wasn't afraid to ask. I 
 
 mean, he's incredibly resilient and resourceful too.
 
KIM:  I have so many stories of his resilience when they're weeks away from going out of business. Somehow, he figures out a partnership. Somehow, he 
 
 figures out hiring the perfect person. He's always been charismatic from the beginning, from when he started 30 years ago.
 
And when you talk to the venture capitalists who invested with him in 1993, they said he's so convincing, he's able to persuade people at the last-
 
 minute and come out with a rabbit out of the hat. And I think the thing with Jensen is it's a real-life "Good Will Hunting" story too. It's been a 
 
 privilege to be able to compile this amazing story. I mean, he started as a small child immigrating to the U.S. His parents sold everything so he could 
 
 send him to a good boarding school and they accidentally sent him to a reform school in Kentucky. He was playing chess with the janitor there.
 
He learned his great work ethic by scrubbing toilets at a Denny's and being a server. And then, he went from that to co-founding one of the most 
 
 consequential technology in the modern era. And it's not just that, it's the best performing stock in US history. I mean, this, these are 
 
 extraordinary outcomes. And it's been a privilege to be the first person to document that.
 <br>[18:30:00]
 
CHATTERLEY:  Oh, I was going to say, I'm shocked, actually, having read it that there hasn't been a book before. It's sort of an overnight success 
 
 that's been 30-plus years in the making, to your point. The chess reference is interesting though because at one point you sort of tell a story of he 
 
 played a better chess player and he upended the chessboard, he's so furious and then challenged him to ping pong where he knew he was better. So, it 
 
 gives you a sense of the character as well.
 
One of the interesting things as well was Intel for me in the '90s, where Intel were like, look, we've got a chip coming. Don't bother with NVIDIA. 
 
 You're wasting your time. And people -- buyers listened on their pipeline died, and he even went to the staff and said, look, we're probably going to 
 
 be bankrupt in 30 days. And again, he managed to turn that around. It goes back, I think, to the person, but also the loyalty of the people that were 
 
 working for him, that they were working 20 hours a day to try and make it through this period.
 
KIM:  So, I think the work ethic has always been there from the beginning, and it starts from the top. Jensen, in the 1990s, he worked from 9:00 to 
 
 midnight consistently, and his employees followed suit. And that moment when they were literally running out of cash, and Intel was out to get 
 
 them, I mean, Intel was very dominant in the 1990s, that they were the dominant chip maker, and they told the PC makers, like you said, oh, we're 
 
 going to come out with a better chip. So, why don't you wait for us?
 
And NVIDIA -- like, Intel at that point was 860 times larger, right? And NVIDIA really couldn't compete but he, again, did a rallying cry with the 
 
 employees and employees worked even harder, even longer, and they were able to survive and fight back.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Tae, there's no sign that he wants to step down or step back, but can NVIDIA carry on the way it is and it is doing without Jensen?
 
KIM:  I think that'll be a big question. First of all, that's not going to happen anytime soon. He loves working at this company. He finds work 
 
 fulfilling. Work is relaxing to him. He works all weekend, all night. So, that's not going to happen anytime soon.
 
But eventually, NVIDIA will, you know, have a new CEO. And at that point, it really comes to the question of the quality of that next CEO. Is it 
 
 going to be Satya Nadella from Microsoft, or is it going to be John Sculley, like, which was almost a disaster for Apple and drove -- almost 
 
 drove Apple into bankruptcy? So, we don't know who the next CEO is, and it really depends on if that person is going to be as good as Jensen.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes. But for now, he's riding the wave and he's not getting off that surfboard. Tae Kim, it's a great book. The author of "The NVIDIA 
 
 Way." I recommend people read it, because it's fascinating. Great to have you on, sir. Thank you.
 
KIM:  Thank you so much.
 
CHATTERLEY:  We'll be right back. Stay with "First Move."
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:35:00]
 
CHATTERLEY:  Welcome back to "First Move" with a look at more of the international headlines this hour. U.S. authorities now warning the public 
 
 against firing at drones. Investigators are underway into the mysterious drone sightings across New Jersey and a handful of other states. Officials 
 
 say there's been, quote, "an increase" in pilots of manned aircraft being hit in the eyes with lasers by people mistaking them for drones.
 
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has lost a confidence vote and the nation now facing snap elections as early as February. The Christian Democrats are 
 
 expected to win. Europe's largest economy has slowed down under Scholz's leadership and the nation's auto industry has faced major layoffs and plant 
 
 closures.
 
An attorney for Jay-Z has strongly denied the rape claim against him, saying, quote, "This never happened." An anonymous woman has accused Jay-Z 
 
 and Geld music producer Sean Diddy Combs of sexually assaulting her when she was 13. Just days ago, she admitted in an NBC interview that there were 
 
 inconsistencies in her original story.
 
And returning now to our top story once again and fresh details emerging about today's school shooting in Wisconsin. A law enforcement source 
 
 telling CNN the shooter was a female 17-year-old student at a private school in the City of Madison. Police say the shooter took her own life. 
 
 The two people killed were a teacher and a teenage student. Another six people were injured, two have life threatening injuries. The mayor of 
 
 Madison says the whole community has been impacted.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SATYA RHODES-CONWAY, MAYOR OF MADISON, WISCONSIN:  I think we need to do better in our country and our community to prevent gun violence. And I hope 
 
 -- I hoped that this day would never come in Madison. It is not something that any mayor, any fire chief, any police chief, any person in public 
 
 office ever wants to have to deal with.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHATTERLEY:  Daniel Brunner is a retired FBI special agent. He's also president and co-founder of the security firm Brunner Sierra Group. Daniel, 
 
 good to have you with us. I'm sorry it's under such circumstances. We're expecting this latest press conference momentarily. Can I ask what you'll 
 
 be listening for specifically?
 
DANIEL BRUNNER, RETIRED FBI SPECIAL AGENT AND PRESIDENT, BRUNNER SIERRA GROUP:  Well, at this point, unfortunately, we are in the process and the 
 
 FBI and the -- and working with Wisconsin, and they're starting to look at the trace backwards. Since the shooter took her own life, we need to figure 
 
 out at what point the pathway to violence got her here to this point. What triggered her? Were their warning signs? And these are all questions which 
 
 are going to be asked, but at this point, within, you know, hours, this is -- these are going to be questions and be answered in days from now. You 
 
 have to give the FBI and the Wisconsin law enforcement entities time to conduct the investigation.
 
But at this point right now, it's the community helping those -- the victims, which are in the hospital, but also the victims that are still at 
 
 the school, the students who were there, who may witness something. Those students need the victim specialists at the FBI who are trained in how to 
 
 deal with this and trained and talking to young children and how to get them to talk about what they heard what they saw.
 
Not the four, you know, as a witness and not to gain evidence, but you get them to start processing what they worked on. So, I think that we're going 
 
 to be looking for certain answers. Maybe if they know the motivation, maybe if they -- you know, the family -- where the gun was purchased, those are 
 
 the sorts of things that they're showing that they're going to be positive. But details of two evidence and evidentiary purposes and as far as the 
 
 investigation, we're not going to get those. Those are -- it's too quickly, too early in the investigation right now.
 
CHATTERLEY:  It's an important way to describe though those that survived this and perhaps heard or saw things as victims as well because they have 
 
 to live with this experience for the rest of their lives too. One sixth grade students, so, for those that don't live in the United States, we're 
 
 talking a child of around 11 or 12, didn't see what took place but heard it and described what they heard and how they felt. I just want to play that 
 
 for our viewers.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ADLER JEAN-CHARLES, ABUNDANT LIFE CHRISTIANE SCHOOL STUDENT:  I was in English and then they said it was a lockdown drill. So, we went to the side 
 
 of the building. And then, we went to the church after they came and get, got us. Yes. And then we just waited. They gave us some food and then 
 
 waited to for them to transport us to the hospital and get our moms and dads.
 <br>[18:40:00]
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Did you hear gunshots or -- 
 
JEAN-CHARLES:  Yes, I heard.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Tell me what happened.
 
JEAN-CHARLES:  We heard them and then some people started crying. And then, we just waited until the police came. And then, they escorted us out to the 
 
 church.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  How many gunshots did you hear?
 
JEAN-CHARLES:  I heard two.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  And what were you thinking? What are you thinking now?
 
JEAN-CHARLES:  I was scared.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHATTERLEY:  Daniel, it's quite shocking to me to listen to a child like that so rationally describing something so horrific that they heard and 
 
 experienced. Again, it goes back to the question of what happened here, what do we need to understand, and also how a 17-year-old girl got hold of 
 
 a firearm. Because under possession rules there, she shouldn't have been in contact with one or been able to get hold of one in order to carry this 
 
 out.
 
BRUNNER:  Well, a lot of it has to go down to -- and again, this is me speculating. I don't know the situation. I don't know the investigation, 
 
 but a lot of it has to be responsible gun ownership. If the gun was obtained from the parents from where they had it, if they left it unlocked, 
 
 that's irresponsible. If they are going to have a weapon in the house, you should be a responsible gun owner. Keep it locked up. Keep it in a safe. 
 
 And teaching the children that these are not toys. These are not -- you know, this is nothing to be trifled with.
 
But I'm sure that there has to be a figured out way how she was able to obtain the weapon, maybe from her parents, maybe illegally on the streets. 
 
 I don't know. But at 17 years old, I know in the State of Wisconsin, it is illegal for her to purchase a weapon. In the United States, 21 years old. 
 
 But in the State of Wisconsin, there are some legal loopholes, which were - - she can obtain it at the age of 18, but not at 17.
 
So, determining these things are going to be to find out her pathway to violence. A lot of these things we learn from these incidents into 
 
 addressing the future and how we can avoid and having people around her, what did they see? Did they know that there was something going on? Did 
 
 they see any trigger signs, send any red flags? Could something have been said to avoid this situation? Those are the things that we're going to 
 
 learn at, we're going to talk about. And I think this conversation needs to be had between families, parents, children, and family members and 
 
 politicians about this.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes. And what preventative measures, to your point, could have been taken? It looks like that press conference is just getting underway. 
 
 So, we're going to go to Madison, Wisconsin now and listen in.
 
SHON BARNES, MADISON POLICE DEPARTMENT CHIEF:  Again, my name is Chief Shon Barnes, S-H-O-N B-A-R-N-E-S, with our third update of the day regarding our 
 
 school shooting here in Madison, Wisconsin.
 
Here are the latest updates. The reunification of students and their loved ones who survived this incident is complete. All student survivors have 
 
 been reunified with their parents. We're still in the process of reunifying some of our staff, our teachers who selflessly stayed back to make sure our 
 
 kids were OK. We're currently reunifying them with their loved ones as well.
 
We do understand that this process of reunification may have taken a while and parents really wanted to see their children, give their children a hug. 
 
 Certainly, I would as a father, but we are fortunate that that process is complete.
 
As such, I want to thank the Dean Clinic. This clinic actually shut down their doors today in order to provide a space so that students who survived 
 
 this incident could be reunified with their loved ones, and we thank them for doing this.
 
At this time, we're still working on a motive trying to determine why this happened. We know that there is some information that may be circulating 
 
 about the shooter. I cannot at this time formally tell you the age or gender or name of the shooter. We do not want to compromise any part of the 
 
 investigation. But it is important to note that later today at 8:30, I plan to give an additional update. And I believe at that time, we may be able to 
 
 give you the answers to some of those questions.
 
Here's what we know. Again, we have three people who have lost their lives. Two of those people were persons were pronounced dead at the scene and one 
 
 while on the way to the hospital. Of the six injured and taken to local hospitals, two students remain in critical condition. Their injuries are 
 
 life threatening. A teacher and three other students were taken to area hospitals with non-life-threatening injuries. Two of those victims, two of 
 
 those survivors have been released from the hospital. So, that is an update.
 <br>[18:45:00]
 
Officers were dispatched to Abundant Life Christian School at 10:57. I can confirm that the first officers arrived at 11:00 a.m. and immediately went 
 
 in the building three minutes later. The crime response unit of Dane County District Attorney's Office assisted by the Dane County Emergency Management 
 
 were mobilizing our mass violence critical response team. Once again, our mass violence critical response team have been -- has been notified.
 
This is a group of people trained and responding to victims of mass violence, which includes social workers, attorneys, victims, professionals, 
 
 former law enforcement and members of our community. If you need further assistance or want to know how you can help, you can contact the Crime 
 
 Response Program. They have a daytime number of 608-284-6908. They have an afterhours number for those who may want to help at 608-376-0164, 608-376-
 
 0164.
 
Preplanned or planned shootings, we believe are preventable. If you see warning behaviors from someone that is planning an attack, say something, 
 
 do something. You can report this at 1-800-MY-SUSO-1, 1-800-MY-SUSO-1.
 
At this time, joining us is Director of Advancement, Barbara Wiers.
 
BARBARA WIERS, DIRECTOR OF ELEMENTARY AND SCHOOL RELATIONS, ABUNDANT LIFE CHRISTIAN SCHOOL:  Thank you. I understand there's questions regarding the 
 
 school. We're happy to answer those to the best of our ability. We have been incredibly supported by Madison Police, Madison Fire, and the 
 
 paramedics. They have been absolutely amazing to us. It was quite an afternoon for the reunification process, and we had so many people stepping 
 
 up to help. Our families were amazing in their patience as we worked through this.
 
We are so grateful from the president up to the governor, the mayor. We have had so much support. This has obviously rocked our school community, 
 
 but we know it affects not just our school community, but Madison and the greater area and all schools. And so, our hope is that there will be some 
 
 good that comes out of this as we can learn and grow and continue to support other schools.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Chief, can you give us any details about if there were any warning signs that premeditated this either at the school or with the 
 
 family or elsewhere that would have caused any red flags?
 
BARNES:  Yes, that's what the officers and detectives are working on now. Hopefully, this afternoon at our fourth press conference, I'll be able to 
 
 answer that a little bit further. But right now, I cannot tell you. They're still talking to parents who are cooperating. And so, hopefully, we'll be 
 
 able to give you a more detailed response as to any warning signs or anything that we may have possibly known prior to this.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All right. Maddie from WISC.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  There's been heavy police presence at a home on the north side. Can you confirm if that's related to this?
 
BARNES:  I can't confirm that it is related to this and everyone is cooperating. And so, hopefully, later today, if you stick around, we'll be 
 
 able to give you more information about that and what we may have learned from that process. Again, this is a situation where students, teachers were 
 
 injured and killed and everyone wants to cooperate. Everyone wants to give as much information as they can so we can piece this together for our 
 
 community.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  OK. Phoebe from Wisconsin Watch.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes, thank you. So, accounts online are sharing doctored and debunked photos to push a narrative about the identity of this 
 
 shooter that it goes far beyond what has been released publicly. Can you respond to that? And can you also say what effect that has on either the 
 
 families of the victims or the public's trust in the law enforcement investigation and what you say contradicts this media narrative that's on 
 
 social media?
 
BARNES:  Absolutely. Social media is something that quite frankly I can't control and neither can anyone in this room. Everyone in here is a trusted 
 
 and respectful journalists. And your word means a lot, which is why we're doing our third press conference of the day to get the actual truth out to 
 
 what has happened. We have a PIO, three of them working today to make sure we have information.
 <br>[18:50:00]
 
I will say this, if you're listening to this or you're at home and you're thinking about reposting or sending something that did not come from 
 
 someone in this room, a trusted and respected journalist or did not come from someone us, please don't do that. Because to answer the second part of 
 
 your question, what that does is it does help erode the trust in this process and that's all we have.
 
And also, it could further fan the flames, if you will, of misinformation and a fear at a time where we need to come together and not be divided by 
 
 anything.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All right. WMTV.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Hello. I'm (INAUDIBLE) were there any lessons learned from -- back in May, from the Mount Horeb shooting that you guys used in 
 
 action today?
 
BARNES:  So, we were not -- that's not my jurisdiction. And so, I won't speak to anything that we learned at Mount Horeb, but I will speak to 25 
 
 years of law enforcement. What I've learned is that every opportunity is an opportunity to grow, do better, and train. This department trains 
 
 constantly on this thing. I spoke about it earlier. We train as far recent as -- actually today because our set medics were training at the training 
 
 center three miles away. And the training day turned into an actual response.
 
So, as far as the incident at Mount Horeb, it wasn't my jurisdiction. So, the only thing that I can tell you is we try to learn from everything and 
 
 try to get better. Even this one, we'll do an after action debrief once everything is done and we'll talk about how we responded. Is there anything 
 
 that we can do better? Continuous improvement is one of our core values and we take that very seriously.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All right. Laura from (INAUDIBLE).
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Do you have any idea of where the gun came from? Was it did it -- belong to the shooter? Did it belong parents?
 
BARNES:  I do not know. That's part of the investigation process. We're trying to determine that. We're lucky to have great partners at the ATF. 
 
 They obviously have a program that you're all aware of called the trace program. And so, we're working with them to try to find the origin of this. 
 
 And I have no doubt that we'll be able to do that with their help. They are amazing partners along with our partners from the FBI.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It was a handgun, right, can you confirm?
 
BARNES:  I confirmed earlier that was a handgun.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  WKOW, Madison.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  OK.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes. Can I ask Barbara a question?
 
BARNES:  Yes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Is that OK? I'm just curious what kind of safety protocols are in place in the school? Do you have a metal detector? Did the 
 
 police on staff kind of -- anything like that and does this kind of change the way things be looking forward? I know it's kind of early to ask.
 
WIERS:  Sure. We're a small private Christian school here on the east side of Madison. We serve 3K to 12. Our -- we have had an amazing partnership 
 
 with the DOJ and the Office of Schools Safety because they have done trainings, they've provided school safety grants and we have participated 
 
 in both of those school safety grants to harden our school, if you can use that language.
 
We do not have metal detectors, but we do have a number of security protocols in place. We have always been told not to share our security 
 
 protocols with -- publicly because then those who might want to do harm will know your security protocols. But the students are aware that there 
 
 are cameras in the building and we do monitor those regularly in the offices so that we know what is happening in the hallways. We also have 
 
 other safety measures throughout the building. But as to a metal detector, no, we do not have.
 
We do abide by the policy of visual scans every morning as students come into the building. So, every student is visually scanned before they go 
 
 into their -- up to their locker spaces or into their classrooms.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  How many students are there?
 
WIERS:  420, 3K to 12.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Lucas from the State Journal.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What part of the school did the shooting happen in?
 
BARNES:  Say again.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I said what part of the school did the shooting happen in?
 
BARNES:  It happened in near -- so, the school is obviously segregated into sections. I'm told that it happened at a pair of time when the transition 
 
 was complete. Students were where they're supposed to be, near classrooms in the hallway. I did not again go into the school. So, I don't know the 
 
 exact nomenclature of where it happened, but it happened in the learning part of the school. So, once -- 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (INAUDIBLE) speak to that, maybe just specifics of the layout of the school.
 
BARNES:  Yes, because we're still investigating. We'll just leave it at that. Thanks.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All right. Sarah from WPR.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You mentioned that the school has a partnership with the Office of School Safety with the Wisconsin Attorney General's Office. 
 
 Did police have access to blueprints of the school as a result of that partnership and how did that result in police response?
 
BARNES:  Do you want to speak to that?
 
WIERS:  We that on the (INAUDIBLE). I don't know what the police did.
 
BARNES:  OK. Do you want to -- OK.
 <br>[18:55:00]
 
WIERS:  So, I can speak to the blueprints and the maps. We do have those uploaded as part of our reporting to the Department of Justice and the 
 
 Office of School Safety. How they were used, I don't know. I do know that the police were going through and they were working with staff to secure 
 
 the different areas and that they did have maps. So, what -- whether those are the blueprint maps or what they were using, that I can't speak to, but 
 
 I do know that they did have maps.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Just to clarify, when you said visual scans, is that sort of like looking at the student up and down, or is that going through a 
 
 scanner regardless?
 
WIERS:  It's a visual scan where we look at the student to see if there's anything unique or unusual in them.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All right. Ken from WKPP.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Sure. If I could get Barbara back real quick, I'm so sorry. I don't know if you had a ton of conversations with parents or staff 
 
 members today, but what is the prevailing thought or message that they wanted to impart to you and the administration?
 
WIERS:  Sure. I've had the opportunity to speak to the parents at the reunification site a couple of different times. The families that I did 
 
 speak to mostly were, as you would expect, at Abundant Life, they were supportive, they were amazingly patient and kind, they were offering 
 
 repeatedly, we're praying for you, we're praying for our family, because at ALCS we are -- we call ourselves the Challenger family. We see ourselves as 
 
 a family, not just a community. And whether their child was affected by this or not, they were affected by it because what affects one part of the 
 
 body affects all as we know, the bible says. And so, we hold that dear.
 
We also have a very strong faith in our community that in spite of tragedy, God is working and we believe that God is good in everything and that he 
 
 turns beauty for ashes. And so, I had a number of families who mentioned that to me, that this wasn't a surprise to God and that he's going to do 
 
 something mighty with it. And so, we're holding on to those words and we're continuing to believe and trust in him.
 
He is our foundation at Abundant Life Christian School. We are -- we exist to bring and to build disciples of Jesus Christ. And so, we have complete 
 
 faith that he will carry us through this.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All right. (INAUDIBLE).
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I have another question for Barbara. Sorry to bring you back up.
 
WIERS:  Yes, that's fine.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  So, what details can you share about what students were actually doing before the shooting started, the environment, what 
 
 their morning looked like (INAUDIBLE)?
 
WIERS:  So, some of this is part of the investigation. So, I think there's limited things that I can say at this time. Once the investigation is 
 
 complete, obviously there will be more that will be shared. We certainly don't want to say anything that would impede MPD. That would be critical. 
 
 So, I will actually step aside and let Chief Barnes speak to that because he is the lead for that.
 
BARNES:  Yes, I don't have anything to add. We're certainly working to get as much information as we can. We'll do another fourth, I think, press 
 
 conference today, later on today. I think at 8:30. And so, hopefully, we will have a little more information for you.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  OK. Didi (ph) with PBS in Stanford.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Chief Barnes, were there other search warrants executed today in addition to the house on the north side?
 
BARNES:  I'm not aware of any.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All right. Carl from NBC 26?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes. I have a question for Barbara. Was the shooter at school at the beginning of the day or was there a forceful entry later in 
 
 the day?
 
BARNES:  We believe that -- 
 
WIERS:  I believe that's a good question.
 
BARNES:  Yes, we believe that the shooter was at school. We have no information that there was some type of breach to the school.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  OK. Janet from WMTV.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  (INAUDIBLE).
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes, sorry.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  OK. That's OK. Question for you, Barbara, if you don't mind? Can you just talk about -- chief earlier mentioned how teachers 
 
 and employees and staff really follow the protocols that you guys have practiced in place. I know that this is an emotional event, obviously for 
 
 students, but those teachers really take it to heart when they are sitting there protecting those little ones at the school. Can you talk a little bit 
 
 about what they did right in this situation? Obviously, this is tragic, but unfortunately, we've seen school shootings play out that are far worse than 
 
 what we saw today.
 
WIERS:  So, it's timely that just prior to the start of the school year, we had a retraining. We train on this. We do lockdown drills. We do evacuation 
 
 drills as part of our standard drill protocols. Our students are versed in that, our faculty are well versed in that. The training that we did with 
 
 MPD at the very beginning of the year, prior to the students returning to campus had some new updates. And so, we had looked at some of those things. 
 
 So, I think everything was very fresh for our faculty.
 
We follow the protocol of always keeping our school doors locked. And so, that is one of the things that makes it quick and easy to secure a room. I 
 
 was actually teaching at the time. And so, following those protocols, as a teacher would do --
