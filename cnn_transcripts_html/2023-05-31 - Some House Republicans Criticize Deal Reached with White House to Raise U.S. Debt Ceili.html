WILLIAM TONG, (D) CONNECTICUT ATTORNEY GENERAL:  And I totally agree with her.
 
ERICA HILL, CNN ANCHOR:  Attorney General William Tong, DeDe Yoder, thank you both for being with us this morning, really appreciate it.
 
DEDE YODER, MOTHER OF OPIOID CRISIS VICTIM:  Thank you so much.
 
HILL:  CNN THIS MORNING continues right now.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. CHIP ROY, (R-TX) RULES COMMITTEE:  Not one Republican should vote for this deal. It is a bad deal. 
 
REP. RALPH NORMAN, (R-SC) RULES COMMITTEE:  McCarthy has lost some trust in how this has been handled. 
 
REP. DAN BISHOP, (R-NC):  It seems inescapable to me given what has occurred and the way he was the steward of Republican unity, and he blew it to smithereens. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR:  Well, not everyone happy with this deal. Let's see how the vote goes. 
 
HILL:  Yes. 
 
HARLOW:  Good morning, everyone. We are glad you are with us on CNN THIS MORNING. I'm joined by my friend Erica Hill. And here's where we are. Kevin McCarthy, the Speaker, facing a growing Republican revolt as the House prepares to vote on his debt limit deal that he struck with President Biden. We are about to find out if the speaker can pull it off. 
 
HILL:  New video shows a Chinese fighter jet intercepting a U.S. spy plane. The Pentagon accusing the Chinese pilot of being unnecessarily aggressive, forcing the American plane to fly through dangerous turbulence. We're going to ask the White House about it. HARLOW:  Also breaking this morning, sources tell CNN former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is going to jump in the race for the White House. He will make it official with an announcement on Tuesday, giving Donald Trump yet another Republican challenger. 
 
This hour of CNN THIS MORNING starts right now. 
 
And we do begin on the debt limit and the deal, and can it pass. It is a crucial day. We'll see on Capitol Hill. The House is set to finally vote on it after it narrowly cleared a major hurdle last night. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Mr. Norman? Mr. Norman, no. Mr. Roy? Mr. Roy, no. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HILL:  Two hardline Republicans on the very powerful House Rules Committee tried but failed to block the deal from advancing to the floor. They are vowing to continue fighting against it along with other members of the House Freedom Caucus. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. CHIP ROY, (R-TX):  Because Joe Biden was in a box. He was up against the ropes. And we should have held him there and gotten more for the American people than a spending freeze for $4 trillion. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HILL:  Speaker McCarthy walking a tightrope this morning, trying to rally, of course, support for that bill as he's facing growing dissent among far right Republicans, and that looming threat of being ousted from his job. Time is quickly running out for Congress to prevent a potential default that could tank the economy. 
 
Joining us now is the man who is tasked with convincing those Republicans to fall in line to vote for his bill, Congressman Tom Emmer from Minnesota is the majority whip in the House. Sir, good to have you with us this morning. The big question, which I know you are getting, is where things stand. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise saying last night despite all this harsh criticism from the party, the caucus is coming together around the legislation. So this morning, do you agree? Do you have the votes? 
 
REP. TOM EMMER, (R-MN):  Oh, yes, it's going to pass today. A lot of this is fun for the media and people who like to watch human beings have disagreements. But at the end of the day, the House Republicans know what's at stake. That's one of the reasons that Kevin McCarthy tried to get this done starting the moment this new Congress began. It's one of the reasons that under his leadership Republicans passed a bill to avoid default more than a month ago. And it took the president, the White House more than 100 days to actually sit down and start getting serious. This is a great deal for Republicans. This is a $2.1 trillion cut. This is a major victory for Republicans, and we'll pass it. 
 
HILL:  So you are calling this a major victory for Republicans. The president has been very complimentary about it as well. Give us a sense -- you're confident it will pass. Can you give us a sense of the numbers this morning? Can you get as high as 150? 
 
EMMER:  We whipped for 218 Republicans. That will be our goal, to get 218 plus on the Republican side of the aisle to vote for the deal tonight. 
 
HILL:  In terms of where things stand, as you know, the criticism has been loud. It has been consistent from some of the more hardline members of your party. I just want to share some of those moments that we've been hearing with our viewers, because I want to get your take on some of this. If the bill passes, as we know, this doesn't mean it's the end of the problems potentially for Speaker McCarthy. You have Dan Bishop saying he would consider this motion to vacate, saying that the speaker made, in his words, an unrecoverable error. Chip Roy spoke in confirming to CNN that if this deal can't be killed that they are going to have to reassess and maybe take a look at the leadership arrangement. Do you believe that the speaker's job at this point, that the gavel is in jeopardy? 
 <br>[08:05:00]
 
EMMER:  Look, I know that those Republican members are great members. The group of Republicans, there is a lot of emotion because there is a lot of frustration. I mean, they are watching an administration that has driven spending to a level that's caused double-digit inflation. People are paying more at the grocery store, more at the gas pump. It's just harder to get by. And these people want to get something done for the American people. 
 
I understand that they didn't get everything they wanted in this deal, but this is a good deal. It's with $2.1 trillion cut. It has a permitting reform in it. It actually has a provision in it that's going to force the Senate, for once, to start working on appropriations bills. This is a good first step forward to try to fix what's been broken in Congress. 
 
HILL:  You're calling this a good first step forward, what's been broken in Congress. There's been a lot made about the fact that, look, if you have unhappy people on both sides, perhaps that is a sign of an actual negotiate, some bipartisan work up there -- down there, rather, I should say, in Washington. When you hear words, though, like "unrecoverable error" from Congressman Bishop, I found it interesting. Douglas Brinkley telling "The Washington Post," both sides blinked. This is what American politics is all about. Do you believe the error that he is referring to was a negotiation, was both sides coming together and each one having to give a little bit? 
 
EMMER:  No, I think from Dan's perspective, he is a thoughtful guy and he works very hard at these issues. He wanted more. He wanted more in the deal. He wanted some things that dropped out, some additional work requirements. He wanted some additional things when it came to spending cuts. I understand that. But at the end of the day, this deal had Republican priorities in it because, of course, the only people that passed a bill were the Republicans. It is a good thing that the White House did finally decide to sit down and have a negotiation. 
 
At the end of the day, this is a $2.1 trillion cut. It is the first step. The next step is going to be the appropriations process. And then of course there is an election next year, where I think the issue will be how Republicans would spend your money versus how Democrats would, and our national security. That's a winning issue for us. 
 
HILL:  You talk about cut, estimates from the Congressional Budget Office. There is also an estimate that changes to SNAP would actually increase spending by $2.1 billion. Are you concerned about that? 
 
EMMER:  That came out last night. The math is wrong. 
 
HILL:  You say the math is flat out wrong? 
 
EMMER:  We need to see their homework on this, because -- 
 
HILL:  But you are OK with the other part of that equation, you just -- but the SNAP part is wrong? 
 
EMMER:  Actually, what came out last night, if you let me finish, is there are some inconsistencies with their calculations and what they are including and not including. In fact, they are pricing in things that are already happening. So this is a little bit -- we have had a problem every once in a while with the CBO. For instance, there was a motion, a vote to eliminate the Department of Education. You're eliminating a 4,000-person department, and they said that would cost the federal government money. We don't just accept what the CBO puts out. We do check their homework. 
 
So I am comfortable with the other stuff. The one that came out last night, there are some suspect numbers in there. 
 
HILL:  So when do you think you will have those checked? 
 
EMMER:  We'll be doing it this morning. It just came out last night. 
 
HILL:  OK, we look forward to hearing more on that. And are you feeling confident in terms of -- I know you said you have the numbers, you will have the votes. Can you give us a sense of who you may have been able to bring over to your side? We saw comments specifically from Marjorie Taylor Greene. I won't use her words, but she called it a certain type of sandwich. She seems to be now leaning yes. How many others have you been able to convince? 
 
EMMER:  All I am going to tell you is that we do our job, we make sure that we hear our members' concerns, we share with them the accurate details of what is in this legislation so that they can make up their own mind and represent the people that they were sent here to represent. We are going to have the votes tonight. This will pass. 
 
HILL:  Congressman Tom Emmer, appreciate your time this morning. Thank you. 
 
EMMER:  Thank you.
 
HARLOW:  Now to Ukraine. Ukraine is on edge this morning as it braces for potential Russian retaliation to a drone strike, those attacks in Moscow on Tuesday. Ukraine has denied any involvement in those attacks. Of course, the Kremlin is pointing right at Ukraine, and the White House says it is still gathering information. These followed an overnight bombardment on the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, which was the night before. Those killed at least one person. 
 
Take a look at this video. Look at that. It's new just into CNN, and it shows missile debris falling from the sky and nearly hitting a bus in Kyiv. Meantime, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he has landed on a date. He's decided when they will launch the counteroffensive, but he hasn't made that date public. 
 <br>[08:10:05]
 
Let's talk about this and a lot of headlines this morning. We're happy to be joined by the National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications at the White House, John Kirby. Good morning. 
 
JOHN KIRBY, NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL COORDINATOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS:  Good morning. 
 
HARLOW: OK, so the latest we had from last night is that the White House is still gathering information on these attacks in Russia, these drone attacks on Moscow. Ukraine vehemently denying any involvement. Does the White House have an update on that this morning? 
 
KIRBY:  No, Poppy, we don't. We are still trying to get information here and develop some sort of sense of what happened and how these occurred. But I can't tell you we have definitive information at this point.
 
HARLOW:  OK, let me ask you then, would the White House view it as appropriate if Ukraine was involved in those attacks? 
 
KIRBY:  We have been clear privately and publicly with the Ukrainians that we don't support attacks on Russian soil. We are going to continue to give them what they need to defend themselves and defend their territory, Ukrainian soil, but we don't support attacks in Russia. 
 
HILL:  In terms of those potential attacks, Poppy and I spoke earlier with former Secretary Mark Esper. We asked him specifically about, depending on whether it was determined that Ukraine was behind them and where some of that equipment may have come from, whether that should change the thinking for U.S. and NATO in terms of weapons. Take a listen to his response. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MARK ESPER, FORMER DEFENSE SECRETARY:  Well, Ukraine has the right of self-defense, and, secondly, Russia should not have sanctuary. Russia doesn't get to destroy, kill civilians, rape, murder, and pillage all across Ukraine now for 15 months and then cry foul when Ukraine or Ukraine supported, or maybe it's anti-Putin groups, shoot drones in Moscow. I just think that's wrong, that's not right. And I think Ukraine needs to leverage whatever it can with whomever they can at this point to strike legitimate military targets in Russia. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HILL:  Ukraine needs to leverage to strike legitimate military targets in Russia. In his estimation, Ukraine has the right of self-defense. The White House doesn't agree? 
 
KIRBY:  Of course, we agree that the Ukrainians have right to self- defense. My goodness. Over the last 15 months we have been doing very little else other than helping them defend themselves and defend their territory against this Russian aggression. 
 
What we have said is we don't want to encourage or enable attacks inside Russia, because we don't want to see the war escalate beyond the violence it's already visited upon the Ukrainian people. I think anybody can understand why we would be concerned about this war expanding into something much bigger than what it already is. And so we have maintained our concerns about attack son Russian soil. 
 
But we have nothing but generous and fully committed to making sure Ukraine can defend itself. In fact, Poppy, you are going to continue to see drawdown packages and security assistance going to Ukraine right up through the summertime, and that includes in the very near future here. So we are very much committed to that. 
 
HARLOW:  I'm joined by my colleague Erica Hill. I know you can't see us both here, but we are right here. That smart question was from Erica and her questioning of Mark Esper. 
 
Let me ask you this, though, just building on this, then we do want to move on to China with you, but it appears that, and this is how "The New York Times" describes it this morning on the front page, that this position that White House has held that any weapons provided to Ukraine should not be used to strike Russia. But "The Times" points to the fact that -- here's what they write, "The State Department and National Security Council both issued statements saying that the United States does not support strikes inside Russia, quote, as a general matter, but nothing that marked nothing -- on Tuesday marked the 17th time this month that Russia struck Kyiv," meaning they think that your language is hedging a bit. Is the White House's position changing at all? 
 
KIRBY:  No, not at all. I apologize, Erica, for the mistake there. But no, not at all. Look, we have been very consistent since the beginning of the war. We want to make sure that Ukraine has everything they need to defend themselves as they get ready to go on the offensive here in the summertime. We want to make sure they have everything they need to do that successfully. But we don't want to see this war escalate beyond what it's already visited, again, on the Ukrainian people and the European continent. I think we can all understand that if we give Putin what he is claiming this is, a war against the west, a war against the United States, a war against NATO, there is going to be a lot more suffering across the European continent. So we don't want to see this war escalate. 
 
Now, look, once we provide systems to the Ukrainians, and this is an important point, they get to decide what they are going to do with them. They have given us assurances that they won't use our equipment to strike inside Russia. But once it goes to them, it belongs to them, and that's why -- 
 
HARLOW:  That sounds like a hedge. Respectfully, that sounds like a hedge. 
 
KIRBY:  No, it's not. It's not a hedge. It's been very consistent since the beginning of the war. This equipment belongs to them. They to get to decide how they use it. We don't want them, and we have been -- we have been clear privately with them and we certainly have been clear publicly, we don't want our systems, we don't want to encourage or enable the attacks inside Russia. 
 
 [08:15:00]
 
HILL: All right, President Zelenskyy has said that there is a date now he has a date for this counter offensive. Do you have any sense of that timing?
 
KIRBY: I think we're just going to leave it right there. And this is President Zelenskyy's decision to make. He's the Commander in Chief, he gets to decide where and when he steps off. And we don't want to get ahead of him on that.
 
HARLOW: But does the White House know even if you're not saying it publicly?
 
KIRBY: We have been in touch with our Ukrainian counterparts, as they have begun their planning for this counter offensive. And we remain in touch with them. I think I'll just leave it at that.
 
HARLOW: OK. We want to ask you about China before you go, because we saw this week that basically U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's counterpart in China, declined an invitation to sit down with him at the Security Forum in Singapore, that happened a few days ago. And then, now, we see Xi Jinping overnight, saying that, basically, his military chiefs should prepare for, quote, "The worst-case scenarios and prepare for actual combat and practical use." That sounds like a real escalation.
 
KIRBY: Well, that's one of the reasons why we want to be able to have conversations on the military channels with the senior leaders of the PRC military as well as at lower levels. I mean, when Speaker Pelosi visited Taiwan, one of the avenues of communication that the Chinese cut off was this military-to-military vehicle here. And that is what you need when you have tensions as high as they are. You want to be able to avoid miscalculations and misunderstandings just over the weekend. There was an unsafe and unprofessional intercept by PRC fighter jet with one of our Air Force aircraft over the South China Sea. When you have tensions like this, you want to make sure you can talk, that's why we want to keep the lines of communication open.
 
HARLOW: Not very open right now. I think that's clearly concerning to a lot of people.
 
KIRBY: No.
 
HARLOW: Yes.
 
HILL: Go ahead.
 
KIRBY: They're concerning -- they're concerning -- they're concerning to us, too.
 
HARLOW: Yes.
 
KIRBY: We agree, they're not open and they and we need to get them open. And that's why Secretary Austin asked for that meeting.
 
HARLOW: No question about it. Really appreciate your time, Admiral Kirby, thank you very much for joining us this morning.
 
KIRBY: You bet. Thanks, guys.
 
HARLOW: OK.
 
HILL: Well, battle is escalating between House Republicans and the Director of the FBI. Speaker Kevin McCarthy, even threatening to hold Director Wray in contempt. Former FBI Director James Comey is here to discuss.
 
HARLOW: And this just into CNN the 2024 Republican presidential fields getting even more crowded already. Guess who's jumping in, former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie about to make it official on Tuesday.
 <br>[08:20:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): We have jurisdiction over the FBI which they seem to act like we do not. I personally called Director Wray and told him he needs to send that document. If he misses the deadline today, I am prepared to move contempt charges in Congress against him.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARLOW: Well, he did miss that deadline and you just heard from House Speaker Kevin McCarthy yesterday on that. Republicans in Congress are escalating their fight with FBI Director Christopher Wray as he refuses to hand over an internal document. They say relates to an alleged scheme involving President Biden. Hours after Speaker McCarthy issued that threat on Fox, the House Oversight Chair James Comer said he will take direct steps now to hold Director Wray in contempt.
 
This contest, Republicans continue their attacks on the FBI and the DOJ. Some House Republicans seeking to defund those agencies alleging they've been weaponized against conservatives. And newly minted presidential hopeful Governor Ron DeSantis has pledged to fire the FBI Director if he were to become president. What does this all mean for not only the FBI but the country? Joining us now in studio is former FBI Director James Comey. He's the author of this new book that you will see between us, the new crime novel, Central Park West. Good morning, Director.
 
JAMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR: Good morning.
 
HARLOW: Congratulations.
 
COMEY: Thanks, thanks for having me.
 
HARLOW: We'll get to the book in a moment it's thrilling, keeps you on the edge of your seat. But I have to ask you first to respond to what we just heard from Kevin McCarthy and what the Oversight Chair James Comer. And I should note, Chuck Grassley, Senator Chuck Grassley will do in terms of holding Director Wray in contempt. Should he be turning over this internal document?
 
COMEY: I don't know enough about the particular document to say but.
 
HARLOW: Well, it's the document, you know, what it is. It's got many numbers in it, but it essentially outlines what an undisclosed witness or whistleblower told officials. And this would concern the Biden family, these accusations that have not been presented with evidence, but from the Oversight Committee, the accusations they've made.
 
COMEY: Director Wray is a person of principle. And so, I'm sure he's trying to ascertain what's the right thing to do consistent with Department of Justice Policy and tradition. And these are the kinds of kerfuffle that blow up every so often in D.C. now, it's ensnared the FBI, it'll pass.
 
HARLOW: It'll pass. Governor Ron DeSantis, as you know, he's running for president. I was struck by what he said about the FBI in his interview, he did with Fox News on the night of his announcement. He said this wasn't surprising, he said the DOJ and FBI have lost their way. He said they're very partisan. But what was striking to me is what he said about the independence of the FBI or the lack thereof, here it was.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): Republican presidents have accepted the canard that the DOJ and FBI are quote, independent. They are not independent agencies. They are part of the executive branch. They answer to the elected President of the United States. So, as president, you have a responsibility to be involved and holding those agencies accountable.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARLOW: Historically, previously, until the last few years, it has largely been those on the left who have been critical of the FBI. You were a Republican, for most of your life until you say the party left you. Why do you think so many Republicans have turned on the FBI? COMEY: I think it's largely because Donald Trump and those around him have seen the FBI as a threat and so, they've taken a blowtorch to try and tear down that threat. It's really unfortunate, the notion that the FBI is some sort of leftist cabal out to get the Republicans is so crazy. It just shows you how crazy our times are.
 
HARLOW: Take a look. I thought that these numbers were really stunning. First of all, there's a Pew Research Poll that shows just the divide in terms of Republicans and leaning Republicans. Only 38 percent, now, have a favorable view of the FBI for Democrats at 65 percent. And then, you talk about Trump, look at this the cline. Gallup showed that in 2014 62 percent of Republicans had a favorable view of the agency. Now, it's 29 percent. What can be done to correct that, and what if it doesn't change? What happens?
 
COMEY: Well, it will change. The FBI will be fine in the long run this fever around Donald Trump in the MAGA world will eventually break. But it's become somehow, a nutty article of faith that the FBI is out to get Republicans. If you'd ask people 20 years ago whether that would someday be the accusation, they'd say that's nuts. It's nuts, but it will pass. 
 <br>[08:25:11] 
 
HARLOW: So, John Durham released his report a year's long report just days ago. And he will testify before the House Judiciary Committee on June 21st, that's three weeks from today. This was about under your purview that the Trump probe vis-a-vis Russia during the 2016 election. His analysist and it's different than the Inspector General's analysis, by the way. But his conclusion was the FBI never should have launched a full probe of Trump and Russia. And he said that the FBI use raw and analyzed and uncooperative intelligence and essentially a different standard than they used with Hillary Clinton. Do you have any regrets about how you and the team handled that investigation?
 
COMEY: No. And there's --
 
HARLOW: None.
 
COMEY: -- nothing new in his report about the FBI. He thinks it ought to have been a prelim investigation not a full on the differences would be boring to your listeners and your viewers. He agrees that the FBI had to examine this and open an investigation.
 
HARLOW: But not to the extent it did. And he says that there were different standards used in terms of the probe on Trump and Russia and Hillary Clinton.
 
COMEY: Yes.
 
HARLOW: You said on a different network, in a recent interview that there are some things you wish you did differently. What are they?
 
COMEY: Oh, plenty of different things. Some small things to large things. In announcements I made I don't like the way in which I put things in order. I wish I had entered the encryption debate in a different way. When you look back at a career, you can always find things, but I think the FBI had to open that Russia investigation. People forget Republicans. We weren't investigating Donald Trump. We were trying to find out if anybody in his world is working with the Russians, had to do that investigation and did it in a professional way.
 
HARLOW: What we see now, looking at the Trump probes now, specifically the two federal ones led by the Special Counsel, Jack Smith. Do you expect that the special counsel will recommend charges in either probe view talked about the Mar-a-Lago documents cases potentially being the most damaging to Trump? Do you expect Jack Smith would recommend charges to the Attorney General?
 
COMEY: I don't know. He's been doing it like a pro, which means I know very little about it, as to you. And so, I don't know, it strikes me the Mar-a-Lago case is the one most likely to result in criminal charges. But we'll have to see.
 
HARLOW: Well, we know very little about it. But some good reporting has told us a bit about it, including The Washington Post last week, as you know, with their reporting that boxes of the classified documents removed on June 2nd. The day before they knew that FBI officials were coming down to look at the documents. Does that point to obstruction?
 
COMEY: Maybe.
 
HARLOW: Maybe.
 
COMEY: I know from having been inside investigations that as good as the reporting is it can't see what a professional investigation is doing fully. And so, we'll just have to wait.
 
HARLOW: The Washington Post profile of you in this book was really, really interesting. And this is what they wrote at the end of one of their multiple reviews of your book, quote, it seems like everyone in America has been angry with him. You, at some point, for his decisions about what to reveal and when. And you've said getting fired is the best thing that ever happened to me. Why?
 
COMEY: Oh, to me personally?
 
HARLOW: Yes.
 
COMEY: Because I get to dress in a different way. I get lots of sleep and exercise. Spent time with my grandchildren.
 
HARLOW: But you had a tenure time. You only got to serve four years.
 
COMEY: Oh, yes, I agree with not having the opportunity to stay with my full term at the FBI. I think I was answering a question about me personally.
 
HARLOW: OK.
 
COMEY: It's harder to be FBI Director than to be a crime fiction novelist.
 
HARLOW: What do you make of what The Washington Post wrote that every American has been angry with you at some point for different reasons?
 
COMEY: Yes. I, frankly, hope it's not fully true, but I've heard a lot of it, and it causes me pain.
 
HARLOW: It does.
 
COMEY: I wasn't in that business to try and piss people off. But sometimes when you're making decisions, especially in a polarized environment, you can't help but get people upset at you as Chris Wray, the current director is discovering. He'll be OK in the long run. Someday, he'll be dressed in casual clothes, and getting a lot of sleep.
 
HARLOW: I told you when I was coming to set now, we're going to talk about the book that I never thought I would speak with you and in a T- shirt and sneakers, so much more relaxed life now. And the life you see ahead for yourself as a novelist, this book you've always loved to write. You contributed to your school's literary magazine. So, this has sort of been in your blood for a long time. But the plot of this book, which I said is riveting, is a federal prosecutor here in New York and she is a girl maybe slightly based, a woman based on your own daughter who is a federal prosecutor. But this is a mob case and then, it's tied with New York City politics in it and in New York Governor. How much of this story is inspired by your work prosecuting the mob and what your daughter is doing?
 
COMEY: It's a combination. A lot of it is places I've been cases I did when I was a mob prosecutor. But when I was working on this, my oldest child, my daughter, was on her feet in the same courtroom I prosecuted mobsters in when she was four years old. Prosecuting Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein's partner and abusing young girls. And so, it had to be a woman as the protagonist. And so, I could write it, not thinking about me but thinking about this person I love tremendously like all my children. So, that made it really fun.
 
HARLOW: A lot of women have been a part of this book, not only your daughter, but as I understand that your wife is your biggest.
