(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN ANCHOR: Closing arguments underway by the defense in the federal gun trial of Hunter Biden, but not before Hunter Biden's attorney decided not to put the president's son on the stand. We're live outside court with the latest.
 
BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN ANCHOR: Plus, former President Trump set to give remarks this hour. And shortly after that, he's going to be meeting with his probation officer. That is ahead of his sentencing next month. We have new details on the meeting and what it could mean for his conviction and his run for the White House. And some positive new results from a combo COVID and flu vaccine, a first of its kind. So when? When is it going to become available? We're following these major developing stories and many more all coming in right here to CNN News Central.
 
KEILAR: Right now, Hunter Biden's defense team is presenting their closing arguments to jurors and accusing prosecutors of trying to dupe the jury. The president's son faces three felony counts of illegally purchasing and possessing a gun in 2018 while abusing or being addicted to drugs. Biden has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Last hour, prosecutors walked jurors through evidence that they say proves Hunter Biden habitually used illegal drugs around the time that he bought that gun. Among that evidence, text messages between Biden and drug dealers to set up purchases of crack cocaine. CNN's Paula Reid is joining us now from outside of the courthouse. Paula, what's the latest?
 
PAULA REID, CNN CHIEF LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: We know right now Abby Lowell, Hunter's lead defense attorney, is likely wrapping up his closing statement. The source suggested to me that he would go for about an hour. And he's been in there for about 15 minutes right now, making his final pitch to jurors about why they should not convict his client. He's really focusing in on the fact that there is no direct evidence that his client was using or addicted to drugs during that time that he owned this gun. He's even compared prosecutors to magicians doing some sort of trick in front of the jury. But before he was up, of course, prosecutors went and they reminded the jury of a theme that we heard for quite a while in New York during the Trump trial as well. And that is, quote, no one is above the law. They also directly addressed a key issue here, which is whether Hunter Biden knowingly lied on the form. This is one of the most difficult things that they need to prove.
 
And they insist, quote, Hunter Biden knew he used crack at the time he bought the gun in question. And they said, look, maybe if he hadn't just been to rehab, we could buy the idea that he wasn't aware that he had a problem. But prosecutors are like, look, he clearly knew he had a problem. And they believe the evidence that they have presented strongly suggests or suggests beyond a reasonable doubt that he was aware that he was using or addicted to drugs at the time he bought this gun. Now interestingly, at the end of their closing statement, prosecutors went back to testimony from Hunter's daughter, Naomi, on Friday. 
 
And they said, look, remember, she testified that on October 19th, when she returned her father's car, she saw no evidence of drugs. But just four days later, Hallie Biden, Hunter Biden's sister in law and a girlfriend for a time. She testified that when she found the gun in that car four days later, she found it alongside drugs and drug paraphernalia.
 
Prosecutors clearly believing that is some of the most effective evidence that they have put before the jury. Now, Abby Lowell should be wrapping up soon. The judge said we were in court earlier. She has a few more instructions she wants to give the jury. And then this decision will be in the hands of these 12 jurors. So it is possible we could get a verdict today. But you just never know how long it's going to take a jury to reach a decision.
 
KEILAR: Yeah, you never do. Paula will be waiting along with you. Thank you for that. Boris.
 
SANCHEZ: Today, former President Donald Trump is making a virtual appearance on the campaign trail at a conservative Christian event in Indianapolis. He's also set to attend a pre-sentencing interview with a probation officer. An outcome of a New York jury finding him guilty on 34 felony counts from 10 days ago. CNN national correspondent Kristen Holmes is tracking it all for us. So, Kristen, tell us about this interview and what it entails.
 
KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: OK, so there is nothing normal at all about the fact that a former president is sitting down with a probation officer. That being said, this is a totally normal procedure and routine procedure for somebody who has been convicted of multiple felonies. This is part of the sentencing procedure. He is going to sit down for this virtual interview with a probation officer who is based in New York. Donald Trump will be down in Mar-a-Lago with his lawyer, Todd Blanche. 
 <br>[14:05:09]
 
And essentially this will all go into a report that this probation officer makes and gives to Judge Juan Merchan before that sentencing that could impact the outcome of what that punishment is. Because remember, Juan Merchan is the one who is going to eventually be making that sentencing announcement. 
 
SANCHEZ: Yeah, it's not an obligatory thing that Trump has to appear for. So you have to imagine that his desire to actually show up may have something to do with what you just pointed out. He's actually going to be speaking at the Danbury Institute Life and Liberty Forum in just a few moments in the next hour or so. This is an organization that is very, very restrictionist when it comes to abortion policy. Give us a preview of his message.
 
HOLMES: Yeah, not just restrictive. I mean, they've called for the full eradication of abortion, something that Donald Trump himself has not called for. Now, what we are told is that this is a brief introductory remarks. It is less than two minutes. And he does not use the word abortion. There is a reason why this is significant. He is obviously speaking to this group whose core messaging says they're not going to stop until abortion is eradicated completely. 
 
Instead, he's going to be talking about religious freedom, the First Amendment, not about abortion. This just goes to show you how sensitive this issue is for Donald Trump and the line that he continues to try and walk. He doesn't necessarily want to be talking about abortion. Now, that being said, he wants to fully take credit for the overturning of Roe v. Wade, which is why you see him talking about that, saying he appointed these three great justices that were part of the decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. But yet, when it comes to actual abortion policy, tries not to talk about it because he believes it's deeply unpopular. 
 
SANCHEZ: Yeah.
 
HOLMES: So this is another example of that. Him going in there, we have a lot of speculation. OK, he's speaking to this group, but yet he's not mentioning abortion at all.
 
SANCHEZ: Yeah, that's odd. It's a fine line in courting those evangelical voters while not alienating women as well. Kristen Holmes, thanks so much for reporting. Brianna.
 
KEILAR: All right. Let's talk about all of this now with CNN special correspondent Jamie Gangel. And Jamie, we have these two high profile trials that we are watching, the Trump trial, now the Hunter Biden trial. Talk about how these two are being handled very differently.
 
JAIMIE GANGEL, CNN SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, obviously, Trump handled his trial like a campaign, right? He was out making speeches every day. The Biden campaign is handling this as a personal family matter. Very painful. Of course, when you're the son of the president, nothing is is just personal. But you do see one thing that's very different. You see a lot of Biden family members in there every day. His wife is in there. First Lady Jill Biden has been there, I think, every day except one day. But it's just completely different in in those two ways.
 
KEILAR: You see them in the witness stand, too. His, you know, family members or, the in-laws--
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
GANGEL: Right.
 
KEILAR:-even the witnesses who are considered the witness for the prosecution. Still, in a way, you get a sense that there's an affinity for Hunter Biden, which is very different. Also, Hunter Biden, he's not running for president, right? As much as Republicans want this to rub off on Joe Biden. 
 
GANGEL: So there are a whole list of nots that I go through. He is not a candidate for president. He is not making speeches every day at the end of the trial day coming out, he is not calling the judge corrupt. He is not saying that the system is rigged or a witch hunt. 
 
In fact, when you think about it, the president's son is really an example of the rule of law, the justice system working. And it goes so far as to say that President Biden has already said ahead of time that if convicted, he will not pardon his son.
 
KEILAR: I've heard some Republicans say, yes, but will he commute the sentence if there's a sentence? I've heard Republicans raise questions about that, even though it seemed the president was pretty straightforward about what he was saying there. Looking, though, at the bigger picture here, what's the possible impact on Biden voters, Joe Biden voters, if Hunter Biden is convicted?
 
GANGEL: So I think we really don't know. This is sort of like Donald Trump. We see these polls like after the conviction, it goes up a couple of points, goes down a couple of points, you know, for  Trump. And I think we really don't know. The polls are one thing. They are consistent. They have been consistently close. But when you look at those numbers, which I can't quite see from here, but I can tell--
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
KEILAR: I have them right here.
 
GANGEL: You have them right here.
 
KEILAR: I too, have a hard time seeing them.
 
GANGEL: So, you know, it's within. In one point, two points, three points, four points. We are five months away. We still have Donald Trump sentencing. We have our the presidential debate on CNN, June 27th. We have the conventions coming up. 
 <br>[14:10:09]
 
I think that all this is saying is it's still very close.
 
KEILAR: Yeah. We'll see if those other things move the needle. 
 
GANGEL: Correct. 
 
KEILAR: Maybe they will. 
 
GANGEL: Correct. 
 
KEILAR: We'll see. Jamie, always great to have you. Thank you so much. And still ahead, Secretary of State Antony Blinken back in the Middle East. He is meeting with Israel's prime minister. This is after a high-profile resignation from Netanyahu's war cabinet and also that dramatic and very deadly hostage rescue operation in Gaza over the weekend. Plus, federal authorities warning that a ruthless criminal gang from Venezuela has now infiltrated the U.S., where it's being linked to a string of brutal and violent crimes. And Moderna says it has breakthrough results from its new trial of a combined COVID flu vaccine. When that could be available.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:15:09] 
 
KEILAR: This just in, the doctor in charge of medical treatment for the four Israeli hostages who were rescued Saturday in Gaza tells CNN that the hostages were beaten almost every day while in Hamas captivity in Gaza. At least one IDF officer died during the raids while scores of Palestinians were killed, including women and children, and many more were injured in the deadly operation. 
 
Also happening moments ago, Secretary of State Antony Blinken wrapped up a high-stakes meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, where he told him the world, quote, will stand behind the ceasefire and hostage proposal. It's all part of a series of stops in the Middle East where Blinken is pushing Hamas to agree to President Biden's proposal to end the war in Gaza, which he described, of course, as a proposal by Israel. CNN's Kylie Atwood is in Tel Aviv for us. Kylie, walk us through what you know about Blinken's visit.
 
KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Yes, so he's here in Israel. He just wrapped that meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. It lasted for almost two hours. And as you said, one of his key messages, according to the readout from State Department spokesperson, is that he told Netanyahu, he reiterated that the U.S. and other world leaders stand by that comprehensive deal, that comprehensive proposal that President Biden laid out about 10 days ago, which U.S. officials have said Israel put on the table for Hamas. He also notably underscored the importance of preventing this conflict from spreading, that's key because we have seen the tension between Israel along that northern border with Lebanon grow in recent weeks. And he said the comprehensive proposal that is on the table would, quote, unlock the possibility of calm along that border.
 
Now, coming into these meetings here in Israel today, the secretary had two main messages, the first of which is that he believes this comprehensive plan is the best way, in his words, the most effective way, to get out the most number of hostages that are still held by Hamas, including those American hostages. And he also reiterated calls for Hamas to accept that deal that is on the table. He wouldn't entertain questions as to whether the raid over the weekend that released those four Israeli hostages and killed upwards of 100 people would potentially negatively impact how Hamas responds to that deal that is on the table, though we did hear from the national security adviser over the weekend that it's a fair question to ask. But he met with Egyptian officials earlier today before coming here to Israel,and he did say that the Egyptians have been in touch with Hamas just in recent hours. Listen to what he told me.
 
(BEGING VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANTONY BLINKEN, SECRETARY OF STATE: I can't go into the details of our conversations today except to say that our Egyptian counterparts were in communication with Hamas as early as recently as a few hours ago. And so I got a conversation--
 
ATWOOD: Was the conversation hopeful?
 
BLINKEN:--not going get any details about that. But I think Egypt, the United States, other countries believe that, again, we should be able to get to yes. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ATWOOD: Now, obviously, this is a live ball. The U.S., Israel, all the other players here waiting for Hamas to respond. The secretary of state meeting tomorrow, notably with Benny Gantz. He is that member of the war cabinet who resigned over the weekend in protest of Prime Minister Benjamin Benjamin Netanyahu's approach to Gaza, to this conflict, to the fact that he says Netanyahu hasn't laid out an effective plan to bring this war to an end. So we'll be watching to see what comes out of that meeting in addition to the other meetings that the secretary has in the region. Brianna. 
 
KEILAR: And where does he head, Kylie, after that? What's he hoping to accomplish?
 
ATWOOD: Well, he has a number of things he's looking at, of course, the moment right now, trying to get all these countries to put pressure on Hamas to say yes, is his focal point. But he's also focused on the future of this conflict tomorrow. He's going to be in Jordan. He's there for a humanitarian conference talking about how to bring humanitarian support, rebuilding to Gaza while this conflict is happening and after this conflict concludes. And then he's going to Qatar. He's going to be meeting with those Qatari officials who have been key intermediaries with Hamas, of course, in addition to the Egyptians who he met with earlier today to focus on how to get this proposal that is on the table and push it forward. Brianna. 
 
KEILAR: All right, Kylie, Atwood live for us in Tel Aviv. Thank you for that. Thank you for that report. Boris.
 <br>[14:20:09]
 
SANCHEZ: Two of the four hostages who were freed in that dramatic rescue operation are now out of the hospital. All four were reunited with their families this weekend after eight months in captivity. It was a moment of joy for their loved ones, but we should note there are still believed to be 120 captives remaining in Gaza. One of those hostages is Omri Moran. His family says that Hamas terrorists kidnapped Moran, his wife and their two daughters from their home on October 7th. Moran was later separated from the rest of his family and taken to Gaza. Joining us now is Omri Moran's brother-in-law, Moshe Levy. Moshe, thank you so much for joining us again. I want to start with the hostage rescue mission. What was going through your mind when you learned about it? What's your reaction to the news?
 
MOSHE LAVI, BROTHER-IN-LAW TAKEN HOSTAGE: Thank you, Boris and Brianna, for having me. The hostage rescue was definitely a joyous moment for us, many Israelis, and I think for many who have been supporting us from all around the world. We, of course, were praying to learn about the fact that Hamas used their own people as human shields during that operation and of course non-combatants were harmed but at least we were able to rescue our hostages. I wish those operations were not needed because only last week Hamas was given the opportunity to agree to a hostage deal that was proposed by Israel that was presented by President Biden and yet it refuses to provide an answer. Once it provides a positive answer we could continue and see an end to this tragic war that affects both Israelis and Gazans.
 
SANCHEZ:  Moshe I want to ask you about that deal because there are some developments that might be coming in the next few hours from the United Nations. But I wanted to ask you about whether anyone from the government talked to you about the operation over the weekend or have updated you on any of the efforts to get Amri home. Have they shared any information with you about his status?
 
LAVI: The Israeli government and the security bodies provide information to the families on a regular basis when such information is available. They don't do it-they can't provide too much information because that will risk, of course, their other considerations they have both diplomatic, intelligence, military, etc. But we are giving information about the situation on a regular basis. We don't really know where he is located. The last we heard of Amri was from the psychological warfare video release that featured him in April. We don't know his whereabouts in the Gaza Strip. Hamas doesn't provide that information. We were updated about the operation, of course, after. As an after fact, and of course, followed all the reports from the media. 
 
The government does support us in the ways it can and the IDF does support us in the ways they can, but at the end of the day, we're living in not knowing much about what's going on, waking up every day fearing the worst. I woke up a few days ago, reading the joyful news of the rescue of the four hostages by the IDF. But at the same time, things could have been very different, which is why we keep emphasizing that despite the ability to rescue some of the hostages in heroic actions, a deal is probably the only viable way to bring home the hostages. Whether those who are alive, whether to rehabilitation with their families, those who were murdered in captivity by Hamas to proper burial in Israel.
 
SANCHEZ: Yeah, so the UN Security Council is set to vote in an hour or so to send a message to Hamas that they should accept this deal that was presented by President Biden that the Israeli government has accepted. You've talked about it being really the best pathway forward to get the hostages home. How optimistic are you that this deal will actually happen? LAVI: I'm trying to be as optimistic as possible, but at the same time, realism always creeps into our minds, the families of hostages. We know that in the past there were several opportunities to release the hostages through a deal, and then they were rejected by Hamas, hindered by developments on the field. 
 <br>[14:25:09]
 
We know that the international community has not been effective in pressuring Hamas and their accomplices, pressuring their sponsors and funders, countries such as Iran and Qatar, to make sure they do their duty to the international law and force Hamas to release the hostages. And so I really don't know what to think of it. The United Nations, in many cases, is a mere exhibition. It's nothing of a different, doesn't make much difference for things on the ground, whether in the case of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or in many other conflicts around the world that are sadly unfolding in front of eyes. And so I don't know whether this is going to change much. What I do know is that the key is in Yechia Sinwa's hands and the head of Hamas in Gaza. 
 
If he will say yes, we'll be able to move forward to the first phase of the agreement and then move forward to see and end to this war. I sadly don't see any indication that Hamas is going to accept it. And I think they're being emboldened by the narrative that is being promoted by disinformation agents online or on the streets, by both traditional and social media, and by international bodies that are not holding them as accountable as they should hold them. 
 
SANCHEZ: Amri, you spoke a moment ago about trying to be optimistic. I'm wondering how you and your and your family are doing through all of this. It's been a few months since I've gotten the chance to speak with you. And I'm wondering if this news over the weekend gives you hope for Amri's safe return. 
 
LAVI: Every day is a painful day for us. I returned from Israel a few weeks ago to the U.S. after I spent time with family. And it was such a difficult moment for us. It affects us tremendously. The issue with Amri, the displacement, the ongoing fighting, and the tragedy that this war brought upon us as a family, as a nation, and also to the entire region, because I feel I have empathy to the neighbors we have in the Gaza Strip, those who are not involved with Hamas. I try to hold into the hope that we can still resolve this in the best possible way for Amri and for the many other hostages who are still believed to be alive. And that's why I keep advocating, as I did yesterday in a rally in New York, as my sister and my entire family and Amri's family, have been doing in Israel and in Europe and other places around the world. We have to keep advocating. 
 
We have to keep shouting. But we're counting as well on the wider public, whether they trust Israel or don't trust Israel, whether they support Israel or the Palestinians, et cetera. They need to stop seeing this as a game. And I think that's what we need to do, is to stop seeing the hostages and us, the people who live in the region, as pawns. They need to be clear that the hostages need to be at the center of this, that they need to be released by a terrorist organization that is holding them, that we can possibly reach a ceasefire if Hamas will lay down their arms and agree to this agreement that is being proposed to them. That is very generous. 
 
That is not a very good agreement for Israel. But it is the only way to bring the hostages home at this point that is not through military means. So I try to hold onto that hope. But every day that passes, we normalize the situation, the wider public normalizes the situation. And it's only going to make it more difficult to bring home the hostages. So I'm going to use this platform to call anybody who is watching to reach their elected officials and go to the streets and call for the release of the hostages and call for a deal that will bring an end to this war and to the suffering of both Palestinians in Gaza and Israelis.
 
SANCHEZ: Moshe Lavi we're grateful to have you joining us to share Amri's story. We send our best to your family.
 
LAVI: Thank you so much.
 
SANCHEZ: Of course. Still to come on News Central, Cleveland now dealing with what the city calls a cyber incident that caused it to shut down some important services. We're going to talk about what's being impacted and what we know about the source of this incident so far. Plus, first it was balloons filled with trash from North Korea. Now it's loudspeakers blasting propaganda and K-POP from the South. We have more on the escalating annoyance campaign from these rowdy neighbors.
