ELENI GIOKOS, CNN HOST, CONNECT THE WORLD: I'm Eleni Giokos. I'm in for Becky Anderson. It is 7 pm and Dubai. Hello and welcome to "Connect the 
 
 World". Peace and economic opportunity go together those words of U.S. President Joe Biden saluting a milestone anniversary for the Good Friday 
 
 Agreement.
 
This comes as Mr. Biden made a historic visit to Northern Ireland. Some observer's hivers say his time in Belfast felt a bit brief. After a short 
 
 meeting there earlier with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak Mr. Biden gave a speech marking a quarter century of the peace deal that ended a 
 
 violent era known as the troubles take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JEO BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Thousands of families have been affected by the troubles. Losses are real. The pain was personal. 
 
 I need not to tell many people in this audience. Every person killed in the troubles left an empty chair at the dining room table, a hole in the heart 
 
 that was never filled for the ones the last. Peace was not inevitable. We can't ever forget that.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GIOKOS: CNN's Senior International Diplomatic Editor Nic Robertson knows the Northern Ireland story really well. He's been covering it for 30 years, 
 
 and joins us now with the view from Belfast. Great to see you, Nic! You come with a lot of historical context in terms of how long this has taken 
 
 off far Ireland has come.
 
This is quite a significant visit by President Joe Biden. But what do you make of the goals that he says that he wants to attain and he's talking 
 
 about the Windsor Agreement as well as the Irish courts.
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: He did. He spoke about the 25 years of peace and the way to build on peace was through 
 
 business. And this is what he said the United States was coming with a commitment to help ensure the peace here but bringing his envoy to Northern 
 
 Ireland Joe Kennedy has a specific remit to try to help businesses here.
 
President Biden talking about a huge number of U.S. businesses that want to invest in Northern Ireland said the economy here had almost doubled in the 
 
 past 25 years. He said that it could triple in the coming years.
 
So there was that aspiration side of it. But I think where the President wanted to push the narrative forward was that bit where he spoke about the 
 
 importance of the Good Friday Agreement, the importance of the institutions the power sharing government that it created, and the importance of that 
 
 power sharing government to be up and running.
 
And it isn't at the moment, and it isn't because the main Unionist Party, the Democratic Unionist Party here doesn't think that the Windsor framework 
 
 and the out flowing, if you will, of Brexit are done to their satisfaction.
 
So the President knew that he had, you know, difficult diplomatic tightrope to walk here because the perception on the Unionist side is too pro-Irish, 
 
 he doesn't care for their pro Unionist, British sentiments.
 
But he was at pains the President was at pains to point out is English ancestry because everyone and he do talk about his Irish roots. So I think 
 
 there was an effort there to appeal to the other side. But he was never going to come in here to try to pressure the Democratic Unionist Party 
 
 because he clearly had been advised that to do that would just backfire.
 
So this was as far as he could go with his language today in trying to persuade them that was the way forward to get back into the power sharing 
 
 government.
 
GIOKOS: All right Nic Robertson, thank you so much for joining us. Well, the Head of Sinn Fein, which is Ireland's Nationalist Republican Party, 
 
 dedicated to the unification reunification of Ireland tweeted saying 25 years on farm the Good Friday Agreement.
 
Political leaders now owe it to a new generation to recapture the spirit and determination of 1998. We owe it to our children to overcome our 
 
 differences and to make progress happen. The DUP boycotts of government must end last year.
 
Sinn Fein came under the strongest political party in both Ireland and Northern Ireland, which means Mary Lou McDonald will likely become the next 
 
 Prime Minister of Ireland. Mary Lou McDonald joins me now live from Dublin. Great to have you join us today.
 
President Joe Biden is now in Dublin however, his trip to the North was certainly shorter than planned and I'm sure perhaps a few months ago, it 
 
 was thought that Northern Assembly would be up and running. Is his visit there a wasted opportunity would you say?
 
MARY LOU MCDONALD, SINN FEIN PRESIDENT: Well, absolutely not. I mean President Biden is most welcome to Ireland. We feel that we are welcoming 
 
 him home. He's been in County today.
 <br>[11:05:00]
 
I know that we will meet him in Dublin. Tomorrow, he'll travelled to the west to Mayo, and certainly retrace his roots and he was in Belfast earlier 
 
 on. So there's a very, very warm welcome for President Biden a huge acknowledgement of the critical role that the United States has played over 
 
 25 years.
 
That critical role played by the Clinton Administration, the subsequent administrations in delivering and building peace here in Ireland. And of 
 
 course, I am very disappointed that as President Biden visits to mark this momentous achievement of a quarter of a century of peace that the DUP 
 
 continue their boycott of government in Belfast.
 
I think that is a missed opportunity. And I think is a shame I would have liked nothing better than to see President Biden address the assembly in 
 
 Belfast to be greeted by Michelle O'Neill, my Sinn Fein colleague as First Minister.
 
But look, we need to get past these difficulties. I think it needs to be clear to everybody that there are challenges for us but enormous 
 
 opportunities. I want us to grasp them collectively and I believe we can do it.
 
GIOKOS: OK. But Mary, I want to -- because you mentioned the DUP and also Jeffrey Donaldson said that the speech in Northern Ireland would alter a 
 
 broken political environment in the region. What do you think it's going to take for the DUP to get back to power sharing?
 
MCDONALD: Well I mean, the DUP remember campaigned for Brexit. And now the DUP cried the saltiest tears about the consequences of Brexit. I mean, it 
 
 was always clear that Brexit would be bad for Ireland that it was going to cause us a huge problem.
 
That we would have to find protections for the peace for the Good Friday Peace Accord for the all-Ireland economy and a huge amount of work has been 
 
 done by the European authorities, and others to secure all of that. And now the negotiation is over.
 
I mean, the British government has said that the European authorities have said that all of us accept that, and now we need to get back to work. It's 
 
 as simple really, as that unionism in Ireland knows as well as--
 
GIOKOS: You mentioned that you'll be seeing President Biden tomorrow. I'm curious what you're going to be talking to him about. But also, I have to 
 
 mention that, you know, in recent opinion polls, you're now clearly the most popular party in Ireland. How confident are you that you will be 
 
 Ireland's first Female Prime Minister after the next general election?
 
MCDONALD: Well, of course, that will be down to the Irish electorate and I am long enough in political life to know that to be presumptuous is a very, 
 
 very dangerous thing. I am however, very hopeful that I will lead Sinn Fein into government for the first time in Dublin after the next election.
 
I currently am the leader of the opposition here. It's the first time Sinn Fein has led the opposition in Dublin, and the first time that a woman has 
 
 led the opposition in the Irish Parliament. So the omens and the signs are good.
 
But we have a huge amount of work left to do and not least, for me, a huge challenge is to get government back up and running in the north. And I will 
 
 take the opportunity again, as when I meet with President Biden, just to say and to reassure him.
 
That we are working hard on that and really to acknowledge and thank him, his administration and so many others across our political life in the 
 
 United States, and for the ongoing support, particularly during Brexit. It's been a very steadying and a very, very, very influential factor in 
 
 achieving agreement.
 
GIOKOS: Well, in the last hour, I spoke with Micheal Martin, the current Foreign Minister of Ireland and he had this to say by joining Sinn Fein in 
 
 government, I want you to take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MICHEAL MARTIN, IRISH FOREIGN MINISTER: We want to align with parties with likeminded views, particularly on the economy and enterprise and on the 
 
 European Union and international issues. And Sinn Fein has policies that are very significantly at variance with ours on all of those fronts.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[11:10:00]
 
GIOKOS: So you have varying views with what Michael Martin is talking about. But he also said something else. He said, in respect of Northern 
 
 Ireland and what they did they need to address the legacy issues and to give proper closure to the families of victims of IRA violence in the past. 
 
 What is your response to this?
 
MCDONALD: Well look, on the wider policy issues of course, we have policy differences. And I could recite for you I won't, but I could recite for you 
 
 the many, many failures of Michael Martin's party and government over a very long period of time.
 
But the people the Irish electorate will adjudicate that on dealing with the legacy of the past. I agree with me, Michael Martin, that there is 
 
 still a road to be traveled to bring truth, to bring some comfort and sense of justice to victims and survivors of the troubles across the community, 
 
 including those that were hurt, harmed and injured by the IRA.
 
But just remember, many years ago, an agreement was reached between all of the parties on this island as to what those mechanisms would look like. And 
 
 the British government came in sighted national security and put a stop to the whole lot. So I not the issue here and Sinn Fein is not the issue in 
 
 terms of reaching closure and justice for victims.
 
The problem has been and remains the British government and in fact, they're bringing legislation through their own parliament, to grant an 
 
 amnesty to British soldiers, British agents and their proxies most unhelpful a move that's been condemned domestically and internationally.
 
But by human rights experts and groups, by academics, by everyone and anyone, and yet they persist with that. But there is an excellent issue in 
 
 terms of how we deal with the Brexit. I absolutely accept that it's a sensitive issue. And it's one that we shouldn't play petty political 
 
 politics with.
 
GIOKOS: And you seem to have alignment on that policy. But Michael also accuses you, of Sinn Fein of being anti-enterprise. What do you think of 
 
 that? And are you in essence, anti-enterprise?
 
MCDONALD: Well, on the contrary, I mean, that's nonsense. And in some ways, you know, I have some sympathy for Michael Martin for the parties of kind 
 
 of the old establishment because they are really, really struggling to understand much less to manage, or get ahead of the extent of change, 
 
 generational change that's happening in Iran.
 
And so they play out these tropes again, and again. I mean, I want my country, our country to prosper. I want people to have good jobs. I want 
 
 innovators to innovate. I want us to lead on research and development. I'm a Dubliner and our city now is now a hub of international talent.
 
We are a young population, the youngest in Europe. We have sky high productivity rates. I want people to have good jobs, and good lives a good 
 
 standard of living. And for all of that to happen, you have to have a thriving enterprise space. So we will look to build that enhance in ways 
 
 that--
 
GIOKOS: This is quite an important. This is quite important in terms of, you know, economic prosperity big talk about a referendum on Northern 
 
 Ireland and whether that's going to be held soon. What your timeline is? What are you looking at as realistic?
 
MCDONALD: Well, I think the most important thing is that the preparation for a peaceful, orderly democratic transition needs to start now and I've 
 
 made this point to Michael Martin to his colleague, Leo Varadkar, who's currently the -- Prime Minister.
 
That really that preparation needs to start now. There will be no prize for those that bury their head in the sand. I want the transition back to Irish 
 
 unity, to be orderly, planned, peaceful, wholly democratic, I believe it can happen.
 
The referendums can happen in this decade. I believe that the momentum for change and the appetite for the opportunities that present themselves to us 
 
 is just enormous, but I also know that we need to talk to each other.
 
We need a very open, inclusive engagement right across Irish society, north and south, east and west. And I look forward to that. You know, sometimes 
 
 you'll hear people talk about change in Ireland and Irish reunification as almost like a zero sum game winners loser.
 <br>[11:15:00]
 
And one side prevailing of the other, I don't see it like that. All I see is common opportunity for our children, for our grandchildren for the next 
 
 generation. This is an extraordinary island with extraordinary people, and extraordinary talent base extraordinary natural resources.
 
And because we are partition still, almost more than a century now our island has been divided. You know, we're not reaching our full potential, 
 
 but we can. And I believe there is a generations of people now who have an appetite for that. And I am so excited to be a political leader at this 
 
 time and at this point in our history.
 
GIOKOS: OK, we ran out of time. Very briefly, I know that you've maintained correspondence with King Charles, and even met him after the passing of 
 
 Queen Elizabeth. Have you been invited to his coronation and would you attend if so?
 
MCDONALD: Well, no I haven't -- I don't expect that I'm the leader of the opposition. I'm not head of government here. But I wish him well, on that 
 
 occasion. I know it'll be a very important day for so many people, obviously, across Britain, but here in Ireland, as well as those who have a 
 
 real sense of loyalty to the monarchy. So it will be a big occasion for them.
 
GIOKOS: Mary Lou McDonald, thank you very much for your time great to have you on the show. Much appreciate for your time.
 
MCDONALD: Thanks so much, my pleasure!
 
GIOKOS: All right, I also spoke with Irish Foreign Minister and Former Irish Taoiseach Michael Martin about a range of issues ranging from climate 
 
 change to Ukraine. And we will be showing that interview a little bit later on the show.
 
Well, Chinese military exercises have Taiwan on -- just ahead, we'll have a live report on the growing tensions and Taiwan's vowed to defend itself.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
GIOKOS: New Chinese military exercises over Taiwan on edge. Taiwan's Foreign Minister says those exercises indicate China is getting ready to 
 
 launch a war. Taiwan's Defense Ministry has condemned actions the Chinese military has taken around the island.
 
Officials there have said Taiwan does not want to escalate the conflict but will defend itself. CNN's Chief U.S. Security Correspondent Jim Sciutto 
 
 joins us now from Washington. Major worries coming through from Taiwan after these military exercises take us through the latest.
 
JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: No question. And listen clearly Taiwan is taking them very seriously. Taiwanese officials have 
 
 noted to me that these exercises envisioned a joint strike operation against the island air land and sea attacks in fact, an invasion.
 
So they look at that operation, and they see more than symbolism. They see genuine military preparations. So when I asked the Foreign Minister 
 
 directly do they see this as preparations for war his answer showed that concern, have a listen.
 <br>[11:20:00]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOSEPH WU, TAIWANESE FOREIGN MINISTER: I look at military exercises and also the referee. There seems to be trying to get ready to launch a war 
 
 against Taiwan. But if we look at the UN Charter, the most fundamental tenet in resolving international disputes should be through peaceful means. 
 
 And Beijing's way of handling the differences between Taiwan and China is through coercion, military threat, and the threat to use force against 
 
 Taiwan. And these are unacceptable.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SCIUTTO: Of course, Taiwan is watching the signals and the statements from other leaders. He repeatedly noted that the U.S. has been very supportive 
 
 and noted U.S. weapons ongoing weapons sales, though he emphasized repeatedly that Taiwan considers its own responsibility to defend itself.
 
One other thing I mentioned Eleni, as you'll remember the flap from the French President Emmanuel Macron's comments after he met the Chinese 
 
 President Xi Jinping seeming to indicate in an interview that France would not want to get involved in any conflict not be drawn into a conflict 
 
 between the U.S. and China over Taiwan. I did ask the Foreign Minister about those French comments. And he told me that Taiwan has reached out to 
 
 the French government for clarification.
 
GIOKOS: All right, Jim Sciutto, thank you very much for that update. Great to see you! Well, what will happen next between China and Taiwan and what 
 
 will be the global response? For the latest in the military movements and ongoing tension in Taiwan, stay updated. You can look @cnn.com.
 
Ukraine's security service has opened a war crimes investigation after gruesome videos emerged online, one is set to show a Russian fighter 
 
 beheading Ukrainian soldier. The other purports to show the headless bodies of two Ukrainian soldiers next to a destroyed a military vehicle. CNN is 
 
 not showing the videos because they are too disturbing.
 
But we did freeze some of their contents to show who the victims and perpetrators may be. And here you can see the white leg, that the white leg 
 
 band that indicates support for the Russian military. The stills to be released show the yellow armband worn by Ukraine's military.
 
Well CNN's Ben Wedeman is in eastern Ukraine. Ben thanks so much for joining us! These videos just too horrifying terrific to even look at but 
 
 what more can you tell us about what they depict and show?
 
BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, these are two videos that emerged today on pro-Russian social media channels. Now one of 
 
 them appears to be having been shot around this time of year it's believed in the area of Bakhmut, what you see is the beheaded corpses of two 
 
 Ukrainian soldiers next to a destroyed military vehicle. And it also appears that their hands were cut off as well.
 
You hear in that video, somebody say they killed them. Someone came up to them; they came up to them and cut their heads off. Now CNN can't confirm 
 
 the location where this happened. Now the second video appears to have been shot. We believe in the summer, its location also unclear what you see 
 
 there and it's somewhat blurred that video.
 
But what you do see is a soldier appears to be a Russian cutting the head with a knife off of a Ukrainian soldier. And it appears that from this 
 
 video that the Ukrainian soldier was alive when the knife started to slit his throat. Clearly the Ukrainians are enraged at these videos of the 
 
 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, saying that how easily these beasts killed.
 
Now the Kremlin we heard from Dmitry Peskov, the spokesman, the chief spokesman there saying describing the video as terrible. But he says the 
 
 authenticity of the video has yet to be ascertained. Now Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Head of the private military company, Wagner Group, who many people 
 
 believe may have been involved in these atrocities has said that there's nothing in the videos that indicate that his men were involved.
 
But Eleni, it's important to keep in mind that this isn't the first time such atrocities have happened in this war. It wasn't long ago that there 
 
 was video circulating of Russian soldiers killing a Ukrainian prisoner in cold blood, Eleni?
 
GIOKOS: All right. Ben Wedeman, thank you so much. Well defense ministers from both Ukraine and Spain on denying allegations that emerge from leaked 
 
 Pentagon documents which say NATO troops are fighting against Russian forces within Ukraine.
 <br>[11:25:00]
 
Madrid insists the claims are totally false. This all comes as the U.S. defense secretary has been meeting Ukraine's prime minister at the Pentagon 
 
 over the past couple of hours. Let's head straight there and speak to Natasha Bertrand, with the very latest. Natasha, the leaked documents 
 
 creating a lot of concern, many questions raised and actually, frankly, quite a few denials. Take us through what we've heard.
 
NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTER: That's right Eleni. So notably, one of the things here that the Ukrainian prime minister asked 
 
 Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin for when he arrived here this morning, were those F-15, F-16 fighter jets as well as long range missiles. And the 
 
 secretary of defense would not really comment on those requests directly, instead saying that the U.S. was going to continue to ramp up its 
 
 production of relevant weapons.
 
But I think that against the backdrop of these leaks that request is very interesting, because in one of these documents that we have reported on, in 
 
 fact, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy is overheard by U.S. eavesdroppers telling his advisers that he wants to strike inside of Russia.
 
And that has been one of the main fears that the U.S. has had about giving the Ukrainians these kinds of long-range weapons is that the Ukrainians 
 
 will then use them to attack inside Russian territory. Now, the Ukrainians have said repeatedly that they would not use long range U.S. weapons and 
 
 U.S. provided equipment writ large to strike inside Russia. But obviously this is part of really what's driving the U.S. reluctance to send them that 
 
 kind of gear.
 
Now, we're also hearing, of course, from allies who are saying that a lot of what is in these leaked documents is not accurate, and also that it can, 
 
 it could contain some disinformation. It is not our understanding that these documents are in authentic; we are told that they are part of a 
 
 larger, daily briefing that is provided to senior Pentagon leaders here, but that at least one of them has been doctored.
 
And that is one that shows Russian and Ukrainian casualty figures in the war. One of the documents has an estimate that is a lot lower of Russian 
 
 casualties than what the Pentagon has actually assessed here. So, there are some questions about how the U.S. is smoothing this over with allies, 
 
 including with the Ukrainians.
 
Obviously, there is a high-level meeting happening today between the Ukrainian PM and the Secretary of Defense. But a lot of these documents do 
 
 expose some very sensitive information about Ukraine's military operations that the Ukrainians definitely did not want to be out there, Eleni.
 
GIOKOS: Yes, Natasha, you know, with regards to these leaked documents, creating, you know, a bit of a flurry, I think, globally with, you know, 
 
 the information that has been contained, do we know anything more in terms of a lot of the crisis management work that the U.S. has had to do over 
 
 this period?
 
BERTRAND: Well, they've been doing a lot of work behind the scenes, there have been a flurry of phone calls between the secretary of defense and some 
 
 of his allies, including in South Korea and Israel to try to smooth things over here. Because as we saw, some of those documents do have some pretty 
 
 explosive allegations about things that U.S. allies are doing, including one that said that Egypt was considering sending up to 40,000 rockets to 
 
 the Russians.
 
The U.S., between the White House and the Pentagon and the State Department, they have been really doing damage control over the last six 
 
 days or so trying to ensure allies that their secrets are safe, and that their national security is not compromised. But according to our sources, 
 
 the allies are also very willing to try to help the U.S. in any way they can try to figure out how this happened.
 
And that is really the bulk of what the U.S. is doing right now as well. The Justice Department has launched a criminal investigation; there are 
 
 investigations within the Pentagon to try to figure out how this happened. For now, though, the allies, you know, some of them are releasing public 
 
 statements saying that they are categorically denying the allegations in this intelligence.
 
But the U.S. trying to reassure them, that their partnership is still solid, and that they should continue to share intelligence we'll see 
 
 whether those allies of course continue to do that as robustly, Eleni.
 
GIOKOS: Right, Natasha Bertrand, great to see you. Thank you. Well, still to come, my interview with Ireland's former Prime Minister and current 
 
 Foreign Minister Micheal Martin. What he said about the war in Ukraine and the tensions between China and the U.S. He also spoke about Middle East 
 
 tensions will take you inside the Al Aqsa Mosque, a place of peace and prayer that recently became a flashpoint of violence.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:30:00]
 
GIOKOS: U.S. President Joe Biden is in the Republic of Ireland after making historic visit to Northern Ireland to mark the 25th anniversary of the Good 
 
 Friday peace agreement. The peace plan was brokered by the U.S. in 1998, ending three decades of conflict in Northern Ireland. Mr. Biden is meeting 
 
 with American embassy staff in Dublin.
 
He's also stopping at the place where his great, great, great, great grandfather grew up. Earlier I spoke with Ireland's Foreign Affairs 
 
 Minister about the challenges Europe is facing. Want you to take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MICHEAL MARTIN, IRISH FOREIGN MINISTER: We're militarily neutral insofar as we're not part of the military alliance, we're not politically neutral. And 
 
 we have welcomed, for example, over 70,000 Ukrainians to Ireland as refugees. That's about 1.5 percent of our population. So, we've I think, 
 
 responded very significantly from a humanitarian perspective, and also through the European peace facility fund, which facilitates the funding of 
 
 military and non-military support to Ukraine.
 
And we've been one of the strongest advocates for Ukraine membership of the European Union. In terms of the broader issue of, of modern-day security 
 
 threats and challenges, I am initiating a national conversation in Ireland on broader Irish foreign policy, the security challenges of today and 
 
 indeed, tomorrow.
 
And how best as a country, we should respond to that in line with Ireland's traditional position of military non-alignment, both politically, 
 
 obviously, with shared values. And fundamentally, we're committed to a rules based international order.
 
GIOKOS: I want to get your reaction of what we've seen unfold between Israelis and Palestinians of late. We saw Israeli police storming the Al 
 
 Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. It caused international outrage. But what is your response to what you saw?
 
MARTIN: I'm very, very concerned by with what I see, and a number of like- minded countries in Europe are as well. I think the composition of the current Israeli government is problematic, there's a far-right dimension to 
 
 it, which is leading to radical policies that in themselves are contributing to destabilizing the situation.
 
We condemn violence on all sides. We favor a two-state solution. But it seems to me that the direction of travel of the Israeli government is in 
 
 such a direction now that it's making that two state solution, almost unviable. And that is a really concern for us. We think what's happening at 
 
 the Al-Aqsa mosque is wrong.
 
And there should be de-escalation there in terms of -- and the status quo must be allowed to prevail. And also, it's clear that there's been a higher 
 
 level of violence now in the occupied territories over the last year and indeed in the first number of months of this year than we've seen for quite 
 
 some time.
 <br>[11:35:00]
 
GIOKOS: Are you worried is Ireland worried about the actions that the government is taking and what this could mean?
 
MARTIN: We are very worried by those actions. We are always concerned when the separation of powers and democracy are not fully respected. I do take 
 
 heart from the very strong civic society response within Israel, to the measures that were contemplated by the government, in respect of the 
 
 judiciary. And I think that was happening.
 
And it did speak to the power of civil society, civic society within Israel itself, which is strength, and that should be acknowledged. However, it 
 
 seems to me that Israeli government policy has had a consistent thread of marginalizing moderation within Palestine, undermining the Palestinian 
 
 authority.
 
And rather giving soccer indirectly, maybe unintentionally, but giving soccer nonetheless, to the more radical elements of the more 
 
 fundamentalist, and hence we get far greater violence and instability as a result. I failed to detect a coherent strategy in terms of the Palestinian 
 
 question; we favor a two-state solution. And we believe that is the only way that this issue can have a sustainable future and ultimately get 
 
 resolved.
 
GIOKOS: You've recently met with Wang Yi, top Chinese diplomat. And look, there are major concerns in terms of what we're seeing between China and 
 
 the U.S. major tech tensions there. We have seen China meeting with top diplomats from around the world and leaders, how are you balancing? What 
 
 you're doing right now between getting into a new market, keeping a healthy relationship with China versus the U.S. agenda?
 
MARTIN: Well, I think we were very mindful of what is occurring. And I think one important benchmark for us is adherence to the rules-based order 
 
 to internationally, to international organizations and institutions. But also, particularly as members of the European Union, reflecting on the 
 
 nature and future dynamic of the relationship between China and the European Union.
 
And I think the President of the Commission Ursula von der Leyen last week did articulate a fairly comprehensive position in terms of de-risking, but 
 
 not de-leveraging, I think aren't has exports significantly to China. But our main economic thrust has always been Europe and the United States. 
 
 We're very clear about that.
 
But we're a global economic player in the sense that we export all over the world in terms of our products and services. And we want to see dialogue, 
 
 we want to see continue engagement. I am concerned about the polarization that is currently occurring within the world. That is not good.
 
But we have to be really realistic sorry, in respect of what is happening in terms of greater assertiveness on behalf of China at one level and also 
 
 in terms of the its relationship with both the United States and with Europe.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GIOKOS: Alright, that was Micheal Martin, Island's Foreign Affairs Minister. Let's get you up to speed on some other stories that are on our 
 
 radar right now. Armenia and Azerbaijan are accusing each other of opening fire near the contested region of Nagorno Karabakh. Both sides say several 
 
 of these soldiers were killed in what each are calling a provocation Armenia and Azerbaijan of former soviet states, they've been battling over

GIOKOS: A tense calm right now at one of the world's holiest sites, the Israeli government is banning non-Muslims from the sacred area Jews called 
 
 the Temple Mount known to Muslims as Haram Al Sharif until the end of Ramadan. The area includes Al Aqsa Mosque, which Israeli police raided 
 
 twice last week. Salma Abdelaziz has this rare look for us inside the mosque.
 
SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): A delicate balance that governs in binds this holy site is under strength. My producer and I both 
 
 Muslim born were granted access to film at the Al Aqsa compound by the custodians of the site. Only Muslims are allowed to pray here, under a 
 
 long-standing status quo arrangement that worshippers tell us is slowly being eroded. Non-Muslims can visit the complex during certain hours.
 
I feel pain true pain inside this woman tells me this is a place of worship not a place for occupation or for provocation. This is what she means. 
 
 While we speak, a group of largely Jewish visitors passes by the mosque under police escort. The women demonstrate by reciting the Quran louder and 
 
 louder. This mountaintop is revered by Jews to, they call it Temple Mount.
 
A growing movement of Jewish extremist is demanding to perform prayers here that could upend the status quo. We witnessed at least two men praying as 
 
 police stand by. We've seen several small groups like this of non-Muslim worshippers passing through the complex as Muslims continue to pray inside 
 
 the mosque. This is where the friction is. This is where the controversy lies.
 
Jordan is the custodian of the grounds. But that role is becoming increasingly symbolic, experts say because it is Israel that controls the 
 
 security checks at entry points and therefore access. The director general of Al Aqsa sees the increasing visits of Jewish extremists under police 
 
 escort as a provocation.
 
I see these visits as an attack on our holy site, he tells me and I warn the Government of Israel to stay away from Al Aqsa mosque because any 
 
 violation here drags down the entire region. And there are tons at the gates, small groups of Jewish radicals seeing the temple will be built a 
 
 reference to a far-right fringe call to build a Third Temple on the sacred grounds.
 
Prime Minister Netanyahu insists he is committed to keeping the status quo, but under his government, the most far right in Israel's history. Extremist 
 
 voices are growing louder and stronger. All this makes an already extremely contentious place ever more of a tinderbox. One event here can and has 
 
 sparked deadly cycles of violence across the region. Al Aqsa is seen as a political symbol as well as a religious one by the Arab world.
 <br>[11:45:00]
 
The complex lies in the heart of East Jerusalem, which most of the international community considers to be under Israeli occupation, but which 
 
 Israel sees as part of its united capital. Al Aqsa is our life. It is the breath we breathe, he says, it is an ideology that we carry in our minds.
 
We enter the Dome of the Rock, an area designated for women to witness the afternoon prayer, some go to great lengths to get here, passing multiple 
 
 checkpoints, but they tell us they find some peace when they arrive.
 
Of course, I don't feel safe, she tells me and everything can change in an instant. So, I'm always scared. But I'm here because I have faith in God. 
 
 This prayer passed peacefully, as most do. But here even quiet worship is not a guarantee. Salma Abdelaziz, CNN Jerusalem.
 
GIOKOS: Well, the tense situation in Jerusalem has been building for months, years really. Read all about it in our newsletter "Meanwhile in the 
 
 Middle East" we have extensive analysis from Jerusalem and all around the region. And you can find it at cnn.com/middleeast newsletter or scan the QR

Italy is now in a state of emergency a measurement to help it deal with a huge rise in the number of migrants coming to the country. Since the 
 
 government issued the declaration on Tuesday, two more boats each carrying around 400 migrants have been spotted in the Mediterranean.
 
The Italian coast guard was already escorting two other disabled migrant boats to safety. Want to take us straight to Barbie Nadeau, who is in Rome 
 
 for us a state of emergency declared. Give me a sense of what we're seeing on the ground and two more boats discovered.
 
BARBIE NADEAU, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, you know, those two boats with the Italian coast guard were accompanying have arrived one in Sicily with 
 
 around 800 people and another one in Calabria with around 400 people on it. Those boats were serious, you know, states of disrepair let's say they 
 
 weren't very seaworthy, but they have arrived safely.
 
These other two boats, as far as we know, from the NGOs that keep an eye on these things have not been, there's been no operation of rescue that has 
 
 been started on that yet. But of course, this comes on the back of this state of emergency and we're hearing a little bit of criticism. Italy's arm 
 
 of the Amnesty International criticized it, saying that they didn't think using the word emergency with migrant was very good for public opinion, 
 
 especially a year like this when so many people are arriving.
 
And you know, it's very, it's kind of up in the air, what it means in terms of the civil protection and what they're going to be able to do. It's going 
 
 to be easier to expel people to repatriate people to not maybe give them the chance that asylum that a lot of people might have expected when making 
 
 that risking their lives coming across here.
 
So, it's a little bit up in the air. We haven't seen, you know; let's say a lot of acceptance from the humanitarian rights groups, but these boats just 
 
 keep coming. This is year we've seen four times more people arriving this time of the year than we have in years past. And right now, usually April, 
 
 May, is when the boats start to arrive. This is when we're seeing the calmer weather.
 
So, this puts a lot of pressure on this government under Giorgia Meloni who won last September on an anti-immigration stance. She promised, she want 
 
 promising to stop those from arriving, Eleni.
 
GIOKOS: Yes, Barbie Nadeau thank you for that update. Well, coming up Prince Harry is expected to be there to support his father King Charles on 
 
 his big day next month. Well, Harry's family tag along for the coronation. All that is coming up plus, Twitter CEO has some advice for him when it 
 
 comes to tweeting.

GIOKOS: Some new figures from the U.S. government show inflation is still cooling. The Consumer Price Index revealed that prices in March fell for 
 
 the ninth month in a row notably grocery prices were down for the first time since September of 2020 during the heart of the pandemic.
 
The index is an important gauge for the Federal Reserve as it tries to tame inflation by raising interest rates. Well, Twitter's owner Elon Musk has 
 
 made some deep cuts to the social media platform since taking it over last year. In a rare interview, Musk touches on what it's been like as an 80 
 
 percent of his staff.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hasn't been hard letting that many people go.
 
ELON MUSK, CEO, TWITTER: Yes. Not fun at all. It's painful.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you have any regrets for buying Twitter?
 
MUSK: My team was something that needed to be done.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I mean, you said earlier that -- -
 
MUSK: It's difficult you know, as I say that, like the pain level of Twitter has been extremely high. So hasn't been some sort of party. So, 
 
 it's been really quiet a stressful situation you know, for last several months.

GIOKOS: NPR just announced that they are suspending its use Twitter after they slapped the radio broadcaster with a controversial new label called 
 
 state affiliated media which is akin to propaganda outlets. NPR calls the label unacceptable as they are publicly funded by listeners.
 
Well, Buckingham Palace confirms Prince Harry will attend the coronation of his father King Charles III. It is set to take place next month at 
 
 Westminster Abbey in London. Harry will be attending solo, his wife Meghan will remain in California with a couple's two children.
 
The news comes after months of uncertainty over whether or not the pair would attend the coronation due to the fallout over their Netflix 
 
 documentary and Harry's bombshell memoir Spare. CNNs Royal Historian, Kate Williams joins us now live from Wales.
 
Kate, great to see you! I think we've all been asking that question in some way, you know, is Harry going to attend the coronation? And here it is. But 
 
 I guess many people are going to be asking why Meghan will not be attending. What are you reading into this?
 
KATE WILLIAMS, CNN ROYAL HISTORIAN: Harry is coming, we've heard today it was announced by Buckingham Palace at three o'clock that Harry was going to 
 
 come but Meghan would not come. She'd remain in California with Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet. Of course, it is Archie's birthday on May the 
 
 sixth. We understand that that's played into the decision.
 
But certainly, as you say, Eleni, there's been this endless controversy will Harry come? Will Meghan come? What's going to go on? And there was 
 
 actually a lot of people saying that they thought Harry and Meghan wouldn't even be invited, which I thought was, I mean, just ridiculous considering 
 
 that Harry is the king's son.
 
But it is clear that Harry and Meghan have been invited, but only Harry is coming. That's obviously going to be the case. It's only Harry. And we 
 
 understand that also it's going to be quite a short how he's just going to kind of pop in and out. He's not staying for all the extra banquets and all 
 
 the extra meet-ups before, so it's going to be a real flying visit from Harry to come around.
 
And so, I think that really what we're seeing here is that Harry is coming to this major event of his father's coronation. But he is not; it's not 
 
 going to be a family reunion. We're not going to see lots of big family meet-ups. Certainly, there has been damage done.
 
GIOKOS: If that's breaking news, you should answer the call case. You're -- OK, listen, listen, I think many people are going to be reading this, so I 
 
 think with we saw with the autobiography with Spare and the Netflix documentary, there are going to be a lot of questions around why Meghan 
 
 isn't attending.
 
You know, Harry's, what Harry's role is going to be. It is interesting to see that they've put you know emotions and feelings aside and Harry 
 
 attending. But do you think this is important show of unity for the family?
 
WILLIAMS: It is an important show of unity. And I think we all have to see what's going to happen in the coronation. What role is Harry going to have, 
 
 what will he be wearing? I know he'll probably want to wear military uniform that expect the King to be wearing military uniform. But Harry has 
 
 been denied that in previous occasions, is that going to happen now.
 <br>[11:55:00]
 
And there was a key part of the coronation at the end of the coronation, when what is seen as the peers do homage to the king, and certainly in the 
 
 Queen's coronation, the first to do that was her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh. So, we do expect in the king's coronation, Prince William to 
 
 come up very quickly to pay homage to the king.
 
Now, will Harry be doing that as well? Where will Harry be sitting? Will he be sitting at the front with William and with Catherine? Or will he be 
 
 sitting further back with the other dignitaries? And I understand that one of the reasons why it's been taking a bit of time for Harry's answer to 
 
 come as the Qatari had wanted certainty on these questions.
 
So, it is a big moment. It's a big family moment. Harry knows that the king wants in there, Harry wants to be there. Harry is so close in line to the 
 
 phone and his children are. But I think he's making it very clear that although he's coming, it's not that things have changed. And he still has a 
 
 lot of strong feelings about what has gone on before.
 
GIOKOS: Absolutely. There's a lot of emotion tied to this. Kate Williams, great to see you! Thank you so much for breaking it down for us.
 
WILLIAMS: Thank you for having me.
 
GIOKOS: Well, thank you so very much for joining us for "Connect the World". CNN continues after this short break. I'm Eleni Giokos in Dubai.
