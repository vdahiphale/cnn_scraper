THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR: Stay with CNN all night for more on this breaking news. And I will see you tomorrow. The news continues on CNN with one Mr. 
 
 Wolf Blitzer right next door in a place I like to call The Situation Room.
 
ISABEL ROSALES, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: It is 7:00 a.m. in Taipei, Taiwan, midnight in Paris, and 6:00 p.m. right here in Atlanta. I'm Isabel 
 
 Rosales in for Julia Chatterley. And wherever you are in the world, this is your "First Move."
 
A warm welcome to "First Move." Here's today's need to know. The Dow dives. U.S. stocks take a turn after the U.S. Fed cuts rates for the third time 
 
 this year. Tension in Taiwan. Taipei reports China's largest maritime deployment in decades. We'll have the latest. TikTok shock. How the Supreme 
 
 Court can save the social media app from a ban in the United States. And hitting the right note. Julia's interview with superstar pianist Khatia 
 
 Buniatishvili. That conversation and more coming up.
 
But first, call it an unwelcome holiday surprise from Jerome Powell and the Federal Reserve. Stocks on Wall Street fell sharply Wednesday after the 
 
 U.S. Central Bank cut its outlook for rate cuts next year from four cuts to just two.
 
Here's the damage for markets. The Dow and the S&amp;P fallen well over 2 percent. Tech stocks, the biggest loser, with the NASDAQ down 3.5 percent. 
 
 The Fed, as expected, cut rates by a quarter percentage point this time. But Fed chair Jerome Powell says stubbornly high inflation is likely to 
 
 stay the Fed's hand next year.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JEROME POWELL, CHAIR, U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE: We've had a year on projection for inflation and it's kind of fallen apart as we approach the end of the 
 
 year. So, that is certainly a large factor in people's thinking. I can tell you that might be the single biggest factor is inflation has once again 
 
 underperformed relative to expectations. It's still, you know, going to be between 2.5 and 3. It's way below where it was. But, you know, we really 
 
 want to see progress on inflation.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ROSALES: Richard Quest joins me live to explain all of this. Richard, good to see you. Real quick, why the shock move from Wall Street? Wasn't the 
 
 fall expected and priced in already?
 
RICHARD QUEST, CNN BUSINESS EDITOR-AT-LARGE AND CNN ANCHOR, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS: Yes, the cut in interest rates was expected, but what was not 
 
 expected is what you just heard then from Chair Powell, which is an admission that the work isn't over, and far from it, that the situation is 
 
 not where they would like it to be.
 
The trajectory has now stalled, inflation is -- to use the word that they say, is sticky, they can't get it down further. And the worrying part is 
 
 that it could be about to go back up again next year. So, the overall message from the Fed is not only job not done, but job could be getting 
 
 worse. And that was what not what the Fed was -- sorry, so, that's what not what the market was looking for. The market was hoping for, yes, yes, yes, 
 
 we're looking and we're going -- we're seeing what's happening. What they got instead was, we're worried.
 
ROSALES: Worried indeed. So, do you view this more of a rebalancing act or the sort of still a longer downward trend? How much time is needed here to 
 
 nail that soft landing?
 
QUEST: Well, the interesting part about that, and you've nailed it, is the -- you know, the problem is that the next administration, the Trump 
 
 administration, has an entire raft of policies that in one way or another will boost inflation and keep interest rates higher.
 
Tariffs and immigration deportations, that is going to put up inflation. And lowering taxes will increase the federal deficit, which will increase 
 
 borrowing. So, whichever way the Fed looks at it, next year, the Trump administration is going to make their inflation fight harder. And that's 
 
 what chair was saying today. That essentially, we are not in a position to continue where we were going -- 
 
ROSALES: All right. Richard -- 
 
QUEST: -- because we don't know what's going to happen next.
 
ROSALES: I'm so sorry to interrupt. We need to head to the Hill right now where House Democrats are speaking about that GOP-backed spending bill. 
 
 Let's listen in.
 <br>[18:05:00]
 
REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY), U.S. HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: -- disaster assistance to everyday Americans whose lives have been upended and turned 
 
 upside down as a result of hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, floods, and other types of extreme weather events.
 
We reached a bipartisan agreement to meet the needs of the American people and provide assistance to farmers, families, children, seniors, veterans, 
 
 men and women in uniform and working-class Americans. House Republicans have now unilaterally decided to break a bipartisan agreement that they 
 
 made. House Republicans have been ordered to shut down the government and hurt everyday Americans all across this country. House Republicans will now 
 
 own any harm that is visited upon the American people that results from a government shutdown or worse.
 
An agreement is an agreement. It was bipartisan and there was nothing more to say. Thank you.
 
ROSALES: All right. We're hearing from Hakeem Jeffries right there, the U.S. House Minority Leader, as Republicans are scrambling as that funding 
 
 bill is beginning to crumble. We'll have much more on that bill later on in the show.
 
Meantime, Taiwan is on high alert as it reports China's largest maritime deployment in decades. The island says, Multiple groups of Chinese naval 
 
 and Coast Guard vessels are moving around the Taiwan Strait. This comes after Taiwan's president visited Hawaii and the U.S. territory of Guam, 
 
 angering Beijing. China views Taiwan as its territory and opposes interactions between Washington and Taipei.
 
Joining us now is Kitsch Liao. He's an assistant to the president. Director of the Atlantic Council's Global China Hub. Kitsch, thank you so much for 
 
 joining us and offering your perspective here. The world, let's start with this, is used to seeing Chinese military exercises, but what is so 
 
 different about this military gathering beyond its scale, and what's the message being sent here?
 
KITSCH LIAO, ASSISTANT DIRECTOR, ATLANTIC COUNCIL'S GLOBAL CHINA HUB: Thank you. First of all, I think it's very important for us to think about the 
 
 fact that there has been no announcement, no pronouncement from the PRC regarding the silent ramp up. This is not how responsible powers are going 
 
 to behave. And China's aim for this exercise, even though they haven't called it this way, is to demonstrate its counter intervention capability 
 
 in the event of a Taiwan contingency, as in if they invade Taiwan.
 
Now, while gradually making Taiwan Strait its interior waters, what that means is, you know, basically they get to do whatever they want within 
 
 their territory. Now, for Taiwan, their response is a new one, because they try something basically like by calling Beijing out, proactive public 
 
 disclosure. Beijing is aimed to slowly erode this norm, and Taiwan is taking a page out of the U.S. playbook in Ukraine by calling them out, 
 
 preventing this step by step in a conduct raison strategy.
 
Now, there has been some unexpected fallout from that within the island, because, you know, Chinese military exercise did not eventually 
 
 materialize. So, some opposition, including some pro-China forces, has been accusing the government of basically using this as a political scheme.
 
ROSALES: Yes. And that's an unusual response there, Kitsch.
 
LIAO: Yes.
 
ROSALES: Can I ask has this crossed the line in your viewpoint or in any way significantly changed this already tense relationship between China and 
 
 Taiwan?
 
LIAO: I would say like basically this is a step-in escalation. Because as we were just talking about this, like, you know, it's not just that China 
 
 did not hold a military exercise, they did a silent ramp up and there's response within the island, and it plays exactly into what China's 
 
 cognitive warfare is doing, the three warfare, you know, cognitive, psychological warfare, legal warfare, and public opinion warfare. This is 
 
 what they eventually goes to basically use to coerce an enemy, an adversary population, in this case, Taiwan.
 <br>[18:10:00]
 
ROSALES: And China has said that Taiwan is at its core interest and has repeatedly warned the U.S. not to step into that conversation -- into that 
 
 conflict. Do you see -- how do you see the U.S. and its allies responding to this particular situation? Are they in a tough bind with this?
 
LIAO: This puts everybody in a very tough spot. I want to basically stress that China is the irresponsible party here. Yes, China has the right to 
 
 claim whatever they want, but the problem here is they are the one who's making the aggressive move without actually announcing their intent, and 
 
 testing the tripwire of the status quo on purpose, right? This is their way of shifting the environment and norms to create what favors them.
 
ROSALES: All right. Kitsch Liao, thank you so much for your time on this sensitive and complex issue. Much appreciated. Thank you so much.
 
LIAO: Thank you.
 
ROSALES: Meanwhile, a new report from the Pentagon says that a widespread anti-corruption campaign within the senior levels of the Chinese military 
 
 is impeding its push to build up its military by 2027. At least 15 high ranking military officials and defense industry executives were removed 
 
 from their posts last year, according to that report. China's President Xi Jinping has laid out an ambitious program to modernize the military by 
 
 2035.
 
China's President Xi CNN's Oren Liebermann is at the Pentagon. Oren, has this campaign against corruption had a profound effect on China's long-term 
 
 goals?
 
OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: It has, at least from the U.S. perspective. And this is a very interesting revelation in this latest 
 
 report from the U.S. called the China Military Power Report.
 
Normally, what we're looking for in here is the latest U.S. estimate, for example, on how many nuclear weapons China has and how its nuclear 
 
 modernization program is going, as well as the expansion of its military as it races to modernize there. And certainly, that's in here as well. 
 
 According to the U.S. in this report, China is still growing its nuclear forces and looking for about a thousand warheads by the year 2030.
 
But what was fascinating here was the focus on this anti-corruption campaign coming from Xi Jinping and the emphasis and the impact it's had 
 
 from the U.S. perspective on Xi's long-term goals. According to the U.S., Xi has made it a goal to be ready to invade and take over Taiwan by 2027. 
 
 It doesn't mean he's decided to do that, but that's the goal he's set out.
 
But because of all these firings, 15 high ranking military officers and defense industry leaders in the second half of last year alone, the U.S. 
 
 believes it has impeded China's push to get to that goal. Now, it doesn't mean they've stopped, they are certainly modernizing their forces. And we 
 
 hear quite a bit about that, but to do that, you need leadership. And that's where we see this anti-corruption campaign really taking out some of 
 
 the key leaders within China's military.
 
It focuses on China's rocket force, where it handles its nuclear and conventional missiles here, but it's beyond that, into its defense 
 
 industrial base as well, where we have seen that anti-corruption campaign claims some senior leaders there, including two former defense ministers 
 
 who were taken down by this anti-corruption campaign.
 
So, it's had a profound impact, and from the U.S. perspective, that means a slowdown in what has been a massive push by China and the People's 
 
 Liberation Army and the military there to try to be ready for the goals that Xi has set out. Crucially, the U.S. has had its eye on that 2027 
 
 marker where they believe Xi is trying to be at least ready for the idea of a takeover or a move against Taiwan. Isabel.
 
ROSALES: Again, an important conversation, and I know that you will keep us up to date on developments there. Oren Liebermann at the Pentagon, thank 
 
 you for your time.
 
We turn now to Moscow. A suspect from Uzbekistan is in custody a day after a deadly blast killed a senior Russian general. Russian state media has 
 
 published a video in which the suspect appears to confess to planting the bomb. Now, it's not clear if that confession was made under duress. Russian 
 
 investigators say the man was recruited by Ukraine's security service. CNN's Matthew Chance has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): On Russian TV, news that Moscow police have already detained a suspected 
 
 bomber. This 29-year-old Uzbek citizen, arrested in a village outside the capital, has now confessed, according to prosecutors, to planting the 
 
 explosive device that killed Igor Kirillov, one of Russia's top generals, and his assistant.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): During interrogation he explained that he was recruited by Ukrainian special services, then arrived in Moscow 
 
 and received an improvised explosive device. He placed it on an electric scooter, which he parked at the entrance of the apartment building where 
 
 Igor Kirillov lived.
 
CHANCE (voice-over): Video released by the Russian security services purports to show the suspect setting up a surveillance camera in a car 
 
 outside. The camera is said to have live streamed the attack to Ukrainian intelligence, which has indeed claimed responsibility for the killing.
 <br>[18:15:00]
 
The suspect's then shown on video, possibly under duress, saying he was promised $100,000 and a European passport for, in his words, pressing the 
 
 button.
 
But the bombing on the streets of Moscow is only the latest in a series of assassinations of prominent figures supporting Russia's full-scale invasion 
 
 of Ukraine. Starting with Darya Dugina, an outspoken advocate of the conflict and daughter of a pro-Kremlin nationalist, killed in a car bombing 
 
 in August 2022. Ukraine denied involvement.
 
But the shooting just last week of Mikhail Shatsky, a Russian missile developer outside Moscow, was orchestrated by Ukrainian intelligence, 
 
 according to a CNN source in Kyiv. As was the car bombing in November of Valery Trankovsky, a senior Russian naval officer in Crimea.
 
There have been numerous other killings too, as Ukraine steps up assassinations far from the frontlines, cementing a reputation.

ROSALES: The U.S. Supreme Court says it will rule on an impending TikTok ban. For years, lawmakers have argued that its parent company, ByteDance, 
 
 poses a national security risk. That is because it is based in China, giving Beijing influence over the app. That ban is set to go into effect 
 
 January the 19th. And while it has bipartisan support, that could change. President-Elect Donald Trump said this week that he has a, quote, "warm 
 
 spot for TikTok." Joan Biskupic has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JOAN BISKUPIC, CNN CHIEF SUPREME COURT ANALYST: Yes, major news at the U.S. Supreme Court today. In a First Amendment battle that could affect about 
 
 170 million Americans who use the TikTok platform. The nine justices have agreed to hear the company's challenge to a federal law that would be Ban 
 
 it from the United States. The court will hear the case on January 10th, and the justices will really be racing against the clock.
 
Under the disputed federal law. TikTok could be banned in America on January 19th. The controversy traces to last April when Congress passed and 
 
 Joe Biden signed a ban on the popular social media platform. The law was responding to years of concern in Washington that TikTok's Chinese parent 
 
 company posed a national security risk. The government argues that China could covertly manipulate the app to affect content and also to access 
 
 user's data.
 
TikTok Incorporated is an American company, but the ultimate parent is ByteDance, which has Chinese ownership. The TikTok platform would be banned 
 
 in the U.S. unless it is divested of that Chinese ownership. If that doesn't happen, TikTok would lose the opportunity to be available through 
 
 platforms and apps here.
 
TikTok has argued that the law unfairly singles it out and violates speech rights. The company lost in an important federal court below, an appellate 
 
 court, which said the federal government had made a good case on national security grounds.
 
We'll see whether the federal government can do the same before the justices. It will be the last major argument by the Biden administration at 
 
 the High Court. Again, the law is set to take effect in about a month on January 19th, which is a day before Donald Trump's inauguration and his 
 
 return to the White House.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ROSALES: Yes, there's a lot of interest with that one and people keeping close tabs on how the high court reacts and decides with that.
 
Straight ahead, executives, start your engines. The latest on the merger talks between Japanese auto giants Honda and Nissan. Will they end up 
 
 joining forces?
 
And later in the show, Julia's interview with superstar pianist Khatia Buniatishvili. She was a featured player at the re-opening of Notre Dame 
 
 earlier this month. How music and Mozart transformed her life. Plus, her surprise phone call with Chris Martin. Yes, Chris Martin of Coldplay. 
 
 That's coming up.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:20:00]
 
ROSALES: Welcome back. Topping today's Money Move, Asian markets could be in for a rough ride on Thursday after Wall Street's big drop. As we 
 
 mentioned earlier, the major U.S. averages fell sharply Wednesday. Look at all that red. After the U.S. Federal Reserve cut its outlook for interest 
 
 rate cuts next year. The Dow tumbling well over a thousand points. It has now fallen for 10 straight sessions.
 
The Central Bank challenges for Asia do not end there. And there, the Bank of Japan is out with its rate decision in a couple of hours. It is expected 
 
 to keep rates unchanged. Here's where Asian markets finished Wednesday. Chinese stocks finished in the green along with shares in South Korea, but 
 
 losses in Japan's Nikkei average. 
 
Japanese auto giants Honda and Nissan are discussing a potential merger. The automakers say they're exploring possibilities for collaboration and 
 
 leveraging each other's strengths. Now, no details offered on the timing of a possible deal, but CNN's Anna Stewart has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, for now, it's just talks, but Nissan investors were delighted just by the prospect of a Honda merger, sending 
 
 shares up more than 20 percent on Wednesday. Nissan has been struggling. Last month, it announced a major restructure, which involves cutting 9,000 
 
 jobs. It slashed its operating profit forecast for the year by 70 percent. And this would be another big chapter in Nissan's rather extraordinary 
 
 history.
 
From the 1990s, when Carlos Ghosn, then an executive with the French carmaker Renault, was credited with turning the company around with a 
 
 French-Japanese alliance, to 2018, when Ghosn was arrested in Japan for financial wrongdoing, which he has always denied, before escaping the 
 
 country as a fugitive. Nissan's share price has never recovered to the levels we saw under Carlos Ghosn. A merger could also be good for Honda.
 
Now, while it is around five times the size of Nissan, it faces challenges in transitioning to zero emissions. So, adding scale and synergies to the 
 
 mix, particularly in technology, would help. Not least with the likes of Tesla in the U.S. and BYD in China trying to dominate the EV market.

ROSALES: And turning now to the weather as the holidays approach, get ready for some topsy turvy temperatures. Here in North America, we can expect a 
 
 rollercoaster of warmth mixed with chilly Arctic air. Yes, head scratcher. Chad Myers joins me now from the CNN Weather Center. Chad, how should 
 
 people pack for the holidays?
 
CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Well, with a low of 14 in New York City coming up this weekend, pack as much as you can get in the carry-on or 
 
 anything that's warm. Now, it has been a warm fall. Don't get me wrong. A lot of these red dots here, the warmest fall on record, the orange dots, 
 
 top five, but it is going to get cold.
 
We expect it to be warm because since the '70s, we really have warmed anywhere between 1, 2, and even up to 3 degrees in some spots. But here's 
 
 what's happening, a cold north wind over the Hudson Bay all the way down into New York City, and this is the coldest air of the season so far now.
 <br>[18:25:00]
 
Now, it warms up by the end of next week, way back above normal again, but it's just going to be those little four or five day stretches that we're 
 
 going to see, New England, New York, back into Ontario and Quebec and even toward Atlantic Canada, very, very cold air.
 
New York City, 14 degrees. If Cousin Eddie is bringing his RV to your house, he's going to have to winterize because that 14 degrees will freeze 
 
 every pipe in that motorhome. Even Atlanta, very cold. Temperatures are going to be in the 20s there, that's much cooler than we should be this 
 
 time of year.
 
And kind of, you know, for Christmas, it's going to be cold, it's supposed to be, but if it's going to be that cold, wouldn't it be nice to snow at 
 
 least for effect? Not going to happen. By next week, well above normal. Back to what fall felt like all across the nation. Isabel, good to see you.
 
ROSALES: And just -- thank you. Good to see you. Just as I was hoping for a white Christmas here, you're dashing my plans there. Chad Myers, thank you.
 
MYERS: I'm the basher.
 
ROSALES: All right. More "First Move" right after this break, stick around.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ROSALES: Welcome back to "First Move" with a look at the international headlines making news this hour. In India, at least 13 people have died 
 
 after a ferry collided with a Navy speedboat. The crash took place near an island close to Mumbai. An investigation is still underway. However, a 
 
 local official said the speedboat's engine apparently stopped working.
 
And back to our top story. U.S. stocks plunged following the Federal Reserve's disappointing outlook. The Dow dropped more than 1,100 points as 
 
 it marked its longest losing streak since 1974. The Fed indicated it would cut rates only twice next year. Matt Egan has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MATT EGAN, CNN REPORTER: The Dow fell more than 1,100 points, suffering its longest losing streak since 1974. And would you believe this was all caused 
 
 by a couple of dots on a sheet of paper? It was. The Fed's so-called dot plot projected higher interest rates for next year than many had 
 
 anticipated, and the Fed also projected higher inflation than it did just a few months ago.
 <br>[18:30:00]
 
You put it all together, and this really spooked investors. Market veteran Art Hogan told me that this hit the market like a punch in the face.
 
And during the press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell, he made clear that they need to see more progress on inflation before they continue to 
 
 cut interest rates. And he also talked about how much uncertainty there is right now, not just on the stalled progress to fight inflation, but on the 
 
 incoming administration's policies, particularly around trade.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JEROME POWELL, CHAIR, U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE: The point about uncertainty is it's kind of common sense thinking that when the path is uncertain, you go 
 
 a little bit slower. It's not unlike driving on a foggy night or walking into a dark room full of furniture, you just slow down.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
EGAN: And so, that's what the Fed is signaling, a slower pace to interest rate cuts going forward. For investors, this is not sitting well. For Main 
 
 Street, the big takeaway here is the Fed believes the economy is strong, strong enough to withstand these higher interest rates for longer. And 
 
 borrowing costs, they're probably going to keep going lower, but perhaps not dramatically lower from here.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ROSALES: More now on the power struggle playing out on Capitol Hill. President-Elect Donald Trump, Vice President-Elect J. D. Vance, and Elon 
 
 Musk versus the Republican House Speaker, Mike Johnson. It is threatening to derail an agreement to fund the government into the spring. CNN's Manu 
 
 Raju has the very latest.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: This deal to try to keep the government open really had been worked on for weeks behind the scenes 
 
 with the top four congressional leaders. There are two Democrats that were involved, two Republicans that were involved, as well as the White House.
 
And ultimately, this deal was cut between those members and members of the critical Appropriations Committees in the House and the Senate. But after 
 
 this was released, it garnered significant Republican backlash, not just because of the spending levels and probably someone in deeper cuts but 
 
 also, some of the provisions that Johnson -- Mike Johnson, the speaker of the House, had to give to Democrats in order to get their support.
 
Remember in the House, which is nearly divided, they need Democratic support to get anything across to the Senate. The Senate is controlled by 
 
 Democrats. So, right now, at least up until January 3rd, when the new Congress convenes, and Joe Biden is still in the White House until January 
 
 20th, which means that there needs to be a bicameral, bipartisan deal.
 
But this deal that was reached, 1,500 pages. It was dropped on Wednesday -- last night, and they're trying to get it through Congress before the 
 
 deadline at 11:59 p.m. on Friday. That is a difficult deadline for them to reach just to get this bill across the finish line, let alone the 
 
 resistance they're getting now from the right.
 
But all throughout the day today, pressure began to build. Elon Musk, for one, came out and said that any Republican who votes for this should lose 
 
 their race. Donald Trump was quiet for most of the day, put out a statement late in the day saying that he could not support it. He bashed the 
 
 provisions in the deal, suggested it was a bad deal that Mike Johnson, the speaker of the House, cut. And also said that they should add an increase 
 
 of the national debt limit as part of this negotiation.
 
The debt limit is an incredibly fraught and complicated process. Something that typically takes months and months for Congress to resolve because no 
 
 one wants to vote to authorize more borrowing. Something that actually does not have to be even dealt with until the middle of next year. But now, 
 
 Trump is injecting it in part of the talks now. Why? Because he says he doesn't want to deal with it when he's president. He says Joe Biden should 
 
 deal with it now.
 
But by adding this demand late in the process, it is only going to increase the fears of a potential government shutdown, raise questions about what 
 
 the next steps are as Republicans are scrambling behind the scenes to try to figure out what's next, and Democrats are weighing how to respond to 
 
 this. But right now Democrats are saying pass the deal that they cut with the speaker of the House, who has now walked away from it amid Donald 
 
 Trump's opposition. Isabela.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ROSALES: And the stakes are incredibly high for Americans and the federal government workers as well. All right. CIA Director Bill Burns is expected 
 
 to soon join international mediators in Doha who are trying to broker a ceasefire and hostage deal for Gaza. But even amid cautious hopes that an 
 
 agreement may be reached, Israel is carrying out new deadly attacks in Gaza. Our Jeremy Diamond has more details from Jerusalem on what's at 
 
 stake.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT: Well, there is optimism in the air, significant diplomatic activity in the region, and a clear sense of 
 
 momentum towards a potential hostage and ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. But will there actually be a deal? That is indeed the question at 
 
 this moment, as we are seeing more a number of officials arriving in the Middle East to try and get this deal across the finish line.
 
The latest arrival in the region appears to be the CIA director, Bill Burns, who has been the top U.S. official in these negotiations for months 
 
 now. He often travels and arrives in the region at critical junctures in the process and this does indeed appear to be one of those critical moments 
 
 yet again, following visits by the National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan last week, President Biden's top Middle East adviser, Brett McGurk, also in 
 
 the region.
 <br>[18:35:00]
 
And of course, we've seen an Israeli delegation and Hamas delegations in both Cairo as well as in Doha, Qatar. And accompanying this flurry of 
 
 diplomatic activity, you also have the rhetoric. We've heard optimism from the Americans from the Israelis, from all sides, really, saying that they 
 
 believe that we are closer than ever to a deal.
 
Hamas also joining that optimistic rhetoric yesterday in a statement saying that they believe a deal is, quote, "possible." A Hamas source also saying 
 
 that the state of talks is, quote, "positive and optimistic," but they are also offering a note of caution, as so many others involved in the process 
 
 are as well. Hamas saying that a deal is possible as long as Israel does not continue to make additional last-minute demands in this process.
 
And all sides are really urging caution, even as they are sounding an optimistic note because we have seen so many times before these two sides 
 
 get very, very close to a potential agreement, but ultimately, a deal not falling through. But officials in the region believe that conditions are 
 
 now at their ripest for an agreement to actually take place. And there's no question that it is very much needed.
 
As we are watching in Gaza over the last 24 hours, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, 38 people have been killed, more than 200 
 
 have been injured. And of course, the humanitarian conditions in Gaza certainly not improving. Much needed aid would get in if a ceasefire were 
 
 to go in place. And then, of course, there are those 100 hostages still held in the Gaza Strip, about half of whom Israel believes are still alive. 
 
 Their fate, of course, also hanging in the balance.

ROSALES: -- a young pianist destined for greatness. Julia's interview with Khatia Buniatishvili just ahead. How a child prodigy from Georgia is making 
 
 her mark on the world of classical music. Her brand-new album of "Mozart Piano Concertos" has just been released too. All of that and more, just 
 
 ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ROSALES: Earlier this month, millions around the world rejoice when the renowned Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris re-opened following its devastating 
 
 fire just five years ago.
 <br>[18:40:00]
 
One of the superstar musicians invited to play at the re-opening celebration was Khatia Buniatishvili, a pianist from Georgia who has become 
 
 one of classical music's most brightest stars. Khatia is just out with new album of "Mozart Piano Concertos" in collaboration with the Academy of St. 
 
 Martin in the Field Orchestra. She talks to Julia about her rise to fame, the pro-E.U. street demonstrations still ongoing in Georgia, her dream 
 
 collaborations, and to begin the emotional re-opening of Notre Dame.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KHATIA BUNIATISHVILI, PIANIST: It was nonrealistic. It was magic. Because, you know, when it happened, when we saw fire around this magical building 
 
 that has been a cathedral that has been in our minds since our childhood, it seemed like something from our heart was burning. To see it revived and 
 
 existing again and realistic and we could physically touch and be there, it was absolutely magic moment.
 
JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN ANCHOR, FIRST MOVE: Yes, and hearing your music play as well, I think must have, you know, brought that reality to life as well. 
 
 To your point, because I know you started playing the piano at just three years old, but you really started playing publicly at six years old. If you 
 
 could go back and talk to that six-year-old and say, hey, one day you'd be playing at Notre Dame in front of a huge global audience, what would you 
 
 have said?
 
BUNIATISHVILI: I think I would have been the happiest person to imagine one day to be like in that building, like being as a part of the building. 
 
 Because the concert was done so that we were really in the heart of the building, and it felt really incredible humanly.
 
So, I guess that young girl, that young six-year-old girl would say that it's possible to make your dreams come somehow come true. It was never my 
 
 dream to play in the Cathedral of Notre Dame, but it was definitely my dream to leave something more than just a real-life, but something more 
 
 imaginary.

(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHATTERLEY: I think you bring your own magic to classical music in some way, but we'll talk about that. Because we have to go back even younger to 
 
 the three-year-old. For most people, and I put my hand up, because I took piano lessons when I was younger, even just doing the lessons felt like a 
 
 chore. It felt like I was being forced to do something. Did you just intrinsically love music and love playing the piano? And I think for people 
 
 out there, perhaps you want to encourage their own children perhaps to take on an instrument or to play. How do you find that joy even as someone so 
 
 young?
 
BUNIATISHVILI: I think it's related to who gives you opportunity to approach the instrument and how they do that. It's more about how.
 
For me, I guess my mother brought in a way that it was like a game. It was like part of our reality because my sister, my father, my mother, they were 
 
 there when I was born and piano too. So, it was like part of a family. And also, the way she was doing it, it was more like playful rather than an 
 
 obligation or a discipline in the beginning. Of course, it has become a discipline.
 
CHATTERLEY: And you're a mother now too, to a beautiful daughter, Charlotte. And I've seen a video where you're playing the piano, and she 
 
 almost looks like she's playing the piano, but on your arm. Does she also respond, I think, in the way that you did, even at this tender age, to the 
 
 beauty of music and what you're playing?
 
BUNIATISHVILI: Yes. Myself as a mother, I wouldn't tell her to do same thing as I do. And I -- most important thing for me is to give her choices 
 
 and that she can really choose what she wants to do. So, to propose her different, you know, variety of things and then she will decide what she 
 
 wants to do.
 
But I think it's good to be in a bath of music in general, but afterwards, it's up to her what she wants to do, absolutely.
 
CHATTERLEY: I think for your fans, what they'll notice is obviously your incredible skill, but also your passion, your style, the way you dress, the 
 
 way you present yourself, and then, when you see and read interviews with you, a degree of humility, even with all the gifts and the talents that you 
 
 have, but there's nothing humble about taking on Mozart.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
(MUSIC PLAYING)
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BUNIATISHVILI: Well, Mozart is my biggest childhood love. Exactly, when you spoke about the age of six and seven, that's when I discovered his Requiem. 
 
 It's also an influence of Milos Forman's "Amadeus." I think the movie "Amadeus."
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How good is he? This Mozart?
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BUNIATISHVILI: That somehow defined for me my perception of what a gift, musical, or human gift is.
 
CHATTERLEY: I think it's so poignant, because as you point out, I think it's part of your life journey and your history. I mean, you're so well-
 
 traveled now and you've seen the world, but you were a child in Georgia and that was a challenging time. We also see that the challenges now, it may be 
 
 difficult to talk about it and you can say if you'd prefer not to, but how does that -- 
 
BUNIATISHVILI: Oh, I should say -- 
 
CHATTERLEY: and your music -- please, yes, how does it resonate with what we see for you back home today?
 <br>[18:45:00]
 
BUNIATISHVILI: Well, Georgia's history is quite complicated, and unfortunately this one small but beautiful and very rich culturally and 
 
 historically country had to make a choice between most of the time of its existence between freedom and peace, even though those two things are our 
 
 values and human rights that should be given to any human being in any country.
 
But unfortunately, Georgia was always in a dilemma of making a choice and it was always hard. What we see today, it's painful because I see young 
 
 people, mainly it's the youth of Georgia that is on the streets. These are really sincere, genuine youth generation of Georgia that really made their 
 
 choice and they want to be part of the occidental western world, and they're simply expressing their wish, and they're simply showing that we 
 
 will fight for this freedom for our choice.
 
And it's simply heartbreaking to see that our citizens are somehow punished for their choice and punished for their will to show their opinion.
 
CHATTERLEY: Speaking of freedom of expression, and your collaborations go in all forms. We mentioned and we talked about Mozart, but can we also talk 
 
 about A$AP Rocky and Coldplay? What was it like to hear that Chris Martin was a fan and to get that call and say, hey, would you like to collaborate? 
 
 That must have been a day.
 
BUNIATISHVILI: Oh, my God. I couldn't believe it. I could not believe that it was Chris Martin on the phone. So, I said, no, it's not. You can't be 
 
 you. But it was amazing. Because he loves to, you know, searching different styles of music and he's very curious in, you know, looking for new sounds. 
 
 And he's always in the working process. And he's a he's an amazing musician.
 
So, A$AP Rocky was a little different. But I think also what we've done with him was very interesting music-wise, just to listen audio recording is 
 
 quite interesting. And it was mainly -- it's kind of a dark rap, but at the same time, there is some kind of subtleness of the sound. He likes to mix -
 
 - 
 
CHATTERLEY: If you could collaborate with anyone else, who would you pick in case they're watching?
 
BUNIATISHVILI: Oh, my God. This is so hard. Like -- well, my favorite that I love -- but it's too late. It's Freddie Mercury, Prince, and Nina Simone. 
 
 It's impossible. OK. We understood that. I also love women like Liza Minnelli and Barbra Streisand. I love those women there. So -- 
 
CHATTERLEY: Divas.
 
BUNIATISHVILI: Yes.
 
CHATTERLEY: True divas.
 
BUNIATISHVILI: Definitely two divas. From the young generation, I thought that Billie Eilish had something very interesting sound-wise and the 
 
 harmony-wise. I would say that.
 
CHATTERLEY: Wow. There you go. And hey, A.I. makes anything possible, I think.
 
BUNIATISHVILI: Yes. Thank you, Julia. You just started something maybe here.
 
CHATTERLEY: We could still get some of those collaborations.
 
BUNIATISHVILI: You give different dimension to my thoughts. Thank you.
 
CHATTERLEY: Exactly. There are no limits.

ROSALES: What a brilliant woman and a brilliant moment at Notre Dame. One can't help but wonder if this rising Franco-Georgian star is inspiring the 
 
 next generation to pick up an instrument.
 
All right. Well, coming up on first, move a high-profile clash between top players from two rival golf organizations and the prize, a whopping $10 
 
 million all of it in crypto. We'll have the details, next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:50:00]
 
ROSALES: Cubans have been celebrating an annual procession in honor of Saint Lazarus, a display of religious devotion which can be hard to watch. 
 
 They believe San Lazaro grants good health to those who are faithful. Some demonstrate that through physical suffering as Patrick Oppmann explains.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: This is one of Cuba's most important religious processions, the Day of Saint Lazarus. And behind me you see why. 
 
 People walking on their hands and knees. This person behind me on their back and suffering openly for their beliefs.
 
Some people here are Roman Catholics. Others believe in the Cuban religion of Santeria that's celebrated throughout Latin America and the Caribbean as 
 
 well as here in Cuba. And it is important for them to show their devotion. And they do that by sometimes going for hours, for miles, on their hands 
 
 and knees, scraping themselves up. You can see blood in certain patches on the ground.
 
Here behind me, this person here, an extreme example. On their back. You know, it -- this is very painful to watch, really. But for Cubans who are 
 
 enduring the worst economic crisis of their lives, this is a way to make an offering, to make requests to essentially a higher power. Something that's 
 
 not always been easy in communist run Cuba, but it is becoming more and more common. Cubans say that despite all the challenges they face at this 
 
 particular moment, they've not lost their faith.
 
Patrick Oppmann, CNN Havana.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ROSALES: And as a Cuban, I understand the importance of San Lazaro to its people. Patrick Oppmann, thank you.
 
$10 million in cryptocurrency, that is the prize PGA stars Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy just secured in high profile golf event called 
 
 The Showdown. They dominated the match against golfers Bryson DeChambeau and Brooks Koepka. Patrick Snell has those details. And I just butchered 
 
 those names. Patrick, help me out.
 
PATRICK SNELL, CNN WORLD SPORT: Isabel -- 
 
ROSALES: I'm sorry, if you guys are watching, golf is not my sport. Give me some hockey.
 
SNELL: Anytime, yes. Four big names from the world of golf. Thanks, Isabel. Yes, it was a really big night, I will say, for sports lovers in Las Vegas 
 
 on Tuesday over here in America.
 
Well, we had the NBA Cup Final playing out on the strip. Well, about just over 10 miles or so up the road, some of the world's best golfers facing 
 
 off. This was a really interesting event, actually. It was the Crypto.com Showdown, the made for TV event pairing the PGA Stars, Scottie Sheffler and 
 
 Rory McIlroy of Northern Ireland against the LIV Golf Stars, Bryson DeChambeau and Brooks Koepka.
 
Now, the PGA Stars really came flying out the gate. McIlroy had a wonderful putt here. Just look at this, Isabel. It's on the fourth. It's a big 
 
 breaking putt at two levels on that green for eagle, from absolutely brilliant. Just kept rolling and rolling and rolling and in.
 
Now, by the ninth, they had to play under the lights. But that didn't stop Scheffler one little bit. He revealed to us ahead of the event, he'd never 
 
 before played under the light. Scheffler's approach was just perfect. And the PGA Tour pair, well, they rolled out to the win in style, took them 
 
 just 14 holes. They take home $10 million in cryptocurrency.
 
Now, Scheffler, he's the number one male golfer in the world. He's now earned just over $62 million in winnings this year. Lauren Jbara from TNT 
 
 Sports speaking to Scheffler and company afterwards. Watch this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER, TWO-TIME MAJOR CHAMPION: I don't know a whole lot about crypto, but this is good motivation to do some research. Maybe ask Steve a 
 
 couple of questions to figure out what's going on.
 
LAUREN JBARA, TNT SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: We're ready for you. Guys, we're all just talking about how difficult it is to play under the lights. It's 
 
 cold out. All of the elements. How are you guys able to battle through it and come out with the win?
 
RORY MCILROY, FOUR-TIME MAJOR CHAMPION: Yes. Yes, I got cold pretty quickly, but obviously Scottie and I got off to a really good start. And 
 
 then, from there, it was just about trying to keep the momentum.
 
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU, TWO TIME MAJOR CHAMPION: I'd love to do more of these in the future. And I think it's great for the game.
 
JBARA: Yes. Brooks, same for you?
 
BROOKS KOEPKA, FIVE-TIME MAJOR CHAMPION: Yes. Listen, it's good for the fans. Like I said, unfortunately we didn't get to play. We didn't play that 
 
 good, but they played really solid. So, kudos to them. They played well and deserve that. But yes, hopefully, we get to run it back here soon.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SNELL: Well, we'll see. Isabel, you know, it's a really interesting occurrence there. The showdown was just like it exuded all this star power 
 
 because you've got these four world famous golfers from the rival tours, their Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, which funds the LIV Golf 
 
 Circuit. At this time, they continue to discuss a proposed merger with the PGA and the European-based tours as well. A framework agreement for which 
 
 was first announced in June of last year.
 <br>[18:55:00]
 
So, you can see these talks are taking some time. So, while all that's going on, you've got the two players from each side of the spectrum, if you 
 
 like, battling it out in Las Vegas trying to have some fun. It was quite the night. And I tell you what, Scottie Scheffler better get brushing up on 
 
 his cryptocurrency by his own admission. Back to you.
 
ROSALES: OK. Patrick Snell, flawless reporting there. Thank you so much.
 
All right. Well, China says it has broken the record for the longest spacewalk. Two of its astronauts stayed outside their capsule for nine 
 
 hours. Now, that beats the previous record set by the U.S. over 20 years ago. China wants to be a major player in the space race with plans to land 
 
 on the moon by 2030.
 
And finally, on "First Move." From shining stars up in space to movie stars right down here on Earth. The Academy has released 10 shortlists for the 
 
 2025 Oscar awards. Here's just a handful of the films under consideration in several top categories. Gangster musical Emilia Perez leads with six 
 
 potential nominations. And in second place --
