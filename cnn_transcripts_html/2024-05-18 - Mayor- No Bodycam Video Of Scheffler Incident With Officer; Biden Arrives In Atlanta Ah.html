JACQUELINE HOWARD, CNN HEALTH REPORTER: We already know about side effects like diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, those did emerge for some people, but those are side effects we already know about.
 
But over the four years, people who did lose weight, they were able to sustain the weight loss. So, these long-term effects, yes, they are important to watch over time, especially, we're now at a place where, at least 25,000 people are taking a Semaglutide each week. So -- 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
FREDRICKA WHITFIELD, CNN ANCHOR: That's amazing.
 
HOWARD: Yes, that's -- 
 
WHITFIELD: And especially, because it's very expensive.
 
HOWARD: Exactly.
 
WHITFIELD: Right? I mean, it's not necessarily -- within reach for a lot of people, but still, that number is significant.
 
HOWARD: Yes. And the cost is something that I'm sure we're going to hear more about overtime, as more people start taking these drugs.
 
WHITFIELD: Yes.
 
HOWARD: It costs about $1,000 a month without insurance.
 
WHITFIELD: Yes. All right. Jacqueline Howard, thanks so much.
 
All right. And a quick programming note tonight, join us for an intimate look at the pioneers inspired to help humanity and transform society for the best. "CHAMPIONS FOR CHANGE". That's tonight at 9:00 p.m. right here on CNN.
 
Hello, again, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me. I'm Fredricka Whitfield. And we're following significant new developments in the arrest of golfer, Scottie Scheffler. CNN has learned that there is no police body cam footage of the incident that led to the stunning Friday arrest of the world's number one men's golfer.
 
Scheffler says he was rattled by his arrest that he calls a real -- a big misunderstanding with police. It unfolded just before dawn yesterday outside the Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville, Kentucky.
 
Scheffler is accused of injuring an officer who tried to stop him from driving through the scene of a fatal traffic accident outside the club.
 
Scheffler was booked, put in jail temporarily, and is now facing four charges, including felony assault of a police officer.
 
We've got team coverage from Louisville. Patrick Snell is covering the tournament for us and Gloria Pazmino is looking at the investigation. Let's begin with you, Gloria.
 
You spoke with the mayor of Louisville about the incident and what are you learning?
 
GLORIA PAZMINO, CNN NEWSOURCE NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Fred, a significant development learning that there is no police cam video showing the full interaction between Scottie Scheffler and the officer who arrested him.
 
And the reason I say that's a key development is because this is boiling down to who is telling the right version of the story. We know Scheffler and his attorney have said this was all a big misunderstanding.
 
We know that Scheffler is, is cooperating with the investigation. He is been complimentary of police. But we also know that the police in their incident report said that Scheffler did not obey the orders of an officer that was at the site near the golf course, trying to direct traffic, following a car accident that had happened that morning.
 
He did not listen to the officer, he proceeded towards the entrance of the golf course. And it was during that moment that the officer was dragged, he was injured, and he was taken to the hospital as a result.
 
That's where Scheffler is getting the felony charge of assaulting a police officer. So, now, we're learning there is no footage of this interaction. There are other video angles from the area that the police are currently reviewing, but we do not have the beginning of the interaction.
 
Take a listen to the mayor speaking to us just a little while ago.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CRAIG GREENBERG, MAYOR OF LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY: The officer did not have a body cam footage turned on during the incident. We will release footage that we have. We do not have any -- to my knowledge, we have not yet had discovered any video of the initial contact between Mr. Gillis and Mr. -- Officer Gillis and Mr. Scheffler.
 
There is some footage from across the street of a fixed camera when Mr. Scheffer was being arrested. And we will release that footage in the coming days.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is officer wearing a cam, and it was not on or there was no cam (INAUDIBLE)?
 
GREENBERG: I don't have certainty on that answer. We will get certainty for you on that though when we released the footage that we do have available.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
PAZMINO: Now, Fred, I did ask the mayor whether he believes those charges against Scheffler should be dismissed. He said he didn't want to comment on that. I also asked him whether or not he is concerned that if the charges are dismissed, that it will send a message to the community here that certain people are treated differently by police, depending on their circumstances.
 
He did not want to get into all of that. He said he's going to let the criminal process play out here. And hopefully, we will be seeing some video released from the scene in the next several days. Fred.
 
WHITFIELD: OK, Gloria. Thanks so much for that. Let's check in with Patrick Snell there at the golf course.
 <br>[13:05:02]
 
So, despite Scheffler's arrest, he's done pretty well so far. How is it looking today?
 
PATRICK SNELL, CNN INTERNATIONAL SPORTS ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT: Yes, he really has Fred, very impressive, indeed. Quite incredible when you reflect on the chain of events that played out on Friday from stretching in his jail cell in the door, now, in the early hours of Friday morning to hotfooting it here to the golf club, and making his tee time, just about -- and really inspired by the energy feeding off the crowd, who were making a real show of support for him.
 
He had a couple of early birdies. And that really signaled the intent for his round, which was very impressive indeed, when you reflect on all he'd been through a fight under 66 on Friday for Scheffler to really power his way up the leaderboard. So, that was impressive in its own right.
 
But, as I said, it's all about golfers in their routines, Fred. They like creatures of habit, they like to stay in the zone. And Scheffler was very quick to do that after his round on Friday. And we saw this very powerful imagery from videos. We saw him interacting with the fans, he's very comfortable with the fans. He's always very generous with his time, he was signing autographs.
 
And also, the surprising imagery, surprising, yes, because he was actually talking with police officers as well. Maybe, we wouldn't have expected that given, as I say what had transpired earlier in the day.
 
And then after his round, typical Scottie Scheffler, not just his trademark resolute play, but taking time out to speak with reporters afterwards. And then, reflecting on all he'd been through, a lot of players would have just completely backed away from that, not even come set foot in the media zone. Scheffler did that.
 
He was very open. He was very honest at times. He was engaging, he was humorous, and he was especially thankful to be even playing on Friday. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER, RANKED WORLD NUMBER ONE AMERICAN PROFESSIONAL GOLFER: I definitely never imagined ever going to jail. And I definitely never imagined going to jail the morning before -- the one of my tee times for sure.
 
But, yes, like I said, I was -- I was grateful to be able to go out there and compete, you know. And, yes, it was definitely, it was -- it was a nice round of golf. My heart goes out to the family. But outside of that, yes. I'm glad to be out here competing and doing what I love.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SNELL: And Fred, Scheffler teeing off for his third round in just over 20 minutes from right now. Another change for him is he won't have his regular caddie on his bag. Ted Scott will not be on his back. He's attending his daughter's high school graduation. Instead, PGA Tour chaplain, Brad Payne will be on his back today, caddying for Scheffler. So, cool moment there for Brad Payne, Fred.
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Showing tremendous confidence in cool. All right. Patrick Snell, Gloria Pazmino, thanks to both of you. Appreciate it.
 
All right, happening right now. The two presumptive nominees for the White House are preparing for a pair of dueling campaign events. Former President Trump is set to speak in just a few hours at the National Rifle Association's Convention in Dallas, while President Biden is now in Atlanta, where he is holding several events in an effort to bolster support among black voters.
 
Biden will deliver a commencement address at Morehouse College tomorrow, but that visit is drawing criticism from some students who are at odds with the White House's handling of the war in Gaza.
 
Speaking to CNN, Morehouse's president says disruptions at tomorrow's graduation will not be tolerated.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DAVID THOMAS, PRESIDENT, MOREHOUSE COLLEGE: We will also not ask police to take individuals out of commencement in zip ties. If faced with the choice, I will cease the ceremonies on the spot if we were to reach that position. But this will not be a place where there will be a national photo op of individuals being taken out of the Morehouse campus in zip ties.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WHITFIELD: All right. That's the Morehouse president. CNN's Arlette Saenz is with us now here in Atlanta.
 
So, Arlette, I mean, it's not just Morehouse where the president will be making visits, but he has got a couple of campaign events this evening here in Atlanta. And then, of course, he'll be heading onto Detroit to speak at the NAACP dinner.
 
But at the core is, a focus that he wants to present, particularly in an outreach effort to black voters. What might be his message?
 
ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, yes. President Biden is trying to make this fresh appeal to Corp black voters, constituency that was key to his election back in 2020. But there have been some signs of narrowing in support from black voters towards Biden, when you take a look at recent polls heading into November.
 
So, part of the campaign and the White House has pushed this week is really trying to get President Biden in front of black voters talking to them about the issues that they think will -- the White House has helped advance and could help them as they're heading into that November election.
 
Now, President Biden did arrive in Atlanta a short while ago, he was actually greeted on the tarmac by some notable Morehouse alums, including Senator Raphael Warnock, also, the mayors of Birmingham, and another city in the south were also on hand for that event.
 <br>[13:10:08]
 
Both of those men were two people that the administration had actually talked to in preparation for the speech that Biden will give at Morehouse College tomorrow.
 
The White House has been very focused on trying to ensure that Biden is lifting up the graduating students. One person told me, he is going to be there as a commencement speaker and not as a foreign policy speaker. But it does come at a time when you have seen frustration from some on campus.
 
Some students, some faculty about the fact that he was invited to commencement due to his handling of the conflict in Gaza. In fact, the White House actually sent down a southern White House officials to meet one on one with a small group of students. I'm told about half of that meeting focused on the issues of Gaza, but also issues that they believe were of concern to students, including a concern among some that some of this attention could overshadow the fact that they are graduating this day.
 
But it's clear that the White House and campaign is acknowledging that they have more work to do with voters as they are trying to rebuild that coalition that helped get him to the White House back in 2020. WHITFIELD: Yes. It sounds like he's really tasked with trying to strike a balance on, you know, speaking about the relevance of you know, the current events. At the same time, he has to inspire because, you know, all the graduates and their families want to be inspired by a president's commencement visit. But not to be overlooked or the current state of affairs.
 
All right, Arlette Saenz, great to see you. Thanks so much.
 
All right, former President Trump, he is in Dallas today where he will speak this afternoon at the annual NRA convention. The gun rights organization has seen a major shake-up in recent months following a series of scandals.
 
CNN's Steve Contorno is in Dallas for today's speech. So, Steve, good to see you. So, with all the controversy surrounding the NRA, how influential might this event be?
 
STEVE CONTORNO, CNN REPORTER: Fred, there is no question that the NRA is not the same organization that endorsed Donald Trump for president eight years ago. It has been rocked by scandals, financial mismanagement, leadership, shakeups, and we're talking to some Republican strategists, one of them told us, "I haven't heard anything about the NRA since I literally can't remember when. I just think they're not relevant anymore."
 
Now, the question is, though, can this organization still help Donald Trump and the Trump campaign believes that it can. His organization has been meeting with political operatives for the NRA as part of this broader outreach to conservative groups, trying to get all their ducks in a row before the summer and fall.
 
And -- but to the degree to which they can help is still in question. This organization gave Donald Trump or supported Donald Trump to the tune of $30 million in the 2016 election. It is not clear they have nearly that kind of money to spread around this cycle. But Donald Trump is coming here today to reaffirm that he is a strong Second Amendment supporter. He has previously told this organization that he would unravel all the policies that Joe Biden has done over his four years in office.
 
And look, this is an area where there's a lot of contrast between the current administration and the -- and President Trump. He is someone who has said he wants to undo everything Biden has done, Biden has said. He will go even further and push for an assault weapons ban.
 
So, this is something that's going to be a major talking point throughout the campaign and we're going to hear from Donald Trump later day for his pitch to voters in 2024.
 
WHITFIELD: All right, Steve Contorno in Dallas. Thanks so much.
 
All right. Still to come, exclusive video obtained by CNN shows Sean Diddy Combs physically assaulting his then-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura during a 2016 altercation. New reaction from the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[13:18:26]
 
WHITFIELD: The shocking video exclusively obtained by CNN that appears to show Sean Diddy Combs hitting and kicking his then-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura inside of a hotel back in 2016, now, has the attention of the Los Angeles Police Department.
 
In a statement from the department, they say they are aware of the video. They go on to say, "There is not an open LAPD investigation involving Mr. Combs."
 
The Los Angeles D.A. is also reacting. Saying, "If the conduct depicted occurred in 2016, unfortunately we would be unable to charge as the conduct would have occurred beyond the timeline where a crime of assault can be prosecuted."
 
CNN's Elizabeth Wagmeister walks us through her exclusive reporting, and we have to warn you what you're about to see is disturbing.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ELIZABETH WAGMEISTER, CNN ENTERTAINMENT CORRESPONDENT (voice over): New surveillance footage obtained exclusively by CNN appears to corroborate some of the allegations of abuse against music mogul, Sean Diddy Combs.
 
The video captured on multiple cameras, shows Combs wearing only a towel, assaulting his then-girlfriend Cassie Ventura in a hallway at a Los Angeles hotel in March 2016.
 
A lawsuit filed by Ventura in November last year and settled the next day referenced actions that seem to match those seen in this video. There is no audio.
 
According to the complaint, Combs became extremely intoxicated and punched Ms. Ventura in the face, giving her a black eye, which, according to the lawsuit, prompted Ventura to try and leave the hotel room.
 
The surveillance video obtained by CNN begins as she enters the hallway.
 <br>[13:20:04]
 
The complaint says, as she exited, Mr. Combs awoke and began screaming at Ms. Ventura. He followed her into the hallway of the hotel while yelling at her. The complaint goes on to say, he grabbed her and then took glass vases in the hallway and threw them at her.
 
In the surveillance video, Combs can be seen grabbing Ventura and throwing her to the ground. As Ventura lies on the ground, Combs then kicks her twice and attempts to drag her on the floor back to the hotel room. Ventura is seen picking up a hotel phone. Combs seems to walk back to the hotel room, then returns and appears to shove her in a corner. Moments later, he can then be seen throwing an object in her direction.
 
According to Ventura's now settled lawsuit, the pair began dating several years after they met in 2005. They parted ways in 2019.
 
Combs attorney said the decision to settle was in no way an admission of wrongdoing. Ventura declined to comment on the video, but her attorney told CNN, "The gut-wrenching video has only further confirmed the disturbing and predatory behavior of Mr. Combs. Words cannot express the courage and fortitude that Ms. Ventura has shown in coming forward to bring this to light."
 
The video hasn't been seen publicly before and comes on the heels of a series of civil lawsuits alleging Combs' involvement in sex trafficking and sexual abuse, allegations that Combs has repeatedly denied.
 
Authorities searched Combs' homes in Los Angeles and Miami in March, as part of an ongoing federal investigation carried out by a team that specializes in human trafficking crimes.
 
In a December 2023 statement, Combs responded to the claims in some of the lawsuits, saying, "Sickening allegations have been made against me by individuals looking for a quick payday. Let me be absolutely clear. I did not do any of the awful things being alleged."
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
WAGMEISTER (on camera): Clearly, very disturbing footage and violent actions that we are seeing coming from Diddy, who up until this point has denied many of these allegations from all of these lawsuits that he is facing.
 
Aside from this lawsuit from Cassie, which he settled back in November 2023, he is facing five separate lawsuits and he has been fighting back through his lawyers.
 
In fact, just last week, we reported on a motion that he filed to dismiss a lawsuit from a Jane Doe that claim she was 17 years old, a minor at the time of her allegations in just a few days before that, he filed a motion to dismiss a portion of an entirely different claim.
 
It will be interesting to see now how this may impact all that Diddy is facing. But we have yet to hear directly from him.
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Thank you so much.
 
For some legal perspective now, I'd like to bring in entertainment attorney Tre Lovell. Hi, Tre. So, this is pretty significant, isn't it? Just to see the graphic nature of this video. While we heard from LAPD and the L.A. District Attorney's Office, there are not likely to be any criminal charges because of the statute of limitations.
 
Do you see that this video will impact other civil cases that are ongoing?
 
TRE LOVELL, ENTERTAINMENT AND BUSINESS ATTORNEY, LOS ANGELES: It may, in a couple of ways, in terms of trying to promulgating other people to come out, maybe, there is other video footage out that may be relevant to the other cases, but from an evidentiary perspective, probably not.
 
With respect to the other civil cases, you know, to the extent this is a prior bad act, as we experienced through the Weinstein reversal. This evidence probably wouldn't come in, in those cases.
 
With respect to the homeland security federal criminal investigation, that seems to be kind of more bigger picture, sex trafficking, rape, more kind of alleged lifestyle. This may be a smaller component.
 
But from an evidentiary perspective, probably not. But certainly, from the court of public opinion.
 
WHITFIELD: How might this be a component of an investigation that correlates with the raid that we saw on his L.A. and Miami homes?
 
LOVELL: Yes. So, that raid, they are focusing on, on a number of things. Sex trafficking, rape, assault, criminal abuse, criminal assault, things like that, that kind of emanated, I believe from the -- from the civil lawsuits. It -- that's what kind of put this on the map for the federal government to step in.
 
And as they are doing their investigation and come up with evidence, you know, this will kind of fit into their theory that hey, you know, this is kind of a lifestyle that, that he lived. This is not a one instance, a one off. This is just part of the big picture, you know, allegedly that he lived.
 
WHITFIELD: This obviously further complicates things for his defense attorneys in these civil cases. How might they respond to this ultimately or will they refrain from responding and just wait until the civil litigation matter -- net process gets underway?
 <br>[13:25:11]
 
LOVELL: Well, it's interesting. They may refrain from responding. It's part -- it's possible that during Cassie's civil cases settlement, and you know, there was initially to confidentiality that they may -- there may have been non disparagement provisions, which means either party cannot come out and talk about it about the other.
 
So, that may contractually prevent them from really discussing this. But besides that, you know, when you have a video like this, there is a couple of ways to handle it. First, you can try to explain, it's hey, you didn't see what happened before. You know, it was really bad it led to this.
 
I don't think that's going to work in this case, the video kind of stands on its own because it's so disturbing. And besides that, you kind of distanced itself. So, this, you know, we had a relationship with Cassie, we had issues, but this had nothing to do with any my other situations and the other allegations.
 
They are going to try to distance it and really kind of segregated put it in its own room.
 
WHITFIELD: Yes, no matter what. That's a tough one to justify. Tre Lovell. Thank you so much.
 
LOVELL: Oh, yes.
 
WHITFIELD: Yes, I mean, it's tough.
 
Tre Lovell, thank you so much.
 
All right. Last hour, President Biden arrived in Atlanta for a weekend aimed at shoring up support from black voters. The president of the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, who met with Biden yesterday joins me live next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[13:30:50]
 
WHITFIELD: All right. It's a critical weekend for President Biden as he looks to secure support from a critical voting bloc ahead of the 2024 election. 
 
Black voters propelled him to the White House four years ago. But polls show that support has eroded among some during his time in the Oval Office. 
 
This week, the Biden campaign is making a concerted effort to reenergize that support, speaking tomorrow at the commencement of Morehouse College and attending an NAACP dinner in Detroit. Morehouse College in Atlanta. 
 
On Friday, President Biden spoke at the Museum of African-American History and Culture and held an Oval Office meeting with leaders of the Divine Nine, a group of -- that is the nine historically black fraternities and sororities that are on campuses across the country, 
 
Joining me right now, one of the people who attended that meeting. Danette Anthony Reed is the president and CEO of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, AKA, Incorporated International 
 
And, Danette, I am not an AKA. I just happened to wear the green, but now we're coordinated with your AKA pink and green colors. Purely coincidental. 
 
DANETTE ANTHONY REED, CEO, ALPHA KAPPA ALPHA SORORITY INCORPORATED INTERNATIONAL: And it looks good on you. 
 
WHITFIELD: Thank you so much. 
 
So the relationship between this White House and the Divine Nine has been deepening since the 2020 campaign. The vice president, as a member of your sorority, AKA. How have you seen the benefits coming from this commitment, this relationship? 
 
REED: Well, here's a couple of things. First, thank you for having me on, Fredricka.
 
But one of the things that I would say is significant. This is the first time that the Council of Presidents of the Divine Nine had been invited to the White House, to sit in the Oval Office, to be able to share with the president and the vice president the issues and concerns of blacks in America and represent our constituents.
 
WHITFIELD: And what were some of the concerns that were discussed in yesterday's meeting? What did you help convey, other leaders of the fraternities and sororities that were represented there, what was conveyed? And what was the information you got in return?
 
REED: We talked about what President Biden -- I think he understood is the significance of black Americans as an important voting bloc. So we talked about that.
 
And we talked about how Alpha Kappa Alpha and the other Divine Nine have been very and have always at a standing commitment to social justice and activism.
 
And what we have is all social pillars, are pillars to make sure that we impact our organizations and the communities. 
 
So what do I mean when we talk about pillars? We talked about that we try to educate our members and the community on what the -- the opportunities and choices are out there. 
 
We make sure that we register them and get them set to vote. And then also we make sure we mobilize. We create community mobilization to go out and make sure that we get the vote. And that we all understand what's coming for us or what the candidates are bringing to us.
 
WHITFIELD: So in 2020, Harris' nomination attracted hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from black sorority and fraternity alums. You know, with many of Harris' sorority sisters sending $19.08, a call back to the year AKA was founded.
 
Is that still happening with that kind of veracity and pace for this 2024 election?
 
REED: You know, Alpha Kappa Alpha, as a whole, is nonpartisan. But members have a choice to support those candidates that they choose. And quite a few are choosing to support. And they can choose to do $19.08 or any dollar value that they want to do. They might do $1,908.
 
But each support makes a difference and it's their choice on which way they can go. 
 <br>[13:35:04]
 
Our biggest thing is make sure that we focused on soaring to the polls, that they get out, understand what's going on. Because we're in the education phase now. That's the phase we're in now.
 
We're making sure that our members and our community members understand what each of the different parties bring to us.
 
WHITFIELD: The president will be at Morehouse College tomorrow for the commencement address. And as you know, there were a lot of students who were not happy with the decision. And have also taken the position that some of those students are not happy with the position of the White House on the war on Gaza, among other things. 
 
What do you believe the message from the president needs to be tomorrow to appeal to the Morehouse graduating men. He's also speaking to their parents, their grandparents. 
 
Because, you know, I have to borrow from our friend, Errol Louis, louis this morning, who reminded us of so many graduations at HBCUs are really like family reunions. 
 
I mean, I'm a graduate of Howard University, so I know exactly what he's talking about and what that feels like. 
 
But what might be your advice to the president tomorrow as he tries to engage with the Morehouse college community? 
 
REED: I think there's two pieces to that. He needs to make sure that he listens. Listening to understand what their concerns are. 
 
And then make sure that it's a multi-generational answer. Because like you said, it's not only those who are graduating, but it's also their parents and grandparents.
 
I think what he asked to do, as I said, we're in the education phase, is two pieces. He needs to simply explain what he has done. And then go back and say, if he's reelected, what he will do because he understands the concerns and issues of black Americans. 
 
Those are the key things that I think he has to do.
 
WHITFIELD: Danette Anthony Reed, president and CEO of AKA, thank you so much for being with us this afternoon.
 
REED: Thank you for inviting us. And let me tell you, it was a very informative meeting. And the group of the Divine Nine, we all agree we will work together.
 
Thank you. 
 
WHITFIELD: Wonderful. Thanks so much in that.
 
All right. Still to come, following a terrifying storm that left a large swath of the Houston area without power. And people there will now have to deal with soaring temperatures.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[13:42:09] WHITFIELD: All right, after a powerful storm left a trail of destruction across Houston Thursday, the city announced that the intense conditions resulted in more than 100,000 gallons of sewage spilled out across three different locations. 
 
Public works officials assured residents that drinking water from the city of Houston remains safe. It's the latest hurdle for the region as they race against today's severe weather. 
 
CNN senior national correspondent, Ed Lavandera, has more from Houston.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It might be tornado season, but the storm system that ripped through southeast Texas on Thursday evening left damage that was more reminiscent of a hurricane. 
 
This is a popular dance club in downtown Houston. The winds were so ferocious, hurricane-strength winds that ripped through here, it ripped away the back wall of this dance -- dance club, dropping almost three stories worth of bricks onto a parking lot and crushing a car here. 
 
The devastation and the damage throughout downtown Houston has been extensive. Windows blown out from high-rise buildings. Several people killed by falling trees. And a crane that was blown over. As I mentioned, there was hurricane-strength winds. 
 
And now city officials are saying that it could be several weeks before power, electrical power is fully restored across Harris County here in Houston and many parts of southeast Texas.
 
At the peak, it was nearly one million people who were left with power. And the bulk of that it will take to get those people back online, we are told, is going to take several days.
 
And now officials are saying it could be several weeks before all of the power is restored. It'll be kind of in the days after Hurricane Ike, a terrible hurricane system that struck here in the Houston area years ago. 
 
And as I mentioned, this has been a deadly storm. The ferocious winds that ripped through here were incredibly intense, especially in the downtown area of Houston. But we have seen the powerlines, trees. The devastation really just kind of extensive. 
 
But what is coming this weekend is also rather troubling. With so many people out of power, the temperatures are supposed to go up and the heat index is approaching 100 degrees this weekend. 
 
So that combination, with tens of thousands of people without power, will make it very different -- very difficult time here in the Houston area as well as many parts of southeast Texas. 
 
Back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Thank you so much, Ed Lavandera, in Houston.
 <br>[13:44:38]
 
All right, when we come back, the inspirational story of one of Howard University's newest graduates, that shows us age is nothing but a number.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
WHITFIELD: All right. It's never too late to follow your dreams. And one of Howard University's newest graduates is proof positive of that. 
 
At 83 years young, Marie Fowler -- there she is -- becoming the most- senior member of this year's graduating class at Howard University. She received her Doctorate in Divinity more than 60 years after earning a bachelors and two masters degrees.
 
Joining us right now, Dr. Marie Fowler. 
 <br>[13:50:01]
 
Dr. Fowler, welcome. Congratulations. 
 
MARIE FOWLER, 83-YEAR-OLD DOCTORATE GRADUATE, HOWARD UNIVERSITY: Thank you so much, Fredericka, Thanks for having me. 
 
WHITFIELD: Oh, this is fantastic. 
 
So wait a minute. A bachelors wasn't enough, two masters not enough, and then you decided, why not, I'm going to go ahead and pursue this doctorate.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
WHITFIELD: What inspired you to do this?
 
FOWLER: You know, my father was an inspiration to me growing up because -- because they could not read and write and he always said to me, to all of us a mind is a terrible thing to waste. And because he could not and my mom could not, that was no reason that I could not succeed. 
 
WHITFIELD: Wow.
 
FOWLER: Even though I -- after this was after I had done 35 years with the federal government, retired, and then I had this calling to pursue a deeper growth with that, with God.
 
So I enrolled in Maple Springs Baptist Bible College and pursued my degree. I got my undergrad, my bachelors. Then went ahead and got the masters and then Masters of Divinity. So why not do doctorate that --
 
(CROSSTALK) WHITFIELD: Why not? Why not? Well, I love you heard your calling. 
 
And so when you made that decision to say, OK, I'm going to step back into the classroom, what has that experience been like, being back in the classroom, being with fellow students who you could teach a thing or two, but you are all learning at the same time? 
 
What was that experience like? 
 
FOWLER: At the beginning, it was kind of challenging. Because I did not have a discipline for study. So I had to acquire that.
 
And when -- when I registered at Maple Springs, I asked God that to help me because -- it was almost as if I was having a conversation with him. And I said, God, you know that I do not have a discipline for study. You know, so get (INAUDIBLE) out since 1959. 
 
So since you are sending me to learn more about you, then you're going to have to help me. And I was very specific what I wanted.
 
I said, God, you're going to help -- you going to have to help me have the ability to steady, also open my mind so that I can receive and decipher information, and also be able to interpret what it is that the instructors and the Bible would be saying to me. 
 
And I can tell you, Fredricka, all of those things, it happened. I was the oldest -- I was the oldest in every class. 
 
WHITFIELD: Yes. 
 
FOWLER: And older than most of my professors and older than all of my professors at Howard.
 
WHITFIELD: Oh, that is so great. 
 
But my goodness, your vitality. I mean, you are just simply -- and because you are so unstoppable, I have to ask you what's next. Because something tells me, Dr. Marie Fowler, there's a next for you.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
FOWLER: There is -- there is a next. Trust me, I am not looking for employment. But what -- what I -- what I plan to do is, you know, to grow deeper in my church. And I want to write a book about my experience and share my knowledge, share knowledge of God with other people. 
 
There is absolutely no reason that -- that after doing all of this, that I keep all of this knowledge to myself. So I intend to share it through different programs, maybe speaking, et cetera, with those who are willing to listen and so that they can learn what I have. 
 
Because I don't want anyone to not be able to understand what the Bible is saying. The Bible is not a book to be afraid of. And I want to share that knowledge with those who were like me at one time, trying to read the Bible. And as you know, Fredricka, I'm sure that you have read the Bible at one time or another, where you say, my god, all the -- these are the thousands of the begets and all of that.
 
WHITFIELD: Yes.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
WHITFIELD: It can be very intimidating.
 
FOWLER: Very intimidating. Very intimidating.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
WHITFIELD: Well, Dr. Murray Fowler --
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
WHITFIELD: -- this has been such a pleasure. 
 
FOWLER: Yes.
 
WHITFIELD: And everyone who will continue to grow and be inspired by you, I mean, what a gift it will be. 
 
So all the best to you. Congratulations, again. You're now my fellow Howardite, so I loved that, too. Thank you so much. 
 
FOWLER: Well, thank you. You know. 
 <br>[13:54:59]
 
WHITFIELD: Yes, you know. But hey, I'm a slouch. I only have one degree. But you know what, I look to you. I'm so inspired. 
 
Dr. Murray Fowler, thank you so much. 
 
FOWLER: Thank you.
 
WHITFIELD: All the best. 
 
We'll be right back.
