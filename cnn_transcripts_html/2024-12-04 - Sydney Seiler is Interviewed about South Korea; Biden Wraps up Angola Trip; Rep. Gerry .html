SYDNEY SEILER, SENIOR ADVISER, CSIS KOREA CHAIR: The vote on the - I mean, sorry, not impeachment, on the martial law. As soon as that vote on the martial law took place, President Yoon rescinded the order.
 
So, we see here, this is not a man who's trying to seize power or, you know, create a second term or prolong his rule. He is using a very unusual tool, as it were, in order to try to, you know, from the opposition's perspective, undermine democracy. From the ruling party's perspective, trying to get the ball moving. He probably thought he had much more support within the ruling party for his actions than he actually did. And that is, of course, what enabled the - the order to be overturned so quickly.
 
KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR: So, the - what's happening inside South Korea, a key U.S. ally, is critical to the United States. But also taking it a step, I don't know, more 30,000 foot view, you spent 40 years in government dealing with North Korea. What does North Korea see in this?
 
SEILER: North Korea is rejoicing. I think, you know, it's clear that over the past few years North Korea has been extremely unhappy with President Yoon. His strong position on countering the North Korean nuclear capability with strengthening of the U.S./South Korea alliance, strengthening our nuclear deterrent, having a larger say for South Korea in nuclear planning. In many ways, President Yoon has been, you know, just a thorn in the side of Kim Jong-un. And so I expect in the coming days, and we'll see rhetoric playing up the failure of President Yoon, the lack of public support, the fact that, you know, North Korea was right all along, this is not a guy worth dealing with. 
 
I don't think North Korea would take the step of - of seeking some type of provocative action that would try to exploit the current situation because such provocative action would just play into Yoon's hands. It would reinforce - if you recall, this whole martial law was introduced by President Yoon as - as necessary because of a North Korea threat. North Korea trying to take advantage of the situation at that time would undermine, you know, everything else they're focused on.
 
BOLDUAN: Sydney Seiler, thanks for coming in. Really appreciate it. Coming up for us, multiple, large drones spotted flying over New
 
 Jersey. Now, the FBI is getting involved.
 
And, an incredible rescue is caught on camera. Deputies rescuing two children from the - from the backyard of a burning home.

JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: This morning, President Biden is wrapping up his historic visit to Angola. Today he's focused on a railway project that the U.S. and Europe are both backing. 
 
Let's get right to CNN White House correspondent Arlette Saenz, who's been traveling with the president back in Angola this morning. 
 
What's the latest?
 
ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, John, President Biden is spending his - the last day of his first and only trip to Africa, a trip that really has been overshadowed by President Biden's own pardon of his son, Hunter, and then that - by that unexpected turmoil in South Korea. 
 
But for President Biden's part, he is trying to put the focus right back on why he came here, to tout that infrastructure investment by the U.S. and European allies into something that's called the Lobito Corridor. This is an 800-mile unfinished railway project that's aiming to transfer critical minerals from interior countries in Africa to the ports for exports. Exports that could also go to the United States. 
 
Senior administration officials say that this is really a test case for their strategy here in Africa. What Biden has been trying to do is find areas to invest in and specific projects to help those countries there. And they hope that this is going to serve as a playbook for future administrations in Africa.
 
It all comes as the U.S. has really tried to counter some of China's influence in the continent. China has spent the past ten years investing hundreds of billions of dollars into infrastructure projects across the continent through its belt and road initiative. Really leaving the U.S. and other countries to catch up. But President Biden, over the course of yesterday and today, did take
 
 some veiled swipes at China, as they really believe that this Lobito Corridor presents an alternative to African countries from what China has provided so far. 
 
Take a listen to that moment from earlier today.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: And I want to be clear about something. All of these projects investments are designed to have high impact and meet the highest standards for workers, for the environment and for the communities. Because the United States understands how we invest in Africa is just as important as how much we invest in Africa.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SAENZ: Now, the president made those comments as he was meeting with the leaders of four countries who are part of that corridor. That's Angola, Zambia, Tanzania, and also the Democratic Republic of Congo. This is the final event for President Biden. We will next see him as he is departing to return to Washington, D.C. But President Biden, in this trip, fulfilled a two year promise to visit the continent of Africa, of Sub-Saharan Africa, I will say. 
 <br>[08:40:02]
 
He - in many ways there were some frustrations that perhaps there were other foreign priorities that had arisen. When you think about the conflicts in Ukraine. Think about the conflict between - or playing out in the Middle East involving Israel. But for President Biden's part, he wanted to make this trip, which could be the final foreign trip that he is taking as president. 
 
BERMAN: Yes, even so, probably overshadowed by events that did not have to do with Angola. 
 
Arlette Saenz, who has been there for us. Thank you so much for reporting on this. 
 
Kate.
 
BOLDUAN: This just in. Pete Hegseth's mother just sitting down for an interview, sitting down on Fox News. You remember, she made headlines this week when a 2018 email that she had written to her son was published in "The New York Times." It's an email that read, in part, this. "On behalf of all of the women, and I know its many, you have abused in some way, I say, get some help and take an honest look at yourself." 
 
That has made a lot of news, as we know, in which - because his nomination to be the next defense secretary is in peril right now. 
 
She just sat down on Fox News explaining that email. 
 
Listen.

PENELOPE HEGSETH, MOTHER OF PETE HEGSETH: Going through - Pete and his wife at the time were going through a very difficult divorce. It was a very emotional time. And I'm sure many of you across the country understand how difficult divorce is on a family. There's emotions. We say things. And I wrote that in haste. I wrote that with deep emotions. I wrote that as a parent. And about two hours later, I should - I should - my husband tells me I should think through things a little bit more. But Pete and I are both very passionate people. I wrote that out of love. And about two hours later, I retracted it with an apology email, but nobody -
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOLDUAN: There you go. 
 
Joining me right now to talk about this and much more is Democratic Congressman Gerry Connolly. 
 
Congressman, thank you for coming in. 
 
REP. GERRY CONNOLLY (D-VA): Good to be here.
 
BOLDUAN: We've got a lot to discuss, but this just came through. This nomination is an important one. And this nomination for - to - for Pete Hegseth to be the next Defense secretary is in real question right now. 
 
What do you think of what you heard from - well, now we see kind of a - I don't know if we can call it a campaign, but we know that Pete Hegseth's mother is now going out to appeal to Donald Trump on Fox News to say, we believe in him and you should as well.
 
CONNOLLY: Well, you know, one can sympathize with maternal love and concern for a son, but I think all of us are struck by the fact that, whether the email she's referring to that she wrote her own son was written in haste or not, how many of us have received an email like that from our mothers? I never did. And so something very serious was going on, beyond the emotion of a difficult divorce.
 
She was speaking truth to her own son, urging him to get help for behavior and impulses that are injurious to women, and his own mother recognized that. I think that's what we're hearing today, her protests about writing it in haste notwithstanding.
 
BOLDUAN: And as everyone knows, the House does not have a say in - in confirmation for these cabinet positions. But when it comes to - there's a lot going on with this today. You not only have Pete Hegseth's mother speaking out. You have Pete Hegseth on the - on - back on The Hill today to meet with some very key senators about his nomination. And there's also new reporting of names being floated as possible new candidates to be nominated, like Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, like Republican Senator Joni Ernst. And CNN has new reporting, Congressman, that Ron DeSantis and Donald
 
 Trump have spoken about this. Ron DeSantis is open to the job. What do you make of that, just knowing politics and how things work and - and when you kind of, like, see this kind of churn happening around one nomination?
 
CONNOLLY: Well, you know, there's kind of a game sometimes - sometimes people play, you know it's going to be a bad day when. You know it's going to be a bad day for you when talk of your successor is already out in the press, whether it be Ron DeSantis or Joni Ernst or somebody else. That's not a good sign coming from Mar-a-Lago if you are, in fact, the secretary of Defense designate.
 
BOLDUAN: I want to also ask you, because very soon Republicans will be in charge of - in control of the White House, the House and the Senate. And this is a moment when Democrats, we know congressional Democrats, are looking to rethink and shake up their approach to being in the minority this time. 
 <br>[08:45:05]
 
And part of that comes with committee leadership. Just yesterday you threw your hat in the ring to be considered to be the next top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, a critical committee, and one where we know some of the most contentious hearings occur, the most political investigations happen, and where we hear a lot of - we - and we get a lot of headlines out of. Why do you want to lead Democrats on this committee now?
 
CONNOLLY: I've devoted all 16 years of my time in Congress to this committee. I've made it my primary commitment. No one's been more productive on the committee than I. I've chaired the largest subcommittee by far. I - which was also the most productive subcommittee in the 117th Congress. I was vice ranking member to the great Elijah Cummings. And I know the work of the committee. I've had my fingers in every part of our legislative agenda. I was named the most effective lawmaker in the United States Congress by the Vanderbilt University and University of Virginia Center for Effective Lawmaking.
 
So, I've got a track record. I know how to get things done. I know how to work with the media. I know how to work with the Republicans and to fight with the Republicans when that's necessary. No one's been a more effective bulldog against Donald Trump and the Trump years than I was. And I am relishing the opportunity to be the loyal opposition in this next Congress.
 
BOLDUAN: We know that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said yesterday that she is also considering running for that same top spot, saying that she's interested and will be making a decision shortly. Of course you have - have respect for all of your colleagues, but why you and not her?
 
CONNOLLY: Well, I - I think it's the matter of experience and record. I mean, what have you got to show in terms of legislative accomplishment? What have you got to show in terms of, you know, going to hearings and taking the fight to the other side and defending the Democratic agenda while, as I said, taking the fight to the other side. I think - I think I have a clear record. Alex, if she wants to run, is a - a bright, wonderful voice in the Democratic Party, a rising star. And I welcome the competition if she decides to do that, will be providing a choice for rank and file caucus members in the Democratic Caucus in terms of which direction do they want to go.
 
BOLDUAN: And, Congressman, before we go, I also have - you announced in November last month - last month that you're battling esophageal cancer. How are you doing? How's your treatment going?
 
CONNOLLY: I think, as you can see, I'm doing fine. You know, it's a tough - a tough thing to - to tackle. But I have a lot of faith and confidence in my treatment and my doctors. I'm feeling good. The prognosis is good. You know, we've made huge advances in cancer so that the object here is to try to get it down to a chronic disease that we manage, rather than some other kind of sentence. 
 
So, I'm feeling good. And I know lots of people who have had this and survived many years. And so I'm looking forward to coming back to work. And I was there last night for my first votes after two weeks of treatment. And I believe I'm going to be able to approach this with a lot of energy and a lot of enthusiasm. 
 
BOLDUAN: Well, there is - there are a few certainties in life, but I am certain of one thing, that - no - no type of cancer is going to keep the bulldog out of Gerry Connolly if he - after covering you for years. 
 
So, thank you very - thank you very much for coming on. 
 
CONNOLLY: Thank you, Kate.
 
And we're - we're all happy you're feeling well. Thank you, Congressman.
 
John.
 
BERMAN: All right, this morning, new questions about head injuries in football after the latest brutal hit left Jacksonville quarterback Trevor Lawrence with a concussion. The Texans' Azeez al-Shaair has been suspended three games for this hit. 
 
Our chief medical correspondent, practicing neurosurgeon, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, is with us now.
 
DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Good morning. 
 
BERMAN: Look, any football fan, even me, you know, watching this hit could see, that was awful. It was awful to see. 
 
GUPTA: Yes.
 
BERMAN: You know, as an expert on this, what did you see when you watched it? 
 
GUPTA: Yes, I think most people thought it was awful. I think if you're a neurosurgeon, it was horrific. I mean, just take a look. We're not going to show this too many times. But just, as you look at that hit, there are several things that are going on there. And I want to just show you quickly on this brain model how I think neuroscientists, neurosurgeons sort of think about this. I mean, obviously, a very, very difficult hit. 
 
But there was three things that really went on there. First of all, there was that - that the arm to the - to the head. So the - so Trevor's accelerating and then suddenly decelerates. But then there's also a turning of his head to the right. And then there's a third sort of component to this, which is when he hits his head on the - on the field itself. 
 <br>[08:50:02]
 
So, there's three separate things that happen very, very quickly there. And that's a - that's a brain injury. You know, people call this concussion, but that is a significant brain injury. And you get real evidence of that from a neuro standpoint by what happens next. After the hit, you see what happens to his overall posture. Just take a look at this.
 
BERMAN: Oh.
 
GUPTA: Takes the hit there. And then his left arm goes up like that. That is something that's referred to as a fencing posture. But again, it's an indication of a significant brain injury. 
 
We saw the components of that brain injury. But what happens in the case of posturing is, this is the brain stem, John. So, brain up here. Brain stem sort of is what leads to the spinal cord. You get an injury or a disruption of some of those pathways in the brain stem, and that causes that fencing posture. In his case, his left arm is sort of extended like this, right arm is sort of flexed like this. 
 
It's bad, John. I mean that's a really, really significant injury. And I'll tell you quickly, you know, obviously you can see it's bad. Apparently, he was pretty awake within a short time after that, able to answer questions. But the NFL now has what are called no-go criteria. You see certain things that happen on the field, and that means that player is not returning to the field. You can see, loss of consciousness, confusion or amnesia, impact, seizure, fencing response, the thing that you just saw, and something known as ataxia as well, which is basically you don't have balance, you've lost your balance. And we saw that, as you remember, John, with Tua a couple of times. 
 
BERMAN: Yes, Tua Tagovailoa. And, of course, he went through several bad hits and several concussions, sort of lost count here. 
 
GUPTA: Right.
 
BERMAN: And what happens when you have repeat incidents of this, Sanjay?
 
GUPTA: Yes, you know - you know, it's a really interesting question that I think people are trying to answer is, are there some people who are just more likely to have concussions? That's the question. Their brains are just more easily concussed. 
 
And, you know, we don't know the answer to that, but you can take a look at what we do know from Tua specifically, at least three significant concussions. He may have had more. You know, there was one, I think, when he was a college player as well that was pretty significant. But I think what we can say is, once someone has three concussions, they are far more likely than to have a fourth. They sort of demonstrated that their brains are more concussable. 
 
You'll see in that first one, September 25, 2022, that's when he had the ataxia. You sort of saw him stumbling off the field. And it was because of that, that the NFL sort of increased the - the criteria to ataxia as a no-go criteria as well. It was because of what they saw with Tua.
 
BERMAN: Yes. And, of course, we hope Trevor Lawrence, his recovery, is quick and he takes the time that he needs. 
 
Dr. Sanjay Gupta, thank you so much for being with us. 
 
GUPTA: You got it.
 
BERMAN: So, what are all your questions about football and head injuries? Submit them using the QR code on your screen. And Dr. Gupta will be back on call tomorrow to answer them. This is a very important subject. 
 
So, happening now, search crews urgently looking for a missing grandmother. She is believed to have fallen into a sinkhole while trying to find her lost cat. 
 
And this morning, one town has voted to remove fluoride from its water. We have new reaction from residents there on this controversial move.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[08:57:44]
 
BOLDUAN: So, right now, search crews are looking for a missing Pennsylvania grandmother who, it is feared, fell into that massive sinkhole you see there while out looking for her cat. Police say 64- year-old Elizabeth Pollard was last heard from Monday. Authorities then discovered her car parked near a restaurant. Her five-year-old granddaughter still inside the car. And a deep sinkhole just steps away. 
 
CNN's Isabel Rosales has much more on this. And pulling together more of the reporting on this. 
 
What are you learning about the search now? 
 
ISABEL ROSALES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Kate, good morning. This is still a very active and large search operation in Unity
 
 Township. This is southwestern Pennsylvania. At one point, over 100 people at this site, including specialized rescue crews and engineers. They've been using water pumps and vacuums to clear debris, to widen the hole, to make way for these search efforts. 
 
But, unfortunately, these very same search efforts in their attempts to find 64-year-old Elizabeth Pollard. They may be making the situation even more dangerous. There's big concerns here about the integrity of this sinkhole, that it could be further compromised, that it could lead to other sinkholes opening up, or even for that sinkhole to collapse. 
 
So, this is 64-year-old Elizabeth Pollard. She is believed to have fallen deep into that sinkhole behind of a restaurant while out with her five-year-old granddaughter searching for her cat. That sinkhole, Kate, is about the size of a manhole and 30 feet deep. And it is on top of an old and abandoned coal mine. 
 
Now, during the search you mentioned they found a car. Inside of it, her five-year-old granddaughter, who had been there for 12 hours in below freezing temperatures. And despite that situation, she was thankfully unharmed. 
 
Now, there are good signs here that have rescuers hopeful that Elizabeth Pollard is still alive in an air pocket. The good signs are that there are - there's plenty of oxygen. There's no carbon monoxide or explosive gases. And the temperature inside of that hole is warmer than above ground. Here's Pennsylvania State Police.
