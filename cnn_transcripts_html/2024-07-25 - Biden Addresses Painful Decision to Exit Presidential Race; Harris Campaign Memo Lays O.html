JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy. That includes personal ambition. So I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. That's the best way to unite our nation. 
 
You know, there is a time and a place for long years of experience in public life. There's also a time and a place for new voices, fresh voices. Yes, younger voices. And that time and place is now. 
 
The great thing about America is here kings and dictators do not rule. The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America lies in your hands. You just have to keep faith, keep the faith.

MACFARLANE: Mr. Biden never mentioned Donald Trump by name in his address, but his predecessor was watching. 
 
He wrote on Truth Social: Crooked Joe Biden's Oval Office speech was barely understandable and sooo bad!
 
FOSTER: One White House official says many staff members watch President Biden's speech with tears in their eyes because they really love him.
 
MACFARLANE: His deputy communications director posted this photo of the president speaking in the Rose Garden with his family lined up behind him. More now on this from CNN's Karin Caifa.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BIDEN: It's not about me. It's about you, your families, your futures.
 
KARIN CAIFA, CNN REPORTER (voice-over): President Joe Biden addressing his decision to step away from the 2024 presidential race.
 
BIDEN: I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation.
 
CAIFA (voice-over): And priorities for the final months of his term.
 
BIDEN: I'll keep defending our personal freedoms and our civil rights from the right to vote to the right to choose.
 
CAIFA (voice-over): Biden's Oval Office speech time to give the president's voice an opportunity to recover from COVID-19 and deliver the address with vigor, a senior advisor said. Regarding Biden's decision to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris to take his place at the top of the ticket, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the president has no regrets.
 
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: This is, again, a decision that this president made. And I think he is proud to have made that decision. 
 
CAIFA (voice-over): Harris has had a quick start to her presidential bid. KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S. (D) AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: There is so much at stake in this moment. There's so much at stake.

In Washington, I'm Karin Caifa.

MACFARLANE: Congressional Democrats are praising President Biden's speech.
 <br>[04:05:00]
 
FOSTER: U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar, who ran against him in 2020 for the party's nomination, called his remarks really beautiful. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN): What the president did today is remind us of why America voted for him in the first place. What he talked about tonight is that we once again are now passing the torch to Kamala Harris. Yes, but also to the American people, because he quoted Benjamin Franklin and said it's a republic if you can keep it.
 
And I thought it was actually a beautiful speech because he did some on his accomplishments, of which there are many. But he also really focused on one thing, and that was our democracy and the risk to our democracy. I didn't find it one bit divisive.
 
I thought that was funny to hear. That's what the Republicans were attacking him on. It wasn't divisive.
 
It was a man saying, this is what I've done, but now it's on you and I'm passing on that torch. I thought it was really beautiful.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
FOSTER: Meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris is going full steam ahead with her presidential campaign. The campaign's already vetting potential running mates and making the case in a memo that the shift in the 2024 race has created an expanded universe of swing voters. MACFARLANE: A new CNN poll shows Harris has the support of 46 percent of registered voters in a hypothetical match-up lower than Donald Trump's 49 percent. But it's within the poll's margin of error, and Harris is looking to close that gap.
 
FOSTER: Yes, CNN's Kristen Holmes has more on Trump's attacks on Harris. But first, let's go to Eva McKend for details on Harris's pitch to voters.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
EVA MCKEND, CNN U.S. NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Kamala Harris pressing forward, now that she's the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.
 
KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: When I am president of the United States.
 
MCKEND (voice-over): Addressing the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta in Indianapolis, focusing on winning over women of color.
 
HARRIS: With your support, I am fighting for our nation's future.
 
MCKEND (voice-over): And praising her former running mate, President Joe Biden.
 
HARRIS: He cares about the future. He thinks about the future.
 
MCKEND (voice-over): Attendees here in Indianapolis say Harris is the right choice.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She's been tried and tested. She's served as vice president. She's had a political career. She was a senator. She was an attorney general in California.
 
MCKEND (voice-over): The vice president's outreach today follows a speech to her own Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority convention two weeks ago. More than 1,500 or her sisters are now sending support to the Harris campaign in the amount of $19.08, in honor of the founding year of their sorority.
 
HARRIS: These extremists want to take us back, but we are not going back.
 
MCKEND (voice-over): The Harris campaign also outlining their strategy in a memo today, sharing what they see as their electoral path to victory over Donald Trump.
 
HARRIS: The path to the White House goes through Wisconsin.
 
MCKEND (voice-over): Saying they will, quote, "play offense" in the Blue Wall states of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania that Biden was able to flip in 2020, and the Sun Belt states of North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada. 
 
Where the campaign argues: The vice president's advantages with young voters, Black voters, and Latino voters offer multiple pathways to 270 electoral votes.
 
HARRIS: We have an election to win!
 
MCKEND (voice-over): A new CNN survey of previous poll respondents shows Harris improving on Biden's performance among crucial voting blocs, seen as trouble spots for the president, including women, younger voters, Black voters, and Hispanic voters.
 
Those groups, critical to Biden's victory in 2020, and now Harris's chances in November.
 
MCKEND: And the vice president not only running a race defined by opposition to Trump, she's also touting the administration's record. Capping the cost of insulin at $35, passing the child tax credit, addressing student loans, among other policy issues.
 
Eva McKend, CNN, Indianapolis.

KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Former President Donald Trump wasting no time going after Kamala Harris at that North Carolina rally, at one point calling her Lying Kamala Harris, tearing into her record on immigration and really working to paint her as a radical liberal and sometimes as the mastermind behind some of Biden's policy.
 
Take a listen to just some of what he said.
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I was supposed to be nice. They say something happened to me when I got shot, I became nice.
 
They're very dangerous people. When you're dealing with them, you can't be too nice. You really can't be. So, if you don't mind, I'm not going to be nice. Is that OK?
 
This November, the American people are going to tell her, No thanks, Kamala. You've done a terrible job. You've been terrible at everything you've done. You're ultra-liberal, and we don't want you here. We don't want you anywhere. Kamala, you're fired. Get out of here.
 <br>[04:10:00]
 
HOLMES: At one point, Trump mocked Harris's attempted to define this race as that between a former prosecutor and a convicted felon, saying he doesn't think that people buy that.
 
Kristen Holmes, CNN, Charlotte, North Carolina. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
FOSTER: Communications director of Donald Trump's 2016 campaign joins us now. He's also a partner at Mercury Public Affairs. Thank you so much for coming in and joining us. I know you're touring Europe at the moment. 
 
I'm just wondering, as you look at the team now advising Trump, you had a very clear message and attack line with Hillary Clinton, didn't you, during your campaign? Do you think they're struggling to find one with Kamala?
 
BRYAN LANZA, FORMER DEPUTY COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, TRUMP 2016 CAMPAIGN: No. Listen, I think it's fresh. They made their pivot, the Democratic Party.
 
The donors have sort of said, Biden, you have to go, and they've moved to Kamala. And I think you're going to see us define who Kamala Harris is. I mean, she's a liberal politician from California, San Francisco, literally the most liberal city in the country, which is very much outside the mainstream.
 
I don't think it's going to be hard to define her. I actually think we're going to have a buffet of issues. I mean, first of all, she has to defend, you know, her record under Joe Biden.
 
You know, the voters have already passed judgment on the economy. The voters already passed judgment on inflation. The voters already passed judgment on the foreign affairs, three wars, or two wars.
 
And now she has to defend her record, which has been proven to be the most liberal record we've seen in Congress in probably a century. And she's now the most liberal candidate who's ever run -- who's run for president in probably the last hundred years. And she has to defend, you know, what most people would say were socialist positions in San Francisco, because that's very much what San Francisco is.
 
That is very much outside the mainstream of America.
 
MACFARLANE: But it does seem that that's already an attack line that Donald Trump is perhaps toying with. We heard him yesterday saying, you know, up there on the stand saying lying, Kamala, radical left, lunatic. But what we can't get away from is that this has really been a head spinning few days for the Republicans.
 
I mean, if you just look --
 
LANZA: It's been a head spinning two weeks.
 
MACFARLANE: It has. But in terms of, you know, the opposition, we've seen Kamala Harris raise a historic amount of money in just 24 hours. She's had thousands of volunteers sign up.
 
I mean, how are the party, as you see it, adapting to that challenge right now because it's a steep one?
 
LANZA: You know, it's not a steep one because remember at the end of the day, you know what you see in your poll that you guys just put out. Forty nine or forty six, a three point gap. That's the highest Kamala Harris will have.
 
That is when the media that is when the left, they sort of organize and prop her up and say, listen, she's the second coming. She's earning the people's vote. She's not earning anybody's vote. She's making phone calls from her house. There's nobody voted for her yet. Nobody's voted for her. They voted for Joe Biden. Fourteen million people voted for Joe Biden. They didn't vote for Kamala Harris.
 
And so, you know, she's -- she has an uphill battle. We're ready to attack her record because her record is very much -- I hate using the word the words of war -- a target rich environment.
 
And from our standpoint, you know, we're sort of looking forward to the next phase of this. And that's completely defining her. You've seen that on TV.
 
We've been on TV defining her record for the last week or four days. You know, Democrats have not put any money forward. We've made the reservations of TV.
 
Advertising is going to play a big part. We're going to be fully funded campaign. She's going to be fully funded campaign.
 
The energy is going to be there. But the record for them is hard to defend.
 
MACFARLANE: You say people didn't vote for Kamala Harris. She was on the Biden Harris ticket. Right.
 
LANZA: Sure.
 
MACFARLANE: But just I want to pick up on one thing here, because we have seen Republicans and Trump allies in recent days, not unlike in 2016 when you're working on the campaign, going after Hillary's gender and potentially her race as well. We had the DEI comment coming out in the last days. Also, J.D. Vance, the cat woman comment, which hasn't exactly done them any favors. How careful do the Republican Party have to be here to cross certain lines when approaching this campaign?
 
LANZA: Listen, I think we have to be very careful. And I think the best way to do is use Joe Biden's word. Joe Biden described Kamala Harris as a DEI person. You know, earlier in May of this year, he had he had an event in Philadelphia where he himself said that his values were diversity, inclusiveness and equity. That's DEI.
 
FOSTER: Because he sees it as a positive. 
 
LANZA: Sure. But that's what he sees. But the country doesn't see it that way. The country, you know, California, which is --
 
FOSTER: But the whole country's diverse and --
 
LANZA: Sure, but they don't believe in -- they don't believe in set asides. The country doesn't believe in set asides. Even the most liberal state in the union, which is California, does not believe in affirmative action.
 
The voters have passed overwhelmingly that affirmative action is not something that should be considered in a hire. Now, Joe Biden decided to bring race into the issue and he said, I'm going to before he looked at any candidate for VP, he said, I'm only going to nominate a female, a female Black woman. 
 
You know, as a Latino, I find that offensive. I just do. It's like I should not be judged on the color of my skin. I should be judged on the character of my work and the character of who I am.
 
So he injected race into this. So I tell my Republican candidates, just go back to Joe Biden's words. That's how he described her.
 
Every time you say she's a DEI, which I wish they wouldn't say, he used to say, I'm using Joe Biden's words and point to the specific place where he said it. May 23rd, 2024, just a couple of months ago, he referred to her as a DEI hire. He referred to other people as a DEI hire his administration. I would say use those words rather than be dubbed as making it your words, because the country is clear. 
 <br>[04:15:00]
 
We don't like affirmative action. You know most liberal states we've passed laws to ban affirmative action for playing a role in hiring and going to colleges and all these things.
 
So it is, it is a different time. But I would always use Joe Biden's words.
 
FOSTER: You're very connected with the Trump team. You're in Europe. You're meeting presumably members of, you know, what Europeans would describe as the far right. I'm sure you would argue against that. How organized is that grouping? Trump's team, Le Pen's team, the teams in Italy, Austria, here in the U.K. with reform. Is there a coordinated effort there?
 
LANZA: Yes, listen, I think each political party in each country is a little bit different. But there is there is a broader agenda. You know, there is immigration or at least illegal immigration, refugee stuff.
 
That's where, you know, the parties throughout the world sort of align and work on their talking points and sort of work on their messaging, because that impact has sort of led to the rise of the far right, has led to the rise of sort of Republicans coming back. Was this unrestricted, you know, illegal immigration or refugee status coming in. 
 
And so are they organized? Do they all work together closely? They -- I would say they more sort of compare notes rather than offer strategy points in each specific states because the issues are still the same. This is a world -- this is a gust that's hitting the whole world with respect to inflation, which we still have here. We still have in other countries. And it's in the wars affect everybody in the world.
 
And also illegal immigration is causing huge, huge repercussions in some of these states. Look at Germany. 
 
So I wouldn't say that, you know, we had weekly conference calls with center right parties throughout the world. But I would say from time to time we sort of compare notes and say, hey, this is what's happening here in the United States. This is how we're addressing these concerns. You know, what are you guys feeling there?
 
Because at the end of the day, the issues are still interconnected.
 
FOSTER: Just briefly, is Bannon being caught up with his cases? Is that a disruption to that effort?
 
LANZA: I don't think Bannon played that big of a role. Listen, Steve Bannon is a friend of mine. I've known him for a very long time. I knew him before he got involved in the presidential campaign in 2016. You know, Bannon's personality is he doesn't play well with others. Right.
 
So, you know, having worked, having met and worked relationships with some of the center right people, I can see why, you know, like look at Le Pen. She didn't want anything to do with Steve Bannon. His personality isn't fit for everybody. It just happened to fit very well for Trump. 
 
FOSTER: Thank you so much for joining us and coming in. 
 
LANZA: My pleasure. Thanks for having me.
 
MACFARLANE: Busy few months coming up.
 
LANZA: It is.
 
FOSTER: Typhoon Gaemi expected to make landfall in mainland China in the coming hours after leaving a path of destruction in the South China Sea. The storm sat off the coast of Taiwan for hours before finally moving ashore, pummeling the island with heavy rain, strong winds and damaging storm surge.
 
MACFARLANE: At least two people were killed there and hundreds injured. The storm was also blamed for at least 13 deaths in the Philippines. Authorities there say almost a million people have been impacted by Gaemi.
 
Well CNN's Marc Stewart is joining us now live from Beijing. Marc, tell us that -- what's the latest on the veracity of this storm?
 
MARC STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, the storm is approaching China and there is concern because we have seen such extreme flooding here all summer long. And there is concern that any more rain will make a very bad situation even worse. 
 
But right away, I want to show you some of the pictures that we have seen coming in to our hub in Hong Kong. And we've been watching here in Beijing, in particular, the Philippines. Manila hit very hard, intense flooding in the streets. We have seen rescue boats.
 
We have seen families being rescued. We've seen children being rescued. We even saw a pet with some children being wrapped up in towels to stay safe. The water levels are so high it is up to people's chests. We are seeing nearly everything in the path submerged. We saw a bus that was pretty close to being underwater. Another bus was stuck in the waterway in the city. 
 
So this is becoming a very big problem in the Philippines. One city to the north of the Philippines saw about 55,000 people evacuated, according to the government, according to a posting they put on X. As many as 16,000 of those people are families. So this is impacting all facets of life. Businesses are closed. School is not in session. And flights have been canceled. 
 
And then there is Taiwan, which is an area of the world very used to seeing typhoons. What's interesting here is that the mountains actually served as a buffer, almost preventing the storm from moving forward. But it caused heavy storm surge once again, rains, you know, as well as very intense wind. 
 
And here is something else that's interesting. If we look at the Philippines, the typhoon didn't even hit. The damage we saw there was just from the bands of the storm. So that's an indication as to just how intense of a weather system this is.
 <br>[04:20:00]
 
Back here in Beijing, you can see that the weather behind me is not so good. We've had intense downpours all day. That is from a separate system. Max and Christina, it is not from the typhoon, but concerning nonetheless.
 
MACFARLANE: Marc, those pictures are just extraordinary, aren't they? We will watch and see in the coming hours how this plays out. Thanks so much for now, Marc Stewart there live for us in Beijing.
 
Now flights are beginning to resume from the airport in Frankfurt, Germany, after demonstrations disrupted operations earlier today.
 
FOSTER: A climate activist group said six people glued themselves to the taxiway -- as you can see. In a post on social media, Frankfurt airport officials asked passengers to check the status of their flight before going to the airport and allow extra time for travel. Yesterday, climate activists caused flight disruptions for several hours at Germany's Cologne Bonn Airport too.
 
Still ahead, Israel's Prime Minister delivers a competitive and divisive speech to the U.S. Congress. Details on what Benjamin Netanyahu said and what he didn't say in a live report later this hour.
 
MACFARLANE: And we're one day away from the start of the Olympic Games in Paris, and already there's controversy. The latest from Paris coming up.
 
FOSTER: Plus, fans of Taylor Swift's folklore era, or really any of her eras, can see some of her personal items right here in London. All those details coming up.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The French team they're going to be a tough team tonight. We're going to have to play hard and come together. But hopefully we can beat them. We can do it.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No. We're going to win. Yes, USA's going to win.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MACFARLANE: Nope. Too bad, guys. Their wishes did not come true. The U.S. Olympic men's soccer team fell to host nation France 3-0. No great surprises there.
 
FOSTER: The Olympic soccer tournament kicked off two days ahead of tomorrow's opening ceremony in Paris. I always find that quite odd.
 
MACFARLANE: I mean, you've got to get all the sports in while you can.
 
FOSTER: Yes.
 
MACFARLANE: There's a lot -- we've got a lot to fit in. Hundreds of thousands are expected to crowd the River Seine in Friday's opening ceremony. And we're still waiting to hear which artists will be performing along with who will be lighting the Olympic cauldron.
 
And for more on all of this, let's go out to CNN's Melissa Bell, who's joining us live from Paris. Melissa, it's been so great to see the sport finally get underway, you know, after so much anticipation. But day one, it seems, came with quite a bit of controversy.
 
We're hearing news of a pitch invasion of the first football match of the Olympic Games.
 
MELISSA BELL, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: And a very unhappy Argentinian side, Christina, that lost out after that very controversial and chaotic game. You say a pitch invasion, a goal that they scored cancelled, Morocco in the end the winners. But a messy start to the football.
 
Also, we saw the Israeli team being booed as it took on Mali at the Parc des Princes here in Paris. And there are other controversies already. Just one day in, a COVID, a small cluster within the women's Australian water polo team.
 
But also allegations of spying that are dogging now the Canadian women's team. That is the allegations that down further down in France, near Saint-Etienne, where Canada's football team is preparing to take on New Zealand. Allegations of spying using a drone. So already some controversy, even though, as you say, that big opening ceremony yet to get underway, Christina and Max.
 
Some of those controversies hope the organizers will be overshadowed. What they expect will be a fairly spectacular ceremony. 320,000 people who are expected to line the banks of the River Seine along six kilometers, with organizers hoping that the weather holds up and there won't be any issues to do with rain.
 
MACFARLANE: And Melissa, to do with that opening ceremony, we were hearing rumors of who might be in the offing. Celine Dion was mentioned, I believe, yesterday as a possible opening act. Any more information you're hearing on the ground there?
 
BELL: This is just speculation for the time being. Parisian authorities remaining very tight-lipped, Christina, about who's going to be in that line-up. There are rumors of Lady Gaga being in town, Celine Dion, and that has fueled speculation. But for now, they're really not saying very much about it, not confirming either way. 
 
I'd just like to show you, Christina, this is Paris's Town Hall, all decked out for the event. One of 26 fan zones that Parisian authorities have organized for ordinary people to be able to come and watch these games.
 
You can see their deck chairs put out, giant screens in these fan zones, and it's expected that many Parisians, those who haven't, for instance, been able to get tickets to some of the events, will be able to come and enjoy them nonetheless. 
 
At the heart of these games, from the very beginning, was the idea of inclusivity, that they would be open to as many people as possible. Controversy has also followed about the cost of the tickets, the rising cost of metro tickets. These fan zones are the answer from Parisian authorities, 26 of them around the city, that they hope will widen the access to the event. 
 
When it comes to the opening ceremony, that has been very carefully controlled. Along that 6 kilometer stretch of the River Seine, it isn't just that they've kept a very tight lid on the 320,000 people who will be able to come, checking their identities, giving them QR codes. Many of them refused. They've also had to control the identity of 20,000 Parisians that live along the River Seine. Essentially, any windows that give onto the river itself.
 
So it's a huge operation that's taken place over the last few weeks and months to prepare Paris for what should be, say Parisian authorities, hope Parisian authorities, some of the most spectacular games ever held. Not just the opening ceremony held for the first time outside a stadium and inside the city center along the river, but also, of course, those swimming events that they hope, with the weather, if it stays as it is, that they hope will be able to take place in the river itself. 
 
So huge ambition on the part of the organizers, and at this point, great hopes that everything will go smoothly -- Christina and Max.
 
MACFARLANE: Yes, I cannot wait to see those swimming events in the Seine.
 
FOSTER: We can swim in the rain, can't we? That's the one event that can carry on.
 
MACFARLANE: Rain and the wind. Just like Melissa did, actually. She was in the Seine last week.
 <br>[04:30:00]
 
FOSTER: She was there. She was ahead of all of them. And she's still standing, so it's safe.
 
MACFARLANE: I know. She's Wonder Woman, isn't she? Melissa, thank you so much.
 
BELL: I'm not hospitalized yet, you guys.
 
MACFARLANE: Looking forward to it. And of course, be sure to watch our special one-hour program, "AIMING FOR GOLD," this Friday at 7 p.m. Paris time. That's 1 p.m. Eastern time in the U.S. We'll be bringing you the sights and sounds from the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in Paris.</pre>
