THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.

KIMBERLY CHEATLE, DIRECTOR, U.S. SECRET SERVICE: As I've stated, ma'am, this was clearly a failure. I would grade the agents and officers who selflessly threw themselves in front of the President and neutralize the threat. And a -- I think that we need to examine the events that led up to and prior to that day.
 
REP. VIRGINIA FOXX (R-NC): You stated in 2021, that the Secret Service has a zero fail mission. It's clear that the events of July 13th show a cascade of failures that caused Corey Comperatore his life nearly caused former president his life and injured David Dutch and James Copenhaver. When an agency fails spectacularly, its mission, those responsible must be held accountable, and the problems must be fixed, so they cannot happen again. Why should the American people or the officials you're responsible for protecting have confidence in your ability to lead the Secret Service after such a spectacular failure?
 
CHEATLE: I appreciate the question. And I am committed to finding answers so that we can make the agency stronger after this.
 
FOXX: You said on July 15th, at the buck stops with me. How were you taking accountability for the Secret Service's failures during the July 13th assassination attempt on President Trump?
 
CHEATLE: I have taken accountability and I will continue to take accountability. I am responsible for leading the agency. And I am responsible for finding the answers to how this event occurred, and making sure that it doesn't happen again.
 
FOXX: So I would like to explore how you got the job as director of the United States Secret Service. Is it typical for the director of the Secret Service to be recommended for the role at the behest of a president's family and senior staff, perhaps at the request of Joe Biden or Anthony Bernal.
 
CHEATLE: I got the job as a director of the Secret Service because I spent 27 years in an agency with a mission that I absolutely love. I started my career in Detroit. I worked my way up through investigations and protection.
 
FOXX: Where you -- was there competition for the position?
 
CHEATLE: You would have to ask those who were involved in the interview process.
 
FOXX: But you think you are the best person in the country to head the Secret Service?
 
CHEATLE: I think that I am the best person to lead the Secret Service at this time.
 
FOXX: The Secret Service receives billions in funding each year as has been explained by my colleagues here. In fact, the increase -- you've had an increase in real terms of 55 percent. As you're no doubt, aware staffing levels for those assigned to protect the president, former presidents and other senior officials, has decreased by about 350 between 2014 and today, clearly a lack of financial resources not to blame for the staffing shortage.
 
In 2022, the Secret Service saw nearly half its workforce leave in one year. And during the same year, it was ranked dead last among law enforcement agencies in the best places to work in the federal government. Can you explain why your agency was so poorly rated, and why so many staff left in just one year?
 
CHEATLE: So with all due respect, I dispute the statistics of half of the employees leaving in 2022. I think that that has been inaccurate data that's been reported out there. But what I can tell you is, as I have returned, as the director of the agency, we have had an increase in hiring and staffing and an increase in resources. And we are committed to continue to hire so that we can be staffed appropriately to meet the dynamic mission that we have.
 
FOXX: Well, you may want to dispute it, but it's out there. My understanding -- given the high profile -- high profile failures and rotten culture at the Secret Service during your nearly two year term -- tenure, why should the American people have any confidence in your ability to lead the Secret Service to perform its zero fail mission to protect our senior leaders?
 
CHEATLE: The Secret Service has an incredible culture. Our men and women play service over self. They come in every day, willing to risk their lives for our protective mission. And they work investigations that thwart people who would do harm to children, child exploiters. We have an incredible mission and our culture is, we will get the job done no matter what.
 
FOXX: Well, those on the frontline certainly have a great culture and they were willing to risk their lives for President Trump, but I'm not sure the leadership at the agency has the right kind of culture. I yield back Mr. Chairman.

REP. JAMES COMER (R-KY), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE: Chair now recognizes Mr. Connolly from Virginia.
 
REP. GERRY CONNOLLY (D-VA): Thank you Mr. Chairman. Well, I hope the American people do appreciate the incredible daily risks Secret Service agents take on our behalf. You mentioned there are 36 regular clients you've got that you protect constantly. But I was participating in the NATO Summit just two weeks ago, we had 32 heads of government and heads of state plus visiting heads of state and heads of government, presumably, you provided protection for all them?
 
CHEATLE: That is correct.
 
CONNOLLY: Just -- just saying. Help us understand, however, I -- I will stipulate that there's an ongoing investigation, you don't want to go into too much detail on that, until you have been able to ascertain all the facts and analyze what they mean. You can understand however, the anxiety, we, and the American public have about how could this happen? And how can we ensure it can't recur?
 
Now, there are some things my friends on one particular side of the aisle don't really want to talk about, like AR-15s, and access to them by a 20-year-old, or anybody for that matter. Presumably, Director Cheatle, the ubiquity of weapons, guns in America, especially assault weapons or semi-automatic weapons, that's helped your job and the mission of your agencies, right? It's -- it's made it less complicated, isn't that true?
 
CHEATLE: I'm sorry. I'm not understanding your question.
 
CONNOLLY: Real simple. More guns, especially dangerous ones have made your job protecting people easier, is that not right?
 
CHEATLE: I think at from every --
 
CONNOLLY: Director Cheatle, this is simple English. More guns are -- do they make your job more complicated or less complicated in protecting these 36 clients and visiting heads of state and heads of government that come to Washington?
 
CHEATLE: I think the Secret Service needs to take into account --
 
CONNOLLY: I didn't ask that. I'm -- I'm sorry. I asked a simple question which deserves a simple answer. The ubiquity of guns, dangerous weapons in America like AR-15s, has that made your job that is to say the mission of the Secret Service easier or more difficult?
 
CHEATLE: I think the threat environment for protecting our Secret Service protectees is always difficult. And that's dynamic. And it's always evolving.
 
CONNOLLY: We stipulate it's always difficult. I, again, this is a simple one. Does ubiquity of guns make your job easier or more difficult today?
 
CHEATLE: I understand the Second Amendment rights of individual --
 
CONNOLLY: I didn't ask that question. I'm not questioning the Second Amendment. I'm asking a simple analysis, Director Cheatle. And I can tell you, you're not making my job easier in terms of assessing your qualification for continuing on as director. Please answer the question, you're the head of the Secret Service, you're speaking on behalf of 8,000 members have put their lives on the line, we just had a failure by your own admission. Do guns make your job easier or harder?
 
CHEATLE: I think the job of the Secret Service is difficult on every day. And we need to make sure that we are mitigating all threats. Whether that be that be --
 
CONNOLLY: That isn't my question. That is not my question. And now I think you're evading the answer, which is not a hard one.
 
CHEATLE: I am sorry that you feel that way, sir.
 
CONNOLLY: How else could I feel Director Cheatle, when you're clearly avoiding a direct answer to a very simple declarative question? We almost lost a presidential candidate the other day, a 20-year-old had access to his father's AR-15 and got on top of a roof within 500 yards or feet of the podium. And I'm asking you that the availability of that AR-15, which is replicated all across America make your job harder or easier and you're not willing to answer that question. And you think and -- and you wonder why we might have a lack of confidence in your continued ability to direct this agency.
 
CHEATLE: I understand your question, and that's the environment.
 
CONNOLLY: Well, if understand my question, why not answer it?
 
CHEATLE: Because it's the environment that the Secret Service works in every day.
 
CONNOLLY: That doesn't tell me anything. That's the -- that's the environment we work in. Had an -- I had an attack on my office a year ago. I know a little bit about violence, too. He came to kill me. When he couldn't, he beat one of my staffers eight times with a baseball bat on the head. We live with the threat of violence. But a simple answer from the director that Secret Service would be helpful. And I'm sorry, you've chosen to evade it. I yield back.
 <br>[11:10:19]
 
COMER: The Chair now recognizes Mr. Grothman from Wisconsin.
 
REP. GLENN GROTHMAN (R-WI): Thank you. When this guy took the shots, he climbed a ladder to get on the roof. Correct?
 
CHEATLE: I'm unable to answer details of exactly how the individual access the roof at this time.
 
GROTHMAN: Do you know when the -- if -- if he did use the ladder, do you know when the ladder was placed there? Was the ladder there two days before, just the night before? Do you have any information as to when the ladder got there?
 
CHEATLE: I would like to be able to answer those questions. The FBI is still conducting an investigation.
 
GROTHMAN: How did the rifle get to the -- to the roof?
 
CHEATLE: Again, sir, at this time on unable to answer questions to provide --
 
GROTHMAN: Had they the clean the roof since the -- since the assassination attempt?
 
CHEATLE: Have they cleaned the roof?
 
GROTHMAN: Right. Is there anything done to the roof? Is it just like it was, you know, whatever, 10 days ago or -- or not? Is there anything been done to the roof?
 
CHEATLE: I -- I don't have an answer for that.
 
GROTHMAN: OK. Were President Trump's normal agents normally assigned to him there that day?
 
CHEATLE: Yes.
 
GROTHMAN: There was no -- these were the same agents that were always there?
 
CHEATLE: Yes, sir. The -- the people that are assigned to his detail were working on that day.
 
GROTHMAN: OK. There -- there's stuff on the internet that says they were not there that day. But these are the same agents who are routinely there.
 
CHEATLE: Yes, sir.
 
GROTHMAN: OK. Do we know which agents fired the shots that finally took down the potential assassin?
 
CHEATLE: Yes, sir. I do.
 
GROTHMAN: Can you give us those names or background of those agents?
 
CHEATLE: I would not offer their name up in this setting, but it was one of our technical officers, our counter snipers.
 
GROTHMAN: OK. So can we privately get those names in the Committee?
 
CHEATLE: I -- I am certain that we can make names available privately.
 
GROTHMAN: OK. Do we know where all the shots landed? How -- first of all, how many shots did -- did the potential assassin, how many shots came out of the rifle?
 
CHEATLE: So again, I would hesitate to offer that information as the FBI is conducting an investigation.
 
GROTHMAN: Have we got the bullets from all the shots?
 
CHEATLE: Again, that would be the responsibility of the FBI to collect that evidence.
 
GROTHMAN: OK. Do we have any -- do we have the correspondence from the shooter? Has that been recovered from his phone, whatever?
 
CHEATLE: Again, I would have to defer you to the FBI for details on that investigation.
 
GROTHMAN: OK. You spent some time trying to change the makeup of the Secret Service. OK. You feel there, whatever, too high a percentage are men. Does this affect at all who you are hiring for the Secret Service?
 
CHEATLE: I've spent my time as the director, trying to increase the number of people that we hire in the Secret Service so that we have the best and the brightest. And that's been my concentration as the director.
 
GROTHMAN: OK. Yes, you're hiring -- hiring -- not hiring then because of your desire to hit certain targets?
 
CHEATLE: I am hiring the best qualified candidates to put in an application that want to work for our great organization.
 
GROTHMAN: OK. Next question -- next question. The shooter obtained a direct sight of -- of President Trump from -- from the position on the rooftop. I assume that is not something that should ever happen. It should never happen. Do you want to elaborate a little on how that happened? Or what you wish you had done differently or would do differently next time there's a Trump rally?
 
CHEATLE: Again, sir, the facts of this particular event are still unfolding. Nine days, there have been a number of reports that have been out there. So I do not want to provide an -- an information that perhaps would contradict something that has been erroneously reported or is not factual. But there clearly was a mistake. And we will take every effort to make sure that this never happens again.
 
GROTHMAN: Could you elaborate why you want one-third of the Secret Service to be women?
 <br>[11:15:06]
 
CHEATLE: I've never stated that I want one-third of the Secret Service to be women.
 
GROTHMAN: Thirty 30 percent are some good, some target, no? OK.
 
REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): The gentleman, yield?
 
GROTHMAN: Sure. I yield.
 
JORDAN: What was the director -- what was erroneously reported you said to Mr. Grothman's question, said something was erroneously reported. What are you referring to?
 
CHEATLE: I'm referring to --
 
JORDAN: And the question was in the context of the shooter using a ladder to get on the building, what was erroneously reported? Because you won't tell us anything, but you'll tell us something that wasn't reported accurately?
 
CHEATLE: I'm saying, sir, that there have been a number of reports that are out there that have been speculation, and until we have the actual facts, I don't want to report anything that would contradict speculation that has been out there.
 
JORDAN: I yield. I thank the gentleman for yielding.
 
COMER: The chair recognizes Mr. Krishnamoorthi from Illinois.
 
REP. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI (D-IL): Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you --
 
WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: All right. We're going to continue to monitor this very important congressional hearing with the Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle answering questions from the lawmakers. We're going to take a quick break. We're going to resume our special coverage right after this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:20:50]
 
BLITZER: I'm Wolf Blitzer in Washington. You're watching CNN special coverage of the Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle's testimony answering questions from lawmakers up on Capitol Hill on what she calls the biggest failure in decades for the U.S. Secret Service on the assassination attempts against former President Trump. Let's listen in, more questions are coming forward.
 
KRISHNAMOORTHI: And you have not found evidence that this incident was in fact directed or perpetrated by a foreign state or entity, right?
 
COMER: And that's the last question but I'll let the director answer that.
 
CHEATLE: Not at this time.
 
KRISHNAMOORTHI: Thank you. I yield back.
 
COMER: Gentleman's time has expired. Chair now recognizes Mr. Cloud from Texas.
 
REP. MICHAEL CLOUD (R-TX): Thank you. I just wanted to confirm there was only one counter sniper who took one shot is that --
 
CHEATLE: We had multiple counter sniper teams of that -- that day.
 
CLOUD: Yes, on the premises but is only one took one shot, is that correct or only one?
 
CHEATLE: Correct.
 
CLOUD: OK. How many spent shell casings were found on the roof?
 
CHEATLE: Again, I would have to defer you to the FBI's criminal investigation. CLOUD: OK. Word is, is that the car was loaded with explosives?
 
CHEATLE: Again, sir, I'd have to defer you to the FBI's investigation.
 
CLOUD: OK, you're -- you're not curious about -- you don't communicate with them? No? OK. CNN reported that the Secret Service did not sweep the building, the shooter was used to shoot President Trump and other attendees, is that true or false?
 
CHEATLE: So we are conducting a mission insurance investigation and will depend on the information that we obtained from our investigations.
 
CLOUD: OK. The Secret Service knew there was a suspicious person anywhere from eight minutes before president walked on stage to 30 to 60 minutes, different reports was President Trump or his team notified of the threat?
 
CHEATLE: I think there's a difference in a distinction between suspicious --
 
CLOUD: Suspicious person.
 
CHEATLE: -- and threat.
 
CLOUD: Yes.
 
CHEATLE: So we are going back and looking at communications to know when the information about a suspicious person was passed to Secret Service personnel.
 
CLOUD: OK. Was President Trump or his team notified?
 
CHEATLE: Again, we are going back and looking to make sure that we have the exact information of when those notifications were made, and who those notifications were made to.
 
CLOUD: OK. It -- I think it's troubling for a lot of us that the number one question everyone in America is wondering is why was the roof left open? And after nine days, we should at least maybe have a little bit of that information? And when you come to this committee hearing, and you don't have anything to say about that, it's -- it's very, very troubling. Did you review the security plan for this event?
 
CHEATLE: I personally do not review security plans for events that take place across the country.
 
CLOUD: Any of them?
 
CHEATLE: We have a number of events that take place --
 
CLOUD: Who's the top level official who reviews the security plans?
 
CHEATLE: There -- there's a number of people that review security plans --
 
CLOUD: And who's ultimately responsible for signing off on a security plan?
 
CHEATLE: It -- it's a conjunction of personnel. There are people on the ground. There are supervisors on the detail. There are people at headquarters.
 
CLOUD: So there's not one person who says OK, this is good work -- it's copacetic, we're going for it?
 
CHEATLE: I think much in the way that we build our security plans where there are multiple layered.
 
CLOUD: No doubt there's teams working different aspects of it, but ultimately, isn't there an individual who signs off on the plan?
 
CHEATLE: Much like how we design our security plans, they're multi layered, there are multiple layers --
 
CLOUD: There's no accountability?
 
CHEATLE: There is accountability, sir.
 
CLOUD: There's -- this is -- this is what -- whether it's the FBI or Fauci or any -- it's time after time after time, these multiple layers of accountability turned into layers of plausible deniability in agency after agency after agency that's got to be fixed because you keep coming here and expecting. Yes, you're saying I'm responsible, but -- and you're accountable for it, but then there's no -- there's nothing. What do you mean by that? I mean, you're -- you're saying you're going to keep your job, right?
 
CHEATLE: I assure you, sir, that if we determined through the course of our investigation, that someone or people need to be held accountable, we will do so.
 <br>[11:25:02]
 
CLOUD: What level of -- if President Biden, God forbid, had been shot and killed would you think that was worthy of resignation?
 
CHEATLE: I would do the same thing that I'm doing here where I would want to make sure that we are conducting an investigation, that there is continuity in that investigation, and that we could find the answers to what happened.
 
CLOUD: You do not think the assassination of somebody under your det -- under your details worthy of resignation?
 
CHEATLE: I think that this event was tragic and deserves answers.
 
CLOUD: The -- the thing that you've said so far is that you want to make sure that this never happens again. The thing is, everyone in America knows that's not the job description that you're tasked with. The job description your task was to make sure it never happens, period.
 
One of your goals, and the strategic plan is to champion diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility, you've accomplished the accessibility part. What standards, do you keep the same standards for all applicants at all or does every Secret Service agent meet the same qualifications? Or do you have different standards for different people?
 
CHEATLE: Yes, sir. Everyone who moves through the application process has to meet the same standards to become a special agent.
 
CLOUD: OK. The -- the trouble I think we're having with right now, so far, you gave a lame excuse for sloped roof. You said that local law enforcement its job was to cover up the building before backtracking on that. We were told that President Trump's team did not ask for security before you backtracked on that. You haven't provided the audio recording that this Committee, the Chairman said requested, that was due Thursday. You didn't give us an advanced copy of your opening statement.
 
But yet, there was reporting on it somewhere else. There seems to be more information from YouTube videos and you're able to provide for us and it -- it begs the question to anyone, you're in charge of the investigation of your own failure. So how is anybody in America supposed to be able to trust the results of that investigation as being anything transparent and genuine?
 
COMER: That's the last question. But please feel free to answer that question, director.
 
CHEATLE: Sir, I've been a Secret Service agent for nearly 30 years. I have lead with integrity. And I follow our core values of duty, justice, honor, loyalty, and courage. And I am doing that in this case. And I assure this Committee that I will provide answers when we have a full and complete report in addition to cooperating with all of the other investigations that are ongoing.
 
COMER: Chair now recognizes Mr. Khanna from California.
 
REP. RO KHANNA (D-CA): Thank you, Mr. Chair. I want to thank the Chair and the Ranking Member for convening this hearing on a bipartisan basis. I joined them in condemning the horrific assassination attempt on the former president. I am relieved for the sake of the country, that he wasn't seriously hurt and that he survived. And my thoughts with him and his family during such a traumatic event.
 
I also want to express condolences to Corey Comperatore, his family and recognize his heroism in saving his daughter's lives and to the victims of that awful event. Now, Director Cheatle, would you agree that this is the most serious security lapse since President Reagan was shot in 1981 of the Secret Service?
 
CHEATLE: Yes, sir. I would.
 
KHANNA: And, you know, you know what Stuart Knight did when he was in charge at the time of the Secret Service? You know what he did, afterwards?
 
CHEATLE: He remained on duty. KHANNA: He resigned. He resigned. And Stuart Knight was not a Democratic appointee or Republican appointee. Look, I'm not questioning your judgment. I -- and I just don't think this is partisan. If you have an assassination attempt on a president, former president or a candidate, you need to resign. That's what Stuart Knight did. He was a Republican appointee. And he took responsibility. And I -- I think you need to reflect this is not a question of you, it's a question of the American people.
 
You cannot go leading a Secret Service Agency, when there is an assassination attempt on a presidential candidate. I -- I would say that about anyone who is running. And so I guess my question to you is, what's the difference between your position and what Stuart Knight did?
 
CHEATLE: What I will tell you, sir, is that I am dedicated to finding the answers to what happened. And like every Secret Service agent, we don't shirk from our responsibilities. I will remain on and be responsible to the agency to this Committee, to the former President and to the American public.
 
KHANNA: But is -- is there a reason you wouldn't just do what Stuart Knight did after the Reagan assassination attempt?
 <br>[11:30:05]
 
CHEATLE: I believe that I provided an answer.
 
KHANNA: There's -- there's nothing more that you have --</pre>
