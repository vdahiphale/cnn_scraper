(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR: Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us from all around the world. I'm Max Foster.
 
Just ahead, Iran remembers its late president Ebrahim Raisi. As new details emerge about the helicopter crash that killed him and eight others. 
 
Plus, a desperate situation intensifies as humanitarian aid groups struggle to get supplies into Gaza. Why the U.N. says Israel's military is to blame. 
 
And a midair nightmare. A Singapore Airlines flight hit severe turbulence killing one passenger and injuring several others.
 
UNKNOWN: Live from London, this is CNN Newsroom with Max Foster.
 
FOSTER: Beginning this hour in Tehran where huge crowds are packing the streets to pay their final respects to the late President Ebrahim Raisi. Right now, the funeral procession is heading towards Freedom Square.
 
The ceremony is part of Raisi's days-long funeral event. The country's foreign minister and seven others killed in a helicopter crash this weekend are also being honored. 
 
Just a short while ago, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei could be seen leading those prayers. Iran announced offices would be closed and a public holiday observed for the day of mourning.
 
Iranians also gathered in the Grand Mosalla Mosque on Tuesday to honor the late president after his body was flown into Tehran. The capital is just the latest stop in funeral ceremonies that began on Tuesday in the northwest city of Tabriz. They will continue on Thursday night in Mashhad where Raisi is set to be buried. The U.N. warns that Israel's military operations in north, south, and central Gaza and make it impossible to deliver aid to desperate civilians. One senior official says a situation in the enclave is worse than quote, hell on earth. UNRWA says its distribution center and the World Food Programme warehouse in Rafah, where a convoy raids (TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY), have kept the aid needed. The Pentagon acknowledges the issue.

PAT RYDER, PENTAGON PRESS SECRETARY: We have been able to get over 569 men on board for delivery. So, yes, very shortly, I think (TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY).
 
UNKNOWN: As of today. 
 
RYDER: As of today. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: CNN's Scott McLean joins us from Istanbul. 
 
Does he need (TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY) aid? Because, you know, the twin issues of borders being closed, (TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY) the fact that you can't get it out. 
 
SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that seems to be precisely the case, Max. And look, it's charged (TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY) in the Israeli prime minister and the defense minister warfare. And so, you think that the Israelis would be perking up, right? Right. 
 
(TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY) About a U.N. official yesterday telling the security camp, simply not enough fuel and supplies to actually meaningfully provide assistance to people in Gaza.
 
Yes, the Kerem Shalom crossing in southern Gaza, it is technically open. But because of the fighting in the area, because of the difficulties with coordination and logistics, it is getting in at a trickle.
 
And look, the Israelis say that hundreds of trucks have gotten through that crossing. But it seems, it appears at least, that those trucks are getting stuck in or around those crossing points because of the conditions on the ground. 
 
There are also security issues associated with that U.S. built pier, which went into operation on Friday. You saw desperate scenes over the weekend, people jumping onto those convoys and looting whatever boxes that they could get off of them. In some cases, those convoys were completely overwhelmed by people who completely ransacked them. 
 
And some of the people told CNN stringer on the ground that look, they didn't believe that this aid was actually going to get to the people of Palestine. They said that look, the U.S. has never supported the Palestinian cause. This is what they're saying. And they found it implausible that the U.S. would give something without expecting something in return. 
 <br>[03:05:01] 
 
Five hundred and seventy tons of aid is what the Pentagon says has gone through that pier thus far. But it's worth reminding people that 500 tons per day is what the initial goal of that pier was or the initial expectation of that pier was and even ramping up from there. 
 
And because of the security issues, what is getting through that pier is essentially being marshaled in that same area until they can figure out what to do with it. So, the U.S. says that they're working with the Israelis. They're working with the U.N. to try to provide safe routes to get it to warehouses or distribution points. But until they can figure that out, that aid is going to sit right there in the vicinity of that pier. 
 
Now, you know, we've heard, Max, of course, throughout the course of the war, the White House making suggestions, calling on the Israelis to do this, that or the other thing, and the Israelis not really being keen to take their advice.
 
The White House, though, in this case, insists that the Israelis are, in fact, listening and that they have incorporated specific advice. But on the other hand, you have UNRWA, who says that, look, food distribution in Rafah is not going ahead because they don't have enough to actually distribute. And because of the security situation on the ground, they also say that only seven of their 24 health facilities are currently operational and they have not gotten any supplies in the last 10 days.
 
And the W.H.O. -- W.H.O. chief is also calling on Israel to end what he is calling the blockade of aid and medical aid getting into the territory. 
 
FOSTER: OK, Scott, thank you. 
 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu once again lashing out at the pursuit of an International Criminal Court arrest warrant against him and his defense minister.
 
Speaking to CNN's Jake Tapper on Tuesday, he said claims of war crimes are based on a pack of lies. Mr. Netanyahu also laid out his plans for Gaza once the war is actually over, saying Israel has no intention of resettling the enclave and his goal is to defeat Hamas. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER: I have a very clear plan. I think the first thing the day after Hamas, Jake, is the day after Hamas. We have to get rid of Hamas. Otherwise, there's no future for Gaza, no future for peace. And it'll be a tremendous victory for not only for Hamas, but for the Iran terror axis that backs it and organizes Hezbollah, the Houthis, and all these other sundry terrorist organizations. So, I think we have to defeat Hamas and we will defeat Hamas. Rafah is
 
 the last stronghold of Hamas. Terrorist battalions will defeat them. That ends the intense part of the fighting. But once Hamas is defeated, what we have to do is have sustained the militarization of Gaza.
 
And yes, on this, I think the only force that can prevent the resurgence of terrorism for them for the foreseeable future is Israel. At the same time, we want, I want a civilian administration that is run by Gazans who are neither Hamas nor committed to our --
 
(CROSSTALK) 
 
JAKE TAPPER, CNN HOST: So, you're taking it off the table.
 
NETANYAHU: And the third thing that we need to do is -- no, I'm not. I'm putting it on the table on the contrary. No, that's what --
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
TAPPER: I'm not saying you're taking off an Israeli occupation of Gaza, of Gaza. You're taking off the table an Israeli --
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
NETANYAHU: If you mean -- if you mean resettling. If you mean resettling Gaza, yes, it was never in the cards. And I said so openly. And some of my constituents are not happy about it. But that's my position. 
 
The third thing that I would I would do is have a reconstruction of Gaza, if possible, done by the moderate Arab states and the international community. That's demilitarization, civilian administration by local Gazans who are not committed to Israel's destruction and responsible reconstruction.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: Well, let's stay in the region. Let's take you to Tehran. Look at those incredible scenes of mourners out mourning the loss of President Raisi, of course. We're not getting the pictures of people beyond these crowds. These are pictures coming to us from state television. There are those who aren't mourning, of course.
 
He was a divisive figure in the country. But this is the moment for those who are deeply affected by his death in a helicopter crash on Sunday, also the death of other people in his team. So, a big moment for Tehran, a big turning point, Paula Hancocks. 
 <br>[03:09:50]
 
PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Max, and these are the pictures that state media really wants to be shown around the world, that the fact that there is this this national mourning for the late President Raisi, for the late foreign minister, Abdollahian and seven others who this national mourning for the late President Raisi, for the for the late foreign minister Abdullahi and seven others who went down in that helicopter crash in the northwestern part of Iran on Sunday. 
 
Now, as we are seeing these pictures from state media, we are also hearing more about the investigation, finding out what exactly did happen on Sunday. And we have had some information from the chief of staff who was on one of the other helicopters on Sunday. There were three helicopters within the convoy, and he was on one of the other helicopters. 
 
He said that the weather was fine when they left the area where the VIPs had been inaugurating that dam project, and they left about 1 p.m. It was 45 minutes into the flight where they then said that there was a cloud and the pilot of Raisi's helicopter, who was in charge of the convoy, said that they had to ascend and increase altitude to try and avoid the cloud.
 
It is then that apparently Raisi's helicopter disappeared. The helicopter pilots that the chief of staff was in went back and tried to circle round and search for that helicopter. But was unable to see it, was unable to descend because of the cloud. And also, we understand, then could not make radio contact. 
 
Now, one of the other passengers on board with the late president, we understand one of the Friday prayer imams, he was able on the ground to answer a phone call from the pilot. He was -- he said they had crashed. He was severely injured. And we understand from the chief of staff he was alive for a further three hours before he, too, died. 
 
Now, those on the ground who saw the condition of the bodies of the other passengers said that they all died immediately as that plane crashed. 
 
So, these are the sort of details, Max, that investigators are going to be looking at very closely. The fact that there was weather, that there was this low hanging cloud, as we understood, that could have impeded the ability to have the visibility in this very sparsely populated mountainous, dense region, Max. 
 
FOSTER: OK, Paula Hancocks in Abu Dhabi. Thank you so much for that. We'll be revisiting this as well, including reporting from the scene for you later in the show. 
 
Now, Donald Trump is planning to attend a series of fundraisers later today in Texas. Now that his hush money trial is entering its final phase. The defense rested its case on Tuesday without the former U.S. president testifying. The jury will begin deciding Trump's fate next week.
 
CNN's Brynn Gingras brings us up to date. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The hush money trial of Donald Trump will soon be in the hands of a jury. 
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Very good. I think we have a great case was put on.
 
GINGRAS: Without hearing from the defendant, at least in the courtroom. 
 
TRUMP: The good news is they've not proven a case. There is no crime.
 
GINGRAS: Instead, jurors will be left with the key moments from the prosecution's three star witnesses. Michael Cohen, the former Trump fixer and prosecution's star witness, spending 17 hours on the stand testifying. 
 
He paid adult film actress Stormy Daniels, quote, at the direction of Donald J. Trump and for the benefit of Donald J. Trump to cover up their alleged affair, which Trump denies. Cohen said he paid the money to ensure that the story would not come out, would not affect Mr. Trump's chances of becoming president of the United States. 
 
In fierce cross-examination, the Trump defense got Cohen to admit he has at times been a liar and a thief. Also bringing up text messages and phone calls questioning Cohen's motives, including a tense confrontation between Cohen and defense attorney Todd Blanche over text messages Cohen sent to Trump's bodyguard Keith Schiller on October 24th, 2016.
 
Cohen had told prosecutors that he had reached out to Schiller to speak with Trump about the Daniels payment. But under cross- examination, Blanche read Cohen a text sent minutes before the call. Cohen texted Schiller, who can I speak to regarding harassing calls to my cell in office? The dope forgot to block his number. Schiller texted back soon after, call me. 
 
The exchange key as prosecutors need to prove Trump knew about the payments and violated campaign finance laws by authorizing them. Prosecutors highlighting a different call Cohen made to Stormy Daniels attorney Keith Davidson when Cohen expressed referring to Trump. I can't even tell you how many times he said to me, you know, I hate the fact that we did it. 
 
Earlier in the prosecution's case, David Pecker, the former chief of the National Enquirer, who called Trump a mentor, Pecker explaining how he worked with Cohen to catch and kill salacious stories about Trump, which defense attorneys painted as just usual business. 
 <br>[03:15:07]
 
Stormy Daniels may have been the testimony that angered Trump the most as she walked jurors through her alleged affair in vivid detail. Daniels explained how Cohen's interest in her story skyrocketed.
 
TRUMP: You know, I'm automatically attracted to beautiful. I just start kissing them. 
 
GINGRAS: After the infamous Access Hollywood tape and discussions about payments began days before the election, they were interested in paying for the story, Daniel said of Cohen and Trump. Defense attorneys painted Daniels as money hungry and driven by a hatred of the former president. 
 
Am I correct that you hate President Trump? Trump's attorney asked. Yes, Daniels replied. You want him to go to jail if he's found guilty? Absolutely. Daniels responded.
 
Brynn Gingras, CNN, New York.

FOSTER: After first targeting abortion rights, Trump suggested on Tuesday that he might impose restrictions on birth control. He told a local TV station in the battleground state of Pennsylvania that he was looking at contraceptives. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNKNOWN: Well, that suggests that you may want to support some restrictions like the morning after pill or something. 
 
TRUMP: We are -- we are also, you know, things really do have a lot to do with the states and some states are going to have different policies than others. But I'm coming out within a week or so with a very comprehensive policy, which I'll get to you immediately. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: But after those cryptic remarks, Trump backtracked, posting on Truth Social, I have never and will never advocate imposing restrictions on birth control or other contraceptives. I do not support a ban on birth control and neither will the Republican Party.
 
That may be news to some Republicans. The Biden campaign released a statement saying Trump wants to rip away our freedom to access birth control. 
 
Still ahead, a terrifying moment on board a flight from London to Singapore. Extreme turbulence at 37,000 feet. One passenger says all hell broke loose. 
 
And Kenya's leader lands in the U.S. ahead of his historic visit with the U.S. president. It comes as America's influence on the African continent is waning. 
 
Stay with us.

DZAFRAN AZMIR, PASSENGER, SINGAPORE AIRLINE FLIGHT SQ321: Especially the people within the laboratories and were the most injured from what I've seen. But I saw people from across the aisle just like, like going completely horizontal, hitting the ceiling and landing back down in like really awkward positions. People like getting massive gashes in their head, concussions. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: CNN's Ivan Watson is in Bangkok. He has the details. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Injuries and death after several minutes of terror more than 30,000 feet in the sky. A Singapore Airlines flight hit with severe turbulence throwing passengers and crew throughout the cabin 10 hours into the flight. 
 
The incident was so rough lighting and air ventilation tubing fell out of the ceiling. Food trays from breakfast littered across the floor. Emergency workers raced to Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi International Airport on Tuesday afternoon after the flight turned deadly. 
 
Traffic control on the tarmac quick to redirect ambulances and set up makeshift medical tents for injured passengers. Flight SQ321 departed from London and was en route to Singapore but severe turbulence forced pilots to make an emergency landing in Thailand. 
 
A 73-year-old British man Geoff Kitchen died on board the flight. At least seven others were in critical condition with dozens more injured. 
 
KITTIPONG KITTIKACHORN, GENERAL MANAGER, BANGKOK SUVARNABHUMI AIRPORT (through translator): The plane landed at the airport and the medical team was sent to the scene. Many injuries occurred so the airport had to issue an emergency plan. All our teams went to help. 
 
WATSON: The airline has launched has launched an investigation into the incident with the British Embassy also deploying officials to support those in the hospital. The passengers left with the question of how this all went so wrong.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
FOSTER: Anna Coren following developments for us from Hong Kong. I can't really get over that comment we had from one of the passengers saying someone went horizontal and hit the ceiling. 
 
ANNA COREN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, it's terrifying, right, Max, because we all get on planes, we all expect to fly safely to our destination and we've always just assumed that everything is going to be OK even when we have experienced that turbulence. 
 
But for these passengers there was no warning, certainly in the lead- up. The passengers who spoke to the media said that the seatbelt sign wasn't on, that as we saw from Ivan's piece, you know, they were midway through serving breakfast, people were walking around using the bathrooms, and suddenly the plane starts shaking, it tilts and then violently drops. And yes, people were flying through the cabin hitting the roof, you
 
 know, everything loose became a projectile. And yes, that 73-year-old British man Geoffrey Kitchen he died. We understand he had a heart condition. We're waiting for the results of the autopsy to determine the cause of death. But his wife was also on the plane and she is among the 71 people who have been injured. 
 
The plane obviously is in Bangkok and that is where the investigation will begin. We heard from the CEO of Singapore Airlines a little bit earlier he posted a message on social media. Let's take a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOH CHOON PHONG, CEO, SINGAPORE AIRLINES: On behalf of Singapore Airlines, I would like to express my deepest condolences to the family and loved ones of the deceased. We are very sorry for the traumatic experience that everyone on board SQ321 went through. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COREN: Now Max, we were waiting for an update from the hospital where 71 people are being treated. The able-bodied, the healthy, they flew on to Singapore which was their final destination. But we have to remember, you know, Singapore Airlines is one of the best and safest airlines in the world. 
 
But this investigation, obviously the Singapore Transport Safety Investigation Bureau is involved as is the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board because this is a Boeing 777 airliner, so hence, they are sending representatives. 
 
You know, we know that there were storms in the area at the time as this plane was flying over Myanmar, but you know, experts believe that it could have been affected by what they call clear air turbulence which they say is incredibly difficult for pilots and radar to detect. 
 
FOSTER: OK, Anna Coren in Hong Kong. Thank you for that. 
 
Elvis Presley's granddaughter is suing to stop the sale of the late singer's historic Memphis home Graceland. She says the purported company behind the sale doesn't exist, there's no rights to the property. 
 <br>[03:24:59]
 
Court documents obtained by CNN show the granddaughter who currently owns the property got a restraining order against any sale whilst the court rules on her application for an injunction. 
 
Her lawsuit says the investment company produced fraudulent documents to take ownership of Graceland last year after loaning Elvis's granddaughter rather, close to $4 million using the property's collateral. CNN wasn't able to reach anyone from the investment company or find a valid business license. 
 
Now new allegations have been brought against rapper Sean Diddy Combs just days after he issued a public apology for abusing a former girlfriend. Former model Crystal McKinney has filed a lawsuit against Combs claiming the rapper drugged her and sexually assaulted her in 2003 when they met at a New York fashion event. 
 
She's suing Combs under a New York law allowing more time to take civil action after gender-motivated acts of violence by extending the statute of limitations. 
 
This latest lawsuit comes days after surveillance footage showed Combs physically attacking his then girlfriend Cassie Ventura back in 2016. 
 
Well, still to come, a multinational security mission aimed at battling deadly gangs in Haiti gets underway. We hear from America's top diplomat about what's expected. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
FOSTER: Kenyan President William Ruto has touched down in the U.S. ahead of his visit to the White House today. It is the first official trip to the U.S. by an African leader since 2008, would you believe? The visit comes as Russia and China continue to grow their investments on the continent while America's pull in the region is waning. 
 
CNN's Larry Madowo joins me now from Nairobi. 
 
It's interesting this, isn't it, seeing, you know, that there's a different power shift from what we'll often see. The U.S. really having to, you know, make a much bigger effort with all African leaders. 
 
LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: They really have to, Max. And here's the thing. China builds shiny things that make a big splash in Africa. Roads and railways and ports. Things that employ a lot of people that really stand as monuments to their growing power on the continent. 
 
On the other hand, European powers and the United States often spend a lot of time, what Africans say, lecturing about democracy and human rights. And that's what they're on the back foot here. That is a background for this trip by President William Ruto to the White House, the first by an African head of state since 2008. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MADOWO (voice-over): Kenya's President William Ruto beginning a historic state visit to the United States in Atlanta. His American charm offensive following last month's meeting with the U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo in Nairobi. 
 <br>[03:30:03]
 
GINA RAIMONDO, U.S. SECRETARY OF COMMERCE: I said to him, we're not here to lecture. We're here to partner. We're here to learn from you. We're here to invest.
 
MADOWO (on camera):  Why is the U.S. the best over say China or Russia that also making big moves into the continent? Why is the US the best for African countries? 
 
RAIMONDON:  There aren't strings attached. It's an opportunity to partner together. So, that's why we think we're the partner of choice.
 
MADOWO (voice-over):  China has built major infrastructure projects across Africa despite criticism from Western countries about lack of transparency and predatory loans. Russia's influence is also expanding especially in weapon sales and military ties. The Kenyan president is a key U.S. ally on the continent and this week's state visit is the first by an African head of state in 16 years.
 
But William Ruto did not pick a favorite partner nation when asked directly ahead of his trip to Washington.
 
WILLIAM RUTO, PRESIDENT OF KENYA:  The best partner for us is the one that accepts to have a deal that is a win-win. We will be having conversation about the Africa Growth and Opportunities Act, the AGOA, that gives us duty-free quarter free access to the American market with our goods.
 
MADOWO (voice-over):  African nations want the 24-year-old AGOA renewed before it expires next year. But some like Rwanda have been blocked from access in the U.S. market. That country's president, Paul Kagame, stood his ground in a dispute linked to a 2019 ban on some clothing imports, a move designed to develop its local textile industry. 
 
PAUL KAGAME, PRESIDENT OF RWANDA:  I wanted to clarify the level of hypocrisy and all kinds of stuff we have to deal with. You know, they forced it upon us. They say you must accept these second-hand clothes, and we told them no. So, they say okay. We would strike you off AGOA, which they did.
 
MADOWO (voice-over):  America's influence has declined in Africa.
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Africa is an indispensable global partner.
 
MADOWO (voice-over):  China has overtaken the U.S. and soft power on the continent according to a recent Gallup poll.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
MADOWO (on camera):  That poll saw the U.S. drop about three percentage points, but China goes up six percentage points in approval ratings on the continent and you can see part of the reason why. The Rwandan president, Paul Kagame, highlighted what he calls hypocrisy that Rwanda wanted to develop its local textile industry and the U.S. said no if we cannot send second and clothes to your country then no, you're off the AGOA, which is an important part of being able to access the U.S. market and that is what the U.S. is up against on the continent, Max.
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN HOST:  A fascinating trip, Larry, in Nairobi. Thank you. Let's go back to Tehran, see the latest images. A ceremony to be held today for the late President Raisi and other members of his team who died in that helicopter crash on Sunday. Big crowds as you can see, very much sort of image the country wants to project right now. And Fred Pleitgen is there. What do you see Fred? 
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there, Max. I'm actually in the middle of those very big crowds and you are absolutely right. They're very large. I would say that we saw hundreds of thousands of people go past us. We also saw behind me the caskets of those who were killed in that helicopter crash go past us as well. And that's really been the main part of this very large procession (ph) as you can see.
 
The people around me here now (inaudible) to Israel because on the one hand, I think they do believe that it was accident (inaudible), but on the other hand, they somehow show and kind of hold the U.S. and Israel responsible for it. So, these are the kinds of chants that we've actually been getting a lot of (inaudible). However, nonetheless, this procession has been extremely large and I think there's two things that the Iranian government is trying to project right now.
 
One of them is to see the sense of mourning for those who were killed. And the other thing is of course, stability. One of the things that the Supreme Leader of this country said even while the capital (ph) is still missing, was that there would be no disruption in the activities of the Iranian government.
 
Of course, we also know that they already set a date for the election of a new president which is set to happen on June 28th. So, they're moving very quickly while at the same time, of course, people that you speak to on the ground, they are saying they want to know what's next for Iran. A lot of them believe that the election that's coming up could actually be quite important even pivotal for this country to see whether or not Iran goes further in the direction or in politics of being very hard line of control and conservative or whether or not it goes into a more moderate direction, Max. 
 
FOSTER:  Okay, Fred Pleitgen, it's a noisy crowd there, which is interesting to see the reaction there amongst the late President Raisi's supporters at least out in force in Tehran.
 <br>[03:34:58]
 
Now, breaking news into CNN. We've just heard that Norway, Ireland and Spain have all announced they will recognize a Palestinian state. As of next Tuesday, the Norwegian prime minister cites the ongoing war in Gaza saying quote, "It's clear that achieving peace and stability must be predicted on -- or predicated rather, on resolving the Palestinian question." 
 
He also says it sends a strong message to other countries to follow Norway's example and could give renewed momentum as well to the idea of a two-state solution with Israel, which many of its allies want. Still to come, Japan struggles to manage an influx of tourists. Measures is taken to keep sites like Mount Fuji clean and uncrowded.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) FOSTER:  French actor Gerard Depardieu is accused of assaulting a celebrity photographer known as the King of the Paparazzi" in Rome. Local reports say it happened outside the famed Harry's Bar after photographer Rino Barillari snapped pictures of the actor, his partner, and two others whilst they were dining. There are conflicting accounts about the fight and how it began, but the bar's owner says Barillari was taken to hospital. Police say they're looking for surveillance video from the area.
 
Barillari has published several books of his images which include Popes, present stars like Sylvester Stallone and Liz Taylor, too. He even claimed to traded punches with Frank Sinatra and he says he's been to the emergency room 200 times after being attacked by his subjects.
 
Now, a Japanese city at the base of Mount Fuji has put up a large barrier to block tourists from a popular selfie spot. A Tourism boom in the country has created traffic and other problems and locals have had enough. CNN's Hanako Montgomery explains how Japan is trying to solve the problem.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
HANAKO MONTGOMERY (voice-over):  This view once the perfect snapshot of Japan's old and new, now has a black curtain drawn. Overwhelmed by tourists blocking roads, littering, even trespassing onto private property to take selfies. The town of Fujikawaguchiko has now erected a black curtain to block the view and deter tourists, much to the local's relief.
 
UNKNOWN (voice-over):  There have been many accidents involving foreign tourists recently.
 
MONTGOMERY (voice-over):  And to the dismay of visitors.
 
UNKNOWN:  So, I think put a black panel on this road is something with brute force and I think they can do better for (inaudible).
 
MONTGOMERY (voice-over):  Mount Fuji, a UNESCO World Heritage site and a Japanese icon attracts millions of visitors annually. But post pandemic, numbers have swelled to record levels well beyond control local authorities say, causing human traffic jams and garbage to litter the sacred peak.
 <br>[03:40:06]
 
The local prefecture now says it needs to charge $13 per climber and impose a daily hiker cap of 4,000 in a bid to address over tourism starting this season. 
 
(On camera):  But as you can tell by the crowds of people around me here one of Tokyo's biggest tourist hotspots, Mount Fuji isn't the only victim of over tourism. It's a nationwide problem.
