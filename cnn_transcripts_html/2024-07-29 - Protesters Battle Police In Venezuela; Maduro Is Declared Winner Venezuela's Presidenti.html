<br>[18:00:00]
 
JAKE TAPPER, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST: And I will see you tomorrow.
 
JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST: -- Seoul, midnight in Paris, and 6:00 p.m. here in New York. I'm Julia Chatterley. And wherever you are in 
 
 the world, this is your "First Move."
 
A warm welcome to "First Move," as always. And here's today's need to know. Caracas clash. Protestors battle police across Venezuela. As Nicolas Maduro 
 
 is declared the winner of this weekend's disputed presidential election.
 
Paying the price, Israel's defense chief says Hezbollah will be held responsible for the deadly rocket strike that killed 12 children this 
 
 weekend.
 
Family fortunes, speculation mounts in North Korea over just who will succeed Kim Jong Un.
 
And, talking tiger trafficking on World Tiger Day. We meet the man fighting to protect some of the world's most magnificent and endangered cats. That 
 
 conversation and plenty more coming up.
 
But first, protests in Venezuela after Nicolas Maduro was formally declared the winner of Sunday's presidential election by an election council that's 
 
 loyal to him. Demonstrators taken to the streets amid allegations the election was rigged, we've seen protesters topple a statue of the late Hugo 
 
 Chavez and police deploying tear gas.
 
Multiple nations, including the United States, expressing skepticism over the results. The Venezuela now expelling diplomatic staff from a number of 
 
 neighboring nations.
 
What you're seeing there is in Caracas, where many took to their windows, banging pots and pans in protest. Meanwhile in Argentina, Venezuelans 
 
 protested too outside their embassy. Millions of Venezuelans have moved abroad since Nicolas Maduro became president, with many hoping for an 
 
 opposition win and the chance to return.
 
Stefano Pozzebon is live in Caracas with more for us now. Stefano, I know you've been talking to a number of the protesters that are taking risks 
 
 individually, even being out there. I believe the police just cleared that street. What have they been saying to you?
 
STEFANO POZZEBON, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, Julia, we were here for about an hour and a half. This was a essentially a battlefield where the Venezuelan 
 
 police is down at the bottom of that road. They shot up a lot of tear gas and that's why we had to use our gas masks. And as you can see, they've 
 
 cleared all of these avenue, which, by the way, we're talking about a business show here, you and I, Julia.
 
This is the Caracas Central Business District. That building over there is the Caracas Stock Exchange. And today, there is no business going on in 
 
 Caracas. You still have a few protesters down the road over there. What they've been telling me it's the same that have been told in me since I 
 
 came here to Venezuela in early July, that they felt that this election obeyed not free nor fair, was competitive and that it was the real shot to 
 
 restore democracy in this country. And they hope to put an end to the dramatic economic crisis that has engulfed Venezuela since Maduro became 
 
 president.
 
Now, with that announcement in the early hours of Monday saying that Maduro has won this election by the heavily aligned by with the national 
 
 government electoral control. And here we go. Here we have the Venezuelan police going up to chase more protesters. You can see them. They mostly 
 
 drive-up motorcycles with a driver and then another policeman in the back with tear gas rifles and tear gas grenades. They're going to probably go up 
 
 on that road to chase up more protester.
 
This has been the situation in Caracas for pretty much the last couple of hours, Julia, with protesters arriving here, taking to the streets, 
 
 throwing rocks, throwing empty glass bottles, expressing their dissent. They've been telling us that they want this country to be free. They want 
 
 Maduro to get out of power. And here you see more and more policemen surrounding us.
 
CHATTERLEY: And just so our viewers are aware, Stefano, I mean, the attorney general earlier today said protesters, if they're convicted, face 
 
 up to 20 years in prison. That's how high the stakes are. What does the opposition do in this situation?
 <br>[18:05:00]
 
Because they've also said, look, we think we won. And I know we're waiting for a press conference to hear more from them, but how do they defend the 
 
 truth, particularly if there is some kind of call against election fraud when the government effectively controls the Supreme Court and they would 
 
 be the arbiter of the decision maker in any claims of election fraud? What are their options?
 
POZZEBON: Absolutely. I think that they are very well aware that their options lay with the International Community. We know that the opposition 
 
 is meant to release a statement or hold a presser in the next few minutes, frankly. It was meant to be at 6:00 p.m. to fix their line, to set their 
 
 line after Maduro today was proclaimed -- formally proclaimed the winner of that election that took place yesterday.
 
A lot of statements from other countries in Latin America. A lot of statements from countries like Chile, Argentina, Peru, Costa Rica, who have 
 
 urged the electoral authority to release the ballot documents, to give up to on transparency and share all of the results that have been given. That 
 
 hasn't happened yet.
 
And so, the opposition is trying to fire up support in the International Community. You can probably feel that Venezuela will have -- will go 
 
 through further isolation in the next few weeks and perhaps months, unless this impasse is resolved, Julia.
 
But yes, that image of the attorney general going onto television earlier today, around lunchtime in Venezuela. He went on national television. 
 
 threatening with putting every protesters in prison for up to 20 years. And that gives you an idea of how tense the situation is right now in the 
 
 streets of Caracas when the attorney general of the country comes with that type of statement on national television at lunchtime.
 
Here we are. Just less than 24 hours after that announcement, the clashes are back in Venezuela's streets.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes, that's what they're risking and what they've got to lose. And yet, they're still out on the streets. Stefano, thank you for that 
 
 report there from Caracas.
 
All right. Now, to the Middle East and the aftermath of Saturday's attack in the Israeli occupied Golan Heights that claimed the lives of 12 
 
 children. Israel's defense minister calling the attack a "significant escalation" and declaring Hezbollah responsible for the strike. The 
 
 Iranian-backed Lebanese militant group denies the attack, and a number of nations now have advised their citizens to leave Lebanon. Jeremy Diamond is 
 
 in the Israeli occupied City of Haifa for us.
 
Jeremy, good to have you with us. What might this escalation look like? Is this concern and caution over indeed some form of greater escalation has 
 
 made everybody, I think, cautious at this moment?
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT: No question about it. Julia. The Israeli prime minister vowing today that there will be a severe 
 
 response. And so, that much is clear. Whether that response will tilt this long simmering conflict between Israel and Hezbollah to all-out war is 
 
 another question altogether. And there certainly are efforts being made at this hour by diplomats from multiple countries to try and avert such a 
 
 dangerous escalation.
 
All of this happening as the community of Majdal Shams still recovering from the absolute tragedy that occurred there, 12 children dead and a 
 
 community shaken to its core.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DIAMOND (voice-over): Sirens pierce the serenity of this town in the Israeli controlled Golan Heights. And in an instant, this explosion will 
 
 shatter the very soul of the Druze community that lives here. As residents and first responders rush to the scene, the horror of the strike becomes 
 
 clear. A soccer field, children's bikes, pools of blood between them. 12 children, the youngest just 10 years old, torn from this life.
 
DIAMOND: It was 6:00 p.m. on a hot summer evening, dozens of children were playing on this soccer field right behind me when suddenly sirens rang out. 
 
 Seconds later, a rocket made impact just right here, where in its place now stands this black flag of mourning.
 
But one of the most devastating parts of all of this, as you see this scene frozen in time, is the fact that right behind us was safety, a bomb 
 
 shelter. But there simply was not enough time for these children to get inside.
 
DIAMOND (voice-over): It is the deadliest attack on civilians in Israel or Israeli controlled territory since October 7th, and it is now raising the 
 
 specter of all-out war.
 
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Hezbollah, with Iranian backing, launched an Iranian missile here, which took the 
 
 lives of 12 pure souls. The State of Israel will not and cannot put this to rest. Our response will come, and it will be severe.
 <br>[18:10:00]
 
DIAMOND (voice-over): Hezbollah denies responsibility. The prime minister's visit wasn't welcomed by all in the Syrian Druze community, where most are 
 
 not Israeli citizens. CNN arrived on the scene just hours after the strike, where Taymor Wili was still trying to process what he had seen.
 
TAYMOR WILI, WITNESSED STRIKE: Well, at first, I saw the injured children running around. I saw blood. They didn't respond to us. They were 
 
 panicking. I saw a lot of guys gathering here. Most of them didn't go down. I went down here and I saw a lot of things that are way too gruesome to 
 
 mention out of respect for the families. And we tried to help, but it was beyond our help. Like, there's nothing we can do.
 
DIAMOND (voice-over): In Majdal Shams, mourning is all that remains. Thousands gathered here to pay their final respects. With each casket, 
 
 another wave of cries and wails. As nightmares turn into crushing reality, where photos of smiling children like 11-year-old Alma can only mean one 
 
 thing.
 
I reached the stadium and, in the corner, I saw dead bodies and body parts, Alma's father says. When I got closer to one of them, I saw a bracelet. I 
 
 knew it was Alma.
 
Ayman Fakhr El-Din is only just beginning to process the loss of his only daughter.
 
DIAMOND: She liked soccer, huh?
 
AYMAN FAKHR EL-DIN: Yes, yes, yes. Like sport, all sport. And basketball, yes.
 
DIAMOND (voice-over): Alma is a child filled with energy. She loved life. She was special in school and in athletics, he says. He now calls on his 
 
 son, Rayan (ph), for comfort.
 
DIAMOND: This is her big brother. Still hard, huh, Rayan?
 
DIAMOND (voice-over): Rayan's (ph) grief is still all too fresh.
 
DIAMOND: Rayan (ph), what do you remember about your sister? What do you want people to know about your sister?
 
DIAMOND (voice-over): Everything about her was lovely, her brother says. She liked to play just like any other kid. In the end, we have a room 
 
 without Alma.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHATTERLEY: Jeremy, it's heartbreaking to watch. Part of the response that the Israelis have to decide upon here in terms of retaliation also will 
 
 figure into the ongoing negotiations, talks over a potential ceasefire and a hostage release. Where does that stand today, particularly in light of 
 
 what we saw this weekend?
 
DIAMOND (on camera): Yes, there's no question about it, Julia, that this rocket attack came at a very sensitive time on the eve of the mediators 
 
 meeting with the parties in Rome to discuss the latest Israeli response to these ongoing negotiations. And today, we are learning that Hamas is 
 
 effectively accusing Israel of setting "new conditions and demand," saying that Netanyahu has returned to what they call a strategy of 
 
 procrastination, evasion, and avoiding reaching an agreement.
 
The Israeli prime minister's office denies those claims by Hamas and says that Israel's demands stands on its principles according to the original 
 
 outline. What is clear, though, is that we have learned over the course of the last several weeks that the Israeli prime minister has made several 
 
 11th hour demands to these negotiations, ideas that were not included in the original Israeli proposal, which President Biden laid out several weeks 
 
 ago.
 
And so, now, we are at a point of considerable uncertainty in terms of the fate of those ceasefire negotiations. And as you said, this all does very 
 
 much factor into what is happening between Israel and Hezbollah as well. If there is a ceasefire agreement, that could potentially open up the way for 
 
 a negotiated settlement between Israel and Hezbollah as well to stop those cross-border exchanges.
 
But right now, it goes beyond, of course, the possibility of a ceasefire. We are now talking about a very real risk of escalation as Israel promises 
 
 this severe response and as we wait to see what that might be. Julia.
 
CHATTERLEY: Jeremy Diamond there for us. Thank you for that report. OK. Now, to the City of Light, where the timetable for Olympic triathlon events 
 
 are looking decidedly more murky.
 
France has spent around $1.5 billion to clean up the River Seine to ensure swimming events are safe. But Friday's torrential rain during the opening 
 
 ceremony also flushed dangerous pollution downstream. Meaning the triathlon could be reduced to a duathlon with just the running and cycling events 
 
 maintained. However, don't panic just yet, Olympic organizers are still saying everything will run as planned.
 
Now, Melissa Bell even took a dip in the Seine earlier this month, as some of you might remember. We've got more from her from Paris.
 <br>[18:15:00]
 
MELISSA BELL, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Uncertainty and worry. Triathlon swimming training sessions cancelled two 
 
 days in a row at the Paris Olympics on account of the poor water quality levels of the River Seine after the heavy rain that drenched Friday's 
 
 opening ceremony.
 
The gamble to make the Seine swimmable for the Olympics was always a big one, with more than $1.5 billion spent trying to clean a river in which 
 
 swimming had been illegal for more than a century. City Mayor Anne Hidalgo even went for a dip earlier this month to show the world what had been 
 
 achieved. I decided to do the same and see it for myself.
 
BELL: It's actually really not as smelly as I thought it would be and feels not quite clean, but certainly swimmable.
 
BELL (voice-over): The mayor later told me that cleaning the Seine was about much more than just the Olympics.
 
ANNE HIDALGO, PARIS MAYOR: Clean the Seine is for the -- our generation and next generation live with nature.
 
BELL (voice-over): As for the games, planners were counting on dry weather to help. But after the weekend rain, it's a race against time. With the 
 
 men's triathlon scheduled for Tuesday and the women's for Wednesday. Not a problem, said the deputy mayor for sports when I spoke to him earlier this 
 
 month.
 
PIERRE RABADAN, DEPUTY PARIS MAYOR FOR SPORTS, OLYMPIC AND PARALYMPIC GAMES: We don't work on the plan B because we have contingency days. So, we 
 
 are able to move the competition for several days. So, we will be able to make the competition in the river. Don't worry about it.
 
BELL (voice-over): But in an interview with CNN's Amanda Davies, the head of World Triathlon sounded slightly more ominous.
 
MARISOL CASADO, PRESIDENT, WORLD TRIATHLON: I mean, the worst scenario, at the very end, if it's needed, this is in our rules and regulations, we will 
 
 convert it in duathlon, that is run, cycling, and run again.
 
BELL (voice-over): While some athletes CNN, has spoken to, are worried, others, like Bermuda's first ever Olympic champion Flora Duffy, remain 
 
 upbeat.
 
FLORA DUFFY, OLYMPIC TRIATHLON CHAMPION: I know that there's a lot of protocols in place to ensure that we have proper water quality so that we 
 
 can race a triathlon come race day. So, for me, I'm confident that we will be able to swim.
 
BELL (voice-over): With a hot and sunny weather forecast on the horizon, organizers are hoping once again that the triathlon events will go ahead as 
 
 planned with fingers firmly crossed.
 
Melissa Bell, CNN, Paris.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHATTERLEY: That's one reporting job Melissa Bell won't forget in a hurry. Now, up next, here on "First Move," you're up to the minute weather 
 
 forecast as always.
 
Plus, the North Korean succession spotlight. Why Kim Jong Un's preteen daughter could be next in line to rule the nuclear armed nation.
 
And, a big cat conservation. How one Bangkok-based organization is helping save the lives of tigers threatened by illegal wildfire trafficking.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:20:41]
 
CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to "First Move." And in today's "Money Move," U.S. stocks looking less than spry as investors eye the end of July. Wall Street 
 
 closing out a volatile day of trading. Little changed ahead of a key week for investors. We've got a Federal Reserve policy meeting, a U.S. jobs 
 
 report and earnings from four of the magnificent seven tech stocks all on tap.
 
Tesla. was a notable winner, up more than 5 percent after Morgan Stanley called it a top pick. McDonald's shares meanwhile higher despite reporting 
 
 its first global sales drop since the pandemic due to a more cautious consumer.
 
A strong start to the trading week in Asia too, with the Nikkei breaking an eight-session losing streak. Investors awaiting the Bank of Japan's policy 
 
 decision. That comes on Wednesday. A rate hike from the BOJ is in play as Japanese inflation pushes higher.
 
Now, staying in the region, call her perhaps the best kept secret in very secretive North Korea. Experts now say the family member most likely to 
 
 succeed leader Kim Jong Un is his pre-teen daughter, believed to be around 10 years old. But she's not the only female in the nation whose political 
 
 star is on the rise. As Will Ripley reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): North Korea's most powerful man making an emotional appeal to women. Kim Jong-un 
 
 wiping away tears, urging moms to have more babies, to boost the plunging birth rate. Pyongyang's patriarch persists, observers say, but things may 
 
 be changing in Kim's Korea.
 
The North Korean leader bringing powerful women into his orbit. Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui who recently met with Russian President Vladimir 
 
 Putin. Kim's younger sister Kim Yo Jong, a close aid and trusted confidante, famous for fiery speeches.
 
And this dramatic demolition of the Inter-Korean liaison office. The younger Kim's meteoric rise likely fueled by her close brotherly bond and 
 
 powerful Kim family bloodline. The family photo that shook the world, the supreme leader revealing his daughter believed to be Kim Ju-ae at a missile 
 
 launch in late 2022, the first in a series of carefully staged father- daughter photo-ops, elevating the profile of Kim's elementary-aged child, 
 
 raising questions about succession.
 
LEE SUNG-YOON, WILSON CENTER FELLOW: Kim Jong Un is saying by appearing in public with his daughter, my nukes are here to stay, and my power will be 
 
 handed down to my progeny or maybe somebody else, his sibling.
 
RIPLEY (voice-over): For three generations, the men of the Kim family ruling North Korea with an iron fist. Now, many wonder could a woman be 
 
 next in line? Could Kim be grooming his own daughter to someday take command of North Korea's growing nuclear arsenal?
 
LEE: The power will be kept. This absolute power will maintain, will be maintained in the family.
 
RIPLEY (voice-over): A family where the women seem to be faring better than the men. Kim's own uncle, Jang Song-thaek, seen halfheartedly clapping when 
 
 Kim came to power, South Korean lawmakers said he was executed by anti- aircraft guns, and possibly decapitated, Former President Trump claimed.
 
Kim's exiled older half-brother, Kim Jong-nam, assassinated by poison at a Malaysia airport. Whoever the next North Korean leader is, man or woman, 
 
 Kim's top priority, analysts say, protecting his family's fortune and power.
 
RIPLEY: Historians on both sides of the political spectrum, left and right, agree that North Korea has essentially perfected the model of the 
 
 totalitarian state. They have near total control of information, very heavy propaganda. They surveil the population. It is a recipe, experts say, for 
 
 success for the next North Korean leader, whether they be a man or woman, especially given the size of Kim Jong Un's nuclear arsenal.
 
Will Ripley, CNN, Taipei.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHATTERLEY: OK. Thanks to Will there. Now, more than 100 wildfires are now raging across western United States and Canada, destroying homes, injuring 
 
 residents and forcing evacuations. There is hope, though, for firefighters battling the blazes with lighter winds and cooler weather for the 
 
 Northwest.
 
But for the central and southeastern part of the United States, a potentially significant heat wave is expected to develop. A heat wave is 
 
 already starting to warm up the Olympics in Paris.
 <br>[18:25:00]
 
Meteorologist Chad Myers joins us now. I think after the torrential downpours this weekend, they'll take any amount of heat, quite frankly, 
 
 over in Paris. But where do you want to start, Chad?
 
CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST: We'll start out in Jasper, Alberta, because more pictures are now coming in. We know how much damage was done to the 
 
 town from the north and from the south. Two different fire lines, and the firefighters are trying to get a handle on two separate fires coming into 
 
 the town from two different locations. We have more than 100 wildfires out there, 90 in the U.S. alone, and many of them are still completely out of 
 
 control. The smoke in the west is now choking some people out there, certainly unhealthy for sensitive groups when you can see it in the air and 
 
 you can begin to smell the smoke from the wildfires.
 
Moving to China, where we had the typhoon last week moved onshore, didn't really have much wind left, but it had a lot of humidity left. It had rain 
 
 left. And in the Hunan Province, saw an awful lot of rainfall there. And some spots as it kind of collected itself with a cold front. That's where 
 
 the heaviest rain was really focused, really located, not widespread, but widespread enough to get those flooding pictures there.
 
Yes, it gets hot in Paris tonight for you. The warm air comes in from Spain. It comes up and we're going to see temperatures that have been in 
 
 Southern France, like Bordeaux, that were well above 37 today, that weather is going to get into Paris proper for Tuesday into Wednesday, and then, 
 
 finally, cool back down a little bit by the end of the week.
 
But back up to well above normal, 37 for Paris on Tuesday, and then where you should be in the upper middle 20s, finally back there by Friday, 
 
 Saturday, and Sunday. So, a couple of hot days, especially in Southern France for those events that are down there.
 
Remember, not every event is in Paris. This is all across France, all the way from the south to the north. And of course, we even have that -- the 
 
 surfing competition in French Polynesia. Had a couple storms there, kind of slowed things down or even canceled it for a couple of days. But yes, 
 
 everywhere in France having some type of game, some type of event, and some type of hot weather for tomorrow.
 
CHATTERLEY: That's the perfect tease to later on in the show as well, because we're going to be talking about the surfing, but I also can see a 
 
 thunderstorm cloud on Wednesday in Paris. So, we'll skip over that. More rain. Chad, great to have you with us. Thank you. OK. Stay with "First 
 
 Move." We'll be right back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:30:31]
 
CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to "First Move" with a look at more international headlines this hour. Heartbreaking scenes in Northern England where two 
 
 children have been killed and nine others injured in a knife attack. The stabbings occurring at a Taylor Swift themed event at a dance school in 
 
 Southport. Police have arrested a teenager. King Charles is sending his condolences on social media saying his family was "profoundly shocked."
 
For Former BBC presenter Huw Edwards has been charged by police of making indecent images of children. The News at Ten anchor was arrested in 
 
 November of last year. The 62-year-old is due to appear in court on Wednesday.
 
The U.S., Australia, India, and Japan have announced new measures to enhance maritime security. The members of the so-called Quad met in Tokyo 
 
 to discuss improving defenses amid growing tensions in the South China Sea. They didn't directly identify China as the cause of the tensions. Beijing 
 
 saying in a statement that the Quad is to blame for inciting confrontation.
 
And here in the United States, Joe Biden looking to make the U.S. Supreme Court less supreme. The U.S. president on Monday calling for a host of 
 
 major reforms, including term limits and a new ethics code for justices that he believes will make the court less polarizing and more accountable.
 
The plan, however, getting no terms of endearment from Republicans as Paula Reid reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PAULA REID, CNN CHIEF LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Tonight, President Biden calling for major reforms to the Supreme Court.
 
JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: The Court is being used to weaponize an extreme and unchecked agenda.
 
REID (voice-over): Speaking at an event in Austin, Texas, he laid out his plan, which would allow a president to select a justice every two years and 
 
 limit those justices to 18-year terms.
 
BIDEN: That would make timing for the course nomination more predictable, unless arbitrary. Reduce the chance that any single presence imposes undue 
 
 influence in generations to come.
 
REID (voice-over): And implement a binding code of conduct requiring disclosure of gifts, no public political activity, and recusal from cases 
 
 where justice's family has a stake. The court's current code is voluntary and has no enforcement mechanism.
 
BIDEN: The court is not self-policing. The court is not dealing with the obvious conflicts of interest. We need a mandatory code of ethics for the 
 
 Supreme Court and we need it now.
 
REID (voice-over): He also-called for a constitutional amendment that would make it clear there is no immunity for crimes a former president commits 
 
 while in office. He previously criticized the court for its recent decision and Donald Trump's claim of immunity.
 
BIDEN: This nation was founded on the principle that there are no kings in America. Each of us is equal before the law.
 
REID (voice-over): The call for action comes as approval ratings for the court hover at historic lows. A recent poll in May found that 61 percent of 
 
 Americans disapprove of the job the court is doing. But Biden's plan would require congressional action on a highly partisan issue.
 
Today, Republican leaders in both chambers promising it's going nowhere fast with Speaker Mike Johnson saying it's dead-on arrival in the House and 
 
 Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell calling the proposal an attack on the court.
 
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, (R-KY) MINORITY LEADER: An all-out campaign against the court's legitimacy and ultimately against its very existence.
 
REID (voice-over): And on the 2024 campaign trail, the Supreme Court remains a hot button issue.
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: She will try as hard as she can to add as many justices as possible to the 
 
 U.S. Supreme Court. We don't want that to happen, do we?
 
REID (voice-over): Leonard Leo, who helped Trump install a conservative supermajority on the high court, issued a rare statement rebuking Biden's 
 
 plan. If Democrats want to adopt an across-the-board ethics ban for all branches, I am in favor of that. Until they support that, let's all be 
 
 honest about what this is, a campaign to destroy a court that they disagree with.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHATTERLEY: Our thanks to Paula Reid there. Now, coming up for ours, conservation efforts to save these majestic cats. After a century of 
 
 decline, wild tiger numbers are in fact climbing, but plenty more needs to be done. That next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:37:30]
 
CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to "First Move." It's International Tiger Day, and despite global efforts to protect this endangered species, they're still at 
 
 great risk. Both commercial poaching and habitat destruction pose the biggest threats to their survival. Steven Galster is the founder of the 
 
 Freeland Foundation. It's an anti-trafficking group based in Bangkok. The foundation trains rangers and helps police coordinate the fight against 
 
 wildlife poaching, as well as human slavery too.
 
Now, I should warn you, the following images show the consequences of poaching and are extremely distressing. People still buy tiger bones in 
 
 auctions on the black market. The bones are believed to have medicinal value and can be as expensive, in certain cases, as cocaine. Freeland 
 
 provides training in Thailand, Malaysia, Laos, and Vietnam to catch poachers in the act, and it also carries out tiger surveillance. These 
 
 night vision cameras in Thailand provide a front row view of these truly dangerous magnificent creatures.
 
Steven Galster joins us now. He's in Nairobi, Kenya building counter wildlife trafficking task forces there too. Steven, you are busy all over 
 
 the world. Just start by explaining where we are today, because I think some of our viewers will be aware of dramatic population collapse over the 
 
 course of several decades. Where are we today?
 
STEVEN GALSTER, FOUNDER, FREELAND: Well, the tiger -- it was sort of 10, 12 years ago, population numbers are now up about 40 percent since that time. 
 
 So, that's good. That's impressive. There's hope, but the tiger is far from out of the woods because we're basically talking about a species that lost 
 
 97 percent of its numbers in the last century due to habitat destruction and poaching. So, we've got a long way to go with tigers.
 
CHATTERLEY: How much of this is habitat decline versus the kind of trafficking and commercial poaching that some of those images that we 
 
 showed depict?
 
GALSTER: Yes, habitat destruction was historically the biggest threat to tigers. But, really, right now, the number one threat to tigers is the 
 
 commercial poaching for its body parts. Primarily for its bones. Traffickers are fraudulently but effectively marketing these bones to a 
 
 population in certain countries as a sort of cure all, something that can take care of musculoskeletal problems, as an aphrodisiac, other things in 
 
 between.
 <br>[18:40:00]
 
And so, we're seeing things on the black market like tiger bone pills, tiger plasters, tiger glue. This is this thing that they paste the bones 
 
 together after they poach the tiger, boil it all into a cake and then form into these like little almost like brownie looking, almost like little 
 
 quarter half kilo heroin looking blocks. And then in fact, when they smuggle it back to the syndicate headquarters, they take it out and they 
 
 shave it down into little grand bags like you would with cocaine, and the prices are rivaling illicit narcotics.
 
So, this is why we've got a lot of poaching going on right now, which is mitigating some of the gains that we've had. And this is what we're up 
 
 against.
 
CHATTERLEY: In a world of competing forces, I don't want to talk to you about why people should care and help protect tigers. But what you just 
 
 said there, I think it's very important. Who's buying this, Steven, because I think there will be a lot of people who have views on who is buying and 
 
 actually might be surprised by where some of these products are coming?
 
GALSTER: Well, that's right. I mean, you know, people might think we're talking about tigers in Asia. We're talking about illegal trade in 
 
 Southeast Asia. Actually, the number two consumer country in the world for wildlife is the United States of America.
 
CHATTERLEY: Right.
 
GALSTER: And right behind them is the E.U. as a block. But, yes, we need to worry about tigers, not just if you're an animal person, but tigers are 
 
 really important. Tigers are super important for the environment and for people. They're an apex predator or an umbrella species is like -- we like 
 
 to say.
 
So, you know, if they're -- the ecosystem that they're in, they help regulate the whole thing, including the animal populations there, and that 
 
 also means that that ecosystem, which is a watershed, is more beneficial to the local farmer. So, actually, tigers, healthy tiger landscapes are 
 
 helpful to people.
 
But we also need to be concerned because this tiger trade is fueling organized crime and corruption. And these criminal syndicates, who we've 
 
 investigated, they're nasty. They are not just trafficking in tigers, they're trafficking in, you know, elephant ivory, rhino horn, bear 
 
 gallbladder, penguin scales, bones of lions and leopards, you name it.
 
And they're also -- some of them that we've investigated, they're trafficking people and drugs. And so, these are the people that are 
 
 benefiting, that are getting stronger, that are imperiling these tigers. Other wildlife whole ecosystems, and, you know, they're a threat to all of 
 
 us.
 
So, we need to stand up on Tiger Day, I think, and, you know, stand behind the Tiger and stand up against these gangsters that are destroying our 
 
 planet and say enough.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes. And it's also, to your point, not just about the tigers, it's about the ecosystem that they live and protect in many respects. And 
 
 also, what happens higher up the food chain as well, which is vitally important.
 
Your training rangers, anti-poaching forces. I'm sure that's a not only a dangerous job, but not a particularly well-paid job either. What about 
 
 local governments or the central government in this case and prosecutions accountability? Because there has to be some consequence for this in order 
 
 for there to be some reliable deterrent effect. Does that exist, Steven? And I appreciate we're talking different countries.
 
GALSTER: Yes, it's hard to generalize, but we can actually say it is getting better. Thailand, for example, where you cited before, there was a 
 
 ranger who caught one of the richest men in Thailand in the forest poaching a panther. And normally, in the past, nobody would have dared arrest a 
 
 person like that. He did. That tycoon ended up in jail.
 
So, times are changing. People are taking wildlife crime a little more seriously than before. And we're stoked about that.
 
CHATTERLEY: Steven, how can people help if they're watching this and they want to provide greater support? And I think the first thing I would say 
 
 is, and I'm clearly not a trained doctor, but the consumers of these products have to think again, surely, and we're talking about animal pelts 
 
 as well, I'm sure, when we're talking about the E.U. and the United States.
 
GALSTER: Sure. Well, the first thing is to think about the front line, the rangers. You know, organizations like ours and other NGOs are training and 
 
 equipping these rangers, because without them, you can kiss the tiger goodbye. So, remember the rangers.
 
Secondly, you know, help us connect these cops. There are good cops in these countries. We are bringing them together from the source transit and 
 
 consumer countries so they can share information and bust these gangsters and take their money. And we're having some success doing that, but we've 
 
 got to bring them together.
 
Thirdly, actually, companies need to look at their footprint, their production lines, their supply chains. Some of them may inadvertently be 
 
 having a negative impact on these delicate natural ecosystems.
 <br>[18:45:00]
 
There's one company out in Asia I wish others would follow suit with. It's called B. Grimm. They're an energy conglomerate. They've done their due 
 
 diligence. They continue to do that. And they -- you know, the chairman goes around and, you know, talks about tigers when he's meeting, you know, 
 
 heads of state and others, and they're financing tiger protection. You know, we need more of that.
 
And finally, yes, we need people to stop buying tigers anywhere in the world. There's more tigers in captivity commercially in the United States 
 
 than there are in the wild in the whole world. So, this is not just an Asian thing. But I would, you know, go beyond that so that we're not just 
 
 talking about, you know, bears next year or elephants the following year. I think, actually, we just need to end the commercial trade in wild animals.
 
There is a tiny percentage of people who are actually benefiting from it. It's not poor people putting meat on their table. I'm not talking about 
 
 subsistence hunting or deer hunting or anything like that, that's not commercial trade in wild animals. I'm talking about this industrial style. 
 
 You know, huge $200 plus billion a year trade, the legal trade, which is the biggest threat actually to wild animals because people can wander the 
 
 illegal trade through it. So, at mass, the illegal trade at mass viruses. One of the most efficient ways that we can, you know, spark a new pandemic 
 
 is through wildlife trade.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes.
 
GALSTER: So, I think, you know, we need to look at the tiger and respect that it's making a comeback and we need to do the same thing. But let's 
 
 just end commercial trade in wild animals.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes, this is a sophisticated ring that we're talking about, Steven. I have to let you go. But I did love watching that one that tried 
 
 to take a bite out of the camera there. They're far better live and in the wild than anything else.
 
GALSTER: Yes.
 
CHATTERLEY: Thank you, sir, for your work and great to chat to you. We'll keep in touch. Thank you.
 
GALSTER: Thank you.
 
CHATTERLEY: All right. Returning now to the protests in Venezuela after Nicolas Maduro was formally declared the winner of Sunday's presidential 
 
 election, an election the opposition have also claimed it won. We've been seeing demonstrators taken to the streets and police responding with all 
 
 sorts of tear gas.
 
Stefano Pozzebon is in Caracas for us. Stefano, I'm sort of waiting to see what's behind you now, but those were pictures, images just a few moments 
 
 ago -- OK. And you have a mask on too. Talk us through what you're seeing.
 
POZZEBON: Yes, we're seeing that the clashes are still going on as we're approaching sunset here in Venezuela. You can probably see at the end of 
 
 this avenue, as we came up at the top of the hour, the police is standing over there where you can see maybe -- I don't know if we can catch that, 
 
 the traffic lights into red.
 
Well, here, we are with several -- I would say, dozens of opposition protesters who are protesting those results as announced by the electoral 
 
 authorities just in the early hours of this Monday.
 
But wear your tear gas masks up because about 10 minutes ago, the police charged up to clear this area where we're standing now, and they did so 
 
 with extensive use of tear gas and rubber bullets. And so, that's why you can see we're wearing all the right precaution to do our job here in 
 
 Venezuela.
 
But you can tell that by the fact that these people are being here, going in and out of this area and standing and committing themselves to this type 
 
 of protest, that there is widespread discontent about those results, widespread discontent about Nicolas Maduro.
 
We've just spoken -- we will be speaking with some of these protesters who have been shouting slogans such as yes, we can, Maduro out, freedom, who 
 
 are telling us that they will stay into the street as long as it's necessary as they demand that Nicolas Maduro to step down or they demand 
 
 the electoral authority to release the vote counts and all the ballot papers for that election yesterday. (INAUDIBLE).
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes, and Stefano, as we were saying earlier, an element of bravery involved in this. They were threatened with up to 20 years in 
 
 prison if they're prosecuted and arrested as a result of these protests. So, we'll continue to watch it. Stay safe. Stefano, good to have you back 
 
 with us. Thank you. Stefano Pozzebon there in Caracas.
 
We'll be right back. Stay with "First Move."
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:51:38]
 
CHATTERLEY: Welcome back. The Olympic Games are in full swing in Paris. And Japan is leading the way. It claimed its sixth gold medal in a dramatic 
 
 turnaround in the men's team gymnastics final Monday. Meanwhile, Simone Biles has already made history performing one of her signature moves to 
 
 become the first female gymnast to execute the Yurchenko double pike at the Olympics.
 
We're also keeping an eye on a couple of firsts, an Indonesian gymnast making her Olympic debut despite recovering from surgery, and a teenager 
 
 becoming the first Olympic Chinese surfer. Wow. Keeping our eyes on those. Don Riddell has been following all the action and joins us now.
 
We have to talk about the tennis. I think it's an emotional day, whether you're a tennis fan or not.
 
DON RIDDELL, CNN WORLD SPORT: Yes. I mean, there's so much to talk about, right? I mean, 19 gold medals handed out on Monday, but we'd be here for 
 
 hours and hours and hours trying to talk about all of it.
 
But the tennis, absolutely so emotional for so many different reasons. The second round of the men's singles competition, and guess who ran into each 
 
 other? These -- two of the greatest rivals and two of the greatest players of all time, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic. Of course, this is being 
 
 played at Roland-Garros in Paris where Nadal has won an extraordinary 14 French Open titles. He's up against Djokovic, the winner of 24 Grand Slam 
 
 singles titles.
 
The crowd, you won't be surprised to hear, Julia, overwhelmingly supporting Nadal. But in the end, Djokovic won it fairly comfortably in straight sets. 
 
 It was the 60th time these two great titans had gone head-to-head. And we might now be wondering if it's the last time we'll ever see them play 
 
 together, against each other, because Nadal has said this will be his last season on tour. Not that he wants to talk about retirement just yet, but he 
 
 knows it's coming.
 
The fans all knew that they had been witness to something really special, even if it didn't quite go the way they wanted.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Ever since I was little, I'd watch him play every Sunday and he made the first half of my life happy. With 
 
 what Nadal means to us, to see him play for the last time on Philippe Chatrier in his temple, it is incredibly special to us, even though he 
 
 didn't win.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): The fact that he's a legend here, he was able to have the international but mostly French crowd behind him. 
 
 And that's amazing.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
RIDDELL: For so many athletes competing at the Olympics is an emotional experience. So, you can imagine what it's like to medal. And this was very, 
 
 very emotional. Ukraine's first medal at these Olympics, won by Olga Kharlan. She took bronze in the fencing sabre individual event. And of 
 
 course, when you remember what these athletes know is happening back home, how much their friends and families and everybody back in Ukraine is 
 
 suffering, such an emotional moment and a hugely significant and morale boosting win, I would say, for the Ukrainian team. Their first medal of 
 
 these Olympics.
 
You know, the games only come around once every four years. And when they do, it really puts a spotlight on some of the lesser-known events, the 
 
 niche events, like water polo. And you might've noticed that the American team has an absolutely huge cheerleader, Flavor Flav, the rapper. He was in 
 
 the band Public Enemy. He is now sponsoring the American water polo team. He's their official hype man. And he popped by to see us here at CNN in 
 
 Paris earlier on today to explain why he's got involved.
 <br>[18:55:00]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
FLAVOR FLAV, RAPPER, REALITY TV STAR, ENTREPRENEUR: These girls, man, when they're not in the water, they're home. You know, living actual working 
 
 lives. You know what I'm saying? One, two, and three jobs. And they out here busting their butts to make United States look good. You know what I'm 
 
 saying?
 
So, I said, why not help give these girls a boost? Yes, boy. You know what? I ain't going to lie, but -- 
 
COY WIRE, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR: Oh, there we go.
 
FLAV: It fits.
 
WIRE: Let's go. Let's go.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
RIDDELL: Coy Wire doesn't need any more hyping or any more excitement around him at Flavor Flav. Absolutely raising the bar there for us in Paris 
 
 earlier on today, Julia. And yes, great to see. And great to see that some of the lesser-known sports like water polo are getting a bit more exposure 
 
 as a result of people like Flavor Flav.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes, he was in the pool with the team at one point, wasn't he? I admit I had to Google him, but I sort of think he's a legend. Not an 
 
 obvious Olympic partnership there, but what an advocate for women's sports. He gets our vote. We like him.
 
Don, great to chat to you. Thank you.
 
RIDDELL: All right.
 
CHATTERLEY: OK. And that just about wraps up the show. Thank you for joining us. I'll see you tomorrow.
