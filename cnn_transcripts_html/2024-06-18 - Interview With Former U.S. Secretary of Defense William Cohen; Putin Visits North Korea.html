WOLF BLITZER, CNN HOST:  Happening now: major new immigration action. President Biden preparing to announce new executive action protecting undocumented spouses and children of U.S. citizens. We're live at the White House with a look at just how many people will be impacted. 
 
Plus: alarming alliance, Putin heading to Pyongyang. Russia's president is set to meet with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un to visit, an apparent growing alliance alarming Western leaders. 
 
Also, wildfires out West. An entire town is evacuated due to a pair of fires that are now converging. And in Los Angeles County, thousands of acres already burned by wind-fueled fires. We're live near one of the blazes. 
 
I'm Wolf Blitzer in Washington, and you're in the CNN NEWSROOM. 
 
Right now, President Biden is preparing to make a major announcement that would shield hundreds, hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants from deportation. The president will soon unveil sweeping executive action that allows some undocumented spouses of U.S. citizens to apply for permanent residency without having to leave the country. 
 
It would be the federal government's largest immigration relief program since DACA. That's the Obama era policy that protects undocumented immigrants who came to America as children from deportation and lets them work and stay in the United States. 
 
CNN's Arlette Saenz is joining us from the White House right now. 
 
Arlette, what more can you tell us about President Biden's new policy that's being announced? 
 
ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Wolf, this is a sweeping relief plan for some undocumented immigrants that could have election-year impacts, as President Biden is trying to tackle one of the country's most politically vexing issues, border security and immigration. 
 
Now, this plan would tap into an existing authority known as parole in place. And what it would essentially do is it would allow undocumented spouses of U.S. citizens and their children to remain in the country as they seek permanent residence, removing the fear of deportation. 
 
The current system requires that you leave the country in order to start this process. Now, the people who would qualify for this would be undocumented immigrants who were married, who were living in the U.S. for 10 years as of yesterday, June 17, and married to a U.S. citizen. 
 
This would allow them to work legally in the U.S. And it's estimated that it could impact about 500,000 spouses and 50,000 children of U.S. citizens. Now, this is a move that the Biden campaign is trying to argue stands in stark contrast to the policy of former President Donald Trump. 
 
They said in a statement -- quote -- "Families belong together. It's that simple. It's why President Biden's actions today are so important. And it's also a powerful, stark reminder of Donald Trump's legacy when it pertains to his family separation policy."
 
Now, Biden's move today comes just a few weeks after he had implemented or rolled out a plan that really amounts to a major crackdown on crossings at the U.S. southern border. That was a move that drew some frustration from progressives and immigration advocates. So, part of what Biden's trying to do here is ease some of those concerns. 
 
This is also something that could potentially appeal to Latino voters in key states like Arizona, Nevada, and Georgia, all important battleground states heading into November's election. 
 
BLITZER:  Arlette Saenz at the White House for us. 
 
Arlette, thank you very much. 
 
Let's discuss what's going on with Democratic Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi. He's a congressman from Illinois. 
 
Congressman, thanks, as usual, for joining us. 
 
This announcement by the White House comes, what, just about two weeks after President Biden severely restricted the asylum process over at the border with Mexico. Why do you think the president is taking this new step now? 
 
REP. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI (D-IL):  Well, I think it's just recognizing the reality of the current situation, which is that you have so many spouses of American citizens who can already apply for legal permanent residency or a green card, but they'd have to leave the country in order to do so. 
 <br>[11:05:08]
 
We actually -- my district has a lot of such cases. Thirty percent of my constituents are foreign-born. And what we find is that, when these spouses have to leave the country, sometimes, they're gone for as many as three or four years before they can come back to continue with the process. So, the families are separated. So, what we're doing here, what we're
 
 seeing with the president is, he's recognizing that it's wrong to separate these families. And then, secondly, by permitting them to work, we're expanding the economy, which makes all the sense in the world right now. 
 
BLITZER:  And to separate those families and let the mothers or the fathers who have to leave the country leave their own kids behind maybe for, as you say, three or four years, that's so heartbreaking indeed. 
 
KRISHNAMOORTHI:  Right.
 
BLITZER:  Republicans, though, as you know, Congressman, are slamming President Biden's new executive action, saying it's just going to encourage more people to come to the United States illegally. How do you respond to that? 
 
KRISHNAMOORTHI:  Well, look, we know that our immigration and border are broken. We need a legislative fix. And the president has pursued that in Congress. 
 
However, unfortunately, Donald Trump and Republicans have blocked this, saying that, essentially, if there's any legislative solution, that would somehow provide a win to the president. And so I kind of chuckle a little bit when I hear these Republicans complain, because they are voting oftentimes against the very bipartisan legislative fixes to our border and our immigration system that they rhetorically are for. 
 
So, right now, we have to do what's right and what's smart. And I think that's what the president is doing through these executive actions. 
 
BLITZER:  You heard Arlette over at the White House mention the Biden campaign statement promoting the president's new executive action. 
 
But a recent Quinnipiac University poll shows former President Trump ahead of President Biden on immigration by more than 10 points. You see it right there. Who would do a better job handling immigration? Fifty-two percent say Trump; 41 percent say Biden. 
 
Why do you think voters seem to trust Trump's policies more than Biden's?
 
KRISHNAMOORTHI:  I don't know for sure, but I suspect that they want to see more action with regard to the border. 
 
I'm glad that the president took the steps he did last week -- or two weeks ago, I should say, to reduce the illegal asylum seeking between ports of entry that's happening right now. I think that's a good step in the right direction. At the end of the day, Wolf, as you know, we need a legislative fix. 
 
And that's something that I'm glad that people like James Lankford, a Republican in the Senate, put forward. However, that measure got blocked repeatedly by Republicans and Donald Trump. So I think now the president's trying to show some action, and he's taking the right steps, in my opinion. 
 
BLITZER:  You know, Congressman, I want you to look at this; 62 percent of Americans in this poll say they support deporting all undocumented immigrants living in the United States. 
 
Here's the question. Are Democrats out of touch with the American people on this very, very sensitive issue? 
 
KRISHNAMOORTHI:  I don't think so. I think that, when it comes down to it, a lot of these folks are in our communities. They're rooted in our communities. They haven't -- they don't have a criminal record. They oftentimes contributed greatly to our country. 
 
And when folks are pressed, would you deport this person or that person from your community, they usually say no. So I think we have to look at the humanity of the situation and what's the smart thing to do. And, right now, I think the president's doing both with regard to the spouses of American citizens who are eligible anyway to go forward with a green card process. 
 
And now he's expediting that. 
 
BLITZER:  And he's offering them a potential pathway to U.S. citizenship as well. And if you take a look at a lot of these immigrants, not all, but almost all of them, they are hardworking people who are contributing greatly to their communities and to the country at large. 
 
Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois, as usual, thank you so much for joining us. 
 
KRISHNAMOORTHI:  Thank you, Wolf. 
 
BLITZER:  Also today, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, is expected to arrive in North Korea just ahead of his meeting with the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un. 
 
It marks his first visit to the country in more than two decades and signifies a potentially deepening anti-West alliance that is raising serious concerns here in Washington. 
 
CNN senior international correspondent Will Ripley has a closer look at what's at stake. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The North Korean capital, Pyongyang, preparing a supersized socialist welcome for Russian President Vladimir Putin, a pariah in the free world, in Kim Jong-un's world, an invincible comrade in arms.
 <br>[11:10:11]
 
North Korean propaganda praising Putin's first Pyongyang trip in 24 years. He met Kim's father in 2000, months after becoming president. Kim Jong-un was still a teenager, Moscow-Pyongyang ties today the strongest since the Cold War, a grave and growing threat, say Seoul and Washington.
 
They accuse Kim of supplying weapons to Putin's army in Ukraine in exchange for advanced military technology, possibly boosting Kim's ballistic missile and spy satellite programs, which could make Kim's growing nuclear arsenal more accurate, experts warn.
 
For years, North Korea has been threatening to use nukes against the U.S. in the event of war. In April, Kim was quoted in state media: "Now is the time to be more thoroughly prepared for a war than ever before."
 
SCOTT SNYDER, PRESIDENT AND CEO, KOREA ECONOMIC INSTITUTE OF AMERICA: The relationship really is built on a transactional relationship, not on mutual trust.
 
RIPLEY:  The North Korean leader's lavish armored limousine, a gift from the Russian strongman, a symbol of Kim's away from failed U.S. diplomacy with former President Donald Trump, which experts say left Kim furious and humiliated.
 
SNYDER:  So far, it seems like the door is shut. And I would say that, for North Korea and for Kim Jong-un, the real message is, beware betrayal.
 
RIPLEY:  Leaving President Joe Biden with very little leverage to pursue the fading prospect of North Korean denuclearization.
 
Satellite images of Pyongyang in recent days show possible preparations for a massive celebration, the Kremlin unfazed by Western warnings, claiming it has every right to create closer kinship with neighbors.
 
The stakes are high, the symbolism powerful. Observers say Putin and Kim's dangerous alliance is bigger than politics, a defiant message from two leaders determined to take down the U.S. 
 
(on camera):  And that is why the White House is saying it is deeply troubled by this deepening relationship between Russia and North Korea, the Kremlin saying that Kim and Putin are expected to sign a new strategic partnership agreement, replacing previous documents signed in 1961, 2000, 2001.
 
And the power dynamic between the two leaders has changed so much over the last 24 years since Putin visited Pyongyang. Kim is no longer an accessory or an afterthought, like his father or his grandfather were to the Russian leaders. He is vital to Putin's strategic mission in Ukraine, and he knows it.
 
Will Ripley, CNN, Taipei.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
BLITZER:  And thanks to Will Ripley in Taipei for that report.
 
For more on all of this, CNN's chief global affairs correspondent, Matthew Chance, is joining us right now from Moscow.
 
Matthew, give us a sense of how big this visit is.
 
MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, I think it's pretty big, from the perspective of both the Russians that see this as an opportunity to show that Vladimir Putin isn't isolated on the international stage and he has options, despite the fact that he's been -- his country has been sanctioned more than any other country, in fact, by the United States and by the West in general, and equally for the North Koreans.
 
This is -- this is them showing as well that they have options beyond that negotiation that Will was talking about with the United States and its partners. I think that the real issue, though, is the fact that it's been 24 years since Vladimir Putin paid a visit to North Korea, and there's been a very good reason for that, which is that, up until now, North Korea hasn't really been a foreign policy priority for Russia.
 
But it just shows you how crucial North Korea has become to Russia's conflict in Ukraine, as a supplier of weapons, even though the Kremlin denies taking delivery of North Korean weapons, but how crucial it's become as a partner in that fight in Ukraine.
 
I mean, Russia expends something in the region of 10,000 artillery shells every day. And its own factories simply can't keep up at this stage with that kind of consumption. So it needs to look for artillery supplies and other weapons elsewhere.
 
And North Korea is one of the few countries that not only has that ammunition, but is prepared to sell it to Moscow. And that's why it's suddenly surged in importance for Moscow -- Wolf.
 
BLITZER:  Very important, indeed.
 
As you know, Matthew, the Kremlin has described this visit -- and I'm quoting now -- as having a very eventful agenda. So what do you -- what do you think? What can we expect to see? 
 
CHANCE:  Well, I mean, as you have been hearing, look, there's going to be a massive North Korean parade in the center of Pyongyang. 
 
And the North Koreans do these things -- they don't do them by halves. They have massive concerts with thousands of people in sequence, in coordination, sort of giving these incredibly dramatic patriotic displays. And so we're going to be watching out for something like that. 
 <br>[11:15:11]
 
In terms of the agreements that are going to be signed, the Russians have talked about a number of agreements about cultural ties, economic and trade ties, also that strategic partnership treaty, which will involve a security agreement as well, though the details of that have not been made clear. 
 
But I think what's going to be more important are what agreements are struck behind closed doors that we don't ever hear about. I mean, they're not going to come out and say, yes, we're going to supply millions more rounds of ammunition for your war efforts in Ukraine, although that may indeed be what comes out of this. 
 
And, of course, the other issue is, what will North Korea get in return? There are lots of concerns being expressed in the region, in the Far Eastern region, about whether there will be a transfer of sensitive missile technology, even nuclear technology or space technology to North Korea that could make it, could make North Korea even more dangerous in that region. 
 
Russia says that it's got no intention of supplying that kind of sensitive technology to North Korea, not least because it doesn't want North Korea to be even more belligerent than it already is. But, nevertheless, North Korea holds a lot of bargaining chips right now. It has the ammunition that Moscow needs so desperately. 
 
BLITZER:  Yes, we saw those pictures of Putin hanging along the side of the road in Pyongyang welcoming him to North Korea. 
 
Matthew Chance in Moscow for us, thank you very, very much. 
 
Meanwhile, there's other important news we're following right now here in Washington. A new whistle-blower has emerged in the U.S. Senate investigation of Boeing just hours before the CEO is due to testify up on Capitol Hill. 
 
Dave Calhoun is expected to apologize for a series of very alarming safety failures in Boeing aircraft, including the terrifying blowout of an emergency door on an Alaska Airlines flight only minutes after takeoff. In April, Boeing-employees-turned-whistle-blowers testified that the company often put profits ahead of safety. 
 
And, this morning, we learned a new whistle-blower claims Boeing may have installed questionable parts on planes and then hid that from regulators. 
 
This morning on CNN, the chair of today's committee says Boeing could potentially face very serious criminal charges. Listen to this. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT):  There's mounting evidence that Boeing should be prosecuted. And I'm going to withhold judgment until we finish this hearing and the investigation. 
 
The Justice Department is now doing its own inquiry. But I do think there's near-overwhelming evidence that prosecution is important to sending a message, a deterrent message, and also insisting on accountability. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BLITZER:  Boeing has issued a statement on this new whistle-blower and his claims.
 
And I'm quoting now from the Boeing statement: "We received this document late Monday evening and are reviewing the claims. We continuously encourage employees to report all concerns, as our priority is to ensure the safety of our airplanes and the flying public" -- end quote. 
 
Just ahead:  While Russia's Vladimir Putin is in North Korea, the leader of NATO is here in Washington meeting with Secretary of State Antony Blinken. They're both set to address reporters in just minutes. 
 
Plus, as millions across the country are facing extreme heat, evacuations are under way as wildfires scorch New Mexico and California right now. We're near the scene of one of the dangerous blazes.
 
That's just ahead. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:23:23]
 
BLITZER:  Right now, the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, is holding a news conference here in Washington with the NATO secretary- general, Jens Stoltenberg.
 
CNN's Kylie Atwood is joining me now from the State Department. 
 
Kylie, the two officials are meeting as a slew of geopolitical concerns are raging right now. We're talking about the Israel-Hamas war, Russia's war against Ukraine, and Vladimir Putin's summit with Kim Jong-un in North Korea right now. Tell us more. What more can we expect out of this meeting between Jens Stoltenberg and the secretary of state? 
 
KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  Wolf, indeed, a lot of live issues on the foreign policy agenda for the two to discuss today. 
 
It'll be interesting to see if they say anything about President Putin visiting North Korea, as you said today, and if they're solidifying that alliance, what more steps they expect to come between North Korea and Russia, as we have seen that develop as the Ukraine war has gone on. 
 
And then, significantly next month, here in Washington, there's going to be the 75th anniversary of NATO. The NATO summit is going to be here, leaders from all around the world. So the secretary-general and the secretary of state today will obviously be discussing what more that alliance can do for Ukraine. 
 
We have seen it defend Ukraine throughout the course of this war, but what more can they actually do and announce for Ukraine at that massive event that takes place here in Washington next month? And then, as you said, we have the Israel-Hamas war that continues to go on. Significantly, there has been tension over the Biden administration
 
 sending over continued weapons to Israel throughout this war. And we learned this morning that the top Democrats on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee have lifted their hold on F-15 jets, that $18 billion worth of sale to Israel. 
 <br>[11:25:13] 
 
So those will go ahead. That is a significant development. However, those are not jets that are going to get there imminently. It'll take years for them to develop, years for them to get over there. We will have to see what the secretary of state says about the holds that the Biden administration does have on some arms sales to Israel and if that is going to change at all over the course of the next few months here -- Wolf. 
 
BLITZER:  Yes, we're holding off on delivering Israel some of those 2,000-pound bombs, but not the F-15, the fighter jets and other equipment. 
 
Kylie Atwood at the State Department, thanks for that report. 
 
Joining me now, William Cohen. He's the former defense secretary of the United States. He served under President Bill Clinton. 
 
Mr. Secretary, thanks so much for joining us. 
 
Last week, as you know, NATO approved a new plan that gives the NATO alliance more control over military aid going into Ukraine, a move officials say is due in part to the former -- to the possibility that former President Trump could potentially win the U.S. presidential election and curtail a lot of that aid. 
 
What do you make of all of this? 
 
WILLIAM COHEN, FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:  Well, I think the European allies are justifiably worried. 
 
You talked earlier about President Putin being in North Korea. I think it's time for the American people, the American Congress to wake up and smell the gunpowder. Putin is now doing business, certainly a strategic relationship with China. He now has a transactional relationship with North Korea. 
 
But step back and look. He's in Syria. He's also in the Middle East in terms of doing business with Iran, with Hezbollah, with the Houthis. They're in the African continent and Latin America. We have to put our emphasis on having allies. 
 
NATO is the most successful military political alliance in the history of the world. And you have a former president who wants to undo it. We have to shore up these alliances, both in Europe and also in Asia. And you now have a former president who wants to undermine that. 
 
So that's the significance of what's taking place with Putin and Kim Jong-un. 
 
BLITZER:  On another sensitive issue, Mr. Secretary, you heard Kylie report that CNN has learned that two key Democrats in Congress have now approved an $18 billion sale of additional F-15 fighter jets to Israel. 
 
This news comes as President Biden has ramped up pressure on Israel to try to reach some sort of cease-fire in Gaza. Is this sale of F-15s to Israel the right move? 
 
COHEN:  Well, I think our relationship with Israel is strong, and the fact that President Biden has been pushing this under the circumstances where he's also encouraging Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu to halt the war that's going on right now -- you have a daily allowance of food to go to the people who are suffering. 
 
The Israelis have to listen to President Biden, to the American people. We don't want to see tens of thousands of innocent Palestinian civilians starving to death. This will be a mark on the conscience and the reputation of the Israelis that they will not be able to erase if they allow tens of thousands of people to starve to death. 
 
That is simply not what the Israelis represent to us and to the rest of the world. So I think President Biden is trying to do two things, make sure Israeli security is strong, but also that they listen to the United States in terms of making sure innocent people do not die by the thousands at the hands of Israelis with weapons of the United States. 
 
BLITZER:  Let's get back to the issue of Putin right now, while I have you, Mr. Secretary. 
 
He's -- Putin is warning the West -- and I'm quoting him now -- that they are now at a point of no return, saying efforts to defeat Russia could lead to tragedy, and he cites Russia's nuclear weapons arsenal. 
 
Here's how the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee responded. Listen to this. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. JIM HIMES (D-CT):  Look, he's got nuclear weapons. That changes everything. North Korea has nuclear weapons, so we don't make too much fun of these people. 
 
But the idea that Vladimir Putin is going to attack the United States when he can't even really keep 15 percent of Ukraine is just ludicrous. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BLITZER:  So what do you think? He says it's ludicrous. This is Congressman Jim Himes. 
 
He says Putin is -- but he believes that Putin is weaker than he seems. Do you agree with the congressman? COHEN:  Well, I think you -- if you look at economically, the Russians
 
 certainly are not performing well. If you look at North Korea, certainly not performing well. So, economically and socially, diplomatically, they're not performing well. 
 
But any country that has nuclear weapons poses a threat to humanity. As John F. Kennedy once said, we have in -- we hold in our hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty or all forms of human life.</pre>
