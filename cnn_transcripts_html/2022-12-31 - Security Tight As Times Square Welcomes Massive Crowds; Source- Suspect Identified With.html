PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN HOST (on camera): Hello, and thanks for joining me. It is the last day of 2022. I'm Phil Mattingly, in for Fredricka Whitfield.
 
And we begin this hour watching several major stories unfolding.
 
Catholics all around the world mourning the death of the Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI.
 
The former pontiff, passing away today at the age of 95. He was the first pope to resign his post in nearly 600 years, stunning, the Catholic faithful when he stepped down in 2013.
 <br>[12:00:05]
 
His death coming just days after the Vatican announced his health had been deteriorating. What's more on that in a moment.

HUGH DOWNS, FORMER ANCHOR, ABC NEWS: Good evening. I'm Hugh downs.
 
BARBARA WALTERS, FORMER CO-HOST, THE VIEW, ABC: And I'm Barbara Walters, and this is 2020.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MATTINGLY: Tears also being shed today for a pioneering T.V. journalist, Barbara Walters. The legendary interviewer has died at the age of 93. She became the first female anchor of an evening news program in 1976, and her journalism career spanned more than five decades. A spokesman says Walters passed away peacefully in her home, surrounded by family. But, there is also joy and celebrations, of course, around the world as countries are starting to ring in the New Year.
 
We're counting down until 2023. But it's worth noting, the biggest bash, New York City always, of course, New York City, come on. It's happening in New York City. CNNs Gloria Pazmino is in New York City, is in Times Square. Has been watching people walk in to get ready for tonight. 13, 14, 15 hours early.
 
Gloria, tell me everything you're seeing right now and why these people have this level of enthusiasm?
 
GLORIA PAZMINO, CNN NEWSOURCE NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Phil, there is nothing like New York City on New Year's Eve. And there is no place like Times Square.
 
And I know it sounds like a really hard sell. But these folks who are here, they are committed. I mean, look at just -- look at them. They are sitting down, taking it easy. I even spotted a couple of people who are napping. They have several hours to go until the party starts.
 
But as you can tell, people have been lining up, they have been getting in. They have been screened for security because the NYPD is out in force.
 
This is going to be a major event. And they do this every year. But this year is a little bit different. Because in the last two celebrations, there were several COVID restrictions.
 
All of those restrictions have been lifted now. So, they are expecting many 1000s or more people this year. And Phil, I know, you know, why would you want to stand around for several hours waiting for at midnight? Well, there's no place like this on Earth.
 
We spoke with the organizer of this event, the Time Square Alliance, talking about why this event is so iconic.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TOM HARRIS, PRESIDENT, TIMES SQUARE ALLIANCE: Time Squares is symbol of New York City and New York -- New York to America and to the world.
 
And tonight, for one minute in time, the whole world is -- over a billion people in the world watch that iconic world descend at the moment of midnight, as we ring in 2023.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
PAZMINO: So, if you are looking at this and saying to yourself, you know what I'm going to go out there, I'm going to join the masses in Times Square, just keep in mind, it might rain, and you cannot bring an umbrella.
 
So, come prepared, bring a poncho, wear your waterproof gear, if you have any.
 
Do not bring a large backpack, do not bring a chair, do not bring any alcohol, they will not let you in.
 
All you will have here is the cheer, the joy, and the energy of people to keep you going throughout the night. One last important bit of information. There are no bathrooms. So, if you're coming, be prepared, you will not have access to a bathroom. But 1000s and 1000s and 1000s of people are prepared for that very long night.
 
Like I said, Phil, when the clock strikes midnight, a ton, a literal ton of confetti will come down. The ball will come down. That beautiful 11,000 pound crystal ball marking the end of 2022, and ushering in the New Year 2023 a fresh slate for everyone in the new year. Phil?
 
MATTINGLY: Yes, the fact that people are already there behind you with all of those potential inconveniences you've listed. That's the kind of energy that I think we need to take and it's going to, I back that. Like I am for that into 2023, I want to draft off that.
 
Gloria Pazmino, it's going to be a big, big day and night. Thanks so much. 
 
All right. And look. Honestly, I don't even have to say this at this point. But you have to stay with CNN tonight. Anderson Cooper, Andy Cohen. It's hilarious. It's funny. It's definitely going to be viral. It's from Times Square where Gloria just was. "NEW YEAR'S EVE LIVE" starts at 8:00 Eastern right here on CNN. We'll be watching, of course.
 
Now, we're also following an important new development in the arrest of a suspect in the killing of four University of Idaho students. The suspect's attorney says his client intends to waive extradition. And Bryan Kohberger was arrested in Pennsylvania and has been charged with four counts of first degree murder in the stabbing deaths.
 
CNN's Camila Bernal is following those developments for us. And Camila, what does this actually mean for the case?
 
CAMILA BERNAL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Well, Phil, the attorney is saying that if he waives this extradition hearing, what happens is that his transfer to Idaho may be quicker.
 <br>[12:05:02]
 
And here is the thing. This is key. It is so important for him to be physically present in Idaho. And that's because as soon as he is present and physically there, the arrest affidavit will be made public.
 
And that might be the key into a lot of the questions that we still have about this case. Authorities, not revealing a lot, not filling in the blanks yesterday despite announcing this arrest, and that's because he needs to be in Idaho.
 
So, the other important thing here is that Authorities are expecting to continue to build this case. They continue to need more evidence.
 
We know from sources here at CNN, that they have linked this man, thanks to DNA, and thanks to that white Hyundai Elantra that they had been looking for, for days now.
 
But more is needed for that successful prosecution. Here is the chief of police in Moscow, James Fry.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JAMES FRY, CHIEF, MOSCOW POLICE DEPARTMENT: What we still ask is for people to continually send us things in the tip line. We are still looking for more information. We're still trying to build that picture, just like we have stated all along. We're putting all the pieces together and that will help.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BERNAL: Now, we are also putting some of the pieces together. We've learned a lot more about his education. We know that he graduated in May, with a master's in criminal justice from DeSales University in Pennsylvania.
 
He began his PhD this semester, finishing that first PhD semester in criminal justice in Washington State University just this month.
 
So, clearly he was an expert in criminal justice. He was studying. He was interested in all of this. And I do want to point out that his attorney continues to remind the public that he is innocent until proven guilty.
 
I want to read part of the statement from his attorney, where he says, "Mr. Kohberger is eager to be exonerated of these charges and looks forward to resolving these matters as promptly as possible."
 
Now, it's also important to point out that police say they do not have the murder weapon, they do not have the knife. They have yet to give us a motive.
 
Hopefully, we get a motive or at least some clarity into why he did this, or how he is connected to the victims if that affidavit is made public.
 
But in the meantime, you know, those families are still mourning the loss of four students. And it has not been easy over the last seven weeks for the families and for the entire community, Phil.
 
MATTINGLY: Yes. No, no question about that. Camila Bernal, thanks so much for your reporting.
 
BERNAL: Thank you.
 
MATTINGLY: Now, in Ukraine, at least one person has been killed and 20 others are injured in a New Year's Eve attack in the capital city of Kyiv. That's according to the city's mayor.
 
Now, he also said several school buildings in the capital suffered damage in the attacks. Ukraine's prime minister accused Russia of trying to leave the country in the dark for the New Year.
 
CNN's Ben Wedeman was on a rooftop when some of those strikes hit. Have a look.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): OK, there have been several loud explosions. We see three points of impact. The air defenses are working. We've also seeking puffs of smoke in the air where they've gone. This is an ongoing barrage.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MATTINGLY: And CNN's Ben Wedeman joins me now. Ben, is there any sense that there's a strategy here in terms of these Russian strikes? Or what's the process here that they're actually trying to pursue?
 
WEDEMAN: Well, the Ukrainian prime minister, in fact, said that on this day, the Russian missiles seem to be targeting not to the energy infrastructure that they've been doing now since late September, but rather residential areas.
 
It appears that on this day, New Year's Eve, that the target, according to the prime minister is civilians. Merely civilians for the purpose of terrorizing them.
 
And, of course, I've -- we've been watching as CNN is covering New Year's celebrations around the world, here in Kyiv, it is quiet and the streets are empty.
 
Some of the people spent part of their day huddling in the metro stations, basements and bomb shelters.
 
Now, as far as what happened today, according to the Ukrainian army, 20 missiles were fired from the Black Sea from Russia and from Russia itself.
 
12 of them were intercepted. But as you saw in that video you just ran, many of them were directed at Central Kyiv, where there are hotels and businesses and shops.
 
And, in fact, several -- two hotels were hit. Some residential apartment buildings were hit. Shops were damaged. One person, according to the mayor of Kyiv was killed, 16 others were injured.
 <br>[12:10:01]
 
And it wasn't just Kyiv that was hit. Several other Ukrainian cities were hit as well with more than a dozen casualties in that case.
 
In those cases, in elsewhere, I mean, in Kyiv, itself, 30 percent of the electricity has been turned off as an emergency measure. So, this is not going to be -- there aren't going to be any celebrations for New Year's Eve here in Ukraine.
 
MATTINGLY: Yes, it's an almost visceral contrast from what we're seeing elsewhere in the world. Ben Wedeman in Kyiv, thanks so much. Stay safe.
 
We're mourning two major losses today. Barbara Walters died at the age of 93. How she broke the glass ceiling for so many? Coming up ahead. And Pope Emeritus Benedict has passed away at the age of 95. We're live in Rome next with the funeral plans that are now underway.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
MATTINGLY: A major story we're following today, the death of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI. The world paying tribute to the former pontiff, including President Joe Biden at the White House, releasing this statement just moments ago.
 
"Jill and I joined Catholics around the world, and so many others, in mourning the passing of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI. I had the privilege of spending time with Pope Benedict at the Vatican in 2011. And I -- and will always remember his generosity and welcome as well as our meaningful conversation. He will be remembered as a renowned theologian, with a lifetime of devotion to the church, guided by his principles and faith."
 
I want to bring in CNN Vatican correspondent Delia Gallagher who is live at St. Peter's Square and CNN senior Vatican analyst John Allen, who joins us live from Rome.
 
Delia, first to you, what can you tell us about the plans for Pope Benedict's funeral over the course of the next couple days?
 
DELIA GALLAGHER, CNN VATICAN CORRESPONDENT: Well, let me tell you, Phil, what's happening just right now behind me, first of all, because we have Pope Francis in the square here. He is in a wheelchair, I hope you can see those pictures.
 <br>[12:14:56]
 
He is taking a visit here to look at the nativity scene. He is just finished with the Vespers in St. Peter's Basilica in which he talked about the kindness of Pope Benedict, his nobility of spirit and the sacrifices which he made, just finished with the vespers in St. Peter's Basilica in which he talked about the kindness of Pope Benedict, his nobility of spirit, and the sacrifices which he made for the Catholic Church.
 
So, this is a nice moment for the people that have come down to the square to get to see Pope Francis.
 
As far as funeral arrangements, starting on Monday, Pope Benedict will be lying in state inside St. Peter's Basilica. The funeral will be on Thursday 9:30 in the morning, local time.
 
We also know that he has requested and he will be buried in the crypt below St. Peter's where there are other Pope's bury, John Paul the second spent many years there before they moved him up inside the Basilica.
 
So, that was his request and that is where he will be buried and, of course, people can go and visit the crypt underneath St. Peter's Basilica when they come to Rome. Phil? MATTINGLY: You know, John, Delia and I were talking about this last hour, kind of the legacy or the life leading up to the papacy for Pope Benedict.
 
He was born Joseph Ratzinger. He had a long life before he reached that level in the faith. He grew up in Germany, he witnessed the Nazis rise to power, lives through the Second World War.
 
What can you tell us about his early life that kind of led him to this point?
 
JOHN ALLEN, CNN SENIOR VATICAN ANALYST (on camera): Well, I tell you, you're absolutely right. I mean, there is a sense in which Joseph Ratzinger that's the given name of Pope Benedict the XVI.
 
In his own biography, almost summed-up most of the drama of 20th century Catholic history.
 
Born in 1927, in Germany, which means he grew up in the shadow of the rise of the Nazi movement. His family was strongly anti-Nazi. And he did everything he could to try to distance himself from the Nazi movement.
 
He was towards the enforcedly enrolled in the Hitler Youth and then drafted into the Wehrmacht, the German Army briefly, actually ended the war very briefly as an American prisoner of war.
 
But through it all, what was fundamental about Joseph Ratzinger was his strong sense of calling to the Catholic priesthood.
 
And as soon as he could, he returned to his seminary studies, was ordained in the early 50s and quickly became a rising star in the firmament of Catholic theology. I mean, he was basically an academic.
 
He was a key contributor to the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s, kind of the signal event of 20th century Catholic history. And that, of course, is why, you know, a couple of decades later, Pope John Paul, the second brought him to Rome to be essentially his right hand man and the intellectual architect of his papacy.
 
MATTINGLY: And Delia, can you give a sense how were gathers reacting right now? Obviously, what an extraordinary moment to have gone to visit the Vatican, and all of the sudden, Pope Francis is out in front of you.
 
But what's the sense from people you're talking to they're about kind of the significance of the moment?
 
GALLAGHER: Well, look, Phil, I think this is amazing, because it's really a poignant moment, you have the reigning pope, shall we say, Pope Francis, who is mourning his predecessor, and in the public imagination, I think both of these men were opposites. And of course, there were many differences between them.
 
But one thing that united them was that they were both pope, and they had a close relationship, because there we had never been a pope who had an emeritus behind him. So, they were able to visit.
 
And I think when Pope Francis tonight was talking about the kindness of Pope Benedict, I think he really meant that because, really, for Pope Francis, Pope Benedict was one of the -- I think, probably the only person right? It's a bit like presidents that you could go to, that could understand the pressures of the job.
 
Certainly, for people here for Catholics, in particular, can imagine -- a quite -- a moving, and once in a lifetime event for them to be able to be here on New Year's Eve, with Pope Francis, which is always exciting for people to meet Pope Francis.
 
But also with this sense of the loss of Pope Benedict. And it kind of brings together the entire history of the Catholic Church, at least for the last few decades. Phil?
 
MATTINGLY: Yes. No, no question about it.
 
John, do you mention this? I read the statement from President Biden, obviously, the highest ranking political Catholic, at this point in time in the U.S.
 
Pope Benedict met two sitting U.S. presidents and a future American president and President Biden, during his time as leader of the Catholic Church.
 
What can you tell us about his relationship with presidents? But also, I think, more broadly, Biden, who is very devout in his Catholic faith, although he diverges, I think, in several ways with perhaps where Pope Benedict would be including some of the teachings of the Church.
 
How -- what's your sense of those relationships?
 
ALLEN: Well, I mean, first of all, the Vatican has plenty of experience, centuries of it actually, in dealing with heads of state and heads of government who purport to be Catholic, but differ with the church in some important respects. So, I don't think that was a shock to Benedict system.
 <br>[12:20:04]
 
I think one of the things that is often misunderstood though, and Delia is right that in the popular imagination, Francis and Benedict are often pitted against one another with Francis profiling as the liberal and Benedict to the conservative. Right?
 
And an intra-Catholic terms, I suppose there is some merit to that. But neither Benedict nor Francis actually fits very comfortably in the left V right dynamics of American politics.
 
I mean, you know, when it comes to life issues matters, such as abortion and gay rights and so on, then, both Francis and Benedict would seem conservative by American standards.
 
When it comes to social justice issues, the poor, immigration, the environment, the death penalty, a war in peace, both Francis and Benedict would seem quite liberal by American standards.
 
And so, in that sense, I think Francis, or rather -- Benedict, rather, had the same kind of courteous, but uneven relationship with American presidents that every pope has had and that, for that matter, Pope Francis has.
 
MATTINGLY: Yes. Fascinating life, extraordinary life. Guys, thanks so much for sharing your expertise. This is a conversation that could continue for hours. I really appreciate it.
 
And President Biden is ending 2022 In St. Croix, where he's gathering with his family about his future in Washington. What we're learning about those 2024 ambitions coming up next.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What's your priorities for -- 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
MATTINGLY: President Biden is celebrating this New Year's Eve at the U.S. Virgin Islands.
 
MATTINGLY (voice over): The rest much needed after a busy year legislatively, but also as he prepares to deal with the new Congress, where Republicans will be in control of the house for the first time in four years.
 <br>[12:25:08]
 
Biden must also weigh, whether or not to run for reelection in 2024. It's a decision that will not come lightly for the 80-year-old president.
 
CNN's Arlette Saenz is in St. Croix. That backdrop is infuriating, Arlette. I'm sorry, like it just is as much as I love you.
 
You're with the president, big decisions -- big decisions for the president and his family. What's your sense of things right now as you talk to a senior team?
 
ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Well, Phil, I told them to pick a backdrop that's going to make you specifically jealous. So, I'm glad that, that worked out.
 
But you know, for Joe Biden, for President Biden, he actually rang in the New Year here in 2019, in St. Croix, as they were deciding about his last presidential run.
 
And now they are right back here on the very same island as that 2024 decision is looming. And advisors have basically said, take the president at his word when he says he intends to run.
 
They are putting those plans in place, as if a campaign will be launched at some point in the coming months. But the president has said that he has taken these holidays, to try to talk to his family about that decision.
 
And he was asked about that last night as he was out to dinner here in St. Croix. And he answered in a pretty typical Biden fashion.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mr. President, you discussed 2024.
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Happy New Year.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did you talk to your family about running for reelection, sir?
 
BIDEN: Is there an election coming up?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
 
BIDEN: I didn't know that.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SAENZ: So, the president is not just staring down that 2024 decision heading into the New Year. But he is also going to return to Washington to a completely reshaped political reality.
 
As House Republicans are preparing to take over one chamber of Congress for the first time in his presidency. One thing in the coming weeks that they are watching very closely is that race for House Speaker, and whether Kevin McCarthy will be the leader of the Republican Party there.
 
And Biden has said that he hopes that there are areas where they can find some bipartisan cooperation, but they're also fully cognizant of some of the resistance that's going to come, including those investigations that Republicans have planned on launching.
 
MATTINGLY: Arlette Saenz, great reporter. Great teammate. Great person. Thanks, buddy. See you in a bit.
 
For more, let's bring in CNN political analyst and White House reporter for the Associated Press Seung Min Kim. And CNN political analyst and White House correspondent for PBS NewsHour Laura Barron- Lopez.
 
Guys, welcome. I've got four young kids. So, this is basically my New Year's party. Appreciate it. You just -- 
 
Seung Min, I want to start with where I kind of left off with Arlette, which is, at this point in the process, look, I think we all have a pretty good sense of things. But is it seemed like a certainty that the president is going to run for reelection?
 
SEUNG MIN KIM, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, with President Biden, there is always a caveat when you talk about his future plans. Or when he asked him about his future plans, and he says, you know -- it's also up to fate.
 
So, I -- you know, but at the same time, I think that's what -- how we're interpreting it is that, you know, all barring some major turn of events, a personal reason, a family reason, I think we are all expecting him to go ahead with a 2024 run.
 
He has said that his intention for a while. When asked why he wouldn't just come out and say it out right, his advisors have pointed to certain FEC rules that would be triggered if he indeed declares a run for the presidency.
 
But right now, all -- it seems to be all systems are go for a Biden 2024 run. We have been told to look at that first part of 2023 for an official launch advisors and allies have regularly pointed us to that April, I believe, April 2011 launch for then-President Barack Obama when he announced his reelection bid.
 
So, that's kind of a timeline that we're looking at right now, the first part of 2023. Obviously, anything could change. But I think it seems like President Biden really is preparing for a second -- or run at a second term at this moment.
 
MATTINGLY: Laura, and what about two kind of theories of the case of you that have been presented to me, and that is, you know, with Republicans in control of the House, it will be a much more challenging year, no question about it.
 
In terms of investigations, this is not going to be a ton of bipartisan legislation. But it'll also give the White House inability to kind of triangulate a little bit, kind of put things on them, have an adversarial relationship that may help them politically.
 
Do you think that the Republican majority in the House will end up helping politically the president or will it ended up making any reelection campaign that much more difficult?
 
LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, just like you, Phil, the folks that I'm talking to at the White House are saying that. And they are saying that essentially, when you look at the past few Democratic presidents who won their reelection, they had -- they were facing a Republican majority in the House.
 
And the one that wasn't, Jimmy Carter lost -- didn't win a reelection.
 <br>[12:30:04]
 
So, they do view it as some type of, you know, potential boom for them. Although, there will be a lot of pain with those investigations.
 
And the other difference now that they have is that, yes, they maintain the Senate majority but they also have that extra seat in the Senate. So Senate Democrats can launch -- launch their own investigations now. They have subpoena power now. They have the majority on committees which they didn't have, which could help the White House in different places. You know, look, the -- the investigations are definitely going to have a lot of distraction and the White House is still taking them seriously which is why they have built out an entire team to try to address them. 
 
MATTINGLY: So (inaudible) when you talked about officials and they look at the Republican field that exists, it's Donald Trump, and those that might join. How cognizant of it are -- are they? Are they watching everybody very closely? Will that play a roll in how the president decides what he's going to do next and when? 
 
UNKNOWN: Certainly the -- the White House, the broader Democratic apparatus, the DNC is watching the whole slate of potential candidates. It's not Donald Trump who we -- not just Donald Trump who we know is the only major declared candidate in the field, but they're watching dozens upon dozens of people who could embark a run. And I think that's the big question right now, how many people join in beyond Donald Trump, because we know how -- we see how confident President Biden is about his chances against him and I think when Democrats were really down on President Biden earlier this year when his poll numbers were really low. He would and -- and there were a lot of questions about whether he should run again in 2024. 
 
President Biden himself had people around him would point to the fact that still, in a head to head with President Trump, that he would -- or former President Trump that he would -- that President Biden would be in an -- in an advantageous position. Now they obviously the people that are being closely watched include governors, Florida Governor DeSantis among them, but there are a whole slate of people who are -- Republicans who are considering a bid in -- in -- in 2024, and certainly -- and that will really effect just the dynamics of the field and how the dynamics of how the Biden and his campaign apparatus approach this in the coming months. 
 
MATTINGLY: Yes, now question. Laura in the 30 seconds we have left. What's one thing you're watching at the White House this year that maybe other people might not be? So I can steal if from you and then report it before you -- no I'm kidding, but -- but seriously, what are things that you're watching -- maybe one thing that you're watching maybe other people aren't paying attention to or should -- and should be? 
 
BARRON-LOPEZ: Well, you might be already paying attention to this as well, but essentially how effectively the president is able to sell all the bills that were passed in the first years. Because like you mentioned earlier, they may not get any other big pieces of legislations. So are they really able to convince the American public, especially as people are still dealing with inflation, still dealing with a lot of, you know, high costs. That these other pieces that they pass like prescription drug reform are helping them a lot. So whether or not he's out there traveling more, really trying to sell that. 
 
MATTINGLY: Yes. Don't get scooped on implementation but L -- B-- OK, got it in my notes. (Inaudible), Laura Barron-Lopez, my friends, best in the business. Thanks so much for taking the time. Happy New Year. 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
MATTINGLY: All right. Coming up next, the loss of a legend. Barbara Walters passes away at the age of 93. We'll look at the legacy she leaves behind. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:35:10]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
MATTINGLY: Today the world of broadcast journalism, really all journalism is mourning the death of one of it's pioneers. Barbara Walters, the legendary news anchor, reporter and talk show host died at the age of 93. Walters became the first woman to co-anchor an evening TV newscast at a time when women were rarely, if ever, seen as serious journalists in the U.S. Blazing a decades long trail as a world-renowned interviewer of the famous and the powerful, as the sharp and witty creator of the talk show "The View", she spoke with Larry King about its influence. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LARRY KING: Are you concerned that CBS is starting a show, I want to get this right, called "The Talk". It will be co-hosted by Julie Chen, Sara Gilbert, Sharon Osborne, Holly Robinson-Peete, Lee Remney and Marisa Jarret-Winicar, "The Talk". 
 
BARBARA WALTERS: Well, you know, if they have --
 
KING: Is it going on against you? 
 
WALTERS: No. It's going on, I think, in the afternoon. Look, Dick Clark did a show that was all man. It was a time when they were trying to take threat out of "Today" and -- and make it that kind of a show. I hear that there maybe something on Oprah's new network. Look, it's -- it's -- as I said, it's not the most amazing concept to put people together. You see it as a panel every Sunday, the last section of the news shows. I think what has made ours what it is, we first of all have a -- Bill Gedde's is a superb producer and the show moves and it's funny and it's (inaudible). And then we've just been very lucky with our cast, even Rosie, you know --
 
KING: That was the most troublesome time for you. 
 
WALTERS: Well it ended -- it ended in a -- in a difficult way and I have, you know, I have respect for Rosie. I think she's a big talent, but when I asked Rosie to be on the show that wasn't a mistake. I mean, she was wonderful on the show. I think the problem is if I have to think about it now is that she said she didn't want to drive the bus, she wanted to be a passenger, and she's such a big talent, she wanted to drive the bus.
 
KING: Yes. 
 
WALTERS: But, you know, we've been very courageous in a way in the people that we pick. Look at Whoopie, I mean, we took a chance on Whoopie. She had not done this kind of a show. She's been simply wonderful. The audience loves her.

MATTINGLY: Her fierce determination helped turn her into a world class journalist and in the process inspired countless others to follow her lead. I want to bring in CNN Chief International Anchor Christiane Amanpour for more. And Christiane, first, I want to get your reaction to the news itself. You -- you tweeted that she was a friend, an inspiration to you. Can you tell us more about that? 
 
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Well Phil, look, I was one of the countless others that she inspired to follow her lead and if friendship means that I benefited greatly from, you know, knowing her and meeting her, you know, at work. But also her -- her friendship was the mentoring the wise council and the advice she gave, and it might sound counterintuitive because yes, Barbara Walters was such a magnificent figure. 
 
Such a public figure, you know, a really heroic figure I -- I think in the annals of world class journalism and, of course, in the pioneering work for women which is what she did. And she was fiercely competitive right to the very, very end, I mean, look "The View", she took on and she sort of, you know, produced and developed towards the end of her career let's face it. 
 <br>[12:40:00]
 
AMANPOUR: -- world what it was like to have women who could be young and beautiful behind the screen but also get older and more experienced and wiser and still be top of their game. So Barbara Walters was really the queen of broadcast news. I don't believe her massive body of work will ever be replicated, and I think as I tweeted that she is firmly etched, her legend and her history is firmly etched on the -- on the "Mt. Rushmore" of our profession. 
 
MATTINGLY: You know, one thing I wanted to ask when I heard you were able to do this, it's almost impossible. You mentioned just the sheer scale of her career and her accomplishments. Is there a moment or a particular interview that really stood out to you as, kind of, this is who she is, this is why she's such a legend? 
 
AMANPOUR: Yes, absolutely and every time I think about why I admire her so much it's because of all the big gets that she got, but for me it was the international realm because that's, kind of, the realm I inhabit. Even before I became a journalist I was aware in 1977, that Barbara Walters did a historic coup getting the Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to sit for a joint interview with the Egyptian President Anwar Sadat. 
 
It had never happened before Anwar Sadat, that year, had become the first Arab leader to visit Israel. It was an electrifying moment that just grabbed the whole world's attention and then shortly thereafter on under President Carter's guidance. They came up with the 1979 Camp David Accord. 
 
But when I saw Barbara Walters speaking to those two leaders in a joint interview that massive exclusive, I was just mesmerized and of course she interviewed Fidel Castro in '77 or somewhere around there as well. She was the first to really take on these huge, towering global figures, men of course. Everybody knows about her massive celebrity guests, her Barbara Walter's Specials, you know, interviewing all the presidents and first ladies, way back to Richard Nixon and Pat Nixon. It's -- it's just an amazing body of work and she was the first on so many accounts and it wasn't easy for her Phil. You know, the -- the men who ran the business and who sat alongside and took precedence in the anchor chair didn't make it easy for her at all. 
 
MATTINGLY: Yes. It's -- we're -- we're playing video from earlier where her co-anchor was telling her how much time she'd taken from his quote, unquote, "time", live on air. It's like the most astounding thing I've ever seen in my life. But, I guess, it should be astounding, I'm just saying to watch it actually happen --
 
AMANPOUR: No, no, no, it is astounding. You-- you have to -- you're right and one of those co-anchors, himself is a very prominent journalist was known to have called her hiring a gimmick, when she became the first co-anchor of -- of -- of an evening news broadcast. And, of course, it wasn't a gimmick, you -- you know, she did not get there because of her looks, she got there because she was relentless in the pursuit of her profession. She was excellent and it wasn't just because she was lucky. She survived for so long and had such longevity because of the utter competence and brilliance of what she did on screen. 
 
MATTINGLY: Confidence and brilliance, two great words to define. Christiane Amanpour, thanks a lot for taking the time and sharing. I really appreciate it. 
 
AMANPOUR: Thank you Phil. 
 
MATTINGLY: All right. The January 6th Committee puts out a new batch of transcripts including testimony from Rudy Giuliani, Ginni Thomas and Jared Kushner. We'll bring you the big takeaways coming up next.

MATTINGLY: The soon to be former president of Brazil Jair Balsonaro is now in the U.S. He vacated his country just days before the inauguration of his successor President-elect Lula da Silva. CNN's Julia Vargas Jones is in Sao Paulo and -- and Julia, this is not precedent in any way. Why such an abrupt exit? 
 
JULIA VARGAS JONES, CNN FIELD REPORTER: Well Phil, he's taking a page straight out of Donald Trump's playbook, intentional or not. We've seen that happen before. Right? He went to Florida of all places, but this is -- this shows what he's doing is choosing to not be present at a very important moment of democracy. 
 
The peaceful transition of power, he also never congratulated, he never conceded to his opponent, Luiz Inacio Lula Da Silva, who will be inaugurated tomorrow. He also, in fact, he went the other direction. He actually challenged election results. He said the voting machines, which Brazil has been using for decades were unreliable. He tried to sow doubt and eventually, you know, tried to challenge the election results denying the will of the people. 
 
But all of that was thrown out, it doesn't matter at this point because tomorrow Lula will be taking office in Brasilia. They're charging on. Brazil is moving to the new year with a new president. There's a huge party, massive crowds expected in Brasilia tomorrow. The only question that's remaining Phil is who, from the Balsonaro administration will be present there to pass the torch to the new president. 
 
MATTINGLY: Yes. A -- a new era, a lot of parallels, a lot of familiar-- familiar parallels to the United States, what you described. Julia Vargas Jones, good reporting as always. Thanks so much. And with just days to go before the work of the House select committee investigating the Capitol riot expires, the panel has released several batches of transcripts from key witness interviews. 
 
CNN's Katelyn Polantz has been reading all of them, every day for weeks at this point. Part of a big team of very talented people who's eyes, I think, are very tired. Katelyn, this latest batch of transcripts, a lot of big names, a lot of important players in these investigations. What -- what are we learning from it? 
 
KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN CRIME AND JUSTICE REPORTER: Phil, I -- I admit I'm not through all of these, because we got 40 transcripts yesterday alone. That's thousands of pages of interviews that the House has done, but I did want to highlight a couple of them that are really interesting, with really big names that sat for interviews with the House. There was an interview with Rudy Giuliani that the House did. 
 
They have released the transcript of that and he basically explained to the committee that at some point after the election, as he was pushing all these claims of election fraud in court and judges just were not buying his arguments. He explained to the committee that at that point in time, he and other Trump warriors then started to look at state legislatures for a way to challenge the votes and really wanted to throw out votes entirely. So that was a highlight from Giuliani. 
 
Ginni Thomas, Virginia Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, she was brought in for an interview. Her lawyer has maintained that she had minimal impact on what was happening after the election. 
 <br>[12:50:06]
 
POLANTZ: She has really distanced herself from that political movement, even though she's a well-known conservative. But she did send texts to the White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows at the time, wanting to egg him on and making sure that he was looking into claims of election fraud. Now when she sat with the committee back in September, she said she regretted all of those texts. She regrets them becoming public and she felt like she was just being emotional at that time, sharing things with people. 
 
And then finally one more little story Phil, there was a moment after the 2020 election that Donald Trump wanted to trademark the phrase "Rigged Election!", always a business man, one of his aides, Dan Scavino emailed his son-in-law Jared Kushner who also had a long history working with Trump on business issues. And they wanted to trademark that as well as "Save America PAC" but unfortunately the URL's, the website addresses were taken. They weren't able to do it. 
 
MATTINGLY: We were truly living in the dumbest time. Can I ask you before I let you go, look, there's a big shift happening on Tuesday when Republicans take the majority, obviously we noted that the committee's work basically comes to an end. What happens with, I mean, it's got to be dozens if not more transcripts still left that we haven't seen from witnesses? Are those rolling out and ruining your weekend or how -- how does this all work going forward? 
 
POLANTZ: Well they are going to continue to roll out. They did interview lots and lots of people. We have a few hundred transcripts at this point, but what we do know is going to happen is all of this material that the -- the House select committee is collecting, has put together and has a record of this unprecedented investigation. It is going to ultimately go to the National Archives but before it's public there, the government publishing office is going to make it available to the American people. There is going to be an online repository so people can go and look at these transcripts and anything else that might be coming out in the coming days. Phil. 
 
MATTINGLY: All right. Katelyn Polantz, you and the whole team have done extraordinarily and very methodical work. Not just on these transcripts but across the investigation thanks so much. Happy New Year, Bye. 
 
POLANTZ: A huge team. 
 
MATTINGLY: Yes. Indeed. Indeed. All right, still ahead, from furniture to beach boats to human remains. The historic drought impacting Lake Mead is uncovering some stunning discoveries. We speak to someone who was recently there about what they found, coming up next.

MATTINGLY: 2023 is going to be a critical year for the Colorado River if it keeps losing water. Large man-made reservoirs like Lake Mead could become a dead pool. Water levels have fallen 170 feet since the year 2000. The shoreline, now just a fraction of what it once was. That's a big concern for the Hoover Dam and the 1.3 million people it provides with hydropower. If the water level drops another 100 feet, the dam's turbines won't be able to operate. 
 
Now the falling water has drastically changed the landscape so much so that forgotten relics, once lost to the depths of the lake are not beginning to resurface. Joining us now is Associate Writer for CNN Digital Elizabeth Wolfe, she has a piece, a new piece on CNN.com chronicling the fall of Lake Mead. Elizabeth, welcome. It's a fascinating story. What were you able to find when you visited the lake? 
 
ELIZABETH WOLFE, CNN DIGITAL WRITER: Hi Phil. I mean, water levels there have receded so dramatically that even as you're trying to drive down to the beach to even get to the lake, the roads that were built to go right down to the water's edge now end abruptly, hundreds of feet from the waterline. We were able to see handful of previously sunken boats that used to be at the bottom of the lake and now they're just sitting completely dry on the shore, because the water has disappeared around them. And as you mentioned, over the past few months, there have been several other discoveries. This has been World War II -- a World War II boat and ancient volcanic rock and really shockingly several sets of human remains. 
 
MATTINGLY: It's --it's -- it's remarkable. I don't think you can actually get your head around it unless you're physically there, but just looking at the pictures are -- are crazy. How significant is the water loss for the millions of visitors who actually come to Lake Mead each year? 
 
WOLFE: Yes. I -- I mean, a really important thing to note is that not only do people visit Lake Mead but it also supplies water to about 20 million people across the west. So, anyone who gets water from that lake, this is a huge deal for them and for the visitors that I spoke to when I was there, they say that the increasingly shallow water around the shoreline has made their experience a lot less exciting. Because it's now much more difficult to access the lake, over the past two decades the park has spent about $50 million extending facilities like ramps and marinas to chase that just constantly receding waterline. 
 
MATTINGLY: Is -- is there anything, you know, as we head into 2023, is there anything that can be done in the year ahead or further out that can actually change the trajectory that has been so dramatic. That we've seen has been so acute this year especially? 
 
WOLFE: The Federal government has asked states to come up with really unprecedented, voluntary water cuts to try to preserve this extremely critical water source, but if they're not able to agree on the scale of cuts that need to be made. The Federal government has said that it may need to step in and -- and take it's own actions, which may include halting some of those downstream releases of water from Lake Mead. 
 
MATTINGLY: You know, in -- in the 20 seconds we have left here. You know, what -- is it possible that -- is it an expectation that people are just going to keep discovering new things as the water continues to decline? It's -- it's deeper, I guess, there will be more potential discoveries here. What's your sense of things? 
 
WOLFE: I think that we could definitely see more things. I mean, the reservoir is nearly a century old, so you can only imagine the mysteries that are underwater. And as far as the human remains, one former Las Vegas investigator told me that he is 100 percent confident we will find more. 
 
MATTINGLY: Wow. That's -- is a crazy story, a very important story and it was a great story from you Elizabeth Wolfe. Thanks so much, appreciate it. 
 
WOLFE: Thank you. 
 
MATTINGLY: And thank you for joining me today.
