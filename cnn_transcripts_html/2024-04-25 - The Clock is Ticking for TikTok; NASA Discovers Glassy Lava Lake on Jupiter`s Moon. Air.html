THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: What`s up, sunshine? Hope you`re having a thoroughly thankful Thursday. Gratitude is good for the attitude. I`m Coy 
 
 Wire. This is CNN 10. 
 
We kick off today`s show with some news that could be of particular interest to a lot of us. TikTok could be one step closer to being banned in 
 
 the United States.
 
President Joe Biden signing a bill sent to him by Congress that would effectively ban the social media app in America if the company that owns it 
 
 doesn`t find a new owner in the next few months. 
 
Why is this happening? Because many American leaders say TikTok is a threat to U.S. national security. The app is owned by ByteDance, a privately owned 
 
 Chinese company. But in China, the authoritarian government often treats privately owned companies like they are government owned. Even though this 
 
 bill has been signed into law, that doesn`t mean that TikTok will just disappear. The social media giant plans to sue the U.S. government to block 
 
 the law, claiming it`s unconstitutional and violates free speech.

LANCE ULANOFF, U.S. EDITOR IN CHIEF, TECHRADAR: TikTok is ready to fight. They`ll go hard and call on, you know -- they`ll say it`s a free speech 
 
 issue. But even so, say it takes a year to possibly find someone who wants to buy it. 
 
And then maybe if the White House sees that there`s some progress, they can even give them like 90-day extensions. So between the court fight and the 
 
 extensions, it`s unlikely anything`s going to happen very quickly.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WIRE: So it could be up to a year before anything happens. But if ByteDance refuses to sell TikTok or if the Chinese government steps in and says 
 
 ByteDance cannot sell TikTok, then by January of next year, you might not be able to download or update the TikTok app in the United States. That 
 
 means you could theoretically keep TikTok on your phone and keep using it, but you wouldn`t be able to update it. So over time, it would probably get 
 
 buggy and start to get glitchy and likely stop working after a while. 
 
Pro-Palestinian protests that started at New York`s Columbia University are now spreading to colleges and universities across the U.S. Fundamentally, 
 
 students are protesting how their schools invest their endowments or large pools of money that colleges and universities usually acquire through 
 
 donations. Pro-Palestinian student protesters want the schools to divest or take money away from companies that are either Israeli or involved in 
 
 Israel`s war in Gaza. CNN`s Isabel Rosales has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ISABEL ROSALES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Growing protests as students from Columbia University vowing to occupy school grounds until the 
 
 university meets their demands.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We are calling for divestment from Israel --
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: -- so that Columbia is not funding the genocide of Palestinians in Gaza.
 
ROSALES: This, as calls for the resignation of the school`s president, Minouche Shafik, continue to get louder. Shafik under fire from both inside 
 
 and outside the university and could face a censure vote from the university senate as early as tomorrow. Shafik and other university 
 
 officials are facing internal criticism that NYPD arrests and student suspensions allegedly violated tenets of academic freedom and free 
 
 expression on campus.
 
From Boston to Berkeley, there is a spotlight on how colleges are managing student outrage. Harvard Yard closed for a second day in a row. While at 
 
 MIT, a pro-Palestinian encampment stands firm in solidarity with other protesting students.
 
The growing unrest on college campuses causing concern and chaos as schools prepare for graduation in the coming weeks. Many students saying they fear 
 
 for their safety.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It`s scary, it`s terrifying. They have a sign that says "Long live the Intifada."
 
ROSALES: While others say they are --
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Vehemently -- vehemently opposing all forms of oppression.
 
ROSALES: They will not back down.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Until MIT agrees to stop building the weapons that are used in this mass killing.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We want the genocide to stop.

WIRE: Pop quiz, hot shots. 
 
All North Korean Supreme leaders are: members of the Kim family, veterans of the Korean War, democratically elected, descendants of a royal dynasty?
 
The answer is members of the Kim family. Three generations of the Kim family have ruled North Korea since 1948. Current leader Kim Jong-un took 
 
 power in 2011. 
 
North Korea isn`t known for its exports, it`s known as the hermit kingdom because basically it willfully shuts itself off for most of the world. 
 
 Things like TV shows and movies from the United States and other Western countries are banned in North Korea. But what if I told you that some of 
 
 the very shows that North Koreans aren`t legally allowed to watch were at least partially created by North Koreans? CNN`s Alex Marquardt is here to 
 
 explain.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): "Invincible" is a popular animated show streaming on Amazon Prime, with a 
 
 third season on the way.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Your power`s got to be due any day now, son.
 
MARQUARDT (voice-over): It`s based on a comic book about a superhero teen.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I wasn`t ready before.
 
MARQUARDT (voice-over): While its main character is all American, some animation in the new season may come from one of America`s biggest foes, 
 
 North Korea. Martyn Williams is a North Korea analyst at the Stimson Center.
 
MARTYN WILLIAMS, STIMSON CENTER SENIOR FELLOW: I`ll show you what we found -- 
 
MARQUARDT (voice-over): He shows us what was inside a recently discovered North Korean internet server.
 
WILLIAMS: There`s a bunch of working files in here.
 
MARQUARDT (voice-over): Files including sketches and video from North Korea, which resemble the animation from two shows produced and streamed by 
 
 American companies. Amazon`s "Invincible" and another, coming soon called, "Iyanu: Child of Wonder," set to stream on Max, which, along with CNN, is 
 
 owned by Warner Brothers Discovery. There`s no evidence that the studios knew that any proprietary work was on a North Korean server.
 
WILLIAMS: At some stage in this production process, these files appear to being worked on by the North Koreans.
 
MARQUARDT (voice-over): There`s a clip of "Iyanu" which hasn`t been released yet.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Now, let me spare your life.
 
MARQUARDT (voice-over): Williams says a lot of American production work is outsourced, particularly to China, where it could then be subcontracted to 
 
 North Koreans without the American company`s awareness.
 
WILLIAMS: It`s very common. Numerous Chinese companies have been sanctioned by the U.S. for working with North Korea, not just in animation, but in 
 
 other areas as well.
 
MARQUARDT (voice-over): A draft of one animation has Chinese instructions translated into Korean. There`s also this production sheet in English for 
 
 "Invincible."
 
(On camera): Is there any evidence that the American studios knew about this?
 
WILLIAMS: We didn`t find any evidence that they had any direct knowledge of any of this. We found the names of some animations, we found the names of 
 
 some U.S. companies, but nothing that concretely tied that back to the U.S. companies.
 
MARQUARDT (voice-over): Using North Korean labor would be a violation of U.S. sanctions. Max and the producer of "Iyanu" Lion Forge Entertainment 
 
 declined to comment. Unique Studios, which co-created the graphic novel series, did not respond. Skybound Entertainment, which produces 
 
 "Invincible," told CNN it never approved outsourcing and would investigate.
 
WILLIAMS: It`s just something that`s very difficult to kind of figure out who you are working with because once stuff starts getting outsourced, once 
 
 stuff starts moving through the system, actually finding out who the person is at the other side of the keyboard is very, very difficult.

WIRE: All right, you`ve probably heard of Lava Cake, but have you ever heard of a lava lake? It`s just one of the amazing features NASA`s Juno 
 
 spacecraft captured when it did a flyby of Io, one of Jupiter`s moons. Juno has been studying the planet and its moons since 2016. It recently flew 
 
 within 930 miles of Io`s surface, taking high-resolution photos that NASA scientists convert into these animations. 
 
It also captured this large peak that scientists call Steeple Mountain. It has been more than 20 years since a NASA mission flew this close to Io, the 
 
 most volcanically active body in our solar system.
 
Today`s story getting a 10 out of 10, a TSA canine getting a hero`s send- off. Celebrating a doggone job well done after eight years in the field, Messi, a security canine at DC`s Reagan Airport, is just plain awesome. He 
 
 was the guest of honor at a retirement party where he was showered with affection and tennis balls for his years of faithful service. Good boy. 
 
 Thanks for your service, Messi, and enjoy that retirement. 
 
All right, pawsome people, it`s time for our favorite part of the show. Shout-out to Rivermont School, Greater Petersburg in Dinwiddie, Virginia. 
 
 Rise up. 
 
And this shout-out goes to Mr. Cardenas` class at Patterson High School in Patterson, Louisiana. Go on, Lumberjacks, and keep on chopping. 
 
Happy Friday Eve. Thank you all for watching. We`ll see you right back here tomorrow. I`m Coy Wire. And we are CNN 10.
