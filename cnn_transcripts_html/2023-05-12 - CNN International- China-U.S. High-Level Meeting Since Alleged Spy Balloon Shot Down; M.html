BIANCA NOBILO, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome back to CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Bianca Nobilo. If you're just joining us, let me bring you up to date with our top stories this hour. 
 
It's been four hours since the controversial U.S. border rule known as Title 42 expired. The head of the U.S. homeland security released a statement saying the border is not open. Tens of thousands of migrants are currently camped out in border towns. A surge of arrivals is expected in the U.S., although it's been quiet overnight. 
 
Today's debt ceiling meeting between U.S. President Biden and Congressional leaders has been postponed. Lawmakers remain deadlocked in talks over raising the 31 trillion-dollar limit. 
 
China and the U.S. have signaled that they want to move past the diplomatic crisis over the alleged Chinese spy balloon incident. The two sides held high-level talks this week for the first time since the U.S. shot the balloon out of the sky in February off South Carolina, after it spent days floating across the country. 
 
CNN's Kristie Lu Stout is live for us in Hong Kong. Kristie, what impact did this meeting have on the tensions in the relationship between these two superpowers? 
 
KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Bianca, this was a surprise meeting, but also a significant one. Because as you said, China and the U.S., with this meeting, they're trying to move beyond the balloon incident, and to stabilize the relationship. We have China's top diplomat Wang Yi meet with the U.S. national security adviser. The two met for two days of talks spending some eight hours in Vienna. This is the highest-level meeting between both sides since that alleged surveillance balloon incident, which led the U.S. Secretary of State, America's top diplomat to delay a planned visit to Beijing. 
 
Now China's embassy in Washington issued this statement. The language saying, quote: Candid, in-depth, substantive and constructive discussions took place, on removing obstacles in China U.S. relations and stabilizing the relationship from deterioration. Unquote. 
 
And then a White House read out interestingly used very similar language, saying this -- and we have that for you.
 
Quote: The two sides had candid, substantive, and constructive discussions on key issues in the U.S.-China bilateral relationship, global and regional security issues, Russia's war against Ukraine, and cross-Strait issues, among other topics.
 <br>[04:35:04]
 
Now as we've been reporting for a while now, the diplomatic rift between these two superpowers has been deepening over a host of issues, everything from Ukraine to Taiwan, to access to technology -- including ships, the balloon incident, the list goes on. 
 
And although these talks in Vienna were deemed candid and constructive by both China and the United States, we still don't know when Blinken will visit China -- Bianca. 
 
NOBILO: And Kristie, you brought our attention to the fact that a Chinese envoy will be visiting Ukraine on May 15. What more have you learned about this? 
 
STOUT: Yes, Bianca, this was at today's ministry of foreign affairs briefing, and they confirmed that a Chinese envoy, Li Hui, will be visiting Ukraine, and Russia as well as Poland, France and Germany. This visit will begin starting May the 15th, and the aim here is to promote peace talks. That's according to the ministry of foreign affairs spokesperson Wang Wenbin. He said that the visit is another manifestation of China's commitment to persuade and promote talks. He says demonstrating that China is firmly on the side of peace, unquote. Bianca, that really remains to be seen. Back to you. 
 
NOBILO: Kristie Lu Stout always great to hear from you, thank you very much. 
 
STOUT: Thank you. 
 
NOBILO: Twitter could be about to get a new CEO. Current chief Elon Musk says that he's found a replacement to step into his shoes, and that she'll start in six weeks. Musk didn't name the mystery woman, but media reports suggest it could be Linda Yaccarino, NBCUniversal's head of advertising. Musk says he now plans to step back and become chair and chief technology officer. 
 
Joran van der Sloot's attorney says they will appeal an extradition order to the U.S., approved by Peru's Supreme Court. The Dutch citizen was one of the last people to see American teenager Natalee Holloway alive before she disappeared in Aruba nearly two decades ago. A prime suspect in her disappearance, he'll face charges of extortion and fraud in the U.S. As CNN's Jean Casarez reports. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JEAN CASAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): 18 years after Alabama teenager Natalee Holloway vanished on a school trip in Aruba, the prime suspect in her disappearance is being extradited to the United States. Joran van der Sloot, who was one of the last people to see Holloway alive and twice detained in connection with her disappearance, will finally face federal charges in the U.S. for extortion and wire fraud.
 
BETH HOLLOWAY, MOTHER OF NATALEE HOLLOWAY: He knows exactly what happened. He knows what, where, when, who, why and how. He knows the answers.
 
CASAREZ (voice-over): He is accused of extorting thousands from Holloway's mother Beth, in exchange for details on the location of her daughter's remains. According to legal documents in March 2010, van der Sloot quote, offered to take the cooperating witness to the location of Natalee Holloway's body, advise as to the circumstances of her death, and identify those in her death and disappearance in return for a payment of $250,000. 
 
Papers were signed, a total of $25,000 was given to van der Sloot, and Holloway's attorney flew to Aruba.
 
Van der Sloot took the attorney to a house saying her body was buried within the foundation. Soon after fleeing to Peru with the $25,000, he emailed the Holloway saying quote, he had lied about the location of Natalee's remains. Extortion charges were filed a short time later.
 
In May 2005, the 18-year-old Holloway was last seen leaving a nightclub in Aruba with van der Sloot and two other men. All three were charged by Aruban prosecutors in 2007 for involvement in manslaughter, but a judge ordered their release, citing a lack of direct evidence. Her body was never found.
 
Beth Holloway said in a statement, she would be 36 years old now. It has been a very long and painful journey, but the persistence of many is going to pay off. Together, we are finally getting justice for Natalee.
 
After the U.S. legal proceedings conclude, van der Sloot will be sent back to Peru according to a statement from Peru's judiciary. To a Peruvian prison where he is serving time for the murder of 21-year-old Stephanie Flores. She was murdered five years after Holloway's disappearance.
 
CNN was allowed exclusive access to van der Sloot's cell shortly after his arrest, and in 2012, he was sentenced to 28 years in prison for that murder.
 
CASAREZ: The attorney for Joran van der Sloot, Maximo Altez, is telling CNN that he is going to fight this extradition request that was ordered by Peru's Supreme Court. He believes the charges are just too old to have it be valid. Of course, there is an extradition treaty between the United States and Peru signed in 2001.

NOBILO: Former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan appears in an Islamabad court. We'll have a live report for you from Islamabad. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
NOBILO: In the conflict between Israel and Islamic Jihad militants in Gaza, sirens have been sounding in Israel in the last few minutes, ending 13 hours without warnings of incoming fire. Israel's also reporting its first death. Palestinian officials meanwhile say 31 people have been killed in Gaza, including militants, and involved civilians. 
 
Israel's Defense Forces say that more than 800 rockets have been fired at Israel since the violence started earlier this week. One of them hit an Israeli apartment building wounding five people and killing one. The IDF says it has hit nearly 200 targets in Gaza since the start of Operation Shield and Arrow. 
 
Journalist Elliott Gotkine joins me now from Jerusalem with the latest. Elliott, I believe that sirens have been sounding around where you are. How concerned is the population about the continuance of this violence? 
 
ELLIOT GOTKINE, JOURNALIST: Bianca, you're right, sirens have been sounding for the first time in some 13 hours or so, in the communities around the Gaza strip. So there haven't been any longer-range rockets fired towards Israel since the ending of that overnight quite. But yes, sirens are sounding again. Rockets are again being fired by Islamic Jihad militants towards Israel. 
 
Israel for its part did -- there was a bit of a like a six-hour break between airstrikes overnight. There was an attempt to fire a mortar shell before these barrage of rockets. The IDF spokesman told me just earlier, that Israel says, it managed to hit that mortar firing at that mortar and so prevented that from happening. 
 <br>[04:45:00]
 
But it looks like this it's business than usual, unfortunately, and exactly what we've seen over the last 2 to 3 days. The quite that we saw overnight was giving rise to further hopes that we were inching towards some kind of cease-fire -- again, likely to be brokered by Egypt. But clearly, we're not there just yet. And so, the fighting continues and Israel is continuing to hit targets in the Gaza Strip and the militants of Islamic Jihad are continuing to fire rockets towards Israel. 
 
And as you say, the first death in Israel took place yesterday when a rocket scored a direct hit on an apartment block killing one person in a city of Rehovot. The IDF putting that down to a malfunction from its Iron Dome defense system which is currently having a success rate of just over 90 percent -- Bianca. 
 
NOBILO: And, Elliott, this week you've been speaking about remembering the Palestinian American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh. And one year on Israel is finally apologizing for her death. 
 
GOTKINE: That's right. In an interview with CNN yesterday, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, he's the chief spokesman for the Israeli Defense Forces. He took the opportunity to say, sorry. And this was the first time that the idea for anyone in authority in Israel have said as much. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REAR ADMIRAL DANIEL HAGARI, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES CHIEF SPOKESPERSON: I think it's an opportunity for me to say here that we are very sorry of the deaths of the late Shireen Abu Akleh. She was a journalist, a very established journalist. And in Israel we are a democracy, and in democracy we see high value in journalism and in free press, and want journalist to feel safe in Israel, especially in wartime, even if they criticize us, we want them to feel safe. It is all about democracy, and we are liberal democracy.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
GOTKINE: And of course, Bianca, that apology coming a year to the day from when Shireen Abu Akleh was killed in the Israeli occupied West Bank. 
 
NOBILO: Elliott Gotkine for us in Jerusalem, thank you.

NOBILO: Pakistan's former Prime Minister Imran Khan appears in an Islamabad courtroom a day after the country's Supreme Court ruled that his arrest earlier this week was unlawful. Pakistani police imposed an emergency ban on gatherings ahead of the hearing, as Khan supporters called for a peaceful demonstration at the courthouse. 
 
So far there's been no return to the angry demonstrations that rocked Pakistan this week, leaving at least eight people dead, and hundreds detained. CNN producer Sophia Saifi joins me now live from Islamabad. Sophia, our viewers are looking at live pictures which I believe are outside the courtroom. We can see special forces or military members. Just tell us what we're waiting for? 
 
SOPHIA SAIFI, CNN PRODUCER: Bianca, right now there is interval for Friday prayers. Because Friday is a holiday in Pakistan. It's a half working day. So, this is now extending beyond court hours. There is a high level of security outside the Islamabad high court where Imran Khan is currently inside with a lot of lawyers. The media is inside as well. Outside is a high security paramilitary contingent. They've been troops that have been called in to keep a secure situation within the capital. 
 
We're being told by a reporter on the ground who actually managed to speak to Imran Khan. And Imran Khan has told him that he is 100 percent sure that he might actually be arrested again. Khan is also accused the military, the head of military, for putting him in this situation. He said there's only one man who is doing this and he is named the chief of Army staff as the person behind his leading the charge behind his arrest. 
 
Now Imran Khan's arrest was called illegal by the Supreme Court yesterday. And we are waiting to see what's going to happen after court resumes, after this interval that's going to restart in about half an hour from now. 
 
Imran Khan's protesters are gathering in the capital, that like you said, there's a ban on gatherings. So, there is a seeming set for potential clashes. Pakistan's Prime Minister has called Imran Khan's supporters terrorists. A lot of the senior leadership of Imran Khan's party, the very familiar faces, are barred from (INAUDIBLE), where people look up to, are behind bars. They are in police custody. 
 
There is a complete lockdown of the internet. There is no data. There's no WhatsApp. There's no Facebook. There's no YouTube. There's no Twitter for the past four days here in Pakistan. So, there is a lot of uncertainty, perhaps Khan will get bail. Perhaps he'll be reprimanded and apprehended again. We just have to wait and see -- Bianca. 
 
NOBILO: CNN producer Sophia Saifi in Islamabad for us. Thank you so much for your tireless reporting this week. We'll be checking with you throughout the day. It is just before 2:00 p.m. there in Pakistan. 
 
Perhaps the greatest player in U.S. football history will get a special honor from his old team when the NFL season kicks off later this year. Former quarterback Tom Brady will be honored at the New England Patriots home opener against the Philadelphia Eagles on September 10th. Brady announced in February he was retiring for good after 23 seasons, and seven Super Bowl rings. Six with the Pats, one with Tampa Bay. Patriots' owner Robert Kraft dismissed Brady as a skinny beanpole in 2000 where he signed him in the sixth round of the draft. It was a inspired pick though. Now he says that he wants fans to get to think Brady for his 20 years with the Patriots.
