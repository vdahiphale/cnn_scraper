ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR:  And welcome back to London on this historic and remarkable day as the world tunes in to watch the coronation of King Charles III and Queen Camilla. We've seen some striking images today, starting with the arrivals at Westminster Abbey, members of the royal family, including Prince Harry walking in earlier today for the official service. 
 
Prince William, the heir to the British throne with his wife Princess Catherine, and two of their children. Their eldest Prince George, second in line to the throne given the prestigious job of carrying the robes of the king as one of his pages, and the queen as they arrive at Westminster. In a moment Charles, who has been waiting 70 years for, the king gave his solemn oath to faithfully serve the United Kingdom and commonwealth countries around the world.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The coronation oath has stood for centuries and is enshrined in law. Are you willing to take the oath? 
 
KING CHARLES III, UNITED KINGDOM:  I am willing. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COOPER:  In one of the most touching moments today, the newly crowned king was seen getting emotional as Prince William pledged his loyalty to his father and gave him a kiss on the cheek. Queen Camilla also received her own coronation. She opted to wear Queen Mary's crown which was updated to include diamonds from the late Queen Elizabeth's personal collection.
 
After the service the royal couple was paraded back to the palace in spectacular fashion, joined on the journey by 4,000 troops from the armed forces as well as thousands of cheering onlookers before receiving the royal salute. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Hip, hip.
 
CROWD:  Hooray!
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Hip, hip.
 
CROWD:  Hooray!
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Hip, hip.
 
CROWD:  Hooray!

COOPER:  King Charles and Queen Camilla just made the customary balcony appearance, joined by Prince William and other working members of the royal family. The king's other son, Prince Harry, was not present. An extraordinary day and ceremony which many of us witnessed for the first time in our lives. 
 
CNN's Matthew Chance is outside Buckingham Palace where thousands of people are still gathered, though the rain is becoming a little heavier right now. Matthew, how are things? 
 
MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, it's wet, Anderson. It's wet, but it is still an incredible sort of street party. I can tell you, and I'm astonished that people have come out and are in such high spirits given the weather. Although, obviously, to a lot of people this is an enormously important and fun moment. I mean talk about fun moment, you guys win the best -- the prize for the best costumes. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Thank you, thank you.
 
CHANCE:  Where are you all from? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Tamworth.
 
CHANCE:  From Tamworth, which is the in Midlands I think near Birmingham. And you were telling me earlier that you stayed out all night to be here. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes, we got here at midnight and stayed on the mount. 
 
CHANCE:  Was it worth it? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Absolutely. 
 
CHANCE:  Did you get a glimpse of the king and the queen? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes, we did. 
 
CHANCE:  And how did that feel? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Fantastic. 
 
CHANCE:  So not a wasted effort. You're happy. That's fantastic.
 
Why -- there's another monarch over here waiting -- why is it important for you to come out and to witness this coronation in the rain? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  There are actually two reasons. 
 
CHANCE:  Go on then. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  One, our parents were here for the queen's coronation at Saint James Palace. So we stayed on the mount opposite Saint James Palace because they're not here. So it's tradition. And secondly can't keep us away from London. 
 
CHANCE:  OK, family tradition. That's good. 
 
One last person I need to quickly bring to you. We've got a veteran over here. It's not just about celebrating the day of history. It's about something else as well, isn't it?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's service and loyalty, and that's what the royal family offers this country, and that's what we pledge in return is service and loyalty.
 
CHANCE:  Thank you much for your service, thank you very much for speaking to us. That's all we've got time for. But handing it back to you, Anderson, over there. You can see very high spirits here outside Buckingham Palace. 
 
COOPER:  Matthew, thank you. 
 
I want to bring in Salma Abdelaziz. She's also near Buckingham Palace. Salma, you've been talking to a lot of enthusiastic folks all morning long. They're still there in the rain. 
 <br>[10:05:08]
 
SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN REPORTER:  I think what's been most extraordinary, Anderson, is seeing this moment through the eyes of Britain's youngest. And I have to introduce you to two of them, and I think they're excited today. Emily and Sophia, who are best friends, 10 years old. Their moms are standing here. What was today like, girls? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It was so exciting because we got to see the Golden Carriage right up close because I was on someone's shoulders, and me and Emily also got to go up right to the gates and see them come out on the balcony. 
 
ABDELAZIZ:  And when I saw you guys you were literally jumping up and down. Why? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Because we were so excited. ABDELAZIZ:  Tell me what you got so excited. You got to see the king
 
 four times today. What was your favorite moment? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Well, my favorite moment was seeing him in the carriage. 
 
ABDELAZIZ:  That was the best part for you. And what does it mean for you to be here today? What are you going to tell your school friends when you see them. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I'm going to tell them I was here and you weren't. 
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
ABDELAZIZ:  That's one way to do it. That's one way to do it. And you have both your sweatshirts matching. Do you think you're going to think about this for the rest of your lives? What is the memory you're going to remember the most? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I'm going to remember the king waving on the balcony, and Charlotte, too, and I'm also going to remember seeing the king in the carriage come down the mall. 
 
ABDELAZIZ:  That's wonderful. And did the rain bother you at all today? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No, it did not, because I love the rain anyway. 
 
ABDELAZIZ:  You got that absolutely perfect. I hope you girls have safe trips home and you tell everyone at school about it. 
 
And Anderson, it's really been that sentiment. These girls were literally, found strangers, were on their shoulders being hosted, were holding onto the gates as the royal stepped out onto the balcony. It's truly, truly a lifetime memory. 
 
COOPER:  Yes, it's awesome to hear their enthusiasm. It makes me miss my kids.
 
I want to bring in Charles Anson. He's a former press secretary for Queen Elizabeth II. Thanks so much for being with us, Charles. How do you think it went? 
 
CHARLES ANSON, FORMER PRESS SECRETARY TO QUEEN ELIZABETH:  I think the service was quite superb. It was completely faultless. And it had all the sort of ceremony and seriousness, beautiful music. And there were little touches, like the archbishop carefully checking that the crown was on the king. 
 
COOPER:  We heard the king reciting prayers out loud, which I think is the first time that's occurred, is that right? 
 
ANSON:  That is. Normally you don't hear the sovereign playing aloud. 
 
COOPER:  Why do you think that was done? ANSON:  I think partly because this is modern generation, but I think
 
 also the king is deeply religious, as his mother was, and he's very public in his faith, and his faith is very deep. So I think it's absolutely natural for him to speak a prayer. 
 
COOPER:  We also saw, as he was leaving, he was greeted by representatives of all the different faiths of many of the biggest faiths in the United Kingdom, all speaking simultaneously to him wishing him well. 
 
ANSON:  That's it. And I think it's been a feature of the king's faith, of King Charles' faith, is to be as inclusive as possible of other religions and other points of view. And I remember as press secretary in the mid-1990s, as Prince Charles giving a speech about the profoundly important parts of Islam that influenced Christian faith as well. So he's had this huge interest in the religions as a whole for a long, long time. It's not something new. It's always been there, and I think the profundity of his faith --
 
COOPER:  What do you think the queen would have thought? 
 
ANSON:  The queen, you could see her lips moving but her faith was much quieter, different generation. 
 
COOPER:  No, I mean what do you think she would have thought of today? 
 
ANSON:  Oh, I think she would have been very touched and moved by it. I think the queen had her own way of being monarch. And I think, you know, very much in these last years of her reign and Prince Charles taking over more of her responsibilities, she was very much in favor of him and admired the fact that he had so many modern views about young people, about faith, about tolerance, about inclusion of people of other races and faiths and views and points of view. 
 
And I think he genuinely finds that an important part of his religion, but also an important part of his duties as king and head of the commonwealth, to create as inclusive a society as possible. 
 
And I think at the end of the day, the queen's wish and now the king's wish was to just do what they could to make this a slightly better world. And I think that came across very well in this service with so many different faiths and different age groups involved. 
 <br>[10:10:00]
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT:  You were in the palace, the council of communications and a lot the office, weren't you, at the very difficult times in the late 90s around Diana's death and the breakdown of the relationship. Do you see today as the culmination of the rehabilitation of Queen Camilla's image? 
 
ANSON:  I think definitely Queen Camilla has played the role very well. She's open, she's inclusive as well. And she's easy to talk to and easy to deal with. And I think in terms of acceptance I think the British attitude can be critical at times, but eventually when something's going to happen, on the whole Brits get behind it. And I think in that respect the coronation will be a confirming moment
 
 where people will say, look, this is the beginning of the new reign. Today the king has been not only confirmed in his role as head of state constitutionally, but also his role as head of the nation, and also as an important sort of influence in terms of attitudes and inclusion and the sort of society that he'd like to see develop. And I think all of that is helpful in terms of acceptance of Queen Camilla and of him as king. 
 
COOPER:  I think many American viewers were watching to see if Prince Harry would be included on the balcony, hoping perhaps there would be some sort of healing. What is his role today? He was there but not on the balcony. What does it say moving forward about the possibility of all that? 
 
ANSON:  I think the balcony appearance certainly in the last three or four years has come more to be those of the working members of the royal family. So those who are members of the royal family but don't have a public role, don't have an automatic position on the balcony. But I don't think that's the sort of terrible thing. You can't have too many people on the balcony. 
 
And in any case, I think the king himself wants to see a smaller working monarchy. I think that's the wish of people in this country, that they don't want to see too much expense, too much extravagance in the monarchy. What they want is a good, effective working monarchy, but something that's a bit smaller. If you look at the monarchies in the rest of Europe, the Dutch, the Danes, the Swedes and others, they all have much smaller monarchies. They're much smaller countries, of course. 
 
But I think the way forward is a smaller working monarchy, but it means an awful lot of work. The king for prince of Wales, William and Catherine, and of course not having Prince Harry as a working member of the royal family, it means that the workload is greater. On the other hand, I think in the modern media, I think you can see a lot more of the monarchy with a smaller monarchy because actually it's seen. 
 
COOPER:  Charles Anson, I really appreciate your time today. Thank you. 
 
Up next, the coronation celebrations have gone to the dogs. How pet owners in London paid tribute to the king during today's historic service. A lot of King Charles spaniels out there. 
 
Plus, Prince Louis strikes again. The adorable young royal lets the world know how he really feels during his grandfather's coronation.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:17:30]
 
COOPER:  And welcome back to London on this historic day. King Charles and Queen Camilla have been officially crowned. Thousands of people are still in the streets around Buckingham Palace celebrating their new monarchs' reign. Bars are open. Another group of royal fans found a unique way to mark the day's festivities. CNN's Anna Stewart is in the heart of London. I understand you've been bringing us to the dogs, or you're going to bring us to the dogs. 
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER:  Well, listen, while you were watching that historic scene, the balcony shot with King Charles and Queen Camilla and the rest of the family, I was also treated to a wondrous sight, 180 cavalier King Charles spaniels on parade here on aptly name King's Road where there is a street party, but as you'll see, it's a little bit soggy and not many people have decided it's worth sitting down for a picnic. But nonetheless, the parade actually went ahead. 
 
You will know from events past in terms of royal events, that really corgis have stolen the show. That was the chosen breed of her late majesty. But now a new hound has been crowned, and I spoke to the lovely owners of these little pups. Have a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
STEWART:  So you must be thrilled that it's finally time for the cavalier King Charles to shine. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They're a lovely dog, and they've gotten their day, which is really great. 
 
STEWART:  How do you feel about this special day? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It's amazing. It's so wonderful to be out with all the marvelous community, and the cavaliers of London and celebrating the king's coronation in the rain of London. 
 
STEWART:  You must be very proud that finally it's time for your dogs to steal the royal spotlight after years of corgis. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  A little bit, yes, we are. We're big King Charles cavalier lovers in our family, so, yes. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
STEWART:  Of course, not everyone would like King Charles and Queen Camilla to actually get a cavalier King Charles spaniel. They have Jack Russell terriers for now. I could be wrong, but I think 180 cavalier King Charles spaniels all in one place, and this is completely unverified, completely made up fact, but it could be the biggest gathering of cavalier King Charles spaniels we've ever seen. Anderson? 
 
COOPER:  Well, at least on this day. Thanks so much, Anna. 
 
Let's check in with Julia Chatterley and her team at the London studios. Julia? 
 
JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT:  Thanks so much, Anderson. We were just having a discussion about the grandchildren and what we make of some of the heart melting moments I think that we always capture, events like this obviously notwithstanding. 
 <br>[10:20:04]
 
For me, I think Prince George, if we talk about him first, because obviously in line to the throne, he recognizes one day this will be him. But for me I think the biggest challenge and problem today was wrestling with the queen's robe. 
 
KATE WILLIAMS, CNN ROYAL HISTORIAN:  Every other child or grandchild who's come to a coronation, because they're not events for children, they really aren't, has had a role of JUST sitting there. And George had this key role of wrestling with the robe in the rain, which wasn't easy. And to think that he's only nine and he is really watching his destiny. 
 
The next person to sit that coronation chair will be his father, which you'll see, and one day it will be him, King George VII. And at this moment, I think, to see your destiny so obvious in front of you is totally overwhelming for a child. But he looked like he took it in stride. He was delighted. Princess Charlotte was looking after Louis. They looked like they were enjoying the occasion. 
 
CHATTERLEY:  They're incredibly well-behaved. 
 
SALLY BEDELL SMITH, ROYAL BIOGRAPHER AND AUTHOR:  Their family reminds me of George VI and Queen Elizabeth and Lilibet and Margaret, very tightly bound. And from what I can gather from hearing about the rehearsals earlier in the week, George was taking it very seriously. He was doing everything that everybody was asking him. And he's a good young boy, and I think he rose to the occasion to the extent that he could in the pouring rain. 
 
WILLIAMS:  It's fun to think he was having his own coronation ceremonies and celebrations at school, as so many children across the U.K. have been. And he was having coronations --  
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
WILLIAMS:  A special coronation school lunch probably, and now here he is playing this crucial role. And it was lovely to see so many children there. And I really think for George, the secret weapon of the monarchy is William and Kate, but it's also the children. And they get all the attention. They really are --
 
CHATTERLEY:  Louis is the secret weapon, though. I love Louis. 
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
RICHARD QUEST, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT:  So we elegantly sail into the sea of hypocrisy. We're the first lot to all say the way media looks at them, the way we focus on them, the way we put so much pressure on them. Now poor George and Louis have pictures of them yawning, which will be on every newspaper tomorrow morning. 
 
CHATTERLEY:  They're already there. 
 
QUEST:  So which way do we want -- there it is, he's yawning. Poor kid. 
 
CHATTERLEY:  But here's the thing --  
 
TRISHA GODDARD, BRITISH TELEVISION PRESENTER:  No, I don't think it's criticism. I think it melts the heart of every parent, because every parent can imagine their children --  
 
QUEST:  How will he feel?
 
GODDARD:  Oh, he won't mind. 
 
QUEST:  How do you know? This could be a damaging moment. 
 
GODDARD:  Only at his 21st birthday when their parents wheel them out. I actually take your point that the future of the monarchy is the children, and I think it's very clever. And every occasion is a P.R. moment. It's very clever because it engages women and mothers and families. You just sort of look at him waving there -- 
 
CHATTERLEY:  This is Louis's classic. 
 
GODDARD:  I do hope that they envelope the younger children not first in line a little more than they did with -- 
 
QUEST:  Yes, but the problem here is -- the problem here is you start with this process, and now you have a difficulty of where you stop it. Where do you -- at what point do you say no more pictures? 
 
CHATTERLEY:  It's astonishing, isn't it, Richard, to think at no point -- 
 
QUEST:  Then you take long lenses of the kids in school.
 
SMITH:  I think the Prince and Princess of Wales have managed the cover of their children very, very well. 
 
QUEST:  Brilliantly. 
 
SMITH:  They've laid down the law that the pictures were of children, and they were going to be controlled by the Prince and Princess of Wales. And the media have, for the most part, except for public occasions like this, they have pretty well abided by it. And it all comes down to modeling. And these children are being very, very well- modeled by William and Kate. 
 
WILLIAMS:  To me it's astonishing to think Harry was just a few years older when he was walking behind the coffin of Princess Diana, and in the same Westminster Abbey. To me that is stunning to think that that happened just not that long ago, that children were used as a human shield for the monarchy. 
 
SMITH:  We forget Harry was behind the coffin when he wasn't much older --  
 
WILLIAMS:  Only a tiny toddler.
 
SMITH:  Yes, only a young child. 
 
CHATTERLEY:  Richard has an announcement. 
 
QUEST:  I have no evidence for this. 
 
(LAUGHTER)
 <br>[10:25:00]
 
QUEST:  I have no proof of it. I'm going on a limb. I think Harry is on his way back to Los Angeles at 3:45 this afternoon on the BA-269. 
 
GODDARD:  Wildly speculating. 
 
WILLIAMS:  We saw a lipreader saying close to four --  
 
GODDARD:  And he's off. He's looking through all the timetables. 
 
WILLIAMS:  So he could make the close to four.
 
QUEST:  Oh, yes. 
 
CHATTERLEY:  Twenty minutes to take off, Anderson. I'm handing the plane over to you. 
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
COOPER:  Well, what is likely going on behind the scenes within the royal family right now as they celebrate the historic day, someone with inside knowledge of the inner working joins us ahead, the former director of Royal Communications at Buckingham Palace. We'll be right back. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:30:05]
 
COOPER:  A once in a lifetime moment unfolding in London here today. For the first time in 70 years the coronation of a British monarch, King Charles III officially crowned this morning, 70 years after the coronation of his mother, the late Elizabeth II. Quite a morning. Joining me now to discuss, someone who worked for the late queen, Sally Osman, the former director of Royal Communications at Buckingham Palace. Thank you so much for being with us. How do you think it went today? 
 
SALLY OSMAN, FORMER DIRECTOR OF ROYAL COMMUNICATIONS AT BUCKINGHAM PALACE:  I thought it was magnificent. I thought, I have to admit I got quite emotional watching it because it's so -- we've seen the carriages in the news for people to go and visit. 
 
We see the regalia behind glass in the Jewel House at the Tower of London. But today we saw them used for their proper purposes, imbued with meaning and imbued with symbolism. And yes, I find it very moving, actually, very moving. COOPER:  There's been talk about Charles, the king and queen. There
 
 was not a lot of sort of public enjoyment or smiles. Is that just the weight of the day, you think? 
 
OSMAN:  Yes, because normally when you see the two of them together, the king and the queen, and now we can officially call it the queen, Queen Camilla, there's a lot of humor, there's a lot of levity. And there were moments, actually, when she was enthroned, when you could almost see they were trying to look at each other, and of course they couldn't because they were both sort of facing in the same direction. And I think the moments would have been there. 
 
But it was a profoundly serious religious moment, certainly for the king. And so I think the weight would be on their shoulders. It was for the queen, the late queen, when she was crowned. Everybody said she was so coy, she was so calm. But I bet underneath all of that, there were nerves. There were nerves. 
 
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR:  You know, Sally, the last time we spoke on CNN was actually during the queen's funeral. And that was such a sad moment. She'd been in everybody's lives for 70 years on the throne. 
 
People knew her as Princess Elizabeth. But in the same way people really know King Charles. He's had the longest apprenticeship in history of any of the hereditary monarchs. What do you think that will mean for his relationship, his ongoing relationship with the people? Do people expect something different now that he's king? 
 
OSMAN:  Well, they'll expect to do him doing more kingly roles than he did before when he was still Prince of Wales and doing those official duties that obviously the queen did but he had increasingly stepped up to do. 
 
But he's not going to change his character overnight, because he's made his reputation as Prince of Wales and being and very, very, very effective Prince of Wales by being the man that he is, being so passionate about the things he's passionate about. 
 
AMANPOUR:  And about so many vital issues. 
 
And you were communications director at the palace behind us. And there are many people who believe and really care deeply about some of things he does, the environment, natural world, all of that kind of stuff. Is he really going to have to be silent just because he's got a crown on his head on something as important as climate, for instance, which is not a political issue? 
 
OSMAN:  Silence is a strong word to use. I think we saw when, it was COP-27 -- I lose count. 
 
AMANPOUR:  Yes, it was COP-27. He wanted to go, and he was told by the prime minister not to.
 
OSMAN:  But he held a reception here just ahead of COP and invited everybody. Everybody came. So that convening role that he's made, well, it's a factor of monarchy but he's made very much his own, I think will still happen. He'll still want to bring people together to discuss things. But he can't maybe get as involved as he might have done because he's got all the jobs that go with being king. 
 
COOPER:  The role of Prince Harry is obviously being much talked about and he was not on the balcony today. He was at Westminster Abbey. What's your sense of -- it's an unknowable, I suppose, but what the future holds for that relationship? 
 
OSMAN:  Between father and son? 
 
COOPER:  Yes. 
 
OSMAN:  Well, again, I think one of the magic moments of today actually was that moment when Prince William came up and did, your liege of man and life and limb, which obviously had echoes what his grandfather, Prince Philip, had said to the queen in 1953. I thought that was an incredibly powerful moment between father and son as well as being between sovereign and heir. 
 
And I think the relationship there I think -- I'm not there anymore. I don't know, but I think he's very powerful, very strong. And the role of the heir and the rest of the royal family is to support the monarch. And I think that's what they're there to do. While pursuing, as the Prince of Wales now, Prince William would still be able to still pursue his own particular interests. 
 <br>[10:35:00]
 
But I thought it was very significant, as well, the balcony shot. Everybody was waiting to see who would be on the balcony. And aside from the children, obviously, it was very significant because it was every single working member of the royal family. That's the --
 
COOPER:  It was interesting to me, though --  
 
OSMAN:  Including the older cousins.
 
COOPER:  -- that they staged it so that it was the king and queen and the pages, and then the family members on all the sides. I would have thought they would have had sort of family members together. 
 
OSMAN:  That's just a question of choreography, I think. But the significance was, the older cousins, the Duke of Kent, the Gloucesters, Princess Alexandra, were there because they are still working members of the royal family, doing hundreds of engagements every year. And of course, they were the queen's great support network when she was a young queen. They are now part of the Carolian (ph) team, if you like, who will take the work of the royal family and the work of the monarchy forward. 
 
COOPER:  Sally Osman, I appreciate your time today, thank you.
 
OSMAN:  Thank you very much.
 
COOPER:  Up next, a guest who played a big role in today's ceremony, the composer of the king's coronation march, ahead.

(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COOPER:  Beautiful sounds from today's coronation ceremony. This is King Charles III's coronation march. I'm joined by the composer of a piece of it, Patrick Doyle. It's such a pleasure to have you here, a son of Lanarkshire, Scotland. My nanny growing up, who was like my mother, was from Bothwell, which is very close to where you were. 
 
PATRICK DOYLE, ATTENDED CORONATION OF KING CHARLES III:  Well, its' two-and-a-half miles from -- 
 
AMANPOUR:  Only Anderson can say that.
 
COOPER:  It's true.
 
DOYLE:  I can't believe the name. I thought --
 
COOPER:  I'm spent a lot of time in Bothwell. I have, yes.
 
DOYLE:  I'm from two-and-a-half miles from Bothwell, and Lanarkshire, I'm watching this --  
 
COOPER:  May (ph) McLinden (ph) was my nanny's name, and she lived there and she died there. And she was --
 
AMANPOUR:  And how did Lanarkshire then influence your coronation march? 
 
DOYLE:  Well, Lanarkshire, I think the Lanarkshire Youth Orchestra, the brass band at school, and then I went to my great teacher, Edith (ph) Ferguson (ph), living in View Park which is near Bothwell, and she wrote a letter to the academy of music saying he's slightly behind, but he's going to do well. And I got a place at the Academy. I was a member of the junior orchestra there. 
 
COOPER:  And your first film that you composed for I think was Kenneth Branagh. Was is Henry --
 
DOYLE:  "Henry V."
 
COOPER:  "Henry V," an amazing film.
 
AMANPOUR:  Once more into the breach.
 
DOYLE:  That's right. 
 
AMANPOUR:  And you've done "Harry Potter" and all the rest, so how does that lead to you to get an invitation from the king to do the coronation march? COOPER:  In fact, let's just play a little bit of your -- 
 
DOYLE:  Sure. Sure.

COOPER:  It's lovely. 
 
DOYLE:  Thank you. Thank you. 
 
COOPER:  How do you go about this? Because I know you're given I think four minutes. They've said it has to be four minutes, and it's got to be uplifting. 
 
DOYLE:  Yes, uplifting, triumphant, and memorable. So no pressure. And after it's done, can you please arrange it for millions of bands around the world individually. But you asked the question earlier, King Charles, you mentioned "Harry V," he saw the film and was so moved by the movie and the non nobis domine at the end, he wrote me a lovely letter, then shortly afterwards he committed to write a piece for the Queen Mother's 90th birthday. 
 
AMANPOUR:  So you've had a long relationship. 
 
DOYLE:  Yes, a long professional friendship, and he's been very kind over the years to me in my career. 
 
AMANPOUR:  You're in your morning suit still. So you were in the abbey. Were you conducting? Were you just --
 
DOYLE:  No, I was sitting with all the composers in the quire, spelt q-u-i-r-e. 
 
AMANPOUR:  Right.
 
DOYLE:  So I was sitting in the corner and I pinch, he pinched me. We all were pinching each other. 
 
AMANPOUR:  Like can you believe we're here? 
 
DOYLE:  I'm sorry. This mania, it's a mania, 13 brothers and sisters, and here I am sitting in the abbey and it's all these great people throughout my life, and that area that you mentioned, it's so lovely that you mentioned that from there. 
 
And I think about my life just flashed in front of me, this brilliant day, phenomenal day, outstanding, extraordinary, these great people, great positions, these people from all over the world. And I can't believe I'm here. It's absolutely amazing.
 
COOPER:  You are one of the great things that comes from Lanarkshire. The other is, of course, is Tunnock's Biscuits. I've been to the factory. I've toured the factory as a child. They're the greatest chocolate biscuits. I'm obsessed with them.
 
AMANPOUR:  We should have had them for the coronation. 
 
COOPER:  I would have loved to. 
 
DOYLE:  This is ridiculous. That Tunnock's factory is across from my school. 
 
COOPER:  Is it really? 
 
DOYLE:  They used to come out with their hats on. 
 
COOPER:  I love Tunnocks. 
 
DOYLE:  This is ridiculous. I thought the surreality of my day had stopped. But now it's on with it again.
 
COOPER:  Listen, you had an extraordinary day. Congratulations. What an extraordinary career you've had. 
 
DOYLE:  I watch the two of you on TV a lot. It's a real honor. 
 
AMANPOUR:  And I've listened to your movie scores and now your coronation march. 
 <br>[10:45:00]
 
DOYLE:  Thank you very much.
 
COOPER:  And we wish everyone in Bothwell and Lanarkshire very well.
 
DOYLE:  And hello to the whole of America.

COOPER:  My next guest had a front row seat to history. What was it like to be inside Westminster Abbey during the coronation? We'll find out. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
COOPER:  Millions of people from around the world tuned in to watch the king's coronation today, but only about 2,000 people could say they were actually in Westminster Abbey to watch it with their own eyes. One of them joins us now, Emily Nash, royal editor for "Hello!" magazine. What was it like inside? 
 
EMILY NASH, ROYAL EDITOR, "HELLO!" MAGAZINE:  It was incredible, Anderson. The atmosphere was one of great anticipation. 
 <br>[10:50:00]
 
The music was sensational, and just being in the atmosphere of the abbey where this ritual has been carried out for 1,000 years was a huge privilege. 
 
COOPER:  Did it -- obviously we all see it from the outside. What moment stood out to you as special? 
 
NASH:  Actually, the moment that I found incredibly moving, which took me by surprise, was the anointing. We didn't actually see the king being anointed, but as he was being prepared, taking off his tunic and we saw him in the simple silk shirt, that felt very, very personal and intimate. 
 
COOPER:  I mentioned that earlier. It did. It felt very strange to see him as naked as anyone would ever see him. 
 
NASH:  Absolutely. It was a pinch me moment. 
 
COOPER:  Prince Harry was seated several rows behind Princess Anne. She was wearing a hat with feathers. It was sort of obscured. What do you make of his role? What do you think it tells about the future for -- 
 
NASH:  I think the fact he was here is a good sign. I think that it shows that certain discussions have been had and that he's agreed to come -- the fact that, as you say, he was obscured from you, I was actually trying to see his face at the moment he was singing the national anthem to try and capture a glimpse of what might have been going through his mind, and it was hard to see. I think that was by design. But I think it's right as well --
 
COOPER:  You think that was intentional the seating? 
 
NASH:  I think the idea was very much not to make that a focus of the day. This was about the king and the queen. Everyone knows what's gone on, you more than many others as well behind the scenes. And the fact that he was there shows that there has been some degree of reconciliation, but they're a long way off, I think. 
 
COOPER:  Max, it is interesting, all the guests we have who are associated with the palace, when you ask them questions about Harry, they answer about Prince William and they just don't address it. 
 
FOSTER:  It's very hard to address it because we all know what the tensions are. They have been so exposed. But the palace view is to rise about it, is that the right way, not to get involved, not to engage with it. And I think there's a feeling inside that that strategy is working, allowing him to say what he's going to say, get it off his system, and hopefully at some point it stops. But ultimately, he is the king's son, and they do want him involved in these key moments for when they do eventually reconcile, so when they look back, at least he was there. 
 
NASH:  I think you're absolutely right. I think there would have been a huge amount of regret had he not made the journey, and it's a first step, I think. 
 
COOPER:  And what happens now? Is there a celebration on your block today or tomorrow? 
 
NASH:  I think there's one happening tomorrow of which I'm going to be busy to make it. There's a celebration in there right now, I think. FOSTER:  A private lunch isn't it as well? 
 
NASH:  And portraits being taken. I think we'll see some of those in the coming days. I imagine they're relieved to remove some of the regalia and put their feet up. I know the late queen talked about how good that felt after her coronation to go back and take the crown off, finally. 
 
COOPER:  It's also, when you think who long he has been thinking about this moment for, planning for this moment, wondering if, when it would come, and it would be fascinating to be inside his head and know how he feels now. 
 
NASH:  It's interesting. I think he was almost unreadable at moments during the ceremony today. You know, he did show a lot of recognition for people. I think he recognized in the congregation going through the nave, he obviously saw familiar faces, and he was smiling at them. 
 
But at other moments he appeared very solemn. And of course, it's bittersweet. He's only reached this milestone because he's lost his mother. And however much he's been preparing for this over the years, nothing can prepare you for being at the center of this kind of spectacle. 
 
FOSTER:  What is happening with Louis, because we were told he would retire when he got in? But he was there for a long time. 
 
NASH:  Louis did incredibly well. He stayed there longer than I think most people were expecting. There was this lovely moment when he was whisked away. We couldn't see that. 
 
FOSTER:  Was there an incident?
 
NASH:  There was some laughter between the Princess of Wales and Princess Charlotte, so I'd love to know exactly how they went down. He went and spent a little time in a room away. 
 
FOSTER:  Time out. Any naughty stuff? 
 
NASH:  No, I don't think so. I think maybe, if he's anything like my five-year-old, there may have been some snacks. 
 
COOPER:  But it is so lovely to see them and being human and just being kids. For anybody who has children, it's so relatable, this is what kids do. 
 
NASH:  Absolutely. And another moment that just stood out for me as well was watching Charlotte and Louis singing the national anthem as their Grandpa Wales walks past them in the imperial state crown. And what an incredible memory for them that will be. 
 
COOPER:  And to see Louis in the carriage waving to the crowd and seemed to be talking to them in some way through the glass. 
 
FOSTER:  Camilla was interesting in the way she smiled a lot more, didn't she, in her moment. Was she doing that from the heart, do you think, or was she trying to reassure Charles because it's such a big moment for him? 
 
NASH:  I think she was genuinely just appreciating the moment, enjoying the moment. She's surrounded by her supporters, by her family members, by so many people she loves. And this was a moment that wasn't always guaranteed for her. I think she did very well. 
 <br>[10:55:03]
 
And you and I know from having worked alongside her, she's a very warm person, and you can see from the moment she entered the abbey she had a warm twinkle in her eye. I hope she enjoyed it as much as she appeared to be.
 
COOPER:  Emily Nash, thank you so much. Appreciate it. Lovely. 
 
Coming up, the highlights from today's spectacular coronation service from the family moments, the official crownings, and another special guest joins us live, former private secretary for King Charles.
