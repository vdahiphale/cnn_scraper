JIM SCIUTTO, CNN ANCHOR: Ohio Governor Mike DeWine is asking the CDC now to help address residents' growing safety concerns after a train derailment caused a toxic spill in their community. 
 
ERICA HILL, CNN ANCHOR: CNN national correspondent Jason Carroll has been following this for us for some time now. He is in East Palestine this morning. 
 
So, what more do we know about this current and perhaps even upcoming air, water and soil testing? 
 
JASON CARROLL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, look, the -- Ohio's governor continues to say that the air and that the water here is safe. And this is based on ongoing testing that's being conducted here on the ground. Ohio's governor saying that both the city water, the -- in addition to that the village water, again, safe to drink. 
 
He says he's going to be bringing in the best experts going forward to make sure that the air and water is safe and he is also saying that what they're going to be doing is setting up some sort of a clinic in the middle of town so if people are feeling like they're having symptoms, they can walk in and get evaluated. He said he's doing that out of an abundance of caution. 
 
But what you're having here on the ground here, you've got this divide, right, because you have state and local officials saying the air is save, the water is safe, but then on the other hand you've got people who live here in East Palestine, some of them are saying that they feel symptomatic, that they've got sore throats. Some of them saying that they've got rashes and whatnot. And so you've got this divide. You've got a lot of distrust here between what officials are saying and what's happening (INAUDIBLE) community. 
 
Yesterday (INAUDIBLE) I had a quick opportunity to speak to the head of the EPA about all this to get some of his insight. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MICHAEL REGAN, EPA ADMINISTRATOR: If anyone is experiencing any kind of adverse symptom, have their pets go to the veterinarian, they should seek medical attention. We need for this information to get to the state health department so that we can coordinate and be sure that people are getting the help that they need. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CARROLL: Well, I think there would be an argument there from some people on the ground about whether or not they're getting the help that they need. 
 <br>[09:35:04]
 
I did press Michael Regan there about how long the EPA would be here on the ground because a lot of people are feeling that once the cameras go away, that they're going to be stuck here. And if they have problems, no one is going to be hearing them. 
 
And so when I pressed him on that, when I said, how long you guys going to be out here, he simply said, as long as it takes. 
 
Guys, back to you.
 
SCIUTTO: Yes, when you see dead fish showing up in nearby waterways, reason you'd be concerned. (INAUDIBLE).
 
Well, new video obtained by CNN, you see it right there, shows that Norfolk Southern train less than an hour before it derailed. This according to CNN analysis. And you can see in that video, in the nighttime, sparks from wheels underneath the train overheating, visible. This is as the train was passing through a Salem, Ohio. 
 
HILL: So, what caused that overheating? Well, that is part of what will be the NTSB's investigation into the incident. 
 
So, to help us better understand what's actually going on here, what happened in those moments, we're joined by Mary Schiavo, CNN transportation analyst, former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation. 
 
Mary, we always appreciate having you on because you can put this in layman's terms for us. 
 
So I think, first, let's just tackle things in order here if we can. 
 
There's been a lot of talk about the braking system and that there was a braking rule that was put into place under President Obama's administration and then it went away under the Trump administration. As I understand it, that rule would not have made a difference here. Why? 
 
MARY SCHIAVO, CNN TRANSPORTATION ANALYST: Well, it may or may not have made a difference here because -- 
 
HILL: OK.
 
SCHIAVO: So what happened -- when we see that video with the fire under the train, the train tracks, for most major rail lines, are smart tracks. And on the track are defect detectors and they have infrared sensors and they detect if a wheel or axel is overheating, that's called a hot (INAUDIBLE). It sends an automated message, voice message, to the train engineer. And you have to stop if you have a hot box. So, if they - if those sensors were working, as they should have been, and the engineer got that warning, then the engineer should have been able to stop. 
 
Now, this braking system, this electronic controlled pneumatic braking system, short nickname ECP, would have been required for all trains carrying, you know, high hazmat, highly flammable materials. However, it was limited to trains over 70 cars, going over 30 miles an hour, and carrying oil. So here, most likely, it would not have been required. But yes, it could have helped the train to stop and it probably would have stopped it much sooner. 
 
SCIUTTO: All right, so just so I understand, because that's a lot to absorb there, are you saying the sensors are the -- the sensors weren't working or that the driver ignored the warning from the sensors? 
 
SCHIAVO: Or all three of the problems. Were the sensors working? That's going to be one of the things that the NTSB wants to know right up front because those sensors are, you know, really lifesaving because they would have sensed the hot wheels. They would have sensed what's called a hot box and told the train engineer. Did that system work and did the engineer get that warning? That remains to be seen. 
 
And then, if that -- those two things occurred, did the engineer have time to stop the train and would the system (INAUDIBLE) on this train have helped it stop. So, there are a lot of - of, if this then that. But the NTSB will figure this out and the sensors are -- that's not new technology, that's been around for some time. And that's one of the reasons we don't have cabooses anymore because the smart tracks took the role of the caboose. 
 
HILL: It's so interesting. Also there are a lot of questions about even just the length of that train being nearly two miles.
 
SCIUTTO: Yes.
 
HILL: The longer the train, the longer it takes to brake. Obviously still a lot here. 
 
SCHIAVO: That's right.
 
HILL: And so many people in this country live near a rail line. It underscores the concern so many Americans have. 
 
Mary, appreciate it. And I'm sure - and I hope we'll be talking to you again soon. Thank you. 
 
SCHIAVO: Thank you. 
 
HILL: Just ahead here, the presidential contest isn't the only one already heating up as we look ahead to 2024. Three prominent Democrats jumping into the California Senate race to replace Senator Dianne Feinstein. Are they the first three of many? 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:43:44]
 
HILL: California is heating up for a blockbuster primary. Congresswoman Barbara Lee is the latest high-profile Democrat to file paperwork to run for Senator Dianne Feinstein's seat. Now, if she were to win, Lee would be only -- the only black woman in the U.S. Senate. Two of her fellow California representatives are eyeing that same seat, Adam Schiff and Katie Porter. 
 
Joining us now, former Republican Congressman Joe Walsh, who now hosts the podcast "White Fly," and Maria Cardona, Democratic strategist and CNN political commentator. 
 
Nice to see you both this morning.
 
So, Maria, as we look at what is happening here in California, already crowded, and it is February 17th of 2023, and we're already hearing people weigh in, right? You've got Nancy Pelosi throwing some support behind Adam Schiff. Barbara Lee rightly pointing out what a difference it would make in terms of representation were she to win, and not only the Democratic nomination, but, you know, take that seat. And then you have Katie Porter who, you know, new kid on the block, but gets there to Washington with her white boards, with the receipts. She has a fair amount of folks in her corner. 
 
MARIA CARDONA, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Right.
 
HILL: As we look at how and talk about how divided the Republican Party is, I wonder, is this the race that is going to show us perhaps some of those similar divisions within the Democratic Party? 
 
CARDONA: Good morning, Erica. 
 
No, I actually think that what this will show is how much of a plethora of riches the Democratic Party enjoys. 
 <br>[09:45:03]
 
And we're going to see it representing everyone who has so far put their name in for this incredibly exciting competition for an incredibly important slot in the U.S. Senate. And I think each of the candidates that have announced or have demonstrated their interest in running I think shows their strengths. I think all of them will definitely be candidates and ultimately be senators that will demonstrate and showcase why it is that the Democratic Party is the one that has the issues that most Americans find are the issues that they most care about. Focusing on the economy, focusing on health care, focusing on education, focusing on democracy. 
 
Adam Schiff represents just how much the Democratic Party has been front and center in protecting our democracy. Barbara Lee, like you mentioned, will be a historic candidate because, sadly, we are way behind on the kind of representation that our country needs for all of the communities that make up this amazing country. And Katie Porter, you just mentioned it, right, she is somebody who has shown that she knows how to bring it, to keep big pharma, to keep big corporations accountable, to put front and center the needs of working families all across California and all across the country. 
 
HILL: All right, so as we watch that play out, Joe, let's take a look at what's happening on the Republican side as we - as we look to the race for president. 
 
Nikki Haley, of course, announcing this week. And it's interesting, we really see and hear from her this delicate dance that she's trying to maintain in sort of distancing herself from the former president, her former boss, but also not distancing herself at all, you know, when pressed, will not give specific examples of where she splits with Donald Trump. Is there any sign at this point -- 
 
JOE WALSH (R), FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE: Erica, you're -- 
 
HILL: Go ahead. 
 
WALSH: No, no, Erica, you're spot on. I was going to say, it's not just a delicate dance, it's an impossible dance. Look, I don't think most people sufficiently realize, in the media and outside of the media, that today's Republican Party is Marjorie Taylor Greene's party. It's not Nikki Haley's party. And, Erica, when I say that --
 
HILL: So it's not Donald Trump's, either? 
 
WALSH: When I say that I'm talking about the voters. Republican voters are much more aligned with Marjorie Taylor Greene than Nikki Haley. We forget that most Republicans today still -- still don't believe Joe Biden was legitimately elected. Most Republican voters don't believe the vaccines work. Most Republican voters don't have a problem with what happened on January 6th. In this kind of party, I don't see how someone like Nikki Haley has a shot. 
 
HILL: We'll be watching to see what plays out. 
 
We're doing a little rapid fire today, any friends, in case you notice. 
 
So, up next, let's talk a little immigration, if we could. 
 
House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, of course, was at the border yesterday. This is ahead of next week's House Judiciary hearing at the border. Democrats are calling that performative. They say it's a stunt. They're not going to go. But, instead, they're going to do their own trip next month, which, you know, may or may not be seen as performative in its own right, Maria. Why not go? 
 
CARDONA: Well, first and foremost, it's because it absolutely is theatrical. Kevin McCarthy is there solely to do and be a part of a photo op that will rile up the MAGA extremist base who have no interest -- 
 
HILL: But then why not go and be the bigger person, right? Why not, Maria, go to this hearing next week on the border and say, hey, we're going to be here and be the adults in the room?
 
WALSH: They should go, Erica. They should go.
 
CARDONA: Well, because what they're actually focusing on -- Hakeem Jeffries is actually there. He is at the border. He is actually focusing on an event that talk about the important relationship with Mexico. He is one of the ones that is talking about solutions. Other Democrats will be going to the border to talk about the real solutions that are there. I don't think any Democrat should be a part of this theatrical stunt that frankly puts front and center the message that Republicans want to put out there, which is that we should let no additional immigrants coming into this country. 
 
Let's be very clear about what Kevin McCarthy is doing. He is placating his MAGA extremist base with which he entered into a corrupt bargain to become speaker of the House and they are not interested in any kind of solution, Erica. If they were, they would start and focus on actual legislation, which is what Congress needs to do. As you know, they are the only ones who can really fix this. 
 
HILL: Right. 
 
CARDONA: And if you look at what Joe Biden and this White House have done, they have implemented measures that have reduced illegal crossings into this country. 
 
HILL: So, I'm going to have -
 
CARDONA: That's real focus on solution. 
 
HILL: We've got to -
 <br>[09:50:01]
 
CARDONA: Kevin McCarthy has no interest in doing that. 
 
HILL: I'm getting in a lot of trouble in my ear on time. 
 
Joe, you've got 15 seconds. 
 
WALSH: Erica, I'm with you, they should go. Yes, Republicans demagogue the border, but Democrats should go down there and present their ideas. It's an opportunity for them. 
 
HILL: We'll see what we hear from both sides on the border and, to Maria's point, what we actually see in terms of proposed legislation. 
 
Nice to see you both this morning. Thank you. 
 
WALSH: Thanks.
 
CARDONA: Thanks, Erica. 
 
SCIUTTO: You kept Joe Walsh to 15 seconds, Erica. Nicely done. That was some -
 
HILL: I mean, who knew it could happen? I'm impressed. 
 
SCIUTTO: That's a tough one. Lots to discuss. 
 
Another story we're following, Tesla recalls all cars with so-called full self-driving technology. Why government regulators say it is a danger on the roads. That's coming up. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
SCIUTTO: Tesla has now issued a major recall for, listen to this, more than 362,000 of its cars. This because of safety concerns over vehicles that have the full self-driving feature, which has had some problem for years. 
 
HILL: CNN chief business correspondent Christine Romans joining us now.
 
So that is a very large number for a recall.
 
CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes.
 <br>[09:55:03]
 
HILL: And just -- for me to understand, too, this was an optional feature, is that correct? 
 
ROMANS: That's right. 
 
HILL: So, people had to say, Oh, I want this on my car?
 
ROMANS: Yes. And a lot of people have it on their car.
 
HILL: Yes.
 
ROMANS: It cost $15,000. And it's basically a real world testing program. A beta program for this full self-driving - full self-driving beta software. 
 
And what it does essentially, it's a driver assist software. It is - navigates local roads and steering and braking and acceleration. It does require a human person, the driver of the car, to actually step in and take over at any moment. But what NHTSA, the federal regulator says, that there have been cases where the software has failed to go through, for example, a stale yellow light properly or has changed lanes improperly, and this could be a self-driving safety problem here. 
 
And so Tesla says it will recall these cars. Recall is a word that Elon Musk takes issue with. He says it's anachronistic that it's not like you're recalling your Ford in for a steering column change at the - at the dealer, right? This is going to be an over the air, OTA software update. So they are, in coming weeks, according to the government, Tesla will have a software update on these cars, some 300,000 of these cars, try to fix this - this problem.
 
HILL: So, can we say then it's a glaring red alert emoji, that there's an issue if you don't want it to be a recall (INAUDIBLE)?
 
ROMANS: I mean we call - we call things recalls when we're telling you - when the government is telling you that something may be unsafe.
 
HILL: Yes.
 
SCIUTTO: Right.
 
ROMANS: Even in rare circumstances we recall all kinds of different things. And that's what the government is saying in this case. And Tesla has agreed to this voluntary recall.
 
HILL: Yes.
 
ROMANS: OK, or emergency software update for safety reasons. Whatever you want to call it. It's an awful lot of cars here.
 
HILL: Christine, thank you.
 
SCIUTTO: Emergency software update for safety reasons sounds like it's necessary. 
 
ROMANS: It sounds like a recall. 
 
HILL: Just moments ago, Tyre Nichols -- the family of Tyre Nichols arriving at the courthouse. They are there as five police officers, former police officers, remember, they were fired, who now face multiple charges in his death, including murder. They are set to face arraignment. 
 
Stay with us. We'll bring that to you live, next.
