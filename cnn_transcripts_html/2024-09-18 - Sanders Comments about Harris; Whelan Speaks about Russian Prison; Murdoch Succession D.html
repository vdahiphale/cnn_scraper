JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN BUSINESS ANCHOR, "FIRST MOVE": Your rate's still going to be 24.9 percent. This is the most expensive way of borrowing money.
 
Next one, mortgages. We've already seen mortgages fall to, what 18- month lows. So, it is improving the situation already just by what they're saying. It doesn't help with the price of homes, of course. And that's the other kicker. 
 
Auto loans, super-expensive. We've seen prices on cars come down. But again, it will trickle in, but this depends on your credit history. It depends on what you're buying, of course, too. So, there's caveats all the way through.
 
The question is ultimately, I think, what they do and how much they can cut overall. And that's going to impact the cost of all of these things. 
 
SARA SIDNER, CNN ANCHOR: What advice would you give to consumers? 
 
CHATTERLEY: Great question. Savers, this is your moment. If you haven't locked in and you have some money to invest, invest now. CDs, for example. A savings loan. Because you can lock in a high rate. It's above inflation. 
 
Borrowers, you've got to shop around. Rates are going to come down. Watch the fees on all of the things that you're doing. 
 
And credit cards, don't necessarily go to the big banks. Look at some of the smaller institutions because they can offer better credit card rates. 
 
And think about consolidation as well. Perhaps a zero balance transfer. But watch the fees.
 
We'll see at 2:00 p.m.
 
SIDNER: The fees can kill you.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's really important.
 
SIDNER: They are really, really high. CHATTERLEY: Read the small print.
 
SIDNER: All right. Julia Chatterley with -
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes. Thank you.
 
SIDNER: With, you know, with some good news. I mean it could be quite good.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes. Well, hopefully - and that's important too, the sentiment impact today is really important beyond what comes next.
 
SIDNER: Yes.
 
CHATTERLEY: It's been four years of pain, hasn't it, for people.
 
SIDNER: It certainly has, the prices.
 
CHATTERLEY: High prices, high rates. Bring them down.
 
SIDNER: All right, Julia Chatterley, thank you so much.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes. Thank you.
 
SIDNER: Kate, over to you.
 
KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR: Republican Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders going after Kamala Harris apparently for not having any biological children. 
 
And Paul Whelan says that he counted each and every single day of the five and a half years that he spent detained in Russia. He's now speaking out about what he endured while also thanking the political leaders who helped get him home.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:36:40]
 
JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: New controversy this morning after comments made by the Republican governor of Arkansas, Sarah Huckabee Sanders. She was onstage with Donald Trump in Michigan.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOV. SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS (R-AR): So, my kids keep me humble. Unfortunately, Kamala Harris doesn't have anything keeping her humble. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BERMAN: Here now is Patti Solis Doyle, former campaign manager for Hillary Clinton, and Shermichael Singleton, CNN political commentator and Republican strategist.
 
Patti, first to you. This wasn't some radio interview that J.D. Vance did years ago. This
 
 was last night in Michigan, which makes you think it's a set piece, which makes you think its intentional. Why? 
 
PATTI SOLIS DOYLE, FORMER CAMPAIGN MANAGER, HILLARY CLINTON PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: I don't know why, honestly. Look, there's a huge gender gap in this election with Kamala Harris winning women voters by double digits, high double digits. So, you know, Sarah Huckabee Sanders' remarks were not only, in my view, not very nice, but not very smart. 
 
We have seen this childless cat lady meme out there in the zeitgeist, and it's not working for the Trump campaign at all. So, I don't know what she was thinking. I don't - it clearly was intentional. I don't know why women voters are going to decide this race in about seven states. And, like I said, it's going to be very, very close. So why they would alienate those voters is beyond me. 
 
And also one more thing. The name is Kamala, not Kamala. And I think she deserves the respect to pronounce her name correctly.
 
BERMAN: Shermichael, there are a lot of Republicans and independents out there without kids who I imagine can vote.
 
SHERMICHAEL SINGLETON, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Yes, look, I don't think this is helpful. I mean, you're in the state of Michigan. I think the messaging in that state should be about working-class voters. I think the messaging in the state of Michigan should be about the conflict between Israel and Hamas. A lot of voters there are concerned, particularly younger voters and Muslim voters. And so there's an opportunity, John, to articulate a message that could be compelling enough to mobilize and energized Republicans there. You need to maintain that. 
 
You also need to probably pull away at least five or 6 percent of the small percent of overall voters in the state that are sort of undecided. And I'm not certain that this is the message that's going to move them into your corner. At least let them stay home so there's not voting for your opponent. I don't think this helps. 
 
BERMAN: So, my friend, Peter Hamby, who writes for "Puck" and does stuff for Snapchat, has called this the Joe Rogan/Taylor Swift election. And Democrats online the last 24 hours have been circulating this clip of Joe Rogan in here his podcast where - it came after the debate. It was recorded the day after the debate. I think it first aired on Monday. He talks favorably about parts of Harris' debate performance, and also talks about what she's been like as a candidate. 
 
Listen to this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE ROGAN, HOST, "JOE ROGAN EXPERIENCE": I just want to say, whoever's helping her, whoever's coaching her -
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. ROGAN: Whoever's the puppet master running the strings -
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
 
ROGAN: You did a (EXPLETIVE DELETED) amazing job. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: She did a great job. 
 
ROGAN: They - they did an amazing job from the moment Biden drops out, forcing Biden to drop out. Right - whatever they're doing, whoever's writing those speeches -
 <br>[09:40:01]
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
 
ROGAN: Getting her to deliver them, coaching her -
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
 
ROGAN: She's nailing it. She nailed that one speech. She's like, say it to my face.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, yes, she's -
 
ROGAN: Everybody was cheering.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, they're - she nailed it, due.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BERMAN: Now to be clear, Shermichael, and Joe Rogan's not supporting Kamala Harris. I don't think he's coming out and supporting any candidate directly. But what kind of an impact do you think something like this has, particularly on younger male voters? 
 
SINGLETON: I mean, look, I think Joe Rogan can - can be objective. I'm a conservative. I can be objective and look at the way Democrats are running their - their campaign. I have a slew of differences in terms of policies and philosophy, right? 
 
But as a strategist, from an operational perspective, how quick they were able to consolidate, the maximum amount of dollars raised, how they have increased energy and they've increased the number of volunteers, those are all very positive things, whether you're a Republican or a Democrat. If you've ran a campaign, and Patti can also speak to this, I don't think there's a strategy that would say those are bad things.
 
In terms of the overall impact, I think this is sort of a signal to the former president that you're not running against Joe Biden. You're running against a formidable candidate. And if you're going to win this thing, then you are going to have to be disciplined in terms of your message and staying focused on what is most important and consequential to voters, particularly those who are not a part of the MAGA crowd, who the former president will need in order to get this thing across the finish line. 
 
BERMAN: Patti, what did you see there?
 
DOYLE: Well, I couldn't agree more. I couldn't agree more with Joe Rogan. I couldn't agree more with Shermichael.
 
Look, she has been flawless in my view. I have run campaigns, and she has been flawless in the nine weeks that she has been in this race. But I just want to make perfectly clear to all the voters out there, this is going to be incredibly, incredibly close. Excruciatingly close. 
 
And the - the real bottom line is to get those voters out to vote on Election Day and prior to Election Day with the mail-in vote and early voting happening as we speak. 
 
So, what's important is not just her external strategy, what she says, how she says it, where she goes, but what is happening on the ground. And, you know, we'll - we'll see how that works on - on November 5th.
 
SINGLETON: Yes, John, I mean -
 
BERMAN: Shermichael, you psyched that Donald Trump is going to the swing state of New York tonight? 
 
SINGLETON: Look, it's so funny you mentioned that because I was going to point on something that Patti said about early voting and staying on message. If I were advising the former president, I'm looking at a place like Pennsylvania. North Carolina, I think some of the data suggests, is now more of a competitive place. 
 
I'm figuring out where the competition is. I'm looking at 2016 numbers. I'm looking at 2020 numbers. I'm figuring out where some of the vice president's struggles are. And if I'm advising Trump, what is the message that I need to hone in on and hit over and over and over again to penetrate to, I think, the 16 percent of undecided in Pennsylvania, to say, I am a better option then my opponent.
 
Patti's right, this is going to be a very, very close race. Perhaps even closer than 2020. So, maybe you're looking at, John, a 2 percent marginal difference. And again, a state like Pennsylvania, that could make the difference. 
 
Both candidates are going to be fighting for that 2 percent. Can you make a convincing enough argument that you're the better option than the other person. People always say voters don't care about policy. I don't actually agree with that. The data suggests otherwise. And the person who provides the best solution in terms of policy to move the country forward is the person who, I believe, will ultimately win.
 
BERMAN: As they say, it all comes down to turnout and Long Island.
 
Patti Solis Doyle, Shermichael Singleton, thank you both very much.
 
Kate.
 
SINGLETON: Thanks, John.
 
BOLDUAN: I had heard that one before, I think. It was - yes. 
 
For the first time since his release, American Marine veteran Paul Whelan is revealing what happened in his final days in a Russian prison.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
PAUL WHELAN, FREED FROM RUSSIAN DETENTION AFTER FIVE PLUS YEARS: It was five years, seven months, and five days. I counted each one of them. You know, the last five days I was in solitary confinement. I couldn't leave my cell. But I made it home. I went toe to toe with them. They were probably glad to see me leave, to be quite honest. But, you know, here I am. And I'm starting a new chapter of my life.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOLDUAN: Whelan, who was wrongfully detained for five and a half years, was released last month, but really speaking publicly for the first time yesterday.
 
Joining us now is CNN's Jennifer Hansler. 
 
And to remind everyone, you have spoken to Paul Whelan numerous times over the years. Through phone calls you've been able to stay in touch. Some of our best reporting out of there has been coming from you, Jennifer.
 
What else is he saying now? 
 
JENNIFER HANSLER, CNN STATE DEPARTMENT REPORTER: Well, Kate, he said it is great to be back, but there is still a lot of work to be done. And he is focusing on what he called the minutia, things like getting a new car, readjusting to life with his parents after being in Russian detention for five and a half years.
 
Now, I asked him what the most surprising part of readjusting to his life here has been, and he said it is navigating the technology, just how much has changed over the years he was detained.
 <br>[09:45:08]
 
And part of why that's such an adjustment for him, he said, is because of how remote and how old, historic this prison camp he was held in. They were not really any technology there.  This is how he described it.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
PAUL WHELAN, FREED FROM RUSSIAN DETENTION AFTER FIVE PLUS YEARS: I was in a really remote part of Russia. You know, I used to call it camp lost in the woods. I mean it was really remote. We - we really didn't have much. The conditions were poor. The Russian said the poor conditions were part of the punishment. And, you know, coming back to see this sort of thing now is, you know, is a bit of a shock, but it's a good shot. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HANSLER: So, Whelan was up on Capitol Hill last night, Kate, to meet with lawmakers, thank those who had advocated for his release and to say thank you as well to the U.S. government officials who worked on that sweeping prisoner exchange, who - that brought him home. He said that part of how he was able to get through those years and those final days when he was in isolation was because he was brought up with this sense of resiliency from his parents who had lived in England during World War II. And he said that was instilled with him and it was something he put to work every single day. 
 
Now, Kate, from a personal note, as you said, I was able to speak with him a number of times when he was there in that prison camp. So, it was really quite a moment to be able to speak with him free on U.S. soil, Kate.
 
BOLDUAN: I can only imagine. It's great to see him and hear from him, and great for your - and great - and we are all grateful for your continued great reporting on this. Thank you.
 
Sara.
 
SIDNER: Jennifer has done an incredible job on that story. 
 
All right, life imitating arts perhaps. The battle for control of the Murdoch media empire. The drama is real. It's like watching a real- life episode of "Succession." But will it mean change is coming? We'll talk about it.
 
And, next hour, House Speaker Mike Johnson expected to speak while his latest proposal to fund the government is expected to fail. That's head too.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I know that we've said the worst things, but I just wanted to get a few things straight. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Dad said that it would be me. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If we want to hold onto this company, for us, we have to go into battle with our own version of the future with a king.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOLDUAN: It's HBO's "Succession" playing out in real life, really. A Rupert Murdoch family feud and a secret legal battle that could determine the future of his media empire. 
 
CNN's Brian Stelter is learning more about this. He's joining us now. Brian is also the author of "Network of Lies" about Fox News that is now out in paperback. 
 
Congrats on that, Brian.
 
BRIAN STELTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Thanks.
 
BOLDUAN: What is happening here? And what is going to happen this month in this Nevada courtroom? Like, bring us up to speed here.
 
STELTER: Yes. This is even more dramatic than HBO's "Succession" because this is a family been ripped apart over the terms of a trust that governs how the billions of dollars and the hearts of the Murdoch media empire are going to be split up in the future. 
 
Basically 25 years ago, Rupert Murdoch set up this family trust that said, in the event of his death, his four oldest children would each have a vote in the future of the companies. Of course, this company owns "The Wall Street Journal," Fox News, "The New York Post," and assets around the world. The idea was that the four children, together, would decide what to do with the family business. 
 
But now Rupert Murdoch is in court right now in Reno, Nevada, fighting all this week to blow up the trust that he created, to change the rules, and to put his oldest son, Lachlan, in charge. Essentially, Kate, he does not trust his other children to run the companies in the future. He only trusts his son, Lachlan. And so there's this crazy court battle now underway, completely in secret. The only thing we know about it is that we see the Murdochs walking in and out of court every day for these hearings. 
 
BOLDUAN: Well, or maybe he doesn't trust is - the other children to run the empire the way he wants. 
 
What could this mean for his media empire?
 
STELTER: That's right, the way he wants. 
 
I report in this updated version of "Network of Lies," that James Murdoch, the more liberal, younger son, has detailed plans for making Fox News more moderate. In James' view, Fox News, as it stands today, is poisonous, spreading pro-Trump propaganda and misinforming the country. James wants to make Fox News more moderate. He had a plan, or has a plan, to do so, but he would need the support of his sisters. In other words, if there's four votes, it will be three against one, and he could take over Fox News after his dad dies. 
 
That seems to be what Rupert Murdoch is trying to stop. That seems to be what this court battle is all about. The Rupert Murdoch camp says that this battle is about ensuring that Lachlan can take care of the best interests of all of the family members, making sure everybody stays rich and wealthy and becomes - becomes - stays billionaires. But for - from James Murdoch's point of view, this is all political. So, in other words, Kate, it's both political and personal at the same time. 
 
BOLDUAN: Yes, I mean this is a business story and a media story, and also a story about a family. I mean what if - what - you've done so much reporting on this. What could this mean for this family?
 
STELTER: Well, I mentioned James and Lachlan, the two brothers, they've not spoken in years. These two men used to work together running the family business. Now, they're estranged. Rupert Murdoch got married again earlier this year, and the three kids who are fighting him in court didn't come to the wedding. So, on one level, there's a personal heartbreak here about a 93-year-old father going to war with his children who won't speak with him, or vice versa. 
 <br>[09:55:05]
 
But then, on the political level, what happens to Fox News and what happens to "The Wall Street Journal" affects everyone. That's, by the way, why the nation's other media outlets are trying to go to court to fight to get access to this hearing because whatever a probate judge in Reno, Nevada, decides could affect these media companies, not just for years to come, but for decades to come.
 
BOLDUAN: Absolutely. Ryan, great reporting. Thank you very much. Much more to come on that one for sure. 
 
STELTER: We'll see.
 
SIDNER: And thank you for joining us. This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL with John Berman, Kate Bolduan, and me. 
 
"CNN NEWSROOM," up next.
