DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR: A new study released moments ago suggesting that your lack of sleep, or anonymous (ph) collectively on this show -
 
KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN ANCHOR: Bad news for us.
 
LEMON: Could be affecting our heart health. Dr. Sanjay Gupta here to explain. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR: Do you know what that white stuff is? Oh, well, now you can't see it. All right, Hollywood certainly has a lot of stars, but the West Coast is on alert for lots of snow over the next 48 hours. You're looking at a light dusting of snow on the Hollywood sign as southern California braces for a rare blizzard. Up to 7 feet of snow expected in some areas out west. CNN will keep you updated on this storm. 
 
LEMON: Yes. I mean -- 
 
COLLINS: No way the Minnesota girl thinks that's snow. 
 
LEMON: Yes.
 
HARLOW: I just think it's so funny! Yes, all things are -
 
COLLINS: Poppy's like, please.
 
HARLOW: All things are relative. 
 
LEMON: Call me when L.A. gets 7 inches of snow, right?
 
HARLOW: Yes, right.
 
LEMON: That would be amazing. 
 
COLLINS: Yes.
 
LEMON: I want to see that. Well, not really. We don't want to see that. People in L.A. are like, no, Don, we don't. 
 
So, if you are having trouble sleeping, right, this may be the last thing you'll want to hear, but it could help save your life. A study released moments ago finds that people with insomnia are at greater risk of having a heart attack. 
 <br>[08:35:00]
 
So, our very own chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, is here to discuss. 
 
Good morning to you. 
 
Let's talk about the findings here. 
 
DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Good morning.
 
LEMON: How big of a link did this study find between insomnia and cardiovascular disease, Sanjay? 
 
GUPTA: I've got to say, first of all, I love doing these kinds of stories with morning anchors. 
 
HARLOW: Oh.
 
LEMON: We're probably like -- 
 
GUPTA: I know how much of a premium sleep is for you. So, just, you know, when you listen to this, you got to remember this is an association study. So they found that people who had insomnia did have a greater risk of different things, including cardiovascular disease. But it could be people who have insomnia have other issues as well. Just keep that in mind.
 
They also defined insomnia, first of all, very specifically, as people who had difficulty initiating sleep, people who had difficulty maintaining sleep and people who they would wake up and then have difficulty going back to sleep. So, just keep that in the mind of your mind in terms of what insomnia specifically is. 
 
This was a significant study in terms of size. And I think that's why it's getting attention. More than a million people, several countries around the world, looked at insomniacs, looked at people who did not have insomnia, and said, what is the likelihood of having a heart attack. It's low in both cases here. To be clear, 1.6 percent versus 1.2 percent. But that is a significantly higher number in the insomniacs, of having these trouble with heart problems. So, I think that's what got the researchers' attention and that's what's going to probe them to sort of figure out what they can do about this, what they can advise. 
 
LEMON: Can I just follow up with Sanjay, please.
 
Sanjay, I'm being totally serious here, I got everything you just described is me. That's me on this shift. 
 
GUPTA: I can imagine, Don. And you, obviously, had a significant shift from your schedule before to the schedule now.
 
LEMON: The total opposite. 
 
GUPTA: And, you know, if you look at overall in the world, at any given time, about one in two people say that they suffer from short- term insomnia. About one in ten people say they have long term insomnia, chronic insomnia. So, it's a significant problem. 
 
And I do think that a lot of this has to do with the fact that as we, as humans, have moved further and further indoors and are getting less natural light on our faces and in our eyes and that opportunity to reset our body clock on a regular basis, our circadian rhythm, it's really just thrown off our sleep schedules. We've known this for some time. We've down it's probably a problem. But now the studies are coming out to sort of show that, you know, how significant a problem it is. 
 
And, by the way, less than five hours of sleep, problematic, but also greater than nine hours could be problematic. So, there is a sweet spot here. It's not necessarily that more is better. 
 
HARLOW: Is there a difference, Sanjay, between insomnia and just not having enough hours to sleep? Like --
 
GUPTA: Yes. 
 
HARLOW: Go ahead. 
 
GUPTA: Yes, there is. And that's a really - it's a really important point because they're -- when they defined insomniacs, they specifically said that it was this difficulty where people might have disturbances in sleep patterns throughout the night. They may be in bed for a long period of time, but in terms of actually defining the number of hours of sleep where the absolute number of hours of sleep where it became problematic it was less than five hours. As you've heard, we've long heard, seven to eight hours is probably that sweet spot. But when you saw the greatest increase in health problems overall, it's when people were getting fewer than five hours on a regular basis. 
 
LEMON: Oh, man. 
 
COLLINS: Don just volunteered to be a case study for your next investigation into this.
 
LEMON: I'm serious. I could be. Seriously, though, I could. 
 
HARLOW: Yes.
 
LEMON: I could.
 
COLLINS: It's a real - it's a real thing that people have. And, you know, my little sister was - we were talking about this recently, she struggles with this. And we were talking about, should she get a weighted blanket, should she do this, should she read before bed? You know, if you do have this, Sanjay, what do you do if you have insomnia? GUPTA: Yes, I think that this is - this is really interesting. I mean,
 
 you know, there's all sorts of different sleep recommendations that people have heard certainly over the years. Make sure you have good sleep hygiene. You know, not using devices before you go to bed. Keep the room cool and dark. Having that sleep schedule. 
 
I think the middle point here, getting enough natural light during the day, Kaitlan, I think is a really important one. We spend so much of our lives indoors now and surrounded by artificial light. And I think what we are seeing, as I mentioned earlier, is how -- just how disruptive that is to our circadian rhythms overall. If you get outside and you get outside at the time of day when it's light, so you're actually exposing your eyes first thing in the morning to natural light and making sure you get as much natural light throughout the day as possible, as the light changes throughout the day, the impact of that light on your body and brain should change throughout the day as well, that's what probably is the most important in terms of getting your clock, your circadian clock, on rhythm and, you know, best beating your chance of having insomnia. 
 
LEMON: Yes. 
 
HARLOW: Good advice. 
 
LEMON: I'm serious. I am going to talk to you after this because on this schedule, sometimes I can barely form a sentence. It's - it's crazy.
 
HARLOW: I'm going to buy you a weighted blanket. 
 
LEMON: I have a -- I have two weighted blankets. 
 
HARLOW: You do? 
 
LEMON: Yes, I do. 
 
HARLOW: Oh, my gosh.
 
LEMON: I've tried everything. But it's really -- this schedule, I -- that has just -- 
 <br>[08:40:02]
 
HARLOW: A friend told me last night, Sanjay, transcendental meditation. 
 
LEMON: I've done that. I still do it. 
 
HARLOW: All right, I'm going to keep coming up with ideas. 
 
Dr. Sanjay Gupta.
 
GUPTA: Don's tried it all. 
 
HARLOW: Thank you.
 
GUPTA: All right, Don, give me a call. I've got a few other suggestions for you. 
 
COLLINS: Got a medical mystery on our hands. 
 
LEMON: Thanks, Sanjay.
 
COLLINS: Thanks, Sanjay.
 
HARLOW: Just in, a key consumer spending report is out. It is how the Fed -- the questions is, how will the Fed gauge this inflation number. We'll tell you about them, next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HARLOW: All right, just in, a key consumer spending report just released. It is the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation. 
 
Chief business correspondent Christie Romans is here sighing. 
 
LEMON: Oh, my gosh, what is that sigh for?
 
HARLOW: Sighing for us on a Friday morning.
 
CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Deep sigh. Well, 5.4 percent was the inflation gauge on this PCE index. And that's hotter than we had expected. And it's the first time we've seen it tick up in quite a few months here. So, overall inflation, 5.4 percent. Still far away from the Fed's desired 2 percent. 
 
LEMON: Oh.
 
ROMANS: You see that little uptick. I just don't like that. I liked the curve. I liked the idea that we were peaking. And, by the way, futures don't like it either. The stock market and futures are down. 
 <br>[08:45:01]
 
Month to month, if we go back to that first screen, you would see inflation rose 0.6 percent month to month. 
 
We expected 0.4 percent. That compares with only 0.2 percent last month. So, as you know, the trend is what's important. This is just one month. But the trend here, this sort of broke the trend that we had seen peaking inflation. 
 
LEMON: You just answered my question, is it a trend overall?
 
ROMANS: It's not a trend overall. It's just one kind of icky (INAUDIBLE).
 
LEMON: No, I meant going down overall. Yes.
 
ROMANS: Yes, the trend has been peaking, but still we're far away from that - from that 2 percent. And that's what the Fed wants to see. 
 
HARLOW: Speaking of the Fed, I thought it was interesting that Jamie Dimon, obviously, head of JP Morgan Chase - ROMANS: Yes.
 
HARLOW: Said yesterday on CNBC, I have all the respect for Powell, the Fed chair, but then he said, we lost a little bit of control of inflation. 
 
Does that worry you to hear someone like Jamie Dimon think -
 
ROMANS: Well, Jamie Dimon is -- his business is to be worried about bad things that are going to happen, right? And you remember he talked about a hurricane was coming way earlier last year and he's been worried about a recession for some time. 
 
I think that that has been the risk and the concern broadly, even inside the Fed, that inflation, once it gets out of control, it is really hard to get it back in the bottle. That's why the Fed has raised interest rates so many times so quickly and by so much, they're trying to get this under control. 
 
COLLINS: Can you just remind us why 2 percent is the goal. Why did they settle on 2 percent?
 
ROMANS: Two percent is the goal internally. A lot of central banks use as their goal. That's where inflation is healthy. A little bit of price increases are healthy in an economy. Deflation is not. So, a little bit of inflation. And you want to have a strong job market. We still have a very strong job market. That spins off more inflation, by the way, and higher wages. 
 
HARLOW: Yes. 
 
COLLINS: Right.
 
HARLOW: That's right.
 
ROMANS: So, look, the Fed's got a really hard job, and this is just another data point that shows that. 
 
LEMON: It's your job to worry too. Not just Jamie Dimon.
 
HARLOW: She worries in size (ph) for us.
 
LEMON: You worry about everything.
 
ROMANS: I am rainbows and unicorns. It is Friday. 
 
HARLOW: Thank you, Romans, very much. 
 
COLLINS: Christine "inflation" Romans.
 
All right, alcohol sales have slipped over the past two years. More people are thirsting for boozeless beer. Maybe one person at this table. Why is this morning's number 153? Harry Enten is here with alcohol-free beer to tell us why, next. 
 
LEMON: That's Harry's age. That's why. HARLOW: I bet you get carded all the time.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[08:51:18]
 
LEMON: We're just talking about beer in the studio. 
 
So, are you ready for your big Friday night. Maybe leave the beer at home. More people are becoming sober curious, and the companies behind your favorite booze are really taking notice of this. 
 
Here, our senior data reporter, Harry - Harry Enten. 
 
So, what is this number and what is this beer? What - what?
 
HARRY ENTEN, CNN SENIOR DATA REPORTER: OK. So this morning's number is, 153 percent. So, non-alcoholic beer searches on Google this January and February are up 153 percent from 2018 and up, 27 percent from 2022. And I know I hit on something when everybody in the studio was so interested in this topic. People actually think that this stuff tastes pretty good. But --
 
LEMON: Yes. I do. I drank this during Covid, in fact. 
 
ENTEN: Here you go.
 
LEMON: This is the only thing that I got close to alcohol with this. 
 
ENTEN: Right. But the problem is, is you don't actually feel anything and you just gain the calorie count. 
 
LEMON: Yes.
 
ENTEN: But I think what's so interesting about what's going on here is, we're talking about, you know, non-alcoholic searches going up. Take a look here at alcoholic drinks in 2022. Take a look at the sales. Look, low in non-alcoholic beverages still trail well behind all alcoholic beverages, $188 billion to $2.5 billion in sales. 
 
But look here. Look at the change from 2021. The all-alcohol category, down 1 percent. The low and non-alcoholic, this is what I'm interested in, look at this growth level, it's up 25 percent, Don. So, this is what's being reflected in those Google searches. 
 
Right now, look, the all-alcoholic market is still the dominant market, but the fact is people are getting more and more interested in these low and non-alcoholic alternatives. 
 
LEMON: I don't think you should be surprised. I mean if the -- start at the bottom, if it's low, of course it's -- there's nowhere to go but up. 
 
ENTEN: That is true. There is nowhere to go but up.
 
But here's what I would point out is, I do think there is this idea among alcoholic drinkers, because I'm always interested in the why, right? Why is it that non-alcoholic beverages are starting to go up, starting to become a larger share of the market? And I think we get an idea here. Alcohol has a negative effect on society at large and most people who drink. This is among alcohol drinkers. This is among alcohol drinkers. This is not people like me who don't really drink a lot of alcohol. Look at - look at this, 71 percent of society at large say alcohol has a negative effect. And look at this, most people who - most people who drink alcohol, they believe -- 65 percent of alcohol drinkers believe it has a negative effect on them. 
 
LEMON: I think that they should look at also the use of other things now, like marijuana is becoming legal. 
 
ENTEN: Yes.
 
LEMON: They're microdosing or what have you. And sometimes people just want the taste of it when they're already using a substance that can help them relax or (INAUDIBLE). 
 
ENTEN: I think that can definitely be true, Don. 
 
LEMON: Yes, thank you, Harry Enten. 
 
ENTEN: Thank you.
 
LEMON: All right, don't drink this.
 
ENTEN: I'm going to -
 
COLLINS: All right, well, here's some news that might drive you to drink. One of HBO's hit shows is reportedly coming to an end.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is not about getting back at dad. But if it hurts him, it doesn't bother me. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COLLINS: The show "Succession." The creator and show writer, Jessie Armstrong, has now told "The New Yorker" that season four of the Emmy Award winning drama, which premiers in March, will be its final season. Armstrong says, quote, he never thought this show could on forever and he wants it to go out strong. Before you get your hopes up, the FBO (ph) chief, Kacey Boy (ph), says it is unlikely there will be a spinoff of "Succession." Season four returns on March 26th. I can't wait for it, but I'm - I'm - you always want your favorite shows to end in a really great way, but you also just never want them to end. 
 
LEMON: Not a spinoff, but lots of copies on other networks trying to do what "Succession" did. 
 
HARLOW: I love that show. 
 
We'll be right - we'll be right back. COLLINS: Such a good show. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[08:59:07]
 
COLLINS: All right, now to today's "Morning Moment." 
 
One of the victims of the Michigan State campus shooting got quite the surprise from his hospital bed when he received a call from his favorite NBA player, Philadelphia 76ers James Harden chatted with John Hao on Facetime.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOHN HAO: Hi. (INAUDIBLE).
 
JAMES HARDEN: (INAUDIBLE). How are you?
 
HAO: Good. Good.
 
HARDEN: Everything will work itself out, you're strong. You're all right. You're going to be all right, I promise you are.
 
HAO: (INAUDIBLE).
 
HARDEN: I love when you're smiling too. I love when you're smiling.
 
I know it's tough right now. You've just got to - you've got to stay physically strong. You know what I mean. You've got to just - you've got to think positive things and just keep pushing. You've got to keep fighting.
 
HAO: For sure.
 
HARDEN: I got you.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COLLINS: A lovely moment in such a difficult time. John's spinal cord was severed, paralyzing him from the chest down. 
 <br>[09:00:03]
 
Harden send him some game-worn sneakers, donated to his Go Fund Me to also help pay for his medical bills. Just a nice moment. A time when there's not a lot. 
 
LEMON: What do they say at Michigan State, go green, go white, for Adrienne who is an alum there says, go green, and then you're supposed to respond, go white.
 
HARLOW: There's good news in the world. There's a lot of good news in the world.
 
LEMON: Yes. COLLINS: Maybe (ph).
 
HARLOW: Glad we could share that. OK.
 
LEMON: Glad we could share our week with you as well. Make sure you -
 
COLLINS: Yes, thanks for joining us.
 
LEMON: Have yourself a great weekend. We'll see you next week.
 
COLLINS: All right, CNN "NEWSROOM" starts right now.</pre>
