ANNOUNCER:  Live from CNN Abu Dhabi, this is CONNECT THE WORLD with Becky Anderson. 
 
BECKY ANDERSON, CNN HOST (voice-over):  And welcome to our second hour of the show. I'm Becky Anderson in Abu Dhabi for you. 
 
Happening this hour, the U.S. secretary of state working with a real sense of urgency to try and bring a pause in violence in Gaza, wrapping up a 
 
 meeting with the Qatari prime minister, any moment now and with a member of the Israeli war cabinet later.
 
It's the second busiest day on the U.S. political calendar and a day of huge significance for Donald Trump and Nikki Haley. We will learn some 
 
 interesting lessons by the close of polls in 16 states and one U.S. territory. 
 
Ukraine's military is claiming another successful attack on a Russian warship with their supplies getting tight on the front line. 
 
And the U.S. Defense Secretary is set to host is Lithuanian counterpart this hour as they look to extend support in the fight against Russia.
 
(MUSIC PLAYING)
 
ANDERSON:  With Ramadan just days away, Egypt says talks in Cairo and pausing the war between Israel and Hamas aren't there yet. 
 
Egyptian media reports difficulties in the discussions. In Washington, America's top diplomat, Antony Blinken, sitting down with Qatar's prime 
 
 minister at what is a crucial juncture. Next hour, Blinken will meet with Israeli official Benny Gantz. 
 
Desperate conditions in Gaza adding to the urgency for a deal. More food was dropped into the territory today. Gaza officials report nearly 100 more 
 
 people killed overnight. Israel says it killed about 20 of what it calls "terrorists" and destroyed the largest tunnel it has found so far, it says. 
 
CNN's Alex Marquardt as monitoring this flurry of diplomacy and he joins me now. 
 
Let's start with what we are hearing out of Washington, Alex. 
 
ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  Well, a big day in Washington. We have these meetings at the State Department with both, as 
 
 you noted, the Qatari prime minister and Benny Gantz, a member of the Israeli war cabinet. 
 
And make no mistake, a focal point for these conversations, both of them, will be the need for a ceasefire, which the U.S. has really seen as the key 
 
 to unlocking so many other components of this conflict; notably, ending this conflict and getting to discuss the day-after scenarios, as they're 
 
 being called.
 
But also getting humanitarian aid into Gaza. And the U.S. is kind of coming at this front from two angles, saying, yes, a ceasefire is absolutely 
 
 needed. But absent of a ceasefire, there is still a need for Israel to allow more aid into Gaza and for that aid to get to where it needs to be. 
 
So the secretary of state having this meeting this morning with his Qatari counterpart. This is what's called the strategic dialogue. It's the sixth 
 
 annual iteration of this dialogue. So it would be happening even if this war wasn't going on. 
 
But, Becky, this is certainly going to be at the at the top of the agenda. The Qataris have been at the very center of mediating this potential 
 
 ceasefire, which, as you say, both the U.S., Qatar, Egypt and others would like to see in place before Ramadan, which is expected to begin early next 
 
 week. 
 
And then later, the secretary of state meeting with Benny Gantz. This was a series of meetings at the -- this rival of Netanyahu's, is taking here in 
 
 Washington, which, according to Israeli media, has enraged the Israeli prime minister. 
 
The Biden administration essentially the rolling out the red carpet for him, giving him meetings with everybody except for the president, the vice 
 
 president, the national security adviser and the secretary of state.
 
The Biden administration making no excuses for that, saying this is a war. He is a member of the war cabinet. We need to talk to him about these two 
 
 major issues, the ceasefire and the need for more aid in Gaza. 
 
ANDERSON:  Much talk that these conversations with Benny Gantz might be about how to move on from a Benjamin Netanyahu-run government, correct?
 
MARQUARDT:  Well, there's certainly -- the conversations that I've been having with U.S. officials and others, there certainly is a sense that, if 
 
 there were a pause that were put in place, that would allow for what is expected to be in Israel a real moment of reckoning, questions over what 
 
 happened. 
 <br>[10:05:02]
 
And why Israel wasn't kept safe and the possibility of the Netanyahu coalition essentially falling apart. And Benny Gantz is certainly there, 
 
 ready to take up the mantle of prime minister. And this is why Netanyahu was apparently so angry about the treatment that he is getting in 
 
 Washington. 
 
Certainly the U.S. does not want to be seen in any way as meddling in Israeli politics. So what they're arguing here is that he is a valuable 
 
 person to speak with in this moment with such critical issues. 
 
One thing I should note is that, when Gantz is going to these meetings, he is not being supported by the embassy here in Washington. The Israeli 
 
 ambassador, Michael Herzog, is not going with him, as would be customary for when other senior officials are visiting. 
 
And that is evidence, Becky, I think of the fact that this is -- this is something that Netanyahu does not want him to be doing. Becky. 
 
ANDERSON:  On the potential for a cease-fire, Kamala Harris this week, the V.P. in the States, said, quite categorically, we need to see an immediate 
 
 cease-fire, by which she means a temporary pause. 
 
Let's be quite clear about that, an immediate, permanent ceasefire is what is being called by -- for by so many people, not least in the region where 
 
 I am. 
 
These talks have been ongoing, of course, in Cairo, as you rightly pointed out. And the U.S. secretary of state speaking with the Qatari prime 
 
 minister, meeting with him in Washington, a key mediator in these talks. 
 
This is what Egypt's prime minister said earlier, quote, "I do not want to say whether there is optimism or pessimism. We have not yet reached a point 
 
 where, through it, we could achieve a ceasefire. 
 
"The Americans have been pushing very hard to get a temporary pause in place before Ramadan, March the 10th, there or thereabouts Sunday into 
 
 Monday this week." 
 
That statement from the Egyptian foreign minister does not sound particularly optimistic. Alex. 
 
MARQUARDT:  And on top of that, Becky, we heard today, from Egyptian state media, which is essentially a mouthpiece for the Sisi regime. And they said 
 
 that there are difficulties in these talks but that talks are continuing. 
 
The U.S., from their perspective, is saying that Israel has essentially agreed to the broad framework of a ceasefire. And they are very much 
 
 putting the ball in Hamas' court. 
 
There was an interesting comment to CNN from a senior Hamas official, in which Bassan Ayim (ph) said that there is no way to know the fate of the 
 
 Israeli hostages held in Gaza except after agreeing to a ceasefire and starting its implementation. 
 
And Becky, that is a reference to this demand that we have reported on, that Israel is now making, that they want a list of the hostages who are 
 
 still alive and those who are dead in Gaza before a ceasefire can happen. 
 
And here we have Hamas saying, well, we can't give you that list until a ceasefire happens. To what extent this is a sticking point or an impasse, 
 
 that remains to be seen. Clearly, the mediators still working feverishly to try to get this deal done. 
 
ANDERSON:  Good to have you, Alex. Thank you. 
 
Well, brand new findings from the United Nations show that there are, and I quote here, "reasonable grounds to believe that rape was committed during 
 
 Hamas' October the 7th attacks," a claim the militant group has repeatedly denied. 
 
It comes after a U.N. team visited Israel for several weeks to hold meetings and conduct interviews. 
 
Now the group also found, quote, "clear and convincing information" that hostages held in Gaza were sexually abused. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
PRAMILA PATTEN, SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE OF THE U.N. SECRETARY-GENERAL ON SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN CONFLICT:  We found clear and convincing information 
 
 that sexual violence, including rape; sexualized torture; cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment has been committed against captives. 
 
And we also have reasonable grounds to believe that such violence may still be ongoing against those still held in captivity. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON:  Well, that's the U.N. special envoy who led the team. She says they also heard accounts of abuse of Palestinians in detention.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
PATTEN:  Information about cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment of Palestinians, men and women, in detention, also under the administrative 
 
 detention, including sexual violence in the forms of invasive body searches, threats of rape and prolonged forced nudity.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[10:10:07]
 
ANDERSON:  Ruth Halperin-Kaddari joins us now. She is an expert on international women's rights, a founding director of The Rackman Center for 
 
 the advancement of the status of women and a professor of law at Bar-Ilan University in Israel. 
 
Thanks for joining us. 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
ANDERSON:  -- of the report, as laid out at the U.N. by the special envoy sent to Israel, to build this report after days of investigation. 
 
RUTH HALPERIN-KADDARI, THE RACKMAN CENTER:  I welcome the report. I believe that the special envoy, Ms. Pramila Patten, the special representative of 
 
 the secretary-general, did an incredible job, here together with her team. 
 
They spent more than two weeks in Israel. Her team stayed for 10 more days. And they were on a mission of a fact-finding, not an investigation. 
 
But what they found confirms what we had been saying and what, I, for example, had known for many weeks now, of mounting evidence, testimonies, 
 
 indications, photographs, footage that clearly show that sexual violence has definitely been part of the Hamas massacre on Israel on October 7. 
 
And I believe that, after this report, it will no longer be possible for anybody to deny that it actually happened. 
 
ANDERSON:  The president, Isaac Herzog, earlier, in response to this report, tweeting, and I quote, "The world must now react strongly by 
 
 condemning and punishing Hamas. We must all continue our relentless efforts to bring all the hostages home to their families." 
 
As we can learn from the report, they are constantly under clear and present danger, underscoring, as so many sort of key stakeholders are now 
 
 on Gaza, that a pause is necessary or, at least from Isaac Herzog's position, the release of these hostages is absolutely paramount. 
 
Of course that is tied up in, at this point, a cease-fire, be that temporary or, as Hamas and many people in the region I'm in, would suggest 
 
 is a permanent cease-fire. 
 
What's your -- what's your position on this?
 
HALPERIN-KADDARI:  I think that, now that we have confirmation that the hostages who are still alive in Gaza are subjected to ongoing sexual 
 
 violence, the calls should be for an immediate and unconditional release. 
 
And it should not be tied to any demand for a cease-fire, although I personally think -- but here I'm speaking, of course, not as a spokesperson 
 
 for anybody -- I believe that anything and everything should be done to release them. 
 
But for anybody who has any shred of morality and humanity, to know that sexual violence is still being ongoing while they are in captivity, should 
 
 lead to demand of an immediate release or, at least, at the beginning, to have them accessed to for the Red Cross.
 
To have access to them to know that they are alive, that they are being taken care of, that medicine can be brought to them, that they are safe 
 
 from any kind of violence. I think this is an abhorrent situation, where the hostages are simply being played with by Hamas on the other side of the 
 
 conflict. And --
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
HALPERIN-KADDARI:  -- end to that. 
 
ANDERSON:  And you've said that this is in your personal capacity. And you've given us your response to the report in your professional capacity. 
 <br>[10:15:00]
 
And I just want to get back to that as an expert on international women's rights and the founding director of The Rackman Center for the advancement 
 
 of the status on women. I want to get your response to the U.N. special envoy, who led the team, also saying that her team heard accounts of abuse 
 
 of Palestinians in detention. Again, your response. 
 
HALPERIN-KADDARI:  I emphasize the fact that, when it relates to allegations of Palestinians against IDF soldiers, the team, as far as I 
 
 understand it -- and they explained it in the report and Ms. Patten also explained it in the press conference yesterday -- the team did not do any 
 
 fact-finding measures in that respect. 
 
They only report on what they heard. And there are other U.N. entities that are responsible for conducting, for verifying such allegations. 
 
This had not been part of the fact-finding mission of the special representative. All the accounts of sexual allegations -- sorry, sexual 
 
 violence and gender atrocities that were committed by Hamas and by other terrorist groups on October 7 had been verified to the extent that it is 
 
 recounted in the report. 
 
So we have to differentiate between these two sides. They are not parallel. 
 
ANDERSON:  I assume that you will also encourage the opportunity for a fact-finding mission and an investigation into the allegations on the other 
 
 side.  And I don't want to get into what-aboutism here
 
But allegations need to be investigated, of Palestinians being sexually abused in detention, correct?
 
HALPERIN-KADDARI:  I have no disagreement on that. Allegations should be looked into. And Israel is also conducting its own investigations whenever 
 
 allegations of improper behavior, including possible sexual violence, is being brought against IDF personnel. 
 
As far as I know, the Israeli authorities are investigating that. And there are, again, other entities on the ground that are looking into that. 
 
But I would like to refer here also to, if I may, to other allegations that had been brought by the special representative on Palestine, occupied 
 
 Palestinian Territories. And the special representative on sexual violence against women, in a statement released about 10 days ago, that had been 
 
 completely unreferenced. 
 
And only mentioning reports that they received but without any reference to sources of the reports. And I think this is very serious blaming without 
 
 saying any reference on what they rely on. 
 
But again, any such claims should be investigated separately. 
 
ANDERSON:  Ruth, important to have you on. Thank you very much, indeed, for your perspective. Thank you. 
 
Well, it's the biggest and arguably most impactful day in U.S. politics outside of Election Day in November. And some big questions could be 
 
 answered on Super Tuesday, as it's known. 
 
Primaries and caucuses are happening in 16 states and one U.S. territory. The results expected to move both President Biden and Donald Trump very 
 
 close to clinching their parties' respective nominations. 
 
By the time the votes are counted, Democrats could know if momentum from that undecided protest vote in last week's Michigan primary fizzles out or 
 
 spreads further. 
 
And Republicans will be looking closely to see how Nikki Haley fares with Republicans and some independents, who insist they won't vote for Trump. 
 
 And if she'll exit the race after today. 
 
It's important to note that, while millions of people will vote today, the actual percentage of eligible voters casting ballots is small, giving them 
 
 outsized power in deciding their party's presidential nominees. Stephanie Elam, back with us from California. 
 
Where the polls, Stephanie, as I understand it, opened just minutes ago. 
 
What's the view from there? 
 
Traditionally, let's remind our viewers, one of the bluest states in the presidential race. 
 <br>[10:20:05]
 
STEPHANIE ELAM, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, for sure, Becky, this is a Democratic stronghold for sure. California is known to almost always go 
 
 Democratic. And that is not expected to change today at all. 
 
But what we are seeing, the polls have been opened now for close to 20 minutes here in California. And we're seeing people trickle in. People have 
 
 been dropping off their ballots. A lot of people have been able to vote by mail for a few weeks here. 
 
But some people wanting to do it in person here today. 
 
And what is at stake here besides the presidential election?
 
Obviously this primary about whether or not people want Biden and Trump to go all the way here. The other really consequential vote here in California 
 
 is for Senate. And that is because Senator Dianne Feinstein passed away in September. And so that open seat is what we see three U.S. representatives 
 
 vying for today. 
 
That would be Adam Schiff, Katie Porter and Barbara Lee. Those three U.S. representatives going for that position, which I should note, Adam Schiff 
 
 is the faraway front-runner for that role right now, simply because he has had an outsized role, you could say, in the first impeachment of Donald 
 
 Trump. 
 
And also, he's got some name recognition and a lot of support broadly from the party here in California. 
 
On the Republican side there's Steve Garvey. It's a name that people may know less but he is known for his sports acumen. He was a baseball player 
 
 for the Los Angeles Dodgers and well as the San Diego Padres here. 
 
Now we've seen Schiff really spend some money going after Garvey. And he is trying to do that, because, in California, the top two candidates that win 
 
 today, no matter their political party, go on to that run-off vote in November. So he's hoping to make it, Democrat versus Republican. 
 
Because California Dems outweigh Republicans 2:1 here. So that's what is at stake here. Like you said, a lot of people don't come out for the 
 
 primaries. So that's going to put a lot of emphasis on who the people who do vote, who we see, come November, Becky. 
 
ANDERSON:  Stephanie Elam on the story for you. Thank you. 
 
Well, Super Tuesday is the biggest multi-state primary election so far this year in the United States, with more than a third of all Republican and 
 
 Democratic delegates at stake. Our indepth coverage begins at 06:00 pm on the U.S. East Coast. That is early Wednesday morning here in Abu Dhabi. 
 
Still ahead, a closer look at an important issue that could affect a lot of Americans' votes in the primaries and in November and that is immigration. 
 
 If Texas is allowed its own immigration enforcement state, a law every state might enact one. 
 
That's one reason why the U.S. Supreme Court paused a new controversial law from taking effect. Details on that are straight ahead.
 
(MUSIC PLAYING)
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:25:00]
 
(MUSIC PLAYING)
 
ANDERSON:  The U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily put a freeze on a controversial Texas immigration law that was scheduled to go into effect 
 
 just days from now. 
 
This is the latest effort by the state's Republican governor to clash with the White House over immigration. Now the law would allow Texas to arrest 
 
 and detain people they suspect of coming into the country illegally. 
 
Immigration advocates say it would lead to racial profiling and could lead to states creating their own migration policies, which is the domain in the 
 
 United States of the federal government. Let's get you to CNN's Rosa Flores, who is live for us in Houston -- Rosa. 
 
I've given a background there, some context. 
 
So what happens now? 
 
ROSA FLORES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, now we wait, because the U.S. Supreme Court will be taking on this case. But let me get you up to speed 
 
 as to how we got here because we got here very quickly in U.S. terms when it comes to cases going through courts in the United States. 
 
Over the weekend, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals granted the state of Texas a stay and ordered that this law go into effect unless the U.S. 
 
 Supreme Court acted. And so we saw the U.S. Supreme Court very swiftly put a temporary freeze on this case and blocked the law from going into effect 
 
 until March 13th. 
 
The justices there buying themselves a little time so they can look at this case. 
 
Now the Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, took this as a victory, issuing a statement, saying in part, quote, "SB-4" -- and this is the law that 
 
 we're talking about -- "was adopted to address the ongoing crisis at the southern border, which hurts Texans more than anyone else." 
 
Now the arguments that have been made by the state of Texas in the lower courts gives us an idea of what the justices will consider in this case. 
 
One of the main arguments by the state of Texas is this idea that Texas is under a, quote, "invasion," because migrants are crossing the border 
 
 illegally. Now, in the lower court, the judge was very clear that he was not going to take that argument. 
 
He rejected that argument, saying that migrants crossing illegally into the state of Texas is not a, quote, "invasion," and the lower court judge 
 
 upheld precedent in the United States, which is that immigration is a federal function. 
 
I want to read you a few excerpts from this judge, because it gives you an idea of his thinking. 
 
He says, quote, "Surges in immigration do not constitute an, quote, 'invasion' within the meaning of the Constitution nor is Texas engaging in 
 
 war by enforcing SB-4." 
 
He goes on to say, "If allowed to proceed, SB-4 could open the door to each state passing its own version of immigration laws. SB-4 threatens the 
 
 fundamental notion that the United States must regulate immigration with one voice." 
 
Now Texas governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, has maintained throughout this legal fight that the state of Texas has constitutional authority to do 
 
 this. 
 
Now I can't emphasize this enough. There's a lot of concern within the Latino community in the state of Texas about potential racial profiling if 
 
 this law goes into effect. Latinos make up 40 percent of the population in this state. 
 
And we have video of this. This is a workshop that has been conducted by civil rights organizations, Becky, to educate the public about their rights 
 
 in the United States and in the state of Texas. 
 
And we're seeing more and more of these throughout the state as this population tries to educate themselves about what they will and will not be 
 
 able to do in the case of they get stopped by the police -- Becky. 
 
ANDERSON:  Fascinating. Rosa, good to have you. Thank you. 
 
Still to come, amid border tensions, Israel's defense minister says his country is closer to a critical decision about military activities in 
 
 Lebanon.

ANDERSON:  Welcome back. You're watching CONNECT THE WORLD with me, Becky Anderson. Time in the UAE is half past 7:00. Time on the East Coast is 
 
 10:30. 
 
And, in Washington, Benjamin Netanyahu's political rival is set to meet with America's top diplomat. Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz is 
 
 expected to sit down with U.S. secretary of state Antony Blinken in about 30 minutes' time. 
 
But Israel is making it clear that Gantz is not representing the government during what is his three-day U.S. trip. He's also scheduled to meet Defense 
 
 Secretary Lloyd Austin at the Pentagon in the coming hours. 
 
Israel's defense minister, Yoav Gallant, says his country is closer to making critical decisions about military activities in Lebanon, amid 
 
 escalating tensions between Hezbollah and Israel. Now Mr. Gallant made the comments to U.S. special envoy Amos Hochstein on Tuesday, according to a 
 
 readout. 
 
It comes a day after Hochstein made these comments in Beirut, as he met with senior Lebanese officials, to try and find a diplomatic de-escalation. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
AMOS HOCHSTEIN, STATE DEPARTMENT SENIOR ADVISER FOR GLOBAL ENERGY SECURITY:  There is no such thing as a limited war. Escalation will not help the 
 
 Lebanese and Israeli people return home. 
 
Escalation will not resolve this crisis. An escalation will certainly not help Lebanon rebuild and advance forward at this critical time in Lebanon's 
 
 history. But a temporary ceasefire is not enough. A limited war is not containable.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)  
 
ANDERSON:  Officials say the U.S. administration is concerned that Israel is planning a ground incursion into Lebanon, that could be launched in the 
 
 late spring or early summer if diplomatic efforts fail. CNN's Paula Hancocks joins me now live. 
 
Paula, what do you have?
 
PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Becky, the facts that the U.S. special envoy was in Israel today, Tuesday -- he was in Beirut on Monday -- 
 
 really trying to talk both countries back from the ledge, pointing out how difficult it would be to try and contain any kind of, what he called, 
 
 quote, "limited war" between the two.
 <br>[10:35:00]
 
And the U.S. certainly is concerned that the diplomatic solution may not be enough. Right. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
HANCOCKS (voice-over):  The voice of a child narrating the sounds of conflict. Israel's Iron Dome blocking another barrage of Hezbollah rockets.
 
Billows of black smoke have become an almost permanent fixture on the horizon of the Israeli-Lebanon border.
 
Near daily exchanges of fire, Israeli strikes pound parts of southern Lebanon villages, homes have been reduced to rubble, buildings burned to 
 
 the ground.
 
And tens of thousands of Israelis remain evacuated from the border out of reach of Hezbollah rockets.
 
Escalating tensions over recent weeks between Israel and the Iran- backed Islamist group Hezbollah, one of the most powerful paramilitary forces in 
 
 the Middle East, are sparking increasing fears of a wider regional conflict.
 
U.S. administration and intelligence officials tell CNN they're concerned Israel may be planning a ground incursion into Lebanon in the late spring 
 
 or early summer.
 
Israel's defense minister warned even if there's a temporary ceasefire in Gaza, it will continue and may even increase its attacks against Hezbollah.
 
Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah said their rockets would stop once a Gaza ceasefire is in place.
 
HANCOCKS:  For the past few months, strikes have focused fairly close to the border region. However, Israel is now edging further north, hitting a 
 
 town just last week over 100 kilometers from Lebanon's border. The deepest attack yet into Lebanese territory.
 
HANCOCKS (voice-over):  The IDF now ramping up drills, releasing this video showing its forces conducting training exercises in the north. One former 
 
 officer believes greater Israeli force is inevitable if diplomacy fails, which he suspects it will.
 
GIDEON HARARI, FORMER IDF OFFICER AND MILITARY ANALYST:  If we want to make Hezbollah withdraw from the border, I don't see any other way to do it. And 
 
 sadly, I'm saying it, I don't want to, I don't think that it's good for us or even for the Lebanese. It will be ugly. It will be painful for both 
 
 sides. It won't be short.
 
HANCOCKS (voice-over):  A bloody war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006 is still fresh in the region's memory. With concerns a repeat would be even 
 
 more deadly.
 
AMAL SAAD, LECTURER, CARDIFF UNIVERSITY:  This is Hezbollah 2.0. We don't know what Hezbollah is capable of today. This is a very secretive 
 
 organization. And we can already see it has way more sophisticated anti- tank guided missiles, for example and much more sophisticated drones.
 
HANCOCKS (voice-over):  Saad says that while Hezbollah may be war averse, it is not afraid of war. While some in Israel's war cabinet appear keen to 
 
 use a truce in Gaza as a chance to sharpen focus on its northern border.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HANCOCKS:  And nearly 200 have been killed in Lebanon since October. There's some 90,000 displaced on the Lebanese side of the border and about 
 
 80,000 displaced on the Israeli side. Becky. 
 
ANDERSON:  Paula Hancocks on what is an extremely important story. 
 
Paula, thank you. 
 
The U.N.'s main agency in Gaza, UNRWA, is accusing Israel of detaining and mistreating its staff members. The agency spokesperson said on Monday that 
 
 staffers have been coerced by Israeli forces and to giving, and I quote them here, "false confessions" about the organization's alleged links to 
 
 Hamas. 
 
She also accused Israel of spreading misinformation as part of attempts to dismantle the agency. Well, meantime, its chief, Philippe Lazzarini says, 
 
 his organization is facing a financial crisis. 
 
The U.N. says 16 nations paused funding to UNRWA after Israel made allegations that some of its staff was involved in the October 7 attacks. 
 
 Those donations totaled about $450 million. 
 
Getting more aid into Gaza, according to the State Department, is at the top of the agenda of the discussions between Biden administration officials 
 
 and Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gantz, saying not nearly enough aid is getting to the besieged enclave. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MATT MILLER, SPOKESPERSON, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT:  We continue to push for a temporary ceasefire through a hostage agreement that would allow a 
 
 massive surge of aid into Gaza and ease the distribution problems that are currently hindering humanitarian efforts. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON:  Now let's be clear. 
 <br>[10:40:00]
 
What goes in and out of Gaza is at the behest of Israel, including humanitarian aid. The Israeli government has thus far refused to open more 
 
 crossings for humanitarian aid going into Gaza, which is why you're seeing more and more airdrops of aid falling over the Strip just over the weekend. 
 
The U.S. air-dropped humanitarian aid into Gaza for the first time since the war began nearly five months ago, calling it a success; 38,000 meals 
 
 flew over Gaza's coastline. But for over 2 million people at risk of famine, that is just a drop in the ocean, quite literally. 
 
Some humanitarian organizations criticized the move, pointing out that it is an ineffective way to deliver aid. 
 
And in the U.S. Capitol, what looked like hundreds of protesters gathered outside the Israeli embassy, calling out what they say is U.S. hypocrisy. 
 
Out of the all the options the U.S. has at its disposal to end this tragedy, that's what they chose to do.

KATHY BOYLAN, U.S. PROTESTER:  We're dropping some food and we're dropping the bombs and the tanks and the bullets and everything else at the same 
 
 time. That's what he's got to do, stop sending the money and the weapons. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON:  And if there is one -- any one country that can apply pressure on Israel, it is, of course, the United States. But despite Washington 
 
 seemingly changing its approach toward its ally in public, at least one thing remains unchanged:  its unwavering military and financial support. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MILLER:  We support Israel's legitimate military campaign, consistent with international humanitarian law. And that's why we continue to support them 
 
 militarily. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON:  Since the start of what so many people have described as this horrific war, President Biden has bypassed Congress twice to make emergency 
 
 weapons sales to Israel. The United States has vetoed three U.N. resolutions causing for a cease -- calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. 
 
In a rather rare rebuke of Israel, Vice President Kamala Harris called for an immediate cease-fire, words the U.S. has thus far preferred not to use -
 
 - just not a permanent one. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KAMALA HARRIS (D), VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  People in Gaza are starving. The conditions are inhumane. The Israeli government must do more 
 
 to significantly increase the flow of aid, no excuses. 
 
There must be an immediate ceasefire --
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS:  -- for at least the next six weeks.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON:  It has been five months. Over half a million people are one step away from famine. Tens of thousands are displaced. Thousands of children 
 
 who are barely surviving have lost their parents.
 
What will it take to end this?
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON (voice-over):  Well, if there's one image that sums up how many people feel about the West's actions in Gaza, it's this cartoon that has 
 
 gone viral online -- loaves of bread being dropped from the sky alongside bombs. The comedy of the absurd, were it not the tragedy of our times.
 
We will be right back.

ANDERSON:  Two staunch allies of Ukraine are meeting today at the Pentagon, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is hosting his counterpart from 
 
 Lithuania. You will probably recall, Lithuania announced more than $200 million in military aid for Kyiv in January as it battles Russia's 
 
 invasion. 
 
And Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy made a surprise trip to the Baltic country early this year. Mr. Zelenskyy needs all the help he can get 
 
 as his tank units on the front line tells CNN they have to ration their ammunition. 
 
CNN's Nick Paton Walsh went to the front line and tells us the sound of silence can be just as deafening and terrifying as the noise of Russian 
 
 shelling. Have a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice- over):  It's a lonely path ahead. The Russians have never been louder or closer. Occupied Bakhmut is just up the road. But now some Ukrainian tank 
 
 guns are silent just when they're needed most here, they don't have enough shells.
 
WALSH:  Sometimes they just won't fire at all for a whole day. Other days they'll be shooting constantly and it is loud on the other side of that 
 
 hill and it's sort of surreal to hear that sort of noise over there and see this tank unit having to ration their ammo.
 
YAROSLAV, 42ND MECHANIZED BRIGADE:  We have people but without weapons, this is not a war you can win the a sword.
 
WALSH (voice-over):  We learned they didn't fire a tool that day or the day before or the next day. The silence here is what losing sounds like so to 
 
 is what these soldiers had to say.
 
WALSH:  If the American's don't' give money, what's going to happen?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think we're all good to die. Everybody who is here. We will be no more.
 
WALSH:  Is this the worst you've seen it?
 
GARRISON FOSTER, U.S. VOLUNTEER FIGHTER:  Yes. Yes, definitely. I think this year is going to be the worst year in the war. All I do know that 
 
 there's certain units they're running out of tanks.
 
WALSH:  How angry does it make you?
 
FOSTER:  Yes, I'm pissed. I'm absolutely pissed off. There's no point in trying to paint this in any sort of light where it's good for us that 
 
 Russia takes Ukraine that's going to be very, very, very bad for us geopolitically.
 
WALSH (voice-over):  It's here, Chasiv Yar, that already looks like defeat. Those left sounding like they'd be just about OK, when Russia comes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I want to see my granddaughter. She's in Moscow. My sister is in Kaliningrad. Half of Russia are my relatives. But I'm here 
 
 alone.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No water, no gas, no power, no nothing. They drive straight to the house where people live. And they fire right from the 
 
 house. They hide behind the civilians backs.
 
WALSH (voice-over):  Further south near Avdiivka, homes that dealt with about 10 years of war just up the road are finally emptying out.
 
VALENTINA, ZHELANIE RESIDENT:  You know, the house shook four times already. It's made of clay and straw. They shell so hard, that every time I 
 
 think that's it. We are done. The most scary would be if that horde come here. There can be no trusting people whose hands are covered in blood.
 
WALSH (voice-over):  The skyline is bleak enough as it is but now rumbles with Russia advancing. Ukraine said it would hold steady at three villages 
 
 near here after it left Avdiivka. 
 <br>[10:50:00]
 
That hasn't happened. All three are now heavily contested at best and the noise of the Russian approach is louder.
 
VICTOR, OCHERETYNE RESIDENT:  Donbas was Ukraine, we were living a normal life. We had jobs. I will turn 70 soon. I've been married for 52 years. We 
 
 will be buried together. Right here. Right in the ditch there.
 
WALSH:  Did you expect the Russians to get so close?
 
EUHENE, OCHERETYNE RESIDENT:  We didn't expect it. We thought it would somehow settle, calm down.
 
WALSH:  Some units had enough shells. They said firing American rounds in a donated Paladin but still less than before. We didn't see much in the way 
 
 of heavy defenses around here. And the worry is, was and will be that Russia does not stop.
 
It may not be huge and southern (ph) enough to make the west pay urgent attention but that's exactly what Putin wants anyway -- Nick Paton Walsh, 
 
 CNN, Chasiv Yar, Ukraine.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON:  Well, Ukraine, of course, a key foreign policy issue for the United States, one that might help inform voters' choice for the next 
 
 president, a reminder that we are following a big day in that U.S. presidential race right now. 
 
Super Tuesday is the biggest multi-state election so far this year, with more than a third of all Republican and Democratic delegates at stake. Our 
 
 indepth coverage begins at 06:00 pm on the East Coast.
 
Diverse and dynamic creations from more than 40 countries around the world, finding a home in Dubai for the Middle East's largest international art

ANDERSON:  In our "Parting Shots" tonight, we take you to Dubai for an art fair that's celebrated the creative output of this region and beyond. Art 
 
 Dubai brought together pieces from more than 120 galleries, featuring several genres, from the contemporary to the digital. Here's a glimpse at 
 
 some of the mesmerizing exhibits. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
(MUSIC PLAYING)
 
PABLO DEL VALLE (PH), ARTISTIC DIRECTOR, ART DUBAI (voice-over):  Art Dubai tends to be unique and completely different to any other (INAUDIBLE) the 
 
 world. My name is Pablo del Valle (ph) and I'm otherwise artistic director. 
 
These here we've been discussing about the concept of healing, how we can look for a better world and how we can build communities that are more 
 
 respectful to each other. 
 
You will have the rashes over temple (ph) and these doing this amazing performance that is using costumes that he designed and he produces, that 
 
 is linking with atabic (ph) traditions from his community. 
 
(MUSIC PLAYING)
 
DEL VALLE (PH) (voice-over):  We have Armia (ph), which is a Palestinian artist. 
 <br>[10:55:00]
 
So he's dealing with traditional ideas that are coming from Middle Eastern, Palestinian culture and especially he's talking about fermentation. 
 
Fermentation also affects your body, affects the way that you relate with the environment, how you relate with the culture where you're living 
 
 through. 
 
(MUSIC PLAYING)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over):  The cultural hub, that device positioning itself, I think that's really important. 
 
My name is Hasalah Lemke (ph). I'm an artist reasonable debate (ph). 
 
(MUSIC PLAYING)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over):  I'm trying to heal myself over the course of years that, by connecting to the Earth and like eating art to natural 
 
 resources (ph).
 
I work a lot with natural pigments. I use Japanese silk; whereas, if it's cotton or in a tent (ph) fabric, you know, all of these are different 
 
 surfaces. So it's always exciting to be experimental. And I like to be curious in my practice and kind of like learn as I go. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON:  Well Art Dubai there, embracing the theme of healing (ph) and a little healing goes along way in times like these. 
 
That's it for CONNECT THE WORLD this evening. Stay with CNN. "NEWSROOM" is up next.
