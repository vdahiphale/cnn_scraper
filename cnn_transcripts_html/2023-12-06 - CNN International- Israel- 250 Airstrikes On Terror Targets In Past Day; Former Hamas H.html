BIANCA NOBILO, CNN HOST: Hello and welcome to CNN Newsroom. I'm Bianca Nobilo in for Max Foster today. Just ahead for you, fighting between Israel and Hamas intensifies across Gaza as the Israeli Prime Minister claims once again that the territory should be under Israel's control.
 
Then, Boris Johnson admits that mistakes were made during his government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic. We'll have more on the former British Prime Minister's COVID inquiry.
 
Plus, CNN meets with Ukraine's White Angels, a police unit in the town of Avdiivka, in charge of helping civilians on the frontlines.
 
We begin with what appears to be a significant expansion in the Israel-Hamas war, with both northern and southern Gaza coming under heavy attack. The IDF says it has carried out some 250 airstrikes against militant targets over the past day. Particularly intense fighting is taking place in Khan Younis, this enclave's second largest city.
 
In central Gaza, eyewitnesses reported multiple strikes on Tuesday. A hospital spokesperson in the area said there have been dozens of casualties, and that many people are still trapped under the rubble. It all comes as the U.N. Agency for Palestinian Refugees warns that Gaza has become one of the most dangerous places in the world, as we can all well imagine.
 
CNN's Alex Marquardt joins me now live at an army base in southern Israel. Alex, bring us up to date with the latest on the operation and the encirclement of Khan Younis.
 
ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, Bianca, Israel's top commanding general says they have now entered the third phase of this conflict. And what that essentially means is they say they're solidifying gains that they have made in northern Gaza and then heading south and focusing their efforts on southern Gaza.
 
The IDF saying that they are operating in the heart of Khan Younis trying to encircle the city as well. As you pointed out, that's the second biggest city in the Gaza Strip. It is the biggest in in southern Gaza. We have seen a number of airstrikes over the past few days in the area as well, leading to chaos in the streets as Palestinians try to get their wounded to the hospitals, which they say are overflowing at the same time.
 
The Gazans in Khan Younis are being told by the IDF that they need to leave parts of Khan Younis and had even farther south for their own safety. We've also gotten some new video and information from the IDF today. They say they found a huge weapons cache in the northern part of the Gaza Strip that included hundreds of missiles, they say, including long range missiles.
 
There were rocket propelled grenade launchers, dozens of anti-tank missiles, dozens of explosive charges. Some of those weapons, the Israeli military says, were destroyed on sight. Others were taken back to Israel for examination. But there are major humanitarian questions now, Bianca, as Israel presses south.
 
Again, hundreds of thousands of people, we believe, are being told to leave the Khan Younis area. Where they will go is the question that humanitarian officials are now asking. Shelters in the south, particularly around the city of Rafah are overflowing.
 
People are living in the streets. They're finding a shelter wherever they can. There is not enough aid. And Palestinians and humanitarian officials alike will tell you that nowhere in Gaza is safe. Bianca?
 
NOBILO: CNN's Alex Marquardt for us, thank you very much.
 
Some former hostages held by Hamas met Israel's war Cabinet and talked about their time in captivity. One former hostage testified that they were inside tunnels in difficult and nearly impossible conditions.
 
Clare Sebastian joins us now with more. Clare, what more do we know about this meeting? What was the message to the Cabinet from the hostages? What was the response from the government?
 
CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, so this was a meeting, a private meeting between some of the freed hostages and some family members of those that still remain in Gaza with the Prime Minister Netanyahu and some members of the Security Cabinet.
 
Now, audio has leaked, some of it was published on the Israeli news site Ynet. So this is where we've been able to get some of these stories. Really critical is the level of anger in this meeting. People feeling very let down by the government. There was heckling in one instance, people shouting shame. And that gives you a sense of the tension.
 
That one really striking part of it was there are several accounts of hostages reporting being shelled by essentially by the IDF while in captivity. One of them saying that they were shelled not only in their hiding place, had to be moved or wounded, but that they were fired at by a helicopter on their way into Gaza.
 <br>[08:05:16] Another one saying that the hostages are not just in tunnels, but some of them out on the streets under the constant threat of shelling. One woman who was freed talks about her serious concerns for those who remain. The implication is some of them are elderly. She says they're lying on mattresses all the time.
 
She had been there to sort of get them up, keep them active, but she's very worried about their mental state now, says they're on the verge of losing hope. Now it's reported by Ynet that there were obviously responses from Netanyahu to this. We did not get a sort of a sense of regret or remorse really.
 
He made the point that it is only the ground offensive in his view that pushed the talks to this point, that got them to the point where they were able to secure the release of 105 hostages as for whether any more to come. He said we couldn't release everyone at once. This is as reported by Ynet.
 
The price they want is not prisoners. The price they want is not only the prisoners. The implication being that the price that Hamas wanted for future hostages was too high. I think critical to remember the families of the hostages thus far now the freed hostages themselves, they have been a political force in Israel. And I think we're going to continue to see the pressure ramp up. 138 believed to still be there.
 
NOBILO: Clare Sebastian, thank you.
 
Doctors on the ground in central Gaza are warning that they do not have enough fuel or medical supplies to treat the many patients arriving every single day. Videos from one hospital, which some viewers may find disturbing, show the floods of patients coming to the medical center for treatment.
 
Doctors Without Borders said Tuesday that supply levels at Gaza's Al- Aqsa Hospital are now critically low due to road closures.
 
As the war drags on, the need for aid is becoming more and more dire. CNN's Ben Wedeman takes a closer look at what people in Gaza are being forced to endure as they evacuate further south. And a warning that the report contains disturbing images.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): They came here hoping to escape the war and this is what happened. Tuesday afternoon, an apparent Israeli airstrike demolished this building in Deir al Balah, in Central Gaza.
 
Civilians more than 50 are now martyrs, says Abu Bassem. The building's owner had given them shelter. They all came from the north.
 
Under the sand and rubble is a lifeless body. There is his head, someone says, while others peering into the ruins search for survivors. Is anyone alive, he calls out.
 
Without heavy equipment, bare hands will suffice. Deir al Balah's only functioning hospital, the injured are rushed inside. The hospital's spokesman says they received more than 130 injured and more than 90 bodies. CNN cannot confirm the death toll.
 
Once again, so many of the victims are children. Stunned, confused, terrified, she grasps her mother's hand. The injured treated on the floor.
 
The luckier among those who fled and then fled again further south end up in places like this, makeshift camps devoid of running water, electricity or sanitation. A plastic sheet is all that protects Enas Musleh and her family from the elements.
 
We spend all night hearing rockets and bombs, she says. We're living between life and death. We may die at any moment.
 
Indeed, in Gaza now, the line between life and death is perilously thin.
 
Ben Wedeman, CNN, Jerusalem.

NOBILO: It's been fairly rare for Vladimir Putin to travel outside of Russia since his invasion of Ukraine almost two years ago, but he is visiting the Middle East for meetings with senior leaders in both the UAE and Saudi Arabia.
 
His talks are expected to center around oil prices, as well as the Israel-Hamas conflict. Putin's Saudi visit will include a face to face meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Those two men are said to control one-fifth of the oil pumped worldwide.
 
Now, Fred Pleitgen is tracking the Russian leader's travels today. So, Fred, Putin visiting the UAE and Saudi Arabia, having these high stakes discussions, it just shows that the West hasn't succeeded in making him a global pariah since he invaded Ukraine.
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, I think you're absolutely right, and that certainly is definitely one of the big messages that is coming from these two meetings that are happening in Saudi Arabia and the UAE as well.
 <br>[08:10:02]
 
In fact, Vladimir Putin right now is actually on the ground in Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates. And, of course, on the face of it, you have the regular itinerary of that meeting. You mentioned some of the important points that are going to be discussed at these meetings. One of them, of course, the Israel-Hamas war.
 
Vladimir Putin also tailing the president of the United Arab Emirates. We're seeing both of them walking together there right now that he will also inform him as he put it about the crisis in Ukraine. Of course, that meeting, meaning Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.
 
The two certainly also going to be speaking about the prices of hydrocarbons, but in general, also bilateral relations. And that's certainly where the other important point about these meetings comes in, which is exactly what you mentioned, Bianca.
 
Because what we saw when Vladimir Putin got on the ground in the United Arab Emirates, and even as he was flying there is that the UAE at least was not only rolling out the red carpet, but also bringing in a formation of fighter pilots to paint the skies in the colors of the Russian flag.
 
So certainly, a very warm welcome for the Russian president. These two nations, the UAE and Saudi Arabia, definitely making clear that they are still very much allies of the United States and European countries, but also want relations with Russia as well.
 
And, of course, the message that the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, is sending is that Russia will not be isolated, despite the fact that Western nations have been trying to do that. The Russian president, certainly, on the international stage, very much not isolated.
 
We can see that also, for instance, in the BRICS format, which several nations are a part of. The UAE and Saudi Arabia, of course, set to join the BRICS nations in January of this coming year. So certainly an important message for Vladimir -- an important meeting for Vladimir Putin.
 
But again, the message for the Russians is and for the world is, is that Russia is back on the international stage and Vladimir Putin certainly won't be isolated, Bianca.
 
NOBILO: Fred Pleitgen for us in Berlin, thank you. Good to see you.
 
Former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is apologizing for how his government handled the COVID-19 pandemic during an inquiry on Wednesday morning. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BORIS JOHNSON, FORMER BRITISH PM: Can I just say how glad I am to be at this inquiry and how sorry I am for the pain and the loss and the suffering of the COVID victims -- 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Please sit down. Please sit down or I'm afraid you'll have to leave the hearing room.
 
JOHNSON: Though I understand the feelings of these victims and their families, and I am deeply sorry for the pain and the loss and the suffering of those victims and their families.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NOBILO: As you just heard, the hearing was interrupted by protesters, some of which are family members of those who died from COVID-19. Johnson will face two days of questioning. The panel has already heard damaging testimony about Johnson's handling of the pandemic that included claims of government incompetence and allegations that Johnson told colleagues he would prefer to see people die in large numbers rather than order a second lockdown.
 
U.S. President Joe Biden is walking back a candid remark about why he's seeking reelection. He told Democratic donors at an off camera fundraiser on Tuesday, quote, "If Trump wasn't running, I'm not sure I'd be running". But just a few hours later, when pressed by reporters, Mr. Biden said, "I expect so. But look, he is running and I have to run".
 
The Biden campaign was quick to downplay the earlier remark as a nothing to see here kind of moment.
 
Still to come, what will a post-war Gaza look like? Israeli leaders insist they must be put in charge of demilitarization there. After the break, why many disagree.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[08:15:58]
 
NOBILO: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has doubled down, insisting that Israel must be responsible for disarmament in Gaza after the war. Speaking on Tuesday, Mr. Netanyahu once again rejected the suggestion that an international force could be made responsible for security in the Strip.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Gaza must be demilitarized. And in order for Gaza to be demilitarized, there is only one force that can ensure this. And that force is the Israel Defense Forces. No international force can take responsibility for this.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NOBILO: The remarks appear to set Israel at odds with some of its closest Western allies, including the United States, which has called on Israel not to reoccupy Gaza. A U.S. official told CNN on Tuesday that the White House is deeply concerned about how Israel's operations will unfold in the next weeks. All this as multiple senior U.S. officials tell CNN that they believe this current stage of war could end by January.
 
To discuss this, let's bring in CNN's Ben Wedeman, who's been following developments for us from Jerusalem. Ben, first to this point made by Netanyahu, that the IDF would have to retain open-ended security control of Gaza after this offensive and the war with Hamas ends. There's obviously been a lot of speculation about what Israel's plan would be after the war. Why does he think that a suggestion like this would be accepted by his allies or neighboring countries?
 
WEDEMAN: That's a very good question and nobody's really able to answer it because clearly when he's talking about disarming or demilitarizing Gaza, what does that mean? That means basically they have to be control of the entire Gaza Strip with its more than 2.2 million population. Does this mean they have to search every square inch of Gaza for any weapons?
 
This is obviously would be a process that would take a very long time and that would essentially mean that at least temporarily, Israel would be the occupying power directly as opposed to indirectly as is the case now of the Gaza Strip. And as the occupying power, it would be responsible for the provision of basic services, education, electricity, health care, things like that.
 
And certainly, Israel's neighbors would be very concerned if basically Israel reestablishes the direct occupation of Gaza that existed until the summer of 2005 when Israel pulled out its settlers and troops from the Gaza Strip. And there is a lot of concern among many. Palestinians as well as beyond the Palestinians.
 
Given that we are seen oftentimes on social media, a desire among some of the soldiers who were in Gaza at the moment, among other Israelis that they would like to reestablish the settlements that were dismantled in 2005.
 
So there's -- it's a wildly complicated proposition by Prime Minister Netanyahu and clearly one that even the United States, which generally seems to agree with everything Israel does, it's something that even the Americans don't seem very enthusiastic about.
 
NOBILO: And Ben, clearly, life in Gaza at the moment is extraordinarily dangerous. It's brutal, it's geared entirely towards survival. Is it possible to get a sense about what it's like for Gazans at the moment who are living under Hamas control?
 
WEDEMAN: Well, we depend upon journalists who are working there for us and as well as other news organizations given that the Israelis nor the Egyptians are letting journalists into Gaza. But the picture we're getting is that, you know, there are hundreds of thousands of people who have been displaced multiple times.
 <br>[08:20:02]
 
About 85 percent of the population of Gaza has been displaced, and they're being displaced into ever more difficult conditions. You'll recall when the Israelis ordered people to leave the north and go to the south. Many of them were crowding into these U.N. schools, others in the apartments of relatives, for instance.
 
Ibrahim Dahman, our producer, when he was forced to go to Khan Younis ended up staying in a flat with a hundred other people. Now, they're basically out in the open. They're setting up tents and other makeshift shelters which are basically plastic sheeting covering their heads in areas where there's no running water, no toilets, no facilities, there's very little in the way of food.
 
I mean, we've gotten video from one of our cameramen in Gaza -- in Rafah today where people are lining up for hours trying to get a bag of flour from the U.N. and oftentimes they wait for days and don't even get it. In addition to that, the World Health Organization is increasingly concerned that living in these conditions, that people are getting sick. There's a huge jump in the incidence of intestinal diseases, skin disease, hepatitis. The situation is catastrophic, even though we can't be there to see it ourselves, but it certainly appears to be the case.
 
NOBILO: Ben Wedeman for us in Jerusalem, thank you very much for joining us and for your reporting.
 
Coming up, you'll meet the White Angels who risk life and limb in Ukraine to get vital necessities to those who need them the most. Their story after the break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
NOBILO: Russian forces are pressing on with the long running drive to capture the eastern Ukrainian town of Avdiivka with both sides saying that they made gains on Tuesday. CNN's Anna Coren follows a group of Ukrainians called the White Angels, who are bringing supplies to people still living there in the war zone.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANNA COREN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): At a warehouse stocked with humanitarian aid, 23-year-old police officer Dmitro Solovy (ph) picks up supplies. Food, water, hygiene products and a generator are on the list.
 
He's part of the White Angels unit, and they're heading to his hometown of Avdiivka in the Donetsk region on the Eastern Front, where one of the most fierce and bloody battles is being waged in the war in Ukraine.
 
I was born in this town, he tells me. My neighbors are there, my relatives, my friends. It's my duty to help them. We are their hope.
 
But getting to Avdiivka is a death trap. Shortly after leaving us, with his GoPro rolling, he spots Russian shelling through the windscreen.
 <br>[08:25:04]
 
Look, the bomb has landed. Report incoming of an ugly bastard. And there's another one, he tells his colleague.
 
Russian artillery, mortars and drones target the road, and yet Dmytro (ph) remains calm. This perilous journey has become routine, despite multiple close calls. Driving past the sign that proudly states Avdiivka is Ukraine, the town of once 30,000 residents is now deserted, devoid of the living, as almost every single building has been shelled.
 
But surprisingly, some people still live here, including Dr. Vitaly Sintnik (ph), head of the local hospital. Diagnosed with terminal cancer, he's decided he's not going anywhere.
 
We have a job and we do it, he explains. He called the White Angels to evacuate a man who'd just been injured from shrapnel. As they load him into the van, the idle chatter is interrupted.
 
Incoming. It's a mortar, explains the doctor. Sometimes it rustles, and then bang. That would be a tank. As the explosions get louder, it's time to go.
 
(on-camera): This is the road to Avdiivka. There is one way in, one way out. We are not allowed to travel to the town, which is 17 kilometers away. The military has banned all media, saying it's just too dangerous.
 
But for the White Angels, they travel on this road multiple times a week, risking their lives to support the less than 1,300 people still living in the town.
 
(voice-over): As the White Angels begin the dangerous drive out, Dmytro (ph) reflects. It's very sad what's happening to my town, but one day we'll rebuild Avdiivka, and I will live there with my grandchildren. We just need to believe. A belief that keeps this community among the ruins alive.
 
Anna Coren, CNN, on the outskirts of Avdiivka, Ukraine.

NOBILO: Incredible bravery.
 
Well, thank you so much for joining me here on CNN Newsroom. I'm Bianca Nobilo in London. But don't go anywhere, because World Sport with Amanda Davies is coming up for you next.
