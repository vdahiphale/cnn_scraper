KASIE HUNT, CNN ANCHOR: All right, welcome back.
 
It's nearly official. Come January, House Republicans could be governing with a brutally slim 220 to 215 majority. California Democrat Adam Gray currently leads Republican incumbent John Duarte by a couple hundred votes in the last remaining House seat to be called after a month of vote counting. Gray's expected win leaves Speaker Mike Johnson with a thin majority that is squeezed further by Donald Trump's selection of several House Republicans to join his administration. 
 
That balance of power will give a single member of the GOP conference a whole lot of sway over Johnson's agenda in the time before those seats are filled. Do you remember how that went last time?

REP. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE (R-GA): I really don't give a rat's ass what anybody up here says about what I'm doing. 
 
MATT GAETZ, FORMER U.S. CONGRESSMAN: The one thing everybody has in common is that nobody trusts Kevin McCarthy. 
 
REP. CHIP ROY (R-TX): You go around talking your big game and you thumping your chest on Twitter. Yes, come to my office and come have a debate, mother. 
 
GREENE: What does it matter if I'm in the government? The American people don't give a (EXPLETIVE DELETED).
 
REP. TIM BURCHETT (R-TX): I got elbowed in the back. And it kind of caught me off guard because it was a clean shot to the kidneys. And I turned back, and there was - there was Kevin.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT: There was Kevin. 
 
Joining me now is the man that you saw there, Republican Congressman Tim Burchett of Tennessee. 
 
Congressman, thanks very much for being here. 
 
REP. TIM BURCHETT (R-TX): Thank you. I was hoping you were going to say I was going to be the most important member of Congress in that intro when you started that. I thought, hey, you got me. Here I am. Well, great for my ego.
 
HUNT: Well, but isn't - isn't that kind of the deal, though here for Republicans in Congress? I mean any - it's - it's - this is the dynamic we confront in the Senate all the time. It's a smaller body. Any single Republican member could potentially hold up all of the business at hand. Are you willing to do that, for example, or how do you -
 
BURCHETT: Yes, that - I mean that's - if it's - if it's morally correct, if it's something that I really believe in. If it's - you know, if we continue down this path of economic destruction, spending our great grandchildren's money, yes, I will, and I have. And we'll continue on that path until we regain some sanity. 
 
If we could just do like we do in Tennessee, single issue spending bills. You know, it's - it's - it's a great way if you're in power, Democrat or Republican, you drop a 3,000 page spending bill on your desk two hours before, and all you do is read down, oh, there's page 25, there's all the stuff I need, or there's the lobbyist I need degrees or what have you, and then they vote for it. And that's why we're $36 trillion in debt. 
 
HUNT: So are you saying that if there's a situation where you need to fund the government on a continuing basis between now and a couple of these elections, April 1st is a - is a key deadline when more Republicans will be, are you saying that you would not vote to continue the - you would not vote for a continuing resolution, potentially shut the government down?
 
BURCHETT: It depends on the situation. But if we continue on this path, it's inevitable we're going to destroy our economy and shut the government down anyway. You know, right now we're - Americans are paying around $600 to $1,200 more a month just to survive. And the reason is - we are doing that is because of our reckless spending. It's deficit spending. Every economist will tell you that is what causes the devaluation of your dollar. And - and we just can't continue on this - this path. All we're doing is really just - just buying our re-election. And both parties are guilty of it. 
 
HUNT: Are you happy with how House Speaker Mike Johnson has approached this issue, and has he talked to you and the conference about this? 
 
BURCHETT: Yes, I'm in - I'm incredibly pleased with the work that he's done. He's had a tough situation. You know, and we've - when he came in, he had to - we had Republicans that were in districts say in New York that - where Joe Biden had won by 15 points. 
 
HUNT: Yes.
 <br>[06:35:00]
 
BURCHETT: Yet they were Republicans elected there. So, he had a really fine line to walk. And he had to - I guess you could say protect them, as well as protect the integrity of the conference. And Mike Johnson is a very honorable man. I find him to be - he's an unusual person in that position because he - he didn't get there by cutting people's throats and - or cutting backroom deals. He just - he's been straightforward. And I've enjoyed working with him. 
 
HUNT: Let me ask you about Pete Hegseth, the Defense secretary nominee. He's going to be on Capitol Hill today. He's actually going to be meeting with some House Republicans, in addition to this critical meeting that he has with Joni Ernst in particular, the senator from Iowa. 
 
BURCHETT: Sure.
 
HUNT: Do you think that Pete Hegseth should continue as Donald Trump's Defense nominee? Do you think he can be confirmed? 
 
BURCHETT: Well, that's up to Pete. I think every time somebody runs, they bring up things that are unfortunate in their life. And everything that they've brought up, though, has been - every - every claim that they've made against him has been - the Justice Department or whoever has decided not to prosecute for whatever reason. So, to me, that leaves - you know, I - I just -
 
HUNT: Well, I think that a lot of the allegations - I mean there was a police report around a sexual assault incident out in California that was not pursued. Recently, over the weekend, in "The New Yorker," there were allegations from an organization that he led that he - financial mismanagement of sexual impropriety, sexist behavior. 
 
And then there's this letter from his mother, who basically said in the course of his divorce that he had a problem mistreating women. What - would your mom have ever said - I mean what - what would - how would you feel if you were in that situation with your own mother?
 
BURCHETT: My mama would never have written that. My mama would have said, honey, I've raised you better than that. And she would probably smack my jaws. But I would not have - I would not have been in that situation. I - you know, I don't know. They - that's a family situation. You always wonder how those emails came to light. 
 
And, you know, the court of law is - is - is all we really have to go on. It's what we've seen in the past with these investigations. They're just investigations. And until somebody comes forward with the proof, you know, I think it's going to be up to - up to the United States senators. 
 
HUNT: All right, Congressman Tim Burchett, very grateful to have you on the show. 
 
BURCHETT: Thank you.
 
HUNT: The most important member of the House Republican Conference. BURCHETT: I'll keep telling myself that.
 
HUNT: You and every - every other one of your colleagues.
 
BURCHETT: I always say I'm the 435th most powerful member of Congress, ma'am (ph). And thank y'all all for having me. 
 
HUNT: Thank you for being here. 
 
All right, still ahead here on CNN THIS MORNING, South Korea plunging into political chaos after the president there declares martial law. Now his cabinet is resigning and the country's parliament is moving to impeach him. We'll bring you the latest. 
 
Plus, Trump continues to poke at our neighbors to the north over his plan to slap tariffs on products from Canada.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
STEPHEN COLBERT, HOST "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT": Trudeau told Trump he can't levy the tariff because it would kill the Canadian economy completely. So, Trump responded, maybe Canada should become the 51st state. Oof. Maybe next time, Puerto Rico. So close.

 <br>[06:42:10]
 
HUNT: Welcome back.
 
Upheaval in South Korea following a stunning attempt to impose martial law by embattled President Yoon Suk Yeol.
 
(VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT: The announcement sparking massive protests in Seoul. This woman's confrontation with an armed soldier going viral as she screams, "aren't you embarrassed" at him. Opposition democrats who control the national assembly vowing to bring treason charges and launch impeachment proceedings if Yoon does not leave office. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
PARK CHAN-DAE, FLOOR LEADER, DEMOCRATIC PARTY OF KOREA (through translator): He should step down, resign immediately. This is the mandate of the people. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT: South Korea's largest union vowing to strike until the president steps down. Yoon's chief of staff and other top officials already submitting their resignations. Yoon declared martial law and then rescinded it after accusing South Korea's opposition party of sympathizing with communist North Korea. CNN's Ivan Watson joins us live now from Seoul, where a candlelit
 
 protest march is making its way straight toward the president's office. 
 
Ivan, what are you seeing? 
 
IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Kasie, I mean it's almost 9:00 at night here, and there are thousands of people marching through Seoul right now to the president's office. This was part of a protest started by a labor union that is calling for the president to resign. People here chanting for President Yoon Suk Yeol to be arrested. 
 
This, of course, after he declared what may have been the shortest martial law the world has ever seen in an announcement Tuesday night that was followed by these dramatic events where lawmakers gathered in the middle of the night at the national assembly. There were soldiers that tried to stop them. They failed. And ultimately about 190 lawmakers voted to overrule martial law. Among them, 18 members of the president's own party, which has also come out condemning what he did.
 
Before dawn this morning, he backtracked and canceled martial law. But now he's got to face with the aftermath of that, his own political party calling for his close ally, his defense minister, to resign. His chief of staff and a number of top officials have resigned. And meanwhile, the opposition political parties are preparing for an attempt to impeach the president. So, he's really politically in hot water right now. 
 
But I need to stress the fact that even though there is, in effect, a form of a political crisis, it's not really being felt on the streets. 
 <br>[06:45:02]
 
I landed at Incheon Airport, the main international gateway to South Korea, this morning. It was functioning normally. There was no unusual law enforcement or security presence there. At lunchtime the restaurants downtown were full of office workers grabbing lunch. They were talking about this. And everybody I've addressed this with is incensed that the president tried to do away with decades of democratic governance in a move that really shocked this nation. But the political consequences look like they will be affecting this country for some time to come.
 
Kasie.
 
HUNT: Indeed. Ivan Watson for us on scene in Seoul. 
 
Ivan, thanks very much for that. Really appreciate it. 
 
And with more on the latest developments in South Korea, we're joined now by "Washington Post" columnist Josh Rogin. 
 
Josh, good morning. 
 
JOSH ROGIN, AUTHOR, "CHAOS UNDER HEAVEN" AND COLUMNIST, "WASHINGTON POST": Good morning. 
 
HUNT: Thank you so much for being here.
 
ROGIN: Thank you.
 
HUNT: I want to pick up where Ivan left off there in terms of what the repercussions are for a significant ally of the United States, democracy, in terms of what we're seeing around the globe. 
 
ROGIN: Sure. It just goes to show you, Kasie, how fragile this idea of democracy is. It's a - it's a bargain. It's an agreement between leaders to share power, to respond to the people. And it depends on everyone sort of doing their part. And the good news here is that President Yoon didn't succeed. He tried to impose martial law. He tried to bring Korea backwards into a military dictatorship, and it didn't work. But it could have worked. And anywhere in the world you see a democracy struggling, it really is those institutions and those people who stand up to the people who are trying to abuse power, that keep those democracies going.
 
And we see similar things in Europe. And we see similar things here in the United States. And it's just a - a lesson to all of us, I think, that this whole idea of democracy is something that we all kind of have to buy into or it doesn't really work in the end. 
 
HUNT: Yes. What are the implications for what's going on here for the incoming administration, for American relationships with China? 
 
ROGIN: Sure. 
 
HUNT: We know how President Trump felt about Kim Jong-un in North Korea, for example. 
 
ROGIN: Yes, I think it's a disaster for U.S.-South Korea relations on a couple of levels. One is that, you know, you have an incoming Trump administration that's really skeptical of allies. President Trump wanted to withdraw troops from South Korea the last time. Now he's got a pretty good excuse if he wanted to do it again. He didn't succeed the first time. He might succeed the second time. So, we really need a strong ally in Asia, in Seoul. And right now it's just a mess. Their whole democracy is in upheaval. That's not good. 
 
Another thing is China. You know, China is making the argument to all of these Asian countries that democracy doesn't work, that authoritarianism is better, that dictatorship really works better. It's not true, but today it kind of looks kind of true. And so anywhere in the world you could see the Trump administration saying, well, is this democracy thing really something that the American people should be in the business of? South Korea is not really putting up a really good argument for that right now. 
 
HUNT: Kristen Soltis Anderson, how do you look at what Josh is talking about here, especially with Trump coming in? 
 
KRISTEN SOLTIS ANDERSON, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, I think - I mean yesterday, if you were watching the coverage minute by minute, it was - you were wondering, is the system going to hold, right? You had the parliament there in South Korea voting to undo the martial law. But you had the military right there at the building. And this was a case, as he mentions, that the system held. 
 
You know, I'm - I'm a little bit dismissive of the idea that Donald Trump being elected democratically is a threat to democracy. I feel like that gets talked about a lot. But we do need strong institutions to ensure that anybody who's in power, certainly any executive, does not have power and does have - does have the ability for their power to be checked, I should say, by other parts of the government. 
 
HUNT: Yes. 
 
ROGIN: It's not completely ridiculous because Donald Trump, the first time he was president, tried to use the military in ways that were unprecedented in American democracy. So, it's not crazy to think that he might try to do that again. And President Yoon was democratically elected, too, and he just tried to pull off a military dictatorship.
 
So, you know, I don't think it's something that we can dismiss. I think it's actually something I think that Trump - Donald Trump himself has thought about a lot. So, we should look out for it. 
 
HUNT: All right, Josh Rogin, thanks very much for being here this morning. Really appreciate it. 
 
ROGIN: Any time.
 
HUNT: All right, 48 minutes past the hour. Here's your morning roundup.
 
In just a few hours, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments over a transgender care ban in Tennessee. The Biden administration sued the state over the ban, which prohibits parents from seeking gender affirming care for their children. Roughly two dozen similar bans have also been passed in Republican-led states.
 
Donald Trump's pick to run the FBI, targeted by Iranian hackers. Sources tell CNN that Kash Patel was recently told by the bureau that he was targeted. One source says they believe hackers accessed at least some of Patel's communications.
 
Deliberations resume this morning at 10:00 a.m. Eastern in the manslaughter trial of Daniel Penny. Penny is a former Marine accused of killing 30 year old street artist Jordan Neely by putting him in a chokehold on a New York City subway car. Prosecutors allege he acted recklessly, while his defense argues he was protecting others from a threat.
 <br>[06:50:02]
 
President-elect Donald Trump is doubling down on a joke he made to Canada's prime minister last week. Sources tell CNN, during a discussion over tariffs with Justin Trudeau, Trump told him that Canada should become the 51st state if the move would harm their economy. Trump is now posting about that joke, including this AI generated image of him next to the Canadian flag, with the caption, "Oh Canada."
 
OK. All right, let's turn now to this. In just a few hours, executives from five major airlines are set to testify on Capitol Hill about so- called junk fees. A recent congressional report revealed that from 2018 to 2023 five U.S. airlines made more than $12 billion just on seat selection fees. Last year, United Airlines charged as much as $319 for extra legroom, while Spirit Airlines charges as much as $299. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT): The airlines are relying more and more on these junk fees as a source of revenue, and they are obscuring them. Very often you, as a passenger, won't know how much you're being charged until after you buy the ticket. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT: All right, our panel is back. 
 
Mark Preston, you fly a lot for work. These fees have gotten like crazy right? I mean the - the sticker, when you look at, you know, hey, I want to fly on Delta Airlines on a basic economy fare, from where you get to - from that fare to actually getting on the airplane, and forget even sitting together with your family necessarily. Sometimes they don't even guarantee that.
 
MARK PRESTON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: OK, I don't want - I certainly don't want the bosses to be watching right now because yesterday I booked flights for the holidays. And, like, it literally, I'm not kidding you, it took me about three hours to figure it out. And I'm not a good consumer for the airlines because I will try to find the best fare possible, much to the chagrin of my children, who expect to be, you know - you know, feeded (ph) to first class for gosh sakes.
 
HUNT: They want you to pay for that extra leg room.
 
PRESTON: And I'm like, let's go on Spirit. Even if it is bankrupt, let's go. 
 
But - no, but it is expensive. I was - I was shocked at, not only how expensive it was, but how the ledger - like how the fees added up. And I was like, wow, that's - that's ridiculous. 
 
HUNT: Kristen, how do you think Americans feel about the airlines and all of this? And does that - I mean clearly the Biden administration, Pete Buttigieg, have made this a huge priority, right, like passengers bill of rights, kind of making it easier for you to get money - claw your money back from the airlines in all of these different ways. 
 
Now that said, it is actually a tough business as well and we need the airlines to be able to function accordingly. But where are Americans on this? 
 
ANDERSON: Yes, I mean the difference is that, if you have a policy that is forcing the airlines to uphold their end of the bargain, right? If they promise you a service, and that service isn't delivered, the ability to somehow get your money back, that's something that's pretty popular. 
 
But the reason why these airlines do this isn't because consumers hate it, right? They're still in a market where they're trying to compete with other airlines. Delta is still competing with a Spirit or something like that. And you have some customers that say, you know what, fine, stick me in the overhead bin, I don't need a bag, I don't need legroom. Give me a fare that's $30. And so the idea of these - they're calling them junk fees, but the airlines always push back and say, this is really about making sure that that person that doesn't care about legroom, doesn't want to bring on a bag, if they want a super cheap fare, they can get it. But then you, as the consumer, who wants a normal flying experience, it does look worse for you in the cart.
 
But I view this more as something that companies should be deciding, what do customers want? And if customers find these fees to be obnoxious, then surely some airline is going to figure out, just charge a flat fee. Don't do it that way. And they'll benefit in the market. 
 
MEGHAN HAYS, FORMER BIDEN WHITE HOUSE DIRECTOR OF MESSAGE PLANNING: Yes, this is a supply and demand thing, right? Like, people are paying for more legroom. Like, I will pay for more legroom where someone else might not. And so this is a supply and demand. They wouldn't be doing this if consumers were not participating. 
 
PRESTON: Yes, but - but the problem is though, through all of this it's not just that - that we perceive these as junk fees. It's the whole industry. You know, you go to the airport. You have to be there how many hours early? Then you get there and then, oh, by the way, the airline doesn't tell you that, you know, you're delayed three hours. Oh, by the way, by the end of the night, we have no flights. You know, so, there is this anger at the industry because we are reliant upon it to actually move around. I mean in many ways they have a monopoly because I mean it's - it's either the airlines that are in the sky that are flying or like get on a bus. 
 
ALEX THOMPSON, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: But to Kristen's point, the fact that we're now all calling them junk fees has actually been a sign of like the Biden administration's success at labeling these things. I mean they're just fees. But the fact that they're junk fees has really caught on in a political way, and that's why you're going to see them on Capitol Hill. 
 
HUNT: I would just say that if they could start charging for your carry-ons, I think I might like that better so that, like, everyone could just put their stuff underneath the plane instead of us having to wait while everyone jams a suitcase - I mean I am guilty of this, OK, like jamming the overfilled suitcase in the bin. I don't know.
 
THOMPSON: Kasie for president.
 
HUNT: My personal pet peeve. All right, let's turn now to this. This has emerged as a top priority
 
 for Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy's, newly formed Department of Government Efficiency.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's 10:00 a.m. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You didn't set your watch forward.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Happy Daylight Savings Time. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Saving -
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, shit. Daylight Savings Time is today?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Saving. And it started yesterday. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. Speaker, Daylight Saving, not plural, time has never saved us from anything.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT: What's the pet project of Veep's Jonah Ryan (ph), Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy have set their eyes on Daylight Saving, not plural, as they look to cut government inefficiencies. And now their effort may have some bipartisan support. Democratic Congressman Jared Moskowitz becoming the first Democrat to say he will join the new DOGE caucus, intended to support Musk and Ramaswamy's department.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. JARED MOSKOWITZ (D-FL): I'm sure there's going to be things that Elon and Vivek are going to come up with that I'm vehemently going to disagree on. And I will make sure that I'm a loud voice voting against that stuff. But we got to go to where the conversations are happening. And the idea that we're not going to go to these places and just pretend the conversations aren't happening is not a way to conduct business here. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT: So, we've done junk fees. Now, where are we on Daylight Saving Time, Alex?
 
THOMPSON: I mean, watch, they're also going to have - say that we should go back - we should go to the metric system next. I feel like that's going to be the - their next thing. I think you're going to see, just like Elon Musk and Vivek, you're going to see a bajillion ideas thrown against the wall, and you're going to see what sticks. 
 
PRESTON: Yes, but I do think that the Daylight Saving Time thing is something that might happen. They almost got it through the last Congress, didn't they? It was - it had a bipartisan push behind it, and it kind of died at the end. 
 
HUNT: Well, so we tried it back in the 1970s, right, permanent Daylight Saving Time - Saving Time, and nobody liked it, right? So, I personally would be miserable if it was Daylight Saving all the time. Now, granted, that's because I do this like very, very early shift, right? Standard time is much preferable to me. 
 
But, I mean, Kristen, do you think this is something that would actually happen? I mean there's an economic argument around permanent Daylight Saving Time. But again, for actual human beings, it's another thing. 
 
ANDERSON: Well, and add to that the fact that if you have little kids, getting them to bed at a strange hour that they don't totally understand is also not a lot of fun. 
 
But I do like in the summer that - that the sun is out longer. I think there's a higher likelihood that this happens than that we change to the metric system. I certainly cannot imagine a Trump administration cowing to our European allies and giving them the metric system. 
 
HUNT: Yes. Well, so speaking of - the children have problems. You know who else has problems with Daylight Savings Time? Dogs. Let's - let's look at this, OK. This has become a whole thing on TikTok, like, what happens to your dog on Daylight Savings Time. 
 
Watch.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Sally, you already ate your dinner. You asked for it during lunch today. Are you confused with the time change? You already ate today. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's not dinner time. It's only 4.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT: Worst day of his life. 
 
ANDERSON: My dog thinks it's dinner time at 3:00 p.m. every day anyways.
 
HAYS: I know.
 
ANDERSON: So, this is not relevant because he always thinks it's dinnertime. 
 
HUNT: What do you think? 
 
HAYS: I mean, I think that when the - when major newspapers say we don't know if this is a joke or not when they are talking about that just shows that like maybe DOGE isn't going to be the most serious thing and that there are probably other things in efficiency besides Daylight Saving Time that we could be talking about right now, but what do I know? HUNT: Yes. Well, I have - I'm not sure I actually knew it wasn't
 
 Daylight Savings Time until today in this script. Thanks, Jonah Ryan, for teaching me that.
 
All right, I'll leave you with this. The YMCA taking another turn in the spotlight.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's fun to stay at the YMCA. It's fun to stay at the YMCA.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT: President-elect Donald Trump turned the song into his unofficial anthem on the campaign trail. He played it at rally after rally.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENT-ELECT: But "YMCA" gets people up and it gets them moving. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT: Village People founding member Victor Willis tells CNN his group received thousands of complaints from people over Trump's use of the song since 2020, and they wanted them to bar Trump's using it. But now Willis says he had a change of heart. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VICTOR WILLIS, VILLAGE PEOPLE, FOUNDING MEMBER: I noticed that Trump actually likes the song. And that he really seems to have a lot of fun with it. 
 
And that was our reason, and my reason for allowing him to continue to use it because he really just likes "YMCA," like so many other people do. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT: Among those people, how about the world's richest man, Elon Musk, who was seen dancing to the song alongside Trump during Thanksgiving dinner last week in Mar-a-Lago. It really has, Alex, become kind of like now the "YMCA" is so deeply associated with Trump.
 
THOMPSON: Yes, and you're seeing football players do the dance in the end zone. And just the - the, you know, I'm not going to do it, but it's - 
 
(CROSS TALK)
 
HUNT: Well, you do it?
 
PRESTON: This is it, right? I mean that's how he does it. But, I mean, doesn't it make you like - it reminds you of like a bad '90s wedding when he starts doing the dance and then people - you know, and the crowd start doing it. It's -
 <br>[07:00:08]
 
HUNT: It - it definitely evokes wedding but, you know, it's become a cultural thing.
 
ANDERSON: Yes. Does this mean we're going to see the Electric Slide next if '90s wedding is the vibe we're going for here.
 
PRESTON: Oh, that's just terrible. Terrible. The Macarena.
 
ANDERSON: I mean wasn't -
 
HAYS: Yes.
 
ANDERSON: But you know what the other song that I like, I think - wasn't "Tiny Dancer" a big part of his rallies earlier on or that's - that's a song he really likes? I'm very pro-Elton John.
 
HUNT: The soundtrack at Trump events is actually quite varied and different from any other Republican candidates, who mostly used to stick to country music. 
 
Anyway, we're out of time. Guys, thanks very much for joining me today. Thanks to all of you at home for being with us as well. I'm Kasie Hunt. Don't go anywhere. "CNN NEWS CENTRAL starts right now.</pre>
