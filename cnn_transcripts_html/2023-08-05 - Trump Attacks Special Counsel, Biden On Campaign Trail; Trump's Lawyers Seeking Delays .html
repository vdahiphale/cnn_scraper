VICTOR BLACKWELL, CNN ANCHOR: Good morning. Welcome to CNN this morning, a fresh start to your weekend. We thank you for starting with us. I'm Victor Blackwell.
 
AMARA WALKER, CNN ANCHOR: I'm Amara Walker. Thank you so much for sharing a part of your morning with us. The fight between the special counsel and Donald Trump is heating up why -- why the Special Counsel is calling on the Judge in the January 6 case to take action after a social media post by the former president. 
 
BLACKWELL: This was crazy in New York City. Look at these pictures. There was some violence but a lot of chaos after a social media influencer posted about a giveaway and now that influencer is facing charges.
 
WALKER: And Simone Biles gets ready for a comeback after taking a break from the sport. We will have the latest on tonight's competition. 
 
We begin with this late-night Court filing from Special Counsel Jack Smith. He is now asking a Federal Judge to quickly set disclosure rules in the January 6 case against former President Donald Trump. In the filing, Smith cited this social media post from Trump earlier in the day that reads, "If you go after me, I'm coming after you."
 
BLACKWELL: Trump's campaign defended the post as the definition of political speech and said it had nothing to do with the case. Smith wants the Judge to bar Trump from receiving copies of sensitive evidence from his attorneys out of concern he may publicly disclose that information as he's done before. But Trump's legal troubles have not eroded his support within the Republican Party.
 
WALKER: In fact, some think, he can turn each indictment into his advantage. CNN Kristen Holmes has more.
 
KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning Amara and Victor. Well, former President Donald Trump airing a list of grievances on Friday night while talking to the Alabama Republican Party. And this was a very receptive crowd. He said that if he were elected President again, the first day in office, you would appoint a special prosecutor to continue the work Congress was doing, looking into investigating the Biden family. He also claimed that's less because he was doing well was seeking rabid Democratic left-wing lawyers on him and also claimed that these charges were only brought because he was leading in the polls. 
 
Now one thing to keep in mind is that this is the playbook for these indictments, for these charges, these arraignments. We have seen time and time again and it's not going to stop. They are claiming, Trump and his team, that this is election interference. And this is something they believe that they can sell to voters. Now particularly they believe this, as we ramp up campaign season. They point to the fact that he is the front-runner. But on top of that, that there is a time in which these trials will interfere with the campaign. 
 
Now, I have spoken to a number of Republican voters and there are quite a few who agree with the fact that this could actually impact the election of believing this narrative that Trump is spinning. So clearly something that is working there for them among the voters that I'm talking to in the Republican Party. But they are going to continue saying that this is fully political, ignoring the legalities, and at least trying to play this out in the court of public opinion. Amara and Victor.
 
WALKER: Kristen Holmes, thank you. Now with each new indictment, Trump's Court and campaign calendars become more complicated. CNNs Jessica Schneider has more on that angle.
 
JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Victor and Amara, things are already moving very quickly in this latest criminal case against the former President. So the special counsel's team, they have to submit their recommendations for a trial start date next week on August 10th. After that, Trump's legal team will then have seven days to respond. And they've already said they will definitely be pushing back against any rush to trial. So the Speedy Trial Act, it does say that a trial should happen 70 days after a defendant appears in Court so 70 days from Thursday. But Trump's team really can move to have that date pushed back which is very likely. 
 
Trump's Attorney, John Lauro, did tell the judge on Thursday that in his view, there was just way too much evidence to sift through in this 2020 election case to move fast toward a trial date. And, of course, part of the Trump legal playbook has been delay, delay, delay, so we can expect that to likely continue. 
 
Now as for Trump, he did rail against the prosecution on the tarmac at the D.C. airport after his arraignment saying that it was all political, part of the Biden administration's plan to thwart his 2024 bid. And, of course, he was back on the campaign trail just hours later speaking to Republicans. 
 <br>[08:05:11]
 
And there is more legal trouble for the former President. It really could be looming in the next couple of weeks. That's when we're expecting action from the District Attorney in Atlanta, Georgia. That could mean more charges against Trump related to his and his ally's attempts to overturn the election results in Georgia. So a lot of legal trouble looming for the former President and it all continues to unfold as we move forward. Victor and Amara.
 
BLACKWELL: Jessica Schneider reporting for us there. Thank you so much. Joining me now is Tim Naftali, CNN Presidential Historian and former Director of the Nixon Presidential Library. 
 
Tim it's been a minute. It's good to see you again on a Saturday morning. So other Presidents have been accused --
 
TIM NAFTALI, CNN PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN: Yes. Good to see you too, Victor. 
 
BLACKWELL: Trump is now charged with -- with dozens of counts, put this and especially this last week into some perspective for us.
 
NAFTALI: Well, this last week, Donald J. Trump was the first former President to be indicted for actions he committed while being President. Richard Nixon expected to be indicted. In 1974, Richard Nixon actually spoke with a member of the White House who had actually already gone to prison for crimes associated with the Watergate scandals and asked him what was it like to be in prison because Richard Nixon fully expected to be in prison. So this is a -- this is not the first time that a president has contemplated the possibility of prison. But it's the first time that it's a possible reality now. 
 
Richard Nixon, as we remember, was pardoned so he never faced an indictment. That's a -- it's a big moment for the United States because this is not a small case. This is a case about whether the President of the United States is responsible when he undertakes any illegal campaign to stay in office. The President will argue that he got advice and he followed the advice. But when that advice is illegal, as was the advice from these six un-indicted co-conspirators listed in the indictment, the President ultimately is responsible for the actions he takes. As Truman said the buck stops here. 
 
So Donald Trump may say that he believed one thing. But what he was doing was illegal. And he had many members of his inner circle telling him it was illegal, the false -- the false elector scheme, the -- the statements -- the public statements that were based on an actual fraud themselves. All of these are acts, which the President must be held accountable for. And that's what this indictment does.
 
BLACKWELL: Yes. You know, you bring up the Nixon example. After Nixon resigned, he was pardoned, and the party and the country tried to move on, move past him. Trump is now a candidate, obviously, for President and the front-runner in the state and in the national polls for the nomination. Is there any precedent for a former President to have -- be engaged in even scandal and then hold on to viability the way that Trump has?
 
NAFTALI: But let's keep in mind that we have had a few instances in our history where demagogues have held sway over the emotions of many Americans, whether it was Huey Long in the 1930s in Louisiana, George Wallace in the 1960s and early 1970s, throughout various parts of the United States, or Joseph McCarthy, perhaps the most famous of the three in the 1950s. We are not immune to the seductiveness of demo -- demagogues who appeal to certain emotions, certain prejudices in our society. This is not new. So it is not a surprise that millions of Americans have still an emotional attachment to Donald Trump who's made them feel that they share victimhood with him. But the key here, Victor, is that our institutions of justice are moving forward. 
 
Donald Trump may argue that this is political. But if you read this indictment and read the documents indictment, you will see that they would have gone forward, the grand juries would have gone forward with these indictments regardless of the fact that Donald Trump tried again for the White House. You know, Donald Trump is the one who made this political by running for office again. I'm not saying he didn't have a right to of course, he had a right to run for office again. But these indictments would have happened anyway. And so the fact that they're political is actually Donald Trump's fault.
 
BLACKWELL: Let's turn to the politics now and that race for the nomination. The opponent who was closest, although not very close at all, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has not offered have a full- throated criticism of the former President's actions in the way that former governor ASA Hutchinson and former Governor Chris Christie have. I want you to listen to what he said about these latest charges and generally the lies about the 2020 election from the former President. This is yesterday in Iowa.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
RON DESANTIS, FLORIDA GOVERNOR: As I've said many times, the election is what it is. All those theories that were put out did not prove to be true. But not an election that was conducted the way I think we want to. But that's different than saying like Maduro stole votes or something like that. And I think those theories, you know, prove to be unsubstantiated.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
BLACKWELL: What do you hear there? Again, he's not given the full- throated what Trump did, or what Trump said was a lie. It's like, well, we never proved his -- his claims.
 
NAFTALI: Well, I see a shift. I hear a shift. The -- Ron DeSantis is no longer pushing the idea that -- that there was significant fraud in the 2020 election. He is telling his supporters who are in a sense, part of the Mogga (ph) wing of the Republican Party that, you know, Biden won the 2020 election. So it's just a minor shift. But I would say that the person who is the reason why we're seeing a shift among Republicans is Vice President -- former Vice President Pence. I think Vice President Pence has that -- has not only the moral right but the historical right to set the record straight. And he's been very clear since this latest indictment about President Trump's responsibility for the chaos that we saw in January of 2021. 
 
So it's going to be very interesting to see the recalibration by the other Republican putative nominees as they absorb the effect of this indictment. This indictment is damning. It is also a reminder to the American people that they were the victims of a fraud but it was not an electoral fraud in five different states. It was a national fraud perpetrated from the White House, at least that's the allegation. The indictment is very clear though in making that argument, we'll see what a jury of President Trump's peers decided at the end.
 
BLACKWELL: Yes. And we're a couple of weeks out from that first debate. We'll see first if Trump shows and second, if any of his opponents become more assertive in their criticism of the former President. Tim Naftali, thanks so much.
 
WALKER: Police have arrested 65 people in New York City, at least 30 of them juveniles after a video game giveaway spiraled into complete chaos. 
 
This was for a free video game console. A -- a crowd of thousands showed up for that giveaway in Manhattan on Friday. It was organized by social media influencer and Twitch star Kai Cenat. Apparently, there were no giveaways and the crowd quickly turned into a violent mob. CNNs Polo Sandoval joining us now live from New York with more. 
 
I mean, it's just incredible and stunning to watch --
 
POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hey Amara. 
 
WALKER: -- and just walk us through how things unfolded. And what's the latest on this investigation?
 
SANDOVAL: And also stunning that night and day difference that we've seen yesterday and today as city officials have been working really through the night to reestablish a sense of normalcy. Here in the heart of Manhattan as you mentioned there, things quickly spiraling out of control. In fact, this is quite telling. Just last night, the Chief of Department of the NYPD saying that at one point, they only had about 300 kids, and that quickly turned to several thousand in only minutes. And the result, as you point out was complete chaos that unfolded. 
 
This was a virtual sea of people. And the only reminders of what took place here some -- some paint that's been splattered on the floor here. Of course, that might be the next stage of cleanup at one point. These children -- these young people hurling bottles and rocks and not just police but civilians. And also you see this temporary construction wall that was erected here. That was taken down by the people who were involved in a lot of those could that construction material coming from there. 
 
About three officers injured, about four civilians also hurt yesterday. We understand that about half of the 65 people who have been detained are juveniles. I want you to hear directly from the NYPD last night as they issued a plea, not just for parents to get involved, but also for social media influencers. They know that they certainly can play a potential role in these kinds of mobs that took place here yesterday.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JEFFREY MADDREY, NEW YORK CITY POLICE CHIEF: They, you know, we have
 
 to reach out to some of our influences. And ask them they'll be responsible with this, to help us with this. I'm not against young people coming here. If we knew about this, we could have the barriers out here. We could have police officers out here. We could have did this orderly.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 <br>[08:15:14]
 
SANDOVAL: As for that social media influencer police saying that they have charged him or at least plan to charge him with inciting a riot and also holding an unlawful assembly. Guys.
 
WALKER: That response from the crowds was -- was incredible and thank goodness that police were able to get a handle on this, just really stunning stuff. Thank you so much Polo Sandoval. 
 
Up next, Bidenomics are working. That is the message from the White House after Friday's jobs reports but do Americans feel the same?
 
BLACKWELL: Plus Biles is back. Today one of the greatest gymnasts of all time returns to competition for the first time since the Tokyo Olympics.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[08:20:00]
 
BLACKWELL: The U.S. economy added 187,000 jobs in July. Another sign that the red-hot jobs market continues to cool just a bit. The numbers suggest the economy may finally be hitting that sweet spot the Fed has been seeking, the so-called Goldilocks principle, not too hot, not too cool.
 
WALKER: Get it? You know, the porridge was not too hot and not too cold. But it was hot for her, wasn't it? OK, I'm confused. 
 
CNN reporter, Matt Egan. He's a closer like, what are you talking about, at the numbers and what they say about the state of the U.S. economy.
 
MATT EGAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Victor and Amara, this looks like another Goldilocks jobs report. Too hot would have inflamed inflation and too cold, of course, would have revived those recession fears. This report looks just about right. Employers added 187,000 jobs in July. It's a bit below expectations. It's also the second slowest pace of job growth since late 2020. But make no mistake, this is a very healthy number, especially given the historic job gains during this recovery. And the economy has now added 1.8 million jobs so far this year. 
 
The unemployment rate continues to also defy those recession forecasts. You know many economists even ones at the Federal Reserve predicted that the unemployment rate would gradually rise this year and yet it remains historically low dipping to 3.5 percent in July. That is just a touch above the half-century low of 3.4 percent. Moody's Analysts, Chief Economist Mark Zandi described the jobs report as down the middle of the fairway couldn't have been much better. 
 
Now there's one catch here, there always is, wages. Wages remain a bit hot. Of course, that's great news for workers and more evidence that workers have considerable leverage over bosses. In fact, paychecks are now growing faster than prices and that is huge. But strong wage growth is not really what Jerome Powell and his colleagues at the Fed wants to see. They want wages to cool even further to help drive inflation down. S
 
till, big picture. There's a lot to like about this jobs report. It's just one more indicator that supports a growing sense that the soft landing many thought was basically impossible might just be happening. Victor, Amara.
 
WALKER: All right, Matt, thank you. Let's get some insight now from CNN Global Economic Analyst, Rana Foroohar. She's a Global Business Columnist and Associate Editor for The Financial Times. 
 
Good morning, Rana. So let's start with those job numbers, 187,000 jobs added in July. Do you agree with those who say this is a Goldilocks report, being just right, and what does this mean for a potential soft landing in your opinion?
 
RANA FOROOHAR, CNN GLOBAL ECONOMICS ANALYST: Right. You know, I would completely agree with the analysis as we just heard. I mean, it really doesn't get much better than this in this particular point of a -- of a recovery cycle. 
 
You know, I would have expected, frankly, the economy to have been in a recession. You know, there -- there are a lot of reasons for that. But I think what happened is, we got COVID, we got a lot of fiscal stimulus being poured into the economy. We got those checks to consumers, you know, those still haven't been spent down fully, largely, but not completely. 
 
So you have an administration that in some ways, was bailing out people this time around rather than bailing out banks, like we did in 2008 the last time we had a big crisis. And I think that that has really stuck. You know, there are other factors here. We're seeing the reindustrialization of America, which is creating jobs. You know, you've seen really a lot of tightening at the lower end of the wage scale because of such tight job markets and leisure, you know, restaurants, things like that. That's, again, due to the aftermath of the pandemic. But the bottom line is, this is a pretty great jobs report, and we are in a Goldilocks moment.
 
WALKER: OK. Then, if that's the case, you know, why is there a disconnect between what's happening in reality versus you know, how Americans are polling? I mean, it seems that, you know, people are quite pessimistic about the economy.
 
FOROOHAR: You know, and I have to say, Amara, I am really baffled by some of these polls. My best guess is that, let's face it, we know that despite all the good news, we are living in a kind of a two America's economy, right? You know, if you own a home, if you have a job, if you have some assets, maybe in the form of a 401-K, you're feeling pretty good about things. 
 
On the other hand, maybe if you were struggling before the last few years, you're still struggling. These are structural problems in our economy that have been with us for a long time. And there are things coming down the pipe, like for example, artificial intelligence, that's going to disrupt a lot of jobs, you know, some lower level white collar jobs in particular. So even though we're seeing a lot of good news and I think we've seen an administration that has been really vector really quite on smart about how it's handling the economy, there are still big structural challenges around things like inequality diversity of skills, student debt, things like this that are -- that are that are looming. So I think that that's kind of what's behind the -- the more negative feelings in polls.
 <br>[08:25:16]
 
WALKER: Yes, a lot of context behind it that -- that hat makes sense, Rana. Thanks for that, you know. So on Tuesday, Fitch's downgraded the U.S. debt rating from the highest triple A to double A plus. And, you know, there was a lot of blowback, at least from government officials, including Janet Yellen, who said that she strongly disagreed with the downgrade, saying that it was based on outdated and arbitrary data. Of course, the White House was quick to condemn it as well. But I mean, you know, what are your thoughts on that? Do you think that U.S. deserved this downgrade? I mean, especially when you consider yes, the U.S. has the highest national debt. And on top of that, we've seen the drama play out year after year where Congress gets, you know, right to the brink of defaulting on its debt obligations.
 
FOROOHAR: Well, you know, in some ways, Janet Yellen is right. But she's also pointing to something important. When she says that Fitch is looking at outdated data, well, outdated in the sense that, yes, we've had years of seeing Congress tiptoe up to the debt limit, you know, the entire world is on tenterhooks, because the U.S. dollar is so important. This has been multiple times that we've seen this happening. So yes, it's not new. That's true. 
 
Ratings agencies, you know, it's not a science, let's face it, and they make plenty of mistakes as again, as we know, from the great financial crisis. But I am concerned about the U.S. debt and deficit picture, no question. I mean, right now, the U.S. is in a Goldilocks moment, particularly relative to the rest of the world. China's having a huge financial challenge right now, a lot of debt there, Europe has kind of met in terms of its recovery. So the U.S. is still the prettiest house on the block. 
 
Now at some point that changes and when that changes, the debt and deficit picture becomes more important at a national level, at an international level in the markets. You could see a sell-off in treasuries. You could see a debasing of the U.S. dollar, and that's something that folks that are holding most of their money in dollars should be thinking about.
 
WALKER: Rana Foroohar, we'll leave it there. Thank you.
 
BLACKWELL: Just ahead, Ukraine ramps up its attacks at sea. The country targets an oil tanker just days after attacking a Russian warship.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[08:31:23]
 
WALKER: To Russia's war on Ukraine and the latest now attack in the Black Sea.
 
BLACKWELL: Ukraine struck one of Russia's biggest oil tankers and an overnight attack. A source tells CNN that a sea drone carrying almost half a ton of explosives struck the ship. Russia says that the ship was not carrying an oil while Ukrainian sources it was full. 
 
Ukraine, a security service source told CNN that hit was carried out in a joint operation with Ukrainian Navy and the attack came just hours after Ukrainian see drones targeted a coastal naval base striking a Russian warship.
 
WALKER: CNN's Nada Bashir joining us now with more. Nada, what do we know about these sea drone attacks and what the strategy is behind them?
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER: Well, look, in terms of the strategy, Amara, we've heard from Ukrainian authorities. They say this is a logical and effective next step in their continued counteroffensive, which we know has been going slower than was anticipated. 
 
And the warning that we've been hearing from Ukrainian authorities is that these attacks that we're seeing against Russian targets will continue as long as there are Russian forces in Ukrainian waters, and on Ukrainian land. 
 
And in fact, just in the last few hours, Ukrainian authorities have issued coastal warnings for several Russian ports to shipping company saying that these are conflict risk areas, so we can anticipate from these signals from the Ukrainian authorities that we will continue to see further attacks. 
 
And in fact, we've heard from the head of Ukraine's -- the secretary of Ukraine's national security and defense council in the last few hours, he's commented on these attacks, he says that the drone attacks are growing more accurate, and their operators with each combat mission are becoming more experienced. 
 
And the focus now for the Ukrainian Armed Forces is really to expand the scale and the range of their targeting of Russian physicians, both in the Black Sea and of course on land and that they want to expand on the scale and the level and severity of those Russian losses. And that is certainly what we have seen over the last few days not only in those attacks on the Black Sea and around Russian ports, but we've even seen drone attacks around occupied Crimea and of course, southwest of Moscow just in the last few days. BLACKWELL: All right, Nada Bashir with this live from London. Nada, thank you so much.
 
WALKER: All right. To Niger now, what military leaders from the coup last week are warning of retaliation of other West African countries try to intervene.
 
BLACKWELL: The regional bloc known as ECOWAS was has already given Sunday deadline for the reinstatement of Niger's ousted president. But concerns are growing over protests countrywide, and that the political crisis could escalate into a wider conflict. CNN's Stephanie Busari is joining us now from Lagos -- Lagos, Nigeria. Stephanie, what is the latest there?
 
STEPHANIE BUSARI, CNN AFRICA SENIOR EDITOR: So we are just hearing from the military chiefs, the ECOWAS military chiefs who have spent the last three days in intense planning meetings, mapping out what a military intervention could look like. And they are at the end of this three days, which was on Friday, they prepared a report to the heads of states of this 15 body bloc that make up ECOWAS, and then they once the deadline passes, then we're led to believe that they will start some form of military intervention, which we're not clear yet what that could be. 
 
So, the ECOWAS military chief, spoke yesterday at Nigeria's Catholic You're in Abuja. 
 <br>[08:35:00]
 
Take a listen to what he has to say. ECOWAS will not be used for coups. Democracy is what we stand for. And democracy is what we will sustain. We must intensify our diplomatic efforts to engage with all relevant stakeholders. That's Nigeria's Chief of Defense Staff, and the President of ECOWAS committee, General Christopher Musa.
 
At the one hand is talking about this no nonsense approach to the coups. But at the same time, there is hope that they are trying to keep the talks going and engaged in what the ECOWAS region is calling preventative diplomacy. 
 
So -- but this is at the backdrop of people in Niger protesting against this body and saying that they're not going to -- they're not going to allow them to come in and just take over and planning military intervention.
 
WALKER: There have been, Stephanie, some massive protests in support of the military, what is the status of those protests?
 
BUSARI: Sure, they're ongoing, they're ongoing. The truth of the matter is that this is an extremely poor country, one of the poorest in the world, which receives about $2 billion a year in aid from the U.S. and other allies. And the people just did not see change, regardless of who is in power. 
 
So President Bozoum was elected in 2021. But people are saying, we're still suffering. Our country is rich. We have uranium and other resources. But these things not trickle down to us. And so when the military has taken over, they see hope. They see as a sign of change, and that things might get better for them. So that's the context in which we're seeing these protests. Amara.
 
WALKER: All right, a fraught situation there. Stephanie Busari, thank you. Well, coming up, the world's best our center stage at the Women's World Cup but for some the dream of representing their country was cut short because of an injury that has become all too common for some women.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[08:41:39]
 
WALKER: Simone Biles is set to make her much anticipated return to gymnastics tonight at the core hydration classic just outside of Chicago.
 
BLACKWELL: Biles has not competed in the past two years after she suffered a case of the twisties at the Tokyo Games. And the twist is a mental block that cause athletes to -- cause his athletes to lose control or get lost in the air. Biles looked like her dominant self yesterday though in practice competing. All those signature moves exciting. 
 
WALKER: Exciting.
 
BLACKWELL: Overnight, Spain and Japan advanced to the quarterfinals at the Women's World Cup. Japan will now face the winner between the U.S. and Sweden. The two teams will play against each other tomorrow morning. 
 
WALKER: But as these women geared up for some of the biggest games of their lives, some athletes are unable to compete because of ACL injuries. CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta examines why women are more at risk.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): North Carolina Courage midfielder Meredith Speck started the season off on the right foot. But like so many other professional players, you've been hearing about an injury brought it to a halt. 
 
Now, what will surprise you is that for nearly all these women, it's been the same injury. And many have been going through what you're about to see with Meredith.
 
MEREDITH SPECK, NORTH CAROLINA COURAGE: It's a weird situation. Even though you know it's a surgery and it's nine months of your career like it is a big deal.
 
GUPTA: Today, Speck is getting her anterior cruciate ligament or ACL repair. You've probably heard that term before. But let me show you. It's this ligament right here that runs diagonally in your knee from the outside of your femur to the inside of your tibia. It's what helps players do this lateral movement, and it's an injury
 
 now that has become almost synonymous with soccer. But remarkably more so among women. 
 
GUPTA (on camera): 10 players or so are out of the World Cup because of these ACL injuries. 
 
HOLLY SILVERS-GRANELLI, MLS RESEARCH CHAIR: Yes.
 
GUPTA: That's pretty staggering number. Does that surprise you?
 
SILVERS-GRANELLI: Yes. But we do know that women's risk is higher. So the NCAA data indicates that the risk for women is about three to four fold her male counterpart.
 
GUPTA (voiceover): Holly Silvers-Grenelli is the chair of Major League Soccer's Medical Assessment Research Committee. And this is a disparity she's been trying to draw attention to for decades. 
 
GUPTA (on camera): What is going on?
 
SILIVERS-GRANELLI: We started looking at this data literally 23 years ago. We had determined that there's anatomic risk factors, that's hormonal risk factors. There's environmental risk factors which would take into consideration are you playing on grass or turf or what type of cleat you're wearing.
 
GUPTA (voiceover): The anatomy is also pretty fascinating. For starters, women's ACLs, they're just smaller than men's. But look over here. Women also have a greater cue angle. That's the ratio of hip width to thigh length, which basically means this can happen. The body can more easily go into a knock kneed position, making the ligament more vulnerable. 
 
GUPTA (on camera): Just standing here. How are we different in terms of our biomechanics?
 
SILVERS-GRANELLI: We know that women tend to be a little bit more quad dominant, we tend to be a little bit less underdeveloped on our back muscle groups. Also when we tend to do things we tend to do things more upright every react than men do. Yeah.
 <br>[08:45:03]
 
GUPTA (voiceover): Easy fixes for anyone, Holly says, an extra 10 minutes twice a week to reduce ACL injuries by around 70 percent.
 
SILVERS-GRANNELI: If we were running, and we were go to the side, we would plant and cut and change direction plant and cut.
 
GUPTA: The idea of strengthen the muscles around the ACL. Play low and avoid the knock knee position.
 
SILVERS-GRANELLI: This is engaging these muscles, which is your glute medius. And that's a massively great muscle to help control your lumbar spine and your pelvis when you're cutting and changing direction. So this is called a Nordic hamstring. 
 
GUPTA (on camera): Yes.
 
SILVERS-GRANELLI: Yes, it's very hard. You'll feel your hamstrings engaged. 
 
GUPTA: Yes. I do.

BRIAN MADDOX, HEAD ATHLETIC TRAINER, NORTH CAROLINA COURAGE: You're sort of watching movement for quality of movement, whether it looks natural, where, you know, they look like they're not in control of what their body is doing.
 
GUPTA: And he says this is the type of attention and training that needs to start among the youngest players.
 
MADDOX: One of the biggest preexisting risk for an injury is if you've had that injury before. So I think that's why the emphasis on trying to prevent this at a younger age. So when they come to us and they're ready to format the level we expect them to perform.

JEANIE CHANG, LICENSED MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPIST: Stress is a part of life. Burnout not necessarily so. I was in journalism. I actually loved it. But the bottom line is I wasn't managing my stress. I was ignoring it. So even in my early 20s, I went into burnout and left the field.
 <br>[08:55:00] You can love what you do but go into burnout because you're not managing your stress effectively. Stress is where you're very overwhelmed. And you're also still believe it or not hopeful that you can change that. We're burnout, you're more hopeless. 
 
You lost interest in the things you used to enjoy. You don't feel like you're valued at work, you're doing too much or not feeling challenged. 
 
No one's immune to burnout. So the best way is to manage our stress each day. What are your coping mechanisms? What are the things that get you excited in life, or watch Korean dramas to help me express my emotions? I also enjoy taking walks.
 
Being active really helps me pets can also be a source of comfort that you need. Number one thing of course, and it's not just because I'm a therapist is to seek professional help. There is no one right answer except doing what's best for you. And prioritizing that.
