BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: The federal grand jury that issued the most recent indictment against former President Donald Trump reconvened today. That indictment, of course, covered the investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election. 
 
It's the first time that this panel has met since last week when the former president was officially charged with allegedly plotting to undermine the election. 
 
Well, now there's a legal dispute on that case over evidence sharing. The two sides have about 40 minutes left to let Judge Tanya Chutkan know when they can present their sides to her. 
 
Special Counsel Jack Smith is trying to block Trump from disclosing evidence publicly before trial. He's accusing Trump and his team of wanting to try the case in the media instead of the courtroom. But Trump's lawyers say Smith is trying to restrict his free speech. 
 
Let's turn now to CNN's senior legal affairs correspondent, Paula Reid. 
 
Paula, first, what do you know about the grand jury meeting today? Their work continues. 
 
PAULA REID, CNN SENIOR LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: That's right. The special counsel said the investigation continues. So not a big surprise to see them show up. We know they typically meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
 
And this comes just a day after we saw the special counsel interviewing Bernie Kerik. He is, of course, the former New York police commissioner but he is also a close associate of Rudy Giuliani. 
 <br>[14:35:01]
 
And the big question is, well, if the investigation continues, who else could be charged? 
 
We know Giuliani is, of course, identified as co-conspirator number one. We know Kerik got a lot of questions about his long-time associate, the work he did for Giuliani looking into these allegations of election fraud.
 
But he came out of the interview insisting that Giuliani will not be charged. We know he was also asked about a lot of the other key players here.
 
Notably, Brianna, though, today, the grand jury didn't hear from any additional witnesses. So it's possible that they were reading in the testimony from Kerik or possibly getting them ready for another indictment. It's unclear. 
 
KEILAR: Looking at this case out of Georgia, now, an indictment on election interference and particularly related to Trump's actions and those of other folks in that state may come down soon, that's the expectation now. 
 
Talk to us a little bit about some new subpoenas in the case. 
 
REID: That's right. There's been a recent flurry of subpoenas.
 
The latest one, according to our colleagues, went to former Republican Lieutenant Governor Geoff Duncan. Now, this is significant because he has long been critical of efforts to overturn the election in that state.
 
But let's take a listen to his reaction to this investigation. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GEOFF DUNCAN, (R), FORMER GEORGIA LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: I'm going to certainly keep the details to myself just to protect the integrity of the investigation.
 
But there is a very clear subpoena that was delivered to us late last week and we will certainly answer the questions that they've got before us and answer their call to show up for the grand jury. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
REID: And this is one of at least three subpoenas that has recently gone out in the Fulton County investigation as we wait to see if the district attorney, Fani Willis, will file charges against former President Trump.
 
But as you've heard recently, even Trump's legal team says they expect he will be charged in Georgia. 
 
KEILAR: All right, we'll be waiting for that.
 
Paula Reid, thank you as always. 
 
Jim? JIM SCIUTTO, CNN HOST: Mourners placed flowers on the hearse carrying the late singer, Sinead O'Connor, today. Details on her funeral and the huge turnout just ahead. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:41:26]
 
SCIUTTO: Right now, polls are open in Ohio for a special election that puts abortion rights very much at center stage in that state, even though, for now, that measure is not on the ballot. 
 
Follow this. Amending Ohio's constitution is. And today's measure would change the simple majority that Ohio requires to change its constitution to a higher threshold. 
 
If issue one passes today, a 60 percent super majority would be necessary. That's where abortion rights in Ohio come in.
 
Because a measure to protect abortion rights is on the ballot there in November. A 60 percent super majority requirement would make it more difficult to pass that measure protecting abortion rights. 
 
CNN's Jeff Zeleny is in Columbus. 
 
So tell us about this race here. The effort to raise the threshold to 60 percent is by folks who don't want a measure passed to protect abortion rights. 
 
JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: That's correct, Jim. And this was an effort put forward by Republican legislative leaders to schedule a special election today, August 8th. 
 
Really effectively at the end of summer as families are on vacation, getting ready to go back to school, which critics say they were trying to slip through, trying to have a low turnout election.
 
But so far, at least for a special election, even going into Election Day today before the polls opened, nearly 700,000 people across the state voted. 
 
And there has been a steady stream of voting here at this polling place in Columbus, but as well as at other polling places we're told across the state. So we will see what the exact turnout is.
 
But what today is about is writing the rules essentially for that November question. 
 
Ohio becomes the latest state to put abortion rights on the ballot and deciding whether to enshrine abortion rights into the state's constitution. Right now, the state has an abortion ban after six weeks. 
 
SCIUTTO: Right. 
 
ZELENY: That is, of course, in the wake of the landmark ruling in the Dobbs decision last year. 
 
When they kicked it back to the states, as we know, the Supreme Court, this is one of the aftereffects of that.
 
But an unusual special election today to make it more difficult for the abortion constitutional amendment to pass, as well as other things down the road, like minimum wage, marijuana legislation and perhaps some other matters as well -- Jim? 
 
SCIUTTO: So let me ask you this because it's interesting, that 60- point new proposed threshold, how does that relate to what public polling shows support is in the state of Ohio for maintaining or protecting abortion rights? 
 
ZELENY: It's a great question. And the 60 percent threshold, the reason that is interesting, Jim, last year, we saw several states, red states and a few blue states pass abortion rights amendments on their own. 
 
Just about a year ago right now Kansas stunned the country by passing an abortion rights measure that was just shy of 60 percent. In Kentucky, the same thing, just shy of 60 percent. 
 
So that is why the 60 percent threshold was decided upon here in Ohio. It is a higher burden, there is no question, a higher bar of that. 
 
Polling is just under 60 percent. So we will have to see if this does not pass today. And there is a 60 -- or if it does pass, excuse me, and there is a 60 percent threshold, this will make the November election absolutely the essential focus of the abortion rights fight in the states. 
 <br>[14:44:58]
 
But a two-part process here. But the idea of a sleepy summer election has really been anything but. Tens of thousands -- tens of millions of dollars, excuse me, have been spent on television ads. There have been protests. There have been a very engaged electorate here. 
 
So fascinating fight as Ohio becomes the latest battleground in the fight and decisions over abortion rights. 
 
SCIUTTO: Perhaps those numbers are connected. A 60 percent new threshold where public support is 58 percent. Notable. 
 
Jeff Zeleny, in Columbus, Ohio, thanks very much. 
 
Brianna?
 
KEILAR: Now to some of the other headlines that we are watching this hour.
 
It is down to the last eight for the women's World Cup. France this morning ending Morocco's miracle run. In bruising fashion, beating Morocco 4-0 to secure their place in the quarters. France going on to play the hosts Australia. Spain taking on the Netherlands. Sweden, which sadly knocked out the
 
 U.S. by a hair, facing Japan. And the favorites, the Lady Lionesses of England taking on Colombia. 
 
Also crowds paying respects to late singer, songwriter and activist, Sinead O'Connor, as her funeral procession drove past her old home in Ireland. This is the only public portion of her funeral. Friends and fellow artists, like Bob Geldof and Bono, reportedly attended the private burial. 
 
And deadly storms knocking out power to 300,000 homes and businesses across the eastern United States. Lightning killed a man in Florence, Alabama. A falling tree killed a 15-year-old boy in South Carolina. And downed power lines in Maryland left drivers stranded there for hours. 
 
The severe weather isn't over, either. The National Weather Service says 40 million people across the plains, the southeast and New England are at risk for more storms today. 
 
Jim? 
 
SCIUTTO: Still to come, President Biden announces a new national monument at the Grand Canyon that will mean no new permits for uranium mines. We will explain the significance with the filmmaker behind the documentary "Into the Canyon." Do stay with us. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:51:31]
 
KEILAR: It is called the crown jewel in America's National Park System. And here, in the studio of CNN NEWS CENTRAL, you can see why. 
 
Just a short time ago, President Biden unveiling some substantial funding and protections for one of the country's most treasured natural sites, the Grand Canyon. 
 
The president saying that he made a commitment to the tribal communities and environmentalists who were working to protect one million acres of surrounding land, with a particular focus on preventing future uranium mines. 
 
Biden said, when he first visited the Grand Canyon as a young Senator, an instinctive phrase came to mind. He says, he now calls the national park God's cathedral. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Preserving these lands is good, not only for Arizona, but for the planet. It's good for the economy. It's good for the soul of the nation. 
 
I believe in my core, it's the right thing to do. But there's more work ahead to combat the existential threat of climate change. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KEILAR: And joining us is Pete McBride. He's a photographer and documentary filmmaker who notably produced the documentary "Into the Canyon" where he hiked the length of the Grand Canyon and the park and between river and rim. 
 
OK, Pete, what do you think about this move? 
 
PETE MCBRIDE, PHOTOGRAPHER &amp; DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKER: Thanks for having me. 
 
I think it's great. I think it's long overdue. 
 
And I think it's great for two reasons. Number one, it brings the native voice back to the table. This included 13 Native American tribes. 
 
And secondly, I think it's protective for the freshwater system that's already strained and stressed, a part of the Colorado River system facing a lot of drought, climate change and over allocation. 
 
KEILAR: We're actually looking -- I want to tell our viewers -- at these beautiful pictures that are yours. 
 
In your documentary, you mention the voices of local tribes. You interviewed some who would be affected by any uranium mining. 
 
I want to play this clip then talk about it. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Our job at Havasupai is to keep our culture and songs, because that's all we have left is indigenous people. 
 
My reservation is about 20 miles from here. And the uranium mines are just waiting to contaminate our groundwater source. And when this contamination does reach our home, there will be no more Havasupai, no more of my people. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KEILAR: Pete, obviously, a huge relief to communities like this. 
 
There are already mining sites established around the Grand Canyon. Talk a little bit about some of those concerns and also what these communities are dealing with. 
 
MCBRIDE: Well, the concerns are that uranium mines dig very deep into the ground, roughly 2,000 to 3,000 feet deep. And the groundwater, the groundwater table around the Grand Canyon is incredibly complex. 
 
And we don't fully understand how interconnected it is to all of the springs and obviously the Colorado River, which shaped and sculpted the Grand Canyon. 
 
So there has been, in the past, mines that have hit ground water, contaminated it. 
 
And there are actually springs that I experienced passing through when I spent over a year hiking the length of the Grand Canyon with a colleague.
 <br>[14:55:03]
 
And we came across it to this day because there's still radioactive and contaminated. 
 
So, there's a long legacy of problematic, contaminated water systems. We can't afford that risk now. 
 
I think for the tribal communities, A, bring the voice back to the table. Having a voice at the table is incredibly inspiring. It's great to hear. They've been fighting for this for decades. 
 
And also, many of them live right in the Grand Canyon area and their water sources come from this water table. So I think many of them will feel relieved.
 
There are some mines grandfathered into the system. But to know there's not going to be new mining is a great relief, I think. 
 
KEILAR: Yes. No new mines. Grazing will be grandfathered in. Some mines will be grandfathered in. 
 
What do you say to some of the critics who, you know, the reason they've been fighting, these communities, for this for decades is because there's been some opposition to them in what they want here. 
 
What do you say to the critics of what Biden is doing? 
 
MCBRIDE: I've been out with uranium miners. I understand that there's a need to find potentially nuclear power alternative energies in the event of climate change. I know we need to find power. 
 
But there is only one Grand Canyon that I know of on this planet, and, of course, there's only one Colorado River system that supplies drinking water to 40 million Americans. 
 
And I think it's too great of a risk until we have better monitoring, better understanding of the water table to even put that at jeopardy. 
 
So, I understand people's desire for uranium there. But until we have better knowledge, which we don't, and scientists have been working on this, hydrologists would be working on this a long time. 
 
And we've ignored the native voice that's not only been crying out for the protection of fresh water but also there are a lot of sacred sites included in this monument, up to 3,000. 
 
And I think that's an incredible legacy and incredible archaeology history of early American/Grand Canyon and the Colorado region. 
 
KEILAR: No it's a great point. I flew over the Grand Canyon last week coming from California to D.C.
 
 It never ceases to amaze. Not as good as being there in person, of course. 
 
But it's an unbelievable day to look at all of these beautiful pictures. It's the closest we're going to get, so many of us today, 
 
Pete McBride, thanks for being with us. 
 
MCBRIDE: Thanks for having me. 
 
KEILAR: Jim? 
 
SCIUTTO: Alabama authorities say arrests warrants are out for three white men after last weekend's riverfront brawl. We'll be live in Montgomery with the latest just ahead.
