(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HOLMES: Professor Vincent Lloyd talks to Michel Martin about his eye- catching essay, "A Black Professor Trapped in Anti-Racist Hell."
 
HOLMES: Hello, and welcome to the program. I'm Michael Holmes in Atlanta sitting in for Christiane Amanpour.
 
Well, Russia's Vladimir Putin now a wanted man. The International Criminal Court has issued a warrant for his arrest for alleged war crimes, including 
 
 deporting Ukrainian children to Russia. Now, Nic Robertson is standing by in London for us.
 
Nic, an arrest warrant for a head of state, a president of a nation that sits on the U.N. Security Council, just how extraordinary is this?
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: There's never been something this big before to recuse some -- a leader of such a major nation 
 
 of being a war criminal. And if prosecuted, though that seems unlikely, that if prosecuted and found guilty he would be a war criminal.
 
His position as leader of one of the U.N. Security Council's permanent five members has meant in the past that he's been able to go to New York and 
 
 speak to the U.N. Security Council, stand at that podium. A member of the G20, he's been able to go and meet with other G20 leaders. In European 
 
 countries, in the past, that's going to end as well.
 
President Putin has put high stock in his ability to be the leader of a powerful nation and to stride the international stage and exert that 
 
 powered and influence and at health. That is no more. Now, the Kremlin says that the ICC has no writ with them. And it's clear with from within the 
 
 walls of the Kremlin this is not going to have a real impact on Putin.
 
But it is designed to get in his mind and to alter the way that he thinks about the war in Ukraine. His future world after the war in Ukraine is now 
 
 prescribed. Meeting the U.S. president, for example. Now, completely unimaginable. And he puts a huge stock in that. He's always wanted to 
 
 negotiate directly with President Biden over the war in Ukraine.
 
So, it radically changes his outlook and sends a huge message to anyone fighting for him in Ukraine. And that is what Ukrainian officials are 
 
 saying, Russia essentially, according to a prosecutor general in Ukraine, Russia essentially a criminal state.
 
HOLMES: Extraordinary times. Nic Robertson, our thanks to you.
 
And do make sure you tune to "Amanpour" next week when Christiane will be speaking to the International Criminal Court Prosecutor Karim Khan.
 
OK. Turning now to a memory etched in the minds of so many. 20 years ago next week, the skies lighting up over Baghdad, the moment America's 
 
 invasion of Iraq began. It goes without saying that the controversial decision to go to war there has had enormous consequences, death, 
 
 destruction, instability. Things Iraqis are still very much grappling with today.
 
That is a story I feel personally connected to. I first went to Iraq in April 2003, driving from Kuwait to Baghdad with a convoy of U.S. marines, 
 
 the day after Saddam's statue was toppled in Firdos Square. Arriving amid the chaos of looting and an almost complete lack of effort to stop it, it 
 
 seemed half the city was burning for days.
 <br>[14:05:00]
 
I returned 16 more times, the most recent during the battle to recapture Mosul from ISIS. So, with 20 years gone from the start of the war, we turn 
 
 now to two brilliant photographers who each document the human impact of it through different perspectives. Lynsey Addario was on the ground, and 
 
 Wesaam Al-Badry grew up in Lincoln, Nebraska as a refugee from the first Gulf War. Lynsey Addario and Wesaam Al-Badry, I really appreciate you 
 
 joining us here on the program.
 
Lynsey, let's begin with you. When you look back at the Iraq war 20 years on, how do you reflect on those years and the toll that they took on the 
 
 country and its people?
 
LYNSEY ADDARIO, PHOTOJOURNALIST AND AUTHOR, "IT'S WHAT I DO": I mean, it was sort of a tragedy, actually. I mean, I look back, it was the first 
 
 proper war I had ever covered. And just watching the unraveling of a country and the chaos, you talked about the fires, the looting, men rounded 
 
 up in the middle of the night by American troops who were given a directive to go find insurgents in the heart of the Sunni Triangle watching people 
 
 have bags put on their heads, zip ties on their wrists, you know. Some, of course, presumably innocent. And just, you know, really -- just watching 
 
 the demise and the chaos of a country.
 
HOLMES: Yes, those early months in particular were just horrible in terms of a disorganization, the chaos that you say. The lack of structure, of 
 
 control.
 
Wesaam, you left Iraq as the first Gulf War started, the first one in 1991. What were your thoughts when the second one began in your country of birth 
 
 20 years ago?
 
WESAAM AL-BADRY, PHOTOGRAPHER: Well, it was devastating. I mean, I just saw the images and my heart started pounding all over again. You know, there is 
 
 nothing that words can't really describe, you know, seeing your motherland being bombed by your new homeland.
 
So, it is still, like, something we still trying to process. And even though it is the 20th anniversary, it is the day before my birthday. So, it 
 
 holds a special place, like it always -- it's constant reminder of what, like, the toll of war does to a family and to a nation.
 
HOLMES: Yes, you put that so well. Watching your home country being bombed by your new country. When you look at some of your photographs now, Wesaam, 
 
 your work focuses a lot on family, extended family and friends as refugees from war. What has been the story you've want people to see through your 
 
 photographs?
 
AL-BADRY: Well, my whole work is based on giving an understanding that, like, Arab-American, Muslims American are not, like, an archaic figure that 
 
 lives in the past, you know. That we are part of this country now and we are creating more part of this fabric.
 
So, my whole project is always taken -- I'm very interested in family because growing up a refugee camp family was everything. Then at the same 
 
 time, this work is a healing process for me and the community and, you know, the grander society that, like, how do we process war and how do we 
 
 speak about it? So, this is basically the war and, like, this whole project that takes the toll on what I am doing right now, and it is still ongoing.
 
HOLMES: Yes. Lynsey, a few years ago "American Photo Magazine" named you as one of the five most influential photographers of the last 25 years. Saying 
 
 that you changed the way we see the world's conflicts. I would agree with that. When it comes to Iraq, what do you think or hope your photographs 
 
 achieved?
 
ADDARIO: You know, that was really the first war I covered. And those initial days were so chaotic, I was running around covering everything from 
 
 mass graves, to the protests of people who were frustrated because they're couldn't get money out of the banks. There was no water, no electricity, 
 
 watching sort of the beginning of the insurgency. And really, sort of, then doing my first military M-beds (ph).
 
And so, a lot of that was, sort of, a real awakening for me. Of course, I like so many journalists spent the first few months looking for weapons of 
 
 mass destruction that we were told existed in Iraq. And, you know, that of course was futile. But spent a lot of time trying to understand, you know, 
 
 why we were there and looking for those weapons.
 
HOLMES: Wesaam, I wanted to ask you about how important it is for you to put a human side to those you photographed, so that others, particularly in 
 
 the U.S. where you live now, see people not refugees or strangers or foreigners, you know, Arabs.
 <br>[14:10:00]
 
AL-BADRY: Yes. Well, I think we've been bombarded with that information. You know, years back, I read this amazing essay about Walter Benjamin 
 
 called "The Age of Mechanical Reproduction". And I think that really sparked something in me, every time I searched Arab or searched anything it 
 
 was the oldest negative imagery coming out.
 
And I wanted to challenge that notion because that is not the community, that is not the people, and that is not the million of Muslim Arab-
 
 Americans living in this country. You know -- I mean, like, people are beautiful and people living their lives. So, I wanted to show that work and 
 
 just run with it. I think a lot of people agree with it because it wasn't really complicated to convince people to be part of a project. I just ask 
 
 them to come and be as you are.
 
HOLMES: Yes, so -- 
 
ADDARIO: So -- and it's a beautiful -- 
 
HOLMES: Yes, Lynsey, a similar point to you. I know -- you know, I know from my own experience, the -- and it was a frustrating aspect. The big 
 
 picture of war was often just a sea of numbers, casualties on both sides and so on. What is striking about both of your portfolios is how you 
 
 document the human side of the conflict, the people, the interactions, and so on. How important then, Lynsey, is that humanizing of people, giving 
 
 names and faces, not numbers?
 
ADDARIO: I mean, for me it's everything. You know, I think of myself as sort of a horrible combat photographer. You know, half the time I'm being 
 
 shot at, I forget to take photographs. Whereas, you know, really, for me, it's about the people. It's about the women, children, the civilians, the 
 
 elderly. And that is a threat I have carried through two decades of war coverage. And I think in Iraq it was also very important for me to find the 
 
 emotion, to find the tender moments. Really, to try to connect the audience around the world with what was happening on the ground to people 
 
 themselves.
 
HOLMES: Yes. I -- Wesaam, I wanted to ask you, how difficult was it to adjust to a radically different life in the U.S.? How difficult were those 
 
 early years? Do you ever fully adjust?
 
AL-BADRY: Well, I mean, I -- so going back, I grew up in a refugee camp. So, the first go for happens, you know, then you live in a refugee camp for 
 
 four to half years and you get to move to the Midwest, you know. I mean, that is a big change regardless for you. Regardless of -- you know, I mean, 
 
 we live next to bypass, next to a plastic factory. But you know to you that's a safe home, and Lynsey can attest to that that, you know, being in 
 
 a refugee and being in a war zone, you just want a safe place. And that is what my parents were striving for, just for their kids to be safe.
 
And adjusting, you really never get to adjust because you're always the other, you know. There's always like this hyphenated American, you know. 
 
 So, it's like you get to adjust to it but it's like -- also society get to adjust to you. So, it's this going back and forth, and it has always been 
 
 that case, and it's -- we're not the first group. There is a lot of, you know, Americans who are still struggling with -- how to adjust to this 
 
 country.
 
HOLMES: I'm going to throw something at you, Wesaam. And I know that you -- and I was reading some of your comments about Lynsey that you have always 
 
 admired and respected her and her photography.
 
AL-BADRY: Yes.
 
HOLMES: You know, I wanted -- yes, your thoughts on the impact of Lynsey's work in Iraq and if there's anything you would like to ask her.
 
AL-BADRY: I mean, with Lynsey, it's like -- look, I was always as critical of photojournalist. But I think with Lynsey's work what hit the heart. And 
 
 there was like -- it's the human, you know, like, I'm not seen as a number. I mean, I am very like into working with the archives and everything I pick 
 
 up is just a number. Like, I am somebody's lapel, you know, somebody's shirt.
 
While with Lynsey's work, it's like -- it's this humanizing. And I think it got this -- let's say, a motherly look to it. Like the other person feels 
 
 like a human in the other end of the lens. Not just another -- so, you know, I'm always like, I don't want to be that -- you know, on the other 
 
 side of the lens with a runny nose, you know, and like you are just out of place. But with Lynsey's work, is like, you get to see both sides. And the 
 
 both sides, nobody wants war, I mean, that's the reality of it.
 
It's like -- it's not -- if it's an American soldier or if it's an Iraqi civilian, or whatever combatant, they all have families. They all have 
 
 loved ones. They all have that one. And that's what I said when I heard I'm -- Lynsey and I would be in conversation. It put a smile on my heart 
 
 because there is only a good few journalist or good people out there. And I really gauge the world as either you're a good person or you're not.
 
And Lynsey, to me, like, her work isn't that good (INAUDIBLE). Like, you're trying to make the world a better place for all of us. And you know, like, 
 
 I saw you're a parent as yourself, and I'm a parent too. So, we know what we're all -- we striving to create. So, yes, that's why I am really happy 
 
 to be an conversation with you.
 
ADDARIO: Thank you, Wesaam.
 
HOLMES: What a lovely comment.
 
Going back to the harshness of war, Lynsey, I want to show people a photograph, not from Iraq but from Ukraine.
 <br>[14:15:00]
 
And I'll give people a warning that, you know, it's graphic. It is that family killed on the outskirts of Kyiv by Russian shells. Their bodies are 
 
 on the street. My question though, is how do you strike the balance, as you do, of portraying the horror but also the human dignity. The agency of the 
 
 victims which that photo did. How do you strike that balance?
 
ADDARIO: I mean, that was an extraordinarily difficult moment because I, myself, survived that attack. I mean, the round that landed between myself 
 
 and Andriy Donchyk (ph) who I was working with and our security advisor, landed, sort of, equidistant between us and the family, and the family was 
 
 killed. The mother with her two children, and the church volunteer.
 
And, I think -- so, I was very much in shock when I was taking those photographs. And I remember approaching from the -- from their feet and, 
 
 sort of, being horrified and having to remind myself to actually photograph because I was so shocked. And I worked my way around because I've also been 
 
 doing this so long that I realized I had to try to find a respectful angle that wasn't too graphic, that showed what I had just witnessed, which was 
 
 the intentional killing of civilians. And it was important for me to shoot and to try to shoot in a way that was respectful.
 
HOLMES: Yes, and it did give them agency.
 
Wesaam, I found it fascinating -- actually, just before the program, I read that you told one of our producers that you became friends with U.S. 
 
 soldiers who had been in Iraq. And that you found their trauma similar to your own. You talk about a healing process for refugees from Iraq and other 
 
 places for your family, your friends, yourself. Tell us about that.
 
AL-BADRY: Well, when I was an undergrad, I went to, you know, we were at the San Francisco Institute. And there was like, you know, marines who went 
 
 through -- you know, served and they were in school. But it seems like, you know, there's a weird place in society when you come back. And people who 
 
 have similar experience or have been to similar places graphically toward each other.
 
And actually, one of my dear friends that -- we're still, like, in constant contact was in the marine. He served like nine years and we are still 
 
 talking about, like -- I'm not really -- my work is not about, like, in the judging business. I always say, my work just to put images forward and to 
 
 have a conversation.
 
And you really -- it's -- when war waged, it's not about -- I mean, it's not rich people going against each other, you know. It's people who are 
 
 trying to eat and trying live. So, sometimes you have more in common with people after, you know, after the dust settles, you can have a 
 
 conversation. You can talk about your experiences. And most time I -- you know, veterans I spoke with whether they were in the army or marine corps, 
 
 most of them didn't even want to be there, you know. It's -- and same, you know -- it's like -- and how do you process that when another human being 
 
 told you, like, I am sorry I don't want to be there, you know, or we were given orders.
 
HOLMES: I will say, I found that fascinating myself from going up at the beginning and -- I mean, you know, a lot of American soldiers wanted to be 
 
 there and then, you know, going three, four, five, six years, seven years later, they did not want to be there.
 
Lynsey, in another warning to viewers before this next question, because a couple of the photographs are quite vivid. But wanted to ask you about this 
 
 because so many of your photographs, you know, they achieved almost iconic status for the power and how they tell the story. Many of Iraqis, of 
 
 course, but crucially in Iraq, you shot a lot of American wounded which serves the purpose too of starkly reminding Americans at home of the cost 
 
 of the war. What was the reaction to that? What did you hope the reaction was for those photographs in particular?
 
ADDARIO: Well, the irony was I shot that story for "Life Magazine". It was commissioned by "Life Magazine". It was during the siege of Faluja, 
 
 November of 2004. We had this incredible exclusive access to the hospital in Balad (ph) where all of the wounded marines and soldiers were coming out 
 
 and being treated. And I shot for about five days and then flew with the wounded back to Ramstein in Germany for treatment in Landstuhl. And sent 
 
 the photographs to "Life Magazine" and they held them for almost four months. And finally, I got a message saying, they would never publish those 
 
 photographs, because they were just not appropriate for the American public.
 
Now, you can imagine my response after having covered Iraq for almost two straight years at that point. The Americans needed to see those 
 
 photographs, and the marines that I photographed we're so proud to be photographed for that peace. And so, you know, it was really unbelievable. 
 
 But luckily "The New York Times" magazine, Kathy Ryan, she took the photographs immediately and was able to get them published.
 <br>[14:20:00]
 
HOLMES: Yes, I remember running up against some walls trying to do story with the Med-Evac units. I got to do the story but there were a ton of 
 
 rules on that.
 
Wesaam, I wanted to ask you, of course, you're in the U.S. now but after 20 years after the war began, what are your hopes for your country and its 
 
 people?
 
AL-BADRY: I mean, my hope is for, like, everybody that -- I mean, peace, stability, you know. Freedom to vote, freedom of mobility, equal rights for 
 
 everybody, you know, the LGBTQ community, religious freedom.
 
I mean, you want all these things, you know. And I think Iraq is capable of reaching it, you know, having the right people. I don't really have high 
 
 hopes in politics there, but I think that I have a lot of faith in the people and the younger generation that is striving for change and I think 
 
 that is something that we need to nurture, you know. We need to be part of it and to have these conversations.
 
Iraq can't sustain -- I mean, Iraq had been at war since I ever was born, you know, like since the 80s, you know. It was like, people get tired, you 
 
 know. And people don't want to be at war. I never met a human being who's like, I want to be at war, you know. That's -- it's just not natural.
 
HOLMES: No. No, exactly. I could talk to you guys for the entire program. It's been an honor to speak with you both Lynsey Addario and Wesaam Al-
 
 Badry, two enormously talented people. Thank you so much for what you are doing.
 
ADDARIO: Thank you so much.
 
AL-BADRY: Thank you.
 
HOLMES: All right.
 
Next, we turn to Mexico and what is now a harrowing epidemic. Missing people. More than 100,000 people have disappeared in Mexico, that's an 
 
 understatement, probably. The recent, kidnapping of four Americans in the country has once again brought the issue into focus. But the quick response 
 
 by authorities has left some questioning whether Mexicans themselves are forgotten. And it comes as the country continues, of course, to be plagued 
 
 by cartel violence.
 
Let's dig into some of these issues now with investigative journalist, Peniley Ramirez. She joins me now from New York. And thanks so much for 
 
 doing so. I mean, Americans getting kidnapped is always going to get attention. But Mexico's national database of missing and unlocated persons 
 
 currently list more than 112,000 Mexicans has disappeared, many say the numbers actually way higher than that. And of course, many are undocumented 
 
 migrants in Mexico are routinely taken for ransom or trafficking. How do the cartels impact the lives of ordinary Mexican?
 
PENILEY RAMIREZ, EXECUTIVE PRODUCER, FUTURO INVESTIGATES AND CO-HOST, "USA V. GARCIA LUNA" PODCAST: Well, Mexico has been suffering crisis of violence 
 
 and people disappeared since the last 20 years, more than 20 years. And -- look, according to official data, just in Tamaulipas, they placed the state 
 
 where these four Americans were kidnapped, more than 10,000 people are still disappeared.
 
And Tamaulipas is not even the worst place in Mexico with the disappearing crisis. Jalisco is the worst place in Mexico. Mexico right now is the 
 
 deadliest country in the world to be a journalist. Even worse than other countries in war like Ukraine, and this is official data that we just to 
 
 see if last year from Reporters Without Borders.
 
So, you have a country when the -- they lit -- the violence, it's like, the way that we operate and we live every day. 10 women are killed in Mexico 
 
 every day. You see that more than 30,000 people are killed every year. Last year, for example, the Mexican government were saying, oh, we managed to 
 
 reduce by six, seven percent the death rate. But that is still more than 30,000 people for years.
 
HOLMES: Yes.
 
RAMIREZ: And we have been having the same issue for the -- since -- particularly since 2003, 2004, but more after 2006, 2007 when Mexico 
 
 declared the so-called war on drugs. That has no results so far. More violence and more violence in the Mexico side. And in the U.S., you have 
 
 more people dying from overdoses because the war on drugs is against the trafficking but the drugs are still common.
 
HOLMES: I wanted to ask you about that. So, you bring me to the question very neatly, the drug side of this. I know you've written about cartel 
 
 involvement and fentanyl which, of course, is a huge story in the U.S. -- 
 
RAMIREZ: Yes.
 
HOLMES: -- and fentanyl manufacturing and distribution. The president, though, has been saying it's not produced in Mexico. Here's what he said 
 
 about it yesterday. Let's have a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDRES MANUEL LOPEZ OBRADOR, MEXICAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Mexico is not the country that introduces the most fentanyl into the United 
 
 States. I maintain it more fentanyl reaches the United States and Canada directly than reaches Mexico.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[14:25:00]
 
HOLMES: You've reported on this. I know you are going to disagree with that. How do you respond to it? And also, just talk about how well 
 
 structure the cartels are. How organized their chains of command.
 
RAMIREZ: Well, I asked the same question about the fentanyl labs in Mexico to the Mexican president himself in 2019. And he said, oh, we don't have 
 
 labs in Mexico. And I was working then in an investigation about the fentanyl production in Mexico, and I was in a laboratory myself. And then 
 
 he is telling me, oh we don't have labs in Mexico. Well, I was in one of them.
 
And after me, several older journalists have been documenting how Mexico has becoming more protagonist, and the shame about the fentanyl production. 
 
 And there is an important context of this. Before Mexico became such an important place for the production of fentanyl, this was happening in 
 
 another place of the world that we now know really well which is Wuhan, China. The -- exactly the place where the COVID pandemic has started.
 
So, after the lockdowns in China, during the pandemic, all the production was moved to other places, especially to Mexico, because there you will 
 
 receive in a lot of the small parts that you will use, and then you'll produce it there.
 
So, it's crazy that you have the Mexican president saying that there are no fentanyl labs, and you have the journalists documenting this. And then you 
 
 have official data from his own government saying that, oh, we captured another laboratory. We have been doing this intelligence work. So, it 
 
 doesn't make any sense.
 
HOLMES: So, what then is the government effectively doing about the cartels? I mean, for an outsider it is easy to, sort of, think, you know, 
 
 who's really running that country? Obviously, these groups feel they can act with impunity, they do. And former -- you know, what's interesting, 
 
 former U.S. Attorney General William Barr, he recently described President Lopez Obrador as the cartels' chief enabler. Does he have a point?
 
RAMIREZ: Well, I think that you can see in the last years in Mexico that the President Lopez Obrador had one -- he had been changing the way that 
 
 he's approaching this issue. Because he was -- when he was in campaign, he said that he will air -- end this so-called war on drugs. And he was -- he 
 
 popularized this saying of, oh, I prefer the hugs. I don't want any more bullets.
 
But after that, you see his administration announcing, oh, we captured this drug lord. We captured this other person. But effectively, the -- according 
 
 to data from the U.N., the Mexican cartels are still laundering more than $25 billion per year.
 
So, if you go to the numbers and the data, you still see a lot of people dying in Mexico because of the violence. You see the cartels laundering all 
 
 of this money. You see -- you still see Mexico as one of the five more corrupt places in America. One of the most corrupt places in the world. You 
 
 see all of the dangers of being a journalist. And you see all the drugs coming into the United States. We have an overdose crisis in the United 
 
 States. And most of those drugs, and that is official data, they are coming still from Mexico via Colombia, via South America but also via China to 
 
 Mexico and the to the United States.
 
HOLMES: And, you know, in the broader picture, President Lopez Obrador, Amlo, as he is called, you know, as you say, began his presidency promising 
 
 to defend the poor and crucially strengthen democracy. But what has actually happened in terms of, you spoke of efforts to silence critics, 
 
 including yourself.
 
RAMIREZ: Yes.
 
HOLMES: But also eroding democratic checks and balances. Where is democracy?
 
RAMIREZ: Well, the thing is that in Mexico, you have a strong party. And it's the Lopez Obrador Party. It's also true that the opposition in Mexico 
 
 is kind of lost. They don't have a united message. They don't have a strong candidate.
 
So, you see, his party, Morena, it's how call it in Spanish, growing and growing. And you see more power to the military, you see more power to the 
 
 marines. And at the same time, you see him taking actions that really are red flags. For example, you saw on Mexico in the last weeks, we have been 
 
 seeing massive protests against a reform that he is introducing in the electoral law that will put in some awkward position, the actual national 
 
 institute that organized the elections in Mexico.
 
And the Mexicans are really proud of this institute and the work that this institute had done for Mexican democracy. And you have the president trying 
 
 to undermine openly the operation of this institute. And you have the Mexican president talking out loud against some judges because there are 
 
 dystopian things that he is trying to do.
 <br>[14:30:00]
 
So, you see a lot of things that we have seen in other countries that are, of course, red flags. Including in the United States during the Trump 
 
 administration. So, right now, I think that you have an opposition in Mexico that is quite not getting what they need to do. And at the same 
 
 time, you have more and more citizens saying that, OK, you are really popular. It is true that we don't have a lot of other options, but these 
 
 things that you are doing are just not right.
 
HOLMES: Speak to the level, you know, of corruption, which worries, you know, a lot of people in Mexico. According to the non-governmental group, 
 
 Mexicans Against Corruption and Impunity, three out of four projects are awarded with no competing bids. I mean, you've got environmental laws being 
 
 flouted on any number of construction projects. You've got indigenous peoples not being consulted as the law demands. How deep do you believe can 
 
 direct corruption runs?
 
RAMIREZ: Well, the thing is, I have been an investigative reporter all of my career, and more of the clues that we have to follow corruption in 
 
 governments are especially those bids. But if you don't have the bids, if you just, you know, assign the contract to whoever you like, sometimes it's 
 
 your own friends and we have seen documentaries how they use front companies in Mexico and in other places to hide who are the real people 
 
 benefiting from these contracts.
 
And at the same time, you have all the things that you mentioned. You have a lot of loss that were up (INAUDIBLE) Mexico in the past years. And that 
 
 will help if you're building a train, he's building a big train that will go to the Riviera Maya. But you have people who lives there and they have 
 
 their voice unheard. And every time you try to document this as a journalist, as you said, including myself, you are targeted in this daily 
 
 conference that he has.
 
And then, you get a lot of hate in social media and other places. And it is, like, oh, you are lying, or this kind of strategy that we have seen 
 
 here and we have seen in other places that finally is undermining the democracy.
 
HOLMES: And, that's a sort of talk that, you know, in Mexico gets journalist killed as well, as you pointed out. We've only got a couple of 
 
 minutes left, but I wanted to sort of make the point. The Economist Intelligence Unit Index on democracy, they serve 165 nations, a variety of 
 
 criteria. They recently downgraded Mexico from floored democracy to hybrid regime. CNN's own Fareed Zakaria described the low as a "populist demagogue 
 
 straight out of the worst pages of Latin American history."
 
Is Mexico's very democracy in peril at the moment? It is that bad?
 
RAMIREZ: Well, I think that it is important to pay attention to what's happening with this electoral reform. I must say, I was born in Cuba before 
 
 I moved to Mexico. So, I see red flags, frankly, from my own experience, not just from my experience as a journalist. And it is true that Mexico is 
 
 close to the Cuban government. It is close to the Venezuelan government. It's kind of close also to Russia. So, I think that we should take those 
 
 signs and we should see those flags.
 
And the fact that something, it's happening in the continent, in the sub- continent of Latin America and we shall see how this is structurized (ph) by the laws and the laws that have been approved in Mexico are in 
 
 discussion right now in the Mexican Congress could be really worrying.
 
HOLMES: Peniley Ramirez, my goodness, worrying stuff. Great to speak to you. Thank you so much for making the time.
 
RAMIREZ: Thank you, so much.
 
HOLMES: Well, now to tackle complicated and controversial topics in class, we should all want to be doing that. Even more importantly, how do you have 
 
 a conversation that could end in agreeing to disagree? Our next guest has been living that dilemma. And his story is unique because he is a black 
 
 professor who wanted to challenge his students' pre-conceptions about racism, and it did not end well.
 
Professor Vincent Lloyd spoke with Michel Martin about his article, "A Black Professor Trapped an Anti-Racist Hell."
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MICHEL MARTIN, CONTRIBUTOR: Professor Vincent. Lloyd, thanks so much for talking to us.
 
VINCENT LLOYD, PROFESSOR AND DIRECTOR OF AFRICAN STUDIES, VILLANOVA UNIVERSITY: Thanks for having me.
 
MARTIN: So, you wrote a piece for -- an essay for "Compact" magazine which "The Atlantic" later picked up, and you had a conversation with them about 
 
 it. It was titled, "A Black Professor Trapped in the Anti-Racist Hell." And you give your account of a really -- I don't know how to say it -- bracing, 
 
 disturbing experience that you had teaching a seminar, race in the limits of law in America. This was a class of high school students. It was part of 
 
 a summer program at Telluride
 
You taught there before, but not for some time. So, before we get into the -- kind of the substance of your essay, just talk a little bit about why 
 
 some people might be surprised that you are the person, you know,, writing an essay about the -- you know, the anti-racist hell?
 <br>[14:35:00]
 
LLOYD: Thanks. Yes. So, I am a professor of Villanova. I am affiliated with the Africana Studies Program. I directed our black studies program here for 
 
 a few years here. My research focuses on anti-blackness in religion and in philosophy. And I have been writing books and articles around this topic 
 
 for a long time. The focus of this course that I was teaching for Telluride was based in the limits of law with -- four of the six weeks focused on 
 
 anti-blackness.
 
MARTIN: And tell me a little bit about the students. Like who were there in this seminar?
 
LLOYD: Yes. So, this is a highly selective program. These are the best of the best high school students from around the U.S. and from beyond the U.S. 
 
 Students who are on the track to Ivy League colleges.
 
MARTIN: And you had taught that class or a similar class before, right? Tell me what the experience had been.
 
LLOYD: Yes. So, I taught -- co-taught a version of this class in 2014 at Cornell. And then, again, in 2022 at the University of Michigan, through 
 
 the Telluride Association Program. We read legal cases from Dred Scott and Brown v. Board of Education, to more recent cases on immigration and 
 
 indigeneity and mass incarceration and informative action. We also read novels. We read memoirs. We read short stories. We also read critical 
 
 theory and histories that could give us a three-dimensional view of problems of anti-blackness and related issues of oppression in the U.S. 
 
 today.
 
MARTIN: And tell me about the seminal format. What had you hope to do? And then, we'll talk about what actually happened.
 
LLOYD: Yes. So, unlike a lecture course where the professor is just conveying information to the students. A seminar is based on a belief that 
 
 each of us can approach a text with our own experiences, our own critical reading skills, and through -- pushing against each other through sharing 
 
 our ideas and bouncing off in conversation our ideas against others' ideas, new knowledge can be produced.
 
And, you know, when I did this in 2014, it was a really fruitful and rewarding discussion. Each day, there was some awkwardness. These are 16- 
 
 and 17-year-olds. Some people are saying things that were clearly off. But through the process of conversation, we could think for deeply together and 
 
 move toward a deeper understanding of what we were reading, that didn't happen again in 2022.
 
MARTIN: In your recounting, this went way off the rails. I mean, from your experience. I mean, and obviously, we are just getting your point of view 
 
 on this, but when did you start to see things kind of go off the rails, at least in your estimation of it?
 
LLOYD: The first week of the seminar was planned to be on indigeneity, thinking about the genocide of Native Americans and the continuing effects 
 
 of that on native communities in the U.S. At the end of the first week as a teaching assistant who has also a sort of camp counselor who is 
 
 coordinating the 21 hours of the students' lives outside of the seminar came to me and said, it seems like we are missing something really 
 
 important in the seminar. We are not talking about anti-blackness. I tried to point to the syllabus that, you know, we have four weeks coming up an 
 
 anti-blackness. But she kept insisting that something was off, you know, if we are spending a week on indigeneity and the injustices suffered by Native 
 
 Americans. That was the first week.
 
By the second, we were trying to do a mock court. You know, an exercise where students are divided into teams. Some of them are lawyers for one 
 
 side, some of them are lawyers for another side. We were trying to see, you know, what is it like to be a lawyer? Does law really get to justice or is 
 
 there something missing if you are adjudicating questions of justice in a court? By the end of that, the students were, again, complaining that they 
 
 were forced to inhabit the position even just in this exercise of sides that they didn't believe in. Even if it was just for the purpose of 
 
 learning the logic of their opponents.
 
MARTIN: You really do describe, like the way you talk about it is like this anti-racist hell, like this kind of hothouse atmosphere of just accusations 
 
 and on kindness. Let me just read a little bit. The allegations levy. I had used racist language. I had misgendered Brittney Griner. I had repeatedly 
 
 confused the names of two black students. My body language harm to them. I hadn't corrected facts that were harmful to hear when the now-purge 
 
 students introduced them in class.
 
In fact, you're saying that they actually, what, kicked out or voted to kick out two students because they didn't like what they had to say.
 <br>[14:40:00]
 
I invited them to think about the reasoning of both sides of an argument, when only one side was correct. The students ended with the demand, in 
 
 light of all the harms they had suffered, they could only continue in the class if I abandoned the seminar format and instead lectured each day about 
 
 anti-blackness, correcting any of them who questioned orthodoxy. Like, wow.
 
OK. Wow. How did this -- was this all presented like on one day?
 
LLOYD: Yes. On the very final day that we met together, the students all came in about 10 minutes after the class was about to start. They were all 
 
 were carrying a piece of paper that had a very long statement written on it. Each of them read in sequence a paragraph from the statement and that 
 
 was that.
 
MARTIN: So, how far into the seminar was this before the students kind of presented to you with this manifesto?
 
LLOYD: At the start of the fifth week of a sixth weeks -- 
 
MARTIN: The start of the fifth week. OK. So, what did you do?
 
LLOYD: Yes. So, I -- my co-instructor and I said, you know, we need to think about this. And as soon as we left, we talked to the Telluride 
 
 Association Leadership and said, this doesn't seem sustainable. We need the Telluride Association Leadership to communicate to these students and to 
 
 this teaching assistant that these two -- this faculty team have been contracted to teach a college level seminar. This is what a college level 
 
 seminar looks like, and we have faith in these instructors to teach this.
 
MARTIN: You didn't go from week one, everybody showing up to the seminar, and then ending in, you know, week five. People are just not showing up or 
 
 presenting you with this manifesto. What happened in between? Like what was going on before you were presented with this?
 
LLOYD: Yes. So, each week, there was some other incident that students would raise that they found concerning. For example, when we were 
 
 discussing Brown v. The Board of Education, a famous Supreme Court case that ended school segregation in the U.S., one of the aspects of that case 
 
 was a doll test where psychologists were asking students, you know, is this -- do you see this doll as white, colored, or negro?
 
And the students in my seminar claim that they were harmed by hearing the word negro, which, you know, I framed as, you know, at the beginning of the 
 
 classes, saying, we will encounter controversial language. We can talk about that. If you feel uncomfortable, we can have conversations about why 
 
 we might or might not use different language. But the reaction of hearing something and being harmed and needing to immediately stop everything and 
 
 to name that harm as creating an unsafe space made it impossible to have a regular seminar.
 
MARTIN: What was going through your mind when all of this was going on?
 
LLOYD: I was thinking back to the -- what I read about the '60s and '70s, when they were really powerful important civil rights movements, and 
 
 movements against the Vietnam War and quickly turned into movements that had cult like characteristics, movements that we're turning it on 
 
 themselves. And we are no longer pursuing justice in the world but we're sort of eating themselves with the language of the pursuit of justice.
 
MARTIN: How did the whole thing end up?
 
LLOYD: So, I told the Telluride Association Leadership, either you come and intervene and explain what the Telluride Association has asked me to do to 
 
 the students or, you know, we can't continue in these seminars. It is not a seminar anymore. The Telluride Association Leadership believing in radical 
 
 democracy, believing that the students in their autonomous community should get to choose to do whatever they want. And, you know, even if it is a 
 
 failure, they will learn from it for next year. The Telluride Association Leadership decided not to intervene.
 
I understand in the last two weeks, this teaching assistant just basically lectured herself each day for the final two weeks.
 
MARTIN: OK. So, you know what, you can imagine that people hearing this have had quite a range of reactions to what has been you've just described. 
 
 But I'm kind of just going back to the fact that these are 16 and 17-year- old kids and you are the adult. And I'm just wondering if you thought that this was going -- becoming cult like, why didn't you intervene? Why did you 
 
 let it go on for so long?
 
LLOYD: Yes. So, I believe in the Telluride Association mission that, you know, having a democratic community with self-governing of students is 
 
 really exciting. If I were 16 or 17, I would want to be in that kind of community. And that community -- that kind of community brings risks and it 
 
 is something that the organization, the Telluride Association, to manage those risks.
 <br>[14:45:00]
 
And when things are starting to off the rails, to create bumpers so that things don't become courtly (ph) cult like as they seemed to in this case. 
 
 So, the idea, the spirit of the thing strikes me as really important. Like we should be empowering students to figure out -- empowering young people 
 
 to figure out how to live together. That is something that they will be doing throughout their lives, and to do it on their own and not to turn to 
 
 outside authorities as ways -- as guides to tell them how to live.
 
MARTIN: So, obviously, you wrote this please, not because you had a particularly disturbing and unpleasant experience, but because you feel it 
 
 says something larger. What do you think this experience says?
 
LLOYD: I think as a nation and as universities and educators, we're at a moment of a paradigm shift. We've been thinking about race in one way in 
 
 terms of multiculturalism, in terms of many different races and communities all getting along and -- or on the path to getting along. And then, you 
 
 know, thankfully, black justice movement said, you're missing something. Like there's deep anti-blackness in this nation, in communities, in 
 
 ourselves that we need to root out.
 
And, you know, that's -- we're at a moment of paradigm shift, and it's not clear what's coming next. It's not clear what new structures and 
 
 institutions or habits that center anti-blackness look like. We're experimenting in different ways with what that could look like and we need 
 
 to be critical about those experience, see what works and see what doesn't.
 
And I think this Telluride example is, you know, one experiment that didn't work, but that just means that we should try harder, try new experience 
 
 because we can't go back to that old paradigm. But, you know, the kind of story that I recount is one that I hear over and over again form 
 
 colleagues, particularly liberal arts college kids, particularly at some public institutions, it's not just what happened in one extreme case that 
 
 happened in extreme circumstances, although, the circumstances sort of intensified the dynamic. But it's something that I do hear happening in 
 
 various versions from colleagues across the country.
 
MARTIN: But one of the reasons I'm interested in how -- what you draw from this is that you said at the outset of your essay that you really dismissed 
 
 people like John McWhorter, the linguist and social commentator, who has become very impassioned about what he sees as a kind of an anti-
 
 intellectualism, an identity driven sort of systems of thinking that he thinks have just taken over to many educational institutions.
 
And I got some from your essay that you were not very sympathetic to this argument at first but now, you are.
 
LLOYD: Right. So, I think the content is hugely important. Content of, you know, the sort of precepts of -- the theories of anti-blackness are hugely 
 
 important, right? There are -- the afterlives of slavery still inform American society. We need to listen to black women. We need to empower 
 
 black communities to have self-determination and so on, right? This is hugely important.
 
The forum in which we pursue that is also really important, to be careful about, right? We can't just say, here are a set of dogmas, now, you need to 
 
 believe them. These are things that we need to reach overtime, right? Going back and forth in conversation. We each need to develop into these sorts of 
 
 commitments that they can't just be impounded on us, especially on young folks.
 
MARTIN: You said that this is something that you were initially not very sympathetic to. but then this happened to you. And now, you're -- it sounds 
 
 to me like you're sort of questioning some of the same things that the students are questioning. Just, what is this seminar? Like, what is it for? 
 
 Should you be forced to read things that are upsetting to you that characterize your ethnicity in a light -- in a certain light? I mean, is 
 
 that accurate, that you're sort of now in a third phase of thinking like, what did really happen here? Are the students write in some way?
 
LLOYD: I think we all ought to be interrogating ourselves and, you know, taking the experiences that we have to ask me questions about what we once 
 
 believe. That's exactly what the seminar was for, right? To invite students, to hear from others, to think about their own experiences, to re-
 
 text and to think more deeply about the beliefs that they once help and to develop new beliefs.
 
You know, I'm still a believer in a seminar format. I think we do need to make changes to the seminar format, which some of the changes I try to 
 
 make, as I was teaching 2022 as opposed to 2014, changes that involved, you know, doing small group activities, doing partner activities, doing things 
 
 that could allow students to develop their own voice in a more private circumstance so they could feel empowered when we're in a big group. And 
 
 those who might feel less comfortable speaking or who are more shy, like I am, this position (ph), could feel more willing to speak in that big group. 
 
 So, I -- you know, I think the seminar needs to evolve.
 
But reading great books together whether, there are Angela Davis and Frederick Douglas or Plato and Kant, you know, I think that's important 
 
 stuff that we need to do and we need to continue doing in smart ways.
 <br>[14:50:00]
 
MARTIN: But the reason you wrote the essay and I think the reason that people are reacting to it is that it speaks to a larger debate. And so, the 
 
 question is, is there something in these institutions more broadly that needs to be addressed? And we're not just talking about, obviously, 
 
 colleges and universities, although they all can have that hothouse atmosphere you've described.
 
But, you know, lots of institutions seem to feel that they are debating, like, how -- what are the terms of our engagement? Who gets to decide with 
 
 those terms are? And I guess that's for the main question going forward for the rest of us, who were not part of this particular experiences. Is there 
 
 something we need to learn from that? And what is it. I mean, how do you balance allowing new thoughts to be emerged without allowing a new form of 
 
 smug self-righteousness and bullying to take over?
 
LLOYD: Yes. I think this is a difficult question that they were all grappling with in different ways. You know, we need strong institutions 
 
 that are resilient, that have clear roles and clear duties assigned to those roles. But we also need to differentiate space, right? Spaces where 
 
 we're asking difficult questions and spaces where we can be vulnerable. Spaces where we can be frustrated. From spaces where we need work together, 
 
 right, where we need to pursue one goal and, you know, get in line to get that goal done.
 
And I think one of the challenges that we're having right now culturally is that there's a collapse of this differentiation of space, right, where 
 
 we're thinking, you know, everywhere like we need to either have open discussion or, you know, just get in line and be on the same page. And in 
 
 fact, you know, these are both important things. They just have to operate in different sorts of domains.
 
MARTIN: Professor Vincent Lloyd, thanks so much for talking with us.
 
LLOYD: Thanks for having me.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HOLMES: Now, in a statement from Telluride Association about Professor Lloyd's claims, they say in part, and I'll just read some of it for you, 
 
 the students in the seminar asked Professor Lloyd and his co-faculty to "engage critically with points raised during the classroom discussion." 
 
 Adding, "Though harmful or erroneous comments need to be addressed, we want to leave the seminar having been challenged, learned things, and gained a 
 
 new perspective."
 
As for professor Lloyd's request for Telluride to intervene, they said this, "The board declined to do so, and instead asked Professor Lloyd to 
 
 work with a teaching assistants and students to adjust his teaching to meet student's needs. This process has worked successfully without other 
 
 faculty, and with Professor in his past work with Telluride Association."
 
Telluride also says that the claim that two students were voted out of the seminar by classmates is simply not true.
 
And finally, what was once a symbol of wealth and power, these days a boat that belonged to Saddam Hussein in his heyday is more a tourist store and 
 
 picnic spot, as you can see there. The 120-meter yacht called the Al-Mansur has been rusting away on the riverbed ever since it was attacked by the 
 
 U.S. led forces, and later capsized almost 20 years ago.
 
It was actually one of three yachts owned by Saddam with room for 200 guests, complete with a helipad. And though they were calls to preserve it 
 
 after his downfall, successive governments never wanted to spend the money on recovering it or removing it for that matter. So, what was once an 
 
 emblem of Saddam Hussein's ill-gotten gains and excesses is now a handy spot for local fishermen to reminisce about days gone by.
 
And before we leave, a viewer reminder of our top story, Russia's Vladimir Putin is now a wanted man. The International Criminal Court issuing a 
 
 warrant for his arrest for alleged war crimes, including deporting Ukrainian children into Russia. The ICC says there are "reasonable grounds 
 
 to believe Putin bears individual criminal responsibility for the alleged crimes" and for his "failure to exercise control properly over civilian and 
 
 military subordinates who committed the acts." The Kremlin calls the ICC's arrest warrant "outrageous and unacceptable."
 
Now, make sure you tune into "Amanpour" next week when Christiane will be speaking to the International Criminal Court prosecutor Karim Khan. Also, 
 
 next week, Christiane has Yusuf Cat Stevens on the show, talking about his long-awaited seventh album, "King of a Land."
 
All right. That is it for now. You can always catch us online, on our podcast, and across social media. And thanks for watching and spending part 
 
 of your day with me, and good-bye from Atlanta.
