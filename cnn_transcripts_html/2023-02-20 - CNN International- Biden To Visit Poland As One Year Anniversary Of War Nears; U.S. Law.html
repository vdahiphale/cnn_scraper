BIANCA NOBILO, CNN ANCHOR: Hello, and a warm welcome to our viewers joining us in the United States and all around the world. I'm Bianca Nobilo.
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR: I'm Max Foster, joining you live in London. Just ahead on CNN Newsroom.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: President Biden is set to mark one year since the start of Russia's war in Ukraine.
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Ukraine will never be a victory for Russia.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We saw another launch from North Korea.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Tests are in response to the joint military drills held by the U.S. and South Korea.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's something that this little, I don't think expected to ever happen.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I also noticed that I have this rational on my arm that was not there before I came here.
 
SHERROD BROWN, U.S. SENATOR: Corporate lobbyists have had far too much influence in our government, and they see this as the result.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Live from London, this is CNN Newsroom with Max Foster and Bianca Nobilo. FOSTER: It is Monday, February the 20th, 09:00 a.m. here in London, 04:00 a.m. in Washington, wherein the coming hours, President Joe Biden is set to depart for Poland to mark the first anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
 
BLITZER: Once there, he'll deliver remarks expressing continued U.S. support for Ukraine during a speech at the royal castle of Warsaw. Poland's Prime Minister says that he expects a very strong confirmation of joint efforts to defeat Russia in Ukraine during Mr. Biden's visit.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MATEUSZ MORAWIECKI, POLISH PRIME MINISTER: I cannot imagine that Putin and the Kremlin winning this war and then peace and stability is around us, because the nature, the very nature of Russia is to conquer other countries. We have to change that paradigm and we have to say Ukraine must win and Russia must be defeated. And I believe that the words of President Biden will reassure all Europe that the United States is with us in this fight for freedom and peace.

FOSTER: CNN's Priscilla Alvarez has a preview of the President's trip from the White House.
 
PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: President Joe Biden is set to visit Poland ahead of the one year mark of Russia invading Ukraine. And he will use this opportunity, White House officials say, to reinforce support for Ukraine and show unity among allies.
 
Now, during his visit, he is expected to meet with the Polish president, as well as with a group of eastern flank NATO allies. He is also expected to deliver remarks, and in those remarks, again show support and note the humanitarian and security assistance that Ukraine will continue to get as it fights this ongoing war with Russia.
 
Now, White House officials said those remarks are not only intended for the American people, but for the world, including Russia. Now, we got a sense from the administration on their tone with Russia when Vice President Kamala Harris, during the Munich Security Conference, said that Russia had committed crimes against humanity.
 
That is a step further from where the administration has been before, saying that they had committed war crimes. Now, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has said that it is important for allies to speed up, that they cannot have delay as they fight this war with Russia. Expect President Biden to address all of that during his visit in Poland.
 
Priscilla Alvarez, CNN, the White House.
 
NOBILO: Ukraine's President is confident that they're inflicting extreme losses on Russian forces in the eastern city of Vuhledar. In his nightly address on Sunday, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Ukrainian forces are in control of key areas like Kyiv. FOSTER: But E.U. officials warn Ukraine is in critical need of ammunition and is urging the rest of Europe to sit in and help. And U.S. lawmakers agree more training is needed to help Ukrainian forces effectively use the tools that they're being sent.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MICHAEL MCCAUL, U.S. HOUSE REPUBLICAN: For the past year, we've been very slow at getting these weapons in in the name of it being too provocative, whether it be stingers, javelins, these short-range artillery. Now longer-range artillery ATACMS, they can take out the Iranian drones in Crimea and also aviation like F-16.
 
If we put this stuff in from the very beginning of this conflict, a year from now may have been very different. As we look at the anniversary on February 24, the longer they drag this out, they play into Putin's hands. He wants this to be a long-protracted war because he knows that potential, he'll lose -- we could lose the will of the American people and therefore the Congress.
 <br>[04:05:05]
 
And we're seeing the same dynamic in the European Parliament. Strong support now, but they're worried that if this doesn't end with the resolution, you know, sooner rather than later, this will be an issue for us.
 
LINDSEY GRAHAM, U.S. SENATE REPUBLICAN: Virtually unanimous belief that we should be training Ukrainian pilots on the F-16 today, so they get the the jets as soon as possible. The British are training Ukrainian pilots. I believe a decision would be imminent here when we give back to Washington.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: Meanwhile, the U.S. is also keeping an eye on China. Officials believe Beijing might provide military support to Russia amid its continued invasion.
 
NOBILO: During a meeting with China's top diplomat, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken says that he warned Wang Yi of consequences if that should happen. Blinken added that Chinese companies have already been providing nonlethal support to Moscow. Here's what he told NBC.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: China is trying to have it both ways. Publicly, they present themselves as a country striving for peace in Ukraine. But privately, as I said, we've seen already over these past months the provision of nonlethal assistance that does go directly to aiding and abetting Russia's war effort.
 
And some further information that we are sharing today and that I think will be out there soon, that indicates that they are strongly considering providing lethal assistance to Russia. To the best of our knowledge -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What form?
 
BLINKEN: -- they haven't crossed that line yet.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: Well for more on all of this, we're joined by CNN Beijing Bureau Chief Steven Jiang. And here in London, we've got our International Diplomatic Editor Nic Robertson, and Clare Sebastian as well.
 
Steven, first of all, how -- what is Beijing's view on this and what they have been supporting in terms of weaponry or support to the Russians in Russia's -- in the United States' perspective at least?
 
STEVEN JIANG, CNN BEIJING BUREAU CHIEF: Yes, Max, the Chinese actually just formally and very strongly pushed back on Blinken's allegation with a Foreign Ministry official saying China does not accept the U.S. finger pointing or coercion on this issue, and turning the tables on Washington, saying it is the U.S. that's been sending weapons to the battlefield. So the U.S. is not qualified to lecture China on this issue.
 
So the language may sound familiar, but the back and forth between the two sides is interesting, because, as you mentioned, Wang Yi is actually visiting Moscow, meeting with senior Russian officials and likely Putin himself on the eve of the war's anniversary and paving the way, according to Russian media, for Xi Jinping visit to Moscow later this year.
 
So that's why it's clear the U.S. is increasingly frustrated over Beijing's role in this conflict, despite their public pledge of, quote unquote, neutrality. What we have seen in the past year is the two sides, China, Russia growing closer politically, but especially economically, bilateral trade soaring to a new high, for example.
 
That's why Blinken said, from day one there have been concerns about Beijing helping Moscow dodge the Western sanctions. And then, of course, it seems clear, despite some wishful thinking, Xi Jinping very much sticking to his commitment to the so called no limits partnership with Putin.
 
As analysts say, both strawman leaders very much convinced that the U.S. and its allies are out to contain and suppress both countries. Not to mention this latest revelation from Blinken comes on the heels of the whole spy balloon saga. So the fallout from that, of course, making it even more difficult for Beijing to show any willingness to work with the U.S. on this issue.
 
So that's why, despite Beijing telling Ukraine, for example, Wang Yi telling, his Ukrainian counterpart in Munich that they respect Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, the reality here is state media here still refusing to caught a Russian military campaign, an invasion, not to mention Xi Jinping still yet to talk to Zelenskyy.
 
So that's why a lot of experts say Beijing's assertion that it's the only peacemaker in the room just rings very hollow to many people. Max?
 
NOBILO: And Nic, you have literally just returned from the continent and you've been speaking to European leaders involved with all different perspectives of this conflict. The leaders of the eastern flank are obviously more concerned about Russian aggression, or perhaps the most concerned President of the European Commission, who, obviously, understands any kind of divisions that exist within Europe and also countries that are involved with possible -- any possible spur from this conflict, like Moldova.
 
One year on, how would you characterize the unity on the European continent and the possible red flags ahead?
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: I think there's greater unity. And the reason I'd say that is because that's come by necessity. Everyone has said that they will support Ukraine. Obviously, there are differences and we've seen some of those play out over tanks and now over fighter jets and over the heavier and the stronger the armaments, the more concern that some nations have expressed.
 
But I say it's come together because there's a necessity to do at now for the speed of getting it to Ukraine, to get Ukrainians trained, to get them there and get the equipment there in an organized way, because so much is coming and because it's so sophisticated.
 <br>[04:10:12]
 
When I spoke with Boris Pistorius, the German Defense Minister, at the weekend he said, you know, right on the margins of that security conference in Munich, he'd been meeting with other defense officials, particularly from Poland, but also with military industrialists to say how can we speed up getting the weapons and particularly more ammunition to the Ukrainians which is what President Zelenskyy ask for.
 
So it is happening and I think as well, speaking to other military experts there who are getting briefed on some of the sort of forward looking plans, there's a real belief that Ukrainian troops actually are really embracing the training they're getting. They're accelerating through it, doing better than people expected.
 
And some of the expansive and best case scenario ideas of what Ukraine can achieve on the ground are very bold and in a relatively short term. But it all points to that unity because that year has pushed everyone together and now bound them together in agreements on how to achieve this goal.
 
FOSTER: It's a big moment, isn't it? That the anniversary Biden being in Europe, in Poland for the anniversary. What do you think about the optics around that and how Moscow may be looking upon it?
 
CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: We're going to see some counter programming from Moscow. President Putin is giving a big speech to the Federal Assembly on Tuesday. I think you can look for him to present evidence, as Russia has continued to do over the past few months, that this is now a war not with Ukraine but with the west and with NATO and in particular the U.S.
 
They say that in part, I think, to make their own battlefield defeats look less humiliating. But this is also, you know, about an existential struggle for Russia. You heard the Foreign Ministry invoke Napoleon over comments by Macron just in the last couple of days. I think you can also expect them to be presenting evidence that they are not isolated on a global stage.
 
The Wang Yi, the Chinese top visit to Moscow this week will be critical. Lukashenko was in Moscow last week. All of that to try to show their strength that they still have alliances and that they're still able to continue in this fight.
 
BLITZER: And Nic, you mentioned just a moment ago ammunition, which has been one of the main conversations, along with fighter jets we've been had recently. Logistically speaking, how quickly can NATO allies ramp up production? And is there any concern that the war in Ukraine has exposed deficiencies in their individual defenses?
 
ROBERTSON: It has. I mean, Germany in particular is a case in point, it -- specifically because of its role in World War II had never built up its defense industry or defense -- own defense capability in the way that its NATO partners had, and finds itself still behind the sort of economic contribution of other NATO partners.
 
But some of this is technical as well. And that was another thing. The German Defense Minister was saying that some of these versions of the Leopard 2 tank, we think of Leopard 2, and he sprouted off into the Leopard 2, version 6, and the Leopard 2, version 6. And we need to kind of get these indifferent brigades and units that can work together.
 
But, for example, the Leopard 2 tank of the type that's going to, I think the Poles are giving to Ukrainians the version 4. He said Germany actually hasn't made ammunition for that particular tank for a couple of decades. So you need to go out and restart it. So it's not easy. And you have to find the money within budgets.
 
And in Germany's case, when you're trying not only to supply to Ukraine, but to build up your own national capacity, because the recognition for all these nations is that if this does -- if the war does escalate, they cannot leave themselves short. They cannot leave themselves short of equipment and in particular, ammunition.
 
FOSTER: When you're in Munich, what's the conversation around the fighter jets, because it just doesn't seem realistic to see them in any sort of action in the near future?
 
ROBERTSON: Well, it's certainly realistic, I think, at the moment, to see that their fighter pilots getting training on some of these aircraft. The British have indicated they will. I think what's interesting about this conversation is that it wasn't a dominant factor at the Munich Security Conference.
 
Ukraine's foreign minister said that he was sure Ukraine would get F- 16 and other type of fighter jets. There's a fighter jet that the Swedes make that's also a popular platform that could be useful in Ukraine's hands. I spoke to some former military -- U.S. military officials, very senior formerly, who said they were in no doubt that Ukraine could train up pilots within a couple of months, that this issue wasn't too far removed.
 
But I think the focus -- you know, the Ukrainians have recognized that they also need in the company of so much discussion and so many leaders. They also need to be a little bit more focused on what they can achieve in that environment.
 <br>[04:15:10]
 
And they've been very skilled at doing it, driving the narrative forward. Yes, you just said, yes, the tanks, but we want the aircraft. But in this environment, I think there was message of speed it up, speed it up. That was the key thing.
 
And also give us -- allow us into the E.U., allow us into NATO. We've heard calls from the Poles about that. We've called -- heard from the British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak NATO assurances going forward for Ukraine. So there were other things that they wanted beside the fighter plane. So they're very strategic.
 
But in terms of can they get, will they get fighter jets? Their pilots are being trained. I think that tells us all we need to know.
 
FOSTER: OK, Nic, thank you very much indeed. Clare and Steven as well.
 
Now tensions are escalating in the Korean peninsula as North Korea launches two more ballistic missiles on Monday morning. Japan's Defense Ministry says officials are still analyzing the data, but both missiles fell into the Sea of Japan to the east of the Korean peninsula.
 
NOBILO: Pyongyang says that the tests are in response to the joint military drills held by the U.S. and South Korea. And Japan's Prime Minister is calling for an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council in response to the launch.
 
FOSTER: With more, let's go to Paula Hancocks who joins us live from Seoul, South Korea. It was in response, wasn't it, to what was going on in terms of the drills?
 
PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Max and Bianca. What we've been seeing over the past couple of days is a bit of a tit for tat from both sides. But what was significant over the weekend and in recent days was what we saw on Saturday, which was a long-range missile launch, which on Sunday Pyongyang admitted was an intercontinental ballistic missile launch.
 
Now, it's the third time that they've done this kind of launch in less than a year. They are the longest range. They're the ones that they claim can hit mainland United States and do concern Washington more than any others. So really, that's what started this latest cycle that we're seeing. And then on Sunday, there was a joint Air Force drill between the U.S. and South Korea, including a B1 bomber flying over the Korean peninsula. We often see some kind of response from Pyongyang when these B1 bombers from the U.S. territories do come to the Korean peninsula. And it's exactly what we saw this morning.
 
So this Monday morning, a launch, again, two launches from North Korea, which they admitted to very quickly, saying that it was a super large multiple rocket launcher exercise, also saying that it's a means of tactical nuclear attack. And there would be more kind of launches and reactions should these U.S.-South Korean military drills continue.
 
Now, they will continue. In fact, this week we know that at the Pentagon, there is going to be a nuclear desktop, a tabletop, excuse me, drill from the U.S. and South Korea. This is likely to warrant some kind of response from North Korea. And then next month here on the Korean peninsula, there will be a significant joint military drill for about 11 days, the springtime exercises between the U.S. and South Korea, which historically have come up with some kind of response from North Korea as well.
 
So really in the coming days and weeks and months, we're not expecting any kind of change or any kind of pullback from the tension that we're seeing now. Max and Bianca?
 
FOSTER: OK, Paula in Seoul, thank you.
 
In the U.S., Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is calling for accountability from the Norfolk Southern Rail Company demanding stronger rail safety measures after a train carrying hazardous material derailed in Ohio two weeks ago.
 
NOBILO: The state's health department is opening a clinic in East Palestine Tuesday that will provide medical care to those affected by the derailment.
 
FOSTER: Meanwhile, a resident who lives near the crash site shared video with CNN. Watch this. You can see clouds in the water and bubbles on the surface in a creek near East Palestine.
 
NOBILO: And Pennsylvania Senator Doug Mastriano filmed his visit to the derailment site and to another local creek. Take a look.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DOUG MASTRIANO, U.S. SENATOR: Looks fine if you glanced at it. But watch what happens when I disturb the waterbed. Look at these chemicals. Look at these colors. The chemicals, and it has kind of a huge pain smell to it.
 
They're heavier than a water molecule. So they settle in the stream bed. And so it's going to take a lot of work to truly clear out and clean all these toxins and poison. There's no fish here. It's dead.
 
And Dan (ph), can you see those colors down there?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sure.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: Norfolk Southern has promised to give $1,000 payments to affected residents. Earlier, the company's CEO defended the decision to detonate tanks carrying toxic chemicals.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ALAN SHAW, CEO, NORFOLK SOUTHERN: I think we did what we needed to do in order to prevent an uncontrolled explosion in the evening. Private well testing, we need to continue to monitor and test the wells and wait for those test results to come back.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[04:20:10]
 
NOBILO: Meantime, Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown says that the air and water in East Palestine are safe, but understands residents' concerns. And he vows to hold the rail company accountable.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BROWN: They're right to be skeptical. The EPA administrator, when I was there, both the state and the federal EPA administrators said that. But when you return to your home, we think the water is safe. And when you return to your home, you should be tested again for your water and your soil and your air, not to mention those that have their own wells.
 
They have made promises, my job, and I talked to a Republican Congressman Bill Johnson. I was there with him. We are working together on this to make sure that Norfolk Southern lives up to everything it needs to do. It's way more than $1,000 check per person.

FOSTER: The people of small town of Plains, Georgia, and many others around the world are praying for former U.S. President Jimmy Carter as he receives hospice care at home. And on Sunday, the church where Carter has taught Sunday school for decades prayed for his family.
 
CNN's Isabel Rosales is in Plains, Georgia with more.
 
ISABEL ROSALES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: We know from an official that President Biden has been maintaining close contact with the Carter family. He's been informed of Carter's declining health and his decision to undergo hospice care. But now we're hearing from President Biden directly via Tweet.
 
He put out this comment saying, "To our friends Jimmy and Rosalynn and to their family, Jill and I are with you in prayer and send you our love. We admire you for the strength and humility that you have shown in difficult times. May you continue your journey with grace and dignity, and God grant you peace." So I am standing right now very close to Main Street here in Plains, Georgia, the hometown of Jimmy Carter, where everywhere you look there was a piece of history, of Carter history here. To my left, beyond what you can see through these trees behind me, his high school, where he learned about American history and probably never thinking that one day he would become Mr. 39, the 39th President of the United States.
 
And actually, as we look down this way, beyond the train tracks, less than a mile away, a couple of blocks, is the home that he built in 1961, the home that he still lives in today with his wife. And over to your left, right here, this building that's now a museum, that is the presidential campaign headquarters for his 1976 presidential bid.
 
This is the spot where thousands of people would drop by to get a sense of how a peanut farmer wanted to become president of the United States. I also want you to take a look at this video. This hospice news is really coming four and a half months after he celebrated his 98th birthday.
 
This video you're looking at was the weekend before that, where they are at the Plains Annual Peanut Festival, waving at the crowds there. This may have been one of his last public appearances here in Plains.
 
Now the news, this hospice news of Carter preparing for his end of life, his family preparing, is understandably, rocking Plains.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
PHILIP KURLAND, OWNER, PLAINS TRADING POST: This is emotional. The fact that he won't be coming in the store anymore, he won't be here, he won't be at meetings. But, you know, every little thing I do here, he'll be with me.
 
If I said something to his family, I would say, yes, I know you're mourning, and yes, I know you're hurting, but I hope you celebrate his life too, because what a life, what a well-done life.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ROSALES: And Carter has always been known as a man of deep, deep faith. In fact, he taught at Maranatha Baptist Church, Sunday school every single week until his health issues really forced him to take a step back away from that. In Sunday service, his congregation, his fellow people in faith were sending out prayers to him and wishing his family comfort.
 
Isabel Rosales, CNN, Plains, Georgia.
 
NOBILO: 14 million Americans in 17 states are under winter weather alerts today. The alerts are from the west coast to the northeastern region of Michigan.
 
FOSTER: Yes, a snowfall of 1 feet to 3 feet possible across the cascades and Rocky Mountains over the next day or two. On Tuesday, Flagstaff, Arizona could get up to a foot of snow and gusts of up to 70 miles per hour. Some places across the Upper Plains and Midwest may see 1 feet to 2 feet of snow later this week.
 
NOBILO: Still ahead, America's top diplomat visits Turkey after it was ravaged by earthquakes. What Antony Blinken promised the country to help in its recovery process.
 
FOSTER: And a New Mexico woman's terrifying yearlong abduction ordeal comes to a dramatic end and it's all captured on camera.

NOBILO: In Brazil, heavy rain and landslides have swept through Sao Paulo state, killing at least 36 people. Officials have declared a state of calamity in several coastal cities where hundreds have now been displaced.
 
FOSTER: Well, this is happening during Carnival, the popular festival that attracts millions of tourists each year. Officials fear that many of those partygoers could be trapped in flooded areas.
 
Now this hour, the U.S. Secretary of State is scheduled to meet with the President of Turkey in Ankara. They're expected to discuss security and recovery efforts after a powerful earthquake ravaged the country.
 
NOBILO: Earlier, Antony Blinken announced an additional $100 million in U.S. aid for Turkey, as well as hard-hit Syria. More than 46,000 people across both countries have now been confirmed dead two weeks after the earthquake struck.
 
CNN's Nada Bashir joins us now from southern Turkey with more. Nada, bring us up to date on what the countries are now focusing on.
