(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BECKY ANDERSON, CNN HOST, CONNECT THE WORLD: Well, on the left of your screen the podium at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, where Joe 
 
 Biden will deliver his final speech as U.S. President to world leaders. 
 
On the right, destruction of a residential building in the suburbs of Beirut in Lebanon after an Israeli air strike earlier today. It's 09:00 
 
 a.m. in New York, it is 04:00 p.m. in Beirut, and it's 05:00 p.m. here in Abu Dhabi. I'm Becky Anderson. You're watching "Connect the World". 
 
Mr. Biden due to speak shortly. This is his final appearance on that stage as U.S. President, coming against the backdrop of a world at war, and not 
 
 just in the Middle East, where Israel carried out a second wave of strikes against Hezbollah today and the wider conflict Mr. Biden was hoping to 
 
 prevent appears to be coming to fruition.
 
But also, in Ukraine and Sudan, a year after some of the same leaders met in the very same room in New York, in the world's hot spots, fighting is 
 
 relentless. Civilians are dying, and the prospect of peace, or at least a ceasefire, across any one of these files, it seems, is still elusive. We 
 
 will be following this for you as we wait Mr. Biden's remarks.
 
First CNN's Ben Wedeman is in Beirut, where another Israeli strike targeted the southern suburbs Ben, as we get ready to hear from Joe Biden set the 
 
 stage, if you will, on how things are quickly deteriorating in Lebanon. What's the latest?
 
BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Becky, within the last hour, there's been a strike on the southern suburbs of Beirut, on the -- 
 
 neighborhood. It was a strike on a five-storey building. The top two stories seem to have been completely demolished. At this point there's a 
 
 lot of speculation who about who the target might have been.
 
So, we don't really know at this point, but we do know there are fatalities and there are injuries. On social media, we're seeing a picture of a car in 
 
 front of that building with the limbs of a dismembered body draped on that car. That's the second strike on the southern suburbs in the last 24 hours. 
 
Yesterday, the Israelis struck a building claiming to have been targeting Ali Karaki, who is the Commander of the Southern Forces of Hezbollah. But 
 
 Hezbollah came out with a statement shortly afterwards, saying that he was alive and well. The broader picture continued. Israeli air strikes on the 
 
 south and the Beka Valley, not quite as intense as yesterday. 
 
Yesterday, since the strikes began according to the Ministry of Health here, the death toll is 558 among them, 50 children and 94 women, with more 
 
 than 1800 injured. Now, we just got a statement from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, saying that among the dead are two 
 
 employees of UNHCR.
 
Now, one Lebanese nongovernmental organization is saying that as many as 100,000 people have fled to the south. This afternoon, we were at a center 
 
 for -- to take in some of those who have come from the south. They were telling us that it took as many as 14 hours to get to Beirut on those jam-
 
 packed high, jam-packed highway to the Lebanese capital. 
 
They told us what they witnessed was intense bombing, many buildings destroyed, they said, along the way. They say, saw many dead and injured. 
 
 The situation clearly is going from bad to worse, and the feeling is that the government, until now, is able to cope. We were at one hospital where 
 
 we saw one injured coming in from the south. They too had spent hours and hours on the road trying to get out of that area to the relative safety of 
 
 Beirut, Becky. 
 
ANDERSON: All right. Ben, we heard from Benjamin Netanyahu last night. I just want to play a little bit of that sound stand by.
 <br>[09:05:00]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER: To those who didn't understand, I would like to clarify Israel's policy. We are not waiting for a threat. 
 
 We are ahead of it everywhere, in every arena, anytime we're eliminating seniors, eliminating commanders, eliminating rockets, and counting those 
 
 who try to hurt us, we will hurt them gravely. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, that is the prime minister's position, and he reportedly told his security cabinet that the country's aim in Lebanon is to cut quote 
 
 Hezbollah from the war with Hamas. Now there will be many who question whether that is even achievable. But how does that response, that narrative 
 
 from Israel, go down where you are?
 
WEDEMAN: There's no question, Becky that Israel has been able to eliminate many of the senior military commanders of Hezbollah that they have been 
 
 able to seriously handicap the organization with those pager blasts, the walkie talkie blast, the strike last Friday on Beirut that killed Ibrahim 
 
 Akil, a senior Hezbollah commander. 
 
But let's look at what's going on the ground, Hezbollah still continues to fire back at Israel. Some of the rockets reached inside the country. They 
 
 still have the ability to do that. Obviously, Israel, with its superior U.S. supplied weaponry and aircraft, have an upper hand, but Hezbollah is 
 
 showing no signs of giving up, no hints that some-how it's going to change its course. 
 
And what's important to note is that when it puts out its notices about their individual attacks on Israel, it used to be that they the preamble 
 
 was that it was in solidarity with the people in Gaza, in support of Hamas. Now the phrase is that in defense of the people of Lebanon and -- of the 
 
 country of Lebanon. 
 
So, they continue, basically to carry on as they did before. It appears that their focus is trying to strike deeper into Israel, as opposed to what 
 
 we've seen by and large in the 11 months since October 7 -- October 8th, when Hezbollah started firing, they were focusing basically on military 
 
 positions on the border with Israel. Now they're going deeper in trying, obviously, to inflict more pain and restore the deterrence that existed by 
 
 more or less for the last 11 months Becky.
 
ANDERSON: It's good to have you Ben, I'm going to let you go thank you. Joining us now is our Global Affairs Analyst Kim Dozier, joining us from 
 
 Washington. And Kim as we await Joe Biden's speech in New York at the UN, I just want to play a little bit of what he said this time last year to close 
 
 out what was his UN General Assembly speech. Have a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Let me close with this. At this inflection point in history we're going to be judged by 
 
 whether or not we live up to the promises we made to ourselves, to each other, to the most vulnerable and all those who will inherit the world we 
 
 create, because that's what we're doing.
 
Will we find within ourselves the courage to do what must be done, to preserve the planet, to protect human dignity, to provide opportunity for 
 
 people everywhere, and to defend the tenets of the United Nations. I got only one answer to that question. We must and we will.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, many will reflect on those words just a few weeks after that speech, of course, in September of 2023 was the attack by Hamas on 
 
 Israel of October 7th and since then, of course, certainly the region where I am, and I'm in the Gulf region, which -- you know is, by extension, 
 
 affected by what is going on in Gaza, in Lebanon, in the West Bank. 
 
I mean, the region has descended further into chaos. And a year on, Ukraine still roiling as well. As he takes to the podium in the next hour for his 
 
 final foreign policy speech. How do you expect that he will sell his legacy? What do you expect to hear from the president today?
 <br>[09:10:00]
 
KIMBERLY DOZIER, CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: I think he's going to try to say, look, we accomplished these historic things. We got more than 100 
 
 countries together to fight against Russian aggression against Ukraine, and that collection of nations remains in that fight, trying to support 
 
 Ukraine, no matter how much Ukraine might say that support is not enough, and has been slow in coming, et cetera, et cetera. 
 
On Israel remember, right before October 7th, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan had just published an essay in foreign affairs where in 
 
 print, and I've saved it in print he calls the Middle East quiet. So, it is obvious that the Biden Administration had taken its eye off of what was 
 
 happening in the Middle East, or didn't understand the undercurrents of frustration among the Palestinian people that helped fuel Hamas' terror 
 
 plot for October 7th. 
 
So, I guess they tried really hard, but they've had shuttle diplomacy with the Head of the CIA and the State Department going to the Middle East and 
 
 trying to come up with ceasefire solutions. But here we are approaching another October 7th with all but an Israeli ground incursion into Lebanon 
 
 underway.
 
And Gaza much of it flattened with civilians displaced, starvation in many quarters, a little clean water. It's not a great picture, no matter how 
 
 President Biden tries to cast it.
 
ANDERSON: Kim, you're going to stay with me throughout the next couple of hours for the time being. Thank you. We are, of course, as I say, waiting 
 
 on Joe Biden's speech in the next hour or so in New York. Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian has been speaking to CNN about the deepening conflict 
 
 between Israel and Hezbollah. 
 
He sat down with my colleague, Fareed Zakaria on the sidelines of the UN gathering for what was an exclusive interview. Have a listen to just part 
 
 of what they discussed.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
FAREED ZAKARIA, HOST, FAREED ZAKARIA GPS: Will you counsel Hezbollah to restrain itself? We know that Iran has a lot of influence over Hezbollah. 
 
MASOUD PEZESHKIAN, IRANIAN PRESIDENT: Hezbollah, by herself, cannot stand against the country that is armed to the teeth and has access to weapon 
 
 systems that are far superior to anything else. Now, if there is a need, Islamic countries must convene meeting in order to formulate a reaction to 
 
 what is occurring. 
 
Now, if we're speaking of Hezbollah alone, what can Hezbollah do alone? The regional countries, Islamic countries must sit together and prior to 
 
 anything more severe taking place, I do believe that international organizations today, we did have a meeting with at the United Nations, with 
 
 Mr. Guterres.
 
And tomorrow, we will see such discussions and topics taking place, and we must not allow for Lebanon to become another Gaza at the hands of Israel. 
 
 Hezbollah cannot do that alone. Hezbollah cannot stand alone against the country that is being defended and supported and supplied by Western 
 
 countries, European countries and the United States of America.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: And you can watch the full interview with Iran's President on Fareed Zakaria GPS this Sunday at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time, that is 03:00 
 
 p.m. if you happen to be watching in London. Well, the election of the reformist Iranian president could signal a turning point for the country's 
 
 nuclear program, something the Iranian Foreign Minister spoke about ahead of the UN General Assembly. 
 
The Foreign Minister stated that his country would be open to renewed nuclear talks. The man who would be at the forefront of those negotiations, 
 
 or certainly part of them, Rafael Grossi, who directs the International Atomic Energy Agency, also posting on X quote that he has reestablished 
 
 contact with the foreign minister and would be heading to Tehran soon. 
 
While Iran's nuclear file is a concern, the IAEA has also been keeping a close watch, of course, on Ukraine, where fighting has drawn dangerously 
 
 close to a number of critical nuclear facilities, sparking fears of a nuclear accident. More to discuss the state of nuclear non-proliferation 
 
 globally, as it were. I'm joined now by the IAEA Director Rafael Grossi, it's good to have you sir. Against the backdrop of the United Nations 
 
 General Assembly. 
 <br>[09:15:00]
 
There is an awful lot going on in New York. Iran has signalled an openness to renewed nuclear talks. Is that a surprise to you after so long? And how 
 
 might those talk progress at this stage, if at all?
 
RAFAEL GROSSI, INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY DIRECTOR GENERAL: Well, first of all, it's good to talk to you Becky as always. Well, it's not a 
 
 surprise. I think this is what we were expecting. We had a transition in Iran, of course, unexpected, unplanned, caused by the passing of the former 
 
 president and a foreign minister with whom you may remember, I was in a very intense phase of our discussions back in the spring. 
 
But happened -- what happened? And of course, after the transition, 40 days of transition, then the elections and the coming to power of Pezeshkian and 
 
 the foreign minister, there is an expectation. It is interesting to note that the foreign minister used to be the nuclear negotiator, and that says 
 
 a lot about the place that the nuclear issue has in Iranian foreign policy or in Iranian life, I would say, writ large. 
 
ANDERSON: Right.
 
GROSSI: So indeed, I saw him last evening here in New York. We are preparing for my visit to Tehran, which will take place in the next few 
 
 weeks. And of course, this idea of -- as I was describing it myself, a reestablishment of a contact. We have to be clear on both sides of what the 
 
 open questions are?
 
What we want to achieve? And this against the backdrop of what you were discussing a minute ago in the world in general, on this program. Because 
 
 while we have had a pause in these nuclear negotiations well, the centrifuges keep spinning, and the program is moving forward. 
 
So, no policy or no action on the issue is not solving anything. We might not -- we might choose not to look at it, but the problem is going to get 
 
 worse and worse. So, this is what we are trying to do to set the stage of a next phase.
 
ANDERSON: Yeah, OK.
 
GROSSI: Yeah.
 
ANDERSON: At the beginning of this Biden Administration, getting these talks back on track was a real priority, although it took some months 
 
 before we saw any sort of realistic efforts. And then things, of course, fell apart, and we know what Donald Trump's position has been, at least in 
 
 the past with regards Iran. 
 
And we're only 45 days or less from an election. So, the window for a Biden Administration, of course, is really, really short here. And a U.S. 
 
 official has said, in regards to talks, and I quote here, I don't think we're going to be talking to the Iranian government any time soon so I hear 
 
 what you've just said. Is there a possibility of a deal without the United States?
 
GROSSI: Not at all. I don't think we can envisage that kind of thing. I think it is obvious that the United States is central to this. There have 
 
 been some indirect contacts between the United States and Iran. And I believe that might -- that might continue. You may ask the U.S. officials 
 
 about this.
 
But I think there is, at some level, some degree of contact. But what we need to see, and this is where the agency becomes indispensable, because we 
 
 are the only ones there. This is not a small detail all the other stock, but we have our inspectors there. We know what we know. 
 
We also know what we do not know or we are not seeing. I have discussed this with you in the past. We have lost a lot of visibility of the things 
 
 we would like to be seeing, and this is something I will be discussing with my Iranian counterparts in the next few days and weeks, so that we can't --
 
ANDERSON: -- do you expect to get the access that you need Rafael?
 
GROSSI: Well, that would be -- that would be part of the discussion. Because, of course -- you know in any diplomatic negotiation, the sides 
 
 position themselves according to what they believe are their possibilities and the ability to get to the results they want. So, I will be asking for 
 
 certain things, but of course, the different players will be looking at. And of course, there is an election here in the United States.
 
ANDERSON: Right.
 
GROSSI: There is a degree of -- but you know what the advantage is here? You were talking about the position of the previous administration. I think 
 
 the advantage here is that we know that we need to move to a certain framework with Iran. Some may wish to call it the JCPOA you know, revisit 
 
 it. Obviously, the JCPOA as it existed 10 years ago it is amazing know? But it was signed almost 10 years ago. Is not adequate to the situation of a 
 
 country that has moved forward, turbocharged its program --
 <br>[09:20:00]
 
ANDERSON: Understood.
 
GROSSI: -- and so we need to, at the very least adapt it. But if not, you will have to look at this situation and see what can be checked and what 
 
 can be put on hold.
 
ANDERSON: Iran has also, of course, deepened its relationship with Russia during that time. Iran's Foreign Minister has acknowledged that with the 
 
 war in Ukraine and in Gaza -- you know the geopolitical sort of background to talks has changed. 
 
I want to get to Russia's war with Ukraine, because today you expressed concern over the Kursk station, one of the three largest nuclear power 
 
 plants in Russia and the largest energy source, of course, in the Kursk Region. And you said this, and I quote for our viewers purposes. Kursk 
 
 station is extremely exposed. It does not have a protective containment dome and is similar to the Chernobyl Plant, making it particularly 
 
 vulnerable.
 
GROSSI: Correct.
 
ANDERSON: -- even bringing up the name of Chernobyl will concern people around the world. 
 
GROSSI: Correct.
 
ANDERSON: Why then, have you chosen not to deploy permanent observer mission? And what's the purpose of platforming your concern now, at this 
 
 point? How could -- what are your concerns?
 
GROSSI: Well, my concern is very clear. It's caused by the fact that you have a nuclear power plant in a combat zone, again, like Zaporizhzhia. Here 
 
 we had the incursion of Ukrainian forces back in August, as you remember, and they have been moving in a region more or less -- you know a few miles, 
 
 let's put it like that, from the nuclear power plant. 
 
So, this talk took me to Kursk, because we always need to see and judge with our own eyes. And, of course, like you were quoting me, this is a 
 
 nuclear power plant which has certain technical characteristics that make them -- I mean, you can walk over the core of the reactor, as I was doing 
 
 myself.
 
So, and you have a normal roof. So, if there is an impact, even with a small drone with some with a kilogram or two of conventional explosives, 
 
 you could have a very serious situation. I have been discussing this with the Russians. I went to Kyiv. You may remember just a few days ago. I 
 
 discussed this with President Zelenskyy as well. 
 
So, fact that we have not deployed a permanent group of people there is because the situation is completely different for Zaporizhzhia. Here you 
 
 have a normally operating Russian power plant in the control of the Russian Federation, which is not far from a combat zone. So, the political 
 
 territorial integrity situation is different. 
 
But -- what I have discussed with my Russian counterparts, is that, of course, in case something happened, we will be deploying people 
 
 immediately. Because we need to -- and the international community needs to know -- you know that we have also -- we have a war of ammunition, and we 
 
 have a war of narratives, where people are saying, you remember also this cyber.
 
ANDERSON: Right.
 
GROSSI: I mean, so many things have happened -- haven't it. And we have this big fire on one of the cooling towers of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear 
 
 Power Plant. And the narratives there were completely opposed, so we went there to check what was happening.
 
ANDERSON: And let me --
 
GROSSI: And this is what the IAEA does.
 
ANDERSON: -- stop you there. Because yeah, absolutely. And to your point, and I just want to, very briefly, I've got less than a minute left. What is 
 
 going on at Zaporizhzhia at present? You have described it in the past as fragile as sort of precipice. I mean, precarious. How would you describe 
 
 it's --?
 
GROSSI: Those words were proven right when you see what happened on August 11th, I think it was when the cooling tower was up on fire. So, there is a 
 
 constant exposure of the facility to either hits by drones or movement of troops around it. So, I say the same, and things continue to happen, so the 
 
 pressure is still on.
 
ANDERSON: Rafael, it's always good to have you. Thank you very much indeed for joining us. Rafael Grossi, the Head of the IAEA out of New York, for 
 
 you today. And we have our eye on UN Headquarters in New York. World Leaders gathered there now, taking turns to address the General Assembly. 
 
 Next our U.S. President Joe Biden is next at the podium. We will be right back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:25:00]
 
ANDERSON: Well, you're watching "Connect the World". I'm Becky Anderson. Welcome back. And you are looking at live pictures from the 79th UN General 
 
 Assembly in New York. Secretary General of the UN, Antonio Guterres speaking. President Biden is scheduled to speak within the next hour, and 
 
 we will get to that live when it happens. 
 
We are now exactly six weeks from Election Day, when America picks its next president. Donald Trump heads to the State of Georgia today, where he is 
 
 expected to speak about manufacturing and the economy. Now, Trump has been playing the fear card in his swing through the battleground states, warning 
 
 Pennsylvanians at a rally on Monday, vote for me or you will lose your farm.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If they get in, your energy costs are going through the roof OK. They're going 
 
 to go through the roof. You won't be -- you won't have a farm very long. I will tell you that.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, another stop, in the town of Indiana, the former president told rally goers that he'd seen news reports that women don't like him, and 
 
 had this message for female voters.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TRUMP: Sadly, women are poorer than they were four years ago. Much poorer. Are less healthy than they were four years ago. I am your protector. I want 
 
 to be your protector. As President, I have to be your protector. I hope you don't make too much of it. I hope the fake news. Does it go he wants to be 
 
 their protector? Well, I am as president, I have to be your protector.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris is weighing a trip to the southern border on Friday, according to sources, as she tries to 
 
 close the gap with Trump on what is a key issue, that of immigration. Harris is in Washington today for meetings, but she is set to resume 
 
 campaigning in Pennsylvania on Wednesday as part of a Barnstorm through several key swing states.
 
While off the trail, Harris scored a mass endorsement CNN has learned more than 400 economists and former high ranking U.S. policymakers have said 
 
 that they are backing Harris as she tries to cut into Trump's lead on the economy.
 
Well, as the candidates take the battlegrounds by storm a new snapshot of the state of the race shows Trump with a slight edge in three key states in 
 
 what are known as the Sun Belt. "The New York Times" Siena College Poll shows Trump leading the vice president by five points in Arizona. He 
 
 remains ahead, but within the margin of error in both Georgia and North Carolina.
 
We're looking at the country's overall choice for president. CNN's latest "Poll of Polls" shows Harris ahead by three points. It is important to 
 
 note, it's the Electoral College, not the popular vote in the United States, that determines the winner. CNN's John King breaks down the issues 
 
 driving voters' decisions in -- these key swing states. Have a look at this. 
 <br>[09:30:00]
 
JOHN KING, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Let's look at the top issues in these three states. Again, forgive me, I just want to stretch 
 
 this out. The economy is the number one issue in all three states, not by huge margins, but 26 percent, 28 percent, 25 percent Arizona, Georgia, 
 
 North Carolina, immigration, second in Arizona, abortion, third.
 
Immigration and abortion, kind of trade almost in a tie for second and third when it comes to the other battleground states. So, the issues 
 
 economy and immigration, we know they're Trump's issues, and abortion is a Harris issue. So, voters were asked in this poll who's -- what candidate 
 
 best represents you on your issue?
 
So, it could be the economy for many voters. It might be something else, just generically, who's the candidate you trust on your top issue? And look 
 
 at this, again, I'm just going to stretch this out on just the generic top issue question. It's narrow, but Trump leads in all three states, right? 
 
 So, people are saying I'm with him.
 
ANDERSON: Yeah.
 
KING: He's best for me on my top issue. Here's what's even more damning. We know issue number one is the economy, and just look at this, and we've seen 
 
 this again. This is only one poll. Don't over invest in any one poll, but we have seen this data in other polls.
 
This is a constant problem for the vice president who's best on the economy, Trump by 14 points, leads in Arizona, Trump by 12 points, leads in 
 
 Georgia, Trump by 13 points leads in North Carolina.
 
ANDERSON: Yeah.
 
KING: It's the top issue, and Trump has a huge edge. That's a problem for the vice president.
 
ANDERSON: John King, for you, and we will be right back. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: Right, and an update for you on our breaking news out of Lebanon, at least six people killed and 15 injured by an Israeli strike in the area 
 
 of Ghobeiry in Beirut's southern suburbs. That is, according to the Lebanese Ministry of Health. This was a targeted strike, it seems, by the 
 
 Israelis in the past hour or so, or hours or so.
 
This was a preliminary update from the ministry, suggesting that the number of casualties could still rise. These are images coming directly into CNN 
 
 from Beirut of the scene, CNN has reached out to the IDF, the Israel Defense Forces, for additional information on the strike in Beirut.
 
It has it is yet to hear back in the past, the IDF has used strikes on the capital Beirut to kill senior Hezbollah figures. This is the fifth Israeli 
 
 strike in Beirut. Hezbollah dominated southern suburbs this year. This, of course, the backdrop to what will be Joe Biden's final address as U.S. 
 
 President in New York today at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
 <br>[09:35:00]
 
His speech, of course, comes amid the escalating bloodshed in the Middle East, with Israel's ongoing war against Hamas in Gaza. And now these 
 
 extensive air strikes on Hezbollah targets in Lebanon. Lebanese Health officials say have killed hundreds of people, including women and children.
 
Mr. Biden is expected to emphasize the need for global partners to try and confront these and other conflicts in what one senior administration 
 
 official calls a changed and more difficult world. Ahead of Mr. Biden's speech, the U.N. Secretary General took to the podium today, describing 
 
 what he calls a non-stop nightmare in Gaza and what must be done to end the violence in the Middle East.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANTONIO GUTERRES, U.N. SECRETARY-GENERAL: For those who go on and they're mining that goal with more settlements, more land grabs, more incitement. I 
 
 ask, what is the alternative? How could the world accept the one state in which a large number of Palestinians would be included without any freedom, 
 
 any rights or dignity?
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, Kim Dozier is back with us from Washington. I'm delighted to say we also have Alex Marquardt at the U.N. and Nic Robertson is in Tel 
 
 Aviv. And let me start with you there in Tel Aviv, Nic, what is the Israeli military saying about these targeted operations? What from their 
 
 perspective, have they achieved and how long might they sustain this level of intensity? Is it clear?
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: No, it's not clear. But I think what is clear is that they feel the idea feels that it has momentum 
 
 and that it hasn't finished the job, and we got a strong sense of that when General Herzi Halevi, the IDF Chief of Staff, spoke today, he said, 
 
 Hezbollah should not be given a reprieve, that they must the IDF must continue with full force, that they will be speeding up operations and that 
 
 actions must be continued and vigorous across all areas.
 
So, I think the impression they're creating is the strikes into the Beqaa Valley today, the strikes just across the border, which have not just been 
 
 airstrikes, which over the past day, have involved the IDF says, 2000 munitions, 1500 different targets, across the border today there was 
 
 artillery and tank fire.
 
And I think tank fire across the border is important to note because it means its relatively short range, and that's a mobile piece of equipment 
 
 there that potentially, and the IDF is not saying this, but it would certainly be part of the equipment you would expect the IDF to use if they 
 
 were to put troops across the border, because they say their aim is to get Hezbollah to push back from Israel's northern border, and that's where 
 
 things stand.
 
And as far as the targeted assassinations, this definitely appears to be a track that Israel is committed to. They failed in a targeted assassination 
 
 to hit the apparent intended target yesterday. Today, we don't know who the target is. Undoubtedly, we'll find out more, but as you reported that six 
 
 people dead there in that building and 15 wounded, and one would expect that the target was either an individual or only a couple of individuals, 
 
 Becky.
 
ANDERSON: That's right, and the images that we're looking at on the right- hand side of your screen, folks are coming to us from Beirut and Lebanon, where that targeted attack happened just some hours ago. Alex, Israel has 
 
 described this as a strategy of escalation to de-escalate.
 
Our teams have heard from the State Department on that strategy, escalation to de-escalate, with one senior official telling CNN quote, I can't recall, 
 
 at least in recent memory, a period in which an escalation or intensification led to a fundamental de-escalation and led to profound 
 
 stabilization of the situation.
 
What's the level of concern from this current U.S. Administration as Joe Biden gets set to make his speech there in New York, is his closing speech, 
 
 as it were with six weeks ago for this election. How is Biden planning to address this crisis in his speech? Is that clear?
 
ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, he certainly is planning to address and of course, it's major concern. I mean, 
 
 the positive spin that they're putting on it is that the U.N. General Assembly is a great place to have meetings.
 <br>[09:40:00]
 
My colleague Kayla Tausche has just reported that Biden's top national security officials who handle the Middle East will be here in New York and 
 
 having informal meetings on the sidelines. We are not expecting the Israelis until later that this week, so that would presumably be with some 
 
 of the Arab partners.
 
We know that the King of Jordan, the Emir of Qatar, for example, there speaking not too long after President Biden today. No doubt, the war in 
 
 Gaza and this fear over escalation of broadening conflict in the Middle East will be a central part of what President Biden is looking to speak 
 
 about today.
 
But he has to walk a very difficult line, Becky, in that this is his final speech on what is essentially the biggest of international stages. So, in 
 
 this moment, he wants to talk about, you know, the accomplishments of his administration, the priorities of his administration, what still needs to 
 
 be done going forward, and co-operation around the world.
 
He doesn't just want to focus on the Middle East, but on conflicts, also in Sudan, of course, in Sudan, of course, in Ukraine, he wants to talk about 
 
 competition with China, climate change and AI, but without question, Becky, the concerns about what is going on in Lebanon right now is casting a large 
 
 shadow over this General Assembly.
 
The French have asked for an emergency meeting later this week. There are divisions, I would say, among the U.S. Administration about this Israeli 
 
 strategy of escalating to de-escalate. But where the U.S. and Israel appear to be on the same page is they want to get Hezbollah to a point, Hassan 
 
 Nasrallah, the Head of Hezbollah, to a point where he will come to the negotiating table.
 
Both Israel and the U.S. want to essentially decouple the conflict in Lebanon from the conflict in Gaza, because the U.S. recognizes that those 
 
 ceasefire talks are not going anywhere for the time being. So, they want to keep Lebanon as its own separate entity.
 
And clearly, the Israeli strategy here is to inflict as much punishment and pain as is needed to get Hezbollah to the negotiating table to come to some 
 
 kind of diplomatic solution. But of course, Becky, we are not close to that. It does not appear, for the time being, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: And you rightly point out the regional leaders in New York this week and the conflict certainly discuss with the UAE President. Of course, 
 
 we're broadcasting from Abu Dhabi here, discussed with the UAE President, who met with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris Monday at the White House.
 
Kim, let me bring you in here. CNN is reporting the U.S. officials are somewhat concerned that this global gathering could further inflame. What 
 
 are mounting tensions in the Middle East? I just wonder what you make of that sourced information. I mean, after all, the UNGA this week is where 
 
 global issues are discussed.
 
And it does, it will seem to many watching this is a little ripe from the U.S. to sort of worry that, you know, this might further inflame the 
 
 situation. I mean, there is no way that the U.S. can muzzle people making their points this week. Is that?
 
DOZIER: Absolutely not. You've already seen the Iranian Leader call for a gathering or a unification of Muslim nations to fight what's going on in 
 
 terms of Israel's onslaught on Lebanon. No mention of the fact that Lebanon has been hitting Israel for almost a year.
 
You also had the U.N. recently passed a non-binding resolution that would - - that calls Israel's occupation its presence in the West Bank and Gaza as illegal, and calls on it to withdraw. Of course, the U.S. did not vote for 
 
 that, but it shows this overall mood of a lack of patience, growing frustration with Israel's actions.
 
It's as if the events of October 7th and what happened to 1200 Israelis, hostages still being held have been just about erased in much of the 
 
 world's memory replaced by the pictures of the damage in Gaza, the displaced civilians and now the bombing underway in Lebanon.
 
And that makes it that much harder for the White House to keep various countries on side as part of coalition that accomplish things like peace in 
 
 certain African countries. It's the kind of thing where does this affect the countries that are joining the U.S. and supporting the Ukrainian 
 
 efforts to fight Russian aggression? Probably not.
 <br>[09:45:00]
 
But there are other things that the U.S. is trying to do. At the U.N. this week that are going to be really damaged by the U.S. siding with Israel 
 
 with its ongoing actions.
 
ANDERSON: It's good to have you, Kim, our viewers, getting the perspective of all of our correspondents and commentators there. I've got to take a 
 
 very short break, but we will be right back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: Welcome back. You watching "Connect the World" with me Becky Anderson. Now the man suspected of trying to assassinate Donald Trump 
 
 earlier this month, had written a letter declaring his intentions and laying out his plans, certainly according to a new filing by federal 
 
 prosecutors who say they will now charge Ryan Routh with attempting to assassinate the Former U.S. President. CNN's Randi Kaye has details from 
 
 Monday's hearing.
 
RANDI KAYE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: In court, we learned more about a letter that was provided from a witness who said Ryan Routh dropped a box at his 
 
 home a while ago, and that box was passed on to federal investigators. In it was a handwritten letter, according to investigators that they believe 
 
 Ryan Routh wrote.
 
And that letter says, in part, this was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump, but I failed you. I tried my best and gave it all the gumption I 
 
 could muster. It is up to you now to finish the job, and then he went on to offer $150,000 to whomever could complete the job.
 
We also learned from the agents in court that the defendant, Ryan Routh, they believe, was in a position that provided a clear line of fire to the 
 
 sixth hole putting green. Now, remember, Donald Trump was on the fifth hole putting green at the time this all occurred, that would have put him about 
 
 12 to 15 minutes away from the sixth hole putting green.
 
Also, if he had gotten to the sixth hole putting green, he would have been about 100 feet. Investigators say from who they believe is Ryan Routh in 
 
 that position in the bushes. Also, new information regarding the scope that was attached to the weapon that was discovered at the scene that we're told 
 
 was attached to the weapon by electrical tape.
 
And investigators in court said that they there was a fingerprint that they believe belongs to Ryan Routh on that electrical tape. That is a 
 
 preliminary finding they are still looking into that. We also know there was a letter now addressed to "The New York Times", that was found at the 
 
 scene.
 
They did test that letter for fingerprints and DNA. They have not found Ryan Routh's fingerprints or DNA on it just yet, but they did find a 
 
 fingerprint belonging to someone else. The FBI agent who was testifying did not say who that person is, who that fingerprint belongs to, or what was in 
 
 the letter.
 
Also, they did search Routh's car. They found a Hawaii driver's license and a passport in his name, along with 12 pairs of gloves and six cell phones. 
 
 One of the cell phones, prosecutors say, included a search, a Google search, from how to get from Palm Beach County, where this all happened, to 
 
 Mexico.
 <br>[09:50:00]
 
Also, they found cell phone data that would have placed Ryan Routh in this area for about a month before this incident occurred. They said that he 
 
 arrived here as of August 14th, that's according to cell phone data pinging off the cell phone towers in the area. And finally, there was a handwritten 
 
 list of dates and venues, prosecutors say that was found in his car.
 
Those include dates where Donald Trump was expected to appear before Election Day. They believe that that handwritten list was written by Ryan 
 
 Routh. Randi Kaye, CNN, Palm Beach County, Florida.
 
ANDERSON: Randi Kaye reporting for you. We will be back right after this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: Well, we are waiting for Joe Biden to give his final address as U.S. President to the United Nations annual gathering, otherwise known as 
 
 the General Assembly, gathered in the debate hall. You will recognize that, I'm sure, if you are a regular viewer, this is the Brazilian President 
 
 speaking currently.
 
He will be followed by Joe Biden, he will speak as the conflict in the Middle East, of course, expands with Israel, once again today, striking 
 
 Hezbollah targets in Lebanon and its military now vowing to speed up offensive operations there. Want to bring back CNN Global Affairs Analyst 
 
 Kimberly Dozier, who I've been speaking to throughout the past hour.
 
And we will speak again once Joe Biden has taken to the podium. What do you understand to be the strategy for the Biden team and what is, you know, Joe 
 
 Biden's last very visible speech to the world community?
 
DOZIER: Well, this is an opportunity for the Biden Administration to celebrate what it sees as its successes and to put the best spin on all of 
 
 them, from pulling together more than 100 countries to support the war effort in Ukraine, to drive out the Russian invasion and to the withdrawal 
 
 from Afghanistan that Biden still sees this success.
 
You might have heard Vice President Kamala Harris in her debate with Former President Trump, extolling that there are no U.S. troops at war right now. 
 
 She said it in a way that has been lambasted in military circles. But what she meant is the U.S. isn't in a declared war right now.
 
And also, they'll be talking to some extent about the shuttle diplomacy that they are taking part in right now to try to keep total war from 
 
 breaking out in the Middle East, and talking about the success they did have in working together with Egypt and Qatar to broker that first 
 
 ceasefire, which allowed many hostages to go home.
 
ANDERSON: Ultimately, however, this is spun. Our viewers around the world will be watching this and thinking, what has really been achieved?
 <br>[09:55:00]
 
Was this a successful administration for a man who ultimately, many see as one of America's most experienced foreign policy hands? His experience 
 
 extends some 50 years as a U.S. Congressman through his time spent on the Foreign Relations Committee. That will be no surprise. 
 
DOZIER: Yeah.
 
ANDERSON: I'm sure that, that is how people will be feeling as they get ready to watch this.
 
DOZIER: Yeah, I think you're right. According to a lot of the diplomats I speak to, the best they would give the Biden Administration is b minus, 
 
 maybe a C-plus. It's been reliability without what many described to me as the chaos of the Trump Administration. But it's also been coupled with risk 
 
 aversion.
 
Risk aversion in terms of there were many European allies who had gone into Afghanistan together with the United States after the attacks of 9/11 who 
 
 wanted to see the Biden Administration renegotiate the Trump Administration's deal with the Taliban.
 
ANDERSON: Right.
 
DOZIER: And leave at least a skeleton crew of U.S. and Western troops on the ground to keep that country stable, instead of the Taliban rule that we 
 
 see there now, and I can go through a long list of other areas where Ukraine.
 
ANDERSON: Right.
 
DOZIER: Where they've been very frustrated at the Biden Administration's limitations on weapons that they've donated to keep.
 
ANDERSON: Yeah, this isn't the last time you and I will speak over the next hour or so. I'm going to let you go for the time being so that we can take 
 
 a very short break. We will be back after the break with another hour of "Connect the World" and Joe Biden's speech at the United Nations.
