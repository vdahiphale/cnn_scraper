BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN ANCHOR: Good morning. Buenos dias and welcome to CNN THIS MORNING. I'm Boris Sanchez. 
 
AMARA WALKER, CNN ANCHOR: Good morning to you, Boris. I'm Amara Walker.
 
After months of investigation, the January 6th committee is preparing to present its findings. What we expect from tomorrow's final public hearing. Plus, new details on Georgia's investigation into Donald Trump.
 
SANCHEZ: And as the snow moves out a bitter blast of cold air is moving in. More than 260 million Americans will see temperatures fall below freezing this week. We're going to tell you where we could see wind chills as low as 30 to 45 degrees below zero.
 
WALKER: And the stage is set. Argentina and France will square off in the World Cup finals later this morning. We are live from Doha with a look at the big match.
 
SANCHEZ: And targeting TikTok. The security concerns that more than a dozen states banning the app on government-owned devices.
 
Here we are, the start of a new week, Sunday, December 18th. Thank you so much for waking up with us. Good morning, Amara.
 
WALKER: Good morning. Great to be with you, Boris.
 
We have a lot of news to get to this morning. And the House Select Committee investigating the Capitol riot will use its final public hearing by making criminal referrals to the Justice Department. Over nearly a dozen hearings, the panel has focused on proving then president Donald Trump led efforts to overturn his loss of the 2020 election, going so far as to incite this deadly riot.
 
SANCHEZ: The committee of seven Democrats and two Republicans has interviewed hundreds of witnesses. They have gathered thousands of documents over the course of their investigation. And now, they are expected to refer at least three criminal charges against former President Donald Trump. But ultimately it's going to be up to prosecutors at the Department of Justice to determine whether or not to pursue those criminal charges.
 
Let's bring in CNN's Zach Cohen. He join s us now live. Zach, walk us through these potential criminal referrals.
 
ZACHARY COHEN, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTER: Yes, good morning, Amara and Boris. Look, these criminal referrals are going to be a big part of tomorrow's final presentation. The committee has been investigating, you know, the U.S. Capitol riot for over 17 months now. It's going to use its last public appearance where all the members are gathered together to really make the case that Donald Trump committed a crime. They are going to ask the Justice Department to pursue prosecution on at least three different criminal charges, including insurrection.
 
Now, what that ultimately will mean remains to be seen. We know the Justice Department is already looking into Trump as part of its expansive criminal investigation related to January 6th but members have really told us of the last several weeks that they felt it was really important that they get their views documented for the historical record. And they made clear that they think the former president committed a crime.
 
Now, we also know beyond former President Donald Trump that the committee is going to make referrals on at least a few others people that they qualify as central players in the effort to overturn the 2020 election. Now, it remains to be seen how they're going to handle, you know, issues like the five Republican lawmakers who defied their subpoenas.
 
But here's a few options, you know, they have on the table in addition to criminal referrals. They can make complaints to the House Ethics Committee. They can put their discipline referrals to the bar associations and campaign -- and recommend campaign finance violations to the FEC. So, we're going to see a variety of different categories of referrals tomorrow. But really the criminal referral for Donald Trump is going to be the highlight.
 
WALKER: All right. Zachary Cohen, appreciate you joining us this morning. Thank you for that.
 
Joining me now to discuss this more is Daniel Strauss. He is a senior political correspondent for "The New Republic."
 
Good to see you. Good morning, Daniel. So first off, how much pressure would the DOJ be under to act on these criminal referrals? As we know it's more symbolic. There's really no obligation.
 
DANIEL STRAUSS, SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW REPUBLIC: I mean, look, the DOJ has been under immense pressure already for the 17 months since this investigation from Congress has begun. And we have seen not so much that they cave to pressure but they think that there is something there and this is worth some kind of strong consideration.
 
Let's take a look at Merrick Garland first. He is a former judge himself. He moves with extreme caution and deliberation. And this case itself is high profile but the DOJ has already started its own investigation and they have been doing so in a very, very cautious manner throughout the Biden presidency, starting not only with just the investigation itself but like who in the main justice would be involved in this.
 <br>[06:05:07]
 
They have worked to make sure that no member of their investigative team on this has anything close to the usual sort of political background, like working on a super PAC for political candidates. These are all deliberative moves to make sure that if they move forward with some kind of investigation or some kind of prosecutorial action of Donald Trump or his former lieutenants, Trump himself cannot really credibly claim that this is simply a political witch hunt. And I think that's what we're going to see here.
 
The DOJ has begun its own investigation, as Zach said, and the fact that they're doing that means that they are taking this very seriously. So, I think once these criminal referrals are officially made, we're going to see possible movement from inside main justice on what they will do next going forward.
 
WALKER: What else do we expect tomorrow and do you expect to hear any other criminal referrals aimed at anyone else besides Trump?
 
STRAUSS: It was a good question. Part of it is just that the January 6th committee has had its own flair for the surprise or the newsy. They have always wanted to make sure that every hearing has some sort of major news announcement, partially because they know that this is -- this is something that is being prosecuted in public. This is not only just sort of something that's going to be fought in courts but it is in the public eye. The importance of people understanding what happened and the seriousness of it.
 
I do expect, though, recommendations from people close to Trump, people -- Trump's advisers, Trump's lawyers who were involved in discussing what to do on January 6th, pushing the Stop the Steal rally and anything else involving the events of that day.
 
WALKER: And the other investigation, Daniel, in Georgia looking into Trump and his allies and their efforts to overturn the 2020 election results, that is winding down its work as we are learning, and a final report is actually being written now as we speak. What will you be watching for in that next phase?
 
STRAUSS: I mean, it's actually -- it's strange how similar and parallel the timing of these two investigations are. Like, the January 6th committee, this Georgia investigation will go to the Fulton County district attorney and in a sense it's more serious.
 
I've talked to legal experts throughout the last year who have said that you need to pay attention to the state investigations to Trump more than the January 6th committee just because those are more serious in the end. Those have more specific consequences at hand. And it's something that Trump himself for months has been very alarmed by and is aware that in the end if there is some sort of indictment against him it may happen in New York or Georgia not so much -- or not necessarily at the federal level.
 
WALKER: Yes. I'm sure it's tough for even Trump himself to keep up with all these legal troubles that he's facing right now. Look, in the meantime, you have this contentious fight over who's going to lead the Republicans in the House. That is still at an impasse.
 
Kevin McCarthy is warning that the few detractors, what are we at, five in his party, the right wing conservatives, that they are going to derail the Republicans very hard fought and narrow majority. How do you see this playing out?
 
STRAUSS: I suspect that this is actually going to be pretty similar to the aftermath of former House Speaker John Boehner leaving where, again, McCarthy was up to be speaker but could not get the votes which eventually resulted in Paul Ryan becoming the leader of the House Republicans Caucus.
 
It's pretty surprising if you think six months back that the majority that Republicans had is so slim. I mean, it's just a few seats and this is from a party that expected a red wave or red tsunami was a phrase I would hear throughout this last campaign cycle. But in the end, McCarthy finds himself in a pretty uncomfortably familiar position.
 
He has really no margin for error. These five Republicans are not moving. And despite clear accolades he's making to some of the most conservatives, some of the most hard right members of his party, he still does not seem to have those 218 votes.
 
I would not be surprised at sort of an 11th hour sort of alternative coming in and someone serious. There's always some sort of speaker, leader alternative to wage their -- wage a battle in these situations.
 <br>[06:10:01]
 
But it's getting pretty close here and it's clear that if McCarthy does become speaker it will be by the skin of his teeth.
 
WALKER: Yes. And even Trump weighing in on this saying that they need to stop their opposition against McCarthy because he calls it a dangerous game that they are playing. Obviously, we'll see if there are consequences to that.
 
Daniel Strauss, appreciate you joining us this morning. Thank you so much. Happy holidays.
 
STRAUSS: Happy holidays. WALKER: And a reminder, we will have special live coverage of tomorrow's January 6th committee hearing. That begins at noon Eastern right here on CNN.
 
SANCHEZ: New this morning, South Korean officials are calling the launch of two mid-range ballistic missile by North Korea a -- quote -- "serious provocation." Military officials in Seoul say the missiles flew around 500 kilometers before falling into the water between the Korean Peninsula and Japan. A statement from the U.S. military says, its commitment to defending its allies in the region remains, in their words, ironclad.
 
Back in the United States, more than 70,000 people in New Hampshire and Maine are still without power this morning after this weekend's nor'easter dropped than a foot of snow across many part of the New England area.
 
WALKER: Wow. Look at all that white powder and more cold weather is in the forecast for the eastern U.S. in the coming days. We were just talking about this. I was lamenting it. Meteorologist Allison Chinchar in the CNN weather center. Yes, Allison, take it away.
 
ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Oh, I think Boris was lamenting just as much as you were.
 
WALKER: I was channeling my inner Boris.
 
CHINCHAR: Yes, exactly.
 
WALKER: I was crying for him too.
 
CHINCHAR: These are dangerously cold temperatures because when you look at where the wind chill advisories and wind chill watches are some of these areas you're talking about that feels like temperature getting down to minus 45 or even minus 60 degrees. Just let that sink in for a minute, minus 60 is what it will feel like some of these morning as we go through the upcoming week.
 
Now, Tuesday we're already going to start to see the temperatures drop today but Tuesday is really when the bottom drops out. Notice across areas of Montana, North and South Dakota, those feels like temperatures are in that minus 25 to minus 30-degree range. But then they're going to get even worse as more of that cold air begins to intensify and also spread east and south.
 
So, here's a look. Again, Fargo's high temperature. The high temperature on Wednesday in Fargo is minus 13. Again, Chicago's not much better. Your high temperature is in the 20s but even they're going to continue to see things drop.
 
We talked about the south, they're not excluded. Atlanta going from 52 on Thursday down to only 27 on Friday. Washington, D.C., going from 50 on Thursday, Boris, down to a very chilly 28 next Saturday.
 
SANCHEZ: Lamenting is not a strong enough word. WALKER: Can I tell you? You know, I'm going to Florida this week and I saw Christmas Eve, the high is going to be 55 degrees in south Florida. Can you believe that, Boris? I'm so upset. Turning around --
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
CHINCHAR: Yes. Even Florida will be impacted. Yes. We always talk about this is the one time of the year where most people hate Florida because it's the only one warm spot. But even they're going to get pretty chilly temperatures.
 
WALKER: That's going to feel a little bit like Christmas in south Florida. Why not?
 
SANCHEZ: I can manage 55. It's some of those temperatures in the border right now like 10 that -- not so much. Allison Chinchar, thank you so much.
 
WALKER: Good to see you, Allison. Well, we are just hours away from the biggest game in all of sports. Of course, we're talking about the World Cup final.
 
SANCHEZ: Yes. It will be Argentina trying to win one for arguably the greatest player of all time, Lionel Messi, taking on the defending champions from France. Let's take you to Qatar now and CNN's Amanda Davies, who has been following all the latest developments from the World Cup. Amanda, this could be the shining achievement for Messi's career or Kylian Mbappe could win two World Cups and he's not even 24 yet.
 
AMANDA DAVIES, CNN WORLD SPORT: Yes. I mean, there are so many story lines ahead of this one 63 matches down just one to go. Can you imagine the feelings amongst those players now with just four hours to go until kickoff?
 
It's probably too much of a cliche to say but it really is two foot balling heavyweights going head to head for this one. Argentina against France, Lionel Messi against Kylian Mbappe. Two sides both looking for what would be a third World Cup crown or that third star on their shirt.
 
For France, it's a fourth World Cup final in seven additions of this tournament. They got the better of Argentina, the last time these two sides met in Russia in 2018. But there has been so much talk about the fairytale for Lionel Messi. His last chance, in his last dance, and what we know he has said will be his final game at the World Cup in an Argentina shirt. This is the one he has yet to win, the only piece of silverware he has yet to win.
 <br>[06:15:03]
 
Deschamps has said for his side the French team are not going to be dealing with the fairytales or the romantics. They are focusing on the job in hand for themselves. They've had some injuries to contend with in their camp. But the Argentina boss, Lionel Scaloni, who has very much built this squad around Lionel Messi since 2018 has reminded his team they are here to do it for one man.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LIONEL SCALONI, ARGENTINA COACH (through translator): Regarding what Lionel Messi said about this being his last game let's hope that in this one we can win the cup. That would be great. The most important thing is to enjoy it and there's no better scenario for it than a World Cup final.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
DAVIES: A World Cup final and the Argentinean fans are here in their numbers as they have been throughout the tournament. The atmosphere here behind us at Souq Waqif is fantastic. You sense it's going to feel very much like a home game at Lusail Stadium.
 
WALKER: You know, I love Lionel Messi's life story. So, I'm all about Lionel Messi today. And I have to say, Amanda, it has been lovely to see you and your bright colors. Your outfits have been beautiful. So, thank you for gracing us with that, Amanda.
 
DAVIES: Thank you so much. It has been a pleasure.
 
WALKER: All right. Well, the city of El Paso declares a state of emergency in response to a surge of migrants as towns along the border await the end of Title 42. More on that and the White House's plans to manage the surge.
 
SANCHEZ: Plus, lawmakers taking aim at TikTok. Why states across the country and the federal government are now considering banning the app on government-owned devices.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[06:20:56]
 
WALKER: This morning, the surge of migrants arriving at the U.S.- Mexican border is reaching a boiling point. The mayor of El Paso, Texas, has declared a state of emergency as his city reels from a surge of migrants streaming in from Mexico. And he says those numbers could double this week after the Trump era policy, Title 42, is lifted.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MAYOR OSCAR LEESER, EL PASO, TEXAS: We know that the influx on Wednesday will be incredible. It will be huge. Talking to some of our federal partners they really believe that on Wednesday our numbers will go from 2,500 to 4,000 or 5,000 or maybe 6,000. And when I asked them, I said, do you believe that you guys can handle it today? The answer was no.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SANCHEZ: The state of emergency will help bolster resources for arriving migrants as homeless shelters in El Paso are already above capacity. CNN's Ed Lavandera has been reporting from the border for us. He filed this report.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Once again, large groups of migrant who have arrived here in the U.S. are bracing for another frigid night on the streets of downtown El Paso. The people that you see around me mostly have not been able to get into one of the shelters that have been so overwhelmed by this latest surge of migrants in this area. This is all happening days ahead of the expected lifting of Title 42, that pandemic era public health rule that allowed customs and border protection and border officials to expel many migrants arriving at the U.S. southern border because of public health reasons. And many of these people really just trying to get through the night as they await being able to get on a bus or a flight to their final destinations elsewhere in the country.
 
What you are seeing playing out is really people, kind of, desperate for whatever blankets and clothing, whatever they can get to get through these nights. We've seen the generosity of people who -- like this woman here who arrived a short while ago and was giving away blankets. Migrants who've lined up single file to be able to get their hands on a blanket or shoes or sweaters, sweat shirts, anything that can help them through the night.
 
And they're camped out around these bus stations because they are waiting to either board these buses. But many of these tickets are several days out so they had to sit here. And that is really the main concern that local officials here in El Paso have and what they have been working to try to prepare for.
 
And they've realized that at this point they just need to be able to manage this situation as best as possible. And the thing that they want to do, the best at is moving people out of here as quickly as possible because they know that behind them there are thousands more migrants possibly coming in the days ahead.
 
So, they say the biggest challenge they will have is to get these people to bigger transportation hubs like Phoenix, Denver, Dallas and Houston so that they can then move on to their final destinations. And they hope that if they can move people out of El Paso quickly enough that will alleviate the pressure and the burden on a lot of the shelters and the charities that are really helping these people get through these initial days here in the U.S. But they are all bracing for large numbers of people.
 
In the last week, El Paso has seen about 2,000 to 2,500 people per day. Local officials are now estimating that once Title 42 is lifted it could be anywhere from 4,000 to 5,000 people per day here just in the El Paso region alone.
 
Ed Lavandera, CNN, El Paso, Texas.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
SANCHEZ: Excellent reporting from Ed as always. Meantime, White House officials tell the -- tell CNN that the Biden administration has a robust effort underway for managing the border when Title 42 ends on Wednesday.
 
WALKER: Yes. CNN White House reporter Jasmine Wright is with the president in Wilmington, Delaware, this morning. Hi there, Jasmine. So, what is the White House saying about Title 42 and when it expires on Wednesday?
 
JASMINE WRIGHT, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: Well, the president is certainly facing a growing threat at the southern border when Title 42 is expected to be lifted this week. And the White House is bracing for it. Already, Homeland Security officials said that we could likely expect to see an immediate increase in migration over the southern border.
 <br>[06:25:06]
 
Now, to be clear here, Boris and Amara, it is not like the White House never expected Title 42, that Trump era policy put in place during the pandemic, to be lifted. It was if but a when. But, of course, on Friday after that last-ditch effort by some Republican led states to keep the policy in place was blocked by a federal appeals court now it feels all the more real. So, you're right, the White House says that they -- is a robust effort underway to prepare for when Title 42 is lifted.
 
Now, I want to read you a quote from White House spokesperson Abdullah Hasan who in responding to that Friday appeals court blocking he said, "To be clear, the lifting to Title 42 public health order does not mean the border is open. Anyone who suggests otherwise is doing the work --
 
SANCHEZ: It looks like we had some technical difficulties there with Jasmine Wright. We will check back in with her as news progresses as she's with the president in Wilmington, Delaware.
 
Up next, though, more than a dozen states have now blocked TikTok from being used on government devices saying that it poses a national security risk. But, ultimately, does blocking one app really make a difference? We have a former director of U.S. cyber security at the Department of Homeland Security with us next to discuss.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
WALKER,: A famous mountain lion in California who had his own social media following has been euthanized. The animal known as P-22. has been recorded prowling in the Hollywood Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles since 2012.
 
SANCHEZ: Yes, he's gotten a bit more aggressive lately and California authorities said he likely had recently been hit by a car too. CNN's Camila Bernal takes a closer look at what happened.
 
CAMILA BERNAL, CNN NATIONAL REPORTER (on camera): This was a mountain lion that had been tracked for about 10 years. And he was essentially a celebrity, a beloved mountain lion here in Los Angeles, with a Facebook page and Instagram page. But unfortunately, about a month ago, the experts that track him started noticing changes in his behavior. They say he was getting closer and attacking dogs, even dogs on leashes that were close to people. They also say he was getting a lot closer to urban areas and deeper into these urban areas. 
 
They believed that he was in distress, which is why they decided to capture him. Once they captured him, he went through a medical evaluation. They already thought that he'd been hit by a car, but the medical evaluation revealed that he had trauma to his eye, to his head and some internal organs. They also discovered pre-existing illnesses, including kidney disease, some infection in his skin, weight loss. And so, when they took all of that into consideration, they essentially decided that putting him down was the best scenario for P-22. 
 
This week after he was captured, some of the experts that have been tracking him for years spoke out saying that his legacy, his data will live on. Here's one of those experts.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SETH RILEY, CHIEF, CDFW WILDLIFE BRANCH: He's been an incredibly interesting animal. It's we've really gotten a lot of really great information from him. He's persisted in the smallest tone range that has ever been recorded for an adult male mountain lion. And just been -- like I said, a really interesting animal. And the truth is he'll be a part of our studies -- forever be a part of -- an important part of our mountain lion studies. I'm sure we'll be looking at his data for years to come.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BERNAL: And they also say that his data was extremely helpful in the building of the world's largest overpass for wildlife. It is currently being built here in Los Angeles. And it is essentially a bridge that will be over 10 lanes of highway 101 here. So, bottom line, it's not just about a celebrity mountain lion, it is about conservation efforts for these animals. Camila Bernal, CNN, Los Angeles.
 
SANCHEZ: Camila, thank you for that report. Stay with CNN THIS MORNING. We're back in just moments.

 <br>[06:35:00]
 
SANCHEZ: TikTok time may be running out in the United States, at least on government devices. A growing number of governors and lawmakers in Washington are taking action against the popular Chinese-owned app saying that it poses a national security risk. Virginia is the latest state to ban TikTok from government devices, joining more than a dozen others who've taken similar actions. In Congress this week, the Senate passed a bill that would ban the app on devices owned by federal agencies as well 
 
With us to share his insights, the former director of U.S. cybersecurity at the Department of Homeland Security Amit Yoran. Amit, great to have you this morning. Thanks so much for sharing part of your Sunday with us. Right off the bat, I just want to get your reaction to these TikTok bans. Are they the right move?
 
AMIT YORAN, FORMER DIRECTOR OF U.S. CYBERSECURITY, DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY: Listen, only the government officials that are making these decisions know if they're the right moves because they have insight and they're getting reports and they have intelligence about what's coming in. But for sure, when you're running applications on your compute devices, your cell phones or tablets or computers, it does pose some risk.
 
SANCHEZ: So, specifically with TikTok, why is it such an issue that it has to be banned from government devices?
 
YORAN: Well, TikTok has very close ties to the Chinese government. But anytime you're running an application on your device, whether it's social media, or other forms of applications, they can collect massive amounts of data about their users. And we know that government users have been targeted. If you look at the White House, there was a very high-profile breach of the Office of Personnel Management just a few years ago. Government users are targeted because of the access to critical systems and critical information that they have. 
 
SANCHEZ: So, for a lot of younger Americans, TikTok is a part of daily life. At this point, you think the app is too big to ban across the United States. 
 
YORAN: Listen, I have three teenagers, and I can tell you there's absolutely zero chance of TikTok and other social media being app -- being banned in my household. But I do think that these apps -- not only TikTok but apps like TikTok which collect tremendous amounts of information can be very, very invasive to privacy. And the information that you put and that our teenagers are putting out on the internet is out there forever. And it's something that we need to be very aware of, we need to educate and teach our children about.
 <br>[06:40:31]
 
SANCHEZ: So, you're not concerned with your teenagers having it on their phones and what that could mean for their privacy being exposed to ByteDance and potentially the Chinese?
 
YORAN: Well, for sure, I'm concerned about it. There's a higher probability that dad gets banned before TikTok. But in all seriousness -- in all seriousness, listen, technology and social media do play an incredibly important role in our children's lives and it's something that we need to be aware of. And hopefully, like any organization or individual, help them make better risk management decisions. Help them understand what information is being collected about them. Help them understand what vulnerabilities could be introduced, what these applications and what this software can do to their phone and on their behalf, without them knowing about it. 
 
So, this is a game of education for our children, for our youth. It's also a case where many adults don't understand the implications of installing a piece of software, and also something that needs to happen at the organizational level with our businesses and our government.
 
SANCHEZ: Do you think banning TikTok ultimately makes a difference if there are other apps linked to Chinese firms, and ultimately, the Chinese government that are similar that aren't being banned?
 
YORAN: I do think that these actions can make a difference. And they can make a difference in a number of ways. One is any specific application, you can prevent data leakage, you can prevent information from being collected, you can prevent a specific user from being targeted or even large swaths of the population being manipulated or influenced in some form or fashion. But it doesn't begin and end with one app. 
 
I think the government taking action, whether it's against TikTok or any other company or organization sends a very strong signal to foreign actors, to foreign governments, about influence about data collection which may happen here in the U.S. against government employees or against other members of our population. And in that signaling, you start establishing a normal behavior or an interaction with that government that says this is not OK.
 
SANCHEZ: I mean, you're and we have to leave the conversation there. I certainly hope dad doesn't get banned.
 
YORAN: Boris, great speaking with you. 
 
SANCHEZ: Thanks so much.
 
WALKER: All right, new Twitter owner Elon Musk now offering journalists he suspended without warning this week the chance to return to the platform if they delete tweets he falsely claims shared his real-time location. He says they violated Twitter policy by sharing information about an online account that tracks his private jet. But that information was publicly available. The accounts were only viewable on Saturday after respondents to a poll voted in favor of restoring them. Two of the journalist tell CNN they won't remove their tweets, but they will appeal the decision. 
 
Up next, a new trend we're seeing in the workforce. Men stepping back, women stepping up. Details next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[06:45:00]
 
WALKER: I guess this is for you because you're male, Boris. The labor force has a problem, a lack of men. Did you know that?
 
SANCHEZ: Yes, men -- yes, men aged 35 to 44 have been slow to return to work after the pandemic, apparently, for a number of reasons, including childcare. Vanessa Yurkevich examines the shifting labor market and how women are now stepping into new roles.
 
DAVID SCHNITZLER, AT-HOME DAD: Good morning, Winston. Let's take the day. VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS AND POLITICS CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): It's a typical day in the Schnitzler household. 17-month- old Winston is up and parents David and Alison are getting ready for work. Winston is fed. There's some play, and then the morning goodbyes. 
 
ALISON SCHNITZLER, WORKING MOM: Bye-bye.
 
D. SCHNITZLER: Bye bye. 
 
YURKEVICH: They're off to work. 
 
A. SCHNITZLER: Bye-bye. Have a good day. 
 
YURKEVICH Alison, a family physician and David and insurance underwriter. Now, an at home dad. 
 
D. SCHNITZLER: Caring for Winston, tending to the house, playing with him, all of that comes first. 
 
YURKEVICH: Last year, the Schnitzler made a significant life change.
 
D. SCHNITZLER: We made that decision to have me stay home.
 
YURKEVICH: David quit his job to take care of Winston full-time so Alison could continue her career. 
 
D. SCHNITZLER: We're happy with the roles that were in. It's phenomenal. 
 
YURKEVICH: And in recent months, more men ages 30 to 44 have been dropping out of the workforce according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The labor force participation rate for men in that age group is lower than it was pre-pandemic.
 
RICHARD V. REEVES, SENIOR FELLOW, BROOKINGS INSTITUTIONS: I don't think it's a secret that many of us rethought our whole work-life balance, what were we doing, who's raising the kids, how do we want our family to work? That's a question that a lot of families have been asking themselves.
 
YURKEVICH: And more women in recent months ages 30 to 44 are participating in the labor force and at a higher rate than pre- pandemic according to Labor Department data, and they're moving into more male-dominated industries. 
 
REEVES: The fears of a she session turned out largely to be unfounded. Women are returned to the labor market. It's becoming increasingly common to see women, for example, having project management roles, or generally management positions within construction. 
 <br>[06:50:07]
 
YURKEVICH: Women like Ava Sedaghat.
 
AVA SEDAGHAT, PROJECT ENGINEER: I knew I wanted to work in construction management. 
 
YURKEVICH: Sedaghat joined the construction industry two years ago as a project engineer. Today, women make up just 14 percent of the construction industry, but it's the highest on record.
 
SEDAGHAT: I think it was definitely intimidating. My only knowledge of the construction industry was that it was pretty heavy and male dominated. But the more that I started working in the industry, and the more people I came into contact with, I think I realized pretty quickly on that there's a place for everyone in construction.
 
YURKEVICH: Do you see the construction industry as where you want to build your career?
 
SEDAGHAT: Definitely.
 
YURKEVICH: Early next year, the Schnitzlers will welcome baby number two, another boy. But that doesn't mean David is closing the door on rejoining the workforce one day.
 
D. SCHNITZLER: I won't say that I'm out of the workforce 100 percent, you know, retired or what have you. But for the time being, we want to give our second infant son the same thing that we gave to our first, and that is a parent who is able to give them 100 percent.

LISA LING, CNN HOST: Would you go as far as to say that the highest believe that inner racial marriage is a key to world harmony?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, yes. The hope is that this love, this unity is not only between the married couple, but now between their families. It just kind of has a ripple effect. If people can change their mindset and think of humanity as flowers of one garden, then we'll get to world peace.
 
LING: For so long, we've been segregated, and only kind of recently has started to be acceptable to really be with wherever you want. And I think we're seeing some really, really beautiful fruits of that.

SANCHEZ: In sports this morning, the Minnesota Vikings pulled off the biggest comeback in the history of the NFL last night.
 
WALKER: Yes, that was incredible. Coy Wire has this morning's "BLEACHER REPORT." Hi, Coy!
 
COY WIRE, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Good morning, Amara and Boris. The Vikings are playing at home, down 33 to zip at halftime. You probably wouldn't blame fans who decided to leave early, but they might be in a big bowl of regrets for breakfast this morning. Minnesota had just a one percent chance of winning, but don't ever count out Kirk Cousins. You like that.
 
The three-time pro-bowler leading the Vikings with four second-half touchdown passes, including this screen pass that went for 64 yards with just over two minutes to go. This one was all Dalvin Cook though. Somehow, some way, Minnesota tie the game at 36, forcing overtime after converting a two-point conversion as well. 
 
And in overtime, kicker Greg Joseph has a shot at the game-winner. Minnesota down 33-zip to Matt Ryan and the Colts and they go ahead and pull up the biggest comeback in NFL history. The previous record, Buffalo Bills 32 points in 1992 with Frank Reich at quarterback feeding the Oilers. Reich was fired earlier this season by the Colts. 
 
Vikings went 39-36 clinching their first NFC North title since 2017. Afterwards, Cousins had no idea what they had just done.

KIRK COUSINS, QUARTERBACK, MINNESOTA VIKINGS: We just pulled off the biggest comeback in NFL history. OK, I need a second time. How do we do it? You know, it was -- it was an ugly first half but found a way. There was belief. Patrick Peterson said all we need is five touchdowns. I thought he was being sarcastic.

WIRE: The Miami Dolphins having to travel to Buffalo. And baby, it's cold outside. Fans making snow fans for their high-powered Bills. And at one point, officials had to stop the game to tell fans to stop throwing snowballs. Oh, come on. Let the people have some fun. Oh, my goodness. Fans cooled down. The Bills Quarterback Josh Allen heats up. Down eight with nine minutes to go, he throws his fourth touchdown of the game, hitting Dawson Knox. 
 
Allen who also led the team with 77 yards rushing, then goes Superman over the line for the two-point conversion to tie the game at 29. And the bills would get the ball back. The linemen clear away snow for kicker Tyler Bass. Two seconds left, and from 25 yards out, it's lights out, Dolphins. The game-winning field goal as time expires. Sledding time, snow angels, and everything in the 32-29 win. They earn their fourth straight playoff burst. Let's go, Buffalo. Finally, Tiger Woods and 13-year-old son Charlie letting a couple of
 
 injuries are not going to keep them from playing again in the PNC championship in Orlando. And it's not going to keep them from being in sync. Look it up. It's so sweet. Charlie sank a plot on the seventh year for birdie. And he's limping around because he has a rolled ankle. Tiger is still limping around from injuries from his car accident. They call themselves Team Ice Bath. They're in second late, just to stroke behind the leaders Justin Thomas and his dad and Mike who's a club pro. 
 
Tiger and Charlie looking to win the tournament for the first time. Tiger says I'm not worried about these injuries. They can heal up later. I'm more concerned about making these moments with my son.
 
WALKER: It's uncanny their mannerisms too are like exactly the same.
 
WIRE: Yes, they did. 
 
WALKER: The way -- the way he pumped his fist, right? That's Tiger.
 
SANCHEZ: He's got the form down, yes. 
 
Coy Wire, thank you so much. The next hour of CNN THIS MORNING starts right now.
