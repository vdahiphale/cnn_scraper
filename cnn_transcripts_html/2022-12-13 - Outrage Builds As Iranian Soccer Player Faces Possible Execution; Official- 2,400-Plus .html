SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: But, Ana, rights groups, activists say these are trumped up charges. He is facing a sham trial And they are concerned he could be executed in a matter of days. 
 
We've already seen two protesters who were executed, death by hanging, just in the last few days, So people are ringing the alarm here.
 
And I have a statement for you from the global soccer union that just expresses that concern. 
 
"Fifth Pro is shocked and sickened by reports that professional footballer, Amir Nasr-Azadani, faces execution in Iran after campaigning for women's rights and basic freedoms in his country. We stand in solidarity with Amir and call for the immediate removal of his punishment."  
 
Activists, rights groups, Ana, say this is the Iran government's latest tool of repression, the threat of execution. And the fear is that he's not the only one. There are many more victims potentially coming -- Ana 
 
ANA CABRERA, CNN HOST: Salma, just double-checking, and forgive me if I missed it, was he among the team members who played in the World Cup who were silenced the first game when the national anthem played? 
 
ABDELAZIZ: He is not among them. But I think that's a critical part of the story,
 
Because a lot of protesters are talking, of course, about the national team and how they were treated at the World Cup and those later reports we heard from activists about their families and their lives being threatened. 
 
Many on social media were discussing as to how many of those players were able to speak out about another fellow soccer player, now that they've been silenced, activists say, by the government. 
 
So, no, it wasn't a part of that. It's a part of the continuation of this crackdown that really reaches all parts of society. Again, a young man in his prime, a footballer who is loved by his
 
 nation, now a target of the regime's repression activists say. 
 
CABRERA: So concerning.
 
Salma Abdelaziz, thank you for that reporting. 
 
The brother of a beloved soccer journalist who died at the World Cup, says he no longer suspects foul play. Grant Wahl died Friday while covering the Netherlands-Argentina game in Qatar.
 
It sparked some unfounded speculation that it was connected to his reporting on Qatar's human rights abuses. 
 
Those looking at this suspiciously included his brother, Eric Wahl. But now, Eric apologized for that on Twitter, adding the family will release a statement on the cause of death very soon. 
 
Grant Wahl's manager confirmed to CNN that his body was returned to the U.S. on Monday and an autopsy should be completed soon. 
 
The State Department has also said it, quote, "Has seen no indication of foul play or anything nefarious regarding Wahl's death." 
 
At the U.S. southern border, officials in El Paso, Texas, are sounding the alarm after a, quote, "major surge" in illegal crossings this past weekend. 
 
Border officials report more than 2,400 migrants crossed into the day each day, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and shelters are beyond bursting at the seams.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Last night, we had 162 men in a facility that can comfortably handle between 100 to 120. The reality is there's too many people. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CABRERA: CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is on this. 
 
Priscilla, you've been talking to a lot of officials and your sources at the border. Why is this happening right now? 
 
PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, in about a week, there's the expected end of a public health authority known as Title 42. That has allowed authorities to expel migrants back to Mexico since March of 2020.
 
And with its anticipated end, they have seen many migrants come up to the northern border. Some of them, who were already there, and start to trickle into the United States and turn themselves in, Ana. 
 
They are often seeking asylum, which is why you see images of them lining up along the U.S./Mexico border wall. These are scenes that the administration has been concerned about. 
 
I have been talking to officials for weeks who are trying to prepare and shore up resources along the U.S. southern border to basically try to process as many people as they can, especially after Title 42, under immigration law. 
 
Now, the administration is also asking Congress for more than $3 billion in funding. Now, a source tells me that's part of broader funding discussions. And it's not specifically tied to the end of Title 42. 
 
But it really comes at a critical time as the administration tries to prepare for migrants arriving and crossing the U.S./Mexico border. 
 
Again, with El Paso, some key numbers to show you how strained resources are. 
 
Last October to this October, there has been a 280 percent increase in crossings. That's just one section of the border that right now is seeing hundreds of people on a daily basis.
 
That really speaks to the challenge across the border, which is people crossing at a higher clip and creating a strain for the officials who are there. 
 
CABRERA: My understanding is the DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is visiting the border today. And we hope to have a chance to get a report out from him here on the show. 
 <br>[13:35:05]
 
Thank you so much, Priscilla Alvarez. 
 
A former top Twitter official is forced to flee his home because of escalating threats. It's the latest twist after the so-called Twitter files were released. We're following the latest turmoil there.
 
And tf you're one of the millions of Taylor Swift fans who didn't snag a ticket for her next concert, well, Ticketmaster says you might get a second chance. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[13:40:16]
 
CABRERA: More chaos and uncertainty unfolding at Twitter today. Last night, it abruptly dissolved its Trust and Safety Council. That panel created to make Twitter safer and more civil, Addressing issues like harassment and child exploitation. 
 
This is just one more controversial move by Elon Musk. He has been systemically undoing many of the policies and practices put in place before he took over. 
 
CNN's senior media reporter, Oliver Darcy, has been all over this. Do we know why Musk decided to dissolve this council, this panel? 
 
OLIVER DARCY, CNN SENIOR MEDIA REPORTER: He says, Twitter says it's re-evaluating how it takes input from outside group. 
 
This panel is made up of outside experts giving Twitter some insight, some advice on how they should approach hate speech and other things on the platform. 
 
And Twitter now says it's re-evaluating how to take that advice and how to get it and implement it into its policies.
 
But it comes after three people, who were on this Trust and Safety Council, abruptly resigned a few days ago.
 
Basically saying that they don't think Twitter is serious in tackling hate speech on the platform and they've seen a lot of concerning things and that Twitter isn't addressing it properly. 
 
So it's really an interesting timing on this announcement -- Ana? 
 
CABRERA: I also hear Musk is bringing back the "pay for blue check mark" thing he tried to launch previously. But then there were all these impersonators showing up. This was a bad plan. 
 
But he's bringing it back. Has he fixed that other issue? 
 
DARCY: Well, this has been rolled out and they paused it and it's been planned and delayed for some time. So now it's finally back. Theoretically, you can pay for one of those coveted blue check marks. 
 
And he has said, this time around, there will be manual verification for identities. So in theory, it should fix that impersonation issue. We'll see how good that verification is and also how long it takes to be verified now. 
 
This is the big issue. If everyone wants a blue check and they have to manually verify everyone's identity, that seems like it's going to take a lot of manpower and a lot of hours.
 
And we'll be wondering and we'll see if people are able to get those in a timely manner. 
 
CABRERA: When you talk about manpower, I think about all the people who left the company in the last few weeks, including a top Twitter official who we're learning now has been receiving threats. 
 
It's been so bad he's been forced to leave his own home, is what I understand after the Twitter files, these so-called Twitter files have been released. 
 
What more can you tell us about this disturbing development? 
 
DARCY: Sources are telling our colleague, Donie O'Sullivan, that that Yoel Roth, who used to head the Trust and Safety at Twitter, has been forced to flee after really a campaign of criticism against him from Elon Musk. 
 
Elon Musk has really been fanning these flames on Twitter. And I think it really shows that the rhetoric, what happens on Twitter, does end up having some real-world consequences.
 
So he, I guess, apparently, no longer feels comfortable in his own home because of these incoming threats, and at least for this time has fled his home. 
 
CABRERA: Wow. 
 
Thank you very much, Oliver. 
 
Taylor Swift fans, listen up. A lucky few are getting a second chance to snag tickets. This follows that Ticketmaster debacle that left millions of Swifties with bad blood last month. 
 
Swift is now releasing more tickets to her tour. Fans who originally signed up for Ticketmaster's verified pre-sale will get first dibs.
 
It was those verified fans who were ultimately locked out after the Web site crashed last month. So if you're in the select group, look for a purchase invite via email.
 
And also happy birthday to Taylor Swift who turns 33 today. Imagine, 33 and all that she has done in those years. She's such an underachiever, right? Yes.
 <br>[13:44:02]
 
OK, minutes from now, history at the White House and a celebration to match the moment. President Biden set to sign the same-sex marriage bill into law. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CABRERA: Happening right now, embattled Los Angeles councilmember, Kevin De Leon, is back at city hall as the L.A. council meets and there are a number of scandals swirling around him. 
 
On Friday, we showed you this dramatic video. This was from Friday. It shows De Leon in a physical fight with a community activist at a holiday celebration. 
 
De Leon has encountered fierce backlash and repeated calls to resign, before that even, since the audio recording of a racist conversation with other councilmembers leaked back in October.
 
Today, he told CNN he has no plans to step down. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KEVN DE LEON, (D), LOS ANGELES CITY COUNCILMEMBER: In a democracy, the voters make the decision, not folks who are in the peanut gallery or political pundits, or even my own colleagues. You know, tens of millions of Americans go to work every single day
 
 with folks that they don't like. But you know what they do every morning? They get up and go to work. They don't have the luxury of perhaps some folks when they want to walk out. 
 
I'm here to do the business of the constituents. And that's what I've worked for tirelessly. And that's what I will continue to do. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CABRERA: Today's meeting is scheduled to include an election for city council president and ratification of a state of emergency on homelessness.
 
The new mayor, Karen Bass, declared the emergency as her first official act just yesterday. 
 <br>[13:49:58]
 
French prosecutors are now investigating the mysterious disappearance of an American college student. Kenny Deland Jr. is studying abroad in eastern France just outside of Lyon. His family and friends say they haven't heard from him in more than two weeks. 
 
This is Deland on a security camera. This is December 3rd. It's thought to be the last-known footage from him. 
 
He's from New York state. His parents tell CNN the last time they spoke with their son nothing seemed out of the ordinary. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KENNETH DELAND, SON DISAPPEARED WHILE STUDYING IN FRANCE: I would say it's our normal back-and-forth. He's asking how we're doing. I ask how he's doing, how he's, you know, enjoying his studies and if he had traveled to any, you know, spots because he had enjoyed the trip and taken pictures. 
 
We were in constant contact. If it wasn't every day, it was every other day. So this isn't typical for him. It doesn't feel characteristic of Kenny. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CABRERA: His parents say it's been difficult getting information from authorities. A French privacy act has prevented the release of certain information. 
 
Now this is pretty cool. Researchers are just now learning a volcanic eruption that happened about a year ago was so intense, it actually sent water into space.
 
We're talking about the Hunga Tonga eruption. It's an undersea volcano in the Pacific. When it erupted last January, water vapor shot 93 miles above the earth. Scientists say, beyond several tsunamis, it created a sonic boom.
 
 Hunga Tonga is also a pretty epic name, don't you think, for this epic corruption. 
 
To South Korea now where a mega star is now in boot camp. K-pop super group, BTS, and millions of fans this morning saying, see you soon to the oldest member, Jin, as he begins an 18-month military service. 
 
It is mandatory there in South Korea, with all able-bodied men required to serve by the time they are 28 years old. 
 
BTS, which has been hailed as the world's biggest boy band, says they plan to reconvene as a group in 2025, after they all complete their service. 
 
Back in the U.S., we're just moments away from history being made at the White House. President Biden will sign a landmark piece of bipartisan legislation that protects same-sex marriage should the Supreme Court ever reverse its 2015 ruling on the issue. 
 
And it is fitting. A decade ago, as vice president, Biden came out in support of marriage equality. It was controversial at that time. He did it even before his boss at the time, President Obama. 
 
Here was that key moment during an NBC interview back in 2012.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED CORRESPONDENT: Are you comfortable with same-sex marriage now? 
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I -- look, I am vice president of the United States of America. The president sets the policy. 
 
I am absolutely comfortable with the fact that men marrying men, women marrying women and heterosexual marriage, men and women, all are entitled to the same exact rights, all the civil rights, all the civil liberties. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CABRERA: Let's go to the White House and CNN chief White House correspondent, Phil Mattingly, who will be at today's event. 
 
Phil, that comment we just played got Biden initially into hot water, but now it's coming full circle. 
 
PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, the Obama campaign for 2012 really didn't appreciate that at all. The former president, however, taking a little bit of a lesser aggressive tone towards his former vice president.
 
Biden recalling, in a memoir, that President Obama made clear at the time that he understood that, while the then-vice president got had gotten over his skis a little bit, that's exactly who he brought on to his team to be number. 
 
But the seismic nature of that moment, I think it was really easy to forget this far from then. And over the courts of the last decade, the wave, the transformative shift on this particular issue has, in large part, put in a very different context than it was at that time. 
 
If you want to know how important those words were from the vice president, coming from such a senior member of the U.S. government, also a very devout Catholic, as he's always been clear about, they will be commemorated on a card that will hand to the thousands of guests on the South Lawn here in a couple of hours, those very comments from "Meet the Press." 
 
I think it underscores what the president seeing as an important and critical part of his legacy, one he's continued to try to expand since he's been in the White House.
 
Whether it's in personnel policy, cabinet officials, members of his senior team, in terms of executive actions on this issue. And now, in particular, the ability to sign something that was done on a bipartisan basis. 
 
Again, underscoring the way the political winds have shifted on this issue. A bipartisan basis where Republicans, like Senator Susan Collins, were absolutely critical to getting this over the finish line. 
 
It will be a celebration moment on the South Lawn. Thousands of people expected to attend. A couple surprise musical guests as well. 
 <br>[13:55:54]
 
But one the Whie House officials have made is a critical moment, where courts have gone on the issues, given the concerns. 
 
More than anything else, just an opportunity to hammer home what the president had been saying 10 years ago has now become a reality. 
 
CABRERA: And it doesn't just protect same-sex marriage but this same piece of legislation also codifies into protection for interracial marriage. So it is historic on so many levels.
 
Phil Mattingly, thank you for laying it out for us. 
 
And that is going to do it for us today. Thank you for being here. I'll see you back here tomorrow, same time, same place. 
 
The news continues right after this with Victor and Bianna. Stay right there.
