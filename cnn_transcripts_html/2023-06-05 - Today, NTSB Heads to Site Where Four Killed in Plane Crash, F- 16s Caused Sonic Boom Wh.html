(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NIKKI HALEY, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I don't play for second. I'm in this to win it.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Nikki Haley making a generational appeal to Republican voters on a CNN town hall. She sought to walk a careful line on abortion policy. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  She did differentiate herself from Donald Trump and DeSantis.
 
HALEY:  I mean, honestly, we've let guys do it for a while. It might be time for a woman to get it done.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Police say they have found no survivors from a small plane that crashed in Southwest Virginia on Sunday.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  There was that very loud sonic boom. It was the result of the F-16 fighter jets being scrambled.
 
PETE MUNTEAN, CNN AVIATION CORRESPONDENT:  This was something that was intentional and they were trying to get to this airplane with the pilot who was not responding.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The Chinese warship cut in front of a U.S. Navy destroyer. The Pentagon says the two ships came within 150 yards of colliding.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  U.S.-China relationship is at its lowest point in decades.
 
JAKE SULLIVAN, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER:  We will, I hope, soon see American officials engaging in senior levels with their Chinese counterparts over the coming weeks.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is the scene of one of the deadliest railroad disasters that India has seen in its modern history.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  At least 275 people were killed, more than 1,000 injured in the accident.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It was chaos. It was something that I really cannot describe. There were lots of bodies. It was horrifying.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Some quick action from a school bus driver in Milwaukee saved the lives of 37 students.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  If she had acted just one minute slower, this whole scene could have been much worse.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  When the kids are on my bus, they're like my children. So, I just reacted in a way that I was expected to react for my son.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HARLOW:  Total hero. We would all want her driving our children. Good morning, everyone. We're so glad you're with us on this Monday. Rahel Solomon is here. Glad you're here.
 
SOLOMON:  Good to be here, Poppy.
 
HARLOW:  Thanks for getting up extra early.
 
SOLOMON:  Thanks for sharing it with me.
 
HARLOW:  Of course.
 
SOLOMON:  Let's start this hour with this, a sonic boom rocking the nation's Capitol as fighter jets chase a Cessna that flew over D.C. through restricted airspace.
 
So, that boom, that boom there, that was the boom caught on security video.
 
HARLOW:  So, officials say the pilot of this plane was not responding to the radio. So, jets were scramble and the U.S. Capitol was put on alert. The plane ended crashing into the mountains of Southwest Virginia, where no survivors on board. We're told the plane crashed on its own and the F-16s did not shoot it down.
 
Our Correspondent Brian Todd is following this story. Four people died in this crash. Do we know why it happened?
 
BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Poppy, Rahel, investigators still trying to figure that out. There was indeed some very scary moments in the skies over Washington, D.C., ending in that crash not far from here, about 170 miles southwest of D.C. Investigators this morning trying to figure out how that pilot became unresponsive in the cockpit.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
TODD (voice over):  It was the boom heard far and wide across the Washington, D.C., region, disrupting a Sunday music rehearsal, and sending people and pets running for cover. The cause, U.S. 16 fighter jets scramble to reach a Cessna citation private jet unresponsive pilot and flying through tightly controlled Washington, D.C., airspace.
 
According to FlightAware, the civilian aircraft took off from Elizabethton Municipal Airport in Elizabethton, Tennessee, at 1:13 P.M. and was bound for Long Island MacArthur Airport in New York. The plane with four people onboard then turned around over Long Island heading back over the Washington, D.C. area, nearly two hours after it originally took off.
 
That's when NORAD scrambled the F-16s who are authorized to travel in supersonic speeds in pursuit of the jet. According to a new release from the Continental U.S. North American Aerospace Defense Command Region, the pilot of the civilian aircraft was unresponsive as the F- 16 fighter jets attempted to make contact.
 <br>[07:05:03]
 
At one point, according to the statement, the F-16s used flares in an attempt to draw attention from the pilot.
 
The CESSNA 560 Citation 5 traveling more than 300 miles off course going off radar at 3:23 P.M. and ultimately crashing in a rural mountainous terrain near George Washington National Forest near Charlottesville, Virginia.
 
Late Sunday, according to a statement from Virginia State Police, first responders reached the crash site by foot but found in survivors.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
TODD (on camera):  Now, according to FAA records, that private jet was registered to a company called Encore Motors out of Melbourne, Florida, owned by Barbara and John Rumpel. They told The Washington Post that the family members of theirs were onboard that plane, including their daughter, their granddaughter and her nanny. They told The New York Times that the family was returning to their home in East Hampton, New York, from another family home in North Carolina, and that their grandchild was two years old. NTSB investigators are expected to be at the scene not far from here later today. Rahel, Poppy?
 
SOLOMON:  Brian Todd, thank you.
 
HARLOW:  We do have new details this morning about the group of 16 migrants who were dropped off in Sacramento by a private jet without any advance warning. A local charity says they were approached by individuals in El Paso, Texas, promising jobs and other free support.
 
Now, California officials say they're investigating who is behind this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ATTORNEY GENERAL ROB BONTA (D-CA):  We believe that the state of Florida is involved. And one of the vendors that they hired with an official budgetary allotment called Vertol Systems was involved in moving these migrants from Texas to New Mexico then to Sacramento. So, we believe the state of Florida is behind this and we are investigating now to see if there are any criminal or civil laws that have been violated.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARLOW:  All right. Isabel Rosales is following all of this. Isabel, good morning to you. I think the key question is did the -- I know there were promises of jobs, et cetera. Did the migrants know where they were going?
 
ISABEL ROSALES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Hey. Good morning to you, Poppy. So, I spoke with Cecilia Flores (ph). She's an organizer with Sacramento acted nonprofit who has been helping out these migrants, and she told me that they were shaken up, confused, that they told her, many of them didn't know where they were going before they got on to that plane and many of them also not even knowing that Sacramento was in California.
 
So, here's what we know about the journey. These are 16 migrants from Colombia and Venezuela. They went from El Paso, Texas, then they were bussed to New Mexico, from there, flown to California, and then bussed to Sacramento and dropped off on the front steps of a church.
 
Now, Flores tells me that these migrants were promised help by individuals from a private contractor. They were promised that if they went to a different migrant center, they would be helped out with jobs, with shelter, with food.
 
A bus driver dropped them off again at the front steps of the church, rang a doorbell to the building and then told the group that they would be back. The bus then took off and never returned. In fact, one of the migrants called actually a cell phone number to one of these individuals, but suddenly that number was no longer working.
 
Here's Attorney General Rob Bonta of California, who is heading this investigation.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BONTA:  And the first thing that happened when they got here was someone lied to them, told them they would help them find that work that they hoped for and dreamed of. But instead they deserted them and dumped them in Sacramento and didn't lift a finger to help find them a job.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ROSALES:  And, again, Bonta believes that Florida, the state of Florida is behind this, because these migrants had documents that point to official Florida government. He's also pointing to Vertol Systems Company Inc. Again, that is the same aviation company behind other migrant flights back in the fall, two planes full of migrants dropped off in Martha's Vineyard.
 
CNN has reached out to officials in both Texas and Florida for comment. We have not heard back yet. Poppy?
 
HARLOW:  Isabel, thank you for that reporting.
 
SOLOMON:  And new this morning, Russia is claiming that it fought back a large scale offensive from the Ukraine on the frontline in Donetsk, a claim that CNN has not been able to independently verify. And Russia also released this video.
 
The defense ministry claims that it shows Ukrainian armored vehicles coming under heavy fire. You see here plumes of smoke billowing upwards. Ukraine has not commented on these claims yet. But there has been a big push for battleground secrecy ahead of the planned counteroffensive, including a new video with Ukrainian troops -- F-16s were in. Watch.
 
Also, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy telling The Wall Street Journal over the weekend that he and his troops are ready.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[07:10:00] REPORTER:  Which is obviously a tense moment, there is a lot of talk about the counteroffensive. Is there anything you can tell us about that?
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT:  In my opinion, as of today, we are ready to do it. We would like to have certain things, but we can't wait for months. We strongly believe we will succeed. I don't know how long it will take.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SOLOMON:  And this comes as we've seen increased attacks inside of Russia in recent weeks, shelling in the border region of Belgorod, and drone attacks in Moscow, at a Russian oil refinery, even at the Kremlin.
 
Joining us now, retired U.S. Army Major Mike Lyons. Major Mike, welcome to the program. Good morning. So, how significant are what we're starting to see now happening within Russia's territory?
 
MAJ. MIKE LYONS (RET.), U.S. ARMY:  Yes, I think they're significant. I think there's always a chance for asymmetric warfare, and what that means is that once the conventional war kind of dies down, it's this underground troops that take place across the border. I think Ukraine has been setting this for the last few months in areas like Belgorod, for example, where the main supplies are. They have to attack Russia's capability to wage war. They come from supply lines in areas like this. And I think that's why they're going to be effective, because they've set the toll for the past few months.
 
SOLOMON:  Ukraine also making new gains in the east. How significant do you think that all sort of becomes as this counteroffensive unfolds?
 
LYONS:  Yes. I think that -- so, this is the Dnipro River, right? And so this is the main obstacle for anything Ukraine does from a counteroffensive perspective.
 
Now, I'm surprised that Zelenskyy keeps talking about this. I mean, I would want to keep this quiet. We're cabling (ph) over the definition of a counteroffensive. Think battle of the bulge. Think of a massive attack that takes place on an axis of advance in order to split the enemy in a certain location, okay?
 
So, watching the Ukraine military set this up, this report, for example, this morning from Russia, that's a location where likely the counterattack could take place. So, Russia responds to that. But, again, on the other side, they weren't really effective at it. Zelenskyy himself says they don't even control the airspace. So, I'm still not sure that the counteroffensive is actually still on.
 
SOLOMON:  And speaking of the strategy of just sort of diverting resources, walk me through that a bit.
 
LYONS:  Well, they're struggling for areas within the south to bring military assets there. Reports over the weekend say the Abrams tanks aren't there. For them to be effective, they have to fight what's called a combat force maneuver operation, where artillery, tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, bridging material, things that they must bring more to the battle field that they just don't appear to have there just yet.
 
SOLOMON:  Major, over the weekend, CNN had some new reporting that Ukraine has essentially cultivated agents inside of Russia and perhaps also supplying them with drones. In terms of drones, I mean, how significant in terms of equipment are drones?
 
LYONS:  Yes, very effective. This is kind of that third dimension now of this level of warfare to be more creative with what we can do with drones. They obviously observe used for attack. But these are the kind of things that will allow Ukraine to kind of reach out, touch Moscow, touch areas in places that Russia thought they were safe in. And we're really seeing them brought to the battlefield.
 
Both sides, too. The Russians have used those drones that have come from Iran as well. So, this has been a new wrinkle to the battlefield.
 
SOLOMON:  And how do you expect drones right to measure up or to compare in terms of efficacy or at least in terms of strategy moving forward compared to the F-16s, the Abrams, et cetera?
 
LYONS:  Yes, tactical advantage only, not really strategic, not a great linchpin, but it provides certain areas on the ground that would give them more or less a capability that they didn't have there before. It gives them a greater length. They need distance from Ukraine. If they're going to have any success, they need to attack inside of Russia, attack those capabilities they have of waging war there. The drone gives them that capability, but only in a tactical perspective.
 
SOLOMON:  Major Mike, great to have you this morning. Thank you.
 
All right, coming up, Nikki Haley taking swipes at Ron DeSantis and Donald Trump as she tries to stand out from the other Republican presidential hopefuls.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HALEY:  He went and basically gave the highest corporate subsidies in Florida history to Disney. But because they went and criticized him, now he's going to spend taxpayer dollars on a lawsuit.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SOLOMON:  Coming up, we will have the highlights from last night's CNN town hall, as another strong jobs report is easing concerns about a possible recession in the U.S. Yes, that is exactly what I just said. We will break down the latest indicators showing where the economy appears to be heading.
 
We'll be right back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [07:15:00]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HALEY:  I think it's important to be honest with the American people. We are in this situation. Don't lie to them and say, oh, we don't have to deal with entitlement reform. Yes, we do. Yes, we do. It's the reality. I'm always going to tell the truth. Is it going to hurt? Yes. But for our kids, they know they're not going to get it anyway.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SOLOMON:  Republican and presidential hopeful Nikki Haley drawing a clear distinction from her main rivals Donald Trump and Governor Ron DeSantis during the CNN town hall.
 
Joining us now, CNN Senior Political Commentator Scott Jennings and CNN Political Commentator and Attorney Bakari Sellers. Good morning. Welcome to you both.
 
I think let's just start with coming off of that town hall. I mean, how'd she do from your perspective? Was it a good night for her?
 
SCOTT JENNINGS, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  I thought she has a very polished presentation. She may be the most polished politician in the field. The question is, is that what people are looking for, politicians --
 
HARLOW:  Right, that is the question.
 
JENNINGS:  -- these days. And she had some great moments on Russia. I think I like some of the honesty she had on a few issues. She does engage in a lot of the normal political pablum that sort of is out of vogue right now in the Trump era. But, overall, I thought it was a pretty good night. She passed the test and we'll see if it makes a difference in her polling.
 
SOLOMON:  And, Bakari, you know, Nikki Haley. I mean, you were in elected office at the same time. I mean, is this the same --
 
BAKARI SELLERS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  We sat beside each other, not at the same desk, but beside each other for about four years, and we're from the same home county. So, shout out to Bamberg County. We're punching above our weight this morning.
 
But Nikki Haley, I'd said this to folks for a long period of time, she's probably the most talented politician in the country. I say that with no hesitation. She's very skilled. She's very good one-on-one in these small retail settings, which is going to bode well in places like Iowa and New Hampshire and even back at home in South Carolina.
 <br>[07:20:04]
 
The problem that Nikki Haley has is nobody really knows what she stands for, and I'm not sure she clarified that last night. You saw many of the inconsistencies, and sometimes politicians, including myself, we try to get too cute by half and we begin to weave in and weave out, and sometimes we just make no sense.
 
You saw that on things like abortion, where she didn't want to be nailed down, where she signed a 20-week abort bill in South Carolina, with an exception for life of the mother, but no exception for rape and incest. She didn't really want to talk about that last night. She didn't want to talk about whether or not she would sign her successor's six-week abortion ban.
 
And so when you think about these things, you see it was a little bit uneven. She was extremely strong, to Scott's point, on issues that she knows really well on Afghanistan, on Russia, on foreign policy. When she got into wokism and the cultural politics of the day, you saw she was really uncomfortable.
 
HARLOW:  Let's play what she said about Ukraine and western support for Ukraine and then compare it to what one of her rivals, Vivek Ramaswamy, another Republican candidate, had to say about what he thinks we should do vis-a-vis funding Ukraine. Here they were both yesterday.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HALEY:  Ukraine has the ability to win, but we have to think bigger than that. And for them to sit there and say that this is a territorial dispute, that's just not the case, to say that we should stay neutral. It is in the best interests of America. It's in the best interests of our national security for Ukraine to win. We have to see this through. We have to finish it.
 
VIVEK RAMASWAMY, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I do not think it is a top foreign policy priority for us. I don't think it is preferable for Russia to be able to invade a sovereign country, that it's its neighbor. But I think the job of the U.S. president is look after American interests.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARLOW:  Not only did she distinguish herself from him, she distinguished herself on this issue from Donald Trump and from at least where Ron DeSantis was when Tucker Carlson asked him about it.
 
JENNINGS:  Yes. It's a clear-eyed position about the need for the United States to help the Ukrainians repel this Russian invasion. What we didn't play from Ramaswamy is he went further. He said we have to end the war by making major concessions --
 
HARLOW:  And ceding territory, yes.
 
JENNINGS:  -- to the Russians, which is -- I mean, this is like sort of pathetic dorm room debater crap. She had a real clear-eyed position about what's in the best interest. And whether this position is the biggest issue in the primary or not, the fact that someone is saying it out loud and making the case to the American people are, like we got to win this thing, that is a good thing and I'm glad she did that.
 
SELLERS:  She was very clear. She was very good. The problem that Nikki Haley is going to have is that is the Republican Party where she is right now, because she sounded a lot like Lindsey Graham. She sounded a lot like George W. Bush. They just elected Donald Trump, which is the antithesis to everybody I just named.
 
And so Ron DeSantis is going to have his lunch eaten by Nikki Haley and Donald Trump on that stage on the issue of foreign policy. He just does not have the depth. You saw it in the Tucker Carlson interview. But Nikki Haley did show she can debate. I think the problem is where is the majority of maybe not Republicans, but the Republican voting base.
 
JENNINGS:  She was in, though -- she made clear no troops on the ground, we're not doing direct funding. We're arming them. We're working with our allies. I think actually that position will fly. It will be interesting to see if she makes that the centerpiece of her campaign or if this campaign ultimately is just more about the vibe of what it means to be a Republican these days or domestic policy issues.
 
SELLERS:  That's also the position of Joe Biden, by the way.
 
HARLOW:  The vibe versus the issue.
 
SOLOMON:  So, I think that's interesting because, as you pointed out, Bakari, leaning into foreign policy and her strength there because of her time, of course, with the U.N., is that a top issue for Republican voters?
 
SELLERS:  I think it's -- to steal a word from Scott last night, it's more of just like -- this whole thing is just floating on vibes, to steal the word again. It really is. They want a fighter. They want somebody who's going to feel like they're in the ring, they're fighting for them. I don't think they want someone who is an Xs and Os policy wonk.
 
SOLOMON:  Well, you know who is the fighter? Chris Christie.
 
SELLERS:  I'm excited to see that. Don't bury the lead. Why don't you know? Chris Christie is going to be somebody, and I personally have a conspiracy theory. I think Chris Christie has one job in this primary, which is to take out Donald Trump. I think donors got together and said, you go do your Marco Rubio thing to Donald Trump. So, we shall see. I think Nikki Haley will be able to stand the test of time, but I just don't think it's her time.
 
HARLOW:  So, there's -- I get that it might not be what most voters are focused but a real issue with entitlements and funding Social Security and Medicare. And I thought Jake did a really good job last night asking her about her plan because she has been one who said younger folks in their 20s can't be guaranteed to retire at whatever age we're at now. Where are we at? 64, 67?
 
SELLERS:  So far away from it. I don't know. You're closer.
 
HARLOW:  But listen to this, because this is where Jake asked her, okay, at what age? What is your plan then to get this back on track? Here's the exchange. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR:  Time for some honesty from Nikki Haley. If the retirement age is 66 or 67 right now, what are you talking about raising it to for the people in their 20s?
 
HALEY:  Well, we have to go -- we'd have to do the calculations. We'd have to figure out how --
 
TAPPER:  You're an accountant?
 <br>[07:25:00]
 
HALEY:  I am an accountant. And you know what accountants do? Accountants do their homework and they make sure that when they do something, they do it right or they don't do it. So, I'm not going to give you a false number.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARLOW:  The crowd applauded but it was not an answer.
 
JENNINGS:  Yes, it was a little bit of a dodge. And I do like the fact that she's being honest about it.
 
One thing about Trump and DeSantis on this issue is they're trying to appeal to all these new Republicans who you may recognize because they were Bill Clinton's voters in the 1990s. We now sound like Democrats from the 90s on entitlements. This is like, we're not going to touch it, we'll never touch it, there's nothing wrong, let's bury our head in the sand. That's not really a legitimate position, because, as she said last night, it is going bankrupt if we don't do something.
 
So, I like the honesty on the problem. I would like to see more specificity, but this is not the issue that's going to decide.
 
SOLOMON:  What about the issue of woke? I want to play for you very quickly. That, of course, came up last night as well. We'll hear what she said and talk about on the other side.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER:  How do you define woke?
 
HALEY:  There's a lot of things. I mean, you want to start with biological boys playing in girls' sports, that's one thing, the fact that we have gender pronoun classes in the military now. I mean, all of these things that are pushing what a small minority want on the majority of Americans, it's too much.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
JENNINGS:  Oh, you want to you want to take this one? This is your favorite topic.
 
SELLERS:  No, it's not. But the silence was just palpable. I appreciated that. No, first of all, that's not the definition of woke. Woke has been co-opted by a lot of white folk, a lot of conservatives, debased and then used to mean --
 
SOLOMON:  (INAUDIBLE) on Friday's show, exactly.
 
SELLERS:  It's used to mean anything that's not white, that's not straight. And so that's just not what it is. And you hear people talk about things like cultural Marxism. That's not the root of the word. In fact, the word started in 1920 for most of America so that they understand it was about black folk talking to other black folks, saying, stay woke when you're in Mississippi or Alabama. Stay woke politically. Stay woke philosophically. That is what the word means.
 
Now, to take it and make it mean something and debase it, that it does not. And you saw her last night. She was stumbling across the definition. It means transgender girls in a girl's bathroom. Is that what woke means? I mean, what does it mean to you, Nikki Haley? She can't define it, neither can Ron DeSantis. Most Republicans can't. I really hate the debate because it's anti intellectual, but it's a part of their cultural war that they're trying to wage against. I don't know.
 
HARLOW:  Why are you so unsatisfied with Bakari's response?
 
SELLERS:  Because that's the answer.
 
HARLOW:  He's sighing.
 
JENNINGS:  Because, look, the Republicans who are running for president and most Republican voters perceive a very deep cultural rot in the United States that's in government, media, corporations, universities. Everywhere they look, they see this cultural rot. That's the definition. And that's -- so she hit that note on woke, but then she turned around and attacked Ron DeSantis on Disney after saying his one law didn't go far enough, then she attacked him on the lawsuit. She was a little -- she's not as comfortable with it.
 
This is where DeSantis is scoring, because he is the one who has most clearly defined it and seems to be most clearly focused on it and will not let it go or be distracted by other matters.
 
SELLERS:  That cultural rot is also known as diversity. But who's keeping count?
 
SOLOMON:  A lot more discussed here, guys, but the good thing is it's only June. So, we will have plenty of time.
 
SELLERS:  We have much more time together.
 
JENNINGS:  Oh, yes.
 
SOLOMON:  Bakari and Scott, thank you both.
 
All right, coming up this Wednesday, Dana Bash, she's going to moderate a CNN Republican presidential town hall from Iowa live with former Vice President Mike Pence. It airs at 09:00 P.M. Eastern only on CNN.
 
Meantime, The New York Times reporting that a voice memo made by Trump's attorney is now in the hands of DOJ prosecutors. What it could mean for the special counsel's investigation to classified documents. That's ahead.
