JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: All right, new this morning, the Israeli embassy in Ireland has slammed the decision by Ireland, Spain and Norway to recognize Palestinian statehood, saying it, quote, "sends a message that terrorism pays." 
 
Hamas applauded the three countries and called on other countries to follow, saying, quote, "we call on countries around the world to recognize our legitimate national rights, support the struggle of our people for liberation and independence, and end the Zionist occupation of our land."
 
With us now, Congressman Ro Khanna, Democrat from California. 
 
Congressman, we appreciate you being with us this morning.
 
Spain, Ireland, Norway. What's your view of what they decided and the Israeli response? Do you think this shows that terrorism pays?
 
REP. RO KHANNA (D-CA): No, it doesn't. We should recognize a Palestinian state. That has been the United States' policy, a two- state solution. And 143 countries at the United Nations voted for it. Nelson Mandela called for a Palestinian state when he was in the United States in 1990. And it is time that we recognize that. I don't believe Hamas should have any role in a Palestinian state, but recognizing the self-determination of the Palestinian people and a Palestinian state is in no way saying that Hamas should be involved. 
 
BERMAN: Do you think the timing of it, as it comes following October 7th, during the Israeli war with Hamas, do you think the timing sends the wrong message? 
 
KHANNA: No, I don't think it's ever the wrong time to recognize the self-determination of people. You've had - I mean my grandfather was part of India's struggle against British colonialism. And every year during that period they would say, well, is the timing right to give India freedom. 
 
But we need to recognize a Palestinian state. That has been the U.S. policy. And we need to recognize a secure Israel state, the Jewish state, democratic state's right to exist. That is U.S. policy and we should make it official.
 
BERMAN: If I'm not wrong, your grandfather was actually imprisoned for a time for his work on -
 
KHANNA: He was.
 
BERMAN: In that movement.
 
Congressman, you travel the country and you're doing it on behalf of the Biden campaign. I think charged largely with meeting with younger people and perhaps more progressive groups. I mean what are you hearing from them on this subject? 
 
KHANNA: Well, I'm hearing that we need an end to the war, a release of the hostages. But they want a shift in policy. I mean they want to make sure that we're not in any way encouraging Netanyahu to go into Rafah, that we're bringing a close to this war, and then they ultimately want two states. But they have been very upset, understandably so, about what's happening in Gaza and the loss of life.
 
BERMAN: Do you approve of the ICC decision, the International Criminal Court, to seek arrest warrants on Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli defense minister?
 
KHANNA: I don't think they should arrest Prime Minister Netanyahu. And I've been very, very critical of Prime Minister Netanyahu, but there's no equivalence in my view between the Hamas terrorist organization and a Democratic state, even though I have deep, deep disagreements with Netanyahu. 
 
But I also don't think that the United States should be sanctioning the ICC and we should allow them to do their work and figure out what laws were broken and - and to have a report. That doesn't mean that they should go arresting Israeli leaders. I just don't think that that's going to help get to a two-state solution or a peace process. I would look at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa, which in my view is a much better model.
 
BERMAN: Shifting gears, you are a California representative. Silicon Valley. You hosted a forum on AI. And a group called the Tech Transparency Project, "The Washington Post" reported this, noted that some two-thirds of the people you invited to have this, what was supposed to be, I think, independent discussion on the implications of AI, had ties to the industry. What's your reaction to that report? 
 
KHANNA: Well, I - these were leading scholars from Harvard and Duke and Stanford and they understand AI. Now, are some of them doing consulting work for a technology company? Probably. But they're still the people who've written the leading books and the leading scholars on technology. 
 
So, my whole purpose was to get the academic voice in there. It's almost impossible to go to the leading scholars and then them not have some connection. So, I think it's fine for that to be out there, but the criteria was who are the leading scholars in the field. 
 
BERMAN: So, Congressman, I came across an article this morning, and I want to make sure I have this right, but you were meeting with a group - you were on a forum with a group of other Indian American members of Congress on stage. 
 <br>[09:35:06]
 
And there was - there was a discussion about the future. And your colleagues were asked, and I think I have this right, they said, is Ro Khanna running for president? And I think all of them, according to this article, said, yes. Can you verify that this actually happened?
 
KHANNA: Well, my focus is on reelecting President Biden so we can have future elections. But, you know, John, that's what they pride (ph). I mean the Greek Americans loved it when Dukakis ran. And ethnic communities are pride - have pride. When I was growing up, my parents couldn't get a meeting with a staff member to a member of Congress. Today, there are five Indian Americans. And it was wonderful that we're seeing more representation of different communities.
 
BERMAN: I don't think they were saying you're running now per say. I think they were suggesting that the long game. But this actually happened, right? All of your colleagues were like, right on, Ro Khanna is running for president.
 
KHANNA: There were - they were encouraging. And I - I'm - I'm flattered by my colleagues. But like I said, the most important thing right now is to reelect the president.
 
And, John, here's what I'm excited about. After this election, with two people from a different era, the freshmen and new classes of Congress and Senate are incredible. People from all different backgrounds, all different ways of life. And I'm excited about the next generation of voices. And I think a lot of the country wants the next generation as well. 
 
BERMAN: Listen, I've interviewed a lot of people who are considering running for president one day who give very much the same answer that you just gave me here.
 
Congressman Ro Khanna, thanks for playing this morning. Really appreciate your time. 
 
Kate.
 
KHANNA: Thank - thank you, John.
 
KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR: Coming up for us, it started as a vacation to Turks and Caicos for a 40th birthday party. Now an Oklahoma man is facing charges, one a five Americans facing 12 years potentially in prison, having - because they had - because he had ammunition in his bag when he went - got onto the island. A congressional delegation just went there to try and secure his release. Ryan Watson joins us live from Turks and Caicos, next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:41:58]
 
BOLDUAN: A family vacation ends as a nightmare. Ryan Watson is from Oklahoma, and he is now waiting in Turks and Caicos to learn his fate really after authorities there allegedly found ammunition and his luggage. What he and his wife have said was an innocent mistake. Ryan was arrested on April 12th. His next hearing is next week. And he is one of five Americans now facing the possibility of a 12-year prison sentence each because of the country's strict laws on firearms and ammunition. One of the others charge, Tyler Wenrich, you're seeing his face right there, he just pleaded guilty to charges yesterday and will now await sentencing. 
 
Ryan Watson and his wife, Valerie, they're joining us now. Ryan, of course, from Turks and Caicos, and Valerie, who's back home in Oklahoma with their children. 
 
Thank you both for being here. 
 
Ryan, how are you doing? 
 
RYAN WATSON, DETAINED IN TURKS AND CAICOS: You know, just relying pretty heavily on prayer right now. It's - it's a difficult situation. It's impossible to - to understand. And I try on a daily basis to get my head wrapped around it and I still can't.
 
BOLDUAN: Yes, I mean, you were arrested - as I mentioned, you were arrested on the 12th of April. You've been out on bail for about a month. And I read that you and Tyler, who I was just talking about, are - actually have been staying together during all of - during all of this. He just pleaded guilty yesterday to two counts of ammunition possession. What does his plea mean for you, Ryan? 
 
R. WATSON: Right. Actually, I - it's Bryan Hagerich from Pennsylvania is the one that's living with us, as well as Sharitta -
 
BOLDUAN: Sorry about that. 
 
R. WATSON: No, it's all good. Sharitta Grier from Florida. We moved her in this past weekend as well. So, I gave up my bed and I started sleeping on the couch so she could have a place to stay.
 
You know, we're all in this together. You know, we're - we are the most uniquely woven quilt to exist I believe at this point, but we are here to support one another. And there's - there are nuances to each and every case. However, there are so many similarities through these five cases that we're all watching very closely each other's cases. Next one up is on Friday with Bryan Hagar, just sentencing.
 
BOLDUAN: Yes. I want to talk about your case and the details of it in just a second. 
 
But, Valerie, I mean, you were allowed to return home on - in late April. What has this been like for you being back in Oklahoma with your two young kids. And we were talking, our kids are the same age. What has it been like for you waiting?
 
VALERIE WATSON, HUSBAND DETAINED IN TURKS AND CAICOS: You know, I - we take it day by day. It's really challenging to be able to answer some of the kids' questions, you know, when they say, is daddy going to be home the day after tomorrow? Our seven-year-old has more of those questions. Our nine-year-old so much doesn't. He kind of is - he kind of internalizes a lot, doesn't ask a ton. 
 <br>[09:45:01]
 
He's really smart and just - I think he understands a lot of what's going on. But our seven-year-old, she asks every night, is daddy going to be home tomorrow? Will he be home when I'm in second grade? What about third grade? Because my answers right now are just, I don't know. We just have to wait and we have to be patient and just see where, you know, what God's plan is for us. And we just - we pray and we're trusting in his plan. 
 
And - but it is - it's hard. I don't - I don't have answers for their questions. And I wish that I did.
 
BOLDUAN: So, Ryan, airport security found ammunition in your bag at the airport. Why was there ammunition in your bag? What have - what - what did you tell them? How - how you got where you are in this moment, explain this.
 
R. WATSON: Yes. To be completely honest, I never recall putting that ammunition in my bag. That bag was with me on a hunting trip that I took in the fall where I was using the rifle that uses that type of ammunition, which is a very, very specific type of hunting ammunition that is hard to source, frankly. I don't ever recall having that in my ammunition. I never saw it whenever I got the bag off the shelf. You know, I did a quick check of the bag, gave it a little shake, you know, off we went. We went through TSA in Oklahoma City. It was never discovered there. And on our way out of TCI (ph) the customs agents kept doing multiple scans of the bag. They basically disassembled the bag in order to find where they had slipped down in between the lining. And they extracted it. The moment they extracted it, I recognized it and, you know, I apologized. I did not - I've never traveled with ammunition before, but I've heard stories of some of my hunting buddies that have, you know, had certain mishaps in the states and I thought, oh my gosh, my mistake. I figured they would just dispose of them and we would, you know, be on our way. But unfortunately, that's not been the case.
 
BOLDUAN: I mean you're facing the possibility of 12 years in prison for this. I mean, Valerie, what would a 12-year sentence mean for your family? 
 
V. WATSON: Every time I hear it, it's really difficult to hear. It would uproot us. It would be very hard. I - I can't - I haven't tried to let my thoughts go there yet because I'm just so hopeful that it can be resolved in a different way and that 12 years is not what they're going to sentence. It's going to be really hard. The kids, growing up without their dad. That's not ever something we've ever even imagined. Not something I want for them. You know, again, God has a plan for us and we're just prayerful that he continues to guide us through it all and sustain us through it all.
 
BOLDUAN: And, Ryan, we actually had on earlier in the show a Virginia congressman who was one of the congressional delegation who was just in Turks and Caicos to try and secure your release. Senator Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma was there as well. It didn't work I guess is one way - one way to put it, but do you think the visit was helpful? Has the federal government - has the U.S. federal government been helpful? Has the State Department been helpful? 
 
R. WATSON: You know, I hope it has an impact. And I hope that it in - I hope that it motivates other delegation to continue to get involved. I hope that it motivates our State Department to take a - a stronger action, possibly even our president, to pick up the phone and make a phone call.
 
You know, I've never been more proud to be an Oklahoman -
 
BOLDUAN: Ryan, would you like to hear that? Would you - if President Biden was actually listening right now, what would you say to him? 
 
R. WATSON: Please, please pick up the phone. I feel like cool heads could prevail in this situation. There are much easier ways to handle this situation. In fact, since Bryan Hagerich's arrest on February 13th, there have been three other individuals that we know of that have - that were just charged under the customs act. They were caught with ammunition at the same airport that we were. And they were just charged under the customs act. They paid a fine and off they went. However, for some reason, the five of us, this is our fate.
 
BOLDUAN: Ryan, thank you so much. You - your next hearing is next week. We will be watching it very closely. 
 
Valerie, I can see the pain on your face and what it's - the strain and stress of what it's doing to you and your family. Thank you so much for joining us, guys. We'll stay in close touch. 
 
V. WATSON: Thank you so much for having us this morning.
 
R. WATSON: Thank you.
 
V. WATSON: Thank you.
 
BOLDUAN: Thank you.
 
R. WATSON: Thank you.
 
BOLDUAN: We'll be right back.

 <br>[09:54:16]
 
BERMAN: This morning, the NTSB is joining authorities in Singapore to look into what caused the severe turbulence that killed one person and injured more than 100 people. Right now 20 are still in the ICU after the Singapore Airlines flight was forced to make an emergency landing in Thailand.
 
CNN aviation correspondent Pete Muntean is with us now.
 
Pete, what are you learning this morning?
 
PETE MUNTEAN, CNN AVIATION CORRESPONDENT: Well, this investigation is just beginning. And we know the National Transportation Safety Board from here in the U.S. will help those authorities in Singapore who are investigating this now.
 
The big question they will want to look at is the weather at the time of this incident. We know that this all went down about ten hours into this flight from London to Singapore over Myanmar. And this is the radar image of the rapidly developing thunderstorms to start a monsoon season there. 
 <br>[09:55:03]
 
Just to give you an idea of how quickly these developed. Over about an hours' time, according to CNN's weather team, these thunderstorms went from 20,000 feet tops, that's the top of the storm cell, to 50,000 feet. So, we're talking a lot of difference over a very short period of time. 
 
The problem here is that this may have just been the ingredients of a thunderstorm, but have not been seen by the pilots, not only with their eyeballs, but also on the radar, causing a lot of up and down drafts that led to this aftermath on board this Boeing 777. 
 
Of course the thing now is what people think of turbulence. And that is something that so many people are asking me. It's something that is often very, very invisible to pilots and it's often caused by thunderstorms. That could be a cause. Also things like a mountain wave, that's wind that's hitting the side of a mountain. And then there's something called wind shear, which is two layers of wind. 
 
We've heard from passengers who have said that they understand that this is not really something that pilots could do or avoid here, but this is something that so many people are wondering about. It seems like over and over again these turbulence incidents happened, John. 
 
BERMAN: All right, Pete Muntean, thank you so much for that. 
 
BOLDUAN: Absolutely. And thank you all so much for joining us. This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL. "CNN NEWSROOM" with Jim Acosta is up next.
 
Sara, you got this. 
 
BOLDUAN: You got it, Sara.
