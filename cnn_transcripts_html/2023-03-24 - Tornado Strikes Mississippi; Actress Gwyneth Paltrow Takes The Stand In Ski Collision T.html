THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
<br>[23:00:00]
 
CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Crews are on their way. Police are asking for as many ambulances as we can get.
 
This is the storm here through Rolling Fork and then on up toward Belzoni. It was on the ground as a likely an EF-3 or greater for a very long time. This is the color-coded doppler velocities showing the circulation right over that town. Ant it may still be on the ground right now. It was about 10 minutes as the storm has moved 75 miles to the northeast. This is the area we are watching.
 
This highlighted area here in orange, this is where most of the weather will be tonight. There will be more weather and there are likely going to be more tornadoes. The problem is it's 10:30, 10 o'clock there in the central time zone. People are sleeping. You need to get away from this storm.
 
Many of these tornadoes that we've seen tonight are underground tornadoes. You need to get underground to survive them. That's how large they are, and they're still going on right now.
 
Alisyn, this is going to be a deadly night, I'm afraid. I've seen pictures here in Rolling Fork and it looks bad.
 
ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN HOST:  Okay, Chad, come back to us as soon as you have any updates. Thank you very much for that breaking news.
 
Now, we want to turn to Gwyneth Paltrow taking the stand today, testifying in her own defense in a lawsuit that accuses her of skiing into a 76-year-old man on a beginner slope. He says he suffered broken ribs and a traumatic brain injury as a result, but Paltrow says it was his fault, not hers.
 
So, there's a lot to discuss. Let's bring in our panel. We have our defense attorney, Joey Jackson, here, former Democratic Congressman Max Rose, psychotherapist Robi Ludwig, and former U.N. spokesperson Hagar Chemali. Also joining us is Stan Gale, who is a ski and snow sports safety consultant.
 
So, Stan, I want to start with you because you've consulted on 200 ski collision cases, as I understand it. So how is this one that Gwyneth Paltrow was involved in? How's that? How's it stacking up for you? STAN GALE, ROCKY MOUNTAIN SKI AND SNOW SPORTS SAFETY CONSULTANT:  What do you mean by stacking up?
 
CAMEROTA:  Meaning do you think when you hear her on the stand?
 
GALE:  What do you mean by that?
 
CAMEROTA:  In fact -- you know what? Actually, let me play her on the stand so that we all can hear this. Let me play for you how she explained --
 
GALE:  Okay.
 
CAMEROTA:  -- what happened on the stand and then you can analyze it. Listen to this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GWYNETH PALTROW, ACTRESS:  I was skiing and two skis came between my skis, forcing my legs apart. And then there was a body pressing against me. And there was a very strange grunting noise. So, my brain was trying to make sense of what was happening. I thought, am I -- is this a practical joke? Is someone like doing something perverted? This is really, really strange. My mind was going very, very quickly, and I was trying to ascertain what was happening.
 
UNKNOWN (voice-over):  Okay. I think you said, I didn't know if it was an accident, but he was groaning and grunting in a very disturbing way.
 
PALTROW:  Yes, there was a sort of grown coming out of his mouth.
 
UNKNOWN (voice-over):  Okay. You said, this was was behind me on the mountain. My knee and our skis were still sort of tangled up.
 
PALTROW:  Uh-hmm.
 
UNKNOWN (voice-over):  Yes.
 
UNKNOWN (voice-over):  Is that a yes?
 
PALTROW:  Yes, right.
 
UNKNOWN (voice-over):  Our bodies were almost spooning, and I moved away quickly.
 
PALTROW:  Yes.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CAMEROTA:  Okay. So, Stan, what do you think of her description of what happened? Stan, are you frozen? I think we've -- I think we've lost him for a second. Oh, Stan, can you hear me? All right.
 
GALE:  Well --
 
CAMEROTA:  Go ahead.
 
GALW:  Well, her description -- her description -- sorry, there's a bit of a time lag here. The description matches what one would expect in a ski collision where there's a person in front and another person in back. And if the skis go through a person's legs, obviously, that person is overtaking the skier in front of them.
 
CAMEROTA:  I mean, if you're on a green run, which this was, and I believe we even have some video of this, it is called the Bandana Run. This is at Deer Valley. It sounds like she was having a ski lesson, so she is, it sounds like, not a great skier.
 
People hit each other. This happens. It doesn't happen all the time, but it happens certainly on ski runs. And so, what -- what separates a regular ski collision from negligence and from turning it into a court case like this?
 
GALE:  Well, when the negligence -- negligence is involved, there is one person who -- who causes the incident to happen. And it is very important when skiers ski to maintain a look out ahead, to survey the slope ahead, to be in control of their course and speed to be able to avoid people or objects or children or fences or things like that that are on the ski slope.
 <br>[23:04:57]
 
By maintaining a look out ahead, you can gauge your speed, you can make turns, you can slow down. And that's what constitutes negligence. If you're negligent in those responsibilities, those responsibilities are put forth in the skiers' responsibility code in order for people to understand and act accordingly when they're overtaking people or skiing too close to people --
 
CAMEROTA:  Yeah.
 
GALE: -- to prevent this sort of incident from happening.
 
CAMEROTA:  I mean, you're never supposed to speed ski out of control, but as I understand it, actually, in further reading, she's an intermediate. She describes herself as an intermediate skier. But you can, of course, get out of control and fall. So, from what you've heard thus far from her testimony and in the case, who do you think was at fault here?
 
GALE:  Well, you know, I've only heard piecemeal testimony and it's very important as a professional investigator not to take a side in the case until -- I reviewed all the evidence as well as done my own investigation.
 
And by the way, I'm familiar with the Bandana slope. I investigated another ski collision there about 10 years ago. So, I'm very familiar with that particular slope. So, I'm not going to take a side at this point.
 
All I can say is that if the skis went the defendant skis -- excuse me, the plaintiff's skis went between her legs, that puts her in front and that puts the onus and the responsibility on the plaintiff to avoid here.
 
CAMEROTA:  Okay.
 
GALE:  That's very clear.
 
CAMEROTA:  Yeah. Okay, Stan, stand by, if you would. I want to bring in my panel. Hi, guys. That was interesting, to hear Gwyneth Paltrow. Here is another moment from her. Basically, they were asking if she stuck around after the accident to see if he, who she says collided into her, was okay. So, let's listen to that.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
PALTROW:  I think you have to keep in mind, when you're the victim of a crash, right, your psychology is not necessarily thinking about the person who perpetrated it.
 
UNKNOWN (voice-over):  So, the answer to my question is no, you did not inquire?
 
PALTROW:  No, I do not.
 
UNKNOWN:  Okay. Did you ever ask, hey, how was that guy that ran into the back of me? Is he okay? Do you ever ask anybody from Deer Valley about that?
 
PALTROW:  I did not because at the time, I did not know that he had sustained injuries like that. I thought it was very minor on the day.
 
UNKNOWN (voice-over):  And you didn't stick around long enough to find that out?
 
PALTROW:  I stuck around long enough for him to say he was okay to stand up, that he told Mr. Christiansen he was okay.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CAMEROTA:  Um, Robi, what do you think of this testimony and hearing Gwyneth Paltrow on the stand?
 
ROBI LUDWIG, PSYCHOTHERAPIST:  Well, I think she was what we expect Gwyneth Paltrow to be. She's icy, a bit imperious. But I also found her to be honest and authentic. And I liked that she didn't appear to be acting and falsely warm. She described herself as she was during those moments, and I think she's very believable. She's not warm and fuzzy. She may not be that empathic, but it also sounds like the events unfolded as she described them at that moment in time.
 
CAMEROTA:  It's so interesting, I think, to hear her on the stand because she's an actress. We normally see her playing a part. We normally see her in a glamorous -- on a red carpet in a glamorous gown. And she, you know, we see her in glasses. We see her when she was sitting in the not on the stand but just in the general -- at the table. She -- she didn't necessarily look like Gwyneth Paltrow the way we imagine and it's just interesting to hear her in this kind of everyday situation. But what about -- Robi, one more question. Her description of the first collision where she was describing, his legs came through mine, I heard some grunting, I thought that there was a practical joke or maybe a pervert was doing something.
 
LUDWIG:  Well, she's in Hollywood and we know her experience with Harvey Weinstein. And also, I think, she has been the victim of stalking, and she is a celebrity. So, you have to think.
 
You know, people can abuse you or stalk you and you can totally see where she would have that experience and wonder, is this deliberate as somebody sexually trying to do something to me? And then she got her bearings and realized that it was an accident. So, I thought it was a very powerful testimony and well done on her part.
 
CAMEROTA:  Hagar?
 
HAGAR CHEMALI, FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL DIRECTOR:  Yeah, I agree. You know, a lot of people accuse her of being out of touch with reality. And she can be. But she is also not known to be nasty or cruel or dishonest. Quite the contrary. She is very open about her life. She is very candid and blunt about a range of things, things that her company sells.
 <br>[23:09:59]
 
You know, her wellness routine as she calls it where she really doesn't eat much. You know, she's -- she's open about all these things, so I don't see why she would behave any differently. I was looking at it as though I was a juror, you know, part of the jury, jury of peers, and I thought as well that she was being quite honest.
 
What I thought was ashamed is that -- you know, I had to wonder, you have to ask yourself. Would this -- would the plaintiff be acting this way or going down this path the way they're going down if she weren't who she is? You have to ask that question. And I don't know.
 
CAMEROTA:  Joey, you're the -- you're our lawyer here.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
You know, someone interesting point about this is that there was a GoPro video and the difference -- so the so-called victim here named Sanderson had -- was wearing GoPro and there was video, but they can't find that video.
 
JOEY JACKSON, CNN LEGAL ANALYST:  Very interesting.
 
CAMEROTA:  What does that tell you?
 
JACKSON:  It tells me that if there was a video, that supported my cause and my lawsuit, I find it somewhere. So, I'm looking at a few things here. The first thing I'm looking at is context, right? The second thing certainly I'm looking at is her actions. And then I'm looking at her ask, what is her demand? So, let's look at the context. She's out with her family. Her two children, her boyfriend at the time who becomes her husband, and his two children. Does that suggest that it's going to be a day where I'm wallowing up the skis and going around?
 
I'm going to be attentive to my family, making sure everything is okay. My kids are good, our kids are our life, everybody, okay? And of course, I want to impress my future partner, right? I mean, her husband. And so that's the context. It seems a bit strange that she would be all wild that she's being described. It's a beginner slope. So, that is kind of off to me.
 
And then you pivot to her actions. Right after it happened, she was pretty pissed off. You know, when you get into an accident, it's not your fault, generally human nature, I'm so sorry, I'm really sorry, my bad, you know, can we forget about this?
 
And then, of course, her ask. She's asking for dollar and she certainly has the money. It's $300,000. She couldn't just say for nuisance value --
 
CAMEROTA:  She is being sued for 300,000.
 
JACKSON:  Exactly!
 
CAMEROTA:  You're saying that she could have settled?
 
JACKSON:  That's right, Alisyn. I mean, it's 300,000. She -- I don't want to go to court, I don't want experts, I don't want the attention, take a hundred, leave me alone. And so, it just seems to me that she is innocent as charged, and she's okay.
 
CAMEROTA:  Max, do you have anything burning to say about this because I have to move on to another high-profile case?
 
MAX ROSE:  Everyone is lying. I don't trust --
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
CAMEROTA:  On that note, we move.
 
JACKSON:  Politics.
 
CAMEROTA:  So, another very high profile this month, as we all know, is the Murdaugh trial. He was convicted of killing his wife and son. Now, they're auctioning off his belongings, the belongings from their, you know, hunting lodge or their -- I guess that's what you call it. And so, today was the auction. Here are some of the things that were auctioned off from the Murdoch house.
 
It was a Yeti cup. It typically retails for $35. It went for $400. A beer koozie. Those, I believe, retail for a dollar, roughly or they can be made for that, and that was auctioned off for 500. Mounted antlers from this lodge, $10,000. A furniture set at $30,000.
 
So, guys, let me start with you, congressman. What do you think the interest is in having a piece of memorabilia from a high profile but (INAUDIBLE) family story?
 
MAX ROSE, FORMER NEW YORK REPRESENTATIVE:  These are some creepy people that are doing this. I mean, imagine the tour of the house. This is, you know, my memorabilia from murder scenes, you know. Come on, let's go hang out and have a drink.
 
I would say, though, that, and this is something that is, I think, part of the fabric of American culture and society, is we have this cult of celebrity and it actually does not matter what the root cause of the celebrity is, it is just that everyone is talking about it and everybody wants a piece of this.
 
CAMEROTA:  Its notoriety.
 
ROSE:  Its notoriety because this is -- if you actually stop to think about it, this is gruesome stuff.
 
CAMEROTA:  Uh-hmm.
 
ROSE:  And it's awfully weird and creepy and all the rest. But nonetheless, it was in the papers, it was on TV, now you have little piece of it. There's nothing probably more American than that.
 
CAMEROTA:  Joey, as a criminal defense attorney, I'm sure you've seen this. What do you think is behind this?
 
JACKSON:  There's a few things. So, one, I think Max is right on point in terms of the celebrity culture and people wanting to be a part of that and just being so fascinated by it. The second thing, I think, is just it's historic, and I think people want to buy into the history.
 
There was a moment in time where there was this madman or whoever, however you want to describe him who did this to his family. Can you believe that? And I'm part of that. And then the second or the third thing I'll say is people could be a little nutty.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
CAMEROTA:  True words never spoken on this panel. Uh, Robi, what do you think is the psychology of this?
 
LUDWIG:  Yeah, it is called murderabilia. There is a word for it. And usually, it's when people buy what serial killers make.
 <br>[23:15:00]
 
But it is a part of the story, right? It's to be a part of the story and there is an aura and mystique around these items because they belong to a murder. It's a cautionary tale of someone who thought they were so powerful and wealthy they could do anything and yet they can't. So, there is a whole interesting kind of tragedy behind it.
 
But it is also maybe vicariously thrilling to be close to a murderer in some way and be safe. Some people even believe it's like a talisman. It can protect you from evil.
 
JACKSON:  Wow.
 
LUDWIG:  So, there are a lot of different perspectives here.
 
CAMEROTA:  Murderabilia, really fascinating.
 
LUDWIG:  Yeah.
 
CAMEROTA:  All right, friends, thank you very much for all that. Stick around. Twenty twenty-four is looming. And of course, one of the big questions is, should Kamala Harris still be on Joe Biden's ticket? We're going to discuss that next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[23:20:00]
 
CAMEROTA:  Vice President Kamala Harris making major personnel move. She's hiring Stephanie Young, a veteran Democratic aide as her new senior advisor, focusing on messaging and outreach. The vice president's performance in her role has been criticized, including by some Democrats. They're questioning whether having her on the ticket will hurt Biden's chance of re-election.
 
My panel is back with me and our friend, Doug Heye, joins us now. Great to have you, Doug.
 
DOUG HEYE, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Thank you.
 
CAMEROTA:  Okay. So, in 2020, Hagar, you wrote a piece on CNN.com about how having Vice President Harris, you basically called it Biden's chief foreign policy appointment, his running mate, and you argued that she would be a great asset, I guess, in foreign policy. So, what has happened since then?
 
CHEMALI:  Well, I argue this because she had a number of stances while she was on Capitol Hill in favor of human rights, against dictators, was strong in her voice and opinion, and that is what I thought our foreign policy needed.
 
That's certainly what the president said that he would do when he got to office, that he would make human rights a central tenet of our foreign policy. But then when she got to office, she wasn't really given portfolios that match anything in foreign policy.
 
CAMEROTA:  Why not?
 
CHEMALI:  It's -- the only thing I can try and I don't know the real -- I'm going to -- I'm going to estimate here. Guess here is that having been in the White House and worked on that side, it can get territorial between the vice president's office and the National Security Council which staffs the national security advisor and the president. And President Biden has had decades of experience in foreign policy.
 
And I'm not -- by the way, I'm not criticizing his decisions or his experience or the decisions he has made, but she's an asset, and so I thought that and I assumed that she would have been more included. She is a woman of color. That's a great representation to have for the United States on the world stage and it just doesn't seem like she was deployed in a way that I thought would be very effective.
 
CAMEROTA:  Doug, you've been around Washington in a long time. What do you think has gone wrong with the fit because people just don't -- as you know, you hear the buzz, they have -- they don't know that she sorts of found her footing in this role?
 
HEYE:  Well, look, every -- every vice president faces at some point some questions about are they going to be on that ticket or not. We so often talk about in politics, are they playing three-dimension chess or what have you? Politics is not three-dimension chess. It's checkers. And it is very simple for Biden and his team at this point.
 
Your most powerful demographic for your voting bloc, your core base, African American women. So, there's no chance that Joe Biden is going to kick Kamala Harris off this ticket at all unless he says, I want to have a campaign that is going to be on really rocky ground at this point. African American women, your core base, Kamala Harris is there, she's going to stay there. That's it.
 
CAMEROTA:  I understand the politics of what you're saying, but in terms of what has -- do you think something has gone wrong with the vice president? Do you think she's deployed -- been deployed well or there has been some tension or something?
 
ROSE:  Well, first of all, if someone -- if a whole group of people think something about you in politics, it's your fault. And she can make all the excuses in the world that she wants. There is a branding and image problem, and that's reflected in the numbers.
 
But with that being said, though, no one is a good vice president. Okay? We still make fun of Quayle, we still make fun of Gore, we still talk about Cheney's Darth Vader.
 
CAMEROTA:  Wasn't Joe Biden more high profile than Kamala Harris?
 
ROSE:  Wait, wait, wait, the entire story of 2021 was that all these Obama aides were still making fun of Joe Biden even though he was now the president because for eight years, they ignored him as the vice president.
 
Let's not lionized Joe Biden's tenure as vice president. In fact, perhaps some of the story here is that the abused go on to abuse. Joe Biden -- Joe Biden said -- Joe Biden said, oh, God bless you, Kamala Harris, I'm going to give space and the border. Now, go out there and do great things. No wonder people are talking about her not accomplishing the mission in front of her. They were impossible tasks.
 
I think, ultimately, nonetheless, you can't take the politics out of politics. The rule -- the facts are the facts but --
 
CAMEROTA:  So, he gets her on the ticket?
 
JACKSON:  Definitely. He definitely does. First of all, to Doug's point, totally agree. And I'm not just saying that here. My talking points in advance were right in accord with you. I don't think that you thumb your nose at a community that's so central to your popularity and central, quite frankly, to your success.
 
The other thing is, I think this is an opportunity for him. Exert your leadership. There are going to be times where people think people of unpopular. What are you going to do? You're going to fold? Are you going to say to the haters and the naysayers, I'm standing up, I'm standing above, and I'm sticking with you?
 
And I think it's an opportunity for him to do that. If does it well, I think he can move forward and move on.
 
CAMEROTA:  And what can she do differently, Hagar?
 
CHEMALI:  So, listen, I -- while I agree with the politics, I actually think they have to seriously consider move whether or not they replace her with someone else.
 <br>[23:25:01]
 
There is precedent for it. It has happened before. When -- when Ford became president, he had Nelson Rockefeller as his vice president. When he ran again, he had Bob Dole as his new running mate. So, it has happened before. He didn't win, but it has happened before.
 
CAMEROTA:  But what about their point that -- that -- you know, Black women voters really like her being on the ticket?
 
CHEMALI:  Do they? I mean -- I mean, how strong do they feel about that? I'm not saying about the community is important. This is an important community. But the latest article I read actually on CNN said that that the majority of the democratic base doesn't view that -- I don't want to mess this. I don't want to mince these words because I want to be very careful here. It is not placing a heavy emphasis on diversity in this role.
 
Now, I think that it's important to have diversity in this role. I don't want to see people to judge their -- you know --
 
CAMEROTA:  Really interesting.
 
HEYE:  I agree with you.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
CAMEROTA:  -- talking during the commercial break. It has been a busy week in the news. Have you been paying attention to everything that has happened? We're are going to quiz our panel on what they know. But before that, CNN's presentation of HBO's "Overtime with Bill Maher" right after this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[23:30:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CAMEROTA:  Let's turn it over now to our friends at HBO. Every Friday, after "Real Time with Bill Maher," Bill and his guests answer viewer questions with their unique perspectives. We are excited to bring you this lively discussion first every Friday night. So, here is "Overtime with Bill Maher."
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
BILL MAHER, HBO POLITICAL TALK SHOW HOST:  Okay, here we are on CNN with our panelist this week. David Sedaris is over here with his new book out, Professor of marketing at New York Stern School of Business Scott Galloway --
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
-- and the great writer for "The Atlantic" Annie Lowrey. And here are things that people want to know about. Okay, a group of conservatives recently said they want to create an A.I. chatbot of their own --
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
-- to combat liberal bias. Can we? Well, I've heard there was liberal bias. I heard -- I've read that, that that chatbot is a little woke.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
Can we expect A.I. to be used as a political weapon in the near future? I think it already is. I mean, it's funny that you create something that is supposed to be smarter than everybody and above it all, and immediately, we're breaking down into, you know, we're going -- that's what it's going to be. You're going to have the liberal chatbot and the conservative, right?
 
SCOTT GALLOWAY, PROFESSOR, NYU STERN SCHOOL OF BUSINESS:  Yeah, there's some (INAUDIBLE) traditional media. I think it's hard to argue that there isn't oftentimes a liberal bias because it's mostly overeducated people in urban centers.
 
But with respect to new media and technology-driven media, there's no evidence that there's any sort of bias. They don't lean left. They don't lean right. They lean green. They're all about money. They really don't care. As a matter of fact, seven of the 10 each day, most viral pieces of content are usually from conservative commentators. So, there's just no truth to the notion, at least, online media has a conservative bias.
 
MAHER:  Hmm. I know people.
 
GALLOWAY:  I'm sorry, liberal bias. Excuse me.
 
MAHER:  Oh, all right.
 
(LAUGHTER) MAHER:  David, is there any material you wouldn't perform in red states? Oh.
 
DAVID SEDARIS, AUTHOR:  You know, I think I've heard you say this before. You know, I would go to Oklahoma and people say, who was there? It's like everybody who didn't vote Republican is there.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
MAHER:  Or that there are some who did. I hope they all come. I welcome everybody in my -- and I'm sure you do, too.
 
SEDARIS:  Uh --
 
MAHER:  No?
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
SEDARIS:  -- I don't like it. No.
 
MAHER:  No?
 
SEDARIS:  No, I do. But I don't like -- you know, like, sometimes you do a show and you get a laugh from people and you, eh, that didn't feel right to me. I don't want to pander to the audience.
 
MAHER:  No?
 
SEDARIS:  You know, I don't want to. So, I'm happy to go to a red state.
 
MAHER:  Right. And quite frankly, there is more to make fun of on the left in the last five years. I mean, I'm seeing -- I'm seeing in your book, too. You know, people ask me that all the time. Why do you make fun of the left more?
 
GALLOWAY:  Because you're providing comedy for a comedian. That's why.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
ANNIE LOWREY, STAFF WRITER, THE ATLANTIC:  Right. All the cities are blue. If you just want to talk to Democrats, you just go to cities, right? Regardless of the state, yeah.
 
MAHER:  Exactly. I mean, Alabama, I've been -- I played Mobile, Alabama.
 
SEDARIS:  Yeah. The only thing, you got to bring your own hotel, though.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
MAHER:  I -- one of the times I was in Alabama, I swear, there was a bass fishing something the same night. I was going out to the show. And on -- there was -- I swear to God, there was a large crowd walking one way that I could tell was for the bass fishing.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
I won't go into details. And then my crowd was going in the opposite direction. And it could have been any city in the country. So, I mean, and that's Alabama. Okay. What do you make of --
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
-- Xi and Putin's meeting? Well, boy, they exchanged friendship bracelets, didn't they?
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
Xi and Putin. I'll -- you go first. But then I will tell you.
 
GALLOWAY:  I think that's the biggest and scariest news of the week while we're all scared about -- I don't know. We're worried about trans swimmers or worried about our kid marrying a Republican. The real threat is an axis power forming between Russia and China, and it should be scared.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
You know, China of today is different than China 10 years ago. And they are -- they're not a competitor. They're adversaries and maybe even enemies. The swing vote will be India. But we should absolutely be. It should have sent chills down the spine of every American seeing those two together.
 <br>[23:34:58]
 
MAHER:  I mean, I was mentioning on the --
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
-- show that -- in the 20th anniversary of the Iraq war.
 
LOWREY:  Yeah.
 
MAHER:  I think this is a result of that. I think, you know, when -- well, in the sense that Xi and Putin see America, they saw 20 years ago, we invaded a sovereign country.
 
GALLOWAY:  Yeah.
 
MAHER:  I mean, we would make the case that we had reasons that Putin doesn't have and going into Ukraine, but that's not how they see it. So, their view is -- and yes, China and Russia never had any love for each other, even during the cold war when they were both communists, and they should have been allied closer, was very frosty.
 
But their idea is we have to just be -- number one is to be anti- America. America is the one who is trying to bully the world. We -- we've seen it over and over again. And we have to line up against them. That, I think, is the scary part, is because they're going to get more people to join in on that premise.
 
LOWREY:  Yeah, and I think that there's the eternal folly that wars are won quickly, which we learned twice that that wasn't true recently. And I think that the Russian engagement in Ukraine is going to last for many, many, many years to come, weakening that state considerably. And it's terrifying. I don't know.
 
MAHER:  Okay. A school principal at a Florida school recently resigned after parents complained that students were shown Michael Angelo's David. Oh.
 
LOWREY:  It's a nice sculpture.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
MAHER:  Was it really appropriate or just an example of parents being too fragile about what their kids are taught in schools? Was this principal had to resign because he showed David is a great work of art? Yes, the dick is out, but --
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
-- it is.
 
SEDARIS:  And it was no better than the students.
 
MAHER:  I was going to say, it would probably bolster the confidence of sixth grader.
 
SEDARIS:  Yeah.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
MAHER:  I mean, that's a very -- name of that statue should be -- it was cold out.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
GALLOWAY:  I served on the board of my kid's school in Florida, and the notion that we're trying to pull the gay or the straight out of them is just ridiculous. We -- schools aren't trying to turn kids into (INAUDIBLE). They're trying to turn them into warriors.
 
And these culture wars that divide us and use schools as weapons to inflame some weird, imaginary problem in schools, it is just -- it's another example of instead of working on the things that actually affect us, people want to figure out what offends us so they can raise money. It's a (INAUDIBLE) topic.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
LOWREY:  Yeah, it's a --
 
MAHER:  Hey -- LOWREY:  You know, the --
 
MAHER:  -- we are on CNN. Watch your mouth.
 
GALLOWAY:  I'm sorry.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
MAHER:  Keep your swear words out of your mouth.
 
GALLOWAY:  Sorry about that.
 
LOWREY:  You know, the southern strategy as the most effective political strategy that we've seen deployed in the United States in the past 100 years. And I think that we're seeing Republicans attempt to turn anti-trans legislation, anti-LGBTQ legislation into kind of version of the southern strategy that whips voters up.
 
And I think that it remains to be seen how that -- you know, certainly in the midterms, it didn't seem to work terribly well but, of course, what's at risk is the health and safety of children and the rights of Americans to live how they want and love who they want. So, yeah, it's awful.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
MAHER:  Ah, okay. Kyrsten Sinema -- Christine or Kyrsten?
 
LOWREY:  Kyrsten.
 
GALLOWAY:  Kyrsten.
 
MAHER:  Okay. Curse at C (ph), I got it, Kyrsten Sinema --
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
-- she is the senator from Arizona. She is now an independent, right? She was elected as a Democrat but was not quite Democratic enough for the party. A liberal. So, she is independent. She recently said she's not going to eat in the cafeteria anymore because it is just old dudes eating Jell-O.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
(INAUDIBLE)?
 
SEDARIS:  No.
 
MAHER:  Well, I'm telling you. See, aren't you glad you're listening to this show?
 
SEDARIS:  You know what? I lost so much weight eating diet Jell-O?
 
LOWREY:  Really?
 
(LAUGHTER) SEDARIS:  Jell-O is great.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
MAHER:  I don't think that's the point she was going for. You know, I think as a tangential topic --
 
LOWREY:  It's regular Jell-O like a lot of calories --
 
SEDARIS:  -- lot of calories in it. Yeah.
 
MAHER:  Sure, it's all sugar like everything else.
 
LOWREY:  I'm told about it.
 
SEDARIS:  But Jell-O has 40 calories for the whole box --
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
-- and you're feeling hungry, and you eat two boxes of Jell-O and you're full and it's 80 calories.
 
MAHER:  Jell-O, we drink it here on CNN.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
Okay. Al right. It's kind of -- it's kind of be. Any -- any thoughts on the old people drinking Jell-O because you're talking --
 
GALLOWAY:  I what you're saying is that our elected representatives are probably not representative of America. The average age of American is 38. The average age of an elected representative is 64, meaning every time someone like AOC is elected to Congress, someone else is dead.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
I mean, it's -- what do you know?
 <br>[23:39:56]
 
Cost of living adjustment, biggest in history for social security recipients, and the tax credit -- the child tax credit gets stripped out of the bill. We don't have a representative government. We have basically people who are much older running our government. We need more youth. We have the second oldest elected populist. We don't have a representative government.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
LOWREY:  I'll also say, Sinema is one of the few politicians, I think, on the Hill who retains the capacity to surprise and, you know, it feels like --
 
MAHER:  Also, kind of like to tell it like it is. I mean, I don't --
 
LOWREY:  Maybe.
 
MAHER:  I don't think she was making so much of a political statement. She is just saying, I don't want to eat with Steny Hoyer.
 
LOWREY:  Yeah.
 
MAHER:  You know? I mean --
 
LOWREY:  I think a lot of members of Congress don't necessarily want to sit down and eat with Kyrsten Sinema at this point.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
MAHER:  But we love all politicians in this show. We have to be mindful of advertisement here on CNN. So, eat you Jell-O and we will see you next week.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CAMEROTA:  That was fun. We always love "Overtime." You can watch "Real Time with Bill Maher" on Friday nights on HBO at 10:00 p.m. and then watch "Overtime" right here on CNN Friday nights at 11:30. We'll be right back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[23:45:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CAMEROTA:  All right, everybody, it's Friday night and you know what that means. It's news quiz night. Let's see what my panelists know about this week's news stories. Okay, everybody, I have a quiz for you. Let's see how much you've been paying attention.
 
Here's the first question. When I say three, you're going to turn over your answers. Okay? Get ready.
 
ROSE:  Do we have to be quick to it?
 
CAMEROTA:  No.
 
JACKSON:  Okay.
 
ROSE:  We can just --
 
CAMEROTA:  That's not --
 
HEYE:  There are no buzzers.
 
CAMEROTA:  There are no buzzers. Well --
 
ROSE:  Oh, my God.
 
CAMEROTA:  I don't know. Maybe there is buzzer. I can't remember. We have a sound effect.
 
ROSE:  There is no prize, though.
 
CAMEROTA:  Okay. An Oreo cookie? Here we go. Number one, this week, President Xi and President Putin met for talks. Where did they meet? A, Beijing, B, Moscow, C, Mariupol? And one, two, three. Hmm, it's Moscow. Joey --
 
JACKSON:  I said that, yes.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
CAMEROTA:  Joey said A. Okay. Moving on. Number two, President Biden issued his first veto this week for a bill that would A, ban the word "woke," B, mandate all cars sold to be electric by 2025, C, overturn a retirement investment rule? One, two, three. Okay, yeah, you're all right, it is C.
 
HEYE:  Doesn't the investment rule ban the word "woke" though?
 
ROSE:  Right.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
CAMEROTA:  You guys are smart. Okay, moving on. Number three --
 
ROSE:  I cheated.
 
CAMEROTA:  Okay, saw cheating. Saw cheating. Okay, turn over your things. Okay, number three, a dentist accused of killing his wife googled A, how to dispose of 120-pound body, how to make poison, or C, can someone OD on laughing gas? Okay, choose your answers now, panelists, in one, two, three. Okay, you said B, B, A, A. The Bs have it.
 
HEYE:  Oh!
 
CAMEROTA:  How to make poison. That is the answer to that one, okay?
 
ROSE:  Rigged.
 
CAMEROTA:  It is not rigged.
 
ROSE:  Like the 2020 election.
 
CAMEROTA:  Here we go. Here we go.
 
HEYE:  Like in 2020 election.
 
CAMEROTA:  Researchers at Columbia University this week use a 3-D printer to print A, a vegan cheesecake, B, a soccer ball, or C, a pair of shoes? Did researchers at Columbia University print A, a vegan cheesecake, B, a soccer ball, C, a pair of shoes, in one, two, three. Only A has it. Only Dough knew.
 
HEYE:  Oh, man!
 
CAMEROTA:  How did you know it is cheesecake?
 
HEYE:  Because if it is 3-D printed, it has to be vegan, if it's a cheesecake, because the 3-D can't print milk.
 
CAMEROTA:  That's interesting logic, Doug. That's --
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
CAMEROTA:  I don't know how you got there.
 
HEYE:  If it is a 3-D printer, cheesecake is going to be vegan.
 
CAMEROTA:  Why couldn't they printed a soccer ball or pair of schools?
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
HEYE:  I don't know what I would have done, but vegan.
 
ROSE:  Doug clearly has access to the answers.
 
CAMEROTA:  All right, moving on, okay, the fed raised interest rates again this week. How many times have they hiked it over the past year? A, five, B, eight, C, nine? One, two, three. Only Joey Jackson --
 
JACKSON:  Oh, wow.
 
CAMEROTA:  -- has it, nine times. Joey Jackson. Nine times. Wow.
 
JACKSON:  Nine times. (INAUDIBLE) day off.
 
CAMEROTA:  Okay, guys, one more. 0ne more and then we are going to see who won. Okay, here we go. As young actors Ben Affleck and Matt Damon shared, A, a jeep Cherokee, B, a checking account, or C, a Dunkin Donuts uniform? Okay, in one, two, three. And it goes to Joey, a checking account.
 
JACKSON:  Unbelievable! Look at that! Boom!
 
CAMEROTA:  Now, I think that I wasn't moderating probably because I didn't -- wasn't counting who was winning. Who won?
 
JACKSON:  We are all winners. We are all winners. We all get a trophy, Alisyn.
 
CAMEROTA:  You all get a trophy. You all get an Oreo.
 
ROSE:  That's the way it goes.
 
CAMEROTA:  Everyone, thank you very much. Feel free to let me know how you did on Instagram or Facebook or you can find me on Twitter.
 <br>[23:50:00] Okay, up next, the Museum of Failure, which is a lot more fun than it sounds. It's featuring some of the biggest flops in history, and you'll definitely remember a few of these.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CAMEROTA:  New York's newest attraction is called the Museum of Failure, and it's dedicated to products that bombed with the public. Remember Crystal Pepsi? Consumers were not impressed by clear soda. They said it tasted too much like regular Pepsi.
 
Rival Coca Cola had a major bomb with Coke II, which was dubbed New Coke. The consumers were furious that the original recipe was changed.
 <br>[23:54:58]
 
The company quickly realized its mistake and rebranded the old formula as Coca Cola Classic.
 
Then there were potato chip lovers who turned up their noses at fat- free Pringles. They were made with a chemical additive known as olestra, which had the unfortunate side effect of causing a lot of consumers to have gastrointestinal issues.
 
And Google's splashy product, Google Glass, had smart glasses with built-in cameras. It was a smashing failure. The technology never really worked and the prominent camera freaked people out over privacy concerns.
 
The museum notes that users were dubbed "glass holes." On that note, thanks so much for watching, everybody. Have a great weekend. Our coverage continues now.
