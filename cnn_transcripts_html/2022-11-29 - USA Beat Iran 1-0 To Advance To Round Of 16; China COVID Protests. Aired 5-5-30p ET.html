ALISON KOSIK, CNN HOST:  Hello, and welcome. I'm Alison Kosik in New York, and this is THE GLOBAL BRIEF. 
 
Ahead, Iran out of the World Cup as the U.S. dominates the winner-takes-all match. 
 
Then, surveillance and security checks. How police in China are clamping down on anti-lockdown protesters. 
 
And Musk makes another move. Twitter announces it's overturning its COVID misinformation policy. 
 
We begin in Qatar with the FIFA 2022 World Cup. Team USA, now advancing to the round of 16 after beating Iran 1 to 0. 
 
To run us through the game that wrapped up just less than an hour ago, I want to bring in Coy Wire from CNN's "WORLD SPORT". 
 
Coy, take it away. 
 
COY WIRE, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR:  Yeah, Alison, thank you. 
 
This match was dripping with drama, not just because it was win or go home for the USA, or win or draw or go for Iran, but because of the political 
 
 talking points permeating this match. The Iranian team singing the anthem, this time looking to advance to the knockout stage for the first time. 
 
 America's looking to advance after not qualifying for the last cup at all. 
 
And they sealed their fate early. Superstar Christian Pulisic scored in the 38th minute. They say big-time players make big time plays and a big-time 
 
 game. This was big time. 
 
The U.S. only had one other goal in this tournament until this one, but this one was all they needed to advance. Pulisic was injured on the play, 
 
 though, writhing in pain. He finished the half, but after half time, he never returned. It would be a major blow for the Americans if he is unable 
 
 to continue on the weekend, and a major blow for Pulisic, who finally has his first world cup moment. We will follow that action. 
 
I want to bring in our correspondents Andy Scholes is in a pub in Atlanta, Georgia. And Jomana Karadsheh has reaction out of Iran from neighboring 
 
 Turkey.
 
Andy, let's start with you. Big win for the Americans. What was it like? 
 
ANDY SCHOLES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  It was pretty awesome, Coy. It is winding down right here in the Fado Irish pub in Atlanta, Georgia, but this place -
 
 - I mean, it was packed. It was wall-to-wall people. There was about 600 people in here, just hoping to see Team USA finally come through with a big 
 
 goal, and a big win, and they delivered. 
 
There were so many anxious moments early. Team USA was getting those opportunities, but they just could not cash in on them until, as you 
 
 mentioned, in that 38th minute, this place went absolutely bonkers when Christian Pulisic was able to bury that goal into the back of the net and 
 
 that ended up being the deciding goal as Team USA advances out of the group stage now into the round of 16. 
 
I talked to a lot of the fans here as they were leaving and they said they couldn't be more proud of this team. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It was incredible. I thought we played the first half brilliantly. Towards the end, I was a little scared, but in the end, it all 
 
 worked out. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  So proud, and so ready to go to the next round, I think we are going to kill it. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This team is, young they're hungry, they do not stop, 90 minute strong. We got through today, so happy, unbelievable win for the 
 
 USA, let's go, baby, all the way. Netherlands, we are coming for you, brother! Whoo!
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SCHOLES:  So, as you can see, Coy, this wind means so much to Team USA fans. As you mentioned, they make it to the World Cup, fans have been 
 
 waiting eight years for a moment like this. Almost like now we are playing with house money against the Netherlands because getting out of the group 
 
 stage was the first goal for Team USA, I think that if they were to beat the Netherlands, boy, would that be a huge, huge step in the right 
 
 direction for this team. They have not made it to the quarter finals since 2002. 
 
WIRE:  Andy, I am glad that you did not get an eye popped out, that was one heck of a mustache. Thank you for bringing us the sights and sounds from 
 
 team USA fans. 
 
But you didn't mention the Netherlands and the knockout stage. You have been to both watch parties there. What are your chances, do you say, for 
 
 Team USA in the next stage? 
 
SCHOLES:  Well, we'll see. You know, it's going to be tough if Christian Pulisic has a bad injury, and he's not going to be able to play, that would 
 
 be a big blow for Team USA because we already know it is not one thing we are struggling to do when I was score goals. We have got out of the group 
 
 stage scoring two of them. That is not easily done. 
 
We would have a big loss if we do not get on the pitch come Saturday. But this team is resilient, Coy, they have done just what they needed to do 
 
 every single game in order to keep moving on. We will see. 
 <br>[17:05:00]
 
They will definitely be underdogs, though, on Saturday. 
 
WIRE:  Andy Scholes, thank you so much. We'll be seeing a bit more of you in about a half hours time on "WORLD SPORT". 
 
For now, I want to go to Jomana Karadsheh, for some insight on Iran. 
 
Now, they played at admirably. They have held their ground all tournament, representing the nation so well. A disappointing defeat, not advancing to 
 
 the knockout stage, but they must be proud. 
 
What are you seeing and hearing? 
 
JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Coy, I have to tell you, in the last few minutes we started seeing video trickling out of Iran, and it is 
 
 truly extraordinary. We are seeing people celebrating their national team's loss. 
 
I mean, this is truly remarkable. You can see these scenes and think that people are celebrating, actually a lot of the video is coming from the 
 
 Kurdish region of Iran where the government has really intensified its crackdown on protesters there in recent weeks and people are out 
 
 celebrating in the hometown of Mahsa Amini. They have got fireworks, and you have got people chanting, and clapping. 
 
I mean, people are happy to see their own national team lose. And this says so much about the situation right now because a lot of Iranians have been 
 
 speaking to, say that they have been disappointed by their team. This is team mainly, the nation's team as it has been known to the Iranian people. 
 
No matter how they felt about the regime, football, and that team always united Iranians. But they felt let down by the team when they saw them 
 
 singing the national anthem after that first match when they went for their second match, singing the national anthem, a lot of people were 
 
 disappointed when the regime people would tell you, exploited that moment with these huge celebrations that we saw after the win over Wales. 
 
You had the security forces, Coy, the same security forces that are accused of horrific human rights violations, and accused of killing hundreds of 
 
 people during this crackdown out celebrating on the street. That really hurt people, and it really upset them. They felt like this was a moment 
 
 where the peoples team, as it was known, would take that moment when they were on the global stage, and people are watching them so closely to show 
 
 their support for the protesters in their country. 
 
Of course, we know that they have been under immense pressure. We have heard about the threats, they have been under, making it very difficult for 
 
 the team to show any sort of support. But a lot of people felt, look, athletes have done this in the past few weeks. They have stood their ground 
 
 and they showed support for the protest movement, and this team should have done the same. 
 
But they feel like it was hijacked by the regime. That this was no longer the peoples team. Right now, we are seeing these scenes, the Internet is 
 
 quite slow because the government is blocking the Internet in Iran. So people are slowly trickling out, and we are seeing people celebrating, 
 
 including in the capital Tehran as well -- Coy. 
 
WIRE:  Jomana Karadsheh, thank you for bringing us that insight, the background, the perspective of the pressures, not singing the national 
 
 anthem in their opening match, and then singing along in the latter matches, you can only imagine that they just wanted to go there to play 
 
 football. They try to do their best, both on and off the pitch, admirable at the very least. 
 
Thank you, Jomana Karadsheh, from Istanbul. 
 
Now, there will be plenty more coverage on CNN's "WORLD SPORT" in about 20 minutes time. 
 
For now, I'll hand it back to my colleague, Alison, in New York for a look at today's global headlines -- Alison. 
 
KOSIK:  Coy, thank you. 
 
Ukraine's foreign minister is telling European allies his country needs more air defense weapons and generators as quickly as possible. Ukrainian 
 
 government officials say that the second winter of the war will be very challenging. With Russia targeting energy infrastructure in order to quote, 
 
 commit another genocide of the Ukrainian people. 
 
NATO foreign ministers met in Bucharest Tuesday, pledging more power equipment and aid to Ukraine. The alliances secretary general says that 
 
 Russia is failing in its military goals, and it is trying to use winter as a weapon of war. Jens Stoltenberg saying they won't let Putin win. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JENS STOLTENBERG, NATO SECRETARY GENERAL:  Therefore, to create the conditions for a lasting peace, which ensure that Ukraine prevails as an 
 
 independent, sovereign state, we must continue to provide military support to Ukraine. So, our message is that NATO will continue to stand with 
 
 Ukraine for as long as it takes. We will not back down. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KOSIK:  Sam Kiley joins me now from Zaporizhzhia. 
 
So, Sam, you know, very high-level officials say that the most important thing now is to get supplies to fix Ukraine's energy system. The question 
 
 is, will this actually happen? 
 
SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESONDENT:  Well, there are signs that this is happening. The French had pledged 100 large generators, for 
 
 example. 
 <br>[17:10:05]
 
Similar pledge has come from other countries. The United States pledging $53 million of extra aid out of that NATO meeting in Bucharest. 
 
But he also said, although, the joint statement that come out of that meeting, it also said very importantly, that is not only do they need to be 
 
 a surprise the means by which Ukraine can fix and maintain its energy structure in the face of these relentless assaults by swarms of cruise 
 
 missiles, but crucially that they must be provided with the means to defend their airspace. Now, they haven't committed in detail, but there are now 
 
 open discussions going on in Washington, confirmed by CNN's reporting by my colleagues in Washington, that the United States is at least considering 
 
 the use of Patriot missiles here. 
 
That is fraught with all sorts of training issues, logistic issues, and resupply issues. But the Germans have just announced that they are going to 
 
 be sending more of their mobile anti-aircraft guns, which are pretty old fashion, but very effective against drones.
 
So it clearly is a very vocal recognition coming out of NATO, that Ukrainians more help defending its skies, as, of course, the hot war 
 
 continues on the ground, Alison. 
 
KOSIK:  Okay. Sam Kiley live for us from Zaporizhzhia, thanks so much for your reporting. 
 
The U.S.-backed Syrian democratic forces believe that turkey may launch a ground defensive in northern Syria in a matter of days, unless countries 
 
 like the U.S. and Russia show forceful opposition. In the past week, Turkish President Recep Erdogan launched air strikes in the region against 
 
 Kurdish militant fighters, which he considers to be terrorists, and he warned he will follow up with a ground invasion in order to clear a so-
 
 called 30 kilometer safe zone, emptied of Kurdish militants. 
 
In China, quote, the whole atmosphere is chilling. That is how one protester is describing the intense crackdown in multiple cities. It 
 
 follows days of widespread protests over COVID restrictions. Police are also stopping people on the streets and on public transit, checking mobile 
 
 phones, even calling protesters to tell them not to try it again. 
 
At the same time, health officials have just announced a new vaccination effort, and particularly at the elderly, and they are calling on local 
 
 officials to limit areas for lockdowns and other tight restrictions. 
 
CNN's Selina Wang is in the Chinese capital of Beijing for us. 
 
Selina, so authorities are moving to crush these rare protests. Talk us through what you are seeing. 
 
SELINA WANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, Alison, what we are seeing is China stick to its playbook of repression, of surveillance, even individual 
 
 intimidation tactics playing out in broad daylight, with some reports from protesters that they have even received visits from police to their homes. 
 
 Now, I was at the protest in Beijing earlier this week, and I later went back to that exact same place the following day, and it was hard to believe 
 
 that a protest had ever taken place there at all because less than 24 hours later, it was filled with police cars as far as the eye could see. 
 
So there is a physical security presence at all of the protest sites that have broken out in recent days, and a blanketing of police cars also in 
 
 potential protest areas because the goal here is to stop the momentum in its tracks. 
 
And as you can see, the video there are playing, there are police that are stopping people around where the protests broke out in Shanghai, checking 
 
 peoples phones, asking them to delete content, also other video that shows police appearing to be checking people's phones on the subway. What we have 
 
 heard from protesters is that these authorities are checking to see if people also have installed VPN, virtual private networks on their phones. 
 
This is necessary in order to get around China's great firewall so that they can access banned apps like Twitter, and messaging apps like Telegrams 
 
 that have been used by some protesters to communicate. Now, what is also chilling here is that it appears to be working. It appears to be effective, 
 
 because the scale, the scattering of protests, we have seen the scale greatly reduce since the weekend. 
 
There was video of an attempted protest in Hangzhou that was -- appeared to be pretty quickly broken up by police officers, with videos of a woman 
 
 screaming as she was being dragged away, and police violently pushing people around. But we have to remember here, Alison, that the very purpose 
 
 of China's giant security and surveillance apparatus is to precisely prevent social unrest like this. So they are going to go all out. 
 
KOSIK:  OK. Selina, thanks so much.
