ZAIN ASHER, CNN HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Zain Asher in New York and this is One World. A senior Ukrainian official says, quote, the gates of war 
 
 have opened on Russian territory, as Kyiv is pounded by another consecutive day of punishing Russian strikes. 
 
We begin with a series of fresh attacks and casualties on both sides of the border. Residents ran for cover and took shelter underground in the capital 
 
 Kyiv, as Russia launched some three dozen cruise missiles and Iranian-made drones, as well. Ukraine's air force says all the projectiles were 
 
 destroyed. Two people were injured. 
 
Meantime, in Moscow today, Russian President Vladimir Putin says ill- wishers must be prevented from destabilizing Russia. His remarks come amid reports of drone attacks and shelling in multiple regions, including Kursk. 
 
 The governor of the border region of Belgorod says two people were killed in strikes. CNN's Sam Kiley is following all the developments and has the 
 
 latest from eastern Ukraine. 
 
SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: In the latest claims coming out of the office of the governor of Belgorod, he is claiming that 
 
 two civilians have been killed and now several thousand have been evacuated from frontline villages inside Russia. These are villages that weren't on 
 
 the frontline until a week or so ago and now are getting hit regularly, he says. They're also getting involved, according to Russian dissidents 
 
 serving effectively under the command of the Ukrainian security forces who've crossed into Russia. They're getting affected by their own 
 
 campaigning. This has rattled Vladimir Putin. This is what he said. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Today, we will deal with the same issues in relation to ensuring the security of Russia, in 
 
 this case, domestic political security, taking into account the efforts that our ill-wishers are still making and intensifying in order to stir up 
 
 the situation inside Russia. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KILEY: Now, Putin, there is talking about two things. First of all, steadying the ship in the face of these regular attacks now that are 
 
 affecting cities as far apart as Smolensk and Krasnodar in the northwest of Russia and the south. Both have seen attacks by drones against oil 
 
 facilities there. We've seen the ongoing attacks inside Belgorod and the drone attacks against Moscow, all contributing to instability and deep 
 
 concerns within the Russian nomenclature about what on earth is going on. 
 
The mercenary leader of the Wagner group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, calling the military leadership in Russia clowns and saying that he expected his 
 
 mercenaries would soon have to move to protect Russian soil itself out of the Ukrainian theatre altogether. Now, he is a notorious critic of the 
 
 Kremlin, but this is a clear indication right across the power structures within Russia that they have been deeply affected by what's going on, on 
 
 their borders with Ukraine and at the same time continue to prosecute their own campaign against civilians with yet another night of airstrikes against 
 
 the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. Sam Kiley, CNN in Kharkiv. 
 
ASHER: The strained relationship between the U.S. and China looms over Asia's most important security conference, which got underway Friday in 
 
 Singapore. One of the highlights of the dinner session was a handshake between U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and his Chinese counterpart, Li 
 
 Shangfu. The two men only spoke very briefly. The U.S. wanted a formal meeting between Austin and Shangfu, but China refused, so this may be as 
 
 close as they get during this security summit. 
 
One of the major topics at the summit is tensions between North Korea and other Asian nations. As the summit is going on, the U.S. and South Korea 
 
 are holding large military exercises near the North Korean border. CNN's Paula Hancocks has more. 
 
PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The scenario of these military drills is very clear, and that is that North Korea has staged what's been described 
 
 as an illegal armed invasion in the scenario, and this is the joint counterattack by the U.S. and South Korean militaries. 
 
(voice-over): There's no doubt it is more blatant than usual. North Korea is the enemy, and the U.S. and South Korea are training together to defeat 
 
 that threat. Now, we're told that this is the biggest joint live fire drill ever, a reflection of the perceived threat posed by North Korea around 30 
 
 kilometers or 18 miles north of here. 
 <br>[12:05:00]
 
We have seen a year and a half of unprecedented missile launches and weapons tests from Pyongyang. So, this, today, is a coordinated military 
 
 drill from the air and on land. Twenty-five hundred soldiers from the U.S. and South Korea, six hundred and ten pieces of military equipment. It is a 
 
 clear message to North Korea. The official line is, it is to demonstrate, quote, peace through overwhelming strength. 
 
BRANDON ANDERSON, CORONEL, DEPUTY COMMANDING OFFICER, U.S. 2ND INFANTRY DIVISION: I think the message is that we're prepared, that the training 
 
 that we do is efficient, it's working. 
 
ANTHONY LOPEZ, CAPTAIN, U.S. 2ND INFANTRY DIVISION: The takeaway is just having confidence in the credibility of the alliance and our ability to 
 
 execute kind of that extended and integrated deterrence together. 
 
HANCOCKS (voice-over): Now, North Korea says that these drills are a large part of the reason why it has conducted so many tests, saying that the 
 
 failed military satellite launched this week was in response to what it called the dangerous military acts of the U.S. Another reason for these 
 
 bigger joint exercises, this year marks the 70th anniversary of the U.S.- South Korea alliance and also the 75th anniversary of the founding of South Korea's military. 
 
(on-camera): Now, these drills are being staged on five separate days, each with around 2000 spectators, some of them regular citizens who volunteer to 
 
 come and watch. So, a fun day out for some, a show of force for others. Paula Hancock's CNN, Pocheon, South Korea. 
 
ASHER: In the coming hours, U.S. President Joe Biden will give his first Oval Office address on the resolution to America's debt limit crisis. After 
 
 weeks of negotiations in Washington, the Senate passed the debt ceiling bill late Thursday, removing the risk of a global economic catastrophe. The 
 
 deal suspends the $31.4 trillion debt limit until January 2025, allowing the federal government to continue to pay its bills. 
 
Republicans used the must-pass bill to extract concessions from the Democrats including a cap on non-defense spending. The bill now heads to 
 
 President Joe Biden, who will sign it into law. 
 
CNN's Jeremy Diamond is at the White House. So, Jeremy, I think the good news for both sides here is the debt ceiling issue is now removed through 
 
 the elections until January 2025. Obviously, it was impossible for both sides to get everything they wanted. But can either side really claim this 
 
 as a win here? What are your thoughts? 
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, I think we're starting to see that from both sides frankly and that's kind of what was expected 
 
 here. This is a deal that depending on the way that you read it can look like a win for either side. If you look at what it is on paper in terms of 
 
 the numbers before some of these adjustments are made, it looks like a win for the republican side bringing spending much closer to Fiscal Year 2022 
 
 levels. 
 
But if you then add in some of the adjustments that they were able to use here including IRS money for example bringing back some COVID funding, and 
 
 then using that as a backstop for some of the domestic programs that are cut on paper, looks like a better deal for the White House, coming just a 
 
 billion dollars shy of a Fiscal Year 2023 spending freeze for next year, which is pretty close to what the White House's opening offer in these 
 
 negotiations actually were. 
 
But what is clear is that neither side got everything that they wanted here, and that was a point that the president underscored in his statement 
 
 about this debt ceiling deal late last night after the Senate was able to pass this on a bipartisan basis. And what is ultimately clear is that for 
 
 the American economy, this is certainly a victory of sorts in the sense that we are averting the worst potential outcome that could have come as 
 
 early as Monday. 
 
Keep in mind with the potential for the first ever default in U.S. history, that would have been a catastrophe for the U.S. and for the global economy. 
 
 And so obviously that worst case scenario has now been averted. 
 
And what's more, the White House officials that I've been talking to have also been pointing out that this really helps to clear the decks for the 
 
 rest of President Biden's term. It disincentivizes the government shutdown later this year by incentivizing appropriators to actually pass some of 
 
 those key government funding bills. And it also, of course, takes the issue of the debt ceiling off the table through the next presidential election 
 
 cycle. 
 
ASHER: And some other news that came out yesterday, President Biden was at an Air Force graduation event, and he tripped and fell, apparently fell 
 
 over a sandbag. Just walk us through what happened and obviously we hope the president is okay. 
 
DIAMOND: Yeah, the president was delivering remarks at this Air Force Academy graduation ceremony. He then spent about 90 minutes shaking hands 
 
 and saluting each and every one of those hundreds of cadets. And it was only after that portion was over that the president then started to walk 
 
 off stage. He tripped on a sandbag that was holding up some of the teleprompters. 
 
The White House says he's fine but look for yourself. Here's the president returning from the White House yesterday. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Got sandbags.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[12:10:00]
 
DIAMOND: And the president cracking a joke there and then doing a little bit of a two-step to show that he's doing fine. But obviously this issue of 
 
 him tripping, you know, it would not be as big of an issue if you were a younger man. He's 80 years old, he is the oldest president in U.S. history. 
 
And questions about his health and physical fitness to serve have really dogged his presidency and are once again becoming louder as he approaches 
 
 another re-election campaign. So, certainly something to watch for, something that the White House is on guard for, but they insist that he's 
 
 doing just fine and that he is fit to continue serving. 
 
ASHER: Yeah, and he made light of it. I love that little two steps he did there. Jeremy Diamond live for us there. Thank you so much. All right, 
 
 Former President Donald Trump is responding to CNN exclusive reporting about a 2021 audio recording obtained by federal prosecutors. In the 
 
 recording, sources say that Trump acknowledges holding onto a classified Pentagon document about Iran after leaving office. This undercuts his 
 
 argument that he just declassified everything after leaving the Oval Office. Trump tried to discredit report during a town hall event on 
 
 Thursday by calling it part of a witch hunt. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: All I know is this, everything I did was right. We have the Presidential Records Act which I 
 
 abided by a hundred percent. It's a continuation of the greatest witch hunt of all time. It's a hoax and it has to do -- it has to do more than 
 
 anything else with trying to interfere with the election. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ASHER: The Justice Department is still investigating Trump's handling of classified documents. Violence over an opposition leader's jail sentence 
 
 has left at least nine people dead in Senegal. Former tax inspector Ousmane Sonko was given a two-year prison term Thursday for quote-unquote 
 
 corrupting youth. His party says the verdict is politically motivated and is urging supporters to take to the streets. 
 
An internet monitoring group says numerous social media apps are now being blocked in Senegal. The government says they've been restricted to limit 
 
 the spread of what it calls fake news. All right a new court appearance Friday for the Kenyan religious leader accused of running a doomsday cult 
 
 that led to at least 249 deaths. Paul Nthenge Mackenzie will be held for at least five more days to allow his lawyers time to challenge prosecutors' 
 
 requests that he stay in jail for at least two more months. 
 
He spoke with CNN's David McKenzie at Friday's hearing insisting that he never saw any of his followers try to starve themselves. David McKenzie 
 
 joins us live now with more on that. So, he's appearing in court -- he appeared in court rather. You spoke to him. Just walk us through a bit more 
 
 of what he had to say for himself, David. 
 
DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Zain, he is certainly denying all of this and the details of this horrific story just 
 
 continue to unfold here in Kenya on the coast and it affects families from across the country. Professionals including policemen and social workers, 
 
 flight attendants and others were all sucked into allegedly this cult that was centered in a forest near where I'm standing where they set up in a 
 
 community following this pastor Mackenzie, where they say in early this year, he said that the world was coming to an end. 
 
The culmination of many years of sermons to tell the people to turn their back on the government, to stop their children from going to school, to 
 
 throw out their national IDs, to stop working and to join his cult, they started starving themselves to death based on witness testimony, survivors 
 
 and people we spoke to who managed to rescue them from that cult. 
 
Now, many of those victims were children. As in, more than 240 people or bodies and remains have been recovered thus far. This man who is allegedly 
 
 was the man who told people to do this and they followed him blindly to what was the end of the world was in a court today in Mombasa. I put these 
 
 allegations to him. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PAUL NTHENGE MACKENZIE, LEADER, GOOD NEWS INTERNATIONAL CHURCH: It's just a matter of intimidation and wasting of others' time for nothing. 
 
MCKENZIE: What happened in the forest with your followers? 
 
MACKENZIE: I can't tell nothing about that because I've been in custody for two months. So, I don't know what is going outside there. Have you been 
 
 there? 
 
MCKENZIE: The people, before you were in custody, people were starving and there are allegations that people were killing their children. 
 
MACKENZIE: But I've never seen anybody starving, even killing his or her children.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
MCKENZIE: A flat denial from the pastor, but he faces, of course, very serious allegations. They're holding him and some of his colleagues in 
 
 detention for several more days, and you could expect that that detention will continue as they try to piece together these awful details, Zain.
 <br>[12:15:00]
 
ASHER: The story is simply horrific, David. We know that the death toll at this point stands at roughly around 249 people who died as a result of this 
 
 particular cult. Do we expect that number to rise? 
 
MCKENZIE: We do, unfortunately, and there is an affidavit that was released by the inspectors today to support them, remaining -- the pastor and others 
 
 -- to remain in custody that says there are at least ten more mass graves at the site of this forest. Now, they were separated into different 
 
 communities, according to this affidavit, and witnesses who have been speaking to the press and others we have spoken to, they lived in these 
 
 communities within that forest, there were enforcers of some kind that were loyal to the pastor. 
 
He was present, allegedly, at some of the deaths and burials of his own supporters as they starved themselves to death. Now, if you consider how 
 
 many sets of remains have been already exhumed by the pathologists and the forensic teams, and if there are ten more mass graves, we could be looking 
 
 at an even more catastrophic death toll. And this place is -- this particular incident of this suicide death cult as one of the worst of its 
 
 kind globally in recent memory. Zain.
 
ASHER: Incredibly sad for the family members that are involved. David McKenzie, live for us there. Thank you so much. All right, still to come 
 
 here on One World, Mexican authorities are investigating the disappearance of seven missing people from a call center after human remains were 
 
 discovered. Plus, a drug intended for weight loss may have a promising side effect for those struggling with addiction more broadly. We'll have details 
 
 coming up next. I
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ASHER: Users of the prescription drug Ozempic are noticing a curious side effect. Some taking it and similar medications for weight loss say it also 
 
 helps them curb addictive behaviors like, for example, smoking, drinking, and vaping. Researchers say there's a lot of overlap in the mechanisms that 
 
 regulate addictive behaviors. In general, Meg Tirrell has the story. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE))
 
MEG TIRRELL, CNBC SENIOR HEALTH AND SCIENCE REPORTER: These days, Cheri Ferguson has swapped her vape pen for an Ozempic pen. 
 <br>[12:20:00]
 
CHERI FERGUSON, OZEMPIC PATIENT: I thought, I'm not enjoying vaping, so I may as well just put this into the battery bin at work, and I'll see how 
 
 long I can go without it. And that was 54 days ago. 
 
TIRRELL: Ferguson started using Ozempic 11 weeks ago to combat weight gained during the pandemic that she says was increasing her risk of 
 
 diabetes. A smoker for much of her life, Ferguson switched to vaping last July. But after starting Ozempic, she says something changed. 
 
FERGUSON: It's like someone's just come along and switched a light on and you can see the room for what it is and all of these vapes and cigarettes 
 
 that you've had over the years, they just don't look attractive anymore. It's very, very strange, very strange. 
 
TIRRELL: Ferguson is one of many patients taking drugs like Ozempic for weight loss who say they've also lost interest in some addictive behaviors. 
 
 Doctors told CNN that patients most commonly report an effect on alcohol use. It may be because these drugs in a class known as GLP-1s have an 
 
 effect not just in the gut but also in the brain. It's something being studied at the National Institutes of Health where researchers just 
 
 published a paper showing Semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic, reduced what they called binge-like alcohol drinking in rodents. 
 
LORENZO LEGGIO, DOCTOR OF MEDICINE, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HEALTH RESEARCHER: We believe that at least one of the mechanisms how these drugs 
 
 reduce alcohol drinking is by reducing the rewarding effects of alcohol, such as those related to a neurotransmitter in our brain, which is 
 
 dopamine. So, these medications are likely to make alcohol less rewarding. 
 
TIRRELL: And it's not just alcohol and nicotine. Patients have even told the Atlantic it had effects on behaviors like nail-biting and online 
 
 shopping. 
 
LEGGIO: There is a lot of overlap on the neurobiological mechanism that regulates addictive behaviors in general. So, it's possible that 
 
 medications like Semaglutide, by acting on this specific mechanism in the brain, they may help people with a variety of addictive behaviors. 
 
TIRRELL: Clinical trials in humans are needed to prove that. One set is underway at the University of North Carolina, looking at Semaglutide's 
 
 effect on alcohol and tobacco use. Cheri Ferguson says Ozempic has helped her lose 38 pounds. Even better, she says, is how it's made her feel. 
 
FERGUSON: The weight that it takes off your mind is far greater than any pounds that can come off your body. 
 
TIRRELL: We reached out to the maker of Ozempic, Novo Nordisk, as well as Eli Lilly, which makes a similar medicine. Both companies said right now 
 
 they're not running trials of their drugs for addiction. This traditionally hasn't been a market that's been appealing to pharmaceutical companies 
 
 because drugs really haven't been successful in selling well, although doctors emphasize there is a huge unmet medical need here. Alcohol use 
 
 disorder affects almost 30 million Americans and only 5% currently receive treatment. So, researchers are hoping that perhaps these promising early 
 
 results will draw more interest into the field. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ASHER: Dr. Jenna Tronieri is an Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania. She joins us live now. I'm so excited to speak 
 
 to you because you're actually about to launch a study on whether or not drugs like Ozempic can actually be used to curb addictive behaviors. 
 
 Obviously, the study hasn't come out yet. It hasn't been launched yet. So, we are awaiting results on that. However, in the meantime, the evidence at 
 
 this point is purely anecdotal. But what is the likelihood, do you think, based on your knowledge so far, that something like a Ozempic will one day, 
 
 perhaps be used to treat other addictive behaviors, especially just in terms of being an off-label drug for some of these addictive behaviors? 
 
JENA TRONIERI, ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF PSYCHIATRY, UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA: Yeah, I think that that's a really important question. And 
 
 so, we are seeing that this medication is sort of like the clips that you were just saying. It has actions in the gut, and that's one of the reasons 
 
 it helps with curbing hunger, appetite, et cetera. But also, it does cross the blood-brain barrier and has action or receptor sites in the brain and 
 
 parts of the brain associated with reward that are the same parts of the brain that are associated with reward from other types of behavior like 
 
 alcohol or cigarette smoking or other kinds of addictive behavior. 
 
So, right now we just have clinical evidence anecdotal from our patients saying that, you know, I have not really been interested in alcohol as much 
 
 as prior to starting this medication. And I think it's important to build on that with clinical trials. 
 
ASHER: I mean, this is fascinating. So, about 15 million Americans struggle with alcoholism in some form or another. Many of those people don't 
 
 actually receive any treatment. Some people resort to AA, which has been very, very effective for a lot of people. 
 <br>[12:25:00]
 
What is the likelihood that this drug, if it is approved in terms of off- label usage, what is the likelihood that this drug could really be a game changer in terms of offering people who struggle with alcoholism a medical 
 
 alternative? 
 
TRONIERI: Yeah, we do see, I mean, similar to weight loss, actually, that there have not been many very effective medications on the market for the 
 
 treatment of those kinds of alcohol use disorders and other disorders. So, I think that having an alternative that produces a number of different 
 
 benefits, one of which might be in the addictive spec really powerful. And if it's something that has a good safety profile, as these medications seem 
 
 to thus far really be a game changer as opposed to some of the medications that may have more significant side effects that are harder to tolerate. 
 
ASHER: So, why were the drug companies, why are they reluctant I should say to actually study this? I mean, you think about just the number of drugs 
 
 out there that are used for off-label purposes. I mean the first one that comes to mind, there are so many obviously, the first one comes to my mind 
 
 is Metformin which is traditionally used to treat blood sugar levels but has been used to treat other things like even cancer. What would be the 
 
 downside? Obviously, it is a time and financial investment for them, but why not study this? 
 
TRONIERI: Yeah, I don't know if it's reluctance as of yet or if it's that these medications are newer. So, one of the studies that I'm running right 
 
 now, which is focused more on the appetite effects of this medication, that was in the first round of investigator initiated studies for Semaglutide. 
 
And so, I think that, you know, sort of their first targeting studies that are related to the purposes for which they intended to develop and 
 
 prescribe these medications. But I'm not sure if later they might entertain proposals that are for different kinds of applications. And what we see, 
 
 like you're mentioning with Metformin, is that doctors on their own can sort of try those things faster throughout label use versus the slow and 
 
 gradual process of clinical trials. 
 
ASHER: There's one more question that I have for you before I let you go, and that is I think the first thing that came to my mind is, aside from 
 
 obviously the risks, there's obviously risks to everything these days. But I'm worried about whether or not these people would end up being dependent 
 
 on this drug. So, for example, if you take this drug and it curbs an addiction, when you stop taking the drug, does the addiction then come back 
 
 and are you replacing one dependency for another essentially? 
 
TRONIERI: That's a very interesting way of framing that question. I think that one of the things we do know about these medications for weight loss 
 
 or for diabetes control is that they are intended to be prescribed the same way blood pressure medications are prescribed. They're prescribed to bring 
 
 down in this case, blood glucose or body weight, but then also to maintain it there with the expectation that if someone stops taking the medication, 
 
 there will be some gradual rebound over time. 
 
And so, I think a really important target the board is going to be how to better maintain these kinds of effects, either through behavioral 
 
 mechanisms, reduce dosing regimens. I mean, there's just a lot we could try to see what the best maintenance protocol is going to be for individuals 
 
 that have benefited from these medications, regardless of the presenting problem. 
 
ASHER: Yeah, there was actually a drug, Antabuse, which worked to curb alcoholism by making the effects of alcohol really awful for people. But 
 
 doctors found that if people wanted to drink, they just stopped taking the drug. So, that's another issue, as well. All right. Dr. Jenna Tronieri, 
 
 thank you so much for being with us. We appreciate it. 
 
All right, still to come, Doctors Without Borders is warning about a looming health catastrophe in some of the refugee camps in Kenya. We'll 
 
 speak to a member of the humanitarian group about the situation next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:30:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ASHER: Hello and welcome back to One World. Let's catch up on the headlines. U.S. and Saudi Arabian efforts to bring peace and humanitarian 
 
 aid to Sudan are not working. The two countries say they have suspended the talks that were going on in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, because the two warring 
 
 factions in Sudan are completely ignoring the ceasefire that they had agreed to. 
 
A New Mexico judge has approved a settlement in a lawsuit filed by the family of the cinematographer killed on the set of an Alec Baldwin movie. 
 
 Halyna Hutchins died when a live round was fired at her by Baldwin from a gun he thought had only blanks. Details of the settlement have not been 
 
 revealed, but it sets up payments to Hutchins' son when he's an adult. 
 
Prosecutors in Mexico believe police have found the human remains of seven workers from a call center. Forty-five bags containing body parts were 
 
 discovered in a ravine near Guadalajara. The seven call center workers were reported missing late last month. 
 
Patrick Oppmann joins us live now from Havana. I mean, crimes of disappearance can be common sometimes in Mexico. Just walk us through what 
 
 more we know at this point.
 
PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: They are all too common but rarely this grisly. What happened, as you said, people were going to call center 
 
 according to their family members. Sort of a regular day of work when they just stopped responding to messages and phone calls or their phones were 
 
 going to voicemail, family members said. And immediately family members knew something was a matter that everyone who worked at this call center, 
 
 these seven people, would have just gone missing, was too bizarre, and obviously seemed tied to some sort of violent gang activity. 
 
And they began to march to protest and call on officials to do more. And then this week, this terrible discovery, bags and bags of body parts found 
 
 in a ravine on the outskirts of Guadalajara in a sort of near a suburb, we're told, in this very steep ravine, someone hastily disposing of these 
 
 bodies. 
 
And officials saying that it appears that the two cases are connected, that the people found in these bags as they continue to analyze them apparently 
 
 were at least some of the missing seven people from this call center, and officials going on to say that they believe this call center may have been 
 
 used for some kind of illegal activity, a real estate fraud or some kind. 
 
Family members have not responded to that as far as we know at this point. But of course, even though, Zain, that this has generated a lot more 
 
 attention just because of the high profile and the horrific discovery of these bags in this ravine, there are no guarantees that it will generate 
 
 justice or any answers here, because as you said, all too often this kind of thing happens in Mexico and the culprits are not brought to justice. 
 
ASHER: All right, Patrick Oppmann, live for us there. Thank you so much. 
 <br>[12:35:00]
 
A deadly disease is threatening some refugee camps in Kenya. Doctors Without Borders or Medecins Sans Frontieres say a cholera outbreak has 
 
 impacted more than 2700 people in the three camps that make up the Dadaab Complex in northeast Kenya. One doctor says it's just a matter of time 
 
 before other epidemics erupt in the camps, which are home to more than 300,000 refugees, mostly from neighboring Somalia. 
 
The recent drought in Somalia has burdened even more people. MSF is calling for immediate action to address the overcrowding and the unsanitary 
 
 conditions in the camp. The medical humanitarian group says it needs clean water, it needs soap, more bathrooms, and more waste management. 
 
Time now for the Exchange, and for more on this looming health catastrophe, let's bring in Abigael Lukhwaro, the Advocacy Manager for Medecins Sans 
 
 Frontieres. She joins us live now from Nairobi. Abigael, thank you so much for being with us. 
 
So, 300,000 people overcrowding in this camp is clear at this point in time. Obviously, you've got so many more refugees coming in, places like 
 
 Somalia, as well. Just explain to us what is needed at this point in time to ensure sanitary conditions in and around this camp. 
 
ABIGAEL LUKHWARO, ADVOCACY MANAGER, MEDECINS SANS FRONTIERES: Yes, thank you. Thank you for the opportunity. So, as you have correctly mentioned, we 
 
 have more and more new arrivals from Somalia coming to Dadaab refugee camps and causing a lot of overcrowding in the camps, which has been a hazard 
 
 that has caused the spread of diseases like measles and cholera. 
 
So, currently, we are looking at a situation whereby the camp is hosting more than three times what it should be hosting. Therefore, decongesting 
 
 the camp is something we are calling upon urgently to decongest the camps so that it doesn't put pressure on the limited resources already -- that 
 
 are already in the camps. 
 
The refugees are living with very low levels of access to clean water, access to sufficient latrines and toilets. So, if we can have at least a 
 
 part of the population move to the camp that the government of Kenya has opened, it will ease this congestion and at least ease the pressure on the 
 
 resources within the camps. 
 
ASHER: So, at this point in time, is there an effort being made right now for those accommodations? As you just mentioned, people need to be moved 
 
 elsewhere. Clearly, decongesting the camp is a priority. Plus, there needs to be more bathrooms, more latrines, better water, clean water, basically. 
 
 Is there an effort being made for those accommodations right now? 
 
LUKHWARO: Yes, there's an effort that is being made currently because the government of Kenya had gazetted reopening of two camps that they had 
 
 closed earlier. So, there is -- plans underway to open at least one more additional camp to ease the congestion in the three camps. 
 
ASHER: So, what's unique about this particular outbreak, this particular cholera outbreak, is how long it's lasted. I mean, it's gone on for about 
 
 six months or so. Why is that? Just explain that to us, because that is quite rare. 
 
LUKHWARO: Yes, that is quite rare. And that's why we are concerned that the medicines and frontiers, because we are seeing the longest cholera outbreak 
 
 in the past five years. And we are seeing the cholera is affecting a lot more people compared to the previous outbreaks. 
 
So, as we speak right now, the camp that we work in at MSF, that is the Dagahale Camp, that makes part of the three camps that make Dadaab Camp, we 
 
 are seeing, we've seen more than 1100 people since the outbreak, which is very high. The highest number we've seen in the past is about 600 people 
 
 only in an outbreak. And we've not seen this kind of an outbreak that you've had six months heading to seven continuously with cases of cholera, 
 
 yes. 
 
ASHER: That there are cholera vaccinations taking place, as I understand it, and that might prevent future outbreaks or rather not future outbreaks, 
 
 but people suffering with future outbreaks. But it doesn't do enough to actually curb what's happening right now. What are you concerned about just 
 
 in terms of other epidemics spreading in this kind of environment? 
 
LUKHWARO: We are concerned with other epidemics spreading and also we are concerned about controlling this cholera outbreak because we've seen there 
 
 was a lot of efforts to conduct the vaccination for cholera. It was the first time, in fact, it's a big milestone for Kenya, having the first OCD 
 
 in this country. And the refugee camps were prioritized, of course. We, the vaccination had assisted to some extent to reduce the infection rates. But 
 
 because of the sanitary conditions, these vaccines need to be accompanied by improved standards of water and sanitation. So, therefore, we've seen -- 
 
 we are not able to contain the outbreak despite the vaccination. The water and sanitation components are not scaled up. 
 
ASHER: All right, Abigael Lukhwaro, thank you so much, appreciate you sharing what's happening on the ground there. All right, still to come here 
 
 on One World CNN joins divers and researchers in the Red Sea as an entire species practically disappears overnight, threatening the balance of life 
 
 in its unique coral reefs. That story next.

ASHER: All right, take a look at this dramatic video out of Egypt. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ASHER: It shows a large sandstorm sweeping across the Suez Canal area on Thursday. Other parts of Egypt were also hit by clouds and dust of sand. At 
 
 least one person was killed, and several others were injured in the powerful winds that downed trees and downed billboards, as well. While 
 
 sandstorms are common in Egypt, storms of this magnitude are rather rare. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ASHER: One of the world's most delicate ecosystems is in danger. Scientists say the coral reefs of the Red Sea are under threat after nearly all the 
 
 black sea urchins died off in just a matter of days. CNN's Hadas Gold has more. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN INTERNATIONAL REPORTER: The pristine waters of the Gulf of Aqaba in the Red Sea, reefs teeming with colorful fish. But something is 
 
 missing and it's threatening this entire ecosystem. 
 
UNKNOWN: In a very short time, we experienced a massive catastrophe of fail, talking about losing a species that used to live there forever. 
 
GOLD: In January, black sea urchins here started dying en masse. Within days, entire populations of thousands were getting sick and literally 
 
 disappearing. 
 
OMRI BRONSTEIN, FACULTY OF LIFE SCIENCE, TEL AVIV UNIVERSITY: We've never seen any fluctuations on that magnitude. And now to say that sea urchins 
 
 were completely gone, that whatever is killing them is still defined as a waterborne pathogen. We know that it is transmitted through the water. You 
 
 don't need direct contact. It takes 48 hours for an individual to go from a live, healthy individual to basically bare skeleton. 
 
GOLD: Vital to keep the delicate balance of life here, these urchins consume the algae that control reefs already stressed by human activity and 
 
 the effects of climate change. Dr. Bronstein and his team of researchers from Tel Aviv University show us how the beauty and health of the reefs are 
 
 under attack. We do not spot a single black sea urchin.
 
BRONSTEIN: The thought that we might be seeing something that is going to be radically changed is simply a very sad thought. 
 <br>[12:45:00]
 
And it is probably the most unique coral reef in the world. It is our responsibility to make sure that they will remain here for future 
 
 generations.
 
GOLD: And it is probably the most unique coral reef in the world. It is our responsibility to make sure that they will remain here for future 
 
 generations. This coral reef is unique in the world because of its ability to withstand high temperatures, making it more resistant to the effects of 
 
 climate change. And that's why this reef is so ecologically important to the globe. 
 
These tanks at the Inter-University Institute for Marine Sciences in Eilat, Israel were once filled with the jet black urchins. Now, they are covered 
 
 in algae, a small-scale example of what scientists say is happening in the sea. 
 
BRONSTEIN: Without external regulation that the sea urchins provide, corals will not really stand a chance in this competition with algae because the 
 
 great -- the growth rate of algae is -- or the magnitutude is higher than those of corals.
 
GOLD: Only a few have survived this epidemic, like this young juvenile. He seems rather lonely.
 
BRONSTEIN: Oh yes, a few individuals, even when they survive, that's not enough to sustain a population. 
 
GOLD: A similar pathogen wiped the urchins out of the Caribbean in the 1980s and reared its head again last year. Dr. Bronstein said it's likely 
 
 spread by ships and possibly helped along by climate change. And it's spreading. Researchers are using DNA technology to make a difference. 
 
LISA-MARIA SCHMIDT, RESERCHER, TEL AVIV UNIVERSITY: So, basically just establishing a new monitoring method, a high throughput, and non-evasive 
 
 one. It's allowing us to follow processes in the water of different species. So, in a way, you're trying to predict the future. More or less, 
 
 yeah, without going to the water, yeah. 
 
GOLD: But the time to save these Black Sea urchins is running out, Dr. Bronstein says governments need to move within weeks. 
 
BRONSTEIN: And decision-makers need to understand that the window of opportunity to take action is very, very narrow and closing rapidly. If we 
 
 don't take extra care about what we pump into this environment, we may find ourselves in a huge problem, in a huge situation. 
 
GOLD: Israel shares this Gulf and this problem with Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, which you can see just behind me, and with which Israel has no 
 
 official relations. But under the water, there are no boundaries and no politics, and international cooperation will be a key to fixing this 
 
 problem. 
 
These fragile reefs, where everything plays its part in the cycle, desperately waiting for help. Hadas Gold, CNN, Eilat Israel.

ASHER: All right, still to come here on One World, pride under pressure. Strict new laws in Florida are affecting many celebrations of diversity in 
 
 the state. We've got reaction after the break. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:50:00]
 
ASHER: June marks Pride Month in many parts of the world. It's a time dedicated to celebrating the LGBTQ community. But in Florida, some events 
 
 are being scaled back or canceled because of a new state law targeting drag performances. CNN's Victor Blackwell reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOAPE)
 
VICTOR BLACKWELL, CNN CORRESPONENT: Pride across Florida will be noticeably less colorful this year. Festival organizers are making significant changes 
 
 or canceling altogether some LGBTQ plus celebrations. They fear potential consequences from Governor Ron DeSantis' new law that many believe targets 
 
 public drag performances, a mainstay of pride events. 
 
UNKNOWN: Welcome. welcome to St. Cloud's first pride event. 
 
KRISTINA BOZANICH, COORDINATOR OF PRIDE IN ST. CLOUD: It's very disheartening. 
 
BLACKWELL: Kristina Bozanich, Coordinator of Pride in St. Cloud, canceled the Orlando area event that was planning to include drag performers. 
 
BLACKWELL: According to the new law signed by DeSantis just weeks ago, local governments are banned from issuing public permits for events that 
 
 include some adult live performances. Venues risk steep fines and losing licensing if a child is present, knowingly admitting a child would be a 
 
 first-degree misdemeanor. 
 
BOZANICH: Once the bill was signed, I said. we can restructure the event. We'll make sure it's only 18 and up for that portion. They went and talked 
 
 with all the performers and came back to me and said, we're really sorry, but we just don't feel safe. 
 
BLACKWELL: Organizers in Port St. Lucy canceled its annual Pride parade. They reached an agreement with the city to host a slimmed down festival. 
 
 Drag performers were welcome, but anyone under 21 was not. 
 
UNKNOWN: I was in the closet for so many years and I still face hatred and oppression and I can't even go to my own Pride fest. 
 
BLACKWELL: Kissimmee Pride is on, but drag, indoors only. 
 
STEPHANIE BECHARA, COMMUNICATIONS AND PUBLIC AFFAIRS MANAGER, CITY OF KISSIMMEE: For example, drag bingo will be taking place inside of our civic 
 
 center and it will be an event where we will be requiring IDs and we're also asking folks to go ahead and pre-register online to participate. 
 
BLACKWELL: John Paonessa's Orlando restaurant, Hamburger Mary's, hosts drag shows most nights. He's filed a federal lawsuit against the state. He 
 
 claims he's losing business because of the new law. DeSantis' office has not responded to a CNN request for comment on the lawsuit. 
 
JOHN PAONESSA, OWNER, HAMBURGER MARY'S: We have a street party with a stage with the performers out front during Pride. We usually get three or 4000 
 
 people on the street watching. That's something we can't do. 
 
BLACKWELL: At the start of a month that's in part a celebration of visibility, some feel that the Sunshine State is shoving them back into 
 
 darkness. 
 
PAONESSA: Now, with the governor stepping in and the legislation that's going through, it's -- we're moving back in time. And it's unfortunate for 
 
 us and everybody else in this state because what they're doing, it's heartbreaking. 
 
BLACKWELL: And these are the beginnings of gay days here in central Florida. More than 150,000 people are expected to come here from around the 
 
 world to celebrate Pride. They'll be at the major theme parks wearing red shirts to be seen.
 
In a statement from the CEO of Gay Days. He says that they are working with their hotels and different venues to make sure that they don't run afoul of 
 
 the new law. However, according to the website, there is a drag queen bingo event that is advertised as open to all ages, so we'll see how they 
 
 navigate that. They've also invited Governor DeSantis to the event. It's unlikely he will attend. Victor Blackwell, CNN, Orlando.

ASHER: All right, now to an update on that dramatic rescue we told you about from the top of Mount Everest. The guide who carried a struggling 
 
 climber down from the part of Everest known as the Death Zone says too many people come to the mountain without enough experience or training. There 
 
 have been at least 12 deaths on Everest this climbing season, and the Gelje Sherpa says no one else was helping the Malaysian man. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GELJE SHERPA, MT. EVEREST GUIDE: It was like massive difficult because I did like more than like 55 rescues. But it was very like hard rescue in my 
 
 life. I did like long line of normal rescues, everything. But this, it was just like very hard rescue, like very hard to do, like rescue like above 
 
 the dead chills. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[12:55:00]
 
ASHER: It took the Gelje Sherpa six hours in temperatures of minus 30 degrees Celsius to carry the Malaysian climber down to an altitude where he 
 
 can be helicoptered to safety. 
 
The biggest collection of ancient bronze statues ever found in Italy is going on display this month, but it wouldn't have happened without the keen 
 
 eye of a retired garbageman. Stefano Petrini remembered seeing bits of Roman columns in his friend's garden in the southern Tuscany. He tipped off 
 
 local archaeologists who found the statues. Among the treasures unearthed, a statue of a boy who apparently had a bone disease and a 2000-year-old 
 
 lock of curly hair. 
 
Mars is making its streaming debut. The European Space Agency is set to stream images on YouTube directly from the red planet. While it's not truly 
 
 live, new images will refresh every 50 seconds. This event is in honor of the 20th anniversary of the launch of ESA's Mars Express, which took three-
 
 dimensional images of Mars' surface. The stream will go live at 6 PM in the evening, central European time or noon Eastern time on Friday.
