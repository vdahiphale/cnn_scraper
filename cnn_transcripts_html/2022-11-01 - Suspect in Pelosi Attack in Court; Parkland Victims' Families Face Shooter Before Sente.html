ERICA HILL, CNN ANCHOR: Good Tuesday morning. I'm Erica Hill. We're watching a number of developing stories at this hour. 
 
Happening right now, an emotional hearing set to begin in Florida where survivors and families of the Parkland school shooting will share their stories and their pain in court. This is all in advance to the judge sentencing the gunman to life in prison. We are live this morning in Florida.
 
It is also, of course, the final countdown now. We are one week from Election Day. Early voting, as you likely know, is already smashing records. More than 21 million ballots cast so far. But that, of course, is not all the voters. So the campaigning far from over. Candidates out there making their final pitch. And CNN is on the trail. 
 
The man accused of attacking House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband Paul in their San Francisco home is expected in court this morning. Forty- two-year-old David DePape will be arraigned on several charges, including attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon. Today's hearing comes as we're also learning disturbing new details about DePape's intentions. The FBI says he planned to hold House Speaker Nancy Pelosi hostage and, quote, break her kneecaps if she lied. Now the speaker was not home at the time of the attack.
 
CNN correspondent Veronica Miracle is live outside the courthouse in San Francisco. 
 
There was a lot of detail, Veronica, in this affidavit. 
 
VERONICA MIRACLE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: So much came out yesterday, Erica, and authorities revealing some of the most chilling details yet. They say that David DePape came here specifically to the Pelosi residence so that he could kidnap and injury her, and that he admitted this to the San Francisco Police Department even after being read his Miranda rights. 
 
Now, in that affidavit filed in court yesterday, they say that David DePape wanted to break Nancy Pelosi's kneecaps so that she would have to be wheeled in front of the - in front of Congress so that other members could see the consequences of their actions. He described her as a leader of a pack of lies promoted by the Democratic Party. 
 
Now, DePape is going to be arraigned later today on numerous state charges, including attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon. And that is according to San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins. She says that this was a politically motivated attack. Here's what she had to say yesterday. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BROOKE JENKINS, SAN FRANCISCO DISTRICT ATTORNEY: Yes, it appears as though this was, based on his statements and comments that were made in that house during his encounter with Mr. Pelosi, that this was politically motivated. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MIRACLE: Now, between the state charges, DePape faces 13 years to life. And that does not include the federal charges that DePape is facing for assault and attempted kidnapping. And if he is convicted on those two charges, he faces a maximum of 50 years in prison. 
 
Now, Paul Pelosi is still recovering in a local hospital from his injuries, including a skull fracture. And according to authorities, when police arrived, they saw DePape and Pelosi struggling over a hammer and that DePape was able to get control of that hammer and they witnessed him knock Pelosi unconscious to the ground. When police were able to get DePape under control, they found a second hammer, duct tape, zip ties and gloves and other items.
 
Erica.
 
HILL: Yes, a lot in there, Veronica. Appreciate it. Thank you. 
 
In Florida this hour the sentencing hearing is set to begin for the convicted Parkland school shooter. Before the judge hands down his life sentence, he'll have to listen to what survivors and victims' families have to say. 
 
CNN correspondent Carlos Suarez is in Broward County, Florida.
 
So, this sentencing hearing, Carlos, is expected to last two days. The families can also say a lot more than they could during their victim impact statements. 
 
CARLOS SUAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's exactly right, Erica. Any minute now we're going to start to hear from the families of the 17 victims that died in that shooting, as well as the survivors. Now, unlike their earlier statements during the sentencing trial, the ones that were made in front of a jury, well, the families, they're going to be able to say what they want. They're going to be able to address Nikolas Cruz directly in court. They're going to be able to tell him how they feel about - tell him, rather, how they feel about him, as well as the sentence they believe that he should have received here. Throughout this case, the families, they have all been pretty clear
 
 about their feelings surrounding the death penalty. Nearly all of them wanted to see Nikolas Cruz die for his actions in Parkland, Florida, back in 2018. 
 
Now, during the trial, the families, they were able to deliver impact statements before the jury, but those statements were really tailored. 
 <br>[09:05:06]
 
They could only talk about their loss and their grief. They could not address Nikolas Cruz directly in court and they could not say what they wish his fate would be. 
 
The judge, as you said, has set aside a considerable amount of time for what is expected to be an emotional two days here at the Broward County Courthouse. Nikolas Cruz, he is going to be in court as well. He is not expected to address the families or the judge in this. Again, any minute now we're expected to start - we're expected to hear, rather, from some of the family members that are going to share just some of their raw emotions in all of that. After the verdict came back, after the jury held out on a death sentence on all 17 counts. The jury was quite - rather the families were quite upset at the jury saying that they should have come back with the death penalty. The judge, she's expected to formally sentence Nikolas Cruz to die without the possibility of parole once the families' statements wrap up. 
 
Erica.
 
HILL: Carlos Suarez, appreciate it. Thank you.
 
And I had the chance to speak with one of the parents who will have his opportunity to speak today. Stay with us kin the next hour. You'll hear my conversation with Tony Montalto, whose daughter Gina was killed at Parkland.
 
All right, I know you've been counting down, the Advent calendar. You've got one week left until election days. The candidates, their surrogates, going all out right now on the campaign trail, possibly on the ads where you live on your TV. You're going to see several big names out on the trail. 
 
Former Vice President Mike Pence is in Georgia, President Biden headed to Florida, a state his advisers have long eyed as the ideal backdrop for his warnings against, quote, mega MAGA Republicans. Former President Obama in Nevada. He'll actually join Biden Saturday to campaign in Pennsylvania. 
 
CNN's chief congressional correspondent Manu Raju is in Las Vegas this morning. 
 
So, Manu, we're seeing a little more from the Democrats as they're prioritizing here in this final week. Talk to me about Nevada and what the sense is in that state. 
 
MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, this is such a significant race. Catherine Cortez Masto, she is the incumbent Democratic senator. She's only been in Congress for one term. So, finishing up her six-year term. She is in a dead heat with the Republican, former attorney general here in this state, Adam Laxalt. Someone who is the grandson of the former governor here in this state. Someone who has a name -- well-recognized name. 
 
But both candidates not particularly well-defined among voters, which is why we have seen an enormous amount of ads spent over the last two months. In fact, since Labor Day alone, more than $100 million has been spent in Nevada on the airways. Democrats spending a little bit more than Republicans. But we have seen familiar themes play out along the airwaves. Democrats getting hit over the issues of inflation, the economy, high gas prices. That's what Catherine Cortez Masto has had to face in the attacks that have come against her. She has levied her own attacks against Laxalt over issues such as abortion and concerns over the Republicans pushing for a ban on abortion in the aftermath of the supreme court's decision overturning Roe v. Wade.
 
So, Barack Obama is here today in Las Vegas. He plans to try to rally Democratic voters, try to juice Democratic turn-out as he heads to a number of key states as the fight for the Senate remains on the knife's edge. Not just in here, but in states like Wisconsin, Georgia, Pennsylvania, even Arizona, very close as we get into the final days, which is what Democrats hope, they can turn out their voters, persuade those voters who have not yet made a decision yet and perhaps hang on to the Senate as it looks increasingly grim, their chances about holding the House. If they can keep the House. Now the focus big time on the Senate and this race here in Nevada. 
 
Erica.
 
HILL: Yes, definitely a big, big push for the Senate by Democrats. 
 
Manu, appreciate it. Thank you.
 
Let's take a closer look at this midterm crunch. 
 
Ashley Allison, former national coalitions director for the Biden/Harris campaign, and CNN political commentator S.E. Cupp both with me this morning. 
 
So, as we see this push, you know, as Manu just laid out, there are a number of states where this -- the battle for the Senate really is, in Manu's words, on a knife's edge. Georgia is one of them. 
 
I was struck by a response that we just heard from Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, who, of course, is running in his state. He sat down with Kaitlan Collins. She asked him specifically about Herschel Walker, who, of course, is running for Senate in Georgia. Take a listen to his answer. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOV. BRIAN KEMP (R-GA): I would just tell you to talk to Herschel Walker about his policies on abortion. I am staying focused on my race and what I can control in trying to help them fight through Joe Biden's inflation. Eggs up 30 percent. Milk, chicken up 15 percent, 17 percent. Gas prices because of bad domestic energy policy. That's the number one issue. Sixty percent of Americans right now are living paycheck to paycheck. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HILL: He seems that he's really trying to distance himself, S.E., from -- S.E. Cupp. We also know that Mike Pence is headed to Georgia to campaign with Kemp but not with Walker. 
 <br>[09:10:03]
 
Could this be a split in the state? 
 
S.E. CUPP, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: It could. I bet - I bet Brian Kemp wishes Herschel Walker would talk mostly about milk prices and chicken prices and gas prices because I think - I think Republicans would have a lock on the state. 
 
But, listen, Herschel Walker is up still according to most polls that I've looked at. And it seems as though Republicans are -- have decided already. There's a week left and I don't expect much to change. 
 
But, listen, I spoke to some Republicans over the weekend. And these aren't MAGA Republicans. They're, you know, ordinary Republicans. And we talked about some of the issues that have them voting "R" down the ticket. And I said, well, what about, you know, threats to democracy, election denialism, like, right-wing extremism. They said, yes, that's bad, but not as bad as gas prices and inflation. And so those aren't cooky (ph) priorities and I think a lot of Republicans, including in Georgia, have just decided that's more important.
 
HILL: As they look at that. 
 
In Pennsylvania, as we look at the Senate race there, also getting so much attention. You know, John Fetterman talking with our Don Lemon, and he was asked specifically about those calls for more transparency when it comes to his recovery. 
 
Let's listen to that exchange. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR: In the interest of full transparency for the voters, do you think it would help if you let your doctors brief the press before election night? 
 
JOHN FETTERMAN (D), PENNSYLVANIA SENATE CANDIDATE: I think we've been pretty transparent. You know, we've - we've had our doctors just be very clear that - that they're here - that we're able to - and fit to - to - to serve. And, from my point, you know, we've been also been very transparent in terms of showing up at a debate and very transparent about, you know, having events in front of thousands and thousands of Pennsylvanians for months. 
 
LEMON: Hey, listen, I'm asking the question for the voters, because then voters may ask - may wonder, is there a reason that you don't want your doctors to take questions? That's why I keep asking.
 
FETTERMAN: Oh, I just -- I just believe that we have our doctors just weigh in on that and - and they believe that I'm fit - fit to serve. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HILL: So "The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette," Ashley, actually endorsed Oz citing Fetterman's transparency about his health. Do you think that that answer to Don did enough to satisfy voters who may still have some questions? This race is, you know, pretty tight. CNN's poll of polls, Fetterman maintains a lead, but it's slim. 
 
ASHLEY ALLISON, FORMER NATIONAL COALITIONS DIRECTOR FOR BIDEN-HARRIS 2020: I do think that Pennsylvania voters know John Fetterman. He's their lieutenant governor now. He did a debate that was an hour long that took a great deal of stamina with a reasonable accommodation of captioning. 
 
And if you go and you talk to Pennsylvania voters and folks who are covering the race in state, people say they know him and that his doctor says he's fit to serve and that they are capable of making that decision. And that he's been transparent. And releasing the doctor's reports, I think it would just go down a rabbit hole of like, what about this and what about that. 
 
So, I think Fetterman is still going to win Pennsylvania. It's still razor tight. No one can take it for granted. It's going to be a turn- out game just not in Pennsylvania, but in other states across the country, which is why every race is so tight at this point and all the big guns are hitting the trail. 
 
HILL: You look at all those big guns and it's so interesting to see Liz Cheney out there for - she's pushing for Elissa Slotkin, as we - as we know. She also put up this attack ad, obviously, in Arizona. 
 
S.E., is she an effective surrogate? 
 
CUPP: I mean, this is remarkable, Erica. I know Liz Cheney and I know Elissa Slotkin. And she's - she's, you know, a Republican's Democrat, right? I mean she comes from defense world and she's -- she's pretty - she's pretty moderate. I like her a lot. 
 
But this is remarkable that one of the most conservative Republicans in Congress is, for the first time in her life, endorsing a Democrat and finding more common cause with a Democrat than most Republicans in her party. 
 
I think, for Elissa Slotkin voters, Liz Cheney probably is an effective surrogate and for a lot of Democrats who really think that democracy threats and election denialism are a hugely important issue, they stand with Liz Cheney. 
 
Now, will she turn out, you know, will she turn out MAGA Republicans? Will she turn out progressives? Probably not. But this pairing actually makes a lot of sense to me. 
 
HILL: Unfortunately, we're out of time. The good news is we have a whole week ahead of us, ladies. 
 
CUPP: Yes, we do.
 
HILL: So we've got more to talk about. Don't you worry.
 
Ashley, S.E., thank you both. 
 
HILL: Just ahead here, CNN has learned Iran is preparing to send about a thousand new weapons to Russia. So, what's in that shipment and what could it mean for Ukrainians? 
 
Plus, a new rule in New York could make it easier now for job seekers to narrow down their search.

And SpaceX sends its Falcon Heavy on another mission for the first time in three years. We're going to watch that lift-off this hour. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HILL: New reporting into CNN this morning.
 
Officials from a western nation tell CNN they believe Iran is preparing to send a huge new cache of weapons to Russia's war effort. That would include more attack drones and what is believed to be the first instance of Iran sending advanced, precision-guided missiles to Russia. A previous shipment has had deadly consequences, as we know, for Ukraine. 
 
CNN national security correspondent Kylie Atwood joins us now with the new reporting. 
 
So, is this a growing partnership at this point between Iran and Russia? 
 
KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that's what it looks like, Erica, right? So, our reporting is that, of course, Iran has already sent these drones to Russia that have been used, as you said, to deadly effect on the battlefield. 
 <br>[09:20:00]
 
But, according to these western officials that I spoke with, from a country that closely monitors Iran's weapons program, they say that Russia is preparing for a large shipment, about a thousand weapons. And it will include additional of those attack (ph) drones that we've already seen they (ph) use on the battlefield and these precision- guided missiles. Those are advanced weapons. 
 
And the concern here is just what those weapons would be able to do for Russia on the battlefield. They would be able to go after precise targets. They're also pretty hard to keep an eye on and track as they're coming into the country. And that's what Ukrainians are worried about, just the impact that these could have on the battlefield for them. 
 
Now, when it comes to what the United States is doing here, we have already heard U.S. officials say that they're concerned about additional Iranian shipments of weapons to Russia. And the secretary of state was very clear last week in saying that the United States is really trying to do everything that they can to prevent these further possible weapons from actually even getting to Russia, saying that the U.S. is trying to do everything that they can to break up these networks. Of course, these networks that are enabling these shipments to go ahead, the manufacturers of the weapons, the shippers of the weapons and the like. 
 
So, that's what we'll be watching for. Can the United States and its allies prevent these weapons from getting to Russia? But, of course, as we are reporting, these preparations are underway and it is extremely concerning in terms of what impact it could have on the battlefield. 
 
HILL: Yes, absolutely.
 
Kylie, great reporting. Appreciate it. Thank you. 
 
HILL: For the fifth time in less than four years, Israeli voters heading to the polls to try to end the nation's ongoing political deadlock. Voters will decide whether former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will return to office or if the current prime minister, Yair Lapid, will hang on to power.
 
Joining me live from Jerusalem, CNN's Hadas Gold.
 
So, Hadas, you actually spoke with Netanyahu today. Where's his head at right now in terms of this race? 
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT: Yes, well, Erica, we're standing outside of that Jerusalem polling station where Netanyahu cast his vote. You can see behind me all the posters of the different candidates trying to, at the last minute, convince voters before they get - go in to cast their ballot. Fifth time in over three and a half years. But for Benjamin Netanyahu, it was his first time in 13 years that he cast his ballot not as the sitting prime minister. Of course that's now new coalition leader, caretaker prime minister, Yair Lapid, in power.
 
But besides a referendum on Netanyahu, who, I should note, faces an ongoing corruption trial, whether he should come back into power or not.
 
The other thing that's at stake in this election is the rise of the far right of Israeli politics because Netanyahu, in order to form a governing coalition, will likely need to rely on the growing popularity of some far right groups, some of whom whose leaders have, in the past, been convicted for inciting racism and supporting terrorism. 
 
I asked Netanyahu about his need for the far-right support, an international concern about what that will mean for a future Israeli government. Take a listen to his answer. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, FORMER ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER: You don't want a government with the Muslim Brotherhood who support terrorism, deny the existence of Israel and are pretty hostile to the United States too. That's what we're going to bring.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLD: So, not exactly answering my question. He's referring to the coalition which right now, for the first time in Israeli history, has an Arab party sitting with them. 
 
Now, polls do show that the pro-Netanyahu bloc of parties are closer to that 61-seat majority that they will need to form a government majority. But a lot of polls show them just below that number. 
 
Of course, everything will come out to turn-out, especially when you have such razor-thin margin. And what's really interesting, today, Erica, is that turnout so far has been at the highest levels since 1999, even though this is the fifth time Israelis have gone to the polls in three and a half years. Clearly voter fatigue may not be as high as people thought.
 
Erica.
 
HILL: Yes, clearly not, if that's what you're seeing so far.
 
Hadas, appreciate it. Thank you. 
 
Supporters of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro blocking major roads and highways overnight protesting his recent election loss. The disruption caused major delays in at least 19 states across Brazil. Meantime, the country's supreme court ordered the federal highway police and military police immediately clear all public roads. Bolsonaro lost that close run-off election to leftist challenger Lula da Silva. Bolsonaro has not yet conceded. It's been more than a day now since those results were finalized. It's been reported that he'll address the nation today. No word, though, on what time that will happen, but we'll keep you posted. 
 
Still to come here, starting today employers in New York City have to be upfront about the salary when they post job openings. So, how could that help not only job seekers but current employees? And what's the impact on companies outside the city? 
 
Stay with us.

HILL: Just moments away now from the opening bell on Wall Street. October will go down as one of the best months ever on Wall Street, despite falling nearly 130 points yesterday, overall, stocks ended the month up 14 percent. That's the best monthly gain since January of 1976.
 
Well, starting today, a new law in New York could really change the way you look for a job.
