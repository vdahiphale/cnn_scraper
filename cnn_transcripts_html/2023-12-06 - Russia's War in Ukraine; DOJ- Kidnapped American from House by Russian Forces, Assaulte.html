PAULA REID, CNN SENIOR LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT:  ?And after his answers to questions he was getting from his captors failed to satisfy them, they threatened him with death and asked for his last words. I mean, truly terrifying. He was also asked -- forced to dig trenches for the Russian military. An extraordinary set of facts.
 
But the Attorney General noted at the outset of his remarks that while here this case is focused on an American, obviously, countless Ukrainian citizens face similar actions which is, again, it's horrifying. This is a historic case, though, the first time they're bringing these kinds of charges related to alleged war crimes against an American.
 
JOHN BERMAN, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  As you said, chilling accounts. New, fascinating legal action here. Paula Reid, thanks very much.
 
SARA SIDNER, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  All right. Coming up, new audio of former Israeli hostages confronting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a private meeting. Maybe now freed hostages are angry at the Israeli government, and they are showing that.
 
Plus. a controversial bankruptcy deal could give legal protections to the family behind the makers of Oxycontin. But what does it mean for the victims who dealt with the devastating public health crisis? We'll speak to one of them, ahead.

BERMAN:  New this morning, Israel has released new images saying its troops have found stockpiles of weapons, explosives, and long-range missiles in Northern Gaza near a clinic and even a school. Now, CNN is unable to independently verify the size of the stockpile or exactly where it was found. But U.S. officials are now talking about how long they believe this phase of the Israeli ground operation against Hamas will last. For several weeks, they say. Multiple sources tell CNN that the IDF will then shift to hyper-localized -- a hyper-localized strategy targeting Hamas.
 
CNN's Alex Marquardt is in Israel. Alex, tell us more about this timeline.
 
ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  Well, John, there are major questions about how much longer Israel can keep up this pace, this intense pace of operations that we saw throughout the efforts in Northern Gaza, now we see it expanding into Southern Gaza. So, what my colleagues and I are hearing from U.S. and Israeli officials is that they are expecting high intensity operations like the ones we're seeing right now.
 
And in fact, the IDF said just yesterday that yesterday was the most intense day of military operations they'd seen yet. They're expecting this high intensity phase, as they're calling it, to continue for several more weeks. And then, they say, the IDF is expected to switch to a lower intensity phase, if you will. One that would be a lot more localized, a lot more targeted, where the IDF would pull back, but would continue to carry out a counterterrorism operation, specific operations, for example against Hamas leadership.
 
The U. S. has been warning publicly and privately that essentially the support for Israel is running out with the increasing humanitarian catastrophe. They have said -- the U.S. has said that they really don't want to see Israel carry out the same kind of operation in Southern Gaza that we saw in Northern Gaza in terms of the devastation, the destruction and the death to civilians.
 
So, what that could mean for the next couple weeks, John, is that we could see this high intensity phase continue throughout the month of December. And then sources say it could transition to what could be a very long but lower intensity phase starting in January, John.
 
BERMAN:  Alex Marquardt in Israel this morning. Alex, thank you very much. And coming up, a controversial bankruptcy deal could give legal protections to the family behind the drug Oxycontin. What does it mean for victims who dealt with the public health crisis?

KATE BOLDUAN, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  This week, the Supreme court spent nearly two hours hearing oral arguments over a controversial settlement involving Purdue Pharma, the company behind OxyContin. In the settlement, now under scrutiny by the justices, the Sackler family who own Purdue Pharma, agreed to pay up to $6 billion to settle thousands of lawsuits. In return, members of that family would be given wide-ranging legal protections from future lawsuits.
 
Now, the justices, as they were hearing this this week, they appeared divided on whether those protections for the members of the Sackler family, if those protections, went beyond the law. So, what does this mean for the victims of the opioid crisis? Well, the justices consider all of this. One of the families waiting and watching all of it is the Nelson family whose son Bryan died from an opioid overdose in 2019. He was just 20 years old.
 
Bryan's stepfather, Judge William Nelson, joins us right now. Judge, thank you for much -- so much for coming in and taking the time to speak with me. You know, part of the questioning from the justices, it focused in on kind of the broad support for the settlement by victims and their families. Now, this is a deal that you and your wife, you do not support. So, what does this moment after everything you've been through, what does it mean for you?
 
JUDGE WILLIAM NELSON, MARION COUNTY, INDIANA SUPERIOR COURT AND STEPSON DIED OF OXYCONTIN OVERDOSE:  First of all, let me correct you, it was 2009. So, it's been about 15 -- 
 
BOLDUAN:  I'm so sorry, judge.
 
W. NELSON:  -- years now that -- since Bryan has passed. That's OK. But, what it means, I don't know quite how to answer. What it means to me is we're just against the settlement for several reasons. And I can start off by telling you we're against it for $11 billion reasons, because that's what the Sackler's family is estimated net worth has been as of the end of 2022. Someone worth $11 billion should not be protected under the bankruptcy laws.
 <br>[10:45:00]
 
BOLDUAN:  You want the opportunity to hold them accountable to sue the family. Other as -- other victims of the opioid crisis who would be part of this settlement, I want to read some of what they have also said. One woman who lost two sons to opioid overdoses told "The Wall Street Journal" this, that I look at it, the settlement, as that money is going to be used to save lives. That money will be used as another mother -- so another mother doesn't have to bury her child, or the two, as I have. Do you wrestle with that?
 
W. NELSON:  I do, every day, and I, and I sympathize with those families that are for the settlement. It -- it is not a lot of money. I mean, $6 billion may seem like a lot of money. It may seem like it's going to save lives, but we've been fighting this crisis for 25 years now. And 200 people a day are still dying. If you think about it, you know, $6 billion -- you hear about this $6 billion, you hear about this money going towards opioid abatement treatment facilities, et cetera.
 
But what you don't hear about, and you didn't hear a word about it during the oral arguments, and I'm not sure the justices even are aware of it, but this $6 billion is paid payable out over 18 years. And if you think about it, you know, $6 billion paid out over 18 years, that's $330 million a year, divided up between 50 states. Divided up between all cities, towns, and even the Native American tribes, that money's not going to go very far.
 
The Sacklers have $11 billion. They are so interested in saving lives. Pony up the money now, and we might change our position. You know, you've got -- you're sitting on $11 billion. Pony up $6 billion of it right now. Don't wait 18 years. It may be a real save lives. But over 18 years, 200 people a day are still going to die.
 
BOLDUAN:  You've had the opportunity. I was reading about an opportunity to confront the Sackler family at a hearing last year. And during that, your wife, she played a recording of the 9-1-1 call from that horrific night that changed your lives forever. Let me play this for people.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  9-1-1.
 
KRISTY NELSON, SON DIED OF OXYCONTIN:  I need an ambulance. My son's not breathing.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What's the address? 10731?
 
K. NELSON:  10731, yes. Hurry.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Is he blue?
 
K. NELSON:  He is white.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  
 
K. NELSON:  Oh, my God. He's dead.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Ma'am, I need you to calm down. How old is he? Ma'am?
 
K. NELSON:  He's 20.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Ma'am, I need you to calm down. How old is he?
 
K. NELSON:  He's 20.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOLDUAN:  This isn't just a court case, which is why this is so important. As you wait to hear what these justices decide, what do you want them to consider?
 
W. NELSON:  I want them to consider the -- that phone call. I want them to consider that if they overturn this settlement, which I think they absolutely should, I think holding the Sacklers accountable is -- it's not just the money, you know, it's principle. It's the principle of the thing. These people should not get away with it. And if they uphold this settlement, the Sacklers are scot-free forever, and I'm afraid if they are scot-free forever, another murder is going to have to make that phone call.
 
And you know, Justice Kagan, kind of, took me aback when she said the majority of these people want this settlement to go through and why should we hold it up for one -- I don't know how she said it, some one single nut job is against it. And if I'm that single nut job, then so be it. I'm one of the families that received $3,500 out of the $6 billion settlement over eight -- in the next 18 years. And by the time I get a $3,500 check from this guy who killed my son, then he's responsible for a half a million other deaths, and he continues to be responsible for 200 deaths a day.
 <br>[10:50:00]
 
I'll be in that nut job and I'll hold out until the day I die, but I just hope the justices realize that this money is not going to solve the problem. And I hope -- I sympathize with the families that want this money, that need this money, and that want to put this behind them. I think they all share the same principles as we do. I know they want the money, they need the money, but it's not the right thing. And I just hope they understand our side as we understand theirs.
 
BOLDUAN:  Yes. And today, like I'm positive every day, you keep Bryan very close to your heart. Thank you so much, Judge, for coming in.
 
W. NELSON:  Yes, I'm -- 
 
BOLDUAN:  Sorry for your loss. Thank you so very much.
 
W. NELSON:  Thank you very much.
 
BOLDUAN:  Thank you.
 
Sara.
 
SIDNER:  Powerful. What a powerful statement by the judge.
 
All right. The loss of a television legend. Iconic American television producer and creator, Norman Lear, has died. He revolutionized television, pushed boundaries, and made us all smile for generations. The life he led and the shows we loved, ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:55:00]
 
SIDNER:  Breaking news from Hollywood today. Longtime television producer and writer Norman Lear has passed away at the age of 101 with taboo busting programs like "All in the Family", "Maud" and "The Jeffersons." Norman Lear radically changed the face of television and, frankly, all of us, as he pushed buttons and boundaries in a way that no one had ever experienced, really, in mainstream entertainment.

CARROLL O'CONNOR, ACTOR, "ALL IN THE FAMILY":  Now, no prejudice intended, but, you know, I always check with the Bible on these here things. I think that, I mean, if God had meant us to be together, he'd have put us together. Well, look what he's done. He put you over in Africa, he put the rest of us in all the white countries.
 
SAMMY DAVIS JR., ACTOR:  Well, you must have told him where we were because somebody came and got us.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SIDNER:  Sammy Davis Jr. there. CNN Lisa Respers France is joining us now with more. Lisa, all of these shows, we can all remember. I know, it makes me a little aged, but we can all remember the theme songs, all of the different things, and the lines from so many of these shows. Plus, it made us talk about difficult things, didn't it?
 
LISA RESPERS FRANCE, CNN SENIOR ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER:  Absolutely. I mean -- and you're not old, Sara. You're seasoned like I am. You know, he really pushed the boundaries and he was able to marry humor with very serious topics like we saw in that clip. You know, racism for all in the family. He was well ahead of his time in the fact that "The Jeffersons" had discussions of black wealth one day at a time. Single motherhood.
 
These were things that we now take for granted when we watch television, but they were really, you know, knew when he presented these shows and he made us really think even as he made us laugh. And that's the reason why people are deeply mourning his death today, because he really presented people in a way that felt authentic, felt very real, and that many of us grew up watching and enjoying.
 
SIDNER:  Lisa Respers France, I hope that he is moving on up to a deluxe apartment in the sky.
 
FRANCE:  You cannot resist.
 
SIDNER:  I couldn't.
 
FRANCE:  You cannot resist.
 
SIDNER:  I couldn't.
 
FRANCE:  I hope so, too.
 
SIDNER:  I love "The Jeffersons", that was my personal favorite. All right. Thank you so much.
 
FRANCE:  Absolutely.
 
SIDNER:  Appreciate you.
 
FRANCE:  Thank you, Sara.
 
SIDNER:  John.
 
BERMAN:  Yes, celebrating how complicated life can be.
 
All right. Five minutes of obfuscation. Five minutes when asked if he would abuse power or break the law. Then, Donald Trump says he would be a dictator on his first day in office.
