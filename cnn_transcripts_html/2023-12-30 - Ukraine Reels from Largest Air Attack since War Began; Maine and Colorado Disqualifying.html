KIM BRUNHUBER, CNN ANCHOR (voice-over): Welcome to all of you watching us here in the United States, Canada and around the world. I'm Kim Brunhuber. This is CNN NEWSROOM. 
 
Ukrainian in mourning: details on the extent of the destruction following the largest air assault by Russia so far and look at how U.S. President Joe Biden is responding when it comes to additional aid. 
 
Fighting to stay on the ballot: former President Donald Trump is trying to keep his name from being removed from yet another state's primary election. 
 
Plus, cities around the world prepare to ring in the new year with massive crowds and tight security. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over): Live from Atlanta, this is CNN NEWSROOM with Kim Brunhuber. 
 
BRUNHUBER: Three regions in Ukraine are holding a day of mourning right now after what military officials called the largest Russian attack on the country since the war began. 
 
In Odessa, a Christmas tree is standing in a courtyard damaged in the strikes. The tree was praised as a victory of light over darkness.
 
Kyiv says Russian drones and missiles pummeled cities across the country on Friday, killing at least 31 people and wounding more than 150 others. Now we're hearing from Russia that it shot down more than 30 drones that came from Ukraine overnight. The UAVs reportedly went down in four separate Russian regions, including Moscow. 
 
Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the attacks terrorist strikes. He is vowing that they won't go unanswered, and Ukraine will bring the war to Russia. Nic Robertson has more. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over): From Ukraine's center, Dnipro, to all points: Kyiv in the north, Odessa in the south, Kharkiv in the Northeast and to Lviv in the far west. 
 
Russia launched its biggest air attack since their ground invasion 22 months ago, 44 of 158 Russian missiles evading Ukraine's Western supported air defenses, killing and wounding civilians. This man narrowly surviving, pulled from the rubble in Kharkiv. 
 
Schools, shopping malls, private homes and high-rises, even a maternity hospital hit. In the capital, this resident awoken by missiles at 7:30 am
 
"It was a horrible sound. It was so frightening. The missile was flying and everything was buzzing, whirring," she says. "I didn't know what to do."
 
President Zelenskyy is accusing Russia of throwing nearly every type of weapon in its arsenal against Ukraine. Ukraine's air force describe a complex attack of interlocking waves of drones, bombers, fighters jets, cruise, hypersonic and other missiles, intended to distract and stretch air defenses.
 
ROBERTSON: There was outrage and anger from European leaders, but Russia's complex assault appears intended not just to exploit weaknesses in Ukraine's air defense system but its waning international support, highlighting Ukraine's need for European and U.S. monies, held up by internal politicking.
 
ROBERTSON (voice-over): In a week when Ukraine appeared to have turned its narrative to one of success, destroying a valuable Russian tank transporter ship in Crimea, reality appears to be a second winter under sustained, systemic Russian bombardment.
 
"Nothing changes. Russia's goal is the same," he says, "to destroy Ukraine as a state and to destroy all rebellious Ukrainians as a nation."
 
Resilience now Ukrainians' best friend -- Nic Robertson, CNN, London. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
BRUNHUBER: In the wake of the Russian bombardment, President Biden is again calling on Congress pass additional military aid to Ukraine. Lawmakers left Washington for the holiday break without agreeing on any new funding. 
 
In a statement on Friday, Biden pointed to the nationwide attacks on Ukraine, saying, quote, "It is a stark reminder to the world that, after nearly two years of this devastating war, Putin's objective remains unchanged. 
 <br>[04:05:03]
 
"He seeks to obliterate Ukraine and subjugate its people. He must be stopped." 
 
Barbie Nadeau is keeping an eye on developments in Ukraine, she joins us from Rome. 
 
Let's start there, Barbie, with the Biden administration pleading for more funding. 
 
BARBIE NADEAU, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's right, this is important at this particular moment. This has become a sort of a forgotten war. 
 
It's not just Ukraine, obviously; the fallout of this is all the NATO allies all across Europe, people are concerned if this funding stops, especially funding from the European Union, there's a little bit of a hiccup there as well. 
 
Ukraine is not going to be able to defend itself. And if Ukraine is not able to do, that then it is going to have a wide implication. People are very, very concerned about that here in Europe. 
 
BRUNHUBER: Meanwhile, there might be more fallout from those attacks with Polish accusations. What they suspect was a Russian missile may have crossed Polish airspace. Take us through this. 
 
NADEAU: Yes, there is a lot of confusion around just where that or whose missile that was. Initially Poland said it was an unidentified object that flew through their airspace. Now they're saying it is a missile. 
 
There's some concern, perhaps, it was a Ukrainian missile that with being used for air defense. Russia is saying they're not going to comment on it at this moment because they don't have enough information about it. 
 
But it really underscores the danger here, especially for those border countries. Poland is very, very nervous from the beginning of this war, now almost entering its third year, about what could happen if the fighting comes across the border. 
 
When there is a breach of airspace, that is a concern, not just for Poland, obviously, but for all of Europe, Kim. 
 
BRUNHUBER: Absolutely. Barbie Nadeau in Rome, thank you so much. 
 
Former President Donald Trump is fighting to keep his name on another state ballot. At any time in the hours ahead, the Oregon supreme court could weigh in on the 14th Amendment case filed earlier this month by a liberal advocacy group. They want Trump's name removed because of his alleged role in the January 6th insurrection. 
 
But in a rare development, Trump's lawyers find themselves agreeing with the Democrat, Oregon's secretary of state, that the case should be tossed on procedural grounds, based on the state's ballot access laws. 
 
Several other states from one coast to the other are already concerned with the issue. CNN chief legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid takes a closer look. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PAULA REID, CNN CHIEF LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The Supreme Court facing increasing pressure to weigh in on whether states can remove former President Trump from the 2024 ballots. After Maine became the second state to kick him off based on the 14th Amendment's ban on insurrectionists holding public office.
 
SHENNA BELLOWS (D-ME), STATE SECRETARY: No secretary of state has ever deprived a presidential candidate of ballot access based on Section Three of the 14th Amendment, but no presidential candidate has ever engaged in insurrection and been disqualified under Section Three of the 14th Amendment.
 
REID: In Maine, ballot eligibility questions first go to the secretary of state, not the courts. 
 
Trump has called for Democrat Shenna Bellows to recuse herself in this case because of previous comments about January 6th, where she tweeted, "The January 6 insurrection was an unlawful attempt to overthrow the results of a free and fair election."
 
She did not remove herself from the matter and now the issue heads to the court, as Trump and the state's Republican Party vowed to appeal.
 
JOEL STETKIS, CHAIR, MAINE REPUBLICAN PARTY: Our voting rights enshrines in the constitution are sacred to us. They have one particular person removed from -- removed really the top candidates from the ballot because she just likes that person just smells of politics.
 
REID: The question of Trump's ballot eligibility has been debated in multiple states but only Maine and Colorado taking him off the primary ballot. Even California on Thursday opted to include him. 
 
In a statement, the Trump campaign accused Colorado and Maine of election interference, attempted theft of an election and the disenfranchisement of the American voter.
 
Even some of Trump's rivals have criticized states taking him out of the running instead of leaving it to the voters.
 
CHRIS CHRISTIE (R-NJ), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It makes him a martyr. He's very good at playing "poor me, poor me."
 
GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Can you have a Republican secretary of state that disqualified Biden from the ballot?
 
Because he has let in 8 million people illegally.
 
REID: The Colorado GOP has already appealed that state's ruling to the United States Supreme Court, asking the justices to take up three key questions. 
 
Does Section 3 of the 14th Amendment apply to a president? And is Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to be enforced by states?
 
And also asking whether the GOP has a First Amendment right to choose its candidates.
 <br>[04:10:04]
 
Trump is also expected to appeal.
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: They're trying to take the election away from the voters.
 
REID: And in states like Michigan and Minnesota, that opted to keep Trump on the ballot for the primary, those judges left the door open to relitigate this issue for the general election. So if the Supreme Court does not step in here, this is a question that could hang over the 2024 election through November -- Paula Reid, CNN, Washington. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
BRUNHUBER: As Paula just mentioned, California's secretary of state pushed back against some calls from her own Democratic Party and decided to keep Trump on the ballot. Here's what she told CNN. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SHIRLEY WEBER (D-CA), STATE SECRETARY: We have looked and looked, and we have observed and we've watched every case that's come out. I have 18 attorneys that are basically focused on this in my office, as well as our attorney general has been involved with this particular issue over the last few months.
 
So we are still looking and we haven't said, "Oh, it's - you know, we're going to keep him," quote-unquote, on the ballot. He is listed on the ballot because we don't have the authority yet to take him off the ballot. 
 
I'd like to see them answer whether or not this constitutional provision applies to all states, that when they come out that they come out with a decision that it affects all 50 states.
 
Because, otherwise, we could have a tremendous amount of chaos with regards to being on certain ballots and not on other ballots and having people challenge the counts because certain states weren't included.
 
I think they have to decide if this is a federal issue, a national issue that has to be addressed at this point. They need to decide whether or not he has engaged in insurrection. I mean, this is extremely important. 
 
I mean, why would you want someone to be President of the United States who spent their time trying to destroy the United States?
 
I mean, no other country would probably tolerate that unless they were engaged in a coup or some kind of revolution. (END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER: California governor Gavin Newsom also thinks Trump should stay on the ballot, telling Democrats to defeat him at the polls. 
 
The Maine secretary of state says that her office has received threats since her decision to remove Trump from the primary ballot. Shenna Bellows says that she is worried about her loved ones and coworkers, calling threats unacceptable. Here she. Is 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SHENNA BELLOWS (D-ME), STATE SECRETARY: I was prepared for the possibility of threats and I really appreciate law enforcement and the people around me, who have been incredibly supportive of my safety and security.
 
My safety and security is important. So is the safety and security of everyone who works with me. And we have received threatening communications. Those are unacceptable.

BRUNHUBER: As we head into the holiday weekend, a powerful storm offshore continues to pound the U.S. West Coast. California is still getting battered with high waves and flooding.

BRUNHUBER: Still to come, police in New York are stepping up security ahead of New Year's Eve. How the Israel-Hamas war is factoring into those preparations. That's just ahead. 
 
Plus, desperately needed food and humanitarian aid is slowly trickling into Gaza. But it's nowhere near enough and sometimes without warning gets held up for days at checkpoints. We'll have that story coming up and more, stay with us.

BRUNHUBER: There are growing concerns that Palestinian civilians have nowhere to go and now Israel's military says it's extending operations against Hamas in the Khan Yunis area in southern Gaza. 
 <br>[04:20:02]
 
In northern Gaza, the IDF says it located and destroyed a Hamas tunnel system. It reportedly included one of the hideout apartments of Yahya Sinwar, the militant group's leader in Gaza. The U.N. says that, since the war began, more than 300 people have
 
 been killed while seeking refuge in U.N. shelters. CNN's Nada Bashir has more on what conditions are like inside Gaza. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A seemingly endless stream of injuries. The wounded rushed to whatever hospitals are still able to treat patients. Day after day, the death toll climbs. There is no respite from Israel's widening offensive.
 
By daybreak, smoke rises above southern Gaza. Many of those who fled here for protection now watch as their loved ones are buried. Grief here is never ending.
 
Israel says it is targeting Hamas, who they say are embedding themselves amongst civilians. But the innocent here are shown no mercy in this war, gripped with fear as Israeli forces repeatedly strike residential buildings and even around hospitals.
 
NADEEN ABDULATIF, DISPLACED GAZAN: The house that we stayed in, we thought it was good and we found shelter finally. A house next to it was bombed. The house jiggled and the house went crazy and the windows broke.
 
BASHIR (voice-over): In Rafah, a vital gateway to aid agencies, children sift through the rubble of their now destroyed shelters, uncertain of what the future will bring or if they will have one. 
 
ABDULATIF: Where am I supposed to go?
 
Children were killed here. I'm terrified. I'm scared. And the thought of me being killed or my other brother being killed is just crossing my mind repeatedly. 
 
BASHIR (voice-over): In northern Gaza, it's not just the constant bombing, striking fear into the hearts of civilians, but also the fear of starvation. 
 
Some 2.2 million people in Gaza are now said to be facing an acute hunger crisis, prompting this sea of desperation; crowds grabbing at what little food aid has made it in, unsure of their next opportunity. But there is one thing certain in Gaza: there is nowhere left to go. 
 
MOEEN QANAN, GAZA RESIDENT (through translator): Children, elderly people, some were fasting. They were sitting and a rocket fell on them. They were displaced from Gaza to Khan Yunis and then moved to Rafah, thinking that it was safer there. But there is no safety. 
 
BASHIR (voice-over): With no safe place to turn, people continue to stream into Rafah, despite the bombardments now gripping the border city. The U.N. says at least 100,000 displaced people have arrived in the already overwhelmed city in the past few days alone. 
 
Families squeezing under tents. This, their only hope of shelter from the bitter cold of winter. As for the airstrikes, there is no hope of shelter wherever they turn -- Nada Bashir, CNN, London.

BRUNHUBER: The U.N. says the flow of humanitarian aid has resumed at the Kerem Shalom crossing from Israel into southern Gaza. Aid deliveries at the crossing had been halted for four days due to security incidents. 
 
The U.N. says a total of 81 trucks carrying food and medicine entered Gaza on Friday through both the Kerem Shalom crossing from Israel and the Rafah crossing from Egypt. 
 
The U.N.'s humanitarian agency says it is a, quote, "woefully inadequate amount, considering the average number of deliveries per day was 455 prior to the war." 
 
For the second time this month, the Biden administration is bypassing Congress to sell military equipment to Israel. The package is worth nearly $150 million and includes items like fuses for artillery shells. 
 
The State Department approved the transfer on an emergency basis, citing the, quote, "urgency of Israel's defensive needs." 
 
Congress typically has 20 days to review sales to foreign militaries. 
 
Across Europe, police are ramping up security to keep people safe during New Year's Eve celebrations, especially in light of heightened tensions over the Israel-Hamas war. CNN's Michael Holmes reports. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Fireworks in Paris. It's always a big party in the City of Light on New Year's Eve. 
 
And this year, with up to 1 million people expected on the Champs- Elysees, police are stepping up security to try to make it a safe one. The French government says more than 95,000 police and military personnel will be deployed on New Year's Eve. 
 <br>[04:25:01]
 
The tight security in part because of heightened tensions over the Israel-Hamas war. French officials say people will be body searched before entering certain festivities. And drones will be used to monitor the crowds.
 
GERALD DARMANIN, FRENCH INTERIOR MINISTER (through translator): I called for an extremely strong mobilization of the police and gendarmerie services against the backdrop of a very high terrorist threat because of what is happening in Israel and Gaza. 
 
HOLMES (voice-over): Berlin, too, is beefing up security to try to avoid another volatile New Year's Eve like last year. Rioters attacked police and emergency workers with fireworks and other objects. Dozens of police were hurt and vehicles set ablaze. German officials
 
 say there is generally an increase of violence on New Year's Eve. And there are fears pro-Palestinian demonstrators, who have scuffled with police in recent months, could pose problems on the holiday. 
 
ANJA DIERSCHKE, SPOKESPERSON, BERLIN POLICE (through translator): We have been preparing for this operation for a long time and are also working closely with the fire service. We will be taking a shoulder- to-shoulder approach here. We will also accompany some of the rescue operations when they are called to hot spots. 
 
HOLMES (voice-over): German emergency personnel released a video via social media, asking the public to respect the police and firefighters working to protect them on New Year's Eve. A plea for a peaceful New Year's Eve, where the conflicts of the world do not spill out unto Europe's streets -- Michael Holmes, CNN.

BRUNHUBER: Welcome back to all you watching us here in the United States, Canada and all around the world. I'm Kim Brunhuber. This is CNN NEWSROOM. 
 
Now to the controversy about whether former President Donald Trump is qualified to run for president in the new year. Two U.S. states have now disqualified him from appearing on the Republican primary ballots; first Colorado, now Maine. Both rulings are on hold right now, caught up in court battles. CNN's Marshall Cohen has the latest. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MARSHALL COHEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Sources tell CNN that former President Donald Trump's team is planning to appeal those major 14th Amendment cases in Colorado and Maine on Tuesday, getting ready to take their challenge in Colorado to the United States Supreme Court and in Maine to a tri-level state court. 
 
They are pushing back hard on the idea that he is disqualified from office because of the 14th Amendment, which says that anyone who swears an oath to uphold the Constitution and then engages in an insurrection can't return to government. 
 
That's exactly the rationale that election official, the top elect official in Maine and the Colorado supreme court used to disqualify him from office and remove him from the primary ballots. 
 
But look, these decisions, they have come with fallout, political fallout, and a lot of criticism, including some from both sides of the aisle and an avalanche of threats, not only in Colorado but also we're learning in Maine. Take a listen to what Maine secretary of state, Shenna Bellows, told our colleague, Kaitlan Collins, about the threats. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SHENNA BELLOWS (D-ME), STATE SECRETARY: I certainly worry about the safety of people that I love, people around me and people who are charged with protecting me and working alongside me. 
 
That being said, we are a nation of laws and that's what's really important. So I've been laser focused on that obligation to uphold the Constitution. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COHEN: Look, this is bigger than just those two states. This has truly become a national situation. Trump has already beaten back lawsuits in Michigan and Minnesota. 
 
Just a few days ago, the top election official in California, a Democrat, decided that Trump will remain on the ballot there. And another major case is pending in Oregon, where the Oregon supreme court could possibly rule as soon as this weekend on Donald Trump's eligibility for office. 
 
So there are a lot of key questions in the air, a lot of appeals that will certainly be pursued and a lot of questions that need to be answered as the 2024 primary cycle rapidly approaches -- Marshall Cohen, CNN, Washington.

BRUNHUBER: The U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security is set to visit the southern border in early January amid a surge of migrant crossings. Alejandro Mayorkas is scheduled to visit Eagle Pass, Texas, to meet with federal and local officials. 
 
That comes on the heels of his visit, alongside secretary of state Antony Blinken, to Mexico City earlier this week, to discuss the influx with Mexico's president and his cabinet. December saw more than 225,000 migrant encounters at the border. That is the largest number in more than two decades. 
 
The number of unaccompanied migrant children crossing into the U.S. has spiked in recent years, leaving thousands in the custody of the federal government. There are currently 11,700 migrant children in U.S. custody. That is according to data from the Health Department and Homeland Security. 
 
The number of kids in custody has increased 6.5 percent since December 1st. Texas governor Greg Abbott says that his state has bused more than 92,000 migrants to other states since April of last year. 
 
Operation Lone Star, the name of Abbott's busing directive, has bused tens of thousands of migrants to so-called sanctuary cities across the country. 
 
Last week, the Republican governor signed a controversial state law which gives local law enforcement the power to arrest migrants and give judges the ability to issue orders to remove migrants from the U.S. On Thursday, the Justice Department threatened to sue Texas over the new law. 
 
Ukraine tries to get back to its feet after a wave of deadly Russian airstrikes. Still ahead, what is ahead for the country after the attacks laid waste to large parts of many of its cities. Stay with us.

BRUNHUBER: Now the latest developments in Ukraine where three regions are honoring the victims of yesterday's devastating airstrikes. They're holding a day of mourning after Russia hammered targets across Ukraine. 
 
At least 31 people were killed and more than 150 were wounded. Moscow says it saw incoming Ukrainian drones overnight. They reportedly shot down more than 30 of them in four regions, including Moscow. Ukrainians responded to the Russian bombardment by erecting a Christmas tree in a courtyard in Odessa, which was battered by the attack. 
 
For more analysis, we're joined by Peter Zalmayev, the director of the Eurasia Democracy Initiative. He is speaking to us from Kyiv. 
 
Thank you so much for being here with us. You are there in Kyiv. Describe what it was like in the capital during these attacks. 
 
PETER ZALMAYEV, DIRECTOR, EURASIA DEMOCRACY INITIATIVE: Well, this was overnight. To be honest with you, I am now wearing earplugs in my ears. So I actually slept through the whole thing. 
 
It also tells you that, despite the massive damage to our infrastructure around the country, 33 people died as a result of this air attack. People have grown used to this, you know, to this sort of terror from the sky. 
 
We are now much more hardened than even before. Paradoxically, I would even add to this, that this massive air attack may have come at a very inopportune moment for Ukraine. 
 
But there is significant political insight in Ukraine that has been intensifying as a result of these unrealistic expectations for our counteroffensive, both on the part of our Western allies and here internally. 
 
So this was a very timely and welcome reminder to the Ukrainians of who the real enemy is. The real enemy is Vladimir Putin, who has not given up his initial goal of either controlling Ukraine out politically, economically or, if he cannot achieve that, destroying it outright and making it a failed state. 
 
So in a way, as counterintuitive as it may sound, I think that this has allowed us to, once again, concentrate on what is important. 
 <br>[04:40:03]
 
Especially now that the country is discussing a new law on mobilization, which provides for 500,000 Ukrainian men to be mobilized for what is promising to be a long, multi-year war with Russia. 
 
BRUNHUBER: What would the difference between this mobilization and what has gone on before exactly?
 
Explain to us the mechanism there. 
 
ZALMAYEV: Well, what has gone on before is, initially, when the Russia invaded, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian men signed up voluntarily and went into this war and have been in this war ever since. 
 
So we are talking about exhausted troops, who really need a break, as simple as that. While the rest of the country has kind of relaxed, saying that things are happening and Ukraine was able to stage quite effective counteroffensive operations when it liberated Kherson. 
 
If you remember, when it liberated part of the Kharkiv region, et cetera. And so now we are being told that this is looking much more sinister than we thought. Putin has been able to mobilize significant resources. Economically he was able to move his economy to a war footing. 
 
And so we are now having it play catch up to the Russians. We have to relieve these exhausted troops. We have to train new soldiers. This will take time. This is being done quite late in the game. 
 
So this is a very, very nervous moment for all of us, especially now that we are seeing our partners in Brussels are being slow with their delivery of financial aid and the U.S. Congress has still not decided what to do with the announced package for Ukraine. 
 
This is the worst moment to be prevaricating and to be hesitant. Just now we saw, with this air offensive yesterday, a rocket landed on Polish territory. I mean, this should actually lead to the invocation of Article 5, the collective security by NATO. 
 
But we're talking about a nuclear power such as Russia. So the best way to send Putin a message that NATO is strong and resilient is to allow Ukraine to continue its resistance and give it all the weapons that it needs. 
 
BRUNHUBER: You mentioned this, so let me ask you directly. The timing behind this, which was reportedly the largest attack, air
 
 attack since the war began, the timing for Russia, do you think Putin is taking advantage of the West's disengagement with Ukraine to press home his advantage now?
 
ZALMAYEV: He is sending contradictory signals and he is constantly probing. As a KGB man, he is a constantly probing and provoking. On one hand he is sending a message to "The New York Times."
 
It was reported that, since September, he's been sending these feelers, these signals that he is ready to settle for some kind of a peace agreement. On the other hand, he is announcing with this air attack that his goals have remained the same. 
 
This also may be a part of his vengeance. Obviously, he wants to send a signal of strength to his own people, because, mind you, two days ago, Ukraine destroyed a major Russian ship in the Crimean border, which led to the deaths of 74 Russian sailors. 
 
Keep that in mind, as well. At the same time, this may be a start of a campaign of sort of what you saw last year, that seeks to knock out our infrastructure, our power grid, et cetera. 
 
So his signals are contradictory. But once again, do not be fooled. For as long as Putin is alive, his goal to destroy Ukraine will not be modified. That is his deficit (ph). He will not do anything else. 
 
He has, in fact, he is banking on the continuation of this war and is betting on it as a sure way to remain in power. I don't think that we will see Putin as a president of peace until the rest of his life. 
 
BRUNHUBER: Yes. You can bet on that, I imagine. Peter Zalmayev, we'll have to leave it there but always a pleasure talking to you. Thank you so much. 
 
ZALMAYEV: Thank you. 
 
BRUNHUBER: And we'll be right back, please do stay with us.

A. BOCELLI: Yes. KINKADE: What is that like?
 
A. BOCELLI: Well, I've been very lucky because to sing with the most beautiful voices of the world, it is a privilege, no?
 
For me, I like voices. Virginia's voice, it is another thing. 
 
KINKADE: It's very special. 
 
A. BOCELLI: Yes. It is special because it is the voice of my heart. 
 
KINKADE: Virginia, you are just 11 years old. 
 
But you're no stranger to the stage, right?
 
VIRGINIA BOCELLI, SINGER: Yes, at the beginning when I was 7 or 8 years old, I was really nervous, even though there were no people at all. But then when I got bigger and bigger, I remember the first time in Madison Square Garden. There is a lot of people and I was really nervous.

KINKADE: Can you describe for us the feeling you get when you're on stage in front of tens of thousands of people, performing with your dad, who is, arguably, one of the best tenors of all time?
 
V. BOCELLI: Singing with him sometimes is a little -- not intimidating but he's so good and I'm just there, trying to sing. He makes it fun, so that's why I am grateful. 
 
KINKADE: That's so great to hear. I imagine that your dad is giving you some pretty amazing advice as you have grown as a performer. 
 
What's the best advice?
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
V. BOCELLI: I remember one technical, you have to vibrate more because that is one that many people struggle on. And I still haven't got because it is hard. 
 
A. BOCELLI: You are very young. 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
V. BOCELLI: I know but I try. 
 
A. BOCELLI: You can have a very fast vibration. 
 
V. BOCELLI: I know but ...
 
KINKADE: I mean, just 11 years old. 
 
How do you balance performing with school work and playtime?
 
V. BOCELLI: Being away two months of the year, it is really hard to catch up, because, for example, I am not very talented, let's say, in math. But my mom helps me sometimes. 
 
A. BOCELLI: When I hear to shout, I immediately understand that they are doing math. 
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
V. BOCELLI: Because me and my mom have very similar personalities. I'm not good in geography but my mom tries to explain it to me. 
 
KINKADE: I suspect, given your talent for singing, which clearly runs in the family, you probably won't need geometry.

You, of course, have been doing a charity work for the Andrea Bocelli Foundation for decades, guided by your strong faith. 
 
Why is it important for you to give back?
 
A. BOCELLI: Because we live, all together, on the same ship. We are all linked. We are all together. 
 
KINKADE: You performed in 2020, in Milan, to an empty cathedral at the height of the pandemic. And that was the most watched classical livestream; 28 million people in just the first 24 hours. And it was a time when people needed hope. People also need hope now. 
 
What is the power of music?
 
(MUSIC PLAYING)
 
A. BOCELLI: For me, that concert, it was a prayer, basically, a prayer for me, for my family, for everybody. It was a moment in which I tried to give hope to the people. 
 
KINKADE: When you reflect on 2023, what have been your highlights?
 
A. BOCELLI: My best moment are when I am at home with my friends, with my family, my horses. 
 
KINKADE: Do you ride often?
 
A. BOCELLI: Yes. When I am at home, every time it's possible, I do it. 
 <br>[04:55:04]
 
KINKADE: You can definitely see the special relationship that you two have, which obviously comes across onstage. 
 
What are you both looking forward to in 2024? V. BOCELLI: I guess we're going to look forward to a year with more happiness but also for the tour. We hope to learn more songs together and continue this journey together. 
 
A. BOCELLI: I would like peace and serenity in all the world. 
 
KINKADE: Thank you so much for your time. Happy new year, Andrea and Virginia Bocelli. 
 
V. BOCELLI: Happy New Year. 
 
A. BOCELLI: Happy New Year, Lynda.
