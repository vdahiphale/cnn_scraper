JESSICA DEAN, CNN HOST: You are in the CNN NEWSROOM.
 
Hi, everyone. I'm Jessica Dean in Washington. Jim Acosta has the night off.
 
And we begin with major developments in the Fulton County investigation into former President Donald Trump. The district attorney there just notified two witnesses to testify before the grand jury next week as she prepares to seek a potential fourth indictment against Trump and some of his allies.
 
She will attempt to show that they conspired to overturn his 2020 election loss. And today, we got the strongest indication of that from former Georgia lieutenant governor and CNN contributor, Geoff Duncan. Take a look.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GEOFF DUNCAN, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I did just receive notification to appear on Tuesday morning at the Fulton County grand jury and I certainly will be there to do my part in recounting facts.
 
I have no expectations as to the questions and I'll certainly answer whatever question is put in front of me and certainly don't want to go any deeper than that to, you know, jeopardize or compromise the investigation.
 
But look, for me, this is a story that is important for Republicans to hear -- Americans to hear. Let's hear the whole truth and nothing but the truth about Donald Trump's actions and the surrounding cast of characters around him.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
DEAN: And joining me now in the studio, CNN political correspondent, Sara Murray, and here to give us some legal analysis CNN contributor, and former Nixon White House counsel, John Dean, Sara and John. Great to have you both here. I want to start with Sara first. Just walk us through these notifications from the Fulton County DA.
 
SARA MURRAY, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, so she had previously subpoenaed a handful of witnesses and sort of said, you know, I'm putting you on standby essentially, to testify before the grand jury. I'll give you a 48-hour notice when we need you there, and then today, it sounds like some of these witnesses, former Lieutenant Governor Geoff Duncan, among them and George Chidi, who is an independent journalist. That's who we know so far who were notified and said, please show up, please testify before the grand jury on Tuesday.
 
So this is a good indication that she is going to start presenting her case early next week. We've heard from other sources that this is likely to take two days so she could begin this presentation on Monday, go through Tuesday, and then ask the grand jury essentially, to hand up their indictments Tuesday afternoon or evening.
 
You know, we've heard that she is likely to seek charges against more than a dozen individuals in this case. So it's not just Donald Trump that she has been looking at.
 
DEAN: Right. There's just so many of his allies as well.
 
We know that Duncan along with 75 other witnesses have already testified in this investigation. Walk us through what you think Tuesday's going to look like for him and George Chidi as well.
 
MURRAY: Yes, I mean, I think this is interesting, because they testified before a special grand jury that was set up just to investigate what Donald Trump and his associates were doing around the 2020 election. This grand jury that he is going before now, they haven't heard any of that.
 
They have been hearing cases about armed robberies, they've been hearing cases about murderers, you know, sort of run of the mill cases in Fulton County. And so what I think is that the Fulton County district attorney's team is going to come in before that grand jury and say either Monday or Tuesday, okay, today, you're going to hear a different kind of case.
 
And then they're going to put on witnesses that can sort of craft this narrative about the efforts to try to overturn the 2020 election, whether it was the phone call between Donald Trump and Brad Raffensperger, where Trump asked him to find the votes, whether it's the fake electoral scheme, whether it's the voting breach in Coffee County, Georgia and then she will ask for these indictments she's seeking.
 
DEAN: Wow. All right, I want to bring John into this conversation.
 
John, good to see you.
 
What do you make of a former lieutenant governor testifying against a former president of the United States in a scheme to try to overturn an election result? JOHN DEAN, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Well, he must be a good witness is the first thing I take because he has already testified at her special grand jury. He must tell a good story, a full story, an honest story and so she wants to bring him back to help educate the regular grand jury which will hand down the indictment.
 
DEAN: Right, and we know that they're going to be -- and we were talking earlier on the program with some other legal experts about what's unique about a grand jury. It is just the prosecutor that the jurors can ask questions to, the people who are testifying. What do you expect -- how do you expect that to play out in that courtroom, or in that room?
 
JOHN DEAN: Well, a grand jury, which is a secret proceeding, we don't actually ever get into grand juries. They certainly don't televise them, as they will the trial of this case. They're just ordinary citizens who are brought in as a shield between the government and a potential defendant to say, yes, indeed, there is a crime here and we believe it ought to go forward.
 
I believe this grand jury is a standard 23-person, grand jury of men and women. They're probably taken from the voting rolls, and if 12 of them vote for an indictment, an indictment on be handed down.
 
It doesn't have to be unanimous, but it might well be. We will never know that.
 
DEAN: Right. Right.
 
JOHN DEAN: So, this is what's going to happen. She'll present the case and they'll pass their judgment.
 
DEAN: Right. And Sara, I want to go back to a point that you mentioned a little bit earlier. You said it isn't just Trump that she's looking at. She's looking at other people. And she's talking about a conspiracy case here.
 
She's talking about racketeering, that involves other people. What do we know about these potential others that could be included?
 
MURRAY: Yes. I think she really wants to lay out the various facets that people, you know, put forward to try to overturn the election.
 
So you know, Rudy Giuliani is a good example. He's Donald Trump's former attorney. He has been told he's a target in this investigation. He's someone who showed up and gave, you know, a totally bogus presentation before state lawmakers, have plenty of these conspiracy theories.
 
And you know, he also, we know from our reporting was involved in sort of coordinating fake electors across seven different battleground states. So he is someone that she's going to be looking at, she's also going to be looking at people who are behind this sort of campaign of harassment against election officials there, as well as again, there was this voting systems breach in rural Coffee County, Georgia. So I think that's one of the things that sort of look and feel very different about these indictments than what we've seen from the other indictments.
 
DEAN: The three, yes.
 
MURRAY: From the many other indictments against Donald Trump. So you know, we saw unindicted unnamed co-conspirators in the federal indictment around election interference, but that's not what we're expecting in this case. We are expecting an indictment that names the names of other individuals that the district attorney office believes helped Donald Trump in this effort to try to overturn the election.
 
DEAN: Right. It is so interesting to make that point, and John, just talking about Trump and his defense team, look, in this case, they have audio recordings of that phone call where he -- that Sara talked about where he is asking Brad Raffensperger to find the extra votes.
 
They have this other evidence, what kind of legal challenges do you see playing out for his defense team? Should he be indicted and go forward with this case?
 
JOHN DEAN: You must remember, Jessica, with a conspiracy, that all of the conspirators are guilty for the acts of each other. So I think, she is going to bring a very big case, maybe at least we know, at least maybe a dozen, if not, as many as 20 different defendants will be involved in this conspiracy.
 
Shea has got cooperation from some of the fake collectors, she has cooperation from other potential conspirators. So this is a big case, and I think where the defense is going to go is first trying to find a jury that they'll find some sympathy with that will hang -- that at least, somebody will not agree to find beyond a reasonable doubt. That's where it'll start.
 
It's going to take a long time to put a jury together, and this this case probably won't happen, get tried until well after the election is my guesstimate.
 
DEAN: And, John, what do you -- what sticks out to you about this potential fourth indictment. We've now been through these other three, which you have given analysis on and taken a look at. What sticks out to you as unique about this fourth one?
 
JOHN DEAN: Well, it's a RICO case that makes it unique. There is a federal RICO statute. As Sara was mentioning, Rudy Giuliani being one of the targets of this case, he made his bones in New York as a prosecutor on the federal RICO statute, so he knows RICO law, but here, he is dealing with a very broad Georgia statute, and that's a unique statute.
 
So I think that's what will make this -- it is kind of a speaking indictment. She likes these cases. She has brought other RICO cases. She can tell a story rather than just a chapter of a book. She puts out the whole book when she tells this story. DEAN: It will be fascinating to see. Sara, I want to ask you just kind of about security and we know that Fani Willis has said that there has been constant threats against her, against others.
 <br>[18:10:07]
 
This has been, of course, a years' long investigation. We know that there are security measures in place that more will be implemented.
 
You've been down there in Georgia. You've been around this area. What do you take away from all of this? And what should people kind of keep in mind as we head into this week, where things could actually start happening?
 
MURRAY: Yes, I mean, I think one of the things that has made the climate around this different is she is a Black Democratic district attorney in the south and a lot of the kinds of threats she receives are reflective of that. They're very racist. They're very sexualized.
 
She has talked about enduring this and her staff having to endure this, and I think that's why we've seen this security ramp up sort of well, before any charging announcements.
 
We've seen barricades go up around the courthouse. We've seen a huge police presence out there. We know her personal security has been beefed up, and I suspect that we're going to see even more of that this week, just because, you know, it's hard for them to discern what is going to be the difference between an internet troll, someone who is firing off, you know, threats via e-mail or leaving anonymous voicemails versus someone who would actually be willing to try to show up, and I think that's something that they take very seriously and are trying to guard against.
 
DEAN: Right, you have to, right?
 
MURRAY: Yes.
 
DEAN: You can't -- you're better to be safe than sorry there.
 
John, I want to talk to you about just the political implications here. There's obviously all the legal issues for former President Trump, but this is all happening. He was in Iowa today talking to voters there.
 
He is running to be the GOP nominee in 2024 while he has three indictments and likely a fourth against him. He has joked that another indictment just makes him stronger in the polls going into the 2024 election, what do you think?
 
JOHN DEAN: I'm not sure it makes him stronger for the general election. It might appeal to his base. He is very good at playing the grievous card, grieving. That he is being a victim.
 
He is not. These are based on his own behavior and this is standard operating procedure. He is being treated like any other defendant. So what he's going to do with this in Georgia in particular, he has done some of the nastiest political ads attacking Fani Willis rather viciously and falsely. Whether the Georgia judges will tolerate that or not, I don't think so. It's pretty, pretty unseemly. So we'll see how this plays out if he continues this behavior.
 
DEAN: Yes. It will be. There is so much that will come in the next days and week ahead.
 
John Dean and Sarah Murray, thanks so much to both of you. We appreciate it.
 
JOHN DEAN: Thank you.
 
DEAN: And as the grand jury prepares to meet in Georgia, Donald Trump, as I mentioned, he is in Iowa with the other Republican candidates.
 
We're going to break it down with our political panel, that's next.
 
And later, the rising death toll from the Maui wildfires and how the survivors are now just beginning to try to put their lives back together there.
 
You're in the CNN NEWSROOM.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:17:06]
 
DEAN: Former President Donald Trump hitting the campaign trail in Iowa today and making his first appearance since we learned more about a possible fourth criminal indictment.
 
In less than 48 hours, Georgia prosecutors plan to seek new charges related to Trump's efforts to overturn that state's 2020 election results.
 
Today, former Georgia lieutenant governor, Geoff Duncan revealed to CNN, he will testify before grand jury Tuesday.
 
Duncan is also a CNN political commentator.
 
All of this as the son of the current president faces mounting legal troubles of his own. Just yesterday, the Justice Department appointed a special counsel to oversee the prosecution of Hunter Biden.
 
Joining us now to discuss all of this Seung Min Kim, White House reporter for the Associated Press and Laura Barron-Lopez, a White House correspondent for PBS NewsHour. It is great to see both of you.
 
Laura, I want to start first with you. We see the former president in Iowa today. He is campaigning.
 
What are we expecting to see from him in the next few days as this goes on in Georgia? Because now, this would be a fourth indictment. He kind of has a playbook here. LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: He does. He right away, sometimes gets ahead of the indictment, especially if his team is notified of the details, then he will often post on Truth Social ahead of it, attacking the prosecutor -- in this case, he would be attacking the Fulton County district attorney, Fani Willis and her entire team and essentially just saying that it isn't true that this isn't something that he's done and rallying his base around him.
 
And we've seen that each time that an indictment has dropped, the Republican base really supports him and so does a significant amount of establishment Republicans in the Republican Party, particularly House Republicans saying that they want to investigate the investigators, and that is what I think we can expect to see come next week.
 
DEAN: A replay of all of this.
 
Seung Min, Trump made a brief visit to the Iowa State Fair today in Iowa. There were also several of his 2024 rivals there and my colleague, Kyung Lah asked voters what they thought about Trump's indictment and I want to play what some voters told her. We will listen to that.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KYUNG LAH, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Are the indictments changing how you feel?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No, because I do think a lot of that is for effect.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A lot of those are trumped up.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't believe most of it. You know, they're just out to get him. You know, it might turn around to and they might -- Biden might be the first one in jail.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
DEAN: And so for all of us here on cable news, we're talking about this a lot. We're talking about it nearly every day, but Seung Min, have we seen any indication that Trump's legal troubles are impacting his standing in this race?
 
SEUNG MIN KIM, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: I mean, he continues to be the top candidate in national polling. He continues to be the top candidate in Iowa, the state where all almost all of them are Republican candidates are campaigning this weekend.
 <br>[18:20:00]
 
So, in terms of actually really making a difference in his commanding lead in the Republican primary race right now, we're not seeing it, and it is precisely because of voters that Kyung talked to, the former president has been really effective at making his legal troubles about the voters themselves. We constantly hear from him that they are coming after me, because I fought for you, so they're coming after you.
 
And he has really been a master of making his legal troubles about sort of his voters writ large, which is why you see that enduring support from his base, particularly in Iowa, in favor of the former president.
 
Now, as this criminal process progresses, and you have, for example, criminal trials, right amid the presidential caucus nominating season, perhaps that changes or if Republican or the Republican candidates really take the gloves off a little bit more, perhaps starting in the debate in less than two weeks, that changes, but it is really hard to see that calculus changing right now.
 
And historically, no Republican primary presidential candidate has blown a lead this large. So, that's something to keep in mind as well.
 
DEAN: Yes, it is such a good data point for everyone right now. And Laura, we heard Seung Min mention his opponents in that Republican presidential primary.
 
Mike Pence has been a little more direct lately on that third indictment, the one that he had this unique role in, but by and large, most of the opponents are kind of either siding with Trump or just kind of not even talking about this on the stump really at all.
 
BARRON-LOPEZ: That's right -- a lot of -- I mean, the one that's right behind Trump now by double digits, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, has defended the former president repeatedly even going so far as to float a potential pardon and saying that attacking the DOJ, we've seen Senator Tim Scott also attack the Justice Department and the country's justice system.
 
I was just -- when we talk about the general election, though, I don't think these indictments are ultimately going to help the president. They are clearly a big boon in the primary because the base rallies around him, but I was talking to a Republican voter in Arizona, just this past week, someone who voted Biden in 2020, who had previously voted Republican his entire life, and I wondered if he had soured on Biden and he said no. That he planned to vote for Biden again, and that he couldn't find a Republican candidate in the field that he could support because they weren't challenging the former president.
 
And he thought Tim Scott could have been someone he could have supported, but because he's actually supporting the former president or defending him when these indictments come down, this Republican -- you know, registered Republican voter said there's no one really for me, he might protest vote for Chris Christie in the GOP primary.
 
DEAN: That is so interesting. Yes, and Tim Scott keeps talking a lot of those talking points we hear from the Hill, which is the weaponization of the Department of Justice, that sort of thing. It's very interesting.
 
Seung Min, I want to talk about the legal troubles for the president's son, Hunter Biden. We know that Attorney General Garland announced yesterday he is appointing David Weiss as a special counsel in that investigation into Hunter's criminal case.
 
How significant do you think that is? And what is its political significance in your opinion?
 
KIM: I mean, it's clearly a matter that Democrats that President Biden himself, the White House wanted to put to bed when that plea deal was struck, and when that plea deal was poised to be or went before the judge, but we saw late last month how this plea deal like collapsed kind of spectacularly before this judge -- before this federal judge in Wilmington, Delaware.
 
And what it does, politically speaking is just to continue this prolonged, you know, saga, as it relates to Hunter Biden through the 2024 election.
 
You know, obviously this is a family matter, a personal matter. President Biden has talked a lot about how he really is proud of Hunter for overcoming a lot of his personal struggles, but it also has turned into a political issue with the number of investigations that we're seeing on Capitol Hill, with Republicans in the presidential race -- or his potential Republican opponents are weaponizing this matter.
 
I do think it's fascinating how congressional Republicans after calling for a special counsel in this case for months, now that Merrick Garland has done so and actually appointed the attorney that Republicans had called for are not pleased with this decision, and they believe that they -- that the Justice Department has done this to particularly stonewall Congressional investigations that they are doing, that multiple committees are doing into alleged, and we should say, unproven, you know, financial dealings involving the family.
 
And I think that -- so obviously, there's a political impact for both sides here and it'll just -- what it does is just continue the storyline more and more.
 
DEAN: Right, and it just does not go away.
 
Laura obviously as Seung Min mentioned, this is a family issue and it is his only surviving son, the president's only surviving son. Do we have any sense of how the president has reacted to this, will react to this going forward because it's so personal?
 <br>[18:25:12]
 
BARRON-LOPEZ: What the White House says repeatedly at every point of a development in the Hunter Biden case is that the president supports his son, the president loves his son, but they do not comment on anything about the case. White House officials told us that the White House was not given any type of heads up about this decision to appoint a special counsel.
 
You know, they treat this case the same way they're treating the Trump indictment cases, which is they will not talk about it at all, and they say that the Justice Department is totally independent. Of course, Seung Min is right, this is going to impact the president's re-election campaign, and House Republicans are more fired up than ever before to go after the president despite having no evidence to connect him to his son's business dealings.
 
DEAN: All right, well, thank you to both, Laura Barron-Lopez and Seung Min Kim. Always great to see you both, thanks so much.
 
And we are learning more about the terrible toll from the wildfires in Maui. We're getting a new look at the devastation. We'll walk you through it. That's next.
 
You're in the CNN NEWSROOM.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:30:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
DEAN: In Hawaii, the massive wildfires have become the deadliest natural disaster in the state's history. At least 80 people have died thousands are displaced and many others are missing. And we're hearing from residents on what's next for them.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It was everything I could do to just gather my kids and gather whatever I could in two minutes to get out of the house and - I mean, we ran out of the house with no shoes. Finally saw the pictures of what used to be our house, and our town and just trying to figure out what to do from here because there's nothing to go back to.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
DEAN: CNN Chief Climate Correspondent, Bill Weir, is in Maui. Bill, tell us what you're seeing right now.
 
BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Jessica, the great Mr. Rogers taught us that when your kids see something scary on TV, one way to comfort them is to say look for the helpers and there's no shortage of that here today.
 
Now, about - what do we - four - five days from the firestorm that just ruined so many lives on Lahaina, look at all these volunteers. These are just folks here from the south and west side of Maui who came with crates of water, fuel, the things they really need.
 
We just talked to one of the captains and these are just complete volunteer crowd sourced efforts. I'll put them up on my social media if you want to support them. But a woman named Grace Hertz (ph) is leading the effort on one boat and they for two days have just been beach landing all these vital supplies. They say they need diesel oil or diesel fuel, premium fuel, baby supplies, burn medications, obviously are desperately needed out there, so this is what's happening. She says they also seen some looting at night. There's National Guardsmen out there dealing with that armed looters at night. I just also spoke with one of the county commissioners of South Maui, a gentleman named Tom Cook at another rallying spot for first responders and you can just see the emotion strain on these officials now as they're caught between anxious residents just real eager to get home and cadaver teams that are still looking for people who are lost.
 
This is Tom Cook.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
WEIR: Well, first let me just say our hearts are breaking for you around the country. Everybody is so concerned about Maui right now. How are you doing? How was your friends and family? People all accounted for?
 
COOK: I would say the entire island is really sad and stressed. It's extra challenging because in my district of Kihei, which was threatened, but did not have any residential fires that had grassland fires that were threatening it ...
 
WEIR: Yes.
 
COOK: ... the upcountry community had both forest fires, grassland fires and lost a few homes.
 
WEIR: Okay.
 
COOK: And then Lahaina, which is obviously very devastated. So, the entire island has been impacted. And it's sort of like some things are working semi normally and other things are just like won't be the same for years and years to come.
 
WEIR: Right. Right. How would you assess the response right now in terms of people in Lahaina getting back home and what do those things stand?
 
COOK: I couldn't tell you. I live in this side. We're taking parts of that, I know that people - I know friends and family who have lost absolutely everything, okay. And so right now, I think the administration is dealing with search and rescue, trying to identify how many people have been impacted in what way they've been impacted. The hazardous waste is going to be a big issue so really. It's a really old town and so a lot of those aspects need to be addressed.
 
WEIR: Yes.
 
COOK: As you've ever been to Lahaina, you know the access is extremely limited one way in, one way out. So, in general, the islands pulling together. The aloha spirit is alive and well but we're extremely bruised, hurt and suffering.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WEIR: That's the thing I've learned in my reporting here, Jessica. Aloha is not just a greeting. It's a - it is a spirit, it is an exchange, it is a shared breath, that my breath supports you and vice versa. And now more than ever, people are hoping to get help. There's some - there was a report that came out earlier today that said that started to put cost damages assessment over $5 billion according to the Pacific disaster center.
 
And FEMA is knocking that down and saying we haven't even begun to think about property damage. They're still looking for proof of life in there.
 
There is a press conference coming up at four o'clock, we'll get a sense of what efforts are being made right now.
 <br>[18:35:04]
 
But in the meantime, just neighbors are burning off this sort of energy that comes as you grieve together and taking action and doing what they can practically to help out their ohana.
 
DEAN: Yes.
 
WEIR: Jessica?
 
DEAN: It is amazing to see people coming together in community, that's where you want to be when you're in grief like that, when you're hurting so much. We're certainly wishing them the best. The need is so great there and you really underscored that.
 
Bill, thank you so much for all of that reporting.
 
And as with all natural disasters, pets, also at great risk. It's a reality. My next guest knows very well. Katie Shannon is the Director of Marketing and Communications at the Maui Humane Society. Katie, thanks so much for being with us this afternoon. I know you all are probably incredibly busy right now. Can you walk us through your rescue efforts and how things are going on your end?
 
KATIE SHANNON, DIRECTOR OF MARKETING, MAUI HUMANE SOCIETY: Aloha, Jessica. Yes, as you just saw, Lahaina is in complete devastation. There are still fires burning all over the island. We estimate that there are 3,000 pets that are lost or missing over at - in Lahaina and Maui Humane Society is working with emergency response teams trained in field response from Oahu, vets and surgeons from Oahu, Big Island response, disaster response, international veterinarians without borders, local search and rescue teams working together with Maui Humane Society staff.
 
And we now have veterinary staff over in Lahaina that can provide medical care for these animals with the people that are there together.
 
DEAN: Absolutely. And I have to think, too, you have pets that of course people have in their homes, beloved members of their families that maybe are still missing or injured, burned. Are there also animals that are just on the island that live there that need care as well? SHANNON: Yes, absolutely. We do have reports of cats congregating together over on the west side, some with collars, which means they are owned. We also have reports of dogs running with severe burns in Lahaina and unfortunately, we have reports of death.
 
The community, as mentioned before, just this - the community has come together so beautifully. Right before the fires, we were in what we call SOS foster, which means we are over capacity in our kennels. And what we asked the community to do is take animals from the kennels and place them into their own homes to make space for what we know is going to be inundated with animals that are lost missing or need medical care and that is exactly what the community has done.
 
And so now Humane Society now has the space to care for these animals when they come through.
 
DEAN: And I know that's probably going to be such a process, too, to care for the animals and then also try to reunite them, potentially with their families if they are lost or missing. How does that process work? How do you begin to try to reunite some of these pets?
 
SHANNON: We are asking anyone on island if they have a pet that is lost or missing to file a loss report on our website. That is going to give us the best opportunity to try to match the pet with their owner.
 
We also have a Facebook group that we are trying to connect to community together, because we know that there are people out there that are offering help and we know that there are so many that need help. And that is also on our website mauihumanesociety.org.
 
DEAN: Yes. And I know you talked about - you now have some more space that people have taken in some of the animals that were there. But we know from what we're hearing and what we're seeing is that so many people don't even have homes for themselves anymore. What do you do for these animals that may now need to be adopted if people don't even have homes to go home to?
 
SHANNON: Truthfully, I don't even think we're at that point yet as the fires are still burning. We have only been able to go into Lahaina as of yesterday and it took four hours to go about 30 miles. And so we are now just setting up the emergency response clinics in the areas so that we can address what is the - what the animals need.
 
We are going to have boots on the ground and rescue efforts to help keep any animal alive and reunite them with their families. This is going to be an ongoing effort for weeks, for months, for years. And so the best thing that people can do on the mainland right now is to donate because we do not know what is ahead of us yet because assessments cannot be completed while we are still in tragedy.
 
So we're asking people to donate at mauihumanesociety.org so that we can use those monetary donations for the future.
 
DEAN: Yes, and it is - it's just going to take such a long time. And as you mentioned, like some of the fires still aren't out, you are still very much in an acute phase of all of this. We are sending our best to you. Good luck caring for those animals and trying to help them find their families again.
 
Katie Shannon thanks for being with us.

DEAN: New today, the police chief in Lansing, Michigan issuing an apology after an incident in which a black child was handcuffed and detained by officers while it was taking out the trash behind his home. Let's get right to CNN's Isabel Rosales, who is following the new developments in this for us.
 
Isabel, what's the chief saying here?
 
ISABEL ROSALES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Jessica, the Lansing Police Department is calling this a case of a mistaken identity that the boy was in the wrong place at the wrong time. And in fact, they've released these two pictures showing on one side the suspect that they were looking for and then the boy wearing nearly identical clothing.
 <br>[18:45:06]
 
This is the 12-year-old boy that they mistakenly detained. This story has really blown up nationally because of a TikTok video, a neighbor right here took this video showing the boy in handcuffs. His father later on in the video shouting from a couple of feet away and we also see the police there briefly placing the boy in the back of a police car.
 
Later on once they determined that this is not who they were looking for, they uncuffed the boy and release him back to his father. This video right here had nearly 5 million views and thousands of comments. The boy's father, Michael Bernard, spoke with WILX, a CNN affiliate saying that he was washing dishes and told his son, Tashawn, to take out the trash and here's what he said happened in an off camera interview.

MICHAEL BERNARD: I get concerned when I didn't see him come back within that period of time. And I walk out to here, look out and to my surprise the cops had him in handcuff. I was mad about it, because (inaudible) my son would never do it breaking the law. So I rushed down and asked a cop, what's the problem, why you have my son in handcuff, just like that. (END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ROSALES: And since that interview, the family has spoken out publicly about what happened during the virtual news conference. Meanwhile, we have heard the other side what happened from Lansing police saying that they were searching for a suspect and a string of car thefts and then a witness describe that suspect as having a white shirt and neon shorts and obviously the boy in that scenario match that description. Not only that, but he was in the same apartment complex that the witness described that suspect running off into.
 
The police chief, Ellery Sosebee, has issued an apology in part saying this: "As the Chief of Police, I want to apologize that this incident had such an effect on this young man and his family. I'm asking for the community to consider all of the facts of the situation before making a judgment. The relationship in our community has been and will continue to be a top priority for the Lansing Police Department."
 
Meanwhile, Jessica, the Bernard family has retained an attorney, the attorney saying that the boy in this situation was actually wearing a gray shirt not a white one also saying that he was visibly much younger than the suspect in this scenario. CNN has not independently confirmed the color of the shirt the boy was wearing at the time of the incident and the Bernard family, Jessica, is considering legal action.
 
DEAN: Isabel Rosales for us. Thanks so much.

BIANCO: Many of our restaurants around the country are closed and many of us might not reopen.
 
FLAY (on camera): When you look at big moments like that, how do you face it? What do you do?
 
BIANCO: It was so not in our playbook.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FLAY (voice over): The guy who had started his pizza joint in the back of a grocery store in 1988 had by now expanded to four restaurants in Phoenix, Arizona.

All of a sudden pandemic hits, what do you guys do?
 
BIANCO: It was like a movie that we've never could imagine in this country. It was something that I didn't have a strategy.

DEAN: I've had that pizza. It's very, very good.
 
Recently, Jim Acosta has had a chance to speak with Flay about the challenges that the restaurants encountered during the pandemic, and whether he thought the industry was going to survive.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
FLAY: The people that run restaurants are - they're dedicated, they are focused and they don't give up. Restaurants are so important to the lifeline of this country, because it's not just about feeding people and having a good cocktail, it's the energy.
 
I mean, when restaurants are closed in a city like New York or Los Angeles or any place, it's quiet, it's eerily quiet. But once we get the energy level back in those restaurants and people are opening their restaurants and people are going into the restaurants and the restaurants are full, you can feel the energy, you can feel the noise and it makes every place that it's in that much better.
