ZACHARY WOLF, CNN SENIOR POLITICS WRITER: Oprah. He's, of course, a surgeon. Then he had his own TV show before he ran for Senate. Most recently, he's been selling, you know, some herbal - some - his alternative medicines online. And now he could be in charge of health insurance for more than 160 million Americans. That's almost a third of the country, people who get Medicare, people who get Medicaid. That's a pretty big job for somebody who's never been in administration before. 
 
And it keeps going. I mean Tulsi Gabbard, I looked yesterday, she does have behind - you know, on her resume, she's been on Fox News literally hundreds of times in the past couple of years. She could be the nation's top spy in charge of, you know, the CIA and all these - the NSA, all these other agencies. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. does not have that same relationship with Fox News that the others do, but he did write a bestselling book attacking Anthony Fauci and Bill Gates and alleging all of these conspiracy theories about the U.S. health system that he could now effectively be running. Mike Huckabee, he does not have a Fox News show. He's on a, you know a Christian network. But, you know, this is a theme that he keeps coming back to with all of these picks.
 
JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: Dan Bongino may be the guy to run the Secret Service.
 
WOLF: Right. You know, very critical - former Secret Service agent. Very critical. Had a Secret Service - or had had a Fox News show, but now he's on this, you know, has a podcast. And it shows that this sort of - the web is getting wider than Fox News, into this kind of larger ecosystem of further right-wing media that were seeing. 
 
BERMAN: All right, Zack Wolf, great to see you. Thank you so much for sharing your reporting on all this. 
 
So, a phrase I only learned for the first time this morning, "gate lice." That's people who board with the wrong group at the airport. Kate Bolduan apparently included. This morning, one of the biggest airlines beginning a high-tech crackdown. So, Kate, beware.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:36:46] KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR: New this morning, the FBI says they have foiled a plot to bomb the New York Stock Exchange. This was first reported by the website Court Watch. Now, investigators, they first got a tip in February that a 30-year-old man from Florida was storing, quote/unquote, bomb making schematics in a storage unit. So, an investigation ensued, and they later found sketches and other electronics that could be used for building explosive devices. The FBI says the suspect also told undercover agents he wanted to detonate a bomb at the stock exchange the week before Thanksgiving. And according to court documents, the man told them, quote, "the stock exchange, we want to hit that, because it will wake people up."
 
Also, U.S. wildlife officials are warning that giraffe populations are declining so rapidly they should be considered endangered. Officials say giraffes are disappearing because of a few factors, habitat loss, poaching and drought fueled by the climate crisis. The Fish and Wildlife Service is proposing to make giraffe species either endangered or threatened, which will help, of course, to protect them. 
 
And American Airlines is now cracking down online cutters, making it better, or making it even worse, depending on your view, of boarding zones. The airline is rolling out its new boarding technology to 100 airports nationwide. The entire goal, stop line cutters, which they are giving a misnomer to and calling them "gate lice." 
 
If you board before your assigned group, the technology will make a sound to grab the attention of the gate agent. What happens next, of course, scorn, shame, and ridicule. The company has been stress testing this system over the last month at airports in New Mexico, Arizona and Virginia. TBD if it actually helps planes take off any faster, but it does just stifle harmless rebellion. 
 
Sara. 
 
SARA SIDNER, CNN ANCHOR: Yes, it does. Maybe. Thank you very much, Kate. 
 
All right, developing now, outrage after a father called 911 for help in Las Vegas, but he ended up being the one that police shot and killed. What you're going to see is disturbing. This is body cam video for you now. It is from Las Vegas Police Officer Alexander Bookman's camera. 
 
Investigators say he responded to Brandon Durham's home last week after Durham called to report an intruder who was wearing a red hoodie and facemask inside his home. Officer Bookman found Durham and a woman, it turned out that Durham knew, Alejandra Boudreaux, wrestling over a knife. 
 
You hear the screaming there. The officer telling them to drop the knife. Officer Bookman then fired, hitting Bookman and sending him and his attacker to the ground. Then the body camera footage shows Bookman, which we are not showing you, shooting Durham five more times. You heard that gunfire go off. Durham died at the scene. The officer's attorney says his client didn't violate the law, but Durham's family and their attorney are now demanding answers and an arrest warrant for that officer. 
 
By the way, Durham's teen daughter had to listen to that horrifying scene. She was in her bedroom, hiding, hugging her dog, and afraid for her life.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DIANE WRIGHT, BRANDON DURHAM'S SISTER: My brother called 911 to get assistance with the home invasion.
 <br>[09:40:02]
 
ISABELLA DURHAM, BRANDON DURHAM'S DAUGHTER: My father always feared the police. Even with that fear, he asked me to call the police. And when I grabbed my phone and I handed it to him, that was the last time I saw my father alive. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SIDNER: The woman who broke in, Boudreaux, faces multiple charges. She told police she intended for them to shoot and kill her, not Durham. The family's attorney, Lee Merritt, is joining us now. 
 
My God, these details are beyond disturbing, especially hearing from his daughter.
 
What did you see? We have looked at so many cases. What did you see when you looked at the entirety of that body camera video?
 
LEE MERRITT, ATTORNEY, MERRITT LAW FIRM: I see once again a police force that is not only poorly trained, but they almost seem trained to make the wrong decision.
 
Here, we know that officers in Las Vegas Metro, like officers all around the country, they're trained to make an assessment about the situation that they're in and to only use deadly force when confronted with deadly force themselves. In this situation, there's no argument that the - that Officer Alexander Bookman was in danger, or that he was helping to save life. Instead, he was abusing his power in a way that has really devastated this family and this community.
 
SIDNER: Have the police given you any explanation, and do you have any trust that they will look at this very closely, that they will, you know, really consider whether or not charges need to be filed, especially in that their policies also mandate that the officer ceases firing once the deadly threat is no longer present?
 
MERRITT: Yes. Unfortunately, we haven't given - been given any real reassurance that Las Vegas Metro PD will handle this correctly. Unlike many of the - the - the jurisdictions throughout the country, Las Vegas Metro PD investigates themselves. In other words, there is no one there to supervise what they've done. The investigator who will determine whether or not Alexander Bookman committed a crime is from the Las Vegas Metro Police Department, one of his colleagues. And the decision whether or not he'll be terminated is in an internal affairs decision. This is the least accountable police department that I've come across in my career as a civil rights attorney. 
 
SIDNER: They have been looked at and have been scrutinized by the Justice Department as well. 
 
I want to ask you about Mr. Durham, the woman that he was in some sort of relationship with. She told police she wanted to die. She attacked Durham. She was wearing the hoodie and the facemask. She broke into the home, wielded a knife. How much of the blame did the family put on her for what ended up happening?
 
MERRITT: She bears an enormous amount of the blame for this incident being instigated. Obviously, she is the intruder. We're learning more information as the weeks go on. But we know that there was a previous relationship that law enforcement, even possibly Officer Bookman had been called to the scene before. So, they would have been familiar with the actors. That makes this ten times worse because not only did they receive a description of the intruder that night, someone wearing a ski mask, someone wearing a hoodie, and not only did they have a description of Brandon himself, Mr. Durham himself, but it seems that the law enforcement officers who responded to the scene that night were already familiar with these actors. And that makes the - the firing on the homeowner, in their home, when they made a 911 call, that much less tolerable. 
 
SIDNER: I cannot help but go back to Durham's 15-year-old daughter. Is she being given help? I mean what she experienced is too much to bear for anyone. She is 15. Is she getting help and - and how is she getting through this?
 
MERRITT: It was less than a week ago that she was an earshot away in the hallway that the officer tested in the video - in the body cam video before slaying her father. This is going to be very difficult for her. They have not yet had - made a decision about Mr. Durham's final resting place. Obviously, this case has gotten - garnered national, if not international attention. And so - and her face has been circulated throughout media as she makes a desperate cry for justice, just this past Friday. 
 
She is being plugged in with mental health resources. Unfortunately, she's become a part of a community of people who have endured this kind of trauma. We know that we live in the deadliest police culture in the industrialized world. We see these kind of shootings about three times a day in this country. And so there's a community of people and a process in place to help her process this grief. But one way we can deal with it is by ensuring that Officer Alexander Bookman is held accountable. 
 
SIDNER: Lee Merritt, thank you so much for taking the time to walk through that extremely disturbing case for us. I really appreciate you coming on. 
 <br>[09:45:03]
 
MERRITT: Thank you.
 
SIDNER: All right, if you have been to the airport lately, there is a very good chance you have stood in front of a kiosk to help you speed through security and get on board, or been annoyed by those who are passing you who do that. It works by scanning your so-called biometrics. In other words, taking a good hard look at your facial and body features to make sure it's you. And they're operated by a company called Clear. It's CEO, Caryn Becker, tells me she's got huge plans to use this technology well beyond airports. 
 
Take a listen 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CARYN BECKER, CEO, CLEAR: Today, let's just say you live in L.A. You could use it getting into an Uber for rider verification within the rider app. And then let's say you're going to the Intuit Dome to watch a Clippers game. You can buy beer at the Clippers game with just your face and Clear.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SIDNER: It is supposed to make your life a lot more smoother. Caryn Becker is our view first "Game Changer" in our series. She - see what else she has to say when we share more of the interview tomorrow morning, 9:00 a.m., right here on CNN NEWS CENTRAL. And, by the way, wait till you see just how quick their new technology might get you, Miss Kate, through the security, because I know you like to get to the gate so you can skip other people. 
 
BOLDUAN: Yes. Well, Sara.
 
SIDNER: I'm just saying.
 
BOLDUAN: Stop telling my secrets. 
 
Harmless rebellion, everyone. Harmless rebellion. 
 
How about this one - Sara, here's a (INAUDIBLE). If you're ever in need of a little bit of Christmas, really basically all year round, you know who is always there for you, the Hallmark Channel. Holiday season or not holiday season, it's Hallmark. How about at sea? Now, also, yes, even there. Coming up next, some of the guests, just passengers, now just wrapping up Hallmark's Christmas Cruise. And we're going to talk to them very soon.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Comes a love story -
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hi.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's a real "Christmas Gamechanger." UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, yes, I know who you are.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You do?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, the lucky Christmas hat.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We only get to the Super Bowl if someone in our family wears the hat on Christmas.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, OK.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you not believe me?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I just need to see some of that Christmas magic for myself.
 
OK, that's pretty good.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SIDNER: Oh, it's happening. It's that time of year again. John's favorite time when a woman from a big city moves to a small town and she meets, amazingly, this cute, often wealthy guy and holiday romance ensues. It's just like life. 
 
BOLDUAN: There is no cynicism for - between this.
 
Come on, Sara. 
 
SIDNER: All right. Fine. It's Hallmark Christmas movie season, y'all. We do need some love in our life. If you can't get enough of these romantic holiday movies, Hallmark offered a chance at happily ever after with a Christmas cruise, complete with a meet and greet with some favorite Hallmark heartthrobs. 
 
And we get to talk to several women who just happen to have gotten off that cruise and they are so cruise ready right now you will not believe it. 
 
BOLDUAN: (INAUDIBLE).
 
SIDNER: We love your outfits. 
 
ROSEANN ROGERS, HALLMARK CHRISTMAS CRUISE PASSENGER: Yes, we did.
 
SIDNER: So, we've got Tracy, from left to right, Roseann, Lara and Suzanne.
 
ROGERS: Thank you.
 
SIDNER: Ladies, first of all, how was the cruise? 
 
ROGERS: Yes. Great! We're Christmas-ized (ph). We're ready.
 
LARA BELL,  HALLMARK CHRISTMAS CRUISE PASSENGER: It was - it was amazing. It truly was amazing. And what's funny is, we signed up for this cruise in July of 2023. So, we've been waiting a long time for this cruise.
 
SIDNER: Wow. Did you meet the man of your dreams? 
 
ROGERS: And it was well worth it. And it delivered. Let me tell you. It was unbelievable. 
 
Of course, lots of Hallmark hunks. You got it.
 
BELL: Tons.
 
ROGERS: Yes.
 
BERMAN: Hallmark hunk. I love that.
 
SIDNER: That's good. 
 
ROGERS: They were all there.
 
BELL: We did. They were all there.
 
BOLDUAN: Why (INAUDIBLE).
 
BELL: Yes. Yes. Oh, yes. And not only that, when we were on the cruise, they were looking for a new Hallmark hunk to star in an upcoming movie. So, they were running all these contests for people on the ship. 
 
BOLDUAN: No.
 
ROGERS: There's a new show called "Finding Mr. Christmas," and it's a reality show looking for the next Hallmark hunk. And you've got to watch it. It's really good. Jonathan Bennett is the host. He was actually our host on the cruise. And he did a great job. So, we got to see a lot of things that people haven't seen yet on the Hallmark Channel. 
 
BELL: I think John - I think John needs to apply. 
 
ROGERS: Yes, John, come on.
 
BERMAN: I don't have a lot of free time. 
 
SIDNER: We knew you were going to do that.
 
BOLDUAN: What?
 
BERMAN: I mean I'm free after 10:00 every day. I can be a Hallmark hunk after 10.
 
BOLDUAN: You're a CNC hunk.
 
SIDNER: OK. 
 
BERMAN: All right (ph).
 
SIDNER: Yes. BELL: For sure.
 
BOLDUAN: What - tell me about - what did you guys do on the cruise? 
 
SIDNER: Yes.
 
BOLDUAN: Like, how was this different from other cruises and what is - I have a favorite Hallmark movie, but is there - do you guys have consensus on your favorite one? 
 
ROGERS: Well, there's lots of favorites. We like the - we've got Heidelberg Holiday, Biltmore - the Biltmore Christmas is one of our faves.
 
BELL: Very favorites.
 
ROGERS: And then we got to see a new movie that hasn't even aired yet on the Hallmark Channel called, uh, wait three mile - wait, three - 
 
BELL: Wiser - three wise men -
 
ROGERS: Three wiser men and a boy.
 
BELL: Yes.
 
ROGERS: And it premiers on the Hallmark Channel on -
 
BELL: November 30th.
 
ROGERS: The 23rd. Yes. Yes. It is. It's going to be so fun. So, we did that. But, I mean, what are the other things we did. We did a cookie - we did decorated cookies. We saw lots of Hallmark movies. They even had festive feud, like "Family Feud" but festive feud with some of the cast members, as well as with some of the - our - the cruisers that were on board. We had a wine tasting. Hallmark has a line of wines. We got to sample a lot of their wines.
 
And, oh, tell them about - about the hallways.
 <br>[09:55:04]
 
SIDNER: The wine's taken over, clearly.
 
BELL: So special is everybody decorated their doors (INAUDIBLE) hang on their doors. And so it's just super fun. It's really, really fun to see everybody. And the people watching was amazing. 
 
ROGERS: Yes, it was. And all the outfits, because everyone was in pajamas or Christmas outfits, like ours, of course.
 
BERMAN: My question is, if this were -
 
ROGERS: There - there it is. That's it.
 
BELL: That's the hallways.
 
BERMAN: That's fantastic. That's awesome. 
 
If this were an actual Hallmark special about four friends going on a cruise like this, how would it end?
 
ROGERS: Oh, gosh.
 
BELL: We'd all be in love. 
 
ROGERS: Yes, all be in love.
 
BELL: We'd all be living in a small town.
 
ROGERS: Uh-huh.
 
BELL: I mean, we would all be just super happy.
 
ROGERS: I would open a retail store or a bakery, right? 
 
BELL: I'd be the doctor. I'd be the town doctor.
 
ROGERS: Yes, there you go. There you go. Tracy would be the IT tech person so, you know.
 
BELL: Yes.
 
ROGERS: And Suzanne would be our travel planner because she's the one who actually got us on the cruise. Persistence, let me tell you, ladies, persistence, persistence, persistence. If it wasn't for Suzanne, we would not be standing here today. She did it.
 
SIDNER: Here's the best ending, they're on CNC. That's the real love.
 
BERMAN: That's right. They'd end up on CNN.
 
BOLDUAN: This is where - this is - that is exactly how the Hallmark movie is supposed to end, guys. 
 
SIDNER: With our CNC hunk.
 
BOLDUAN: Absolutely.
 
BERMAN: Roseann, Lara, Tracy and Suzanne, thank you so much.
 
BELL: Yes. Yes.
 
BERMAN: Glad it was so much fun. I have to say, I'm actually a shadow - a big fan of these shows. 
 
BOLDUAN: He is.
 
BERMAN: They only make people smile, and that's a good thing. 
 
BOLDUAN: This is true. I like "Christmas Cookies." 
 
BELL: Oh, I love it.
 
BOLDUAN: That's - that's - that's - no, it's the name of one of the movies. 
 
BELL: That's a good one.
 
BOLDUAN: It's really, really good. 
 
SIDNER: Yes.
 
BOLDUAN: It is really nice to meet you guys. Thank you. 
 
SIDNER: Thank you for joining us. "NEWSROOM" is up next.
