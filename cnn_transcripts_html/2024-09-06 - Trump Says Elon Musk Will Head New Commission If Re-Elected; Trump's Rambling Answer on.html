THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.

JIM ACOSTA, CNN ANCHOR:  If re-elected Former President Donald Trump wants to give Elon Musk a job in his administration, Trump said the world's richest man will be in charge of making suggestions for, quote, "drastic reforms" in the federal government. CNN's Alayna Treene joins us now from New York, where the former president is expected to speak in a couple of hours from now. Alayna, what would Musk be doing?
 
ALAYNA TREENE, CNN REPORTER:  Oh, well, look, this is actually very interesting, Jim, because remember, a couple of weeks ago, Donald Trump and Musk had a conversation on X, formerly known as Twitter. And during that conversation, it was Elon Musk who said, you know, I think you should create some sort of government efficiency commission and said, I would like to lead it to which Trump responded, I love that idea.
 
Well, yesterday at the New York Economic Club during that speech, Donald Trump said that he was going to create this commission and that Elon Musk had agreed to it. Now, there's a couple things here that I want to point out, because given Elon Musk's position, both as the CEO of SpaceX, but also of Tesla, there are some potential conflicts of interest.
 
Now, when you look at SpaceX, he has contracts from the federal government, a potential conflict of interest there. As for his car company, Tesla, that has benefited from tax credits and different government incentives. So, again, there could be some conflicts of interest.
 
But essentially, when we talk to the Trump campaign, when I talk to his advisers, they say they're still working out exactly the details of what this commission would be like, how it would be run, how it would be set up. But essentially, as you mentioned, Jim, they say that it would be targeting government waste and trying to drastically reform many of these agencies and look for ways to cut spending.
 
And really, this was part of a much broader speech yesterday, where it was kind of the first time we heard Donald Trump specifically lay out his economic plans in a way that we really haven't heard him do in the past.
 
ACOSTA:  And speaking of specifics or lack thereof, Trump also took on the rising cost of childcare. What do we hear in terms of that?
 
TREENE:  I don't know if I would say he took it on because he didn't really answer this question. So, after he delivered his remarks he took a couple of questions from members of the Economic Club, one of which asked him, you know, how would you address if elected the rising care of child costs? And Donald Trump kind of gave a jumbled answer. Take a listen to what he said.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Childcare, I want to stay with childcare, but those numbers are small relative to the kind of economic numbers that I'm talking about, including growth, but growth also headed up by what the plan is that I just told you about.
 
We're going to be taking in trillions of dollars. And as much as childcare is talked about as being expensive, it's, relatively speaking, not very expensive compared to the kind of numbers we'll be taking in.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TREENE:  So, Jim, a bit of a confusing answer there. Donald Trump had said that he was committed to addressing the rising childcare costs, but did not offer any specific legislation. I think a lot of people were confused at what exactly he meant with that answer.
 
At one point, he also suggested that perhaps tariffs would could pay for such a thing. And as we know, he does plan to impose sweeping tariffs if elected. But that is something that many economists argue would actually create more inflation. So, I guess let's decide who you want to listen to with that answer. Jim.
 
ACOSTA:  Yes. All right. Yes. Bit of a word salad there. All right. Alayna Treene, thank you very much. You're looking at live pictures right now from Ramstein Air Base in Germany. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is holding a news conference with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Charles Q. Brown Jr. They've been leading a gathering of more than 50 countries providing military aid to Ukraine and its war with Russia.
 
In a rare move, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is attending in person. He's sounding the alarm about a desperate shortfall and promised air defenses as Russia ramps up its bombardments.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT:  The number of air defense systems that have not yet been delivered is significant. This is what was agreed upon and this is what was -- what has not been fully implemented. The world has enough air defense systems to ensure that Russian terror does not have results. And I urge you to be more active in this work with us on air defense.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ACOSTA:  And Secretary Austin also said the Biden administration will announce a new $250 million aid package for Ukraine.
 
Coming up, we have more from our reporter inside the E. Jean Carroll courtroom as Donald Trump fights to appeal a decision from a jury that he sexually abused -- that found he sexually abused and defamed E. Jean Carroll. That's coming up.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:35:00]
 
ACOSTA:  All right. You're looking at some live pictures right now of E. Jean Carroll after that federal court hearing, excuse me, down in Lower Manhattan involving Former President Donald Trump. We're going to step out outside that live picture right now and go to Kara Scannell, who's out of the courthouse right now. Se joins us now, Kara, you were inside, tell us what happened.
 <br>[10:40:00]
 
KARA SCANNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Jim. So, Donald Trump entered the courtroom, and this courtroom is fairly narrow and small as it's set up. So, he had to walk right past E. Jean Carol, who was sitting at the front corner of a table. There was a seat across an aisle that could have placed Donald Trump right next to her, just an aisle separating them about three feet. He instead chose to walk to the far end of that table and sit at that seat. So, giving himself some space between her, there appeared to be no eye contact between the two.
 
Trump sitting during this hearing, which lasted less than 30 minutes, just facing forward, watching the arguments there. His lawyers went on for about 10 minutes. Then Carol's lawyers started their arguments here.
 
Now, Trump's lawyers are trying to get a new trial in this case, saying that the trial judge made mistakes, including by allowing the Access Hollywood tape to be played before the jury. On that tape, Trump is caught on that hot mic, saying how he gropes women and grabs them without their permission, then they also said that the testimony of two other women who came forward and said that Trump had assaulted them one in the 1970s on an airplane and another one down at Mar-a- Lago, they were allowed to testify in this case, Trump's lawyer saying that shouldn't have been permitted.
 
Now, as they began to address the judge, his attorney, John Sawyer, started talking about how this was the quintessential he said, she said, saying that there was no DNA evidence, no police report. One of the appellate judges cut him off and said, we're here to talk about challenges to the evidence not about the other arguments that they want to make about the case. So, he tried to ring this lawyer in and get him to focus on the evidentiary arguments that they're making. And the attorney -- excuse me, the judge telling the attorney that, in fact, it's very difficult to overturn a trial judge's decision on evidence ruling. So, really trying to get him to focus in on these arguments. Part of the arguments that Trump's lawyers are making is that in the 1970s, it wasn't a crime to sexually assault someone on an airplane. Well, E. Jean Carroll's lawyer got up, she said it was a crime to assault anybody on an airplane, and so that should stand, that should be evidence that comes in.
 
So, just a lot of back and forth over that evidence, whether these two women should have been allowed to testify. The judges ended the hearing without making any decision. That will come in due course. Often takes weeks or maybe even months. Donald Trump did not answer any questions by reporters as he left the courtroom. He was in there, though, for just under 30 minutes, and his motorcade has already left as he's making his way back to Trump Tower. Jim.
 
ACOSTA:  Where he is expected to hold a news conference or what they're calling a news conference at noon later today. Kara Scannell outside the courthouse in lower Manhattan, thank you very much.
 
We should note today is the very first day of voting in the 2024 race, as North Carolina is set to mail out early voting ballots. There's just one problem though. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., while he is no longer in the race, Kennedy's name is still on the ballot there and a number of other states. He wants the State of North Carolina to delay its plans until his name can be removed. A judge denied that, but ordered a pause in voting while Kennedy appeals. As of now, the state is still planning on mailing ballots this afternoon.
 
And Robert Brandon joins us now. He is the president and CEO of the Fair Election Center. Robert, good to see you. Can you walk us through the impact of this ballot challenge in North Carolina? And I guess we need to explain the stakes here because North Carolina could be a very close race come November on the presidential ballot.
 
ROBERT BRANDON, PRESIDENT AND CEO, FAIR ELECTION CENTER:  Good morning, Jim. Well, I think we don't really know what the outcome is going to be, but it's going to be decided very quickly. And I'm -- I guess the state is going to send things out and then they can always make a correction if they need to. But I suspect that voters will have mail ballots to look at, you know, within a very short period of time and then they can start making their decisions.
 
ACOSTA:  And North Carolina, help us out here, is not the only state where this is happening. Kennedy also wants his name removed in Michigan and Wisconsin. Other battle -- they're, of course, very close battleground states. Those states have rejected those requests. Is that correct? What's going to be the effect of all of this?
 
BRANDON:  Yes. And I think, you know, this happens in other context too when candidates withdraw after the deadlines of printed ballots and so on. So, I suspect we're going to continue to just see things move forward in a regular way.
 
And of course, mail balloting is an awfully important aspect of voting, particularly in the kind of election we're going to have that's going to be a high turnout election. Voters are really looking for as many options as possible, whether it be vote by mail or early voting.
 
ACOSTA:  And help us out here. It is a very safe and secure way to vote. Is that correct?
 
BRANDON:  Yes. And, you know, we've had 20 to 25 percent of voters have used mail balloting for a number of years. And, of course, it surged to 43 percent during the pandemic. And even last year, a third of all voters used mail-in ballot. It's secure. It -- mail ballots are checked against signatures. Mail ballots have barcodes that link registered voter with the mail that ballot that they get sent and returned.
 <br>[10:45:00]
 
And then they're securely put in a place where they get counted, and it depends on when they get counted, either on election day or after election day. But the other thing is they're very convenient. And I think that's important.
 
We have to remember that a lot of people may be working shift -- they're shift workers and they may work a 12-hour shift as a police officer or RN in an emergency room and they don't have the ability to get to a voting place on Election Day, or they may have childcare issues or they may have travel concerns, or they may have a disability that prevents them from getting to a polling place.
 
So, mail balloting plays an important role. It's very convenient. It eliminates some of the crush on Election Day. It's secure. And it also saves money for local officials who can therefore use less staff on Election Day to staff the polls at that time, because enough people are mailing in their ballots.
 
ACOSTA:  And I did want to ask you about Georgia, where Democrats are suing to block new Republican-backed election certification rules. Those rules allow any local official in Georgia to question results before they are certified and also increase the number of partisan poll watchers. How do you see these changes?
 
BRANDON:  Yes, I think all these changes are troublesome because they're trying to -- they're inserting a partisan tinge to what should be a neutral election. And hopefully, the courts will block that kind of an effort and we'll be able to have a regular election.
 
There are other limits in place, of course, that have more to do with restricting some of the absentee ballots, for example, that we were talking about before. Mail ballots in a number of states now require an I. D. ahead of time. The time to request the ballot may have been pushed earlier. So, you have to make your decision about whether you want to use mail earlier.
 
The time that they have to be received maybe pushed earlier or -- so, for example, Ohio used to allow mail -- it was mailed before Election Day, but came in as late as 10 days to be counted, now it's four days. ACOSTA:  All right. Robert Brandon with the Fair Election Center, thanks so much. Really appreciate it.
 
BRANDON:  Thank you.
 
ACOSTA:  All right. Hard to believe that voting has already begun. In the meantime, coming up, starting the season off on the right foot, or was it? The Chiefs pull off the win against the Ravens in the final seconds all thanks to one toe. Big toe, little toe, it might have been a little one. Our Coy Wire is here. Hey, Coy.
 
COY WIRE, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR:  A totally toe-rific way to start the season. Ravens were this close to taking down a defending champion, Chiefs. We have your highlights and a preview of the first ever NFL game in South America next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:50:00]
 
ACOSTA:  The NFL season opener was not the only thing rocking Arrowhead Stadium on Thursday. Ahead of the showdown between the Kansas City Chiefs and Baltimore Ravens, fans took part in the so- called world's largest tailgate hosted by Rob Riggle. There he is right there. As a diehard Chiefs fan, he also shared this prediction for the upcoming season.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ROB RIGGLE, ACTOR AND COMEDIAN:  This could be the start of one of the most special seasons in football history. So, yes, I'm a little excited. Three peat, that's all I got in my head right now. Three peat, three peat, three peat. I believe it can happen.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ACOSTA:  They want that three peat. And take a look at this. These boots were made for winning. Taylor Swift was at Arrowhead to cheer on her boyfriend, Travis Kelce. Of course, we had to have a Taylor Swift update. Fans were quick to notice the red boots. A nod to the Chiefs. Many Swifties tuning into games, of course, just to see her. One posted -- one post on social media said this, people are complaining that Taylor Swift is ruining NFL coverage. I'd argue she saved the league this year.
 
But it was a toe that saved the Chiefs in a last second thriller sports. Anchor Coy Wire joins me now. Coy, I mean, this was -- I mean, it's amazing that this was starting the NFL season. People think this is a pumpkin spice latte season. It's buffalo chicken season for me.
 
WIRE:  There we go, Jim.
 
ACOSTA:  I'm excited about football being back.
 
WIRE:  Yes.
 
ACOSTA:  And this finish last night, unbelievable,
 
WIRE:  Incredible. Hundreds of millions of fans around the world excited. Football is back. All is right in the world for NFL fans. All sunshine and rainbows, except for the Ravens fans because of that ouch toe. Baltimore scored first, but the Chiefs jabbed back, showing off their new human rocket ship, fastest man in NFL history, rookie Xavier Worthy. A touchdown on their first drive.
 
Then he caught one. He touched the ball three times, Jim. He scored twice. Mahomes went 20 for 28. A touchdown and interception. As for the reigning MVP, Lamar Jackson electric. Game high, 122 yards rushing. A passing TD. And on the final play, setting up the game tying score official says touchdown.
 
Isaiah Likely is dancing. Coach Jim -- or Coach John Harbaugh was like, let's go for the win. Go for two. But look, the Ravens losing the season opener by the tip of that black cleat on the white line. Chiefs win 27-20. Mahomes now 5 and 1 against Jackson's Ravens. The NFL season is starting off with some drama.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LAMAR JACKSON, BALTIMORE RAVENS QUARTERBACK:  I thought it was a touchdown. I thought it was a touchdown, but I still think it's a touchdown.
 
ISAIAH LIKELY, BALTIMORE RAVES TIGHT END:  I say this is probably the worst game we're going to play all year. So, this is the best that they got. I mean, good luck.
 
PATRICK MAHOMES, KANSAS CITY CHIEFS QUARTERBACK:  That's a great football team and I'm sure we'll see them again at some point in the playoffs. So, now, we're happy with the win now. Just got to wear white cleats next time. That's my advice for him.
 <br>[10:55:00]
 
WIRE:  And tonight, a new NFL melodrama titled Love Hurts. Jordan loves Packers. Jalen Hurts' Eagles in Sao Paulo, the NFL's first ever game in South America. On the home field of the soccer club Corinthians, the Eagles are technically the home team, nearly 5,000 miles from Philly. Packers quarterback Jordan Love says the players have been feeling nothing but love.
 
It's going to be an awesome weekend. And I do have to show you this video, Jim, if we can real quick, just dance and the Eagles players kind of looks like you after work on a Friday. It's setting up to be quite another incredible night for the always entertaining NFL.
 
ACOSTA:  Man, oh, man. They're just taking over the world right now. Unbelievable. And I got a feel for the Ravens in that toe. Man, oh, man. That is brutal stuff. But we're going to be watching tonight. Good stuff. As always, Coy Wire, thank you so much.
 
And thanks for joining us this morning. I'm Jim Acosta. I'm going to watch some football this weekend. Our next hour with Newsroom with Wolf Blitzer starts after a short break. Have a great weekend.
