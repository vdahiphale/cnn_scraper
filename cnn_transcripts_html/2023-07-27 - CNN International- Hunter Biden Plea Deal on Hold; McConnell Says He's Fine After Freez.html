ANNOUNCER: Live from London, this is CNN NEWSROOM with Max Foster and Bianca Nobilo. 
 
FOSTER: It is Thursday, July 27, 9:00 a.m. here in London, 4:00 a.m.in Wilmington, Delaware, where a U.S. federal judge has left President Biden's son in legal limbo. Hunter Biden is facing two federal tax charges. He was hoping to finalize a plea deal that would have kept him out of prison but the judge wasn't convinced. And now Biden and his lawyers are now getting back into -- to the drawing board really to try to salvage the agreement. CNN's Sara Murray has the story. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SARA MURRAY, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): After a tumultuous day in federal court Hunter Biden left with no plea deal -- after a federal judge said she was not ready to accept it. President Joe Biden's son arrived at federal court prepared to plead guilty to two misdemeanor tax charges, and to strike a deal to avoid a felony gun charge. After a five-year Justice Department probe that Hunter Biden once predicted, he would emerge from unscathed.
 
HUNTER BIDEN, PRESIDENT BIDEN'S SON: I am absolutely certain, 100 percent certain that at the end of the investigation that I will be cleared of any wrongdoing.
 
MURRAY (voice-over): Instead, Judge Maryellen Noreika, a Trump appointee, wanted to know if the investigation was over. Prosecutors told her it was ongoing. Then the two sides could not agree if Hunter Biden was at risk of additional charges if he took this deal. With that, the deal was derailed. Eventually Hunter Biden's team agreed he was not shielded from further charges, and the deal seemed, for a moment, back on track.
 
But then the judge raised questions about the gun deal. Is this even constitutional, she asked. And she said she was not ready to sign off on the deal.
 
The hearing ended with Hunter Biden in a pro forma move, pleading not guilty. The courtroom drama providing another opening for Republican lawmakers who slammed the plea agreement.
 
REP. CHIP ROY (R-TX): At least there's some scrutiny going on. The plea deal we saw as it started was garbage.
 
SEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R-MO): Hunter Biden is getting a sweetheart deal that no other American who wasn't rich or had a father as a president would ever get ever.
 
MURRAY (voice-over): Republicans already seeking more information about the Hunter Biden probe after two IRS whistleblowers who worked on the case claimed there was political interference dating back to the Trump administration and continuing under the Biden administration.
 
GARY SHAPLEY, IRS WHISTLEBLOWER: There should not be a two-track justice system depending on who are you are and who you're connected to.
 
MURRAY (voice-over): The White House reiterating that the president stands by his son but played no role in the investigation.
 
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: This case was handled independently, as all of you know, by the Justice Department under the leadership of a prosecutor appointed by the former president, President Trump. 
 
MURRAY (voice-over): The plea deal was set to cover Hunter Biden's tax transgressions over a five-year span, his drug issues and his firearm possession charge. Prosecutors say Hunter Biden failed to pay between $1.1 million and $1.5 million in federal taxes. And they highlighted his substantial income from Ukrainian and Chinese energy companies, saying, he did in fact have the funds available to pay his taxes in certain years, but he failed to do so. Instead, prosecutors say he spent wildly on personal luxuries and expenses. 
 
MURRAY: Now our team was in the courtroom for this wild hearing, said as it was wrapping up and the judge did address Hunter Biden and said, I know you wanted to resolve this, I'm sorry. But she said she has to be careful in how she is handling it. So it is clear that at least for now, Hunter Biden's legal woes are not over, neither of course with his political woes.

FOSTER: There's grave concern about the health of the U.S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell. He froze in the middle of speaking during his weekly news conference on Wednesday. Now sources tell CNN that McConnell has fallen multiple times this year. 
 <br>[04:05:00]
 
At least two of the incidents weren't reported until now. But the 81- year-old is brushing off concerns about his health. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: How are you feeling now, sir? 
 
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): I'm fine. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Have you seen a doctor? Are you going to see a doctor? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Any idea what happened? 
 
MCCONNELL: I'm fine. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Dehydrated?
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: CNN's Melanie Zanona has details from Washington. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MELANIE ZANONA, CNN CAPITOL HILL REPORTER: Well Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell says he's fine after a scary health episode on Wednesday afternoon. The incident occurred during Mitch McConnell's weekly press conferences. This is a press conference that he gives routinely in the Capitol to reporters. And as he was giving his opening remarks, he stopped midsentence and froze for over a good 20 seconds without blinking before Senator John Barrasso who is actually a former physician came over to check on him. At that point Mitch McConnell was then ushered away by aides and Senators to the sidelines. Let's watch that moment. 
 
MCCONNELL: After finishing the NDA this week, been good bipartisan cooperation and a string of -- 
 
SEN. JOHN BARRASSO (R-WY): Are you finished? Anything else you want to say? So let's go back here. Do you want to say anything else to the press? Let's go back. 
 
ZANONA: Now McConnell did come back to the podium after about 12 minutes and he took multiple questions from reporters including our Manu Raju. And when asked whether he was OK, Mitch McConnell said that he was fine. His office also later put out a statement saying that the Senator just felt lightheaded and we need to step away for a moment. But that he was able to come back and was sharp. 
 
And we should also note that Mitch McConnell since that moment has been conducting some of his routine business. He's been making calls and we're also told that he melt with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy for one of their weekly meetings. 
 
But we should point out, this is not the first health scare that Mitch McConnell has experienced this year. In March he tripped and fell and hit his head. He was diagnosed with a concussion and a few broken ribs and he was out for a few weeks in the Senate. And I can also tell you just from observing him over the last few weeks, he's been acting differently. He's been talking a little bit softer, walking a little bit more slowly. And last month he also struggled to hear some questions that were clearly audible from a reporter. So the issue of health has been top of mind for Mitch McConnell, but his colleagues wishing the 81-year-old Senator well.

FOSTER: By any measure, Rudy Giuliani's confession is stunning. The former Trump lawyer and New York City Mayor has now admitted he defamed two Georgia election workers with blatant smears. The workers are suing Giuliani for repeatedly wrongly asserting that they stuffed ballot boxes with fake votes during the 2020 election. Giuliani says the women weren't damaged by his statements but here's what they told the January 6 committee. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
RUBY FREEMAN, GEORGIA ELECTION WORKER: I've lost my name and I've lost my reputation. I've lost my sense of security all because a group of people starting with number 45 and his ally Rudy Giuliani decided to scapegoat me and my daughter Shaye. SHAYE MOSS, GEORGIA ELECTION WORKER: I don't want to go anywhere. I
 
 second guess everything that I do. It has affected my life in a major way, in every way. All because of lies. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: Mother and daughter say they have felt fear and guilt and have received death threats. Including one saying, be glad 2020 and not 1920. An apparent allusion to era of lynchings in the southern U.S. Now Giuliani argues his statements are protected as free speech even though he doesn't contest that they were false. 
 
African leaders arriving in St. Petersburg, Russia for a summit with President Vladimir Putin. They are expected to ask for concrete promises on grain supplies after Russia withdrew from the Black Sea grain initiative earlier this month. 
 
Wheat prices have risen by about 25 percent in less than two weeks. Some leaders also want clarity from the Russian president on the future of the Wagner mercenary group in Africa after its short-lived mutiny in Russia last month. Wagner provides security for a few African countries. 
 
Ukraine has been stepping up its counteroffensive with more troops and new pushes in critical areas. U.S. officials say after being held in reserve for weeks, the bulk of Ukrainian forces are now deployed. Among Ukraine's goals is retaking the battered city of Bakhmut. 
 <br>[04:10:00]
 
This footage appears to show heavy impacts on Russian positions as Ukrainian forces advanced from the south. CNN's David McKenzie is standing by for us in Johannesburg, but we begin though with Clare Sebastian right here in London. What standing out for you today, Clare? 
 
CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: So Max, the counteroffensive has essentially been going on since the beginning of June. But it's really just in the last few days that after several weeks of really not hearing much about any movements on the frontlines, we're starting to see progress on the Ukrainian side. 
 
Clearly the goal or one of the key goals is still to try to cut the land bridge between Crimea and Bakhmut by Donbas region. And we're seeing and happening on two axes. I don't know if we have that map that we can pull up there. But they appear -- according to Russian sources -- to have launched what they are calling a major offensive. You can see it there, just south of the town of Velyka towards Melitopol, which is still occupied by Russia. 
 
That would give them access to the sea of Azov, which of course would meet that goal. That is one of the most heavily fortified areas on the frontlines. So they've really had to spend weeks and weeks picking through those mine fields and things like that. Further east just south of the town of Velkka Novosylka, we're hearing about progress from the Ukrainian forces around a settlement there along a river which they have been pushing down since the site of the counteroffensive. 
 
And then around Bakhmut, they're still trying to encircle the Russian Forces in there. But again, saying that they are making progress toward the south of the city. So we're talking small settlements, Max. We're talking some of the settlements that they're trying to fight for are basically three streets in the middle of agricultural land. 
 
So it is slow progress, but we are seeing momentum. And of course, U.S. officials are telling us that Ukraine has committed now the bulk of its forces which of course does ramp up the pressure to make progress. 
 
FOSTER: OK, Clare, thank you. 
 
David, a key meeting between African leaders and the Russian government because, you know, so much is being felt in Africa as a result of this conflict. And then we have this Wagner issue as well. 
 
DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well the grain deal is certainly not well timed for Vladimir Putin on the eve of the summit, pulling out of that Black Sea deal because in an indirect way it does affect many African countries because of the prices, the rising as you described. 
 
Now on the eve of that deal, Vladimir Putin railed on the grain deal as he has many times before. I think to try and dissuade some of the criticism that will come from African leaders. He said that it was solely for the enrichment of European countries and companies and while much of that grain in the grain deal was going to European nations, that price impact is certainly going to be felt here on the continent. 
 
This is an important meeting. It's also very important meeting for Putin because of the optics. Having these world leaders in St. Petersburg. It's the largest gathering of its kind since the Ukraine war started in Moscow for Putin. And to get up on the stage with those leaders, though it must be said many haven't shown up this year, around 17 heads of state are going. This is an important propaganda moment for the Russian leader. And we will see if any concrete moves come out on the grain deal and also on this much touted, from the African point of view, Russia and African peace initiative I should say. 
 
You saw African leaders in Ukraine and in Russia some time ago trying to push forward a negotiated settlement to the war in Ukraine, that really didn't get anything concrete going. But they are trying to continue saying that countries like South Africa and others may play a role in any eventual peace negotiations because of what they say is the nonalignment on the issue of this war -- Max. 
 
FOSTER: OK, David and Clare, thank you both very much indeed for that. 
 
Now more than 114 million people are under heat alerts across much of the U.S. Temperatures continue to climb dangerously high in the Southwest. But states on the East Coast will also see their warmest temperatures of the year this week. CNN meteorologist Chad Myers has the latest forecast. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Well the unrelenting heat that has been in the desert Southwest part of the United States is now sliding off to the east just a little bit with tens of millions of people under either heat advisories or in the case of New York City, excessive heat warnings with the heat index over 105 degrees Fahrenheit. 
 
Over the next few days another 170 record high temperatures are going to be broken across the U.S. The good news is with this latest heatwave for the East Coast, Chicago, you're only warm for a couple days. Even for D.C., only three days before you get a cold front to come by and knock you down from 98 to 85. That's a pretty good temperature drop with a cold front coming down from the north. We'll take it.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE) 
 
FOSTER: Thanks to Chad.
 
Now dozens of new wildfires are cropping up across southern Europe fueled by an unrelenting heatwave. 
 <br>[04:15:00]
 
We're going to come to hat in a moment. But apparently, we've got President Putin speaking at the African Summit. Can we tune in to see -- do we have any translation? 
 
Vladimir Putin, Russian President (through translator): -- in the G-20 hopefully it will be approved in October during the G-20 summit. As before Russia is working towards strengthening the sovereignty of the African countries. Making sure that Africa will become one of the key partners in the new multi-polar world order. 
 
These issues are bringing our attention and we will discuss the practical decisions on increasing our trade and economic cooperations, food security, development of the work towards many directions which will give and impulse to the declaration of the second summit, Russia, Africa. And plan of action of Russia, European Union for 2024. 
 
Despite the difficulties connected to the pandemic and illegitimate sanctions, we managed to increase our trade and economy connections. Last year trades amassed up to $18 billion, which was an increment of 35 percent. Russia still is a reliable supplier he of food to Africa. Back in 2022, Russia exports of this particular type of food was increased even more. 
 
Many Russian companies work in Africa. Key areas of cooperation is energy supplies, agriculture. We have good opportunities to cooperate in education, science and cultural spheres. We pay great attention at developing our relations with the Union of Comoros which is based on mutual respect and have the potential to be developed in many directions. Of course, we are open in any directions to cooperate with your country. Thank you for your attention. FOSTER: President Putin welcoming African leaders to St. Petersburg
 
 there. All of them very keen to hear that they will be able to get the grain supplies much needed that to travel from Ukraine and Russia into Africa. But also very keen I think, Clare, to hear how Wagner -- there's lots of Wagner fighters, you know, we know a lot of Wagner fighters operating in in Ukraine but they are also lots operating in Africa. And you know, we don't know how that's going to play out with Prigozhin, the leader, currently in Belarus. 
 
SEBASTIAN: Yes, providing security alongside sort of unofficial way of fostering Russia's goals in Africa. Wagner, I think people are looking after that failed rebellion to see how they continue to operate in Africa. Prigozhin himself has said that they plan to do so. Obviously it's a big money for Yevgeny Prigozhin as well. So that's one thing. 
 
I think food supplies are critical. President Putin has said that he plans to provide it commercially and free of charge to Africa. He's not flushed out that plan. But apparently Russia plans to step in where Ukraine can no longer provide those supplies. He said Russia just now continues to be a reliable provider to Africa, but he hasn't provided any details as of yet. 
 
FOSTER: OK, we'll keep watching that and we'll get back to you. We've also got David McKenzie actually. He's live in Johannesburg. You were able to catch some of that too, David? 
 
OK. He's not there. We'll come back to it -- oh, he is there. David, can you hear me? 
 
MCKENZIE: Yes, I can, Max. Sorry, we're just jumping back on set. What I do think is important here is the optics again of Vladimir Putin with those African leaders at that round table. And what he is really pushing is the trade relationships between Russia and African nations. Again talking about the ability of Russia to provide food and trade to the continent. 
 
You've had this period over the last few years, not withstanding the war in Ukraine, of Russia getting much more involved in multiple countries on the continent, both through its official channels and attempting to bolster trade. 
 <br>[04:20:00]
 
But also through the mercenary group Wagner which is deeply involved in security in countries like Central African Republic and Mali. 
 
Now that involvement has been criticized. Just yesterday the U.S. parliamentary group -- foreign affairs group, deeply criticized the U.K. government for not paying attention to the expansion of Wagner on the continent. That's not something of course that Putin will speak about in St. Petersburg because of the controversy. What he's trying to do is to push the importance of Russia on the African nations where they are involved -- Max. 
 
FOSTER: OK. David, thank you. Also Clare. 
 
Now still the to come on CNN NEWSROOM --

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you had one, you captured one, you reverse engineer it, you got it to work, you are talking something that could go into space, go someplace, drop down in a matter of seconds, do whatever it wants and leave and there's nothing we can do about it. Nothing.

FOSTER: Science fiction becomes a reality as U.S. lawmakers push for more intel on UFOs. We'll go to Washington for the latest on that hearing. 
 
Plus, the U.S. Federal Reserve raises interest rates for the 11th time in the past year and a half. It appears more hikes are on the way as well. 
 
Plus, a possible blow to the fight against Islamic insurgency in Africa. A key U.S. ally is apparently no longer in power, ousted by his own military officers.
 <br>[04:25:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: Dozens of new wildfires are cropping up across southern Europe fueled by an unrelenting heatwave. The Greek fire service reported 61 new fires in the past day alone. They are spreading in central Greece killing two people on Wednesday and threatening the country's main agricultural hub. Parts of the country reached 46 degrees Celsius on Wednesday. 
 
Italy is also seeing some of the highest temperatures in Europe right now. Ten fires are burning in the south of the country. Four elderly people died on Tuesday. Nada Bashir joins me from Rome. It does seem as though, according to some of the forecasts, that the heatwave is ending but that, you know, everything is still so dry. 
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER: Yes, absolutely. We are learning from local authorities that those temperatures are beginning to drop. That is sign of hope of course for these regions which have been experiencing the worst of these heat -- extreme events and in particular of course the wildfires that we have seen across the Mediterranean. 
 
Here in Italy, as you mentioned, ten wildfires are trying to be contained in the southern region. In Sicily in particular we have seen devastation wrought by the fires. Some 2,000 people were forced to be evacuated from their homes earlier in the week as a result of those fires coming dangerously close to residential areas. 
 
The authorities there say the vast majority of those evacuated have now been able to return home. And actually in the last couple of hours we've learned from local authorities that the fire alert level has been downgraded across Sicily. So certainly a sign of hope there. But we heard from the Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. She said
 
 that these fires, these extreme heat events, have really put Italy to the test. She has said that the government is committing all resources at its disposal. But the government has stopped short of declaring a state of emergency. There is something that many regions have been requesting at this stage. It is still under consideration. 
 
But look, this is happening across the region and the warning from the experts is that this is only going to become the new normal unless changes are made urgently -- Max. 
 
FOSTER: OK, Nada live in Rome, thank you. 
 
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is joining the chorus of condemnation after an apparent military coup in Niger. A group of military officers announced on Wednesday night that President Mohamed Bazoum had been ousted. His election two years ago was a historic first for the African nation. And there's a concern now that his removal could be a major drag on the fight against Islamic insurgency in the region. 
 
CNN's Larry Madowo joins us now from Nairobi. What are you looking at here -- Larry? 
 
LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Max, there's still time to figure out exactly the location of President Mohamed Bazoum. The foreign minister there says that he is now the acting head of government. That he's spoken to President Bazoum and he is well. He has not been harmed. But we do not know where he is. 
 
Because what happened is this Wednesday, uncertainty where the president was reported to have been detained by the presidential guard around the presidential palace. He tweeted the official account of the president, he tweeted that he was well and that some members of the presidential guard had been involved in an anti-Republican event in vain and would be dealt with. 
 
And then we see the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken talking to him, saying that he assures him of their support of the United States as the democratically elected president of Niger. In fact, Antony Blinken became the first U.S. Secretary of State back in March to visit Niger to highlight the progress that the country was making. And then Wednesday night, this -- many military fatigues on state TV. 
 
COLONEL MAJOR AMADOU ADRAMANE, NIGER ARMY SPOKESMAN (through translator): Brought together by national council for the safe guarding of the country, we have decided to put an end to the regime that you know. This follows the continuing deterioration of the security situation and poor economic and social governance.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
MADOWO: This democratic back sliding further complicates the security situation in the Sahara. Niger has been a key part of the west security strategy in that region when it's surrounded by Mali and Burkina Faso where he had his presence quite strong. So what happens now is a big headache and a problem for the African Union and the economic community of the West African states -- Max. 
 
FOSTER: OK, Larry in Nairobi, we'll be back with you as you get more. Thank you for joining us. 
 
And now big economic numbers due out today in the U.S. when the Commerce Department releases its estimate of U.S. GDP in the second quarter. Many analysts expect it'll to be similar to the first quarter, which shows the U.S. economy is on track to grow about 2 percent this year. But that could be stronger than the Federal Reserve would like as it battles to bring down inflation. We are closely watching to see how the markets react to those figures. 
 
Wall Street has been on a roll recently with the Dow racking up 13 straight days of gains for the first time since 1987. Investors shrugged off yesterday's quarter point hike by the Fed.
