JIM ACOSTA, CNN ANCHOR: You are live in the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington. Good evening. 
 
New drama and a new deadline. And a new legal ruling in the latest indictment of Donald Trump. The federal judge overseeing Trump's election fraud case has responded to a court filing from Special Counsel Jack Smith late last night. Smith wants a protective order after Trump posted this last night. It says, quote, "If you go after me, I'm coming after you." 
 
Smith wants the judge to stop Trump and his legal team from publicly discussing sensitive evidence and he's citing that social media post as one reason why. And the judge has now given the Trump team until 5:00 p.m. Monday to respond. A short time ago the judge denied their request to push back that deadline. Smith had called it an unnecessary delay. 
 
Joining us now to talk about this is Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat who served on the January 6th Select Committee. 
 
Congresswoman, thanks very much for joining us. We appreciate it. Your sense of what has been taking place over the last 24 hours, the special counsel is asking the judge to issue this protective order to restrict Trump and his lawyers from publicizing sensitive evidence. And they're noting this social media post that came from Trump yesterday evening essentially leveling a threat. An unspecified generic threat. But I supposed some could infer that he was trying to send a warning to people involved in this case. 
 
REP. ZOE LOFGREN (D-CA): Well, yes, it certainly is an obvious reading of that. He's coming after people. Now I understand some of his supporters said it was in a political sense. But any ordinary person reading that would come to the conclusion that he would be coming after people he perceived as opposed to him. I think seeking this protective order is not unusual. There's a protective order already in the documents case in Miami. And it's not uncommon in criminal cases. 
 
If the special prosecutor is going to share all the evidence with the defendant, which is what he wants to do promptly, he needs to be sure that that won't be put out there in the public to intimidate witnesses, make people afraid to speak. And we do know that the ex- president has a record of threatening and demeaning other judges, their families, lawyers who are prosecuting. So this is not something that is just out of the air. 
 
And I think the special prosecutor has a legitimate concern that people who might speak up or would be afraid, that witnesses' testimony would be chilled. It doesn't prevent the president from speaking. It just prevents him from publicizing the evidence that he receives from the special prosecutor. 
 
ACOSTA: And is it your sense, Congresswoman, based on your work with the January 6th Committee that the former president is just going to start playing these kinds of game and that it may dove tail somewhat with his defense team's legal strategy. If the former president can go out there and stir up a hornet's nest like he did with this social media post and it props the special counsel to say to the judge, we need some kind of protective order in this case. 
 
You can see where I'm going with this. The former president can continue to do this from now until there's a trial, and that would play right into his playbook, as you know all too well, of delay, delay, delay when he gets into legal hot water. 
 
LOFGREN: Well, his game is delay. We know that from the way he dealt with us in the January 6th Committee. Always delaying matters, trying to prevent them from being heard. But I think it's interesting that the trial judge in this case didn't allow a delay. I mean, the answer has to be filed by day after tomorrow. Trump's lawyers asked for an extension. She denied it. And so a decision will be made quite soon. 
 
He's not going to be able to engage in unreasonable delay unless the trial court judge goes along with it, and that's not her reputation. She's no nonsense. 
 
ACOSTA: And just a day -- I mean, just a day after this arraignment, and this third criminal indictment, Trump was joking that four may be his lucky number. Here's what he said at a rally last night. 
 <br>[19:05:12]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Every time they file an indictment we go way up in the polls. We need one more indictment to close out this election, one more indictment, and this election is closed out. Nobody has even a chance. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ACOSTA: It's true that Trump has remained the GOP front runner despite these legal problems, and he seems to relishing all of these indictments coming his way. There may be another one coming in this case in Fulton County, Georgia. What is your reaction to what he is saying? 
 
LOFGREN: Well, I don't know what to make of it. I guess he believes that his supporters are further energized when he's charged with a crime. I think that's kind of weird. But perhaps it's true. It has nothing to do with what the wheels of justice have to do. If prosecutors feel that he and have evidence to support that he's committed a crime, they have to charge that. They can't weigh the politics of this thing. 
 
Now it's pretty clear, I mean, he doesn't have strong defenses on many of these indictments. It looks like his biggest defense is to try and get elected and pardon himself. So that's another factor I think that's going on here. 
 
ACOSTA: And how much of you committee's work contributed to this latest indictment? When you read the special counsel's indictment, did you see a lot of the committee's work essentially showing up, this very important document from the special counsel? 
 
LOFGREN: Yes. I did, actually. Starting at the beginning, it was the tale that we were able to tell through the evidence we uncovered almost completely. There were a few things that we did not uncover. For example, Mike Pence would not talk to us so we didn't know he'd taken contemporaneous notes. We didn't know that the president said he was too honest when he refused to go along with the president in overturning the election. 
 
We didn't know that there was a discussion about calling out the army to American cities if he succeeded in overturning the election. But for the most part, the scheme that the president, then president was at the center of, the multifaceted effort to overturn the election was what we uncovered. And I think it probably was of help to the special prosecutor. Obviously he would have to interview the witnesses himself. 
 
He couldn't rely on our interviews. But it looks like he went ahead and did that. And it was a pretty quick process for a federal investigation. Really less than a year. And now we have these very serious allegations that have been filed. 
 
ACOSTA: And what is your sense of what the former vice president said to the special counsel that appeared in the indictment, that former Trump essentially told Mike Pence, you're too honest? Does that say to you that you would have loved to have had him speak to the January 6th Committee? I guess that's one of my questions. But it also, doesn't it set the table, Congresswoman, for the former vice president to be perhaps the star witness, or one of the star witnesses, at the former president's trial in this? 
 
LOFGREN: Well, possibly. I mean, when I read that, the first thing I thought was, you know, number one, Pence refused to lie and to violate his oath. We already knew that. But, you know, the president was asking him to be dishonest, and I think it was really in essence to ask and to be part of the president's dishonest scheme. It's almost an admission of dishonesty on the part of Trump. 
 
Yes, we would have liked to have heard from the vice president, although we did hear from his people and learned a lot. The other witness we don't know about, it doesn't look like Mark Meadows fits the description of any of the co-conspirators that are mentioned in the indictment. Now I don't know whether something about him is going to come later or whether he's a witness. If he is a witness, he knows a great deal. 
 
And we did try to speak to him. I mean, he was with Trump throughout the riot, at every step of the way, as the plot was made. So he has a lot of information. 
 
ACOSTA: And if you're the Special Counsel Jack Smith I assume, Congresswoman, Mark Meadows is somebody you want taking the witness stand. 
 <br>[19:10:05]
 
He was -- he did cooperate to some extent with the January 6th Committee until he stopped. He provided your committee with a lot of those very important texts which revealed a lot of information. I have to imagine that the special counsel's office has that information as well. But Mark Meadows appears to be one of these individuals who could just be a fountain in the information for the special counsel in making this case. 
 
LOFGREN: Well, of course we wanted to talk to him. I've never really understood why he provided all of these documents, text messages and the like, and then decided not to cooperate. What happened? Whether President Trump, then President Trump prevailed upon him, I just don't know. Obviously, the information he did provide was very enlightening and we certainly wanted to follow up with him by interviewing him but we were unable to do that. If Jack Smith is able to do that, I believe he will find out a lot. 
 
ACOSTA: All right. Thanks so much, Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren, really appreciate your time. 
 
LOFGREN: Thank you. You have a good weekend. 
 
ACOSTA: All right. You as well. 
 
A number of Trump's defenders have started attacking America's democratic institutions. Next, a closer look at how right-wing media is reacting to the Trump indictments. 
 
And later on, it's win or go home for the U.S. Women's Soccer Team at the World Cup. They've struggled a bit so far. So how will they take down Sweden in tomorrow's big match. It's a win or go home moment. Soccer great Brandi Chastain will join us live to break it all down. So stay tuned for that. 
 
You're live in the CNN NEWSROOM. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[19:15:48]
 
ACOSTA: Donald Trump's defenders are using increasingly provocative language not to condemn the former president's behavior but to attack America's democratic institutions. In fact if you watch right-wing media, you might come away with a very different understanding of the indictments and the accusations against Trump. 
 
CNN's senior media reporter Oliver Darcy joins us now. 
 
Oliver, what do you think? Are networks like FOX normalizing Trump's actions, misleading their viewers, a little bit of both? What do you think? 
 
OLIVER DARCY, CNN SENIOR MEDIA CORRESPONDENT: That's exactly what they're doing, Jim. If you were to turn on FOX News or just listen to right-wing media, whether it's talk radio or visiting sites like Breitbart, you would see dark and really sinister language being used to describe these indictments. In that world, Joe Biden is an evil force. I don't say that lightly. He's an evil force in that world and he's nefariously using the Department of Justice as a weapon to target and unjustly potentially imprison his political opponent. 
 
Now of course, this is not what's happening. But in that world, millions of people are immersed. And so they're walking away with a very different picture of what's taking place with these Trump indictments. And it's really worrisome because this is the type of rhetoric of course that potentially leads to violence. When people feel the democratic institutions have been taken over by autocrats, people who don't believe in democracy, who have overthrown the democratic institutions and weaponized them, that's what leads to them taking action into their own hands. 
 
And that's what you saw after January 6th when people felt the election was stolen. And it raises alarm whether something similar could happen as Trump is prosecuted for these various charges, if people feel that the justice system is no longer representing American justice but has been weaponized and is, you know, at the hands of a tyrant. 
 
ACOSTA: Well, and we've been talking about this throughout this program that just 24 hours after the arraignment, Trump has already started to engage once again in this sort of incitement, this language that he's been using on social media. If you come after me, we're going after you. And, you know, that just raises alarm bells all over again like we saw in the days before January 6th when he was saying, you know, this could be wild. 
 
I mean, he does have an effect on his followers out there. And you know, what is remarkable about what you're saying about FOX is that FOX executives are said to be pressing Trump to take part in this first Republican debate. What are you hearing about that? 
 
DARCY: Well, Jim, the remarkable thing about this all is that FOX is so firmly in Trump's corner. I mean, they are dishonestly carrying his talking points to their millions of viewers. And Trump seems to not like FOX very much these days. He doesn't think it's sufficiently loyal. And so over the past year, you've seen him attack FOX News, attack Rupert Murdoch, say the channel is basically becoming a leftist network which is of course preposterous. So FOX News now is hosting the first Republican debates later this
 
 month and Trump is effectively floating the idea of skipping it. Refusing to participate. And so you have FOX News executives, the president Jay Wallace and the chief executive Suzanne Scott, they dined with Trump on the night of his third indictment and they tried to persuade the Republican frontrunner to participate in their debate. 
 
But he's no longer seemingly a fan of that network and I think from his point of view, you know, he's leading the Republican field by a substantial number. So perhaps he's thinking, why risk that, why put that at risk by going on stage with people who are trailing him significantly. 
 
ACOSTA: Yes. I mean, it sounds like a ploy to make FOX more Trumpy, despite that huge settlement that they had to pay out to Dominion voting systems. It's remarkable to see the executives were having dinner with him the other night. Just incredible stuff. 
 
Oliver Darcy, great reporting as always. Thank you very much. 
 
In a new article for "The Atlantic," the senior editor Ron Brownstein writes, "Trump's threat to democracy is now systemic. Each time GOP leaders have had the opportunity to move away from Trump, the party has sped past the off ramp." 
 <br>[19:20:06]
 
And CNN senior political analyst Ron Brownstein joins us now. 
 
Ron, why do you say that indicting Trump could be a necessary step toward containing this threat to American democracy. It seems that perhaps convicting him might also be a necessary step. 
 
RON BROWNSTEIN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Necessary but not sufficient. I mean, the threat that Trump has created and poses to American democracy is probably the most serious we have seen since the Civil War. Since the years that came before the Civil War. But it's gone way beyond him. You know, I mean, we certainly saw in 2020, Republicans in the key state who are closest to administering the election, by and large defended the integrity of their own state elections, and we saw that there were people immediately around Trump who are now raising alarms, certainly more visibly than they did back in 2020. People like Bill Barr and Mark Esper. 
 
But in between the vast majority of both elected officials and rank- and-file Republican voters, have lined up behind Trump. I mean, we forget that the vast majority of House Republicans in 2020 voted to overturn the election, to reject the election results. Something like two-thirds of the Republican attorneys general joined a spurious lawsuit to overturn the election results. We see in the CNN polling 70 percent of Republican voters still say that Joe Biden was illegitimately elected. And now 60 percent say they describe January 6th as legitimate protest. 
 
This is a broad strain now in the party and it really does cause you to question whether if Trump is the nominee and loses in November, whether there would be any more resistance in the Republican Party than there was in 2020 to him trying to overturn the election in anything short of another full-scale physical assault on the Capitol itself. 
 
ACOSTA: And you write that the germ of election denialism has spread so far throughout the Republican Party. You were just laying that out a few moments ago. Will it ever go away? 
 
BROWNSTEIN: Well, look, I think the election denialism is rooted in the -- tied to the core divide in American politics. I believe since really for the last 15 years or so, the fundamental fissure between the two parties is between those who are comfortable with the way the country is changing demographically, culturally, and economically, and those who are alienated or fearful of it. And Trump has solidified the Republican identity, and solidified the Republican reliance on the voters who are most uneasy about the way the country is changing. 
 
You know, this last -- in one of his rallies after the election in 2020, in Georgia, he was in front of a virtually all-white rural audience and he said this is our country. And they are trying to take it away through stealing and rigging of elections. And it's clear that he ties this idea of election fraud in big cities to this broader concern among his predominantly white, predominantly nonurban, predominantly culturally conservative base, that they are losing control of the country. 
 
And I do believe that is something that is going to outlive Trump, whatever happens to him legally or politically in 2024. It is now a part of the Republican coalition that American politics is going to have to deal with for some time. 
 
ACOSTA: And Ron, I mean, he seems to be further inflaming what you're talking about here. If you look at what happened just 24 hours after his arraignment. He puts this post up on social media saying if you come after me, we're coming after you. We're going to go after you. And that, of course, prompts the special counsel to go to the judge and say, look at what he's doing here. 
 
You have to be careful about sharing evidence with the Trump defense team and the defendant because look at what he does. He's also put out a social media post about Mike Pence, apparently in the last day or so. 
 
BROWNSTEIN: That's right. 
 
ACOSTA: And he was speaking about the special counsel in all sorts of ways last night at this rally in Alabama calling him deranged and so. It doesn't sound as though the judge, the legal system is going to be able to put guardrails around the former president through this process because he seems to be delighting in all of this and using this to inflame his base further. 
 
BROWNSTEIN: Yes. Well, the legal system is going to face the burden because other Republicans simply have not accepted it. I mean, Trump has taken the lesson from his, what, eight years now on the national stage that there is essentially no boundary he can cross that can cause a critical mass of other Republicans to try to convince their voters that this is too far. I mean, if you think about all of the behavior that is outlined in this indictment, even the discussion of using the army to quell protests if there's an attempt, you know, if there was an attempt to overturn the election. 
 
Astonishingly few Republicans outside of those on the periphery of the presidential race, Chris Christie, Asa Hutchinson, Will Hurd, have said publicly this is behavior that disqualifies you from being president again. 
 <br>[19:25:06]
 
Mike Pence has suggested that certainly. But, you know, from a Ron DeSantis or a Tim Scott, they are much more likely to echo Trump in saying that he is being -- you know, the victim of a weaponized justice department. And I think he has very clearly taken the lesson that there is no point that he can go to that other important voices in the party will try to, in effect, excommunicate him or say he has gone too far. And he believes that in the end they will fall in line behind him and certainly that's been a good bet so far and we've seen it to a remarkable degree from figures like Kevin McCarthy in the past few days. 
 
ACOSTA: Yes. The fear is that they'll be excommunicated by him. 
 
BROWNSTEIN: Right. 
 
ACOSTA: All right, Ron Brownstein, you've given us a lot to think about as always. Thanks so much. Really appreciate it. 
 
BROWNSTEIN: Thanks for having me. 
 
ACOSTA: All right. And tomorrow morning, the U.S. Women's Soccer Team plays their first match in the all-important knockout stage of the World Cup. Will they win? Or will they be heading back? We'll be talking with former champion Brandi Chastain. She'll be sharing what she thinks in just a few moments. That's next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[19:30:17] 
 
ACOSTA: All right, get ready fans. Sunday morning, the US women's national soccer team faces Sweden, it's a do or die match. The Women's World Cup has entered the knockout stage, but the US team has struggled a little bit at times in getting there. 
 
Two-time World Cup champion and co-founder of the National Women's Soccer Team Bay FC, Brandi Chastain joins us now. 
 
Great to see you again, Brandi. 
 
BRANDI CHASTAIN, TWO-TIME WORLD CUP CHAMPION AND CO-FOUNDER OF THE NATIONAL WOMEN'S SOCCER TEAM BAY FC: Nice to see you, too. 
 
ACOSTA: I mean, the pressures on this is the knockout stage, it is win or go home. What do you expect from tomorrow's match? 
 
CHASTAIN: Well, I think we've got a battle royale. I love this matchup. Sweden and the US have gone after it many, many times in the past. The last being the Olympics, didn't fare well for us. 
 
I don't think this is a revenge game, but I feel that there's a lot of soccer that we have left on the table, and I am hoping that we will bring a better game plan and execution to this match come this early morning. 
 
ACOSTA: And after tying Portugal in their last match, the US defender, Kelley O'Hara was apparently seen giving what looked like a fiery speech to her teammates. What do you think she was trying to do? Was she trying to light a fire under them a little bit? 
 
And what do you make of you know, when you hear news anchors like me and sportscasters, say, you know the US team has struggled a little bit at times, they struggled a little bit to get to the knockout stage. Do you buy any of that? Or do you think that the competition is just fierce this time around and they're just in some battles? 
 
CHASTAIN: I think it's a little bit of both. The objective is to get to the knockout round. They did that. The accomplishment, they can check that off. You know, as the fans, we don't like it because we want it to look better, we want it to feel better. But sometimes, you've got to get there how you get there. You've got to play ugly sometimes, and you've got to win ugly and that's kind of what's happened. 
 
It wasn't perfect. We knew that wasn't going to be the case anyway, so now, they are in the position they wanted to be in and a chance to play in the Round of 16 and to move on. 
 
So, you know, I think Kelley O'Hara, you know, though I don't know the words she said. What I can imagine she is saying is, listen, we've done what we set out to do. Now let's get our head into the right space and let's move forward and let's look into the future. 
 
Now, what we have in front of us is we need to see from the coach a game plan that the players look like they're on the same page, whether that be in the attacking half or the attacking third, or in the defensive half and the defensive third, we know that Sweden is very good on dead balls and set pieces. We have to defend our box like it is the last defending we're going to do. 
 
And we have to come out with our trailblazers -- Alex Morgan, Sophia Smith. That could be Trinity Rodman or Lynn Williams -- we have to be more assertive, aggressive. We have to be more like ourselves in this game than we've ever been in this whole tournament. 
 
We've only given up one goal, but we've only scored four. So Sweden has only given up one goal as well, and they scored nine. So this game is really going to be a battle and I'm biting my fingernails, and I'm excited at the same time. 
 
ACOSTA: Me too. And feel free to tell me, I don't know what I'm talking about here, but why is it that we're not seeing as much of Megan Rapinoe and you can say that anyway, a lot of people say, but why are we not seeing as much of Megan Rapinoe this time around? 
 
I'm sitting on my sofa saying where is Megan? You know, if they're not doing as well, put in Megan. She has had such a dominant role in this team over the years. 
 
CHASTAIN: She's had an amazing role with this team. And, you know, I think there's a little bit of that going on everywhere. But you know, I will say, what I heard Vlatko say is, you know, we feel we've got the right mix out there, and you know, I think the continuity he's trying to manufacture hasn't shown up yet, but perhaps going through what they've gone through will work. 
 
You know, I wish I could be a fly on the wall and hear what he's saying. You know, in terms of Megan Rapinoe, I think she's probably a 15 to 20-minute player in this World Cup. If we're asking more from her, then I don't necessarily think that we've got the right tactics going on. 
 
We have to be -- honestly, I think the number one thing is we have to show our mettle. We have to show that we can have composure under pressure. We have to find a way to play through the midfield at times. Our midfield hasn't really been as much of a key component and without Rosa Lavelle, that will be difficult, but maybe we have a chance to see Savannah DeMelo again or Ashley Sanchez, who I think is the type of player who has just enough moxie to feel like she could run the show in the middle. 
 <br>[19:35:01] 
 
So I'm really looking forward to seeing what the lineup is, seeing if there's any changes in the formation and I think if we get down to the end of the game, Megan Rapinoe could be a good call for us. 
 
ACOSTA: Yes, and you're absolutely right. There are some amazing young players on that team as well. That's going to be exciting to watch. Always great to talk to you about this, Brandi. We're on the edge of our seats. We can't wait for it to start, but great to talk to you as always. 
 
Brandi Chastain, thanks so much. 
 
CHASTAIN: Thank you, Jim. 
 
ACOSTA: All right. Good to see you again. 
 
All right, are the new indictments giving Donald Trump a boost with Republicans? We have the latest polling on that coming up next here in the CNN NEWSROOM. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
ACOSTA: Israeli Police say they have thwarted a terrorist attack today in Tel Aviv. Two city patrol officers confronted a Palestinian suspect who reportedly pulled out a gun and shot one of them. The other officer then chased the suspect and shot him, according to police. The officer and the gunman died a short time later. So far, no claim of responsibility for the Tel Aviv attack. 
 <br>[19:40:06] 
 
Meanwhile, two Israelis have been arrested and five others detained following a reported killing of a Palestinian man in the West Bank. That's according to police. 
 
We have new information about what Republicans think of Donald Trump's three indictments. CNN senior data reporter, Harry Enten joins us now to break it all down. 
 
Harry, what are we learning? I mean, do they buy it? 
 
HARRY ENTEN, CNN SENIOR DATA REPORTER: No, I mean, they don't. I mean, come on, Jim. We've been through this song and dance how many freaking times before. 
 
Donald Trump himself said, you know, when he was first running for president, he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and get away with it. 
 
And if you look at the polling right now, and we look at the three indictments and whether Trump should be charged, according to Republicans, look at this: They all look the same, 16 percent for the handling of classified documents, 14 percent in the New York hush money case, and just 14 percent in the efforts to overturn the 2020 election. 
 
They could charge him, I think, at this point with basically anything, and you'd still get about that 15 percent of Republicans who think he should have been charged, the vast majority believe he should not be charged. He has got that base wrapped around his finger, like nothing I basically have ever seen before. 
 
ACOSTA: And Trump has repeatedly and falsely claimed that the 2020 election was stolen. He is still doing it, despite everything that is in this indictment now, but do Republicans still believe him? Are there any cracks there? 
 
ENTEN: No, no. You know, I just love looking at these numbers insofar as they are one of the few things in politics that are predictable these days. 
 
You know, was Biden's 2020 win legitimate? You go back two years ago, 72 percent of the Republican base said no. You look now, it's 69 percent. Just 29 percent say yes now. That is unchanged statistically, from where we were just two years ago at 28 percent. Nothing has changed with regard to this, and it just goes back to the fact that Trump is the Republican favored right now to win the 2024 GOP nomination. 
 
ACOSTA: Yes. I mean, that is why we were talking about this earlier. You know, why does Trump even feels like he needs to hold rallies or go on debate stages? He doesn't need to give him these numbers. You're absolutely right. 
 
And how do these numbers play into Trump's support in becoming the nominee in 2024? 
 
ENTEN: Yes. I mean, I think this is the great divide within the Republican primary right now. If you believe that the 2020 election was legitimate, look, Donald Trump gets 27 percent of that vote. But if you don't think Biden's win was legitimate, look at that, he gets 64 percent of that vote. 
 
So this is the greatest divide that when I look at all the cross tabs, what you think about the 2020 election tells you everything you need to know about the 2024 primary and you know, there are a lot of folks who make the argument, oh, Trump might be a stronger general election candidate if he admitted that he actually lost in 2020, but the fact that he might be a weaker primary candidate as these numbers show right here. 
 
ACOSTA: Right. I mean, he can't come off of that argument, politically speaking, even though it's a lie. I mean, the numbers don't lie there. 
 
Harry, let's shift to something that I actually do want to talk about and that is the NFL preseason that is finally underway. 
 
ENTEN: Yes. 
 
ACOSTA: They had the Hall of Fame Game. I thought it was super early in August for that to happen, but they had it the other night, the Jets and the Browns. That was a lot of fun to see those guys getting going again. 
 
But I have to ask you, my Washington Commanders, or whatever we're going to call them in the future. Maybe they won't be called the Commanders, do they have any chance of winning the Super Bowl? And as a lifelong Washington football fan, I already know the answer to this question, too. 
 
ENTEN: Look, there's always a chance, I feel like Jim Carrey in "Dumb and Dumber," right? You're saying there's a chance. 
 
Look, the fact is you have a very small chance of actually winning the Superbowl. Look, your team has a one percent chance of winning, and that's not nothing. 
 
ACOSTA: Oh, that's generous. 
 
ENTEN: My Buffalo Bills -- yes, it is generous, I like being nice to you, Jim. My Buffalo Bills have a 10 percent chance of winning the Super Bowl. All I'm asking for is just one Super Bowl, just one, I don't need the three that your team has, I just need one. Maybe this year will be the year. And hey, you know what? Miracles do happen. I'm praying. 
 
ACOSTA: And I will not remind you, I guess I will remind you that my Washington team did beat the Buffalo Bills for one of their Super Bowls. I don't take any joy in saying that and passing that along, but I would think that the 10 percent number would be a little higher for the Buffalo Bills. They've got a great team. 
 
ENTEN: They have an awesome team. I've been waiting for this team to actually win one, but the fact is like we have 32 teams in the NFL. The Chiefs, I think are the favorite at this point, like a 14 percent chance of winning. 
 
It's still early. Let's see what happens, and hopefully it's not a repeat when you beat us about 30 years ago, 37 to 24. 
 
ACOSTA: There you go. Always there with the numbers. Very good and go Commanders or go whatever we are going to call this team. We have to have faith. 
 
Harry Enten, thanks so much. Great to talk to you. 
 
If we're going to talk football, we are going to have you on every hour by the way. 
 
ENTEN: Thanks. 
 
ACOSTA: But we'll do that next time. 
 
ENTEN: Yes. 
 
ACOSTA: And be sure to check out Harry's podcast "Margins of Error." You can find it on your favorite podcast app or you can go to cnn.com/audio. 
 
And a quick programming note, tomorrow evening, I'll be speaking live with a Republican presidential candidate Asa Hutchinson. I'll get his reaction to former President Trump's third and dive in and find out whether he thinks he'll be on the first GOP debate stage later this month. We'll talk to him tomorrow about all of that and we'll be right back.

ACOSTA: A six-year-old boy is hospitalized in Florida after an apparent fall from a roller coaster. Police say the boy was found 20 feet under the ride's track at the Fun Spot America theme park near Orlando. The child suffered severe injuries. 
 <br>[19:50:06] 
 
The Galaxy Spin Roller Coaster is closed during the investigation that is underway now. 
 
A historic FDA approval for new mothers, the agency signed off on the first ever postpartum depression pill in the US that is specifically made for this condition. 
 
CNN health reporter, Jacqueline Howard has more. 
 
JACQUELINE HOWARD, CNN HEALTH REPORTER: What we know about the depression drug, zuranolone is that it is administered as an oral pill taken daily over the course of two weeks, and patients in clinical trials have said that it worked very quickly for them, within just a few days, and those effects were sustained for weeks. 
 
One clinical trial included 196 women with severe postpartum depression, half of them were given zuranolone, the other half was given a placebo, but among those women taking zuranolone, 57 percent said they experienced huge improvements, 50 percent or more in their depressive symptoms over the course of two weeks, compared with only 39 percent of those who took a placebo. 
 
And some of the women taking zuranolone even said they started to experience those symptoms improve as early as within three days of taking the medication. 
 
Now some women taking the drug experienced side effects like drowsiness and dizziness, but the drug was overall found to be safe and effective, and it is known that about one in eight women in the United States and about 17 percent of women globally experience symptoms of postpartum depression after giving birth. 
 
So this is big news for them. Back to you. 
 
ACOSTA: Jacqueline Howard, thank you for that. 
 
This weekend, see how the face of cannabis has changed. Dr. Sanjay Gupta introduces you to senior citizens using plants to replace pills. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
 
DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Iris, how are you? 
 
IRIS: Yes. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My wife's mother and sister and aunt, they had Alzheimer's. It scared her half to death and they progress very slowly. Maybe four years ago, she cried for a half an hour every morning like clockwork. 
 
GUPTA: This is full on crying? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Crying. 
 
GUPTA: Did they try different medications. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: She had enough antidepressants to keep an elephant calm, and still, she cried. 
 
GUPTA: In 2019, they started a pilot program here at MorseLife. It is a senior living community in Florida. 
 
DR. MELANIE BONE, DIRECTOR OF CANNABINOID-BASED THERAPIES AT MORSELIFE HEALTH SYSTEM: Hi, Iris. 
 
GUPTA: Iris was given cannabis. 
 
BONE: You look so beautiful today -- 
 
GUPTA: Dr. Melanie Bone runs the program. 
 
BONE: We do CBD. All of the different CBs in them, and the terpenes. 
 
One, two, three. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Dr. Bone came and gave her one, she stopped crying. Done. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Iris, he we go, sweetie. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Takes one in the morning, one at night. It's over. 
 
GUPTA: It sounds extraordinary. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Magic. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It was so impressive how that worked, kind of like Charlotte Figi.

TAPPER: Don't miss the new episode of "The Whole Story" with Anderson Cooper tomorrow night at eight right here on CNN.

ACOSTA: An uninvited guests crashed a sewing blogger's instructional video, and as you might expect it was all captured on camera. Here is CNN's Jeanne Moos. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
 
JEN WESNER, SEWING BLOGGER: This is my sewing room. 
 
JEANNE MOOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Jen Wesner is a sewing blogger who was recording an instructional video when someone crashed her session literally 
 
WESNER: You can do it with trim, it gives you lines where you can put the trim on. 
 
MOOS (voice over): Things fell off the walls. Jen froze for a few seconds then ran to the rescue. 
 
Moments later, she was at the door of the car. 
 
WESNER: All I saw were airbags, so I kept saying, "Are you okay? Are you okay?" 
 
She was okay. Jen says the driver worked for a food delivery service. She got out of the car and walked around outside the Northport, Florida home using your phone. MOOS (on camera): Cars are always flying into houses it seems, but you
 
 don't usually get to see it from the house's point of view. 
 
Here are both views. 
 
[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS] 
 
MOOS (voice over): The car ran a stop sign and hit a drainage ditch that sent it airborne. It landed about four feet from the house. The ditch save the day. 
 
WESNER: One of the cops said it had that been less of an incline, she would have gone into the house. 
 
MOOS (voice over); Northport Police couldn't say if she was ticketed, but a driving school asked to use the video as an example of an epic fail. 
 
Jen says the driver apologized again and again for landing in her yard, but the funny part involves the painting with a Bible verse. 
 
WESNER: I think the funniest thing was that the painting waited to fall off the wall. It was like, oh, yes, me too. 
 
MOOS: Better a sewing video that leaves you in stitches rather than needing stitches. 
 
Jeanne Moos, CNN, New York.

ACOSTA: Glad everybody is okay.
