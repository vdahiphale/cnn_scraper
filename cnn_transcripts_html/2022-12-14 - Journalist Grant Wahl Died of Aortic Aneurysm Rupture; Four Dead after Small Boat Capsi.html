(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ELENI GIOKOS, CNN HOST, CONNECT THE WORLD: Hello and welcome back. This is "Connect the World". I'm Eleni Giokos in Dubai. It would be a magical end 
 
 to an almost mythical career Lionel Messi is playing in the World Cup Final after putting on a stunning show in Argentina's 3-1 victory over Croatia in 
 
 Tuesday's World Cup Semi-Final.
 
The victory sends Argentine fans into frenzy as their nation seeks its first World Cups titles since 1986. Awaiting them will either be France or 
 
 Morocco you kick off in the other semifinal in less than three hours. Everyone expected France to be here. They are the defending champs.
 
But Morocco has run has been a shocker. The first Arab or African team to make it to a Final Four has already been in Spain and Portugal. And they 
 
 hope to knock out another European power today.
 
I want to bring in our Senior Sports Analyst Darren Lewis. Darren, I want to quickly start with Morocco. And I guess the question is what is the 
 
 winning formula that the Moroccan team needs to bring to the field today against France?
 
DARREN LEWIS, CNN SENIOR SPORTS ANALYST: I think it's a team spirit, Eleni. I think it's a willingness to put their bodies on the line just like they 
 
 have done so far in this tournament. And it really is a choice. Do you want your moments of the first North African team to get this far?
 
Or do you want your celebrity with Killian Mbappe and France, all stars who are bidding to become the first back to back champions since 1962. I kind 
 
 of fancy a little bit of romance you know, I like the fact that the Moroccans they have nothing to lose.
 
They have millions of fans all around the world. And they are a side who really do believe in themselves. They love defending some people get bored 
 
 by watching defenders stop the ball and stop the opposition from scoring. But that right there Eleni is a formula that's got them this far and that's 
 
 the reason why so many people will be willing them to do that again tonight.
 
GIOKOS: Well, it is what dreams are made of. And frankly, I know that the team feels really they've gotten so fine and broken. You know the status 
 
 quo. I want to talk about Lionel Messi because frankly, you know, this is something you spoken about that he want to win a World Cup. He's going to 
 
 go into this very galvanized against France, or Morocco?
 
LEWIS: Yes, he will do. Lots of people talk about him needing to win this tournament to kind of go down in history, but I think he's done a lot to 
 
 write himself into or shoot himself into the Hall of Fame already. I'm just going to give you some numbers if that's OK Eleni.
 
Because he started playing for Argentina when he was 18 in 2005, he scored 97 goals in 172 games that's a strike rate of nearly one in two. He is one 
 
 of only six men to appear in five World Cups. He is the first Argentina player to score in four of them. And he's the country's leading scorer at 
 
 World Cups with 11.
 
And in this tournament, he's scored five goals in six games. He's been sensational when people talk about legacy, but he's already left it because 
 
 he is a record breaking first player to win the Ballon d'Or the prize for the best player in the world seven times.
 
It should be a fascinating encounter. And there will be romantics who will be hoping he can complete the fairy tale by winning the one thing he has 
 
 never won on Sunday. It will be fascinating to watch.
 
GIOKOS: So much romance, so much excitement and so many surprises in this World Cup. It's been great to watch and interesting to listen to your 
 
 coverage over the past few weeks. Well, Morocco 3 and then Morocco generally I'm African. So I just totally put it out there. Darren, 
 
 appreciate it.
 
LEWIS: Out on the table.
 
GIOKOS: Good to see.
 
LEWIS: No problem.
 
GIOKOS: All right, so for more coverage of the World Cup be sure to check out our Middle East Newsletter we have several stories about the impact. 
 
 This event is having on the region including a look at how Morocco success is uniting the Arab world as well as Africa check it out @cnn.com on your

Alright, the American football journalist who died in Qatar while covering the World Cup suffered a ruptured aortic aneurysm. Grant Wahl's wife says 
 
 the condition had gone undetected and that no amount of CPR or shocks would have saved him. She says his condition had learned actually bring for a 
 
 number of years.
 <br>[11:05:00]
 
GIOKOS: And now to another tragic death at the World Cup one that's leading to demands for answers. World Cup Security Guard John Njua Kibue, who was a 
 
 migrant worker from Kenya, fell from the 8th floor of Lusail Stadium while on duty.
 
He was just 24. His family says they are being kept in the dark about the exact details of - Qatar says that is now investigating the circumstances 
 
 around his death. Larry Madowo is in Doha for us.
 
LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: According to Qatar Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy that the organizers of the tournament, he fell from 
 
 that stadium on Saturday, and he had been in intensive care unit here in Doha until Monday when he died and his family was notified.
 
But his family tells CNN that they're not quite clear on how he died. They've not been shown any video or pictures of what happened. They have 
 
 not been in contact with anyone directly from the company beyond very basic information.
 
And now they're calling for justice, because they don't understand how this young man who left Kenya to come here to Qatar to make something for 
 
 himself ended up dead. And the family has a lot of questions. We spoke to his mother today in Nairobi; this is what she told us.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He used to tell me Mom, you helped me when I was jobless. I will never leave you and I never want you to suffer. I know you 
 
 pray for me and I want to help you as much as I can.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MADOWO: There are a lot of questions regarding how exactly this young man died? It raises questions about the conditions and migrant laborers here in 
 
 Qatar operating, especially most of them, the Black and Brown laborers from Africa and South Asia who helped build this World Cup.
 
And who there have been a lot of complaints about the conditions they work in whether they're getting paid on time, if they have time off, some of 
 
 them work 14, 16 hour days with very few breaks and this adds to that kind of area of mystery Eleni.
 
GIOKOS: Alright, thanks to Larry Madowo in Doha for that report. Now Ukraine is facing its air defense systems for working effectively as Russia 
 
 launches its first wave of drone attacks on Kyiv in weeks. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he's proud that "All 13 drones were shut 
 
 down in Wednesday's attack".
 
Two buildings and a house were damaged. Ukraine has long been asking the U.S. for its advanced patriot missile defense system to protect its skies. 
 
 Now the White House tells CNN it is finalizing plans to do so. The Kremlin says that if that happens, the system would be a legitimate target for 
 
 Russia.
 
CNN Senior International Correspondent Will Ripley is on the ground in Kyiv and he has latest from the Ukrainian Capital.
 
WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: People were woken up to the sound of explosions in the early morning hours here in Kyiv in 
 
 central Kyiv actually a short distance from where I'm standing.
 
Some people were up already and getting ready for work when they heard that very, very distinctive sound of the drone engines followed by explosions. 
 
 One of the drones actually caused, you know, a huge hole in the side of a building there was damaged people had their apartment windows shattered.
 
And yet remarkably, the Ukrainian military says that in this drone attack on Kyiv the first in a number of weeks here in the central area, there has 
 
 been no significant damage to the power grid on top of what they're already dealing with.
 
There are rolling blackouts continuously affecting people who live here in Kyiv. And affecting people who live all over Ukraine and the power grid is 
 
 far from stable, it's going to be quite some time as crews continue to work to try to repair these facilities that are continuously damaged by these 
 
 Russian attacks.
 
Weaponizing winter targeting the power grid trying to make civilians lives miserable as the temperatures plunge ever colder and the official start of 
 
 winter is just days away. Even though in this instance, the Ukrainians did shoot down they say 13 drones fired from Russia.
 
These are Iranian made drones that explode upon impact. There were incidents just within the last week, where some of the drones did make it 
 
 through. For example, in the Southern Ukrainian region of Odessa, one and a half million people were plunged into darkness.
 
Last weekend, when out of 15 drones that was launched by Russia, five of them did hit their targets. There are certainly welcome news here in Kyiv 
 
 that the reporting by CNN that the Patriot Missile Defense Systems will be arriving at some point in this country.
 
But of course that comes with its own set of challenges and risks including threats from the Russians that this will make NATO and the United States 
 
 complicit in escalating this war Will Ripley, CNN Kyiv.
 
GIOKOS: A Former Russian Soldier is seeking asylum in Europe after defecting from an army brigade accused of committing war crimes in Ukraine. 
 
 In his first TV interview he tells CNN Fred Pleitgen and what he witnessed during the war and wanting some of these images and this exclusive report.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): After the Russian army was forced to retreat around Kyiv the carnage came 
 
 to light. Bucha, Borodyanka and many other Kyiv suburbs littered with bodies.
 <br>[11:10:00]
 
PLEITGEN (voice over): Ukraine especially blames one Russian unit for alleged crimes here the 64 separate guards Motor Rifle Brigade from Eastern 
 
 Siberia. Now a deserter from that unit is speaking to CNN.
 
NIKITA CHIBRIN, RUSSIA DESERTER: Actually big lie for me like 24 February coming, OK. Everyone goes to war,
 
PLEITGEN (voice over): Nikita Chibrin defected from the Russian military and fled to Europe, where we met him in a secret location. He shows me his 
 
 military booklet with a stamp signed by the commander of the 64th Motor Rifle Brigade Colonel Azatbek Omurbekov known in Ukraine as the Butcher of 
 
 Bucha.
 
Chibrin says he and his comrades were given shoot to kill orders even though Russia has denied any wrongdoing by its forces around Kyiv.
 
CHIBRIN: We had a direct command to murder those who divulged our positions. If someone had a phone we were allowed to shoot him.
 
PLEITGEN (voice over): Chibrin says the unit was deployed to Belarus shortly before the invasion, allegedly for training. The soldiers had no 
 
 idea they would soon advance into Ukraine, and he says they weren't prepared for war.
 
CHIBRIN: Everyone thought they could be like Rambo. Those who said I will be shooting Ukrainians easily piece of cake when they went to the 
 
 frontline, and then they came back. They were like we don't want a war.
 
PLEITGEN (voice over): Chibrin says he too come under Ukrainian artillery shelling and showed us this video from near the Town Lypivka West of Kyiv. 
 
 He tells me he refused to fight because he was opposed to the war and that his commanders called him a coward and reassigned him to menial labor tasks 
 
 in the rear echelon.
 
He says he didn't witness the mass killings the unit is accused of but did witness plenty of crimes against Ukrainian civilians, including looting.
 
CHIBRIN: They weren't trying to hide it. They did this very open and then like, no one, they saw everything what they say, whoa, I wanted this like I 
 
 want this. Like everything makes a lot and cargo make the loot.
 
PLEITGEN (voice over): And even rape.
 
CHIBRIN (on camera): I saw rapists running around being chased because they were committed rape. The guys who did rape I saw them run. Then I learned 
 
 they were rapists. They raped a mother and a daughter. They will never jailed justify it just like that go.
 
PLEITGEN (voice over): CNN has reached out to the Russian Defense Ministry for comment, but we haven't received a reply. Russia has consistently 
 
 denied its forces were responsible for crimes against Ukrainian civilians.
 
And President Vladimir Putin issued a decree praising the 64th separate guards Motor Rifle Brigade for "Heroism and bold actions". Nikita Chibrin 
 
 fled Russia while on leave. He gets emotional when talking about his four year old daughter he left behind. He says he wants to testify against his 
 
 commanders before an international court to shed light on what happened in the war he never wanted to be a part of. Frederik Pleitgen, CNN Berlin.

GIOKOS: The Pope is calling for a Christmas with "Ukraine in our hearts". Pope Francis is urging people to spend less on gifts and celebrations this 
 
 year and asking them to send money to Ukraine to help get through a cold and dark winter of war. The Pope has been making appeals for Ukraine at 
 
 nearly every public event since Russia invaded Ukraine in February.
 
The British government in the meantime is calling it a terrible tragedy. A small boat capsized as it tried to cross the English Channel with dozens of 
 
 migrants on board the latest on the search and rescue operation that's coming up just ahead. And the U.S. is seeing a surge of migrants across its 
 
 southern border from Mexico to Texas why it could get even bigger in the coming days details coming up.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:15:00]
 
GIOKOS: Britain's Home Secretary says the sinking of the migrant boats in the English Channel is a terrible tragedy and a reminder of why illegal 
 
 crossings must end. At least four people died when the small vessel capsized in freezing temperatures.
 
The British Coast Guard and French Navy are evacuating survivors to safety in helicopters and lifeboats. Dozens of people reportedly were on the 
 
 vessel. Migrant channel crossings have surged with more than 40,000 people arriving in the UK by small boats this year alone.
 
I want to bring in CNN's Nina Dos Santos who is following developments for us. Nina, could you tell us what the latest news lines are in terms of 
 
 rescuing survivors and also what the main messaging is from government?
 
NINA DOS SANTOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, well, Eleni. Obviously this took place at a time when obviously, major government members including the 
 
 Prime Minister and the Home Secretary were due to speak earlier in Parliament.
 
And obviously, as you said, they made a statement about that. We also had Rishi Sunak; the Prime Minister expressed deep sorrow at the loss of life 
 
 here in this tragedy. The latest is, as you said that the death toll is that four people who have tragically lost their lives after this small boat 
 
 to dinghy which may have been potentially overfilled.
 
As often happens with these channel crossings, was trying to cross between the border, the sea border between France and also the UK in the middle of 
 
 the night. We're talking about a distress call that went out at 3:05 am and obviously, French helicopters were dispatched from the Coast Guard there 
 
 the British Coast Guard also and a local fishing vessel had to help to try and get more than 30 people out of the water.
 
It's believed that a number of these people are currently in hospital because remember that we're currently in the UK in the midst of a freezing 
 
 cold snap, which means that temperatures at sea when this incident occurred, we're likely to have been below zero.
 
Now this again shines a light on the UK government's rather hard stance on whether or not migrants could come to this country. The government has been 
 
 repeatedly criticized about not opening it up enough safe legal passages for asylum seekers and migrants to make their way to the UK avoiding this 
 
 treacherous route here.
 
And Suella Braverman the Home Secretary in the House of Commons earlier today appeared to acknowledge the tragedy that had happened but also 
 
 doubled down on her previous hard stance on immigration. Have a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SUELLA BRAVERMAN, HOME SECRETARY, BRITISH: As the Prime Minister told the House only yesterday. It is not cruel or unkind to want to break the 
 
 stranglehold of the criminal gangs who trade in human misery and who exploit our system and our laws. He was right. This morning's tragedy, like 
 
 the loss of 27 people on one November day last year, is the most sobering reminder possible of why we have to end these crossings.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SANTOS: As you said Eleni 45,000 people are estimated to have made this journey to the United Kingdom in just the last 12 months alone and this 
 
 time last year back in at the end of November 2021. As you heard there from the Home Secretary 27 people sadly perished again in this treacherous space 
 
 of water trying to make their way to the United Kingdom for a better life.
 
Obviously, the backdrop to all of this will also mean that there will be renewed pressure on the government to try and mend its relationship helps 
 
 with France to prevent these boats from setting off in the first place.
 <br>[11:20:00]
 
SANTOS: And also all of this comes just a day after the government announced a new plan to try and stop a flurry of people trying to make 
 
 their way to the UK and this method from places like Albania, Eleni?
 
GIOKOS: Nina dos Santos, thank you for that report. While the plight of people risking danger and harsh conditions and hope of a better life, of 
 
 course, stretches across many countries and continents the United States is beefing up agents at the U.S. Mexico border in El Paso, Texas.
 
There has been a surge of migrant crossings there and city officials are worried there will be an even bigger influx as a controversial COVID era 
 
 border policy is set to end. CNN's Ed Lavandera has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): As the sun fades away over El Paso, a large group of migrants stand on the borders 
 
 edge waiting to be processed by border patrol agents, while a few others tip toe across a short path through the Rio Grande. These migrants are part 
 
 of a major surge of border crossings seen in El Paso in recent days.
 
And it's happening as the projected end of a Trump era COVID restriction draws closer ending the policy to swiftly expel migrants at U.S. land 
 
 borders. U.S. border authorities interacted with more than 2 million migrants in the last year, up from the previous year. But in recent days, 
 
 an average of almost 2500 migrants a day have been moving across this border between Mexico and the U.S. through El Paso.
 
CLAUDIA RODRIGUEZ, EL PASO CITY COUNCIL MEMBER: Title 42 is only going to make that situation worse, where they're going to have more apprehensions. 
 
 And so we're going to see a lot more releases into the community. And we're not prepared for it.
 
LAVANDERA (voice over): Just three weeks ago, according to Customs and Border Protection, the seven day rolling average was fewer than 1700. 
 
 Thousands of migrants are now coming from Central and South America as well as Cuba, according to U.S. immigration officials.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I am helping them get food and whatever they need. This is not even about politics, it's about humanity. These people are here 
 
 and they're cold.
 
LAVANDERA (voice over): Some have been camping out across the border in Ciudad Juarez in Mexico, raising concerns they will cross and mass if Trump 
 
 era border restrictions and in about a week. Still others have already been boarded onto buses to be processed or turned around under the provisions of 
 
 Title 42.
 
JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: We are taking steps to be able to manage the expiration of Title 42 and to put in place a process 
 
 that will be orderly and humane. And we believe that in doing so we can protect our national security concerns.
 
LAVANDERA (voice over): Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas arrived in El Paso and says he's meeting with Customs and Border Protection 
 
 local officials and organizations. For now the immediate problem is housing and managing a large influx of migrants.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If the court cases get resolved and the courts allow Title 42 to be lifted, we're going to see thousands of refugees for whom 
 
 there isn't shelter.
 
LAVANDERA (voice over): The Director of a local El Paso shelter says Border Patrol recently dropped a busload of migrants at his doorstep and he's 
 
 worried he'll soon have to turn people away.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're going to have to say no, not because we want to, but simply because we don't have space. The reality is there's just too 
 
 many people.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
LAVANDERA: The Biden Administration is projecting that anywhere between nine and 14,000 migrants could attempt to cross the U.S. southern border 
 
 once Title 42 is lifted next week. Now there are still a number of legal challenges playing out in the court.
 
And because of that, it is possible that Title 42 is kept in place next week. In the meantime, border cities like here in El Paso are bracing for 
 
 what's to come next week. Ed Lavandera CNN, El Paso, Texas.
 
GIOKOS: Well, let's get you up to speed on some other stories that are on our radar right now. An EU official arrested in a corruption scandal 
 
 reportedly will remain in Belgian custody for another week. Eva Kaili is part of a case in which Qatar allegedly bribed EU lawmakers with money or 
 
 gifts to gain favor, she and Qatari government officials denied any wrongdoing.
 
Now Peru is setting up a crisis management committee as deadly political protests sweep the country. The military has been deployed to protect 
 
 public spaces and help reopen blocked roads. Supporters of the former president have been protesting since his arrest and impeachment last week.
 
His detainment hearing has been postponed until Thursday. Now after years of strict COVID restrictions, China is finally starting to ease the rules, 
 
 this as the rate of COVID infections is rising. We wanted to see what life was like in Beijing with the government's new direction Selina Wang hit the 
 
 streets to find out for us.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SELINA WANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): China is starting to unravel its zero COVID policy, but instead of crowds out celebrating this is how 
 
 reopening is going in China. Closed shops, empty streets, people avoiding each other.
 <br>[11:25:00]
 
WANG: Because for the first time since the start of the pandemic COVID is spreading like wildfire in Beijing, people now either have COVID or they're 
 
 scared to get it. So I just spoke to the shop worker in the store. He told me that he's the only employee without COVID, which is why he can still 
 
 come to work.
 
And he says I am the only customer who has come into the store all day. The only crowds I'm seeing in Beijing outside of hospitals like this and 
 
 pharmacies. So he says his fever has gone down, but he still has a cold, hoping to buy medicine, but he's worried they don't have any stock because 
 
 there are long lines forming outside of pharmacies across the country. People are trying to stock up, but stuff is selling out.
 
You know, for years, China has been demonizing COVID, playing up the risks of long COVID. And now suddenly, state media is publishing headlines every 
 
 day saying COVID is not a big deal. It's whiplash for a lot of people, because just weeks before, if you got COVID, your whole community would 
 
 have gone into hard lockdown. This is such a major and sudden change. So China is finally opening up. How do you feel about it?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I feel it was pretty great. I wish they could have opened up earlier.
 
WANG (on camera): Has business been very slow or difficult?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You know you can see there are not that many customers, other people who just got the virus.
 
WANG (on camera): Are you scared about getting COVID?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm worried about my parents and my grandparents little bit.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
WANG: People are relieved though, that you no longer have to go to a quarantine facility if you get COVID. Getting sent to one of those rundown 
 
 facilities was such a big source of anxiety before. And these health QR codes that have been used for years to track and dictate where we can go 
 
 well, the government is now saying that you don't need them to enter most public places.
 
So I don't need to scan my code. It feels surreal though, that I can literally just walk in. So she said I can only do online delivery, so you 
 
 can't even sit inside or order inside and Shake Shack. So outside the Starbucks, they have a sign saying you need to show a 40 hour COVID test. Even though the national rules don't require it in 
 
 Beijing, you still need a recent PCR test in order to enter restaurants, gyms, and entertainment venues. There are way less places now to get COVID 
 
 tests in the city.
 
And the lines are short because most people are just staying at home. But just a week before at this exact same location, this was packed with people 
 
 waiting in line. So behind me is a graveyard of COVID testing booths. It's like almost overnight in Beijing, they removed all of these testing 
 
 locations and here are the remnants.
 
After years of harsh lockdown, the government is finally letting people manage their own health. But people don't feel ready. And experts say the 
 
 country isn't eager. The country hasn't vaccinated enough of the elderly population and how's it improve the health care capacity enough? So this 
 
 reopening it's going to continue to be messy and uneven. Selina Wang, CNN, Beijing.
 
GIOKOS: And coming up next on "Connect the World" he studied physics at MIT. Now he could be facing decades behind bars, the staggering fall of 
 
 crypto King Sam Bankman-Fried, I'll be talking to our crypto experts about what this means for the industry. And Morocco make history even before 
 
 stepping on to the pitch, the Second World Cup semi-final will begin soon as the Atlas Lions take on --.

GIOKOS: It is being called one of the biggest financial frauds in U.S. history. Sam Bankman-Fried remains in custody in the Bahamas. The former 
 
 FTX crypto boss has been denied bail. A judge says he poses a flight risk. The former crypto celebrity was arrested this week at the request of the 
 
 U.S.
 
He faces a long U.S. prison sentence if convicted on all counts against him. And that includes conspiracy and fraud. CNN's Randi Kaye takes a 
 
 closer look at the MIT graduate.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SAM BANKMAN-FRIED, FORMER CEO &amp; FOUNDER, FTX: At the end of the day, there's a question of what happened and why and who did what.
 
RANDI KAYE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Questions 30 year old Sam Bankman-Fried is going to have to answer. As the founder of the digital 
 
 trading platform FTX, he was long considered a modern day JP Morgan. A recent Fortune magazine cover asked whether the young billionaire was the 
 
 next Warren Buffett. Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen jumped on board as brand ambassadors.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A trade, are you sure?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not a trade? I'm trading crypto. FTX is the safest and easiest way to buy and sell crypto.
 
KAYE (voice over): Larry David promoted FTX during the Superbowl.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Like I was saying it's FTX it's a safe and easy way to get into crypto.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, I don't think so. And I'm never wrong about this stuff ever.
 
KAYE (voice over): The NBA's Steph Curry announced a long term partnership with FTX last year. Bankman-Fried even made a deal with the Miami Heat 
 
 renaming their home the FTX arena. It was a stunning rise for the MIT graduate only to be followed by a spectacular collapse.
 
BANKMAN-FRIED: I should have been on top of this and I feel really, really bad and regretful that I wasn't and a lot of people got hurt and that's on 
 
 me.
 
KAYE (voice over): A lot of people got hurt because FTX was allegedly using investor's money to bail out its partner firm, Alameda Research. Bankman-
 
 Fried had started the hedge fund Alameda in November 2017. He launched FTX a couple years later and it became a wildly popular exchange for buying and 
 
 selling crypto.
 
But when Alameda creditors came calling, federal prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Commission allege FTX used billions in investor 
 
 deposits to pay those creditors. In his interview with ABC's Good Morning America, Bankman-Fried denied knowing that investor's funds were allegedly 
 
 being used to save his hedge fund.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did you know that FTX deposits were used to pay off Alameda creditors?
 
BANKMAN-FRIED: I don't know if FTX deposits being used to pay off Alameda creditors. I did not know that there's any improper use of customer funds.
 
KAYE (voice over): After the founder of a rival firm leaked the alleged mishandling of customer funds, investors rapidly began withdrawing billions 
 
 from FTX. The trading platform filed for bankruptcy last month and Bankman- Fried resigned. Long before that he was a major political donor, a non- partisan group which tracks money and politics found he donated more than $900,000 to candidates and nearly $39 million to outside groups for mid-
 
 terms.
 
Most of the spending supported Democrats. Sam Bankman-Fried grew up in Palo Alto, California. His parents work as law professors at nearby Stanford 
 
 University. After graduating MIT in 2014, with a degree in physics, Bankman-Fried worked as a trader at Jane Street capital before starting his 
 
 own firm. His signature t-shirt and unkempt hair always is on display. Even in the company of former President Bill Clinton during a crypto conference 
 
 earlier this year in the Bahamas, Randi Kaye, CNN, Palm Beach County, Florida.

GIOKOS: Great to have you on the show. You know, we're just watching some of the commentary over the past few weeks after the implosion of FTX. 
 
 Everyone's scratching their head, how did we get hoodwinked into this? We just saw the endorsements, the credibility given of him being on stage with 
 
 some of the most powerful people in the world. And here we are today. He's been arrested. And I want you to just give me a sense of what you're 
 
 thinking and what you're hearing within the crypto sphere.
 
JEFF JOHN ROBERTS, CRYPTO EDITOR, FORTUNE: Thanks, Eleni. Yes, everyone is still a bit in shock. It's a mix between shock and rage. Because he did for 
 
 indeed for everyone, including me, you know, we put them on the cover of Fortune Magazine; you know which is not a good feeling in retrospect.
 
But he also fooled as you said celebrities in the White House and Congress and the most sophisticated investors in the world. So now we're just 
 
 picking up the pieces and I think a lot of people in crypto just are happy to turn the page and are glad that justice is being served.
 
GIOKOS: You said in one of your articles that if ex-founders Sam Bankman- Fried operated one of the largest swindles in history, all the while painting himself as a simple living do --. Then the question becomes how 
 
 did Sequoia Capital and other VCs miss this when doing due diligence or even the regulatory bodies that were overseeing FTX? What did we miss here?
 
ROBERTS: That's a great question. Yes, Sequoia Capital for your viewers might not know it is probably the most famous venture capital firm in 
 
 Silicon Valley, who's known for being smarter than everyone else. They missed it. And I think, you know, the conclusion is just simply --.
 
At a certain point, you see Tom Brady in there, and you see him, you know, and the story is just so good. And then everyone else is vouching for him. 
 
 And people just did not stop doing their homework. And you know, the more that comes out, the more shocking it is.
 
I mean, he was basically just robbing these customers to buy penthouses and to make you know, exotic bets on you know, on other companies. And it works 
 
 for a while until there was no more money.
 
GIOKOS: Yes, misuse and mishandling of the de-positives of funds. We've seen this story playing out before in Wall Street, right? We've seen these 
 
 kinds of stories. But crypto sort of positioned itself as sort of the antithesis to what we understand to be in the normal financial system.
 
But it's not so much an indictment of crypto; it's more about the systems that they're still plugging into, which is the traditional financial 
 
 system, which means a lot of great leverage. And if you don't have the lender of last resort, assisting you when things go bad, this is a result.
 
ROBERTS: Yes, that's a good summary. I mean, it's not indictment of crypto, crypto is a technology. Blockchain technology is, you know, is superior to 
 
 legacy technology when it comes to recording transfers and money. And ironically, I mean, crypto likes to test its transparency, because you can 
 
 see everything on the Blockchain.
 
However, you know, I think was a failure to ask, you know, Sam Bankman- Fried to furnish, you know, the information that would have really, you know, shown what was really going on. And I think that's, you know, partly, 
 
 you know, the fall to the media and its investors for not pushing hard enough. But also I think there's a lesson for next time that the technology 
 
 is there; we just have to use it.
 
GIOKOS: So there's going to be a lot of questions about what the regulatory process is going to be going forward, what role the U.S. regulatory 
 
 environment is going to play. And then important, the contagion because we're worried about Genesis at one point, questions around Binance on our 
 
 circling, how you're seeing this playing out?
 
ROBERTS: Yes, I mean, there could be more shoes to drop to mean, in retrospect, FTX probably blew up last March when someone called the 
 
 terrorist stable coin collapsed. But you know they were able to paper it over. So is there more shoes to drop? I don't know.
 
There have been some rumblings about Binance, Binance is no FTX. You know, it's the biggest crypto exchange in the world. But there are calls for more 
 
 transparency there. But the important thing to note is crypto is not really plugged into the mainstream financial system.
 
Because when that you know, housing market, the 2008 crisis was tied to mortgages and mortgages touch everything, whereas crypto does not. And you 
 
 know if crypto goes badly, it's going to knock out other crypto players, but it's not going to spread contagion into the main financial system.
 
And it's not a good thing. But and now, as I said, just there are a lot of good players in crypto trying to do the right thing. And they're all just 
 
 you know, disappointed and enraged that you know, FTX has done this to everyone.
 
GIOKOS: Yes, does definitely hang a cloud over the industry, right. So this is going to be an interesting one to watch. Jeff John Roberts, thank you 
 
 very much for joining us. Good to have you on the show. And we're going to a very short break. We'll be back right after this, stay with CNN.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:40:00]
 
GIOKOS: The role of the Atlas lions in just over two hours, Morocco will take on France in the biggest game in the history. You're looking at fans 
 
 who have been gathering since the weekend to express their pride and supports. No matter who wins the Moroccan team already heroes, they are the 
 
 first African and Arab team to reach a World Cup semi-final.
 
So to take on the reigning champions at the stage of The World Cup isn't itself momentous. Don Riddell is at the souk in Doha. And as he found out 
 
 the game is a mat about so much more than just football fans. Well beyond Morocco, let's take a look.
 
DON RIDDELL, CNN WORLD SPORT: You know we have always had a lot of fun whenever we've come down here into super Marquis in Doha. But we've never 
 
 had more fun during this tournament. And when we've been interacting with the Morocco fans, there's always so much energy and excitement and passion. 
 
 And their fan base is growing.
 
It's not just Moroccan supporters around me every time I come down here and speak to the fans after the game, I ended up running into supporters from 
 
 Saudi from Egypt, from Algeria, Sudan, Syria, it's a growing fan base. And you get a very real sense of this tournament.
 
The success of this Moroccan team is helping to unify the Arab region. Arab states, which don't always see eye to eye, but you, can sense that that is 
 
 changing and the joy of this Moroccan team is just infectious. Look at what they've achieved in this tournament from that opening draw against Croatia, 
 
 and then the stirring win against the world number two, Belgium, then they knocked out Spain, then they knocked out Portugal.
 
And throughout all of this time, they've only conceded one goal. And they didn't really concede that it was a no goal against Canada. So think about 
 
 that nobody has scored against this team. Of course, the biggest test is coming up in a few hours' time against France.
 
That's an interesting historical clash as well when you think about the fact that this team has already got the better of two of their former 
 
 colonizers. Now they run into a third in France in this semi-final match. Can they do it? It's going to be tough. France looked really good.
 
They're the defending world champions we all know about their strengths and the great Kylian Mbappe. But these fans think they can do it. If they 
 
 don't, some of them have told me they've already won the World Cup when you think about what they've achieved. But the coach and the players believe 
 
 the coach has said that he thinks they can go all the way.
 
He said call him crazy. Call him mad. But sometimes a little bit of crazy is a good thing so look out they might just yet keep this amazing party 
 
 going, back to you.
 
GIOKOS: All right, so South Africa hosted the World Cup in 2010 and the words of its famous theme song "Wakawaka" were this time for Africa. Now 
 
 after 12 years has that time truly come, let's bring in a true icon of football in South Africa Siphiwe Tshabalala whose most recently played 
 
 midfield for AmaZulu?
 <br>[11:45:00]
 
GIOKOS: He joins me now from Limpopo in South Africa, Siphiwe, good to see you, great to touch base. You know, I remember the 2010 World Cup in South 
 
 Africa, it was completely life changing. It brought South Africa together and it brought Africans together. But watching Morocco reach this level, 
 
 this must be emotive for you as it is for most people across the continent.
 
SIPHIWE TSHABALALA, SOUTH AFRICAN FOOTBALLER: Good day to you and the viewers. Yes, I think it's a big moment for Morocco and for the entire 
 
 continent. Morocco has done so well, finishing the semi-final of the World Cup, its history already being the first African country to reach the semi-
 
 finals of the World Cup. And you know congratulations to them.
 
And they have played against the best teams to reach the semi-finals. I mean, having to play a goalless draw against Croatia, it was a success. I 
 
 think I believe they should have won. And they've knocked out big teams with big players. I mean, you talk about Belgium, you talk about Spain. And 
 
 for them to reach the semi-finals, they deserve it and they deserve to go the way.
 
GIOKOS: Do you believe that they can do this against France tonight? What do they need to bring to the field in the next few hours? I'm sure you're 
 
 preparing to watch this game.
 
TSHABALALA: Yes, they, you know, they play as a collective. They fight on the field, there's together. There's the synergy, there's passion, they 
 
 play their hearts out. And hence, you know the success that they have thus far. And, you know, the woke up is the store of hope.
 
It's an opportunity for any footballer to write a great story, you know, with the opportunity that has been given to them. And already, they've 
 
 written a great story. You know, that will be there for eternity being the first African country to reach the semi-finals.
 
And - reaching the final October cup yes, it's a big obstacle, they're playing against the defending champion. But one thing that they've taught 
 
 us is that anything is possible through determination and hard work and self-belief.
 
GIOKOS: Yes. I have to ask you this look, I mean, there's a lot of talk about, you know 16 of the Moroccan team members have not been born in 
 
 Morocco. But you and I've had this discussion before, right? It's that African talent usually have to make an arduous trip outside of the 
 
 continent to gain experience to learn, you know, various skills because we just don't have the systems in place. This is something you've been 
 
 fighting for.
 
TSHABALALA: True. I wasn't like I said before, when we had our conversation that, as Africa, we need to invest so much in development and direct 
 
 necessary resources that will help our development that will help us where we can harness talent, that will yield great results in our foot balling 
 
 future.
 
And you need to look at - most of the players they grew up abroad, whether there's, you know, great football structures, where they've been properly 
 
 developed and now it's paying off not only for their careers or their respective teams, but for the national team as well.
 
You know, Morocco now is playing at the highest level in the World Cup, because of that investment that was made years ago. So it's paid off at the 
 
 highest level and at the right time. So it's something that we as Africans, we need to make sure that we are connect, we will invest now, so that for 
 
 future you know, we can benefit of the investment that we make now.
 
GIOKOS: Siphiwe, thank you very much for your time. I'm going to leave the audience with this picture of you scoring against Mexico during 2010. And I 
 
 have to say, I'm quite jealous because I can hear the birds chirping in the background. I could see you're in the bush in Limpopo, by the way.
 
So you're making me miss home, but always good to speak to you. Siphiwe Tshabalala, enjoy. Thank you. All right, we're going to a short break just 
 
 ahead on "Connect the World"; it may be sparking anxious permanence at Buckingham Palace.

GIOKOS: But Netflix is enjoying success with its Harry and Meghan Docu series, find out why, next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
GIOKOS: The new Netflix Docu series on the Duke and Duchess of Sussex is now the platform's most watched documentary debut ever. And its first week 
 
 of release, the show appropriately titled Harry and Megan has logged more than get those 81 million hours watched, along with new revelations about 
 
 their relationship.
 
The series has also highlighted their claims of racism in the British media as well as monarchy. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz looks at how those claims have 
 
 impacted their relationship from the beginning.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): It was a union that brought hope of change, an outsider and woman of color breaking through to 
 
 the very highest level of British society. The couple say systemic racism deep rooted in the UK's media and monarchy, both elite and predominantly 
 
 white institutions, left them isolated and unheard. In a new Netflix documentary, they share their experiences.
 
PRINCE HARRY, DUKE OF SUSSEX: Why should your girlfriend be treated any differently? Why should you get special treatment? Why should she be 
 
 protected? And I said the difference here is the race element.
 
ABDELAZIZ (voice over): Their wedding in 2019 was a celebration of Britain's multiculturalism.
 
KAREN GIBSON, CHOIR CONDUCTOR AT SUSSEX'S WEDDING: It was a sense of us representing. There was that kind of understanding that we weren't just 
 
 standing there for ourselves that we were standing there for communities of color.
 
ABDELAZIZ (voice over): But it's the couple's exit from royal duties and later a bombshell, Oprah interview to explain the move that sparked 
 
 controversy.
 
GIBSON: Did you leave the country because of racism?
 
HARRY: There was a lot; it was a large part of it.
 
MEGHAN, DUCHESS OF SUSSEX: And if a member of his family will comfortably say we've all had to deal with things that are rude, rude and racist are 
 
 not the same.
 
ABDELAZIZ (voice over): Talk of race and racism, often seen as a taboo topic in the UK prompted a reckoning for some, for others defensiveness 
 
 even anger.
 
PIERS MORGAN, CNN REPORTER: This is a two hour trash Athan.
 
ABDELAZIZ (voice over): Piers Morgan, a top TV host stormed off the set.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You know what, that's pretty--
 
MORGAN: Pretty good track - not mine.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No, no, no.
 
ABDELAZIZ (voice over): After a series of rants against smartly. And the UK Society of editors issued a blanket refusal to acknowledge any bigotry at 
 
 any level in the press. Critics called the statement willful ignorance. Buckingham Palace said they would address the matter behind closed doors, 
 
 but Prince William made a public and rare off the cuff remark.
 
But for many others, the first modern royal of color articulated a lived experience that resonates at a time of racial reckoning. In 2020, the UK 
 
 saw huge demonstrations that demanded - confront institutional inequality. This Sussexes say they're driven by that same call to action.
 
HARRY: There is a huge level of unconscious bias. It's education is awareness. And it's a constant; it's a constant work in progress.
 <br>[11:55:00]
 
ABDELAZIZ (voice over): Now unbound by monarchy, the couple are lending their voice to Britain's anti-racism, movement and aggravating its 
 
 detractors. Salma Abdelaziz, CNN London.
