JIM SCIUTTO, CNN ANCHOR: The Biden administration is rolling out a new restriction that will largely block migrants who traveled through other countries from applying for asylum here in the U.S. It is the Biden administration's most restrictive regulation yet on asylum seekers could affect tens of thousands of migrants. Also reminiscent we should note of a Trump era policy at the southern border.
 
KRISTIN FISHER, CNN ANCHOR: CNN White House Reporter Priscilla Alvarez joins us now live from the White House. So Priscilla, what more are you learning?
 
PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: Well, this really underscores the concern within the White House about what is to come in the next few months as they wrestle with mass migration in the western hemisphere. So they're rolling out this asylum rule that would essentially limit access to asylum in the U.S., marking a decade's long or departure from decades long protocol. So what's different here, U.S. law right now allows migrants on U.S. soil, the right to request asylum, the difference now would be that there would be a presumption of asylum and eligibility meaning that if migrants crossed through multiple countries, as they often do, and did not seek refuge in those countries, they will not be able to do so in the United States.
 
Now, of course, there are exceptions to this rule, for example, if someone is denied refuge in another country, but it is still a market difference from where we have been before, and has received fierce criticism from immigrant advocates and Democratic lawmakers who say that this is really reminiscent of Trump era policies.
 
Now, administration officials have rejected that comparison. They said it is not a categorical ban on asylum and one administration official did concede, "This was not our first preference, or even our second, their goal here is to push migrants to apply for legal pathways to the United States from where they are instead of having them journey to the U.S. Mexico border. But the urgency here is important. And the timeline they're looking at is May for this to take effect. It first has to go through a public comment period. And the reason that they're looking at that month is because that COVID era, Trump's restriction that we've talked about so many times known as Title 42, that allows authorities to turn migrants away at the U.S.-Mexico border. That's going to end in May, although of course, it's part of ongoing litigation. But that's the timeline they're focused on. And that's when they anticipate this would take effect, and it's one of the measures that they need. Kris and Jim.
 
SCIUTTO: So if there's a presumption of ineligibility, is that mean, the asylum seekers would not be allowed into the states while they await their cases to be adjudicated?
 
ALVAREZ: Right, when they request that asylum at the border, just because they pass through other countries and didn't seek refuge there, they wouldn't be able to continue on into the U.S.
 
SCIUTTO: Got you. Understood.
 
FISHER: Got it. Priscilla Alvarez live at the White House for us. Thank you.
 
So moments ago, former President Donald Trump leaving Florida to travel to East Palestine, Ohio, the community impacted by that train derailment that spilled toxic chemicals just a few weeks ago. And it comes as President Biden is facing harsh criticism over visiting Ukraine but not the site of that toxic wreck. Mayor of East Palestine telling Fox News that he was really frustrated when he learned of the President's trip abroad.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MAYOR TRENT CONAWAY, EAST PALESTINE, OHIO: That was the biggest slap in the face that tells you right now he doesn't care about us.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Agree.
 
CONAWAY: So he can send every agency he wants to but I found that out this morning and one of the briefings that he was in the Ukraine given millions of dollars away to people over there, not to us and I'm furious.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FISHER: So President Biden responding overnight.
 
SCIUTTO: He posted this photo on Instagram as he was on the phone with the EPA and Ohio State officials. He wrote, "I want affected residents to know that we've got your back. CNN's Dana Bash joins us now.
 
And Dana, this has become something of a political issue here. I mean, you certainly see it on Fox News. There's a reason former President Trump is going to use Palestine. Is the administration aware of this politically? And are they making an effort to devote more resources to the folks there?
 
DANA BASH, CNN ANCHOR and CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, yes, and yes. Just what you just showed the president on the phone, putting out the statement saying, you know, I'm with you. That is an indicator that they get, that this is a political problem. But let's just kind of give the backdrop to what you just showed of residents there on Fox News. The fact that the former President is going. This is Trump country.
 
SCIUTTO: Yeah.
 
BASH: It doesn't -- by the way, it doesn't matter. The entire country is Biden country because he is the current president. But when it comes to the just the raw politics, this is Trump country. So there isn't a lot of political grace that a lot of people in this region have already kind of built in for the current President.
 <br>[10:35:02]
 
Having said that, this has been a problem for weeks now and yes the administration has sent the EPA -- EPA Administrator, Pete Buttigieg, the Transportation Secretary has been out there, but it has -- but it's not the President. And it's politically kind of an easy backdrop for President Biden's political opponents, particularly those who are in the Trump weighing on the national security front in the Republican Party, who are much more populist who don't like the idea of spending, really any money on Ukraine, and instead wanting to do it more at home.
 
FISHER: It reminds me of Republicans pressuring President Biden to go to the southern border. Now they're really pressuring him to go to East Palestine, do you think he's actually going to go?
 
BASH: It's hard to imagine that he won't when he gets back. I mean, if he doesn't go, then it'll probably the people inside the White House and who are gearing up for his own reelection campaign. Understand that just on, again, on the raw politics of this, Ohio is not a place that Democrats are likely to win on a national level anymore, but it doesn't matter, because he needs to show that he cares.
 
SCIUTTO: Yeah, then the criticism.
 
BASH: Not just actually acting like he cares because this administration is working on it. But it's different when you actually have a presidential visit.
 
SCIUTTO: Well, criticism we won't be came too late, right?
 
BASH: Exactly.
 
SCIUTTO: But I mentioned that the administration would be a damage control. Do you want to ask about other things? Talk a lot about 2024 non-presidential candidates, you will also have big Senate races then and arguably a tougher Senate map for Democrats, Democratic Senator Jon Tester announcing he will seek reelection, he's in the state, won't be easy for Democrats to win. What does this tell us about the larger picture?
 
BASH: The larger picture, we are, of course, talking, as you said about the presidential but we know from the last two years that Congress and the makeup of Congress matters so much, particularly in the Senate, which is still so tight. The Democrats are defending twice as many seats as Republicans. A lot of those are safe democratic seats. But there are a handful, maybe even more than a handful that are pretty tight. This is good news for national Democrats that Jon Tester does want to stay because Montana is so, so red. And he is one of the few Democrats who still has name I.D. sort of brand I.D. and can do well among traditionally Republican voting electorate.
 
SCIUTTO: Understood, another thing to watch.
 
BASH: OK, good to see you guys.
 
SCIUTTO: Dana Bash, thank you so much.
 
FISHER: Thanks, Dana. Still to come, a candid conversation with Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz. What's the future of the company in both Russia and China as tensions rise even higher with the United States?
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:42:29]
 
SCIUTTO: Well, right now winter storm is dumping snow from coast to coast with some places seeing as much as 20 inches today all part of a gigantic storm system stretching across 29 states, rural conditions in Flagstaff, Arizona -- Flagstaff, Arizona, of all places.
 
FISHER: Looks like Alaska.
 
SCIUTTO: Yeah.
 
FISHER:  Already more than 1100 flights have been canceled across the country. CNN's Chad Myers joins us now.
 
SCIUTTO: Someone got to bleep there.
 
CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Yeah, it wasn't me.
 
FISHER: Some colorful language there. Chad, which states are going to get it the worst?
 
MYERS: Yeah, I think it's hard to really think about a winter storm warning in the mountains of Los Angeles County and a winter storm warning at the same time in Maine. That's how large the system has now spread itself out. Lots of snow on the Rockies, we'll take that but very significant impacts here across the Dakotas, Minnesota, Wisconsin and an ice storm event for Detroit, for Kalamazoo and maybe even a significant event for the northern suburbs of Chicago.
 
There could be thunder sleet with this. Sleet coming down with lightning and thunder at the same time. We have a lot of moisture here, rain to the south of Toledo. But it's trying to push itself up into air that's 31 degrees. Rain in 31 never go together very well. Here is the area that will see the most significant icing but from Hamilton to London across into Detroit and Windsor, Sarnia all the way into Chicago, if you get a quarter inch of ice or half of an inch of ice, does it really matter. No, it is going to be treacherous out there. The snow is to the north of that. And that's what we expect. This is how it all works out as we work our way into the afternoon hours. We'll see Detroit in that pink. That's the rain snow mix even a little bit of sleet and freezing rain. But knows how long it stays in the same place. And then the snow is in behind it.
 
Minneapolis, you're probably still looking at an additional 12 inches of snow if not a little bit more in the suburbs. And then finally it ends up in Maine by tomorrow afternoon. So this is a big storm with lots and lots of impacts. Back to you.
 
SCIUTTO: All right, thunder sleet, first of all, it's scary. Second of all, Bryce in the control room calls that as his band name going forward, Chad Myers, so just all are aware.
 
FISHER: That's not a bad band name.
 
SCIUTTO: Not a bad band name. Chad Myers, thanks so much.
 
MYERS: I can't play any instruments, so don't count me in.
 
SCIUTTO: Neither can I. Starbucks was one of many companies that pulled stores out of Russia following its invasion of Ukraine. Now, it says, there is no going back.
 <br>[10:45:01]
 
FISHER: So what does that mean for the company's 6000 locations in China. CNN's Poppy Harlow sat down with Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz to discuss what the future looks like in both of those countries?
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR (voice-over): Outside the U.S., Starbucks plays a significant role on the world stage. After Russia invaded Ukraine, Starbucks pulled out of Russia.
 
(On camera): Is Starbucks gone from Russia for good, do you think?
 
HOWARD SCHULTZ, INTERIM CEO, STARBUCKS: I think Starbucks is gone for Russia for good, a very unfortunate situation, I think we did the right thing.
 
HARLOW: And in China, where Starbucks has some 6000 stores and opens a new one every 10 hours, Schultz calls the business headwinds unprecedented, as for U.S.-China relations,
 
SCHULTZ: I'm going to say something that I probably will be controversial. But here's what I believe, having been the China's so often, and -- and trying to understand the differences, I don't believe China is an enemy of America.
 
HARLOW: You don't?
 
SCHULTZ: No. I think China is a fierce adversary, especially economically. HARLOW: That's what you said to me four years ago, it hasn't changed?
 
SCHULTZ: The United States and China independently and together, we'll be better off, if we can figure out a way to collectively co-author a global strategy. I don't believe in my heart of hearts, that China wants to go to war with America, and America wants to go to war with China.
 
HARLOW: Human rights in China, both the Trump administration and the Biden administration have labeled what is happening in Xinjiang province to the Uyghurs Muslim minority population genocide, both administrations have. You run a huge business there. And your company stands for ethics and human rights here.
 
SCHULTZ: Yeah.
 
HARLOW: How do you think about that? You must think about that internally, and how you make business decisions investing there, whether there's a line where you pull out?
 
SCHULTZ: You know, I tell you how I try and think about it, I am a corporate citizen, trying to do business in China in a way that's consistent with the values of America. And most importantly, I carry the American flag around the world as an American company. And I'm so proud of the fact that Starbucks is succeeding in China as an American company. And the values of Starbucks are being embraced by Chinese consumers. As a result of the experience that we create. I can't be in a position to dictate governmental policy in China, but I can demonstrate what good practices and good values are about.
 
HARLOW: Have you met Xi Jinping? 
 
SCHULTZ: I have.
 
HARLOW: What's your take on him?
 
SCHULTZ: I don't have an intimate relationship with him. He clearly has an agenda for China that is hard to understand and predict. He loves his country, like we love ours. But I think that he's pragmatic enough to truly understand that his vision for China, in my view, would be enhanced by cooperating in a way that builds good relationships with America, but I can't speak for the Chinese government or President Xi.
 
HARLOW (voice-over): Back at home, Schultz finds himself among the more optimistic on the U.S. economy.
 
SCHULTZ: I don't see a recession coming as a result of this. I think inflation will come down towards the end of the year. I think we've hit peak inflation. I think again, the saber rattling about the recession from so-called economic experts. I think there's going to be a soft-landing.
 
HARLOW: Saber rattling.
 
SCHULTZ: Yeah. HARLOW: No one had anything to worry about on the economy?
 
SCHULTZ: We've been worried but we just can't make the American people so nervous.
 
HARLOW: OK.
 
SCHULTZ: I think there's going to be a soft landing. And I think for Starbucks, I don't think our prices are going up.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
SCIUTTO: Thanks so much for Poppy Harlow for that interview. Well, some good news, hitting the gym can do more than build muscles. A new study says it can give a major boost to your brain as you age. We'll have more on that coming up.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:53:18]
 
SCIUTTO: So we already kind of knew that being active, whether you're young or old, I won't say we're.
 
FISHER: It's OK, Jim.
 
SCIUTTO: I am in those categories, but has both physical and mental benefits.
 
FISHER: Yeah, but according to a new study, any amount of physical activity starting at any age, seems to help long term cognitive health. So we're going to bring in CNN Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen. And, you know, Jim and I were just talking about this. It is like one of those things that you know is good for you. But now you have the study and the science to kind of back it up.
 
ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, absolutely. I think we sort of intuitively know that when we exercise. We feel better. We think more clearly. What these folks did was that they studied more than 1400 people for decades. They started when they were 36. And they ended when they were 69. And they tracked how much physical activity they were doing. And they found that folks who did exercise all through that period of time that they had better cognitive abilities, but you didn't have to start at 36. You could start later. It's not exactly clear what the tie in is between physical activity and brain health. But it can be that it reduces inflammation, it gets new blood vessels to start growing, or maybe you just -- you just feel better when you exercise, you sleep better. Therefore, your cognition is better. Kristin, Jim?
 
SCIUTTO: So question, is there a particular physical? I mean, we're just showing a video of like lifting weights, is it -- is it the whole range of stuff you do in the gym?
 
COHEN: It's the whole range of things. We even just walking, walking can be such a great physical activity, and it doesn't have to be a whole lot. It can just be once a month and this study even people who just did it once a month had better cognitive abilities. Now, certainly you should do more but, you know, any little bit helps.
 <br>[10:55:04]
 
SCIUTTO: All right. Well, we will start to add that back to our list and we're going to head right to the gym right after the show, apparently -- 
 
FISHER: We're going to go be active as soon as we get out of these chairs, right?
 
SCIUTTO: Exactly.
 
FISHER: Elizabeth Cohen, thank you so much. And thanks, all of you for joining us today. I'm Kristin Fisher. It's been a pleasure to be with you for day two, Jim.
 
SCIUTTO: Yeah, we got another couple days, stuck with me. I'm Jim Sciutto. At This Hour With Kate Bolduan starts right after a quick break.
