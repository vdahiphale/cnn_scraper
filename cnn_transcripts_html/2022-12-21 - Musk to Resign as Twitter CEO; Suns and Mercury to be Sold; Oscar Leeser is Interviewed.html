<br>[08:30:00] 
 
KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN ANCHOR: Wow, lots going on. Who - do you think he already has someone in mind to take over? What's your sense of where this all stands?
 
OLIVER DARCY, CNN SENIOR MEDIA REPORTER: I'm not sure because it is impossible to get into his head. But I don't think this is super surprising given that he said last month he was eventually going to want to step down and appoint someone else to run Twitter. And I think he's looking probably at those Tesla shares. And they have slid quite a bit since he took over Twitter. About 30 percent. And that's far worse than how other car companies have performed during that time. And so I think Tesla investors want him to stop sleeping on the couch at Twitter and actually focus on that company. And I think he knows that his wealth is tied to Tesla shares. So, if this continues, it's not going to be good.
 
So, not super surprising and it's unclear still, how long is it going to take to find a new - a new head of Twitter. He says it's - it - there's no one really in line. There are a number of questions that still remain, Kaitlan.
 
COLLINS: Well, I think they're probably - I mean he's been running it and look at all of the back and forth that we've - we've talked about that. 
 
Donna's kind of asking this question about, what are other people -- are there other sites people are going to, leaving Twitter, trying to use other platforms given just tweeting these days you have this risk if you're a reporter of getting banned or of posting certain locations and these policy changes that happen just on a whim. 
 
DARCY: Yes, like, he banned the other day other people going to other sites. I think he was almost trying to lock the exit doors as people tried fleeing Twitter.
 
You know, I'm trying out some of those other ones. I'm on Mastodon, for instance. Trying out to see if it works as well as Twitter.
 
I think the bottom line is there is no Twitter replacement at the moment. But who's to say if Twitter actually, you know, does become an untenable situation for people, whether those other sites could get some more funding and make -- improve that user experience. 
 
COLLINS: Yes. All right, Oliver Darcy, thank you.
 
DARCY: Thank you.
 
DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR: Where is everybody else going to go? And before we get - listen, Bomani Jones is here. I just want to bring him in. He's here to talk about the Phoenix Suns and something else. 
 
You said you want out.
 
BOMANI JONES, HOST, HBO/HBO MAX "GAME THEORY WITH BOMANI JONES": Yes. Stay for what? The question I have for everybody is, stay for what? I think journalists care a lot about staying because we'd be able to parlay this into a whole lot of money. But what exactly are we getting positive about or what the Twitter experience has evolved into over really the last five or six years, right? And people are like, oh, we've got to go find another one. Another hell hole? No, no, no, I'm good. I just think we all need out.
 
LEMON: This is weird, but have I told you lately that I love you? I agree with you 100 percent. I just --
 
COLLINS: I'm the only person who likes Twitter at this table. 
 
LEMON: I just - it's not that I dislike Twitter. Listen, I think there is an important place for Twitter in the world, but it has become a cesspool. 
 
JONES: Yes.
 
COLLINS: Yes.
 
LEMON: It is so toxic that -
 
JONES: We don't need all this access to each other and our thoughts. Our thoughts are not that important. And most of them that we share ultimately wind up either being at best benign or at worse ultimately damaging. 
 
LEMON: Yes. OK, thank you, Oliver.
 
COLLINS: Thanks, Oliver.
 
LEMON: Let's talk about why Bomani's here. We're here - he's here to talk about embattled NBA owner Robert Sarver has agreed to sell his team - his teams, with an "s," for $4 billion. This is according to multiple reports. That's a new record for an NBA franchise. Sarver began seeking buyers for the Phoenix Suns and the WNBA's Phoenix Mercury. That was back in September after he was suspended for years and fined $10 million. The investigation determined that Sarver engaged in hostile and racial insensitive workplace behavior. 
 
A group led by mortgage tycoon Mat Ishbia is set to purchase a controlling stake in the two teams. Ishbia played college basketball at Michigan State, was part of the school's national championship team in 2000.
 
And Bomani Jones is selling - I said Bomani, question, he's not selling a team. But the question is, Bomani, is selling the team for a record $4 billion, is that really much of a punishment? 
 
JONES: Well, it's less of a punishment than the trade you have to make in order to get to do it out of the league. Like, the thing you can't account for in this is, the team is his, right? Like, you can just confiscate somebody's stuff. This is the same thing that happened with Donald Sterling. Now, if it wasn't a punishment, then the dude would have sold the team already. He could have got this $4 billion at another point, but he did not want to do that, right?
 
So, making people like this do things does ultimately serve as a punishment, it just so happens he's going to get $4 billion on the back end of it. You're not going to put a lot of consequences on super rich people that they actually feel momentarily. 
 
LEMON: You know you took me back to -- when you said Donald Sterling - Sterling - that, I mean, that was what - what was that 13 years ago?
 
JONES: About eight years ago, going on nine.
 
COLLINS: Wow.
 
LEMON: 2012, 2013 that that happened.
 
Listen, this investigation into Sarver's alleged behavior found that he repeatedly used the "n" word when recounting the statement of others, engaged in instances of inequitable conduct toward female employees, made inappropriate sex related comments in the workplace. Is there - what stood out, I mean, about this investigation to you? All of this?
 
JONES: Well, Baxter Holmes of ESPN, who's been at the forefront of reporting this,  has a report this week that was most interesting which was, after the word had gotten out that they got Sarver out of there, that there is an employee townhall and the question was asked, what about the rest of these dudes, because if we're saying that this was a larger cultural issue, then it doesn't just go away because the owner goes away. 
 <br>[08:35:00]
 
And so there were about, I think, four executives specifically that it was put in place in the agreement that in order for them to be removed, it would have to be something in writing from Sarver to say it was OK for them, presumably because those guys knew where the bodies were buried. So now that Sarver has sold the team, what's so important now is that this franchise can actually start over because until they did this, a lot of people that apparently were still responsible for the sorts of behaviors that were going on with this team were still going to be there. That's why, is it a punishment to make him sell the team. No. But does that then allow the team the clean slate, yes. And that's probably more important than trying to put a hammer down on Sarver. COLLINS: The other thing we've been watching this morning is the French Football Federation is calling out and condemning the racism that the French football team placed - faced during the World Cup when they were playing Argentina. And it's not knew. But seeing them condemn it, seeing them ask others to condemn it is important for people to do that. It is on this world stage kind of point. 
 
JONES: Yes, well, I have another question when this happens, and this gets in line with the hell hole that we were talking about. How many of these people who are sending these things are actually people, right? Like, when you wade through and start figuring out who are the bots, who are the trolls. How many of them are actually people? Like, I'm sure that there is a decent number of people who came in and said these things, but it's so easy to amplify the idea of the animus because so many trolls are at place. 
 
And then we come around and we're like, man, all these people on Twitter are saying these things. And if you turned up the filters that they used to try to get rid of the bots, it may wind up being like my timeline does after I come on one of these shows, where if I look at everybody, it seems like the world's coming down. If I get rid of the new accounts and the ones with fake pictures, it's four people, right?
 
COLLINS: Wow.
 
JONES: And that's - that's why I say, we need to break free from the hell hole because it's been so manipulated to the point where I can't tell if people are people. And I do wonder about that in this case. They've got a big, broad problem with racism in Europe. It's not a problem with racism in soccer. It's really a problem with racism in the world. This just happens to be the way that it comes across and it makes the game look bad and so all the people come down and they're like, hey, we condemn racism. But it ain't soccer that's making those people racist, it's racism that's making those people racists.
 
LEMON: Bomani Jones, come back early and often. Digging the turtleneck too.
 
JONES: Appreciate it. And definitely the early part. You guys - the early we do.
 
LEMON: Hey, look, it's 8:30. Come on now.
 
COLLINS: This is late to us.
 
LEMON: Yes.
 
COLLINS: That's what's sad.
 
LEMON: Thanks, Bomani.
 
Hey, listen, Bomani, season two of "Game Theory with Bomani Jones" kicks off on HBO Max on January 20th. 
 
The Department of Homeland Security has moved more than 9,000 migrants out of El Paso over the last week. We're going to talk about Title 42 and the surge in migrants with the major of El Paso, Texas. That's next.
 
COLLINS: And ahead of President Zelenskyy's surprise visit to Washington, President Biden just tweeted, I hope you're having a good flight, Volodymyr. I'm thrilled to have you here. We have much to discuss. Much more on his historic visit. That's ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[08:42:32]
 
LEMON: So, the Biden administration has told the Supreme Court that they should let Title 42 end. The White House wants the justices to reject an emergency bid from several GOP-led states to keep the Trump era immigration policy in place while legal challenges play out. The White House had been preparing for the end of the program, which officials say would have led to a surge in migrant crossings. 
 
So, let's discuss now with Oscar Leeser. He is the Democratic mayor of El Paso, Texas, which has seen a huge influx of migrants in recent weeks.
 
We're so glad that you could join us here on CNN THIS MORNING. Thank you so much. 
 
So, you made the decision to call a state of emergency over the weekend. Why is that, sir? 
 
MAYOR OSCAR LEESER (D), EL PASO, TEXAS: Well, it was very important that, as the temperatures were starting to drop and increases in crossings, that our visitors into our country, the asylum seekers, and also the citizens of El Paso would be safe. And I -- it was very evident with those temperatures, you know, near 20 degrees, that we really needed to call a state of emergency. And it was important to me because I can tell you that, you know, it's -- I've had a lot of people tell me you need to call a state of emergency, but really it needed to be at the right time when resources were needed. And this was the perfect time to do that at this point. 
 
LEMON: Listen, I'm wondering, we've been watching - I'm wondering if you're seeing it. Obviously, you're seeing it firsthand. But we've seen the pictures there on the border. Our David Culver is there. And, I mean, there are lines and lines of people. They're building campfires trying to stay warm. So far I think El Paso, 9,000 migrants out of - they've moved out of El Paso, the DHS has. 
 
Can your community sustain that many migrants? 
 
LEESER: Well, one of the things we are getting prepared, whether Title 42 gets lifted or not, to make sure that we have the proper resources. Now, can we sustain this over the long-term period? Absolutely not. But it's very important -- our community is working together, whether it's the county, the state, senate, our congressmen, we're all working together as one. And, you know, we've got - we've gotten two empty schools. So yesterday we starred a contract with our public schools to be able to house in that area. The Red Cross came down on Monday and passed (ph) 10,000 cots. The federal government's been really a great partner to us, to give us the resources that we need. So we are prepared, whether Title 42 is lifted or not. We -- we're working on having cots in the convention center. 
 <br>[08:45:00]
 
The county judge is doing a really good job of doing his resources so we can combine all our resources to work as one.
 
LEMON: So, listen, the - you know the Biden administration, they don't want this to be permanent. I'm wondering how you feel about that. What do you want the administration to do at this point?
 
LEESER: Well, like I said, right now, you know, we do know that the - that we do have a broken immigration process and it needs to be fixed. So, right now, as a community, we have a very warm, welcoming community and we're working really hard, like I said, to have the resources we need. And we have received the resources to continue to help us. But, you know, this is strictly a band aid on something that needs to be fixed in the very short term because, like you said a minute ago, it's something this we not - we cannot sustain. 
 
LEMON: Yes. 
 
I had the Arkansas governor on, Asa Hutchinson, who is a Republican, and he says while the buck does stop with the administration, he does believe the onus is on Congress to act. He believes it's a band-aid as well. 
 
Do you think there's room for bipartisanship in Washington? And would you like to see that? Obviously, yes.
 
LEESER: Well, it's obvious that we need to work together and regardless of parties because this is a U.S., United States, problem that we all need to work together. It's not an El Paso problem. It's a lot bigger than El Paso. And I honestly believe it's bigger than the United States. We need to work with the U.N., to work with other countries to be able to come up with a program that becomes humanitarian for everyone. 
 
LEMON: Mayor Leeser, thank you for your time. Best of luck to you. And Merry Christmas. Thanks.
 
LEESER: Thank you. Merry Christmas to you all. 
 
LEMON: Thank you.
 
So this morning's number is my age, 23. Harry Enten is here to break it all down. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[08:50:24]
 
COLLINS: All right, you're looking at pictures of Marquette, Michigan, and Minneapolis, Minnesota. More like minnesnowta (ph). I'm shivering just looking at these pictures and it's going to get worse. A fast- approaching holiday storm, which is being called a winter bomb cyclone, a set to bring dangerously cold temperatures to millions of Americans across the country from the northeast to the Rockies. 
 
So, CNN's senior data reporter, Harry Enten is here. 
 
Harry, we don't like being cold. 
 
HARRY ENTEN, CNN SENIOR DATA REPORTER: No. Whoa.
 
LEMON: We had a bomb cyclone this time last year. 
 
ENTEN: We've had a number of bomb cyclones. 
 
LEMON: No, it was like February. 
 
ENTEN: Yes, we've had a number of bomb cyclones. 
 
LEMON: But why did -- why did it go from 23 my age to 21? What happened? 
 
ENTEN: OK. So, let's talk about this morning's number. What is it? This morning's number is 21. New York City's Christmas Eve high temperature forecast. The temperature changed. The high temperature forecast went from 23 down to 21, the new forecast. So even colder for Christmas Eve. After a high temp of 54 degrees on Friday. So, we're going to see a 23 degree temperature drop. 
 
Now, I want to put this in some historical perspective. Christmas Eve weather and expand it out to just more than New York City to give you an idea of how far reaching these cold temperatures are. 
 
So, we've got 21 in New York, 27 in Atlanta, nine in Chicago. You want to go down to Miami to escape the cold but it's only 62 degrees there for a high temp. Look at this, the coldest temperature in the last 80 years for Christmas Eve. Yes, in New York, yes, in Atlanta, second coldest in Chicago, third coldest in Miami. It is the first time all four would have a bottom three high temp if this does, in fact, happen. So we're talking freezing temperatures up and down the eastern seaboard and even into the Midwest. 
 
LEMON: OK. So, I live here. 
 
ENTEN: Yes. 
 
LEMON: I used to live there. 
 
ENTEN: Yes. 
 
LEMON: And there. 
 
ENTEN: Yes. 
 
LEMON: And by the lake. 
 
ENTEN: Yes. 
 
LEMON: When you get that lake-effect snow and the wind coming off the lake, it is crazy. And I'm going here after Christmas. 
 
ENTEN: I - you're -
 
LEMON: So, there you go. I - you've got -- you've got the whole thing covered for me. 
 
ENTEN: We - we got the whole complete Don board. 
 
But I do have - I do have a bit of good news , though, if you're -- 
 
COLLINS: What about the - is he going to the North Pole next? 
 
ENTEN: Going to the North Pole.
 
Santa will still be able to deliver your presents because it's minus 40 is the average winter temperature in the North Pole. So don't worry, kids, Santa is well on his way. And even for the Jews like me, Santa will deliver. He'll team up with Hanukkah Harry. It's all going to be great.
 
LEMON: Hanukkah Harry.
 
ENTEN: But I also have bad news for you. The energy bills are going to be sky high because look at the utility gas prices year over year.
 
LEMON: Oh, boy.
 
ENTEN: Up 15 percent.
 
LEMON: Yes.
 
ENTEN: Electricity, up 14 percent, depending on how exactly you heat your home. So, look, good news is, Santa will be able to deliver gifts. The bad news is, you're going to pay higher energy prices. 
 
But I do have one question for you guys, do you prefer -- would you rather live through a really hot summer or a really cold winter? 
 
LEMON: Hot summer. 
 
COLLINS: Hot summer. We're southerners, so, you know, it's our nature. 
 
LEMON: We're southerners. Yes. I was saying, when I -- when I first moved to the northeast and I got -- went to the beach, I was like, why is this water so cold? We like - we like bath water. It's like bath water on the Gulf.
 
COLLINS: Like, we go to the beach in the summertime, like in July, which no one else does. 
 
LEMON: Yes.
 
ENTEN: I must admit, I prefer a really cold winter. It's why I went to school in New Hampshire. But, you know what, we are pretty equal, though. Slightly more people. 
 
LEMON: I mean, come on. Look. Really? Is there a choice? Is that a real choice? 
 
ENTEN: You know what, you can always put on more layers, you can't take off so many. 
 
COLLINS: Those people that answer don't fall off the ski lift like I do. I'm going to go to the beach instead. 
 
ENTEN: All right. It's safer, I guess, except for the sharks in the water. Be careful of those. 
 
LEMON: Thank you, Harry. 
 
ENTEN: Thank you. 
 
COLLINS: Thanks, Harry.
 
LEMON: Hanukkah Harry. 
 
COLLINS: All right, President Zelenskyy's surprise visit to Washington comes on the heels of the anniversary of another historic trip. We're going to look back at history, ahead. 
 
LEMON: Hanukkah Harry. 
 
COLLINS: Hi. And my sister's in the studio. I should have given you a shutout. We would have put you in the bump shot.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[08:58:14]
 
COLLINS: All right, it was 81 years ago tomorrow that Winston Churchill visited Washington as the world was in the throes of World War II. Pearl Harbor had just been hit by Japanese forces in an attack that killed more than 2,400 Americans and drew the U.S. into the war. 
 
President Roosevelt, after declaring December 7th a day of infamy, had expressed concern about the prime minister sailing across the Atlantic. But Churchill did so anyway to fortify his nation's most important alliance. It was during that visit that Churchill addressed a joint session of Congress the day after Christmas, rallying the American people with these words and steeling them for what was to come. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
WINSTON CHURCHILL: What kind of a people do they think we are? Is it possible they do not realize that we shall never cease to persevere against them, until they have been taught a lesson which they and the world will never forget. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COLLINS: Churchill, that day, became only the second foreign leader to speak before a joint session of Congress in American history. Today, President Zelenskyy is going to do the same. That trip is -- I'm an historical nerd of course -- but he was there
 
 for three weeks staying at the White House. 
 
LEMON: If my memory serves me well, I think it was one of a number, I think three speeches that he gave, but that one was the main one, right, speaking in front of Congress. But everyone - everyone is going to be watching this moment today. I think all cameras, all eyes are going to be on Zelenskyy. It kind of reminded me of the moment that -- you were there covering it. Do you remember when -- when Boris Johnson went to Kyiv and they were calling that sort of a Churchill moment -
 
COLLINS: Yes.
 
LEMON: Because he -- they were walking around the capital as the war was raging around them and I think Kyiv had just been -- Ukraine had just taken back Kyiv from the Russians. 
 <br>[09:00:03]
 
So, we'll see what these moments play out, how they look with the current president of the United States meeting with Zelenskyy. 
 
COLLINS: Yes, and just the historical parallels. You know, they say history doesn't repeat itself but it rhymes. But to see a U.S. president concerned about him coming across to address Congress and now Zelenskyy's doing the same.  
 
LEMON: Yes. The security that this visit took, that's a study.
 
COLLINS: Yes. Yes.
 
LEMON: That's going to be a study and a big story that we're going to talk about.
 
Thanks, everybody, for joining us. We appreciate it.
 
COLLINS: We've got a busy day.
 
LEMON: Oh, we forgot.
 
COLLINS: We've got a special guest in the house.
 
LEMON: A special guest.
 
COLLINS: We've replaced Anderson Cooper as the barista here on set and with my sister, Kelsey (ph), who is here visiting.
 
LEMON: That's Kelsey.
 
KELSEY (ph): Good morning.
 
LEMON: Hi, Kelsey. Enjoy. Enjoy New York.
 
KELSEY: Hi. Where we going for breakfast?
 
COLLINS: And CNN "NEWSROOM" starts right now.</pre>
