ELENI GIOKOS, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Hello and welcome to CONNECT THE WORLD, I am Eleni Giokos, in for Becky Anderson, live from 
 
 Dubai this hour. 
 
NATO's secretary general says the alliance to support Ukraine is making a difference on the battlefield. Jens Stoltenberg spoke ahead of the meeting 
 
 of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Brussels, that he says is happening at a critical time in the war. 
 
He says defense ministers are looking at ways to further help Ukraine. Inside the country, the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog chief has started his visit 
 
 to the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant. 
 
Rafael Grossi is concerned that the plant could get caught up in Ukraine's counteroffensive. Now we are watching developments in Ukraine with our 
 
 team, Sam Kiley in the capital of Kyiv will join us in a few moments. 
 
We also have Natasha Bertrand at the Pentagon with more on the NATO meeting. 
 
Natasha, great to see you. Look, we have U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in Brussels as well, the U.S. is ramping up assistance to Ukraine. 
 
What are we expecting from this meeting?
 
NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Eleni. We are expecting them to essentially figure out a way to tailor what they could 
 
 give to Ukraine at this moment in terms of military equipment, to what Ukraine actually needs to sustain that major counteroffensive which is 
 
 currently underway. 
 
Ukrainian minister of defense, Alexei Reznikov, actually briefed allies at the Defense Contact Group today about that counteroffensive battlefield 
 
 operations and what the Ukrainians need, of course, including how many battle tanks they will need. 
 
The kind of air defense systems. And the U.S., U.K. and other countries committed a new package of air defense munitions to Ukraine, because, of 
 
 course, Russia continues to bombard the entire country with missiles. 
 
That is something that Ukraine really needs in order to protect its skies during the counteroffensive. That will be significant in terms of helping 
 
 Ukraine maintain its momentum against the Russians while, at the same time, being able to protect its civilians. 
 
The Ukraine contact group also discussed F-16 training, those fourth generation fighter aircraft, that the Ukrainians have so desperately 
 
 wanted. The Netherlands and Denmark have set up a training coalition and they say they will begin training Ukrainian pilots on these advanced 
 
 fighter jets in the coming weeks. 
 
There was an update provided on that. And of course, an update provided on the Leopard tanks and when and how more of those will be able to get into 
 
 Ukraine. Of course they are using, the Ukrainians are using these tanks by the hundreds in this counteroffensive. 
 
Many of them are being damaged if not destroyed. So a lot of this Ukraine contact group meeting was really focused on how to replenish Ukraine's 
 
 stocks at the moment and, of course, committing to remaining alongside Ukraine and committing the military equipment for the long haul. 
 
Something Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said was really a priority for the alliance, Eleni. 
 
GIOKOS:  And look, Jens Stoltenberg saying that NATO's supplying of weapons and assistance is absolutely vital for Ukraine right now. 
 
What is also interesting is that NATO is also thinking about its own defense and deterrence as well, also thinking about its own stockpiles, 
 
 replenishing of stockpiles and procurement as well. This is also being viewed from a macro perspective in terms of NATO's longer term 
 
 capabilities. 
 
BERTRAND:  Absolutely. Something the NATO defense ministers will actually be discussing tomorrow, when they meet again in Brussels, is this issue of 
 
 replenishing their own stockpiles because, of course, a big issue with keeping the alliance united is whether all of the allies can remain 
 
 committed to sending so much military equipment which is depleting their own stockpiles of really key weapons systems. 
 
The NATO defense ministers will be discussing this very issue with industry, really pushing the defense industry to ramp up production of 
 
 these key systems, so they can replenish their own stockpiles as well as continuing to give Ukraine what they need to maintain the counteroffensive. 
 
Nobody really knows how long it will continue, right?
 
This is something the Ukrainians have been tempering expectations about. 
 <br>[10:05:00]
 
BERTRAND:  They say they would really like these F-16 fighter jets, that it will be difficult for them to take back a significant amount of territory 
 
 without them. 
 
All of this is really going into the necessity of keeping the alliance together and how they can maintain their own stockpiles while, at the same 
 
 time, of course, keeping Ukraine equipped for the long haul, Eleni. 
 
GIOKOS:  Yes, and also, getting everyone to agree in terms of spending, relative to GDP. Jens Stoltenberg is talking about the magic number, 2 
 
 percent. It should be a minimum requirement. That is what he calls shared security. 
 
In the meantime, we still have Ukraine knocking on the door of NATO, saying, look, we need to get into this alliance. 
 
So much that needs to be discussed here, right?
 
BERTRAND:  This is a key topic of discussion as well, getting all the NATO allies to increase their spending. This has been a subject of consternation 
 
 among the NATO allies for years. If you recall, the Trump administration was adamant about getting allies to increase their defense spending. 
 
We now see yet again it has become an issue. I think the message coming out of NATO at this point is that every ally is saying they are doing 
 
 everything that they can to equip Ukraine, to protect NATO because, of course, they feel this is not just a war in Ukraine but potentially an 
 
 existential war for the future of Europe. 
 
That if they don't continue to boost their spending, to replenish their equipment that they are giving to Ukraine, that could make them a 
 
 vulnerable to a potential Russian attack on NATO soil. 
 
Obviously, this will be a key subject of discussion here. It is expected to continue to be an issue because some European countries do not necessarily 
 
 want to spend as much as some other countries do. They don't have that kind of equipment, the kind of budget that other large countries do in order to 
 
 commit. 
 
But at the same time, there is an acknowledgment that every country, including the 50 countries that met for the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, 
 
 they are really digging in. That is the terminology that Defense Secretary Austin used. And they are prepared to do so for as long as it takes to 
 
 support Ukraine, Eleni. 
 
GIOKOS:  Natasha Bertrand, brilliant analysis. Thank you so much.
 
We have Sam Kiley with us, he's in Kyiv.
 
Jens Stoltenberg saying we're seeing fierce fighting and the offensive has been a long time coming.
 
What are you learning?
 
SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  It's been a long time coming, it's been widely telegraphed, not least by the Ukrainian government 
 
 itself. And it's got off to an interesting and mixed start with raids into Russian territory, attacks on Russian logistics bases behind the front 
 
 lines and indeed, inside Russia itself. 
 
Special Forces raids, attacks and killings of senior officers. And now we're seeing much more of the grinding ground fighting particularly in 
 
 Zaporizhzhya, where the Ukrainians are claiming to have made small advances. 
 
But that will be part of the back and forth before there is, if there ever is, a Ukrainian breakthrough. That is an extremely well defended area of 
 
 the front line. 
 
Less problematic at the moment for the Ukrainians is the front line among Bakhmut, where they are enjoying a degree of momentum in their campaign to 
 
 free areas that were captured earlier this year toward the end of last year by the Russians. 
 
They have been advancing in the latest bound. The deputy minister of defense is saying that Ukraine has captured some three kilometers, two 
 
 miles. It seems about that they may have recaptured about 20 square kilometers in the Bakhmut front. 
 
That's significant because it means the Russian forces are starting to get split in terms of their priorities. 
 
But really, what the Ukrainians want to do with the sort of extra weapons Natasha was talking about there, particularly short range and medium range 
 
 surface-to-air missiles, anti-aircraft missiles, which will be deployed close to the front line, to try to offset the dominance in the air that the 
 
 Russians have. 
 
And the Russians are using that dominance to really hammer the Ukrainian attempts to break through, Eleni. 
 
GIOKOS:  Yes. Sam Kiley, thank you so much for that update. 
 
Later this hour, we have a remarkable story from Sam to show you. He has an exclusive report from the front lines, talking to soldiers from a Ukrainian 
 
 special operations unit. Here's a quick look. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KILEY (voice-over):  Formed when Russia invaded Ukraine last, year this team of experienced veterans works in a secret realm under the intelligence 
 
 services. 
 <br>[10:10:00]
 
KILEY (voice-over):  They're tasked with tactical work, seeking strategic effect, as Ukraine's counteroffensive takes shape. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GIOKOS:  We'll be bringing you that full story in about 20 minutes, right here, on CONNECT THE WORLD. 
 
Now a frantic search for more survivors off the coast of southern Greece after a migrant boat carrying hundreds of people sank in the deep waters of 
 
 the Mediterranean. The U.N. believes up to 750 people were on board, including dozens of children. 
 
At least 78 people did not survive; more than 100 have been rescued. It is believed a sudden shift in weight made the boat capsize, then sink early on 
 
 Wednesday. A Red Cross volunteer says he has never seen a rescue like this. 
 
Survivors have been taken to the Greek city of Kalamata. We have Melissa Bell standing by in Kalamata for us. 
 
It is absolutely tragic, the story. Seeing those aerial shots of the boats, it just shows how many people were on those boats and the numbers don't add 
 
 up right now. 
 
What are the Greek authorities telling you?
 
MELISSA BELL, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, we're getting two very different pictures, one from the Greek authorities and another from 
 
 NGOs of exactly how the timeline was, what exactly happened about 50 miles off the coast here of Kalamata, on the night, of Tuesday to Wednesday. 
 
What we know is that it was in the very early hours of Wednesday that the ship went down. From the Greek authorities, we hear that they tried to help 
 
 this ship in distress but were repeatedly told that it wanted to carry on. 
 
The migrants on board wanted to carry on to Italy. But for migrant NGOs, those who work with these ships regularly in the Mediterranean, we're 
 
 getting a very different idea, Eleni, of exactly what happened. 
 
Several of them are saying that, for many hours before the ship sunk, the Coast Guards of both Italy and Greece had been made aware of the fact that 
 
 this ship was in distress. One of the questions this hour, even as hope grows faint for survivors, is how the ship could've been allowed to sink. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BELL (voice-over):  A dramatic rescue at sea. The Greek Coast Guard pulling a group of people to safety, the lucky ones. Survivors of yet another 
 
 catastrophe on the deadliest migrant crossing in the world, the Mediterranean. 
 
Somehow, 104 people manage to leave this overcrowded fishing boat alive. But hundreds that you see here did not. Most still missing in the deepest 
 
 part of the Mediterranean Sea, just 50 miles off the Greek coast. 
 
Onshore, medics rush to preserve the lives of those that survived, their bodies in trauma after hours in the water. All are men. Aid workers tell me 
 
 others were unable to get out. 
 
IPPOKRATIS EFSTATHIOU, SOCIAL WORKER, IASIS:  What we are getting from the people is that there were mostly the kids and the women, they had been 
 
 locked inside the basement of the boat. 
 
BELL (voice-over):  As the search for bodies continues, there are questions about how long it took to try to help these people. The vessel started out 
 
 from Libya, heading toward Italy and called for help on Tuesday afternoon, one charity has said. 
 
It claims the authorities knew for hours that the vessel was in peril but that a rescue operation was, quote, "not launched until it was too late." 
 
At this stage, there is little hope that more survivors will be found. Those that did make it are deeply traumatized and their future in Europe is 
 
 far from certain. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
BELL:  Of course, all those questions are yet to be answered but at the heart of this tragedy, of course, also, Eleni, is the fact that there are 
 
 so many families even now. From Egypt, the United Kingdom, Germany or still in Syria, desperately trying to figure out whether the loved ones that they 
 
 knew to be attempting the crossing over these few days were amongst those on that ship -- Eleni. 
 
GIOKOS:  Melissa, thank you so much for that story. We appreciate it. 
 
North Korea has fired at least two short-range ballistic missiles, that's according to South Korea and Japan. The missiles are believed to have 
 
 landed in the waters inside Japan's exclusive economic zone. 
 
North Korea had recently denounced the U.S. and South Korea's joint live fire military drills. I want to go now to Paula Hancocks, live in Seoul for 
 
 us. 
 
Great to see you, Paula.
 
What is the reaction, what are we hearing?
 
PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Eleni, as you can imagine, there's condemnation from the region itself. 
 <br>[10:15:00]
 
HANCOCKS:  It's not the first time that North Korea has fired missiles landing in the exclusive economic zone in Japan. This time came just hours 
 
 after the defense ministry in North Korea denounced what they said was provocations by the U.S. and South Korea by holding large joint military 
 
 drills. 
 
What we did see this Thursday was the end, the culmination of what was billed as the largest live fire drills ever between the U.S. and South 
 
 Korea. Now they had five separate days, where they carried out these drills. 
 
We went along to one of them and they were significant in size; 2,500 U.S. and South Korean soldiers, more than 600 pieces of equipment. 
 
And what really struck me was the blatant nature of these drills. The messaging was far clearer than it has been in the past, saying the scenario 
 
 was North Korea has staged an illegal armed invasion. 
 
What we were seeing in these drills was the U.S. and South Korean response. So clearly, that is something that North Korea did not appreciate. 
 
Today as well significant because the South Korean president Yoon Suk-Yeol went along to the final day of these live fire drills and said, as 
 
 commander-in-chief, he felt confident and satisfied with what he was seeing. 
 
Now Pyongyang, from their point of view, said that these drills, they see them as provocative. They have said this is the reason why we have seen 
 
 such a significant amount of missile launches, of weapons testing over the past 1.5 years. 
 
In fact, just at the end of last month, we saw North Korea try to put a satellite into space. That particular launch actually failed. But North 
 
 Korea has said they will try that again as soon as they possibly can. 
 
They said, this time around, they will not warn the maritime organization that they are going to carry out this satellite launch. They believe they 
 
 have the right to do so. 
 
So we are seeing tensions rising again on the Korean Peninsula. At the end of the significant U.S.-South Korea military drills, again we see Pyongyang 
 
 firing two short-range ballistic missiles from just close to its capital, Pyongyang, into the waters off the east coast. 
 
GIOKOS:  All right, Paula Hancocks there, thank you very much. 
 
Top business leaders are speaking out about AI, some saying the technology could end our very existence and relatively soon. A Yale University survey, 
 
 almost 120 CEOs shared exclusively with CNN found 42 percent said AI could destroy humanity within five to 10 years. 
 
But the other 58 percent said it could never happen and they are not worried at all. In a separate question, 42 percent of the potential of an 
 
 AI catastrophe is overstated; 58 percent say it is not. Clearly, there is a very sharp divide. 
 
The Yale professor behind the survey called the results pretty dark and alarming. Matt Egan will break it all down for us. 
 
Good to have you on, Matt. We heard from the tech industry, we have seen the petitions, the ominous warnings. And CEOs, a large chunk of them, think 
 
 we could be destroyed within give to 10 years. That feels like it is around the corner. 
 
We also have seen the other end of the spectrum, that this is not a possibility. 
 
What should we be reading into these numbers?
 
MATT EGAN, CNN BUSINESS SENIOR WRITER:  Well, Eleni, I don't know about you but the idea of technology wiping out humanity sounds like the stuff of a 
 
 sci-fi horror film. So I was pretty startled to hear that a lot of business leaders are taking this very seriously. 
 
I mean, yes, the good news is 58 percent say no way AI could destroy humanity. That is nice to hear. And none of the CEOs in the survey think 
 
 this is something that could happen in the next five years; also good to hear. 
 
But the fact that 8 percent said potentially, after five years, AI could pose an existential threat and that you have another 34 percent say that, 
 
 after 10 years, that is something that could happen, that is pretty alarming. 
 
As Jeffrey Sonnenfeld told me, these findings do come after a number of leading figures have kind of hit the equivalent of the red panic button. We 
 
 heard from Geoffrey Hinton, the godfather of AI. He is warning that, eventually, AI could become so smart that it will manipulate humans and 
 
 could even override restrictions. 
 
Hinton made a good point in that he said, there are very few things in life where you have the less intelligent thing controlling the thing that is 
 
 more intelligent. 
 
I think that is a good point, here. I don't think that these findings show any sort of unanimity right now. There's a big divide in the business 
 
 community about what AI means, both the risk and the rewards. 
 <br>[10:20:00]
 
EGAN:  But clearly, all of this shows that it is very important that regulators get this right. They have to be able to calibrate regulations, 
 
 put enough rules of the road in place, where technology can continue to evolve, where businesses want to invest in AI. But where there are 
 
 guardrails which can prevent any sort of doomsday scenarios. 
 
And, while we talk about the longer term risks of human extinction from AI, there are these more immediate concerns about what AI means for 
 
 misinformation. 
 
What does it mean for potential job loss?
 
So there is a lot here to grapple with. 
 
GIOKOS:  You just mentioned a lot of things to keep me up at night, compounding the things that already keep me up at night. The godfather of 
 
 AI is worried; I do not know what to say. Let's hope for the best. Matt Egan, great to have you on, thank you. 
 
Still to come, what to expect when the world's top superpowers meet this weekend. We will be telling you about that shortly, stay with CNN.

GIOKOS:  Welcome back. 
 
Last February, Israeli settlers rampaged through the occupied West Bank town of Huwara, leaving one man dead and millions in damages. They called 
 
 it revenge after a Palestinian gunman killed two Israeli brothers in the town earlier that day. 
 
The Israeli Defense Forces investigated what happened in the brutal attack but found serious errors taking place. CNN has discovered that the problems 
 
 went even deeper than the IDF admitted. CNN's Jerusalem correspondent Hadas Gold has more on what they found. 
 
Hadas, great to see you. Give us a sense of what the CNN investigation discovered. 
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Eleni. After the two Israeli brothers were killed in the village of Huwara, in the occupied West 
 
 Bank, hundreds of Israeli settlers went on revenge attacks against Palestinians. 
 
They set fires, they clashed with locals, which led to the death of the one man you mentioned. The violence was so brutal, that one of the Israeli 
 
 military leaders called it a pogrom. 
 
While the IDF chief of staff, Herzi Halevy, has acknowledged their forces were not especially prepared, that, quote, "it should not have happened," a 
 
 CNN investigation, which included testimony from a soldier who was actually there that night shows the Israeli forces not only failed to stop the 
 
 riots, they did not protect Palestinian residents as they were attacked. 
 
Even at some points blocked emergency vehicles from trying to go in and put out fires, things like that, by telling them it was too dangerous to enter 
 
 the town. Israeli forces, the investigation found, also fired tear gas and stun grenades at Palestinians, some of whom were reacting to settlers by 
 
 throwing rocks at them. 
 
The Israeli Defense Forces say that they fired at both sides to separate them --
 <br>[10:25:00]
 
GOLD:  -- although CNN did not see evidence of the IDF firing at those Israeli settlers. Now that soldier who was there that night told his story 
 
 exclusively to CNN, breaking the silence. He said dozens of forces there were aware of the threat the settlers posed but did nothing to intervene. 
 
He said, in general, the army just does not know how to deal with what he called settler terrorism. He said soldiers did nothing, even at the first 
 
 sight of groups of settlers, some of them masked, coming toward the town. 
 
And, Eleni, it's not that nobody knew that these attacks were going to happen. There are settler WhatsApp groups or even some members of the 
 
 Israeli parliament are members of these groups. They have been calling for settlers to march toward Huwara and seek revenge after the deaths of the 
 
 Israeli brothers. 
 
But that Israeli soldier said that the biggest failure of the Israeli forces that night was their inability to protect and let in those fire 
 
 trucks to prevent extensive damage to the property we saw. 
 
Videos and testimony from witnesses show that emergency vehicles were blocked, either by settler attacks or by Israeli soldiers telling them it 
 
 was not safe to enter. Eventually, they did go in after being told they were doing so at their own risk. 
 
Now since that night in February, there have been several more violent and sometimes deadly incidents between Palestinians and Israelis in and around 
 
 Huwara. Since then, Israeli soldiers have remained in the town to reinforce the area. 
 
Now the IDF said, Palestinians saying sometimes that means that soldiers forced their shops to close. The IDF chief of staff, Herzi Halevi, told 
 
 CNN, they learned from the rampage and they now, quote, "rapidly reinforce security forces in the given area, when suspicion arises of the development 
 
 of a similarly severe incident." 
 
But Palestinian residents in Huwara remain unconvinced and with settler leaders, now in positions of power in this Israeli government, they say 
 
 they are very fearful of what is to come. They are not convinced that the Israeli army will be able to protect them. 
 
GIOKOS:  Yes. Hadas Gold, thank you so much for that update. 
 
More about CNN's investigation into the attack on that Palestinian town, including a timeline of how it has unfolded. You can visit our website at

China's foreign ministry makes it official, confirming a visit from America's top diplomat. The announcement was made on Chinese state media, 
 
 that U.S. secretary of state Antony Blinken will be in Beijing this weekend. 
 
A U.S. State Department official not to expect a long list of deliverables from the visit but rather they will focus on harnessing a good line of 
 
 communication. Kristie Lu Stout shares what to expect as the U.S. secretary of state visits Beijing for the first time in five years. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT:  Expectations are low for a high stakes visit to Beijing. On Wednesday, the U.S. and China both 
 
 confirmed that America's top diplomat, Antony Blinken, will visit China this weekend, as the U.S. looks to reset relations. 
 
The trip was originally scheduled for February but was postponed due to a suspected Chinese spy balloon that flew over U.S. airspace. This will be 
 
 the first visit by U.S. secretary of state to China in five years.
 
A senior State Department official says Blinken is expected to discuss the situation in Ukraine and reiterate a call for peace and stability across 
 
 the Taiwan Strait. Assistant secretary of state for East Asian Pacific affairs, Daniel Kritenbrink, was also cautious about the prospect of 
 
 progress. 
 
He said this, quote, "We are not going to Beijing with the intent of having some sort of breakthrough or transformation in the way that we deal with 
 
 one another. We're coming to Beijing with a realistic, confident approach and a sincere desire to manage our competition in the most responsible way 
 
 possible." 
 
Now according to Kritenbrink, Blinken is expected to raise the issue of the three wrongfully detained Americans in China and call for appropriate 
 
 military to military communications. 
 
Now earlier, the U.S. secretary of state had a phone call with China's foreign minister, Qin Gang, and Qin urged the U.S. to respect China's core 
 
 concerns, including Taiwan. 
 
According to a foreign ministry readout of the call, China's foreign minister said this, quote, "The United States should respect China's 
 
 position on the Taiwan question, stop interfering in China's internal affairs and stop undermining China's sovereignty, security and development 
 
 interests in the name of competition." 
 
The U.S.-China relationship is at its lowest point in decades over a host of issues including Taiwan, trade, territorial disputes. And U.S. officials 
 
 hope that Blinken's visit will pave the way for more bilateral meetings, including a possible trip by the U.S. Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen. 
 
This week Yellen told U.S. lawmakers it's in America's best interest to maintain ties with China regarding trade and that, quote, "decoupling" 
 
 would be a big mistake -- Kristie Lu Stout, CNN, Hong Kong.

Now NATO's defense ministers are in Brussels to look at ways to increase their support for Ukraine. The critical meeting comes as Kyiv says its 
 
 counteroffensive against Russia is making gradual progress. 
 
Earlier, NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said the bloc's supporters are already making a difference on the battlefield. 
 
And U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin says, quote, "We will stand with Ukraine for the long haul." 
 
In the meantime, fierce fighting is taking place along the southern and eastern front lines, with Kyiv claiming advances near the embattled city of 
 
 Bakhmut. Let's hear more from CNN's Sam Kiley, who has exclusive access to Ukraine's Special Forces in this area. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KILEY (voice-over): A Special Forces night operation. The objective, to bring a special kind of misery to Russian troops.
 
As they arrived alongside Ukrainian regulars, the Russians attacked.
 
A night-vision recording of a routine assault that the Special Forces needed to shrug off.
 
KILEY:  How long did you spend under fire like this before you could move?
 
BRABUS, UKRAINIAN SPECIAL INTELLIGENCE OPS (from captions): The attack lasted about half an hour.
 
KILEY: And then what did you do?
 
BRABUS (from captions): After that, we took up an observation position -- and we watched them -- we got to work.
 
KILEY (voice-over): Electronic surveillance pinpointed their victims. First, they killed two paratroopers approaching on their left flank to get 
 
 to the group's main targets, Russian commanders near Bakhmut, a sterile record of an all-too-gritty event in March.
 
First, one officer is shot, then another down.
 
He says radio intercepts revealed that the Russians lost two officers and five others to their sniper team that night.
 
BRABUS (from captions): The result of our operation was the demoralization of the Russian airborne unit because they lost their top leader.
 
KILEY (voice-over): Formed when Russia invaded Ukraine last year, this team of experienced veterans works in a secret realm under the intelligence 
 
 services.
 <br>[10:35:00]
 
KILEY (voice-over):  They're tasked with tactical work seeking strategic effect as Ukraine's counter-offensive takes shape.
 
Here, using a modified heavy machine gun in a hidden bunker last month close to Bakhmut.
 
Drone operators more than a mile away are directing Brabus onto Russian troops.
 
KILEY: How many Russians have you killed in this war?
 
BRABUS: A lot of. A lot of. A lot of. For example, here's a lot of Russians.
 
KILEY: This is when you're on the ... 
 
This gun. 
 
How many more or less there?
 
BRABUS: I don't know. We didn't calculate, understand.
 
KILEY (voice-over): It's the Russians they want to do the counting, because Ukraine's best hope is that Russian troops run rather than fight -- Sam 
 
 Kiley, CNN, in Eastern Ukraine.
