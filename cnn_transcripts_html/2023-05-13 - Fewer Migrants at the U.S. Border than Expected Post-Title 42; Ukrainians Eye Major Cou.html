LAILA HARRAK, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us from the United States and all around the world. I'm Laila Harrak. 
 
The U.S. border with Mexico remains calm, at least for now, a day after the Title 42 immigration rule came to an end. 
 
Russia tries to take out a U.S.-made Patriot air defense system in Ukraine but the Patriot system appears to have worked as it was intended. 
 
And the Eurovision song contest final is just hours away. We'll ask a Eurovision historian what to expect as 26 acts prepare to represent their home nations.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over):  Live from CNN Center, this is CNN NEWSROOM with Laila Harrak.
 
HARRAK:  Good to be with you. 
 
U.S. cities along the border with Mexico report fewer migrant crossings than expected on the first day since Title 42 expired. The COVID-era policy allowed authorities to swiftly expel most migrants. Federal officials say there was no substantial increase overnight or an influx at midnight Friday morning when Title 42 expired. 
 
Still, leaders of border cities are calling on the federal government and lawmakers to address the problems with the immigration system.

MAYOR OSCAR LEESER, EL PASO, TEXAS:  I know and everyone knows that these people aren't coming to El Paso, Texas. They're coming to the United States. And Secretary Mayorkas and the federal government really have helped us to be able to provide a service. But we all know that the immigration process is broken and we
 
 understand that. And we're hoping that, you know, Congress learns that they need to agree to disagree and compromise, because there is no endgame in communities like El Paso and the southern border. We can't continue for infinity. Something has to happen. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK:  The end of Title 42 marks a major shift in U.S. immigration policies after three years of pandemic rules. CNN's Ed Lavandera is in El Paso, with a look at how officials and those seeking asylum in the U.S. are adjusting to the change. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  After Title 42 ended late Thursday night, some migrants discovered they didn't make it in time.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (Speaking foreign language).
 
LAVANDERA (voice-over):  This father and son from Venezuela were turned away but he says, the goal is to get to the other side to find a way to reach the United States. But we'll have to wait and figure it out.
 
ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS, HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY:  We've been very, very clear that there are lawful, safe and orderly pathways to seek relief in the United States. And if one arrives at our southern border, one is going to face tougher consequences.
 
LAVANDERA (voice-over):  In the days leading up to last night's deadline, border officials saw a surge of migrants. More than 23,000 are now in CBP custody, down slightly from earlier this week.
 
But the end of Title 42 did not trigger the historic wave of migrants rushing to cross the border Friday that was predicted. In El Paso, thousands were waiting to be processed outside the border gate.
 
RAUL ORTIZ, U.S. BORDER PATROL CHIEF:  We are prioritizing those most vulnerable populations. We're doing this as quickly as efficiently and as safely as we possibly can.
 
LAVANDERA (voice-over):  That number now down to a couple hundred, says the city's mayor.
 
MAYOR OSCAR LEESER (D-TX), EL PASO:  After yesterday's spike at about 1,800 that came in yesterday, we've not seen any additional big numbers come in through the El Paso sector.
 
JOHN MARTIN, EL PASO MIGRANT SHELTER DIRECTOR:  We have lean-tos or tents, whatever term you want to use, literally, all along the wall.
 
LAVANDERA (voice-over):  John Martin runs a network of shelters in El Paso and said the crowds have dramatically dwindled in recent days.
 
MARTIN:  As of about 11 o'clock this morning, we had no new arrivals.
 
LAVANDERA (voice-over):  While he was surprised at the lack of influx the morning after Title 42 lifted, he doesn't expect it will stay this way.
 
MARTIN:  I have to admit, it is nice to be able to breathe one more time. But we can't let our guard down, because we still know it's coming.
 
LAVANDERA:  In January, U.S. Customs and Border Protection opened this massive tent processing facility in the El Paso area, about 20 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border. It is designed to be able to hold about 1,000 migrants at a time.
 
And as you can see, construction crews are working to expand. And we're told by CBP officials, in June, they'll have room for another 1,000 migrants to hold at this facility.
 
LAVANDERA (voice-over):  In Brownsville, dozens of buses line up near an intake facility. 
 <br>[03:05:00]
 
LAVANDERA:  But a major humanitarian group in the area tells CNN they only had one bus of migrants arrive today.
 
About 155,000 migrants were estimated to be in shelters and on streets in Mexico, waiting to enter the U.S., a source familiar with federal estimates said.
 
Migrants will still risk their lives to make it to the U.S. and, from now on, people who cross the border illegally will face a tougher path to requesting asylum. Many will be deported, like this group, who were shackled and led onto a repatriation flight, like this one, leaving for Guatemala on Thursday.
 
LAVANDERA:  In the days leading up to the end of Title 42, this alleyway behind a migrant shelter in El Paso was packed with migrants, sleeping outside. All of that has changed. 
 
And what several migrant advocates tell us is that, for now, they think that migrants on the Mexican side of the border are reassessing the border landscape, trying to figure out when the next best opportunity might be to cross into the U.S. -- Ed Lavandera, CNN, El Paso, Texas.

HARRAK:  Joining me now from El Paso, Texas, is Alicia Caldwell, a reporter covering immigration for "The Wall Street Journal." She joins us from El Paso, as I just said. 
 
With Title 42 now a thing of the past, you are at the Texas side of the border. What have you been seeing these past days?
 
ALICIA CALDWELL, "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL":  I am. The last couple days have been like the last couple of weeks. You have people surrendering on the south side of the border. Basically they're coming across the Rio Grande but surrendering on the south side of the fence. 
 
So in many cases, they've had to wait several days, if not longer, for processing. And for some of those folks, midnight struck Eastern time last night and they were still on the border. Folks still there this morning, in many cases. 
 
So there's been an ongoing processing of individuals over the last, well, many months and weeks in terms of the end of Title 42, the last 24 hours. It's sort of status quo right now in terms of what the Border Patrol does on the front end. 
 
The difference is how they get processed and how they get treated at the end of the process. There is no longer Title 42. So no one is being quickly expelled under a health law. But everyone now faces the potential for rapid deportation under traditional immigration laws. 
 
HARRAK:  Do you feel -- the people you've spoken to, are they deterred by this new measure?
 
CALDWELL:  It's a little bit in between. Over the last several days, we've talked to a lot of people who made it in between the ports of entry without being inspected. 
 
And they felt like they had heard enough information that they would be allowed to stay in the United States without any paperwork or they would get some sort of paperwork or permission to stay. 
 
That wasn't accurate. So Border Patrol went through downtown El Paso over the last couple of days and handed out fliers that said, if you haven't been inspected by Border Patrol or other immigration authorities, if you haven't been released by the U.S. government, come down to the nearest Border Patrol station. 
 
And there's one down the street from the primary shelter here, the Sacred Heart Church. Almost 1,000 people, I believe it was 917 people, opted, in the last several days, to walk down to that Border Patrol station and surrender. 
 
The chief of the Border Patrol here in El Paso, the local sector chief, Anthony Scott Goode, told reporters that most were processed and released under Title 8 but without those penalties. They were allowed to proceed into the United States to pursue whatever claim, asylum claim or otherwise. 
 
HARRAK:  What are the stakes for people on both sides of the border?
 
How would you describe this moment for a border town like El Paso, where you are right now?
 
CALDWELL:  So for El Paso and San Diego, Brownsville, Yuma, all across the southwest border, there was a big expectation that, come midnight on Thursday, there would be this kind of ooh-aah moment. Or a shock and awe moment of a rush to the border. 
 
It was really a worry that had been discussed by the administration and others for weeks leading up to this. 
 
You didn't see that. There was no shock and awe or ooh-aah moment of, oh, my gosh, all of these people are here. We've seen instead over the last several weeks, last week in particular, this significant rush to the border. 
 
And in many cases, thousands of people walked up to the line, the Border Patrol fence. So they've been waiting, sometimes by the thousands, in the daylight heat and the evening cold for Border Patrol to come by and take them into custody and start processing them. 
 
HARRAK:  And from what you've witnessed and what you've seen in the past couple days --
 <br>[03:10:00]
 
HARRAK:  -- what does this all mean for U.S. immigration policy moving forward?
 
CALDWELL:  It changes a lot of things. It is, according to advocates, at least it's a total return to the Trump administration policy of hardline limiting immigration. 
 
The Biden administration will say that's absolutely not accurate, that it is a sort of new version of that, a kinder, gentler version, that allows people to make an appointment over an app, come to the border in an orderly fashion. 
 
What the Biden administration said they want to do is process people in an orderly, humane fashion. But the reality is that there are so many people on the border at the moment in the last several days and weeks that border communities are facing a potential sort of inundation of migrants. 
 
So far, the number of people crossing the border illegally has declined. It was about 12,000 over the last several days per day and it's now declined to under 10,000. So the big explosion or surge of people at the border that was anticipated has not happened. 
 
And officials from every level of government are hopeful that it does not, that the messaging worked. 
 
HARRAK:  Alicia Caldwell, reporting, thank you so very much. Greatly appreciate it. 
 
CALDWELL:  Thank you.

(MUSIC PLAYING) HARRAK:  U.S.-made Patriot missiles have scored a win in their first head to head battle with Russian hypersonic missiles in Ukraine. Two U.S. officials say Moscow launched one of those missiles at a Patriot battery near Kyiv last week. 
 
Hypersonic means they can fly 10 times the speed of sound, which makes them hard to intercept. Despite that, officials say Ukraine managed to take down the Russian missile using the Patriot system itself. 
 
As Ukraine makes gains near Bakhmut, it's also keeping an eye on an upcoming counteroffensive aimed at routing Russians across a bigger front. Our Nic Robertson went to the trenches to see how Ukrainians are preparing for it. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over):  Amid shell-smashed trees, Ukrainian troops figure out how to get as close to the new hard won gains around Bakhmut.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Go behind me, distance five meters. He's going last.
 
ROBERTSON:  How far from the Russian lines here?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Close to 800 to 900.
 
ROBERTSON:  Meters?
 
What lessons here about a much anticipated bigger Ukraine counteroffensive.
 
You can see here how the ground is drying out, how wet it was before, how hard it would be for the armored vehicles to get through. The battlefield is changing. Now summers coming. And that's everything for the counteroffensive.
 
So we have to go a bit faster here, because they take a lot of incoming fire here.
 
If not for the war, it would be a lovely walk. A little cover here from shelling.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Go, go, go.
 
ROBERTSON:  We have a drone?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  A drone.
 
ROBERTSON:  Just coming here, we've heard a drone above, we've got some cover in here, hopefully, they won't see us down here. Getting closer and closer to the Russian lines.
 
This trench, one of several and a new minefield position to block Russian troops about 600 meters away from a counterattack out of sight. North and south of here, more Ukrainian troops advancing, building on the recent gains here.
 
Ukraine's Western allies say that shaping operations for the big counteroffensive are already underway. Commanders here won't say if this is part of that counteroffensive. But the gains they've had around Bakhmut are a huge morale boost for Ukrainian troops.
 
How does it feel to be in the battle now and to actually after all this time take more territory?
 
HONZA, COMBAT MEDIC:  I love it actually. I love it because I'm with my family, with guys that are my family.
 
ROBERTSON:  But success, not all that's binding appetite for victory. Mounting Russian atrocities fueling anger.
 
HONZA:  We all just want to take our territory back and kill maximum possible Russians we can.
 
ROBERTSON:  Do you think the Russians understand that?
 
HONZA:  No, I don't think so. They're going to get killed, all of them.
 
ROBERTSON:  It's going to be a tough fight for you then.
 
HONZA:  Yes, also. But we're ready for this. It's our land.
 
ROBERTSON:  As we leave, there are more explosions.
 
Then this --
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Run.
 
ROBERTSON:  We don't ask, we just run. And keep running.
 <br>[03:15:00]
 
ROBERTSON:  We're hearing a drone, so we're running.
 
They've got their armor troop transporter ready.
 
Yes, getting back in now, drones overhead, more artillery coming.
 
ROBERTSON (voice-over):  It's ancient Soviet equipment. More modern NATO armor busy elsewhere on the battlefield. 
 
ROBERTSON:  There's going to be months and months and months, if not years, of warfare like this, (INAUDIBLE) taken back all those lost miles (ph). 
 
ROBERTSON (voice-over):  -- Nic Robertson, CNN, Eastern Ukraine.

HARRAK:  Meantime, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy is expected to hold talks with the Italian president and prime minister in Rome today. According to Italian media, Mr. Zelenskyy could also meet with Pope Francis during his visit. 
 
That meeting would happen almost two weeks after the Vatican said it was involved in a peace mission to try and end the war in Ukraine. 
 
Israel ramps up its attacks on Palestinian militants and tries to foil retaliatory strikes from Islamic Jihad. Ahead, how the fighting is taking a heavy toll on ordinary civilians.

HARRAK:  More now on the war on Ukraine and the Ukrainian counteroffensive that could lie ahead. Salma Abdelaziz joins us live from London. 
 
What more do we know about Ukraine's counteroffensive?
 
Is it imminent?
 
SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Look, it's absolutely imminent. Some would say it's even overdue. This is the important thing to remember here. You're not going to get a date, time and location for this counteroffensive. An element of surprise is required. 
 
And there are very tough reporting restrictions on the ground. So even for our crews who are there on those front lines, witnessing what's taking place, there are limitations as to what they can report, because, of course, this is considered military information. 
 
But what we do know is that Ukraine is absolutely strengthening its positions, fortifying its positions ahead of this counteroffensive. 
 
Consider it a prelude, if you will, even pulling attention away from some locations in the south toward Bakhmut, of course, one of the longest-running battles in this conflict, a place that everyone agrees holds very little strategic value but now holds so much symbolic weight because of the amount of blood lost there. 
 
And we are seeing Ukraine, after months of Russian gains in Bakhmut, Ukraine making advances, claiming that it's been able to move forward by two kilometers. There's, of course, intense fighting ongoing, particularly to the north of the city. 
 
Now we have this extraordinary admission, after denial, denial, denial from Ukraine, this extraordinary admission from Ukraine that, yes, they have retreated. They have pulled back. They're playing that video right now that shows one of those retreats, shows some of that pullback. 
 
It is sped up, of course, but CNN has geolocated it to the area in and around Bakhmut. It shows troops pulling back. The Kremlin has characterized this as strategic, saying these troops are pulling back to fortify defensive positions. 
 
But the head of the Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, called the Russian defense ministry out for lying. He says this is simply a loss of land, a flight of troops. He has time and time again had this very public spat with the Russian defense ministry, something that appears to show divisions, cracks within here. 
 
And all of this, of course, for President Zelenskyy, bodes very well. Take a listen to what he said in the nightly address. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  What is important to understand now, in their minds, the occupiers are all ready for defeat. They have already lost this war in their minds. We must put daily pressure on them so that their sense of defeat turns into their retreat, their mistakes and their losses. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ABDELAZIZ:  So you have these gains now in Bakhmut, serving as a morale boost for troops on the ground. You have all of this weapons support pouring in from Ukraine's allies, from NATO, coming to those front lines. 
 
You have, of course, the weather conditions improving. There had been this expectation for the weather to warm and that would allow the conditions on the ground to improve. But we're still hearing signals from President Zelenskyy that they're not ready yet. But again, the element of surprise is going to be key here -- Laila. 
 
HARRAK:  Salma Abdelaziz, thank you so much. 
 
We turn our attention now to the Middle East, where Israel's military launched new strikes in Gaza overnight, hitting what it says were two command centers belonging to Palestinian militants. On Friday, Defense Forces in southern Israel intercepted several rockets fired from Gaza. 
 
They also launched another attack, which killed a commander of the Islamic Jihad militant group. At least 33 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the fighting began on Tuesday. Among the victims are women and children. 
 
CNN's Ben Wedeman has more now from southern Israel. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Revenge of the free:  that's what the Palestinian militant group, Islamic Jihad, is calling this, a barrage of rockets fired from Gaza and, for the first time in this most recent flareup, toward Jerusalem.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, shrapnel coming down.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We just see pieces falling right over there.
 
WEDEMAN (voice-over):  Our team in Sderot, southern Israel, witnessed Israeli air defenses intercepting --
 <br>[03:25:00]
 
WEDEMAN (voice-over):  -- around 20 incoming rockets on Friday before taking shelter from the debris. Israeli strikes, meanwhile, hitting across Gaza. Cellphone footage obtained by CNN shows a house exploding in the city of Khan Yunis.
 
Another video shows fire raging in Gaza City on day four of what is the worst escalation of violence between the Israeli army and Palestinian militants in months.
 
It also claimed militants had launched nearly 1,000 rockets since the latest violence began. In an Israeli settlement in the occupied West Bank on Friday, people ran for cover as sirens rang out, a day after one person was killed in the Israeli city of Rehovot, when a rocket fired from Gaza hit this building. 
 
Forensic experts today examining the scene.
 
Meanwhile, at least 33 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza in less than a week. And there are more than 2 million civilians caught inside Gaza, whose lives are now on hold in the mortal danger, desperate for a ceasefire. 
 
But a diplomatic source tells CNN the ceasefire talks are now, in his words, "on ice" --  Ben Wedeman, CNN, Sderot, Israel.

HARRAK:  A New York man who allegedly held a homeless street performer in a fatal chokehold is now out on bail after surrendering to police on Friday. Daniel Penny faces a second-degree manslaughter charge in the death of Jordan Neely earlier this month, which sparked protests in New York City. 
 
CNN national correspondent Athena Jones has the details. Scenes in her story are disturbing. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ATHENA JONES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Daniel Penny surrendering to face criminal charges in the death of homeless street performer Jordan Neely.
 
THOMAS KENNIFF, DANIEL PENNY'S ATTORNEY:  He did so voluntarily and with the dignity and integrity that is characteristic of his history of service to this grateful nation.
 
JONES (voice-over):  The 24-year-old former Marine, seen in a widely circulated video holding Neely in a chokehold for several minutes on a New York subway on May 1, now stands accused of second-degree manslaughter for recklessly causing his death. 
 
The Manhattan district attorney's office bringing the charge after numerous witness interviews, a review of photo and video footage and discussions with the medical examiner.
 
The prosecutor telling the court witnesses observed Neely making threats and scaring passengers, adding Penny approached Neely from behind and placed him in the chokehold, taking him down to the ground. 
 
When the train arrived at the next stop, Penny continued to hold Neely in the chokehold for several minutes, two other men helping to restrain his arms. At some point, Mr. Neely stopped moving. The defendant continued to hold Mr. Neely for a period and then released him.
 
Penny's lawyers argue he risked his own life and safety to protect himself and fellow New Yorkers, resulting in the unintended and unforeseen death of Mr. Neely, adding they are confident Penny will be absolved of any wrongdoing once all the facts are known.
 
Lawyers for the Neely family hailing Penny's arrest.
 
LENNON EDWARDS, NEELY FAMILY ATTORNEY:  We're closer now to justice than were a week ago because Daniel Penny has been arrested. 
 
JONES (voice-over):  Even as they argued he should be charged with murder.
 
EDWARDS:  There was no attack. Mr. Neely did not attack anyone. He did not touch anyone. He did not hit anyone but he was choked to death. And that can't stand, that can't be what we represent.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Justice for?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Jordan Neely.
 
JONES (voice-over):  Neely's killing sparked days of demonstrations in New York City, with protesters demanding Penny's arrest. Meanwhile, a legal defense fund set up by Penny's supporters had raised more than $400,000 by Friday afternoon.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Daniel, did you do it?
 
JONES (voice-over):  Now prosecutors must prove their case. JONES:  Before being released, Daniel Penny was ordered to turn over any passports he has and he'll have to ask permission from New York state if he wants to leave the state. His next court date is set for July 17th. And Penny faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted -- Athena Jones, CNN, New York.

HARRAK:  A jury in Idaho has found Lori Vallow Daybell guilty on all counts of killing her two children and conspiring in the murder of her husband's first wife. A jury of seven men and five women reached a unanimous guilty verdict Friday afternoon. 
 
The charges relate to the 2019 deaths of her children, 17-year-old Tylee Ryan and 7-year-old Joshua Vallow, as well as Tammy Daybell. Husband Chad Daybell has pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. 
 
Their case was featured in a Netflix true crime documentary last year. Lori Vallow Daybell is now facing life in prison.

HARRAK:  For the first time in U.S. history, the federal government could default on trillions of dollars in debt if Congress doesn't act soon. So far, the White House and congressional Republicans remain far apart on key issues. And a Friday meeting between President Biden and Republican leaders was postponed. 
 
Staffers are expected to keep working through the weekend to try to hammer out an agreement. Unless the debt ceiling is raised, the U.S. could begin defaulting on its obligations as early as next month, with dire consequences for both the U.S. and global economies.

HARRAK:  Turkiye is facing a watershed moment this weekend in one of the most pivotal national elections in a generation. Voters will decide among the three remaining presidential candidates, including incumbent Recep Tayyip Erdogan. If no one gets at least 50 percent of the vote, a run-off will be held May 28th. 
 
Also, at stake, 600 seats in parliament. The outcome there could profoundly affect Turkiye's role in NATO, its relationship with the E.U., its migration policy, its role in the Ukraine conflict and its tensions with Greece and Cyprus in the Eastern Mediterranean over sovereignty and natural resources.

HARRAK:  We're just hours away from the final of Eurovision, the wildly popular, often eccentric and campy song contest that once propelled ABBA to stardom. Well, 26 acts will take the stage in Liverpool, England, the substitute host for Ukraine, who won last year's competition. 
 
President Zelenskyy won't be addressing the competition but broadcasters saying the event needs to stay non-political. 
 
Among those performing will be Ukraine's hotly tipped duo, TVORCHI, who hope their song, "Heart of Steel," will bring Ukraine the trophy again, while keeping the war front and center. Bookmakers peg Loreen from Sweden as the favorite. Others to watch are Finland with "Cha Cha Cha" as is "Mama SC," from Let 3 of Croatia. 
 
The winning nation gets to host next year's Eurovision. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
HARRAK:  I'd like to welcome now from Liverpool, where it's all happening, Dean Vuletic, he's a historian of contemporary Europe, a Eurovision academic and author of "Postwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest." 
 
So good to see you, Dean. Europe's biggest show about to get underway. 
 
What's it like in Liverpool?
 
DEAN VULETIC, HISTORIAN AND AUTHOR:  It's a fantastic atmosphere in Liverpool. The sun is shining. The Liverpudlians are smiling, such a friendly people here. And the city is decked out, ready for Eurovision in the colors of Ukraine as well. 
 
HARRAK:  In the colors of Ukraine. 
 
For those not familiar, Dean, with Eurovision, tell us about the significance of the song contest.
 
And why does it still attract millions of viewers each year?
 
VULETIC:  This is one of the world's longest-running television shows. It's been held annually since 1956. It brings together the countries of Europe plus Australia and Israel now. And they vie for the best song. 
 
And each country also gets to vote. So that also makes it Europe's biggest election. 
 
HARRAK:  Now what makes this year's Eurovision stand out, in your view?
 
VULETIC:  This year's Eurovision is unique in the history of the contest because it's the first time that one country is staging the contest on behalf of another that is at war. So the BBC is hosting Eurovision this year on behalf of Ukraine. And it sends a strong message of solidarity, Europe, the U.K. and Ukraine all together at this event. 
 
HARRAK:  And how are they marking Ukraine?
 
VULETIC:  Well, not only is the city decked out in the colors of Ukraine, as I mentioned, with Ukrainian art installations also being present, but Ukrainian artists will feature prominently in tonight's grand final. Former winners will perform their songs. 
 
Jamala, for example, who won the contest in 2016 for Ukraine. There will also be Ukrainian singers performing songs from their musical heritage, alongside other Eurovision stars. 
 
There will be a lot of combining of Britain's cultural heritage and the cultural heritage of Ukraine to send this message of support for Ukraine and solidarity with Ukraine. 
 
HARRAK:  Dean, what makes an act uniquely Eurovision?
 
VULETIC:  That's hard to say these days. These days, the trend is toward authenticity, so songs in national languages, songs with national musical influences; 20 years ago, it wasn't like that. It was more of a Euro pop song sung in English, something that was catchy, rather innocuous. 
 <br>[03:45:00]
 
VULETIC:  These days, though, it's important to have a political or social message, something that audiences can relate to. 
 
Eurovision does reflect and has historically reflected changes in culture, society and politics in Europe and audiences want to see that more. Otherwise, Eurovision wouldn't be so special in the world of televised song contests. 
 
HARRAK:  And Australia is taking part. 
 
Why is it in the competition?
 
VULETIC:  Well, Australia is in Eurovision because Australians have been able to watch Eurovision since the 1980s. It has been broadcast on a very special Australian television station, the Special Broadcasting Service, set up to provide multilingual programming to Australia's migrant communities. 
 
So it's a reflection of Australia's multicultural society, especially the European migrants, which were so prominent in Australia when SBS was set up. 
 
HARRAK:  Who are you most excited about this year?
 
VULETIC:  Definitely Finland. I think Finland, is a crazy song. It's an uplifting song. It's a party song. It's something that we need right now in the world to give us some entertainment, some enjoyment, some escapism. 
 
There are a lot of songs that are quite heavy this year in terms of talking about toxic relationships, anxiety issues and, of course, the war in Ukraine. The Finnish entry is definitely very different to all of that. So I think it will be the most eye-catching performance tonight. 
 
And also watch out for Croatia's Let 3. It's an anti-war song but also a rock opera, which is a genre that we haven't heard in Eurovision so far, even though Eurovision has embraced so many musical genres. 
 
HARRAK:  And, Dean, Eurovision is... 
 
Can you complete that sentence for me?
 
VULETIC:  Eurovision is fun. Eurovision is peace. Eurovision is togetherness. And that's what's special about Eurovision. 
 
For 67 years now, it has brought Europeans together and, increasingly, fans from across the world. And this year those fans will get to vote in Eurovision for the first time. There is a rest of the world vote that will carry the same weight as that of the participating country. 
 
HARRAK:  I'm a little jealous, Dean. I wish I was there with you. But I wish you a fabulous, fabulous day. Thank you so much, Dean Vuletic, in Liverpool there, talking to us about Eurovision. 
 
VULETIC:  Thank you, Laila. 
 
HARRAK:  Have a good one.

HARRAK:  Basketball star Brittney Griner made her return to the heart (ph) court on Friday night, playing in her first competitive game since being released from Russian captivity last December. 
 
Griner scored 10 points in the Phoenix Mercury's 92-71 preseason loss to the Los Angeles Sparks. Well, the American spent nearly 300 days in a Russian prison on drug charges before being freed in a prisoner swap. 
 
She got a standing ovation from the crowd in Phoenix and says hearing the national anthem before the game, quote, "definitely hit differently."
