SARA SIDNER, CNN ANCHOR:  A senior campaign official tells CNN her remarks will focus in part on manufacturing. 
 
Her speech comes after Donald Trump pitched his vision for a manufacturing renaissance in the U.S. to voters in Georgia. And new CNN polling shows the former president has an edge over Harris with likely voters when it comes to the economy.
 
CNN White House correspondent Priscilla Alvarez is joining us now. What are we expecting to hear here? Obviously, the campaign has been paying attention to the polls where Donald Trump has an edge over her in most of the polls, if not all, when it comes to the economy. What will she say today that might change that?
 
PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, that's right, Sara, and her advisers are keenly aware that the economy is a top issue for voters.
 
So today she is expected to expand on her economic agenda in what may amount to be her most substantial comments on her economic philosophy. 
 
According to a senior campaign official that looks like her describing her philosophy as pragmatic and also as a capitalist who "understand the limitations of government and always sought to take good ideas from wherever they come and harness the power of innovation." That according to a senior campaign official. And we can expect that is going to be folded into the vice president's remarks later this afternoon.
 
But as you mentioned with the polling, the head-to-head polling from CNN shows that the vice president holds a very slight lead over former President Donald Trump, so much so that it's just no clear leader in this race. And when you look at the issues on the economy the former president still have a lead -- 50 percent to the vice president's 39 percent. 
 
Now, advisers believe that they can start to close the gap on this issue. And in watching the vice president and attending her rallies her framing around the issue has also evolved. She talks about the opportunity economy and lowering costs for Americans while also recognizing that they're not where they are -- where Americans want them to be just yet.
 
And that is one of the three pillars that we'll also hear about today -- lowering costs, investing in American innovation, and also what the campaign described as leading the world in the -- world in the industries of the future. So this will all be wrapped up into her remarks. 
 
Again, this may be one of the most substantial comments that she'll provide on her economic philosophy, which voters care a lot about -- Sara.
 
SIDNER:  All right, Priscilla Alvarez. Thank you so much. Appreciate it -- Kate.
 
KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR:  And Donald Trump on the campaign trail, of course, as well today. He's heading back to battleground North Carolina today. He's been making a concerted effort this week especially to try and court women voters, and he's been taking some heat for his approach from some corners. What will his message look like today? We will find out. 
 
For the first time today he is back in the state since the CNN reporting came out about the North Carolina Republican candidate for governor that has many Republicans calling on that candidate to drop out of the race. Donald Trump has not said anything about Mark Robinson yet. 
 
CNN's Alayna Treene is there in North Carolina and she's joining us now. Wasn't he just there this weekend?
 
ALAYNA TREENE, CNN REPORTER:  He was. So this is Donald Trump today coming to North Carolina. It's just three days after he was just there on Saturday as well and, of course, less than a week after that CNN reporting on Mark Robinson had dropped.
 
And it's interesting because on Saturday we obviously did not see Mark Robinson with Donald Trump. I am told he's not going to be here today. Donald Trump is not expected to make any mention of him. 
 
But that in and of itself, Kate, is notable because as you mentioned, a lot of people are condemning some of the comments that he had made that we had released on that CNN KFILE investigation. But also there have been no calls from Donald Trump or even his running mate J.D. Vance or anyone on his campaign to maybe withdraw their support or pressure him to get out of the race. So I'm told today you should expect no mention of that. We will not see Robinson. 
 
Instead, this speech is really going to continue his rhetoric on the economy. Behind me you can see is a manufacturing warehouse. That is where Donald Trump will be speaking in just a couple of hours from now.
 
And we know that the economy is really the number one issue for Donald Trump ahead of November, particularly in a state here like North Carolina. It is a battleground state. And it -- but also polls have shown in recent days that even across the country, but here in North Carolina as well, a lot of voters view Donald Trump as being the better candidate on the economy. 
 
So you're going to hear a lot of him talking about inflation. Talking about wanting to bring jobs back to America. A lot of the same kind of themes that we heard him lay out in that speech in Georgia yesterday.
 
But one thing that's notable, and you touched on this earlier, Kate, is something that I've been paying attention to in Donald Trump's most recent remarks, and that is him trying to court women. It comes as I know that Donald Trump has always struggled with female voters. And when I talk to his senior advisers, they admit that this is even more of a concern now with Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket and being his challenger.
 <br>[07:35:00]
 
We heard him address this earlier this week in Pennsylvania. I want you to take a listen to what he said.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I always thought women liked me. I never thought I had a problem. But the fake news keeps saying women don't like me. I don't believe it. You will be protected, and I will be your protector. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TREENE:  So, Kate, as you could hear there, he is trying to argue that he would be the protector of women. He's also said that he thinks that -- you know, he recognizes that abortion is one of the top issues, particularly for female voters. He said that everyone will forget about that after the election.
 
But look, this is a growing concern. The reason Donald Trump is talking about this so much is because I am told this is weighing very heavily on his mind especially as he looks at recent polling that shows the gender gap is widening significantly, and that Harris is doing better with female voters than the former president himself -- Kate.
 
BOLDUAN:  Alayna Treene in North Carolina for us. Thank you so much, Alayna -- John.
 
JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR:  All right. With me now, CNN political commentator Karen Finney, and CNN senior political commentator and former special assistant to President George W. Bush, Scott Jennings. I know you were both on very late last night with Abby, so thanks for coming in.
 
I do want to warn you these segments are shorter, so if you're going to throw down you've got to get right to it. 
 
KAREN FINNEY, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  All right, Scott. Let's just do this.
 
BERMAN:  You can't wait. It can't build up. No buildup like on news night.
 
I want to talk about Vice President Harris giving this economic speech today. We've seen the polls. She trails Donald Trump in the latest CNN poll by 11 points on who can best handle the economy. It's tighter than it was, and other polls show it even tighter than that. But you get the sense that she wants to close the gap even more.
 
What does she need --
 
FINNEY:  Of course.
 
BERMAN:  -- to say to do that, Karen?
 
FINNEY:  Well, clearly, she needs to talk a little bit more about her economic agenda. Voters are saying we want to hear more about it. 
 
And -- but I will say overall the challenge that she has is almost is there enough time because if you look at the movement in the polls she moved voters 13 points in like the first 30 days. But she had to make up ground from where Biden was. And now -- and she's got momentum, but it's can they keep that over the next six weeks to get where they need to be with voters by voting day. And, by the way, people are already starting to vote. 
 
So continuing that momentum. Continuing to respond to what voters are saying they want to hear. I think she's got a great conversation to have with the American voters about the economy so --
 
BERMAN:  I see you nodding in agreement. This definitely isn't nighttime.
 
SCOTT JENNINGS, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, FORMER SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH:  I mean, look, she's got a major problem. It's Joe Biden and the fact that she's his vice president. 
 
In our CNN survey yesterday 51 percent of registered voters said that Trump had a successful presidency. Only 37 percent said the same about Biden and Harris. A lot of that has to do with the economy and it mostly has to do with inflation. 
 
And so she's yet to look into a television camera and say here are two or three things that Joe Biden did that I disagreed with, and I would do it differently, and I've learned from that. She's effectively running on a continuation of the same. People don't like the same and they remember Trump better. I don't know how you expect to win under those circumstances.
 
FINNEY:  So obviously, I'm going to disagree. One of the things I hope she talks about is with that inflation down back under three percent. That's a big deal. We saw the Fed rate cut. That's a big deal for mortgages, for credit card debt. For a whole host of things. 
 
So you can say that is movement in the right direction. But I've heard her also say that is not enough -- I want to do more, and here's what I'm going to do. The other thing though she has to do is the contrast. You know,
 
 economists are saying that this -- you know, you get a car, and you get a tax cut, and you get a tax cut from -- that Donald Trump's policy -- no details about how he's going to do it. No conversation about how much that's actually going to cost. And once again, raise the debt. And it will bring inflation back up. And it will pass on costs to middle-income people. And she's actually trying to cut taxes for middle-income people. 
 
BERMAN:  Can I ask about one thing that Alayna just brought up there with Donald Trump's language when he is speaking to or maybe, depending on how you put, at women where he says I am your protector, Scott. And Alayna said it's because the gender gap is weighing on him. Weighing and working are two different things. Do you think that kind of language works?
 
JENNINGS:  Look, I think the best language he could use would be to talk about the economy, to talk about immigration, and to talk about public safety. I mean, at the end of the day, there are going to be some issues that women disagree with him on, but there are going to be others in which they have real concerns about the current administration and what they are getting. 
 
There are a lot of women voters who remember quite fondly the Trump economy. My advice to him would be remind them food prices were lower. Cost of living was lower. You didn't have the same amount of economic anxiety. And you're often the person in the household that's in the most direct contact -- daily contact with the economy. Remember who did better and remember what you're getting now. 
 
BERMAN:  That's a different message than I am your protector. 
 
FINNEY:  Yeah, very much so. And I think that, you know, today the question is always with Donald Trump can he stay on message? Because I think we're probably going to keep hearing I am your protector. It's a very ham-handed way to talk to women. 
 <br>[07:40:00]
 
One of the things in our poll that I thought was interesting is young voters -- the gap there with Kamala Harris -- younger women, in particular. Women over 52, by the way, also care about reproductive freedom because we care about our bodily autonomy and our freedom. 
 
Young voters much more -- Kamala Harris has a gap there. Reproductive freedom is a big issue. And it's an economic issue for a lot of women in addition to an issue around freedom.
 
But also, Trump never talks about how he's going to do all these things in the reality of the post-COVID economy. We don't work the same way we used to. We don't live the same way. 
 
Child care -- big issue. What does he say? It's an issue. OK, what are you going to do about it? Women are looking to hear that as well. 
 
BERMAN:  You know, Karen brought up the on or off message thing. Politico has got the latest in -- you can find this article almost every week from some outlet that Trump is off message and Republicans are worried. 
 
Apparently, they report there was a meeting with Steven Wynn, casino mogul, who told them flat-out you're off message and it isn't helping when denied some of the details of this. You can see the at the bottom there: "You're off message, and it isn't helping."
 
Scott, what do you think?
 
JENNINGS:  I mean, look, there's always people in campaigns who have advice for candidates. I would just say the spate of polls that came of yesterday -- Quinnipiac, our CNN polling, the Gallup poll indicators right now -- the nervous campaign this morning is the Harris campaign. They're not where they need to do be with young voters. They're not where they need to be with voters of color, working-class voters. 
 
They're not achieving the margins that they need that Joe Biden was getting in 2020. And Trump's base is immovable and right now, his administration and him personally are more popular than they have ever been. It's a problem.
 
BERMAN:  Well, let me tell you one thing that could change all of this, which is the new details coming out about the vice presidential debate next week. We have learned that the candidates will be standing for the first time since 2008. And I say this to two people --
 
JENNINGS:  Good training.
 
FINNEY:  Exactly.
 
BERMAN:  You guys are here. You guys are ready right now.
 
So what impact will standing vice presidential nominees have on the outcome of this election?
 
FINNEY:  Woo, I hope they're -- are they going to be far enough apart? I'm kidding. 
 
It provides more energy. It all -- I mean --
 
BERMAN:  You don't have to answer this question. It's a dumb question.
 
FINNEY:  No, I know. No, look, I actually think it's kind of interesting because it does provide more energy. And both of them -- both men tend to talk a lot with their hands and they're both pretty energetic.
 
JENNINGS:  It's easier though when they begin the feats of strength if you're already standing and you start to get into --
 
FINNEY:  Right.
 
JENNINGS:  -- it. 
 
FINNEY:  That's right.
 
JENNINGS:  It's easier than getting up from the table. 
 
BERMAN:  I --
 
JENNINGS:  I applaud this move. 
 
BERMAN:  We at CNN NEWS CENTRAL applaud any move to stand up.
 
FINNEY:  You know, just saying I don't know. It's a pretty bold move there.
 
BERMAN:  It is.
 
All right, Scott Jennings and Karen Finney. Thank you both so much -- Sara.
 
SIDNER:  All right.
 
Breaking overnight, a brand new FAA report says that factory workers at Boeing were pressured to put speed over quality and did not get proper job training. The FAA stated the investigation after that terrifying door plug -- you'll remember that incident on an Alaska Airlines flight, a Boeing plane, in January. 
 
CNN aviation correspondent Pete Muntean is joining us now. This was an audit. We are looking at that terrifying picture of the missing door plug on that plane.
 
What else did you get out of this report?
 
PETE MUNTEAN, CNN AVIATION CORRESPONDENT:  Well, some pretty egregious findings here, Sara, in this never-before-published audit of Boeing's planes in Renton, Washington. It is the same plant where that brand new 737 MAX-9 rolled off the line without those critical door plug bolts installed leading to that terrifying door plug blowout on Alaska Airlines flight 1282. 
 
The findings include the results of an FAA survey of 2,100 Boeing workers on the 737 line, and about half said schedule pressure is still significant. Essentially, putting speed above quality, which is huge since it was a quality control failure that led to the door plug incident. 
 
One more big finding here. Workers said they felt inadequately trained by Boeing to do their jobs, and some said that Boeing was not providing them with the proper tools. The FAA audit found that one worker was using a tool he made himself to check the gaps between certain parts of the airline. The report says this tool is mechanic- made, unauthorized, uncalibrated, and unmarked. And when asked how other door mechanics take this measurement, that workers said they all do the same thing.
 
Now, these findings were released by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. It -- in a few hours, it will grill the FAA administrator Mike Whitaker, saying that the agency has not stayed on top of Boeing.
 
Now, yesterday, during a different hearing on Capitol Hill, Whitaker insisted the FAA has ramped up its oversight of Boeing and that Boeing has made some strides. 
 
But I want you to listen now to what he said about a turnaround of Boeing's culture when it comes to safety.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MIKE WHITAKER, ADMINISTRATOR, FAA:  I think the safety culture change is going to be a long-term project. I think it's going to take years of delivering that safety message and the employees actually seeing that safety is more important than production for that culture to change. So it's going to take a very long-term sustained commitment.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[07:45:12]
 
MUNTEAN:  So it seems that the FAA administrator has walked into a new buzzsaw on Capitol Hill today.
 
Boeing underscores to me that it has taken big steps to empower workers but it's a bit of a journey. Remember, Boeing workers still on strike, now in its 13th day. And interestingly, the FAA chief said yesterday that Boeing had a new safety plan to roll out to employees, but that rollout has been delayed by the strike -- Sara.
 
SIDNER:  Oh, that's rough.
 
Thank you so much, Pete Muntean. These are really important investigations that need to happen.
 
All right. Coming up, Hezbollah targets Tel Aviv trying to launch one of its closest strikes on that city from Lebanon. How the latest assault could escalate the conflict there in the Middle East.
 
And the latest allegations against Sean "Diddy" Combs. These accusations go back more than two decades.
 
(COMMERCIAL)
 <br>[07:50:20]
 
BOLDUAN:  Sirens ringing out after Israel's military says that it intercepted a Hezbollah missile near Tel Aviv, the first ballistic missile launched from Lebanon to ever reach that close to the city. Hezbollah said it was targeting the headquarters of the Mossad, Israel's intelligence (audio gap). Cross-border fighting between Israel and the Iran-backed terror group has continued to increase despite calls from the United States and others to de-escalate this conflict before it gets out of control -- more out of control. 
 
Last hour, Secretary of State Tony Blinken spoke to ABC News.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ANCHOR, ABC NEWS:  Do you think this can be contained?
 
ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  I do, and it needs to be contained. We're working to prevent escalation and we're working to make sure this doesn't get into a full-scale war. Look, Israel has a very legitimate problem it has to solve.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOLDUAN:  Joining us right now, White House national security communications adviser John Kirby here in New York as the United Nations General Assembly is underway. We really appreciate you coming in this morning, John.
 
JOHN KIRBY, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL SECURITY COMMUNICATIONS ADVISER: Great to be here.
 
BOLDUAN:  This is one of the militant group's most far-reaching attacks into Israeli territory ever. How bad is this?
 
KIRBY:  Well, it's certainly deeply concerning obviously to the Israelis, of course, but also to us. Because as Sec. Blinken just said a little bit ago, we really have been working hard since the beginning of this conflict to prevent it from escalating and deepening and broadening. And one of the key areas that we've been trying to prevent escalation is between Israel and Hezbollah --
 
BOLDUAN:  Yeah.
 
KIRBY:  -- up along that border with Lebanon. 
 
So obviously, we woke up this morning to these reports -- deeply concerning. Evidence still, again, as Sec. Blinken noted, that Israel faces a legitimate threat from a terrorist group backed by Iran right across the border.
 
BOLDUAN:  I hear what Sec. Blinken said this morning. But Leon Panetta said on Monday, "We've crossed the threshold between a war that tries to apply some restraint and a wider war." Leon Panetta, the former CIA director and former defense secretary says, "We're clearly walking into a much wider war." He thinks that -- he suggests we are past the point of no return now.
 
KIRBY:  We believe that there is still time and space for a diplomatic solution here to de-escalate the tensions and to prevent an all-out war. Now, what we haven't seen along that blue line between Israel and Lebanon is ground maneuvers -- ground forces moving in. It's all -- it's all been strikes. Again, I'm not diminishing the violence --
 
BOLDUAN:  No.
 
KIRBY:  -- wrought by the strikes but it has not been --
 
BOLDUAN:  That's the indicative -- do you think that's the -- that's the -- that's the point of no return?
 
KIRBY:  I think certainly if you start to see ground forces moving, then it definitely takes the fighting up a notch, and we're trying to prevent exactly that outcome. 
 
BOLDUAN:  Fareed Zakaria interviewed the new Iranian president this week and Fareed asked if Iran would ask Hezbollah to restrain -- to show restraint. The Iranian president did not say yes, really saying, "Hezbollah cannot stand alone against a country that is being defended and supported and supplied by Western countries, European countries, and the United States of America."
 
Barak Ravid is reporting Hezbollah asked Iran to launch a direct attack itself against Israel. Do you believe that is accurate?
 
KIRBY:  I won't talk about intelligence matters one way or another or potential -- speculate on what future operations would be. Let me just say a couple of things.
 
He -- the president of Iran yesterday stood in the U.N. General Assembly and called on the world to enforce a ceasefire. Well, you know what? He could have a big role in that. He can -- he --
 
BOLDUAN:  He's definitely not showing -- not going to ask Hezbollah to pull back.
 
KIRBY:  But he could. I mean, they are their resources. They are the backer of Hezbollah. 
 
So you want to stand in the U.N. General Assembly and say you want a ceasefire. Well, you know what? So do we -- and we've been working harder than any other nation -- President Biden has -- to get that done. So you, the new Iranian president, you want a ceasefire, then you can take a role here, too. You have influence over Hezbollah and Mr. Nasrallah, and you can help enforce that ceasefire.
 
BOLDUAN:  The United States -- very clearly, you want this to de- escalate but at the same time -- and this isn't -- these aren't -- this isn't and either-or but at the same time, do you believe -- does the president believe that Israel is safer in taking out now this list of leaders and commanders and top operatives within Hezbollah?
 
KIRBY:  There is no question that when you go after the leadership of a terrorist organization the way they have, the way we have, you are disrupting their ability to plan, to resource, to recruit, to operate, to maneuver. 
 
BOLDUAN:  Would you call them broken?
 
KIRBY:  I would say that they have -- with Hamas and Hezbollah, they have dealt heavy, heavy blows to those two terrorist organizations and their ability to operate -- very much so in Hamas. I mean, they've taken almost every leader out of Hamas except of Sinwar himself. 
 <br>[07:55:00] BOLDUAN:  Do you know -- do you know what the end goal is? Have you -- do you -- do you have a clear understanding of what Netanyahu's end goal is when -- with regard to this conflict with Hezbollah?
 
KIRBY:  I think -- I don't want to speak for the prime minister. He has spoken for himself. But he --
 
BOLDUAN:  Does -- has he -- does the president have a clear indication of what it is?
 
KIRBY:  We are in constant touch with Prime Minister Netanyahu. We have made clear that they will continue to have our support as they defend themselves. No nation should have to live with these threats right across the border. I mean, right next door to the north and to the west. No nation should have to live with that. They have a right to defend themselves.
 
How they do it matters. We're talking to them about that -- about precision, about being discriminate, being more so because there have been too many civilians killed here. 
 
And the other thing we're talking to the prime minister about, and his team is trying to bring this war to an end. The president addressed this yesterday in his speech in the General Assembly. It's time to end the war. The United States is working hard to get a ceasefire in place certainly with respect to Hamas, and we are talking to the Israelis about de-escalating.
 
BOLDUAN:  But let's be honest. I mean, is a hostage and ceasefire deal with Hamas on ice right now?
 
KIRBY:  I don't know that I would describe it as on ice, Kate. I would tell you that we're -- we still have the shoulder to the wheel. The president still has directed his team to continue to work on it.
 
BOLDUAN:  On pause?
 
KIRBY:  Are we making progress?
 
BOLDUAN:  I'm not trying to --
 
KIRBY:  No.
 
BOLDUAN:  -- because I have the -- we have the families of these hostages on, and Yael Alexander told me last week --
 
KIRBY:  Yeah.
 
BOLDUAN:  -- optimism is gone. They're trying to hold on to hope. 
 
KIRBY:  And I hope they still can. I hope they still can. And I hope that they know President Biden's not going to give up the fight.
 
BOLDUAN:  How is it possible that you can get a hostage-ceasefire deal in the midst of Hezbollah and Israel now fighting? KIRBY:  As the president said, every -- something's unrealistic until all of a sudden, it's not. And when you're in negotiations you never know when that breakthrough is going to come.
 
Look, it's clear to us that Mr. Sinwar isn't interested in a ceasefire right now. He's dug in in a tunnel somewhere surrounded by hostages.
 
BOLDUAN:  Is Netanyahu interested in a ceasefire?
 
KIRBY:  The Israeli -- the proposal on the table is an Israeli proposal. It's the one the that the prime minister and his team put forward and they continue to talk to us about moving this thing forward. I would just tell you that Mr. Sinwar is the main obstacle.
 
BOLDUAN:  John, thank you for coming in as always.
 
KIRBY:  Yeah.
 
BOLDUAN:  I really appreciate it.
 
KIRBY:  You bet. My pleasure.
 
BOLDUAN:  Thank you very, very much -- John.
 
BERMAN:  Difficult times.
 
All right. This morning, the FAA is investigating after two passengers were injured when United pilots had to make a sudden maneuver mid-air because of a collision warning. They were flying from New York to San Francisco when there was a plane at a lower altitude. United says that the seatbelt signs were on at the time but one of the injured passengers was out of their seat.

Bound, raped, and then video sold as pornography. That is the allegation in the latest lawsuit against music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs. Thalia Graves came forward saying that Combs and his bodyguard not only drugged her but then raped her back in 2001. Several years later she claims she found out he allegedly recorded the sexual assault. 
 
CNN entertainment reporter Elizabeth Wagmeister joining us now live from Los Angeles. Elizabeth, these allegations are stunning. They are particularly graphic and extremely disturbing. 
 
What can you tell us?
 
ELIZABETH WAGMEISTER, CNN ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER:  You're absolutely right, Sara. These allegations are truly disturbing and some of the most graphic that we have seen. There are also new allegations in this lawsuit, which is the 11th civil suit against Combs over the last year -- some allegations, Sara, that we have not seen before.
 
You mentioned that this new accuser Thalia Graves -- that she has alleged that she learned that her alleged rape was taped without her consent and more than 20 years later that she learned that the video was being distributed. And her and her attorney, Gloria Allred -- you see them right there -- they believe that it has been shown and it has been sold as pornography.
 
Now, yesterday, Thalia Graves and Gloria Allred -- they held a press conference here in Los Angeles. I was in attendance. And Thalia spoke about the emotional toll that this alleged attack took on her life. 
 
Let's take a look at what she had to say.
