THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.

DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Shortage is because of the pens themselves. The active ingredients they can actually create fast enough, but creating the pens, which are 14 different components, all patented, they need to be assembled, that's often what takes these medications and shortage.
 
And while those shortages are starting to catch up, it still makes it really hard for people sometimes to access these drugs. Fred?
 
FREDRICKA WHITFIELD, CNN HOST: Oh my gosh, it's fascinating though. Thank you so much, Dr. Sanjay Gupta.
 
And of course, you don't want to miss this report, "Is Ozempic Right For You?" It airs tomorrow at 8:00 p.m. Eastern right here on CNN.
 
All right, hello again, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me this Saturday. I'm Fredricka Whitfield.
 
All right, top of the hour, let's begin with the latest wave of Trump loyalists being picked to join President-elect Donald Trump's administration. He's tapping campaign staff members Steven Cheung, Karoline Leavitt, and Sergio Gor for key White House roles. He's also selected North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum as his Interior Secretary.
 
While Trump's cabinet is taking shape, there are still eight major cabinet positions open. And some of his picks are already facing an uphill climb for Capitol Hill confirmation. Sources tell CNN Trump's transition team was caught off guard by allegations involving his choice for Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth. Within 48 hours of his selection, they got a complaint about a sexual assault allegation involving the former Fox News host.
 
CNN's Steve Contorno is covering the developments surrounding the Trump transition. Steve, you also have new reporting on how conservatives are searching for partisans in the federal government before Trump is to actually be sworn into office? STEVE CONTORNO, CNN REPORTER: That's right, Fred. There are groups that have been anticipating for years the return of a Republican administration and plans to mass purge the federal bureaucracy of workers. And these groups have been creating a roadmap for how Donald Trump could get rid of civil servants that may be disloyal to him.
 
One of these groups has been putting -- called through public records requests. They look through social media posts. They look through the online biographies and work histories as well as campaign contributions of people within the Department of Homeland Security to find 60 individuals who they have put on a, quote, "target list" for Donald Trump to potentially get rid of because they don't believe that these people would help him fulfill his promises on immigration and the U.S. southern border.
 
Another group, the Heritage Foundation, has put out about 65,000 requests for information from government agencies through the Freedom of Information Act, asking for all kinds of records from government employees, including their emails and text messages that may include what they believe are evidence of partisanship.
 
They've been searching for words like Elon Musk or climate change or DEI phrases, trying to find partisans and potentially creating a list of people for Donald Trump to remove once he takes office.
 
Now, the Trump campaign and the transition team did not respond as to whether they are aware of this work. But the people involved in these efforts say that they run in the same circles as Trump's advisers and they believe that it will be used by the team when they get into office.
 
WHITFIELD: And then Steve, we're also getting new information on Trump's immigration plans.
 
CONTORNO: Exactly, Fred. We have learning that Donald Trump intends to hit the ground running with a host of executive orders from the moment he gets in, trying to make good on his immigration promises. Let me walk you through some of what that would entail.
 
It would include expanding detention facilities using a lot of private prisons, the return of the remain in Mexico policy that requires people to stay on the southern side of the U.S. border until their immigration status is finalized, mandatory detention of people caught crossing the border, and also bringing back the controversial family detention policy.
 
The big question is how does Trump plan to pay for all these policies and this mass deportation? Well, one idea is to declare a national emergency on immigration that would allow him to unlock Pentagon resources. And Trump has already put in place some of the key advisers who will be leading this immigration effort.
 
And that includes Tom Homan, who will serve as border czar, Kristi Noem, who will be the Homeland Security -- the Secretary of Homeland Security, as well as Stephen Miller, his long-time immigration adviser, who will be a deputy chief of staff. Now, Kristi Noem obviously has to go through a confirmation process first. However, the other two will be just advisers to Trump and will not have to go through that process. Fred?
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Steve Contorno, thanks so much.
 
All right, on Capitol Hill, House Speaker Mike Johnson is opposing the release of a House Ethics investigation of Trump attorney general pick, Matt Gaetz.
 <br>[13:05:08]
 
A lawyer representing two women who testified in that probe says one of his clients saw Gaetz have sex with a minor. CNN's Paula Reid has more.
 
PAULA REID, CNN CHIEF LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: I've been speaking with my sources in and around the Gaetz investigation, and one source who spoke with Hill investigators tells me that the Hill has obtained, quote, "highly damaging evidence" against the former congressman.
 
We've learned those investigators have spoken with many of the same people who were interviewed in the Justice Department's federal criminal probe, including a witness who was just 17 years old when Gaetz allegedly had sex with her and Gaetz's ex-girlfriend, who was also a key witness in the federal investigation.
 
Now, a lawyer for the underage girl has called for the ethics report to be released, but I've spoken with witnesses who've been interviewed both for the criminal probe and the Hill probe, and I got mixed reaction when asked if this should be released. Some witnesses don't want to live through it again.
 
They dealt with these salacious allegations for several years while the criminal probe was pending. No charges were brought against the congressman, and they'd rather not relive that. So right now, the question is, will this report be released? And when it is released, how much of this evidence will be included? And also, what else did they learn?
 
They've likely looked at issues far beyond those explored by the Justice Department. Unclear, though, if we'll get any answers.
 
Paula Reid, CNN, Washington.
 
WHITFIELD: All right, the city of Dearborn, Michigan is home to one of the largest Arab-American populations in the U.S. Outraged by the Biden administration's alliance with Israel, many voters there either voted for Trump, picked third party candidates, or they didn't cast a ballot at all.
 
CNN's Danny Freeman traveled to Dearborn to speak with voters about the election and how they feel about Trump's latest staffing decisions.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) DANNY FREEMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In Dearborn, Michigan, the campaigns and the candidates have gone, but the politics linger.
 
ALBERT ABBAS, VOTED FOR TRUMP: I think that the community's going to continue to be engaged and polarized.
 
FREEMAN (voice-over): In the final days of the race, Lebanese-American Albert Abbas welcomed former President Trump to his family's restaurant in Dearborn.
 
ABBAS: I, along with many others, truly appreciate that you made it a priority to visit Dearborn.
 
FREEMAN (voice-over): Abbas agreed to host Trump only after he pledged to bring peace to Lebanon and the Middle East.
 
ABBAS: We're very optimistic and hopeful, and quite frankly, I'm excited about a second term of a Trump presidency.
 
FREEMAN: What was your reaction to some of these cabinet announcements? You see someone like Mike Huckabee as ambassador to Israel.
 
ABBAS: Yes.
 
FREEMAN: Someone like Elise Stefanik looking to go to the U.N, Marco Rubio -- 
 
ABBAS: Yes.
 
FREEMAN (voice-over): -- all pretty hardline when it comes to the Middle East.
 
ABBAS: I'm not going to judge his appointees right now. We'll hold his feet to the fire once he's president.
 
FREEMAN (voice-over): President-elect Trump won the state of Michigan by about 80,000 votes. And the majority Arab-American city of Dearborn, Trump won with 42 percent of the vote, while Vice President Harris only received 36 percent. Jill Stein, the Green Party protest choice of many anti-war voters, got 18 percent of the vote here.
 
FREEMAN: What was the perception that you thought Donald Trump will be doing?
 
DALAL BAYDOUN, VOTED FOR THE GREEN PARTY: So, as Donald Trump told us, he will stop the war, but now he's putting people in office that are with the war, practically.
 
FREEMAN (voice-over): Dalal Baydoun voted for Jill Stein. She couldn't bring herself to vote for Vice President Harris because of the Biden administration's support for Israel. But she feels Trump has already squandered his goodwill in the Arab-American community.
 
FREEMAN: How do you feel about voting Green Party now? BAYDOUN: I feel good that I don't have blood on my hands because, like I said, they're all with genocide. So having to be not a part of all that makes me feel good.
 
FREEMAN: Do you regret not voting for Harris?
 
BAYDOUN: No. Because she's even worse.
 
FREEMAN: How are you feeling now that President-elect Trump won?
 
LEXIS ZEIDAN, CO-FOUNDER, UNCOMMITTED NATIONAL MOVEMENT: Yes, I'd say definitely a range of emotions. Disappointed is one. Angry is another.
 
FREEMAN (voice-over): Lexis Zeidan is one of the leaders of the Uncommitted Movement and left the top of the ticket blank. She hears the criticism that voters like her helped elect Trump, but rejects it, saying they wanted Harris to work with them.
 
ZEIDAN: You could have added every single vote in Dearborn and Kamala still would have lost. You could have added every single Jill Stein vote across the country, Kamala still would have lost. And so this wasn't a referendum on Gaza policy.
 
This election was not lost because of Gaza or because of Uncommitted voters. What it showed you is that she not only was sidelining Uncommitted and Arab and Muslim voters, but she was sidelining other communities of color as well.
 
FREEMAN: Do you have any regrets?
 
ZEIDAN: I have no regrets because what I did and, you know, what I believe Uncommitted did in the last, you know, 10 months is we did everything we could to offer the democratic leadership something to save this democracy and to save Palestinian lives.
 
FREEMAN (voice-over): Danny Freeman, CNN, Dearborn, Michigan.

WHITFIELD: Still to come, President Biden is attending the last APEC Summit of his presidency and he's set to meet with China's Xi Jinping for the last time. What to expect from that meeting next.
 
Plus, the daughter of Malcolm X suing the CIA, the FBI, and the NYPD. Why the family says the agencies were involved in the civil rights leader's assassination. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[13:15:05]
 
WHITFIELD: On Capitol Hill, House Speaker Mike Johnson is opposing the release of a House Ethics investigation of Trump attorney general pick Matt Gaetz. A lawyer representing two women who testified in that probe says one of his clients saw Gaetz have sex with a minor.
 
Let's talk more about all this. Here with me now is Justice Department Correspondent for USA Today, Bart Jansen. Bart, good to see you. So the Department of Justice pursued a years-long sex crimes investigation on Gaetz but did not decide to pursue charges. Might that still weigh in on whether the U.S. Senate ultimately puts him through the confirmation process?
 
BART JANSEN, JUSTICE DEPT. CORRESPONDENT, USA TODAY: Well, that's right. I mean, it's raised big flags for a lot of Republican senators. Republicans, of course, control 53 of the hundred votes in the Senate. So that sounds like a majority. But this week when news of Gaetz's choice being picked for -- to head the Justice Department, Susan Collins of Maine called herself shocked.
 
Lisa Murkowski said it was not a serious choice. Others said they wanted to get a look at some of these investigative materials that have been conducted into Gaetz. The House Ethics Committee investigation began in April of '21. It got suspended for a while while the Justice Department investigated criminal charges.
 
They decided in February of '23 not to press charges against Gaetz. So then the House Ethics Committee resumed its investigation, and we thought we might get a look at a report as early as yesterday, on Friday, but then with Gaetz's departure from the House, with his nomination to the Justice Department, the Ethics Committee no longer says that they will release the report.
 
So now the question is, can the Senate obtain it from the House? Some senators are talking about subpoenaing the report.
 
WHITFIELD: Right. In fact, that's what I was going to ask you. There was an option, a possible option with the subpoena. Or is anyone serious about pursuing that?
 
JANSEN: Well, I think they are serious about -- well, Democrats at the least. Senator Dick Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, who is the top Democrat on the Judiciary, he'll hand over the gavel to Chuck Grassley, Republican of Iowa, who will oversee any confirmation hearing for Gaetz.
 
Durbin has said they need to subpoena the document. There are several Republicans, including Cramer of North Dakota and John Cornyn of Texas, who contested for a leadership position saying that they need to see the investigative materials that went into this case.
 
And it's not clear whether they would be released publicly, but they -- the senators themselves want to see the stuff before they talk to Gaetz.
 
WHITFIELD: And what are you hearing, if anything, from people within the DOJ about the notion that Gaetz would lead that department potentially as AG?
 
JANSEN: Well, I think it's safe to say there's some queasiness at the Justice Department. Both Trump and Gaetz have talked about overhauling the department. Gaetz has proposed to abolish the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives.
 
They were both investigated by the Justice Department. Trump, of course, faced two sets of federal charges that are being wound down right now. But both left a bitter taste in both of their mouths and Gaetz has said he wants to burn the place down.
 
I mean, that's hyperbole, but they are both expected to severely overhaul the department. And so, any career staffers (INAUDIBLE).
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Bart Jansen, we'll leave it there for now. Thank you so much. So glad you could be with us.
 
All right, when we come back, President Joe Biden posing with world leaders at the APEC Summit ahead of his final meeting with China's President, Xi Jinping. We're live at the summit next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[13:23:37]
 
WHITFIELD: All right, two world leaders on different trajectories of meeting today on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Summit in Peru. Outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden planning to meet shortly with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Their meeting comes with the election of Donald Trump casting a large shadow over the gathering.
 
CNN's Kayla Tausche is joining us now from Lima. Kayla, what will Biden and Xi be focusing on today?
 
KAYLA TAUSCHE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Fred, the conversation is expected to take two tracks between these world leaders who represent the most consequential bilateral relationship in the world and also have known each other for more than a decade. But in this third and final meeting during Biden's term, they're going to discuss first areas where they have some shared interests and some prior cooperation.
 
Those issues are military level communication, efforts to curb illicit fentanyl trafficking, as well as some cooperation on climate policy. But then there are some of the thornier issues where President Biden is expected to issue some warnings to President Xi.
 
And those issues are China's support of Russia's war in Ukraine, the deployment of thousands of North Korean troops to Russia to train for potential deployment to Ukraine, as well as issues of cybersecurity, with President Biden expected to take a very strong line on that issue in particular.
 <br>[13:25:00]
 
But, of course, the backdrop to this is that there are very few assurances that Biden can offer to President Xi, and there are very few deliverables or outcomes that can be notched. U.S. officials acknowledge as much that this is more of a moment to take stock and reflect and to provide a stern message, even as that relationship is going to take a new shape when President-elect Donald Trump takes office.
 
Trump has already installed a bevy of hardline China hawks who will be executing his own policy against the People's Republic of China, which is expected to begin in no small part with very steep tariffs on imports coming into the U.S. from China.
 
But certainly, President Biden is going to look to leave his mark on that consequential relationship with a world leader that he's talked about frequently, that he knows quite well, even though that has not done much to tamp down the threat that China poses to what the U.S. sees as its own security, as well as the world order.
 
WHITFIELD: And Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is saying that he expects the war with Russia to end faster now that Trump is taking office. What's the context of him saying that?
 
TAUSCHE: Well, this is a 180-degree shift for President Zelenskyy, who just a few months ago, in the middle of the presidential campaign, gave some comments to the New Yorker magazine where he was critical of Donald Trump and said that the former president thinks he knows how to end the war, but has no idea.
 
He also called Trump's vice presidential pick, now the Vice President- elect, J.D. Vance, too radical. Those were comments that elicited quite a bit of criticism from Trump, and at times, a refusal to meet in person with Zelenskyy.
 
They ended up having that meeting, which was important for the Ukrainians to try to figure out the potential support that would await the country in either outcome of the election. And clearly now, Zelenskyy is trying to work to protect the access to American military and financial aid, which is in question, given the results of the election. Fred?
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Kayla Tausche in Lima, Peru. Thanks so much.
 
All right, joining us now with more on all that's in front of the president now in his, what, less than two months left in office, Jamie Metzl, a senior fellow with the Atlantic Council and the Former Executive Vice President of the Asia Society. He's also a former staffer in the Bill Clinton administration.
 
And there's more, the author of "Superconvergence: How the Genetics, Biotech, and AI Revolutions Will Transform Our Lives, Work, and World." Welcome to you, Jamie.
 
JAMIE METZL, SR. FELLOW, ATLANTIC COUNCIL: Thank you, Fred.
 
WHITFIELD: All right, let's talk about President Biden there in Lima, Peru. He's, you know, almost out the door at the White House, but he is, you know, meeting with President Xi Jinping. And of course, the relationship he has with Xi is very different than that of the incoming President Trump's relationship with Xi.
 
So for Biden, what will be the goal today? What's the importance of him meeting with Xi? METZL: Well, Joe Biden is sadly a very tragic figure, excuse me, at this point of his career. He's like an aging King Lear at the end of the play. And so the message that Biden is trying to deliver, not just to Xi, but also to our allies, is one of continuity.
 
With Xi, it's we're going to stay tough on China. And there's all kinds of things that China is doing that are totally unacceptable to the United States. But there's a continuity in the policies of tough on China from the first Trump administration, the Biden administration, and now the next, excuse me, Trump administration.
 
But for everybody else, America's allies are even more concerned than our adversaries. For China, for Russia, I think in their heart of hearts, the Trump victory is kind of a win for them. But for our allies, there is deep concern about how President Trump is going to position himself.
 
And so President Biden is representing an America that is familiar to many of us. It's the America of FDR, of President Eisenhower, President Truman, of Ronald Reagan, even. And so that is the message. Nobody is going to think that President Biden is carrying the water for anything really relevant for the future of our country.
 
But America is still here. President Biden is still the President of the United States. And America is going to play a role in the future of all of these countries and our world.
 
WHITFIELD: Yes, and when you look at those pictures of, you know, Biden and Xi, I mean, there does seem to be a level of comfort just in seeing these two, you know, veteran leaders. But regardless of whatever personal connections Joe Biden has with Xi Jinping, there are diplomatic strains to address, right? Concerns over Taiwan, allegations of China spying, add to all of that -- 
 
METZL: Yes.
 
WHITFIELD: -- the uncertainty posed by the return of Donald Trump. What do you imagine Xi and Biden will actually talk about?
 <br>[13:30:03]
 
METZL: So Xi and Biden have a long relationship, but this is a very adversarial relationship. China is aggressively harming not just the interests of the United States but the interests of the world.
 
It's basically declared war on America's treaty ally in the Philippines and in the South China Sea. It's working to encircle Taiwan. It's doing everything to support the Russians in Ukraine by arming them. It's hacked into America's communication system. 
 
So it's not the case that this is some kind of lovey-dovey relationship. President Biden and the Biden administration has been very, very tough on China.
 
But the Biden administration has been careful to try to have some kind of continuity with that relationship. And so now there's just an unknown about what is going to be the next phase of U.S.-China relations.
 
And there are certainly people in the United States who are saying, oh, great, the new incoming Trump administration is going to be even tougher on China than the Biden administration, which was very tough.
 
But from the perspective of most of the world, the conflicts with China, what's happening with Iran, what's happening with Russia and in Ukraine, it's all kind of connected. 
 
And so if President Trump negotiates the kind of surrender to Putin as he negotiated as a surrender to the Taliban, as in the name of ending this conflict, everybody around the world, and especially our adversaries, are going to look at that and say, hey, maybe we have freer rein.
 
The Chinese, freer rein with Taiwan, the North Koreans, the Iranians. And so that's why it's really important, not just for President Biden to say, hey, there's continuity with America, but for President Trump and the incoming Trump administration to say we are going to stand with all of our allies and partners.
 
And they're making maybe some strong messages with regard to China and Iran. But the seeming weakness in the face of Russia isn't just about Russia and Ukraine. It's about Americas interests and the worlds interests more generally. 
 
WHITFIELD: All right, Jamie Metzl, so glad you could be with us. Thank you so much. 
 
METZL: Thank you, Fred. 
 
WHITFIELD: Coming up, a Southwest flight in Dallas hit by a bullet as it was preparing to depart. Details on the investigation into the incident, next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[13:37:01]
 
WHITFIELD: A new scare in the skies. Friday night, a Southwest Airlines airplane was hit by a bullet as it prepared to depart from the Dallas Airport. No injuries we're reported. 
 
And police say it's not clear if it was intentional. It's just one of several frightening incidents this week. Severe turbulence
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
(SCREAMING)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Everybody all right?
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WHITFIELD: Yes. That was severe turbulence, which forced a Scandinavian Airlines flight headed to Miami to return to Europe on Thursday. The plane was rerouted to Denmark, where it will undergo an inspection. No serious injuries we're reported. 
 
And then there was this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WHITFIELD: Passengers on an Alaska Airlines flight were told to brace after the plane blew a tire during departure. The aircraft made a safe emergency landing in Los Angeles. 
 
Plus, the FAA is investigating an incident on an American Airlines flight from Hawaii. The agency says an air traffic controller instructed the pilots to turn right after they did not make their assigned turn following takeoff.
 
And officials say that kept the plane from hitting mountains near the Honolulu International Airport. Listen.
 
(BEGIN AUDIO FEED)
 
AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER: Turn right and expedite your climb through terrain and then turn right, hitting 1-2-0.
 
(END AUDIO FEED)
 
WHITFIELD: And then, at the Denver International Airport, passengers aboard a Southwest flight had to evacuate the plane after a passenger's phone battery caught fire, igniting an airplane seat. That passenger was treated for burns.
 
That's a lot of scary stuff. 
 
CNN transportation analyst, Mary Schiavo, is joining me right now for more on insight into all of this. 
 
But I know you're going to say it's still the safest way to fly -- to travel is flying by air. So let's try and pick apart some of this stuff. 
 
I mean, this feels like an unusually large amount of incidents. What is going on here? That's right. 
 
MARY SCHIAVO, CNN TRANSPORTATION ANALYST: That's right. Well, there's a large amount of incidents. You know, the Federal Aviation Administration looks at trends. They look at numbers. 
 
So the fact that all these were reported and then some things do seem to be on the rise. For example, let's start with the wheels falling off planes. There have been -- or blowing. There have been a number of those this year. And so the FAA is going to look -- want to look at that very closely.
 
And on that flight, the plane went on to Los Angeles, which was probably -- I mean, usually they turn around and go back to the airport. But Alaska Airlines has maintenance -- has lots of maintenance on the west coast. 
 
And the LAX runways are wonderful. They're straight into the wind off the Pacific Ocean long and straight and a good runway. So that ended well. No one was hurt. 
 
The bullets on the airplane are a whole other issue. Everyone is on high alert because of the Haiti incidents where the planes we're fired upon just this month. And then again in the spring, earlier in the spring. 
 <br>[13:40:06]
 
But you know, there have been other instances in the United States where planes have been fired upon. Sometimes, you know, from around the airport. And there was one strange-- there have been more than one strange incidents where guns legally checked in the cargo hold did go off. 
 
The Dallas law enforcement is very competent. As soon as they see whether this is an entrance of a bullet to the plane or an exit, if there's only an entrance of the bullet to the plane and no exit, they should be able to find that bullet. 
 
And if it was from a high-powered hunting rifle, for example, then they have to look at the perimeter of the airport. Does it really give enough security around the airports? And should we be reevaluating that all over the country? What's our security perimeter around the airport? 
 
WHITFIELD: So some issues, you know, can't necessarily be avoided, such as turbulence right? That is just, you know, a natural phenomenon. But the flight near Honolulu, being told, you know, to avoid a very permanent mountain range. I mean, what does that suggest to you? 
 
SCHIAVO: Well, that's very troubling to me because, you know, the equipment on the aircraft is wonderful. It tells you when you're getting near to -- to things that, you know, has a ground proximity warning.
 
And the fact that the ground proximity warning on this aircraft, we are told, did not go off, so perhaps they weren't as close to, you know, near disaster as we thought. Of course, they need to check that airplane to make sure it's functioning. 
 
But coming, you know, close to any mountain range so the air traffic control has to remind the flight crew, hey, turn right to avoid a disaster is troubling. And I suspect the airline will be looking into that as well as the FAA. That is a troubling development. 
 
But of course, again, no loss of life. And it ended, you know, happily and safely. 
 
WHITFIELD: Yes. And there is a statement from American Airlines saying, "During the climb out of Honolulu on November 13th, the crew of American Airlines flight 298 requested and received right turn clearance and complied with controller instructions." 
 
And the statement points out, quoting now, "There was no enhanced ground proximity warning system alert as there we're no issues with terrain clearance based on the trajectory of the aircraft." 
 
SCHIAVO: Right, right. And that's lifesaving equipment. I mean, there are untold, you know, hundreds or maybe thousands of lives saved by ground proximity warning and collision avoidance between aircraft and so many systems like that. And that has all gone into making flying as safe it is. 
 
The turbulence, you know, there's lots of reports that it has increased 50 percent since 1979. And also flying passengers have increased fivefold. So that's something that -- that the, you know, flying nations of the world are going to have to get their hands around.
 
We have to have more turbulence care, given the number of flights have increased. 
 
WHITFIELD: All right. All fascinating.
 
Mary Schiavo, always great to see you. Thank you so much. 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
SCHIAVO: We're still going to fly, though, aren't we? 
 
WHITFIELD: We are. Yes, we are. 
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
WHITFIELD: All right, thank you.
 
Coming up next, three daughters of civil rights leader, Malcolm X, are accusing the CIA, FBI and New York Police Department of playing a role in his assassination. Details next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[13:47:54]
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Welcome back. A new episode of "HOW IT REALLY HAPPENED" takes viewers to July 5, 1998, when a wealthy widow named Irene Silverman disappeared from her New York City townhouse.
 
While police went on a frantic search for her, they had no idea the investigation would unravel one of the most shocking series of crimes they had ever seen, a trail of evidence and fraud that stretched from the Bahamas to Los Angeles, perpetuated by Sante and Kenny Kimes.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED NEW ANCHOR: Questions tonight on the mysterious disappearance of a very wealthy woman. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED NEW ANCHOR: And it's not just Silverman who's missing tonight. Also gone without a trace is one of her tenants. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: On Monday evening, July 6th, there's a press conference held. And at that time, we released a sketch of Manny Guerin and a photo also of Irene Silverman. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Just to tell people, if you know either of these people or any information, please contact the tip line. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The big break came in the case on the morning of July 7th.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A detective from the NYPD working this case received a phone call from the FBI. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: One of the agents saw the press conference.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: As a result of him recognizing the sketch, he conveyed that he, in fact, thought that they had Manny Guerin in custody. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The FBI had arrested the fugitives the night before.
 
UNIDENTIFIED NEW ANCHOR: The tenant from the millionaire's mansion has been found and is behind bars tonight. 
 
Police think her tenant, 23-year-old Kenneth Kimes, is a con artist who gave the fake name Manny Guerin to live on the first floor of Silverman's townhouse. Kimes mother, Sante Kimes, was also arrested Sunday night.

WHITFIELD: Joining us now to discuss is private investigator, Cici McNair, whose work ranges from undercover with the FBI, the Joint Terrorist Task Force and the Organized Crime Intelligence Division of the NYPD. She worked on the case of Sante and Kenny Kimes and spent countless hours with them. 
 
Cici, great to see you. 
 <br>[13:50:02]
 
CICI MCNAIR, PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR: Thank you. 
 
WHITFIELD: OK, it's very intriguing. But you know, without giving too much away, because we certainly want everybody to watch and discover along the way, you know, what do you think is the most shocking thing about the Kimes case?
 
MCNAIR: The most shocking thing is that it was absolutely a web of criminal enterprise. It was credit card fraud. It was grand theft auto. It was insurance fraud. It was forged documents, dummy corporations. There were missing persons who were probably missing bodies.
 
Sante had arson and a slavery conviction in her past. And of course, there was murder. The case had everything. 
 
WHITFIELD: Wow. Why was Sante Kimes, I guess, such a successful criminal?
 
MCNAIR: She was highly intelligent. She was clever. She was relentless. And there was -- there was such a degree of manipulation and persuasion about her. What Sante wanted, she would go after until she got it. 
 
WHITFIELD: Wow. And so while you were investigating this, I mean, you spent a lot of time with Sante and Kenny, I guess trying to piece things together. How many hours, you know, I guess, would you spend a week with them?
 
MCNAIR: I went down to 100 Center Street about three or four times a week and saw them. And it was never less than two hours at a visit.
 
So I spent a lot of time with them from July of 1998 until the trial, which was started Valentines Day, the year 2000. 
 
So I can't even imagine the number of hours I spent. And then I helped -- I was on the defense team for the L.A. trial.
 
WHITFIELD: It -- it seems like a very fascinating case and very complicated, too. You've done a lot of digging on it. 
 
Cici McNair, so glad you could be with us.
 
Back-to-back episodes of "HOW IT REALLY HAPPENED" premieres tomorrow at 9:00 p.m. And 10 p.m. Eastern and Pacific, right here on CNN.

WHITFIELD: Three of Malcolm X's daughters are suing the CIA, FBI and NYPD, accusing the agencies of playing a role in the civil rights leader's assassination. 
 
They filed a $100 million lawsuit Friday in a Manhattan federal court, claiming the agencies we're aware of the assassination plot and failed to intervene. 
 
The civil rights leader was shot dead during a speech in New York City in 1965. Three men we're convicted, but two we're later exonerated in 2021. 
 
All right, the last super moon of the year shone brightly Friday night. And stargazers were able to capture some stunning images. The November full moon had a golden glow and appeared slightly bigger than average due to its orbit position. 
 
And if you missed it, there's another celestial event that you can catch. That's tonight -- starting tonight, a meteor shower is expected to begin tonight into early Sunday.
 
All right, Jake Paul and Mike Tyson finally faced off in their highly anticipated fight last night in front of more than 72,000 fans in Arlington, Texas. 
 
Netflix livestreamed the much-hyped bout but many viewers took to social media to complain about buffering, delays, lags and trouble loading the fight. 
 
Carolyn Manno breaks down what really happened in the ring.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
CAROLYN MANNO, CNN SPORTS ANALYST: Fred, those who were involved in planning this event did such a masterful job creating a tremendous amount of hype heading into Friday night. 
 
And that is really one of the things that social media influencer- turned-pro boxer, Jake Paul, is very good at. 
 
The former heavyweight champ, Mike Tyson, doing his part, too, slapping Paul at Thursday's weigh in, which really sent fans into a frenzy and got everybody excited for what might unfold. 
 
At 58 years old, Tyson hasn't fought professionally in over two decades, and that showed. He was able to keep up through the first two rounds. Paul and Tyson seemingly getting acclimated with one another. 
 
But then we saw the fall off and it happened very quickly. Tyson trying to pick it up in the third round, but he lost significant stamina. And Paul able to muster some well-timed punches against the former champ. 
 
He eventually beat Tyson via unanimous decision. So despite a lot of trash talk before this fight, Paul had nothing but respect for Tyson afterwards.

JAKE PAUL, PRO BOXER: First and foremost, Mike Tyson, it's such an honor. Let's give it up for Mike, bro. 
 
(CHEERING)
 
PAUL: He's a legend. He's the greatest to ever do it. He's the GOAT. I look up to him. I'm inspired by him. And we wouldn't be here today without him. This man is an icon. And it's just an honor to be able to fight him. 
 
And he's obviously the toughest, baddest man on the planet. So it was -- it was really tough, like I expected it to be.
