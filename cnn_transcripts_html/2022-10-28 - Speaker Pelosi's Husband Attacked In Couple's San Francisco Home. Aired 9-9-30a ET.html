ERICA HILL, CNN HOST: Good Morning, America. I'm Erica Hill. We do begin this hour with breaking news out of California. Paul Pelosi, the husband of Speaker Nancy Pelosi is hospitalized, we've learned, after he was attacked inside their San Francisco home. CNN's Whitney Wild is joining us with some of these details. So, this is just unfolding as we're learning some of these details, Whitney. But so far, what do we know? And how is he doing?
 
WHITNEY WILD, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT CORRESPONDENT: Well, Erica, this happened just a few hours ago at 2 AM. According to the Speaker's press people, Paul Pelosi was attacked within their San Francisco home early this morning. He's expected to make a full recovery. We have very few details at this point. Notably though, the suspect is in custody. We are still collecting more information, Erica, but certainly this is a very disturbing case. And we'll keep on it.
 
But right now, again, very few details. All we can tell you at this time is that Paul Pelosi was attacked early this morning in their San Francisco home. The Speaker was not at home. Erica.
 
HILL: So, just confirming the Speaker was not there. Is the Speaker currently, I don't have her travel schedule in front of me, I'm not sure if you do either. But is she currently in Washington?
 
WILD: I don't have her travel schedule. These are all details that we're working to collect this morning. But notably, I mean, when you look at the timing here, it is particularly disturbing. These are all details about that Capitol Police will continue to investigate. The big question now is what was the motivation for this attack? That is certainly a top of mind for Capitol Police as they investigate this attack.
 
HILL: Yes. Absolutely. You said for Capitol Police. So, would Capitol Police also be involved in this investigation even though it happened in San Francisco?
 
WILD: Correct. So, would we - both, the SFPD and Capitol Police, because of the Speaker. I also want to - I do want to share - we do have a statement from the Speaker's office in which she notes that early this morning, assailant broke in to the Pelosi residence in San Francisco, in other words of the statement violently assaulted Mr. Pelosi.
 
As you noted, Whitney, the assailant is in custody. The motivation for this attack is under investigation. And as it goes on to say that Mr. Pelosi was taken to hospital, as Whitney also noted is expected to make a full recovery. The statement going on to say the Speaker and her family are grateful to the first responders and medical professionals involved, understandably requesting some privacy at this time.
 
So, in terms of how this would work. Obviously, there are people who have more than one residence, especially when they are a lawmaker, they often have a place in Washington and of course, they have their home where they live in San Francisco. I know the Pelosi's has also have other - other homes as well. With no information right now, in terms of a motive, how did the Capitol Police come in here? Would there have been some sort of security on site given that the Speaker wasn't there? And by that, I mean, additional security, Whitney/
 
WILD: Those are all - those are all - what would happen is Capitol Police will confirm (inaudible) any more information about what may have motivated this, how the attack was actually - how he actually affected this attack, how he got into the home. So, they will check off all of this standard investigatory boxes, but further Erica, the big question for Capitol Police is going to be what kind of other threats may face for other protectees (ph) as we know, the Speaker has a very robust security detail there with her constantly.
 
And so, the other question is going to be what kind of risk may this possibly pose for their other protectees, so a lot of questions for Capitol Police this morning. And notably, as we look at the broader threat landscape and look back to January 6th, Capitol Police opened field offices throughout the country. They're in the field office in San Francisco. So, certainly you'd expect that those agents stationed near Pelosi's home in San Francisco and what I mean is regionally near Pelosi's home in San Francisco would be very deeply involved in this investigation, working very closely with San Francisco Police.
 
And we also - again, this is breaking news, that we're still collecting the details, but we will also reach out to the other law enforcement agencies, the FBI, for example, who may be involved just to get a better sense of again, what kind of possible threat this may pose for other protectees or to confirm that this was really random, the motivation here was really critical as they looked forward to how they're going to conduct the rest of the investigation, Erica.
 <br>[09:05:00]
 
HILL: Yes, it certainly will be. And you bring up such a great point there that this field office - field offices were opened around the country. But that's specifically there is one in the San Francisco area, which would obviously make it very easy for the Capitol Police to be fully in and involved on this investigation. Almost from the moment it began, given that proximity, Whitney stay with us.
 
I also want to bring in Nia-Malika Henderson, you know, and even like, as we're looking at this, as Whitney just pointed out, one of the things the Capitol Police will likely be looking into is, were there threats, we don't know, it's important to know, we don't know of a specific threat to Paul Pelosi, to the Speaker, to their San Francisco home.
 
Again, this is breaking news. So, we are - we are rolling this as we get more information. But important to note at this hour, we do not know of a specific threat. But the fact that there has been heightened concern for lawmakers, as we know that as Whitney pointed out, the Capitol, Police could be looking into any potential threats which may have been received for protectees. This really puts into sharp focus the climate in which we live now.
 
NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Let's think about what Susan Collins said earlier this month, the senator from Maine said she would not be surprised if a senator or House member was killed. She had someone throw a brick through her house in Maine, and she is speaking about the overall threat that lawmakers feel. And we've heard this from other lawmakers as well. So, in some ways, this is in line with what we've been hearing from lawmakers and what we've been hearing from law enforcement officials as well that there is this sort of increased atmosphere, and a sort of language around violence and actual violence, or attempted violence as well. So, this is deeply, deeply concerning. Well, obviously get more and more information as the day goes on.
 
But for now, this is where we are, right. This is where we are, there is a sort of threat of political violence that political leaders have been talking about and fearing for many, many months.
 
HILL: And for really, Nia, if we go back years even, I mean, let's remember what was happening in the wake of the election in 2020. The incidents that we saw in airports where different lawmakers were being approached in airports or when they were home, trying to speak with their constituents or maybe on their way to something by people who were frustrated, and actually downright angry with them because they didn't agree with statements they had made, or what they had planned to do in terms of certifying the election. Those are all very real moments that have been adding up.
 
HENDERSON: That's right. And listen, this has certainly been put on steroids over the last few years, certainly in the wake of Donald Trump's rhetoric, in the wake of what we saw in January 6th. A big example of political violence, attempted violence, violent language, threats of violence, hang Mike Pence, ideas about bringing Nancy Pelosi out of her office and doing, God knows what to her.
 
But this is the atmosphere that has had not only lawmakers, but law enforcement officials are concerned over many, many months. So again, we'll see what happens with this. And you imagine that if you're a lawmaker, at this point, many have already stepped up their security. You imagine many might want to step up their security more particularly at this time, where if you listen to some of the rhetoric on the campaign trail, it is sort of laced with a maybe subtext of violence, threats, sort of this idea that there's a good side and a bad side and a good and an evil. And that kind of language falls on the wrong ears and this is the kind of thing that might end up happening.
 
HILL: Yes, laced with violence or sometimes outright references to violence and very much you're with us or you're against us. Nia- Malika, Whitney Wild, appreciate it. We will continue to check in and continue to follow this story as we learn more details. So, definitely stay with us throughout the day for that.
 
As we look ahead to the election, both President Biden and former President Obama out on the campaign trail now, as the clock ticks down to Election Day, President Obama in Georgia, the Senate majority leader was caught on a hot mic expressing some concern about the Senate race in that state between Democrat Raphael Warnock and Republican challenger Herschel Walker Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): The state where we're going downhill is Georgia. It's hard to believe that they will go for Herschel Walker. That seat, we're in danger in that seat. We'll see.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HILL: CNN's Eva McCann joining us now from Atlanta. So, Democrats are really hoping that this visit from former President Obama will make a difference.
 
EVA MCKEND, CNN NATIONAL POLITICS REPORTER: Yes, Erica That is certainly the hope. We know that surrogates are not magic, but at a time when Democrats are facing a difficult midterm environment. They are tapping on Obama because
 <br>[09:10:00]
 
he is essentially universally loved by Democrats. We know that here in Georgia tonight, he is expected to implore Georgians to vote early, just about a week left to do so in this state. That's something that Democrats have been heavily emphasizing for the last few weeks. We also know that the sort of the reason that he is in demand is because he has proven to be really good for swing state Democrats. Congresswoman Nikema Williams here, she also chairs the state Democratic Party. She says that folks here commonly referred to him as their forever president. So, it totally makes sense. Erica, for him to be coming to the heart of things here in Atlanta this evening.
 
HILL: And we are learning that he is pretty interested in some of those down base - down ballot excuse me, races, Eva.
 
MCKEND: Yes, absolutely. He has taken an interest in these races for Secretary of State, really part of this larger concern about the erosion of democracy, something that you hear Democrats speak frequently about. President Obama as well has recorded dozens of commercials, over a dozen commercials airing in states across the country. Erica.
 
HILL: Eva McKend with the latest for us from Atlanta this morning. Thank you. New this morning, Elon Musk now in control of Twitter, his first big move, firing the company's top three executives. The billionaire has said he plans to loosen the company's content restrictions that could of course mean accounts that were once banned for violating the platform's rules could be reinstated. And number one at the top of that list, people are wondering about former President Donald Trump, could he return to the Twittersphere?
 
Well, Musk tweeting overnight after his takeover, The bird is freed. Let's bring in Chief Business Correspondent Christine Romans and Will Oremus, who's written extensively about Elon Musk for The Washington Post. So, Christine, first as we look at what this means, right now, the impacts of this takeover will be felt. There were concerns about layoffs, the fact that he came in and immediately got rid of the leadership reportedly, this is a lot for employees to take in this morning.
 
CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, employees are nervous and rightfully so, he has hinted and said that he plans to do major layoffs there as well. We don't know what he's going to do. He's unpredictable, by the way. He says he's not doing this to make money, a lot of analysts are saying that he really overpaid for Twitter. And he said, in a note to advertisers, he said, he's not doing this to make money. He's doing this for humanity. And he does it with humility, humility and Elon Musk, two things that sometimes don't go together very hand-in-hand.
 
But he said, Twitter obviously cannot become a free for all hellscape where anything can be said with no consequences. But that's exactly what many people are worried about, because he has sort of said that this should be a forum for free speech, people should be able to say what they want, you shouldn't have people in a Right-wing echo chamber and a Left-wing echo chamber who aren't talking to each other. So unclear if he'll bring back people who have been banned from the space and how he will actually moderate this content.
 
HILL: The moderation is a major factor. So well, you've covered Twitter, you've covered Elon Musk for so long, when he put out that statement about a hellscape. And we know that free speech in his words is so important to him. Hellscape for Elon Musk may not mean the same thing as hellscape to Will Oremus, Erica Hill, Christine Romans, you know, Jane or John Doe? Do we have any sense of what this could really look like?
 
WILL OREMUS, STAFF WRITER, THE WASHINGTON POST: It's hard to say how it will play out exactly. We know that Elon Musk has vacillated a bit between saying that he really wants to open the gates to unfettered free speech on Twitter, and then saying, well, you know, I don't think we want it to be overrun by extremists.
 
People who have worked in the social media industry for a long time have come to realize for the most part that those two visions aren't really compatible. And if you don't have rules, you are going to attract the most extreme voices. And we are going to see that starting today probably. I mean - I'm already seeing in my Twitter feed people testing out the boundaries, seeing if they can now use racial slurs with impunity, make antisemitic comments, and now that Musk is in- charge, they're hopeful that he'll be sympathetic and that he won't ban them.
 
So, we will see how that plays out. I mean, Twitter has never been the most civil place as anybody who uses it regularly could tell you, it may get a little wilder in wilier (ph).
 
HILL: It's a business. I mean, even though it's now private, Christine, it's still a business. There are advertisers to consider. Is there any sense right now that that is actually figuring into his calculus?
 
ROMANS: You know, he's sent this Twitter letter to advertisers trying to explain his rationale saying that much that has been written and said about his attempt to buy Twitter has been wrong. So, he's trying to set the record straight there. But he doesn't have the handcuffs of the public markets anymore, right. There won't be an SEC to look under the hood anymore because he doesn't have shareholders on Wall Street to where - public shareholders on Wall Street, pension funds and the like. So, he doesn't have that kind of pressure.
 
Is this a vanity project for him? It's unclear and it's unclear what he'll do with it next. I think we don't know what he's going to do and that's what's so fascinating about this, he said he was going to buy this and then he spent months trying to not buy it. So, I don't know--
 
HILL: Right.
 
ROMANS: What
 <br>[09:15:00]
 
his motive is from here on out. You know, he came in with a kitchen sink in that piece of video.
 
HILL: Right. Trolling his own employees.
 
ROMANS: Let this sink in. Today, he said let the good times roll.
 
HILL: Yes.
 
ROMANS: And so, he's using Twitter. He's still of course, he has blocked people from Twitter, Mr. Free Speech has blocked people from Twitter, even from people who work here.
 
HILL: Yes.
 
ROMANS: From Twitter, if he doesn't like what he sees. So, I don't know, we'll see what kind of firm it turns out to be in the end.
 
HILL: It's also - it's interesting, I think you call it a vanity project, in some ways, because well, there have been questions about that. Is this sort of - he did try to get out of the deal for a long time. Is this the bright, shiny object at the moment? And if and when Elon Musk loses interest, what does that mean? Is there a sense that this is maybe a bit of a blip for him, and then he's going to move on to something else? OREMUS: We'll see. He certainly does move from project-to-project quickly. He's running what four or five, six companies now, it's hard to keep track of exactly how many companies Elon Musk is in-charge of. This is the shiny object for him right now. I think he's going to eat - this morning, I'm going to dig in. I think he's going to put a lot of attention and focus into it at the start.
 
Once rocket start launching for SpaceX, and there's a new Tesla car coming off the line. You know, there have been some initial reports that he might install himself as the CEO, I think he's probably going to find that that's not tenable that he needs a deputy to run the company. He has that at SpaceX, as part of SpaceX's success is that he has a deputy who really keeps things going day-to-day. I think he'll eventually find that he probably needs that at Twitter if he's going to make it any kind of a success in long-term.
 
HILL: Well, Christine appreciate it. Thank you, both. Still ahead here, CNN's exclusive interview with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who acknowledges inflation is hurting Americans. Why she thinks though, we are not headed toward a recession.
 
Plus, House lawmakers may get their hands on Donald Trump's tax returns next week after ruling from a federal appeals court. Could the president though, take this all the way Supreme Court.
 
And we will continue to follow this breaking news where we're going to update you on the other side of this break on Paul Pelosi, the husband of Speaker Nancy Pelosi hospitalized as for being violently attacked according to the Speaker's office inside their San Francisco home. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:20:00]
 
HILL: We are continuing to follow this breaking news out of San Francisco. Speaker Nancy Pelosi reporting her husband Paul was attacked, violently attacked, according to a statement from her office inside their San Francisco home. He is now hospitalized. That statement from her office noting, it was early this morning, an assailant broke into the Pelosi residence in San Francisco and violently assaulted Mr. Pelosi.
 
Also notes that the assailant is in custody. The motivation for the attack is under investigation. The statement also notes the Speaker was not home at the time, and that her husband is expected to make a full recovery.
 
Key inflation measures just released this morning show prices still rising at a pretty uncomfortable level for folks. The prices consumers paid for goods and services up 6.2 percent for the year ending in September. So, new spending, earnings numbers also just released within the last hour. So, what does all of this mean? How do we translate it? This is when we turn to our good friend Rahel Solomon from CNN Business. What should we make of all these numbers and where things stand this morning, Rahel? RAHEL SOLOMON, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Erica, stop me if you've heard this before, but inflation continued to rise in the month of September. I hate to say it, but prices rose modestly 0.3 percent on a headline level. Core inflation, which strips away categories like food and energy, those prices rose about half a percent. So, on an annual basis, as you pointed out, Erica, prices are about 6.2 percent higher than they were a year ago.
 
Of course, the Fed who by the way, they actually checked this report a bit more closely than they do, some of the other inflation reports. The Fed would like that 6.2 percent number, Erica, to be a lot closer to 2 percent. That is the target. So, clearly a lot of work ahead for the Fed.
 
Now on the other hand, we also got some consumer spending data in the same report which showed consumer spending held on continuing even when adjusted for inflation was positive, which is what we saw in yesterday's GDP report too. So, yet another sign that even despite these higher prices, even despite these rising interest rates, consumers are hanging tight holding on and still spending.
 
HILL: Rahel Solomon, appreciate it. Thank you. Just ahead here, Wisconsin Senator Tammy Baldwin joins us live to discuss all things midterm, very close to Senate race in her state and also the fight to keep Democratic control of the Senate. We'll take a look too, the impact potentially a Republican majority could have. President Biden's priorities. Lots to dig into. Stick with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:25:00]
 
HILL: Disturbing news out of San Francisco in just the last hour. Paul Pelosi, the husband of the House Speaker attacked in his San Francisco home. Speaker Pelosi's office in a statement saying he will recover, but is hospitalized. The suspect is in custody according to the Speaker's office. There is no word at this hour of a possible motive. But this news, of course comes amid heightened concerns about violence in the lead up to the midterm elections, just a few weeks ago,
 
Senator Susan Collins told The New York Times, I wouldn't be surprised if a senator or House member were killed, which started with abuse of phone calls is now translating into active threats of violence and real violence.
 
Joining us now is Democratic Senator Tammy Baldwin, from the state of Wisconsin. A lot to get to in terms of the midterms. But I just want to pick up with you on this breaking news. There is no indication, it's important to point out at this moment that we know of that the Pelosi home or the Speaker's husband were specifically targeted because of political violence. But when we hear those chilling words from your colleagues across the aisle, Senator Collins over her concerns, and what we saw this morning, what is your level of concern about not only threats, but perhaps potential attacks of violence for yourself or your fellow members? SEN. TAMMY BALDWIN (D-WI): Yes, well, first I want to say that Paul Pelosi and Nancy Pelosi are in my thoughts and prayers in this very, very frightening news. And we have seen the - even before January 6th, we have seen a very ugly rhetoric that appears to incite violence and we have obviously seen political violence as we did on January 6th.</pre>
