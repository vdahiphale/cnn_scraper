JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR:  Breaking this morning, historic shifts of power. One of the world's most brutal dictatorships has been toppled. Rebel fighters in Syria are overthrowing the Assad regime. So, what does this mean for U.S. interests, including U.S. troops stationed in that country?
 
JESSICA DEAN, CNN ANCHOR:  President-elect Donald Trump laying out a sweeping list of his biggest priorities on day one of his second term. At the top, deportations, and following up on the January 6th insurrection.
 
Rapper Jay-Z calling allegations he sexually assaulted a 13-year-old girl, quote, heinous and a blackmail attempt. The disturbing accusations leveled against both him and Sean Combs in a new lawsuit.
 
I'm Jessica Dean with John Berman. Sara Sidner and Kate Bolduan are out today. This is CNN News Central.
 
BERMAN:  All right, happening now, celebrations following earth shaking developments in the Middle East in the fall of one of the world's most brutal dictators, Bashar al-Assad, in Syria. Just a short time ago, rebel forces were seen ransacking Assad's palace. Breaking overnight, Assad and his family, they arrived in Russia, granted asylum by Vladimir Putin.
 
This morning, President Biden calls Assad's stunning fall a, quote, moment of risk and historic opportunity. There is no doubt that Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah have lost a crucial ally. But the fear, as The Wall Street Journal puts it, is that it could, quote, create a dangerous vacuum with spillover effects into neighboring countries.
 
The rebel group seizing power sprouted from Islamic extremism, and their intentions this morning are murky at best.
 
We want to get right to CNN Senior International Correspondent Fred Pleitgen. He's outside the Syrian embassy in Moscow, an interesting place to be this morning. Good morning.
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, it certainly is, John. And I think some of the things that we've been hearing from the Kremlin earlier today certainly also indicates, at least, that the Russians are also very much coming to terms with the new situation. It was quite interesting, we were on a conference call earlier today with a spokesman for the Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov, and he confirmed that it was Vladimir Putin himself who made the decision to grant Bashar al-Assad and members of his family asylum here in Russia, as they put it, on humanitarian grounds. Of course, for the better part of yesterday, it was absolutely unclear where Assad was. But it was the Russians who were the first to confirm that Assad had indeed left the country.
 
The Russians also confirming that they were very much caught by surprise at how quickly the Assad regime collapsed. The spokesman for the Kremlin saying that he thinks everybody was caught off guard. But one thing that certainly seems to indicate that this new reality has set in, even among the biggest backers of Bashar al-Assad, is the fact that I'm standing in front of the Syrian embassy. And if we pan out, we can see that as of this morning, John, the flag of the Syrian opposition is flying above this building. So, this is now the embassy that is under control.
 
Well, the Syrian opposition, we were asking some folks here at the embassy earlier, and they have said that the embassy here is operating as normally. So, those operations are continuing.
 
For the Russians, of course, this is a pretty big blow to their operations inside the Middle East. We know the Russians have their main airbase in Latakia, near Latakia, in a place called Khmeimim, with which they project power, not just in the Middle East, but all the way into Western Africa as well, and, of course, a big naval port. And just last week, the Russians had big naval exercises originating from that port where they fired some really powerful missiles, not just from ships in the Mediterranean but also from on the ground in that naval port in Tartus.
 
Earlier today, on that same conference call, the Kremlin was asked what will happen to those bases. And they confirmed that they simply don't know. They say they have to see how the situation inside Syria is going to play out, who is going to be in power inside Syria. The Russians claim that they are in contact with all the armed groups on the ground in Syria as well.
 
They did say that there are forces inside Syria at this point in time are on high alert. They say the situation is calm outside their bases, but, of course, the existence, the future of Russia's military footprint inside Syria right now very much in question, John.
 <br>[07:05:02]
 
BERMAN:  Just one of the things in question this morning. Frederik Pleitgen in Moscow, and I do have to say that flag, the Syrian rebel flag, now flying over the embassy, the Syrian embassy in Moscow, just a sign of how much power and influence Russia has lost in the last, what, 72 hours in the Middle East.
 
Fred Pleitgen, our thanks to you. Jessica?
 
DEAN:  With just over a month until inauguration day, President-elect Donald Trump is laying out a sweeping plan for his first days in office. Among his biggest priorities, tackling immigration. The president-elect detailing deportation efforts and who would be targeted. Also on his immediate to do list, addressing those who took part in the January 6th insurrection and those who investigated it.
 
CNN's Alayna Treene is joining us now. Alayna, let's start first with those deportation plans. What more did we learn?
 
ALAYNA TREENE, CNN REPORTER:  Well, Jessica, we did hear him kind of doubled down on his promise to have mass deportations early on in his administration. He said that he wanted to start with trying to deport criminals who are here illegally, but then, you know, take a broader brush to kind of the entire immigration system in this country and have those mass deportations for others as well. He also said that he wanted to end birthright citizenship, something he said in his first administration but then never ended up doing, so doubled down on that as well.
 
But one of the really interesting things that he said, and we hadn't heard this on the campaign trail at all, was that he wants to figure out a way to protect DREAMERs, children who came here with their parents when they were very young and are still in the United States. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP, U.S. PRESIDENT-ELECT:  And we have to do something about the DREAMERs, because these are people that have been brought here at a very young age, and many of these are middle aged people now. They don't even speak the language of their country.
 
I will work with the Democrats on a plan, and if we can come up with a plan, but the Democrats have made it very, very difficult to do anything. Republicans are very open to the DREAMERs. The DREAMERs --
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TREENE:  Now, Jessica, Donald Trump has said something like this before in his first administration, that he wanted to do something to protect DREAMERs. But, again, he had not vowed to do this on the campaign trail.
 
And I think specifically what was interesting about this was that he wanted to work with Democrats on a plan. I'd remind you, in his first term, he did actually call and try to end DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a program that was first installed by Barack Obama, that was later struck down by the courts. But, again, this would be a big change from kind of his posture that we've heard so far.
 
And honestly, as someone who attended a lot of Donald Trump's rallies, covered him so closely over the past couple of years, this was really the most sympathetic I've heard him talk about DREAMERs and immigrants, really, this entire, throughout his entire campaign. He was saying he wanted to deport people, there were no loopholes, he wanted to get everybody out. Now, he's kind of changing his tune a little bit, and I do think that part of this is, you know, now that he is elected, he's having some of these conversations about what makes the most political sense on this issue. And we're starting to see some of the contours of that come together now.
 
DEAN:  Yes, this was very new, a very new tone. And speaking of tone, he has also shifted that on some of his opponents, but, Alayna, we heard a new threat as well.
 
TREENE:  That's right. I want to start with what he said about pardoning the January 6th -- those who were convicted for their role on January 6th in the Capitol attack. He said again that he wanted to issue those pardons. He said it would be a day one priority for him. And he kind of painted in this interview with meet the press, kind of painted it with a broad perspective. It was unclear, you know, and it's still unclear whether or not Donald Trump is going to pardon all of the people who were convicted or do this on a case by case basis.
 
When I talk to Donald Trump's team, you know, there's mixed opinions from different people. If you talk to some of the more hardline critics of what happened on January 6th, they argue that everyone should be pardoned. Others are saying it needs to be a case by case basis, especially for the people who, you know, maybe not pardoning the people who actually committed violent crimes or attacked police officers. So, that was notable.
 
And then also he said that he didn't want to seek political retribution on Joe Biden specifically, but he also left a lot of room for his different appointees, including his incoming or his pick for attorney general, Pam Bondi, as well as Kash Patel, his picked to lead the FBI, to make those decisions themselves, so something to keep an eye on as well. Jessica?
 
DEAN:  All right. Alayna Treene with the latest from West Palm Beach, Florida, thank you so much for that reporting.
 
Jay-Z responding forcefully this morning after being named in the same sexual assault lawsuit that's targeting Sean Diddy Combs. The disturbing allegations from a girl who was 13 when the alleged assault happened.
 
Plus, six days on the run now for the gunman who killed the UnitedHealthcare CEO. We still don't have a name or a murder weapon. Details on where those search efforts will focus today.
 
And there's a new highest paid player in sports. How Juan Soto just landed a $765 million deal.
 <br>[07:10:03]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
 BERMAN:  This morning, Jay-Z is denying allegations he sexually assaulted a 13 year-old-girl alongside Sean Combs at a party in 2000. He tells CNN the claims are, quote, heinous in an attempt to blackmail him and he is heartbroken for the impact on his family.
 
So, the civil lawsuit was first filed against Combs in October. It was amended Sunday to include Jay-Z.
 <br>[07:15:00]
 
Combs is in prison awaiting trial.
 
CNN's Elizabeth Wagmeister has been doing great reporting on this, is here with the very latest. Elizabeth?
 
ELIZABETH WAGMEISTER, CNN ENTERTAINMENT CORRESPONDENT:  So, as you said, John, this original suit was filed by a Jane Doe back in October. It named Celebrity A and Celebrity B. Celebrity A was said to be a male anonymous celebrity. Celebrity B was an anonymous female celebrity.
 
Now, we do not know who Celebrity B is, but now we know that that male anonymous celebrity is Jay-Z. So, Jay-Z is alleged to have raped a woman who was 13 years old, a 13-year-old girl at the time. The allegations are very graphic, but what she is alleging is that she was drugged at an after party for the video music awards, the MTV VMAs in the year 2000. She says that she felt woozy and lightheaded after having some of a drink.
 
She went into a room to lie down because she didn't feel well. And that is when she alleges that Diddy and Jay-Z and this anonymous female celebrity came in. She says that she was first raped by Jay-Z, who she alleges pinned her down. Then she says that she was raped by Combs, as Jay-Z and this female celebrity watch.
 
Now, as you said, Jay-Z is denying this, and he came out very, very strong, saying that he's actually being extorted by the alleged victim's attorney.
 
BERMAN:  You've also been in touch with -- well, you're in touch with all the teams here, Elizabeth. What are they saying?
 
WAGMEISTER:  Yes. So, Jay-Z, as I said, he came out very strong. And just to kind of put this into context, Jay-Z never talks. He never responds to anything. He wrote this statement himself. This is not something that was written by a publicist. It's very lengthy. So, I just want to read you part of what he says, quote, these allegations are so heinous in nature that I implore you to file a criminal complaint, not a civil one. Whomever would commit such a crime against a minor should be locked away. Would you not agree? These alleged victims would deserve real justice if that were the case.
 
So, there, he is talking to the attorney for the plaintiff. Tony Buzbee is his name. And Jay-Z actually filed a suit against him, claiming extortion anonymously last month.
 
Now, I want to read you another part of Jay-Z's statement where he references his family. He says, my only heartbreak is for my family. My wife and I will have to sit our children down, one of whom is at the age where her friends will surely see the press and ask questions about the nature of these claims and explain the cruelty and greed of people, of course, his wife being Beyonce. Now, I have reached out to a representative for Beyonce. She has not responded. But, again. This is very rare for Jay-Z to comment and come out and in the lawsuit it was revealed that there were efforts for mediation before Jay-Z is calling that extortion. The attorney is saying, no, we just wanted to settle it privately.
 
BERMAN:  All right. There's a lot going on here, a lot more reporting to do. Elizabeth Wagmeister, great to have you here going through this. Thank you.
 
All right, after years of talking inflation, Republicans are feeling great about the economy, but has anything really changed?

 <br>[07:20:00]
 
DEAN:  New this morning, after years of doom and gloom, President- elect Donald Trump's win has Republicans feeling great about the economy again, that is according to a new survey from the University of Michigan. Democrats, however, not feeling the same.
 
CNN's Matt Egan joins us now. Matt, walk us through what they found.
 
MATT EGAN, CNN REPORTER:  Well, Jessica, you're right. Republicans are finally feeling really good about the economy. Consumer sentiment among self-identified Republicans has spiked to the highest level since November of 2020. This is according to the first -- yes, look at this. Look at this shift. It started just a few months ago, sentiment among Republicans was really low. It was in the basement. And then the election happens and boom, right? It's like someone flipped a switch and suddenly everyone's feeling very good among Republicans. This is the first consumer sentiment survey since the election.
 
Now, obviously, not much has changed on the ground, right? Unemployment remains pretty low, cost of living pretty high. But has changed is the election. And so we've seen expectations among Republicans and Democrats completely flip. Among Republicans, expectations for the future has actually almost doubled over the last few months to very high levels.
 
But look at this. There's a massive gap between Republicans and Democrats. Among Democrats, they're feeling the most pessimistic since COVID. Think about that for a moment, again, all of this changing because of the election.
 
And we've seen divides like this before when there's changes of power in the White House, but still the scope of that divide does speak to some polarization in the country. And look at this, among Democrats, sentiment is now at the lowest level in over two years back when gas prices were at almost $5 a gallon and inflation was at a four-decade high. That's the last time sentiment among Democrats was this low. Now, I know this kind of feels like Republicans and Democrats are living on different planets, but I talked to University of Michigan economist Joanne Hsu, who runs this survey, and she told me it's not that they belong to different realities, they're looking at the same reality. They just don't agree on the implications of policies. And so Republicans, they're fired up about the Trump agenda, Democrats, not so much.
 
DEAN:  Yes. And it is interesting because not really much has changed, to your point, in the actual data. It's in the eye of the beholder.
 
Now, we know that President-elect Trump has proposed a lot of policy changes, especially when it comes to the economy. He ran on that. What are getting people the most excited?
 
EGAN:  Well, most attention is definitely far and away being paid to the trade agenda. The University of Michigan found that one in five consumers spontaneously mentioned tariffs.
 <br>[07:25:03]
 
DEAN:  That's pretty high for them to just say it, yes.
 
EGAN:  They just said it. They weren't asked about trade. They just said tariffs were on their mind. That's up from 2 percent just a few months ago. And what's also really telling is that the percentage of people who say it's a good time to buy durable goods, stuff like cars, appliances, furniture, has surged not because people are feeling better about the economy, per se, but because they're trying to get ahead of pricing that could be coming because of higher tariffs.
 
DEAN:  Oh, wow. So, they're like factoring that in already?
 
EGAN:  It's already a factor.
 
DEAN:  Okay. Matt Egan, very, very interesting stuff, thanks so much.
