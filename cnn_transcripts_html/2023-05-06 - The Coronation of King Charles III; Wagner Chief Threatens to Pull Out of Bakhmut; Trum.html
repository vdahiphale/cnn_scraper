ISA SOARES, CNN ANCHOR (voice-over): Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. It's 8:00 am. I'm Isa Soares coming to you from London and ahead on CNN NEWSROOM. 
 
The United Kingdom prepares for its first coronation in nearly 70 years. King Charles III and Camilla will be crowned at Westminster Abbey, a ceremony reaching back nearly a millennium. Reporters and guests will bring the story to you. 
 
As you can imagine this morning and it has been the last few days, anticipation is growing here, ahead of the historic crowning of King Charles III. Crowds have been gathering where the monarch will pass by. 
 
Coronation attendees will begin arriving in about two hours. Parts of the ancient ritual are being modified to reflect the modern, more diverse face of Britain. As we look at the live shot, there's now a bit of cover outside of the abbey. The weather has been somewhat temperamental. 
 
We learned about one change. That was a short time ago. The Archbishop of Canterbury will give people the option to say, "God save King Charles" rather than making the full pledge of allegiance.
 
It's been a controversy whether people should be making the pledge or not. Let's go to Nada Bashir, who's got the best job of the day, she's with the crowds along the mall. 
 
Is it starting to get busy where you are?
 
What's the mood like?
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It is getting very busy here. We've been here all morning. The crowds are piling in, waiting for a chance to see King Charles and Queen Camilla making their way to the abbey for the coronation ceremony. 
 
We've seen people here waiting for days. Some have been camping and others have come overnight. All are in a festive spirit. We have Jack here with us and granddad, Dave. You came all the way from Ireland?
 
DAVE, CORONATION WATCHER: That's right.
 
BASHIR: What time did you get in?
 
DAVE: We came last night and left at half past 5:00 this morning in a taxi. We thought there would be a few people. There's quite a few people. 
 
BASHIR: Why was it important to come?
 
DAVE: It will probably be the only coronation in my lifetime. 
 
And Jack (ph), it's your first. 
 
JACK (PH), CORONATION WATCHER: I like seeing everybody. It's the most people I've seen ever. 
 
BASHIR: Have you excited to see the king and queen?
 
JACK (PH): Very. 
 
BASHIR: And what about the rest of the day?
 
DAVE: We look forward to seeing the parade. We're not far from Buckingham Palace. That was a surprise. The fly past, hopefully. And we'll see it on TV again later. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A big family celebration on Monday. 
 
DAVE: Yes, on the island. It's nice. We don't get to London too often. 
 
BASHIR: You made it a family event. 
 
DAVE: Yes. I think a lot of people will. I'm amazed how many people were here at 6:00 this morning. 
 
BASHIR: Enjoy the rest of your day. 
 
DAVE: Thank you. 
 
BASHIR: Just here, a huge crowd of people, thousands gathering. Some here for days. We are expecting a little bit of rain. So there's that concern. But everyone seems in high spirits. Everybody is excited and waiting for the procession to go through. 
 
After the coronation ceremony, to see the king and queen return to Buckingham Palace. 
 
SOARES: They really made an effort with their faces painted. Looks fantastic. Nada Bashir, thank you very much. 
 
Let's get to more of what we can expect. Tony Juniper is with me. He's the chair of Natural England and co-wrote a children's book about climate change for the king. [02:05:00]
 
SOARES: Great to have you on the show. Good morning. I know you're going to be inside. You're going to be watching this moment, taking part in the coronation. Let's talk about the king, this new monarch. 
 
I read a headline, he's going to be the first climate king. It didn't surprise me. He was ahead of his time when it came to climate, before words like sustainability became trendy. 
 
TONY JUNIPER, CHAIR, NATURAL ENGLAND: And it's really remarkable to look back on the incredible contribution on this broad range of issues, sustainable agriculture, deforestation, the role of biodiversity and sustaining the economy, of bringing all of these things together in quite powerful ways. 
 
So things he's written and things he's launched. His contribution goes back 50 years. His first speech on environmental subjects was in December 1968. He came back to these different questions over many years. He brought people together. 
 
He raised awareness. He started different kinds of initiatives. And I think his contribution is unprecedented. And seeing the linkages between the different questions is a quite remarkable contribution he's made. 
 
SOARES: And ahead of his time. 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
JUNIPER: Exactly. In the early days in particular, it was a source of ridicule. He had to be brave to keep coming back to this, determined and convinced of his information and the conclusions he was drawing. 
 
That wasn't the case with everyone else. But he kept at it. And I think he has changed the world. And the idea of the first climate king is quite right, in the sense of him making this enormous contribution. He has a different job now so his voice will need to be different in that different role. 
 
SOARES: Voice will be different but will he continue to push for the climate change and biodiversity?
 
Do you think he'll remain pushing for that?
 
JUNIPER: It will be less pushing and more pulling, bringing people together. I was privileged to be at two events since he became king, one in November on climate change and one in February on biodiversity. 
 
Working in partnership with the British government, ministers from different parts of the world, coming together -- in the case of climate change, to try and build ambition ahead of COP27. 
 
And after the meeting in Montreal, bring ministers and leaders together to look at ways which we can deliver momentum behind the targets agreed there. He can continue to do that, I think. Those two events have taken place since he became king. And they made a huge difference.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
SOARES: G7, COP, very important. You know the man better than many of us. 
 
What is he like?
 
JUNIPER: He's charming. He's very hardworking. He's passionate. He's got a wonderful sense of humor. I certainly enjoyed all of the interactions I've had with him over the years, including working on a number of books. 
 
The most recent one came out when he was king in February, a children's book on climate change. And I think the energy he put behind that little project is another demonstration of him taking the long view. He thinks young people will have the biggest stake --
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
JUNIPER: -- in the climate change question. So equipping them with facts, figures, analysis is something he really wanted to do. 
 
SOARES: And the viewers around the world will look at the medal around your neck. You've been honored for your work. Explain what that is. 
 
JUNIPER: This is a CBE. It was granted five years ago, more or less, for services to conservation, looking after the environment. A very proud moment for me, as well. 
 
SOARES: And you have another moment as you make your way to Westminster Abbey. 
 
What are you looking forward to?
 
JUNIPER: I'm looking forward to being in this incredible moment in the history of this country. We've not had this event for over 70 years. I'm 63 this year and I've never seen this. That's a mark of how rare and how special a moment this is for the country. It will be amazing to be part of it. 
 
SOARES: It's definitely building up. Tony, appreciate it.
 
Now thousands of British troops have started to arrive at Waterloo Station where they will position themselves before taking part in a major military procession. Anna Stewart is there. 
 
This will be a day of spectacular pageantry. 
 <br>[02:10:00]
 
SOARES: I see more trains have started to arrive. 
 
ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I'm going to get out of the way so you can see. We have sailors, the Royal Navy and some Royal Marines coming through, as well. All in all, 9,000 members of the armed forces are taking part in the coronation today; largely ceremonial, 7,000 involved in a ceremonial role. 
 
It's the biggest military event since the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. It will be spectacular. It will be extraordinary. I expect many of the soldiers, sailors and aviators involved are feeling a little nervous. Not least that procession. 
 
It's not an easy route for 4,000 of the members of the armed forces to take part here. There's a sharp corner at Trafalgar Square for carriages and horses. What is special is remembering King Charles' relationship with the armed forces. 
 
With the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth, he became the commander in chief. He also has personal links with all of the armed forces. He was trained by the RAF. He served with the Royal Navy. 
 
And on being made colonel in chief of the Elite Parachute Regiment, he actually decided he wanted to go through the training of that as well so he could look soldiers in the eye. So he earned the respect of the military that he's commander of chief of. Today will be spectacular. 
 
There will be 200 in the Sovereign Escort from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Abbey. On the way back, 4,000 members of the armed forces taking that carriage, the big gold one, the less comfortable one, the state coach, back to Buckingham Palace. And (INAUDIBLE) lining the street. We got a few more trains to go. 
 
SOARES: I might be calling on you for help. We can hear the drums. It will be spectacular, I have no doubt. I hope they have very comfortable shoes. Anna, thank you very much. 
 
Charles is being crowned, not only the king of the U.K. but more than a dozen Commonwealth nations with historic ties to the British Empire. Among them is Australia, which has mixed views about the coronation. 
 
The prime minister there believes the country should have its own head of state. Today, he's being to put that aside and pledge allegiance to the king. Angus Watson is in Sydney with more. 
 
Give me a sense of how people are marking this moment. 
 
Is there a level of excitement even?
 
ANGUS WATSON, CNN PRODUCER: Well, Isa, back in 1953, when Queen Elizabeth II had her coronation, TV hadn't yet made it to Australia. So this is the first chance for Australians to really get a sense of all their traditions and those ceremonies which go into the making of a monarch that we've been discussing. 
 
Of course, one has to have a long memory to cast back to the '50s. 
 
But how will Australians connect with what they see?
 
You mentioned there is a strong Republican element to Australia right now. And for that reason, there aren't big celebrations, I'm here to say, in Sydney today. No big screen viewings. Instead, Australians will take this in from their own homes. It's expected to be highly rated. 
 
But to get a sense of what people are thinking about Australia's place in that monarchy, I've come down to Sydney Harbor and asked people for their opinions. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think it's a high time we have a strong head of state to represent us as a people as opposed to a foreign head of state. 
 
There's enough problems now without haggling over all that. I think there's enough (INAUDIBLE), there's enough stuff to do without that. But I think it's nice with all the tradition. I mean, the British love all that. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Forget about all this good things in royalty. Yes, they'll still come. But for Australians, we should be a republic, full stop. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WATSON: You mentioned the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, there. He might be one of the few people in Westminster Abbey on Saturday, who says he doesn't believe in the institution of monarchy at all. 
 
He terms himself a lifelong Republican and wants to see an Australian as head of state in this country. That said, he believes, as the leader of one of the 14 Commonwealth realms where Charles III is already king, it's his duty to go to Westminster Abbey and pledge allegiance to the king. 
 <br>[02:15:00]
 
WATSON: The politics in Australia is not so simple. We had a referendum and chose to keep the British sovereign as our head of state. Opinions have changed; the politics of that will run through his reign. 
 
SOARES: Angus Watson coming to us from Sydney there. 
 
Stay with us for the latest on the coronation of King Charles III. We'll have much more of our special coverage coming up in about 10 minutes or so. In a moment, we will check in with Paula Newton at CNN Center for some of the other news. 
 
An ultimatum to Russian brass from Wagner's leader. He says if they don't send ammunition, he will call it quits. We'll have that story for you. 
 
Plus two deadly mass shootings in as many days have left Serbia reeling. The country's president and lawmakers are vowing to take action so tragedies like this never happen again. You're watching CNN. (MUSIC PLAYING)
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
(MUSIC PLAYING) 
 
PAULA NEWTON, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT: The leader of Wagner mercenaries is raising the stakes in his very public feud with Russia's military brass. On Friday, he posted this video, lashing out at top military leaders for not sending ammunition to his forces. 
 <br>[02:20:00]
 
NEWTON: He claimed he was standing in front of the bodies of troops in, he says, tens of thousands of others were killed or wounded and, because of that, he said he had enough. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
YEVGENY PRIGOZHIN, FOUNDER, WAGNER GROUP (through translator): I am officially informing the defense minister, chief of the general staff and the supreme commander in chief that my guys will not be taking useless, unjustified losses in Bakhmut without ammunition. So on May 10, 2023, we are pulling out of Bakhmut. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NEWTON: Troops have spearheaded Russia's brutal offensive in Bakhmut for months. A Wagner pullout would be a turning point in that battle if it happens. 
 
Ukraine's first lady attended an event before the coronation. Olena Zelenska, you see her with the Princess of Wales and Jill Biden. They met at a reception for heads of state. The Ukrainian first lady began her week in Britain meeting with Ukrainian troops, on the ground in the U.K. for training. 
 
Serbia's president is calling for tougher gun control laws as the country reels from two deadly mass shootings in less than 48 hours. The president plans to hire 1,200 new police officers nationwide. 
 
And he's calling for stricter conditions to buy and keep guns and a national buyback program for those who can't meet the regulations. Police arrested a suspected gunman in the second mass shooting, after a oil and gas manhunt involving hundreds of special forces. 
 
The U.S. and Saudi Arabia have announced that Sudan's warring factions will start preliminary talks in the coming hours. Washington and Riyadh are calling for the Sudanese armed forces and their rival, paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, to engage in the talks toward a cease-fire and try to end this conflict. 
 
The fighting has killed hundreds of people and injured thousands more. A senior medical employee at a hospital in Khartoum tells CNN the paramilitary is trying to take control of hospitals to use as bases of operations. That would mean they were able to shield their forces from airstrikes.
 
 They've already reportedly seized the largest maternity hospital in that country. 
 
I will be right back with more news in a bit. Stay with us. Isa will be back from London, where the doors of Westminster Abbey are set to open for King Charles' coronation.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:25:00]
 
(MUSIC PLAYING) 
 
SOARES: Welcome back, everyone. 
 
Any moment now, authorities here in London will be opening the doors of Westminster Abbey, where King Charles III will be crowned in a few hours. Thousands of people are gathering to witness the coronation, Britain's first in some 70 years; 100 heads of state are expected to attend. 
 
Keeping a close eye on that door and arrivals will be Christina Macfarlane. 
 
We are a few minutes from the doors opening. It has a little cover in case it rains. 
 
CHRISTINA MACFARLANE, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT: That's right, a rain cover has come up over that west door. I'm keeping an eye out for the first arrivals. A few minutes from now, some 3,000 guests attending the coronation. Members of the royal family will be included. They'll be arriving around 11 o'clock. 
 
Hundreds of dignitaries and heads of state around 9:00 am. In the next few minutes, about 850 representatives from the community, that's going to be charitable organizations like the Prince's Trust, ambassadors of the Prince's Trust, organizations very close to the king and queen consort's hearts. 
 
We'll see some celebrities. I think Lionel Richie perhaps the most famous of all of them. We had a release of the official order of service overnight at midnight tonight. Nothing new exactly to update. It confirms what we know. There's no active role for either Prince Andrew or Prince Harry in the proceedings. 
 
But there's still question marks where the princes will be sitting. Prince Harry, how close he will be to the royal family. 
 
There's also been changes to the homage to the king. The Church of England had invited the general public to join in the homage to the king, in swearing allegiance to the king. Some felt it was unnecessary or ridiculous. So overnight, there's been tweaks and amendments to this. The Church of England announced this is changing, so the general
 
 public is invited to say, "God save King Charles," if they choose to. Or they can still swear allegiance to the king. It's been a controversial point here. 
 
As I say, keeping an eye out for the first arrivals over my shoulder. We're expecting them in a few minutes now. I can hear music from within the abbey. 
 <br>[02:30:00]
 
MACFARLANE: A few rehearsals going on inside. 
 
SOARES: I'll give you the heads up. But it's a celebrity moment and a solemn one. Talk us through what we should be looking out for when the coronation kicks off. 
 
MACFARLANE: It's a deeply traditional and religious service. The key points that viewers want to look for, the most symbolic part will be anointing of King Charles. He's anointed with holy water by the coronation spoon, that dates back to the 12th century. 
 
We may not see the most sacred part of that ceremony. Following that, the crown will be placed on his head, St. Edwards crown. As I said, the act of homage, we'll see Prince William step up and pay homage to his father and the Archbishop of Canterbury. 
 
Then we'll have a public declaration from the general public here. I think we're seeing the doors -- someone is standing by to open it. That's coming from inside the abbey. No one on the outside. 
 
But as I say, these sacred moments, within the service, the things to look out for. Also, the involvement of the members of royal family. We know Prince George will be in attendance. He will be actively playing a role in the service. 
 
We're also going to have the crowning of the queen consort. For the first time in 300 years, she will not be wearing a crown specially made for the coronation. She will be wearing Queen Mary's crown. So that's a break with tradition as well. But many moments to look out for, two crowns to look out for as part of this service. 
 
SOARES: Yes, one heavier than the other. 
 
If you're just joining us, welcome. It is 7:30 here in London. What we were showing you there, the inside of Westminster Abbey, where the guests can start trickling in, where Christina was. 
 
The doors are opening now, I'm being told. A historic day, a momentous day, full of tradition, as well as pageantry. People arriving early and will be sitting a few hours; security, very high at this moment. Members of the public being brought in, as well. 
 
This is something the king wanted to make more inclusive, more modern. And to show a different side, a more modern Britain. More members of the public, those who worked in the community. I met members of the Prince's Trust, young people from around the world, who will be taking part and joining. 
 
This will be joined with other politicians and members of the royal family. Historian Elizabeth Norton joins me now. 
 
We look at the images coming through, just the grandeur of Westminster Abbey. Give us a sense of how this coronation will be compared to the one that many of us don't remember, 70 years ago. 
 
ELIZABETH NORTON, ROYAL HISTORIAN: Absolutely. It's a new start. While we have the tradition, it's in Westminster Abbey, the site of coronations since 1066, there's a lot of changes as well; much more modernized. And the king was key to make it a more modern coronation. 
 
He has a smaller number of guests. His mother had over 8,000 guests in the abbey. The king only has around 2,000 guests. But the makeup of the guests is different. Many of the peers, the noblemen not invited. 
 
SOARES: Some are not very happy about all about it. 
 
NORTON: Particularly those told that they couldn't wear their coronation robes -- 
 
SOARES: They're quite heavy. 
 
NORTON: They are. There's been a backtracking on that. 
 
SOARES: I'm going to interrupt you. Talk where we can see, the two chairs there. 
 
Can you see the detail of the chairs?
 <br>[02:35:00]
 
SOARES: These are very old chairs. Some of them have been worked on for many, many years, the significance of this moment. 
 
NORTON: Absolutely. The chairs are hugely important. We think of Edward's throne that dates to the 13th century. It's really ancient. But the embroidery work, the chairs; some of the crown jewels aren't as old as you would think. 
 
The civil war in Britain in the 17th century and a lot of the crown jewels were melted down. So the crown is a 17th century crown from 1661. The oldest crown jewel is the spoon that will anoint him with the holy oil. That dates to the 12th century. 
 
SOARES: For many, 70 years ago, TV was black and white. 
 
Now in the age of social media, how different do you think this will feel?
 
NORTON: It will be very different. And there was such opposition to televising the coronation 70 years ago. 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
SOARES: Why?
 
NORTON: Because it's a religious service. It's about as holy a service as you can get. The late queen was actually against the televising the coronation. It was Prince Philip who said you have to do it. 
 
Now there's no way. People are out with the cameras and phones, taking pictures and videos. But it was seen as a real taboo to film the coronation in the '50s. 
 
SOARES: The crowds will fill this whole area. 
 
In terms of what the ceremony will mean, in terms of what the monarchy stands for, is that being translated in the actual ceremony?
 
NORTON: They are slightly hamstrung by what they have to include. It's a religious ceremony, a Protestant religious ceremony. Although the king is a devout Protestant, it rather goes against how he sees his role as the defender of the faith and the head of the Church of England. He wants all of the faiths involved. 
 
SOARES: We have that, a lot of faith leaders involved. 
 
NORTON: Absolutely, so it's a departure from earlier ceremonies and earlier coronations. The king has to swear an oath by law to uphold the Church of England but he sees himself as a multifaith monarch. 
 
And we have the chief rabbi. Allowances have been made to allow him to keep the Sabbath and still attend the coronation. We have representatives from the Muslim faith and of Hinduism, of Sikhism. We have representatives of the Orthodox Church and something that isn't surprising now but would have been surprising 70 years ago, representatives of the Catholic Church. 
 
SOARES: What is the moment you're looking forward to seeing?
 
NORTON: I'm looking forward to seeing the crown jewels, seeing the king actually crowned. The moment that the crown goes on his head is an important moment. It's the only time he'll wear that crown. It's then removed and taken back to Tower of London. 
 
He'll then wear the imperial state crown going forward. So that's a special moment. It goes back to 1,000 years of history. It was created in 1661. But I'm also looking forward to the multifaith elements. It's so important to see the different communities. In the most recent census, England and Wales was 46 percent Christian. 
 
So to bring in the other faiths is really important. 
 
SOARES: Appreciate it very much. 
 
You can hear the cleaning of the streets, of course. They want to make sure it looks immaculate, last minute preparations. The band is already out. Anna talking about how many of them have been arriving in Waterloo. 
 
The music has started. Going to be a day of spectacular pageantry, as you would expect. We will see history in the making there. Big Ben lining the streets (sic) as the troops go past Westminster Bridge and the Houses of Parliament. 
 
Charles is not only king of U.K. but also of Canada, Australia and several other countries in the Commonwealth. 
 
How are people across the world making the coronation and marking it?
 <br>[02:40:00]
 
SOARES: Let's bring in Stephanie Busari, who's live for us in Lagos, Nigeria. 
 
How are they marking this?
 
STEPHANIE BUSARI, CNN SENIOR AFRICA EDITOR: Good morning, Isa. A celebration in England but celebrations are muted, if at all, here on the continent. It's a normal day, just like any other in Lagos. 
 
There's a sense that the British monarchy is not really relevant to the lives of Africans and particularly young people; 70 percent of people here in sub-Saharan Africa are under 30. 
 
And there just a sense, a growing disconnect between these populations and the monarchy. There's not a lot of relevance to their lives. 
 
We have a Nigerian artist performing at the coronation. She's very popular here. Besides that, people aren't that interested. They're just going about their daily lives. There's more pressing issues they have to get on with. 
 
For them, it's a great day for England but not really something I have to concern myself with. Of course, some African leaders are attending, Cyril Ramaphosa alongside other high profile African leaders. Beyond the political and diplomatic ties, there's a sense it's a day like any other here. 
 
SOARES: Great to see you, Stephanie. Thank you very much. 
 
We have police already lining up here, if our cameraman can see that. If you look right over my right shoulder on the balcony, they opened the doors and they are getting everything in order. 
 
The room leading up to the balcony, there's been some building work being done. So not sure what that will mean in terms of the number of people that see the coronation. But they have opened the doors. They're starting to clear the way. 
 
We'll probably see more decorations being put up. We'll keep an eye on the balcony. But that's the iconic shot that everyone will look for. People will be streaming outside Buckingham Palace to catch that moment of King Charles, hopefully, with a flypast going past. Hopefully, the weather holds. 
 
Much more coronation coverage in a bit. Paula Newton has more after this break, including developments in Georgia's criminal investigation to former president Donald Trump's efforts to overturn 2020 election results in the state. 
 
And then portions of Trump's video deposition made public in E. Jean Carroll's lawsuit against him. Those stories and more after this short break.

NEWTON: Some new developments in the criminal investigation into former U.S. president Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election in the state of Georgia. 
 
Now Fulton County district attorney Fani Willis has offered immunity deals to several Republicans who served as pro-Trump, quote, "fake electors." They were allegedly planning to block certification of Georgia's vote. At least eight of them have accepted immunity. The rest face legal exposure. 
 
The DA said she will charge Trump and his allies between July 11th and September 1st. Portions of his video deposition from E. Jean Carroll's civil lawsuit are public. He is being accused of battery and defamation from an incident in the '90s. 
 
The tapes have been played in front of the jury. Trump has denied allegations, saying that Carroll was, "not his type." At one point, as he answers questions from Carroll's lawyers, Trump mistakes an old photo of Carroll for his second wife, Marla Maples. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: I don't know who the woman -- let's see. It's Marla. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You say Marla is in the photo?
 
TRUMP: That's my wife. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That's Carroll. 
 
The person you pointed to is E. Jean Carroll. 
 
TRUMP: Who is that?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And the woman on the right is your then-wife. 
 
TRUMP: This is the picture. I assume that's -- is that Carroll?
 
It's very blurry. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) NEWTON: Both sides rested their cases. If Trump does not take the stand, these tapes will be the only direct testimony the jury hears from him. 
 
The U.S. Secretary of Transportation says the country's air traffic control system is understaffed. They are short by about 3,000 controllers. An effort is underway to hire about 1,500 air travel controllers. More left the job than the FAA had anticipated. 
 
You'll want to stay with us. We have live coverage of the coronation. It continues with Isa Soares in London when we come back.

SOARES: Now umbrellas and raincoats will be the order of coronation day. The forecast is calling for plenty of showers and thunderstorms. Workers covered the walkway leading to Westminster Abbey to protect the guests going in. 
 
(WEATHER REPORT)
 <br>[02:55:00]
 
SOARES: We told you we showed the balcony doors being opened in the last 10 minutes. If you look over my right shoulder, you can see that gorgeous, deep red drape hanging from the balcony, preparation for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip, Princess -- Prince Charles, Princess Anne, Princess Margaret, the queen mother all there. 
 
The monarch will greet the crowds where we'll see that six-minute fly past from the army, the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force. That's a moment. 
 
I'm Isa Soares. Thank you for your company. I'll be back with more coverage of the coronation of King Charles III right after this very short break. Very good morning to you.</pre>
