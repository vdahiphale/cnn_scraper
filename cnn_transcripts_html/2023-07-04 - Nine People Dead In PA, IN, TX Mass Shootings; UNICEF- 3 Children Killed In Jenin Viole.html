BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: Gunfire interrupting the holiday festivities with dozens of victims across the country and children among the dead. The nation marking 247 years of independence and this tragic number as well, a number of shootings - mass shootings so far this year.
 
JIM SCIUTTO, CNN HOST: Plus, developments in the Middle East. The Israeli military now says it is withdrawing from a refugee camp in the West Bank. This as new violence has erupted as far as Tel Aviv. We're going to have the latest.
 
BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN HOST: And I'm pretty sure it's the first rule of spin, you don't admit when you're down. But that's exactly what someone in Ron DeSantis' camp just did. He's on the campaign trail today alongside other Republican hopefuls. We're going to take you to New Hampshire and Iowa as we follow these major developing stories and many more all coming in right here to CNN NEWS CENTRAL.
 
KEILAR: On this Fourth of July, three American cities are dealing with the aftermath of a mass shooting. In Philadelphia, five people are dead and two children injured after a neighborhood shooting spree.
 
Authorities arrested a suspect that they say had an AR-15-style rifle, a handgun and was equipped wearing a bulletproof vest. City officials are expected to reveal more details here in just a few minutes at a news conference and we were expecting an update on this tragedy from the mayor from that in moments.
 
In Indianapolis at least one person is dead, four others injured after shots were fired at a block party last night. And then in Fort Worth, Texas, just before midnight, three people were killed. Eight were injured in a shooting that police believe was related to a Fourth of July celebration.
 
CNN's Ed Lavandera is live for us in Fort Worth. Ed, are you hearing anything more about a suspect in this particular case?
 
ED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: So far, no word from Fort Worth investigators as they tried to find out who was responsible for this shooting that wounded eight people and killed three others, all of this unfolding here. And this intersection today really kind of speaks to the polar extremes that so many communities across the country are dealing with.
 
About 15 hours ago, this mass shooting here where three people were killed. This was a spot where one of the victims died, the flowers there for an 18-year-old victim. We spoke with his mother who described it was a young man who was a manager of a local McDonald's and was trying to enlist in the Air Force.
 
And then just a few hours ago, Brianna, here in this very spot, there was a normal Fourth of July parade with horses and vintage cars coming up and down the pathway, families lining the streets. But last night it was just chaotic out here. Hundreds of people jammed into the street, cars spinning out in the intersections, fireworks going off.
 
And one witness said, it quickly started to turn and became a much more tense situation when the gunfire erupted.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MIKE VALLE, WITNESS: Everybody was just having fun and then you just heard gunfire and everybody started running away.
 
LAVANDERA: And what did you do?
 
VALLE: Like, I went to the other side of the street, just trying to like find cover, like trying to find my people that I was with, like make sure nobody else got hurt that I was with.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[15:05:00]
 
LAVANDERA: Now, this neighborhood here in southwest Fort Worth has dealt with this on this particular holiday before. Two years ago, the night before July 4th, many people gathered out here just the exact same way, an argument erupted. Gunfire erupted as well. Eight people were wounded back - two years ago.
 
So some witnesses we talked to say this has been a source of growing concern as the festivities the night before July 4th has become kind of a popular thing. But it has become also a much more dangerous event taking place in this particular neighborhood. Brianna?
 
KEILAR: Yes. And then that Philadelphia shooting, Ed, are police explaining how that unfolded?
 
LAVANDERA: But it's a very different situation there. It sounds like a much more premeditated attack. Philadelphia authorities are saying that this suspect who was a 40-year-old man, he was using an AR-style assault rifle, killing five people in a crime scene that they described several locations spanning several neighborhood blocks. When they - police say they were able to chase the suspect down in an alley and cornered him and that's where he's been - he was arrested. We're still waiting to see what kind of criminal charges will be filed against that suspect.
 
But clearly, a much greater sense of premeditation, some deeper motive going on there, perhaps, than what we're seeing here in Fort Worth. But at the end of the day, there are still a number of families grieving on this national holiday.
 
KEILAR: All right. Ed Lavandera live for us in Fort Worth, Texas, thank you so much. And we are still awaiting that press conference in Philadelphia where we are expected - expecting to learn more. We're taking live pictures right now. We'll bring that to you as soon as possible. We'll get an update on the shooting that killed five people in Philadelphia. Jim?
 
SCIUTTO: Well as we wait for news at home there in Philly, now to news in the outbreak of violence in the Middle East.
 
Israeli defense forces now say they are leaving Jenin in the occupied West Bank. This comes two days - after two days of what they call counterterrorism activities in the city. But we are getting disturbing images of the aftermath of those operations, including allegations of many civilians injured, a Palestinian father crying over the body of his young son who was killed. You could see there just how small he was during an Israeli raid.
 
Moments ago, UNICEF said that at least three children were killed. Many more injured during clashes in Jenin and that Israeli operation.
 
CNN's Hadas Gold is live in Jerusalem.
 
Hadas, I wonder as we see not just accounts but also images like that of what appears to be a child killed in these attacks - please hold off, Hadas, we're going to go, because we have an update here in Philadelphia. This is a press conference, an update on the shooting there. Let's listen in.
 
MAYOR JIM KENNEY (D) PHILADELPHIA: Well, good afternoon, everyone. I'm heartbroken for the families who lost loved ones and for all the neighbors traumatized in the wake of this shocking and disturbing incident. Philadelphia mourns with you.
 
I want to thank Commissioner Outlaw and the police department for their response to this terrible tragic incident. Police responded immediately and courageously getting victims to the hospital and successfully apprehending the armed suspect in a short amount of time, likely preventing more deaths.
 
And may I say that scene must have been chaotic. They were taking active fire, scooping people up, getting - to try and get them to the hospital to save them and our officers deserve our great debt of gratitude for their courage and for their commitment to Philadelphians.
 
I'm frustrated and outraged that mass shootings like this continue to happen in communities across the United States. This country needs to reexamine its conscience and find out how to get guns out of dangerous people's hands. A person walking down city street with an AR-style rifle and shooting randomly at people while wearing a bulletproof vest with multiple magazines is a disgraceful but all too common situation in America. And I was today at city - at Independence Hall where they wrote that constitution and the Second Amendment was never intended to protect this. This was a terrible tragic situation that has traumatized the community. We are begging Congress to protect lives and do something about America's gun problem.
 
I'll now turn it over to Police Commissioner Outlaw for updates on this incident.
 
DANIELLE OUTLAW, PHILADELPHIA POLICE COMMISSIONER: Good afternoon. Thank you Mr. Mayor.
 
First and foremost, I would like to express my deepest condolences to the families, friends and all of those affected by this senseless act of violence. Our hearts go out to them during this unimaginably difficult time.
 
Everyone you see here today and not here in this room is committed to finding answers to what happened last night and seeking justice for the victims and their families. As the investigation into this tragic incident continues, I kindly ask for your patience and your understanding.
 
Our investigators are working tirelessly to gather and analyze all available evidence ensuring a thorough and comprehensive investigation.
 <br>[15:10:07]
 
It is crucial that we allow them the time and resources necessary to uncover the truth which includes the why. That said, let me be crystal clear. What happened last night in our concession neighborhood was unimaginably disgusting, and horrifying. On what was supposed to be a beautiful summer evening, armed and armored individual wreaked havoc, firing with a rifle after victims seemingly at random. Shooting seven, killing five, including children, babies.
 
Such an act of violence is abhorrent and goes against everything we stand for in this community. I too would like to take a moment to recognize the valor of our courageous officers the actions of our 12 district officers and supervisors last night. These officers swiftly and immediately responded to a radio call reporting a person with a gun and an active shooting situation in the 1600 block of South 56th Street.
 
While tending to victims at that location, they heard multiple gunshots at the intersection of 56th Street and Kingsessing Avenue. Some of the responding officers properly tended to the wounded and rushed them to an area hospital while others fearlessly ran toward the sounds of gunfire Are. With remarkable bravery and determination, they pursued the suspect on foot, as they fled from Kingsessing Avenue onto Fraser Street, all while they continue to discharge their weapon.
 
The officers persisted in their pursuit along Fraser Street and successfully apprehended the suspect in the rear alley of 1600 Fraser Street without any further incident or injury. Again, I commend these officers for their unwavering bravery. Their swift actions undoubtedly saved additional lives.
 
At this time, I want to emphasize that we currently have no reason to believe that there are additional suspects or an ongoing threat to the community as it relates to this incident. We're confident that we have the individual responsible in custody. However, we do ask for your continued patience and cooperation, as I've mentioned before, as we meticulously piece together the events leading up to this heinous act.
 
I want to assure the public that the Philadelphia Police Department is fully committed to ensuring the safety and security of our communities. We will exhaust all efforts in our pursuit of justice for the victims, the families, and the neighborhood.
 
In closing, I want to express our gratitude for the support and understanding of the public and the media during this challenging time. Your cooperation is essential as we worked alongside our law enforcement partners to uncover the facts and provide some semblance of closure to this devastating event. Please continue to keep everyone involved in this and affected by this uplifted in prayer.
 
Now, I'd like to invite Staff Inspector, Ernest Ransom, the commanding officer of our homicide unit to provide the case details as we currently know them.
 
Staff Inspector?
 
ERNEST RANSOM, STAFF INSPECTOR, PHILADELPHIA POLICE: Thank you, Commissioner. So good afternoon.
 
So yesterday evening approximately 8:28 pm, officers from the 12 District sponsor radio call person with a gun shooting at 1600 south 56th Street. Officers then located multiple shooting victims at several locations. They were suffering multiple gunshots to the body.
 
Six shooting victims were transported to Penn Presbyterian Medical Center where four the victims were pronounced dead. Two of the victims are currently listed in stable condition. Two additional juveniles are treated in area hospital, one suffering from a gunshot wound to the leg, the other sustained injuries to the eyes, caused by shattered glass. Those individuals again are in stable condition.
 
All right. Based on our witnesses, interviews and recovered video, the suspect while wearing body armor, a ski mask and holding AR-15 assault rifle was observed at several locations near 56th street near Chester Avenue and Springfield Avenue. The suspect then began shooting aimlessly at occupied vehicles and individuals on the street as they walked.
 
The suspect fired at a vehicle that's being operated by a mother who was driving her two - her set of twins home. One of the twins suffered a gunshot wound to the leg, their sibling sustained a gunshot - sorry, sustained injuries to the eyes from shattered glass.
 
So while assisting shooting victims, officers heard multiple gunshots in the area and observed the suspect. After a brief foot pursuit, officers made contact with the suspect in the rear alleyway of Springfield Avenue.
 <br>[15:15:06]
 
Officers engaged that suspect where he was - where they were able to apprehend the suspect without incident. Officers were able to locate a nine millimeter handgun and an AR-15-style assault rifle. None of the victims engaged the suspect or were aware of the suspect was going to inflict this act of violence upon them.
 
We believe that ceased victim at the location inside of 1600 South 56th Street was the first shooting victim. However, due to the victim being home alone, the victim was not discovered by family members two hours after the incident.
 
Our deceased, again, is Lashyd Merritt, a 20-year-old male; a Dymir Stanton, a 29-year-old male, a Ralph Moralis, a 59-year-old male; a Daujan Brown, a 15-year-old male; and a Joseph Wamah Jr., a 31-year- old make.
 
The investigation again is currently being reviewed by the district attorney's office. The suspect as of now has not been charged. We do expect charges to become - forthcoming. Sir. I will now turn it over to the District Attorney Krasner. Sir?
 
LARRY KRASNER, PHILADELPHIA DISTRICT ATTORNEY: Good afternoon. I want to echo and support all the comments that you have heard from the Mayor, the Police Commissioner and the more specific comments about the investigation itself. I agree with every bit of it and I don't want to repeat it. But there are a couple of things I do want to say.
 
First of all, there are different things that a prosecutor's office does in situation like this. And the first thing that we do, at the same time as we're providing whatever assistance is needed to law enforcement in its investigation, is we try to make sure victims, survivors, witnesses and other people traumatized by an absolute nightmare happening on the street have their needs addressed.
 
And make no mistake, what the police officers went through out there, a couple of whom I spoke with just this morning when I was out there having to scoop injured or dying people into a vehicle at a time when there are shots going off everywhere, when they have no way to protect their own backs, having to do that is rough. Having to do it all night is rough. Getting two hours asleep and then being back out there this morning is rough.
 
There's a lot of people who had a very, very hard time last night. But our first step is that is to reach out to those who have been affected. And for that reason, we are happy that there are 58 people who work in the DA's office on victim witness issues, including the grant funded cares team, the purpose of which is to deal with the families of homicide victims intensively for the first 45 days.
 
All of them have been deployed, with the single exception of the 15- year-old victim who was not identified until recently. We have been in contact with every single family trying to do whatever we can to support them and there is so much support that they need at this phase.
 
We will continue to work with them but also worked with a community that is deeply, deeply affected by what happened out there. I can tell you what I saw this morning, what I saw this morning on a beautiful July 4th when the temperature wasn't too hot, this morning there were little sprinkles, but it was otherwise a beautiful day was completely empty streets.
 
I saw every porch empty, I saw every door closed. I saw every curtain where there was a curtain pulled, I saw no kids playing, I saw a bicycle that had been left there from the time of the shooting, sitting on a corner untouched, apparently untouched for 12 or more hours. Nobody coming out to move it, to take it, to touch it or anything else as if everybody understood what happened here was so horrible that for right now this is a desert. And for right now, everything that we associate with celebrating Fourth of July is off.
 
That was step one for us.
 
Step Two for us is the charging. I've been in close contact with the head of our homicide non-fatal shooting unit with the very experienced attorney who is assigned to this case. We are well aware of a lot of investigative details that we are not in a position to put out here and will not put out here.
 
But I can tell you this, the man who did this is in custody. The man who did this will be facing multiple counts of murder and will also be facing multiple counts of aggravated assault as a first degree felony, weapons charges among others. We will be able to be more specific tomorrow.
 
It is expected that the preliminary arraignment which is the first public event, in a case like this, where bail will be set at - held without bail.
 <br>[15:20:07]
 
In other words, this is a person who is never going to leave jail before the trial and it is my expectation is never going to leave jail period. But the first public event will be occurring tomorrow, either during the work day in the morning or possibly later in the afternoon, depending upon the demands that are placed upon this queue by which people come up for the arraignment. At that time, it will be possible to say more publicly, although not everything.
 
Understand we are in a situation where some of the detectives working hardest on this did not sleep all night. And I know this, because I need to have a really well written affidavit of probable cause for the purpose here and I am well aware that the detective who was working on that, I'll keep his name out of it, hadn't get some sleep. He'd been up without any kind of rest all night and he was out there this morning again, but he needed a few hours sleep so he could write the best affidavit you can write because that's what we need to prosecute a case properly.
 
So phase one for us was really to reach out and try to support all those so adversely affected. Phase two is the beginning of a vigorous criminal prosecution of a truly atrocious, horrific act. It will either be prosecuted by this office or possibly by the feds. If so, they will have our complete cooperation as they always do and we always look forward to working with them jointly.
 
Finally, I just want to say this. It is disgusting. The lack of proper gun legislation that we have in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. I cannot agree more heartily with the Mayor, it is disgusting, that you can go to New Jersey and find a whole list of reasonable gun regulation that we don't have, that you can go to Delaware and there's almost as long a list of reasonable gun legislation that we don't have.
 
Some of that legislation might have made a difference here. And it is time for everybody in our legislature, including the ones who would like to walk around with an AR-15 lapel pin. It is time for every one of them to face the voters. And if they're not going to do something, then voters are going to have to vote them out because that's what that lapel pin means.
 
It means vote me out. I am against you and I am against your safety. And a lot of us have had enough of that. I can tell you I certainly have had enough of it. I would ask everyone. I know how painful this is, how emotional it is, everyone who is there, we intend to help you any way we can, we know the police department does, we know the city does. We intend to help you any way we can.
 
Please do not think in terms of any kind of violent response. Please do not think in terms of anything other than peace on the streets. The man who has done this horrible thing is in a jail cell, he's going to stay there. You cannot get to him to hurt him. So please do not hurt anyone else. Thank you.
 
OUTLAW: I think we have time for a couple of questions.
 
SCIUTTO: We've been listening to an update there from Philadelphia. That was the district attorney, Larry Krasner. Speaking prior to that, the Mayor of Philadelphia, Jim Kenney, also the Police Commissioner, Danielle Outlaw.
 
A couple updates, they said we should expect more details on the investigation tomorrow. In fact, the DA is saying the likelihood of multiple counts of murder, multiple counts of aggravated assault against the suspect here. The DA also saying it is unlikely that that suspect will have the opportunity to be released on bail.
 
We got some new details on the shooting, including this alarming one that among the victims, two twins, the shooter confronted a mother driving her two twins home. Both of them were shot and wounded among the five people killed in the shooting here.
 
And you heard an impassioned comment there as well from the DA calling the shooting disgusting. As well as the use of an AR-15 here and talking about laws in Pennsylvania that exist in neighboring states that did not exist in Pennsylvania that the DA's has might have been prevented something like this. The Mayor said as well that a person walking down the city street with an AR-style rifle and shooting randomly at people while wearing a bulletproof vest with multiple magazines is a disgraceful but all too common situation in America. As you've been watching the show prior, this is not the only mass shooting to take place in this country in the last 24 hours as the country celebrates July 4th.
 
We're going to continue to continue to stay on top of this and other stories. We will be right back. This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL.
 <br>[15:25:01]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[15:29:06]
 
SANCHEZ: Now to some major developments unfolding right now in the Middle East, Israeli defense forces say they are beginning to leave Jenin and the occupied West Bank after two days of what they call counterterrorism activities there. At least 10 people were killed in the operations. Three of them, according to UNICEF, were children.
 
I want to get right to CNN's Hadas Gold who's live for us in Jerusalem.
 
So Hadas, what more are military officials saying about Operation Home and Garden?
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT: So we are just hearing from the Israeli military that they are starting to leave Jenin, specifically the refugee camp but that this operation is not totally over. Actually, the IDF chief spokesperson was just on CNN International saying that they do expect this to wind down in the next few hours. But we are still getting reports of active clashes going on in the refugee camp.
