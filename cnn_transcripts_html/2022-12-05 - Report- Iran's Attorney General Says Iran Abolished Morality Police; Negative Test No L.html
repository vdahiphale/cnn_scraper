LAILA HARRAK, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Welcome to all of our viewers watching from around the world. I'm Laila Harrak. 
 <br>[00:00:38]
 
Ahead on CNN NEWSROOM, France fans are ecstatic as the defending World Cup champions advance to the quarterfinals, setting up a showdown with the three lions of England. 
 
Iran's attorney general reportedly announces a review of the hijab law and the Morality Police. We'll discuss what it could mean for Iranian women and the protestors. 
 
And almost 2,000 people are evacuating their homes in Indonesia after Mount Semeru's volcanic eruption.
 
ANNOUNCER: Live from CNN Center, this is CNN NEWSROOM, with Laila Harrak.
 
HARRAK: Nearly three months into the protests that have rocked Iran, a pro-reform outlet says an Iranian official has announced a review of the hijab law that requires women to cover their heads.

(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK: The announcement, likely aimed at quieting anti-government demonstrations that have swept Iran since the death of Mahsa Amini, in mid-September.
 
Well, the reform group quotes the attorney general, saying Iran's parliament and judiciary, are reviewing the law which came into effect after the Islamic Revolution in 1979. 
 
He's also quoted as saying Iran has abolished its so-called Morality Police, tasked with enforcing the dress code. However, Iranian state media insists the interior ministry controls that force, not the judiciary. 
 
Even if the attorney general's remarks are confirmed, it's unclear what might change. And there are no guarantees that protest would stop. 
 
For more, I want to bring in Negar Mortazavi, an Iranian-American journalist and host of the Iran podcast. So, she joins me now from Washington, D.C. 
 
What exactly do we know about what was said and what it means? 
 
NEGAR MORTAZAVI, JOURNALIST: So, the attorney general is a high person Iran's judiciary system was asked about why, essentially, the forced hijab is not being enforced. And the response seems to be him saying that the Morality Police is no longer existing. 
 
But, in a way, it has been interpreted as a play on words. Because, essentially, he's saying that there is no Morality Police or gast-e ersad, quote unquote, literally the Guidance Patrol.
 
But that it has been replaced, or in a way re-branded as the police of public safety. And so, with the way Iranians in the country -- and I spoke to some journalists on the ground today -- are interpreting it as, one, a rebranding of the force that's enforcing the mandatory hijab law. 
 
And two, the enforcement of the hijab law in different ways. For example, fines for business, business closures, as we're hearing reports; arrests of celebrities; warning messages that women continue to receive, but the famous or infamous Morality Police brands and their vans, the notorious vans, haven't been seen much on the streets. 
 
So, that seems to be the core of what that Q&amp;A was with that official. 
 
HARRAK: All right, so a little more complicated and diffused than we initially made out. So is this a potential retreat by the government? Or is it just window dressing, as critics are suggesting? What do you make of it? 
 
MORTAZAVI: Well, it's a combination of both. And essential, what one lawyer was saying is that the Morality Police has become so notorious and so -- such a bad name that no official is willing to take responsibility for. Essentially, this official claiming that it has been disbanded. 
 
But what's important is that the law of the mandatory hijab, which goes back to early 1980s on paper, has not changed. And that the enforcement of this law has continued even over the past three months in some shape or form.
 
But yet, women and these protesters on the street have been able to push back the limits that have already been pushed back in the past four decades. And we see a lot of images, photos, videos of women in public places walking around without the hijab much more than what we've seen before September of this year. So in a way, there has been a big leap, with this push by the
 
 protestors in the society, but how sustainable, that's going to be long-term. It's still unclear, because it goes back to how this enforcement of this law that's   still on paper is going to be stopped or changed. Or, is it just going to come back under different brand or a different name or a different method? 
 
HARRAK: So, if the government, in Iran, was contemplating real change or changing kind of the rules, who would make that decision? 
 
MORTAZAVI: Well, the decision goes to the top echelons of power, essentially, the supreme leader who can signal changes. But when it comes to this law in the Iranian political system, that kind of (ph) meant the lawmakers are the ones who have to go in and look at this four-decade law an attempt to change it. 
 
But right now, their running Parliament has been in control since the past two years, has been in control of the conservative hardline party, fractions of the Iranian political structure. 
 
And also, the president himself, who was elected last year in a controversial election is a top hard-liner conservative, and he actually vowed to crack down more and enforce more of this mandatory hijab law, and in fact, we saw an increase in the violence of the Morality Police.
 
So there's been a constant push and pull in the resistance from the women, from the protesters that continues to this day. And it became this watershed moment when Mahsa Amini was died, or killed, essentially, in custody of the Morality Police. 
 
HARRAK: So, as far as you're able to gather, how much disquiet is there among the highest echelons of the Iranian leadership about the authorities' inability to control the unrest that has now roiled the country, with no sign of letting up? 
 
MORTAZAVI: Well, we've definitely seen cracks. We're hearing very, very  unprecedented debates and national conversation that some show that cracks within the political structure, even on national television, on state television. We've seen, we've heard very controversial comments and statements by some who have -- currently members of Parliament or former government officials, essentially telling the core, the hardline core conservatives, that this -- this can't continue.
 
A top performance political party a couple of months ago came out with this unprecedented statement, essentially asking for complete dismantling of the Morality Police and a change in the mandatory hijab law. 
 
But how much is that core -- core of the power going to listen, how much concession they're willing to make. We haven't seen much of that. It's been very rigid. They're trying to blame the protests on foreign powers on tribal countries, on Western foes and not really listening to the demands and the grievances of the protesters and really meeting them with brutal violence. HARRAK: Negar Mortazavi, thank you very much for joining us. 
 
MORTAZAVI: Thanks for having me. 
 
HARRAK: And the U.S. is standing firm on the rights of Iranians to protest, but critics say it has soft-peddled support for people in China demonstrating against the government's harsh zero-COVID policy. 
 
CNN's Jake Tapper asked the U.S. secretary of state if the Biden administration supports the protesters in China. Take a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Of course we do. We support the right of people everywhere, whether it's in China, whether it's Iran, whether it's anyplace else, to protest peacefully, to make known their views, to vent their frustrations. 
 
This is about people in both countries trying to express their views, trying to have their aspirations met, and the response of the governments who are taking to that. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK: Well, the protesters in China appear to be getting some results. Multiple cities loosened COVID restrictions over the weekend. Residents of Shanghai no longer need a negative test to enter outdoor venues, including parks and scenic attractions. 
 
Shanghai and other cities also no longer require a negative test to ride public transportation, but many restrictions still remain, including at malls and office buildings in Beijing. 
 
And CNN's Steven Jiang joins me now, live, from Beijing. Some easing of the restrictions, but what is the situation across the nation? 
 
STEVEN JIANG, CNN BEIJING BUREAU CHIEF: Yes, as you mentioned authorities across the country have announced a series of more relaxed COVID protocols in their jurisdictions. You mentioned some of that, mainly getting rid of that requirement to show a negative COVID test result from within 48 hours to take public transportation but also into hospitals and many outdoor venues, as you mentioned. 
 
And another vote change we have seen in many locations is people no longer have to register their names to buy fever medication or antibiotics. 
 
But here's the thing. The problem is, as you mentioned, a lot of indoor public venues still require that test result, and that, of course, includes office buildings and shopping malls and obviously going to work and doing grocery shoppings around the two most basic daily tasks for many people. 
 <br>[00:10:06]
 
Not to mention in many locations, authorities have suddenly removed or closed testing kiosks, so forcing people to really line up for hours and remain in locations often in inclement weather, like heavy rain, or even snow storms. So that has become the new complaint. 
 
That lack of clarity or consistency is really increasing their problem, because across the country, we are also seeing some holdouts in terms of local governments sticking to their current restrictive COVID protocols, with one town in Henan (ph) province, for example, telling its residents working out of town not to come back for the lunar new year holiday. And that is not until late January. 
 
So that is increasingly, of course, making travel domestically very much a challenge, as well. But I think all of that is perhaps not surprising, given the centralized -- highly centralized political system we have here. 
 
So a lot of local officials are obviously waiting to hear from the top leadership, especially Xi Jinping himself, who has not addressed the domestic audience on this issue, despite that rather surprising revelation that he told the visiting European Council president last Thursday that recent protests were mainly by students and other young people because of their frustration after three years of COVID -- Laila. 
 
HARRAK: Steven Jiang reporting, Thank you very much. 
 
In Sunday's World Cup action, defending champions France gave their fans something to celebrate. 
 
France defeated Poland 3 to 1, booking their place in the quarterfinals. One fan who traveled all the way from Paris expressed the high expectations for this team. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
THOMAS MERLIN, FRENCH FAN (through translator): Our chances to go to the finals? We are headed to the finals. We will. We will win, just like in 2018, world champions. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK: Well, Olivier Giroud, who managed to get his 52nd career goal in a French uniform, making him his country's all-time leading scorer. 
 
And 23-year-old superstar Kylian Mbappe scored two goals, putting him at five overall, on the lead now for the Golden Boot. He also broke Brazil legend Pele's record for scoring nine World Cup goals before his 24th birthday. 
 
After the match, he told reporters, he wasn't in this World Cup for the goals. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KYLIAN MBAPPE, FRANCE FORWARD (through translator): We are very happy, very happy to be in the quarterfinals. It wasn't an easy match. We played against a difficult team. We managed to score goals at key moments. And I think that we're still in enough control, even if sometimes there were some moments in the first half where we found ourselves in a bit of difficulty. 
 
But we ended up winning it. and we are very satisfied to be continuing the adventure. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK: Well, for a recap now of the day's other match, between England and Senegal, and a look ahead, here's Amanda Davies and Darren Lewis in Qatar. 
 
AMANDA DAVIES, CNN WORLD SPORT: Ahead of the game, England manager Gareth Southgate has said he wanted his side to put in a performance that would provide some cheer amongst the winter chill back at home. 
 
And, from here in Doha, it certainly seemed that was a mission complete after a three-nil victory against Senegal, to put England into the quarterfinals here in Qatar. 
 
Delighted to say, I'm joined by CNN senior sports analyst, Darren Lewis. Darren, how is it from where you were sitting? 
 
DARREN LEWIS, CNN SENIOR SPORTS ANALYST: Very impressive indeed. Best win in 20 years. You've got to go back to 2002 when they beat Denmark by three goals to nil for a performance that bloodless from England. Three different scores. 
 
Harry Kane off the mark. We talked about him earlier today. Four goals in three matches outside of the group stage on the way to the European championship final last year. He's off and running again. 
 
DAVIES: And what do you think from a Senegal perspective? Because there had been so much hope and expectation, and a real feeling of momentum and being driven on by the weight of history. They will be going home disappointed. 
 
LEWIS: With a few regrets, as well. Big, big chance that in the half hour, in the half-hour mark, with a shot that Jordan Pickford stuck out an arm to save. Had it had gone, the momentum would've shifted the African champions' way. 
 
Instead their heads dropped, and once the first goal went in, that was it for their resistance. 
 
DAVIES: So, next up for England, it is France. Another impressive performance there for them against Poland. They are scoring goals, I think it's fair to say. 
 
LEWIS: Yes, absolutely. Fifteen now in 12 matches for Kylian Mbappe. Olivier Giroud now the all-time top scorer for France. And they've got a star-studded squad.
 
It is a real matchup between two teams with incredible depth. Harry Kane, of course, won the Golden Boot at the last World Cup. But Kylian Mbappe is an all-star. He's a talent for a generation. [00:15:00]
 
I cannot wait to see this one. I cannot call this one either, Amanda. I'm going to have to sit on the fence. 
 
DAVIES: You don't do that very often, Darren.
 
Darren, thanks very much.
 
Indeed England's Phil Foden says he sees France as the strongest in the competition so far. But interestingly, at halftime, I was speaking to the boss of Qatar 2022, Hassan Al-Thawadi. He says he's predicting an England-Argentina final. Let's wait and see. 
 
Two weeks down, two to go till the big one. This is Amanda Davies with Darren Lewis for CNN. 
 
HARRAK: And here's a preview now of Monday's World Cup matches. First, Japan takes on 2018 runner-up Croatia, and later No. 1-ranked Brazil takes on South Korea. 
 
Speaking of Brazil, all eyes are on Neymar as he prepares to rejoin his teammates on the pitch Monday. He sprained his right ankle during Brazil's first match and hasn't played a game since. 
 
And stay tuned for much more on the World Cup, coming up on WORLD SPORT in about 30 minutes' time. 
 
Still to come, Ukrainians hope months of preparations will help them survive a brutal winter. We will go to the city of Bucha to see how residents are handling cold temperatures with limited power. 
 
And, the European Union's ban on most Russian oil imports is coming into force. We'll take a closer look at the impact that could have on Moscow. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HARRAK: Russia's No. 1 target. That's what the city of Bakhmut has become, according to a spokesperson for Ukraine's Eastern forces. 
 
As part of the Donetsk region, the area has been the focus of escalating attacks by Russian forces. 
 
Meanwhile, the Ukrainian official says shelling in Kherson region killed at least one person over the weekend. 
 
Police say the area is littered with mines, tripwires and other dangerous objects left by Russian troops. Ukrainians say they found more than 4,000 explosives devices. 
 
And Ukraine's president says the country must come together to endure the winter months, no matter how hard they may be. 
 
Well, during his nightly address, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russian forces would use winter as a weapon. CNN's Will Ripley reports from Bucha on how a city terrorized by
 
 Russia is preparing to survive the cold. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
WILL RIPLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In Ukraine, winter is coming. In the capital, Kyiv, the foreign minister warns a snow won't be the only thing falling from the skies. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are anticipating another massive missile attack by Russia, and the goal of this attack is to bring total destruction to our energy system. 
 <br>[00:20:00]
 
RIPLEY (voice-over): Crews are racing to restore power. These tents, set up by the government, a badly-needed break from the bitter cold. 
 
At this fast-food place, braving below-zero temperatures at the outdoor grill keeps the doors open when the lights were off. 
 
Some customers said they only want to come when there's no power because the food taste so much better. 
 
"We're just Ukrainians," she says. "That's our secret ingredient." 
 
Another secret for surviving dark times? Candles, a good cry, and prayer. 
 
RIPLEY: When you come here, what do you pray for?  
 
RIPLEY (voice-over): "We pray for peace, for the war to be over," she says, describing the hardship of life without electricity. "But then, I come here, and remember how much time we spent hiding in basements."
 
Hiding from Russian soldiers who occupied and terrorized their town, Bucha, the site of what Ukraine calls unspeakable war crimes. 
 
RIPLEY: If you didn't know what happened here, this could be any church and any quiet Kyiv suburb until you look closer. I noticed the bullet holes, and this cross marking a mass grave for more than 100 men, women and two children. 
 
RIPLEY (voice-over): Like five of Vira Goychuk's neighbors. 
 
VIRA GOYCHUK, RESIDENT: A cluster bomb.
 
RIPLEY: A cluster bomb? 
 
RIPLEY (voice-over): Bullet holes in her children's bedroom windows. After living through the of the Russian occupation, she can handle living without power. 
 
GOYCHUK: And, what is the real problem is there is not electricity. We do not have any connection. So, I have kids and if there's something wrong, I cannot even call to the hospital and call emergency. RIPLEY (voice-over): She tells me, when the power goes out, she loses
 
 cell phone service and Internet. But then -- 
 
GOYCHUK: Oh my God, it's a miracle. 
 
RIPLEY: Is that the lights coming on now? 
 
GOYCHUK: Yes.
 
RIPLEY (voice-over): The first place she goes, the kitchen 
 
RIPLEY: Coffee, that's your No. 1 priority? 
 
GOYCHUK: Yes, it's my No. 1. 
 
RIPLEY (voice-over): She's grateful for the little things in life. 
 
GOYCHUK: It's a moment of happiness. 
 
RIPLEY (voice-over): Grateful just to be alive. 
 
GOYCHUK: That's it. 
 
RIPLEY (voice-over): Will Ripley, CNN, Bucha, Ukraine. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HARRAK: Well, despite Russia's invasion of Ukraine, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz says dialogue must continue with President Vladimir Putin. Mr. Sholz says he will continue to reach out, no matter how long it takes to get his message through. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
OLAF SCHOLZ, GERMAN CHANCELLOR (through translator): I have spoken to him repeatedly since then, because I'm firmly convinced that it is a grave mistake if, despite all the differences -- and this is after all a small world for huge differences -- we no longer talk to each other at all. 
 
However, we do so without any illusions, because there are always long conversations and because all the public statements we hear to justify this war are repeated there. 
 
But the point has to always be made very clearly. And it has to be addressed what terrible destruction the Russian missiles caused to the energy infrastructure, in Ukraine as a whole. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK: Well, over the weekend, more than 300,000 tons of agricultural products left ports in Odessa, Ukraine. This according to Ukrainian officials, who say they were bound for countries in Europe, Asia and Africa. 
 
Earlier this year, multiple countries dependent on Ukrainian grain experienced extreme food shortages as Russian forces prevented international shipments. 
 
But, through the Grain from Ukraine program, officials say more than 13 million tons of Ukrainian food have been distributed. And the European Union's ban on Russian oil imports shipped by sea is now coming into effect, as Western nations make moves to deprive the Kremlin of revenue amid the war in Ukraine. 
 
Also taking effect on Monday, a price cap on Russian oil. The E.U., 7 nations and Australia agreed Friday to impose a price cap of $60 a barrel on oil shipped to other countries that have not adopted an embargo. It's another step to put pressure on Russia, without adding stress on the global economy by further reducing the supply of energy. 
 
Russia is reacting, with its deputy prime minister saying the country will not export oil to countries that impose price caps. We're also hearing from Ukraine's president to call the Russian oil price cap a, quote, "weak position that won't do enough to hurt the Russian economy." 
 
For more, I want to bring in Charles Lichfield, the deputy director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Center, and he joins me now from Washington D.C. 
 
Good day, sir. A price cap on Russia oil now goes into effect on Monday. There's been a lot of disagreement about where to set that cup. Is $60 low enough to hurt Russia economically without hurting oil consumers? 
 
[00:25:0]
 
CHARLES LICHFIELD, DEPUTY DIRECTOR, ATLANTIC COUNCIL'S GEOECONOMIC CENTER: Well, it's not as low as some of the countries that tend to be more focused on Russia hoped it would be.
 
But I think the point is that Russia is already selling at a discount. And this price cap, if it works, will lock in that discount. 
 
Now, let's imagine the price, all prices globally go up. Russia is selling it at 20 percent a 20-dollar discount to global prices. But, if prices were to go up, Russia would be selling for more. If this price cap works, it will stay at 60. 
 
HARRAK: Now also, on Monday, there is the E.U.'s partial embargo banning the import of Russian oil, entering through tankers, not pipelines. So how significant will the impact of that be on Russia and in Europe? 
 
LICHFIELD: Well, Europe has already been looking for alternative sources of supply, and it's done slightly better than people thought it would. And, some of the tension we saw on the market earlier this year is no longer there. 
 
For Russia, it means looking for new buyers. And -- and those buyers are driving a hard bargain. India may be the partner of Russia's that has increased its purchases the most. And it was not particularly interested in criticism from Western governments that say that India shouldn't do this.
 
But that doesn't mean that it isn't driving a hard bargain. 
 
So, just to put it in from a Russian perspective, they are in deficit this year. They won't take in as much money as they will be spending despite a record export income. And, next year, the outlook is much more gloomy than that. 
 
HARRAK: What impact will all these measures have on the global oil markets and the global economy? 
 
LICHFIELD: So on global oil markets, there was a fear that this price cap would be extremely complicated and add a sort of extra layer and complexity to transactions.
 
For the moments, markets seemed to be reassured. The guidance has been clear enough and we will see a demand for oil, I think, remaining at similar levels. 
 
And so, the impact on sort of inflation will probably level off over the next coming year. That's what most people think. But we do have quite a high level in the market. And that's difficult for consumers in the U.S. and the E.U. 
 
HARRAK: Could we see disruptions? 
 
LICHFIELD: I don't think so. So, the disruptions that we are hearing about, or, the feared descriptions in the E.U., in France. There's talk of even two-hour blackouts.
 
That's more to do with the overall picture and powering energy, powering electricity into homes. And it's not really just to do with oil. 
 
But the outlook, I think, for this winter isn't as bad as people feared this summer. You will remember the big spikes in for (ph) prices the summer. They're no longer really there, because people have reduced consumption. Governments have played some role in incentivizing people to that. 
 
So, while prices are extremely high, and we do have inflationary prices, I don't think we're looking at blackouts this winter. 
 
HARRAK: And on top of all of these developments, OPEC has now decided to maintain the reduced output levels that they set two months ago. A move as you can recall that absolutely incensed the Biden administration at the time. They're sticking with it what is the objective here? What's the thinking? 
 
LICHFIELD: Well, I'm not a specialist of OPEC, and I think it's quite difficult to determine what they want to do. But they do want to lock in a price that works for them. 
 
And they're not particularly interested in, as I was saying earlier, Indians aren't interested in Western governments tell them they should sort of get with the plan and help them -- help them help Ukraine win this sort of criticism doesn't really work really well in OPEC. They want the price level to be at a level that suits them, not one that suits the objective of the United States government. 
 
HARRAK: I just want to have a final thought for me, at the Kremlin has weaponized energy, Europe, as you pointed out, is bracing for a couple of very difficult winter months. Many are pointing to the month of February as your stress test.
 
From an energy perspective, does Europe have sufficient energy supplies? And can it withstand this level of pressure in the long term? 
 
LICHFIELD: So far, the winter has been much warmer than it could've been, so Europe has high levels of gas supplies, emergency supplies. There is still an issue with power generation. 
 
It depends on the country, but, for instance, in France, a lot of the nuclear feet is off line and that's making things quite difficult. But I think the outlook, the consensus is that there won't be blackouts. There will simply be more expensive for consumers. 
 
And even more expensive for governments. Governments have stepped in to put a ceiling on price increases. That means more deficits for more European governments. I don't think there will be blackouts. 
 
HARRAK: Charles Lichfield, thank you so much for joining us. Greatly appreciate it. 
 
Covered in ash and fleeing for their lives, people in Indonesia are getting away from an erupting volcano any way they can. We'll have the latest.

 <br>[00:32:36]
 
HARRAK: South Africa's National Assembly is set to consider this week whether to launch impeachment proceedings against the country's embattled president. 
 
Over the weekend, a spokesperson for Cyril Ramaphosa said he will not step down after a panel found evidence he violated his oath of office. CNN's David McKenzie has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa is digging in, a spokesman telling CNN that he will not resign, despite days of pressure for him to do so after an independent panel found that he could have acted unconstitutionally when it came to the possible covering up of a theft at his private game farm. 
 
Now, that happened some time ago when $700,000, at least, money that was stored in a leather sofa was stolen. The president is accused by some of covering up that theft and other allegations have come to life. He faces potential impeachment in parliament, but now, he is trying to set aside, according to spokesman, that report, that could get him in the clear. 
 
There's also the political side of this. He will be facing his top leadership within the ruling ANC to see if you can get political backing and possibly hoping that the parliament doesn't take up impeachment proceeding. 
 
Cyril Ramaphosa came into office saying he was going to fight deep- seated corruption in this country. So it has certainly cast a shadow over his legacy. He says he's completely innocent.

HARRAK: Nearly 2,000 people have been forced to evacuate in Indonesia to put as much distance as possible between themselves and an erupting volcano.
 
CNN's Allison Chinchar has more on the desperate flight to safety in East Java. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOIST (voice-over): Ash filles the skies in Indonesia, forming a thick caustic cloud over Mount Semeru, on the island of Java. 
 
Video from the country's Ministry of Environment and Forestry captured the explosive eruption on Saturday, a burst of ash shooting 15 kilometers into the sky. A sign for people living in the volcano's shadow, it's time to go. 
 
This man escaping on a motorbike, the ash caking on his face. He says he doesn't know where he's going, just somewhere out of the volcano's reach 
 
Authorities say nearly 2,000 people have been evacuated from the slopes of the volcano, which is located about 800 kilometers Southeast of Jakarta. 
 
The roads in the area, packed with vehicles, rushing to out-run the volcanic ash that is still running down. Emergency workers are directing people out of the danger zone, handing out masks and urging them to go to shelters. 
 
INDAH AMPERAWATI MASDAR, LUMAJANG DISTRICT DEPUTY CHIEF (through translator): We have readied some nearby schools and village halls. We will prepare them until the observatory post declares it's safe. 
 
CHINCHAR (voice-over): The damage already done to some areas. Rooftops are singed, and the ground is covered with smoldering soot. Authorities are telling people to stay at least eight kilometers away from the eruption center, but there are fears the hot ash could drift further. So far, many people are heeding the warnings, the lesson learned last
 
 year, when more than 50 people were killed in a previous eruption and thousands were forced from their homes.

HARRAK: Well, meanwhile, on Hawaii's big island, the world's largest active volcano continues to put on a show. The U.S. Geological Survey says the lava from Mauna Loa is still more than two miles away from the island's main highway and poses no threat for now.
 
Visitors are flocking to the island to watch the magnificent view. Volcano Russians also have a deep cultural significance for many Hawaiians.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
TILIHIA GIONSON, PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICER, HAWAII TOURISM AUTHORITY: In the Hawaiian world view, in the Hawaiian genealogy, the islands themselves are family members. The islands themselves are ancestors. The natural forces that shaped the island are certainly part of that.
 
And so for many local families, for many Hawaiian families, Pele, the Goddess of the volcano, that life force is an ancestor. 
 
And so, in many ways, an eruption is akin to Grandma coming over to visit. It's not something viewed with fear, necessarily, but an awareness, certainly, their protocols associated with that, much as you might when your grandmother comes to visit.

HARRAK: Britain's Prince William and Princess Catherine returned home over the weekend after wrapping up a U.S. trip. Their star-studded tour put the spotlight on the environment. 
 
But, the royal visit was nearly overshadowed by royal controversy. CNN's Max Foster explains. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PRINCE WILLIAM, UNITED KINGDOM: It's my hope the Earthshot legacy will continue to grow. 
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): And the beginning of another legacy for William and Catherine in their first overseas trip as the new Prince and Princess of Wales. Their three-day U.S. visit culminating in the second annual Earthshot prize. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Welcome to Boston and the Earthshot prize, the biggest environmental awards on the planet. 
 
FOSTER (voice-over): Prince William's passion project where, every year, over a decade, five winners from around the globe are awarded a million pounds to fund their creative solutions to the climate crisis. 
 
But the trip was overshadowed by a controversy erupting back home. A senior royal aide resigning after Ngozi Fulani, a black charity executive, shared her experience of being grilled about her heritage at a Buckingham Palace event. 
 
NGOZI FULANI, DOMESTIC AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE ADVISER, SISTAH SPACE: I am British, and there is no debate about it. So, then, when she says, Oh! I knew eventually I would get, Where you come from? 
 
FOSTER (voice-over): Buckingham Palace quickly called the remarks unacceptable. A spokesperson for Prince William also saying racism has no place in our society. 
 
PRINCE WILLIAM: We thank you so much for your help. 
 
FOSTER (voice-over): In Boston, it was a case of keeping calm and carrying on. William and Kate focusing on environmentalism and the inspiration behind the trip. 
 
PRINCE WILLIAM: Sixty years ago, President John F. Kennedy's moonshot speech laid down a challenge to American innovation and ingenuity. It was that moon shot speech that inspired me to launch the Earthshot prize. And where better to hold this year's awards ceremony than in President Kennedy's hometown?
 
FOSTER (voice-over): William met with the late president's daughter, a current U.S. ambassador to Australia, Caroline at the Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum. 
 
Later, the Prince of Wales meeting with President Joe Biden, who was in the state for a fundraising event. The couple also filled their time with a Celtics game and visits with environmental tech entrepreneurs. Also Boston Harbor, as well as a non-profit supporting the disadvantaged youth. 
 
But the highlight of William and Catherine's trip was Friday's star- studded Earthshot ceremony that included performances by Ellie Goulding and Annie Lennox. 
 
Oscar winner and one of the nights presenters, Rami Malek, applauding the prince's efforts to support those trying to find a solution to the climate crisis. 
 
RAMI MALEK, ACTOR: It is extraordinarily inspiring. He's just finding answers and the 1 million pounds that are given to these five people, these five organizations is something that keeps us from looking at the gloom and doom. 
 
Max Foster, CNN, Boston.

HARRAK: America's first couple celebrated this year's Kennedy Center honorees at the White House on Sunday and, in his remarks at the reception, U.S. President Joe Biden stressed the importance of unity.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We will do well to remember today, in a moment when there's too much hate, too much anger, too much division here in America and, quite frankly, around the world. We have to remember today, as our song goes, that we are one but we are not the same. We get to carry each other.

HARRAK: Mr. Biden was quoting a lyric from the Irish rock band U-2. They were on the list of honorees, along with singers Gladys Knight and Amy Grant, composer Tania Leon, and actor George Clooney.
