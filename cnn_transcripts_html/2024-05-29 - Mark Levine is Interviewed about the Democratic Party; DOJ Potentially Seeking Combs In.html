THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
<br>[08:30:00] 
 
MARK LEVINE, MANHATTAN BOROUGH PRESIDENT: We are for safe, fair, effective policing. We are not against security at the border. We're for that. We're for compassion for all people in this country, no matter their documentation status. And we certainly can't be the party that's against building housing. We should be the party that's pro housing to deal with this affordability crisis. With that message, that speaks to the lives of regular people, we will win.
 
KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR: When you talk to - when you were mentioning kind of that - what isn't landing is discussion of the threat to democracy maybe, I'm paraphrasing.
 
LEVINE:  Yes.
 
BOLDUAN: That is - that was the message yesterday from actor Robert de Niro, standing in front of the courthouse and what he was - what he was trying to present, alongside with the Biden campaign, what they were trying to present was the threat that Donald Trump presents still to democracy going forward. 
 
But is that a miss? I mean Robert de Niro carrying - Robert de Niro has a lot to say and can say whatever he would like, but I asked Michael Tyler if he thought this backfired on them because they're standing out in front of the courthouse drawing attention to the courthouse and what Donald Trump has been saying. He said, no, absolutely not. They're going to meet - they're going to meet the cameras and meet the voters where they are. What do you think about that message?
 
LEVINE: Well, it's true that a Trump victory is a threat, potentially a mortal threat, to American democracy. I have to say that.
 
BOLDUAN: But is it - right, but you say that -
 
LEVINE: But -
 
BOLDUAN: But is that - that - but that doesn't seem to, you're suggesting, to be really landing with voters right now.
 
LEVINE: It is not the best message to connect to working class voters that I speak. Now, there are other threats that will affect life even in New York City and every part of the country. Republicans in the White House and Congress could authorize concealed carry of handguns everywhere. We could have a flood of guns in New York City. They could mess with our elections by outlawing mail-in ballots everywhere here in New York City. Of course they could restrict access to reproductive rights here in New York City. Those are tangible more so than the threat to democracy. I think we need to fight on the battlefield of real-world issues. 
 
BOLDUAN: I just thought of something. We hear from the likes of Jim Messina and many others about the - they call it the bedwetting phenomenon of Democrats, that they get very nervous around presidential elections and everyone should just calm down. Are you hyperventilating? Are you bedwetting? I don't want to say it that way, Mark, but do you think Democrats need to calm down? Or are you saying there is - what I'm hearing from you though is that there's real alarm.
 
LEVINE: This is a close election. This is a winnable election. We have work to do and we cannot take working class voters for granted. We have to connect with them. We have to do better on messaging. We have time to do this, but I'm speaking out now -
 
BOLDUAN: Yes.
 
LEVINE: So that we get this right, because the stakes are impossibly high.
 
BOLDUAN: While I have you, this historic trial is happening in your hometown, in your borough. I have read that you are a longtime friend -
 
LEVINE: Yes. 
 
BOLDUAN: Of the district attorney, Alvin Bragg. What do you see if - you've been watching this closely. What do you think as you've seen the prosecution presenting its case? And also, if I could just put it this way, if after all of this Donald Trump is not found guilty, what does that mean for the district attorney in bringing this case that many thought - had suggested maybe he should not?
 
LEVINE: Well, it's going to be in the hands of the jury in a couple of hours and I'm not going to try and predict that result. But I really admired DA Bragg for bringing this case. He has now been the national target of hatred to a really disgusting degree, up to and including death threats. It would have been very easy for him to take a pass on this, but he didn't. Regardless of the result, facts have come out in this trial that the public media to understand, the extent to which Donald Trump engaged in fraud in a conspiracy to hide his actions, to influence an election. There were serious evidence presented and it's important that the public got to see that. 
 
So, I admire the DA for bringing this case, for the strength of the trial. And now we'll see what the jury decides.
 
BOLDUAN: And we absolutely will. We're going to hear jury instructions very soon, and it all - this is the big moment that's going to be happening this morning, at least it begins.
 
It's great to have you here, Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine. 
 
LEVINE: Great to be here.
 
BOLDUAN: Thank you so much for your time.
 
LEVINE: You got it.
 
BOLDUAN: Coming up for us, a CNN analysis shows that the munitions used in Israel's deadly strike in Rafah, they were made in the United States. We'll bring you more detail on that.
 
And a CNN exclusive report. Federal investigators are preparing to bring the accusers of Sean ""Diddy"" Combs before a federal grand jury. What this now means for the ongoing investigation.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[08:38:19]
 
BOLDUAN: A CNN exclusive now. Sources tell CNN federal investigators are preparing to bring accusers of Sean ""Diddy"" Combs before a federal grand jury. This is seen as a clear sign the Department of Justice could be moving to indict the disgraced music mogul. Since November, Combs has been named in eight civil lawsuits, seven directly accusing him of sexual assault. 
 
CNN's Elizabeth Wagmeister is following this. She's got this new reporting.
 
Elizabeth, what are you learning about this grand jury and about this potential move? 
 
ELIZABETH WAGMEISTER, CNN ENTERTAINMENT CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Kate. 
 
So, I hear from two sources that federal investigators are preparing to potentially bring witnesses in front of a federal grand jury in New York City. We hear that witnesses have been notified that they may be called to testify, but at this time none of them have been prepped for this potential testimony. 
 
Now, as you noted, there have been eight lawsuits against Sean "Diddy" Combs, seven of which accuse him directly of sexual assault. And I hear from sources that the majority of those accusers who have filed civil suits have been questioned by these authorities throughout this investigation. 
 
Now, of course, this all stems from back in March when two of Diddy's homes were rated in Los Angeles and Miami. And now, as you said, this marks a significant escalation to give us a window into where this investigation stands. 
 
BOLDUAN: And what are you learning about the evidence being - being reviewed by investigators? You've been following this so closely, Elizabeth. 
 
WAGMEISTER: Yes. So, one new piece of reporting that we are hearing is that video is in the hands of federal investigators. 
 <br>[08:40:05]
 
Now, this video footage comes from Combs' residences. We are not clear on whether this was seized during the raids or whether they obtained this from another source when they brought them in for questioning. But we do hear that many of these sources who are being questioned are cooperating with authorities. Some have even handed over evidence that they think could be relevant.
 
And among this video footage, we hear that investigators, they're spotting people in the footage and they are calling them in for questioning. So, the people who have been spoken to by these investigators go beyond these accusers. We hear that one person who was spotted in that video footage and was called in is a male sex worker who has spoken to these authorities. 
 
And I have one source who says that this is much bigger than just these lawsuits. At the time that the homes were rated back in March, Kate, we reported, based on a law enforcement source, that these raids were about sex trafficking. Now we hear that that scope has widened to more of the allegations included in these lawsuits, which would include money laundering and drugging because, Kate, six of these accusers have alleged that they were drugged by Combs.
 
BOLDUAN: Yes, Elizabeth Wagmeister, great reporting, as always. Thank you so much.
 
So, we also have some good news this morning for parents. There may be a way to lower the risk of your child developing a lasting peanut allergy. A new study saying, well, it's a pretty simple step. It's introducing your children and feeding your children smooth peanut butter during infancy and early childhood. 
 
CNN's Jacqueline Howard has the details. She's joining us now on that.
 
Jacqueline, what does this study say? Tell us more about this.
 
JACQUELINE HOWARD, CNN HEALTH REPORTER: It's an interesting study, Kate. What the researchers found is that children who were fed peanut products early on in life regularly, from infancy, around four to six months old, all the way through age five, they had a 71 percent reduced rate of peanut allergies later on in life in adolescents at around age 12. And that's in comparison with kids who avoided peanut products in infancy. 
 
And I will say, it was previously recommended to wait to introduce your baby to peanut butter until age three. But since then, in recent years, medical groups have shifted their position and the American Academy of Pediatrics now says that an early introduction to peanuts may prevent peanut allergy. 
 
And, Kate, this new study not only seems to support that, but it takes it further and shows that that reduced risk of peanut allergy can be sustained all the way through adolescence to age 12 or 13.
 
Kate.
 
BOLDUAN: Yes, it really is wonderful news. I mean that - the statistics seem to speak for themselves here. 
 
How do parents introduce this and do this safely? 
 
HOWARD: Yes. Well, you definitely want to talk to your doctor first and develop a plan with your pediatrician or your allergist. I mean if you have a child who has eczema or an egg allergy, they are at higher risk. But once you develop that plan with your doctor, they'll likely recommend to start with a soft peanut butter puree. Obviously, peanuts are a choking hazard. And start with this small amount, like this pea sized amount. See how your child responds to that. And then reintroduce it three to four days later, see how they respond to a larger size. And slowly over time increase in size and see how they do. 
 
Of course, if you notice something's off or if they don't react well, talk to your doctor about that. But having a plan is so important because we know, Kate, food allergies are a public health concern. About 2 percent of kids here in the U.S., that's nearly 1.5 million, have a peanut allergy. So, studies like this really do get a lot of attention among physicians and parents as well, Kate.
 
BOLDUAN: Yes, I know. I mean it's - and it's - it's really nice and comforting for so many families who - to think that they - they have tools and there's something they can do to try to help this. It's good to see you. Thank you so much. 
 
Coming up for us, we are watching for Donald Trump to make his way to the courthouse in lower Manhattan once more before his case is handed to the jury. We're going to bring you all of these moments on this very important day ahead.
 
And once pristine rivers, now orange. It's all because of climate change.

JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: All right, we have new CNN reporting this morning about the Israeli airstrike in Rafah. Dozens of people were killed in the aftermath there. The new reporting, a CNN analysis shows that the munitions used were manufactured in the United States. 
 
Let's get right to CNN's Nada Bashir for the latest on this.
 
Nada, what are you learning?
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, John, CNN has geolocated footage from this particular area of the camp in Rafah, reviewing that footage with weapons and explosives experts who identified a U.S. made small- diameter bomb manufacturer by Boeing. Now, the properties of this particular bomb correspond with some of the details shared by the Israeli military spokesperson, Daniel Hagari, on Tuesday. We've spoken to weapons experts who have indeed confirmed that this is a high- precision bomb that these munitions were used for a targeted attack. 
 <br>[08:50:05]
 
But, of course, weapons experts have also told CNN that the use of any munitions in densely populated areas carries risks. And as we know, this was an area filled with thousands of tents sheltering displaced Palestinian civilians. 
 
Now, President Biden has previously told CNN that if Israel were to go into Rafah, the U.S. would not be supplying weapons for that sort of offensive. But clearly American weapons are already in the hands of the Israeli military and are now being used in the southern city of Rafah. We've heard from the deputy press secretary of the Pentagon, Sabrina Singh, who said, "I do not know what type of munition was used in that airstrike? I'd have to refer you to the Israelis to speak to that."
 
Now, the White House has said that that particular strike on Sunday was not a red line, that they would be against a major ground offensive and that they have not seen an offensive of this kind just yet. But look, we have already seen repeated airstrikes on Rafah now. And according to eyewitnesses, we are seeing Israeli tanks now moving into central parts of the city.
 
BERMAN: Nada, what is known about a new round of military activity in and around Rafah?
 
BASHIR: Look, in the last 24 hours, we have seen more airstrikes in the southern city once again targeting the Tal al-Sultan neighborhood, which is the area that was targeted on Sunday evening. But also targeting the al-Mawasi coastal area. Now, this is an area that is designated as a humanitarian zone. This is an area which earlier this month the Israeli military had told civilians in Rafah to evacuate to. 
 
And we know over the last three weeks that more than a million civilians have moved out of the city of Rafah, or at least from the central parts of this particular city. And we have seen graphic images emerging, distressing videos emerging from that coastal areas showing the bloodied bodies of the victims on that coastal front on the Gaza Strip. The Israeli military has said that it did not carry out an airstrike, that it did not target the humanitarian zone. But again, that footage on the ground speaks for itself. Real concern, of course, mounting over the situation in Rafah with civilians left with nowhere to go.
 
BERMAN: All right, Nada Bashir for us. Nada, thank you very much for that. 
 
In the meantime, I'm standing outside the Manhattan criminal court where today history will be made. Jury deliberations begin in the criminal case against Donald Trump. We do expect to hear from him at some point before the jury goes into that room at about 10:00. Standby for that. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[08:55:57]
 
BOLDUAN: In a bizarre move, North Korea has developed a foul smelling strategy to contend with its neighbor to the south. Follow me on this. Now sending bags of what South Korea's joint chiefs of staff call floating filth. Hundreds of balloons floating into South Korea tethered to bags filled with trash. South Korea's military says this started Tuesday night. And as of this morning, more than 260 of these balloons have been reported. North Korea's state media - take a look at that. North Korea's state media says that it is retaliation for South Korean activists who often send materials, including propaganda pamphlets, to the North.
 
Detained American Ryan Watson has pleaded guilty yesterday to possession of ammunition charges in Turks and Caicos. His sentencing is now set for June 21st. Watson told us on the show in an interview last week that he doesn't recall putting ammunition in his bag, that the bullet were from a hunting trip last year, and that they must have slipped in-between the lining of his luggage. He is one of four Americans who remain stuck in Turks and Caicos facing ammunition possession charges now.. 
 
A federal judge in New Hampshire has struck down a conservative-lead law restricting how teachers could instruct students on topics such as gender and race, or as the law described it, divisive concepts. The judge ruled that the law was unconstitutional. This move marks the first time in the nation that a judge has overturned such a measure, which could set a precedent for similar moves in other states. This ruling, though, could still be appealed if the court fight continues.
 
And Washington, D.C., is preparing for some pretty high-profile diplomats. The National Zoo announcing this hour that two two-year-old giant pandas, Bao Li and Qing Bao, seen, well, here in China, I believe, still in China, that they will arrive by the end of the year. Bao Li's mother was actually born at the D.C. zoo, and his grandparents are two of the three pandas that just returned to China late last year. Panda politics and panda diplomacy, it's a very real thing. We will continue to cover it. 
 
OK, so, some of Alaska's most picturesque waterways are turning orange and scientists say climate change is to blame. They say toxic metals that have been underground for thousands of years are now seeping into rivers as the permafrost thaws and turning them from cool, clear blue to cloudy orange. 
 
Let me bring in CNN's Bill Weir. He's got much more on this.
 
Bill, what is going on here? 
 
BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, this is so surprising, Kate, to researchers from the National Park Service, University of California Davis was in on this, U.S. Geological Survey. We're used to seeing this sort of thing happen around mining activity. From Appalachian to the Rocky Mountains we've seen streams be discolored this way. 
 
But what's unique about what's happening up in Alaska's Brooks Range is this is some of the most remote wilderness in the world, and home of some of the most clear, blue, pristine streams anywhere in the world. But now we're seeing this - this bright orange as iron and zinc and copper, nickel, lead, which have all been locked away in the permafrost for thousands of years, is falling and being released now. The perma in permafrost does no longer exist up there, sadly. And this effect is just a startling, very vivid example of the hidden consequences of an overheating planet, Kate.
 
BOLDUAN: So, aside from the obvious impacts that we're talking about here, and the effects, like, what are scientists worried this could do and mean?
 
WEIR: Well, this could also be an indication of permafrost releasing methane, which is harder to see, this invisible gas, but it's up to 80 times more potent as a heat trapping gas than - than carbon dioxide. The worry about the arctic, which is warming four - four times faster than the rest of the planet, sort of uncorking this methane bomb, has long been one of those dominos, those tipping points that climate scientists have worried about right now. 
 <br>[08:59:57]
 
But in the meantime, in the near term, these waterways mean so much in terms of tourism, in terms of survival for indigenous tribes and others who rely on these fisheries for healthy - these could be toxic.</pre>
