LAURA COATES, CNN ANCHOR: All right, night two of the RNC is officially in the books as the clock strikes midnight here in Milwaukee. Welcome to our viewers. If you're just tuning in, I'm Laura Coates. And we are live at the CNN political grill with another full hour of coverage ahead. Special guests include former governor, Asa Hutchinson, Ohio Congresswoman Shontel Brown and comedian, Matt Friend, who is ready to debut a new J.D. Vance impression. Yes.
 
Now, by all accounts, it was an evening defined, well, but really, these images on the screen. You had former rivals of Donald Trump and one by one walking on that stage deliver flattering speeches in full support, period, of a man they all use to insult. Donald Trump came out to watch them speak, making another UFC style entrance to another round of cheers. His ear still bandaged of the assassination attempt. One source says that Trump personally changed his schedule to make sure he was there to hear from these speakers, particularly Nikki Haley.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NIKKI HALEY, FORMER GOVERNOR OF SOUTH CAROLINA: You don't have to agree with Trump 100 percent of the time to vote for him.
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HALEY: Take it from me. I haven't always agreed with President Trump. If we have four more years of Biden, or a single day of Harris, our country will be badly worse off. For the sake of our nation, we have to go with Donald Trump.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
COATES: I want to bring in former Republican presidential candidate and governor of Arkansas, Asa Hutchinson. He endorsed Nikki Haley after ending his own presidential bid. Governor, it's so good to see you today. How are you?
 
ASA HUTCHINSON (R), FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR: Well, I'm great. It's been quite an experience seeing two days to the convention. And, you know, it's -- I've been to six Republican conventions in my lifetime. And this is probably as cohesive of one and as united as one as I've seen. And you contrast that really 2016 whatever you had Ted Cruz that did not give a full endorsement. I think Nikki Haley learned from that experience.
 
And while -- and so the convention has been extraordinary, I think this year is off to a good start.
 
COATES: You know, it's funny you mentioned both of those individuals, Ted Cruz, Nikki Haley, both speaking tonight on the second day. And Nikki Haley, someone who ran fiercely against Donald Trump and him and she and others have tried to speak to you about maybe getting you to now endorse the former President of the United States. I mean, you had previously said you were not going to do. Have they made a compelling case for you now to endorse them?
 
HUTCHINSON: Well, they make a compelling case for unity. But I didn't come to the convention for that purpose, you know. And I -- I, you know, I'm a Republican, and I want to support a Republican. But let me talk about the message that Nikki Haley did tonight. One, she was smart because she disarmed the audience very quickly by saying I'm endorsing Donald Trump, and that -- that set them at ease.
 
And then she made it comfortable to say you can have differences with Donald Trump and that's a very important point. And my differences are significant. I outlined those in my campaign. And that's the reason I ran. But we recognize that we're going to have debates within the Republican Party. There's going to be disagreements on Ukraine and support a global leadership on protectionism. And -- and so I want to see how that plays out. So I didn't come here to do it endorsement. I want to wait and see how this plays out in the coming months.
 <br>[01:05:32]
 
COATES: You know, it sounds as if your mind is more malleable or perhaps thinking that you might want to consider the future that you had not wanted to do in the past. So the idea of unity, how are you defining that for a party knowing obviously, no Republican is a monolith. But we talked about unity, does that require a full throated response and -- and support of the candidate now?
 
HUTCHINSON: Well, that's a -- a good question. Of course, whenever you look at the Republican Party, the, you know, there's some good Republicans that aren't here at the convention. I think about Mike Pence. I mean, he was the vice president for Donald Trump.
 
COATES: Right.
 
HUTCHINSON: You know, I -- I think about the former governor of -- of New Jersey. And so you've got an element that's not here. But the message has been significant. And what has really warmed you and made you give a second thought to Donald Trump is, first of all the strength that he showed, at the attempt -- attempt on his life. That was a spontaneous. It was a recognition of responsibility and leadership, that strength is compelling for our country.
 
And then secondly, what's changed is the weakness that Joe Biden has demonstrated in the most recent debate and his struggles. So right now all the momentum is that direction. And Nikki Haley preserved her political future. And that's important for our party and a showcase tonight to so many great leaders, including the for -- the current governor of Arkansas.
 
COATES: Well, yes, speaking of Nikki Haley, I want you to listen tonight to some of the praise that she was giving to the former president. And it does compare quite strangely to her earlier critique of him after he said that Putin, quote, could do whatever the hell he wanted to any NATO member country that doesn't pay their dues. Listen to this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HALEY: Putin didn't attack Ukraine, because he knew Donald Trump was tough.
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HALEY: A strong -- a strong president doesn't start wars. A strong president prevents wars.
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HALEY: Putin has made no bones about the fact that he wants to destroy America. And Trump is going to side with him over our allies who stood with us after 9/11.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COATES: I mean, that's quite the evolution. We're seeing a theme this week of those who have evolved thoughts on Trump. What do you make of that?
 
HUTCHINSON: Well, this was watch it very carefully. I was really hoping that Ambassador Haley would make the case for Ukraine. She did that during the campaign, America's support for it. She shied away from that tonight.
 
COATES: Why do you think she did that?
 
HUTCHINSON: Well, because even though she recognizes we're going to have differences, it was Trump's night. And so she did not emphasize the differences. She emphasized how we have to come together to win in November. And so minimize differences. And in contrast, what she did in the campaign. COATES: But minimize differences is -- is one vehicle. But then there is the aspect of voters who remember not too long ago, her making the statements that she has, does it seem like it's pandering?
 
HUTCHINSON: Well, it -- it seems like we don't have a whole lot of integrity, whatever we're running, whatever we flip positions that quickly. And I don't think that Nikki has flipped positions. She just didn't it -- did not emphasize those positions tonight. I hope that she'll continue to be a voice in the party, or America's leadership, and the necessity of being good partners with our allies. That's important to me.
 
I know that's important to Ambassador Haley as well. You know, you asked me about myself, you think about it. It was almost one year ago in this same arena, that I said I was not going to support a convicted felon for President United States. A lot has changed since then. The convictions almost sort of diminished in and of -- in and of themselves because of the -- the attempt on his life and then secondly, some of the court decisions.
 
But it's still important to me, whatever I'm a former federal prosecutor, I believe in the rule and law of our country. And so I'm -- I'm not there yet. And I -- I, Nikki Haley makes it persuasive case. But I want to make sure that we have the right leader for America and I want to be able to support a Republican. But Donald Trump has some flaws that I hope has changed because of what happened to him. And I'm looking forward to his speech and seeing where he wants to take this country.
 <br>[01:10:13]
 
COATES: Governor Asa Hutchinson, thank you so much for joining me this evening.
 
HUTCHINSON: Thank you.
 
COATES: Well, another Trump rival is speaking out tonight about Haley's speech. Governor Chris Christie said what America saw was, quote, tortured ambition. Christie, not mincing words. He said not only will Haley voters not be persuaded to back Trump but that those voters will be, quote, ashamed that they supported her in the first place.
 
We'll continue the conversation with Republican strategist Liam Donovan, CNN political commentator Ashley Allison, CNN, senior political analyst Mark Preston and Washington correspondent for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Tia Mitchell is here as well. I mean, first of all, Liam, I wonder what do you make of that assessment by the former Governor Chris Christie, who himself at one point was aligned with the Trump campaign and also thinking about being the president. We all remember that history. But let's all have amnesia for a second. What do you think about his assessment of -- of how Haley will be read by voters?
 
LIAM DONOVAN, FORMER NATIONAL REPUBLICAN SENATORIAL COMMITTEE AIDE: Look, I think we have to be serious about the fact that this is the most united Republicans have been behind a ticket in 20 years. It has not been this feel of a convention since 2004, when George W. Bush was running for a second term.
 
If you think about any of those in between the goal of the -- of the ticket at this point was trying to pin down the base. Right now that's not -- that's not what's happening. This is the Baskin Robbins night. This is featuring all the flavors that are welcomed party, trying to build a permission structure to come home in the fall and really appeal to maybe moderate voters or Republican leaning voters who have turned away from the party in the Donald Trump era.
 
I think they've done a decent job. Nikki Haley hit the right tone. Whether Chris Christie speaks for a meaningful segment of the population, I'm skeptical of that. But it's all relative. This is a situation where Donald Trump is in the driver's seat. Republicans have not been in this position, again, in 20 years, and taking a step back. It's impressive how unified this ticket is. And tonight was the night to really consolidate that.
 
COATES: I mean I think they are all saying something similar. But I do wonder if voters believe them to be truly unified or was it tortured ambition that Chris Christie spoke about when it came to them? Because I mean, we're not talking about, in some categories it's been years, that they've had this discrepancy or disagreement. Others like DeSantis or Haley, it's been months.
 
TIA MITCHELL, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION: Yes. I think that most people, a lot of people watching these speeches today believe that these former rivals of President Trump, A, are showing party unity. And that's what you would expect in a convention. But the other part is the ambition part that Chris Christie mentioned, is that we know that DeSantis, Nikki Haley, even Rick Scott, they all have ambitions to continue to be leaders in the party to possibly rise in higher leadership positions.
 
And so they have to still play the party politics, if you will. And that means you get behind the nominee. And so I think they're showing that they're willing to play the long game, and that is what is required of them right now.
 
COATES: Well, you know, also not for nothing. I mean, they know that if Trump becomes the president, they might want an appointment or two. So they're may be auditioning for other roles in the administration. But we'll have to see. I want to ask you actually about this, though, because Haley also went after Vice President Kamala Harris tonight and took couple shots at the division with the Democratic Party as well, we know that's still happening behind the scenes, even comparing them to what they see as the now unified GOP. Listen to this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HALEY: A vote for Joe Biden is a vote for President Kamala Harris.
 
(BOOING)
 
HALEY: After seeing the debate, everyone knows it's true. (END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COATES: Well, what do you make of this and all that she went on to talk about Harris having one job and that was to solve the border and imagine if she had control the entire country. What do you make of her statements?
 
ASHLEY ALLISON, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, a couple points. One, Nikki Haley did that -- the entire campaign go after Kamala Harris and we saw how well that played out for her. It wasn't resonating with the voters of the Republican Party. The other thing is, I -- I hear what you're saying, Liam, in terms of the unity of the party. Here's the question to Chris Christie's point, there still are Nikki Hayler -- vote -- Nikki Haley voters out there. And they may be disappointed. Maybe not all of them, but they may be disappointed.
 
The question is, is one night speech going to erase the four years that got them to the point where they didn't want to support Donald Trump in the first place? And I think the answer is honestly no, I don't think one speech even one week or even an assassin -- assassination attempt is enough to erase the policies of Donald Trump that got people to say, I'm a Never Trumper or I don't want to be I mean, look at Governor Asa Hutchinson, he still says he's not there. And I guess I --
 <br>[01:15:01]
 
COATES: Although he was seemingly more receptive to the idea of thinking about it and talking about --
 
ALLISON: Yes.
 
COATES: -- how the convictions were more diminished in light of the attempted assassination.
 
ALLISON: Yes. But I think that the part of the Biden campaign and Democrats will have to be, you can't forget, like, it is awful what happened on Saturday, but it doesn't change a person's policy positions. It doesn't change a person's character. And if it does, I need more than one night of teleprompter speech for you to prove that to me. And so again, this is why campaigns matter. This is why Democrats need to go on offense at this point, and not just be bickering amongst themselves.
 
COATES: Preston?
 
MARK PRESTON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Criticism from Chris Christie and -- and Asa Hutchinson, they're talking about a party that no longer exists, though. They are -- they were leaders, people forget that Asa Hutchinson was the lead impeachment manager of the Bill Clinton impeachment, right?
 
People forget, you know, that Chris Christie was the rising star and was very, you know, a lot of people thought he was going to be the Republican nominee, you know, at one point, however, they're talking about a party that doesn't exist. Eight years ago, Donald Trump was trying to unify a party was successful, but it was difficult.
 
This week, Donald Trump comes into Milwaukee, the party is unified. And by the way, when I say unified, they're not all best friends, but they have a common goal of trying to knock out Joe Biden. But Chris Christie, Asa Hutchinson, other Never Trumpers, that Republican Party no longer exists.
 
COATES: Fascinating to think about the messenger and who will be taken seriously and heated at this point. Stand by everyone. We're going to talk more about this. J.D. Vance is preparing to give his big speech tomorrow night as the Biden campaign is now going on the offensive, calling him MAGA mini me. Ohio Democratic Congresswoman Shontel Brown joins me on that, next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[01:20:10]
 
COATES: Now tomorrow night, the spotlight turns to vice presidential nominee and running mate, Ohio Senator J.D. Vance. We're going to talk to voters sharing how he overcame his own personal struggles. But the Biden campaign is trying to paint Vance as the extreme younger version of Donald Trump calling Vance MAGA mini me on this Biden-Harris campaign X account and sending out no fewer than 14 posts just today on Vance's record on abortion on foreign policy. The Biden team is also highlighting Vance's previous comments about Trump, like these.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH), VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: There is definitely an element of Donald Trump's support that has its basis in racism, xenophobia.
 
Definitely some people who voted for Trump or were racist. And they voted for him for racist reasons.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COATES: Joining me now Democratic Congresswoman Shontel Brown who is from the same home state as Vance, Ohio. Congresswoman, thank you for joining me this evening. Good to see you. I do wonder if somebody from Ohio what you make of this pick?
 
REP. SHONTEL BROWN (D-OH): Well, thank you for having me, Laura. I think you can tell that we have a candidate on the -- on the -- on -- from the state of Ohio that is duplicitous, dangerous and really a disaster for women. You can tell from Ohio that I am very, this is very personal for me because I know that he is -- he is a supporter of a national abortion ban. And we're the state where we have the 10- year-old, great victim that had to flee the state to get the care that she needed. And this is a no exceptions, no exceptions national abortion bans. So that just gives you a taste what we can expect from a J.D. Vance vice presidency.
 
COATES: And yet, Donald Trump has been touting him and the idea that he has populous positions to win over places like Ohio, obviously and other Rustbelt states. Do you think that his positions from the people you speak to in your own constituents could be swayed by his inclusion on the ticket in places like Ohio or Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, all key battleground states that Biden has to win to get reelected?
 
BROWN: What I know about Ohio voters is when they test drove project 2025 in August of last year when they tried to suppress and silence the voices of the voters by removing the simple majority. And when they tried to push an initiative issue one to take away women's reproductive rights. The voters in Ohio showed up in record numbers.
 
So we'll keep in the voters get the information and they find out who J.D. Vance really is and what he represents. They will show up and they will vote but they will be voting for President Biden and Vice President Harris.
 
COATES: You know, the -- the theme today has been many but one of the words I keep hearing time and time again has been unity, Congresswoman. And tonight, Republicans are trying to put on display of unity. They even brought out people who we all remember were fierce critics of Trump as recently as a few months ago who are now endorsing him. And they're now making the point that look at us versus them.
 
The Democrats are not united around Biden's nomination. Are you worried about debate about whether Biden should remain on the top of the ticket will hurt the Democratic Party's chances come November?
 
BROWN: Well, I'm reminded of Clinton's famous expression is that there's only two ways to run and that's unopposed or scared. And we're certainly seeing that this is a scary time in the country when you have candidates like Donald Trump and J.D. Vance pushing their project 2025. So that is what worries me more than anything that President Biden has done. When I look at these two candidates, what we know is at the top of the ticket, we have individuals that have records and the best indicator of future behavior is past behavior.
 
So when I think about what we withstood when we were under the presidency of Donald Trump, where it was chaos and confusion, where he denied the pandemic and led us into a state where we lost millions of lives and people were shuttered in their homes, and businesses were closing compared to the Biden-Harris administration, who got shots in arms, opened up businesses, made investments in roads, rip roads, railways and bridges and making sure people have access to high speed broadband internet, all of the things that are going to continue to help make progress. The choice is crystal clear to me.
 
So yes, I think the voters are smart. I think when they are given the information, they will be able to see that this is more than about a person who is a great but more so about an administration that has been a great deliver and I can show certainly say with confidence as a person who had the privilege of voting for that bipartisan infrastructure law that's delivering for people and will continue to deliver for decades to come, that the Biden Harris ticket is the best ticket to choose from.
 <br>[01:25:19] COATES: You have been consistent, Congresswoman, about the choice being quite clear that who should be on the ticket, the Biden-Harris ticket and the support that should be extended to Democratic voters and -- and those who are incumbents. But there are still some lawmakers even tonight, we're learning reporting that they're urging the DNC to maybe even slow down the virtual nomination process and set the start in just a few days. And continue the discussions around Biden's candidacy. Would you support maybe pausing a beat or you think, look, we're going straight, this is the ticket.
 
BROWN: This is definitely the ticket and what -- what I trust is I trust our chairman, Jaime Harrison. I -- I know that we have processes and protocols in place looks and no one is promised tomorrow, God forbid something should happen to President Biden, we do have a plan B, and it's called the vice president and her name is Kamala Harris.
 
And so the people that are panicked and the people that are having this -- this illusion that we should be looking at another nominee at this hour, just does not make sense to me. It is impractical. But what I will say is that we have to run our own ranks here. There's going to be 435 of us up for reelection. And we have to focus, you know, the expression all politics is local. So we got to get on the ground. Stop worrying, start working, stop whining so we can start winning.
 
COATES: Congresswoman Shontel Brown, a pleasure to have you on tonight. Thank you.
 
BROWN: Thank you Laura.
 
COATES: Ahead, new polling shows major problems for President Biden in multiple key states. And the question now is, is that going to call and he will new calls for him to step aside?
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[01:30:17] 
 
LAURA COATES, CNN HOST: We're here at the CNN Political Grill in Milwaukee where the RNC just held Day 2 of their convention. 
 
Ashley and Liam are back with me and joining us Olivia Beavers congressional reporter for "Politico" and CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten also here today. 
 
I mean first of all, this is a huge moment in time that we're having this discussion, that we're talking about the RNC convention. And then meanwhile, Democrats are still talking about maybe who should be on the top of the ticket.
 
First of all, I want to ask you because Biden is going to have to campaign against a very different Republican Party than yesteryears, isn't he? 
 
OLIVIA BEAVERS, CONGRESSIONAL REPORTER, POLITICO: He is, and I mean, I've covered Republicans who have wanted to be this united for a long time. They saw leadership fights, they saw clashes with Donald Trump. Now they're seeing a new hybrid improved version which is Donald Trump
 
 is not going after, doing these revenge tours, doing sort of petty fights. 
 
He's at least -- he's listening to congressional leaders when they say please don't endorse this guy or please support this guy. We need them to win the House or to win the Senate. 
 
And they think because he's sort of shifted, he's held back, he's got a team around him that's really sort of reined-in some of the worst instincts in their minds. They think that they have a stronger chance heading into November.
 
COATES: Well, we'll see if that's actually the case. 
 
And Harry on the polling, you know, you have been looking at these issues. There's a new reporting on funding and polling funded by some Democratic donors that shows there's some pretty big trouble for Biden. 
 
What do you know?
 
HARRY ENTEN, CNN SENIOR DATA REPORTER: I mean, look, we look at that internal polling that, you know, we've been looking at. And it essentially shows a few things. 
 
Number one, that Joe Biden is in deep trouble and not just in those traditional swing states that we're talking about. You know, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, you go now to the Sunbelt, Arizona, Georgia, and Nevada.
 
We're talking about the sort of light bluish states, right? Like New Hampshire, Virginia -- states that in the olden days might have been thought of as more swingy but states that Joe Biden easily carried in 2020. 
 
And that I think is the big issue that Democrats are sort of looking at is they're saying, wait a minute, if Joe Biden is not just in trouble in these traditional battleground states, but he's in trouble in these states where Democrats have carried, at least during the Trump era, what are the down-ballot effects? 
 
And then also, are there other Democrats who could potentially do better? And you know, some of this internal polling has tested a number of these different candidates. And some of them do in fact, do better than Joe Biden. 
 
Interestingly enough, in the internal polling that was released, Kamala Harris's name wasn't tested. 
 
COATES: Right? 
 
ENTENT: What are we doing here because at the end of the day if Joe Biden in this magical world that some Democratic donors are hoping where some candidate comes down from the ceiling as if propelled by an angel and comes and saves the Democratic Party. If it's going to be anyone, it's going to be the vice president, ok?
 
 And the fact that she's not included in this makes me think that this is more fantasy than perhaps actual realism.
 
COATES: That gave me real "Grease Beauty School Dropout" vibes didn't it, with the guardian angel? I got to tell you, that was a good rendition of what's going on.
 
ENTEN: Thank you very much. I love "Grease". 
 
COATES: I do too.
 
ENTEN: I feel like I'm John Travolta.
 
COATES: All right. Well, I would've said Kenickie, but that's fine. 
 
ENTEN: Whatever.
 
COATES: I'm good with it.
 
Let me ask you this though, Ashley, because the goalpost was he's got to get out there more. Biden's got to get out there more. He's got to show people that it was a one-off from the debate. 
 
He has been out there. He is out there a lot. He's been interviewing. He's been talking to people. He's actually been meeting and campaigning. 
 
And here he (INAUDIBLE) interview with CBS and also BET.
 
Listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Look, I originally ran, you may remember that I said I was going to be a transitional candidate. 
 
I thought that I'd be able to move from this, just pass it on to someone else. But I didn't anticipate things getting so, so, so divided.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COATES: Does this help make his case or help for the Republicans.
 
ASHLEY ALLISON, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I don't know. I mean, I think -- look -- 
 
COATES: Here only honest at 1:00 a.m. here on CNN. But I do love it.
 
ALLISON: But I get -- ok. I don't actually know and I don't think anybody knows, right. 
 
COATES: I trust you more because you've said that.
 
ALLISON: I'm honest. I mean, here's the thing. The last four to five years of politics, it has been less -- it's been indicators and there've been outcome. 
 
In 2022, everybody -- Joe Biden's polling numbers were low. His approval rating was low. Everybody said there were going to be there was going to be a red wave. All the indicators said Dems were going to have a really bad night. The outcomes proved the indicators wrong.
 <br>[01:34:55]
 
ALLISON: In 2023, Joe Biden had a terrible approval rating. His numbers were low. The indicators said that we shouldn't have been able to get the House and the Senate in Virginia, that Ohio shouldn't have been able to pass a constitutional amendment on abortion, that Kentucky shouldn't have kept Democratic Governor, that Kansas shouldn't have had an abortion ban. So the indicators were saying Dems are going to lose and the outcome, Dems are winning. 
 
So the reason why I think the Biden ecosystem and Joe Biden himself are saying I'm not really paying attention to the indicators right now because the outcomes have proven wrong over and over again. 
 
Is he going to be right? Time will tell, but that is what I think is actually playing out. And I think some folks are not really -- some folks are having a little amnesia about what has happened over the last couple of years as well. 
 
COATES: Liam.
 
LIAM DONOVAN, FORMER NATIONAL REPUBLICAN SENATORIAL COMMITTEE AIDE: Well, just to capitalize on what Ashley said, not only have the indicators in recent years been contradictory with the outcomes, Joe Biden deeply in his bones feels that it has been in his destiny over the last half-century. 
 
He feels that he has to prove people wrong at every he turn. So the idea that you're going to appeal to him with polling and models suggesting that he can't do it is -- 
 
(CROSSTALKING)
 
ENTEN: This to me is the interesting thing. 
 
You have pundits appearing on television networks, not that I'm saying any of us are like that, saying one thing and then perhaps you have the polling that says another thing, right? 
 
If you go back to 2022, there were a lot of pundits who were saying red wave, red wave -- 
 
ALLISON: I did not.
 
ENTEN: Red wave. 
 
I'm not saying you, but I'm saying some of us -- 
 
ALLISON: Just saying.
 
ENTEN: -- some of us. 
 
But if you look at the national generic congressional ballot, it always indicated a relatively tight race for the House of Representatives. And that's exactly what we got.
 
Yes, in some Senate races, it did tend to underestimate some of the Democratic candidate, but the higher-quality polling actually did pretty gosh darn good. 
 
What we're seeing this time around is the pundits are saying one thing that actually for the most part lines up with the polling, not perfectly. I will say that I think the polling is a little less bearish on Joe Biden than the punditry is. But it's still pretty gosh darn bad. 
 
BEAVERS: This is a very different situation than we've seen in recent past. So we can compare them, but it's apples to oranges.
 
Just last week when I was leaving a bar after having dinner, a member I ran into a House member, a Democrat, and he was sitting with some other House Democrats and he said we're just talking about when we're going to be releasing our statement saying we no longer support Joe Biden, sort of in a pre-baked, we have made our decision, we're scared about where the party is heading. 
 
And so whether what he says in a certain interview helps or hurts him, gaffes don't hurt, but there's been some decisions that are being made. 
 
I think the attempt on Donald Trump's life put that on pause, but I don't think it has gone away. 
 
COATES: We'll have to see. Everyone, please standby. 
 
We've got more questions tonight for the Secret Service. New reporting revealing that a sniper team saw the Trump shooter looking at them through a rangefinder in the lead up to the shooting. It's unbelievable. 
 
We'll talk about it next. 
 <br>[01:37:57]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
COATES: Well tonight, a warning from the FBI and Department of Homeland Security. The agency saying in an intelligence (INAUDIBLE) obtained by CNN, they are concerned about follow-on or retaliatory attacks in response to the attempted assassination of the former president Donald Trump. 
 
And on the investigation front, we're learning more about the shooter's movements before the attack occurred. Law enforcement sources telling CNN that he requested off time from work to attend the Trump rally on Saturday, telling his boss he had set, quote, "something to do". Those sources all say the shooter first raised suspicion when he
 
 passed through a magnetometer at the rally carrying a rangefinder. Security personnel then kept an eye on him until he left the secure area. 
 
Now from there, investigators are unsure of where the shooter went, but the operating theory is that when he did that, he left, he went to his car, then retrieved the rifle.
 
Later one of the counter sniper teams observed the shooter looking at their position through the rangefinder. A law enforcement saying, quote, "they were looking at him while he was looking at them."
 
Direct to Daniel Brunner, a retired FBI special agent. Daniel, this is pretty unbelievable to think about how this is unfolding. With everything we know so far, do you believe Secret Service made some serious mistakes here? 
 
DANIEL BRUNNER, RETIRED FBI SPECIAL AGENT: Yes. Good evening, Laura. Thanks for having me on.
 
Absolutely there were mistakes that were made. Of course, there were holes in the -- in the investigation, there were holes in the security and that's what the investigation that the FBI is leading will determine. Find out what the gaps, where the holes were. 
 
If it's true that he was looking at the sniper, the counter sniper teams with a rangefinder that should have been quite alarming activity that these snipers should have been zeroed in on him, and keeping an eye on him, and continue to tracking him. 
 
Most sniper teams have a spotter and a person on the rifle, those two individuals could have at least called it out and moved in ground units to go interview him, go vet it -- the threat, figure out what the suspicious person is doing and seeing what their activity is and mitigate the threat.
 
Fortunately, obviously mistakes were made and whether it be communication errors, those are things that need to be determined.
 
COATES: I mean, the idea of a rangefinder alone, it's not just binoculars, that should have sent up a red flag in and of itself going through a magnetometer, I would imagine. 
 
But Secret Service director is also answering the key question from the events on Saturday. I want you to listen to her explanation for why there wasn't any law enforcement on the roof where the shooter attempted the assassination.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KIMBERLY CHEATLE, SECRET SERVICE DIRECTOR: That building in particular has a sloped roof at its highest point. 
 
And so, you know, there's a, safety factor that would be considered there that we wouldn't want to put somebody up on a sloped roof. And so, you know, the decision was made to secure the building from inside.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COATES: But here's one of the sniper teams protecting the former president on what seems to be a slope roof. 
 
So what is she saying. Does that make sense to you? 
 
BRUNNER: It really doesn't make sense to me. Saying that it has a slightly sloped roof in any of their photograph right there with those sniper teams are on a sloped roof as a much sharper upturn.
 
I think that there's lots of questions that need to be asked. And one of the things is ok, so if you can't have somebody on the roof, why weren't the accesses to that roof secured? Why weren't the ladders secured? Why wasn't there someone posted to the areas surrounding the area? 
 <br>[01:44:52]
 
BRUNNER: There's lots of questions, lots of gaps. If there's a ladder there, why wasn't it wrapped up? Why wasn't there a local police officer marked on it? 
 
But I think that the response that the director gave was a -- caused more -- created more questions when you see that counter-sniper teams, as you pointed out, Laura.
 
COATES: Daniel Brunner, it's so important to hear your perspective and have those questions raised. Will they be answered, though? Thank you so much for joining us. 
 
BRUNNER: Thank you.
 
COATES: Well, JD Vance, that newly-named VP running mate will talk tomorrow on Day 3 of the RNC. But we're about to hear an impression of Trump's VP pick in just a moment. 
 
The man of many voices, comedian Matt Friend is here with a beard and a big debut, next.

PASTOR JIM ROEMKE, MESSIAH LUTHERAN CHURCH, KENOSHA: And if I may, before the benediction, give you this promise. You're going to be so blessed, you are going to be tired of being blessed. I guarantee it.

 <br>[01:49:51]
 
COATES: Well, we heard that Trump impression last night. But so far, no one has done Trump's VP pick Senator JD Vance. That is until tonight, because comedian Matt Friend is here to debut -- oh wait, is that Senator Vance. Come on.
 
MATT FRIEND, COMEDIAN: Yes. Well, it's an honor to be with you. I was just finishing putting my eyeliner on. 
 
Now, it's just a thrill to be the first Republican candidate for vice president with a real beard unlike Tim Scott, who has a different type of beard.
 
But anyways I just wanted to say that I know people are frustrated. 
 
COATES: Oh no. 
 
FRIEND: They're frustrated that I compare Donald Trump to Hitler. And the real -- the reality is, I did that because the three of us are all authors. The holy trinity of literature, "Mein Kampf", my book "Hillbilly Elegy" and "The Art of the Deal". So there you go, America. 
 
Are you a racist? There you go. That's my ad. Thank you.
 
COATES: Well there you go. Well, that beard is coming off of -- 
 
FRIEND: It's coming off. This is the worst -- 
 
COATES: -- Senator Mitch McConnell -- 
 
FRIEND: -- tape job. 
 
COATES: -- I mean he actually got booed. He got booed last night. Did you see that? 
 
FRIEND: Well, listen, I did. I did see the booing. There it is. You're going to rub it in my face, CNN, aren't you. 
 
Well, that's enough. 
 
COATES: That's a little uncanny.
 
FRIEND: The reason -- the reason I got booed, Laura is because simply for my whole career, I have only done what is best for the people of America. And to President Biden, I would offer this simple advice. you're too old for the -- 
 
COATES: Oh my goodness -- you got -- my panel is here right now looking at this right now, and they're laughing on the side of me. 
 
You're not getting out of this, people, thank you very much. 
 
FRIEND: I'm sorry. 
 
COATES: There's a footage of a phone call between presidential candidate RFK Jr. and Trump that leaked today. Did you see that?
 
COATES: Well -- well, Laura, I saw that call and frankly, it's a total disaster that it got leaked because I spoke to RFK and RFK would be a fantastic secretary of state maybe. But RFK told me to tell you that -- I actually didn't leak it. It was my son who leaked that. It wasn't
 
 me. I had nothing to do -- 
 
But RFK told me he should really never have done that. Bobby was a supporter. 
 
I actually never formally endorsed you.
 
But anyways, Bobby, stop talking. It never should have been leaked. There's way too many leaks, not the kind of Russian leak I like in the shower. That's a different type.
 
COATES: Oh, my gosh.
 
FRIEND: But we're going to -- let's talk about something else, Laura. Let's keep it respectful ok. 
 
COATES: Do you want to because I mean, Lara Trump -- speaking of Lara is also -- we had our own impression of the former president, and we listened and she is -- 
 
FRIEND: Yes, I saw it.
 
(CROSSTALKING)
 
COATES: Here she is.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LAURA TRUMP, CO-CHAIR, REPUBLICAN PARTY: When I was given an opportunity to join a television network as a commentator, it was the push and support of my father-in-law that gave me the confidence to take that job.
 
Always the first one to call or text me after a V hit and tell me, great job. Keep going. Not bad, right? 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FRIEND: Well, I would say -- 
 
COATES: How'd she do? 
 
FRIEND: Well, excuse me, ok. I would say in fact, it was pretty terrible mild at best. I've always said that perhaps if Laura weren't my daughter-in-law I'd be dating her, she's a looker. She looks fantastic. Little too much work, but I will tell you she looks great. 
 
She's a beautiful woman and she never should have done that because I don't try to do her like that. It's very rude but I support it. I'm appreciative. And she fights for our country. Thank you very much. 
 
COATES: I want you to know the world at the exact moment of that impression someone spoke in my ear as a producer, so if you said something untoward, I did not hear it. Thank you very much. 
 
Matt Friend, nice to see you again. 
 
FRIEND: I love doing -- I love doing 2:00 a.ma. comedy. It's really ideal, isn't it.
 
COATES: Is there any other type? 
 
Thank you very much. Panel -- 
 
FRIEND: You're the best.
 
COATES: -- come back in just a moment here. 
 
You're the best -- besides what happened just now, what was your best moment of the night? 
 
Let's go in order.
 
You, Liam.
 
DONOVAN: I thought Rubio did a really good job. Well, Haley hit the tone right on the nose, but I think the story that Rubio was able to tell in personal terms about the victim of the assassination on Saturday was probably the peak of the night. 
 
COATES: I'm sorry, I wasn't clear. All of you must do the impersonation of who you actually speaking about.
 
DONOVAN: Oh my dear.
 
COATES: Go ahead, Ashley.
 
ALLISON: My favorite was baby dog -- the bulldog because I have a bulldog and so I just thought it was cute. 
 
I couldn't -- I had actually never seen that governor with their dog like that. And so I was like, oh my God, there's a bulldog and I feel like it's an underrepresented dog breed in a politics. So I was sad to see it. 
 
COATES: Why are you smiling, Harry. 
 
ENTEN: I'm smiling because I'm a dog afficionado myself. I love dogs. In fact, it was my girlfriend's birthday just ended, I guess, two hours ago on the East Coast and I got her a whole bunch of Cavalier King Charles paraphernalia. She loves King Charles. And I love you. 
 <br>[01:54:55]
 
COATES: Oh my God, do we have a good moment happening? 
 
Ok, top that.
 
MARK PRESTON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: I speak on behalf of America. I speak on behalf of everybody on this panel. And if I don't, I speak on behalf of me. 
 
Thank God. They gaveled out tonight. It was the end of the night. We can all go home and go to bed.
 
ENTEN: There you go. Good night.
 
COATES: Matt Friend, thank you. And thanks to everyone on the panel, we even got to kiss blown from Harry Enten. 
 
Wow, what a night. Thank you for watching.
 
CNN's coverage of the RNC continues, next.
