THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: Hello everyone. Happy Friday Eve. I`m Coy Wire. It`s Thursday, October 10th. This is CNN 10, where I simply tell you the 
 
 what, letting you decide what to think. 
 
Now we want to start today with another update on Hurricane Milton, which at the time of this show`s taping was set to make landfall on Florida`s 
 
 Gulf Coast overnight on Wednesday.
 
Milton is expected to continue on its path across the Florida peninsula. For the most up-to-date information on its strength, the size and impact, 
 
 you can head to cnn.com. 
 
Now Milton`s massive size could make it one of the most destructive storms on record. By Wednesday morning, the tropical storm force winds nearly 
 
 doubled from 80 miles to 140 miles wide from its center, spreading its disastrous impacts over a much larger area. 
 
Tornado warnings were already in effect before landfall because of the tropical storm winds from Milton`s outer bands. Florida`s Gulf Coast is 
 
 particularly vulnerable with large population centers on low-lying land or barrier islands.
 
Many of those islands off the coast were under evacuation orders and had bridges leading to them that were closed. Officials urged residents to 
 
 leave because rescue personnel will not be able to get to them for some time as the storm passes through. 
 
And while most folks in evacuation zones did leave, some did choose to stay and ride out the storm. The water danger in this storm is frightening, and 
 
 not just for the coast. Parts of the peninsula are expected to see two months` worth of rain for the duration of the storm. A high risk of flash 
 
 flooding has been issued for areas all the way on the other side of the state along the Atlantic coast.
 
The most concerning factor, officials are calling Hurricane Milton`s expected storm surge or the rise in water level caused by the storm 
 
 unsurvivable. A 10-to-15-foot wall of water is forecast for certain areas along the coast. CNN`s Kate Bolduan shows us why that has experts on alert.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR: One of the biggest concerns with Hurricane Milton is storm surge. The National Weather Service forecasting life-threatening 
 
 storm surge levels here. So the basics, a storm surge is rapid rise in water levels caused by strong winds pushing water onshore.
 
In parts of Florida, we`re talking 12 to 15 feet of water from this storm in a surge. And I want to give you an idea of what that really means beyond 
 
 just the numbers. This shows you a storm surge of about two feet.
 
At this level, low-lying coastal roads would be inundated with water. The next stage would be surge of five to eight feet. This is enough to submerge 
 
 cars.
 
But remember, Milton is expected to bring much worse storm surge of 10 plus feet in places. And this is taller than a city bus. The average first floor 
 
 of a commercial building is typically around 14 feet high and Milton storm surge could reach a foot higher than that.

WIRE: Now to TikTok, where the app is facing more legal pressure. A bipartisan group, or a group consisting of both Democrats and Republicans, 
 
 filed lawsuits this week against the platform. The group consists of 14 attorneys general from across the country who allege the app has addicted 
 
 young people and harmed their mental health.
 
The lawsuits pointed at some classic TikTok elements in their arguments, like endless scrolling content and TikTok challenges. The lawsuits are the 
 
 latest legal pressure facing TikTok, which is also battling a law that could see it banned in the United States. 
 
CNN`s Clare Duffy has more on this and TikTok`s response.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CLARE DUFFY, CNN BUSINESS WRITER: Yeah, these lawsuits take aim at a wide range of TikTok`s business practices and features that these attorneys 
 
 general say can harm young users` mental health and well-being. Things like the endlessly scrolling feed that they say can keep users scrolling to see 
 
 what the next video is going to be. Late night notifications that can interrupt teen sleep.
 
And they claim that TikTok has failed to do enough to address so-called TikTok challenges. These viral video trends where teens try to replicate 
 
 videos created by other users and can sometimes be encouraged to engage in dangerous behavior. TikTok has repeatedly said that its platform is safe 
 
 for children. This is not the first time that it`s faced claims like this. 
 
A spokesperson told me today that the company strongly disagrees with the claims and they pointed to new features that the platform has rolled out in 
 
 the past few years. Things like a default screen time limit for teens, default privacy protections for teens under the age of 16, and parental 
 
 oversight tools.
 
But these state attorneys general clearly think that those things are not enough.

WIRE: Ten-second trivia. 
 
Most known asteroids are within the asteroid belt located between the orbits of what two planets in our solar system? 
 
Saturn and Jupiter, Jupiter and Mars, Earth and Venus, or Venus and Mercury.
 
If you said Jupiter and Mars, use a star. That`s where millions of asteroids can be found. 
 
Some outer space news now. A unique mission is now underway to see if NASA`s attempt to redirect an asteroid in the name of planetary defense was 
 
 successful. NASA`s Double Asteroid Redirection Test, or DART mission, was a first of its kind asteroid deflection technique that was used two years ago 
 
 in an attempt to alter the path of an asteroid named Dimorphos. NASA crashed a spacecraft into the asteroid at 13,645 miles per hour to test its 
 
 plan to defend planet Earth against potential future impacts.
 
And now a European spacecraft and two shoebox-sized satellites have launched to survey the results of NASA`s DART mission. We`ll need to wait a 
 
 while though before we hear those results. The spacecraft and its two CubeSat companions are slated to arrive at Dimorphos and the larger 
 
 asteroid it orbits named Didymos in late 2026. They`ll conduct an investigation at the crash scene to see whether or not their attempt to 
 
 redirect this asteroid was a success. 
 
All right, we have heard a lot about emerging and potential uses of artificial intelligence lately, but here`s one that`s news to me. We soon 
 
 may have the ability to wear AI. Technical outerwear brand Arc`teryx and wearable technology startup Skip teamed up to create a pair of pants that 
 
 basically give your legs robo power. They do a lot of the work for you. They`re calling their gear movewear, but they could also say they`re giving 
 
 whole new meaning to the term fancy pants.
 
Check it out.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over): These aren`t your ordinary hiking pants. They contain a battery powered exoskeleton to help you get outdoors. 
 
 They`re the first of a new type of clothing the creators are calling movewear.
 
KATHRYN ZEALAND, CO-FOUNDER AND CEO, SKIP: The same way that sleepwear is something that you wear when you want to sleep, movewear is something that 
 
 you wear when you want to move. 
 
ANNA ROUMIANTSEVA, CO-FOUNDER AND CHIEF PRODUCT OFFICER, SKIP: You can think of it like an e-bike for walking.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The pants are called MO/GO, which is short -- 
 
CAM STUART, MANAGER RESEARCH &amp; ENGINEERING, ADVANCED CONCEPT TEAM, ARC`TERYX: -- for Mountain Goat, an animal that we think sort of embodies 
 
 the sort of motivations and abilities that this would give you.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: MO/GO is the result of a four-year collaboration between technical outerwear brand Arc`teryx, best known for its waterproof Gore-Tex 
 
 shell jackets, and wearable technology startup Skip.
 
ROUMIANTSEVA: On the way up, it really kind of offloads some of those big muscle groups that are working their hardest. You like to say it gives you 
 
 about 40% more power in your legs on the way up with every step.
 
STUART: And then supports their knees on the way down.
 
ZEALAND: There`s a lot of artificial intelligence built into these pants. 
 
ROUMIANTSEVA: It understands how you move, predicts how you`re going to want to move next, and then assists you in doing that so that the assistant 
 
 doesn`t feel like you`re walking to the beat of the robot or is moving independently. 
 
ZEALAND: And so that`s where a lot of the real cutting-edge technology is. There`ve been a lot of developments in exoskeletons, right, but they`re all 
 
 in an academic lab or in a hospital. So, you know, the hospital will spend $100,000 to get an exoskeleton that`s very capable, but then the user only 
 
 gets it for 30 minutes every week.
 
STUART: I think when people think about an exoskeleton, they think about this, you know, big bionic frame, or they think it`s like Avatar or 
 
 something like that. 
 
The challenge for us really was how do we put that in a pair of pants? It was a lot easier for someone to wrap their head around or to put their legs 
 
 in, so to speak.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Skip and the advanced concepts team at Arc`teryx created prototype after prototype.
 
STUART: Like every little element of it, we`ve just obsessed over it. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And ran test after test.
 
ROUMIANTSEVA: We`ve done a lot of work to make a lot of the complicated, sophisticated technology that goes into it look and feel as approachable 
 
 and as similar to a garment as possible, and so -- 
 
ZEALAND: Maybe you think about them like a pair of pants.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: MO/GO isn`t the only recreational exoskeleton hitting the market. Companies like Dnsys and HyperShell have developed their own 
 
 lightweight exoskeletons through Kickstarter campaigns. And of course, the price for powered pants isn`t cheap. MO/GO expects to be released in 2025 
 
 for $5,000.
 
ROUMIANTSEVA: Movement and mobility, it`s such a huge driver of quality of life. It`s such a huge driver of joy. And it does become a luxury, right? 
 
 And that`s a huge part of why we`re building what we`re building is we don`t think it should be.

WIRE: Today`s story, getting a 10 out of 10, a woman who got blocked out of her house by raccoons, a whole slew of raccoons. A Washington resident said 
 
 she`d been given a couple of raccoons, some late-night snacks, but apparently word of the snacks traveled fast because before she knew it, she 
 
 had a whole tribe of furry masked friends staring her down, waiting around, and there got to be so many of them and some aggressive to the point that 
 
 she had to call the police to help her get inside of her home. That`s just raccoon-diculous. 
 
All right, everyone. Time for our shout out of the day. The Falcons in San Ramon, California at Windemere Ranch Middle School, rise up. 
 
Thanks to all of you for spending part of your day with me here on CNN 10. I`m Coy Wire. I look forward to being right back here with you tomorrow.
