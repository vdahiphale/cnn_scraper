DAVID FOLKENFLIK, NPR MEDIA CORRESPONDENT:  -- that Trump essentially intervened to block a $10 billion contract. So, Bezos has interest there 
 
 that some people are saying may have influenced his decisions.
 
JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR:  Wow. 200,000 cancellations is huge. David Folkenflik with NPR, thank you so much for bringing us that breaking news. 
 
 The news continues on CNN with Wolf Blitzer in The Situation Room. I'll see you tomorrow.
 
JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN ANCHOR, FIRST MOVE:  It's 7:00 a.m. in Tokyo, 3:00 p.m. in Los Angeles, and 6:00 p.m. here in New York. I'm Julia Chatterley. 
 
 And wherever you are in the world, this is your "First Move."
 
And a warm welcome to "First Move." As always, here's today's need to know. Campaign controversy, Donald Trump's team, distancing itself from racist 
 
 rhetoric used at a rally in New York. Aid access. Israel passing laws to severely limit the U.N.'s made aid agency from providing support in Gaza 
 
 and in the West Bank. Japanese jolt. Japan's ruling LDP Party losing its majority for the first time in 15 years. And Empire State Showdown. Shohei 
 
 Ohtani shrugging off injury to start for the L.A. Dodgers taking on the Yankees in Game 3 of the World Series. All that and plenty more coming up.
 
But first, eight days until the U.S. presidential election and this final full week he's going to feature many last-ditch efforts by Kamala Harris 
 
 and Donald Trump to grab undecided voters. Both candidates are in battleground states today. The vice president in Michigan, she's putting 
 
 manufacturing at the center of her closing message. The former president speaking at a rally at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, following remarks at the 
 
 National Faith Summit in one of the city's suburbs. He continues to target Harris on immigration policy and on the economy. It comes after a 
 
 controversial rally in New York this weekend.

DAVID REM, NEW YORK CITY SANITATION WORKER AND TRUMP'S CHILDHOOD FRIEND:  She is the devil, whoever screamed that out. She is the antichrist.
 
SID ROSENBERG, RADIO PERSONALITY:  Americans sleeping on their own feces on a bench in Central Park. But the -- illegals, they get whatever they want.
 
GRANT CARDONE, BUSINESSMAN:  Her and her pimp handlers will destroy our country.
 
TUCKER CARLSON, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  Kamala Harris, she's just -- she got 85 million votes because she's just so impressive. As the first Samoan, 
 
 Malaysian, low IQ, former California prosecutor ever to be elected president.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHATTERLEY:  Both the Trump campaign and other Republicans raising concerns about the rhetoric, especially tied to this comment.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TONY HINCHCLIFFE, COMEDIAN/TRUMP RALLY SPEAKER:  I don't know if you guys know this, but there's literally a floating island of garbage in the middle 
 
 of the ocean right now. Yes. I think it's called Puerto Rico.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHATTERLEY:  Trump's campaign has said the joke about Puerto Rico, quote, "does not reflect Trump's views." Here's what Kamala Harris had to say 
 
 about the Trump rally.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE:  This is not new about him, by the way. What he did last night 
 
 is not a discovery. It is just more of the same and maybe more vivid than usual. Donald Trump spends full time trying to have Americans point their 
 
 finger at each other. Fans the fuel of hate and division. And that's why people are exhausted with him.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHATTERLEY:  Greg Valliere is Chief U. S. Policy Strategist for AGF Investments and he joins us now. Greg, fantastic to have you with us. That 
 
 was just a snapshot of that rally in Madison Square Garden, just to be clear, and arguably this is not the first comedian that makes questionable 
 
 racist jokes at some kind of event, not that I'm excusing them. What did you make of that Madison Square Garden rally? Does it help or hinder the 
 
 Trump campaign?
 
GREG VALLIERE, CHIEF U.S. POLICY STRATEGIST, AGF INVESTMENTS:  Well, first of all, great to see you. I think that these alleged comedians were not 
 
 real strong on subtlety and I think that they hurt Trump's prospects. It's still obviously a very, very close race, but the -- these comedians were so 
 
 appallingly racist and ugly that they may have made a slight difference. It may have hurt Trump a bit.
 
CHATTERLEY:  You've long called this an unserious election campaign, dominated by debates over who's a fascist, their name calling. Even in 
 
 these last few weeks, we've seen the Harris campaign certainly make this about democracy, perhaps to a greater extent than policy, a mistake or just 
 
 part of the way that this works.
 
VALLIERE:  Well, I hate to sound cynical, but I think both Trump and Harris have not been as serious as you'd like to see on issue after issue. For 
 
 example, the staggering U.S. budget deficit, neither Trump nor Harris have talked about cutting spending. That's just isn't on the table.
 <br>[18:05:00]
 
There are other issues as well. Protectionism of tariffs, a wide range of issues, taxes that the candidates just have not talked about. So, I say 
 
 it's not a serious election because it's mostly about insults.
 
CHATTERLEY:  To your point, though, and you've traveled the nation for the last month and you write about this in your daily and you have made some 
 
 predictions and you've said, look, if Harris ultimately loses the postmortem is going to be about the focus on the border and what took place 
 
 there and also that she didn't sell the message that she was the change candidate, that she didn't distinguish herself enough from the Biden 
 
 campaign.
 
What will be the postmortem on Trump in the reverse? Will it be sort of the rhetoric, the fact that he lost it for himself with some of the comments 
 
 that he makes or something specific perhaps on policy too?
 
VALLIERE:  Yes, I think that both candidates get plenty of blame. I think Trump obviously has very, very great support among his base. But at the 
 
 same time, I think that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were asleep when it came to immigration. They did not realize soon enough what a huge issue it 
 
 was. Other issues as well. So, there's plenty of blame, Julia, to go around. No question about that.
 
But I would also say, it's still too early to make a final call. So, I think that it's still possible that Harris could win. It's -- you look at 
 
 the polls state by state, most states are one point, two point leads for one candidate or another. So, this is still an election that is winnable 
 
 for either one of them.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Do you think it's Trump's to lose, Greg, at this stage? I mean, I don't know how much we trust the polls at this stage, but a lot of 
 
 experts say to me, at this stage, you would want the Democrats to be three to four percentage points overall in the poll of polls ahead, just because 
 
 of the sort of shy vote quality that the former president tends to see. Would you agree with that or you're just not comfortable saying based on 
 
 how close it is?
 
VALLIERE:  Well, I am comfortable saying that I have my doubts about the poll takers.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Right. Everyone does.
 
VALLIERE:  I think the poll takers don't -- I think they don't have a handle on the big issue, which is turnout. You know, what if on Election 
 
 Day, on November 5th, it's snowing or sleeting or really cold, that could have a huge impact. How many people answer the phone on a landline could 
 
 have a huge impact. There are all sorts of variables. And I think the poll takers are a little bit too arrogant when they say, well, our poll is 
 
 within 3.2 percent of being accurate. Who knows? It's -- the poll takers give you an educated guess, but they don't understand, in my opinion, the 
 
 issue of turn out.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Both parties are preparing to challenge the results, whatever they look like, and that's going to be worsened by close votes, 
 
 particularly in the swing states, Greg, as you're well aware. How long does it take, in your estimate, to get a result and a clear result that's no 
 
 longer challenged?
 
VALLIERE:  Yes. Well, I would make the argument and I have been making the argument that we will wake up the day after on the 6th not knowing who won. 
 
 I think we could go a week or two or three before we know for sure who won. I think there will be recounts. There will be charges of irregularities. 
 
 There will certainly be litigation. You can be sure of that. There'll be lawsuits going into the holiday season, probably. So, it's an election that 
 
 I think will not be resolved for at least a few weeks.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Wow. This weekend really could be the calm before the storm. Everyone needs to get a lot of rest.
 
VALLIERE:  Yes.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Greg Valliere, great to have you, sir. Thank you so much. All right. In the Middle East now, the Israeli parliament has banned the main 
 
 U.N. agency delivering aid to Palestinians from operating in Israel. The set of laws do not ban UNRWA from operating in the Israeli occupied 
 
 Palestinian territories, but preventing staff and aid from transiting through Israel in turn restricts UNRWA's ability to work effectively in 
 
 Gaza and the occupied West Bank.
 
UNRWA supports around 6 million Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan and elsewhere in the region, providing food, education, and medical 
 
 services. UNRWA's chief says Israel's ban is a violation of international law. Jim Sciutto has more on the ban and the backlash.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF U.S. SECURITY ANALYST:  This move by the Israeli Knesset to prevent UNRWA, the main U.N. agency, for providing humanitarian 
 
 assistance to Gaza from operating inside Israel is receiving broad condemnation, not just from the U.N. but also from other countries around 
 
 the world.
 <br>[18:10:00]
 
The U.S. State Department spokesperson said this is a mistake. It's something that the U.S. opposes. And he said, quote, "there is nobody that 
 
 can replace them, UNRWA, right now in terms of delivering crucial aid."
 
We also heard from the foreign ministers of a number of countries, including Canada, Australia, France, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom 
 
 saying that UNRWA provides essential and lifesaving humanitarian aid. UNRWA itself says that this will only deepen the suffering of Palestinians. It 
 
 goes on to call this the latest in the ongoing campaign to discredit UNRWA.
 
Where does that come from? Well, Israeli lawmakers in passing this new legislation have cited investigations that showed that some members, some 
 
 workers for UNRWA, participated in or were alleged to have participated in the October 7th attacks. Now, UNRWA has said, and even others involved in 
 
 humanitarian work in Gaza that this is a very small number of many thousands of people who work for UNRWA, and of course, they cite the 
 
 ongoing humanitarian crisis there with shortages of food, basic medical care, and now the outbreak of disease.
 
In fact, the U.N. is saying that many people, particularly in the north of Gaza, are now in danger of dying because of that shortage. So, this move by 
 
 the Knesset, though long debated, is getting quite immediate opposition and criticism from around the world.
 
Jim Sciutto, CNN, Jerusalem.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHATTERLEY:  Our thanks to Jim there. Now, straight ahead, Japan's problematic politics. Angry voters sending a strong message to the ruling 
 
 party in snap elections, delivering a stunning defeat for the nation's new prime minister.
 
Plus, giveaway fair play. Elon Musk sued over his $1 million voter sweepstakes. The stunt called an illegal lottery. Musk vows to double down. 
 
 The details, next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHATTERLEY:  Welcome back to "First Move." And in today's Money Move, more treats and tricks for U.S. investors as Halloween and tech earnings arrive 
 
 on Wall Street. U.S. stocks rising thanks in part, at least, to a sharp drop in oil prices. Oil falling more than 5 percent, tied to relief I think 
 
 that Israel did not target Iranian oil facilities during its retaliatory strikes against Tehran Friday.
 <br>[18:15:00]
 
But lots more challenges await investors in the coming days, including key earnings from magnificent seven tech stocks, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Apple, 
 
 and Microsoft too. And fresh jobs data will be released on Friday as well. The last U.S. jobs report before Election Day next week.
 
Now, green arrows across the board in Asia. Solid gains in China, South Korea, and Japan, where the Nikkei rallied almost 2 percent. The Nikkei 
 
 higher after a sharp, sharp drop in the value of the Japanese yen, which helps boost the nation's exports. The sharp moves in the Japanese markets 
 
 coming after this weekend's snap elections.
 
The country plunged into a rare moment of political uncertainty after the ruling LDP Party lost its majority in parliament for the first time in 15 
 
 years. Voters fed up with the high cost-of-living and ongoing political scandals delivering a stinging rebuke to the majority party. Japan's new 
 
 prime minister, who called the snap elections, said message received loud and clear.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SHIGERU ISHIBA, JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  I recognize that the biggest reason is because people's doubts, distrust, and anger 
 
 regarding politics and money have not gone away.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHATTERLEY:  The prime minister saying he will not resign. He now has 30 days to cobble together a coalition government. He could also rule via a 
 
 minority government too. He's also vowed to enact reforms to help clean up politics, but the political uncertainty also raising uncertainty over 
 
 future Bank of Japan interest rate policy too, of course, they have a meeting Thursday this week.
 
Tobias Harris joins us now. He's founder of political risk consultancy, Japan Foresight. Tobias, great to have you with us. First and foremost, in 
 
 this kind of political situation, you would normally have someone who takes responsibility and steps down or removes themselves from the head of the 
 
 party. The prime minister's barely been in charge for a month or so. Can he survive this?
 
TOBIAS HARRIS, FOUNDER AND PRINCIPAL, JAPAN FORESIGHT LLC:  It certainly seems like he might find a way to manage just somehow to get through this. 
 
 And some of it is just because of time. It was very recent. Of course, the last LDP leadership election. I'm not sure how much appetite there is in 
 
 the LDP to go through that again, or even an abbreviated version of that. And I'm not sure how -- if anyone in the LDP really wants to take on the 
 
 challenge that Ishiba has in front of him, you know, trying to put together what could look like a pretty unruly way of forming a government. And so, 
 
 he might be left with the job of doing it.
 
CHATTERLEY:  And what's the most likely scenario for building a coalition, or is a minority government rule an option here? Certainly, the coalition 
 
 partner that they had also lost votes and seats as a result of this election too. So, it's perhaps not as simple as it looks or appears.
 
HARRIS:  So, just depending on how you count the math, they need somewhere between 15 to 18 votes to get to basically to a majority. And really, 
 
 because they do runoff voting in Japan's House of Representatives, they could get away with less than that.
 
And so, the reality is that you are probably going to get a LDP, Komeito (ph) minority government, where you have external partners from the 
 
 opposition side. You have some centers from center right parties with enough votes, and they will cooperate on individual issues, but they've, 
 
 immediately after the election, both those parties, Ishin no Kai, the Japan innovation party, and also the Democratic Party for the people both said, 
 
 we are not interested in joining a coalition government.
 
They have their own internal issues, and they both know that joining the LDP at this moment could be very costly for them. So, they might help the 
 
 LDP on some issues if the LDP plays ball, but they're not going to bail the LDP out by joining a coalition government. And so, it looks like that we 
 
 are now headed towards a minority government.
 
CHATTERLEY:  So, it means, I guess, decisions are going to be harder to reach, policy is going to be harder to implement. What is the most 
 
 immediate impact for policy?
 
HARRIS:  The most immediate impact is probably going to be the stimulus package that the Japanese government was preparing to do already after the 
 
 election towards the end of the year, that's going to end up being a lot bigger, because I think, well, ultimately, what the LDP is going to end up 
 
 doing to make its external cooperation partners happy is taking in some of the things they want included in a stimulus package and adding those.
 
And so, you're going to get a little more fiscal stimulus. You're certainly not going to get some of the discussions of tax hikes that Ishiba said he 
 
 also wanted to do towards the end of the year with the budget for next year in mind. So, you're not going to see a whole lot of move towards fiscal 
 
 discipline. You're not going to see -- you know, you're just going to see - - you're going to see more stimulus. You're going to see more focus really on trying to improve people's qualities -- quality of life. I mean, that is 
 
 really something these opposition parties are especially concerned about, particularly in light of higher inflation. That's what I would expect in 
 
 the near term.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes, and that's the message, arguably, that voters have been sent here as well is that they're not happy. There has been a cost-of-
 
 living crisis and they're stressed and stretched. You mentioned fiscal policy. What about monetary policy then on the other side? I mentioned the 
 
 Bank of Japan meeting this Thursday, they're not expected to lift rates.
 <br>[18:20:00]
 
Do you think this perhaps makes them perhaps slow down their process of raising rates if and when we can? I know it's been challenging up until 
 
 this point, but they can't ignore the weakness that we've seen in the Japanese yen. And particularly, if there's going to be more fiscal 
 
 spending, arguably that, once again, puts greater pressure.
 
HARRIS:  So, I think it's going to cut a few different ways. And so, it's - - you know, it's really hard to say what exactly the bank of Japan is going to do in December, because I think we can safely rule out any change later 
 
 this week.
 
But looking ahead to December, I mean, I think a lot is going to depend on the global economy and BOJ Governor Ueda has been pretty clear that he, you 
 
 know, watching what happens at the U.S., watching what's happening in China. So, global economic conditions are going to matter a lot, you know, 
 
 as well as, of course, just the raw numbers of what you're seeing in Japan's job creation and inflation outlook. I mean, that's going to matter 
 
 more than anything else.
 
And I think if Ueda feels that there is room, I don't think he's going to - - the political situation is going to stop him. And especially if you do have -- if the yen continues to weaken between now and December, the -- you 
 
 know, the concerns that will lead to higher cost push inflation, I think that could also lead the bank to move sooner rather than later.
 
But I think Ueda has said, he feels he has time, he doesn't have to act and I don't think he's going to necessarily be pressured or forced one 
 
 direction or another because of the political situation.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes, and you raise a great point, which is the proximity to a presidential election and the fallout from that potentially too and the 
 
 U.S. economy and Europe for that matter as well. Many issues to consider when making monetary policy for a nation like Japan. Tobias, great to have 
 
 you with us. Thank you. Tobias Harris there, the founder of Japan Foresight.
 
OK. Now, in our Weather Move, we're tracking two big storms in the Western Pacific Ocean. Tropical depression Trami hit Vietnam this weekend, bringing 
 
 heavy rainfall after it pummeled the Philippines last week too. Wow. Take a look at those pictures. Then, there's Kong-rey, which just strengthened 
 
 from a tropical storm to a typhoon, and that's headed towards Taiwan later this week.
 
Now, forecasters predict Kong-rey could make landfall at the equivalent of a Category 3 Atlantic hurricane. Elisa Raffa joins us now to explain. 
 
 Elisa, what more can you tell us?
 
ELISA RAFFA, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  We're busy tracking these storms and what we're worried about with Kong-rey is it will rapidly intensify before it 
 
 gets to Kong -- before it gets to Taiwan. So, this is Kong-rey. Again, it's got better shape. Its eye is coming into a shape today. It will intensify 
 
 more in very warm oceans before it heads to Taiwan.
 
This is what's left of Trami. There's really not a lot left. It is still bringing some rain to parts of Vietnam, but cleanup continues in the 
 
 Philippines after we had so much of that damage last week, and then it brought that heavy rain to Vietnam over the weekend. I mean, look at some 
 
 of these rain totals. Dong Hoi with 685 millimeters of rain just over the weekend, the last two days.
 
You could see a couple of outer bands are still swirling over Vietnam. We're not really looking at it organized in the sense of it being named 
 
 anything tropical anymore, but it is still bringing some of that heavy rain. You could still get another 100 to 150 millimeters of rain before 
 
 this thing finally pulls away. So, the rain continues in Vietnam.
 
Then here's a typhoon Kong-rey that we watched intensify again this afternoon. And as it gets that eye, it's sitting on a very warm ocean 
 
 temperatures and that will continue to fuel it. We are expecting it to rapidly intensify in the next 24 to 48 hours or so. You could see it 
 
 peaking at that strength at 48 hours at 213 kilometers per hour for those winds in the center of the storm. So, again, incredibly strong storm as it 
 
 turns towards Taiwan later in the week.
 
We'll find these tropical storm force winds across the entire island, but really looking at those most destructive winds on parts of the south and 
 
 southeast part of the island, that again could really do some damage.
 
So, look at how this intensifies getting that clear eye possible as it's really intensifies. You'll bring on storm surge and heavy rain, especially 
 
 to the east side there of the island as we get towards Thursday as this starts to make landfall.
 
Look at some of these rainfall totals. We'll get some rain scraped to the northern islands here. The Philippines. Look at these rainfall totals 
 
 again, especially on the east side of the island. Over 250 of rain possible. And then it continues to make this big turn, scraping heavy rain 
 
 for parts of Eastern China, Shanghai. It could see up to 150 of rain. And then even turning into parts of Japan later on in the week. They could see 
 
 some rain from this too. Julia.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Wow. We're going to continue to track that all week. Elisa, good to have you with us. Thank you. Elisa Raffa there.
 
All right. Stay with CNN. We'll be right back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:25:00]
 
CHATTERLEY:  Welcome back to "First Move" with a look at more of the international headlines this hour. Tens of thousands of protesters in 
 
 Georgia gathered outside Parliament earlier, demanding the annulment of this weekend's parliamentary elections. Opposition leaders claim the vote 
 
 was tainted by Russian interference. The Georgian Dream Party secured just under 54 percent of the vote, while the collective opposition parties 
 
 received 21 percent. Georgia's president is refusing to recognize the results.
 
Former Bolivian President Evo Morales says his car was hit by gunfire in an assassination attempt. He posted this video on Facebook showing bullet 
 
 holes in the car's windshield. Morales, who led Bolivia for more than a decade, blamed the government for the alleged attempt on his life. The 
 
 government has opened an investigation and denies any involvement.
 
U.S. President Joe Biden calling a recent deployment of North Korean troops to Russia, quote, "very dangerous." The Pentagon now believes 10,000 North 
 
 Korean soldiers were sent by train in Russia -- oh, sent to train in Russia, excuse me. They will likely help the Kremlin in its war against 
 
 Ukraine.
 
The top attorney for the City of Philadelphia is asking a Pennsylvania state judge to stop Elon Musk's controversial $1 million giveaway. The tech 
 
 billionaire has been handed out the checks to registered voters in battleground states who signed his petition.
 
Now, Philly's district attorney is calling it quote, "an illegal lottery scheme" and has filed suit against Musk and his pro-Trump PAC. This comes 
 
 days after the U.S. Justice Department warned the giveaway might also violate federal laws. Marshall Cohen joins us now from Washington. 
 
 Marshall, great to have you with us. What more is in this suit?
 
MARSHALL COHEN, CNN REPORTER:  Yes, there's a lot in there and you just read the money quote, the Pennsylvania or Philadelphia district attorney, 
 
 so the lead prosecutor in the City of Philadelphia, believes that this is an unlawful lottery.
 <br>[18:30:00]
 
Now, this is a civil lawsuit. These are not criminal charges. This is a civil lawsuit with the attempt of stopping the sweepstakes. The D.A. in 
 
 Philadelphia, Larry Krasner, who is a Democrat and a well-known progressive prosecutor filed this case and asked a judge to shut down the sweepstakes 
 
 as soon as possible, because in his view, it's operating outside the bounds of the law.
 
In most U.S. States there are lotteries, but there are strict regulations on how they can be run. In Pennsylvania they must be operated by the state. 
 
 And the D.A. in Philly said this clearly is being operated by Elon Musk's pro-Trump Super PAC.
 
Let me read for you a quote, Julia, from the lawsuit explaining exactly why the D.A. in Philly thinks it should be shut down. Quote, "Running an 
 
 illegal lottery and violating consumer protections is ample basis for an injunction and concluding that America PAC and Musk must be stopped 
 
 immediately before the upcoming presidential election. America PAC and Musk has hatched -- excuse me, hatched their illegal lottery scheme to influence 
 
 voters."
 
So, that's the view of the D.A., that this is an unlawful attempt to buy influence with voters and they want the judge to shut it down.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Good recovery there, by the way. I've got the same thing where I keep stumbling over words. It's interesting to see the Department of 
 
 Justice sending a shot across the bow to say this could be problematic. The problem is we are, what, eight days out from a presidential election. How 
 
 fast do we think this can be resolved? And very quickly too, how is the Super PAC responding? Because Elon Musk continues to hand out these checks. 
 
 So, I think the message is very clear.
 
COHEN:  Every day counts. November 5th is coming soon. The judge in this case that it was assigned to, Julia, they scheduled a hearing for Friday. 
 
 All right. So, that means, if that holds, that this sweepstakes is basically going to be running, even if they rule on Friday to shut it down, 
 
 that's a whole another week. So, that is good news for Musk.
 
You mentioned the Justice Department, of course, that's federal, totally separate from this, but yes, last week, the Justice Department, federal law 
 
 enforcement, sent a letter to the Super PAC telling them that this might violate federal laws against paying for voter registrations. So, there's 
 
 just a world of potential hurt here for the Super PAC.
 
They have not said much publicly in response to all this legal scrutiny. Elon Musk has defended his sweepstakes. He has said over and over, you 
 
 don't have to vote for anybody to win the money. You don't even have to support Donald Trump to win the money. All you have to do is sign the 
 
 petition. However, Julia, to sign the petition you must be a registered voter in a battleground state. And obviously, all of the winners so far 
 
 have been diehard Trump supporters.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes. Yes, but it's clever though, isn't it? And it's enough of a gray area. You can come back after the election when the result is known, 
 
 we hope. Marshall Cohen, good to have you. Thank you so much. We'll continue to watch it.
 
Now, two key issues post-election that will clearly impact Elon Musk's Tesla, not to mention millions of voters directly as some of the policy 
 
 differences we see in both trade and in tackling climate change.
 
Now, both candidates are promoting greater protectionism and support for America's industrial base. Yet Trump, as you well know, if you're our 
 
 regular viewers, in favor of increasing tariffs by as much as 20 percent on imported goods into America and an additional 60 percent on Chinese goods 
 
 to support U.S. production and raise cash for the government.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  The most beautiful word and I've said this for the last couple of weeks in 
 
 the dictionary today and any -- is the word tariff, it's more beautiful than love. It's more beautiful than anything. It's the most beautiful word. 
 
 This country can become rich with the use -- the proper use of tariffs.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHATTERLEY:  Now, while the Biden White House maintained Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods and in fact, added more of their own, Harris says Trump's 
 
 tariff plan will harm lower income households by ultimately raising prices. She calls his tariff policy misguided.

KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE:  Well, part of it is you don't just throw around the idea of 
 
 just tariffs across the board, and that's part of the problem with Donald Trump. Frankly, I'm going to -- and I say this in all sincerity, he's just 
 
 not very serious about how he thinks about some of these issues.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHATTERLEY:  Differences exist on climate change too. Trump often suggests man-made global warming is overstated and at times calls it a, quote, 
 
 "hoax." He's also vowed to give big oil greater freedoms to drill in the United States and to confiscate unspent money from the multibillion-dollar 
 
 Biden-Harris Inflation Reduction Act that focused primarily on climate investment.
 <br>[18:35:00]
 
Well, now a new study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies takes a closer look at the stakes for both climate and trade in next week's 
 
 elections. Thibault Denamiel joins us now. He's an associate fellow with the economics program at the Center for Strategic and International 
 
 Studies. Thibault, fantastic to have you on the show.
 
Just as big picture, can we agree that whichever candidate wins next week, we're headed into a more protectionist, a greater focus on reshoring 
 
 American production type environment that could end up with higher tariffs globally if the nations that get hit with tariffs respond?
 
THIBAULT DENAMIEL, ASSOCIATE FELLOW, ECONOMICS PROGRAM CSIS:  Yes. Thanks for having me, Julia. Regardless of what happens in the U.S. election, the 
 
 United States is undergoing a paradigm shifts in terms of how it views the relationship between economics and national security. And that does imply a 
 
 trade policy that is shifting from openness and taking down barriers, regardless of trading partner, to viewing international economic 
 
 relationships through a more strategic lens, right?
 
Supply chains are being reshaped from a cross cutting just in time model to one that emphasizes resilience and redundancy from a perspective of 
 
 indiscriminate sourcing to one that carefully picks trading partners, who to rely on, and more importantly, who not to rely on based on a security 
 
 lens.
 
So, given that strategic and economic rivalry between Washington and Beijing, the U.S. goal of lessening U.S. dependence on China's productive 
 
 dominance will remain a priority. And likewise, the desire to build up some trade barriers, at least to prop up our domestic manufacturing capabilities 
 
 will also remain a fixture of U.S. policy.
 
So, the question for the next administration will be how to walk the line of propping up domestic manufacturing while assuring a healthy trading 
 
 relationship with partners and allies to confirm that the perceived national security threat posed by dependence on Chinese production, and 
 
 that includes the relationship with Europe? And the latter is more dependent on the candidate.
 
The Harris administration will likely have a more conciliatory tone with its European economic relationship, Trump administration would approach 
 
 Europe as another trade competitor.
 
CHATTERLEY:  I mean -- and also, I think what we learned in the four years that Trump was president that you have to try and separate the rhetoric and 
 
 the threats from the actual policy action, which admittedly at this stage is difficult.
 
When I was at the IMF meetings last week, the general view was that there's very little difference between the Harris campaign and Harris in the White 
 
 House versus what Biden has been in the White House. Just very quickly. Would you agree with that, at the margin?
 
DENAMIEL:  In some cases, Harris will have to continue and build upon the Biden policy, whether because of ideological alignment, which is certainly 
 
 there, at least in part, or because the political board is also already set. For example, it's unlikely that a Harris administration would roll 
 
 back existing tariffs on Chinese goods.
 
Likewise, when it comes to the relationship with the World Trade Organization, the Harris administration would be unable to abide by the 
 
 multilateral bodies trade rules, because they're simply a compatible with the way the United States as economic competitiveness today with subsidies 
 
 and sourcing requirements, for instance.
 
Another case is, however, Harris administration may champion some novel policy actions that they -- but they would face an uphill battle on Capitol 
 
 Hill. For example, placing carbon emissions on the -- price on carbon emissions of domestically produced goods or negotiating critical minerals 
 
 agreements. So, the additional trading partners, which is something that alluded to by administration.
 
In that vein, the Harris trade negotiators may find additional success in other areas that have alluded to Trump -- the Biden administration, like 
 
 successfully concluding negotiations on the global arrangement on sustainable steel and aluminum. So, there's certainly going to be a 
 
 continuation of policy, but perhaps some novel tools and we'll have to watch out for those.
 
CHATTERLEY:  OK. So, then switch to Trump, because he's talked about up to 20 percent tariffs on incoming imported goods. He's talked about tariffs of 
 
 60 percent on Chinese goods. I want to hone in on the implications for climate, because these are the two things, trade and climate. Because when 
 
 I look at our supply chain for renewable energies for batteries and rare Earth minerals, it's centered around China.
 
So, if you're enacting 60 percent tariffs on Chinese imports, you are fundamentally impairing your ability to transition to renewable energy. Is 
 
 that going to be perhaps the biggest danger beyond the impact of rising prices perhaps of the kind of tariffs he's talking about on China 
 
 specifically?
 <br>[18:40:00]
 
DENAMIEL:  That certainly needs to be part of our considerations. I mean, when you look at the impact of tariffs on individual goods, the effects may 
 
 look minimal, you know, altogether the trade weighted average of the tariff increases during the Trump administration went from 1.4 percent to 2.8 
 
 percent from 2016 to 2019, at least which may not necessarily strike you as enormous difference, but then you look at the aggregate and it shows that 
 
 actually the significant trade barriers are being imposed would result in equally significant price increases for consumers.
 
So, studies have shown that, for example, 20 percent across the board tariff combined with 60 percent tariff on Chinese goods would cost a 
 
 typical U.S. household around $2,600 a year. And as you say, these prices would have -- these price increases would have an impact on the green 
 
 transition just proportionally because China is such a significant player when it comes to manufacturing these green transition technologies.
 
You know, end uses such as EVs or solar PVs are altogether made in China usually. The Chinese are also the best manufacturing inputs for these end 
 
 uses, you know, lithium-ion batteries. You mentioned refined critical and - - refined critical minerals and materials.
 
Again, China is the best at producing at the larger scale and at the most competitive prices. And in some cases, there are already fairly high tariff 
 
 rates, but that blanket 60 percent would certainly make the green transition to the United States more difficult.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes. I mean, you can protect your industries, but you have to work out where your supply chain is going to diversify from too if you're 
 
 going to take these kinds of decisions. It's going to be an interesting several months. Thibault, great to have you. Thank you. Thibault Dinamiel 
 
 there from the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
 
All right. Coming up, Shohei's superstar Los Angeles is raking in the cash all thanks to baseball tourism. We'll discuss the Ohtani effect on the 
 
 city's economy after this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHATTERLEY:  Welcome back to "First Move." In just a few hours, the L.A. Dodgers will play the New York Yankees in Game 3 of the World Series. The 
 
 Dodgers winning the first two games over the weekend with ticket prices hitting fresh record highs. And baseball megastar Shohei Ohtani fueling 
 
 much of the frenzy, as you would expect.
 
The Japanese pitcher has spurred a tourism bonanza too for Los Angeles. The number of visitors from Japan have spiked a whopping 230,000 last year, a 
 
 number that's expected to climb in 2024. Bill Karz is the head of brand and digital marketing for the Los Angeles Tourism and Convention Center, and he 
 
 joins us now.
 <br>[18:45:00]
 
Bill, welcome to the show. I believe that's a 90 percent increase on the number of visitors compared to 2022. How many of those visitors last year 
 
 actually went to a Dodgers game?
 
BILL KARZ, SENIOR VP OF BRAND AND DIGITAL MARKETING, L.A. TOURISM AND CONVENTION BOARD:  That is correct. We're seeing almost 80 to 90 percent of 
 
 the visitors going to a Dodger game, at least more than one time. So, they're seeing a lot of things while they're in L.A.
 
CHATTERLEY:  OK. So, just put the Ohtani effect into perspective for us, because clearly, you're seeing an enormous spike in visitations. You're 
 
 seeing enormous spike in visitors to the games. What else is it creating as a result?
 
KARZ:  Sure. So, the Ohtani effect is real. No, we're going to probably see over 300,000 visitors by the end of the year, and it's driving billions of 
 
 dollars into our local economy. Visitors, while they're here, are going to multiple attractions, Universal Studios, Hollywood. They're going to build 
 
 all of our communities in terms of visitor impact. Like little Tokyo is seeing great growth in terms of visitors to the area. Not only that, but 
 
 you know, the Dodger Stadium has this really great stadium tours. And we're seeing over eight tours a week now by Japanese speaking tour guides. So, 
 
 it's having quite an effect, not only at Dodger Stadium, but the rest of the local community as well.
 
CHATTERLEY:  How many people are on those tours, if they're running them eight times a week?
 
KARZ:  Quite a few. But, you know, Japan is on pace to be our fifth largest overseas market. So, it really is an important moment for L.A. And to have 
 
 Ohtani and Yamamoto here on the Dodgers.
 
CHATTERLEY:  I need to come, but I've heard that the Dodger Stadium now has both Japanese and Korean, for that matter, cuisine on the menu as a result 
 
 as well. Katsu sandwiches, Korean fried chicken. So, it's really catering to this sort of new and fresh element of visitors and fans.
 
KARZ:  Absolutely. You know, the chef at Dodger State does an exceptional job of showcasing local cuisine that's in Los Angeles. And, you know, the 
 
 chicken katsu sandwich is my favorite. But yes, welcoming to Korean visitors as well. You know, Tommy Edman is Korean as well. So, it's great 
 
 to have the Dodgers representing L.A. so well globally.
 
CHATTERLEY:  What about ties back to Tokyo or Japan itself? I was in Japan earlier this year, and I was actually blown away by the number of foreign 
 
 visitors that were there. And obviously, the weaker currency helps as well. It's far more expensive for visitors to come to the United States and spend 
 
 money here. It's a real fan that, that comes and chooses to spend the money here. Do you have ties as well over there?
 
KARZ:  So, overseas visitors to L.A. is critical for our recovery efforts. We're about 90 percent recovery to our pandemic -- pre-pandemic levels. And 
 
 so, we see international visitors in L.A. they spend three times as much as the U.S. traveler.
 
So, we have representatives and all of our key markets, including Japan and it's really important that we represent ourselves well to have as many 
 
 visitors as possible. Not only this year, but next year, because the Dodgers will be playing the Cubs in the opening series in Tokyo. So, we 
 
 have a rapport of both reps in Japan and here in the U.S. to try to drive as much visitation.
 
It's actually the U.S.-Japanese year of tourism. So, this is really important for L.A. to be in the World Series, and we're really excited 
 
 about Game 3.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Wow. We shall see what happens. There's a lot of excitement building. I can tell you in our office as well. Bill, fantastic to have you 
 
 with us. And that's an incredible stat, by the way, three times higher spend than American tourists that are visiting as well. They're definitely 
 
 dedicated. Bill Karz, great to have you with us, sir. Thank you. The head of brand and digital marketing for the L.A. Tourism and Convention Board.
 
OK. If you've missed any of our interviews today, they'll be on my X and Instagram pages. You can search for @JChatterleyCNN.
 
Now, coming up, as we've been discussing, while Ohtani's fans are thrilled he's in tonight's lineup, Yankee's fans are betting on home field 
 
 advantage. We'll tell you what to expect for Game 3 of the World Series, next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:50:00]
 
CHATTERLEY:  Welcome back to "First Move." and as we've been discussing, the World Series continues in a little over an hour. The pressure is on for 
 
 the Yankees after losing to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the first two games. Star player Shohei Ohtani injured his shoulder Saturday, but he is in the 
 
 Dodgers' lineup. For more on this, we're joined by Don Riddell.
 
Don, tell us more because there was a pin drop feeling when he got injured, but it seems like he's OK and he's going to be in the starting lineup.
 
DON RIDDELL, CNN WORLD SPORT:  Yes, Julia, that seems to be the case. I mean, it's hard to imagine when you hear the phrase, a partially dislocated 
 
 shoulder, how that would be just all fine a couple of days later, especially when your job is to swing a baseball bat very hard like Shohei 
 
 Ohtani does. But yes, he's in the lineup. He has communicated to his teammates that he is planning on playing. And I certainly think that is 
 
 what we can expect.
 
One of his teammates, Max Muncy, actually spoke to the media earlier today and said this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MAX MUNCY, LOS ANGELES DODGERS INFIELDER:  He texted the whole team as we were on our way to the airport and said he was going to be fine and that 
 
 was it. He said he was going to play. And so, we all just put it to the side at that moment. You know, we all said, all right. He's got us, you 
 
 know, we'll be ready for him to be in the lineup.
 
Having him in there, obviously, it's a big guy to have in there, helps a lot. He's had some big moments for us and, you know, we're obviously 
 
 expecting a couple more big moments out of him.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
RIDDELL:  So, Ohtani actually travelled separately to the rest of the team into New York, but he has made his way there. Of course, we all know about 
 
 his phenomenal skills and talents and the historic season that he's had. He's playing in the playoffs for the first time, he's playing in the World 
 
 Series, obviously, for the first time.
 
He hasn't set it on fire just yet. Some of his other teammates have played more important roles in this World Series. But just him being in the team 
 
 is huge. Just his mere presence at the plate puts so much strain and pressure on the Yankees' offense. So, the Dodgers will be thrilled that he 
 
 is back. And of course, a man of his talent, never count him out because he could do something magical at just a moment's notice.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes, and all the pressures on the Yankees, of course, too. No one would wish him injured, but I wish they were -- I bet they're wishing 
 
 that he wasn't starting today to help their odds. But we shall see. I'm going to be watching. Don, great to have you. Thank you. Don Riddell there.
 
Now, fans of Timothee Chalamet were seeing double on Sunday after the actor crashed his own lookalike contest. Take a look at this.
 
Chalamet surprised his doppelgangers at an event here in New York. According to Variety, more than 2,500 people RSVP'd to the event. The 
 
 winner was awarded $50 in the form of a giant check made out to the best Tim. Yes, there were some lookalikes that look more like him actually.
 
And finally, on First Move, video game fans in London will never forget this. A giant game of Tetris, do you remember it? To celebrate the Block 
 
 Puzzle game's 40th birthday. Monday's event was hosted on a large LED screen in central London. Participants scanned a QR code to download an 
 
 app. So, that they could play along. Organizers say it's one of the biggest multiplayer Tetris games to ever take place. And given the shape of Tetris 
 
 pizzas, too bad it wasn't held in one of London's famous squares. See what we did there.
 
Now, it looks like pigs are still a long way from flying. But thanks to scientists in Europe, they're taking that much closer to talking. Our Anna 
 
 Stewart explains.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER (voice-over):  Does this indicate happiness, discomfort or stress? With the help of A.I., European scientists developed 
 
 an algorithm that may just be capable of decoding pigs noises, as well as keeping farmers updated on their pigs wellbeing.
 <br>[18:55:00]
 
To develop the A.I. algorithm, scientists collected thousands of recordings of pig sounds in various scenarios, including play, isolation, and 
 
 competition for food. Once collected, they were placed in a database.
 
ELODIE MANDEL-BRIEFER, BIOLOGIST, UNIVERSITY OF COPENHAGEN:  We had this huge database of calls that are producing specific emotions, specific 
 
 context by many different pigs and kinds of pigs.
 
STEWART (voice-over):  Scientists found short grunts typically signal positive emotions. Long grunts often indicate discomfort, screams or 
 
 squeals could show stress.
 
MANDEL-BRIEFER:  We developed A.I., so artificial intelligence that could tell us -- be trained to tell us if the calls that we recorded were 
 
 emotionally positive or negative.
 
STEWART (voice-over):  The study of animal emotions is a relatively new field. It highlights the importance of livestock's mental health to their 
 
 overall wellbeing. Most welfare strategies today focus only on the animal's physical health.
 
MANDEL-BRIEFER:  And now, with the explosions of A.I. methods, it actually becomes more and more easy to do these things.
 
STEWART (voice-over):  Scientists hope this tool will be developed into an app for farmers' phones, helping to translate what pigs are saying in terms 
 
 of their emotions.
