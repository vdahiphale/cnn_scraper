JOHN VAUSE, CNN ANCHOR: Ahead here on CNN NEWSROOM. Joe Biden's BFT visit to Kyiv. Nothing says we stand with you quite like physically standing by one another in Ukraine's capitol with air raid sirens heard in the distance. 
 
Another powerful deadly tremor rattles Turkey. 
 
And Israel's Prime Minister calls it a great day, a great night. Tens of thousands of Israeli protesters, world leaders and legal scholars fear the end is near (PH) for Israeli democracy.
 
ANNOUNCER: Live from CNN Center, this is CNN NEWSROOM with John Vause. 
 
VAUSE: U.S. president is in Poland at this hour, he crossed the border from Ukraine around 8:00 p.m. local time, traveling by train, bringing to an end an unprecedented presidential trip to an active war zone. 
 
Biden will be in Poland to mark the one year anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In the coming hours, he will meet with the Polish president before making public remarks. 
 
Just a day earlier, Biden's visit to Kyiv was intended to show unwavering U.S. support for the people of Ukraine. This was the first time an American president has traveled to a war zone with no significant U.S. military presence. The safety and security for the leader of the free world was left to the Ukrainian police and Ukrainian soldiers.
 
During his visit, Biden also had a strong rebuke for the Russian President Vladimir Putin.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Putin thought Ukraine was weak and the West was divided. He thought he could outlast us. I don't think he's thinking that right now.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) VAUSE: Air raid sirens could be heard ringing out in Kyiv as Biden walked alongside Zelenskyy around St. Michael's Cathedral. The Ukrainian president spoke about this critical moment in this almost a year-long war.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): It is right here and now in Ukraine that the future of a world order based on rules, humanity and predictability is being decided. 
 
And today, among other things, President Biden and I talked about how to do everything this year for our joint victory in the war started by Russia. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: CNN's Kevin Liptak is following developments and joins us now live from Warsaw. It was quite the 24 hours to say the least for Joe Biden. What's in store for today?
 
KEVIN LIPTAK, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER (on camera): Yes, President Biden is back here in Warsaw. Now he entered that 10-hour journey by train from Ukraine. He departed last night, of course, that visit highly symbolic. The president really trying to reaffirm American commitment to Ukraine at what his aides say is an uncertain juncture. We are approaching what everyone expects to be an offensive by Russia coming up in the spring and the U.S. really wants to demonstrate to Zelenskyy and to the Ukrainians that it will remain by its side in the coming months ahead. 
 
Of course, President Biden also had that pointed message for Vladimir Putin almost taunting him by visiting Kyiv. 
 
Of course, Vladimir Putin had hoped to take Kyiv in the opening days of the war one year ago. Now, President Biden standing there with Zelenskyy saying that Putin's war of conquest was failing. And that does set up this extraordinary split screen that we will see later today. 
 
We'll hear from both presidents, President Putin and President Biden when they speak both addressing this one year anniversary of the invasion. President Putin expected to speak to political and military elite and President Biden will speak from here in Warsaw. 
 
And it is interesting the choice of venue for President Biden's speech, he'll speak from the Royal Castle. 
 
John, you'll remember, that's the same place that 11 months ago President Biden spoke and at the end of his speech, he ad lib saying that Putin should not remain in power. 
 
Now, of course, Putin remains very much in power as we enter the second year of the war. And if President Biden has one goal in this visit to Poland, it's to reaffirm the Western alliance remains united, that the United States and its partners will support Ukraine for as long as it takes. Just how long that is, of course remains uncertain. 
 
President Biden is going to announce this massive new military assistance package, half a billion dollars. He also plans to announce new strength -- new sanctions on Moscow. 
 
But what his aides say is that they really do hope to reinforce support for America -- for Ukraine on the battlefield. And that is something that President Biden and President Zelenskyy discussed at length behind closed doors yesterday in Kyiv, sort of plotting out how the next several months will unfold as Ukraine hopes to retake some territory as it prepares for this Russian offensive. And so that is President Biden's message as he continues his trip to Poland today, John.
 <br>[00:05:21]
 
VAUSE: Kevin Liptak there live for us with the very latest in Warsaw. Thank you for getting up early, the early morning shift. We appreciate it. 
 
Matthew Schmidt is Director of International Affairs at the University of New Haven. And at this hour he joins us from Ukraine's capital. 
 
Matthew, thank you for taking the time. 
 
MATTHEW SCHMIDT, DIRECTOR OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS, UNIVERSITY OF NEW HAVEN (on camera): My pleasure.
 
VAUSE: OK, so Kyiv has seen a steady stream of world leaders. Notably the first were prime ministers from Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovenia three weeks after the war began. 
 
But when the President of the United States shows up, and promises "our unwavering and unflagging commitment to Ukraine's democracy, sovereignty and territorial integrity", and then goes on to say this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BIDEN: Freedom is priceless. It's worth fighting for, for as long as it takes. And that's how long we're going to be with you, Mr. President, for as long as it takes. We'll do it.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: To quote your Vice President, Joe Biden, that's a BFD a big effing deal. So, explain why it's such a big deal.
 
SCHMIDT: The Ukrainians see this, in essence as a kind of victory already, they've won a place in the West. They are now seen as a full partner, having the commitment of the leader of the West, the United States of America who came here during wartime, took significant risks to do it all to send a message to the enemy that the left is behind Ukraine and to Ukrainians that the United States is prepared to defend them to prepare to support them in this upcoming offensive.
 
VAUSE: I want you to listen to the Secretary General of NATO talking about Vladimir Putin's mindset right now almost a year since the war began. Here it is.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JENS STOLTENBERG, SECRETARY GENERAL, NATO: We see no sign that President Putin has changed his ambitions in Ukraine. And we see the opposite. He is not planning for peace. He is planning for more war, for new offensives. And he has mobilized hundreds of thousands of new troops, he is setting his economy more and more on a war footing. And then he's reaching out to other authoritarian regimes like Iran and North Korea to get more weapons. 
 
So, the only response we can give now is to step up our support for Ukraine.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: So, with that in mind, and there is a message from the U.S. president to the Russian president, which is something like, I'm in Kyiv and you're not. What will be the sort of reaction or response here from Putin of what is essentially an international humiliation?
 
SCHMIDT: He said publicly already that he's viewing this now as proof positive that Russia is not fighting Ukraine. He said, we're not fighting Ukraine. We're not fighting Ukrainians, we're fighting the West. We're fighting NATO, we're fighting United States. He's stepping up to the plate. And he's accepting the challenge in essence that he sees coming from Joe Biden.
 
VAUSE: So, we're in a situation now where there is no other way out of this conflict it seems other than one side having a crushing victory over the other to dictate terms.
 
SCHMIDT: That's what it seems like right now. It's unclear if that's possible on the battlefield. In other words, it's unclear that either side can win strictly speaking with their military prowess. They're well evenly matched right now. And we'll see in the coming weeks, I think, perhaps even sooner than the coming weeks, the ability of the Ukrainian Armed Forces to get into the field to control the operational tempo. And to really put the Russians on the back foot.
 
VAUSE: Ukraine's president had invited Joe Biden on a number of times to visit Kyiv. I want you to listen on what Zelenskyy says is the significance this trip represents to Ukraine, here he is.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ZELENSKYY (through translator): This first visit of the U.S. president to Ukraine in 15 years is the most important in the entire history of relations between Ukraine and the U.S., in this particular periods.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: Both the Pentagon and the Secret Service who are opposed to this trip, the Kremlin was notified ahead of time by the White House. So, to speak to the personal risks here for Biden, as well as why this is so unprecedented for a sitting U.S. President. SCHMIDT: I mean, I think they were -- they were quite extraordinary. He came with a -- with a smaller retinue of security. I think most importantly, he put his life in the hands of Ukrainian military of the Ukrainian government. And I think that more than anything was a personal show to Zelenskyy that Biden the man, right, trusted him, and was willing to come and do this. 
 
Remember, for Joe Biden, politics is personal, right? He said many, many times in international relations is simply getting to know the other person in the room. And I think that's what you see here, you see that he got to know Zelenskyy, he became close to him, and most importantly, he's trusted him.
 <br>[00:10:03]
 
And so, the trust between the two nations, between the two militaries to operate in support of each other is there and it's represented in the trust between those two men.
 
VAUSE: Matthew, we appreciate you being with us. Thank you very much this time from Kyiv. Appreciate your time. 
 
SCHMIDT: My pleasure. 
 
VAUSE: China's already close ties to Russia under closer scrutiny with U.S. claims that Beijing is considering lethal support for Vladimir Putin's military. 
 
China's top diplomat expected in Moscow in the coming hours. Wang Yi was in Budapest over the past two days where he met the Hungarian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister.
 
Live now at Hong Kong, CNN's Kristie Lu Stout whose following developments. So, we've just had Biden's trip there to Ukraine, the top diplomat of China heading to Moscow. What's on his agenda once he gets there?
 
KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Yes, Wang Yi is traveling to Moscow right now. We just learned from the Russian news agency tasks that he is due to arrive at Tuesday afternoon, local time. 
 
Last week, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that this visit would be an opportunity for both sides to exchange views about the relationship, also an opportunity to discuss international hotspot issues, which is code for the war in Ukraine.
 
On Monday we heard from Wang Yi he spoke in Budapest. He said that China is willing to work with other nations to achieve a lasting peace in Ukraine. We also heard from the Kremlin spokesman saying that he does not rule out a meeting between Wang Yi and the Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
 
Now, this visit to Moscow comes at a time of deepening diplomatic tension between China and the United States over the Chinese balloon and over Russia's war in Ukraine. Just last weekend, the U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken warned
 
 Wang Yi of consequences if China was to provide material support to Russia and China has fired back.
 
Now on Monday, let's bring up the statement for you. This is what we heard from the MoFA spokesman saying this "The U.S. is in no position to tell China what to do. We would never stand for finger-pointing or even coercion and pressurizing from the U.S. on our relations with Russia." 
 
But since the Russian invasion in Ukraine, look, both Russia and China have been edging closer together on multiple fronts politically and economically. China continues to buy Russian energy, softening the impact of Western sanctions. And China continues to parrot Kremlin talking points on including refusing to condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine. 
 
So, Wang Yi sits down in Moscow with Russian officials, expect to see another demonstration of this no-limits partnership between Russia and China, John.
 
VAUSE: If these accusations are true, and China is considering it is giving material support to Russia. There are implications here which go way beyond China if there's in fact retaliation from the United States and from the E.U. and NATO.
 
STOUT: Yes, it would represent a significant escalation not only in terms of China's involvement with Russia during this time of conflict in Ukraine, but also could open up a new phase. 
 
In the conflict itself, we heard that dire warning from the Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, who said that any sort of significant backing of Russia by China could open up World War III. But we have heard from a senior Chinese diplomatic official that China does not want to see an escalation in the conflict. It does not want to see it spiral out of control. 
 
And also looking at China's behavior, China has been carefully managing its action so as not to trigger secondary sanctions for any real material involvement or assistance to Russia. That's not something that China wants to deal with right now, especially at this moment. Its economy is still teetering after three years of its era COVID policy, John.
 
VAUSE: Kristie Lu Stout, thank you so much. It's always good to see you.
 
Two weeks after a powerful earthquake killed tens of thousands of people in Turkey and Syria, a magnitude 6.3 aftershock has rattled the region bringing devastation onto devastation.
 
And that is the moment when Monday's earthquake struck in southern Turkey's Hatay province. At least three people were killed, almost 300 were injured in Turkey. 
 
In over Syria, the White Helmet organization reported more than 130 were injured. 
 
In both countries, several buildings that badly damaged by the last earthquake have now collapsed. 
 
On Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken met with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan to discuss among other pressing issues earthquake recovery for Turkey.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: The United States is here to support you and your time of need. And we will be by your side for as long as it takes to recover and to rebuild.

VAUSE: The February 6th earthquake was so powerful it created a 300 meter long Canyon in a Turkish olive grove. Residence there and other parts of Turkey are sleeping outside, they're waiting for basic supplies. 
 
CNN's Jomana Karadsheh has the story.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 <br>[00:15:04]
 
JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): They've all come to witness a site so extraordinary, some would even say terrifying. The monstrous 7.8 magnitude earthquake split the land and the village of Tepehan in two. An olive grove now divided by this new canyon roughly 130 feet deep and more than 900 feet long.
 
This area lies on the eastern Anatolian fault line that shook Turkey and you can see how powerful it was. Geologists we've spoken to say that this is not unusual. They describe this as rock mass failure, but they say that this is not something they have seen in their lifetime.
 
These men from a nearby village tell us everyone is scared. They all now sleep outside. No one was hurt in this village in the mountains only a short drive from the devastated city of Antakya. Here like many other villages in the area, the damage is also limited, but its impact has been overwhelming.
 
I thought it was the apocalypse. The sky ruptured, the ground cracked, you have nowhere to run, Ihsan tells us. I have grandchildren, I hug them and I think if we're going to die, we should be together.
 
Ihsan and his family more than 40 he says have been living out here under this makeshift tarp shelter. They need a tent he tells us, but no tents or aid have made it to this village. There are too many hard- hit areas in need of urgent aid in one massive earthquake zone. And getting that aid out is a herculean effort.
 
Incirlik Airbase has become an around the clock hub for these aid deliveries. These Turkish, American and Polish troops work together to get basic and lifesaving supplies out. Choppers here are constantly on the go.
 
This chopper has just been dispatched to the outskirts of the city of Antakya. They're carrying baby clothes, warm children's clothes, blankets, tents and much more of this desperately needed aid.
 
It's a quick landing here. People have to rush to grab what they've been waiting for for days.
 
Our house collapsed and we had no tents, this man said. I lost eight nephews. We asked for a tent, food and underwear. God bless you. You've made us so happy.
 
Help can't come soon enough for those who lost everything, left with nothing in an instant.

Still to come, a push to revamp Israel's judicial system passes its first hurdle by the skin of its teeth as huge crowds protest outside the Knesset. The next steps and why these reforms are so contentious. 
 
Also ahead, the U.N. calling for action a s North Korea launches three missiles in three days. For details, after the break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[00:20:16]
 
VAUSE: Israel's ultra conservative government is one step closer to taking control of the judicial system, with the Israeli parliament or Knesset, passing the first of three readings of the bill, which would effectively put judicial appointments under full governmental control, as well as overturn Supreme Court rulings with a simple parliamentary majority. 
 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been charged with corruption is in favor of the changes, so too his coalition partners.
 
After the preliminary vote, Netanyahu tweeted, it was a great day and a great night. The bill now heads back to committee and then will return to the Knesset floor and must pass two more readings to become law. 
 
And lawmakers are divided over all of this, some wave flags inside the chamber was -- were escorted out by security. 
 
And outside the parliament building there was a sea of Israeli flags. About 75,000 people showed up to protest.
 
And CNN's Hadas Gold was there. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): This is the main road that leads not only in front of the Israeli Supreme Court, but also ends in front of the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, and that's where these thousands of protesters are heading for these protesters today here. They believe that these judicial reforms would threaten the independence of the Israeli judiciary. Some of them believe that it's only to help Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister in his ongoing corruption trial, something he denies. 
 
The protesters here are chanting things like democracy. They're chanting things like Israel, it will not become a dictatorship. For many of them here, they have this visceral belief that these reforms are really threatening the Israeli way of life in the Israeli democracy. 
 
But for the counter-protesters and there are counter-protesters here. They support these reforms. They believe that they're very much needed. They believe that it's a long time coming and that this is what the Israeli voters voted for in those November elections when Benjamin Netanyahu and his allies won a 64-seat majority in the Israeli parliament. 
 
But Benjamin Netanyahu is facing external pressures, including from the American ambassador to Israel, who in a recent podcast in recent days called on the Israeli government to pump the brakes, he said. He said to slow down the legislative process and allow time for consensus, allow time for negotiations.

VAUSE: Meanwhile, after pressure from the U.S., the United Nations Security Council softened its language condemning Israeli plans to expand settlements in the West Bank. 
 
The Council issued a non-binding statement that expressed concern and dismay after Israel decided last week to legalize 10,000 new settlement units. A resolution demanding they all together hold the construction would likely have been vetoed by the United States.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO U.N.: These unilateral measures exacerbate tensions, they harm trust between the parties. They undermine the prospects for a negotiated two state solution. The United States does not support these actions full stop.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: Israeli settlements in the West Bank are considered illegal under international law with they're on land Israel captured from Jordan more than 50 years ago. Israel insists the land is historically Jewish. U.N. also warning that missile launches by North Korea pose a serious
 
 risk to international civil aviation and maritime traffic. 
 
During a meeting of the Security Council on Monday, a top U.N. official urged member nations to find diplomatic solutions to the situation.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MOHAMED KHALED KHIARI, ASSISTANT SECRETARY-GENERAL FOR THE MIDDLE EAST, ASIA AND PACIFIC. PEACE OPERATIONS DEPARTMENT: We welcome the Security Council commitment to a peaceful, comprehensive diplomatic and political solutions to the situation on the Korean peninsula. As well as the importance that council has placed it on working to reduce tensions. Diplomacy, not isolation is the only way forward.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: The Security Council meeting comes after North Korea launched three ballistic missiles over the past three days, claiming it has now developed missiles capable of surviving reentry.
 
CNN's Will Ripley has details.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): The massive missile is a menacing site moving into place at Pyongyang's airport. 
 
North Korean leader Kim Jong-un gave the order just hours ahead of Saturday's surprise launch state media says. This intercontinental ballistic missile of Hwasong-15, hitting hypersonic speeds hurtling high above the earth, barreling back down to Japan's territorial waters about 67 minutes later. 
 
Saturday's missile one of many on display just last week, a record number of ICBMs more than any military parade in North Korean history. 
 
Kim ordered mass production of ICBMs earlier this year, the parade featuring new missiles and a new face. Kim Ju-ae, Kim's daughter, believed to be just 9 years old. 
 
She began appearing on state media three months ago, fueling speculation she's being groomed as the next North Korean leader. 
 <br>[00:25:05]
 
So, given the fact that Kim Jong-un chose to introduce his daughter on the day of his previous ICBM launch, what do you make of the timing and symbolism of that?
 
CHAD O'CARROLL, FOUNDER, KOREA RISK GROUP: I think it demonstrates that she's been groomed as the next leader. And that to me suggests there could be something behind the scenes, maybe a health problem with Kim Jong-un that is accelerating, I need to do this now rather than years later when she's a bit older. 
 
RIPLEY: Kim's daughter now a fixture on state media, sitting with her father at a weekend soccer match, posing together for a postage stamp. Dad, daughter and the family arsenal. 
 
Two smaller missiles fired Monday. A test of tactical nuclear weapons state T.V. says. The bellicose broadcast came with a warning from Kim's younger sister Kim Yo Jong, saying the frequency of using the Pacific Ocean as our shooting range depends on the nature of the U.S. military's actions. 
 
She's referring to upcoming military drills on the Korean peninsula, the U.S., South Korea and Japan responding to the ICBM launch with joint air exercises over the weekend, fueling fears of further escalation.
 
PARK JIN, SOUTH KOREAN FOREIGN MINISTER: If North Korea conducts the seventh nuclear test, which could happen at any time. It will be a game changer in a sense that North Korea could develop and deploy tactical nuclear missiles.
 
RIPLEY: The growing arsenal some say has one purpose, preserving the power of the ruling Kim family for generations to come.

VAUSE: The European Union and the U.K. have imposed new sanctions on high ranking Iranian officials for their role in the brutal crackdown on protesters nationwide. The E.U. says a restrictions package will target 32 people and two entities, including freezing assets of a commander of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard. Thousands of protesters gathered in Brussels calling on the E.U. to add Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps to his list of terrorist organizations. Anti-government protests rocked Iran following the death of Mahsa Amini whilst in the custody of the country's morality police. 
 
Still to come here on CNN, more details of Joe Biden's historic visit to Ukraine. How's Friday a symbolic boost Kyiv at a crucial moment in the conflict.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
VAUSE: Welcome back, everyone, I'm John Vause. You're watching CNN NEWSROOM. 
 
U.S. President Joe Biden is about to begin his two-day visit to Poland following an unexpected and historic trip to Ukraine. 
 <br>[00:30:05]
 
The visit to Kyiv was his first since the Russian invasion nearly a year ago, and as Isa Soares reports, seeing Joe Biden up close and in person made a big impression on many Ukrainians. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ISA SOARES, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over) Air-raid sirens blaring throughout the streets of Kyiv. But, unlike other alerts over the past year, there were no reported incoming Russian missiles. 
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT: Good morning, Mister President. 
 
SOARES (voice-over): Instead, what was seen was the United States president, Joe Biden's, visit to the country. A first since Russia launched a full-scale invasion nearly a year ago. 
 
Laying wreaths and paying tributes to fallen soldiers, Biden's visit showed the world, yet again, which side of the battlefield the U.S. is on. Cementing relations with a war-torn country by announcing half a billion dollars' worth of military equipment, along with the political and public relations picture of a U.S. president visiting a war zone to harden that relationship. 
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Putin thought Ukraine was weak and the West was divided. As you know, Mister President, I said to you in the beginning, he's counting on us not sticking together. He thought he could outlast us. I don't think he's thinking that right now. 
 
SOARES (voice-over): Biden's assistance means more Howitzers, more ammunitions for troops and potentially long-range weapons. 
 
For Ukraine, president Zelenskyy said Biden's visit would inch Ukraine closer to victory. And the generous package would impact the battlefield. 
 
ZELENSKYY (through translator): I know, Mister President, that there will be a very significant package of security support to Ukraine. And currently, it will serve as a clear signal that Russia's attempt of relaunch will have no chance. 
 
SOARES (voice-over): As Biden's convoy pulled up, Kyiv locals were quick to take videos of the historic events unfolding, notably astounded to witness Biden in real time. One 75-year-old resident said he was speechless at the visit.  
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) SOARES (voice-over): And when asked what the visit means to him, he said, "it means everything: life and victory." 
 
His words summed up by his wife, who said, "Victory will be ours. There's no doubt about that." 
 
Biden's trip may have caused momentum to be high. But with the Ukrainian resistance entering its second year, the question of how or when this will end still remains. 
 
Isa Soares, CNN, London. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
VAUSE: Peter Zalmayev is director of the Eurasian Democracy Institute. He is with us this hour from Kyiv. It is good to see you. It's been a while. 
 
PETER ZALMAYEV, DIRECTOR, EURASIAN DEMOCRACY INSTITUTE: It's been a while, indeed. 
 
VAUSE: So, when you first heard the news that the president of the United States, against the advice of the Pentagon, the Secret Service, was actually in Kyiv, meeting with President Zelenskyy, all this as a demonstration of unwavering support for Ukraine, what was your first reaction? And now it's been a few hours. What are your thoughts on it right now? 
 
ZALMAYEV: Well, my first reaction -- actually, I had a reaction before that as I was making my way by train from the Munich security conference. And in fact, our train had to stop to let President Biden's train pass us. And then we were detained at the train station, waiting for the, you know -- the roadblocks to be removed. 
 
We did not know, obviously, that it was Biden and I have sort of a suspicion it may have been him, but I just didn't think we would be in so much luck. 
 
This obviously is a very, very uplifting moment for Ukraine, as this is reminiscent of Kennedy's visit to Berlin, it's reassuring not only just to Ukrainians. It's reassuring to all of Ukraine's Western allies.
 
And it's sort of a way for Biden to send the message that America is here to stay to see this through. This is a fight not just for Ukraine. This is a fight for values. This is a fight for democracy. And this is indeed what it is shaping up to be, as China is now, we hear, considering helping Russia much more actively. 
 
And so, this is a very critical moment, especially now that we are now staring down this wall of a war of attrition. If that is the case, then obviously, this is a message to Ukraine's Western powers to ramp up significantly. It's a production of weaponry to allow Ukraine to stage a counteroffensive as soon as possible and to win back as much of its territory as possible. 
 
VAUSE: Over the last 12 months, you've been a pretty regular guest here on CNN, and we are very grateful for that. I want you to listen to part of that conversation from April when I was in Lviv in Ukraine. Here's part of it.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
VAUSE: We're at the point now where we're sort of entering what appears to be almost like a war of attrition, if you like. Does it sort of come down to both sides now inflicting as much pain as possible on the other side? 
 
ZALMAYEV: I mean, it -- you know, it looks like it. Vladimir Putin is not about to be dissuaded from leaving Ukraine. We know that. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[00:35:00]
 
VAUSE: So, there's no talk of this diplomatic off-ramp these days. And it seems this has become a battle of attrition. You just said it then. So, with neither Ukraine or Russia able to inflict a decisive victory at this point, how long can this continue as is? 
 
ZALMAYEV: This will continue as long as Vladimir Putin, you know, considers that this -- this is his only way to cling to power by sort of, you know, continuing this absolutely senseless war. The miscalculation remains that should stop at this point or this will mean a significant, you know, problems for him at home. 
 
So, this is a war, really, for Vladimir Putin's  survival. Which he has been trying to convince the Russians that it is a war of survival of Russia, which is obviously nonsense to all of us. 
 
So, expect to hear this from his speech, today. He may have re-written it in light of Biden's kind of upstaging him in Kyiv. Because you remember, early in the war, it was Vladimir Putin who was hoping to walk down, you know, the streets of central Kyiv. Instead, it was Biden. What a slap on Vladimir Putin's face, obviously.
 
But in all accounts, we see that Vladimir Putin, you know, has not been dissuaded from this war. Just like -- as I said in this clip that you showed. This remains his goal, his maximus goal: to destroy Ukraine if he cannot control it. 
 
And, you know, by his visit, you know, Biden has further involved America and its legitimacy, its credibility with the fate of Ukraine. Which is now the -- fighting for Western civilization. 
 
VAUSE: And to the Ukrainian president, Zelenskyy, two days before the Russian invasion. A very young-looking President Zelenskyy. Here he is. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ZELENSKYY (through translator): We understand that there will be no war. There will not be an all-out war against Ukraine. And there will not be an escalation, a broad escalation from Russia. If there is, then we will put Ukraine on the war footing.  
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: At that point, Zelenskyy was staring down the Russians, and he was just trying to hold the country together. And the bridges (ph) of doom which followed have all been well-documented. So, too, the incredible, against-all-odds victories by Ukraine.
 
When you look back at the past year, do you think about those David and Goliath battles, and the fact that Ukraine has won them? And that you're still there and you are still fighting? Or is there a sense of loss for the lives cut short, for the families torn apart, for towns and cities laid waste? How do you deal with the last 12 months? 
 
ZALMAYEV: I mean, I cannot begin to unpack in this short interview the sort of complex, you know, feelings, this bag of emotions and feelings that go through one's mind.
 
Well, first of all, I'm still sitting in the same room in my apartment from where I was giving interviews to you. So this is the overarching kind of feeling that we have withstood this test off time, this incredible trial and tribulation. 
 
Ukraine still stands. This is what President Biden could not keep repeating. You know, and he said he found it astounding, just like his generals found it astounding, that Ukraine lasted more than a week. 
 
It just shows how many actors were wrong when this war started. We're still here. And this is incredibly uplifting moment and it feels like the worst is yet to come. We have overcome this fear of the world's great -- second greatest army, of the Russian bear. 
 
But, paradoxically, the worst may yet to come. As once again, we may be entering this phase of attrition, more destruction to come. 
 
But, you know what? I'm not seeing signs in Ukraine of capitulation, of wanting to sit down at a table with the Russians prematurely. We still have ways to go before we can confidently enter into any negotiations. 
 
VAUSE: Peter, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us. Please stay safe. Hope to talk to you soon. Thank you.
 
ZALMAYEV: Thank you. 
 
VAUSE: Cheers. 
 
Well, still ahead, Cyclone Freddy rolls onto Mauritius. Meteorologist Britley Ritz will join us from the CNN Weather Center to let us know what's happening. That's after the break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
VAUSE: Cyclone Freddy is turning towards Mauritius and Madagascar, packing strong winds and heavy rain. Madagascar emergency teams are bracing for floods and landslides in four regions. 
 
Meteorologist Britley Ritz at the CNN Weather Center with the very latest on the forecast. What are we looking at here? 
 
BRITLEY RITZ, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Right now, we're watching Freddy move in on Madagascar as a strong and very powerful cyclone moving in, as we speak, expected to make landfalls sometime throughout the evening, in early morning hours, on the country. 
 
Right now, as it's gone through its eyewall replacements cycle, still's placing very strong, with winds around the center of 205 kilometers per hour. That makes it a Category 3 storm, a major hurricane, in reference to the Saffir-Simpson scale. Somewhere near Mangari [SIC], where we can -- Mananjary, rather, as it
 
 makes landfall within the upcoming 12 to 24 hours. 
 
Expect this to continue West, Northwest as it presses into the Mozambique channel. When it does so, it will significantly weaken as it moves over Madagascar. 
 
Making a second landfall sometime within the next 72 to 96 hours, still as a very powerful cyclone, although weakening as it moves through the channel itself. 
 
Heavy rain expected through the system, especially near Manakara, where we can expect roughly around 100 to 150 millimeters of rain over where the next three days. 
 
The system, itself, will then move into the Southern parts of Africa, still dropping quite a bit of rain out that direction. To typically, Madagascar, on average, picks up a Category 1 storm for the Atlantic hurricane basin. Typically, only one.
 
Over the last year since 2022, six named storms. So this is kind of an anomalous situation, with Cyclone Freddy and, really, for over the past six storms as it moved in on Madagascar -- John. 
 
VAUSE: Britley, thank you so much. Britley Ritz there with the very latest. We appreciate the update.
