THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.

BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: World leaders at the G7 summit just released a joint communique on China criticizing the country for things like supplying the Russian war machine and China's dealings with Iran. A White 
 
House official spoke to reporters after the statement was released and said this, quote: As time goes on, it's more clear that President Xi's ambition is to restore China's dominance. There was also an observation that China appears to believe that democracies are in structural decline. So Xi now appears to be taking tactical risks to realize his strategic ambition. 
 
Joining us now is retired Army Major General James Spider Marks to talk a little bit more about what's coming out of this summit. I wonder, sir, what realistic steps, besides harsh words like this, G7 countries can take to counter China?
 
MAJ. GEN. JAMES "SPIDER" MARKS (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, if you have a unified voice, that's one thing that's very, very positive. And then all those nations, to different degrees, will sign up for different kinds of operations and engagements, coalition engagements, multiple nations coming together. 
 <br>[15:35:03]
 
So presence in the South China Sea, in the vicinity of Taiwan, safe passage of commerce through the South China Sea, about $5 trillion a year goes through there, and our U.S. Navy ensures that safe passage. There's an opportunity for other nations to get involved as well. But also there's an opportunity for the United States also -- not an opportunity, it's a mandate for the United States to figure out where are the areas where it and its other allies can figure out and can cooperate with China.
 
We can't simply stiff arm them going forward. We have to acknowledge they've got challenges, and clearly we've got to embrace what we have in common. You know, very often there's a narrative now going around the United States and China is very much like fraternal twins.
 
They've got some significant differences, but they've got a lot in common. Let's figure out what those are. KEILAR: I also want to talk with you about Russia, because today the director of the Missile Defense Agency said a new U.S. military test of its hypersonic capabilities was a huge success. Of course, this is happening at a time where Russia has warships and a submarine in the harbor in Havana, 90 miles from Florida, carrying hypersonic missiles with a range of about 600 miles. And you also have the U.S. advertising that it has a nuclear submarine in Guantanamo Bay. How significant is this hypersonic test?
 
MARKS: Well, it is significant because it advances this capability. There's a level of confidence that you have to have not only in the offensive use of that weapon system, but what are the defensive measures, what are the indicators that an opponent, that an enemy chooses to use a hypersonic. 
 
And to your point about Cuba, the United States Navy and our allies have a very long history of working in very close proximity, formerly with the former Soviet Union and with the Russians moving forward and with other nations.
 
The fact that the Russians are in Cuba certainly is disturbing, but they've done this before. I mean, they were there in 08, they were there in 13, 18, and 19. So clearly where we are now with the war in Ukraine, provocations by Russia, and with Russia dealing with a whole host of internal challenges.
 
You know, their economy is shattered. Putin has no opposition. But he's dealing with a ton of pressure right now. This is an opportunity to do a head fake, to get everybody to notice something other than the real challenges he's dealing with.
 
KEILAR: Yes, and to that point, I mean, you have President Biden and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy signing this 10-year security pact, the G7 announcing a $50 billion loan to Ukraine that's backed by interest on frozen Russian assets. And Putin today had some pretty strong words for the West. He was saying they're approaching the point of no return.
 
He's trying to project strength. But I wonder if you see him as an emboldened figure or do you see him as a weak figure?
 
MARKS: Strategically, he's very weak. I mean, he's setting the tone of our policies moving forward. So I think I might want to step back from that in that he's establishing a strategic engagement context.
 
But he's only achieving tactical advantages at this point. Look at what he's trying to do in Kharkiv. He's trying to complete what he has described as a strategic objective to establish a buffer zone between Russia and the West.
 
And he's done that quite effectively. He's got Crimea, he's got the land bridge, he's got the Donbas. Now he wants to fight in Kharkiv.
 
But look what's happening in Kharkiv. His military continues to demonstrate that it's feckless, that it's incompetent. There's little that he can achieve there without, over time, putting good money after bad, young men in to be slaughtered.
 
How long he can do that is only a matter of an estimate on intelligence community experts. How long is Russia going to be able to do that? But bear in mind there is no other pressure that he feels to stop that.
 
There's got to be an internal mechanism, and there may be an opportunity when he realizes that he's not going to be able to achieve anything other than this buffer zone that that is where he takes a pause. That gives the Ukrainians an opportunity, with the largesse and the support that they have from NATO and the U.S., to take advantage of that.
 
KEILAR: Well, that's a lot of Russian families whose lives are being blown up. And at a certain point, you'd think you'd have to pay the price. General Marks, always appreciate your insights. Thank you so much.
 
MARKS: Thanks, Brianna.
 
KEILAR: Tens of millions of Americans that depend on prescriptions to treat their ADHD are being warned of another possible medication shortage, and this could be tied to executives arrested on fraud charges. We'll explain next.
 <br>[15:40:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN HOST: The CDC is warning that it's likely going to get even harder to get ADHD medicine amid an ongoing shortage. This new advisory comes after two executives from a telehealth startup were arrested yesterday in Los Angeles. Federal investigators allege that the pair committed fraud and over-prescribed ADHD meds to people who didn't really need them.
 
CNN's Meg Tirrell joins us now. So, Meg, tell us how this could impact the supply of these medications more broadly.
 
MEG TIRRELL, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Boris, there's already been an ongoing shortage of ADHD medications like Adderall and other stimulants, as you pointed out, and this has been something that's been really tough on families and patients who depend on these medicines. 
 
Now the CDC is out with a health warning, saying essentially after these indictments of two executives from this company Done Global, that this could exacerbate the shortage and make it difficult for people who depended on this service and similar ones potentially to access treatment. They're also warning that potentially if patients then seek treatment outside the regulated health care system, essentially turning to the illicit drug market, that that could put them at high risk of injury and overdose because a lot of these pills, they say, in the illicit drug market are adulterated with substances like fentanyl. So they are putting out this warning so that health care providers, the public health community, and patients are aware of this situation. They say they don't know exactly how many people this could affect, but potentially 30,000 to 50,000, they say, adults could be affected because of these indictments affecting this telehealth company -- guys.
 
SANCHEZ: What is it that Done Global allegedly did that broke the law?
 <br>[15:45:02]
 
TIRRELL: So the Department of Justice said in its indictment where they arrested essentially two of the executives from this company, they are alleging a $100 million health care fraud scheme where they say they essentially prescribed more than 40 million pills of Adderall and other stimulants. They say that they directed prescribers to focus on drug seekers and told them to prescribe Adderall and other stimulants even if the members didn't qualify for those medications. They say they did things like putting monthly auto refills in place and paying prescribers not for the time spent caring for patients after the initial consultation, but instead solely based on the number of patients who got prescriptions, guys.
 
CNN has reached out to the parties involved. We heard back from the attorney for the clinical president, Dr. Brody, who said he has pleaded not guilty. We have not been able to reach the founder and CEO and we have not heard back from the company Done Global -- guys.
 
SANCHEZ: Meg Tirrell, thanks so much for the update. 
 
So you've heard of the NFL and the NBA. Coming up, we're going to talk to the co-founder of the MLE, Major League Eating, ahead of this year's Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest and that big-time legend, the competitor who is not taking part.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
SANCHEZ: Sun's out, buns out. I'm not sure what that has to do with Joey Chestnut, but it's in the script.
 
KEILAR: We just wanted to make you say it.
 
SANCHEZ: Yes. The hot dog eating champion, and truly a legend in competitive eating. There is no one like him. He's at the center of a major controversy rocking competitive eating this week.
 
Chestnut is out of this year's Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest, the one that has made him a familiar name.
 <br>[15:50:00]
 
KEILAR: Major League Eating says he's ineligible to compete in the chomp down because he signed a deal with Plant-Based Impossible Foods. And the co-founder of Major League Eating, George Shea, is with us now to talk about this. George, it is a long-standing rule that participants in Nathan's Contest -- in the Nathan's Contest, cannot represent a rival brand. Tell us why.
 
GEORGE SHEA, CO-FOUNDER, MAJOR LEAGUE EATING: Well, I mean, this is a contest that is held by Nathans and always has been. It's the Nathans Contest. So, to have someone win the Nathan's Contest or participate, and then two days later say, but I'm endorsing Impossible Hot Dogs, that created a problem.
 
It's never been an issue before. It's always been this sort of one element of exclusivity that you would have to honor. And that's been the way it has been for the last 20 years that Joey's been there.
 
But no one's, you know, Joey and his members -- his managers, are looking to make money. We're all good with that. But that is a conflict, and that is why we're sort of at an impasse.
 
SANCHEZ: We're playing the video in fast motion so you can see just how many hot dogs he eats. It's like 76 in 10 minutes, which is just insane. It's insane.
 
But as we're playing that clip, I realize that he actually knocks a guy out. It was a protester. There were folks that are opposed to eating meat, and this was, I think, during the most recent contest.
 
He knocks away this protester that's, like, trying to grab him and interrupt the contest. Do you find it ironic that now he is endorsed by this brand that is, like, supporting vegan hot dogs?
 
SHEA: Well, you know, any brand of hot dog would be a conflict. But I think that, you know, given past protests, there is some irony there. But I would point out that we love Joey.
 
Like, Joey's an American hero. We want him there. Everybody wants him there, so we want to work this out.
 
An example of his heroism, he's got a protester by the neck, and he's still got his hot dogs here. I mean, the only thing he could have done is continue eating in the headlock. So, you know, the fans justifiably want him there as do we.
 
SANCHEZ: Yes.
 
KEILAR: All right, what should we be looking for? What should we be looking forward to with this year's contest? Because it's always such a crowd-pleaser.
 
SHEA: Well, look, if Joey -- we are actively trying to resolve this with Joey. I believe all parties want to get it done. If all parties want to get something done, it can get done, right? That's our disposition. If he doesn't come, we're going to have a massive contest between four other eaters who are at that 50 mark, 51, 52 hot dogs and buns.
 
And there's talk of other people who've wanted to come back heroes from the past, so it could be very interesting. But right now, our focus is on trying to resolve this issue with him and his management team. If we can do that, Joey will be at the 4th of July, and if not, the 4th of July contest will go on with some great eaters, but we would prefer to have him there.
 
SANCHEZ: Of course, it will be entertaining, no doubt, as it always is. I'm wondering, do you have any guess as to whether someone can rival that world record of 76 hot dogs in 10 minutes? Because, again, it's hard to believe that's even humanly possible.
 
SHEA: Well, let me just say this. No-one ever thought anyone would beat Kobayashi, who ate 50, 5-0, and Joey beat him, beat him again, beat him again. So there's always the possibility.
 
But to me, someone who is probably among the greatest experts in the world on competitive eating, I cannot imagine it. There's no-one currently, and you've got some great eaters out there, who can come within 20 hot dogs. So I don't even understand how that could happen.
 
But, you know, one way or another, there are great eaters out there, and it would be very, very interesting to see a hard-fought contest when we don't know who's going to win. On the other hand, I think people tune in on the 4th of July almost as a tradition to just watch Joey Chestnut dominate. So obviously that's what we and everybody else would prefer.
 
KEILAR: Yes, we'll have to see if he comes back. That would be very cool. I do need to ask you, George, because I was yesterday years old, truly yesterday, when I learned that one name for a hot dog is a glizzy. I didn't know that. I'm sure you're well aware of this. What do you think of that? I mean, can you explain that to us? Is this going to stick around for a while?
 
SHEA: This started about three or four years ago, and my brother, Rich, who's much more sort of into common culture or has a better sort of sense of the world, they were all over, and I'm going, what is everybody talking about with a Glizzy, Glizzy Gladiators? 
 <br>[15:55:04]
 
I have no idea where it came from. And frankly, I'll be honest, I don't quite like it. And that may be controversial, but I prefer hot dog.
 
KEILAR: Frankfurter. I mean, there's all kinds of things.
 
SANCHEZ: Glizzy Gladiator, though, when he says it like that, has a ring to it.
 
KEILAR: Glizzy Gobbler. Look, George, it's been awesome hanging out with you, and I have to tell you that just because it's the last Friday at the end of the school year, this morning, my six-year-old, when I asked him, what do you want for breakfast? And he said, I want a hot dog.
 
And I no joke made him a hot dog for breakfast, and I'm going to tell him that we had this conversation today, I think he'll get a kick out of it. So, George Shea, thank you.
 
SANCHEZ: He's on the right track. Thanks, George. 
 
SHEA: Thank you.
 
KEILAR: We're back here in a few minutes.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
KEILAR: Before we go, a titanic admission from actress Kate Winslet concerning one of the most famous scenes that she's ever appeared in on scene. The British actress telling Vanity Fair that her big smooch there, right there, with Leonardo DiCaprio on the ship's bow during the 1997 film was, quote, not all it cracked up -- it's cracked up to be.
 <br>[16:00:00]
 
SANCHEZ: Well, yes, they were on a boat and it was going really fast. Imagine the wind. She goes on to say they were wearing so much makeup during the filming that it looked like she was sucking a caramel chocolate bar after each take because the makeup would just come off of Leo and onto her.
 
I can't wait to hear Leo's reaction to that. Do we have official word on where they stand on the door debate? Because we disagree about that.
 
KEILAR: Don't get me going. OK, what she didn't address was that.
 
SANCHEZ: Yes.
 
KEILAR: Because she knows, don't tread on that.
 
SANCHEZ: No. 
 
KEILAR: Don't go there. 
 
SANCHEZ: She could have rose. There was room for Jack, all right?
 
"THE LEAD" with Jake Tapper starts right now.  
 
KEILAR: And Jake.
