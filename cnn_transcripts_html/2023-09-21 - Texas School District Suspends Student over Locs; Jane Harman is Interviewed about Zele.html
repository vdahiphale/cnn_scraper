DARRESHA GEORGE, SON SUSPENDED OVER HIS HAIRSTYLE: I want them to change their policies. I want them to stop being discriminatory against black and brown kids. Not just mines, but any other black and brown kid. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR: So, that is the mother of a 17-year-old student speaking out against a school district in Texas that has suspended her son because of his hair. Darryl George wears locks but his school, Barbers Hill High School, suspended him twice because they say that wearing his hair that way violates the district's dress code. Now, the school is asking the courts to step in and clarify whether its policy is legal. 
 
Ryan Young has been tracking this story for us. 
 
I think a lot of people waking up this morning are going to be sort of stunned that this is even a thing that someone would be suspended for, but it is and now it's going through the courts? 
 
RYAN YOUNG, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It is, but if you talk to a lot of brown people, they say they've faced this before. 
 
HARLOW: Yes.
 
YOUNG: Look, 17-year-old Darryl George and his mother are vowing to continue to fight with school administrators over his hair. 
 
Now, it's important for everyone to see. Take a look at how his hair is pulled up, styled and wrapped close to his head. Darryl attends Barbers High School, just outside of Houston. They say his hair violates the district grooming code, which states male students' hair will not extend at any time below the eyebrows or below the earlobes. The policy goes on to state, male students' hair must not extend below the top of a t-shirt collar or be gathered or worn in a style that would allowing their hair to extend below the top of a t-shirt collar. The dress code also goes on to say they want kids dressed in a clean
 
 and neat manner. But Darryl was suspended around the same time the state of Texas new CROWN Act was put into place, and that stands for "Creating a Respectful and Open World for National Hair." The act prohibits race-based discrimination, which is the denial of employment and educational opportunities because of hair texture or protective hairstyles, including braids, locks, twists or bantu knots. 
 <br>[06:35:08]
 
As you can imagine, Darryl's mom is willing to fight over this one. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DARRESHA GEORGE, SON SUSPENDED OVER HIS HAIRSTYLE: I'm trying to figure out how he's getting violated when y'all never seen his hair let down. How do y'all know it's below his eyebrows. 
 
His grades are failing. Like, they're going down drastically. He's not getting a proper education. He's not getting proper instructions. 
 
DARRYL GEORGE, SUSPENDED OVER HIS HAIRSTYLE: I'd like to go back to class and do what I - do what I do -- do what I need to do to get my education. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
YOUNG: Yes. 
 
And, Poppy, look, this extends beyond just this fight inside the classroom. There's a - obviously a reason why the CROWN Act was put into place. There's a lot of people who have had their hair be put in front and center when it comes to employment, getting the right jobs, education. And, of course, when you see that loc style, a lot of people are trying to move to the natural hairstyle. It's not a cheap hairstyle that he has on top of his head there. And it is all neat, close to the head. 
 
But that conversation is now extending. The internet is all over this one because, obviously, people believe the next step was going to take place with the CROWN Act. That school is now basically saying they want clarification when it comes to how long hair can be with this school regulation. 
 
Poppy.
 
HARLOW: And is -- are they going to keep him out of school until the courts figure this out or does he get to go back soon? 
 
YOUNG: And that is the big question at this point. It will be interesting to see what happens because it seems like he's being penalized in a way because of his hair. And, at the end of the day, isn't this all about education? That is the big question. 
 
HARLOW: Ryan Young, I'm glad you brought us that. Thank you. 
 
YOUNG: Thank you.
 
HARLOW: Phil.
 
PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN ANCHOR: Well, also this morning, this jarring story. An urgent manhunt is underway in Indiana for a murder suspect after he was released from jail by mistake just two days after his arrest. Kevin Mason walked out of the detention center on September 13th due to what a sheriff's office described as, quote, faulty records reviewed by civilian staff. Officials say the clerk thought she was correcting duplicate bookings and removed two holds on Mason's file. Two employees have been fired for allowing him to go free. Now, the sheriff admits chronic understaffing is part of the problem, saying, quote, they're underpaid. That's not an excuse, but it's a fact. Now they're scrambling to locate Mason. Mason's girlfriend was arrested Wednesday afternoon on suspicion of assisting a criminal. 
 
HARLOW: So, very soon, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine will meet face-to-face with some of the people who do not want to keep funding Ukraine's fight against Russia. What to expect when he returns to Washington. That's ahead. 
 
MATTINGLY: And superstar soccer player Leonel Messi had to leave last night's Inter Miami game in the first half after an apparent injury. He was subbed in the 37th minute against Toronto FC. It's not clear how hurt Messi is or how he hurt himself at all. Inter Miami's coach says Messi, and another player who appeared to be injured, will be evacuated. Inter Maimi went on to beat Toronto, even without Messi, 4- 0. 
 
Stay with us. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[06:41:36]
 
HARLOW: Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will be in Washington today. He is trying to convince lawmakers that the United States should keep providing this level of military assistance and funding to Ukraine. The last time he was in Washington was in December of last year. He addressed that joint session of Congress and was met with loud applause from both sides. But this year, Kevin McCarthy did not invite Zelenskyy to address the House. He will meet with McCarthy, though, I should note, behind closed doors. 
 
Here's what the House speaker said in March of last year versus just this week. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA) (March 10, 2022): This is an unwarranted war that they did not ask for, but they're willing to defend the right of freedom. We should stand with anyone who's willing to defend freedom. 
 
I think that room's divided to defend and help Ukraine get the weaponry they need to defend themselves. MCCARTHY (September 19, 2023): Is Zelenskyy elected to Congress? Is he
 
 our president? I don't think I have to commit anything. I have questions for him. Whereas the accountability in the money we already sent? What is the plan for victory? 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARLOW: Joining us now is the chair of the Freedom House's Board of Trustees, and former Democratic congressman, Jane Harman. 
 
It's good to have you here.
 
JANE HARMAN CHAIRMAN, FREEDOM HOUSE BOARD OF TRUSTEES: Thank you.
 
HARLOW: This also comes on a day when McCarthy's proposal here to keep the government running has no, you know, additional funding for Ukraine in it. 
 
The majority of the American people, not by a lot, but 55 percent do not support increased aid to Ukraine. Where do you think this goes? 
 
HARMAN: Well, I think they don't support more reckless spending. I think that's the bottom line here. They want to rein in the budget. But this is not the way to do it. 
 
Supporting Ukraine is essential to freedom in the rest of the world. If Russia is not stopped in Ukraine, Russia moves into Europe -- Putin's already said that -- and threatens other parts of the world, too, which is why it's so important the NATO is - the NATO alliance is growing stronger and is even talking about expanding in some ways to Asia and why it's so important that the Biden administration is shoring up other parts of the world. So, let's start there. 
 
The funding is the right thing to do. And the hypocrisy of all these people who supported it five minutes ago and now don't is just rich. 
 
In this case, what I hope happens is, there are small meetings, no need for a big clown show in the House, sadly. I served there for nine terms, but it is a different place. No need for that. Small meetings, I know, because I've talked to them, that Republican chairs of major committees in the House support increased funding, as does the Senate, starting with Mitch McConnell. So, I hope that there is a compromise, something like aid for Ukraine, maybe more border aid, maybe a CR or a budget, I imagine a CR, and the establishment of a fiscal commission, much like Simpson-Bowles, in anyone remembers that from days' past -- 
 
HARLOW: We remember well. 
 
HARMAN: To put on the table everything, spending, entitlements, I'll say it, entitlements, and taxes and try to come to a comprehensive resolution that everyone can buy into. 
 
Sadsly, the Obama administration, or President Obama, and Paul Ryan, then the speaker of the House, walked away from Simpson-Bowles. And Ryan was on the committee. And I think we have paid a huge price in prestige and responsibility for that. MATTINGLY: It took me years to get over the nightmares after covering
 
 that committee on Capitol Hill. So, I appreciate you bringing that back for me. 
 
You mentioned Mitch McConnell. And this is actually something that I've been interested in the last several weeks. 
 <br>[06:45:00]
 
He has gone to the floor almost daily and made the pitch for Ukraine aid. 
 
HARMAN: Yes. 
 
MATTINGLY: And made it in a way that I think if you read underneath what he's saying, it seems to be implicit criticism that the Biden administration is not doing a good enough job of selling it, of explaining the why and also explaining where this has actually come from. It's not necessarily just straight taking taxpayers dollars and sending it over. 
 
HARMAN: Right. Right.
 
MATTINGLY: Do you think the Biden administration hasn't done a good enough job of explaining how this all works? 
 
HARMAN: Well, I don't think we have done, over recent years, a good job of explaining why the U.S. needs to be engaged in the world. There's a growing, sadly, isolationist sentiment on the right of the Republican Party, and a few Democrats don't get it either. I think Biden is doing a good job of selling it. I think his Tony Blinken and he and Jake Sullivan all have explained why U.S. engagement matters. And he's walking the walk. I mean he has helped to revive NATO. I mean Ukraine was - was the impetus for that. 
 
But NATO is now a strong and modern defense alliance and we are a key part of it. We pay about 50 percent of the funding for NATO's operations in Ukraine. And I hope the other countries will step up more. I agree with Donald Trump about that. Might be one of the few things I agree with him about, but - but, hey. But I think Biden's selling it well. 
 
Mitch McConnell has to differentiate himself from Biden because he's leading the Republican caucus in the Senate. But he is an institutionalist and he strongly supports Ukraine funding. And I commend him for that. 
 
HARLOW: Let's turn to Israel. President Biden meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu here in New York yesterday and inviting him to Washington. Let's just take a quick listen to what - what they said. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're going to discuss some of the hard issues, and that is upholding democratic values that lie at the heart of our partnership, including checks and balances in our systems and preserving a path to a negotiated two-state solution and ensuring that Iran never, never acquires a nuclear weapon. 
 
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER: I believe that working together we can make history and create a better future for the region and beyond. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARLOW: This comes in the context of, you know, what he is doing in Israel and the far-right government and these judicial reforms et cetera. You have been impressed by Tom Friedman's analysis of what he's asked Biden to do and press Netanyahu on. What do you make of what we saw yesterday? 
 
HARMAN: Well, there has to be a connection between the U.S. and Israel. Let's understand that we were the first country in 1948 to recognize the existence of a pluralist democracy and homeland for the Jews in the Middle East. And I think all of us appreciate that. And there's been strong bipartisan support for Israel forever. 
 
Certain moves of his administration are troubling, certainly to me, personally. I think maintaining the pluralist democracy is central to Israel's future. And the good news there, if there is some, is that there are protesters every weekend. Hundreds of thousands of protesters protesting peacefully in the country. That is some evidence of a democracy. 
 
But, at any rate, I think that the future here is to keep the relationship, quietly coax Bibi to perhaps change a few directions. But also, if this deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel ever happens, there will be some requirements. Certainly I think there will be. 
 
On both sides, but on the Saudi side and on the Arab side, Israel will have to find a way to take active steps to promote a Palestinian state. I'm not applauding the leadership of the Palestinian Authority. I think it is corrupt and needs - I would hope they would change to something more modern and democratic. But over time the two-state solution is the best protection for Israel. And I think Bibi's far- right government is not open to that. So maybe, just maybe, that coalition will change in Israel, coalition will change in the Palestinian Authority, and some more steps will be taken by the Arab neighbors and there will be a more peaceful region. And I think that's Biden's vision. Our policy is to support a two-state solution. It still is. And I think that's the right policy. 
 
HARLOW: Not the reality on the ground right now with this government for sure.
 
HARMAN: Not now. Not now. 
 
HARLOW: Former Democratic Congressman Jane Harman, thanks for being at the table. 
 
MATTINGLY: Well, history has been unintentionally made in space. An American has spent a full year orbiting earth, but that wasn't actually the original plan. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE AND DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT: If you had known at the time you launched that you were going to be up in space for a full year instead of six months, would you have still done it? 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[06:53:56]
 
MATTINGLY: An historic milestone for NASA astronaut Frank Rubio, breaking the record as the American -- first American to spend a full year in space. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Godspeed. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And liftoff. 
 
A sunset start to the mission of Rubio, Prokopyev, and Petelin, to the International Space Station. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MATTINGLY: He rocketed into space exactly 365 days ago and then spent an extra six months aboard the International Space Station because of trouble with a Russian ride home. 
 
CNN's Kristin Fisher reports. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And liftoff. 
 
KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE AND DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT: A few weeks before NASA astronaut Frank Rubio launched to the International Space Station with two cosmonauts on a Russian Soyuz rocket, I spoke with him about the geopolitical tensions that he'd be leaving behind on earth. 
 
FISHER (on camera): Did you ever have any second thoughts about flying on a Russian Soyuz in the middle of this conflict with Ukraine?
 
FRANK RUBIO, NASA ASTRONAUT: You know, again, not really because I do - I trust my crew wholeheartedly. If anything, right, there's a little bit of nerves about the whole big picture of going to spice for the first time, spending six months up there. 
 
FISHER (voice over): But six months quickly turned into a full year after his ride home, the Soyuz spacecraft, was struck by a small object in space, puncturing the Soyuz's radiator and spewing coolant into space.
 <br>[06:55:09] UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A stream of particles.
 
FISHER: Russia's space agency, Roscosmos, decided the spacecraft was unsafe and a replacement Soyuz would need to be sent to bring the crew home. For Rubio, who was on his first space flight and had just become the first Salvadoran American to go space, it meant being away from his wife and four children for double the time that he'd been preparing for. 
 
FISHER (on camera): If you had known at the time you launched that you were going to be up in space for a full year instead of six months, would you have still done it? 
 
FRANK RUBIO, NASA ASTRONAUT: Yes, hey, Kristin. It's good to talk to you again. 
 
I think it would have depended on when I would have found out. Obviously, if they had asked me up front before you start training, because you do train for a year or two years for your mission, I probably would have declined. And that's only because of family things that were going on this past year. And had I known that I would have had to miss those very important events, I just would have had to say, thank you but no thank you. 
 
But once you commit to the mission, once you're a part of the training, I would have been committed to the mission. 
 
FISHER (voice over): By the time Rubio returns to earth next week, he will have been in space for 371 days, longer than any other American in history, tree spacewalks, conducted dozens of science experiments. But perhaps the most important experiment for this Army doctor turned astronaut, is the one that zero gravity has been conducting on his own body. 
 
RUBIO: The reality is, we're not standing. We're not walking. We're not bearing our own weight. And so it will be anywhere from two to six months before I essentially say that I feel normal. 
 
FISHER: And normal is exactly what Rubio's craving. Spending time with his family and time outside these walls, on earth. 
 
RUBIO: Up here we kind of have the constant hum of machinery that's keeping us alive and so I'm looking forward to just being outside and enjoying the peace and quiet. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
FISHER: If all goes according to plan, Rubio will be returning to earth next Wednesday. 
 
Phil and Poppy, just imagine what that first breath of fresh air must feel like after spending a year, essentially, you know, living inside of a machine. 
 
MATTINGLY: Yes. It's a great piece. Great story. Very angry family. 
 
Kristin Fisher, thank you so much.
 
HARLOW: Wait, before you go, welcome back. 
 
FISHER: Thank you.
 
HARLOW: We have missed your glowing face on television and your great reporting. 
 
FISHER: Oh, thanks.
 
HARLOW: And we're just so glad you're back. And congrats on the little one. 
 
FISHER: Thanks. It's good to be back. 
 
HARLOW: You go tit.
 
Ahead, more on the new CNN polling that is promising - promising, I should say, for former President Trump and Nikki Haley, but not good for Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.
