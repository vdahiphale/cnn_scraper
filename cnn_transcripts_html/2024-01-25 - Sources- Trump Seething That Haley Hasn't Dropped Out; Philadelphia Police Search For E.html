JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: What do voters say about the idea of mental sharpness?
 
HARRY ENTEN, CNN SENIOR DATA REPORTER: Yes, I hope my mental sharpness is with me, although with this long week, who knows anymore? All right. Mental sharpness to serve effectively as president. What do we see here? This is among the general electorate.
 
Look. This is interesting because, in fact, the plurality of voters say no, Donald Trump does not have the mental effect -- sharpness to serve effectively as president. Just 47 percent do.
 
But look at the Joe Biden numbers. The Joe Biden numbers on this are absolutely crazy. 69 percent of voters say that, in fact, Joe Biden does not have the mental sharpness to serve effectively as president. So, yes, voters aren't necessarily in love with the idea of Donald Trump serving effectively as president, but they really are not in love with the idea of Joe Biden having the mental sharpness to serve -- 
 
BERMAN: Those folks on the top half of this for a second.
 
ENTEN: Yes.
 
BERMAN: Because we still are in a Republican primary.
 
ENTEN: Yes.
 
BERMAN: Is there an avenue for Nikki Haley to be going after Donald Trump on this issue in a Republican primary?
 
ENTEN: Right. So, this is the general electorate, let's look among Republicans, right? Just Trump have the mental soundness to serve effectively as president?
 
Among Republican voters, a very different ballgame here than what we saw among the general electorate. 83 percent of them say, yes, he does have the mental soundness to serve effectively as president. Just 15 percent say no. And this is something I think we've seen throughout the Nikki Haley messaging.
 
BERMAN: Right.
 
ENTEN: She is focusing her messaging on a general electorate. The GOP primary electorate is just a completely different universe. And I think that's part of the reason why Donald Trump has this significant lead he does.
 
BERMAN: South Carolina, no party registration.
 
ENTEN: Yes.
 
BERMAN: I'm just saying if he's going to be -- if he's going to stay in there, Democrats can vote in a theory in that primary.
 
ENTEN: They absolutely can. Of course, in New Hampshire, where independents could vote, it may be the rates closer, but -- 
 
BERMAN: Yes, right.
 
ENTEN: Obviously, Trump still won.
 
BERMAN: All right. Let's talk about Joe Biden. Because this number -- his numbers on this have not been getting better.
 
ENTEN: No. They've gotten significantly worse. And I think that this is something that I'm not sure all of us have necessarily taken into account. You know, Joe Biden was -- is obviously the oldest president ever, and he was running to be so back in 2020. But back then, Biden has the mental sharpness to serve effectively as president.
 
The majority, 51 percent said, yes. Now, it's down to just 28 percent. That 69 percent has ballooned from that 43 percent. It's gotten much worse for him. And it's part of the messaging that I think Donald Trump's going to use in the fall.
 
BERMAN: Harry Enten, sharpest attack, as always.
 
ENTEN: Thank you.
 
BERMAN: Thank you very much. Great to see you, Harry.
 
ENTEN: Nice to see you.
 
BERMAN: With us now, CNN political analyst and Washington bureau chief for the Boston Globe, the paper of record, Jackie Kucinich. Also, here is CNN senior political commentator, Ana Navarro.
 
I want to ask you, Jackie, first about what we did see last night, not specifically Nikki Haley talking about Donald Trump's age, but Nikki Haley at all in South Carolina, campaigning sounding very much like she is in this. What do you think?
 
JACKIE KUCINICH, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: I mean, it's not only -- not only yesterday. She's got plans to go -- she's got rallies through the weekend. And it really seems like she's going all-in on South Carolina. I mean, it is her home turf. But as Harry points out, it's also a very Republican Donald Trump loyal state. So, she's going to have to convince folks and remind them what she was like as governor.
 
And also, it's not going to be happening in a vacuum. Trump is going to be pouring money into that state. And he clearly has the South Carolina establishment also to echo some of the things that he's putting out there.
 
BERMAN: So, Ana, you did hear Nikki Haley going after Donald Trump a bit in South Carolina last night. Kate had a terrific interview with Sarah Longwell last hour, someone -- a Republican who was pretty anti- Trump, who wants to see more than what Nikki Haley is doing. Listen to what she said last hour.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SARAH LONGWELL, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: But can I just say one thing on Nikki Haley?
 
KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR: Yes.
 
LONGWELL: Which is -- you know, it is time for her to go the full Liz Cheney, right? She is -- there is no path for her. There is no math for her.
 
This Republican Party has changed to the point where it -- Donald Trump owns this party. But Nikki Haley has a chance to go down swinging and to be a legend and burn the boats. And I want to see that from her because the party is not going to have her back.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BERMAN: Be a legend. Burn the boats, Ana. First of all, A., do you think Nikki Haley would ever do that? B., would it make any difference?
 
ANA NAVARRO, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, Nikki Haley's not Liz Cheney, right? She's from South Carolina. They've got -- (AUDIO GAP)
 
BERMAN: Nikki Haley is not, in fact, Liz Cheney.
 
NAVARRO: I don't -- Look. He's nothing -- 
 
BERMAN: Go ahead. Are you still talking, Ana? All right, we have a connection issue with Anna there. Jackie, I'll have you answer that question, and Ana can listen in -- participatory listening.
 
KUCINICH: Well, so, I don't think that's who Nikki Haley is. And we kind of already seen that strategy, and his name was Chris Christie. And he didn't get very far. He left it on the field. He ran a very Liz Cheney ask campaign, if you will, with just going after Trump relentlessly, say -- like, speaking his truth, and really using every opportunity possible to remind voters what happened in the Trump presidency, particularly at the end, and what was -- what's going on in the courts.
 <br>[11:35:18]
 
Haley hasn't done that. Even now when she is attacking the former president, she's not talking about the ongoing court cases. She's not really talking about January 6.
 
She's not talking -- she's talking about things he's saying that aren't true. It's about what he's saying about her. So, it does -- that just doesn't seem to be what her strategy has been.
 
It's been the let's move on from Trump. Thanks. But next. Rather than he's dangerous for the country, you've got to do -- you've got to vote for me.
 
BERMAN: Again, Ana continues to listen in here smiling. No doubt. Jackie, I want to put a number up on the screen --
 
KUCINICH: How are you, Ana?
 
BERMAN: Which is -- which is the GDP, the gross domestic product, for the last quarter of last year, which you will see hopefully, and if not just take my word for it. 3.3 percent, which was double that what was expected. Will we now hear shouts of what a great economy it is on the campaign trail? Is this everything Biden wanted? And can he take advantage of it?
 
KUCINICH: That has been the question, I think of the Biden campaign. So far, they have been screaming from the rooftops about the economy and have really tried to put it out there. The issue is, and I heard this from voters in New Hampshire, not necessarily Biden voters but you know, people that are on the fence that they don't feel it.
 
They're not feeling that the economy is better. And there is a real disconnect there. And they haven't been able to break through it.
 
Now, whether this starts to actually you know, matter at -- in people's everyday life -- not matter but you know, be felt in people's everyday lives, that remains to be seen, John. But that is a huge, huge question going into the general election, which seems like we're getting closer to.
 
BERMAN: Yes. Some of the consumer confidence numbers are starting to tick up. There was the biggest two-month gain in like 30 years -- 
 
KUCINICH: It's true.
 
BERMAN: Last week. The question is will you start hearing that from voters out there on the trail? Jackie Kucinich, Ana Navarro, and our internet provider, I would like to thank you very much. Sara?
 
SARA SIDNER, CNN ANCHOR: All right. Thank you, John. A manhunt is underway in Philadelphia for a teenager who escaped police custody. He's accused of killing a woman and is awaiting when he fled. The latest on the search nearly 24 hours after his escape. That's ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:41:58]
 
BOLDUAN: Right now, a manhunt in Pennsylvania is underway for 17-year- old Shane Pryor. Here's an image of him right here. He's charged with murder. He's awaiting trial in Philadelphia and police say he escaped custody while being transported to a hospital yesterday. One source tells CNN Pryor likely had help after this escape.
 
CNN's Danny Freeman is in Philadelphia, has much more on what's all happening here. Danny, what are you learning about this?
 
DANNY FREEMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Kate, I spoke to a law enforcement source close to this investigation earlier this morning and was told that investigators believe that this man, Shane Pryor, is still in city limits in Philadelphia, and that's where they're still concentrating their search. But also, as you noted, I was also told that investigators believe he did have help once he ran away from this medical transport. But, Kate, let's take a step back. Again, it's almost exactly 24 hours ago that Shane Pryor, 17 years old, escaped from custody.
 
He was charged with a murder back in 2000 -- excuse me, from -- back in 2020. He was accused of murdering a woman in an alley. He's been awaiting trial though since then. And he's been in the Philadelphia Juvenile Justice Services Center. He was arrested when he was 14 years old.
 
Then yesterday, like I said about 24 hours ago from this exact moment, he was transported from that juvenile detention center to the Children's Hospital Philadelphia when then police say he ran out of the vehicle that he was being transported in and basically evaded capture and has stayed on the run since then. Now, notably, there are a few things that came up in this police press conference yesterday afternoon.
 
First, it appears from the surveillance video that Mr. Pryor was not in any restraints. He had no handcuffs on, no shackles on which was how he was able to run away from those who were transporting him. The other thing that police said is that he was actually seen in other surveillance videos and from other witnesses going from building to building potentially looking for a cell phone or the resources to get out of the area. Well, that law enforcement official that I spoke with this morning says that they believe that he was able to contact someone and that someone has been able to help him.
 
So, it's a bit of a mess. Again, 24 hours later, still no reported confirmed sightings of him at this point. But police are saying this is a dangerous individual, and they're asking Philadelphians or anyone in the area, if you do come in contact with him, don't try to contact him just call police.
 
At this point, we're also I should send -- mention, Kate, I was in contact with his defense attorney. We're expecting to get a comment from the attorney who's been representing him later on today, Kate.
 
BOLDUAN: All right. Danny, thank you so much for that update. Sara?
 
SIDNER: From household name to business tycoon to felon, and her incredible comeback. We get a sneak peek at a CNN original series, "On The Many Lives of Martha Stewart." But first, here's Dr. Sanjay Gupta with today's "CHASING LIFE."
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, host of CNN's Chasing Life podcast. We've all seen this scene in a movie, a character goes through heartbreak and is now surrounded by ice cream, takeout containers, unhealthy snacks. Though this is typically exaggerated, these scenes are rooted in some degree of truth because our emotions do impact how we eat, so either, called comfort foods.
 <br>[11:45:14]
 
Now, research does show that emotional eating is in many ways a biological response. When we have intense feelings, our bodies make these hormones that make us seek out comfort and food. But there are ways to control these cravings.
 
For example, take a tea break. Sipping on beverages like tea can help these emotional cravings pass. I can tell you it works pretty well.
 
Go for busy snacks. That means foods that keep your hands moving, vegetables, and a healthy dip. Pre-proportion some of your favorite snacks to avoid over-indulging. And keep those tempting foods off the kitchen counter.
 
Finally, if what you're doing isn't working, talk to a professional about your emotions and how they might be impacting your dietary choices. And you can hear more about how to optimize your health and chase life wherever you get your podcasts.

SIDNER: For decades, Martha Stewart has made her mark on American culture through her special brand of domestic perfection. Now, the new CNN original series, "The Many Lives Of Martha Stewart," traces Stewart's explosive rise to success. Her staggering fall from grace and her momentous comeback and establishment as a true American icon. Here's a preview.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JAMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR: We're here this afternoon to announce the filing of criminal charges by this office and civil charges by the SEC against Martha Stewart and Peter Bacanovic.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Martha Stewart case was the first time most Americans had probably heard the name James Comey. But what they didn't know is they'd be hearing that name a lot as the years passed. ALLAN CHERNOFF, FORMER CNN CORRESPONDENT: Now, when Comey brought the charges against Martha Stewart, he emphasized we're charging you for lying to the federal authorities.
 
COMEY: This criminal case is about lying. Lying to the FBI, lying to the SEC, and lying to investors. That is conduct that will not be tolerated by anyone.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So ultimately, a decision is made not to prosecute her criminally for insider trading and only charged her with the obstruction of justice and false statements.
 
COMER: Martha Stewart is being prosecuted not because of who she is, but because of what she did.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
SIDNER: Joining us now, you saw him in that clip, Allan Chernoff, a former CNN senior correspondent who covered Martha Stewart for years. I used to watch you covering. I was struck by how young we all were, but I won't get into all of that -- 
 
CHERNOFF: Me too.
 
SIDNER: At the time. James Comey, you see him there, he's like wow. So, that was a part of her fall. And she has shot back up again in the --- in the end row -- risen, back up again. But tell me a little bit about why that case got so much attention.
 
CHERNOFF: Well, stories don't get much better than this when you're a news reporter. The Martha Stewart case was really a modern-day Greek tragedy. Here, you had the goddess of domestic perfection, right?
 
SIDNER: Yes.
 
CHERNOFF: She could cook, bake, style, everything was absolutely perfect. She was the model for not just the United States of America, almost the world.
 
SIDNER: World. Right.
 
CHERNOFF: World famous. Just famous beyond belief. And then, she had this downfall. What was her tragic flaw? Because of a Greek tragedy, you have to have a tragic flaw.
 
SIDNER: If it works.
 
CHERNOFF: Hubris. Excessive pride. Because of her hubris, Martha Stewart could not admit that she had committed a crime, that she had traded stock illegally. So, as a result, she lied to federal investigators.
 
And as we saw in the clip, that was what she was charged with, lying to federal investigators. You can't do that.
 
SIDNER: It wasn't insider trading, which was sort of the overview. It was -- it was the lying about what happened. I do want to ask you because one of the big things that a lot of people talked about during that time, I remember these arguments, even at dinner tables, where people were saying, oh, they're just going after her because she's a woman -- because she's a woman of this stature.
 
I mean, this happens all the time on Wall Street. And like, why is she getting hit like this? What were the conversations that you were listening to?
 
CHERNOFF: Right. Well -- and Martha Stewart did claim that this was entirely unfair that she was being prosecuted because of her fame. Reminds us a little bit of what may be happening now with the former president.
 
SIDNER: Yes.
 
CHERNOFF: But aside from that, Martha Stewart was charged for lying to the Feds, not for the insider trading. She could have admitted to her crime to trading on illegal inside information -- illegally trading.
 
SIDNER: Right.
 
CHERNOFF: OK. So, she decided not to do that. And as a result. Because she had that hubris, because she couldn't admit she had to be perfect in the public eye, she had to be perfect in her own mind. So, as a result, she then was charged and eventually went to prison.
 <br>[11:55:17]
 
SIDNER: She served I think, what is it, five months or so in prison?
 
CHERNOFF: She did.
 
SIDNER: she made friends with those folks in prison and then she made friends with Snoop Dogg which has its part of her rise. She has become cool if you will. Before, it was about perfection. Now, it's about being cool. She's really remade herself.
 
CHERNOFF: Right. She has remade herself. She's got a rap sheet right? She's a bad girl now, right? WHICH is perfect for the Instagram age, right?
 
SIDNER: Yes.
 
CHERNOFF: Martha Stewart is all about that. Snapping selfies and all that. So, she's famous because of you know, everything she's been through. But it's an amazing story of many lies.
 
SIDNER: It is an amazing story. And I can't wait to watch it. It is going to air in a series starting Sunday at 9:00 p.m. Thank you so much, Allan Chernoff.
 
CHERNOFF: My pleasure.
 
SIDNER: It's really good to see you.
 
BOLDUAN: And thank you all so much for joining us here today. This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL. "INSIDE POLITICS" is up next.
