SARA SIDNER, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  He's then seen firing an AR- 15 style weapon at that worker and others. Five people were killed and several others injured, including an officer who is, at this hour, in critical condition. We're waiting to hear from the police chief and other officials at a press conference that's scheduled in about an hour, and we will, of course, bring that to you live as it happens. Kate.
 
KATE BOLDUAN, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  Now, to the battle over abortion access happening in this country, illegal fight that is widely expected to end up at the Supreme Court. This Friday, a key abortion pill may be taken off shelves nationwide, that is if an appeals court does not side with an emergency request just filed by the Justice Department. Joining us now for more on this is Skye Perryman, she is president and CEO of Democracy Forward. She's also legal counsel for GenBioPro, the manufacturer of generic mifepristone in the United States.
 
Skye, thank you so much for being here. You represent one of only two American manufacturers of this medication at the center of this legal battle, mifepristone. The other company, we have learned, Danco, is joining the Biden administrations in requesting this stay, the stay of this ruling out of Texas. Is GenBioPro going to do the same?
 
SKYE PERRYMAN, PRESIDENT AND CEO, DEMOCRACY FORWARD:  GenBioPro has been in touch with regulators and is unwavering in our commitment to continue to lawfully make the product available. It is exploring all of its regulatory and legal options at this time and has been in touch with FDA.
 
BOLDUAN:  GenBioPro is name checked in this judge's ruling. The Texas judge saying in legal terms, but essentially saying that the generic form of mifepristone should not have been approved if the original should not have been approved in in his view. So, what are the legal options for GenBioPro at this point?
 
PERRYMAN:  Yes. I mean, the main thing to remember here is that this order has no basis in law or in fact. Congress has clearly set forth a regulatory structure for the FDA and what very far extreme interest are doing in Texas in this court battle is seeking to undermine that authority. Yesterday, you saw over, I think, you know, hundreds of CEOs of companies speak out about the real threat that this presents. There are a number of tools that the legal and regulatory process provides, companies like GenBioPro.
 
Congress has been very clear that the authority to regulate medication is vested in the Food and Drug Administration and not in, sort of, external interest groups or others that are seeking to undermine that process. And so, the company is carefully considering all of its options. It is reviewing the orders as well as the regulatory structure in touch with the regulators, and we will be keeping you updated as it continues to map out a strategy here.
 
BOLDUAN:  Understandable. I guess -- I mean, whatever the next move is, it is going to be a very significant one, not only for, you know -- 
 
PERRYMAN:  Yes.
 
BOLDUAN:  -- access to this medication. But for this company, in general, if this Texas ruling holds and mifepristone is taken -- is essentially taken off the market, would GenBioPro be put out of business?
 
PERRYMAN:  I think the main thing to remember is that today the medication is accessible and available. The law -- the court's order has no basis in law or, in fact, the Department of Justice has said, the president has said that, the secretary of Health and Human Services has said that. I believe that there are a range of legal and regulatory tools that both companies and the federal government have, and everyone is united in their commitment to keep this product accessible and available.
 
That is, of course, what GenBioPro is all about. This is a company that's spent nearly a decade developing a generic version of mifepristone, the only in the United State, so that people could access the medication regardless of where they lived or their income level or their background. That the company continues to be committed to that. It will use the legal process and regulatory processes as it needs to.
 
And it has been encouraging to see the strong responses that we've seen across the board from the industry, the government, other companies as well as patients and providers. Speaking up about the importance of access and the importance of our overall FDA regulatory authority in this country.
 
BOLDUAN:  What I was just trying to get at is just kind of the impact not -- on the company with what this would mean. Because Danco, the other company that makes mifepristone has said that it is warned when it joined the suit -- the appeal with the Justice Department that it may be unable to continue operating if this injunction remains in effect. But regardless, there has been some suggestion from Democrats, even some Republicans, at the Biden administration should direct the FDA to ignore the Texas judge's order if it takes -- if it holds. Do you think they should do that? PERRYMAN:  Well, what you see in those suggestions is just how high the stakes are. But I believe that there are a range of legal and regulatory tools that can be lawfully followed, regardless of court orders.
 <br>[10:35:00]
 
That can be lawfully followed, in addition to whatever the court's order in order to preserve access to the medication. That is what GenBioPro is exploring. I, you know, I know that that's what the government has also said, it is exploring and other companies.
 
And that's what you see really, so many people coming out in this time. This is bigger than one product. This is about external, very far extreme interests seeking to undermine the way drug regulation is done in this country, the way our overall democracy functions. And so, I think that there are a range of tools, both with the courts and with the regulatory and legal systems that can preserve access to the product. And I think you're going to see everyone using the range of tools that they can use.
 
BOLDUAN:  I might have to wait and see what that means in terms of the legal steps for GenBioPro. Skye Perryman, thank you for coming on. John.
 
PERRYMAN:  Thank you.
 
JOHN BERMAN, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  So, new this morning, a grand jury in Virginia has indicted the mother of the six-year-old who shot his first-grade teacher in January. Prosecutors say, this comes after a, "Thorough investigation." CNN's Brian Todd is with us now.
 
Brian, what is in this indictment?
 
BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, John, this is a really significant turn in this case, not only with these new start -- new charges filed. This is also the first time we're learning the identity of this boy's mother. Deja Taylor is her name. She has just been indicted, charged with felony child neglect and with recklessly leaving a loaded firearm so as to endanger a child, and that is a misdemeanor. Her attorney, James Ellenson, corresponded with me last night over e-mail, he did not comment specifically on these charges, but he did say that Deja Taylor will be turning herself in later this week.
 
Now, last month, the Commonwealth's attorney told us that Taylor's six-year-old son, the one who shot teacher Abby Zwerner, in that first-grade classroom, will not be charged in this case. Deja Taylor's lawyer previously had told CNN that the boy's parents claim they kept their gun at their home secured, that the gun was secured with the safety and kept on the top shelf of the mother's bedroom closet, John. So, that is where we stand this morning with the charges filed against Deja Taylor, the mother.
 
BERMAN:  Brian, Abigail Zwerner, the teacher, is she responding to the indictment at all? TODD:  She is. Her lawyer, Diane Toscano, issued a statement to CNN last night upon hearing of the charges and statement reads as follows, "There were failures in accountability at multiple levels that led to Abby being shot and almost killed. Our lawsuit makes clear that we believe the school division violated state law and we are pursuing this in civil court. We will not allow school leaders to escape accountability for their role in this tragedy."
 
And, John, we have been also pressing the Commonwealth's attorney on whether school administrators might face some charges. The Commonwealth's attorney, Howard Gwynn, has not commented on that.
 
BERMAN:  I know you've been digging on this story for some time. Brian Todd, great to have you here on "CNN News Central". Appreciate it. Sara.
 
SIDNER:  We got a bit of new information just in to CNN. Chicago will host the 2024 Democratic National Convention. The convention will be held from august 19th to 22nd. Chicago beat out the other two finalists, which were Atlanta and right here in New York.
 
All right. China's navy appears to have simulated strikes by aircraft carrier-based warplanes on Taiwan for the first time. CNN's exclusive conversation with the Taiwanese foreign minister, that's ahead.
 
Plus, the U.S. government has officially declared "Wall Street Journal" reporter Evan Gershkovich as being wrongfully detained in Russia. It is an important move, what that means for the status of his case.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:40:00]
 
SIDNER:  Now, we want to get you the story from around the world. The U.S. has officially declared that an American reporter is being wrongfully detained by Russia. That should provide more leverage and trying to free "Wall Street Journal" reporter Evan Gershkovich. He was detained in march and formally charged with spying last Friday. Just a short time ago, President Biden called the attention totally illegal.
 
The United States and the Philippines are holding their largest joint military exercise ever. More than 17,000 troops from both countries are taking part, according to the U.S Embassy. That is a huge increase from field training, including live fire drills, which will be conducted across the country.
 
And to a blinding sandstorm that is hitting Beijing in Northern China for the fourth time in just a month. Springtime sandstorms are common there. Smog and rapid deforestation, however, have made conditions worse. John.
 
BERMAN:  That is remarkable video, I have to say.
 
The Chinese military now says it is ready to fight after days of simulated military exercises concerning Taiwan. The large-scale combat drills were in response to the Taiwanese president's trip to the United States and Central America last week. Jim Sciutto, CNN's Chief National Security Correspondent and co-anchor of "CNN News" Central South, premiering next Monday, joins me now,
 
Jim, more importantly, for the present, you spoke exclusively to the Taiwanese foreign minister. What did you hear?
 
JIM SCIUTTO, CNN ANCHOR AND CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: That's right. Listen, the headline here is that the Taiwanese are very concerned about these most recent exercises. They look at the scale of them. They look at the number of planes, ships involved here.
 <br>[10:45:00]
 
And they see more than just message sending, they see preparations, testing Chinese military capabilities, and readiness for an invasion of Taiwan. Here's what he had to say.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SCIUTTO:  Is Beijing, in your view, threatening Taiwan with war.
 
JAUSHIEH JOSEPH WU, TAIWANESE FOREIGN MINISTER:  Yes, indeed. Look at their military exercises and also their rhetoric, they seems to be trying to get ready to launch a war against Taiwan. But if we look at the U.N. Charter, the most fundamental T net (ph) in resolving international dispute should be through peaceful means. And Beijing's way of handling the differences between Taiwan and China is through coercion, military threat, and the threat to use force against Taiwan. And these are unacceptable and therefore the Taiwanese government look at the Chinese military threat as something that cannot be accepted and we condemned it.
 
SCIUTTO:  Does Taiwan have, today, what it needs to defend itself?
 
WU:  Yes, we do. We have been procuring military arsenals from the United States for a long time. And when President Biden was in office all these years, they have announced nine batches (ph) of arms sale to Taiwan. And we have also been increasing our military training so that we are ready at any moment if China wants to launch a war against Taiwan.
 
And I think in a war situation, the determination is probably more important than the military equipment. And on that note, I would say that Taiwan is absolutely determined to fight for our own freedom and to fight for our sovereignty. And we are ready to defend ourselves, but hopefully China will not resort to the use of force because war means devastation for a lot of people not only here in Taiwan, but also in other places.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SCIUTTO:  Of course, these exercises followed the visit to the U.S. of the Taiwanese president, including meetings with the House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. I asked the Taiwanese foreign minister whether they regretted that visit, perhaps at the costs were too high, and they said, absolutely not. They said that China cannot dictate who Taiwan meets with.
 
BERMAN:  Jim, it is great to hear from you. I have to say you've been writing and reporting and in your books for a long time. There are plenty of people who are looking at the standoff between China and Taiwan in terms of when, at this point -- 
 
SCIUTTO:  Yes.
 
BERMAN:  -- and no longer if. So, this is really important stuff. Great to see you.
 
SCIUTTO:  Absolutely.
 
BERMAN:  And we look forward to Monday, the big debut of "CNN News, the D.C. Edition". Take care my friend.
 
SCIUTTO:  I'll see you next week.
 
BERMAN:  All right, Kate.
 
BOLDUAN:  Good stuff.
 
All right. This just in to CNN, the Democrats, they're making a big return to Chicago. What we're learning about the plans for the 2024 Democratic Convention that Chicago will host.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:50:00]
 
SIDNER:  All right. Some new information for you, Chicago has been picked to host the 2024 Democratic National Convention. It will be held from August 19th through the 22nd. Chicago beat out the other two finalists, which were Atlanta and New York. CNN's Arlette Saenz is at the White House for us with more.
 
Arlette, how did they come to this decision? But last time this happened in Chicago it was a pretty rocky ride.
 
ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Sara, President Biden ultimately deciding to go with Chicago for that 2024 Democratic National Convention. After a long search process, the Democratic National Committee says that Chicago is emblematic of the values of the Midwest. The Midwest and states like Michigan and Wisconsin, of course, have been critical to President Biden as he made his way to the White House in 2020.
 
Now, one -- some sources have said that part of what gave Chicago the edge was the Illinois Governor, JB Pritzker, his pledge to help fund this convention through fundraising and his own wealth. States -- cities like Atlanta and New York had also been in the mix for this convention. But additionally, we also know that officials in both Wisconsin and Michigan critical battleground states have supported Chicago hosting this convention.
 
Republicans will be hosting theirs just across the state line in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in July of 2024. Milwaukee, of course, was where President Biden was supposed to hold the convention back in 2020 before the coronavirus pandemic hit. He ultimately had to hold -- host that convention in his home state of Delaware.
 
Now, this is one of the big pieces that people have been wondering out -- about as President Biden prepares for a likely campaign. Just yesterday, he said that he is planning to run again in 2024, but that he's not quite ready to make that announcement yet. So, there are still pieces that needed to come together. The convention being one of them. People are still waiting to hear where that campaign headquarters will be, who the campaign manager will be as well. But President Biden, so far, has signaled that he does in plan to run. It might just be a matter of if, not when.
 
SIDNER:  All right. Arlette Saenz there for us -- 
 
SAENZ:  Or when not if, I should say.
 
SIDNER:  So, when -- when, not if. We understood you.
 
SAENZ:  Yes.
 
SIDNER:  We got it.
 
SAENZ:  Yes.
 
SIDNER:  Thank you so much, live there from the White House. Kate.
 
BOLDUAN:  Right now, President Biden is on a plane headed to Northern Ireland to mark the anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement. A live report from Belfast is coming up.
 <br>[10:55:00]
 
Plus, we are standing by for an update on the Louisville mass shooting, that's coming up in just about 30 minutes from now. We're going to listen into that. We're going to bring that to you. As also, we get new data about just how many Americans have been personally impacted by gun violence.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BOLDUAN:  At this hour, authorities in Kentucky are getting ready to release new information about the mass shooting that killed five people.
