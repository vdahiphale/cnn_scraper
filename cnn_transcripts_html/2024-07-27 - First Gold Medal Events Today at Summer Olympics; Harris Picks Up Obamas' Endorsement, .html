MAX FOSTER, CNN LONDON CORRESPONDENT:  Hello and welcome to our viewers in the United States and all around the world. I'm Max Foster. Ahead on CNN NEWSROOM, the first gold medal events of the Olympic Games happen today. Even with rain in the forecast, we will break down the competitions ahead. 
 
Donald Trump lashes out at his potential new opponent, Kamala Harris. But parts of his speech at a conservative event fell flat to his audience. 
 
Plus, Harris is hitting the campaign trail and trying to drum up support with new ads and endorsements. Where she stands in the latest polls less than a month from the Democratic National Convention.
 
(MUSIC PLAYING)
 
FOSTER:  Well, the 2024 Summer Olympic Games are now underway in Paris, with the first gold medals to be awarded today in mixed team shooting and women's synchronized diving as well.
 
The games opened on Friday with a spectacular show that was breathtaking in size and uniquely French. It was the first opening ceremony in Olympic history to take place outside a stadium. 
 
Festivities were centered around famous landmarks and the River Seine, where teams rode in a flotilla of boats.

FOSTER (voice-over):  Canada's Celine Dion really topping the show with a famous French love song. She was one of several world-famous performers along with Lady Gaga and French star Aya Nakamura. 
 
The director of the ceremonies says the giant outdoor production was a change from traditional Olympics but with the same spirit. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
THIERRY REBOUL, CEREMONIES DIRECTOR, PARIS 2024:  We just did this morning the same thing that we have done for years, which means to adapt, to adapt a lot of things, to adapt (INAUDIBLE) dangerous for -- from artists, from roof, for example. And we had to do these kind of things. 
 
But without losing, I think, the concept, is increasing the spirit and without losing any ambition. This is what we are trained to do since day one. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER:  CNN "WORLD SPORT"'s Amanda Davies joins us now, live from Paris. 
 
Did he achieve it? 
 
You were there, you saw it. 
 
AMANDA DAVIES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes. 
 
I have to say every time I watch those clips from Celine Dion, I do get emotional. It was an incredibly powerful moment. It had been long anticipated. All the rumors had been flying around. 
 
But I think it was it was the moment, not just felt what it meant for this Olympic Games, I suppose, as described as one writer off, as like Lionel Messi stepping up in the dying seconds to save the show. 
 
That's perhaps a little bit harsh but it was one of those like Messi magical moments. It was also what it meant to Celine Dion. Given everything she's been through, her first performance for four years as she's battled that stiff person syndrome. 
 
She said there were periods where she just dreamed of simply seeing the Eiffel Tower again but she didn't just see it, she performed on it and actually smashed it. And every Olympic opening ceremony just needs those one or two iconic moments that will be remembered, will be the images for years to come.
 
David Beckham, bringing the torch down the River Thames in London, or the queen flying out of a helicopter or Gisele doing the catwalk in Rio. For me, last night, it was Celine Dion and the hot air balloon, the lighting of the cauldron, which is one of the most spectacular Olympic cauldrons we've ever seen. 
 
But it had everything you would've expected on a scale unlike we have ever seen before. 
 
Will it become the norm for these Olympic opening ceremonies?
 
I don't know. It certainly showcased this city, even despite the rain and the weather. It certainly gave poncho manufacturers a great nights of business. But the athletes, we were a bit worried about some of them. It was a long time for them on the river in the pouring rain. 
 
But certainly by looking at their social media this morning, they've certainly really, really enjoyed the moment. They enjoyed the fact that there were some sporting legends as part of it. 
 
The likes of Zinedine Zidane, the French footballing legend; then, of course, Rafa Nadal and Serena Williams, both looking resplendent in red here, in a city that has meant so much to their careers. But now, after all the ceremony, the pomp, the excitement, this is now the moment where we very much hand the baton. 
 <br>[05:05:00]
 
The torch over to the athletes for them to create their moments of this games. 
 
FOSTER:  So what are you watching today?
 
I gather there could be a gold this hour. 
 
DAVIES:  Yes, absolutely. 
 
The opening medals are set to be awarded in shooting in the next hour or so. I have to say, we've already had, sadly, a postponement of the schedule of the men's skateboarding due to take place today and tomorrow. That's actually been postponed because of the weather. 
 
Although the good news is it does seem to be getting a little bit brighter. But that's been postponed until Monday. But in terms of the big names and the big medals that people are looking forward to, a lot of eyes on the Stade de France, where France hoping for their first Olympic medal with Antoine Dupont, the rugby sevens team. 
 
They do have to get through their semifinal first against South Africa. And then in the other semifinal, it's Fiji against Australia. Fiji, the two-time defending champions in this event. Australia, arguably the team that have been informed. 
 
It promises to be an incredible night in the pool. It is being billed as the race of champions, three of the biggest names in women's swimming at the moment, three world record holders going head-to-head in the women's 400 meters freestyle. 
 
Katie Ledecky, seven time Olympic gold medal winner, who was beaten in this event in Tokyo three years ago by Ariane Titmus. She, though, has been exchanging world records in this event with 17-year-old Summer McIntosh over the last couple of years. 
 
This is a real moment we will see the three of them go head to head. Also, an emotional, you expect, return for U.S. swimmer Caeleb Dressel. He's had a really tough couple of years since Tokyo, talking about the pressure he was putting himself under.
 
But he's expected to be back with the men's hundred meter freestyle in the relay tonight. And then of course, we've got Simone Biles as well, making her much anticipated return to the Olympic Games tomorrow. So honestly, this is where the action really starts. As you know, Max,
 
 once it gets going at these games, we really don't -- can't stop and catch our breath. It's nonstop and it promises to be a brilliant couple of weeks.
 
FOSTER:  I'm exhausted already.
 
We'll see what you're like at the end of the two weeks, Amanda. Thank you so much for joining us from Paris. 
 
Donald Trump -- sorry -- met with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday for the first time since he left the White House. The Republican presidential nominee claimed that rival Kamala Harris had been disrespectful to Israel. 
 
Netanyahu said he hopes Harris' comments about civilian casualties in Gaza won't  harmed ceasefire negotiations. Later in the day, Trump targeted Harris before a crowd of conservative Christian activists. 
 
He claimed, amongst other things, that she doesn't like Israel. CNN's Kristen Holmes has more from West Palm Beach, Florida. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Former President Donald Trump speaking to a crowd of conservative Christians, (INAUDIBLE) to his attacks on Kamala Harris, a very different Donald Trump than the last couple of days, trying to home in on his messaging when it comes to Harris (ph).
 
We had seen him trying out various lines but this speech had more direct attacks, not just on her record as vice president but also as a record as a senator, as a record in California. 
 
Now of course, it was still a Donald Trump speech though it went here, there; there was a lot of riffing. However, it was clear that they're trying to complete this mission of defining Kamala Harris in this race. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TRUMP:  She was a bum three weeks ago. She was a bum, a failed vice president and a failed administration.  With millions of people crossing and she was the border czar, now they're trying to say she never was the border czar. 
 
She had nothing to do with the border. She was the border czar.
 
We have a new candidate to defeat the most incompetent, unpopular and far-left vice president in American history. That's what she is, the most incompetent but certainly the most far left.
 
They were explaining to me, you can say Kamala, you could say Kamala. I said, don't worry about it, doesn't matter what I say. I couldn't care less if I mispronounced it or not, I couldn't care less. 
 
Some people think I mispronounce it on purpose but actually, I've heard it said about seven different ways. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HOLMES:  Now one other notable moment tonight came as he was talking about abortion. Again, this was a Christian conservative group. He started talking about exceptions when it came to abortion in terms of mother's health, incest and rape. 
 
There was a section of the room that began booing what he was saying. 
 
Trump himself didn't react to the booing but he did start talking about the fact that you have to believe, you have to follow what your heart believed but that you also have to win elections, something we have heard him say before -- Kristen Holmes, CNN, West Palm Beach, Florida. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
FOSTER:  Kamala Harris has been looking to prove herself to the public in the early days of a presidential campaign. 
 <br>[05:10:04]
 
And now she scored her biggest endorsement yet from former president Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MICHELLE OBAMA, FORMER FIRST LADY:  I can't have this phone call without saying to my girl, Kamala, I am proud of you. 
 
This is going to be historic. 
 
BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We called to say Michelle and I couldn't be prouder to endorse you and to do everything we can to get you through this election and into the Oval Office. 
 
KAMALA HARRIS (D), VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Oh, my goodness. Michelle, Barack, this means so much to me.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER:  Well, the vice president thanking the Obamas for their support and expressed gratitude for their long friendship as well.
 
Now according to fresh polls, Kamala Harris is erasing Donald Trump's lead in the presidential race. A FOX News poll shows a statistical dead heat in the three battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. 
 
And Harris leads Trump by six percentage points in Minnesota. A new poll for "The Wall Street Journal" indicates there's no clear leader nationwide among registered voters. Trump is polling at 49 percent with the vice president at 47 percent, an improvement from Biden's numbers. In their last poll from early July, Mr. Biden trailed Trump by six
 
 percentage points. The margin of error just over 3 percent. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
FOSTER:  We're joined now by Leslie Vinjamuri. She's director of the U.S. and America's Programme at Chatham House. 
 
I mean, we are, if we look at Trump's speech last night, getting a sense of his plan of attack with Kamala. It seems this idea that she's a far left candidate and incompetent. 
 
LESLIE VINJAMURI, CHATHAM HOUSE:  Exactly but this is, you know, Trump and J.D. Vance, that ticket was, as we know, chosen before they realized that Kamala Harris  would be that -- would be the lead presidential candidate on the Democratic side. 
 
And so we're seeing them rapidly adjust and needing to adjust with it. It's sort of a series of blunders, not least by Vance. 
 
But it does seem like it will be -- the memory of that assassination attack, really very short time ago, when we all thought that there might be a moment of a transformed discourse, a unity a led by president Trump, just simply hasn't come to pass. 
 
And we reverted very rapidly back into attacks on the other candidates and trying to frame Harris as being incompetent, making fun of her. 
 
But on the part of J.D. Vance taking some swipes at women, which are not smart and will be very interesting to see how Donald Trump reacts to that. But this is a very short time. It hasn't even been a full week. 
 
The fact that the gap has closed between Harris and Trump. But she is polling, if you look at one poll of 18- to 34 year olds, it was 60 percent Harris and 40 percent Trump. So clearly she is going for young voters. She is setting out a slightly different position on Palestine and Israel and really pushing hard on reproductive rights and women. 
 
So I think those will be some of the things that she will forefront in her -- in her campaign.
 
FOSTER:  You're a very respected academic. We're wondering if you can figure out what Trump meant here from this sound bite last night. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TRUMP:  You won't have to anymore. Four more years. 
 
You know what?
 
It'll be fixed, it'll be fine, you won't have to vote anymore, my beautiful Christians. I love you, Christians. You got to get out and vote. In four years, you don't have to vote again. We'll have it fixed so good you're not going to have to vote. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER:  Over to you.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
VINJAMURI:  Well, I mean, look, everybody on Twitter has been playing that, replaying that; Democrats, academics saying this is what he wants to do. 
 
He wants to shut down democracy. 
 
What is the phrase, one vote, one man, one time? 
 
But I think Donald Trump is well known for playing to his audience. He sort of is willing to forget the fact that the world is also watching his words. He was speaking to Christians. It certainly sounds like a precedent that is a presidential candidate, that's, that is determined to shut down the Democratic process. 
 
But it could mean he speaks in code. It could mean I'm going to solve all the problems and shut down debate on the issues that you care about and therefore voting will be less consequential. 
 
We all know that the contrast between these two candidates, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, is vast on domestic issues, on a number of foreign policy issues. And so the stakes are high. The contrast is high. And both candidates are going to be really using this message to drive passion and enthusiasm amongst their voters. 
 <br>[05:15:00]
 
Donald Trump is willing to even use language that suggests that he's willing to subvert the democratic process and put an end to it. But maybe he's saying something different. Maybe he was speaking to older voters. It is obviously very disturbing in light of the events of January 6, his role in that. 
 
But again, he's speaking to his base. These are not voters that are going to switch who they're voting for because they're afraid of any risk to democracy. It's just about enthusing them, injecting passion and ensuring that they get out and vote. 
 
And to a certain extent, amongst base voters, we will see that on both sides of that. I don't think you're going to see Kamala Harris willing to say that she'd shut down a presidential election process in the United States. 
 
FOSTER:  No. I mean, one thing she has been pulled up on is her comments after meeting Benjamin Netanyahu, it was seen as a departure, at least in tone from Biden's policy. 
 
Netanyahu and Trump, when they were together, were pretty pointed about that, weren't they?
 
I mean, what did you make of what she said and the different approach she may take to the Middle East? VINJAMURI:  She's certainly taking a different approach. She made it
 
 very clear. She recognized on multiple points the suffering of Palestinians, the images that are being seen. 
 
She also recognized the profound distress to families and the community, having hostages held by Hamas.
 
But she is a presidential candidate soon to be with a nomination that is not going to portray this as a one-sided conflict and is really pushing hard on the need for a ceasefire to get the hostages home and to end the suffering of Palestinians. 
 
And remember, she was sent during -- just before October 7th on a tour of university campuses, again, intended to really inspire young voters. We know that young voters have a different perspective on Israel and Palestine, that there's been a lot of division over this war, even amongst those who support a state of Israel. 
 
They don't support the policies of Netanyahu. A lot of Netanyahu's people don't support his policies. So she really is moving to a position that is reflective of many people in the United States and around the world. 
 
That's still a shift and an important one in the context of U.S. elected officials. And she will get -- and we've seen this -- she will get heat from that in the political classes. But again, when it comes to voters, I think that she's tapping into some very important sentiments and feelings. 
 
Especially amongst young voters and those Arab American voters in Michigan that we talked about. So there are a lot of constituencies. She's really, Kamala Harris, trying to expand the base of voters who feel committed to and passionate and feel like they're policies, their values are represented. 
 
And their age and their diversity are represented in the Democratic Party. 
 
FOSTER:  OK. 
 
Leslie Vinjamuri, Thank you so much as ever for joining us. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
FOSTER:  Train services have been partially restored to France. Travel was disrupted by coordinated attacks just hours before the Olympic opening ceremony. A security expert is in Paris and joins us after the break. 
 
Plus voters in Venezuela prepare to go to the polls tomorrow in what could be the country's most significant election in 11 years.

 <br>[05:20:00]
 
(MUSIC PLAYING) 
 
FOSTER:  Some of France's high-speed train services have been restored hours after what officials say were coordinated sabotage attacks to disrupt several rail lines before the opening ceremony. 
 
Two trains carrying Olympic athletes were affected. The Paris prosecutor's office is investigating but so far, no one's claimed responsibility for the attacks. A rail union leader told CNN that a railway worker or industrial espionage might be to blame. Juliette Kayyem, CNN's senior national security analyst, is in Paris for us. 
 
Thank you so much for joining us. I mean, there was concern that it might have been an outside actor. 
 
It does look increasingly like it's some sort of domestic protests, doesn't it?
 
JULIETTE KAYYEM, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST:  That's exactly right. First of all, a lot of domestic groups have been threatening to try to sabotage essentially the opening ceremonies or basically make a statement as regards lots of visitors that are -- that were watching last night. 
 
And so this was successful in the sense that it got a lot of attention and it didn't harm anyone. I mean, the one silver lining around this is, of course, it was -- whoever planned it could, if they were a nefarious actor, could have caused a lot of harm and injury, if not death to people. 
 
This was clearly planned as something to disrupt and undermine France, the government or the Olympics. And therefore, you would look to domestic sources, whether it's left-wing or right-wing or industrial sabotage against, say, the rail system. 
 
So that's what they'll be looking at in terms of the investigation rather than a foreign threat, like say the Russians.
 
FOSTER:  And so in about a opening ceremony outside a stadium, because it wasn't contained, everyone else will be talking about Celine Dion and the rain today. But I should probably be talking about the remarkable security feat that the French pulled off there. 
 
KAYYEM:  It was incredible. I've been involved for a variety of reasons in understanding what the security posture looked like. This is my fifth Olympics in terms of safety and security. I had never seen anything like it. 
 
And when I first heard what the French were planning on doing, for someone in my space, you get a little bit nervous. It was, from the beginning, from closing down various zones and near the Seine a week ago, to the QR coding, to the closing of the bridges, vehicular traffic. 
 
There were some little dustups in terms of delays and other things like that. But I got in. 
 <br>[05:25:00]
 
I was there for most of the evening. The rain was not fun but the event really was. And I think that the French security forces, with the help of a couple dozen other countries, were incredible in terms of minimizing essentially the harm that they could have come in minimizing the threat. 
 
There was -- I had a briefing this morning. There is a huge sigh of relief. It's not that the Olympics are over. There's going to be continuing threats, whether they're cyber or whatever else. 
 
But the silt zone, that was the Seine zone, the closed zone, and the opening ceremonies were what everyone was focused on. All of those restrictions are now lifted and Paris feels a little bit more normal today. 
 
FOSTER:  I guess the thing now is not to let their guard down, though, because --
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
KAYYEM:  That's exactly --
 
FOSTER:  -- they may be these outside actors, they might not want to attack the games but they'd certainly like to disrupt it. 
 
KAYYEM:  That's exactly right. 
 
So that's going to be the challenge, is how do you keep up this sort of battle rhythm for the next two weeks?
 
And then remember there's a delay. And then you have the Paralympics, which are wildly popular. 
 
So the next two weeks, the goal is to sort of keep the security footprint on, make sure that everything is fine in terms of what Paris is anticipating and then look at the threats like the cyber threat and then other state actors that might be wanting to come in. 
 
I know, just knowing Olympic security history, look, these attacks or these nefarious actors tend to come in weekend two. People think that they can get let their guard down. So we got so, so Paris officials will have to keep their focus on both outside and domestic threats for the next 14 days. 
 
FOSTER:  Juliette in Paris. 
 
Thank you so much for bringing us your insight on that angle. 
 
And we have a winner. The first gold medal of the 2024 Paris Olympic Games has been awarded to China. The Chinese team in the mixed 10- meter air rifle competition came out on top in the first medal round of these games. The teams of South Korea, silver, and Kazakhstan picked up bronze. These are the first results of many more to come. There are a total of
 
 329 medal events scheduled during the 16 days of competition. 
 
The Western United States is experiencing multiple wildfires with significant destruction of property and displacement of people. Details when we return.

FOSTER:  The Israeli military has issued an evacuation order to people in southern Khan Yunis in Gaza. 
 
The IDF warns it would quote forcefully operate in that area and told residents to head to al-Mawasi. However, the designated humanitarian area in al-Mawasi has come under repeated Israeli attacks, including a strike on July 14th, which reportedly killed 90 people and injured 300 more. 
 
Israel says the order to evacuate come after what it calls significant terrorist activity and rocket fire coming from the area. 
 
High level talks for a ceasefire in Gaza and hostage release deal are expected to resume in Rome in the coming days. A diplomat familiar with the plans tells CNN that U.S. CIA director Bill Burns and Israeli intelligence officials are set to meet with Egyptian and Qatari mediators. Those talks could happen as soon as this weekend. 
 
Though the situation is fluid and nothing is nailed down, families of hostages expressed optimism that a deal is within reach after meeting with the Israeli prime minister and U.S. president this week. 
 
Now the White House, along with much of the world, is closely monitoring Venezuela too as it braces for what could be its most consequential election in more than a decade. 
 
On Sunday, millions will vote to either reelect authoritarian president Nicolas Maduro or choose his opponent Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia. He's a former diplomat. He's built a strong following after the opposition's two preferred candidates were barred from running. 
 
International observers were invited by the country's national electoral council to visit its facilities and a polling station ahead of Sunday's election, despite Maduro's promised to the White House for free and fair elections in exchange for sanctions relief. 
 
The strongman suggests there could be bloodshed if he's not reelected. 
 
Wildfires have also scorched more than 3,000 square kilometers and counting in Bolivia.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER (voice-over):  This drone video shows a huge plume of smoke coming from grasslands consumed by flames. At least 25 fires have been burning near the city of Santa Cruz, where a state of emergency has been declared but no fatalities have been reported so far. 
 
Officials say no communities are directly at risk. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
FOSTER:  A wildfire in Canada's Jasper National Park in the Rocky Mountains continues to burn out of control. But rain and cooler conditions aren't giving hope to firefighters that they'll be able to get a better handle on it. The fire has destroyed around a third of the 1,100 buildings in the town of Jasper, a major tourist destination. 
 
But critical infrastructure has also been spared. We can tell you a total of about 25,000 residents and visitors were forced to evacuate the area. Officials say rebuilding could take years. 
 
A wildfire north of Sacramento, California has exploded in size and is still growing. The Park fire has now burned nearly 310,000 acres. That's 480 square miles and roughly the size of the city of Los Angeles. At least 134 structures have been destroyed, thousands of people are under evacuation orders. 
 
More than 2,400 personnel are working to contain the fire but at last report, at least, just a few moments ago, it is 0 percent contained. CNN's Camila Bernal is there. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
CAMILA BERNAL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Triple-digit temperatures and dry terrain fueling the quick spread of these flames. So much so that this fire was spreading at about 50 football fields per minute, destroying so much in its path, including about 100 structures, like what you see here behind me. 
 
It's hard to even tell what's here aside from some of the burned cars. And unfortunately, authorities say that this was likely caused by a 42-year-old man, who they say was witnessed a pushing a burning car down about 60 feet into an embankment. 
 
This man has been arrested and authorities say that there are witnesses who saw him doing this. Unfortunately, he did it at a park. 
 <br>[05:35:00]
 
And this local park only has one way in, one way out. Firefighters telling me it was very hard to get to those flames and so that only helped the spread of these flames. 
 
They are working around the clock, about 1,500 firefighters currently working this fire. And they say some of them are working 48 hours straight. They're calling this fire challenging and say they are prepared for a very difficult fire season. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CAPT. DAN COLLINS, CAL FIRE:  It is concerning that we're having these larger fires earlier in the season. Based on my experience, for having big fires like this in July and August, we may have bigger fires come the fall as the fuels get drier and the winds start to pick up. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BERNAL:  And these conditions affecting a large portion of the Western U.S. The largest fire currently burning is in eastern Oregon. And authorities there say they have made some containment progress. But there is still a lot of work to be done. At least two homes were destroyed there and at least a dozen more structures. 
 
It is not easy to come back to a property that looks like what you see here behind me and it's especially not easy for the people here in Butte County. They already experienced the deadliest wildfire in California history in 2018. 
 
And some of these people are having to relive this again, with evacuation orders and with having to deal with all of this, happening to the community again. So it has not been easy for the people of this county -- Camila Bernal, CNN, Butte County, California. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE) 
 
FOSTER:  Well, there are multiple fires burning throughout California in the Western U.S. The region has been experiencing extreme temperatures, dry conditions and erratic winds, making the fire, the threat from far at least, even worse. 
 
CAL FIRE battalion chief Josh Silveira joined me to explain the challenges facing the people who live there and the men and women battling the flames. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOSH SILVEIRA, BATTALION CHIEF, CAL FIRE:  We've been lucky the last couple of years in California. 
 
We've had below average fire years over the last couple of years. Though we have gotten substantial rain, which has added to the grass crop up and down the state and those grasses that grow seasonally are what we refer to as light flashing fuels. 
 
And that's what's attributing to the widespread wildfire that we're seeing up and down the state. 
 
FOSTER:  You haven't got it contained at this point. 
 
When do you hope to be in more control of it?
 
SILVEIRA:  We're hoping that, as we see the weather change in our favor, where we get a cooler, more moist conditions, we can start to turn the corner and gain some ground on this fire and start working on containment. 
 
FOSTER:  How many people are affected by this?
 
The images we're looking at, at the moment, thankfully, look at what as though there away from homes. 
 
SILVEIRA:  It's currently burning in two separate counties. It's burning in Butte County and in Tehama County. The fire has grown substantially since yesterday. We're currently sitting just over 307,000 acres. 
 
On top of the Park fire, we are currently engaged in 12 other major incidents up and down the state and it's proving to be a very busy fire year for us. 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
SILVEIRA:  It's affecting countless people. 
 
FOSTER:  How are the crews coping with it? 
 
You've got enough? 
 
SILVEIRA:  The crews are doing good. CAL FIRE  statewide is up to our peak staffing level for fire season. 
 
Even with our peak staffing level, we have to reach out to our cooperators, both locally and nationally. We have assistance from other states. 
 
Currently municipal departments and other states here in California assisting with these wildfires as well as our partners from local government agencies in California and the federal government with the U.S. Forest Service and our partners from the Bureau of Land Management as well.
 
FOSTER:  If you don't get the weather you need, it's a worrying situation, isn't it?
 
Because it is traveling so quickly.
 
SILVEIRA:  It is. It's a very rapidly moving fire. It's being fanned by seasonably high winds, very steep, rugged terrain which make access very difficult. Getting crews in to engage right on the fire's edges is being -- proving more difficult than anticipated, especially when you have such a fast moving fire. 
 
Trying to get down into some of these very mountainous areas and fight fire effectively makes it very difficult when it's moving this rapidly.

FOSTER (voice-over):  These are scenes from northeastern China, where they saw heavy flooding from the most powerful storm to hit the country this year. The remnants of Gaemi threatened to bring heavy rain to other parts of China too. 
 
In Taiwan, where the storm injured more than 700 people and killed seven, rescue attempts are underway after a freighter sank off the island's coast on Thursday. Four crew members were rescued. One was found dead and four remain missing. Crew members on eight other freighters are stranded and awaiting rescue. 
 
Still to come, we're learning more about the arrest of a major Mexican cartel boss and how El Chapo's son helped reel him in

FOSTER:  U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris has spoken with the family of Sonya Massey, a Black woman killed by police in her own home. That was announced hours after officials released an autopsy report on Friday, which showed she died from a gunshot to her head. 
 
Officers came to Massey's home in Springfield, Illinois, earlier this month after she called them to report a possible prowler. The deputy who shot her now faces a first-degree murder and other charges. 
 
But Massey's family wants an investigation into how he was hired in the first place. Whitney Wild explains.

WHITNEY WILD, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  There is a lot more to learn as this case unfolds. But CNN is digging into the background of the accused deputy here, Sean Grayson. And what we've learned is that he was employed at six different law enforcement agencies between August of 2020 and July 2024. 
 
We've also learned that, while he was working for one of those agencies, the Logan County Sheriff's Office, he was accused of inmate intimidation. That incident occurring in January of 2023. 
 
We've also learned that Grayson was cited for failing to stop a high- speed chase after a supervisor directed him to do so. That was also while he was working for the Logan County Sheriff's Office. that incident occurring in September of 2022. 
 <br>[05:45:00]
 
We have also learned, according to a CNN affiliate, that he was discharged from the Army for misconduct, although the details of any alleged misconduct are not yet clear. We reached out to Grayson's attorney, who declined to comment on that
 
 question. Then further, we have learned that he was charged twice for driving under the influence, once in 2015 and once in 2016 and he pleaded guilty to both of those charges. 
 
There are, again, many questions about the timeline here leading up to his employment at the Sangamon County Sheriff's Office. He has since been fired from that job but the Massey family is asking for much more accountability, a deeper dive into how he was hired and why he was hired in the first place. 
 
Meanwhile, they are speaking out about how this trauma has upended their lives.

SHADIA MASSEY, SONYA'S COUSIN:  Sonya meant the world to me. I loved her so much. This tragedy has been too much on our family. Her kids, her daughter cannot sleep at night, y'all. She's in one household; I'm in another household. 
 
For her to go to the bathroom, she has to be on FaceTime with me. For her to get a drink of water, she has to call us before she get out of her bed. Now, this is the hardest thing that we have ever been through as a Massey. It just breaks my heart that our family has to go through this.

FOSTER:  The FBI is now confirming that former U.S. president Donald Trump was hit by a bullet at a Pennsylvania rally two weeks ago. 
 
It's the most direct statement yet from the federal law enforcement on Trump's injury, saying, quote, "What struck former president Trump in the ear was a bullet, whether whole or fragmented into smaller pieces, fired from the deceased subject's rifle." 
 
It comes after Trump pushed back on some officials, who questioned whether he had been hit by a bullet at all. Some of that confusion was fueled by FBI director Christopher Wray's testimony to Congress earlier this week. 
 
Trump announced Friday that he'll return to Butler, Pennsylvania, where he was shot, for a, quote, "big and beautiful rally." 
 
One of Mexico's most notorious drug lords is now in U.S. custody, thanks to the help of El Chapo's son. CNN's Polo Sandoval explains.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
POLO SANDOVAL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, as we learn more about this takedown, it seems that betrayal is really one of the prevailing themes in this investigation. Oftentimes the heads of these drug cartels have to decide between fleeing from authorities and potentially getting hunted down by them. 
 
Or do they choose to cooperate with them?
 
And thus far, based on information coming in, it seems that this may have been the latter. According to a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation, telling our colleague, Evan Perez, it is believed that one of the sons of Joaquin Guzman, who we know as El Chapo, likely provided U.S. authorities with critical information. 
 
That allowed them to nab this narco, Ismael Zambada (ph), known as El Mayo. Remember Mayo and Chapo Guzman were two of the partners who created the Sinaloa cartel decades ago. 
 
The DOJ yet to confirm the following plot but we have heard from multiple sources briefed on the investigation who say that it's likely that Mayo was led to believe that he would be flying to go see a property, potentially to purchase it, and not head to an airstrip near El Paso, where federal agents were waiting to actually detain him. 
 
So essentially, it is believed at this point, though the DOJ has not confirmed it, that he was hand-delivered by the son of his former partner, by Joaquin Guzman Lopez, who is the 38-year-old man who was also aboard that plane, also behind bars in federal custody and also stands accused of taking part of this massive criminal enterprise. 
 
Responsible for quite literally tons of narcotics that have ended up in the United States, specifically fentanyl. As for El Mayo, he was in court at the end of this week and entered a plea of not guilty. 
 
Now in terms of what could be to come, the Sinaloa cartel certainly not going anywhere even though one of its leaders is now in federal custody. 
 
What we do know is that over the years that group has actually splintered into other factions. So the arrest of El Mayo certainly leaves behind a massive power void, a vacuum, so to speak. And it's very possible that we could see some infight, some infighting within the Sinaloa cartel. 
 
So yes, this arrest of now a second founding member of the Sinaloa cartel could be the end of one era. But this may likely lead to the bloody start of another -- Polo Sandoval, CNN, New York.

FOSTER:  Paris kicked off its Olympic -- Summer Olympic Games with a spectacular opening ceremony. Of course, last night, tens of thousands of athletes floated down the River Seine on boats amid famous singers, colorful dancers and a jaw dropping light show at the Eiffel Tower. 
 
Athletic competition is now in full swing with medals expected to be handed out in several sports. One, already in the shooting. Fiji take on Australia and South Africa will face France in the semifinals in rugby sevens. The gold medal matches take place later in the day. 
 
There'll be several heats in men's and women's swimming. Most notably, American Katie Ledecky will swim in the 400 meter freestyle in her fourth Olympics. She's hoping to go on to win her eighth Olympic gold medal. 
 
In men's basketball, team France faces Brazil and Greece will battle Canada. Meanwhile, the men's street skateboarding event has been postponed until Monday due to the rain. 
 
CNN sat down with Team USA skateboarder Jagger Eaton, who took home a bronze medal at the Tokyo games. He opened up about his return to the games and what drives him to compete against the best in the world.

JAGGER EATON, TEAM USA SKATEBOARDER (voice-over):  I started having dreams competing against the best in the world, I think, right when I made the X games, like right when I was 11. 
 
It was so surreal and it wasn't about beating any of my idol, like that wasn't what it was about. It was about being in that same environment as them. I'm sitting there like, as a little kid, being like, I just want to draw. Like I just want to go, you know what I mean. 
 
And when I saw that and I was on the same stage with them, at the time, I never knew if I was going to be able to compete with them. But I knew that's exactly where I want to be. 
 
Winning that bronze changed my life, changed my life forever. That confidence, getting that medal and performing under that pressure, you know, it's something you carry with you. And, knowing I can overcome that, knowing I can push that adversity under immense pressure is what every athlete wants to know. 
 
I did take some time after Tokyo just because, you know, after one of those events, your are kind of just exhausted mentally, physically. But every time I take time off the board, I always realize just how much I love it. 
 
Changes in my life since Tokyo has just been getting more disciplined, mentally and physically, controlling my environment much more. Also just managing my distractions. No, I'm not doing social media anymore. I'm kind of out of the loop on a lot of main topics. 
 
But it's just controlling my sanity. I never was really a big drinker but I don't drink. I don't smoke. I'm not around people who have nasty habits. I really just try to stay around people who I find very inspiring and people who I find motivating. 
 
I'm really engulfed in (ph) my friendships, really just building on relationships. It's not necessarily what I don't do, it's what I try to do, what I want to be, you know what I mean? 
 
The friend that I want to be, the family I want to be, I think that's a big part of it.
