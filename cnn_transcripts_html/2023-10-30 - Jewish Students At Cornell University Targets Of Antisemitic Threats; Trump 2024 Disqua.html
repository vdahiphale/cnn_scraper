RABBI ARI WEISS, CEO, CORNELL HILLEL: Israel was attacked on October 7th. Over 1,000 people were murdered. Over 200 people were taken hostage. Any other country would respond defensively. It is a just war. And we are open to having that conversation and to hearing other opinions as well. But I think it's important to have that moral clarity to say that what happened that -- what Israel is doing currently is a just war and it is a defensive war. 
 
Our core work is just -- is also just to support students. Students are having many different types of feelings. We want to process with them. We have rabbis on our staff. We have educators on our staff. And we're there at Hillel to support Jewish students right now. Over the last three weeks, we've come together several times. Over 1,000 people cumulatively to hold a vigil for Jewish students and to hold a rally to demand that the hostages come home. 
 
BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: Certainly, something that we all echo as we look at the situation with hostages in Gaza and we're watching as well, what's happening is Cornell -- at Cornell. So many ugly things have occurred there in the last few weeks. And Rabbi and Molly, we appreciate you joining us to talk about it. Thank you. 
 
WEISS: Thank you. 
 
MOLLY GOLDSTEIN, CO-PRESIDENT, CORNELL CENTER FOR JEWISH LIVING: Thank you. 
 
KEILAR: And we'll be right back.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN HOST: A trial is underway in Colorado at this hour to determine if the 14th amendments insurrectionist ban disqualifies Donald Trump from appearing on that state's 2024 presidential ballot. A group of Republican and unaffiliated voters in Colorado filed the historic and some say long shot court case last month. Now it's going to be up to a judge to figure out Trump's ballot fate in a case that could have major implications for other states where similar challenges have been filed. 
 
Let's bring in CNN's Marshall Cohen, who's been following the latest details. Marshall both sides making their opening arguments today, walk us through them. 
 
MARSHALL COHEN, CNN REPORTER: Boris, as you mentioned, this is historic. It has never happened before in American history that one of the leading candidates for President has to defend his qualifications like this in court. Donald Trump, of course, they are trying to take him off the ballot because of January 6th. That's what's on the table here at this case in Colorado. So, you're looking at some pictures from that courtroom. There is a camera in there, and right now is some witness testimony. 
 
But earlier today, opening statements from both sides. I'll play a clip for you from the challengers. The Group of Republican and independent voters that are trying to get Trump off the ballot. Their argument was essentially that this in the 14th Amendment, this is the law of the land we need to uphold the law and maintain a fair election. Listen to what they had to say. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ERIC OLSON, ATTORNEY FOR COLORADO VOTERS WHO WANT TRUMP BLOCKED FROM BALLOT: Our constitution prevents people who betrayed their solemn oath, as Trump did here, from serving in office again. Trump engaged in insurrection and therefore cannot appear on the ballot. No person, not even the former president, is above the law. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
COHEN: Look, he's right to a certain extent. This is what the constitution says. They was ratified after the Civil War. Anyone who engaged in an insurrection can't hold office. Of course, the big question is, how do you enforce something so old? Something that's barely been used in the last 100 years? And also, doesn't that possibly take the voters out of the equation, Boris? Isn't this supposed to be an election? That's what Trump's lawyers were arguing in their opening statement. I'll play their clip for you now. This is Scott Gessler. He was the Secretary of State in Colorado. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SCOTT GESSLER, TRUMP ATTORNEY: And this court should not interfere with that fundamental value, that rule of democracy. It's the people who get to decide. And this lawsuit seeks to cancel that principle.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
COHEN: So it's -- it could not be further apart for us, those two sides. It will be up to the judge to figure out the path forward. There are so many constitutional questions that she is going to grapple with. There are many, many hurdles between now and actually removing Trump from a ballot. And no matter what this judge says. Most people think that it will probably be appealed all the way to the Supreme Court -- Boris. SANCHEZ: Marshall Cohen, thanks so much for the update. 
 
Still plenty more news to come. In fact, we're going to take you back to Maine. The States governor just wrapped a press conference moments ago on the investigation into a mass shooting in Lewiston there. A lot of questions to be answered. We'll be right back with a live update. 
 <br>[15:40:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
KEILAR: Maine Governor Janet Mills just finished giving an update on the response to the mass shooting in Lewiston over the weekend. We have CNN Shimon Prokupecz, who is in Maine. This was pretty notable. A lot of frustration in the room during this press conference -- Shimon. 
 
SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, certainly because there are still so many questions that need to be answered. And really what we're dealing with now is the month, the weeks leading up to this and what was going on with the shooter. We know from our new reporting that law enforcement was aware that he was having some kind of a mental difficulty. That there was potentially threats of a mass shooting, of violence. We've learned in the last few days that actually a sheriff's deputy went to the home of the shooter to do an investigation because someone in the military called them and said we're concerned about this. 
 
But what we don't know is what happens after that? What steps are taken to try and locate the shooter? And then now we know what happened. And these are the questions that we just posed to the governor. 
 <br>[15:45:02]
 
What does she know and what was her reaction to all that? Take a listen to her response. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Information that was -- that was received by local police that they that they had about the shooter, that they did not share with federal --
 
PROKUPECZ: Governor, you really don't know what we're talking about. Is that what you're going to stand here and tell us? Governor, everyone here has -- wants to know that answer. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This needs to be answered. 
 
PROKUPECZ: Yes, governor, I'm sorry --
 
MILLS: It's under investigation.
 
PROKUPECZ: It is, but these are -- 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Is there something to tell us? PROKUPECZ: No, but this is something you should be able to --
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (INAUDIBLE)
 
PROKUPECZ: -- but also that we know that there is an alarming concern from the law enforcement community that activity and information here was ignored and the simple answer is why was that done? And are you concerned about that? 
 
MILLS: (INAUDIBLE). You're making assumptions. I'm not willing to make assumptions.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE) 
 
PROKUPECZ (on camera): And so there you go. Right. You have the governor there. She really wasn't willing to answer any of the questions concerning the investigation. Her concerns over the fact that maybe law enforcement here missed items of information that could have prevented this from happening. 
 
I know from talking to law enforcement officials here in Maine and outside of Maine that are aware of this, that there is so much concern over the fact that there was enough evidence here, they believe, enough information to warrant further investigation, perhaps more action by the local police department and it just wasn't taken. And we just want the governor's reaction to it. 
 
Look, she is the governor of this state. She's in -- for all purposes, she's in charge of this investigation. She runs the state police. They report to her. So all we simply want to know is what does she know? And you know, really this is about getting some answers, right, for this community, for people who have been affected by this. But also law enforcement wants to know. 
 
Folks that are not living here outside of here, they want to know what steps were missed. Where were the mistakes made and if there were no mistakes then that's fine. But someone needs to talk about it. And this has been something that they've not wanted to answer for days now. 
 
You know, the day after this incident, there were questions about this, about the law enforcement contact with the shooter. They basically ignored those questions. And now as we see from the governor, all the way to the top of this state, continuing to ignore the questions and refusing to answer the them. 
 
KEILAR: Yes, this didn't come out of nowhere and I think that was really what we heard you and a number of reporters, including local reporters there in Maine, demanding of the Governor. Shimon, thank you so much for that. Shimon Prokupecz live for us from Augusta. We'll be right back.
 <br>[15:50:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) KEILAR: In the House of Representatives, the new speaker, Mike
 
 Johnson, he is beginning his first full week on the job and he wants a stand-alone aid package for Israel's war against Hamas. And that puts him at odds with Democrats also with some Republicans, some key Republicans who are requesting that funding as well go to Ukraine go through. 
 
SANCHEZ:  Yes, he's trying to pair aid with Israel with certain cuts, specifically to legislation that was passed by President Biden. So let's take you now live to Capitol Hill with CNN's Manu Raju. Manu as Speaker Johnson's plan would tie up a showdown with the Democratic controlled Senate. What are members of Congress saying about this? 
 
MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, two huge developments this afternoon in the push that tried to get this Israel aid package moving. The new speaker, Mike Johnson, just revealed text that the Republicans plan to pursue a built tax that includes $14.3 billion in aid to Ukraine. But notable -- the aid to Israel does not have aid to Ukraine as part of this package. But notably it includes spending cuts to offset the cost of the price tag. What it would do is cut spending for the IRS. Spending that was authorized through the Democrats Inflation Reduction Act, a law the Republicans opposed. But it would cut $14.3 billion in spending from the IRS in order to pay for the package. 
 
That is a no go for Democrats. In fact, I just talked to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on his way back from the White House. He told me that obviously a pay for like that makes it much harder to pass. He was referring to that spending cut that the Republicans are pushing. Also, he said we believe our Democratic caucus, we should be doing it all together -- Israel, Ukraine, the South Pacific. That tees up a huge fight. Remember, the White House had asked for $105 billion in aid to Ukraine, Israel, the South Pacific, to deal with the problems at the border. 
 
The new speaker wants to focus just on Israel and also to include those spending cuts that are going to be a huge issue for Democrats. So where does that leave everything? Unclear. Can Congress pass an aid package for Israel at this critical time? Can it do so for Ukraine? Also, lots of doubt about whether that could pass the Republican House. So even as Johnson is making Israel's first priority, can it become law? A major question is whether he pursues this approach. And the Senate Majority Leader telling me moments ago that approach won't fly in the United States Senate. 
 
KEILAR: And Speaker Johnson, Manu, is also preparing for a little housekeeping. This week we're expecting to see a trio of resolutions to expel Congressman George Santos. Also, censure Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib and Marjorie Taylor Green. Can you tell us the latest on these things? 
 
RAJU: Yes, we expect that vote to happen either Wednesday or Thursday. The significant vote is the expulsion of George Santos. There's only five times in the history of the country has members of the House been expelled. 
 <br>[15:55:00]
 
George Santos, if it would occur, would be the six. It would require 2/3 majority in the House to get there. It's being pushed by a group of freshmen New York Republicans. We expect Democrats to support it. But what will Republicans do? So it's uncertain it will reach that threshold. 
 
Those central resolutions separate issues, more of a symbolic slap on the on the wrist to reprimand members of Congress being pushed against Rashida Talib, Marjorie Taylor Green. Those measures also uncertain that they will pass the House as they faced opposition from both parties. So a lot to watch out for and from landmines for Mike Johnson to navigate as he says, he wants to focus on policy, not these central issues. 
 
SANCHEZ: Yes, thanks so much Manu, for that reporting. Important to point out, as Manu did, this is introduced by Republicans from New York, his own fellow Congressman. 
 
KEILAR: Yes, that is a very, very good point. All right. Thank you so much for being with us today on this very big news day. "THE LEAD" with Jake Tapper starts after this short break.</pre>
