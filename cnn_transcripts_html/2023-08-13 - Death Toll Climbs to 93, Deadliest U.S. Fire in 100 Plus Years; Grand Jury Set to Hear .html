JOSH GREEN, HAWAII GOVERNOR: We were here just two days ago and the number was smaller, is going to continue to rise. We want to brace people for that.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK: The death toll from the wildfires in Maui rising as we witnessed the scope of the devastation. We'll look at the island -- island needs in the way of aid with a spokesperson from the American Red Cross.
 
Plus, Donald Trump making an appearance at the Iowa State Fair but all eyes are on Georgia as a district attorney there prepares her case for the grand jury.
 
And months after suffering cardiac arrest in the middle of an NFL game, Damar Hamlin is back in action. CNN Sports Coy Wire joins me live on his incredible road to recovery. 
 
ANNOUNCER: Live from CNN Center, this is CNN Newsroom with Laila Harrak. 
 
HARRAK: We begin in Hawaii we're days after wildfires decimated parts of Maui, the death toll is rising yet again. Moments ago authorities confirmed 93 deaths the fire is now the deadliest in the United States in more than a century. And that number is expected to climb even more in the coming days as crews sift through the devastation caused by the fires. Governor Josh Green says the area has suffered some $6 billion in losses, with some 2200 structures damaged or destroyed, the vast majority of them homes.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GREEN: This is the largest natural disaster we've ever experienced. It's going to also be a natural disaster. It's going to take an incredible amount of time to recover from. So in the next few days, as we characterize how many people we've lost, and how many people are coming into our community. Please understand that we come at this like in Oahu because it's going to be in the short-term heartbreaking, in the long-term people are going to need mental health care services, in the very long term we'll rebuild together.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK: The Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency visited Maui Saturday to see the devastation firsthand. She also spoke with many residents affected by the fires and this is what she had to say.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DEANNE CRISWELL, FEMA ADMINISTRATOR: I heard their stories. I heard their harrowing stories of escape, evacuating, then evacuating again, a car that was caught on fire than they got into somebody else's car. Yet what I always find, even during these incredibly tragic times is this resilience of a community to come together and support each other and that's what I saw.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK: People are indeed supporting each other. CNN's Bill Weir is in Maui and got a firsthand look at neighbors helping neighbors.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT: I've covered enough disasters to take the advice of Mr. Rogers, who taught us that when things get really scary, look for the helpers and there is no shortage of helpers in Maui these days. Some now five days after the firestorm. Here we are in a port that's a very bumpy long boat ride away. 
 
That hill in the distance that's west Maui mountain, Lahaina is behind is on the other side of that. And these are improvised boat lifts of just neighbors coming together taking volunteer donated water, fuel, and the essentials. There's a cry for baby supplies, burn medication after the fire storm over there. That's what they're dealing with here in the near term. I talked to one South Maui Commissioner -- county commissioner, who says this sort of overwhelmed by the response in a way that challenges management of this disaster.
 
GRACE HURT, COUNTY COMMISSIONER, SOUTH MAUI: It is a heartbreaking situation and our hearts go out to every single one of the impacted victims here in Lahaina and the Kanaka Maoli. Everyone who is a native Hawaiian here and I knew everyone who has sold their homes here. We respect you, we're here for you. We are partnering with you, we will bring you back, we will rebuild. We will come back stronger than ever before. And I'm just a voice. This is for the people of Maui. This is for the local citizens that lost their homes, lost their family members and have even lost their lives. So we're out here, who's on the ground really trying to make a true difference and we appreciate all the support and help we can get
 <br>[05:05:06]
 
WEIR: But at the same time you have people gathering together and doing their part burning off the anxiety that came from this to try to help in a tangible way right now. It's any best when they open up the highway to let people freely go back and forth. That's been a source of frustration between local officials and residents right now. And there is the ever-present question of how high the body count will eventually go. Bill Weir, CNN in Maui.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HARRAK: Joining us now live from Honolulu, Hawaii is Evan Peterson, the spokesperson for the American Red Cross. Thank you so much for joining us. I understand the Red Cross is on the ground in Hawaii. Can you describe how your teams are helping those affected by this disaster?
 
EVAN PETERSON, NATIONAL SPOKESPERSON, AMERICAN RED CROSS: Yes, so the American Red Cross has been years since even before the disaster started. We have an office here. And when we saw what was going on and saw how quickly this fire was spreading across the area, we immediately started communicating with officials and trying to figure out, OK, what do we know what the ask, the need is going to be. And what we found is that people really need a place to stay. Not only were there people who were impacted by this fire in terms of like the local residents that live on Maui, but also tourists people that were coming in from out of town and who lost their hotel. So we've been providing place for shelter, we've been providing a place for people to grieve in process, and start figuring out what those next steps can look like for them.
 
HARRAK: Now, as you've just outlined, the Red Cross disaster workers have opened shelters on Maui in Hawaii, I understand to accommodate those displaced? Is that sufficient?
 
PETERSON: Right now, again, we are staying in contact with local officials about kind of what is needed. Right now we are finding that our sheltering capacity is appropriate for this need. Sometimes people can, you know, may have lost a place to stay, for instance, but instead of going to a shelter will end up staying with family or friends on other islands. So for right now, we find that we are currently meeting the need but we are prepared to change and adapt as needed.
 
HARRAK: Right, exactly. Because as I understand this is still very much an evolving situation. Do you expect more people to turn to you for help?
 
PETERSON: I don't know if I am in a position to say whether we expect more people to turn for us to help but we -- we are going to be there whether people do or not. Again, we were on this island even before this incident happened. We've been here through the entire process. I mean, even since the -- since the incident started, we have sheltered for overnight stays. Nearly 3000 people and even during the day when the need for these shelters grows exponentially. We're seeing people coming in and out, you know getting food, getting water, charging their phones, if they're able to make a call to try and connect with a loved one. So whatever the need is that people have, we're going to be there and we're going to support them through this.
 
HARRAK: And it's aid coming through, are you able to reach even those that have been isolated by these fires?
 
PETERSON: Isolation is tough, as you've been hearing from your reports, no doubt that we are still trying to deal with kind of the infrastructure of this problem. I mean, this fire destroyed roads, it destroyed cell phone towers, it destroyed lines of communication. So we are doing our best to work within those confines. But we are so fortunate to be working with a very resilient group of people who are wanting us to succeed and trying to reach out to our neighbors. So again, the challenges are there. But we are resilient. And we are finding ways with local government officials, with our community partners, and of course, the people to solve these problems.
 
HARRAK: And for those who are still looking for their loved ones, what is your advice to them?
 
PETERSON: Right now we are working to unify people, again, with communication being down. I for instance, I spoke with someone just the other day about how they and heard from a cousin of theirs who they disappeared running from the fire. Fortunately that they just earlier today they did hear back from them and found out that they had been in the same town that they were in this whole time but because of lack of communications, lack of cell phone towers, things like that. They just weren't able to hear from them. 
 
So we are currently working with the local government and emergency officials to start a reunification process. This is currently taking place, anyone who is interested in trying to track down a loved one please call 1-800-RED-CROSS. That's 1-800-733-2767 and there will be automated prompts here that can help you walk you through that process.
 <br>[05:10:18]
 
HARRAK: 1-800-RED CROSS, American Red Cross Spokesperson Evan Peterson, thank you so much for your time. 
 
PETERSON: Thank you. 
 
HARRAK: Now, if you would like information on how to help those impacted by the Hawaii wildfires, do please go to cnn.com/impact or text Hawaii to 707070 to donate. 
 
Wind gusts in Maui are expected to stay in the 30 to 40 mile an hour range today in the continental U.S. heat indices could be over 115 degrees. Heat watches are in effect for the Pacific Northwest records could be broken in Portland, Oregon. Over the next few days and severe storms with damaging wind, hail and isolated tornadoes are likely across the southern and central plains storms are already brewing near Tulsa and Omaha. Perhaps most troubling a new tropical cyclone expected to develop and move south of Hawaii. The new system is not expected to be as strong as Dora.
 
Donald Trump, the leading Republican presidential candidate could face a fourth indictment as early as this week. An Atlanta prosecutor has called on at least two people to testify before a grand jury on Tuesday over efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn election results in Georgia. CNN's Marshall Cohen has details.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MARSHALL COHEN, CNN REPORTER: It looks like all systems are go for the Fulton County district attorney to present her case to a grand jury early this week in her investigation of former President Donald Trump and his attempts to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia. 
 
CNN previously reported that this was expected in the coming days. But we now know that some of the witnesses who were subpoenaed to testify were told specifically to show up on Tuesday. And that means that the proceedings may begin Monday going into Tuesday. One of those witnesses is an independent journalist named George Chiti, who witnessed some of the fake pro-Trump electors meeting at the State House in Atlanta in December 2020. Another key figure who will head to the grand jury on Tuesday is former Georgia Lieutenant Governor Geoff Duncan. Here's what he told our colleague, Fredricka Whitfield on Saturday.
 
GEOFF DUNCAN, FORMER GEORGIA LT. GOV.: I did just receive notification to appear on Tuesday morning at the Fulton County grand jury and I certainly will be there to do my part in recounting facts. I have no expectations as to the questions and I'll certainly answer whatever questions put in front of me and certainly don't want to go any deeper than that to, you know, jeopardize or compromise the investigation. But look, for me this is a story that is important for Republicans to hear Americans. To hear, let's hear the whole truth and nothing but the truth about Donald Trump's actions in the surrounding cast of characters around him.
 
COHEN: Duncan, who is now a CNN contributor is a Republican, and he was in office when Trump tried to pressure Georgia State officials to flip the results and overturn the will of the voters. 
 
Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis and elected Democrat launched the criminal investigation in 2021. The probe has steadily expanded over time, she is scrutinizing Trump's attempts to interfere with the vote counting and the election certification. She is also looking at the fake electoral scheme, as well as efforts by Trump supporters to breach an election system in rural coffee County. 
 
State prosecutors are expected to give that one- or two-day presentation to the grand jury this week. CNN has previously reported that Fani Willis is eyeing conspiracy and racketeering charges known as RICO and is expected to pursue indictments against perhaps more than a dozen defendants. 
 
Trump has already been indicted federally on charges stemming from his attempts to subvert the 2020 election and disenfranchise voters. He pleaded not guilty and he has claimed that the probe in Atlanta is just another witch hunt. Marshall Cohen, CNN, Washington.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK: Joining me now is CNN Senior Political Analyst Ron Brownstein. He's also Senior Editor at The Atlantic run up to now the ex- President's reaction to the number of indictments has been, you know, one of defiance challenging at times. Will this approach be effective in the Georgia case?
 <br>[05:15:00]
 
RON BROWNSTEIN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: In the Republican context almost certainly it will be, you know, Donald Trump has succeeded in convincing not that they took a lot of convincing, I think. The majority of Republican voters to see all of these indictments through his frame, which is that they are going after me, but they're really trying to silence you. And I am just in the way and this is weaponization of the federal government, and so forth. 
 
It is a very different question whether ultimately, if he is the Republican nominee, the broader electorate will view that in the same manner, there are some warning signs on the dashboard for Republicans, but in terms of how this is playing out in the Republican primary, at least so far, he's been able to convince voters to see it the way he wants them to.
 
HARRAK: And Ron, how does the Georgia investigation compare to the other cases?
 
BROWNSTEIN: It may be the most sprawling of all of them, you know, I mean, in the sense that the Georgia prosecutor has been by all indications has been investigating this as an effect a racketeering case, which is another way of saying a broad conspiracy, in which there are many players. And it is possible that unlike the federal Special Counsel who chose not to indict at this point, anyone except Donald Trump to streamline that case, this may be a very expansive and sweeping indictment that, you know, brings together not only figures from Trump's national orbit, but from the state and it is a reminder, state legislators who are involved in the -- for example, fake elector scheme. It is reminder that those kinds of cases are also proceeding. There's another one in Michigan, there's a -- there's a case under investigation in Arizona. So this may be the broadest set of -- it covers only Georgia that doesn't cover -- I don't know, no one's going to think it's going to cover the same ground nationally as Jack Smith, but it may have the broadest cast of characters.
 
HARRAK: Now, Donald Trump is not the only one with the Special Counsel concerns, a special counsel has also been appointed in the investigation into President Biden's son. The Department of Justice now has three special counsels, how extraordinary is this? And how does this all fit into the upcoming presidential election?
 
BROWNSTEIN: Well, it's reminiscent of the Clinton years when there were multiple independent counsels at that point, which ultimately led to the narrowing of those powers and what we have now of the Special Counsel at the Justice Department. Well, I think, you know, it goes to who Merrick Garland, the Attorney
 
 General is. I mean, I think he -- you know, he bends over backwards to avoid, not that it's really helped him avoid in terms of Republican accusations, but his goal is to avoid the sense of the Justice Department is politicized in any way. So he's probably gone further than he needed to certainly in the Biden classified documents example. 
 
But, look, I think all of this, you know, isn't quite symmetrical yet, at this point. I mean, Donald Trump, the accusations that the Special Counsel Jack Smith is investigating Donald Trump are a far more gravity and magnitude than anything they're looking into by all that we know, with Hunter Biden. You know, Hunter Biden's behavior was unseemly and is by -- the testimony we have, his father probably went too far in allowing him to project that kind of air of influence and insider done to his clients. But there is no indication yet, there's no testimony yet. In fact, there's testimony to the opposite, that Joe Biden in any way, tried to do favors for the clients themselves. 
 
Republicans have failed to produce any evidence of that claim. And even if there was, you know, I'm not sure that rises to the level of trying to overturn the peaceful transfer of power for the first time in American history. So we'll see, you know, how this how this plays out in the end. As I said before, there are warning signs for Republicans in terms of how voters outside of the GOP coalition are viewing the Trump indictments, if he is the nominee, and he is on trial while he's the nominee. It's going to force Americans to grapple with this in a way. I don't think all voters have done so far.
 
HARRAK: Ron Brownstein, thank you so much. 
 
BROWNSTEIN: Sure. 
 
HARRAK: And we'll have more on the Hunter Biden investigation, ahead. What the appointment of a Special Counsel means and the White House reaction ahead on CNN Newsroom. 
 
Plus, Ukraine reportedly gained some ground in its slow-moving counter offensive, and it happened in an area where it's been trying to push ahead for weeks.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[05:23:31]
 
HARRAK: Ukraine is claiming progress in an area where it's been trying to crack Russian defenses for weeks. Kyiv says its forces had partial success near the village of Robotyne in southern Ukraine. Well, this video from a Russian state news agency shows fighting in the area. Other footage posted on social media, which CNN is unable to geolocate appears to show Ukrainian troops entering the village on Friday. 
 
Meanwhile, Russia is lashing out at Ukraine after a reported new missile attack on the Crimea bridge. This video appears to show Russian air defenses at work before three missiles were reportedly shot down on Saturday. The bridge is a lifeline for many Russian military operations, and a major political symbol for President Vladimir Putin. 
 
For more we can now go to Clare Sebastian in London. Clare, good to see you again. What more do we know about the missile attack on the Crimean bridge?
 
CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, good morning Laila. This was according to the Russian Head of Crimea, three missiles launched in two stages. He's saying modified air defense missiles as 200 missiles modified for ground attacks. That's what the Russian Ministry of Defense is saying as well. They were according to Russia shut down no damage, but we don't know really because it seems that some kind of smokescreen was put up to obscure the bridge. Perhaps it's a little unclear what the impact might have been traffic now said to have been restored on the bridge, though. 
 <br>[05:25:05]
 
But obviously as you say this bridge is something that Ukraine has previously claimed responsibility for attacking in two attacks that did cause damage. They're not saying anything about this latest one. But despite what Russia says repeatedly claiming that this is just a piece of purely civilian infrastructure that is not borne out. In reality, we know that it is the only sort of fixed link between Russian mainland territory and occupied Crimea, through which they can resupply forces along the southern front. So this has a clear logistical motive for Ukraine to try to disrupt those logistics, but also symbolic as well, as you say, for Russia, this is a hugely symbolic bridge, President Putin has driven across it, it symbolizes, at least as they see it. There's just legitimacy of their annexation of Crimea and their ongoing war. 
 
Well, of course, for Ukraine, it's a symbol of that ongoing occupation and Russia's ability to keep that war going. So this is what we're seeing on both sides. I think Russia wants to claim that its civilian infrastructure. Ukraine, meanwhile, I think is sending out a message that it is a clear target. Laila?
 
HARRAK: In the meantime, Ukraine reportedly has made gains on the ground, and it's very slow moving a counter offensive? 
 
SEBASTIAN: Yeah, so like, the way to understand what's happening on the frontlines right now is that Ukraine is pushing very hard along two axes on the southern front trying to get to the Azov Sea to cut off Crimea from the rest of Russian occupied territory, Russia, mainly defending trying to hold off Ukraine except for in the far northern part of that frontline in the Kharkiv region, where it's trying to take back territory that it lost some 11 months ago in a previous Ukrainian counter offensive. 
 
So what we're hearing as of Saturday is that around the southern front, the western part of the southern front, Ukraine is making gains around claiming partial success. They say around the village of Robotyne, which is apparently more significant, according to analysts than the amount of territory would suggest because we know that area, the western part of the southern front is one of the most heavily fortified areas where Russia has built up these layers of Defenses, Dragon's Teeth, bunkers, minefields, things like that. So if Ukraine is able to make any progress at all, that may well be the fruits of weeks, days and weeks of work to get to that point. We don't know of course, is how far back those Russian defenses really go and how much more work will need to go into pushing through that direction as they are going to meet that goal of reaching the Azov Sea. Laila?
 
HARRAK: Clare Sebastian in London, thank you for your continued coverage. 
 
Still ahead, pressing the flesh and pressing for votes, candidates including Donald Trump campaign at the Iowa State Fair. 
 
Plus, Ecuador has a new presidential candidate taking the torch of the anti-corruption candidate was murdered on Wednesday.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[05:31:23]
 
HARRAK: Welcome back to our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Laila Harrak and this is CNN Newsroom. 
 
I want to get back to one of our top stories this hour. Former U.S. President Donald Trump could face a fourth indictment as early as this week. A district attorney in Georgia has given the clearest indication yet that she's moving forward with her investigation into efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn election results in her states. She has instructed at least two witnesses to testify Tuesday before a grand jury. One of them is former Georgia Lieutenant Governor Geoff Duncan, who is also a CNN Contributor.
 
While Donald Trump isn't showing any signs of despair at facing a possible fourth indictment, he's on the campaign trail, joining other Republican candidates at the Iowa State Fair. Jeff Zeleny has the details.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: The Iowa State Fair on Saturday was a playground for presidential candidates, including of course former President Donald Trump, who arrived here in Des Moines at the very time it was being learned that the Georgia grand jury will continue their investigation and interviews of witnesses next week, of course, the former president defiance about that role in the Georgia election back in 2020 when he is accused of trying to meddle in that election. 
 
Now, he said he defended that phone call he made to Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, calling it a perfectly fine call as he arrived here at the fair. He also talked about his front runner status in this race. Of course, he is leading the race at the moment, five months before the Iowa caucuses opened the 2024 campaign. But he said he's taking nothing for granted. 
 
DONALD TRUMP, (R) FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: So we'll be back. We have not taken any chances. We're way up in the polls in Iowa and all over the country, over 50 points. That's a lot but we don't want to take any chances. We'll be back. We love you very much. 
 
ZELENY: And Trump only stayed at the fair for just a couple hours. But his rival stayed for far longer, greeting many voters making their case to them why they should be the alternative. Now, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis had his children and family in tow riding the bumper cars, taking some turns, playing games. He also was talking about his leading rival Donald Trump, and about his refusal to sign that debate pledge. 
 
RON DESANTIS, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You don't take your ball and go home. It's not just about you, you got to be willing to stand up and support the team. So I think every candidate should agree to support the nominee, 100%.
 
ZELENY: And Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and former U.N. ambassador in the Trump Administration, also spending considerable time here at the Iowa State Fair, as she has been doing for months holding town meetings across the state. She is calling for a new generation of leaders. And she said it's time for the party to move on. 
 
NIKKI HALEY, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Don't complain about what happens in a general election if you don't play in this caucus. It matters. It mattered. 
 
ZELENY: So it's five months to go before the Iowa caucuses open the 2024 campaign right here. The challenge, of course is on for many of these candidates to make their case to voters. Many will get a chance to do so at that Republican presidential debate now less than two weeks away in Milwaukee. Some of course, will not make the debate stage making it even more challenging for them to appeal to voters. But one thing is clear, talking to so many voters over the last several days here in Iowa, yes, many support Donald Trump. Many are still fans of his but many also are questioning these indictments and simply if he can win a general election. 
 
One thing that's clear, the next phase of this campaign will be an aggressive one. And many candidates have an opening they'll try and walk through. Jeff Zeleny CNN, Des Moines.

HARRAK: Attorney General Merrick Garland has given the U.S. Attorney investigating Hunter Biden Special Counsel status after plea talks between the Justice Department and the president's son fell apart. David Weiss asked Garland for the change in designation, as Hunter Biden appears likely to face trial on tax and gun charges. 
 
The move gives Weiss more investigative powers and puts him at a greater distance from the Department of Justice. Some Republicans say Weiss cannot be trusted, accusing him of giving the president's son special treatment. Hunter Biden's attorney spoke with CNN about to change.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ABBE LOWELL, HUNTER BIDEN'S ATTORNEY: He has made very clear the mistake he made. And that's all he has made a mistake about. And so am I concerned, I am only concerned that a force other than facts or law would influence any additional decision. And if this prosecutor with a new title now continues in doing what he's supposed to do, which is to follow the evidence and follow the law the conclusion should be the same.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK: CNN's Priscilla Alvarez explains how the White House is reacting to the Hunter Biden case.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: The White House's maintaining its no comment strategy after Attorney General Garland announced that the U.S. Attorney leading the Hunter Biden probe would be Special Counsel. Now, that is consistent with the strategy the White House has taken before over various Justice Department actions. And in a statement to CNN White House Spokesperson Ian Sam said the following when asked about the latest announcement saying, "We will refer you to DOJ or to Hunter Biden's personal representatives."
 
Now, the White House did not receive a heads up ahead of the Attorney General announcing that there would be a Hunter Biden special counsel. That too was consistent with other Justice Department actions. But of course, this is a case that the Biden's were hoping to put behind them and close that chapter after that expected plea deal that fell apart. But now they're going to face a continued criticism from Republicans as these legal proceedings unfold. Republicans on Capitol Hill have flirted with a potential impeachment inquiry into Biden when asked about that, the White House has said that that is baseless and a stunt. But it is all to say that the White House continues to face fierce criticism from Republicans over the Hunter Biden probe even in on the heels of this announcement by the Attorney General. The president for his port has not weighed in on this publicly, but previously has said that he and the First Lady Jill Biden love and support their son. Priscilla Alvarez, CNN at the White House.

Plus, later in the show just months after suffering cardiac arrest in the middle of an NFL game, Damar Hamlin is back weighing in the Buffalo Bills first free season game, details ahead, live with CNN Sports Coy Wire.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[05:41:16] HARRAK: Regional leaders appeared to be holding off at least for now on their threat to send troops in Niger to restore the ousted president to power. Reuters reports the Economic Community of West African States is moving towards sending a group to negotiate instead. But the coup leaders have shown no desire to talk so far. While the move comes amid antique French protests in Niger's capital. France is supporting the ousted President Mohamed Bazoum. But some protesters have called for Russia to help drive French troops out of the country.
 
CNN's Jim Bittermann is standing by live outside the French capital. Good morning again, Jim. Still, no letup an anti-French sentiments in Niger. Is Paris at all considering pulling out its troops?
 
JIM BITTERMANN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: I don't think so Laila, they've made it pretty clear from the beginning that they are going to keep them there as long as possible. Their position is that the deal which allowed the French troops to stay in Niger was negotiated with the civilian authorities, a democratic elected president, who of course, is now in captivity, that they are going to recognize that agreement as the one that's operable, and they're going to keep their troops there. 
 
Now, having said that, if the military junta should establish itself as a legitimate government, I think the French government is going to be in a very difficult position, they may have to withdraw the troops. That demonstration that you saw with the other day on Friday was in fact, their -- right in front of the military base for about 1500 French troops. 
 
And I should say as well, there's 1500 troops as well among Americans, American soldiers who are in the northern part of the country. And there the American position is exactly the same reestablish the democratic elected President Mohamed Bazoum, who is being held, we are being told and this has not been confirmed and held in the basement of the presidential palace. He's been denied water, food and essential medical treatment. 
 
There was one report yesterday that he may have been seen by a doctor, but there's been no confirmation of that. He's 63 years old, and he could well become a bargaining chip. And that's because the regime, the junta would know that they -- if they were to release him or to do something that would indicate their willingness to concede some kind of an agreement with the -- you're establishing, re-establishing the precedent, the outside forces might be less severe. 
 
Right now, the sanctions in place they started start to cut off of aid to Nigeria, and as a consequence, they're starting to feel the pinch. So it's a standoff for the moment and I think everybody was looking towards that ECOWAS negotiation to succeed, end it diplomatically, but it hasn't come down to fruition as yet.
 
HARRAK: So they're -- they're at an impasse, do we know if there are any mediation efforts underway to release the ouster of President?
 
BITTERMANN: Well, not really. I mean, there's -- there's the effect of the intentions of the West are well known to the military junta, and there's no real mediation possible because of the junta, up until now has refused to talk to anyone, including ECOWAS in terms of releasing a president or doing other than -- anything other than keeping themselves in power. So no, there's not -- not anything to indicate there's any movement on the ground in any case, and there's going to be apparently, there's been -- we've been told it might be a demonstration this afternoon, in favor of President Bazoum in the streets of the Ami.
 <br>[05:45:03]
 
And if that were to take place perhaps that would show some support to the position of reestablishing the democratic elected president. Laila?
 
HARRAK: Jim Bittermann reporting right outside Paris, thank you so much. 
 
Next to Ecuador, Ecuador's government is sending thousands of military and police officers to take control of a prison zone. It comes days after anti-corruption presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio was shot and killed in the Capitol. CNN's Rafael Romo is Quito with the latest.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: As part of the state of emergency declared by President Guillermo Lasso after the assassination of presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio, security forces raided a prison on Saturday early in the morning, officials said the purpose of the deployment was to establish control over weapons, ammunition and explosives within the prison as part of the operation and the leader of a local drug gang was transferred to another prison. 
 
Also Saturday, the Coalition of Fernando Villavicencio, the murdered candidate, chose a replacement to run in the August 20 election. It will be his running mate, Andrea Gonzalez Nader. In a CNN exclusive, she told us she knew Villavicencio and herself were at great risk but never imagined she would be in this position only a week before the election. She also told me, the international community should realize that drug trafficking and organized crime are not solely Ecuador's problems, and affected countries need to work together to find a solution.
 
ANDREA GONZALEZ NADER, ECUADORIAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You never have enough time to process something so shocking, and so sovereign in us. The assassination of a presidential candidate is such level of violence, and so soon so close to the presidential elections. I think this is a disturbing moment for the whole region and eventually for the world's democracy.
 
ROMO: In another development, the widow Fernando Villavicencio says she blames the state for her husband's murder and demand that answers as to why it happened. Veronica Sarauz made the accusation at a news conference Saturday here in Quito.
 
VERONICA SARAUZ, WIDOW OF FERNANDO VILLAVICENCIO (through translator): They did not protect him as they should have protected him. The state was in charge of Fernando security. The state is directly responsible for the murder of my husband Fernando Villavicencio. The state still has to give many answers about everything that happened. His personal guards did not do their job. I do not want to think that they sold my husband to be murdered in this infamous way. 
 
ROMO: A presidential debate is supposed to happen Sunday night at least two of the seven remaining candidates said the debate and even the election itself the following Sunday, should be delayed but electoral officials say everything will go on as planned. Rafael Romo, CNN Quito, Ecuador.
 
HARRAK: And Still ahead on CNN Newsroom, the Women's World Cup Semifinals are set. CNN Sports Coy Wire joins me next to find out who's left. Here he is.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[05:51:56]
 
HARRAK: Now, to the Women's World Cup where we know the four countries that will contest the Semifinals in Australia and New Zealand and it's all about the co-host Australia and the amazing storyline the Matildas continue to tell. Well, with me now is CNN's sports one and only Coy Wire. So good to have you here Coy. England, Australia, who would have thought?
 
COY WIRE, CNN WORLD SPORT: I know I mean, whatever way this plays out we're going to have a first time World Cup winner that's exciting stuff. And if it's anything like we've seen this tournament so far, those Aussie crowds are going to be so lit when they're Matildas go and play. They set attendance records all throughout the matches in the tournament and now they're on the verge of potentially making the final for the first time ever. It took an epic effort for them to get there especially by their keeper Mackenzie Arnold, their match with France going to penalties after two scoreless hours Arnold was brilliant in Brisbane, denying this shot in Round Four whatever three penalty saves now incredibly, she would have to then go get the call to kick a potential winner but it hits the post. 
 
So now she would have to refocus. This one going back and forth still level after 18 kicks but then heartbreak for France. 19-year-old Vicki Becho hitting the post and giving Australia and opening Cortnee Vine seizing it in her first World Cup ceiling her place in history Australia when seven-six the longest penalty shootout in Women's World Cup history. Fans, check them out back in Sydney loving every moment, as they're Matildas. Now, they're going to be in the semifinals later this week. And here is one of the stars of the show.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MACKENZIE ARNOLD, AUSTRALIA GOALKEEPER: This is why I love Brisbane, Queensland, Grown and I'm so proud to say I'm from this place and the fans have been absolutely unreal. The whole tournament. This feeling is something that I've never felt before and I'm so, so proud of the girls. Honestly, I don't know what to say right now. I'm overwhelmed. Because I need to put that one away under that much pressure. Like I said, I'm just so proud of everyone. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WIRE: Know about that crowd, Laila. My goodness Australia, they're going to face England who had to rally against Colombia after giving up a goal to the South Americans late in the first half Colombian keeper Catalina Perez unable to handle the ball and that allowed Lauren Hemp to take advantage and draw even just before the break. And then just after the hour mark right place, right time, Alessia Russo, putting on the winner off a deflection, the lionesses win 2-1 making their third straight appearance in the semifinals. That'll be on Wednesday. But first it will be Spain and Sweden facing off for a spot in the final on Tuesdays. Games have been incredible.
 
HARRAK: Oh my god, I can't wait. Oh my god. But we're going to head to the United States next where we've seen a remarkable moment play out for a Buffalo Bill safety, Damar Hamlin.
 
WIRE: Yeah.
 
HARRAK: What a comeback.
 
WIRE: Yeah, imagine Damar Hamlin, essentially dying on national TV right when he was hit during a Monday night football game, cardiac arrest on the field while trying to tackle someone. And then imagine the nerves having to go back out there seven months later in his first game back, here he was before the game sharing an embrace with some of the heroes Denny Kellington their trainer who performed CPR to save his life. During the game Hamlin making three tackles in the first quarter alone.
 <br>[05:55:17]
 
Coach Sean McDermott calling it a remarkable display of courage, strength, and faith builds me up because 23-19 afterwards checkout Hamlin, signing his jersey and handing it to his mom. He says, this was another milestone and getting back to feeling right.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DAMAR HAMLIN, BUFFALO BILLS SAFETY: Amazing, you know what I'm saying, just makes me feel like I'm back in my element, back and I'm just back a part of my team. And, you know, I honestly couldn't imagine not being a part of this.
 
When you step in between them learns, you putting yourself at risk by hesitating and reserving yourself, you know what I'm saying? So, you know, I made the choice that I wanted to play, you know, it wasn't nobody else's choices but mine. There's no other place I'd rather be.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WIRE: Doesn't have a great head of hair on him. I envy him. I do not envy what he was feeling. I remember when I had a plate and four screws put in my neck after my six season NFL and then getting back out on the field for the first time imagining that first hit, it was really overwhelming. But here he is. He's powering through and continuing his dream.
 
HARRAK: Well, what a comeback. 
 
WIRE: Yeah.
 
HARRAK: It's been a long road, but still it's great to see you. Coy, it was lovely catching up. Thank you so much for being here.
