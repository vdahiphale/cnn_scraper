THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
<br>[15:30:00] 
 
BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: The mayor of Akron, Ohio, says the sheer number of victims in a weekend shooting there is quote, shocking and deeply concerning. One man was killed and 24 others were shot. Two of the victims are in critical condition. 
 
Investigators are now worried that the violence is not over, that there could be retaliation from this. Shell casings just littered the crime scene in this case. And authorities suspect an assault rifle was among the weapons that were used. Authorities are now offering a $22,500 reward for information that leads to an arrest. 
 
CNN's Polo Sandoval is on this story for us. And Polo, this all started at a birthday party?
 
POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: And Brianna, one of the reasons perhaps why that casualty count is so high, as the mayor put shockingly high, is because there were hundreds of people who were gathering there just southeast of downtown Akron, Ohio, over the weekend to celebrate a birthday party. And that very quickly took a deadly turn with this drive-by shooting. Police believe that there were about 200 people who were gathering outside of that home in Akron when at one point the driver of a vehicle pulls up and at least one gunman aboard that literally sprayed the crowd with bullets.
 
Now, evidence at this point indicating that some members of that group that were in the crowd that was shot at actually managed to return fire before the vehicle then sped away. 
 
But here's the thing. At this point in the investigation, police have not shared any information on a motive. They do not have the description of a suspect or a vehicle. So I want you to listen in on Police Chief Brian Harding as he makes a very public plea for any information, emphasizing that no detail is small enough to share.

CHIEF BRIAN HARDING, AKRON, OHIO POLICE: I want to be clear. We believe there are people in the community this evening who saw something or know something, and we are asking them to come forward. 
 <br>[15:35:00] We believe there were dozens of people at the party at the time of the shooting and potentially over 100 people who may have witnessed the incident. Every single person who may have seen something has an obligation to speak up in order to bring those responsible to justice. Even a small detail can help us crack this case and locate the suspect or suspects involved.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SANDOVAL: You mentioned that reward of over $22,000. Authorities there in Akron, Brianna, are hoping that that will encourage one of the dozens, if not hundreds, of people who were there to step forward and to speak to authorities.
 
KEILAR: I mean, we're talking about this incident, 25 people shot, but this was just one episode in what was really a weekend of violence, Polo.
 
SANDOVAL: Yes, there were multiple incidents. There was another notable one just south of Phoenix, the Gila River Indian Community, a reservation south of Phoenix, and that is where two people were killed, among them a young police officer who was still in the field training stage of his career. His police department identifying and confirming his identity is Joshua Brees, who was among four officers who were responding to a disturbance at a dance happening at a private residence when at one point, and the circumstances are still unclear here, but at one point shots rang out and this officer, along with a second individual, were killed.
 
And these incidents are really just the latest of what were supposed to be joyous events turning into a mass shooting situation. Already this year alone, we have seen these joyous events like family reunions, a sporting rally, religious celebrations, ending with shots fired. The Gun Violence Archive that tracks these situations, these mass shootings, now reporting 194 this year alone, Brianna, and as we've seen, these two examples, not just civilians but members of law enforcement making up the growing list of victims in the U.S. 
 
KEILAR: All right, Polo, thank you so much for that. We do appreciate the report. 
 
And ahead, as inflation is taking a bite out of Americans' budgets, there may be some relief. We'll have that after a quick break.

JESSICA DEAN, CNN HOST: After driving customers away with their crazy expensive prices, fast food chains have a plan to woo everyone back by putting deals back on the menu. 
 
Let's bring in CNN's Nathaniel Meyersohn. Nathaniel, I think a lot of people want to know, so what's the deal?
 
NATHANIEL MEYERSOHN, CNN CONSUMER REPORTER: Yes, Jessica, the fast food deals are finally back. Welcome news. So I went over to KFC earlier today to check out their new deal. It's $4.99, comes with a drumstick, a thigh, and some mashed potatoes, so you're getting a good bang for your buck there. And we've seen other fast food restaurants bring back their deals as well. 
 
Burger King has a $5 value meal. McDonald's also responding with a $5 meal. And then Wendy's has a $3 breakfast meal. So Jessica, once one of these fast food chains comes out with a deal, they all have to follow to face the competition.
 
DEAN: And so why are they doing this, Nathaniel?
 
MEYERSOHN: Well, I think it has a lot to do with customer frustration. We've seen people really fed up with these high fast food prices. And it's not revolutionary, Jessica, what they're doing. Demand is slowing down, and so they're trying to respond. 
 
And then you also see grocers and retailers, they're introducing lower prices. Walmart and Target, they've announced some price cuts. So the fast food restaurants are trying to keep up.
 
DEAN: Yes, and who has the most to gain here?
 
MEYERSOHN: So analysts will tell you it's McDonald's, which is really the industry leader here. And McDonald's, you know, they've been hit on social media for some of the burger prices and Big Mac prices. On TikTok, there was a viral video of an $18 Big Mac meal. So that got a lot of pushback from customers. And McDonald's has even come out and said, hey, guys, we understand our prices have gotten a little bit out of whack. We're trying to push back a little bit here.
 
And so McDonald's, I think that, you know, people are really going to be looking to them to see how this deal is. But certainly McDonald's can't be skimping on its new $5 deal because then customers will be extra frustrated.
 
DEAN: Yes, and they will, I'm sure, take to social media. All right, Nathaniel Meyerson, thanks so much for that update. 
 
A Canadian local goes from casual fan to active participant during a PGA tournament on Sunday. We're going to talk to him about the wild weekend that's next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[15:48:31]
 
DEAN: A Canadian golf fan took a chance and volunteered for the opportunity of a lifetime. And his helpfulness put him in the spotlight.
 
KEILAR: Sure did. Paul Emerson was attending Sunday's final round at the RBC Canadian Open when one of the players suddenly needed a hand after his caddie slipped and fell in the wet conditions and injured himself. Emerson volunteered and carried the player's bag until another caddie arrived. And Paul Emerson is with us now to talk about it. Paul, this is so cool. I mean, how are you thinking about this opportunity you've had?
 
PAUL EMERSON, STEPPED IN TO CADDY AT CANADIAN OPEN: Yes, it just landed on my lap. Almost -- CT was just walking Fluff to the ropes to get medical attention. And I just simply offered, I asked if he needed any help.
 
He said yes. And next thing you know, I'm helping Fluff take off the bib and walking up the fairway. It just all happened very fast.
 
DEAN: It has to be kind of surreal that suddenly you're walking. We're looking at video of you right now walking on the fairway. You're now part of this.
 
Were you able to kind of be in the moment or was it all a blur?
 
EMERSON: Yes, after a few minutes. When I walked up to the green and started shaking hands with, you know, Major Champion Shane Lowry and his very friendly caddie and CT, that all happened really quickly. And then on the next tee after we got up there and had a little bit of a break, I just sort of soaked it up and we actually started joking around. It was all very, very friendly and fun.
 <br>[15:50:00]
 
KEILAR: OK, so we're seeing this video of you. So you carried the bag. I mean, were you lining up his putts? What did you get to do here?
 
EMERSON: That would be a terrible decision on his part to ask me for guidance. I'm a golf nut, but I'm not a great golfer. I love the game, but, no, he did not ask for any help.
 
It was actually the opposite. He asked me not just to stay off of the greens. So my job was fairly clear, just carry the bag and keep his clothes dry. But really, really friendly guy.
 
DEAN: Aw. That's so cool. Did you hear from a lot of people that you knew? Did they see this happening?
 
EMERSON: Yes, absolutely. While it happened, as I was walking down the fairway, my friend Laura, they shouted from the sideline, which was fairly funny. And my watch was buzzing away.
 
And then afterwards, it was pretty wild as well. And since the last few days, it's been hilarious. The amount of outreach, social media, email, phone, you name it, has been really incredible. I can't believe it, to be honest.
 
KEILAR: Paul, do you have any experience caddying?
 
EMERSON: Only a little bit. I volunteered to caddy at the Pro-Am at the CP Women's Open in my hometown a couple of years ago. And I caddied for my buddy Mark at a Pro-Am about 25 years ago, and that's it. So nothing like this. Nothing like, you know, being inside the ropes in a very important tournament that matters a lot for the players. So much different experience.
 
DEAN: Yes, but you met your moment. I mean, you did it. You were able to be helpful and useful and have this experience. When it was all over, how did you guys leave it?
 
EMERSON: Well, it all ended really quickly, to be honest. When the caddy services sent a caddy up to the fifth hole, he just sort of showed up in the middle of the fairway and said that he was sent. And so CP chose someone who knew what they were doing a good call. And we shook hands and, you know, walked off. And Shane Lowery complimented me on a level par career as a caddy.
 
And I walked off the fairway. Someone took a great photo of me waving to my friend as I walked off. And that was it.
 
Until it wasn't. And then, you know, I spent the rest of the day in my far too recognizable T-shirt getting high fives and handshakes from fans all across the course.  So, that's awesome.
 
DEAN: Yes, that was it.
 
EMERSON: It was great.
 
DEAN: What a fun experience. A once in a lifetime.
 
EMERSON: It was a blast. You know, everything since has been fun, too.
 
KEILAR: Yes, it's amazing. Paul, thank you so much for being with us and sharing a little bit. It's just, you're so humble, and it's so great that something like this happened to you, and you can talk to us about it. Thanks again. 
 
DEAN: Thank you.
 
EMERSON: My pleasure. Have a great day.
 
DEAN: You, too. 
 
KEILAR: Cuba's financial crisis is putting a squeeze on the nation's cash flow, forcing shortages at ATMs, and leaving Cubans struggling to get by without any money.
 
DEAN: CNN's Patrick Oppmann spoke to people about that crisis.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In a country of seemingly endless lines, these are perhaps the most frustrating. People waiting to get money, their money, at government- run banks. The lines are long, and there's no guarantee that by the time they get to the front, there will be any cash left.
 
We've been here for an hour, she says, and haven't been able to get inside yet. Sometimes you do the line, and they don't have enough money. 
 
Despite government attempts to move transactions online, cash is still king in Cuba, and there isn't enough of it.
 
OPPMANN: Many banks limit how much cash people can take out, and the largest bill that the government prints is this one, 1,000 pesos. At the official rate, that's about $40, but in the black market, it's only worth about 3. 
 
OPPMANN (voice-over): Runaway inflation has inflicted further pain on the already ailing Cuban economy.
 
Lately, government-run banks no longer allow foreign companies to withdraw dollars or euros either, saying they simply don't have any on hand. The Cuban government blames the crisis on the U.S. government's economic sanctions and murky plots, they allege, to make record inflation and shortages even worse. 
 
But Cuban journalists tracking inflation from abroad say much of the country has lost faith in their banking system and currency.
 
There is no production in Cuba, he says. Production in the country has collapsed. The country is bankrupt.
 
And Cubans like retiree Nancy complain that even when the peso regains some value against the dollar, the prices stay the same or still go up. 
 
I don't earn enough each month, she says. I receive 7,000 pesos, but a packet of milk is almost 3,000 pesos. A carton of eggs, the same price. I'm not getting by at all. 
 <br>[15:55:00]
 
Some economists think Cuba needs to devalue its currency officially or adopt the U.S. dollar. But as the island confronts the worst economic crisis in decades, both money and time may be running out. 
 
Patrick Oppmann, CNN Havana.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
DEAN: Coming up, a photo bomb on the house floor. This one's pretty cute, though, when we come back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
KEILAR: When taking your child to work goes hilariously awry. Tennessee Congressman John Rose got up to speak about last week's conviction of Donald Trump, but there he was. Check out that little man there. He was upstaged by his own son with a photobomb for the ages.
 <br>[16:00:03]
 
DEAN: Yes, he could be seen smiling, making faces. He got that tongue out for a while. The congressman took it all in stride though. He posted on X, this is what I get for telling my son Guy to smile at the camera for his little brother. 
 
KEILAR: Best brother ever.
 
DEAN: Honestly, that's such a good brother and he brought us a lot of joy, so thanks, Guy.
 
KEILAR: Yes, he's delivering for his little bro. I think he should get an award for that. I love it.
