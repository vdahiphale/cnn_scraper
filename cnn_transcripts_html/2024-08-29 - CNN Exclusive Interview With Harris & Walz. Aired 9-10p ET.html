SCOTT JENNINGS, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, FORMER SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO PRES. G.W. BUSH, COLUMNIST, LA TIMES, DAILY MAIL, GANNETT: --to promote its agenda, that is number one.
 
And number two, I'm wondering if she has any comments about when she knew Joe Biden was on a downhill decline, because we didn't find that out until late. But I suspect she may have known it sooner.
 
ASHLEY ALLISON, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, FORMER NATIONAL COALITIONS DIRECTOR FOR BIDEN-HARRIS 2020, FORMER OBAMA WHITE HOUSE STAFF MEMBER: I think that Donald Trump does this thing, oh, she's weak. And then, when she proves us her -- proves herself, she's nasty.
 
And so, there's this really fine line that women candidates, unfortunately have to walk. And I think she's done it really well to date.
 
ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST, ANDERSON COOPER 360: Yes. Everyone, thank you. Appreciate the conversation.

(APPLAUSE) (END VIDEOTAPE)
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BASH: Madam Vice President, Governor Walz, thank you so much for sitting down with me and bringing the bus. The bus tour is well under way here in Georgia.
 
You have less time to make your case to voters than any candidate in modern American history. The voters are really eager to hear what your plans are. If you are elected, what would you do on day one in the White House?
 
HARRIS: Well, there are a number of things.
 
I will tell you, first and foremost, one of my highest priorities is to do what we can to support and strengthen the middle class. When I look at the aspirations, the goals, the ambitions of the American people, I think that people are ready for a new way forward in a way that generations of Americans have been fueled by -- by hope and by optimism. 
 <br>[21:05:00]
 
I think, sadly, in the last decade we have had, in the former president, someone who is really been pushing an agenda and an environment that is about diminishing the character and the strength of who we are as Americans, really dividing our nation. And I think people are ready to turn the page on that. 
 
BASH: So what would you do day one? 
 
HARRIS: Day one, it's going to be about, one, implementing my plan for what I call an opportunity economy. I've already laid out a number of proposals in that regard, which include what we're going to do to bring down the cost of everyday goods, what we're going to do to invest in America's small businesses, what we're going to do to invest in families. For example, extending the Child Tax Credit to $6,000 for families for the first year of their child's life to help them buy a car-seat, to help them buy baby clothes, a crib. 
 
There's the work that we're going to do that is about investing in the American family around affordable housing. A big issue in our country right now. So there are a number of things on day one. 
 
BASH: what about you? 
 
WALZ: Well, I'm excited about this agenda too. As I said, the idea by inspiring America to what can be. And I think many of these things that the vice president is proposing are -- are things that we share in values. And the Child Tax Credit is one we know that reduces childhood poverty by a third. We did it in Minnesota, to have a federal partner in this, unbelievable, I think, in the impact that we can make.
 
BASH: You talk about -- you call it the opportunity economy. You are well aware that right now many Americans are struggling. 
 
HARRIS: Yeah, yeah.
 
BASH: There's a crisis of affordability.
 
BASH: One of your campaign themes is "we're not going back." But I wonder what you say to voters who do want to go back when it comes to the economy specifically, because their groceries were less expensive, housing was more affordable when Donald Trump was president. 
 
HARRIS: Well, let's start with the fact that when Joe Biden and I came in office, during the height of a pandemic, we saw over 10 million jobs were lost. People -- I mean, literally, we were all tracking the numbers. Hundreds people a day were dying because of COVID. The economy had crashed. In large part all of that because of mismanagement by Donald Trump of that crisis. 
 
When we came in, our highest priority was to do what we could to rescue America. And today, we know that we have inflation at under 3 percent. A lot of our policies have led to the reality that America recovered faster than any wealthy nation around the world. 
 
But you are right. Prices in particular for groceries are still too high. The American people know it, I know it, which is why my agenda includes what we need to do to bring down the price of groceries. For example, dealing with an issue like price-gouging. What we need to do to extend the Child Tax Credit to help young families be able to take care of their children in their most formative years. What we need to do to bring down the cost of housing. 
 
My proposal includes what would be a tax credit of $25,000 for first- time home buyers. So they can just have enough to put a down payment on a home which is part of the American dream and their aspiration. But do it in a way that allows them to actually get on the path to achieving that goal and that dream.
 
BASH: So you have been vice president for three-and-a-half years.
 
HARRIS: Yeah.
 
BASH: The steps that you're talking about now, why haven't you done them already? 
 
HARRIS: Well, first of all, we had to recover as an economy. And we have done that. I'm very proud of the work that we have done that has brought inflation down to less than 3 percent. The work that we have done to cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors. Donald Trump said he was going to do a number of things, including allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, never happened. We did it. 
 
So now, and I -- as I travel in the state of Georgia and around our country, the number of seniors that have benefited, I've met -- I was in Nevada recently, a grandmother who showed me her receipts, and before we capped the cost of insulin for seniors at $35 a month, she was playing hundreds of dollars, up to thousands of dollars a month for her insulin. She's not doing that any long. BASH: So you maintain Bidenomics is a success. 
 
HARRIS: I maintain that when we do the work of bringing down prescription medication for the American people, including capping the cost of the annual cost of prescription medication for seniors at $2,000, when we do what we did in the first year of being an office to extend the Child Tax Credits so that we cut child poverty in America by over 50 percent, when we do what we have done to invest in the American people in bringing manufacturing back to the United States so that we created over 800,000 new manufacturing jobs, bringing business back to America, what we have done to improve the supply chain so we're not relying on foreign governments to supply American families with their basic needs, I'll say that that's good work. 
 <br>[21:10:00]
 
There's more to do, but that's good work.
 
DANA BASH, CNN HOST: I want to get some clarity on where you stand on some key policy issues. Energy is a big one.
 
When you were in Congress, you supported the Green New Deal. And in 2019, you said, quote: There is no question I'm in favor of banning fracking.
 
Fracking, as you know, is a pretty big issue, particularly in your must-win state of Pennsylvania.
 
HARRIS: Sure.
 
BASH: Do you still want to ban fracking?
 
HARRIS: No, and I made that clear on the debate stage in 2020, that I would not ban fracking. As vice president, I did not ban fracking. As president, I will not ban fracking.
 
BASH: In 2019, I believe in a town hall, you said -- you were asked, would you commit to implementing a federal ban on fracking on your first day in office? And you said: There's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking. So, yes.
 
So, it changed in the -- in that campaign?
 
HARRIS: In 2020, I made very clear where I stand. We are in 2024, and I've not changed that position nor will I going forward. I kept my word and I will keep my word.
 
BASH: What made you change that position at the time?
 
HARRIS: Well, let's be clear, my values have not changed. I believe it is very important that we take seriously what we must do to guard against what is a clear crisis in terms of the climate. And to do that, we can do what we have accomplished thus far.
 
The Inflation Reduction Act, what we have done to invest, by my calculation, over 10 -- probably a trillion dollars over the next 10 years, investing in a clean energy economy. What we've already done creating over 300,000 new clean energy jobs.
 
That tells me, from my experience as vice president, we can do it without banning fracking. In fact, Dana -- Dana, excuse me -- I cast the tiebreaking vote that actually increased leases for fracking -- 
 
BASH: Yeah.
 
HARRIS: -- as vice president.
 
So I'm very clear about where I stand.
 
BASH: And was there some policy or scientific data that you saw that you said, oh, okay, I get it now?
 
HARRIS: What I have seen is that we can -- we can grow and we can increase a thriving clean energy economy without banning fracking.
 
BASH: Okay. Another issue, big one, is immigration. As vice president, you were tasked with addressing the root causes of migration in southern countries and -- 
 
HARRIS: Northern part of Central America.
 
BASH: The northern part of -- 
 
HARRIS: Yeah.
 
BASH: -- of Central America that deals with -- that affects the southern border of the U.S.
 
HARRIS: Yeah.
 
BASH: During the Biden-Harris administration, there were record numbers of illegal border crossings. Why did the Biden-Harris administration wait three and a half years to implement sweeping asylum restrictions?
 
HARRIS: Well, first of all, the root causes work that I did as vice president that I was asked to do by the president has actually resulted in a number of benefits, including historic investments by American businesses in that region. The number of immigrants coming from that region has actually reduced since we began that work.
 
But I will say this, that Joe Biden and I and our administration worked with members of the United States Congress on an immigration issue that is very significant to the American people and to our security, which is the border.
 
And through bipartisan work, including some of the most conservative members of the United States Congress, a bill was crafted which we supported, which I support.
 
And Donald Trump got word of this bill that would have contributed to securing our border. And because he believes that it would not have helped him politically, he told his folks in Congress, don't put it forward. He killed the bill -- a border security bill that would have put 1,500 more agents on the border.
 
And let me tell you something, the Border Patrol endorsed the bill -- 
 
BASH: (INAUDIBLE)
 
HARRIS: -- and I'm sure -- and I'm sure in large part because they knew -- they were working around the clock and 1,500 more agents would help them.
 
That bill would have allowed us to increase seizures of fentanyl.
 
Ask any community in America that has been devastated by fentanyl what passing that bill would have done to address their concern and a pain that they've experienced.
 
BASH: So you would -- so you would push that legislation again. I just want to ask about --
 
HARRIS: Not only push it. I will make sure that it comes to my desk and I would sign it.
 
BASH: Just one other question about something that you said in 2019 when you first ran. There was a debate. You raised your hand when asked whether or not the border should be decriminalized.
 
Do you still believe that?
 
HARRIS: I believe there should be consequence. We have laws that have to be followed and enforced that address and deal with people who cross our border illegally, and there should be consequence.
 <br>[21:15:00]
 
And let's be clear, in this race, I'm the only person who has prosecuted transnational criminal organizations who are trafficking guns, drugs, and human beings. I'm the only person in this race who actually served a border state as Attorney General to enforce our laws, and I would enforce our laws as President going forward. I recognize the problem.
 
BASH: Generally speaking, how should voters look at some of the changes that you've made, that you've explained some of here in your policy? Is it because you have more experience now and you've learned more about the information? Is it because you were running for President in a Democratic primary? And should they feel comfortable and confident that what you're saying now is going to be your policy moving forward?
 
HARRIS: Dana, I think the most important and most significant aspect of my policy perspective and decisions is my values have not changed. You mentioned the Green New Deal. I have always believed, and I have worked on it, that the climate crisis is real, that it is an urgent matter to which we should apply metrics that include holding ourselves to deadlines around time.
 
We did that with the Inflation Reduction Act. We have set goals for the United States of America and, by extension, the globe around when we should meet certain standards for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, as an example. That value has not changed.
 
My value around what we need to do to secure our border, that value has not changed. I spent two terms as the Attorney General of California prosecuting transnational criminal organizations, violations of American laws regarding the passage, illegal passage of guns, drugs, and human beings across our border. My values have not changed.
 
So that is the reality of it. And four years of being Vice President, I'll tell you one of the aspects, to your point, is traveling the country extensively. I mean, I'm here in Georgia. I think somebody told me 17 times since I've been Vice President in Georgia alone. I believe it is important to build consensus. And it is important to find a common place of understanding of where we can actually solve problems.
 
BASH: On that note, you had a lot of Republican speakers at the convention. Will you appoint a Republican to your cabinet?
 
HARRIS: Yes, I would.
 
BASH: Anyone in mind?
 
HARRIS: Yes, I would. No one in particular in mind. I got 68 days to go with this election, so I'm not putting the cart before the horse, but I would. I think -- I think it's really important. I -- I have spent my career inviting diversity of opinion. I think it's important to have people at the table when some of the most important decisions are being made that have different views, different experiences. And I think it would be to the benefit of the American public to have a member of my cabinet who was a Republican.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
BASH: That was just the start of our wide-ranging conversation. And we have some never-before-shared details about the phone call that changed everything between President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BASH: I'm just curious. Staying on President Biden. When he called you and said he was pulling out of the race, what was that like? And did he offer to endorse you right away? Or did you ask for it?
 
HARRIS: It was -- it was a Sunday, so -- here, I'll -- I'll give you a little too much information.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
BASH: Go for it. There's no such thing, Madam Vice President.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BASH: And her running mate, I asked him about some of the controversies that have sprung up, since Harris put him on the ticket.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BASH: Governor Walz, the country is just starting to get to know you. I want to ask you a question about how you've described your service in the National Guard.
 
T. WALZ: Yes.
 
BASH: You said that you carried weapons in war, but you have never deployed actually in a war zone. A campaign official said that you misspoke. Did you?
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[21:23:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BASH: Welcome back, live from Savannah, Georgia, and our exclusive interview with Vice President Kamala Harris, and Minnesota governor, Tim Walz.
 
In just 12 days, Harris will meet Donald Trump, on a debate stage, in Philadelphia. And when I say meet, I mean, literally, meet. Would you believe they have never talked face-to-face? The only time they've even been in the same room was when Harris was a senator, watching Trump's State of the Union address.
 
Now, it's Trump watching Harris, on the campaign trail, with money and momentum behind her, and making her case directly to voters.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BASH (voice-over): As voters are getting to know Kamala Harris, they want answers on how she will make their lives better.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A lot easier now (ph).
 
BASH (voice-over): She heard that here at Sandfly Barbeque, in Savannah.
 
HARRIS: What we're going to do to increase access to capital for small businesses, I'll be rolling out, next week, part of what we're going to be doing in terms of a tax credit.
 
BASH (voice-over): On the trail, she talks about her experience, years in the courtroom, as a district attorney, and eventually California's Attorney General. She wants to reframe the contest as the prosecutor versus the felon.
 
HARRIS: I know Donald Trump's type.
 
(CHEERING)
 
HARRIS: I've been dealing with them my whole career. BASH (voice-over): The former President is turning to a well-defined playbook of personal attacks.
 
DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I didn't know she was Black, until a number of years ago, when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black.
 
BASH (voice-over): And in just 12 days, the nominees will meet face- to-face for the first time.
 
TRUMP: She's not a good debater. She's not a smart person. She doesn't want to debate.
 
HARRIS: If you've got something to say.
 
(CHEERING)
 
HARRIS: Say it to my face.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
BASH (on camera): I want to ask you about your opponent, Donald Trump.
 
HARRIS: OK.
 
BASH: I was a little bit surprised, people might be surprised to hear that you have never interacted with him, met him face-to-face.
 
HARRIS: Mm-hmm.
 
BASH: That's going to change soon.
 
But what I want to ask you about is what he said last month. He suggested that you happened to turn black recently for political purposes, questioning a core part of your identity. 
 
HARRIS: Yeah. 
 <br>[21:25:00]
 
BASH: Any --
 
HARRIS: Same old tired playbook. Next question, please. 
 
WALZ: Yeah.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
BASH: That's it? 
 
HARRIS: That's it. 
 
BASH: OK. Let's talk about some foreign policy issues that would be on your plate if you become commander-in-chief. President Biden has tried unsuccessfully to end the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. He's been doing it for months and months, along with you. Would you do anything differently? For example, would you withhold some U.S. weapons shipments to Israel? That's what a lot of people on the progressive left want you to do. 
 
HARRIS: Let me be very clear, I'm unequivocal and -- and unwavering in my commitment to Israel's defense and its ability to defend itself. And that's not going to change. 
 
But let's take a step back. October 7, 1,200 people are massacred, many young people who are simply attending a music festival. Women were horribly raped. As I said then I say today, Israel had a right -- has a right to defend itself. We would. And how it does so matters. Far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. And we have got to get a deal done. We were in Doha. We have to get a deal done. This war must end. And --
 
BASH: In the meantime --
 
HARRIS: -- we must get a deal that is about getting the hostages out. I've met with the families of the American hostages. Let's get the hostages out. Let's get the ceasefire done.
 
BASH: But no change in policy in terms of arms and -- and so forth. 
 
HARRIS: No, I -- we have to get a deal done. Dana, we have to get a deal done. When you look at the significance of this to the families, to the people who are living in that region, a deal is not only the right thing to do to end this war, but will unlock so much of what must happen next. 
 
I remain committed, since I've been on October 8, to what we must do to work toward a two-state solution where Israel is secure and in equal measure the Palestinians have security and self-determination and -- and dignity. 
 
BASH: Governor Walz, the country is just starting to get to know you. I want to ask you a question about how you've described your service in the National Guard. You said that you carried weapons in war, but you have never deployed actually in a war zone. A campaign official said that you misspoke. Did you? 
 
WALZ: Well, first of all, I'm incredibly proud to have done 24 years of wearing the uniform of this country. Equally proud of my service in a public school classroom. Whether its Congress or -- or the governor, my record speaks for itself. But I think people are coming to get to know me. I speak like they do. I speak candidly. I wear my emotions on my sleeves. And I speak especially passionately about -- about our children being shot in schools and around -- around guns. 
 
So I think people know me. They know who I am. They know where -- where my heart is. And, again, my record has been out there for over 40 years to speak for itself.
 
BASH: And the idea that you said that you were in war, did you misspeak, as the campaign has said? WALZ: Yeah, I said we were talking about, in this case, this was after a school shooting, the ideas of carrying these weapons of war. And my wife, the English teacher, told me my grammar is not always correct. But, again, if it's not this, it's an attack on my children for showing love for me or it's an attack on my dog. I'm not going to do that. And the one thing I'll never do is I'll never demean another member's service in any way. I never have. And I never will. 
 
BASH: I just -- one other question because, again, this is all new. 
 
WALZ: Yeah.
 
BASH: This was not -- however many days ago, this was not on either of your bingo cards, especially yours. You had to clarify that you had said that you and your wife used IVF, but it turned out you used a different kind of fertility in order to have children. And then when you ran for Congress in 2006, your campaign repeatedly made false statements about a 1995 arrest for drunk and reckless driving. What do you say to voters who aren't sure whether they can take you at your word? 
 
WALZ: Well, I've been very public. I think they can see my students come out, former folks I've served with, and they do -- they vouch for me. I certainly own my mistakes when I make them. The one thing I'll tell you is, I wished in this country wouldn't have to do this. I spoke about our infertility issues because it's health. And families know this. And I spoke about the treatments that were available to us that -- that had those beautiful children there. 
 
That's quite a contrast in folks that are trying to -- to take those rights away from us. 
 
And so I -- I think people know who I am. They know that record. They've seen that I've taught thousands of students. I've been out there.
 <br>[21:30:00]
 
And I -- I won't apologize for speaking passionately, whether it's guns in schools or protecting of reproductive rights. The contrast could not be clear between what we're running against. The vice president's position on this has been clear and I think most Americans get it if you've been through that.
 
I don't think they're cutting hairs on IVF or IUI. I think what they're cutting hairs on is an abortion ban and the ability to be able to deny families the chance to have a beautiful child.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
BASH: Up next. The moment that changed everything, when Kamala Harris got a phone call from President Biden that he was dropping out of the race.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRIS: It was -- it was a Sunday, so -- here, I'll -- I'll give you a little too much information.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
BASH: Go for it. There's no such thing, Madam Vice President.
 
HARRIS: My family was staying with us. And -- including my baby nieces.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BASH: Speaking of those baby nieces, the Vice President also opens up about a viral picture from the convention that meant so much to so many.
 
And Tim Walz talks about that convention moment, with his son that brought many viewers to tears.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BASH: You were speaking. The camera caught him so incredibly proud of you, so emotional, saying, "That's my dad."
 
T. WALZ: Yes. I -- I don't know as a father I could've ever imagined that.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[21:35:10]
 
BASH: Welcome back, live from Savannah, Georgia, and our exclusive interview with the Democratic presidential and vice presidential nominees, Vice President Kamala Harris, and Minnesota governor, Tim Walz.
 
It's hard to believe it was just 39 days ago, President Biden shocked the world via tweet. That's how we found out he was dropping his reelection bid. But before he tweeted the news, Biden called his Vice President. And for the first time, we are hearing about that phone call, and exactly what Kamala Harris was doing, when she answered.
 
But we started this discussion with the moment that set all of this in motion. CNN's presidential debate, and whether President Biden was strong enough to lead this nation again.

BASH: Vice President Harris, you were a very staunch defender of President Biden's capacity to serve another four years. Right after the debate, you insisted that President Biden is extraordinarily strong. Given where we are now, do you have any regrets about what you told the American people?
 
HARRIS: No, not at all. Not at all. I have served with President Biden for almost four years now, and I'll tell you, it's one of the greatest honors of my career, truly. He cares so deeply about the American people. He is so smart and -- and loyal to the American people.
 
And I have spent hours upon hours with him, be it in the Oval Office or the Situation Room. He has the intelligence, the commitment and the judgment and disposition that I think the American people rightly deserve in their president. By contrast, the former president has none of that.
 
And so, one, I -- I am so proud to have served as vice president to Joe Biden. And two, I am so proud to be running with Tim Walz for president of the United States and to bring America what I believe the American people deserve, which is a new way forward and turn the page on the last decade of what I believe has been contrary to where the spirit of our country really lies.
 
BASH: But the last decade, of course, the last three and a half years has been part of your administration.
 
HARRIS: I'm talking about an era that started about a decade ago where there is some suggestion, warped, I believe it to be, that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down instead of where I believe most Americans are, which is to believe that the true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up. That's what's at stake as much as any other detail that we could discuss in this election.
 
BASH: Because we haven't had a chance to talk, I'm just curious, staying on President Biden, when he called you and said he was pulling out of the race, what was that like? And did he offer to endorse you right away or did you ask for it?
 
HARRIS: It was -- it was a Sunday. So here, I'll give you a little too much information.
 
BASH: Go for it. There's no such thing, Madam Vice President.
 
HARRIS: My family was staying with us and including my baby nieces. And we had just had pancakes and, you know, Auntie, can I have more bacon? Yes, I'll make you more bacon. And then we were going to sit -- we were sitting down to do a puzzle. And the phone rang and it was Joe Biden. And -- and he told me what he had decided to do. And I asked him, are you sure? And he said, yes. And -- but that's how I learned about it.
 
BASH: And what about the endorsement? Did you ask for it?
 
HARRIS: He was very clear that he was going to support me.
 
BASH: So when he called to tell you, he said, I'm pulling out of the race and I'm going to support you.
 
HARRIS: Well, my first thought was not about me, to be honest with you. My first thought was about him. To be honest. I think history is going to show a number of things about Joe Biden's presidency. I think history is going to show that in so many ways it was transformative, be it on what we have accomplished around finally investing in America's infrastructure, investing in new economies, in new industries, what we have done to bring our allies back together and have confidence in who we are as America and grow that alliance, what we have done to stand true to our principles, including the -- one of the most important international rules and norms, which is the importance of sovereignty and territorial integrity.
 <br>[21:40:00]
 
And I think history is going to show not only has Joe Biden led an administration that has achieved those extraordinary successes, but the character of the man is one that he has been in his life and career, including as a president, quite selfless and puts the American people first.

BASH: A passionate defense of the man, who chose her to be his running mate, four years ago. Four years later, Harris made a choice of her own.
 
And with Governor Walz's rise to national prominence, a star was born at the convention. Gus Walz. We'll hear about that moment, between father and son.
 
And the woman who could make history in the Oval Office, on this iconic photo.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BASH: Madam Vice President, the photograph that has gone viral. You were speaking. One of your grandnieces that you were just talking about--
 
HARRIS: Yes.
 
BASH: --was watching you accept the nomination. You didn't explicitly talk about gender or race in your speech. But it obviously means a lot to a lot of people. And that--
 
HARRIS: Yes.
 
BASH: --viral picture really says it. What does it mean to you?

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[21:45:00]
 
BASH: We're back live, from Savannah, Georgia, and our CNN exclusive interview with Vice President Kamala Harris, and her running mate, who was supposed to be, if you listened to some experts, a big name, a prominent leader from a swing state, Pennsylvania or Arizona.
 
But it is a little-known guy outside of his home state, where Minnesota Nice is a source of pride. But behind all of that folksy humor and flannel, Tim Walz is far from just being Mr. Nice Guy, when it comes to needling Donald Trump.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BASH (on camera): Governor, you obviously have spoken to voters, all over your state for years.
 
T. WALZ: Yes.
 
BASH (on camera): What are you learning in a place like Georgia?
 
T. WALZ: We're seeing explosion in small business growth. The one thing is, is workforce and child care, because workers have to have child care.
 
BASH (voice-over): Campaigning with Tim Walz.
 
T. WALZ: How are you doing (ph)?
 
BASH (voice-over): Finding his role in this historic campaign.
 
HARRIS: Would you be my running mate? And let's get this thing on the road?
 
T. WALZ: I would be honored, Madam Vice President.
 
BASH (voice-over): After bursting onto the national stage, with this word.
 
T. WALZ: These guys are just weird.
 
BASH (voice-over): Known as a folksy father of two, from rural America, now a running mate, who is not holding back.
 
T. WALZ: Listen to the guy. He's talking about Hannibal Lecter, and shocking sharks, and just whatever crazy thing pops into his mind.
 
BASH (voice-over): And finding his own rhythm with his new boss.
 
BASH (on camera): What did you order?
 
HARRIS: Brisket and grains and mac and cheese.
 
BASH (on camera): What about you?
 
T. WALZ: I had the brisket, coleslaw on this.
 
BASH (on camera): And what about the spice situation, the Tabasco? What's happening with that?
 
HARRIS: I'm going to let him speak for himself.
 
T. WALZ: The Vice President's growing peppers at her residence, so she's trying to, like, bring me along on this. You know, Minnesotans, are--
 
HARRIS: It's OK. It's all -- it's all good. T. WALZ: I'm getting there. I'm getting there.
 
HARRIS: You just do you.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BASH: I just have to ask you both about to standout moments, aside, of course, from the addresses that you both gave, but standout moments that were perhaps unexpected during the convention. 
 
You mentioned one of them, Governor, a moment that you shared, that the world shared with your son, Gus. You were speaking, the cameras caught him, so incredibly proud of you, so emotional, saying, that's my dad. 
 
WALZ: Yeah. I -- I don't know as a father I could have ever imagined that. I -- I'm grateful for so many reasons to be on this ticket, but that moment, to understand what was really important, to -- to have my son feel a sense of pride in me, that I was trying to do the right thing. And it was -- you know, you try and protect your kids, you know, it brings -- it brings notoriety and things, but it was just such a visceral emotional moment that I'm -- I'm just -- I'm grateful I got to experience it and I'm so proud of him. I'm proud of him. I'm proud of Hope. I'm proud of Gwen. Shes' a wonderful mother and these are great kids. 
 
And I think the one thing is talking about the era we're in is, our politics can be better. It can be different. We can -- we can show some of these things and we can have families involved in this. And I -- I hope that there was a -- I hope people felt that out there. And I hope they hugged their kids a little tighter because you just never know. And life can be kind of hard. 
 
BASH: And -- and last question, Madam Vice President, the photograph that has gone viral. You were speaking, one of your grandnieces that you were just talking about --
 
HARRIS: Yes. 
 
BASH: -- was watching you accept the nomination. You didn't explicitly talk about gender or race in your speech, but it obviously means a lot to a lot of people and that viral picture really says it. What does it mean to you? 
 
HARRIS: You know, I -- listen, I am running because I believe that I am the best person to do this job at this moment. For all, Americans, regardless of race and gender. But I did see that photograph and I was deeply touched by it. And you're right, she's -- it's the back of her head, her two little braids and -- and then I'm in the front of the photograph obviously speaking. And it's very humbling. It's very humbling in many ways. 
 
BASH: Did she talk to you about it afterwards? 
 
HARRIS: Oh, she had a lot to talk about. 
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
HARRIS: She had a lot. She listened to everything. And she listens to everything.
 
BASH: She give you her hot takes?
 
HARRIS: Oh, yeah, definitely, uh-huh. 
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
BASH: Madam Vice President, Governor Walz, thank you so much for your time. Appreciate it. 
 
HARRIS: Thank you. 
 
WALZ: Thanks for having us. 
 
HARRIS: Thank you, Dana. Thank you. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
BASH: This was Vice President Harris' first real, unscripted setting, where voters could see and hear her explain some of her policy positions now, and how they differ from before she became vice president, and why.
 
And this was the first we heard those details, about an extraordinary phone call, from a president, dropping out of the race, and endorsing his vice president, something that will certainly go down in history.
 <br>[21:50:00]
 
CNN has also invited both President Trump and Senator J.D. Vance to sit down with us. We hope to bring that interview to you as well. 
 
We have plenty of CNN's special coverage ahead. I want to go to my friend and colleague, Abby Phillip, who is standing by with some of the best political minds in the business.
 
Abby.
 
ABBY PHILLIP, CNN HOST, CNN NEWSNIGHT WITH ABBY PHILLIP: We have them all here.
 
Dana, you've given us a lot to chew on. Our hats off to you. Thank you very much. Stick around, though. We will make sure to come back to you, throughout the next hour.
 
I want to get in the room here, to get some initial reactions, with our great panel.
 
David Axelrod, let's start with you. What did you make of how Vice President Harris did? Did she meet the moment?
 
DAVID AXELROD, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, FORMER SENIOR ADVISER TO OBAMA: Yes, I think she did what she needed to do.
 
What she needed to do is be the same person that people have seen, on the stage, for the last month, and have seen a new sense of sort of confidence, of calm and comfortable -- comfort that we haven't seen before, from her, or we didn't see certainly the last time she ran.
 
She was -- she was very connected to her words. She seemed strong. She seemed competent. She seemed like someone who could be President of the United States. That was the first test.
 
One thing, because I know we got a lot of opinions here.
 
PHILLIP: We have time for yours. Don't worry.
 
AXELROD: Yes. But I think she -- I think -- well two things, then. I think that she handled the issue of her changes, or perceived changes in policy, pretty well. I mean, I think the idea that her values have been the same, and have been consistent was a good bridge there.
 
One thing that I want to note is the -- we were asking the question earlier, how will she handle the President, and will she separate herself from the President? And there might be some political logic to doing that. She's turning -- about turning the page. Does she want to be a continuation? That's what the Republicans will want to make her out to be. I'll give Scott the opportunity to do it in a second.
 
But as she spoke, I thought it showed a certain character, the way she talked about Joe Biden. She didn't run away from him. She gave him, I think, his due. She understands that there's some political risk to that. That actually was elevating to me in a way that I hadn't expected.
 
ALLISON: Yes.
 
AXELROD: So, I think, on the whole, this was a good night. It wasn't a huge -- I don't think she moved the ball that much forward. But she certainly didn't fall back.
 
PHILLIP: The do-no-harm principle of politicking here.
 
AUDIE CORNISH, CNN CORRESPONDENT, CNN HOST, "THE ASSIGNMENT" PODCAST: Yes.
 
PHILLIP: Audie?
 
CORNISH: I mean, interviews, they can be combat, they can be a conversation. And what she needed to do was communicate.
 
And so often in the past, she comes to an interview, in a way, prepared to be the interrogator. And people already know she's good at asking sharp, tough questions of people, who she feels deserve scrutiny. It's her being under that scrutiny, that has been, where the stakes have been higher.
 
And I think, today, it did show that she has the ability to sit down, and have that back-and-forth that Republicans are talking about. Can she really do it? So how many more times? I don't know how much that matters.
 
And I do get a little nervous, in the media, we're preoccupied with, like, how much access, how many conversations is she going to have, in the settings, we deem most valuable to voters. When, this is a campaign that is actually making a mark in an interesting way, reaching out to people directly.
 
PHILLIP: But Astead, you have also spent a couple of times now, interviewing her. What did you make of how she handled it? I mean, to David's point, a little bit more comfortable now than she has been in the past.
 
ASTEAD HERNDON, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST, PODCAST HOST, "THE RUN-UP," NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, THE NEW YORK TIMES: Yes, I think, there's been a consistent story of growth. She's been in more of these settings. I think we saw that somewhat tonight.
 
I also think to the question about how policy positions have changed, they were clearly ready with an answer, about how the values have been consistent. For me, and one of the -- one of the lines that stuck out was, this is a new -- I think people are ready for a new way forward. She said that a couple times.
 
It goes to David's point. I don't think there's a policy separation that they've created with Biden. Obviously, she gave a kind of personal defense of him. But they're also very clearly trying to position her as a change candidate, in the same way that Donald Trump is positioning himself as a change candidate. In some ways, it feels as if that's going to be the crux of what this comes down to in November is whether that is bought by the electorate or not.
 
PHILLIP: And interestingly--
 
HERNDON: But--
 
PHILLIP: --there is some polling to suggest that it's a battle right now. It's actually a live ball.
 
HERNDON: It seems that that's where this might live and die.
 
But I think it's really -- it's really interesting, because for someone, who doesn't want to talk about race and gender, who doesn't want to kind of put that identity forward, it is allowing her to make the case of change, without kind of saying those words. And so, I thought that was really in the air of this speech.
 
But to the point about normal versus weird, the future versus past, dichotomy that they're trying to create, I think they landed that tonight. I think they want to present them as a package that is relatable to people, and that is someone you feel familiar, whose story is familiar, whose message is familiar and relatable. And I think that's something that she's grown in. And we saw that, this evening.
 
PHILLIP: Interesting.
 
Ashley?
 <br>[21:55:00]
 
ALLISON: So, I think I would break this down into three parts, values, vision and her voice. And I think she made it very clear that she is still committed to her values, to be an American, to be a prosecutor, even though she may have changed on some positions. And she clearly outlined -- outlined where she had changed.
 
I think, on the vision, she draw the -- she attempted to draw the contrast without talking about Donald Trump, but still being very clear, and not berating her current boss, actually.
 
And when you think about the opposite ticket of J.D. Vance, where Donald Trump's vice president isn't even on the ticket anymore. We don't need to go down why that is the case.
 
But she was clearly able to draw her vision for how she wants to take the country forward, with her opportunity economy. And then her voice. I think so many Americans want to know who is she, and does she have command of her voice?
 
And she answered every question. Now, you might not like the way she answered them. But she answered them as a capable, qualified leader. And I do think she -- I think she moved the ball forward a little bit. Maybe she didn't score a touchdown, tonight. But she definitely moved down the field.
 
PHILLIP: All right. Scott?
 
JENNINGS: I agree with Astead about this idea of the question of who's going to change, will be the fundamental defining question in the election.
 
And I was sort of watching this holistically. What is she saying? What does she look like? What's on the screen?
 
So at the beginning, when she's talking about Biden and their record, our screen said, this is called the chyron, the headline at the bottom, it said, Harris stands by Biden administration economic record.
 
She is making it clear that she will embrace, and be a continuation of Biden's economic policy, his record, what they've done. She didn't offer -- she offered no remorse, no regrets, no introspection about anything they've done. 
 
She continued to blame inflation on this fantasy price gouging idea. She had no additional thoughts, on the economic situation, in the country, or what they've done beyond just saying, Joe Biden and I have done a great job.
 
Now, if I were the Trump people, I would be salivating over the idea that that's how they are going to run the race. I don't believe it's tenable. I also thought it was interesting that she didn't take any responsibility, at the end, for telling the American people that Joe Biden was fine, and he was strong. When we all know that's not true. That's why he's out of the race. And she's still standing by the idea that he was fine, and he's strong, and then he's fine today. Nobody believes that. And I just think, at some point, I just--
 
ALLISON: I do.
 
JENNINGS: Then why isn't he running?
 
ALLISON: Because he's too old. Point-blank. Same reason why Donald Trump probably shouldn't be running because he's too old and out of touch.
 
JENNINGS: I think most Americans know the truth. And when you're running to be president, and you're willing to look them in the face, and tell them something, they know that you know is not true? It does speak a little bit to your--
 
PHILLIP: I think it's also a question, Scott.
 
JENNINGS: --to your character.
 
PHILLIP: And curious what you think about this, Axe.
 
Will voters care about that part of it, which is kind of backward- looking? Or do they care about what's next?
 
AXELROD: Well, I think, the part of what Scott raised that could be problematical if they prosecuted properly, is, I think Biden deserves a lot more credit, frankly, for guiding the country through the pandemic, and the economic calamity that he walked into than he gets.
 
But inflation, over a period of years, has been a heavy toll on people, here and around the world. But around the world is not relevant here. And so, to the degree that they can say she is going to continue doing exactly what Joe Biden was doing? For people who don't have confidence in Biden's policies? That is a prospective problem.
 
I don't think the thing about, you know, this whole thing about -- you didn't say it tonight, but you've said before, and I just disagree with. This notion that -- Dana actually asked the question. Well, you've been there for three and a half years.
 
No vice president makes policy, OK? Let's just make that clear.
 
JENNINGS: Well--
 
AXELROD: Nobody has said this before.
 
JENNINGS: She did.
 
AXELROD: Nobody -- nobody -- nobody talks about the Pence years, OK?
 
JENNINGS: Well-- AXELROD: Nobody talks about the Biden years, when Obama was. But nobody does that, so.
 
But it is a challenge for her, to take credit for the things that are good, and to try and walk away from the things that are not.
 
PHILLIP: What's--
 
JENNINGS: But she did make policy though. I mean, she said I was the last person in the room on Afghanistan, and she cast many, many tie- breaking votes.
 
AXELROD: That doesn't--
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
AXELROD: She didn't.
 
PHILLIP: --necessarily.
 
AXELROD: That's different than saying that she made the decision.
 
PHILLIP: Yes.
 
ALLISON: Yes.
 
JENNINGS: She was -- she claimed--
 
AXELROD: I--
 
JENNINGS: --to be his last and most principal adviser on Afghanistan. That is not--
 
PHILLIP: She said she was--
 
AXELROD: That's--
 
JENNINGS: That's her word.
 
PHILLIP: She said she was the last person in the room. And she did not say--
 
JENNINGS: What does that mean to you?
 
PHILLIP: --she created the Afghanistan policy.
 
AXELROD: It means that she's told him whatever she thought.
 
JENNINGS: Boy.
 
AXELROD: And he did whatever he thought--
 
PHILLIP: I do think--
 
AXELROD: --what he wanted to do. PHILLIP: One of the things that struck me about -- and as someone who, like Astead, has covered Kamala Harris before. She is a homework doer. And you can see the homework has been done in this interview.
 
And it really kind of makes me wonder about, as we push toward this debate that's coming up, this meeting between these two, what kind of debate sparring partner is she going to be against Trump? And to me, the answer was, discipline.
 
CORNISH: Yes, she's ready to be on the defense. I don't think that is a difficult place for her to be. I think it's easier for her to be prosecutorial. And I believe, isn't the sparring partner that Trump is preparing with, Tulsi Gabbard, who has actually been toe-to-toe with Kamala Harris?
 
So, I do think you are going to see kind of an energetic conversation. But I do -- but part of it is, what is she like on the offense?
 
PHILLIP: Yes.
 
CORNISH: We know what she's like on the defense--</pre>
