COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: What`s up everyone. The weekend is just around the corner. I am pumped and ready to rock with you one more time this week.
 
I`m Coy Wire, aka Coy Boy, or your boy Coy, as some of you`ve been calling me on social. Love it. This is CNN 10, your new show where I tell you the 
 
 what, letting you decide what to think.
 
We`re going to start with your headlines. We begin in Haiti, where the entire country is now under a state of emergency. Violent gangs have taken 
 
 control of much of the capital city of Port-au-Prince, and they`re trying to spread to other regions.
 
The expanded state of emergency comes as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken travels to the embattled nation. He`s there to lend support to the 
 
 Haitian government as it tries to get the violence under control. 
 
The U.S. is the biggest funder of a U.N.-backed security mission trying to fight the gangs. America has pledged more than $300 million to help Haiti 
 
 in its efforts to restore order. 
 
Next, we head to the California town with a different kind of state of emergency, land shifting. It`s happening in the Pacific Ocean city of 
 
 Rancho Palos Verdes. The land in the area is moving so severely that it`s tearing homes apart and disrupting power lines. 
 
Officials say the land there has been shifting slowly for decades, but the problem has suddenly gotten worse and quickly. CNN`s Stephanie Elam has 
 
 more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
STEPHANIE ELAM, CNN CORRESPONDENT: This is the edge of a landslide here in Rancho Palos Verdes. Look at what it`s done to this house, which is 
 
 collapsing down into the earth here. You can see that it`s sinking down below where it should be. You can see by the railing to the stairs to the 
 
 house, and also you can see what it`s done to the road beyond it. Even the house beyond that, you can see that it looks like it`s shifting in the 
 
 middle of the building. 
 
Now, the land here in Rancho Palos Verdes is coveted because of the Pacific Ocean views along the coast here, but also the land`s been shifting here 
 
 for a long time, but just never at this accelerated clip, local officials say. They say it`s moving in some places by about 10 inches a week, so much 
 
 so that the governor has declared a state of emergency and they`ve cut off the power and the gas lines to certain neighborhoods because of the earth 
 
 moving just so fast.

WIRE: Next up, Pope Francis is the 87-year-old head of the Catholic Church, but he`s delivering a message of dialogue between all religious faiths as 
 
 he travels across Southeast Asia and the Pacific. The Pope is the leader of the Roman Catholic Church, which has more than one billion followers 
 
 worldwide. He`s also the head of state of Vatican City, which is actually its own country within the city of Rome in Italy.
 
He became the Catholic Church`s 266th Pope in 2013, and as Christopher Lamb reports, he`s now embarking on the longest trip since his inauguration.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHRISTOPHER LAMB, CNN VATICAN CORRESPONDENT: Pope Francis is embarking on the longest foreign trip of his pontificate. He`s going to four countries 
 
 across Southeast Asia and the Pacific, covering almost 33,000 kilometers. It`s the longest trip that any Pope has embarked upon. Francis will be 
 
 going to Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, East Timor and Singapore.
 
Now top of the agenda of this trip is interfaith dialog. Francis will be in Indonesia, which is a country which has the world`s largest Muslim 
 
 population. He`ll be taking part in an interfaith dialog event at the Istiqlal Mosque, the largest Mosque in Southeast Asia. It`s a mosque that 
 
 is connected via a tunnel to the Catholic Cathedral across the road.
 
It is an embodiment of the vision that Francis has for Catholic Muslim relations, the importance of coexistence and friendship. And he will be 
 
 hoping that this message of dialog between faiths can resonate across the world at a time of growing conflicts and rising religious extremism.
 
Now, Francis will also have the opportunity to support the Catholic communities in these Southeast Asian and Pacific countries, countries that 
 
 are increasingly playing an important role in global Catholicism. 
 
Now the Pope, of course, is 87-years-old. He uses a wheelchair. He`s had some health difficulties. Some are asking whether he will be able to carry 
 
 out this trip at all. Nevertheless, Francis has shown he is determined to embark upon this trip the longest of his pontificate. And he`s showing 
 
 people, those critics who perhaps, are doubting whether he has still got the energy left to be Pope, that he still has plenty of gas left in the 
 
 tank.

WIRE: Pop quiz, hot shot. Which European capital city is home to a famous structure originally constructed for the 1889 World`s Fair? 
 
London, Munich, Paris, or Rome?
 
If you said Paris, say ooh-la-la-wee-wee. The Eiffel Tower is one of the most famous landmarks in the world, standing some 300 meters, or 984 feet, 
 
 towards the Parisian sky. 
 
Up next, ooh-la-la-wee-wee, head to France. The Paris Olympics may be over, but the symbol of those games may be sticking around. The mayor of Paris 
 
 says she wants the Olympic rings that were installed on the Eiffel Tower to stay there. Originally, they were supposed to come down after the ongoing 
 
 Paralympics has the closing ceremony this month.
 
But the mayor says she wants the spirit of the celebration to remain, and that the rings are a symbol of transformation of the city. Residents are 
 
 divided on the plan to keep the rings. The descendants of Gustave Eiffel, the engineer who designed the famous tower, they`re against the idea.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SASKYA VANDOORNE, CNN SENIOR FIELD PRODUCER: This was the iconic symbol of the Olympics this summer, but why is it causing so much controversy?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think it`s an eyesore. It`s something different, but the Eiffel Tower has been there for years and years, and I don`t think it 
 
 needs to change.
 
VANDOORNE: These Olympic rings could soon be a permanent fixture.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think it`s OK for now, but not forever, because it`s a historical monument, you know, so.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: For me, the tower is amazing. You know, it`s so beautiful, but with the ring, look a little bit different. So I think it`s 
 
 not very aesthetic.
 
VANDOORNE (voice-over): The city of Paris owns the Eiffel Tower, and officials say the decision is up to them.
 
PIERRE RABADAN, PARIS DEPUTY MAYOR: This event was a massive success probably all around the world, and it will be changing Paris forever in a 
 
 good way. Visually, when you will be in Paris, remember that this moment was a key in the history of Paris, so that`s why we chose that symbol.
 
VANDOORNE: For descendants of its creator, Gustave Eiffel, they don`t want his legacy to become an advertising platform.
 
SAVIN YEATMAN-EIFFEL, DESCENDANT OF GUSTAVE EIFFEL: So Gustave Eiffel is my great-great-great-grandfather. We were very happy to have the during the 
 
 Olympic Games. It was a great moment, but the premise was permanent, the Eiffel Tower was never meant to be a billboard for any other company or 
 
 brand, no matter how prestigious it may be.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
WIRE: Now if the rings do stay, fun fact, it won`t be the same set we see on the tower now. They weigh 30 tons, so they need to be replaced with a 
 
 more lightweight version. 
 
Today`s story, getting a 10 out of 10, is long overdue. A Virginia Library says a book that was borrowed 50 years ago has finally been returned. 
 
 Leaves of Grass by American poet Walt Whitman was due back on June 3rd of 1974. A woman told the library she found the book while cleaning out her 
 
 sister`s house, and she had the novel idea to bring it back.
 
Good thing for her. The library no longer charges overdue fines. If it did, the library estimates the amount owed could have been more than 1,700 
 
 bucks. 
 
You know, a book just fell on my head last night. I only have my shelf to blame. 
 
Our shout-out today is going to Sims Middle School in Union, South Carolina. Go Tigers! Cue that Friday music now, there. 
 
Have an awesome weekend, everyone. Rise up. Go introduce yourself to someone new today. Make someone smile. Shine bright from your small corner 
 
 of this world. Remember, you are more powerful than you know. 
 
I`m Coy Wire. It`s been a blessing to spend this week with you. you.
