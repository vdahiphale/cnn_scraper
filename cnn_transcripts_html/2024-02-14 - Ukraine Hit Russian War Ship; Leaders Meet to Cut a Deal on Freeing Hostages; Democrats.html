ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN ANCHOR: Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us here in the United States, around the world and streaming us on CNN Max. I'm Rosemary Church. 
 
Just ahead, inching forward but not quite there. A U.S. official says talks in Cairo aimed at freeing the Gaza hostages were productive and serious, but a final deal remains elusive. 
 
Plus a special election in New York turns into a big win for U.S. House Democrats, further narrowing the GOP's razor thin majority. And House Republicans try again to impeach the head of U.S. Homeland Security, this time succeeding by the thinnest of margins. 
 
We begin this hour with breaking news and what appears to be a naval triumph for Ukraine. A defense official there says Ukrainian drones sank a prominent Russian warship in the Black Sea, the Caesar Kunikov. We are told the drones damaged the large landing vessel beyond repair. 
 
CNN cannot confirm the claims. No comment from the Kremlin but if confirmed, this could be a significant blow to its Black Sea fleet. No word yet on casualties. 
 
A U.S. official says negotiations are ongoing but there's still been no breakthrough in talks aimed at reaching a deal to pause the fighting and free the remaining hostages in Gaza. 
 
CIA Director Bill Burns traveled to Cairo for those talks. He discussed the situation in Gaza with Egypt's president who also met with Qatar's prime minister. The hostage talks have failed to bridge gaps between the parties with one key issue being a disagreement over the ratio of Palestinian prisoners to hostages that would be released as part of a deal. The talks come as international concern and opposition grows over
 
 Israel's expected ground offensive into the southern Gaza city of Rafah. The U.N. aid chief says such an operation could lead to a slaughter, while the U.N. secretary general says it would have devastating consequences. 
 
More than one million people are believed to be in Rafah, most displaced from other parts of Gaza. Some now say they are fleeing the city ahead of a potential ground incursion. 
 
And CNN's Paula Hancocks is following developments from Abu Dhabi, she joins us now, and journalist Elliott Gotkine is standing by in London. 
 
So, Paula, let's go to you first and just bring us up to date with the situation. 
 
PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Rosemary, we're seeing an increasing number of countries, of officials within the United Nations warning Israel against an invasion of Rafah. We heard from the Israeli prime minister back on Friday saying he wanted a plan from his military to say how they were going to evacuate the people from Rafah to other areas. 
 
That plan, as far as we know, has not been given to the government at this point, but you have some 1.3 million civilians that are in Rafah. The vast majority of them, close to a million, have been displaced from other areas in Gaza. Some of them have been displaced a number of times, trying to flee the fighting. Many of them saying this is where they were told to go by the Israeli military, and they are tired of moving and do not know where to go, where they could be safe. 
 
So we're hearing an increasing number of world leaders saying that they are concerned about this happening. Ireland's Prime Minister, for example, Leo Varadkar, is one of the latest to say that he believes that Israel is, quote, "blinded by rage," also saying that it's very clear that Israel is not listening to any other country in the world at the moment, including the United States. 
 
Now, we have had indication from within the Biden administration people familiar with what is going on there, that there is growing frustration from the U.S. president himself as to what President Netanyahu is doing and the fact they do not believe that the guidance they are giving is being heeded. 
 
Now also we heard from the UNH Chief Martin Griffiths saying that a military operation could lead to a slaughter, saying it would leave humanitarian efforts in Gaza at death's door.
 <br>[03:05:04]
 
We've also seen from the Egyptian side of the border with Gaza that there seems to be, according to European security officials, a build- up of security potentially concerned about any spillover from what could happen if this operation did go ahead. 
 
CHURCH: And, Elliott, let's go to you now, live in London. What is the latest on those hostage negotiation talks in Cairo? 
 
ELLIOTT GOTKINE, JOURNALIST: Rosemary, no breakthrough, but no breakdown in the talks either. They are still ongoing, albeit perhaps at a lower level. We, of course, had the head of the Mossad from Israel. We had his counterpart from Egypt and, of course, his counterpart from the U.S., Bill Burns, and also the Qatari prime minister as well discussing the framework deal that was proposed in Paris just the other week and also Hamas's counter proposal for a hostage deal that would see the more than 100 Israeli hostages who were taken captive as part of Hamas's terrorist attacks of October the 7th, who've been in captivity now for more than four months, released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. 
 
And one of the sticking points we understand from the U.S. official is the ratio of Palestinian prisoners to be freed in exchange for those Israeli hostages. We heard regarding Hamas's proposal last week, that it was asking for all women, minors, elderly, sick Palestinian prisoners to be freed. 
 
That doesn't seem to be so controversial for the Israelis. Where they seem to have a problem is with the next batch that Hamas was demanding, some 1,500 Palestinian prisoners, including a third of whom who are serving life sentences, some of them for killing Israelis or being part of attacks that killed Israelis. 
 
Indeed, you'll recall Prime Minister Netanyahu last week referring to Hamas' demands as delusional. Now, there is still optimism that this gulf can be bridged between Israel and Hamas. Hamas wasn't part of those negotiations in Cairo. Its position is being presented by the Egyptians and the Qataris. 
 
There is still hope, but no breakthrough yet and certainly pressure building on Netanyahu to do some kind of deal. 
 
CHURCH: All right. Our thanks to Paula Hancocks and Elliott Gotkine for their reports. I appreciate it. 
 
Democrats have scored a major victory in a New York special election for the U.S. House. Tom Suozzi will win the open seat that once belonged to disgraced Republican George Santos. 
 
Suozzi beat Republican Mazi Pilip 54 percent to 46 percent. The border and immigration were key issues for voters and Suozzi says He's ready to work across the aisle to address those problems. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
TOM SUOZZI (D), CONGRESSMAN-ELECT: It's time to find common ground and start delivering for the people of the United States of America. 
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
SUOZZI: The people are watching. They want us to start working together. So our message is very clear. Either get on board or get out of the way. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: More now from CNN congressional correspondent Lauren Fox. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
LAUREN FOX, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: A major upset for Republicans as Tom Suozzi, the Democrat, is headed back to Capitol Hill, narrowing the Republican majority even further and making it even tougher for Speaker Mike Johnson to get legislation across the finish line in his chamber. 
 
Republicans blaming the weather, the turnout, and arguing that Tom Suozzi just had such high name I.D. that it was almost impossible to beat him. But obviously Republicans who are watching this race closely, especially Republicans from vulnerable districts, swing districts in this area, they are going to be taking some key lessons. 
 
One of the things Suozzi was able to do in this race was really flip the script when it came to immigration. Republicans have been using that as a cudgel against Democrats in elections over the last several years. Tom Suozzi made his case that he would have supported a bipartisan Senate immigration bill and that Mazi Pilip did not have any answers to actually solve that issue. 
 
The key question now, if Republicans couldn't win on the issue of immigration here in New York, third, where can they actually win on that issue? 
 
For CNN, Lauren Fox. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHURCH: In Washington, the historic impeachment trial of Alejandro Mayorkas is unlikely to go anywhere in the democratic U.S. Senate. The upper chamber will take up the matter after the Republican-led House voted to impeach the homeland security Secretary on Tuesday. 
 
This is only the second time in U.S. history and the first in nearly 150 years that a member of the president's cabinet has been impeached. 
 <br>[03:09:59]
 
U.S. President Joe Biden criticized the impeachment, which passed by just one vote as a, quote, "blatant act of unconstitutional partisanship."
 
To Los Angeles now and Michael Genovese, president of the Global Policy Institute at Loyola Marymount University. Thank you so much for joining us. 
 
MICHAEL GENOVESE, PRESIDENT OF GLOBAL POLICY INSTITUTE, LOYOLA MARYMOUNT UNIVERSITY: Always my pleasure, Rosemary. 
 
CHURCH: So a huge victory for Democrats in that special election in New York with a win for Tom Suozzi narrowing that GOP raise a thin House majority. So how significant is this victory and what, if anything, might it signal for the November election?
 
GENOVESE: It was an upset. First of all, it was a seat held by the Republicans. The Democrats flipped it. The Democrat got 54 percent of the votes. It was a comfortable victory. It was a victory in the suburbs. And there was a question of who was going to win the suburbs in 2024. That's an indication the Democrats can do well there. It was a good test. 
 
And one of the most interesting things, I think, is that the Democrat won not because of the issues, but in spite of the issues. The issues seem to favor the Republicans. Immigration was the most important issue. The border was very important. And crime, the Democrat found a strategy for dealing with that, which is to confront those issues, just talk about them openly and not try to hide from them. 
 
And so that may be a bellwether in that it indicates that the Democrats now may have developed a strategy for the '24 campaign, which is to go against Trump, to confront the issues, not to run away from them, and also run against the do-nothing Congress. 
 
So that could be very significant because the Democrats were looking for a message and a strategy, maybe it'll come out of the New York race. 
 
CHURCH: And you mentioned immigration, House Republicans impeached Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas Tuesday night, succeeding on their second try. It is an effort to punish the Biden administration for its immigration policy, but this will be killed off in the Senate. 
 
So what was achieved given Republicans rejected a bipartisan bill that would have fixed many of the problems Republicans have complained about at the southern border? 
 
GENOVESE: This is a pyrrhic victory for the Republicans, in the House at least. They can't pass legislation to solve problems. And so you've got Ukraine funding, you've got money for aid for Israel, you've got immigration, you've got the border, but all these issues that they're not dealing with. And so instead they go for a kind of frivolous stunt, a show that has no real political impact. It's all simple, very little substance. 
 
In the process, however, they're degrading and cheapening impeachment. The standard that we'd always had is, constitutionally, high crimes and misdemeanors. There are no high crimes or misdemeanors. Here it was a policy disagreement. 
 
And so, by dumbing down what it means to impeach, they open a door, kind of a Pandora's box, that in the future could come back to haunt them. And so I'm not sure it was much of a victory. The long and winding road of impeachment went from Nixon to Mayorkas. It went from high crimes and misdemeanors to partisan bickering. And from there, I don't think the Republicans are no longer going to win. I think that's going to come back to haunt them. 
 
CHURCH: And meantime, on a more global scale, U.S. President Joe Biden accused former President Donald Trump of bowing to Russia's President Putin when he threatened NATO member nations, saying he wouldn't defend those who didn't pay up should they come under attack and even encourage Russia to do whatever the hell it wants, his words. 
 
So President Biden called Trump's comments dangerous, dumb, shameful and un-American. How will this likely play with voters, do you think, and of course with NATO allies? 
 
GENOVESE: Well, you know, Biden was understating, in my view. He was a president who was rooting for Russia to attack our NATO allies. I was unbelievably naive of him or dangerous of him. NATO has been around for 75 years. It was the great alliance that successfully fought communism. It was a great military, political, and cultural unification of the U.S. and the European powers. 
 
And we, the U.S. and NATO, developed the post-World War II structure of the international economy and international political alliances, that now is breaking down because Donald Trump says he will get out of NATO, he's not going to apply Article 5, which would come to the aid of any NATO country that's attacked. 
 <br>[03:14:55]
 
And so it just makes no sense. This is an issue Biden should be pushing, should be running on. The Democrats should buy ads with that, with Donald Trump's quote and just spend as much money as you can, letting the American people see what Donald Trump said. 
 
CHURCH: Michael Genovese, many thanks for joining us. I appreciate it. 
 
GENOVESE: Thank you, Rosemary. 
 
CHURCH: U.S. health officials may be updating COVID-19 guidelines soon, and it could affect how long people isolate themselves when they have the virus. Details after a short break. 
 
Plus, Indonesian authorities are counting votes right now in the world's biggest single-day election. We'll explain what's at stake. That's next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
CHURCH: Welcome back, everyone. Officials in Austin, Texas say a car crashed into a hospital emergency room Tuesday evening, killing the driver and injuring at least five others, some of them critically. 
 
Video shows people running to escape the danger. Smoke filled the building as the vehicle's tires continue to spin and screech. Austin police say the incident does not appear to be an intentional act and there's no threat to the general public. 
 <br>[03:19:56] The powerful northeaster blanketed parts of northern United States in snow Tuesday. It was New York's snowiest day in two years, with more than eight centimeters falling in Central Park. Other areas around the city saw even more buildup. 
 
Thousands of customers in Connecticut, New Jersey and beyond lost power, and schools in multiple states cancelled classes due to the snow. Conditions made travel difficult as well, with more than 250 car accidents reported in New Jersey according to the state's governor, and more than 1,000 flights canceled across the U.S. with the majority out of airports in New York, Boston, and New Jersey, according to FlightAware. 
 
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may change its guidance for people with COVID-19 this spring. According to the Washington Post, the potential new guidelines would not require people to isolate if they have mild symptoms and no fever for 24 hours. 
 
CNN health reporter Jacqueline Howard has details. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JACQUELINE HOWARD, CNN HEALTH REPORTER: We're hearing that the CDC's COVID-19 isolation guidance could be updated this spring to focus more so on a patient's symptoms rather than giving a blanket recommendation to isolate for a certain number of days. 
 
Now, currently, if you test positive for COVID-19, the CDC recommends to isolate for at least five days. But we're hearing the agency may loosen that recommendation to be that if you haven't had a fever for at least 24 hours without the help of medication and your symptoms are generally mild or they're improving, then you don't have to isolate. 
 
Now these are just discussions that are happening as we're now living in a world where there is some community immunity. But the head of the CDC says right now, quote, "there are no updates to COVID guidelines to announce at this time." End quote. 
 
If this shift in guidance does happen, it would align with what some states like California and Oregon already recommend on a local level, and it would align with what is already recommended for people who have other types of respiratory illnesses like the flu or RSV. So this will be interesting to watch in the coming months. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHURCH: CNN's Jacqueline Howard with that report. 
 
Right now, votes are being counted in Indonesia where more than 200 million people are eligible to vote. They cast their ballots today to elect a new president and more than 20,000 national and provincial lawmakers. 
 
Candidates had been targeting the youth vote since officials say half of registered voters there are under 40. The top presidential candidates include the current defense minister and two former governors. 
 
And CNN's Anna Coren joins me now live from Hong Kong with more on this. Good to see you, Anna. 
 
So, what's the latest on the vote count and of course the likely outcome? 
 
ANNA COREN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Rosemary, unofficial results are starting to come in. It's this quick count and by all reports an overwhelming majority of those votes are going to Prabowo Subianto. A short time ago 23 percent of the votes had been counted, almost 60 percent going to Prabowo.
 
Now he is a former general under the Suharto dictatorship. He's been accused of human rights abuses and at one point wasn't allowed to enter the United States or Australia. And he ran in the past two elections, Rosemary, and lost to President Joko Widodo and then falsely claimed that the vote had been stolen. Well, perhaps third time is the charm. 
 
Prabowo has had an image makeover, thanks in part to a slick P.R. and social media campaign. But perhaps just as important, and maybe more importantly, his perceived transformation is due to the endorsement by the very popular President Jakowi, whose elder son is Prabowo's running mate. 
 
Now, Jakowi has had a two-term limit. He cannot run again. And look, if Prabowo wins 50 percent of the vote, which if we go off this quick count, it's saying he's won almost 60 percent. He will be the next president of Indonesia. 
 
His rivals, Anies Baswedan, the former governor of Jakarta, and Ganjar Pranowo, the former governor of central Java. We're yet to hear from any of these candidates. 
 
But look, the main issue of this election, Rosemary, this is the third largest democracy in the world, is economy, jobs, education, and eradicating corruption. Why don't we take a listen to some of today's voters? 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNKNOWN (through translator): I hope the elected president keeps the people's trust in this nation and they should be fair and honest.
 <br>[03:24:56] 
 
UNKNOWN (through translator): I hope whoever is elected president can make their political promises a reality, because for us young generation especially, we're hoping for an Indonesia to be developed into a golden Indonesia in 2045. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COREN: Rosemary, half of Indonesia's voters are under the age of 40. So it's a very young electorate. Now conducting this election was a colossal and massive task. It is one of the world's most complex single-day elections in the world. 
 
Indonesia, an archipelago, there were 7,000 islands inhabited. Officials had to go on horseback, helicopter, boat, even trekking to some of these places to deliver ballots. But according to the quick count, Rosemary, would look like Prabowo Subianto could be Indonesia's next president.
 
CHURCH: All right, I know you'll keep a close eye on that. Anna Coren joining us live from Hong Kong. Many thanks. 
 
Still to come, no breakthrough yet in negotiations to secure the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza, but their families have a message for the Israeli negotiators. Details just ahead. 
 
Plus, after Donald Trump's comments encouraging a Russian attack on NATO members, Europe is looking to secure its own weapons supply chain in case it can't depend on the U.S. in the future. Back with that and more in just a moment.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
CHURCH: Back to one of our top stories this hour. A U.S. official says talks in Cairo aimed at freeing the remaining hostages in Gaza and pausing the fighting there were productive and serious on Tuesday, but still no breakthrough and the negotiations will continue. 
 <br>[03:30:55]
 
An Israeli official said their delegation was on its way back from Cairo, but the families of those hostages are urging them to stay until a deal gets done, saying, quote, "do not return until everyone comes home, the living and the dead." Ruby Chen is the father of Itay Chen, an IDF soldier missing in Gaza. He joins me now from Tel Aviv. Thank you so much for being with us at this difficult time. And you and I spoke at the start of this nightmare for your family. Now these hostage negotiations in Cairo are entering this critical stage. How are you feeling about those negotiations right now? 
 
RUBY CHEN, FATHER OF ITAY CHEN, IDF SOLDIER MISSING IN GAZA:  Yeah, first I didn't think we would have the opportunity to speak 131 days after. It's inhuman, the ordeal that we the families need to go through. And reiterating the statement that you just said, we the families believe that they need to stay together, the sides, discuss, negotiate with the support of the United States, Qatar and Egypt and get a deal done. 
 
The fact that the hostages are in danger for such a long time with no sign of life, no medical attention, which is against any international law, is something that we do not think should continue one day longer. 
 
CHURCH:  And these hostage negotiations come ahead of a planned Israeli ground assault in Rafah in the south where it's believed the hostages may very well be held. What are your thoughts on that imminent military offensive?
 
CHEN:  So, I'm not, you know, at a position to be able to comment on it because I do not have full information on that. I'm a civilian. I'm a dad. I'm a U.S. citizen. But what I can say, I think, is the people of Israel are united is that behind the fact that Israel and the IDF will not stop until all of the hostages are back home. And the way to stop this fighting is for Hamas to find a way to release the hostages and the killing from both sides could stop. 
 
CHURCH:  And what do you see as the main hurdle in those negotiations at this juncture? 
 
CHEN:  I still think the lack of faith between the sides is still an obstacle where I think the parties involved, the negotiators, the facilitators, the U.S., Egypt, Qatar, need to be able to provide the guarantees that each side feels comfortable in moving to the next stage. We have been talking, as well as I -- I've been to Doha talking to the Prime Minister, thanking him for his efforts, but there must be more to be done in order to get to a stage that we could get to a ceasefire and get the hostages out. 
 
CHURCH:  And what do you think is the next stage of this? 
 
CHEN:  Being able to hug my kid back, that's the next stage. Keep the eye on the ball, nothing else. 
 
CHURCH:  And what have you learned about your son's condition now more than 130 days in captivity? 
 
CHEN:  Unfortunately, basically nothing much. And that again, looking at the international law, the Red Cross has a permanent mandate from the international community to be able to visit hostages in areas of conflict and receive medical attention. That has not happened. And that is against any protocol that we know of the civilized nations that have signed on to that agreement. 
 
And we would expect with the intervention of the international community to convey to Hamas that this is unacceptable. This is a red line that you crossed, and without supplying proof of life, medical attention, then there should be consequences associated with that. As we are speaking in the Hague, there is a session with the international prosecutor to prosecute Hamas for crimes of war that they have done, including not enabling hostages to receive medical attention. 
 
And I urge the international community to get behind these claims that are against any type of international law and explain to Hamas, signal to Hamas this is a red line. 
 <br>[03:35:02]
 
This is unacceptable to be part of the family of nations going forward. You need to be abiding to international law. 
 
CHURCH:  Ruby Chen, joining us from Tel Aviv. Thank you so much for talking with us, and we wish a speedy return of your son and all the hostages there in Gaza. Many thanks for talking with us. 
 
CHEN:  Thank you. CHURCH:  U.S. President Joe Biden is urging House lawmakers to
 
 immediately hold a vote on the $95 billion foreign aid package that the Senate passed on Tuesday. It would provide desperately needed assistance for Ukraine in its defense against Russia. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  For Republicans in Congress who think they can oppose funding for Ukraine and not be held accountable, history is watching. History is watching. History is watching. Failure to support Ukraine at this critical moment will never be forgotten. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH:  The bulk of the funding, $60 billion, would go to Ukraine, and there's about $14 billion in there for Israel. The rest would go to Indo-Pacific partners and humanitarian aid for civilians in Gaza.
 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is welcoming the passage of a $95 billion aid package by the U.S. Senate. Not all of the money would go to Ukraine as we just explained. Some of it is for Israel's military and other funding is for humanitarian assistance in Gaza and the West Bank. The bill still has to pass the House where it's not clear if Speaker Mike Johnson will even take it to the floor for a vote. Zelensky is urging U.S. lawmakers to do the right thing. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translation):  I thank each of the 70 senators who voted in the affirmative. Ukraine appreciates it very much. This was the first step. Next step is the House of Representatives and the vote of the congressman there. We expect a positive decision. We hope for our principled support. And we believe that America will continue to be a leader. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH:  And it's not just Kyiv waiting nervously to see whether the U.S. will provide more arms and ammunition. Other European leaders are watching too thanks to a gridlock in Congress over an aid bill and controversial words by former U.S. President Donald Trump, they are making plans in the event they may not be able to rely on steadfast U.S. support in the future. 
 
Now, Germany is ramping up its own production of arms for Ukraine and for Europe's protection. Fred Pleitgen reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over):  A German-made Leopard 2 tank hitting Russian positions on the eastern front. This video provided by the 21st Mechanized Brigade showing, they say, how effective Western weapons are on the battlefield. VEDMIN (through translation), TANK COMMANDER, UKRAINIAN ARMED FORCES:
 
 Every infantry is scared of a tank. Tanks go out and work and they fire frightfully. They fire straight into their faces and they don't even have time to think about what to do. 
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over):  The Ukrainians say they need a lot more Western arms and ammo. But Republicans have blocked U.S. military aid in Congress and their likely nominee for president, Donald Trump, even suggested he might encourage Russia to attack NATO members who didn't meet military spending guidelines. 
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  I would not protect you. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want. You got to pay.
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over):  But those comments literally have Europeans up in arms, now ramping up weapons production for Ukraine and for themselves. Germany's Chancellor visiting a major arms plant with Denmark's Prime Minister, trying to downplay Trump's comments. 
 
OLAF SCHOLZ, CHANCELLOR OF GERMANY:  NATO is of essence for the United States, for Canada, for the European countries, and we cooperated so long since World War II and this is really something which is a good alliance for the future. We stick to it and the President of the United States sticks to it, and I'm sure the American people will do so.
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over):  But Denmark's Prime Minister says she has no illusions. U.S. support for European NATO members no longer seems certain. 
 
METTE FREDERIKSEN, PRIME MINISTER OF DENMARK:  No matter what will happen in U.S. in this year, I think the conclusion has to be written already now that Europe needs to be stronger and we need to be able to do more on our own. 
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over):  And ammo production is the biggest concern as NATO allies struggle to help Ukraine make up for massive shortfalls, while facing overwhelming Russian firepower. 
 
(On camera):  This is one of the most important things for the Ukrainians to stay in the fight. They're not only outmanned, they're also outgunned. And the biggest problem they have is a lack of ammunition. 
 <br>[03:39:57]
 
(Voice-over):  They broke ground for a new ammo plant here, and the company's CEO says they will drastically increase ammo production quickly, especially for artillery. 
 
ARMIN PAPPERGER, CEO, RHEINMETALL:  They need one million to 1.2 million, and if I give them 700,000, I think there are also some other producers in Europe who have to give them something. So, 700,000 is at the moment the maximum that we can produce. PLEITGEN (voice-over):  And the Ukrainians say they need the maximum
 
 their allies can give with or without the U.S. to keep their forces in the fight against the Russians. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Unterluss, Germany.

CHURCH:  Just ahead, word of a coalition government in Pakistan about (ph) supporters of former Prime Minister Imran Khan will not be pleased. We'll explain.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHURCH:  Welcome back everyone. The mother-in-law of the woman who opened fire in a Texas mega church on Sunday is speaking out about the shooter's mental illness. She says her daughter-in-law should never have had access to firearms. Ed Lavandera has the latest. 
 
ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  The mother-in- law of the 36-year-old woman who opened fire on the Lakewood mega church here in Houston says this event was a completely preventable horror. Police say 36-year-old Genesee Moreno showed up here on Sunday, opened fire, and that's where two off-duty officers shot and killed her just after she unleashed a barrage of gunfire inside the church. 
 
The mother-in-law of Genesee Moreno details an extensive list of mental health issues and efforts that the family underwent for several years trying to get her help. In a Facebook post, the mother-in-law says that Moreno suffered from a form of schizophrenia that caused her to be violent. Investigators here have been saying that they also have an extensive history of mental health issues. 
 
But despite all of that, what frustrates the mother-in-law, according to her Facebook post, is that she was legally able to obtain the weapons used in all of this.

The investigators also say that they had found anti-Semitic writings that belonged to Moreno, but the mother-in-law says that she believes, who -- the mother-in-law is Jewish, but she does not believe that that hate aspect of this is what is essential and what caused this horror at the Lakewood Church in Houston. 
 
She believes that this is much more an issue with Genesee Moreno's mental health issues that she struggled with for years. And also, her son, as far as we know, the seven-year-old son who was shot in the head remains in critical condition. Ed Lavandera, CNN, Houston. 
 
CHURCH:  Two of Pakistan's major political parties say they are forming a coalition government after no clear winner emerged from last week's election. Not included in the power sharing deal, the party of former Prime Minister Imran Khan. Even though candidates affiliated with his PTI party gained the most votes. Khan, who is in jail, warned against creating a government with what he called stolen votes. Amid this deeply polarized political environment, the country is struggling to recover from an economic crisis and grappling with rising militant violence. CNN's Sophia Saifi is following this story. She joins us now live from Islamabad. So, Sophia, what is the latest on this and what comes next? 
 
SOPHIA SAIFI, CNN PRODUCER:  Rosemary, I mean, what we do know is that Imran Khan released a statement yesterday announcing that he would not be part of any coalition with the PPP and the PMLN, the two parties who, in fact, last night announced that they would be forming a coalition with four other major parties in the country. 
 
So, at the same time, Khan's party has also accused the Election Commission of Pakistan of widespread rigging. They said that there's been manipulation in these polls. And Khan has in fact said that any coalition of this sort announced last night is daylight robbery of the people's mandate. So, there are concerns of protest. There are also concerns that this could spiral into something further. 
 
But the fact is, is that according to the Election Commission of Pakistan, none of the parties have received a majority. And for that, a coalition does need to be formed. And keeping that in mind, Shehbaz Sharif, the former prime minister of Pakistan, the most recent prime minister of Pakistan, was the one who has been announced as the main candidate to be PM in the next parliament as well. 
 
And the other major parties of the country, aside from the PTI, have announced that they will be backing him. So again, rising inflation, an IMF deal that needs to be wrapped up as well, increased militancy in the country. So, we'll have to wait and see if this rage amongst Khan supporters regarding what they claim is a stolen mandate is going to be something that unfolds further in the country. Rosemary? 
 
CHURCH:  Sophia Saifi, joining us live from Islamabad with that report. Appreciate it. 
 
Well, still to come, it's been a week since an oil spill in Trinidad and Tobago and authorities still have no idea who's responsible. What we know about the investigation so far, when we return.

CHURCH:  Crews from Trinidad and Tobago are working to clean up an oil spill that has affected much of the island nation's beaches. It's been a week since an overturned ship was discovered leaking oil into the ocean and surrounding area, in what Trinidad and Tobago's Prime Minister has classified as a national emergency. CNN's Max Foster joins me now live from London. Good to see you, Max. So, we've been reporting on this for a few days now, but many of the details remain a mystery. What more can you tell us? 
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, all we know is this ship turned up, overturned, and then we see these images of the oil washing up on beaches and causing this national crisis, a huge cleanup operation currently underway there. And the government says it is now under control. But I think what we're seeing is this ongoing conversation because there's a huge amount of questions around the mystery of this boat. 
 
So, the government doesn't know who it belongs to, no idea where it came from. The prime minister says they don't even know exactly what it contains. Some sort of hydrocarbon is all we're being told. And then no suggestion that there was any life on board when it overturned. There were no distress signals. So now we're in this situation where there's all sort of speculation bubbling up around, you know, what this ship was doing, who it belonged to and why we're not hearing more about it. 
 
So, it's gone into the realms of a bit conspiracy theory, but I think, you know, the facts are pretty limited, but as far as we're aware, the government feels quite comfortable about it being under control. 
 
CHURCH:  Yeah, and of course, you look at the environmental ramifications, and it's got people talking, I guess it's because of the fact that there's so few answers here. 
 
FOSTER:  I think that's the issue with this particular story, obviously very difficult for us to cover as well, because we're just reporting on the facts. Why did (inaudible) just suddenly turn up like this? And a suggestion that the media isn't covering it enough, although as you say, we've been covering it quite widely. 
 
When there is a lack of information, people do come up with all sorts of various theories and why there might be some sort of cover-up. But as far as we're aware, no cover-up, it's just a tragedy and they're trying to get to the bottom of it. 
 
CHURCH:  Yeah, absolutely. It's just that those images are just heartbreaking, aren't they? Max Foster, joining us live from London. Many thanks. We'll see you in just a moment. 
 
Well, they say money can't buy love, but at least on Valentine's Day a whole lot of people are still trying. A survey from the U.S. National Retail Federation finds Americans plan to spend just over $14 billion on their spouse or significant other this Valentine's Day. That is a record high. Much of that spending will come from those in their 20s and 30s. 
 
Candy tops the list for Valentine's gifts followed by greeting cards, flowers, an evening out, and jewelry.

And also on this Valentine's Day, you can show your ex-boyfriend or girlfriend just how much you care about them and help control the feral cat population at the same time because a New Jersey animal shelter is offering to, quote, "neuter" your ex, and here's how. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KEN SKIERANSKI, EXEXUTIVE DIRECTOR, HOMEWARD BOUNDPET ADOPTION CENTER: For a $50 donation, really anyone can send in the name of one of their exes. And what we'll do is we'll name a community cat after that person, first names or nicknames only. And then that community cat will be spayed or neutered, vaccinated, ear tipped, and then released back out to the community.

CHURCH:  And thanks to that promotion, there are a whole bunch of four-legged Jeff's, Mike's, Ian's and Tyler's roaming the streets of New Jersey. There's even a cat named Gaslight Guy out there. The idea has been so popular, it's now being extended beyond Valentine's Day. And thank you so much for your company. I'm Rosemary Church. Have yourselves a wonderful Valentine's Day if you're marking it today. "CNN Newsroom" continues next with Max Foster and Bianca Nobilo.
