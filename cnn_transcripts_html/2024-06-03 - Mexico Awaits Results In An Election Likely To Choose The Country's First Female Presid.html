MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN ANCHOR: Hello and welcome, everyone. I'm Michael Holmes. Appreciate your company, coming up here on CNN Newsroom. The results from Mexico's presidential election or do at any moment we will be going live to Mexico City for a report as the country is poised to elect its first woman president. 
 
Relief at least for a while for South Korea is North Korea says it will stop sending trash balloons across the border. And why Japan is investing in this brand new wailing mothership.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Live from Atlanta. This is CNN Newsroom with Michael Holmes.
 
HOLMES: As Mexico awaits the official results from what should be and historic election the country's two main political parties are already claiming victory. Voters are set to elect their first female president and a top contender is former Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum, a protege of the outgoing president while her rivals Xochitl Galvez is supported by a coalition of opposition parties. 
 
This race part of the largest set of elections in the nation's history with more than 20,000 positions on the ballot nationwide. There have been disruptions, long lines and delays plagued some polling stations, while authorities say voting was suspended in one town because of violence there. 
 
This has been a bloody political cycle, one marred by multiple assassinations and violence. One local candidate was killed just hours before voting began. 
 
CNN's Gustavo Valdes joins me now live from Mexico City. Good to see you again, Gustavo. We were expecting results about 30 minutes ago or a pointer tell us more about what we know so far, and what it all means for Mexico. GUSTAVO VALDES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: We don't know what it really means Michael because without any explanation, the elections officials decided to postpone that press conference in which we are expecting the results. The initial, very initial preliminary small percentage of the vote counted, give Claudia Sheinbaum, an advantage and our colleagues in Herrick headquarters are showing that they are getting ready for a celebration. 
 
Thousands of them are already in Mexico. Sokola, which is the main square here in Mexico City. But there's nothing official. Earlier on the head of the party Morena came out and he claimed that they had won not only the presidency, but also the eight governorships that were in play, but also Xochitl Galvez, the opposition Galvez came out and she didn't quite claim victory. But she said that they had won because of how well they performed all over the country. So we have to wait. 
 
Either way, it seems like Mexico will have its first female president. This is a historic moment, voters we talked to said that even though that wasn't the main reason for them to come and vote. They were proud that their country would somehow also change that image of being macho country that women are finding their place in politics. And they were very excited because of that. 
 
HOLMES: Yes, I want to I want you to tell me more about, you know, I've been watching you speak to voters over the last few days. Tell us more about what they've told you about what they want from their new government.
 
VALDES: What they really want is safety. Mexico is one of the most dangerous in the world. We've seen in this political cycle. About 200 people were killed. 30 of those were candidates, one of them was assassinated just overnight that in southern Mexico. So violence, it's one of the main issues they have in mind, which actually begs the question, because many of them think that the policies of Lopez Obrador, which has been a hands off approach, that actively using the army or the police forces to go after cartel members, that many thing is part of the problem with violence. And Sheinbaum has promised to continue his policies. 
 
You know, there's a little bit of disconnect on the security issue and the vote if she is indeed declared the winner, but maybe they saw something else on what's happening in Mexico in the past six years. They didn't want to go back to the traditional parties. We saw the power Morena has amassed in this past six years to the point that they'd have to form this coalition behind Xochitl Galvez.
 <br>[01:05:07]
 
So you know, Mexico is it's in a different path that he was just 10 years ago. So it's going to be very interesting to see what happens, especially when it comes to the relationship with the United States. They've had the Biden administration and the Lopez Obrador government have had a working relationship. Some in government in Mexico, have said that, you know, maybe behind the scenes, they have not seen an active role in Mexico going after the cartels, but they have been an important partner trying to stop migration into the United States. So everything is in play in the next hopefully minutes, we'll find out what the future of Mexico will hold.
 
HOLMES: All right. Great to have you there, Gustavo. Gustavo Valdes in Mexico City for us. 
 
Now, Will Freeman is joining us from Mexico City. He's a Fellow for Latin American Studies with the Council on Foreign Relations. It's good to have you there. So, we don't know but Claudia Sheinbaum is considered likely to win. Her opponent Xochitl Galvez has said that Sheinbaum is not your fan AMLO protege, she's his puppet.
 
Do you think AMLO is going to have a hand influence when it comes to policymaking if Sheinbaum indeed wins? WILL FREEMAN, LATIN AMERICAN STUDIES FELLOW, COUNCIL ON FOREIGN
 
 RELATIONS: Look, AMLO said many times that he will retire to his ranch in southern Mexico and effectively stepped out of politics. Now I think there's a lot of people in Mexico who are rightly skeptical of that. This is a man who ran for president three times, spent decades trying to make it into the pinnacle of power in Mexico, and who now commands by far the country's most powerful political party. So it's hard to see him stepping away entirely. 
 
Now part B to that is will he be able to control the political party in the next government? There, I think things get much harder for him. Typically, when presidents leave office in Mexico, they lose power fast. And they're -- his faction is just one of several within the governing party, which will all be vying for power. 
 
HOLMES: Yes, good point. Good, good context. So what does the winner inherit? If people are in poverty declined under AMLO, the minimum wage went up in real terms, but in recent years, Mexico's growth around it to just about 2 percent a year that's well below other developing economies. You've got the crime wave, you've got water shortages, crumbling infrastructure, how long is the to do list? And what are the most urgent agenda items?
 
FREEMAN: Well, as you point out, it's quite long. I'm low took office under very challenging circumstances as well. But so does Claudia Sheinbaum, assuming that she does hold her current lead. And when I say number one, the biggest challenge patient in the country does come from organized crime, the expanding territorial control of cartels and gangs, that'll be something that Sheinbaum will need to make progress on early if the state isn't going to lose control of additional parts of its territory. 
 
Second, I think she'll have to deal with a rising budget deficit, a sort of a fiscal hangover from the final year of Lopez Obrador's government in which he spent big and third, she has to confront as you mentioned, these long term issues, migration, climate change.
 
HOLMES: Yes. An important question that I know you think is important, too, is the seats in the legislature as well. It's not just the presidency. It's how many seats are one? What's at stake with who gets how many?
 
FREEMAN: Exactly. It's a huge question. If anything, it's the biggest unknown going into today. Now, look, pollster has predicted that Claudia Sheinbaum held the type of lead she holds right now in the preliminary results, that's almost 30 points, that she has a fighting chance of getting two-thirds majorities in the Congress and Senate. 
 
If she can pull that off, she has enough seats to make big constitutional changes. Lopez Obrador has been pushing for a controversial reform, which would effectively see the Supreme Court elected by popular vote instead of selected through a non-electoral process. 
 
So, we'll see if Claudia Sheinbaum wants to make good on that promise to push through with that. If she does, it could scare investors, but it could also really deliver for her base, many of whom seem to want that.
 
HOLMES: It's hard to it's hard to get your head around the issue of security cartels, as you pointed out, but also organized crime. I think, and correct me if I'm wrong, I think there's been 180,000 murders in Mexico during AMLO's time in office. That is just mind blowing. And that doesn't include 100,000 missing persons, conviction rates are terrible. I suppose a lot of voters want to ask the next question. What are you going to do about all of that?
 
FREEMAN: I mean, it looked stunning that the governing party could win reelection and by a landslide, as it seems, given the conditions you're talking about given the sweeping violence. The thing is the opposition didn't seem to put together a much more credible set of proposals about what they would do.
 <br>[01:10:03]
 
What scares me the most is that it could be that no political figure in Mexico has a viable plan to reclaim security to rebuild the state's control over all of its national territory. Now, I do think Claudia Sheinbaum comes with a team from her time as Mexico City mayor that has proven effective in certain ways on security on improving security in this city. 
 
So we'll see if she's able to replicate that across the country. But again, we're talking about a massive, complicated, very regionally diverse country in which it'll be pretty hard for even the best equipped person to begin to reclaim some control.
 
HOLMES: One of the things when it comes to crime and cartels, and that is the involvement of the military you in March, you wrote about the impact the influence of Mexico's armed forces in politics, I think you described Mexico's new normal as, quote, a civilian government that is chronically dependent on the military. How do you see that aspect of olding under a new non AMLO administration, even if it is his party?
 
FREEMAN: To be honest, it's a bit of a wildcard. Now, Claudia Sheinbaum comes from a very different part of the Mexican left than Lopez Obrador. She was a student leader in the 1980s and 90s. She comes from a part of the left that's tended to be much more critical and skeptical of the military. 
 
Now, so far, she's basically copied AMLO's proposals. You know, I have to to the word on this, saying that she will keep the military in important roles in public security, but she's given one or two signals here and there, that perhaps she will rethink this. 
 
So, I think we need to see we need to give her some time, see what happens. But I think we should all be watching just the military continue to get new revenue streams, more protection from prosecution, an ever bigger hand in steering policy, or is it somewhat reined in to, you know, a more appropriate set of rules for a military and democracy
 
HOLMES: And important aspect. It's great to have your analysis. Will Freeman of the Council on Foreign Relations there in Mexico City. Really appreciate it. Thanks.
 
WILL FREEMAN: Thank you so much for having me.
 
HOLMES: Ukraine's President is continuing his Asia Pacific trip with a visit to the Philippines on Sunday Volodymyr Zelenskyy, wrapping up his surprise meeting at the Shangri-La dialogue security conference in Singapore, where he met with that country's president and prime minister.
 
Mr. Zelenksyy  making personal appeals to leaders in the region to join the upcoming Ukraine peace conference in Switzerland. Mr. Zelenskyy also met with the U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in Singapore. He thanked the U.S. for giving limited permission to fire U.S. weapons into Russian territory, but says Washington needs to lift more restraints so Ukraine can properly defend itself. 
 
CNN national security correspondent Natasha Bertrand has been throughout this important meeting joins me now from Singapore. Natasha, Mr. Zelenskyy grateful for that U.S. permission those limited strikes, not entirely happy with the limitations that still exists. 
 
Bring us up to date on what was an important visit for the Ukrainian leader. He met with the U.S. Defense Secretary but not the Chinese.
 
NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Michael. So he had a meeting yesterday with Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, and they discussed Ukraine's evolving battlefield needs including their need for additional air defense systems. And according to officials, that meeting went very well, particularly because of course, Zelenskyy is quite pleased with the U.S. decision to finally allow them to use us made weapons to strike inside Russian territory, just across the border from Kharkiv in Ukraine. 
 
And of course, as you said, Zelenskyy says that that does not necessarily go far enough. And the bottom line and the message that he was trying to send to the U.S. and to allies across the region and the international community is that they should not be afraid of the Russians and that the only way to defeat Putin is through strength and not weakness. 
 
Now, Secretary of Defense Austin, he did speak about this a little bit earlier today during a press conference. And he was asked about what impact he believes that the U.S. decision to allow Ukraine to strike into Russia with U.S. made weapons will actually have on Ukraine's, you know, success against the Russians and pushing them out. And he said that he does believe that it is going to have an impact. And it's going to help Ukraine defend themselves. 
 
But he reiterated the U.S. position that the U.S. is not going to allow Ukraine to use those long range weapons, those attacking systems that the U.S. has provided to Ukraine to strike deep into Russian territory. So for now, this policy is really constrained to just that border area, so that Ukraine can defend itself against those strikes coming right across the border from Russia there. 
 
But as you said he also tried to meet Zelenskyy did with Chinese officials while he was here in Singapore, and he was unsuccessful, but the reason that he wanted so badly to meet with the Chinese was to try to get them to attend a peace summit that Ukraine is set to hold in the next two weeks in Singapore. 
 <br>[01:15:00]
 
But he said that The Chinese would not meet with him and in fact that the Chinese have been working with the Russians to undermine support for that peace summit for which over 106 countries he said have now confirmed that they are going to attend. 
 
China is also of course, according to the U.S. supporting the Russian military by selling them and by providing them with dual use technological items that they can use to bolster their military and so Zelenskyy had a lot to say to the Chinese, but unfortunately, it seemed as though the Chinese were not willing to sit down and meet with him at this moment, but he did get to meet with many other Asian leaders here, as you tried to of course expand that international coalition to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia, Michael.
 
HOLMES: Great having you there covering it for us. Natasha Bertrand in Singapore. Thanks so much.
 
And the U.S. Secretary of State spoke with two Israeli ministers on Sunday Antony Blinken assuring Yoav Gallant and Benny Gantz that the Israeli peace proposal announced by U.S. President Joe Biden booed, quote, advance Israel's long term security interest. Here's more from the U.S. national security spokesperson.
 
(EGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOHN KIRBY, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL SECURITY COMMUNICATIOSN ADVISER: Where we are right now is that proposal and Israeli proposal has been given to Hamas. It was done on Thursday night, our time. We're waiting for an official response from Hamas. We would note that publicly, Hamas officials came out and welcomed this proposal. We have every expectation that if Hamas agrees to the proposal, as was transmitted to them and Israeli proposal that Israel would say yes.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HOLMES: Meanwhile, families of hostages held in Gaza gathered outside Benjamin Netanyahu's office putting pressure on the Israeli prime minister to accept the new proposal and bring their loved ones home. 
 
Elliott Gotkine going now breaks down the proposal and explains how it's been received.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ELLIOTT GOTKINE, JOURNALIST: After President Biden conveyed Israel's ceasefire proposal to the world and then followed up with a helpful graphic in a tweet, there were inevitable reactions from across the political spectrum. In Israel, first and foremost from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he took the rare step of issuing a press statement on the Jewish Sabbath on Saturday, in which he said that Israel would never agree to a cessation of hostilities, something that comes in phase two of the three-phase ceasefire proposal until such time as Israel's war objectives have been met. 
 
He said that unless Israel's conditions for cessation of hostilities were met, it would not agree to a ceasefire. Now, these conditions are number one, to destroy Hamas' military and governance capabilities, number two, to get all the hostages who were abducted by Hamas on October the seventh back into Israel, and number three, to ensure that the Gaza Strip no longer poses a threat to Israel. 
 
So I think what Netanyahu was trying to do was to clarify that the ceasefire proposal that he himself would have signed off on as part of Israel's war cabinet does not preclude Israel from meeting those war objectives. So the ball as far as the ceasefire proposal for now is in Hamas' caught. 
 
I think at the same time, Netanyahu was trying to preempt the inevitable blowback against the ceasefire proposal from the far right, members of his governing coalition. Those reaction blowback duly came at the end of the Jewish Sabbath, when they said that this proposal seemed like to them a capitulation to Hamas, it would be a defeat for Israel, it'd be a reckless deal. And if it goes ahead, they would pull their parties out of the governing coalition. 
 
Now, if they were to make good on that threat, that would likely lead to the collapse of Netanyahu's government, it would lead to fresh elections, which opinion polls suggest Netanyahu would lose so no doubt that is something else that is playing on his mind. 
 
At the same time over the weekend, Netanyahu said he was thrilled to be invited to speak to Congress by the top thought leaders, Democrat and Republicans of Congress on a date in the future. He said that he will convey the justness of Israel's causing his war against terrorism and its war against Hamas, which the U.S. designates as a terrorist organization, I suppose to also bring on board any wavering lawmakers, particularly Democrats who may be feeling that Israel, for example, is not using U.S. weapons shipments as it ought to. 
 
At the same time, I think, Netanyahu is happy to be doing this because by being on the world stage speaking to U.S. lawmakers, he can once again portray himself to the Israeli public as the only man who can lead Israel on the international stage that he has the ear of U.S. lawmakers and the White House. And at the same time, he's the only man that can both maintain the Israel us relationship and stand up to the United States. When it's not in Israel's interests. Elliott Gotkine, CNN, Tel Aviv.

HOLMES: Earlier I spoke with Shaina Low, communication adviser with the Norwegian Refugee Council and asked her how the closing of the Rafah crossing is impacting a delivery in Gaza.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SHAINA LOW, COMMUNICATION ADVISER, NORWEIGIAN REFUGEE COUNCIL: Well, since May 6, eight operations in the Rafah area and throughout Gaza have really suffered we already were facing considerable challenges.
 <br>[01:20:00]
 
But since the Rafah operation began and the first evacuation orders were issued it's been incredibly difficult. The Norwegian Refugee Council where I work has not receive any new shipments of aid since May 3rd.
 
So we're basically at the end of what we've been able to stockpile in terms of distributing. Meanwhile, thousands and thousands of people are continuing to be displaced, with little aid to support them once they reach new locations.
 
HOLMES: Yes. I think the number of trucks getting into Gaza in the last few days has hovered around 58 or so, that's down from around 175 before Israel's Rafah offensive, and for context, Gaza was getting north of 500 trucks a day before this conflict. That is an incredible, unimaginable deficit, it must be literally costing lives surely.
 
LOW: Absolutely. And you have to remember that when those 500 trucks per day were coming in Gaza had industry inside they were able to grow their own food. There was production -- food production and other production within Gaza. Now that has basically come to a standstill. 
 
What we are seeing day by day is more and more desperation, people are needing more and more assistance, and less and less is getting him so the needs keep on growing. And we're struggling to provide even any type of meaningful assistance under these conditions. 
 
On top of that it's increasingly dangerous and difficult for humanitarians to maneuver. And we're facing shortages of fuel and other supplies that are needed in order to even carry out distributions and provide assistance. We are really working under impossible circumstances and eight operations are basically coming to a halt.
 
HOLMES: Yes, yes, getting the idea is one thing, getting it around is another and that's proving problematic. The level of damage in Gaza defies belief so much has been damaged or completely destroyed. Yesterday, I was speaking with a Gaza journalist and Human Rights worker Maha Hussaini who -- and I asked her if, you know, after the war, if she thought Gaza would even be able to function as a society. What are your thoughts on that? What what's going to be left for
 
 people to return to and have a life in?
 
LOW: You know, it sounds that what I'm hearing from my colleagues in Gaza is that there's very little left already. But people are desperate for this war to end. They're desperate to be able to return to their homes and start rebuilding. Every day my staff is telling me that all they want to do is go home and just start to get their lives back to normal, some degree of normal at least without bombardment. 
 
But this is going to the amount of devastation and destruction will take years to rebuild billions and billions of dollars. And that's nothing to say of the unimaginable trauma that Palestinians have been facing over the last eight months.
 
HOLMES: Yes.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HOLMES: Meantime, New York held its annual Israel Day Parade on Sunday amid heightened security. Officials were concerned about possible violence after recent clashes between protesters and police in the city. New York congressman and families of American hostages held in Gaza called for their released during the parade. One of the organizers says more than 60,000 people showed up and he chanting bring them home now. Others holding signs of support for the new peace proposal. 
 
North Korea says it is suspending its barrage of trash balloons against South Korea but it could be too little too late was sold promising and unendurable response.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[01:25:40]
 
HOLMES: North Korea says it is temporarily halting sending trash filled balloons into South Korea. The South Korean military has reported about 1,000 of the airborne waste deliveries floating into South Korea since last Tuesday, littering parts of the country with things like cigarette butts, paper and pieces of cloth. 
 
In response, a South Korean official said the country will take quote, unendurable measures in the coming days against North Korea whatever that means. For more on this I'm joined by CNN's Mike Valerio in Hong Kong. Good to see again, Mike, these blooms stopped operations at one of the busiest airports in the world. Tell us about it and the general disruption and reaction to what is a bizarre operation.
 
MIKE VALERIO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, you know, Michael, this scale is certainly unprecedented. And since the last time we spoke with you in the last hour, we have new reporting that conveys that North Korea is saying it actually sent 3,500 balloons from the north over the DMZ to the South. The South Korean government is saying it's closer to 1000 balloons, which is still in unbelievable numbers. Some of those balloons though, Michael have crashed, landed into the
 
 DMZ into the Han River that runs through the heart of Seoul. And some have reached Incheon International Airport, not just a tiny regional airport, but an airport that serves this megalopolis, the fourth largest urban area on earth of 26 million people stopping operations not once, but twice yesterday and one of these balloons that you're seeing on the screen, reach the runway landing on the runway on Saturday. 
 
So that brings us to today, the North is saying you know what? We're going to press pause on this operation. And the greater context, Michael, of why this is happening is because for years, groups in the South and the South Korean government as well have sent balloons of their own northbound over the DMZ filled with medicine packets, K dramas on flash drives, K Pop albums, trying to shift perceptions of reality that of course are so skewed by people among people who live in North Korea, but just listen to what life has been like in Seoul over the past few days. Listen.

SONG KWANG-JA, YONGIN CITY RESIDENT (through translator): I had goosebumps. It felt like a child dish. I was surprised to hear about it. 
 
KIM MIN-HEE, YONGIN CITY RESIDENT (through translator): Why are they sending things like this? I'm worried that they might send something dangerous.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VALERIO: OK, so you mentioned before the break and a couple of seconds go unendurable consequences are threatened by the South Korean government if this goes on. We don't Michael really know what unendurable consequences entail. We've tried to get clarity about that over the weekend. But it seems as though this is going to be put on pause for now.
 
Over the past few hours, some of these groups that have sent balloons over the past few years they're saying you know what, we're going to keep going because this response from the North shows that their efforts are working that a taste of reality is landing into homes in North Korea and it has generated this very unusual response. 
 
HOLMES: Yes, I mean, durable sounds a little ominous. Mike Valerio in Hong Kong. Good to see my friend. Thank you. 
 
Now China making history as its Chang'e-6 probe explores the far side of the moon. The craft is spending two days collecting samples from the lunar dark side for the first time ever. Our Marc Stewart with more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MARC STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT: This successful lunar landing is certainly an accomplishment for China on a scientific pride, but it's also a source of patriotism as the nation looks to assert itself as a dominant space power.
 
STEWART (voice-over): The Chang'e-6 space probe touchdown on the far side of the Moon Sunday morning, Beijing time, it landed on the South Pole, an area known as the Aiken Basin. The goal is to collect samples that experts say could provide clues into the origin of the moon, earth and the solar system. 
 <br>[01:29:49]
 
Yet this mission is helping China get data and the technical skills as it looks to propel its ambitions on the moon including a research base. There is no crew on board. Robots are at work. 
 
This is video from May when the Chinese government invited CNN to the space center on Hainan Island to chronicle the launch. It comes at a time when other nations have lunar ambitions, including the United States and India. 
 
China is planning other launches as it maintains its goal of sending astronauts to the moon by 2030.
 
Marc Stewart, CNN -- Beijing.

MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN ANCHOR: Still to come on the program, a seismic shift for South Africa's ANC. The party of Nelson Mandela as lost the parliamentary majority it's held for decades.
 
We'll have that story coming up. 
 
And Donald Trump says he wouldn't mind going to prison. Coming up, why he says that putting him behind bars could be though a breaking point for his supporters.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HOLMES: Welcome back everyone.
 
You're watching CNN NEWSROOM with me Michael Holmes more now on our top story for you.
 
We're expecting official results from Mexico's election any time now and it will be historic with voters set to elect their first female president. The top contenders, a former Mexico city mayor, Claudia Sheinbaum, and her rival Xochitl Galvez. 
 
The race is part of the larger set of elections in Mexico's history, with more than 20,000 positions on the ballot nationwide. 
 
The campaigning though is being marred by assassinations and other political violence all across the country these past few months. 
 
On Sunday, long lines and delays plagued some polling stations as well. South Africa's president celebrated the absence of violence in his
 
 country's election, despite the dire outcome for his African National Congress party. The ANC won just 40 percent of the vote, losing its parliamentary majority for the first time since the end of apartheid.
 
Now, it must form a coalition and if it's going to stay in power.
 
Here's David McKenzie.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Sometimes change comes slowly.
 
CYRIL RAMAPHOSA, SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT: our people have spoken. Whether we like it or not they have spoken.
 
MCKENZIE: Sometimes it comes fast. 
 
In just one election cycle, the ANC, the party of Nelson Mandela, with a staggering drop in support.
 <br>[01:34:49]
 
MCKENZIE: After three decades of dominance, the voters have spoken. The party that has defined South African politics losing its outright majority.
 
TK POOE, WITS SCHOOL OF GOVERNANCE: I think it means that society has passed (INAUDIBLE). We've always been waiting for the moment. We just didn't know the appropriate vehicle. 
 
MCKENZIE: Many South Africans were fed up with rampant corruption, huge unemployment, and deep inequality. But the ANC collapse came in large part thanks to this man, disgraced former ANC president Jacob Zuma. 
 
In just a few months, his new Umkhonto WeSizwe Party or MK bled votes from the ANC, tapping into Zuma's, loyal support in Kwazulu-Natal Province. Zuma and his party have without evidence claimed there were irregularities at the polls, threatening trouble if results were announced. 
 
MELANIE VERWOERD, POLITICAL ANALYST, FORMER ANC MP: Jacob Zuma is different. It is always dangerous to let ethnic and tribal tensions rise too much. I don't foresee it being an issue in the foreseeable future. but it is something that one always needs to watch.
 
MCKENZIE: What to watch for next, coalition politics. The ANC likely must choose to combine with pro-business Democratic Alliance or the leftist radical Economic Freedom Fighters, perhaps even adding Zuma's MK.
 
No one knows for sure.
 
FIKILE MBALULA, ANC SECRETARY GENERAL: We call on all South Africans to resist the efforts of those forces who want to weaken our democracy, who want to undermine our electoral processes, and who wants to disregard the will of the people.
 
JOHN STEENHUISEN, DEMOCRATIC ALLIANCE LEADER: Coalitions can work. They work all over the world. It requires maturity and yes, there are going to be choppy waters ahead for South Africa, but we'll navigate them. 
 
MCKENZIE: Do you want to be part of a governing coalition?
 
STEENHUISEN: Of course, I mean hopefully (ph) being in politics is to get into government.
 
MCKENZIE: The results are deeply embarrassing for President Cyril Ramaphosa he staked his reputation on reviving the ANC. 
 
Is Cyril Ramaphosa under pressure now? 
 
POOE: Oh no. He's beyond under pressure. I think he might need to start looking for a new job. But he always styles himself as the next incumbent to President Nelson Mandela. 
 
But last recollection President Nelson Mandela never lost an election.
 
MCKENZIE: But Ramaphosa is well-known as a skilled negotiator. A skill that will now become very handy indeed.
 
David McKenzie, CNN -- Johannesburg.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The judge could decide to say, hey, house arrest or even jail. 
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It could.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How do you face it?
 
(CROSSTALKING)
 
TRUMP: I'm ok with it. I saw one of my lawyers the other day on television saying, oh, no, you don't want to do that to the president -- I said don't, you know, beg for anything. That's just the way it is. 
 
I don't know that the public would stand it. You know, I don't -- I'm not sure of the public would stand for it. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A house arrest or -- 
 
TRUMP: I think -- I think it WILL be tough for the public to take. You know, at a certain point there's a breaking point.

HOLMES: Trump didn't stop there. When asked if he would seek revenge if he was re-elected, here's what he said.

TRUMP: It's a very interesting question. My revenge will be success. And I mean that, but it's awfully hard when you see what they've done. These people are so evil.

HOLMES: Now the latest Quinnipiac poll, and we have to emphasize it was taken before the hush money verdict, showed U.S. president Joe Biden and Donald Trump in a dead heat. 
 
They're going to face off for the first time in a CNN debate on June 27, two weeks before Trump's sentencing and just days before the Republican National Convention.
 
Meanwhile, President Biden's son's trial on a federal gun charge will begin in the coming hours. Hunter Biden is accused of illegally buying and possessing a gun while abusing or being addicted to drugs. Now that's a felony charge. He has pleaded not guilty, but he's always been open its been about his struggles with alcohol and crack cocaine addiction.
 
The case was brought by a former U.S. attorney appointed by Donald Trump. If convicted Hunter Biden could theoretically face up to 25 years in prison. It is the first time that the child of a sitting U.S. president has gone on trial.
 
Mr. Biden will campaign in Connecticut in the coming hours, the next day he heads to France to attend ceremonies honoring the 80th anniversary of the Normandy invasion in World War II. He is also set to hold talks with the French President Emmanuel Macron.
 
CNN's Priscilla Alvarez with more on that.

PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: President Biden heads to France this week where he will commemorate the 80th anniversary of D-Day and also deliver remarks about freedom and democracy. All of this as the U.S. tries to reassert its leadership on the world stage. 
 
But it also comes at a critical time here at home. President Biden has been preserving democracy, a key theme of his campaign and recently told donors at fundraisers that world leaders have expressed concern to President Biden over his Republican rival, former president Donald Trump, taking a second term. 
 
Now President Biden, while abroad will also meet with the French president. The two are expected to discuss a range of issues including that proposal that was recently laid out by President Biden to reach a ceasefire agreement in Gaza.
 
Now the French president recently said that he supports that agreement and also noted that the war in Gaza must end. So this too, expected to be a topic of discussion between the two leaders.

HOLMES: A Japanese company doubling down on its investment in the controversial whaling industry by building a brand-new vessel. We'll step inside the mothership after the break.
 
Also, running out of cash fast, frustrated with inflation and the cost of goods now, residents of Cuba are having trouble getting their own money from the bank.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HOLMES: Now hunting whales commercially has long been a controversial subject to say the least. But Japan has continued the practice even amid a decline in demand for whale meat.
 
And one Japanese company has now invested millions of dollars to build a massive vessel to re-energize the industry, despite warnings from activists that Japan may be trying to hunt beyond its normal fishing grounds.
 
CNN's Hanako Montgomery joins me now from Tokyo. She's been looking into this.
 
Good to see you Hanako. So why is Japan continuing with whaling despite its declining popularity and the controversy that surrounds the practice?
 
HANAKO MONTGOMERY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes Michael. It's good to see you as well. You know, as you mentioned. Whale meat in in Japan is very unpopular. Consumption is actually at record lows. 
 
But the country is looking to revitalize this industry for really three key reasons. 
 
The first, because Japan says according to its own research, whaling is actually sustainable. Since Japan left the International Whaling Commission in 2019, Japan is limited to hunting whales in its exclusive economic zone. 
 
And Japan says that according to its own findings, to its own research, there's actually an abundance of whales in its territorial waters specifically the say whales, which internationally speaking is classified as endangered and the Bryde's and minke whale. 
 
So because whale numbers are coming back, Japan says that it should be allowed to hunt these mammals. 
 <br>[01:44:48]
 
MONTGOMERY: Now the second reason they have identified is that whaling in Japan has a long and deep cultural significance. It is true that whaling has long been practiced in Japan in specific parts of the country, in specific regions. 
 
But really whale meat only became a national dish after World War II when food resources were scarce. But the Japanese government still says that it has a right to practice this long-standing tradition. 
 
Now the third and final reason, which I found quite interesting was even though Japan recognizes that whale meat is not popular, right now, they think that once they can change public perception in the new future, that whale meat consumption will go up. 
 
I spoke to some industry insiders about how they plan to change this public perception and how they look to boost consumption. 
 
This is what they told me.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MONTGOMERY: Marvels of the deep-blue are to others a meal. Whaling in Japan is poised for a major comeback with the launch of this vessel.
 
This vast, new whaling mothership, the Kangei Maru, cost nearly $50 million to make. And it just goes to show how Japan is not only continuing to hunt whales, but also is trying to revitalize this shrinking industry in a very, very a big way. 
 
We get a tour of the ship led by Hideki Tokoro, the president of Kyodo Senpaku, the whaling company that made it. 
 
He doesn't hide his fondness for whale meat and rejects the idea of changing his business model.
 
HIDEKI TOKORO, PRESIDENT, KYODO SENPAKU: We will not switch to whale watching unless it is eating whale while whale watching, which sounds very chic. 
 
This ship hunts whales in Japan's territorial waters before getting served in the country's supermarkets. 
 
School lunches, food carts, and vending machines. But public appetite for whale meat just 1 percent of its former peak according to government data. It's still far from satisfactory for Tokoro. 
 
And with the launch of this expensive new boat, Tokoro says bills are piling up. But even if the new boat sinks him into bankruptcy Tokoro insists there is no Plan B.
 
Internationally, whaling is criticized as a brutal and unsustainable practice that once pushed many of these mammals to the brink of extinction due to centuries of over hunting. And may still carry environmental consequences today.
 
The things that we're learning about whales is that they're not just consumers in this ecosystem, but by the fact of them consuming so much food, they recycle a ton of nutrients into the environment that actually helps to stimulate plant life growth.
 
MONTGOMERY: But Japan's Fisheries Agency says there's nothing wrong with whaling. They claimed Japan should continue whaling because their research shows it sustainable and whale populations in Japanese waters are increasing allowing them to hunt even endangered species, even as whale meat's declining popularity is a regrettable trend for the agency. 
 
TAKAAKI SAKAMOTO, WHALING AFFAIRS OFFICE: Since we are promoting increased consumption of marine products I think it is unfortunate that consumption is decreasing.
 
MONTGOMERY: Japan's whaling industry attempting to revive its shrinking business, betting on a future that may never materialize.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
MONTGOMERY: Now I also asked the fisheries agency and Kyodo Senpaku about their plants to hunt again in the Southern Ocean, given the fact that this very new ship has the capacity to travel long distances. 
 
And both assured me that there were no plans to hunt in the Antarctic, which of course is home to a very large whale sanctuary. 
 
But given Japan's track record, many activists are still very much concerned and are hesitant to believe them, Michael. 
 
HOLMES: Yes. Yes. I can see the Sea Shepherd in that ship's future if they do go outside.
 
Hanako Montgomery fascinating report, appreciate it there in Tokyo for us.
 
Inflation has dealt a heavy blow to the Cuban peso. Some residents can't afford the cost of milk or eggs and others can't even get their hands on the cash from their own bank accounts.
 
CNN's Patrick Oppmann with more on Cuba's deepening economic crisis.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: In a country of seemingly endless lines these are perhaps the most frustrating. People waiting to get money, their money, at government-run banks. 
 
The lines are long and there's no guarantee that by the time they get to the front, there'll be any cash left. 
 
"We've been here for hours," she says, "and haven't been able to get inside yet. Sometimes you do the line and they don't have enough money." 
 
Despite government attempts to move transactions online cash is still king in Cuba. And there isn't enough of it. 
 <br>[01:49:49]
 
OPPMANN: Many banks limit how much cash people can take out. And the largest bill that the government prints is this one -- 1,000 pesos. At the official rate that's about $40. On the black market it's only worth about $3. Runaway inflation has inflicted further pain on the already ailing Cuban economy.
 
Lately, government run banks no longer allow foreign companies to withdraw dollars or euros either. Saying they simply don't have any on hand. 
 
The Cuban government blames the crisis on the U.S. governments economic sanctions and murky plots, they allege, to make record inflation and shortages even worse. 
 
But Cuban journalists tracking inflation from abroad say much of the country has lost faith in their banking system and currency.
 
"There is no production in Cuba," he says. "Production in the country has collapsed. The country is bankrupt."
 
And Cubans like retiree Nancy complain that even when the peso regains some value against the dollar, the prices stay the same or still go up. 
 
"I don't earn enough each month," she says. I receive 7,000 pesos but a packet of milk is almost 3,000 pesos, a carton of eggs the same price. I'm not getting by at all."
 
Some economists think Cuba needs to devalue its currency officially or adopt the U.S. dollar. But as the island confronts the worst economic crisis in decades, both money and time may be running out. 
 
Patrick Oppmann CNN -- Havana.
