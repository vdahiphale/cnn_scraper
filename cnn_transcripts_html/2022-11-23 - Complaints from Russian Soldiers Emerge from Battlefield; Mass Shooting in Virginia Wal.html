(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BECKY ANDERSON, CNN HOST, CONNECT THE WORLD: I'm Becky Anderson, coming to you from Doha. Hello and welcome back to this special edition of "Connect 
 
 the World" we'll have all the latest updates from the FIFA 2022 World Cup for you in just a moment.
 
First, though, as you would expect from us important news updates to bring you and we begin with a new wave of Russian attacks across Ukraine and more 
 
 reports of loss life and power also a lack of water there. Ukrainian energy firm says every region of the country is now seeing power outages after the 
 
 strikes hit critical infrastructure.
 
Kyiv authorities say three people including a 17-year-old girl were killed when one of those missiles hit a residential building. The Mayor says part 
 
 of the city is in the dark and that there is currently no water, he adds more than 30 missiles flew towards the city today 21 of them was shot down.
 
Now this is all coming hours after a Russian strike in the Zaporizhzhia region where authorities say a maternity ward was hit and a newborn baby 
 
 there was killed. CNN's Matthew Chance is in Odessa and he joins us live from there now.
 
Matthew, let's start with the capital I know you're not there. We've just been reporting on the strikes that were directed at the city, some of which 
 
 were taken out. How bad is the situation as you understand it now in the capital?
 
MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, as I understand it, the strikes that took place took place in the Kyiv of 
 
 region, not in the center of the capital itself. But where the missiles struck I mean, there's obviously scenes of devastation, I've seen the video 
 
 from there.
 
And there are, you know, small fires that are continued to be burning. And of course, a residential block appears to have been struck in this attack 
 
 with at least three people who have been killed. And so that fits into a pattern of missile strikes that have been coming from Russia hitting 
 
 various cities and of course, targeting first and foremost the energy infrastructure projects or facilities in those cities in order to disable 
 
 them.
 
And that's been relatively effective in the sense that it's caused power cuts and a loss of heat and lighting across many areas of the country. I'm 
 
 talking to you now from Odessa in the south of Ukraine, you can tell you look, I mean, it's a completely pitch black city, what is it just about six 
 
 o'clock at night here, local time and any lights on, across the whole of the city.
 
People have their own generators, of course and so they're doing that, you know, as much as they can too for their own personal need but in general 
 
 that the city is an almost total darkness. We've seen another attack taking place as well in various places, but one particularly in which you refer to 
 
 in Zaporizhzhia, which struck a maternity clinic, in which a two year old sorry, a two day old baby was killed in an attack.
 
The mother and the doctor were pulled alive from the rubble of those maternity clinic absolutely terrible scenes there. And yet another tragedy 
 
 to pile on top of the kind of countless tragedies that we've been witnessing in this conflict and of course the situation is not showing any 
 
 signs of improving because those missile strikes taking out power systems at a time when demand for energy as we approach the winter as we continue 
 
 in the winter it gets much, much higher Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Very frightening situation Matthew thank you! The Kremlin says Vladimir Putin will meet this week with the mothers of reservist soldiers 
 
 called to fight in Ukraine. Now this comes as complaints have been flooding in from Russian soldiers including ones who were recently mobilized my 
 
 colleague, Fred Pleitgen has the details.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Stark images from what many believed to be the second strongest military in 
 
 the world. This video posted on social media purports to show new Russian recruits camped out in the snow and cold with little more than tarps for 
 
 shelter some trying to warm up by fires.
 
CNN cannot independently verify its authenticity but those posting it say the soldiers even had to buy their own food to survive. Problems during 
 
 training problems on the battlefield these recruits vent their anger at the Russian military.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We were abandoned without equipment without everything. Where are the tanks? Where are the armored personnel carriers? Come on, 
 
 bring it or I'll come for you.
 
PLEITGEN (voice over): Dilapidated barracks horrendous sanitary conditions poor food, the list of complaints often documented in social media posts 
 
 like this runs long since Russia says it has mobilized.
 <br>[11:05:00]
 
PLEITGEN (voice over): More than 300,000 men for the war in Ukraine since September, with more than 50,000 allegedly already on the battlefield, the 
 
 Kremlin says. Some relatives especially mothers complaining about the treatment of their loved ones. This group had Southwestern Russia saying 
 
 their husbands and sons had been sent to the front line without adequate training or gear.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The commander who gave the order that our men should hold the defense ignored the decree of the Supreme Commander in Chief that 
 
 the newly mobilized should not be sent to the first line of contact.
 
PLEITGEN (voice over): Even in the areas of Ukraine that Russia has annexed mothers are taking a stand, return students to their studies this sign in 
 
 Donetsk says.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Vladimir - please return our children. There are many dead many captured, the rest of the children are physically and morally 
 
 decimated.
 
PLEITGEN (voice over): Soldiers mothers traditionally carry a lot of sway in Russia, and Russian President Vladimir Putin seems eager to show he's 
 
 not tone deaf to their plight. Recently, visiting what the military says were new recruits, even firing a sniper rifle himself. Trying to convey he 
 
 cares about the new recruits.
 
VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT: About our country? You know, of course, we have costs, most notably regarding losses in the special military 
 
 operations. I think about it all the time.
 
PLEITGEN (voice over): But many mobilized Russians and their relatives seem to feel left out in the cold after their country called them up to serve in 
 
 a war that was never supposed to last this long Fred Pleitgen, CNN Moscow.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON: Well, a suspected "Combined Terror Attack" that is how Israeli police are describing twin bombings in Jerusalem this morning that killed a 
 
 15 year old boy and injured 18 other people. There have been about 30 minutes apart the first at a crowded bus station near the entrance to the 
 
 city.
 
This video is said to show the moment of the explosion has been widely shared on social media CNN unable to verify the source. The second 
 
 explosion happened at another bus station not far away. Police are searching for suspects these bombings coming amid an uptick in violence and 
 
 heightened tensions in Israel and in the occupied West Bank.
 
Hadas Gold back with us this hour from Jerusalem. And Hadas you are at the scene of one of those incidents so just describe what you are hearing and 
 
 what eye witnesses are telling you?
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, we were at the scene all day today from just a couple of hours after the first explosion took off. And one of the 
 
 thing that was most notable to me seeing this we were at the first explosion where that 15 year old boy was killed is just how wide the debris 
 
 field was from where it seems the explosive device was planted.
 
I mean, the debris field reached far past at least three lanes of traffic. This was along a bus stop a very busy bus stop along an artery than one of 
 
 the main ways in and out of the city and Israeli police are now saying that they do believe these were very powerful explosives that were purposely 
 
 hidden along the bus stops.
 
They also believe that these were remotely detonated by cell phone and that the terrorists knew the area well. But Becky this is a deadly escalation in 
 
 what's already been a very deadly year.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
GOLD (voice over): Sirens ring out during rush hour after a double bombing shook Jerusalem Wednesday morning. A 15 year old student was killed and 
 
 more than 14 injured in what authorities are calling a suspected coordinated combined terror attack.
 
The first explosion captured on CCTV footage widely shared on social media rocking a bus station at one of the main entrances to the city. The blast 
 
 so strong debris and pockmarks reaching past three lanes of traffic authorities believe a bag or package was placed at the bus stop around 7 am 
 
 and was likely detonated remotely the first class killing the teenage boy, a Canadian Israeli citizen who was a student at a Jewish religious school 
 
 and injuring at least 11 others.
 
A second blast occurred not far from the first around half an hour later at the city's remote junction lightly injuring three people. A spokesman for 
 
 first responders at the scene telling CNN the injuries inflicted show the hallmarks of terror.
 
RAPHAEL POCH, SPOKESPERSON, UNITED HATZALAH INTERNATIONAL: There were shrapnel injuries in nails and ball bearings and those types of things 
 
 which were very common to be placed in bombs that detonate for the sake of terror were definitely a factor as well.
 
GOLD (voice over): The incident reminiscent of the style of attacks carried out in the Second Intifada, organized and technically sophisticated.
 
POCH: This is something very, very tragic. It's something we haven't seen in a very long time. And we hope it doesn't come back to become a routine 
 
 or regular situation.
 <br>[11:10:00]
 
GOLD (voice over): Israel's Prime Minister Yair Lapid also noting the worrying development.
 
YAIR LAPID, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER: This event is different from what we have seen in recent years. An extensive intelligence effort is now underway 
 
 that will lead us to find these heinous terrorists, those behind them and those who provided them with weapons.
 
GOLD (voice over): As Israeli police search for suspects the man pushing to become Public Security Minister in the incoming government arrived at the 
 
 scene, the far right leader Itamar Ben Gvir calling for sweeping security measures in response.
 
ITAMAR BEN GVIR, JEWISH POWER PARTY LEADER: Charging a price for the terror means checking where these terrorists came from reaching their villages, 
 
 whether they are in Israel or in Judea and Samaria, imposing a curfew, going from house to house and searching for weapons and bringing back 
 
 deterrence and governance.
 
GOLD (voice over): A deadly escalation in what's already been one of the most violent years in this region since the days of the Second Intifada, as 
 
 fears grows, that this attack will bring more.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
GOLD: And Becky, in just the past few minutes, we have received confirmation that two U.S. citizens were among those injured in today's 
 
 attack, not clear if they're dual American Israeli citizens or just U.S. citizens. But the U.S. Embassy does say that they're expected to fully 
 
 recover, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: And what do we know about who may be behind these attacks?
 
GOLD: Yes, what's interesting is so far no militant group has taken responsibility for this attack, although groups like Hamas and the 
 
 Palestinian Islamic Jihad have praised the attack. But the Israeli authorities are calling it very well organized; they think that it was 
 
 carried out by a well-organized cell.
 
But they have not given us any indication pointing the blame at any sort of group or any sort of area that they believe this came from, but typically 
 
 these types of attacks, they take a certain level of technological sophistication and organization because they were planned out.
 
They were placed in strategic places, and the fact that they were detonated remotely, potentially by self when Israeli police believe that shows quite 
 
 a bit of backing and organization behind that Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Hadas Gold on the story back from the scene at the Jerusalem Bureau. Thank you. Well, police in Virginia have confirmed the suspect in 
 
 Tuesday's shooting at a Walmart was an employee. Police say he opened fire with a pistol on fellow employees gathered in a break room.
 
Six victims died and four others are in hospital. It happened as customers were doing last minute shopping for what is the upcoming Thanksgiving 
 
 holiday there. And it follows a shooting at the University of Virginia just over a week and a half ago that killed three. Many are urging lawmakers to 
 
 do much more to address the mass shootings that are becoming so frequent across the United States. State Senator Louise Lucas spoke to our Kaitlan 
 
 Collins.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEN. LOUISE LUCAS (D-VA): A lot of us didn't get much sleep last night didn't that rest will and will not rest well, until we get a handle on this 
 
 gun violence. We need gun violence prevention in Virginia. And I tell you for all the people who are saying that their hearts and prayers go out to 
 
 these people.
 
I don't want to hear any more about that until they get serious about gun violence prevention. That's the only thing that's going to stop us from 
 
 having to stand before these cameras or right these tip lines say that we are our hearts and prayers go out for them.
 
We can do something to stop this and I'm sick and tired of legislative give a mouth service to after we have these violent mass shootings, and then do 
 
 nothing about it when I have an opportunity to go back to the legislature and do something about it.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, for more details I'm joined now by Brian Todd live from Chesapeake in Virginia. What more do we know of the details about the event 
 
 there Brian?
 
BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Becky police have filled in some gaps of information that we were looking to get filled in. But not all the 
 
 answers are in yet. They do say that the shooting occurred at 10:12 pm at least that's when the first calls to police came in 10:12 pm eastern time 
 
 on Tuesday night police arrived two minutes later.
 
They were in the building two minutes after that. So a total of four minutes elapsed between the time the first 911 calls went out and when 
 
 police entered the building. They rendered the building safe at 11:20 pm Eastern time. As you mentioned six victims are dead the shooter is also 
 
 dead.
 
A law enforcement source telling us that the shooter is an employee who came into a break room and opened fire on a group of people who were in the 
 
 break room then turn the gun on himself one of the CNN's Affiliates WTKR spoke to the sister of a victim who survived the attack. Here's what she 
 
 had to say.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We went in at 10 pm tonight and we received a phone call well his wife received a phone call with about 10:18 saying that he 
 
 had been shot. He got caught accident 10 so he hadn't even been there 10 minutes.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[11:15:00]
 
TODD: And we can now report that the shooter was an overnight manager for Walmart. That's according to CNN sources. Again, law enforcement sources 
 
 telling us this were an employee we now know it was an Overnight Manager who was the shooter in this case.
 
Police are not releasing the shooters' name because his next of kin have not been notified yet. What we do also know according to police is that he 
 
 used a pistol. They have not said whether any other weapons were used and they were not. They do not have the information on any possible motive. 
 
 We've been pressing them on that and whether there was any conflict among employees inside the store, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Brian Todd is on the story shocking, thank you. Well, the shooting in Virginia comes just days after five people were gunned down in 
 
 Colorado Springs LGBTQ Nightclub. Police say two firearms were recovered at the scene of Saturday's attack there.
 
The shooting suspect Anderson Lee Aldrich is expected to make an initial court appearance in the coming hours and could face multiple murders and 
 
 hate crimes charges. And we are also learning more about the 22 year old court documents eldritch identifies as non-binary and uses them them 
 
 pronouns.
 
Well, this Wednesday has indeed been a very grim news day. The world of sport has been important to a certain extent in offering some respite and a 
 
 reminder that apart from the grimness there is - well there are things to celebrate in the world.
 
Still ahead, we'll hear from the Saudi Sports Minister on his nation's upset win over powerhouse Argentina yesterday. And Germany's day at the 
 
 World Cup started out with a protest and ended with a stunning upset all the details from another dramatic day on the pitch from Doha coming up.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: Well, we're back with us in Doha. On celebrations for Saudi Arabia's iconic victory against Argentina continued well into the evening 
 
 on Tuesday. Let me tell you it was wild. The fan zone area imbued with the color green as people waved the Saudi flag with pride. Saudi and Arab fans 
 
 alike chanting singing and dancing the night away. Have a listen to what one of them had to say earlier today.
 <br>[11:20:00]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ASSEM AL-RAJIHI, SAUDI FAN: In this tournament, first of all its - Qatar, its nearby country, a country we love. I think many of the fans are coming 
 
 from close country. So I think the atmosphere is very close to us, the culture is there. So we are motivated to do best.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, let's remember this win was all the more remarkable because the entire Saudi team ply their trade in their domestic league, no 
 
 accident, perhaps considering just how much Saudi Arabia is investing in facilities and development. In the last hour, I sat down with the country's 
 
 Sports Minister who detail for me just why the kingdom is emphasizing football and with major assets and a player up for sale in England. He also 
 
 gave us a hint as to the next big investment. Have a listen.
 
PRINCE ABDULAZIZ BIN TURKI AL-FAISAL, SAUDI SPORTS MINISTER: We've invested a lot in sports in the past couple of years, and this showcases the 
 
 results. And you know, the Saudi League has also invested, we've invested a lot of in the Saudi League and teams and really restructuring sports in the 
 
 kingdom as an ecosystem.
 
And how do we make it as professional as anywhere else in the world because we know that Saudis are passionate about sports. When I started in the 
 
 Olympic Committee, we had 32 Federations. Today we have 97 Federation's with different sports and sports that we did not know, Saudis actually 
 
 play. So there's a lot of investment in sports.
 
And it's for the people that showcases that there's something good for the people to get into, and you know, the results showcase and the tournaments 
 
 that we compete in, even in Asia, we've, you know, we've qualified in our top of our league, we've competed in the club, club, Asian Cup and we 
 
 wanted twice in the past three or four years.
 
So it's been a constant effort in the past couple of years, to really invest in the proper way with the international standards and how to 
 
 develop sports in the kingdom.
 
ANDERSON: And so you are investing significantly inside the country, not just in football, but as you say, across sports, including in golf and in 
 
 F1, where you are continually regularly criticized for sports washing, as you are with investments outside of the country, which are significant, for 
 
 example, the sovereign wealth fund investing in Newcastle, for example, in the English Premier League. What's your response to those?
 
AL-FAISAL: Where do you see the numbers, - don't lie. We hosted our first Boxing International match in 2018. And at the time, we had only six teams 
 
 in Saudi that had boxing, today we have 57. And the increase of participants grew by 300 percent. That's by just hosting one event.
 
So we host these events to showcase to the Saudis what the international standard is. And they can be part of that, because they see it in front of 
 
 their eyes. And the participation has grown or had grown in the past couple of years.
 
Our target for 2030 was 40 percent of Saudis to participate in sports half an hour or more a week, we've reached to 48 percent in 2022. So that 
 
 showcases that the country is active. We're doing these things for the people in the country. And it's benefiting us big time, socially, 
 
 economically, on every level. So it's a big strategy that we're working on. And we see the benefit, so why not?
 
ANDERSON: And when therefore you hear the criticisms of sports washing of this effort to soften the country's image, do you see that lace somewhat 
 
 with a vein of racism?
 
AL-FAISAL: A bit and maybe ignorance and people that don't know Saudi Arabia have never been to Saudi Arabia, and they go out and talk about it 
 
 as they've lived there for 30 years, 40 years. So I always tell people come to Saudi, come and see Saudi see what it is, see the people, meet the 
 
 people, look what the country is doing for the future of the people in Saudi, and then you can criticize as much as you like.
 
ANDERSON: Let's talk about investments. Cristiano Ronaldo and audacious bid made by a club in Saudi last year to offer Cristiano Ronaldo a two year 
 
 contract worth, as I understand it, $360 million, or something like that to come and play in the Saudi league. As of last night Ronaldo doesn't have a 
 
 club. Is he going to be playing in Saudi next season?
 
AL-FAISAL: I don't know. That's a straight answer. I read the same thing as you read in the news and you know, we see a lot of things about Saudi 
 
 Arabia mentioned that the new especially when there's big money around it, but I don't know anything about what his future plans are.
 
ANDERSON: Would you like to see him playing in Saudi next season.
 
AL-FAISAL: Why not? You know, we have a strong league. In each team we have seven foreign players and one player on the bench and hopefully we're 
 
 looking to increase that. Our teams play in the top level in Asia and football is strong in Saudi, so why not?
 
ANDERSON: Speaking of Ronaldo, Manchester United owners exploring a potential sale, we saw similar reports about Liverpool. Again a Saudi bit - 
 
 owns Newcastle of course, can you see a Saudi interest in either of those two clubs?
 <br>[11:25:00]
 
AL-FAISAL: Everything is possible these days. But I don't know about the facts about these reports, honestly, nothing, you know, the ministry is in 
 
 charge of everything within the kingdom and developing sports within the kingdom.
 
ANDERSON: But you know, what's going on in Saudi, you know people are talking about - you're leaving the door open to that?
 
AL-FAISAL: Well, you know, we look at all opportunities like everything else. And we think and we believe that these opportunities come once in a 
 
 lifetime or once in a lifetime. And we have to take advantage of that in everything that we do, even before we signed with Formula One, you know, 
 
 all the stories that came out about that.
 
And then finally, we could you know, reach to a deal with Formula One to have Formula One in Saudi, but honestly about Ronaldo, I have no details.
 
ANDERSON: Since Abdulaziz bin Turki al Faisal, speaking to me last hour, good to have him on the show. Saudi fans couldn't help but poke fun at 
 
 Argentineans online after that result they got against the team social media are awash with memes, like this joking about talisman, Lionel Messi's 
 
 performance.
 
This one is in reference to Argentina's 36 game unbeaten run, which of course Saudi Arabia brought to an end unceremoniously this week. And of 
 
 course, when Argentina went add one nil early on, not many gave them a chance, including many of the online game predictors, much to the delight 
 
 of Saudi fans who are really taking part in the festivities on the ground here to.
 
Well, FIFA Chief Gianni Infantino's denunciation of the West's reaction to the Qatar World Cup went viral, sparking anger and ridicule in many places. 
 
 But to many Arabs and Muslims it resonated really strongly vocalizing what many have felt about being targets of racism.
 
You can read more about why some Arabs and Muslims feel stung by some of the coverage at the World Cup by signing up for our meanwhile, in the 
 
 Middle East newsletter, it is written in the region on the region for viewers around the world. Just head to cnn.com or use the CNN app. It's a

Well, the UN Human Rights Council sounds the alarm on what's happening in Iran it's warning of rising deaths and even children not being spared as 
 
 security forces crackdown on anti-government protests, details on that are just ahead.
 
And the world's biggest i-phone factory has a problem on its hands. What Foxconn's work of protest could mean for Apple, that coming up.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:30:00]
 
ANDERSON: Well, the U.S. Special Envoy for Iran is responding after a CNN exclusive report uncovered how some Iranian security forces are assaulting, 
 
 raping and torturing detained protesters, both men and women. Robert Malley tweeted and I quote him here this report describes unspeakable acts of 
 
 sexual violence by Iranian officials in detention centers.
 
It is a reminder of what is at stake for the Iranian people and of the lengths to which the regime will go and it's futile attempt to silence 
 
 dissent. Well, the exclusive reporting is from our Nima Elbagir and her team. This is a brief excerpt if you haven't seen it.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT: This is Hannah, not her real name, a Kurdish Iranian woman recently smuggled out of 
 
 Iran, she fears for her life. After taking off and burning her headscarf on the streets, she was arrested and detained by Iranian intelligence 
 
 officers.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They choose the women who were pretty and suited their appetite. Then the officer would take one of them from the cell to a 
 
 smaller private room. They would sexually assault them there.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, you can see the full investigation on cnn.com on your app, of course, your CNN app. Well, the UN and Human Rights Council will hold an 
 
 emergency meeting on Thursday following a request from Germany and from Iceland.
 
The U. N. warns Iran's crackdown on anti-government protests is intensifying, particularly in those Kurdish areas. Since last week, there 
 
 have been dozens of deaths reported with authorities even refusing to release bodies to grieving families.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JEREMY LAWRENCE, SPOKESMAN, U.N. OFFICE OF THE HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS: The rising number of deaths from protests in Iran, including those 
 
 of two children at the weekend and the hardening of the response by security forces underlines the critical situation in the country. Sources 
 
 say over 40 people have been killed in mainly Kurdish cities in the past week alone.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: CNN's Jomana Karadsheh joins us now. And Jomana you've been tracking these developments closely now. I mean, not just what's been 
 
 happening over the last 24 hours. But over the last two months now, what more do we know what can we say categorically at this point?
 
JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Becky, you heard it there from the UN Human Rights Chief, the situation across Iran is critical. We are 
 
 seeing the death toll continuing to rise significantly in recent days. And the government's crackdown is intensifying.
 
There's a lot of concern about what is happening right now, in the western part of the country in the majority Kurdish areas where activist and a 
 
 human rights monitor have been telling us that they have seen a vicious assault launched over the past week by the Iranian regime and they're very 
 
 concerned about what is going on right now and what may happen in the coming days. Becky we must warn viewers that they may find some of the 
 
 video in our report, graphic and disturbing.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KARADSHEH (voice over): Hundreds poured into the streets if --you're on shore, united in their grief and anger. A martyr for Kurdistan, the crowd 
 
 chants. They chant for 16 year old protester Karwan Ghader Shokri, one of the youngest lives lost in a week of carnage across Iran's Kurdish region. 
 
 At his burial his father tells mourners I've dedicated my son to Kurdistan.
 
Every funeral brings more anger, more defiance from a minority long oppressed by the ruthless Republic. Iran's minorities including the Kurds 
 
 have borne the brunt of an unforgiving crackdown. British cities and towns turned into war zones, the regime sent in troops and heavy weapons to 
 
 suppress an uprising that's been grown stronger by the day.
 
RAMYAR HASSANI, HENGAW ORGANIZATION FOR HUMAN RIGHTS: The entire regime has become very militarized. This is quite a planned operation against the 
 
 Kurds. They very deliberately, indiscriminately are killing the Kurds in every city of Kurdistan.
 <br>[11:35:00]
 
KARADSHEH (voice over): Video after video emerged Monday, capturing the horror unleashed on the town of Javanrud. No respite from the 
 
 indiscriminate heavy gunfire, not even to retreat they're dead. The regime claims it's confronting terrorists and separatists, activists warn it's a 
 
 pretext for an even bloodier crackdown under the cover of an intranet shut down, most of the region's now been cut off from the world.
 
HASSANI: Whenever Iranian government is shutting down internet, it means that they want to intensify the crackdown even more and carry out the 
 
 operations they want to even more freely.
 
KARADSHEH (voice over): Iran's repressive regime hasn't been holding back against its own people, but much fear, the worst is yet to come.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
KARADSHEH: And Becky, we have been constantly in touch with Hengaw Organization for Human Rights and activist trying to get an update on the 
 
 situation in those Kurdish areas. They are having a very, very hard time getting any information out of there because of the government's internet 
 
 shut down.
 
But they say from the information that has been trickling out they have confirmed that 45 people at least have been killed over the past week and 
 
 hundreds more they say have been injured, but they believe the numbers are much, much higher than that Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Jomana, thank you. Jomana Karadsheh on the story for you, she has been now for weeks. Let's get you up to speed on some of the other stories 
 
 that are on our radar right now. And Turkish President Erdogan says his country's determination to secure its southern borders is "Stronger than 
 
 ever", and its aerial campaign is "Just the beginning".
 
State News reports Turkey launched a new offensive last week after Kurdish separatists were blamed for a deadly explosion in Istanbul. Kurdish groups 
 
 deny that claim. Indonesia's National Agency for disaster management has said they rescued a six year old boy from the earthquake debris he was 
 
 found alive beside his grandmother's body. The boy's parents also passed away.
 
They are among at least 271 people who were killed by the 5.6 magnitude quake on Monday. We are looking at social media, a media video here of 
 
 workers protesting at a Foxconn i-phone factory in central China. Now they are confronting police in hazmat suits the plan is Zhengzhou.
 
 It's one of Apple's largest and it's been wrestling with major disruptions since mid- October due to a COVID-19 outbreak. CNN's Selina Wang brings us 
 
 the details.
 
SELINA WANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The chaos at Apple's largest i-phone assembly factory in central China is getting worse. Videos show hundreds of 
 
 workers streaming out of their factory dorms, protesting and clashing with police. Many of the law enforcement workers are wearing white hazmat suits. 
 
 The footage which has now been censored from Chinese social media shows some of the protesters complaining about their pay and poor sanitary 
 
 conditions.
 
This follows weeks of turmoil at this factory in Zhengzhou, China. After a COVID outbreak at the factory in mid-October workers have been complaining 
 
 about subpar feed and living conditions. Viral Videos have showed masses of workers fleeing the factory walking miles along highways to escape COVID 
 
 restrictions.
 
But Foxconn desperately needs workers especially ahead of this critical holiday season. So Foxconn said it would give a one-time bonus equivalent 
 
 to 69 U.S. dollars if workers who left chose to return. It also said it would offer new workers or salary of four U.S. dollars per hour.
 
Just last week, Foxconn said more than 100,000 people signed up for its massive recruitment drive. But in this recent footage, workers are heard 
 
 saying that Foxconn failed to keep their promise of a better bonus and pay package after they arrived to work at the plant, accusing Foxconn of 
 
 changing the salary packages.
 
Workers in the videos are also heard saying that those who tested positive for COVID were not being separated from the rest of the workforce. In a 
 
 statement in English, Foxconn denied all of those allegations, and said the dorms that factory workers live in undergo standard procedures for 
 
 disinfection. But all of this has been a big blow for Apple.
 
The company warned earlier this month that shipments of its latest products will be temporarily impacted and delayed because of China's COVID 
 
 restrictions. It's another reminder of the risks that Apple faces in relying on China for its production.
 
China is still stuck in this unpredictable cycle of lockdowns; it's completely up ending people's lives China's economy and global business.

ANDERSON: Right, up next on "Connect the World, Germany's silent protests for free speech at this world cup, that story as well as what is another 
 
 shocking upset on the pitch, that is after this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
WAYNE ROONEY, FORMER ENGLAND FOOTBALLER: In Germany it's probably the best one which is the number of obviously nowadays. A member in Germany could be 
 
 role in the treatment room it was a big gathering outside the window. So we kept looking out in those thousands with new funds taking all the players 
 
 names.
 
Every now and again one player popped out and we start singing the song and it's a shame that that's the best man; it was great to see in the 
 
 atmosphere some of the fun.
 
We were lucky a few times obviously in the Euro 2004, 2006 World Cup get knocked out on penalties bolted court found stage. Again I stopped a little 
 
 bit looking these if you go through there you potentially go on and win the competition. So we've been fortunate on a couple of occasions but yes, it's 
 
 difficult to win World Cup. But we tried our best.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, that was the legendary Wayne Rooney. Let me just explain. If you're wondering where why I was in a player, sort of black rubber 
 
 gloves and he was in an orange pinny, we were actually making sushi together up at Sushisamba, when we were doing that interview in Dubai 
 
 recently.
 
So I thought maybe that was just needed explaining. He gave his many a happy memory in an England shirt, the top scorer ever for his country with 
 
 53 goals. But Hurricane could break that record at this year's World Cup. Tune in tomorrow when we will be speaking with a former teammate of Rooney, 
 
 Zlatan Ibrahimovic about his memories of the tournament with Sweden. Well more controversy today at the World Cup about human rights here in Qatar.
 
And what players in the tournament are allowed to do to express their opinions about that. The entire German team covered their mouths for their 
 
 team photo earlier today in protest against FIFA's free speech rules. Germany and several other teams had planned to wear armbands to show 
 
 solidarity with campaigners in Qatar but FIFA told teams they will be penalized for doing so.
 
Well on the pitch, Germany became another victim of a shocking upset today. Japan bested the European power to one just a day after Saudi Arabia 
 
 stunned Argentina with finals favorites.
 <br>[11:45:00]
 
ANDERSON: Spain also in their group, it means Germany will have an uphill climb. To even make it to the knockout stage at this point, let's bring in 
 
 CNN's Amanda Davies, Spain player at the moment, of course.
 
AMANDA DAVIES, CNN WORLD SPOT: And it's going pretty well.
 
ANDERSON: All right.
 
DAVIES: Isn't it? I mean, three nil by halftime, three hours and 30 minutes. And this is this painting, which got to the semifinals at Euro 
 
 2020. We knew they were on the uphill.
 
ANDERSON: So you'd expect them to be performing as well as or you would hope that they would against Costa Rica, not so much the results for the 
 
 Germans earlier on today.
 
DAVIES: Yes, it's interesting this because I think Japan would have a view with people saying this is a shocking result. Japan went further than 
 
 Germany did in the last World Cup in 2018, of course, but I don't think anybody expected to, to be quite as it ended up.
 
And this is a Germany side, who their coach Hansi Flick sat down yesterday. And he said, we need to be really careful that we don't do an Argentina, 
 
 and that they talked as a team about the importance of getting off to a good start for the mentality and the momentum going forward.
 
Because that was where they felt they went wrong four years ago, but this is a Japan side who have a sort of their squad of 26, who play their 
 
 football in Germany, a lot of them play around Europe. They know this team; they know how to play this team. And they have a point to prove themselves 
 
 and they've got a little bit of added motivation.
 
Their coach was involved in it now infamous match that took place here in Qatar, which meant that Japan missed out on the World Cup in 1994. It was 
 
 called the tragedy of Doha. And they've used that as motivation heading into this. And there's a lot of talk about turning that tragedy into 
 
 triumph. And they've certainly got off a good start.
 
ANDERSON: Right. They were good to watch today. You always sort of assume that the Germans whatever happen in the run-up to the World Cup that 
 
 they'll turn up at the World Cup. Actually, that isn't true. I mean, you know, 2018.
 
DAVIES: 2018 was a real; it was an embarrassing humiliating tournament for them, because they went into it as the defending champions. And that, of 
 
 course, didn't signal the end of the yogi love tenure as people had wanted.
 
But ultimately, we now have Hansi Flick in charge, he took over after the European Championships, which again was disappointing for them, but they 
 
 had started to build some momentum. And this is certainly not how they would have wanted to kick off this tournament; particularly given the fact 
 
 you've got Spain and Costa Rica.
 
ANDERSON: We did see some protests by this team at the beginning of or ahead of the match in the team photo. Let's bring that up again. Amanda, 
 
 just explain what we're seeing here and why.
 
DAVIES: So Germany had been one of the most vocal teams in terms of their disappointment, the anger actually of FIFA not bending their rules and not 
 
 allowing team captains to wear the one love armband that they had wanted to do here in Qatar, where it's illegal to be gay.
 
And they wanted to wear the one love armband to really promote diversity and inclusion. When FIFA said that if that happens, teams and players would 
 
 be punished with yellow cards, the UAFA working group for human rights then said we're angry at this. But we will look at what else we can do. And 
 
 Germany is the first team who have come out and actually taken that step. And this is what they've opted to do.
 
They issued a really, really strong statement, basically saying, this is not about making a political statement. Human rights are non-negotiable. 
 
 This should be taken for granted. But it still isn't the case. That's why this message is important to us. Denying us the armband is the same as 
 
 denying us a voice.
 
ANDERSON: Has FIFA responded? I mean, could there be sanction for this?
 
DAVIES: Yes, they haven't as yet. And that's what we're waiting to see. I think the suggestion would be that if it's anything it would be a fine 
 
 which of course then doesn't impact what happens in the tournament. But actually, given where Germany ended up today, I know. But it'd be really 
 
 interesting to see what other teams do now to follow suit.
 
And the issue we've got is because there's not been a hard line drawn in the sand, it could be that every game, every team at the moment we're 
 
 watching to see what happens and what message is sent.
 
ANDERSON: Always good to have you, thank you. Amanda Davies is in the house for you. Still ahead, it's not just about the game; it's about the World 
 
 Cup experience, of course. Fans of all 32 teams have made the journey to Qatar to cheer on their teams. I'll talk to a couple of those fans up next. 
 
 Do stay with us. You're going to love this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:50:00]
 
ANDERSON: Right Just a few days into this world cup. And we have seen two big upsets a few too many scoreless tours and lots of enthusiasm from 
 
 supporters around the world who have traveled to Qatar to cheer on their teams. And I'm absolutely delighted to have a few of them here with me in 
 
 the studio all the way from Mexico City, Esteban Gonzalez and from Zacatecas, Andres Alvarado. How about that for an accent a, not bad?
 
ANDRES ALVARADO: You're doing great.
 
ESTEBAN GONZALEZ: Amazing.
 
ANDERSON: OK, let's address the skeleton in the room as it were. Why are you an idea, the last --?
 
GONZALEZ: Junior Hub, this is one of the most amazing, amazing traditions we have in Mexico, which is El Dia de los Muertos traditions and my 
 
 character Charo talks about Mexico about the joy, of course on cultural traditions. But the joy, which is you know, the Mexicans we keep the 
 
 Mexicans that are here in the World Cup. They are just amazing. A lot of videos are going viral because of the party, because they dance, we dance 
 
 La Chona, we took the Metro yesterday.
 
ANDERSON: I mean, you've been making such an impression the Mexican fans on the people here and the relationship between the Mexican fans, let me tell 
 
 you viewers, and the Saudi fans who are here has been absolutely amazing. I mean, tell me how have you been getting on?
 
ALVARADO: Honestly, it's just a passion for us. We love, we love coming here. We love it's, we'll save money for years anything to be here. We'll 
 
 do anything to be here.
 
ANDERSON: What's the reaction been? For you decked out like this?
 
GONZALEZ: They love it, Becky. They love it. People ask me for thousands, tons of pictures. Kids grabbed me to the leg. They call me Coco, so it was 
 
 amazing like it's cathartic, it's amazing.
 
ANDERSON: Well I'm glad you're getting a superb reaction, so you should be the team on the pitch a little bit disappointed although the keeper, let's 
 
 just talk about you went to the game right? Right you went to the game, tell me what did you think?
 
ALVARADO: You know what? We were honestly, our expectations not so great. But like I said for us the team, if Mexico is playing good or bad, we don't 
 
 care.
 
ANDERSON: Yes.
 
ALVARADO: We do not care.
 
ANDERSON: The keeper I mean the keeper let me tell you. If you don't know viewers, he saved that Levandowski penalty. I mean an absolute hero, what a 
 
 suit, not just for the fans but for Mexico as a whole.
 
ALVARADO: FIFA World Cup, he's a legend for us. FIFI World Cup maybe even six, six World Cup might be back in our home, so.
 <br>[11:55:00]
 
ANDERSON: How do you feel about Qatar, how do you feel about being here? What's the atmosphere; just describe it for our viewers?
 
GONZALEZ: Absolutely. I think we are experiencing a big celebration a big party. We are in a country that prepare for months, maybe years for this 
 
 event for sure years. For this event they are receiving the whole world to give us this and amazing and amazing, you can see here in the souk families 
 
 children enjoying. So it's been an amazing --.
 
I think Becky, it's very important to send this message to the world like nations can be together in peace and celebrating.
 
ANDERSON: You're absolutely right. Tell me how long does it take to get that makeup on?
 
GONZALEZ: Two hours.
 
ANDERSON: Two hours. You look gorgeous.
 
ALVARADO: Thank you very much.
 
ANDERSON: Both of you thank you very much indeed. That's it from us today. We'll be back with more coverage tomorrow. But stick with CNN, of course 
 
 because the news never stops.
