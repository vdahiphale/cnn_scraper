THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR: Good morning, everyone. Here we are. 
 <br>[05:59:41]
 
POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR: We made it. Everybody got up.
 
LEMON: Everybody got up.
 
KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN ANCHOR: We woke up.
 
LEMON: We're all awake. Is this rehearsal, or is this real?
 
COLLINS: No, it's real.
 
LEMON: It's real.
 
HARLOW: The real thing.
 
LEMON: It's real. You guys ready? I think we're ready.
 
I'm Don Lemon, alongside Poppy Harlow and Kaitlan Collins. It is November 1, and welcome to our very first show. We hope you enjoy. You're going to learn a lot about us and get a lot of news. Right?
 
COLLINS: A lot of news. And can I tell you all, obviously, you know, I just moved here.
 
HARLOW: Yes.
 
COLLINS: You know the in-depth details of my move. There was a Halloween parade outside my apartment last night --
 
LEMON: We got the text.
 
COLLINS: -- that went until, like, 10 p.m. 
 
LEMON: Yes. 
 
COLLINS: Blaring music.
 
HARLOW: Yes.
 
COLLINS: All of this stuff as I was trying to get to sleep early, like first day of school feeling.
 
LEMON: How many hours?
 
COLLINS: Six.
 
HARLOW: Kaitlan is texting us.
 
LEMON: You got six hours.
 
HARLOW: You got six?
 
LEMON: And you?
 
HARLOW: Kaitlan's texting us. I'm like, welcome to New York, girlfriend. Get used to it. 
 
My kids got home from trick-or-treating super late. My husband's like, why aren't you asleep? And I was like, this is my new life, babe. 
 
COLLINS: This is life.
 
LEMON: I got probably two hours' sleep.
 
HARLOW: I know. We've got to work on this.
 
LEMON: I woke up at 12:59, and I could not go back to sleep.
 
Also, my friends threw, like a little dinner party celebration last night, like, eight of us, maybe ten of us. And they kept trying to give me wine. I was like, I've got to go. I've got to go. 
 
HARLOW: I think you need new friends. 
 
LEMON: Yes.
 
HARLOW: We're going to go to dinner at 6 p.m. 
 
LEMON: I have two new friends. Right?
 
COLLINS: Aww. Absolutely.
 
LEMON: So happy to be here. We're going to get to the news.
 
COLLINS: Yes.
 
LEMON: You're going to hear more about us a little bit later on. There's a lot to get to this morning, including a potential game- changer in Russia's war in Ukraine from Iran. We are live at the State Department this morning.
 
HARLOW: New revelations this morning of a politically-motivated plot by the intruder accused of attacking Nancy Pelosi's husband. And these facts refute all of the conspiracy theories around that attack.
 
COLLINS: We'll also have a new interview with Pennsylvania Senate candidate John Fetterman. His answers on whether he regrets participating in that debate with Mehmet Oz and updates on his health heading into the final days of the race. Don interviewed him. So obviously, as we know, no question is off limits. 
 
LEMON: Yes. Can't wait to get to that. We have a lot to get to, as I said, this morning.
 
We're going to begin, though, with a brand-new CNN reporting on a major escalation in Russia's war in Ukraine. We are learning that Iran is preparing to send 1,000 new weapons to Vladimir Putin, including surface-to-surface short-range ballistic missiles and more attack drones. 
 
U.S. intelligence agencies monitoring Iran's support for Russia very closely. 
 
Straight to CNN's Kylie Atwood, live at the State Department for us this morning. 
 
Kylie, good morning. This would be the first time Iran is sending advanced, precision-guided missiles to Russia. How significant is this escalation? 
 
KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that's right, Don. This will be the first time that these advanced weapons would be -- would be going from Iran to Russia. 
 
And it's significant because of just how advanced these weapons are. 
 
First of all, they're hard to detect, and they are able to hit at precision targets. So they're not just the drones that we've already seen Iran send to Russia in recent weeks that have been used to deadly effect on the battlefield. These are much more advanced weaponry. 
 
Now, we know that the Biden administration has been watching for Iran to send potentially more weaponry to Russia, with the secretary of state saying just last week that the Biden administration is doing everything that they can do to try and break up these networks to prevent further shipments from -- of Iranian weapons to the battlefield for Russia to use in the war in Ukraine. 
 
LEMON: Kylie, here's a concern. That these weapons from Iran, it's going to change the course of Russia's war on Ukraine. Do we know how the Biden administration and NATO might respond to this? 
 
ATWOOD: Yes. Well, what we would expect would be definitely sanctions. Right? 
 
The Biden administration doesn't like to get ahead of what those sanctions would look like, but the secretary of state has already said that they are looking at sanctions, that we would -- would be put in place if further weaponry were sent from Iran to Russia. 
 
What they would do, is they would go after those who are manufacturing these weapons, or shipping these weapons. Of course, to try and prevent further weaponry from going from Iran to Russia. But it's also important, guys, to note that the fact that Russia is turning to Iran for these weapons does demonstrate just how they are doing in this war right now. They don't have necessarily all the weaponry that they want on their own to try and continue fighting this war -- Don. 
 
LEMON: CNN's Kylie Atwood, at the State Department, thank you very much. 
 
And of course, CNN is on the ground in the region. We're join Clarissa Ward in just a little bit, live from Ukraine. She is standing by in a central city where a Russian missile hit an industrial enterprise. What she's seeing on the ground as Iran prepares to send more weapons -- Poppy. 
 
HARLOW: So we'll get to Clarissa on the ground in a moment. 
 
But now more chilling details on that violent attack on Nancy Pelosi's husband Paul Pelosi, including the suspect's plan to hold the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, hostage and to break her kneecaps. That is what he told authorities.
 
The suspect is now charged with a litany of state and federal crimes, including attempted murder and attempted kidnapping. He is expected in court in just a few hours for his arraignment. 
 
Let's go to our Josh Campbell. He's live in San Francisco.
 
I mean, Josh, the details of this are so chilling. I would also note, every single fact, from the D.A. to the police chief, debunk all the conspiracy theories around this. 
 
JOSH CAMPBELL, CNN SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: That's right. The more we're learning about this, we're learning that this was a suspect who allegedly conducted a politically motivated attack. 
 
As you mentioned, he has now been criminally charged, and looking through court records, we're getting chilling new details, including this alleged confession the suspect made to investigators about his desire to harm the speaker of the House to send a message to other members of Congress.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BROOKE JENKINS, SAN FRANCISCO DISTRICT ATTORNEY: I am here today to formally announce charges against Mr. David DePape in connection with the violent attack on Mr. Pelosi.
 <br>[06:05:08] 
 
CAMPBELL (voice-over): The San Francisco district attorney charging the man accused of attacking Paul Pelosi, the husband of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. 
 
JENKINS: The charges that we are filing today include attempted murder, residential burglary, assault with a deadly weapon, elder abuse, false imprisonment of an elder, as well as threats to a public official and their family. 
 
CAMPBELL (voice-over): Those are state charges. The Justice Department earlier charged DePape with two federal crimes: attempted kidnapping of a U.S. official, Nancy Pelosi; and assaulting a U.S. official's immediate family member. 
 
Authorities say the suspect brought two hammers, zip ties, rope and a roll of tape with him to the Pelosi residence. 
 
San Francisco's district attorney now offering a chilling timeline about Paul Pelosi's face-to-face encounter with the alleged attacker, starting with the defendant allegedly breaking into the home through a rear glass door before finding Mr. Pelosi sleeping on the second floor. 
 
The D.A. saying the suspect woke Pelosi up and forced him out of bed. 
 
Mr. Pelosi attempted to get to an elevator in the home to reach a phone. DePape allegedly blocked him. Pelosi eventually asked the suspect to let him use the bathroom, where he called 911 from his cell phone. 
 
Two minutes after that call, police arrived. When they opened the door, they saw this.
 
JENKINS: The defendant was holding his hammer, which Mr. Pelosi appeared to be attempting to control by holding a portion of that hammer. The defendant then pulled the hammer away from Mr. Pelosi and violently struck him in the top of his head. 
 
CAMPBELL (voice-over): Authorities debunking right-wing conspiracy theories about Pelosi's attack, including that he knew the assailant, and making the suspect's motive crystal-clear.
 
CHIEF WILLIAM SCOTT, SAN FRANCISCO POLICE: There is absolutely no evidence that Mr. Pelosi knew this man. As a matter of fact, the evidence indicates the exact opposite. 
 
JENKINS: It appears as though this was, based on his statements and comments that were made in that house during his encounter with Mr. Pelosi, that this was politically motivated. 
 
CAMPBELL (voice-over): The FBI's criminal complaint revealing the suspect told San Francisco Police of his plans to hold Nancy Pelosi hostage and speak with her.
 
He explained if he lied to him, he planned to break her kneecaps so she would have to be wheeled into Congress, telling police that scene would demonstrate to other members of Congress there were consequences to their actions. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HARLOW: Wow. Unbelievable. Josh, I mean, critically, also, is how is Paul Pelosi doing? Do we have an update from the House speaker? 
 
CAMPBELL (on camera): We do. He remains in intensive care at this hour, recovering from those very serious injuries. 
 
Speaker Pelosi issued a statement last night. I'll read part of it. She says, "Since the horrific attack on Paul early Friday, we've been deluged with thousands of messages conveying concern, prayers, and warm wishes." She says, "We are most grateful." 
 
She goes on to thank the staff at the local trauma center. She says, "Paul is making steady progress on what will be a long recovery process. Our family thanks everyone for their kindness." 
 
And of course, it's so important to point out that, as this family continues to deal with this traumatic experience, there are still people out there, many of them with large political followings, that have been making light and have been making fun of the brutal assault of an 82-year-old man. 
 
Of course, that comes as federal law enforcement continues to warn that, in this era of heated political rhetoric, more violence could be forthcoming -- Poppy. 
 
HARLOW: The numbers certainly show it. The increase is staggering in just the last five years. Josh, thank you very much for that reporting from San Francisco. 
 
COLLINS: And as Josh was just noting, there are people who are mocking this, despite the serious nature of these charges and the details that we're learning about this. 
 
One of those is the Republican candidate for governor in Arizona, Kari Lake, who last night saw this as a laughing matter, essentially.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
KARI LAKE (R), ARIZONA GUBERNATORIAL NOMINEE: It is not impossible to protect our kids at school. They act like it is. Nancy Pelosi, well, she's got protection when she's in D.C. -- apparently her house doesn't have a lot of protection. But --
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
LEMON: Vile. 
 
COLLINS: You see the moderator there laughing, as well --
 
LEMON: Vile.
 
COLLINS: -- covering his face. 
 
Joining us now to discuss this is CNN correspondent Audie Cornish.
 
Audie, thanks for joining us on our first morning. 
 
AUDIE CORNISH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning. 
 
COLLINS: We are learning some new details about this attack and how it unfolded and how, really, this person was plotting to go into Speaker Pelosi home. What do you make of it when you see something like what Kari Lake, how she treats it there? 
 
CORNISH: Yes, I'm actually struck by the fact that law enforcement had to really underscore the facts of the case, right? Because they're aware that they have to refute whatever growing storm there is on social media.
 
And it really distills the challenges that we have, right, as journalists. Which is that, even if you can have the words of the defendant, right, like in court documents, somehow all of that in this sort of postfactual environment is subject to debate. Subject to discussion and subject to speculation, and unfortunately subject to amusement.
 <br>[06:10:00]
 
And when it comes to Kari Lake, I have to be honest, the thing that worries me most is the audience laughter. Not the comment. That's on all of us. You know what I mean?
 
LEMON: If you look at -- we have the video of -- if you could just run the video again. You don't have to put the sound back. You were right. The man sitting next to her --
 
COLLINS: The moderator.
 
LEMON: The moderator is just belly laughing, because he thinks that something like that is funny, and the audience is laughing, as well. 
 
But listen, there have been -- there he is right there when she says it. And you see the guy there. 
 
But here's the thing. There have been some Republicans who have spoken out, Mitch McConnell and others. McCarthy. But for the most part, it's been very muted.
 
And the people who are saying things, like Don Jr., tweeting stuff, that I don't even -- don't even put up the video of it. It is awful what they're doing. You know, underwear and the hammer, you know, and then saying this is open carry. 
 
Why aren't there more Republicans who are adamantly speaking out against this? 
 
CORNISH: You know, that's been a question probably for the last two to three to four years. 
 
I think the issue is constituency. If there has been a radical shift in the base and what appeals to them, you're going to see people basically playing to the crowd. There are votes for this. There's support for this. 
 
And this is some of the stuff, I think, people really need to kind of ask themselves, right? It's not just on the politicians. I think in a way, they're sort of feeding a beast. 
 
COLLINS: Yes. And it's not just people that you're seeing running for office. It's other people who are ultimately in powerful positions. Elon Musk, obviously, is in the middle of his taking over Twitter. What's that's going to look like. 
 
CORNISH: And already tweeted something, right? That he had to --
 
COLLINS: He's one of the people who --
 
LEMON: He had to take it down, yes.
 
COLLINS: -- who suggested more to the story. Basically feeding into these conspiracies, even though they've been refuted by these officials who are working on this case. 
 
CORNISH: And this gets to your point earlier, Don. You know, if you have people in positions of power, and Elon Musk in this point has established himself as a media elite, right, in doing this takeover. They are amplifying and spreading speculation, and entertaining it. 
 
And if people in positions of power and status are doing that, well, then you at home are like, Well, yes. Maybe I should think about X, Y and Z. 
 
LEMON: But they're spreading --
 
CORNISH: That's part of the problem. 
 
LEMON: They're spreading the same -- a conspiracy theory that came from a conspiracy theorist. Right? About Hillary Clinton and that she's actually not alive and that there's a body double. And that's where this conspiracy theory about Paul Pelosi came from.
 
And then they're amplifying it and then laughing about it. 
 
COLLINS: And it comes into the mainstream.
 
LEMON: The mainstream, like the Pizzagate. You know?
 
CORNISH: Right. So I think the thing to think about is, it's an ecosystem that has metastasized. Right? It started off a small thing: Hey, that seems kind of weird. 
 
And now we're in a scenario where you actually have to assume, no matter what the news story is -- it could be a mass shooting, as we've learned. There is a body of people who can spread a good amount of disinformation, speculation, and really rile people up. 
 
COLLINS: And it kind of just speaks to the nature of dehumanizing politicians that we see.
 
CORNISH: Yes. 
 
COLLINS: Audie Cornish, thanks for joining us. 
 
LEMON: Thanks, Audie. Good to see you. Audie's going to be a regular with us. 
 
HARLOW: Friend of the show. 
 
LEMON: We hope that you'll come back, right?
 
CORNISH: Friend of the show. Friend of the show. It's like Maria on "Sesame Street." I just kind of show up.
 
COLLINS: That's true. 
 
LEMON: Thank you. Great to have you. Drink your coffee. 
 
COLLINS: Coffee's on us. 
 
LEMON: Yes. 
 
COLLINS: Up next, we have Pennsylvania Senate candidate John Fetterman who is joining us. It is an interview you're not going to want to miss. He talks about whether or not he would debate Mehmet Oz, if he could do it all over again. And his message to voters who are worried about his health in the closing days of this race.
 
LEMON: Plus, one-on-one with Governor Brian Kemp. See what happened when our very own Kaitlan Collins went to Georgia and asked him about Herschel Walker. 
 
You're watching CNN THIS MORNING, where there is a big sigh of relief in the room, because we got through the first block of the show. 
 
HARLOW: Thirteen minute. We did it!
 
COLLINS: Thirteen whole minutes! 
 
HARLOW: Thirteen minutes. We've got a few more to go. We'll be right back. 
 
LEMON: Whew!
 
HARLOW: Nice "A" block, guys.
 
COLLINS: It feels good when you make it to the first commercial break.
 
HARLOW: Yes. Totally.
 
Audie, quick question for you.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JIMMY KIMMEL, LATE NIGHT TV HOST: The Democrats have deployed Obama on the campaign trail. Tell me you're nervous about the midterms without telling me you're nervous about the midterms. 
 
BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I have to admit that sometimes going out on the campaign trail feels a little harder than it used to. Not just because I'm older and grayer -- 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You're finer than a mug.
 
OBAMA: -- and I'm not going to tell Michelle you said that. Although Michelle does agree. 
 
STEPHEN COLBERT, LATE NIGHT TV HOST: I would like to point out that is two things the 45th president will never have. A crowd shouting how hot he is and a wife who agrees. 
 
KIMMEL: That's the one difference between Obama and Biden. When Obama's onstage, people are like, he is fine. When Biden's on stage, people are like, he's fine. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARLOW: That was my first time seeing almost all those except the Obama clip made my weekend. 
 
LEMON: Yes.
 
HARLOW: Made my -- But I didn't see it, because, you know, it was my young producer who's good on Twitter. 
 
LEMON: I wasn't quite sure what she said. I thought she said you're fine as a -- but it said "mug."
 
COLLINS: Censored.
 
LEMON: Yes.
 
HARLOW: But I think you might be right. 
 
LEMON: I thought she sneezed it (ph).
 
HARLOW: He loved it so much he wanted to hear it again. 
 
COLLINS: It does speak to, though, what these final few days look like for Democrats.
 
LEMON: Yes.
 
COLLINS: They are concerned, clearly. They are having Obama come out.
 
HARLOW: Yes.
 
COLLINS: He's going to a couple states. He's going places that President Biden is not. Obviously, a reflection. He's not in office. A reflection of his approval versus President Biden's. 
 
LEMON: I think it's fair to say Democrats aren't laughing right now. They're very concerned.
 
COLLINS: They're not. They're definitely not.
 
LEMON: So I think we should get to this. 
 
HARLOW: Let's get to it. It's a busy day today again on the campaign trail. Just one week to go until the midterms, exactly a week. 
 
Former President Obama heading in Nevada after stops in Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin. President Biden stumping in Florida today, a trip that overlaps with former President Obama.
 
Also, Wyoming Republican Liz Cheney is crossing the aisle, and she is going to endorse and go on the campaign trail with Michigan Democrat Elissa Slotkin, who will join us live a little bit later in the show.
 <br>[06:20:05]
 
Also, the former vice president, Mike Pence, in Georgia to campaign for Governor Brian Kemp, who will also join us on this show. 
 
LEMON: Yes. One week exactly until election day. 
 
HARLOW: Here we go. 
 
LEMON: So as the Senate race in Pennsylvania heats up, John Fetterman is facing real questions about his health after his debate performance that had a lot of people talking. Even he admits that. 
 
I spoke with him candidly about his chances of winning and his concerns about political violence in America. And I have to note here, we did conduct the interview using closed captioning. So that's why there's a bit of delay with some of the answers. Watch. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
LEMON: Joining me now is Democratic candidate for senator, Pennsylvania Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman. 
 
Thank you for joining us, Lieutenant Governor. I really appreciate it. 
 
Let me start with the aftermath of the violent attack on the House speaker's husband at their home. What do the attack and the subsequent conspiracy theories say about the state of our politics right now? 
 
LT. GOV. JOHN FETTERMAN (D-PA), PENNSYLVANIA GUBERNATORIAL NOMINEE: Yes. I just -- of course, I was appalled by that, and, of course, the kind of vitriol that is out there in -- in the political conversation out in America now is astonishing. It's unconscionable. 
 
LEMON: Elon Musk pushing conspiracy theories about Paul Pelosi and the attack on him. What is your message to him as he takes over this giant megaphone that is Twitter? 
 
FETTERMAN: No. I just am really just about just saying that -- that I just want to make sure that we use your enormous -- your enormous power to just make sure that, you know, we don't have the kind of platform where we push those kinds of theories.
 
And I'm just grateful for the opportunity to just say that, you know, given that we have this opportunity, you know, just using -- using the platform to really be about a force of good. LEMON: Let's turn to your race now. The day after your debate with Dr.
 
 Mehmet Oz, you acknowledged that it wasn't easy to be up on that stage. You said that yourself. A week later, are you happy you did it? 
 
FETTERMAN: No. I just always understood that it wasn't going to be easy. I mean, I'm five months into recovery from that, but I thought it was important that I show up. And -- and I did.
 
And at the end of the day, we did, I think, made some important points, it's well true. And I think it also, you know, reminded Dr. Oz the fact that he still believes, you know, with the same kind of abortion thoughts, with Doug Mastriano, who believes that local political leaders are the -- need to be part of the decision between women and their doctors, is well true. 
 
LEMON: Lieutenant Governor, you said the other night at a fund-raiser with president Biden that you would be better in January. Do you and your doctors think that you will have a full recovery by then? 
 
FETTERMAN: Yes. I'm sorry. I -- I do believe that I continue to get, and feel better and better. 
 
LEMON: Listen, we've heard a little from your doctor, but we haven't heard a lot. You're asking voters to trust you on your word that your health is good, without the full story. 
 
So in the interest of full transparency for the voters, do you think it would help if you let your doctors brief the press before election night? 
 
FETTERMAN: I think we've been pretty transparent. You know, we've had our doctors just be very clear that they're here, that we're able to, and fit, to serve.
 
And from my point, you know, we've been also, been very transparent in terms of showing up at a debate and very transparent about, you know, having events in front of thousands and thousands of Pennsylvanians for months.
 
And I was again, it was no secret that I was going to miss some words. I was going to mush some words together. And as we've been very clear in the debate and during this -- this interview, I've been using captioning is well true. I believe we've been pretty transparent to give all the voters to make it their -- their choice. 
 
LEMON: Listen, I'm asking a question for the voters. Because voters may -- may wonder is there a reason that you don't want your doctors to take questions? That's why I keep asking this. 
 
FETTERMAN: Oh, I just -- I just believe that we have our doctors just weigh in on that, and they believe that I'm fit, fit to serve. And that's -- that's -- a point that was compatible, made in June, and compatible here just in October.
 
And, you know, I choose, the -- you know, my real doctors composed of some of the criticism from, like, a real Dr. Oz, that's just trying to weaponize somebody that just, you know, had a -- had a stroke. 
 <br>[06:25:04]
 
LEMON: Yes. Well, listen, it leads me to my next question, because -- which is an important one, I believe, because you've been dealing with things that a lot of Americans deal with. 
 
Have your health issues impacted your approach to policy and what you would do in Washington? And given -- has it given you any real insight, or new insight, I should say, into the country's healthcare system? 
 
FETTERMAN: Absolutely. I've been really connecting with people all across America -- excuse me, all across Pennsylvania. Actually, America. I've heard from people from all across that have been either inspired or they support that I'm leaning in. 
 
And I think it's made me very empathetic about more than I even thought I was before.
 
But now believing that the kind of health care that saved my life could be the same health care that it should be for any -- every American. That's it's needed there to save their life. 
 
I believe that health care is a basic fundamental human right, and now it's brought to a very, very specific kind of relief, to me, you know, having -- having my crisis, that every American should have those same kind of opportunities to have that kind of health care, you know, have it be there. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
LEMON: Look, we have more of the Fetterman interview coming up throughout the hours here on CNN this morning. 
 
But just so everyone knows at home, our team has been in touch with Dr. Oz, with the Oz campaign. Numerous times, we've put in requests. So far, they have said no; they've declined. We would love for him to join us on CNN THIS MORNING --
 
HARLOW: Yes.
 
LEMON: -- before the election. 
 
FETTERMAN: Any time, any day. 
 
LEMON: Yes.
 
HARLOW: It would be great to have him.
 
COLLINS: This interview was really interesting, though, because that has been one of the biggest questions since that debate. It's their only debate that they were going to have. Of whether or not Fetterman should have done it. There were some even Democrats that we had heard from who said they thought maybe he should have not done it. But he was saying there that he basically made the argument that he
 
 believed it was better to come out and be transparent. We'll find out if it paid off in about a week. 
 
LEMON: It's interesting. He doesn't believe, in the interview that it has hurt him. And I don't know if they have internal polling that shows that, but he says my polling shows that -- that having that debate hasn't hurt. 
 
But it's interesting. When you talk to people, they say, you know, it's not a big deal. People often say things to people who are doing polling, that they don't necessarily, doesn't mean that they're going to vote that way. But I always say that my mother is my one-woman focus group. 
 
HARLOW: Yes, and what'd she say?
 
LEMON: She said I was expecting worse, having dealt with people who did stroke. I did not think he did badly at all, as you know, the press has been putting out. She said she thought he did fine.
 
But, again, the people of Pennsylvania will decide this. 
 
And I have to be quite honest. I didn't have the same reaction as most people, Most people are like, Oh, my gosh, I can't believe it. You know, Oz is, you know, doing such a great job. 
 
Dr. Oz, of course, is a smart man and did a great job. But I actually thought, I was expecting worse --
 
HARLOW: You were.
 
LEMON: -- from Fetterman. I was. And I think that people will be more empathetic than we in the media may be letting on to, because they have people who have dealt with these issues. 
 
Again, that doesn't mean that they're -- they would vote for him. He is running to be a senator, and that's a -- you know, that's a big job. 
 
HARLOW: And this is -- look, this is, his health issue is a real issue. It matters. It is sucking a lot of the oxygen in the conversation. But what I like about your interview that our viewers are going to see ahead, you go into some of the really key issues. Like energy. Like fracking. A lot of the issues, and press him on him. 
 
LEMON: You can hear about that.
 
COLLINS: And that's why that's so important. Because it's not just about --
 
HARLOW: It's not.
 
COLLINS: -- the debate and what happened there. It's how he would actually govern --

COLLINS: That doesn't apply to the three of us at all.
 
HARLOW: Change? For instance, how being part of a new "way too early" morning show can be absolutely frightening.
 
LEMON: This is nothing.
 
HARLOW: Our Dr. Sanjay Gupta is here to talk about it.
