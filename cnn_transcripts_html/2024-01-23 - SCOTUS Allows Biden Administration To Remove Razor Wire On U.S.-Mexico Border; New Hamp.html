POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR:  The Supreme Court handing the Biden administration a big win at the southern border, allowing U.S. Border Patrol agents to remove that razor wire ordered to be installed by Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott as part of his controversial security initiative on the border. This was a 5-4 ruling. You had Roberts ruling with the liberals.
 
This comes days after three migrants drowned in a section of the Rio Grande where state officials blocked U.S. border agents access.
 
Rosa Flores live with us on the ground this morning where you can really tell what this Supreme Court decision is going to mean on the ground there and for the record number of border crossings that we continue to see.
 
ROSA FLORES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Poppy, we just gained access to Shelby Park and you can see that the razor wire is still here. We have not seen a change in posture on behalf of Texas authorities.
 
Now, U.S. Border Patrol is reading this order. They're reviewing it, trying to figure out exactly what it means. That's according to a law enforcement source. And the U.S. DOJ has not commented yet. 
 
But to really understand what's going on here on the southern border we've got to go back to the original case that was filed by the state of Texas last year. The case -- according to that case, the state of Texas claimed that U.S. Border Patrol was destroying public property owned by the state of Texas because it was cutting some of this razor wire that you're taking a look at to apprehend migrants. 
 
Now, the state of Texas took it to an appeals court. The appeals court granted the state of Texas a preliminary injunction. And that is when the Biden administration took this fight to the U.S. Supreme Court arguing that border security is a federal function, that immigration is a federal function, and that border patrol agents need access to these areas in order for them to enforce federal law. And that they can't do that if all of this razor wire is still here. Well, all of this took great prominence in the last two weeks when the state of Texas took over this park, blocking Border Patrol. That's when those three migrants drowned. 
 <br>[07:35:01]
 
Now, the state of Texas doubling down on this even though the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Biden administration, saying in a statement, quote -- and this is from Gov. Greg Abbott -- "I will continue to defend Texas' constitutional authority to secure the border and prevent the Biden administration from destroying our property."
 
Now, DHS also issued a statement saying, in part, quote, "Rather than helping to reduce irregular migration, the state of Texas has only made it harder for frontline personnel to do their jobs and to apply consequences under the law."
 
Now, Poppy, here's the irony of all of this. Governor Greg Abbott is saying that the Biden administration is not enforcing federal law. Well, Border Patrol is blocked from this area making it impossible for them to enforce federal law -- Poppy. 
 
HARLOW:  Wow, to do what the Supreme Court says they can do now. 
 
Rosa Flores, thank you very much.
 
Back here in New Hampshire, most of the polling locations in the Granite State are open now this morning. The impact these voters will have on the future of this country. 
 
And Donald Trump could be poised to lock up the GOP nomination with a win tonight if that happens. What is it about Trump that is pulling voters in his direction? Our John King all over the map speaking with voters. He's with us next.

KASIE HUNT, CNN ANCHOR, "EARLY START":  Welcome back to Manchester, New Hampshire. 
 
CNN is talking to voters about who they're going to be supporting -- Nikki Haley or Donald Trump -- as the primary here kicks off this morning. 
 
And in the field of two, Trump's dominance is infuriating those who oppose him in the Granite State. The bottom line, some say it's issues like immigration and their financial well-being that's pulling them aboard the Trump train in spite of the nonstop drama and even with the possibility of him going to prison. 
 <br>[07:40:09]
 
CNN's chief national correspondent John King -- he spoke with many of these voters and here's what they told him. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JOHN KING, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Late morning off the dock -- gone maybe one day, maybe two or more. 
 
ANDREW KONCHEK, NEW HAMPSHIRE REPUBLICAN VOTER:  That's where your fish comes from. 
 
J. KING (voice-over):  Andrew Konchek's job depends on the water and the weather.
 
KONCHEK:  Yeah, it's a little colder. Definitely, a little colder, but you get used to it.
 
J. KING (voice-over):  Alanna Renee drops these gill nets overnight and pulls them out in the morning. 
 
Konchek was likely Trump but looking at Ron DeSantis.
 
KONCHEK:  I'd have to, like, look into it more.
 
J. KING (voice-over):  Now, time to choose.
 
KONCHEK:  I'm with Trump because he supports fishermen and this obviously is my livelihood. 
 
J. KING (voice-over):  Loyal to Trump despite stuff that offends him.
 
KONCHEK:  I don't like the way that he speaks sometimes. He can be a little ignorant and rude.
 
J. KING (voice-over):  Loyal to Trump despite a wife who backs Nikki Haley.
 
J. KING (on camera):  When you hang your Trump flag what does she say?
 
KONCHEK:  She said I was ruining Christmas and wanted me to take it down. And she took it down and I put it back up.
 
J. KING (VOICE-OVER):  Pete Burdett's Haley sign is surrounded by snow now -- the same spot as when we visited in September. Haley was a longshot then -- perhaps the only shot to stop Trump now.
 
J. KING (on camera):  She has Trump's attention.
 
PETE BURDETT, NEW HAMPSHIRE REPUBLICAN VOTER:  Well, she certainly does. I think there's a very real opportunity for Nikki to squeak out a percentage point on top of Trump, and wouldn't that shake the rafters?
 
J. KING (voice-over):  To Burdett, a no-brainer.
 
BURDETT:  Who really can beat Biden? Who lost to Biden last time? Trump did. 
 
J. KING (voice-over):  The possibility is obvious but so are the challenges. Trouble winning over Chris Christie voters because she says she would pardon Trump. Trouble winning over Independents like Stanley Tremblay. 
 
Tremblay told us in September his disgust with both parties makes him a likely third-party voter in November. He could still help Haley Tuesday. He took a break from trivia night at his Nashua brewery to make clear he won't. 
 
J. KING (on camera):  I know you're not a Trump fan, fair?
 
STANLEY TREMBLAY, OWNER, LIQUID THERAPY BREWERY:  Yeah, fair.
 
J. KING (on camera):  If you came up the sidelines you could help Nikki Haley.
 
TREMBLAY:  I could. I could.
 
J. KING (on camera):  But you don't see it as worth it. Why?
 
TREMBLAY:  Because I don't really -- I don't feel like I trust her enough yet to be able to give her my vote.
 
J. KING (voice-over):  Trump's resilience infuriates his critics. Yes, many supporters imitate his crude tactics and repeat his lies, but it's not that simple. 
 
J. KING (on camera):  Who won the 2020 election? 
 
DEBBIE KATSANOS, NEW HAMPSHIRE REPUBLICAN VOTER:  Oh, it was Biden. 
 
J. KING (voice-over):  Debbie Katsanos is an accountant and voted for Bill Clinton twice, but is a Trump Republican now. 
 
J. KING (on camera):  What are the one or two things you want the federal government to do ASAP?
 
KATSANOS:  Close the border and get this economy going. 
 
J. KING (voice-over):  Not a Joe Biden fan. 
 
KATSANOS:  And he's gotten -- been caught in a lot of lies. I don't like him as a politician.
 
J. KING (on camera):  Been caught in a lot of lies?
 
KATSANOS:  Yep. 
 
J. KING (on camera):  Trump's not known as the world's greatest truthteller.
 
KATSANOS:  No, no.
 
J. KING (on camera):  So why is it disqualifying for Biden but it's OK for Trump?
 
KATSANOS:  I don't like politicians and I don't think Trump's a -- well, I don't think one term made him a politician because I still -- I don't think he plays the game. J. KING (voice-over):  That is the code Trump critics have yet to crack -- his support among those who don't deny election results. Those who don't like the drama but do like the policy.
 
DEVEN MCIVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE REPUBLICAN VOTER:  I know he'll fix the border. He'll work on the economy. With Trump, I was doing pretty good. I was able to save more.
 
J. KING (voice-over):  The more north you go, the more New Hampshire voters on the Trump train. 
 
Deven McIver works construction, turning giant slabs of rock into gravel.
 
MCIVER:  This is all the prep work before the busy season. 
 
J. KING (voice-over):  In 2008, an Obama voter. A Trump supporter since the 2016 primary here.
 
J. KING (on camera):  If he gets convicted of mishandling classified documents he could go to jail for that.
 
MCIVER:  Then he goes to jail. I guess he won't be president. 
 
J. KING (voice-over):  Yes, a Trump voter, but with eyes wide open.
 
MCIVER:  He is definitely different. Sometimes he's not his own best friend, but he's different.
 
J. KING (on camera):  But that's what I was getting at when I was asking you about the price of admission. I mean, yeah, there's a -- there's a lot of extra that comes with him.
 
MCIVER:  It's a show.
 
J. KING (on camera):  But that doesn't bother you?
 
MCIVER:  No, no. Because we have other branches of government to deal with it. They can keep him in line. He can't have everything he wants. 
 
J. KING (voice-over):  McIver makes $40,000 a year -- just enough, he says, to take care of his family and save a little. Another Trump tax cut for his boss, he says, would be worth all the Trump chaos. 
 
MCIVER:  If the business climate is better towards people like him, I do better. Because if he didn't hit them harder with taxes it takes away from me. 
 
J. KING (voice-over):  Andrew Konchek shares that same blue-collar bottom line. 
 
J. KING (on camera):  Do you think it's over if he wins here?
 
KONCHEK:  Yeah -- oh, yeah.
 
J. KING (voice-over):  Trump, he believes, will win the primary, win in November, and save his job. 
 
KONCHEK:  He's kind of a bully. I'll give you that. 
 
J. KING (on camera):  But you think he fights for you?
 
KONCHEK:  I do.
 
J. KING (on camera):  Yeah?
 
KONCHEK:  Yeah.
 
J. KING (voice-over):  So it's worth all the drama if it keeps him on the water.

 <br>[07:45:06]
 
HUNT:  John, I cannot believe that Deven let you drive that thing, first of all. I mean, he rode in it with you while you were driving it. My 4-year-old son is going to be really jealous if I show him that.
 
J. KING:  You need a plan B. You always -- you always need a plan B --
 
HUNT:  These Republicans -- 
 
J. KING:  -- Kasie, just in case.
 
HUNT:  Fair enough.
 
These Republicans -- they're not the Republicans of yore. I'll be honest. Being up here in New Hampshire I feel like I found a lot more Republicans like the ones that I used --
 
J. KING:  Right.
 
HUNT:  -- to hear from at Nikki Haley events. This is a different profile.
 
J. KING:  Yes, that Trump has remade the Republican Party. When you talk to these people you just see it. Even those who don't wear red MAGA hats, who don't sit by the side of the road on weekends, like Deven McIver. 
 
Look, they have become transactional just like their candidate. They don't trust this town. And in many ways, some of them don't even trust him. They don't even trust him. But they know he will fix the border -- they believe from their hearts -- and they think they will end up with more money in their bank accounts if he is president.
 
How many days, Kasie, have you come to work thinking I want the government to give my boss a tax cut? Did you hear Deven McIver there? He wants his boss to get a tax cut from Trump because he thinks that means he might get a modest raise and they'll have safer equipment. They'll buy new equipment and have safer equipment on the job site. It's all transactional. They don't like Washington. They don't think
 
 it works. And they think Trump, at least, will do a couple of things that help them and that's enough.
 
HUNT:  Really fascinating stuff, John. I've honestly loved all of these pieces that you have done. It's a great service to all of us, so thank you very much. Phil, back to you.
 
J. KING:  Thank you.
 
MATTINGLY:  Well, thanks, Kasie.
 
There is still no deal on border funding this morning but some senators are beginning to show cautious optimism. Senator Angus King joins us next to discuss the latest on the negotiations.
 
(COMMERCIAL)
 <br>[07:50:27]
 
MATTINGLY:  Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer warned that negotiations on a border security deal are still ongoing but there is some optimism that the legislation could be unveiled as early as this week. Negotiators have been working on a deal that would involve raising the quote "credible fear threshold" for individuals seeking asylum in the U.S., curtail the administration's use of granting parole, and give the U.S. greater ability to swiftly deport migrants at the border.
 
Sources tell CNN that progress has been made and that most of the policy details have been ironed out, but there are hurdles that remain.
 
Joining us now is Sen. Angus King. He's an Independent from Maine. He sits on the Intelligence and Armed Services committees. 
 
Senator, you are always involved in complex moments like this. You have proposed your own immigration legislation and been deeply involved in the issue itself.
 
Do you think that there's an outcome that can be reached here?
 
SEN. ANGUS KING (I-ME) (via Webex by Cisco):  I think we're very close. The negotiations are being led by two very able senators -- James Lankford, a Republican of Oklahoma; and Chris Murphy, a Democrat of Connecticut. And they have really been working pretty much nonstop every day. I texted James Lankford during the Christmas vacation and said how are you doing? And his response was "tired." 
 
So I know that they've been on this and it looks like the strongest border control piece of legislation in something like 40 years. And if we can get there and then in the process also do the Ukraine and Israel aid and humanitarian aid, it will be good for the world and good for the country, particularly to take care of this border issue.
 
MATTINGLY:  I want to delve in a little bit more on Ukraine in a moment. But I do want to ask you -- there's been so much talk about what Republicans will do here. What House Republicans will do. If they'd move on it if a deal is reached. What the former president would do.
 
Where are Democrats? Do you have a sense of where the Democratic caucus is? Because where negotiations have gone on a policy basis are in a much different place than the Democratic Party has been for years leading up to now. 
 
A. KING:  Yeah, I think that's a really good question. It's not going to be an easy sell in either caucus because it does involve some fundamental changes that the Democrats have resisted. 
 
But I think the Democrats have come to realize that there really is a problem. That this isn't something that is made up. That when you get 8,000, 10,000, 12,000 people a day it just is overwhelming and it's something that we have to attend to. 
 
So my sense of being in those meetings is there is a realization that we should be doing this anyway. It's not being done simply grudgingly in order to get the rest of the supplemental passed, but it's something that is important to do just because -- well, here's a -- here's a good example. The primary issue, as you know, Phil, is asylum.
 
MATTINGLY:  Right.
 
A. KING:  And people come to the border and they say I have a credible fear of persecution in my home country, and they get into the country. And then it takes years to process whether that claim is valid or not.
 
MATTINGLY:  Right.
 
A. KING:  Eighty-five percent of the claims are ultimately denied, which means the filter at the border isn't very good. And that's what the focus of this bill is.
 
MATTINGLY:  Is this the only vehicle for which Ukraine aid could move? I know it's part of the supplemental package. It's part of a national security supplemental package that has been the idea to have all these things together, with Israel aid as well. But is it basically this moves immigration and you get a deal and you move it forward, or Ukraine aid does not get through?
 
A. KING:  That's what the Republicans in the Senate have basically said. They said that a month ago -- no aid for Ukraine without a border deal. And so, that's where these negotiations have led.
 
We've got to talk about Ukraine, though. If we don't do Ukraine aid it will be a geopolitical mistake that will haunt this country for 50 years.
 
MATTINGLY:  To that point, someone was asking me the other day what the outlook for this package was and I said honestly, having covered the place for 15 years, I'm not totally sure -- and usually, I have a good idea mostly because of immigration. But the irony here is Ukraine would probably have 75 votes in the
 
 Senate; 350, easy, in the House as a standalone. And yet, why are we at this place given the stakes that you're laying out?
 
A. KING:  Well, again, part of it is politics. 
 
Going back to the border for a minute, I think this is going to be a real test for some of my Republican colleagues, particularly in the House. Do they want a border solution or do they want the problem in order to use it as a political issue throughout the rest of this year? 
 <br>[07:55:00]
 
This is, I think -- as several people have pointed out, this is a historic opportunity to really get something done that may not come around again. My experience around here is that timing is everything and when you have something that's on the cusp of actually going into law you should grab it even though it may be 80-90 percent of what you want, not 100 percent of what you want. 
 
Ukraine is the same way. As you say, there are, I think, strong majorities in both Houses --
 
MATTINGLY:  Right.
 
A. KING:  -- that's been tied up with the border issue. But the problem if we don't do Ukraine is not a problem, it's an understatement. Our allies are going to question us around the world. China is watching this like a hawk. Russia is watching it like a hawk. It would -- our allies, Japan and South Korea, have to talk about well, can we really trust the Americans?
 
MATTINGLY:  Right.
 
A. KING:  And, Phil, the asymmetric advantage America has is its allies. And to lose them over this and to walk away from people who are literally fighting for our values of democracy and freedom would just be not only tragic, but it's just, as I said, a huge mistake.
 
MATTINGLY:  Yeah, the stakes are enormous.
 
Senator Angus King, we always appreciate your time, sir. Thank you.
 
A. KING:  Thank you, Phil.
 
MATTINGLY:  Over to you, Poppy.
 
HARLOW:  All right, Phil. Thank you. 
 
We are live here in Manchester, New Hampshire as the nation's first presidential primary is now underway. The majority of polls in the state open. This is CNN THIS MORNING's special live coverage. Back in a moment.
