(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ERICA HILL, CNN HOST, CONNECT THE WORLD: Hello and welcome to our viewers around the world. I'm Erica Hill in New York. This is "Connect the World". 
 
 Just to have this hour delicate diplomacy. The U.S. Secretary of State is in Saudi Arabia before heading to Jordan and Israel. Can Antony Blinken 
 
 make any progress on a ceasefire deal?
 
And universities across the United States and around the world grappling with how to handle protests over the war in Gaza that full report, is 
 
 coming up. Plus dozens are killed after heavy rains in Kenya cause a dam to burst we are live in one of those hardest hit areas this hour.
 
Negotiations for a long awaited and desperately needed ceasefire are set to be gaining momentum on what is the U.S. Secretary of State, now seventh 
 
 visits to the region since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. Antony Blinken meeting with regional foreign ministers and other top diplomats at 
 
 especial world economic forum meeting in Riyadh.
 
It will all happening, of course, is a Hamas delegation and is meeting with negotiators in Cairo to discuss a new framework for a ceasefire, Blinken, 
 
 urging Hamas to accept that deal.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: A major effort that's been made over the last couple of months to get to that ceasefire, to get the 
 
 hostages out. And right now, as you said, Hamas has before it a proposal that is extraordinarily, extraordinarily generous on the part of Israel. 
 
 And in this moment, the only thing standing between the people of Gaza and a ceasefire is Hamas.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HILL: Blinken comments coming a day after the U.S. and Israeli leaders held what is described as a constructive phone call, which focuses on securing 
 
 the release of Israeli hostages. And as talks continue, Rafah still being targeted by Israeli airstrikes ahead of a promise is really ground 
 
 incursion.
 
Hospital officials their report at least 20 people killed, including an infant and a toddler. Arlette Saenz is at the White House this hour with 
 
 more. Arlette, good to see you, bring us up to speed on that conversation.
 
ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Erica, President Biden spent just under an hour on the phone with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin 
 
 Netanyahu yesterday and a source familiar with the call tells us that the majority of the conversation was around those hostage negotiations.
 
You really in recent days have heard us officials speaking in optimistic tones about the prospects for some type of deal. A senior U.S. official 
 
 just a few days ago said that they do believe there is an avenue towards a deal. And as you heard there from Secretary of State Antony Blinken, as he 
 
 traveled in Saudi Arabia.
 
He said that Israel has presented a rather generous proposal to Hamas, and that the onus is now on Hamas to accept these terms. Now, Hamas officials 
 
 are currently in Cairo where they will be meeting with Egyptian and Qatari mediators about a potential framework for a deal.
 
Sources tell our colleagues in the region that this could lead to the release of as many as 33 hostages over the course of several weeks with an 
 
 accompanying ceasefire to take place and an exchange of those hostages for some Palestinian prisoners that Israel currently has, as well.
 
Now it comes as the U.S. has insisted that they have the kept the hostages a top priority in recent months and most recently, Hamas had released to 
 
 proof of life videos of two of the five American hostages who are still believed to be living in Gaza. So the administration has been hopeful that 
 
 there could be some type of movement and part of what Blinken will be doing while he is in the Middle East this week, which will include stops in 
 
 Jordan.
 
And Israel is to once again push for these hostages negotiate for this hostage deal and also trying to get more humanitarian aid in, in exchange 
 
 for that ceasefire. Now, the President in his phone call with Netanyahu also brought up that proposed Israeli operation into Rafah.
 
A White House readout of the call said that the President made clear his position when it comes to Rafah at a time when U.S. officials have been 
 
 warning for quite some time that any operation must ensure that it's protecting and ensuring the safe evacuation of the civilians that are in 
 
 Rafah.
 
There's more than 1 million Palestinian civilians are currently in that area. And the U.S. has been pressing on their Israeli counterparts to take 
 
 the concerns of those civilians into account as they are planning this operation. 
 
Now White House Senior Spokesperson John Kirby over the weekend said that Israel has told the U.S. that they will ensure that they give the U.S. time 
 
 to voice their concerns before they start any operation in to Rafah. And the President did make his clear his position when he spoke with Netanyahu 
 
 yesterday.
 <br>[09:05:00]
 
So it's comes as The administration has those concerns about Rafah but also is trying to secure the release of these hostages and they're hopeful that 
 
 with Blinken in the area this week that maybe there could be some progress on that front.
 
HILL: All right. Arlette, we'll be watching all of it very closely. Appreciate it. Thank you. Is Israel using American provided weapons in 
 
 accordance with international law? The sources, that question is currently dividing the U.S. State Department. All countries receiving U.S. weapons 
 
 must make assurances that they are in fact using them in a matter consistent with human rights law.
 
Next week, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken -- tell Congress if he finds Israel's assurances credible. Kylie Atwood joining us with more on 
 
 this now from the State Department so, Kylie brings us up to speed here in terms of those concerns about how Israel is in fact using these weapons.
 
KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, that's right. So as you said, the State Department our reporting is that they are divided on 
 
 this topic. There isn't a consensus opinion as to whether the assurances from Israel, that they are using American made weapons in accordance with 
 
 international law are frankly legitimate.
 
That's according to a State Department official, who spoke with our colleague, Jennifer Hansler. And the context here is that the Biden 
 
 administration, President Biden signed a national security memorandum late last year that requires all of the countries that are using American made 
 
 weapons to provide assurances that they are, in fact using those weapons in a credible way.
 
And then the State Department assesses what has been provided to them from those countries. Now, after that is done, it's the Secretary of State who 
 
 has to make an assessment as to the credibility and reliability of those reports coming from those countries, and then provides his assessment to 
 
 Congress.
 
That is due next week on May 8, so all of this is going to come to ahead when we see what the final assessment that the State Department provides to 
 
 Congress actually looks like. And we should know that State Department Spokesperson Matt Miller, when he was asked about this reporting, that 
 
 there isn't a consensus opinion on this right now, said that the State Department doesn't speak to classified documents that are purportedly 
 
 leaked out.
 
He also said that when there are these complicated topics, it's not a typical for the Secretary to receive a diverse number of opinions on it. So 
 
 essentially saying that, you know, dissents from within disagreements are normal when they're trying to determine the right decision on a certain 
 
 policy, a certain determination.
 
So we'll have to watch and see where this goes. But this is obviously the backdrop, as you guys were just talking about while the Secretary is in 
 
 Saudi Arabia right now, trying to push ahead, that ceasefire and of course secure the release of more hostages.
 
HILL: Yeah, as you point out, the sources saying that is not unusual. I'm paraphrasing here, obviously, for there to be differences of opinion. 
 
 What's interesting is how increasingly public some of that is becoming. Kylie appreciated. Thank you. Here in the U.S. continued unrest on college 
 
 campuses with pro-Palestinian protests at a growing number of universities, the situation actually turning violent over the weekend at UCLA.
 
On Sunday, physical altercations broke out between rival protest groups. That UCLA official saying the university is heartbroken about the violence. 
 
 And also security measures have been increasing. CNN's Camila Bernal is outside there at UCLA's campus with more for us at this hour. Camila, were 
 
 to think stand still early in the morning, of course, in Los Angeles, but quite a weekend?
 
CAMILA BERNAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely, quite a weekend, Erica. It is quiet here now. And what you're seeing here behind me, that is the 
 
 encampment. It is obviously covered by that plywood that a lot of the protesters put up yesterday and the metal barriers, that is what the 
 
 university tried to use to keep these two groups of protesters separately.
 
It was when the two came together in some parts of the university when they clashed and when things got violent. They were yelling at each other, they 
 
 were pushing each other at times. It was violent, both verbally and physically. You know, we were here all day long and saw those tensions and 
 
 that energy from a lot of these protesters.
 
We spoke to people on both sides of this issue. And you know when I asked about the violence, when I would ask the pro-Palestinian group about the 
 
 violence that we were seeing, what they kept pointing me to what was going on in Gaza and then when I would speak to the pro-Israeli protesters here 
 
 and ask them about the violence.
 
What they would say is that they are not backing down. Take a listen to part of the conversation that I had with people on both sides of this 
 
 issue.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ELI TSIVES, FRESHMAN JEWISH STUDENT LEADER AT UCLA: The only people that are calling for aggression are the people hiding behind those masks, 
 
 because they are too afraid to show their face. Do you see anyone here with a mask on this side of the protest? No, because we stand with what we 
 
 believe in.
 
THAWRA KHALID, PALESTINIAN YOUTH MOVEMENT: They terrorize us all the time and they censor us.
 <br>[09:10:00]
 
Students are constantly getting dogs, if they're going to attack us, we're not going to back down, but we're going to take precautions.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BERNAL: Now, the university policy is not involving police officers unless they feel that the safeties of the students are at risk. So what we saw 
 
 here was a lot of security guards, who would essentially push back on those protesters at some point, and they had their bikes lined up to separate and 
 
 divide those two groups.
 
And that's the time when we saw less of those physical altercations. Now, the university saying they're heartbroken and saying that they have added 
 
 more of those security officers. And eventually, yesterday, those protesters were pushed out of campus by those security guards, but we did 
 
 see campus police in riot gear who were essentially helping those security guards, but they did not get involved with the protesters.
 
Again, today, you're still having the people inside of the encampment. And then in front of me, there is one tent in terms of the pro-Israeli 
 
 supporters. I don't know if it's going to grow throughout the day. Again, it is very early and quiet at the moment. But we'll have to wait and see 
 
 what happens for the rest of the day, Erica.
 
HILL: Absolutely, keeping a close eye on that campus there and of course, a number of other campuses that we've seen across the city, not sure if 
 
 you've had a chance to ask officials there. But, are they concerned or even perhaps coordinating speaking with other university officials in the 
 
 Southern California area at this point?
 
BERNAL: It's unclear if the university they're communicating with each other. But of course, when I talk to some of the protesters that are inside 
 
 of the encampment, they say that they have made their demands clear to the UC system, saying things like they're looking for divestment when it comes 
 
 to companies that are either linked to Israel or profiting from the war.
 
They want the transparency. So it's similar demands that you're hearing from universities all over the country. I have not heard of progress here 
 
 at the UCLA or at the UC system. Of course, we'll waiting to hear what the university has to say.
 
HILL: Yeah, absolutely, Camila. Appreciate the reporting. Thank you. Buried in the mud, dozens are dead after a dam burst in Kenya and that number many 
 
 fear will raise. We're going to see you live to the scene. Plus, in Eastern Ukraine, Russia's Defense Ministry says it is now making gains on the front 
 
 lines, Ukraine is responding after the break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HILL: A desperate search in Southern Kenya digging through debris following a dam bursts which at least water is so powerful. You can actually see here 
 
 the aftermath. They toppled trees cars entire homes swept away. The region has endured weeks of heavy rains and flooding killing more than 100 people 
 
 and it is feared many more are buried in the mud.
 
CNN's Larry Madowo is on the scene of this devastation. Larry brings us up to speed as to where things stand at this hour.
 <br>[09:15:00]
 
LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: We saw some serious flash flooding here overnight and entire homes were swept away with a car that was swept away 
 
 hundreds of meters away permanent homes when nothing is left except the foundation. And here's the thing. It's raining again. I'm standing in one 
 
 of the places that the water just went right through uprooted trees.
 
There's a tree by the side of the road here. The only reason why it's there is because it was blocked by the fence. There have been frantic search and 
 
 rescue operations throughout the day to try and pull up survivors so far in this region in Mai Mahiu, just about 30 miles northwest of Kenya.
 
35 people have been confirmed dead, but the Governor of Nakuru County telling CNN that the actual death toll could be several dozens more. They 
 
 just don't know for sure, because in this valley down here and heading down that way, they are still people feared still trapped under the rubble and 
 
 they may not be able to pull them out because they are trying to go to places where they it's easiest to get people out to pull survivors, send 
 
 them to hospital.
 
This is probably the worst devastation that Kenya has seen since these rains began back in March. Across the nation, more than 100 people have 
 
 been killed. And the government has had to postpone the reopening of schools for at least a week nationwide to avoid endangering the lives of 
 
 learners.
 
But here we've met people who've lost family members. One man whose car was slipped down this way said his wife escaped, but he's missing two children 
 
 and his mother and is not sure where they are. And these are stories you're hearing all across the nation as these rains are forecast to continue.
 
But Kenya Met Department says they're still heavy to very heavy rainfall expected for still some time to come. The government has set up a multi-
 
 agency team to try and take care of people but also wanting people in places where they're likely to flood to move to higher ground.
 
HILL: It is just devastating. The pictures are really something in the fact that they're of course the threat is not over yet, Larry, appreciate it. 
 
 Thank you. Russia's Defense Ministry says it is making gains in Eastern Ukraine taking over a village in the Donetsk region. Putin's tactical 
 
 advances are now daily and while those gains may be modest.
 
They have increased since the fall of the industrial town of Avdiivka in February. For its part, Ukraine's army chief says the situation on the 
 
 frontline has escalated, while cautioning the circumstances are dynamic and changing every day. CNN's Clare Sebastian is live now in London with more.
 
There is some back and forth. But there's also a lot of concern about what this could mean, especially now that we are firmly in spring.
 
CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely, Erica, and I think what you see playing out is the profound impact of the delay in the delivery of 
 
 these U.S. weapons, that long debate of a month in Congress, Ukraine has gone through a switch from a situation where there was essentially 
 
 stalemate on those frontlines to Russia clearly having the advantage and as you say, these are small parcels of land.
 
There's that village near Bakhmut -- that Russia claims to have taken northwest of Avdiivka, Ukraine's commander in chief of the army, Oleksandr 
 
 Syrskyi of the weekend, also saying that they had to pull back from a cluster of three villages in that area to preserve personnel.
 
So you can see that the momentum in that area northwest of Avdiivka is on the Russian side, they're heading towards higher ground. It's not strategic 
 
 right now. But it could be and that's not the only area of the frontline where we're seeing them gain momentum up in the Kharkiv region.
 
There are reports that they're progressing in the direction of Kupiansk, that's an area just for context that Ukraine conducted a very successful 
 
 counter offensive in the autumn of 2022, and has pretty much managed to hold steady since then, with a few small exceptions.
 
So you can see that the difference that these months of delay have made. President Zelenskyy coming out in a press conference just today with Jens 
 
 Stoltenberg, the NATO Secretary General saying that essentially speed is of the essence that he's not letting up, even with the passage through 
 
 Congress of that aid bill in keeping the pressure up on the U.S. and his allies to get those weapons to the frontline. He says Russia is taking 
 
 advantage of this moment, Erica.
 
HILL: So looking at all of that, as you pointed out that delay in the weapons, as we when we look at this moving forward, what is that 
 
 conversation moving forward about how to potentially deal with this. Finally, that aid package pass, of course, was passed in the U.S., but it 
 
 likely won't be the last time that there is going to be a concern like this?
 
SEBASTIAN: Well, absolutely. And I think like, well, Russia is looking at this narrowing window, until there's a delivery start to try and make a 
 
 difference in its own efforts, potentially planning a spring offensive. Ukraine is also keenly aware that there is an election coming up in the 
 
 United States and it may have its own relatively narrow window to get something done.
 
It is of course, on the back foot its first task is to stabilize the front lines and then look ahead to what analysts believe maybe no offensive 
 
 operations this year, but perhaps moving towards some kind of renewed counter offensive in 2025. So that delay has, of course, lengthened the 
 
 timeline for Ukraine, attempting to try to move Russia out of the territory it occupies, Erica.
 
HILL: Yeah, absolutely, Clare, appreciate it. Thank you.

Barely, a year into the role Scotland's leader has resigned Humza Yousaf made the announcement on Monday. His coalition government with the Green 
 
 Party fell apart last week after his government decided to scrap climate targets. Misuse of took over as the leader of the Scottish National Party 
 
 last March hoping to strengthen the case for a new referendum on Scottish independence.
 
Let's get you up to speed on some of the other stories on our radar right now, protesters in Georgia denouncing government efforts there to pass a 
 
 law placing restrictions on foreign funded organizations. Tbilisi on Sunday, thousands marched against that bill which many have described as 
 
 pro-Russian.
 
If it passes, organizations receiving more than 20 percent of their funds from abroad will be required to register as foreign agents. LGBTQ advocates 
 
 are condemning Iraq's new law that punishes same sex relations with up to 15 years in prison. Lawmakers also pass measures criminalizing acts that 
 
 promote a gay lifestyle, and may performing gender reassignment surgery punishable by up to three years in prison.
 
French actors are all different Jews being questioned by police in Paris. CNN affiliate BFMTV reporting it is over claims that he sexually assaulted 
 
 two women. They say the actor groped them and made obscene and inappropriate comments on movie sets. The 75 year old is already facing 
 
 separate charges of rape and sexual assault, which he denies.
 
South Africa is celebrating 30 years as a democracy. There was on April 27, 1994, the Former Political Prisoner Nelson Mandela cast his vote out of 
 
 being elected. South Africa's first black president, putting in more than four decades of apartheid. The Current President Cyril Ramaphosa has marked 
 
 this anniversary by leading Freedom Day celebrations in Pretoria and stressing the importance of those extraordinary events.

CYRIL RAMAPHOSA, SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT: That we have been able to cast off the yoke of oppression as a new nation, rooted in equality, human 
 
 rights is amongst the greatest feats and achievements of modern history.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HILL: The ANC has been in power since that momentous election, however, with inequality and an all-time high and crime and corruption running 
 
 rampant, that one's hopeful promise of democracy seems to be losing its glimmer ahead of next month's critical elections. Here CNN's David 
 
 McKenzie.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Liberation Icon, Seth Mazibuko live the painful history of this country.
 
SETH MAZIBUKO, SOUTH AFRICAN LIBERATION HERO: Students were coming from that direction, and police were coming from that direction that morning of 
 
 June 16, 1976. This was where the students who were marching peacefully they were raising their hands and fingers of peace. They were given 
 
 bullets.
 
MCKENZIE (voice-over): Protesting the apartheid state and its racist education system.
 
MAZIBUKO: I still feel guilty today that I lead students and children out of the classroom to be killed.
 
MCKENZIE (voice-over): Their sacrifice and the sacrifices of later generations help toppled the violent apartheid state. Birthing a peaceful 
 
 democratic South Africa, the rainbow nation where everyone can vote, but for Mazibuko 30 years on, the rainbow has faded.
 
MCKENZIE: Has the leadership of this country, respected the sacrifices that you've made.
 
MAZIBUKO: Sold out.
 
MCKENZIE: Sold out.
 
MAZIBUKO: Many of the leaders that were supposed to be leading, they left this community, and they left the very people that they're fighting for.
 
MCKENZIE: When thousands of students were bravely marching down the streets, they were fighting for a better future for South Africa. But 
 
 decades later, here's a staggering statistic more than 80 percent of grade fours cannot read. Has it gotten worse over the 18 years of being at the 
 
 school?
 
PRINCE MULWELA, TEACHER AT MORRIS ISAACSON HIGH SCHOOL: Yes, it is becoming worse and worse.
 
MCKENZIE (voice-over): At Morris Isaacson High School famous for its role in 76. Teachers like Prince Mulwela say that jobs in education are given to 
 
 the politically connected and corruption is rife. Primary students now come to his classes unprepared he says corruption watchdogs call it a silent 
 
 crisis.
 
MULWELA: We're living in a world in South Africa, where it's all about politics. Everything has been politicized. So the education system is also 
 
 being politicized. So that is the reason why probably why express in such problems.
 
ATLEGANG ALCOCK, STUDENT AT MORRIS ISAACSON HIGH SCHOOL: I feel honored being in the school because then I get to learn about his --
 
MBALI MSIMANGA, STUDENT AT MORRIS ISAACSON HIGH SCHOOL: Some put their lives in danger for a better future for better education.
 
MCKENZIE (voice-over): I spoke to two leading students at Morris Isaacson they are proud of their school, but acutely aware of the challenges that 
 
 lie ahead.
 <br>[09:25:00]
 
MCKENZIE: Is there enough opportunity for young people like you in this country?
 
ALCOCK: Right now? No.
 
MSIMANGA: That's going to be a struggle. Yeah. And it is scary for us to be sitting at home and doing nothing.
 
ALCOCK: Especially when you know that you went to university for so long and you have a degree a qualification but you're still struggling to get a 
 
 job because of the unemployment rates.
 
MCKENZIE (voice-over): Those rates are some of the world's highest, an uncertain future despite the bitter struggles of the past. David McKenzie, 
 
 CNN, Soweto.

HILL: Antony Blinken focus on solutions in Gaza on his latest middle east toward just ahead with the head of the IMF says will be crucial to recovery 
 
 when the war does end. Plus, Tesla CEO, Elon Musk making a surprise visit to China there to try to explore his company's self-driving technology, a 
 
 report from Beijing.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HILL: Welcome back. You're watching "Connect the World". I'm Erica Hill in New York in for Becky Anderson. The U.S. Secretary of State is on the first 
 
 day of his latest diplomatic push in the Middle East. Antony Blinken hoping to revive talks and a deal to bring a ceasefire and the release of hostages 
 
 in Gaza.
 
He is also there to discuss visions for a post war Gaza and how to carve a path to recovery for the Palestinian people. On the sidelines of the World 
 
 Economic Forum meeting in Riyadh, my colleague Becky Anderson spoke with the head of the International Monetary Fund who said this will truly be a 
 
 global effort.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KRISTALINA GEORGIEVA, MANAGING DIRECTOR OF INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND: Where we come into play is to support building institutions for an economy 
 
 after the horror of war ends, because I pray in the sooner the better. We will come with what we are best at build strength for public finances for 
 
 monetary policy for macroeconomic stability.
 
BECKY ANDERSON, CNN HOST, CONNECT THE WORLD: Before October the seventh the kingdom wasn't there a deal to normalize relations with Israel and given 
 
 your mandate to promote macro-economic and financial stability.
 <br>[09:30:00]
 
Is Saudi normalization with Israel the right path forward, do you believe?
 
GEORGIEVA: Everything done in the world that helps create better conditions for economic cooperation is good for the countries participating, and it is 
 
 good for the world economy. What we aspire to see is more efforts in global and regional context, to build the transmission lines of prosperity, trait, 
 
 financial flows, the free movement of people, when we have that everybody benefits.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HILL: They also discuss the wider challenges to the global economy, one major factor now, the struggle to bring down interest rates in the U.S.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GEORGIEVA: The good news is that the U.S. has very strong labor market, demand remains strong and growth in the United States surprise to us in the 
 
 beginning of the year on the upside that translates into bad news, because when the economy is so strong then the Fed has no reason to look at rate 
 
 cuts.
 
And that translates into bad news for the rest of the world. I would not read too much into one data point. What I would concentrate on is, is the 
 
 United States pursuing the complement of monetary and fiscal policy in the same determined way it has done it up to now?
 
ANDERSON: I mean the IMF mandate is to promote macro-economic and financial stability around the world with a strong dollar as such a lag on the 
 
 potential for growth going forward. You have said certainly when you last spoke to CNN that you were expected to see interest rates come down, mid 
 
 here. Do you still expect to see that?
 
GEORGIEVA: We are still expecting to see by the end of 2024 inflation in the United States to go down to target and that would be the foundation at 
 
 some point for the Fed to start cutting interest rates. But let's remember that one cut, two cuts, three cuts, it doesn't mean that interest rates 
 
 would fall down dramatically.
 
So the world needs to brace for a more prolonged period of time of somewhat higher interest rates.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HILL: The IMF has a global remit, but let's drills down here the country hosting these medians Saudi Arabia, its minister for economy and planning 
 
 also spoke with CNN talking about the country's big plans for a prosperous and diverse next few years.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
FAISAL F. ALIBRAHIM, SAUDI ARABIAN MINISTER OF ECONOMY AND PLANNING: So for the first time ever, at the end of 2023, or non-oil activities. So these 
 
 are the economic activities that are not related directly to oil and -- have amounted to 50 percent of our total real GDP. This is a milestone. We 
 
 want it to even grow further underpinning that is growth in the private sector activity.
 
Our target is 65 percent. Revenues are another story we will continue relying on oil revenues, will continue being a leader in hydrocarbon, 
 
 conventional hydrocarbon energy, the cleanest in the world. We will use that revenue to become a leader in renewable energy, whether it's hydrogen, 
 
 wind, solar, and other areas.
 
We also believe in the energy transition that's practical and pragmatic and just and we believe in the role of innovation and technology. So we want to 
 
 be a leader in climate tech as well that revenue will be put to good use to continue our diversification story and to continue putting solutions some 
 
 of our greatest challenge.

HILL: We are also keeping a close watch on the China auto show so this year, the focus is all things electric which may explain why Tesla CEO Elon 
 
 Musk made a surprise visit where according to state media, he met with senior trade officials. He is of course also there to promote Tesla's self-
 
 driving technology. CNN's Marc Stewart was at the show and filed this report.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MARC STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT: This is auto China, the largest car show in all of China and one of the largest in the world. There are a few gas 
 
 powered cars here, but the real focus is electric.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I came here mainly checking on EVs. Now there are many EV brands. So there are lots of options.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We liked the standout eye catching color.
 <br>[09:35:00]
 
STEWART: There are More than 200 EV makers in China. Take a look over here. This is the line to see the latest offering from Xiaomi. It's a Chinese 
 
 tech company known for its phones. This is the much talked about Xiaomi SU7. Yes, it has an aerodynamic design. It can accelerate very quickly.
 
Its battery could take you for about 500 miles. But its most distinct point is this touchscreen. You can use it to control almost whole aspects of your 
 
 life. You can turn the lights in your home on and off, it can even start the coffee maker. This isn't just about performance geopolitics plays a 
 
 role too.
 
Elon Musk flew to China over the weekend on a surprise trip and that Chinese Premier Li Qiang, Musk has his biggest overseas Tesla factory in 
 
 Shanghai, so he has big stakes in China. According to State Media, Li said that China is open to foreign business and wants to make it easier for 
 
 global companies to come here. In addition, Musk said Tesla's Gigafactory in Shanghai is its best performing. Tesla wants to be an even bigger player 
 
 in the Chinese market. In addition to its American base,
 
ELON MUSK, CEO OF TESLA: It's good to see electric vehicles making progress China old cars will be electric in the future.
 
STEWART (voice-over): As a P7 American technology, Tesla faced lots of restrictions in China out of security concerns. Until this visit Tesla cars 
 
 were sometimes not allowed to enter airports, government compounds and other sensitive areas. Well, this time after Musk met Li Chinese 
 
 authorities announced that such restrictions on Tesla cars are no more because the company's China made vehicles have passed the country's data 
 
 security requirements.
 
STEWART: As Elon Musk looks for success here in China for Chinese carmakers looking to break into the American market. That may not be so easy taught 
 
 U.S. officials have expressed concern that Chinese cars could potentially collect data and send it back here to Beijing, a potential blow for China, 
 
 the world's largest auto exporter. Mark Stewart, CNN, Beijing.

HILL: The Emperor Penguins of Antarctica are in peril. Low levels of sea ice driven in part by climate change are threatening their breeding grounds 
 
 and causing colonies to just die off. Here's CNN's Lynda Kinkade.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
LYNDA KINKADE, CNN ANCHOR (voice-over): -- and gliding through the Antarctic, some of these penguins have seen better days. The world's 
 
 largest penguin species, emperor penguins are severely threatened by climate change. Scientists from the British Antarctic survey say tens of 
 
 thousands of emperor penguin chicks may have died as the species battle to survive record low sea ice in 2023.
 
PETER FRETWELL, BRITISH ANTARCTIC SURVEY: We know that they agree on sea ice. We know sea ice is one of the first things affected as temperatures 
 
 warmer ocean temperature, lower temperatures. And we're starting to see these losses in Antarctica now, our models are quite dire.
 <br>[09:40:00]
 
KINKADE (voice-over): Dire because these penguins also lay their eggs and raise their chicks on sea ice. But with the ice melting away, the chicks 
 
 may fall into the sea before they get their waterproof feathers, leaving them to freeze to death or drown. Despite the recent losses, 2023 wasn't as 
 
 bad as 2022 for the emperor penguins.
 
Scientists say because some colonies adapted to the worsening conditions by moving south to find better ice -- more stable ice shelves or icebergs.
 
FRETWELL: It was reassuring that, it wasn't quite as bad as we'd feared with the worst ever sea ice, but it was still bad.
 
KINKADE (voice-over): Well, this is a good sign. Fretwell says work still needs to be done just save the emperor penguin. And we should do it before 
 
 it's too late.
 
FRETWELL: There'll be worse. Well, that really depends on us. How much carbon and methane we put into the atmosphere? Can we change the trajectory 
 
 of global warming that we're on at the moment? If we can we still have time to save the emperor penguin. But if we don't, then emperor penguins are 
 
 going to be one of the first major animals that will be lost purely by warming planet.
 
KINKADE (voice-over): Fretwell and his fellow scientists predict that 99 percent of the emperor penguin population could be gone by the end of the 
 
 century, a tragic loss for a majestic bird. Lynda Kinkade, CNN.

HILL: Well -- the race for the English Premier League title is now down to two teams Arsenal had a one point lead over Manchester City it is the three 
 
 time defending champions that seem to have the advantage but I will leave that assessment to the expert Amanda Davies, who joins me now. Amanda, tell 
 
 us what we're looking at there.
 
AMANDA DAVIES, CNN WORLD SPORT: Yeah, Manchester City has a game in hand. They have four matches of the season left to play. Arsenal, yes, they're 
 
 leading the way but they only have three. So if Manchester City when all their remaining games don't slip up as they're showing no sign of being in 
 
 danger of doing then the title will be theirs for a record breaking four in a row.
 
But Arsenal fans are keeping the faith. They haven't got their hands on this trophy for 20 years and they are closer than they have been in a very, 
 
 very long time. They dug deep yesterday against their North London rivals. As I looked like they might be set to drop points but they held on they got 
 
 what was a huge morale boosting win.
 
So they are not giving up hope just yet. We've got plenty more on the title running, coming in just a couple of minutes in "World Sport", Erica.
 
HILL: All right. We'll be looking for all that. Amanda, thank you. Stick around but more to come on the other side of this break.
