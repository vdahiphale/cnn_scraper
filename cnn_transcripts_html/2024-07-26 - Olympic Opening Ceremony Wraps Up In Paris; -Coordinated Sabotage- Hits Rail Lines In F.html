<br>[18:00:30]
 
PAULA NEWTON, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST: It is midnight in Paris, 8:00 a.m. in Sydney, 6:00 p.m. right here in New York. I'm Paula Newton in for Julia 
 
 Chatterley. And wherever you are in the world, this is your "First Move."
 
A very warm welcome to "First Move." And here's today's need to know. An epic ceremony -- opening ceremony for the Paris Summer Olympics, including 
 
 a performance from none other than Lady Gaga. We will take you live to the French capital.
 
And an investigation is underway into an attack on France's rail network, which disrupted travel plans for many travelers there.
 
Plus, a meeting between former U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at Mar-a-Lago. We'll have a live report, 
 
 all that and more, coming up.
 
But first, pageantry in Paris. The 2024 Olympic Games have now officially kicked off with a star-studded parade on the River Seine. You see the 
 
 brilliant colors there. It is the first time the opening ceremony has been held outside of a stadium and it overcame strikes, gray skies, and even 
 
 rail sabotage. More on all of that in just a moment.
 
Now, the ceremony featured a host of celebrities, including performances by Lady Gaga and Celine Dion, and a cameo from French football legend Zinedine 
 
 Zidane. Of course, the athletes brought their own star power, Andy Murray, Simone Biles, LeBron James, you see him there, Rafael Nadal, just a few of 
 
 the megawatt talents you can expect to see in the coming days.
 
Well, France putting on what is an absolutely stunning opening ceremony that spanned the entire city. And that was despite some major issues right 
 
 across the country earlier in the day, rail lines right across France hit in a spate of attacks, including arson. Now, luckily no one -- sorry, 
 
 pardon me. Luckily, no one was injured in any of these attacks.
 
So, far, though, no one has claimed responsibility for them either. And given the scale and precision, it is believed they are part of a 
 
 coordinated effort. A source telling CNN that French Intelligence Services are now, in their words, fully mobilized to find those responsible.
 
Melissa Bell joins us now with Paris -- from Paris with the details. Quite an extraordinary day from start to finish here, Melissa. And obviously, 
 
 starting with some concerns.
 
MELISSA BELL, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Starting with some concern that no one could have anticipated since it was a country that woke 
 
 up to news that there was travel chaos for hundreds of thousands of French people, whether they were those trying to get to Paris to watch the opening 
 
 ceremony or be near it, in the French capital or others who are heading, Paula, in or around or out of the country for the start of their summer 
 
 holidays.
 
What emerged over the day was the news that this had likely been coordinated and the investigation is now underway.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BELL (voice-over): The organizers of Paris 2024 believed they were ready for anything. But it was at 4:00 a.m., hours from the opening ceremony, 
 
 that coordinated sabotage and arson caused chaos with three of the nation's high speed rail lines.
 
PATRICE VERGRIETE, MINISTER DELEGATE FOR TRANSPORT OF FRANCE (through translator): Today, all the information we have clearly shows that it was 
 
 deliberate, the simultaneous nature, everything happened at the same time. Everything now points to the fact that these were arson attacks, 
 
 particularly the timing, which is more than suspicious.
 
BELL (voice-over): Security in Paris is tight, with authorities keen to make sure that things go smoothly. But this was one attack carried out 
 
 simultaneously across the country that was impossible to imagine. Intelligence Services say this tactic's been used before by far-left 
 
 groups.
 
AMELLE OUDEA-CASTERA, FRENCH SPORT MINISTER (through translator): Playing against the games is playing against France. It's playing against your 
 
 camp. It's playing against your country.
 
BELL: These are exactly the kinds of images that the organizers of Paris 2024 had hoped to avoid with French authorities warning that it is 250,000 
 
 travelers likely to be impacted this Friday, 800,000 over the course of the weekend.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): I was supposed to go to the Olympics. This morning they told us it would be three hours and 20 minutes 
 
 late. And in the end, the train was cancelled. So, we had to take a bus to Paris.
 <br>[18:05:00]
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): I wanted to get to Paris for the Olympics. So, I have no idea what I'm going to do. Because they told us 
 
 there won't be any trains until this afternoon and they don't know when it will start again.
 
BELL (voice-over): It wasn't just spectators affected, with one official telling reporters that only two of the four trains carrying athletes were 
 
 able to run. As repairs get underway, the National Railway Company's regional director said it could take a day or more before lines start 
 
 functioning again. The latest drama likely to dampen the spirits of the French, many of them heading off on family holidays, even as Paris Mayor 
 
 Anne Hidalgo believed that enthusiasm for the Games had finally gripped the country.
 
ANNE HIDALGO, PARIS MAYOR (through translator): I felt that the enthusiasm arrived a little before, during the passage of the flame in Paris on July 
 
 14th and 15th. The Olympic flame was paraded in Paris and there were people everywhere, children, elderly people, all social classes. Everyone was 
 
 really happy and I said to myself that it's the magic of the games working.
 
BELL (voice-over): With the Olympics now firmly underway, organizers will be hoping that this will be a short-lived memory.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
BELL (on camera): They're also now ramping up, Paula, security along the rain lines -- trail rail lines trying to ensure that this kind of thing 
 
 can't happen again even as they try to repair them. Now, the ceremony did go ahead as planned. It was spectacular going on for several hours. And the 
 
 fairly heavy rain that we saw throughout much of the ceremony really didn't dampen the extraordinary quality of it.
 
Not just the boats heading down the river, but those shows that you mentioned, Lady Gaga, Celine Dion. It was something that the Paris 
 
 organizers had said all along that this would be an opening ceremony like no other. The sabotage notwithstanding, the rain notwithstanding, that did 
 
 prove to be the case, Paula.
 
NEWTON: Melissa, I have to say I caught some of it and they did overcome for sure the day. And what was on show really was this spectacular city, 
 
 really so stunning and really wet everyone's appetite for the rest of the games. I'm sure everyone there is excited. What I want to ask you because I 
 
 know you've been covering this literally for years, does this change the way the games will move forward now, given the fact that, you know, they 
 
 had a bit of a scare this morning with these kinds of attacks?
 
BELL: I think you're likely to see greater precautions taken, certainly. This is a country that's been on its highest alert ever since that Moscow 
 
 attack, you'll remember earlier this year that was claimed by ISIS-K.And there have been many attacks, say French authorities, that have been foiled 
 
 as we head into this Summer Game period.
 
There are huge amounts of security forces on the street, whether they are policemen and women or soldiers. But now, you're likely to see heightened 
 
 security outside of the city. Certainly, the rail operators are saying that they're putting about 1,000 workers specifically on the lines to make sure 
 
 that nothing happens. But again, when you consider how this sabotage -- coordinated sabotage took place, it was at parts of the country fairly 
 
 isolated, outside of towns, taking on signal points that very strategically then hampered the lines' ability to function.
 
So, we look now to authorities to tell us who might have been responsible. Clearly, they were people who knew the rail lines and clearly, they were 
 
 people out to cause as much disruption ahead of the games, even as the world's eyes were on Paris. Paula.
 
NEWTON: They certainly, as I said, came out stunningly. We just watched it in the last few hours. Melissa Bell, we really look forward to your 
 
 reporting over the next several weeks as the Olympics are now on in France. Thanks so much, Melissa. Appreciate it.
 
Now, as the Olympics, as you were just saying, have kicked off, there are fears for the safety of the Israeli athletes. It's something France is 
 
 taking very seriously, as you can imagine, and giving them all round the clock security. Attacks against Israeli competitors have a dark history at 
 
 the Games, as our Fred Pleitgen reports on now.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): As Israeli athletes arrived in France making their way to the Olympic Village 
 
 under heavy French police protection, protests against Israel's participation in the 2024 Games had already erupted in Paris. France's 
 
 government acknowledging the threat level for Israeli athletes is extremely high.
 
I proposed to the President of the Republic that the Israeli delegation be fully protected by the French police 24 hours a day, the interior minister 
 
 said.
 
Security forces are on high alert. French and international police patrolling the area around the Olympics, trying to prevent mistakes made in 
 
 the past.
 <br>[18:10:00]
 
We took this decision because the Israeli athletes, and we've known this since the Munich Games, of course, but more recently again are particularly 
 
 targeted by attacks.
 
Munich, West Germany at the Summer Games 1972. Palestinians from a militant group named Black September stormed the dormitory housing the Israeli team 
 
 They immediately shoot and kill two athletes and take nine more team members hostage. The games continue as the hostage crisis drags on, the 
 
 gunman often seen on the balcony of the Olympic dormitory.
 
German police finally attempt and completely botch a rescue mission, leaving all of the Israeli hostages, a German cop, and five of the 
 
 terrorists dead.
 
Esther Roth-Shachamorov was on Israel's 1972 track and field team.
 
ESTHER ROTH-SHACHAMOROV, 1972 ISRAELI OLYMPIC ATHLETE (through translator): I was sitting in the plane transporting the coffins of my coach and 
 
 comrades I had trained with. They return with you in coffins. That was the thing I couldn't understand. And I kept thinking, what's going on here?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: At this moment, eight or nine athletes of the Israeli team are being held prisoner.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: These guerrillas are a group called Black September.
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over): Israel's intelligence service Mossad soon launched a campaign of assassinations targeting those connected to the Munich 
 
 massacre, depicted in the 2005 Steven Spielberg film "Munich," which also depicts the botched German rescue attempt.
 
And while 1972 isn't 2024, the trauma remains, and so do the lessons learned. Israel's sports minister recently met with the country's domestic 
 
 security service, Shin Bet.
 
Since October 7th of last year, when Hamas attacked Israel, killing more than 1,100 people and taking roughly 250 others hostage, Israel has 
 
 launched a punishing military campaign in Gaza, killing many Hamas fighters, but also scores of civilians.
 
Israeli athletes say they're well aware of the anger they face.
 
INBAR LANIR, ISRAELI OLYMPIC JUDOKA: It's something that we're used to, and I'm feeling really safe. My part is to connect everyone by sports.
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over): French authorities say they will do their part to try and make sure violence doesn't disrupt the games that are supposed to 
 
 be above politics.
 
Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Berlin.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
NEWTON: OK. Straight ahead for us, severe flooding in Eastern China after a powerful storm, Gaemi, strikes the region. Thousands of people have been 
 
 evacuated. The very latest on the storm's past, that's just ahead.
 
Plus, quite a night for the City of Light. Rain could not spoil the party in Paris as the Olympics officially get underway. We will speak to the main 
 
 sponsor of the Indonesian Olympic team about his country's gold medal dreams and the outlook for the Indonesian economy.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:15:55]
 
NEWTON: Here in the United States. Now, Former President Donald Trump will be returning to Pennsylvania following the attempt on his life there, he 
 
 wrote on social media, "I will be going back to Butler, Pennsylvania for a big and beautiful rally. Honoring the soul of our beloved firefighting 
 
 hero, Corey, and those brave patriots injured two weeks ago."
 
Now, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu traveled to Mar-a-Lago to meet with Donald Trump on Friday. It's the first time the two have met 
 
 since Trump left the White House. Mr. Netanyahu had high profile meetings with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris just a day 
 
 earlier.
 
Now, Harris criticized Israel's conduct in the war. Here's how Trump responded to those comments.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think her remarks were disrespectful. They weren't very nice pertaining 
 
 to Israel. I actually don't know how a person who's Jewish can vote for her. But that's up to them. But she was certainly disrespectful to Israel 
 
 in my opinion.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NEWTON: Kristen Holmes has been following this for us from West Palm Beach. It was quite a day and I take it they met for a lot longer than originally 
 
 planned.
 
KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: They did meet for a long time, but we're actually not sure how long they met because they were 
 
 supposed to meet at 11:00 a.m. We saw the motorcade enter. We never saw Benjamin Netanyahu's motorcade leave, but we are told that he is no longer 
 
 there.
 
Now, that is not that surprising, given the high security alert that both of these men are currently under. So, that is unclear how long the actual 
 
 length of this is meeting was. But I will tell you, we got a readout from the campaign. They said exactly what you would expect from the Trump 
 
 campaign, that Benjamin Netanyahu praised Donald Trump and thanked him for everything he did when he was in office. And Donald Trump told Benjamin 
 
 Netanyahu that he stands with Israel completely after those October 7th attacks.
 
What's interesting, we ended up getting to go into the room, just briefly, to ask a few questions. We talked about those were the questions, some of 
 
 them you just played there, about Kamala Harris's remarks. Donald Trump used that opportunity to attack Harris to say that she was a California 
 
 liberal, to go after her stance on Israel. Benjamin Netanyahu said, when it came to those comments, that he hoped it didn't impact the ceasefire talks 
 
 that were currently underway.
 
The other part of their conversation that was notable was just their interaction overall. The two men were very close when Donald Trump was in 
 
 office, and then that relationship soured after Trump left and after Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated President Joe Biden on winning the 2020 
 
 election, something that Trump just thought was disloyal. Obviously, loyalty is something that matters a lot to him. But today, you wouldn't 
 
 have been able to tell that there was any tension between the two men. They seemed to get along fine. And I asked what their relationship would look 
 
 like, would it be a good working relationship if he was to be elected back in November and Trump said, yes, there was never any issues with their 
 
 relationship
 
NEWTON: Now, Kristen, we heard as well in the last few hours that the former president saying that he is going back to Butler, Pennsylvania. I 
 
 mean, obviously, given security issues, but also the campaign itself, what do you make of the fact that he's saying, look. I'm going back there to be 
 
 with those people again?
 
HOLMES: I think that that's a very Donald Trump thing to do, and I think that -- I really do believe that it would be a lot more secure because they 
 
 will be paying attention. Now, whether or not those would even be a rally that was outside or in the same place, it seems like we don't have any 
 
 answers on that.
 
I've talked to a number of senior advisers who said this is still in the preliminary planning phases, but it's something that Donald Trump wants to 
 
 do. And it doesn't surprise me that it's something that he wants to do and go back there.
 
But I will remind you, one of the things we've reported is that Secret Service has urged against any outdoor rallies. They had already been urging 
 
 against that before the assassination attempt. They obviously continue to do so. And also, the Trump campaign has entirely reassessed with security 
 
 and with his Secret Service detail what his security looks like around all his rallies, all his events.
 
So, whether or not he does this in the same place, it all remains to be seen. We have no idea when this would go on the schedule. He's going to be 
 
 in Harrisburg next Wednesday, but it's not surprising that this is something he wants to do is go back there and talk to the people who were 
 
 there in that crowd.
 <br>[18:20:00]
 
And he says in part, you honor both Corey Comperatore who was killed that day, as well as some of the other victims of that shooting.
 
NEWTON: Yes, it's so important to remember that that firefighter lost his life and that two people were critically injured. Not to -- you know, just 
 
 not to underestimate what everyone there went through on that day being completely terrified, and that includes the former president. Kristen 
 
 Holmes for us in West Palm Beach. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.
 
Now, an Olympic sized session on Wall Street topping today's "Money Move." U.S. stocks ending a highly volatile trading week with strong gains, thanks 
 
 in large part to an investor friendly read on U.S. prices. Now, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation easing slightly to an annual rate of 2.5 
 
 percent, another data point that will help make the case for rate cuts. The Fed meets to discuss monetary policy next week, but most economists believe 
 
 a cut is more likely in September.
 
European stocks recovering from two days of losses meantime, with French stocks putting in, yes, that gold medal performance rising well over 1 
 
 percent. Similar gains, in fact, in the U.K. Asian stocks finished Friday session mostly higher, but the eighth straight session of losses, in the 
 
 meantime, for the Nikkei in Japan.
 
Big business, of course, will have a big role to play in this year's Summer Olympics is sporting goods firms and other major consumer brands spent 
 
 heavily on promotions and endorsements. Companies like Indonesian manufacturing and infrastructure firm Bakrie &amp; Brothers are working behind 
 
 the scenes to support their country's talented athletes.
 
Indonesia has sent 29 athletes to Paris this summer. Here they are right there at Friday night's opening ceremony on the Seine. Do they look like 
 
 they're having a good time? That's fantastic. In front of the Eiffel Tower. They will be competing in such categories as gymnastics, archery, swimming, 
 
 and weightlifting.
 
Indonesia, by the way, has won the most overall medals of any Southeast Asian country at the Summer Games, and it is set to make a bid to actually 
 
 host the Games for 2036.
 
Anindya Bakrie, the CEO of Bakrie &amp; Brothers joins me now. He is the main sponsor of the Indonesian Olympic team, as well as a leading figure in the 
 
 Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. I want to thank you for joining us. In fact, you join us from Paris. I'm not sure how much of all 
 
 of this you've been able to take in. But despite the rain, it looked impressive.
 
Certainly, the Indonesian team there with a lot of enthusiasm. I mean, some people would shy away from this kind of investment, right? The Olympics has 
 
 kind of lost sometimes a bit of its marquee value for investors. Why do you choose to be part of this kind of a movement and back, more importantly, 
 
 your athletes?
 
ANINDYA BAKRIE, CEO, BAKRIE &amp; BROTHERS AND CHEF DE MISSION, INDONESIAN OLYMPIC TEAM: Yes, first of all, Julia, thank you very much for having me. 
 
 It is indeed an honor to be here with our delegation, along with the other 206 countries. So, we just had this nice opening at Seine River, and 
 
 everybody had a good time. And I think it is a message of peace and unity at a timely moment right now, with the complexities in geopolitics, 
 
 geoeconomies, you know, having Paris Olympic is just a nice thing to have.
 
And for Indonesia to be able to send 29 athletes, it is the largest in two decades, joining 10,500 athletes, it is indeed an exciting thing. The 
 
 biggest gold accumulation we had was in 1992. We hope we can surpass that with a lot of sports such as badminton, speed climbing, as well as 
 
 weightlifting, among other things that we also compete in nine other sports.
 
But yes, it's nice to be here and I think this type of person-to-person diplomacy is the thing that we need nowadays.
 
NEWTON: And we certainly wish the best for your athletes. Indonesia has a bold vision when it comes to this. Perhaps even, as you said, bidding on 
 
 the Olympics. Some countries find that sometimes their citizens are not that keen on the games. Why support such a venture? Because it is 
 
 incredibly expensive.
 
BAKRIE: Yes, indeed, Julia, but we have this experience in 2018 with Asian Games. Not many people know, but Asian Games is the second largest multi 
 
 sports event in the world. So, if we could have done it already in the past, in 2018, and trying to look for the future Olympics in Indonesia is 
 
 not something that's impossible indeed.
 
We have the infrastructure. We understand the supply chain management. We also work on the logistics, taking care of the athletes. And in fact, Asian 
 
 Games has more sports than Olympics, 32 sports. So, we feel confident. Indonesia is a part of a G20 countries, the 15th largest country in the 
 
 world.
 <br>[18:25:00]
 
We have 285 million people living there, and it is a part of Southeast Asian countries, which has 850 million people. So, I think, you know, 
 
 personal opinion after Los Angeles, Brisbane, who knows, Indonesia is not far off to be, you know, a candidate for the Olympics.
 
NEWTON: As you point out, you have a very enthusiastic and young population that I'm sure would welcome the games. I mean, Indonesia is working hard in 
 
 the meantime to find its footing in this new economy. You know, you met with Elon Musk earlier in the spring. What more can you tell us about the 
 
 investment opportunities that perhaps Tesla or his other companies might bring to Indonesia and what Indonesia is bidding for there in terms of 
 
 competition with others?
 
BAKRIE: I believe, Julia, that Indonesia has a chance to be the Mecca of the organization. Because below the ground, Indonesia has abundant natural 
 
 resources, such as nickel, copper, and bauxite and so on, which are very much needed for battery materials, for example.
 
And number two, above the ground, Indonesia has renewable energy potentials up to 500 gigawatt, such as solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and most 
 
 importantly, Indonesia has this biodiversity that can contribute in the carbon capture of the world. And in all of those respects, Indonesia really 
 
 want to be a value added economy.
 
Industrialization is really the name of the game for Indonesia, along with the trade that we want to increase over time. And Indonesia is a balanced 
 
 country that would like to do a trade and investment with the east and the west.
 
So, in the process that the west really look into Indo-Pacific partner, we believe Indonesia can be a good partner and can grow together because the 
 
 world really, as I mentioned quickly in the beginning, needs growth. The world also needs equity. I think Indonesia, as one of the largest democracy 
 
 in the world, can show an example that those things can co-exist.
 
NEWTON: Mr. Bakrie, we certainly thank you for joining us, and we wish the team all the best of luck as the games are underway now in Paris. 
 
 Appreciate it.
 
BAKRIE: Thank you very much.
 
NEWTON: Turning now to the weather. China is being hit with heavy rain from the remnants of Typhoon Gaemi, which was downgraded thankfully to a 
 
 tropical storm on Thursday. Meanwhile, the western U.S. continues to face devastating wildfires. More on this, I'm now joined by Chad Myers. I mean, 
 
 the aftermath of this tropical storm. It seems every time I speak to you, we have these storms that just won't quit. I mean, this one just seemed to 
 
 hit so many countries in such devastation.
 
CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST: It did. It did. Well, it was a very large storm, had its arms out with the what we call the outer bands hitting 
 
 Manila, where the eye of the storm was way up near Taipei. So, making landfall there on the eastern side of Taiwan, and it really put down some 
 
 significant rainfall.
 
Right now, though, the storm is kind of southwest of Shanghai. I know you're going to see a kind of a flare up here near Hong Kong at the very 
 
 end of this loop, but here it comes into parts of Taiwan. You see the outer bands all the way down to Manila. And then, it made just landfall there on 
 
 the China shore at about 110 kilometers per hour. So, not a major event, but right now, it's still right there. So, we're not even seeing the 
 
 showers around the middle anymore.
 
And that's kind of what happened here when it did approach Taiwan. It made a left-hand turn and it made an entire loop. And in that loop, it put down 
 
 1.8 meters of rainfall in 72 hours, more than six feet, almost seven feet of rainfall into 72 hours. There's not a place in the world that's not 
 
 going to flood at least a little bit from that.
 
Now, some of that rain is going to move into China in places that still could use some rain, from Wuhan all the way just to the east of Beijing. 
 
 And some of this could be 250 millimeters, Paula, and they will take the rainfall because it's been either flooding or a drought, depending on where 
 
 you are in China. So, kind of spread some of this rainfall around. They'll take it.
 
NEWTON: Yes. Although, you have reminded me many times, they want the water, but not all at once, and that certainly causes problems. And then we 
 
 have the wildfires in North America again this year. It's not as bad a year as it was last year, but still, they're battling such huge fires.
 
MYERS: Yes, and they are just getting bigger and bigger, containment like 3, 5 percent. You want that number to be 90 percent. So, not only 
 
 California, Nevada, all the way in the parts of Idaho and even into Oregon and Washington, but also on up into Canada here.
 <br>[18:30:00]
 
This was a beautiful town, Jasper, in between the mountain ranges here. This is in Alberta, just to the west of Edmonton, a few hundred clicks. But 
 
 other than that, this is what they woke up to this morning, just absolute devastation. Block after block after block of burned-out homes, buildings, 
 
 and obviously, all the possessions that people have worked their lives so long for.
 
An awful lot of smoke in the west as well. So, be careful if you're one of those sensitive groups and you live any one of these areas here, that's 
 
 either orange, purple, or red because there's going to be smoke in your air. Paula.
 
NEWTON: Yes. Chad, I mean, those pictures, whether they're from California or Alberta, just devastating for those communities. Chad Myers for us. 
 
 Thanks so much.
 
Now, the threat of rain didn't deter Olympic organizers. After the break, more on the spectacular opening ceremony and what to expect in the days 
 
 ahead. That's next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
NEWTON: And welcome back to "First Move" with a look at more international headlines this hour. A son of notorious drug lord El Chapo has been 
 
 arrested in the U.S. along with the alleged co-founder of Mexico's powerful Sinaloa drug cartel, Ismael El Mayo Zambada. Officials say El Chapo's son 
 
 reportedly helped U.S. authorities capture El Mayo. Mexico's president said the U.S. must give a full report on the operation that led to the arrests.
 
Venezuela is holding a presidential election this Sunday after years of chronic shortages and one of the worst economic crashes in modern history. 
 
 Voters will choose whether to keep the current strongman leader, Nicolas Maduro, or one of his rivals, which include former diplomat, Edmundo 
 
 Gonzalez. Nicolas Maduro said last week that Venezuela might face a bloodbath if he were not re-elected.
 <br>[18:35:00]
 
All eyes are on Paris now following Friday's Olympic opening ceremony. However, the games already well underway. In football, the U.S. women's 
 
 team got off to a perfect start Thursday, defeating Zambia 3-nil. While the men's team lost to host nation France, rugby sevens, handball, and archery 
 
 also kicked off ahead of the opening ceremony. Fan favorites like gymnastics and swimming are set to begin over the weekend. Coy Wire now has 
 
 more for us from Paris.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
COY WIRE, CNN WORLD SPORT: It was pouring down rain in Paris. It did not matter. France did their best to put on an Olympics opening ceremony for 
 
 the ages. The bells of Notre Dame ringing for the first time since the cathedral was gutted by fire. Water cannons blasting along the River Seine. 
 
 There were odes to the French Revolution, a theatrical display with a bunch of beheaded Marie Antoinette's.
 
Lady Gaga kicked things off, French cabaret style at 1.80 artists from Moulin Rouge performing the iconic dance that they expect to the 1820s. It 
 
 was part music festival, part fashion show, a diverse and inclusive display that had something for everyone. It may seem over the top of times, but not 
 
 for Paris.
 
As for the athletes, 85 boats floated with nearly 7,000 athletes from more than 200 delegations. Many of their uniforms were covered with a bunch of 
 
 plastic ponchos, but they were still dancing and celebrating in the rain. This was the first ever opening ceremony outside of a stadium.
 
Then one of the most iconic moments of any Olympics, the torch, making its way around the country here to Paris with sporting legends from all over 
 
 the world getting to touch it. Rafa Nadal, Serena Williams, Nadia Comaneci, Tony Parker, finally made it way to two French Olympians, Teddy Riner and 
 
 Marie Jose Perec. The Olympic flame was ignited and the cauldron lifted up, floated up into the air, marking the start of the 2024 Summer Games in 
 
 Paris.
 
And after all of that, about four hours in, legendary singer Celine Dion, who's been battling a rare neurological condition, performed for the fans 
 
 and athletes from the Eiffel Tower.
 
With that, the 2024 Paris Olympics are officially underway. Back to you.

NEWTON: And our thanks to Coy there. Still ahead for us, Former U.S. President Barack Obama's endorsement of Kamala Harris wraps up a highly 
 
 successful week for the Democrats. Where her campaign, though, goes from here? We'll have that after the break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: We called to say, Michelle and I, couldn't be prouder to endorse you and to do everything we can to get you 
 
 through this election and into the Oval Office.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NEWTON: Former U.S. President Barack Obama, along with his wife, Michelle, endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris on Friday. It's her biggest 
 
 endorsement since her boss, Joe Biden, told Americans he wants Harris to succeed him as U.S. president.
 
Now, this highly anticipated endorsement caps a remarkable week for Harris, with many Democrats going all out. All in on her candidacy. Kamala Harris 
 
 is in a sprint, in fact, though, to election day, which is a little bit more than 100 days away now. But her campaign has given Democrats new hope 
 
 of stopping a second Donald Trump presidency.
 
Meantime, the Trump campaign says it won't commit to debating Harris until she's confirmed as the Democratic Party's nominee. All right. We're going 
 
 to hash all of this out. What a week it was. We've got a panel of political experts here. Chuck Rocha is a Democratic strategist and former senior 
 
 adviser to Bernie Sanders' presidential campaigns. And Evan Siegfried is a Republican strategist. Thank you to you both for being with us as we really 
 
 try and make sense of what was a history making week.
 
Chuck, first to you, the momentum in the Harris campaign is undeniable. I will give you that, but how to make it last? This is still going to be an 
 
 incredibly tough race for her, especially in battleground states.
 
CHUCK ROCHA, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, unlike in most elections, we don't need to make it last six months or a year or two years. We just need 
 
 to make it last a hundred days. And I think that's absolutely doable. I think the incredible fundraising in the first 24 hours is a good 
 
 indication. I've been doing this for over 30 years. I've actually run a couple of presidential campaigns and it's crazy the difference in the 
 
 energy.
 
What a whiplash from three weeks ago. I've been a yellow dog Democrat for a long time. The party is engaged. It's enthused. And I think leading up now 
 
 to the convention, you're going to see nothing but lots of enthusiasm until we get into what we talk about is get out the vote.
 
And finally, I'll say, don't forget in America, in many, many states and in most of the battleground states, they'll start voting 30 or 60 days in 
 
 advance. So, it's not a hundred days until the election. It's like 65 or 70 days until the election.
 
NEWTON: And I'm really glad you mentioned that because that is totally true. And sometimes that early vote really can make the difference, 
 
 especially when there were only, you know, in some states, just tens -- thousands of votes, really separating the two candidates.
 
Evan, it doesn't look like the former president has really worked out a strategy yet, right, about how to confront Harris. And more to the point, 
 
 he does seem to be annoyed that Harris is taking much of the limelight away from him. Do you believe he will find a strong narrative very soon now in 
 
 the next few days to try and counter some of this momentum?
 
EVAN SIEGFRIED, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: I think he's going to try. But no, I don't think so. I think he's still trying to figure out Kamala Harris. You 
 
 know, you've seen him try and do things left and right, talk about it a little bit of immigration. Oh, she's far-left. you know, they're going to 
 
 call her a Marxist or a communist, but they need to find a message that's going to really connect with swing voters.
 
As Chuck said, there is tremendous energy and momentum on the Democratic side. And we've seen the whiplash going from -- on Sunday morning, Joe 
 
 Biden. I mean, you know, to Kamala Harris on Sunday afternoon, and how quickly people just shifted. And let's not forget, it wasn't just a 
 
 swapping of the candidate, it was a swapping of the message that was being put out by the campaign.
 
And we're seeing that Harris has gone on the offensive, and she's not going out and saying, and, hey, look. Donald Trump's a threat to democracy. She's 
 
 saying, oh, he's old. And, you know, J. D. Vance is weird. And that is a very different tone because when we -- when you report on these issues or 
 
 these claims, you have to report on the why, and we've heard a ton, time and again, Donald Trump's a threat to democracy. He likes dictators, but 
 
 this is a new strategy in taking on Donald Trump.
 
NEWTON: And, Evan, I will say the polls tell us though, that if they're close, right, sure it's within the margin of error, but what we know to be 
 
 true is that most times Democrats have to win the popular vote by some distance in order to take those battleground states to really win the 
 
 electoral college.
 
SIEGFRIED: Yes. Look, at the end of the day, we're still talking about the same voters that are going to decide this election, these voters on the 
 
 margins in several swing states, such as Milwaukee -- Wisconsin, pardon me, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Nevada. And what we're going to see is -- 
 
 what we've seen actually change in this race, is that, while it was Joe Biden versus Donald Trump, it was about the double hater voters trying to 
 
 win those over.
 
Now, I think it's about voters who actually are much more Harris inclined. We've seen voters who have said, we don't want either Biden or Trump. We 
 
 want somebody else who's younger, and now, they have it. And certainly, there's a new energy in the campaign from the vice president.
 <br>[18:45:00]
 
NEWTON: Careful, Evan. You're starting to sound like a Democrat there, but I'm going to leave that to where it is right now. I want to get to what may 
 
 or may not be the debate between these two. Voters, almost without exception, it doesn't matter who you are, want to see these two debate. And 
 
 yet, that now remains in question. I want you to listen to both of them now.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE: Yes, I'm ready to debate Donald Trump. I have agreed to the 
 
 previously agreed upon September 10th debate. He agreed to that previously. Now, it appears he's backpedaling. But I'm ready.
 
TRUMP: Well, I haven't agreed to anything. I agreed to a debate with Joe Biden, but I want to debate her and she'll be no different because they 
 
 have the same policies.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NEWTON: Chuck, do you think a debate, though, will definitely happen? And how do you think Harris will do against Donald Trump? Because, you know, 
 
 most people said that the last day -- the last debate was not really indicative of how any kind of a debate would go between two of these 
 
 candidates.
 
ROCHA: You know, I would have thought a debate would happen, but in the political environment that we're living in where every day something else 
 
 crazy happens, I'm just going to say that I would expect a debate, but I'm going to believe a debate will happen when I see a debate.
 
There's been too many unprecedented things happening too quickly of an amount of time for me to say for sure. I will tell you this, that I know 
 
 that Vice President Harris wants to debate Donald Trump. I know the American people would like to see that. God, I'd like to see that. Can you 
 
 imagine, an articulate, well educated, well-spoken woman going up against Donald Trump?
 
Sure, I think everybody will try to make the comparison to when him and Hillary Clinton had a debate. I do not think it's the same, but I do think 
 
 it would be very, very good. I think it would be very entertaining, and I think she would get the most of him, and I think that he knows that too. 
 
 That's why you'd start to see a little bit of a backpedal here.
 
NEWTON: Evan, do you think that, at the end of the day, Donald Trump will debate Kamala Harris? That really, he has no choice. If he doesn't, he'll 
 
 look weak?
 
SIEGFRIED: I think that there's an 85 percent chance he does not. Why?
 
NEWTON: He does not? So, you really don't think he will?
 
SIEGFRIED: -- create -- I'm leaning towards no. I think that there's too much risk involved. And I know I might sound like a Democrat for just 
 
 acknowledging reality, but if he goes up on that debate stage, and there's that viral or two viral moments of Kamala Harris absolutely mopping the 
 
 floor with him on one part, it's going to be devastating and really continue to put energy into that -- her campaign.
 
NEWTON: That is really interesting. And I wonder at this point in time, it's really not safe to put money on a debate given everything that's gone 
 
 on. I want to get to the pick of VP, which is also supposed to happen with lightning speed. It will arguably want to be one of the most consequential 
 
 VP picks that we've seen in decades.
 
Now, Evan, which pick do you believe would most worry the Trump campaign?
 
SIEGFRIED: Well, at first, I was thinking that Andy Beshear might be the right guy for the Harris campaign. But he has gone out there and he's 
 
 overplaying his hand and really becoming desperate by trying to want it. And he's come off very awkwardly, which is very unlike him.
 
Right now, I'm actually looking at Mark Kelly as probably the smartest pick. He's very well respected by Republicans in Arizona. He's very well 
 
 versed on border issues, and immigration is a major issue. So, you need to have somebody who can talk about immigration, and do so in a way that can -
 
 - voters can understand and say, OK, yes, this makes sense, as opposed to Kamala Harris as the borders are and look at the disaster on the border.
 
NEWTON: And I have to get Chuck in here just for a go. Chuck, who should she go with on the VP pick?
 
ROCHA: Look, I'm a big Kelly fan as well, but I think my, my dark horse is Governor Walz in Minnesota. He's just -- looks like a Midwesterner. He's 
 
 kind of an all-shucks Midwesterner. He's got the eight years of executive experience that she is looking for. So, that's my dark horse.
 
NEWTON: Chuck, Evan, you guys have a good weekend. We will have you back. That was a good conversation, as this campaign continues to speed along. 
 
 Really appreciate it. Thanks so much.
 
Now, coming up, a closer. look at the USA superstar Olympic basketball team and how the rest of the world is trying to catch up to them.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:51:28]
 
NEWTON: So, one of the most popular sports at the Olympics is men's basketball, and it's no surprise all eyes will be on Team USA and its star, 
 
 LeBron James. Team USA has won the gold in seven of the past eight Olympics. But as Andy Scholes tells us, the rest of the world is catching 
 
 up.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDY SCHOLES, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR (voice-over): Despite a couple shaky exhibitions against South Sudan and Germany, Team USA is still the team to 
 
 beat in Paris.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Obviously, you know, championship is on our mind.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You can't just win the game on paper. For us, we know what we're up against. We know what everybody's going to bring.
 
STEPH CURRY, TEAM USA: The competition and the challenge to win is probably going to be as hard as it's ever been. And I think we're up for it.
 
SCHOLES (voice-over): The U.S. Has failed to win gold only three times at the games. In 1972, they got silver losing to the Soviet Union in one of 
 
 the most controversial endings in Olympic history. In 1988, they again lost the Soviet Union, and that would be the last time the U.S. used amateur 
 
 players, because in 1992, we had the Dream Team with Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, and Larry Bird. It was one of the most iconic and dominant teams 
 
 in sports history.
 
And the U.S. dominance continued until 2004, but that team, despite having a young LeBron James and Dwyane Wade and Hall of Famers Allen Iverson and 
 
 Tim Duncan, just didn't mesh. They lost three games in Athens, the most ever by a men's Olympic squad. The U.S. finishing a disappointing third 
 
 place, watching Manny Ginobili in Argentina capture the gold.
 
After that loss, the U.S. reevaluated how they built the Olympic roster, stressing team chemistry as they vowed to not have another poor performance 
 
 at the Games. And in 2008, Kobe Bryant led the redeemed team to an undefeated run to reclaim U.S. dominance. And ever since, it's been nothing 
 
 but gold for Team USA at the Games.
 
But could this be the year the streak of four straight golds comes to an end? This team has LeBron and Steph Curry playing together for the first 
 
 time ever.
 
LEBRON JAMES, TEAM USA: It's fun. You know, we play the game at a high level, but more importantly, we just play the game that we love the right 
 
 way.
 
CURRY: We just want to win gold. I mean, whatever that takes. So, we always talk about no matter what your status are, no matter how many minutes you 
 
 play, like, everybody on the floor commits to just doing what you're asked to do, we'll be good.
 
SCHOLES (voice-over): It also has former MVPs Kevin Durant and Joel Embiid, making this year's roster arguably one of the most talented groups ever. 
 
 But the world is catching up. More than 45 NBA players will be competing in Paris. Giannis Antetokounmpo is an Olympian for the first time, leading 
 
 Greece to the Games.
 
GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO, TEAM GREECE: As a team, we are very hungry. The atmosphere is unbelievable. We have nothing to lose. We just got to play 
 
 Greek basketball and go there, give everything that we have.
 
SCHOLES (voice-over): Host France have five NBA players on their team, including Defensive Player of the Year, Rudy Gobert, and Rookie of the 
 
 Year, Victor Wembanyama.
 
VICTOR WEMBANYAMA, TEAM FRANCE: I can't wait. It's really a dream for me to be in the Olympics. Lifelong dream.
 
SCHOLES (voice-over): Serbia has four NBA players led by three-time MVP Nikola Jokic and the Hawks Bogdan Bogdanovic.
 
BOGDAN BOGDANOVIC, TEAM SEBIA: USA is always favorites. It's always, you know, chip on the shoulder playing against USA, every other team.
 
SCHOLES (voice-over): Australia, who just narrowly beat the U.S. in an exhibition game, has eight NBA players and are looking to make some noise.
 
PATTY MILLS, TEAM AUSTRALIA: Last Olympics, we, you know, won a bronze medal, which we call the rose gold game. So, we're looking to do one better 
 
 there.
 
SCHOLES (voice-over): And then there's Canada, with a whopping 10 NBA players on their roster, led by Thunder superstar Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.
 
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER, TEAM CANADA: It goes to show the growth of basketball in the world, not just Canada or the USA or North America, 
 
 whatever it is. The world is becoming really good at basketball. Basketball is becoming a bigger sport. Yes. It's what the game deserves.
 <br>[18:55:00]
 
SCHOLES: The U.S. is, of course, the heavy favorites, but this could be the most competitive and entertaining two weeks of international basketball 
 
 that we've ever seen.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
NEWTON: And we thank Andy Scholes for that preview. What a tournament that's going to be.
 
All right. And finally, on "First Move," as the summer Olympics gear up, an Olympic size concert run is winding down. Billy Joel, the beloved singer, 
 
 songwriter, and of course, the piano man, wrapped up a 10-year residency at New York's Madison Square Garden Thursday night. TV host Jimmy Fallon 
 
 presented the musician with a banner marking his record breaking 150 shows at the venue.
 
You could say Billy Joel is moving out of the garden after the longest time. But he's not giving up on performing or touring. In fact, he has six 
 
 stadium dates booked through November outside of New York. And now, all of those songs that I just quoted for you, you can go see them in person. I'm 
 
 not -- I will not be singing them.
 
All right. That does it for the show. I really want to thank you for being with us. Julia will be right back here on "First Move" on Monday.
