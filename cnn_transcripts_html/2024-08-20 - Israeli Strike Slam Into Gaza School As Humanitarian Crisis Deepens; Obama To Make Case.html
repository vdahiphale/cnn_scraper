THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
<br>[14:00:00] 
 
ISA SOARES, HOST, ISA SOARES TONIGHT:  A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, two Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, one on a 
 
 school, the other at a market. We are live on the ground in central Gaza as rescuers dig with their bare hands looking for survivors. 
 
Plus, it is day two of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, and it's kicking off with some of the biggest names in the party. We're live 
 
 with the latest from the DNC. But first, tonight, new developments in Gaza today are a really a grim reminder of all the lives that are at stake as a 
 
 ceasefire and hostage release proposal languishes on the table. 
 
Rescuers dug with their bare hands through crushed concrete near Gaza city, looking for survivors after an Israeli strike hit a school sheltering 
 
 families. Gaza Civil Defense says at least 12 people were killed, mostly women and children. Israel says it conducted a precise strike on militants 
 
 operating inside the school. 
 
Disturbing scenes in Deir al Balah as well -- have a look at this, where as officials say at least six people were killed in a strike on a market. 
 
 Israel meantime has just released video of its operations to recover the bodies of six hostages. It says soldiers found them in Hamas tunnels in 
 
 Khan Younis, all but one hostage had previously been declared dead. 
 
Hostage families are urgently renewing their call for the government to finalize a ceasefire deal now to bring the remaining   hostages home. And 
 
 in the meantime, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is shoring up regional support for the latest proposal that aims to bridge the gaps 
 
 between Israel and Hamas.
 
He is now in Doha after meeting with Egypt's President -- you can see there in Cairo. Well, our former CNN senior international correspondent Arwa 
 
 Damon is on the ground in Gaza, she's now the President and the Co-founder of the nonprofit organization, International Network for Aid Relief and 
 
 Assistance. 
 
And she witnessed the aftermath of that strike that we were telling you there in Deir al Balah. She joins us now. So, Arwa, you're on the ground, 
 
 you saw casualties coming in outside Al-Aqsa, just give us a sense of what you saw.  
 
ARWA DAMON, PRESIDENT &amp; FOUNDER, INTERNATIONAL NETWORK FOR AID RELIEF &amp; ASSISTANCE:  Yes, I happened to be at Al-Aqsa Hospital, which is just a 
 
 constant flow of, you know, families going to pick up the bodies of the dead, you know, people who are injured, sick, and then all of a sudden, the 
 
 intensity that you see kind of at Al-Aqsa amps up significantly as these ambulances just start roaring and people crowding around them. 
 
We saw a number of children who were being carried out. I saw two children who were very bloodied, being very quickly carried away. Women are 
 
 screaming and wailing. I saw one woman being carried away on a stretcher. I saw a man with a very severe leg jury. And you know, as tragic and as 
 
 horrifying as seeing that is, what makes it even worse, Isa, is what I know because I was inside Al-Aqsa the day before, speaking to the head of the 
 
 ICU.
 
They don't have enough bandages. They have people who are getting infections because they don't have something as basic as sufficient 
 
 bandages. There's a little girl right now in the ICU who is a year-and-a- half old, she needs to be stabilized so that she can be moved to another facility to have surgery there.
 
But they can't do that because there's a very sort of basic tracheostomy or something too, but that they don't have in the right size for her. This is 
 
 a very sort of run-of-the-mill piece of equipment, but they don't have it. And when it comes to this little girl, when she wakes up, she's going to 
 
 find out that she's an orphan. 
 
The rest of her family, her parents or siblings, they're all dead. And so, you stand there and you look at this sort of, you know, flow of bodies of 
 
 ambulances that's coming into a space like Aqsa, and it's really heartbreaking to realize the many different layers of the tragedies that 
 
 unfold here on a daily basis.
 
It's those who are dying and being injured every single day. And it's those who are reaching the hospital, and hospitals are limping along, barely able 
 
 to provide patients what it is that they need. 
 
SOARES:  So, Arwa, and if they can't be seen, if there are no beds and no treatment to help them, where can they go?
 <br>[14:05:00] 
 
DAMON:  Nowhere. 
 
SOARES:  Yes. 
 
DAMON:  You know, I've actually had this conversation with a number of doctors, and how it is that they have to triage constantly. And normally, 
 
 when you think of triage, you think of it as being, you know, sort of in the moments after, you know, something devastating takes place. 
 
But doctors in Gaza are having to triage all the time. One of the doctors that we were speaking to has given us an example of how there was a little 
 
 girl with severe pneumonia that needed to be admitted to the ICU. And he actually very sort of painfully spoke about how initially they don't want 
 
 to admit this girl to the ICU. 
 
Because her treatment, they were estimating would probably take around two to three weeks, and if they kept that bed free, if she wasn't occupying 
 
 that bed in that two to three weeks span, they estimate that they can probably turn over 6-7 patients. 
 
So, he had to make -- and they have to make these calculations all the time. Now in her case in particular, she was actually eventually admitted 
 
 to the ICU, but it's just an example of what happened. Now, I was at Al Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, which is absolutely -- I mean, devastated, 
 
 crushed, apocalyptic earlier today. 
 
And they are the doctors, the head of the pediatric unit is talking about how they make the same calculus all the time. They are discharging patients 
 
 that should not be discharged, because there is not enough space. And they're having to decide when it comes to saving someone's life if it's 
 
 actually going to be worth investing the time to do that.   
 
And if they don't do that, how many other lives can they save, you know, in exchange for it? It's an impossible situation. And I just want to quote 
 
 what one doctor said to me. He said, when we're in the hospital, we have to harden our hearts, but every day when we go home, all we do is cry. 
 
SOARES:  Oh, my goodness. And Arwa, it's just -- you know, we're looking at footage, earlier footage -- if we can play that, actually, Lauren(ph), 
 
 again, ask my producer, the footage that you shot actually, if we can get that from Arwa, because you are of course, the president and founder of the 
 
 NGO INARA.
 
You've been -- you and I have had this conversation. You've been to Gaza numerous times, and you are seeing, Arwa, firsthand, the devastating toll 
 
 the war continues to take on innocent Palestinians here. And those are going into hospitals, but those are staying outside of hospitals also 
 
 facing equally dire situations.
 
I mean, we were reporting that polio, it's been detected in Gaza for the first time in 25 years. Just speak to the conditions. We're looking at your 
 
 video now from inside central Gaza. 
 
DAMON:  So, let me put it to you this way. There are so few hygiene products that are coming in, that doctors at the hospital are having to go 
 
 out and buy their own soap. A bar of soap, which should have cost, you know, 50 cents on the market, cost around $10 to $15. 
 
Hygiene is something that everybody is struggling with, because no hygiene kits are getting in, and what's available on the market is atrociously 
 
 expensive, overpriced, and frankly, not very useful because it's all off- brand and stuff is getting mixed in with everything else.  
 
And what this is resulting in is a number of skin diseases. And some of the skin diseases, and you know, you and our viewers may have seen some of 
 
 these videos of children in the hospital, but it basically starts off as these, like blisters and bumps, and then they pus open, they scab over. 
 
And this particular skin disease is so severe and so dangerous that if left untreated -- is also highly contagious. But if left untreated, it can 
 
 result in kidney failure and kidney failure can result in death. So, there's not enough hygiene, there's not enough toilets, there's not enough 
 
 clean water. 
 
The most recent evacuation orders that have been coming from parts of Khan Younis have meant that a couple of the water treatment plants, desalination 
 
 plants, the water pipes that run into Deir al Balah, resulting inside Deir al Balah, evacuation orders, those have all been impacted. 
 
They're estimating that Deir al Balah and Mawasi, there's going to be a 70 percent decrease in access to clean water. Keep in mind that it was barely 
 
 enough. 
 
SOARES:  Yes. 
 
DAMON:  Hundreds of people are sharing one toilet. There's open sewage all over the place, I mean, even in the ICU, they can't keep an ICU clean. It's 
 
 impossible. And so even in the ICU, you have flies that are settling, you know, on top of patients' injuries. And so, you have hygiene, you have 
 
 hunger, you have, you know, the constant bombardment that is taking place. 
 
And people are being squeezed into the smaller and smaller, you know, space, trying to somehow keep alive and survive. 
 <br>[14:10:00] 
 
SOARES:  Yes, no clean water, and then you have all the sewage as well that plays into this -- that fields of course, fuels these illnesses. Arwa, 
 
 really appreciate you taking the time to speak to us. I know it's been very busy for you, but thank you, Arwa, appreciate it. Well, let's get more on 
 
 the conflict really, and the latest developments when it comes to negotiations. 
 
I want to bring in CNN's Jim Sciutto who is in Tel Aviv for more. And Jim, just talk to us first about this military operation that happened overnight 
 
 in Khan Younis, that led to the recovery of the six bodies of the Israeli hostages. What more can you tell us? What are you hearing from other 
 
 hostages and their families? This is incredibly traumatic, of course, for them. 
 
JIM SCIUTTO, CNN ANCHOR:  Well, first about these bodies brought home, keep in mind, these were six Israelis who were alive when they were captured on 
 
 October 7th. Prior to this operation, the Israeli military was aware that five of the six were already dead, and then they found that the sixth was 
 
 dead as well when they conducted this operation.
 
I think it's important to say their names at a moment like this. They are, Yoram Metzger, Alexander Dancyg, Avraham Munder, Chaim Peri, Nadav 
 
 Popplewell and Yagev Buchshtab, six more, and now that brings down to the number of hostages remaining in Gaza to 109, the vast majority of whom was 
 
 taken -- were taken October 7th.
 
But keep in mind that of that number, the Israeli military believes quite a large number. They haven't specified exactly is also dead. And that's the 
 
 pressure, right, Isa, you hear that the reaction of families today for ten months, they've been calling not just for operations, but for a negotiation 
 
 to get their loved ones home. 
 
And it's in the midst of negotiations to do just that in addition to establishing a ceasefire in Gaza. But those negotiations are not advancing 
 
 at a particularly fast pace. In fact, it's hard to find the news of concrete progress in those talks. And as it extends, as those negotiation 
 
 extends, it becomes more likely that you have situations like today, right?   
 
That the military is bringing home hostages lost, and not hostages that could be reunited with their families. It's a -- it's a tremendous 
 
 disappointment to the families themselves, but also to Israelis who have been protesting, and they were protesting in recent days for a deal for 
 
 some time now. 
 
SOARES:  Yes, so many innocent civilians being killed on both sides. That is for sure. Let's speak about -- 
 
SCIUTTO:  Yes -- 
 
SOARES:  Those negotiations, Jim, because U.S. and Israeli officials have been presenting, I think it's fair to say an optimistic front that a deal 
 
 can be reached here. They both agree on this -- 
 
SCIUTTO:  Yes -- 
 
SOARES:  Bridging proposal. We reported on this yesterday, but Hamas is now saying that -- 
 
SCIUTTO:  Yes -- 
 
SOARES:  Israel has moved the goal post, right? I just wonder, just take a step back for us. Just explain to our viewers because we've been through so 
 
 many variations of this deal. How real is this optimism? Where at the fractures? Do we know exactly what's -- what is in this -- in this bridging 
 
 proposal?  
 
SCIUTTO:  We don't know it word-for-word. It's deliberately the proposal being kept quiet. We know the outlines of it, and it's hard to see, 
 
 frankly, and answer your question, Isa, what the basis is for the cautious optimism you heard over the weekend. 
 
And keep in mind when the U.S. Secretary of State says that the U.S. and Israel agree on this proposal. Hamas is not. And to your point, Hamas has 
 
 said, and the way they described it today is that the U.S. and Israel and including the U.S. President are sharing misleading claims that do not 
 
 reflect the true position of Hamas in these talks. 
 
And I will say that this allegation that the Israeli Prime Minister is moving the goal post here, it's not confined to Hamas on the other side of 
 
 the table. You've heard some criticism here in Israel, and it seems to relate to a number of issues -- I'll give you an example of one of them, 
 
 and that is, who controls, who provides security at the Philadelphi Corridor along the border between Gaza and Egypt? 
 
Because part of the proposal as we knew it was that Israel would no longer provide that security. They would find another mechanism to do so. But it 
 
 appears that the Israeli Prime Minister is insisting on some Israeli role there. And you heard that, Isa, in his statement to hostage families today, 
 
 where he said that yes, we want to get the hostages home. 
 
But I, the Prime Minister will not give up what he called Israel's strategic security assets. So, the space remains between the two parties 
 
 and we'll see if they could find some common ground in the coming -- 
 
SOARES:  Yes -- 
 
SCIUTTO:  Days.  
 
SOARES:  Plenty of pressure within the hawks and is party to, that is for certain, Jim, appreciate it, thank you, good to see you, and Jim will be 
 
 back in about 45 -- 
 
SCIUTTO:  Yes -- 
 
SOARES:  Minutes with his show, thank you, Jim. And still to come this hour, heartbreaking story of survival of a family torn apart in Gaza. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Sharman Sanaa(ph) story is unlike any other we have come across in ten months of war.  
 <br>[14:15:00] 
 
That's because Sanaa(ph) doesn't just accuse Israeli troops of killing her husband Dakram(ph) and daughter, Yasmeen(ph). An Israeli soldier may also 
 
 have saved her life. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
SOARES:  And we'll have Jeremy Diamond's full report in about 15-20 minutes right here on the show. To U.S. politics, after -- to the past, Democrats 
 
 will focus on the future for day two of the convention in Chicago. An adviser to Barack Obama says the former president would deliver a forceful 
 
 affirmation for Vice President Kamala Harris when she takes the stage as a keynote speaker in just a few hours. 
 
Also speaking tonight, former first lady Michelle Obama and second gentleman Doug Emhoff. Meantime, Harris and running mate Tim Walz will be 
 
 in Milwaukee for a campaign rally at the same arena, the same arena Republicans held their convention last month. CNN's national affairs 
 
 correspondent Jeff Zeleny joins us now from the convention in Chicago. 
 
So, Jeff, we're expected to hear really tonight from two -- well, I think it's fair to say the biggest stars, right? And one of the most eloquent 
 
 speakers -- say both eloquent speakers. What are we likely to hear from the Obamas? What is the focus here?    
 
JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT:  But there is no doubt that there's Democratic audience certainly here in their hometown 
 
 of Chicago is very excited and there's high anticipation for the speeches from former first lady Michelle Obama and former President Barack Obama. 
 
I'm told Michelle Obama's speech is going to be much shorter, largely, an introduction for former President Obama. But former President Obama's 
 
 speech is going to be the capstone of the evening, really making the argument, making the case for the election of Vice President Harris. 
 
He has a bit of a long relationship with her. It was 20 years ago this Summer that she was actually in the audience as a young district attorney 
 
 in San Francisco watching his breakout convention speech when he sort of began rising through the ranks of the Democratic Party. She endorsed him 
 
 early on as a presidential candidate. 
 
He helped her in her race, and now he's become one of her most trusted advisors. But I'm told from one of his advisors that the former President 
 
 sees this as an all-hands-on-deck moment for Democrats trying to, you know, certainly rally them behind her candidacy, but make the case that this is 
 
 an important election and draw a stark contrast with the former President Donald Trump as well. 
 
He'll talk about the economy. He is likely to also talk about the Middle East, and he is likely to again draw that sharp contrast. This is not -- I 
 
 mean, as we've seen protesters outside this convention hall to some degree, there were a couple inside here. There is division inside this Democratic 
 
 Party, particularly on the Biden-Harris administration's handling of the war in Gaza. 
 
So, I do expect the former President to at least raise that, and sort of try and refocus the conversation to, would Donald Trump be better on this 
 
 issue? But the big takeaway here is, this is certainly a celebratory moment as the torch was passed last evening, actually, early this morning here in 
 
 Chicago with that long speech from President Biden and Kamala Harris coming on stage there to greet him.   
 
But now it's back to the business of electing her. This is a tough race to come. There is no doubt about that, but the Obamas will be front and center 
 
 tonight as well as Doug Emhoff, he's the second gentleman, Vice President Harris' husband, he'll be making a personal case for her election as well.  
 
SOARES:  Well, there was certainly plenty of energy and enthusiasm, hopefully it -- 
 
ZELENY:  Right -- 
 
SOARES:  Won't be a late one for you today. Jeff, great to see you, thanks very much. And still to come tonight, scenes of intense combat as Ukrainian 
 
 troops trade fire with Russian forces inside Russia. We'll have the latest on the Kursk offensive. Plus, a search continues for the passengers missing 
 
 from a sunken yacht off the coast of Sicily. Ahead, the high profile names missing in there, thank you. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 <br>[14:20:00]
 
SOARES:  Well, we are tracking intense battles inside western Russia as Ukrainian forces tried to push deeper into the Kursk region. Trace of fire 
 
 and flames really roared through the air. In this video from Ukraine's military, they say it's an assault on a well-equipped Russian position and 
 
 their enemies suffered significant losses. 
 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says his military now controls more than 92 settlements in Kursk, but that hasn't stopped Russia from pushing 
 
 ahead with its own advances in Ukraine as our Clare Sebastian reports. 
 
CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Isa, as of now, the most visible Russian response to Ukraine's invasion of the Kursk region has been to push 
 
 harder in Donetsk. Ukraine is now urgently trying to evacuate thousands of civilians out of the town of Pokrovsk because Russia claims more gains in 
 
 the east.
 
Now, Pokrovsk is strategic, six highways converge on the town, roads which have -- Russia took the city, would open the way to other strongholds and 
 
 bring Russia closer to controlling the whole of Donetsk. So, if the core objective of the Kursk incursion was to stretch Russia so thin, it couldn't 
 
 advance in Ukraine, but hasn't worked. 
 
But Ukraine has more than one goal here. Right now, they seem to be still advancing slowly in Kursk. A new video Ukraine released Tuesday showing 
 
 intense fighting still ongoing, but they are also consolidating, blowing up bridges on a critical Russian supply routes, setting up a military office 
 
 to handle law and order in the town of Sudzha, all that fits with the goal of holding onto a buffer zone to prevent cross-border shelling.  
 
And beyond the military goals, we also see a messaging strategy, one that President Zelenskyy made it clear Monday, is targeted in part at the West. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT, UKRAINE (through translator):  We are now witnessing a significant ideological shift, namely the whole naive illusory 
 
 concept of so-called red lines regarding Russia, which dominated the assessment of the war by some partners has crumbled these days, somewhere 
 
 near Sudzha.
 
If partners remove all existing restrictions on the use of weapons on Russian territory, we would not need physical entry, particularly into the 
 
 Kursk region to protect our Ukrainian citizens in the border area and destroy Russia's potential for aggression. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
SEBASTIAN:  Well, his point is that the fear in the West that a nuclear- armed Russia could interpret western arm suppliers as an escalation has not materialized even after Ukraine literally invaded its territory. Ukraine is 
 
 clearly hoping and we don't see this happening yet. 
 
But this will lead to more long-range weapons supplies and fuel restrictions on using them. Isa? 
 
SOARES:  Thank you very much, Clare Sebastian, there. And still to come tonight, new evidence that Israel is repeatedly shrinking its declared 
 
 humanitarian zone for Palestinian civilians in Gaza. We'll bring you that story after this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:25:00] 
 
SOARES:  Welcome back. Well, as we reported at the top of the show, Israel says it has recovered the bodies of six hostages from Gaza, and that its 
 
 soldiers had to enter Hamas tunnels to carry out the complex operation. All but one of the recovered hostages, Avraham Munder, had previously been 
 
 declared dead. 
 
Earlier, CNN's Nic Robertson spoke with Merav Mor Raviv, the niece of Avraham Munder. She told him about the calls she received from the IDF this 
 
 morning. Have a look at this. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
MERAV MOR RAVIV, NIECE OF AVRAHAM MUNDER, WHOSE BODY WAS RETRIEVED FROM GAZA:  Family has her own officer, an army officer, and I just got a call 
 
 from him this morning, early in the morning, and he said that there are -- my uncle's body was released by the army. 
 
We had a small hope that he's still alive, but he was 79 when he was kidnapped. Actually, he had his birthday on December during captivity. We 
 
 knew that he's not in a good condition because we had the hostages that came back the beginning of December, and they told us the conditions were 
 
 terrible. 
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR:  How is your family coping?
 
RAVIV:  I can say lucky, because, you know, we try -- we started thinking in another way of thinking like, you're lucky if the body comes back. It's 
 
 not --
 
ROBERTSON:  Things have -- 
 
RAVIV:  It's not luck --    
 
ROBERTSON:  Things have come so bad -- 
 
RAVIV:  Yes -- 
 
ROBERTSON:  That you were just happy -- 
 
RAVIV:  Yes -- 
 
ROBERTSON:  To have a body -- 
 
RAVIV:  Yes, but it's not. I mean, I can't -- I don't want it to be like normal thing -- 
 
ROBERTSON:  Did Prime Minister Netanyahu do enough? Could he have saved Avraham?
 
RAVIV:  Of course, I'm sure of that. 
 
ROBERTSON:  Does this leave you angry that -- 
 
RAVIV:  Of course -- 
 
ROBERTSON:  There was a government -- 
 
RAVIV:  Of course, of course. 
 
ROBERTSON:  What's your message now to the Prime Minister now you have this horrible sad news?
 
RAVIV:  That the values I was raised in Israel were life and they're holy. Can you say the holy of life?   
 
ROBERTSON:  Yes -- 
 
RAVIV:  Of being alive, and the friendship, that you don't leave your friend in the battle or whatever, and suddenly, those values just went 
 
 away. We were saying all the time that there is no time for the hostages. We knew it from the first day.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ISA SOARES, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST:  And that was now our Nic Robertson speaking with Merav Mor Raviv, the niece of Avraham Munder.
 
While Iran has issued a fresh warning to Israel saying that it won't take any, quote, hasty action as it weighs how to retaliate after the 
 
 assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh. A general in Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps was quoted in state media as saying, time is 
 
 on our side. And a waiting period for Iran's response may be prolonged. Our Fred Pleitgen is in Tehran and spoke to the former head of Iran's Islamic 
 
 Revolutionary Guard Corps earlier today about what Iran's next steps could be.
 
And Fred joins me now. So, Fred, have you got in any sense from your conversation here whether an attack or some sort of retaliation on Israel 
 
 is imminent? What did he tell you?
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, the Iranians continue to say that there is going to be retaliation against 
 
 Israel. But certainly, some of the things that we heard today seem to offer some pretty interesting nuances to that. You mentioned some of them where 
 
 the spokesman for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said that he believes that time is on Iran's side. There won't be any hasty action.
 
But the other thing that we looked at very closely was also the Iranian saying that the response that is going to come may look very different than 
 
 the last time Iran struck Israel, which, of course, was after the bombing of Iran's embassy compound in Damascus when they launched hundreds of 
 
 drones and missiles towards Israeli territory. A lot of those were intercepted, but some of them did come through.
 
And you are absolutely right. I did speak to the former head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, who is still in the expediency council here in 
 
 Iran, and he said that he believes that the response coming from the Iranians, while it's unclear when it's going to be, is going to be 
 
 extremely tough. Here's what he said.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MOHSEN REZAEE, FORMER IRGC HEAD (through translator):  The occupying power of Jerusalem is a regime that will continue its evil acts if it does not 
 
 receive a harsh response. Also, the United States and Europe have not been able to control this regime.
 
PLEITGEN:  How does Iran find the right measure to prevent this from turning into a bigger war in the region?
 
REZAEE (through translator):  We have investigated the possible repercussions, and we will not let Netanyahu, who is sinking in a swamp, 
 
 save himself. The Iranian actions will be very calculated ones.
 
PLEITGEN:  The United States has threatened Iran, though, with what they call cataclysmic consequences if Iran strikes Israel. What's your reaction 
 
 to that?
 
REZAEE (through translator):  The U.S. is highly vulnerable to Iran. The commanders of the U.S. military are aware of Iran's capabilities. 
 
 Therefore, they will avoid taking action against Iran.
 
On the other hand, the U.S. is facing problems regarding their own defense coasts. There has to be a ceasefire in Gaza soon. The United States and 
 
 Israel should not repeat their mistakes. If in the first weeks of the Gaza war, the United States had stopped Israel and Netanyahu, the war would not 
 
 extend.
 
So, the main element of the extension of the war are the U.S. and Israel. The more this war extends, the more the United States will be damaged.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
PLEITGEN:  So, that's something similar what you said that we've actually heard from a lot of Iranian officials in the past couple of days that we've 
 
 been here on the ground where all of them say they do believe that a ceasefire is necessary. They hope that a ceasefire will happen, but at the 
 
 same time, a lot of them are very skeptical that one can happen in the current negotiations that are taking place. Isa.
 
SOARES:  Our Fred Pleitgen for us in Tehran this evening. Thanks very much, Fred.
 
Well, one thing we have heard over and over from aid workers on the ground in Gaza, in fact, we've heard it from our Arwa Damon just in the last 20 
 
 minutes, is that there is nowhere safe for civilians to go. Israel has outlined what it calls a humanitarian zone, but it has significantly 
 
 reduced that area in size multiple times.
 
A CNN analysis found that the cleared zone, have a look at this, has shrunk it 35 percent over the last month. It now stretches just 40 square 
 
 kilometers or about 15 square miles for Gaza's population of more than 2 million people. These satellite images show how many Palestinians fled 
 
 areas no longer designated humanitarian zones. The IDF said they had to shrink the boundaries because of rocket fire and, quote, terrorist

Well, among the tens of thousands of stories of families torn apart in Gaza, there are so many remnants of families left behind. Our Jeremy 
 
 Diamond met one woman, who not only blames the Israeli military for taking away her husband and daughter, she also credits them for saving her life.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Five-year-old Sham's eyes are a portal to the past she cannot forget. There are the 
 
 streets and homes scarred by war. This building where she recited her final prayers. And then there is the indelible sight of her father and sister, 
 
 shot dead before her eyes.
 <br>[14:35:00]
 
Sham's mother, Sanaa, who suffered burns as a child, will never forget that day.
 
SANAA ABU TABAQ, SURVIVES ATTACK THAT KILLED HUSBAND AND DAUGHTER (through translator):  I wish we hadn't returned. I lost the most precious people.
 
DIAMOND (voice-over):  But there's more to their story than tragedy and loss in war-torn Gaza. Sham and Sanaa's story is unlike any other we have 
 
 come across in 10 months of war. That's because Sanaa doesn't just accuse Israeli troops of killing her husband Akram and daughter Yasmeen. An 
 
 Israeli soldier may also have saved her life.
 
On November 24th, the weeklong truce between Israel and Hamas begins. Thousands of people begin heading back to their homes in Northern Gaza. 
 
 Sanaa and her family are among them. But as they approach the Salatin neighborhood where they lived, they find themselves walking alone. And 
 
 then, shots ring out.
 
ABU TABAQ (through translator):  May God have mercy on her soul, Yasmeen. One bullet in her back and one in her shoulder. I was hit in my leg. And my 
 
 husband was hit in his stomach. So, we all sat on the ground. We couldn't move. And we were bleeding. Sham is the only one who wasn't hit.
 
DIAMOND (voice-over):  Her husband soon decides to crawl away to try to find help, but moments later, he is shot again, fatally.
 
Sanaa lies on the ground, bleeding, cradling her eldest daughter, Yasmeen.
 
ABU TABAQ (through translator):  She was saying, mom, did you die? Please don't die and leave us. I'm still alive. I held her and I told her, no, my 
 
 dear, we are not going to die. The ambulance is coming. I was trying to give her hope. Even though I knew there was no hope.
 
DIAMOND:  As a mother, I mean, you must have felt absolutely helpless in that moment.
 
ABU TABAQ (through translator):  I wasn't able to do anything, and that was the hardest situation. I couldn't. She was even asking for water, and I 
 
 couldn't give her water.
 
DIAMOND (voice-over):  Yasmeen soon died in her mother's arms. For hours, Sanaa lies here with Sham, unable to move until she finally finds the 
 
 strength to crawl down the street and into this nearby home. We obtained footage from that house after our first interview with Sanaa. This is the 
 
 first time she and Sham are seeing it.
 
ABU TABAQ (through translator):  This is the bathroom we hid in.
 
DIAMOND (voice-over):  And Sham begins to tell my colleague, Abeer Salman, what happened to her.
 
ABEER SALMAN, CNN JOURNALIST (through translator):  What happened in the morning?
 
SHAM (through translator):  The tanks came.
 
SALMAN (through translator):  How do you know the tanks had come?
 
SHAM (through translator):  I heard their sound.
 
ABU TABAQ (through translator):  I told her, they've reached us. We recited the Shahada. She said, hide me so I don't see them when they shoot me.
 
DIAMOND (voice-over):  An explosion then rocks the bathroom. Israeli soldiers enter the house and call out in Arabic. What happens next is 
 
 captured on muted body camera footage provided by the Israeli military. Two soldiers treating Sanaa's gunshot wound.
 
ABU TABAQ (through translator):  I told him, please have mercy. Didn't you see my daughter who was killed at the door? I beg you, please don't kill 
 
 us, it's enough. He told me, it wasn't us who killed her. I was Sinwar. I told him, I have nothing to do with Sinwar, or anyone else. You took my 
 
 daughter and you took everything.
 
DIAMOND (voice-over):  The medic soon realizes her condition is serious. She needs to get to a hospital.
 
ABU TABAQ (through translator):  The one who spoke Arabic started to make his calls. Then he tole me, we decided to help you and take you with us.
 
DIAMOND (voice-over):  Israeli soldiers carry Sanaa out of the building on a stretcher, her hands clutching Sham. Nothing about this footage should be 
 
 extraordinary. Militaries must protect and care for wounded civilians when possible under international law. But in this war, this sight is 
 
 exceedingly rare.
 
For eight months, Sanaa and Sham have lived in this Jerusalem hospital. Their journey here was no less traumatic. Interrogation and strip searches 
 
 came before treatment at an Israeli hospital. Israeli authorities are now planning to send them back to Gaza next month, unless another country takes 
 
 them in.
 
The Israeli military, for its part, told CNN in a statement that Sanaa and her family were caught in the crossfire. The IDF says its soldiers issued 
 
 verbal warnings after the family stumbled upon a concealed military position, drawing a militant attack.
 <br>[14:40:00]
 
The four people who entered in the area were caught in the intense exchange of fire between the terrorists and our troops. The troops did not open fire 
 
 at the four people, nor did they aim at them.
 
ABU TABAQ (through translator):  They are lying. There was nobody in that area.
 
DIAMOND:  I wonder, what would you say to that one soldier if you could see him again?
 
ABU TABAQ (through translator):  It's true he helped me. But he also took from me the most precious thing I had. I can't even thank him, because he 
 
 had mercy for us by the will of God, not by his own will. Because if he had compassion, he wouldn't have deprived me of the dearest people to my heart.
 
DIAMOND (voice-over):  Sanaa's pain is as raw as ever and seeing her home again in footage filmed this spring brings a flood of emotion.
 
ABU TABAQ (through translator):  These are Yasmeen and Sham's shoes. I bought these shoes for Eid.
 
DIAMOND (voice-over):  Mundane objects are transformed into relics.
 
ABU TABAQ (through translator):  This is Yasmeen's dress and this is Sham's dress. She always loved pink. This is her dress.
 
DIAMOND (voice-over):  And Sanaa is taken back in time, to the life she will never get back.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
SOARES:  Well, in just a few hours from now, the second night of the DNC will get underway, and authorities are taking new steps to ensure that a 
 
 safe convention.
 
Chicago police say they have arrested four protesters after they breached an outer security fence near the United Center on Monday. Those 
 
 demonstrators broke off from a large march. That is protesting against Israel's war in Gaza. In response to the breach, about a dozen workers 
 
 installed the first row -- a third row, I should say, of fencing today.
 
I want to bring in our law enforcement correspondent, Whitney Wild, who is live for us in Chicago. And Whitney, it's looking certainly calmer now. 
 
 Give us a sense of the -- what the law enforcement, the securities have been tightened, what's been done.
 
WHITNEY WILD, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT CORRESPONDENT:  Well, right now, a lot of what you see is greater physical security. So, if you walk over here, what 
 
 we've seen for several days now are these eight-foot non-scalable fences. But we've seen them have this additional pane, Isa. So, this top panel was 
 
 not here the first few days that we were out here. That's something new that went up overnight.
 
In addition, there's more fortification of the actual fence itself. Some more bolts there. And then further, what you see is just more fence. So, 
 
 right here we have this second layer of offense that stretches several blocks here. So, law enforcement looking for physical ways to try to 
 
 fortify the security apparatus here.
 <br>[14:45:00]
 
Yesterday's protest was not unexpected. The law enforcement actually had anticipated that around 20,000 people or so would be coming down to march 
 
 around Chicago and they had a specific route that they were permitted to go. They went a little beyond some areas.
 
But for the most part, this was a peaceful protest. There were around 3,500 people that showed up in the end, and it was really just a handful of 
 
 people who ended up breaching that fence in two locations. And what we know now from law enforcement is that there were 10 arrests here. And then in 
 
 total, there were 13 arrests that were associated with protests throughout the city. And some of those charges range from criminal trespass to 
 
 actually aggravated assault on a police officer.
 
So, certainly, a very tense day and it's not a great way to start. Isa, as you point out this event goes on for several more days and law enforcement 
 
 earlier made very clear that they expect that there are going to be more protests and they're anticipating more challenges ahead. Isa.
 
SOARES:  So, we're expecting more protests today. Because I remember, Whitney, this time yesterday, it was already quite lively. Do we have a 
 
 sense of how large these today's protests are going to be?
 
WILD:  We're still waiting to find out. So, some of the protests that are supposed to kick off are unpermitted. There's an unpermitted protest that's 
 
 supposed to happen later. So, we'll have to see how that manifests. But the big question is what protesters are going to take away from what the police 
 
 response was here.
 
I mean, if you're seeing these -- there are people in the crowd who are intent on agitating and they see that they're quickly placed under arrest 
 
 and may face charges and prosecution pretty quickly, they may be less inclined to cause problems like that, which would preserve the real right 
 
 of those other protesters who did protest peacefully to march through the city and exercise their First Amendment right.
 
And what Chicago police have made clear is that they and they did as much, and they could to try to allow these protesters enough space, enough time 
 
 to voice their concerns. That yesterday was a pro-Palestinian march. And like I said, the police had anticipated that march. And so, they wanted to 
 
 give that march enough space. And of these 3,500 people that came out, it was really just, you know, a couple dozen or so people that ended up 
 
 breaching this fence and causing a problem.
 
So, we'll see moving forward as anyone's guess, but certainly, police are ready for any challenges.
 
SOARES:  Whitney Wild there for us. Thanks very much, Whitney. Appreciate it.

 U.S. over the sale of his company.
 
A local fisherman who was waiting out the storm saw the ill-fated yacht.
 
FABIO CEFALU, FISHERMAN (through translator):  We waited about 10 minutes to see the intensity of the tornado, and we went out to sea. We were first 
 
 to give rescue, but we found no one at sea. We only found cushions and the remains of the boat.
 
NADEAU (voice-over):  The luxury yacht, 72-meter, 236-foot aluminum mast snapped in the storm, sending 15 people into the sea, including a one-year-
 
 old girl whose mother carried her above her head in the waves, she told reporters.
 
The survivors, including all 10 crew members, were rescued by a nearby sailboat who found them in a lifeboat.
 
KARSTEN BORNER, SAILOR:  There was 15 people inside.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  15 people?
 
BORNER:  Yes, 15 people inside. Four people injured. Three heavy injured. Yes. And we brought them to our ship. And then, we communicated with the 
 
 Coast Guard. And after some time, the Coast Guard came and later they picked injured people. And when we went two hours later, they picked up the 
 
 other people.
 
NADEAU (voice-over):  The local prosecutor has opened an investigation to determine whether the tragedy could have been averted or if circumstances 
 
 were beyond anyone's control.
