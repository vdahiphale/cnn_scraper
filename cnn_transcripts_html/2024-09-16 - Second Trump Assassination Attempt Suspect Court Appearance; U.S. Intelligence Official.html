JIM ACOSTA, CNN ANCHOR: Back in just a moment. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ACOSTA:  A lot of questions this morning about the second apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump. We're learning the acting director of the Secret Service will remain in Florida indefinitely to oversee the investigation. Donald trump is praising the agency for a quote, "absolutely outstanding" job protecting him.
 
But questions remain about how the suspect got so close. 58-year-old Ryan Routh is in federal court right now in West Palm Beach Florida shackled and in prison scrubs. And we should hear more -- president a few hours from now when he hosts a virtual campaign event.
 <br>[10:35:00]
 
And CNN political commentator Michael Singleton joins me now. Shermichael, I mean, you and I were talking about this during the commercial break. I mean, the rhetoric in this country right now -- and we were talking about with Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill a few moments ago, it's so ramped up right now. It's so superheated that you just worry what might happen between now and election day.
 
SHERMICHAEL SINGLETON, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR AND REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Yes. I mean, look, I think a lot of people, Jim, are discontent. Political disillusionment, I believe, have set in. We've seen a lot of disintegration of our typical norms. I think you've seen a heightened number of Americans feel a sense of purposelessness.
 
And I think if you were to ask Republican voters who support Trump some of their views on the other side, they'd probably say these folks are perhaps a threat to my existence, a way of life. And I think if you were to ask folks who are Democrats, there may be some folks who point to reproductive rights being changed and say this is a threat to my life and existence.
 
And so, what you're seeing is that people in the country are looking at others as literally wanting to erase their existence. And so, I'm not surprised that when you see political rhetoric that you would typically normally see during heightened political times of turning into people wanting to actualize their anger, their fear, their anxieties by attempting to cause harm to political leaders, it certainly worries me.
 
And at some point, you have to imagine that this is likely going to get worse as we get closer to November. And the former president, thank God, was lucky these both times. But what happens if someone actually is able to take out this act, whether it's against him or someone on the other side? Imagine what that's going to do to the country.
 
ACOSTA:  Yes. And I do want to ask you about this fundraising, you know, that the Trump campaign put out moments after this apparent assassination attempt. Trump was saying in this, my resolve is only stronger after another attempt on my life. I will never slow down. I will never give up. I'll never surrender. I thank God every day for having supporters like you on my side.
 
I mean, very much, you know, there's no amping up of the rhetoric there. He has been doing it obviously with what's happening in Springfield, Ohio and so on. When he makes some comments later on today, what do you hope to hear from him?
 
SINGLETON:  I think the former president, one, needs to thank the Secret Service agent who was able to see that gunman. Thank God the guy wasn't able to get any shots. off when the former president got closer. So, that's a good thing. But I think he needs to really speak to the American people about, yes, this is a divisive moment because this is a political contest, but the contest should be based upon the intellectual exchange of ideas not this -- what appears to be our innate abilities to have anger and resentment and disgust for people who we believe don't see the world the way we believe it should be ran or should be led or should exist.
 
I think the former president should probably talk to the American people about the importance of reaching across the aisle to people who may be different and say, look, maybe you view the world a little differently, but figure out ways to agree on some things that really do impact all of us, whether it's our children, or maybe it's the fact that we need to figure out ways to improve our infrastructure, or maybe it's the fact that we need to come together so that our standing across the globe that resolve we once had, Jim, is still recognized by our allies.
 
I mean, there are moments where I think the American people can come together. And this certainly, I hope, could be one of them.
 
ACOSTA:  And what about some of these reactions that you've seen? I'm sure you've seen him, where you know, there are folks on the right saying, you know, people on the left, Democrats wanted this to happen. They want this to happen.
 
SINGLETON:  That's that goes back to my point, Jim, of people -- 
 
ACOSTA:  Nobody wants this to happen.
 
SINGLETON:  I would hope no one wants this to happen.
 
ACOSTA:  Nobody wants this to happen. And that goes back to my point. I've seen posts from some people saying, why did the shooter miss? I've seen posts to the comments that you just made, and it goes to the very point that I was making in my initial comments of people viewing others as an existential threat to their existence.
 
And when you view individuals through that lens, it does not surprise me that we find ourselves in this particular moment in time where people are angry at the other side, where people believe if things don't go their way, they question what does the future look like for them, for their families, for their interests. And I think more than ever, this is probably the best moment for political leaders to try to redirect some of this negative energy into a positive direction.
 
ACOSTA:  Yes. Well, and patriotism to me is all about wanting us, as Americans, to come together, right? Not going after one another. To me, that's patriotism. That's making America great as somebody who wants to bring us together as a country, political forces that want to bring us together as a country.
 
SINGLETON:  I mean, this country will be no more and no less than what we make it. And I think sometimes we, as Americans, have become a bit arrogant about what negatively could happen in our country that we have seen in other countries. Oh, we are somehow absolved of internal chaos and turmoil. Well, what we're finding is that we're not absolved of those things at all.
 <br>[10:40:00]
 
And what we're finding is that the issues that have divided other countries and that have led to dictatorships and totalitarian states and fascism, et cetera, it is very well possible that those things can occur within our own country. The idea of a democratic form of government is not perfect. It is fragile and we're seeing it.
 
And so, my hope as a political strategist, as an American, is that people come together despite the differences to recognize. If we do not, what comes next? What comes next for the future of this country?
 
And think about this, Jim, our adversaries are looking at this moment of internal chaos within the country, and they're trying to figure out, how can we push to needle a bit forward?
 
ACOSTA:  How can we exploit this?
 
SINGLETON:  Absolutely.
 
ACOSTA:  And you have to think that there are forces out there who want to continue to gin up division and hatred because it works to their benefit.
 
SINGLETON:  China, Russia, Iran. Who knows whoever else is out there attempting this as well.
 
ACOSTA:  Excellent point. That's why we always enjoy having you on, Shermichael.
 
SINGLETON:  Thanks, Jim.
 
ACOSTA:  Shermichael Singleton, thanks so much. We'll be right back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:45:00]
 
ACOSTA:  CNN is learning that U.S. intelligence officials recently briefed the Trump campaign about new threats from Iran's regime. CNN's Zachary Cohen joins us now. Zach, what are we learning about the nature of these threats to Trump and his campaign?
 
ZACHARY COHEN, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTER:  Yes, Jim, we're learning through sources that senior intel officials did brief the Trump campaign recently, prior to yesterday's incident at Trump's golf course, that Iran does appear to be planning -- escalating their plans to attack and to target Donald Trump and the people around him. As part of this broader persistent threat stream that U.S. intelligence officials have been tracking for several months now, but they've brought this new evidence to the table. to the Trump campaign and warning them that there is -- are signs that that threat could be escalating.
 
And, you know, it's notable, Jim, because this take -- this briefing took place prior to, again, the second attempted assassination of Donald Trump. And yet, a second person in as many months was still able to get as close as they did to the former president, really reigniting those same concerns that happened on July 13th about the security protocol and the security posture around Donald Trump, not just as it relates to domestic threats, but also foreign ones.
 
We know that Iran has been behind attempted assassination plots of Donald Trump and other former and current U.S. officials in the past. We know that there was recently actually an arrest in a case stemming from 3rd -- or July 13th rally Iranian assassination plot. So, this threat still persists.
 
U.S. intelligence officials remain concerned about the ability of the Secret Service to protect Donald Trump. And this is just the latest indication of that threat coming from Iran.
 
ACOSTA:  Yes. And, Zach, is there any indication as to what is fueling this Iranian targeting of the former president?
 
COHEN:  Yes, Jim, the motivation seems to be twofold. One, the killing of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani back when Donald Trump was president. That did land Donald Trump and several of his top administration officials on a hit list of swords. Iran continues to vow retribution for the killing of Soleimani.
 
But also, more recently, we've seen U.S. officials warn that Iran is trying to undermine and actively influence the 2024 election outcome and undermine Donald Trump's candidacy specifically. So, clearly linking Donald Trump as the candidate that's not in their best national security interest and doing everything they can to keep him out of the White House. And that includes both assassination plots and threats against physical violence as well as cyber operations targeting his campaign.
 
ACOSTA:  All right. Zach, thank you very much. Always appreciate it. Thanks a lot.
 
Coming up, 15 minutes to fight for its life. TikTok making its case to stay in the U.S., but will it be enough? That's next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:50:00]
 
ACOSTA:  Right now, TikTok is on the clock. The widely popular social media platform is in court trying to convince judges in just 15 minutes to strike down a new law that could ban the Chinese-owned app in the U.S. CNN Media Correspondent Hadas Gold joins us now.
 
Hadass, is that correct, they only have 15 minutes to make their case. What's happening right now in court? What can you tell us?
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN MEDIA CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Jim. So, as we speak, actually, attorneys for TikTok creators are now making the argument in front of the judge as to why TikTok should not be banned. TikTok attorney has already spoken now. They only had about half an hour for each side. But that stretches out because judges later ask questions, then there might be rebuttals.
 
But the reason that there is such a tight timeframe is because if you remember that law that was passed that sets up this potential ban of TikTok, says that any legal challenge had to bypass Federal district court and go straight to where it's now being argued in the U.S. Court of Appeals in D.C. within a very tight timeframe.
 
There is a very tight timeframe here because this law that was passed sets TikTok up to potentially be banned if it's not sold off from its Chinese ownership by mid-January. So, we're just talking about not only a tight timeline right now in court, but also a tight timeline in general. We're just months away from this potential ban.
 
So, right now, as we speak, there is a three-judge panel. There's no jury. It's just a three-judge panel that's taking -- that's right now asking questions to the lawyers for some of these TikTok creators who are also arguing against this ban. They're also going to hear from the U.S. government and their argument and ask questions from those attorneys as well.
 
Now, what exactly is this law? If you remember, this law was a bipartisan law that passed very, very quickly through Congress. It was signed by President Biden. And what it says is that this -- as TikTok can still exist, but it cannot be under Chinese ownership. And the U.S. is arguing that because -- it's because of mostly national security concerns to say that the government of China could be collecting sensitive data on the users. They're also worried about propaganda use. And some of their reasonings are actually sealed. And so, we can't see them, but the judges can see them.
 
TikTok is saying this is a First Amendment violation and it's a constitutional overreach and that these securities concerns are speculative concerns. Now, whoever loses will likely appeal. The Supreme Court is expected to hear this case and it will likely decide before this ban could take effect in January, Jim.
 
ACOSTA:  Yes, I was going to say, when might this all get resolved? This is -- I mean, this question has been kicked around for some time now.
 
GOLD:  Yes, exactly. So, this court -- these judges that are hearing this case right now are expected within a matter of weeks to decide. Now, whichever way it goes, whether the government wins or TikTok will win, either side will appeal. And the Supreme Court is expected to hear this and they are expected to decide on this, likely before the ban will take effect and jarring.
 <br>[10:55:00]
 
And this is important because it's not just going to affect TikTok and the more than 170 million users who use it and whether they'll be able to still have access to it because the Chinese government has said they can't use the algorithm -- or they won't sell it elsewhere, it will also have a very, very important effect on how the internet, how internet speech is regulated in this country going forward.
 
ACOSTA:  I look forward to seeing all the takes on this on TikTok while it's still there. All right. Hadas Gold, thank you very much. Really appreciate it.
 
And thanks for joining us this morning. I'm Jim Acosta. Our next hour of Newsroom with Wolf Blitzer starts after a short break. Have a good day.
