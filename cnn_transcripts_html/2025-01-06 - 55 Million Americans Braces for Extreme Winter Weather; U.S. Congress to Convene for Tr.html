MAX FOSTER, CNN LONDON CORRESPONDENT AND ANCHOR: Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us from the U.S. and all around the world. I'm Max Foster, in London. 
 
Just ahead, bracing for a bitter cold. A dangerous combination of snow, ice and freezing rain threatening millions of Americans from the central plains to the east coast.
 
Donald Trump's return to power exactly four years after his supporters swarmed the U.S. Capitol. Congress will convene to certify the President-elect's victory in the 2024 election. 
 
And new details reveal that the suspect behind the deadly New Year's terror attack on New Orleans has scoped out the scene, or had scoped out the scheme. Just ahead, a timeline of events leading up to the attack. 
 
UNKNOWN (voice-over): Live from London, this is "CNN Newsroom" with Max Foster. 
 
FOSTER: Well, more than 55 million Americans are under winter storm alerts across the U.S., with a powerful weather system dumping a dangerous mix of snow and ice throughout the Midwest and mid-Atlantic regions.
 
Blizzard warnings are in effect in Kansas and Missouri, where tens of thousands of people are without power and stores are running out of essential goods. 
 
Wintry thunderstorms have been hitting parts of Kentucky, Illinois and Indiana, too. Roads in the region are covered in thick layers of ice, causing numerous accidents over the weekend.
 
The mayor of Washington, D.C., has declared a snow emergency as the district prepares for several major events, including the certification of the presidential election and funeral services for former President Jimmy Carter. Some places could see more than 16 inches or 40 centimeters of snow as the system continues to move eastwards. 
 
On Saturday, CNN spoke with the mayor of Louisville, Kentucky, who discussed how the state is preparing for the peak snowfall expected later today.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MAYOR CRAIG GREENBERG (D), LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY: This has been a significant storm for us. We haven't seen this much snow in about a decade in Louisville, and it still continues. 
 
We're expecting snow tomorrow morning. So, our main focus is two areas. One, the roads, making sure we continue to work through the night to keep the roads clear. We're encouraging people to stay home, to stay warm, stay informed, and also power outages.
 
Our local electricity company here, LG&amp;E, they've got a thousand people on standby that are ready. With respect to the roads, we've been plowing and salting the roads all day. We have over 200 people that are working hard on our snow team across the entire city. We're going to keep at it. 
 
With the freezing temperatures that are projected for the entire week, this is a particularly challenging storm, but we're going to stay at it. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: The nation's capital also bracing for the winter blast as Washington's mayor declared a snow emergency, and federal police are on heightened alert as Congress will meet to certify the results of the 2024 election.
 
House Speaker Mike Johnson said no matter how hard it snows, the results will be certified today. Today's certification will mark a striking political turnaround for Donald Trump, of course, who was widely condemned for his actions on this day four years ago when a mob of his supporters stormed the Capitol. 
 
Vice President Harris, who lost to Trump in November, will fulfill her duties as President of the Senate and preside over the counting of the electoral votes from each state in today's joint session.
 
Our Steve Contorno is in West Palm Beach near Mar-a-Lago with the latest on how the Republicans are planning for their return to the White House. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
STEVE CONTORNO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Members of Congress will meet on Capitol Hill on Monday to officially certify the election of Donald Trump. 
 
It's a typically mundane process, but it takes on added significance this year because of what happened four years ago when supporters of Donald Trump tried to halt the certification of Joe Biden's electoral victory.
 
The date also marks two weeks until Donald Trump is officially sworn in during his inauguration, and Republicans are already planning how to push through an aggressive agenda in his first 100 days that includes sweeping tax cuts, border security enhancements, and raising the debt limit. 
 
However, there is already some differences among Republican leaders on how exactly that can be accomplished. 
 
REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA), SPEAKER OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: I think at the end of the day, President Trump is going to prefer, as he likes to say, one big beautiful bill. 
 
And there's a lot of merit to that because we can put it all together, one big up or down vote which can save the country, quite literally, because there are so many elements to it, and it will give us a little bit more time to negotiate that and get it right. 
 <br>[03:05:00]
 
SEN. JOHN THUNE (R-SD), U.S. SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: We have the same set of objectives, we want to get to the same destination, but I think at times there will be differences in how we get there. 
 
And understanding the unique aspects of how the Senate operates is something that I'm going to have to be able to share and convey to the President and help him understand, I think, what the contours are of what we can accomplish here in the Senate and what's realistic.
 
CONTORNO: Trump's transition team is already looking ahead to his inauguration with a rally plan for the night before in Washington, D.C., as Trump tries to keep his supporters engaged and energized heading into his next term. 
 
Steve Contorno, CNN, West Palm Beach, Florida. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
FOSTER: Earlier, CNN spoke with the only Republican lawmaker representing New York City in Congress. We asked whether she had any concerns about the Speaker's plan to get Trump's ambitious agenda passed. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. NICOLE MALLIOTAKIS (R-NY): Well, obviously, it's going to be a big task, and it is challenging considering we have a majority of one in the House, but I do believe that we made significant progress this past week. 
 
We were able to elect Speaker Johnson united in just one round of voting, and we had a very good meeting yesterday where we went over the game plan, we went over the procedures of what is allowed, what's not allowed in a budget reconciliation bill.
 
And we have a framework right now, which we are beginning to hash out the details. And so, I think that as long as we have good communication in our conference, the Speaker keeps us informed of what he wants to do, what his goals are, as does the president. And we get buy-in and consensus. We can do these things that you mentioned.

FOSTER: America's top diplomat reiterating U.S. support for South Korea's democracy as the country grapples with its ongoing political crisis. During his visit to Seoul, Secretary of State Antony Blinken sat down with South Korea's acting president and reaffirmed U.S. confidence in the, quote, "enduring strength of the U.S. and South Korean alliance."
 
Blinken is the first high-level U.S. official to visit the country since the political turmoil began last month. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Korea's democracy has been tested in recent weeks, just as American democracy has faced challenges throughout our history. 
 
But you are responding by demonstrating your democratic resilience. The United States has full confidence in South Korea's institutions, and we reaffirm our unwavering support for the Korean people as they work tirelessly to uphold those institutions. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: Blinken's visit comes as South Korea's anti-corruption agency plans to seek an extension of an arrest warrant for impeached President Yoon Suk-yeol. It's set to expire at midnight local time.
 
Yoon is accused of abuse of power and leading an insurrection over his brief, botched attempt to impose martial law last month. The country's corruption investigation office is now delegating the execution of that warrant to the police, who are said to be reviewing the request. 
 
Joining me now from Seoul is In-Bum Chun, a retired lieutenant general with the South Korean army. Thank you so much for joining us. 
 
We heard Blinken there talking about how the institutions, the democratic institutions in South Korea are working. Do you think they really are? Because it feels completely chaotic with the institutions working, well, not being entirely clear on what they're meant to be doing in this situation.
 
LT. GEN. IN-BUM CHUN (RET.), SOUTH KOREAN ARMY: Yes, it seems democracy is chaotic, but that's the process that we all agreed upon. And I agree. Yes, our institutions are working so far. It looks chaotic, but I just think that that's the nature of democracy. 
 
FOSTER: Can you just explain for people who are quite lost in all of this where we are at this point? 
 
CHUN: Wow, that's a big order. So, as you know, President Yoon did execute a failed martial law attempt. He was impeached or was in the process of being impeached by the constitutional courts. 
 
During the process, his acting replacement, the prime minister, was not appointing the three constitutional judges that were absent. The opposition then impeached him. And now we have the deputy prime minister as the acting president. 
 
The corruption agency, its formal designation is the Senior Civil Servant Corruption Investigation Unit. That's a big mouthful. But they were put in charge of executing a legal accusation of treason against President Yoon. 
 
President Yoon and his lawyers are saying this is illegal and the jurisdiction is absurd. According to Yoon and his lawyers, they are only required under the impeachment process through the constitutional courts to be responsible for.
 <br>[03:10:08]
 
So, they do not accept the jurisdiction of the prosecutor's office, the police, nor especially the Senior Civil Servant Corruption Unit. So, that's where they're not accepting the arrest warrant. 
 
And oh, by the way, the police have just said that they don't feel that it is their responsibility to execute the arrest warrant. Once this arrest warrant expires, there will be other counterclaims about its legality. And it's going to take some more time to see whether this is who's going to win. 
 
But for the time being, it's going to be very difficult to actually execute an arrest warrant against Mr. Yoon. 
 
FOSTER: Obviously, it would be the police who would execute an arrest warrant. So, this appears to be the block right now. They need to accept that arrest warrant and then carry it out. So, where's their issue here? 
 
CHUN: So, the police do not think that it is their responsibility. Also, I think the police are also looking at whether jurisdiction from the corruption agency is correct or not. So, their position is also a little bit not firm.
 
So again, it looks chaotic, but the system is where people need to agree on what the real legalities are. And that's where we are right now. For the time being, the police said they're not going to execute the arrest warrant.
 
FOSTER: OK, In-Bum Chun in Seoul. Good luck trying to navigate through that, but as you say, it is democracy as it works in South Korea. Thank you. 
 
FOSTER; Now, Japan's Nippon Steel says it may take legal action against the U.S. government. That's after President Biden decided to block Nippon's $14 billion takeover of U.S. steel.
 
Mr. Biden said he took the action out of concern for national security and supply chains. The Steel Workers Union, which opposes the deal, praised his decision. But the president and CEO of U.S. Steel called it shameful and corrupt.
 
Now, next on "CNN Newsroom," authorities reveal the timeline of events leading up to the New Year's Day terror attack in New Orleans, which may have been years in the making. 
 
Plus, former President Jimmy Carter's home state of Georgia pays its final respects before he lies in state at the U.S. Capitol this week. Details just ahead.

FOSTER: U.S. President Joe Biden expected to attend a vigil in New Orleans in the coming hours, days after the terror attack on Bourbon Street, which left 14 people dead. 
 
Our Julia Benbrook has details on the planned visit. But first, CNN's Rafael Romo has more on the events that led up to the attack.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: A crucial question that has surfaced here in New Orleans after the New Year's Day terrorist attack is how long in advance did the attacker know what he was going to do, what he was planning to do? 
 
And we have gotten information from the FBI saying that perhaps it was weeks, if not years, before he knew that he was going to do that. And that's because we now know that he came to New Orleans at least twice in the months preceding the attack, once in October, where he was here for several days. 
 
At one point, he was riding a bicycle and recording video here in the streets around the French border. And then he returned in November. And we have also learned that he traveled internationally. According to the FBI, Jabbar went to Cairo, Egypt in the summer of 2023. And a few days later, he also traveled to Ontario, Canada. 
 
I asked the special agent in charge of the FBI here in New Orleans whether they know at this point if the attacker was financed by a terrorist organization, and this is what he had to say. 
 
LYONEL MYRTHIL, SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE, FBI NEW ORLEANS: At this time, we're still trying to determine the answers to that. That is exactly what our priority is for those international trips. Essentially, we're looking at who has he encountered during those trips, who has he meeting with, where has he traveled while in those specific countries, and whether or not any visits to those countries may or may not have any indication as to the reasons behind this attack in our city. 
 
ROMO: All 14 fatal victims have now been identified. Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry earlier said that the final victim identified was Latasha Polk, a certified nursing assistant and the mother of a 14- year-old. 
 
Rafael Romo, CNN, New Orleans, Louisiana. 
 
JULIA BENBROOK, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Their visit takes place just five days after the terror attack on Bourbon Street killed 14 people and wounded dozens of others.
 
A White House official says that the president and the first lady will grieve with the families and community members impacted by the tragic attack on January 1st and meet with officials on the ground. 
 
A source familiar with the planning tells our team that the president is expected to attend a vigil in New Orleans and deliver remarks there. Local clergy, law enforcement, community members and family members of the victims are likely to attend.
 
Following an event here at the White House on Sunday, Biden took questions from reporters and he was asked what message he would like to share with the families impacted. 
 
JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: There's nothing you can really say to somebody who's had such a tragic loss and my message is going to be personal to them if I get to get them along. About they just have to hang on to each other. 
 
They'll come a day when they think of their loved one and they'll smile before a chair comes to their eye. That's when they know they're going to make it, but it takes time.
 
BENBROOK: The president has pledged federal resources to assist with the investigation. This trip marks one of the final displays of Biden as consoler in chief, a role that he's had to regularly step into during his four years in office. 
 
At the White House, Julia Benbrook, CNN.

FOSTER: Today is the last day for the public to pay their respects in Atlanta to the 39th president of the U.S. 
 
Jimmy Carter's body will remain there at the Carter Center until Tuesday morning when his casket will be flown to Washington. He'll lie in state at the U.S. Capitol until his funeral service which is on Thursday. 
 <br>[03:20:07]
 
Meanwhile, the Carter family's former home church held its first Sunday service since his death. Our Eva McKend reports from Plains, Georgia. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
EVA MCKEND, CNN CORRESPONDENT: At President Carter's hometown church, a Sunday service that contained both elements of sorrow and joy as people that knew the president for decades showed up to worship and also to remember President Carter's life and legacy. 
 
We also saw people travel from neighboring states who in the past saw President Carter teach Sunday school here, which he did for many decades.
 
Now his niece, Kim Carter-Fuller, has taken over Sunday school lessons and she leaned into the book of Psalms where she talked about how their hearts were heavy, but they were leaning on the strength of God in this moment. 
 
And what's also remarkable about Maranatha Baptist Church is that it is now led by a female pastor. We know that President Carter very notably broke with the Southern Baptists on this issue. He believed that women should be equal in all spaces, including religious ones. 
 
Take a listen to how the pastor is thinking about this moment. 
 
ASHLEY GUTHAS, PASTOR, MARANATHA BAPTIST CHURCH: In this country where, to speak bluntly, we still live in a patriarchal nation. We still live in a place where white men are often, their voices are often elevated and listened to and believed more strongly than a woman. 
 
And so, to have a president of the United States who realized within his lifetime the importance of speaking out to the harm that's been done. 
 
But I am just incredibly grateful for the legacy and the work that we have to continue to do because women are still not equal and we have a long way to go. But his voice was one of power that was used for good. 
 
MCKEND: And in her sermon, she talked about how President Carter really lived a life where he hungered for God and was an incredible man of faith. 
 
And at the end of the service, we saw the choir go to the head of the church where they seemed to be preparing, going over the final details for President Carter's final tribute, which will take place here in Plains on Thursday.

FOSTER: Parts of Europe blanketed by heavy snowfall, causing widespread travel disruptions and power outages. We'll have more on the wintry conditions across the continent next.
 
Plus, a new law has just made it more expensive to visit New York City by car. The city officials believe that's a good thing. We'll tell you why.

 <br>[03:25:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: Welcome back. An update now on the heavy snowfall and icing conditions across much of the U.S. 
 
Right now, more than 55 million Americans are under winter storm alerts, with blizzard conditions burying communities in parts of Kentucky, Illinois and Indiana. 
 
As the powerful storm system moves eastwards over the Ohio River Valley and mid-Atlantic regions, some places like Washington D.C. could see more than 16 inches or 40 centimeters of snow.
 
Winter weather also impacting parts of Europe. Much of the U.K. and Germany blanketed in heavy snow, disrupting flights and causing power outages across the region. Slippery ice are also making conditions dangerous for drivers.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
FOSTER (voice-over): It may look pretty from above, but heavy snow covering parts of Europe over the weekend caused widespread disruption to travelers on roads, railways and in the air. 
 
Snow and freezing rain cut power to tens of thousands of homes in northern England. Now the U.K. Met Office warned that sleet and snow could lead to flooding in some areas when the icy mixture thaws. 
 
Airports in Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds and Bristol were forced to close some runways temporarily, and several roads were impacted with conditions slicker than usual at a time when many people were travelling, returning from Christmas break or heading back to university. 
 
Much of the same problem in Ireland, parts of which were also coated in snow. The Irish Weather Service says that bitter cold conditions will continue over the next few days at a time when nearly 60,000 homes, farms and businesses were without power.
 
German officials warned of black ice for drivers and pedestrians, as the snow and ice snarls transportation here too. Frankfurt and Munich airports warned passengers of potential delays or cancellations, and some authorities are advising people to stay at home if possible. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
FOSTER: Well, if you want to drive into Manhattan during peak hours, it will now cost you $9. It's part of a new congestion pricing toll that's meant to reduce traffic in the United States' busiest city. 
 
CNN's Gloria Pazmino tells us all about it. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
GLORIA PAZMINO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, that's right. In fact, congestion pricing has been in the works here in New York City for at least a decade. But it's faced a lot of political opposition and obstacles in recent years.
 
In fact, it still remains deeply unpopular in the New York City suburbs and in New Jersey, which sued to stop the program at the last minute. They were unsuccessful in that lawsuit. So, early on Sunday morning at the stroke of midnight, congestion pricing officially went into effect here in the Big Apple.
 
Now, it is exactly what it sounds like. It is a congestion pricing tolling structure designed to alleviate congestion and traffic here in New York City. 
 
It's also intended to raise public funds for the city's public transit system. And eventually it is supposed to significantly decrease gridlock in what is one of the most congested zones in the entire world. 
 
Now, this is a first of its kind program here in New York City. No other city in the United States has done this before. In fact, many other cities around the world have implemented similar programs, including places like London. 
 
Now how much is it going to cost New Yorkers? 
 
Well, if you drive a passenger vehicle, it's going to cost you at least $9 on weekdays to come into the city from the hours of 5am and 9pm. And on weekends, it's going to cost you $9 between 9am and 9pm. 
 
Now, if you drive in during the off-peak hours, it will be significantly less. And if you drive a commercial vehicle or a truck, it will also vary in price.
 <br>[03:30:00] 
 
Now, more than 700,000 vehicles are estimated to enter the tolling area on a given weekday. So, that is where a lot of this revenue is expected to come from. 
 
Now, officials here in New York City, especially in the suburbs, have been in opposition to this program. And even President-elect Donald Trump has said that he will cancel the program when he takes office on January 20th. 
 
He has called it a regressive tax, saying he believes it will hurt families, workers and businesses here in New York City. But the MTA chairman who is in charge of administering this program responded to that criticism on Sunday. Take a listen. 
 
JANNO LIEBER, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, NYC METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY: We're going to have to work with the new administration on all kinds of ways. I'm confident that agreements between the federal government and
 
 localities stand up to changes of administration. So we'll have to deal with whatever it is. In fact, people don't just routinely pull grant agreements or other agreements between the feds and states and localities. 
 
But I also keep saying it, and I believe it, that Donald Trump is a New Yorker. His office buildings, and he still owns a few, are filled with people who take mass transit and I think he understands, living on Fifth Avenue and 59th Street, what traffic is doing to our city. 
 
So, I'm hopeful that, although there has been some rhetoric about this, that we will work with the federal government and get through the change of administration. 
 
PASMINO: Now, if you don't have E-Z Pass, that's the electronic toll system, it will also cost you slightly more. And if you are taking a cab, whether that's an Uber or Lyft, the cost will be passed down to the passenger. 
 
It'll cost you an extra dollar and 50 cents. If you are taking an Uber or Lyft, and 75 cents if you are taking a yellow cab. The point of all of this is to encourage the use of public transit.

MAX FOSTER, CNN LONDON CORRESPONDENT AND ANCHOR: Still to come, after the end of the Assad regime, some of the horrors of that era are coming to light. Next, CNN goes inside a lab that may have been used to develop chemical weapons.

FOSTER: There may be some progress in the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release talks. Reuters is reporting that a Hamas official says the group has approved an Israeli list of 34 hostages to be exchanged for Palestinian prisoners and detainees.
 
But the Israeli government denies receiving a list of hostages from Hamas. According to the Reuters report, the exchange is contingent on reaching an agreement for Israel's withdrawal from Gaza and a permanent ceasefire. 
 
White House Middle East adviser Brett McGurk is amongst officials at the latest round of indirect talks in Doha. And sources say Israeli Minister Ron Dermer is expected to travel to Washington this week to meet with the Biden administration and Trump transition officials too. 
 
While ceasefire and hostage release negotiations are underway, Israel is ramping up attacks on Gaza. Gaza's civil defense says four Israeli strikes on a residential building in northern Gaza killed 12 members of the same family on Sunday.
 
One member of the family says a child was found alive in the rubble, but 11 other people are still missing. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
WISSAM ZUD, GAZA RESIDENT (through translator): We pulled out flesh and remains and there are still more trapped under the rubble. These are people who have no ties to resistance fighters or anything. We are here on the border of the conflict area, but now it is considered a red zone. 
 
They attack us every day now with missiles and bombs dropped by drones among the people. Everyone is at risk of being bombed at any moment.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: Gaza's health ministry reporting that 88 Palestinians were killed on Sunday, bringing the total death toll to nearly 46,000 since October 2023. 
 
Meanwhile, a health official in Gaza says another Palestinian baby has died from hypothermia. Low temperatures and a lack of access to warm shelters are being blamed for the deaths of at least six babies there in recent weeks.
 
In Syria, some are trying to pick up the pieces of their lives after the fall of the Assad regime. Residents of Jobar, a Damascus suburb in Syria, have finally been allowed to return home. But the town, made off-limits by the Assad regime in 2018, is in ruins. 
 
That includes the local cemetery, where people are now searching for the graves of family members as they try to get some closure. 
 
Syrian officials urged the U.S. to lift sanctions on the country during a visit to Doha on Sunday. According to Reuters, the sanctions had been imposed on ousted President Bashar al-Assad's regime. Since Assad fled, a number of facilities have been discovered that may have been involved in developing and using chemical weapons. 
 
CNN's Jomana Karadsheh goes inside one of those facilities. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): They're gearing up for one of the most dangerous missions in Syria. And they have to be prepared. Exposure could be lethal. 
 
FAROUQ HABIB, DEPUTY GENERAL MANAGER, WHITE HELMETS: While we are searching for these secret prisons, we received information that there could be hazardous materials in this facility.
 
KARADSHEH (voice-over): The White Helmets volunteer rescue group suspects this is a chemical weapons research site. 
 
We joined their HAZMAT team at a former state security building. They wanted us to witness what they find. Throughout the war, the regime and its Russian backers have repeatedly tried to discredit them. 
 
With respirators fixed and suits sealed, the final touch - chemical agent detector patches. 
 
With oxygen tanks and detection devices, these two men lead the way into the unknown. 
 
They have to move carefully and methodically. Looters got here first. Every surface is scanned for traces of chemicals. A suspected weapons delivery system sits in the middle of this room. But no traces detected so far. 
 
Their advanced team already told them. It's the upper floors where they need to be. 
 
Slowly, they move upstairs. Step by step, on every floor and in every room, they're searching for clues. What was the Assad regime doing here? 
 
Evidence of what appears to be a secret chemical lab emerges. In several rooms, they find countless labelled bottles and containers filled with chemicals. 
 
KARADSHEH: Their main mission today is to document, try and find out as much as they can about the chemicals they're finding in this facility.
 <br>[03:40:08]
 
KARADSHEH (voice-over): Something sets off the detector. They take pictures for experts to review the reading. It says TIC - toxic industrial chemical. He checks his patch and carries on. Until another alarm goes off. 
 
They realize it's one of the oxygen tanks. He has to get out fast. It's becoming clear they were experimenting with dangerous substances here.
 
Tucked in the middle of a residential Damascus neighbourhood, the local Druze community had long suspected this was more than just a state security building. 
 
As regime forces withdrew, people rushed in to see what was really inside this feared compound. It was a local pharmacist who sounded the alarm and the white helmets were called in. Securing sites like this one is critical amid a post-regime vacuum and a volatile security situation. 
 
HABIB: These materials could not only pose risk to the civilians in neighboring areas but also if they fall into wrong hands they could be used elsewhere and pose a threat to other communities and maybe other countries. 
 
KARADSHEH (voice-over): CNN shared images with four experts. Based on that snapshot, they all agree this was a chemical lab. It's unclear whether it was used for chemical weapons research or something else including analysis of environmental threats or illicit drugs, among other possibilities. 
 
Strewn about they find what they describe as a trove of documents. One we can't independently verify mentions communications between the facility's command and a Russian military officer. Preserving documents like this is now part of the team's mission. 
 
They also find weapons storage and production rooms. We see all the necessary components to build modified and improvised explosive devices. 
 
HABIB: It was shocking how the previous regime used all these government institutions as multipurpose facilities. 
 
KARADSHEH (voice-over): Down this dark and dingy cockroach-infested basement is perhaps the most dangerous discovery so far.
 
Almost every surface and sealed container sets off the detector. It registers lewisite, a blistering chemical agent. Experts say it could be a false positive. Unlike everything here it will need additional testing. 
 
The fall of the regime may be uncovering what until this day had been hidden in the dark, leaving Syria and the world a dictator's toxic legacy.

FOSTER: In the U.S. the head of Homeland Security is warning of what he calls a heightened threat environment following the New Year's Day terror attack in New Orleans. It comes with several high-profile potential targets this month, including Donald Trump's inauguration on January 20th. 
 
But officials say there are no specific threats surrounding any major events. The concerns come from continued instability in the Middle East, particularly in Syria, as well as a significant increase in homegrown violent extremism in the U.S. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS, U.S. HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY: We have not only the persistent threat of foreign terrorism that of course created the Department of Homeland Security, but we have adverse nation states. 
 
We're very concerned about the instability that has resulted from that and whether in fact it creates some space for the reemergence of ISIS in Syria. And ISIS continues to seek to radicalize individuals outside of the Middle East and throughout the world, and that is something that we are of course also very focused on.

FOSTER: Ukrainian forces refusing to give up on Russia's Kursk region after months of holding their ground. Ukrainian officials say they are launching surprise counter attacks against Russian fighters who are trying to reclaim the territory. 
 
Russia's defense ministry says it's repelling those attacks. But Ukrainian military officials say, quote, "Russia's getting what it deserves." Meanwhile, Russia's military says it's making advances in Ukraine's Donetsk region. A Russian military blog claims the fighters have raised a flag near a key Ukrainian transit hub.
 
Coming up, a few surprises for the Golden Globes. We'll find out who won big and who didn't.

FOSTER: A major loss for the nuclear disarmament movement. Peace advocate Shigemi Fukahori died at the age of 93 on Friday. Local news reports he passed away from natural causes in his hometown of Nagasaki. 
 
He was a survivor of the 1945 Nagasaki atomic bombing, and he devoted his life to promoting peace and campaigning against nuclear weapons. Fukahori was only 14 when the U.S. dropped the bomb that killed tens of thousands, including his own family. It took years before he was able to speak of his trauma. 
 
A new documentary about Melania Trump due out later this year. There's no title right now and few details, but the incoming U.S. first lady will serve as an executive producer, meaning she'll have editorial control. 
 
The documentary began filming in December and is slated for a theatrical release as well as streaming on Amazon Prime Video. This follows the release of Melania Trump's autobiography in October, which remains a bestseller on Amazon and hit number one on the "New York Times" bestseller list.
 
Now, it's a wrap for the 82nd Golden Globe Awards, hosted by the first solo female host, comedian Nikki Glaser. Glaser managed to walk a fine line, cracking jokes about his MPIC and politics, as well as roasting several of the stars.

NIKKI GLASER, HOST: Challengers, girl.  Oh, my God, it was so good. I mean, that movie was more sexually charged than Diddy's credit card. I mean, seriously. 
 
Oh, no, no, I know. I'm sorry. I'm upset, too. The after party is not going to be as good this year, but we have to move on. 
 
I know a Stanley Tucci freak off just doesn't have the same ring to it, but. No baby oil this year, just lots of olive oil, OK?

 <br>[03:50:05] FOSTER: Well, the big winner of the night was "Emilia Perez" winning best motion picture, musical or comedy, best supporting actress, best foreign language film and best original song.
 
(VIDEO PLAYING)
 
Well, Demi Moore won for best female actor in a film, musical or comedy for her performance in "The Substance." 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DEMI MOORE, ACTOR: In those moments when we don't think we're smart enough or pretty enough or skinny enough or successful enough or basically just not enough. I had a woman say to me, just know you will never be enough, but you can know the value of your worth if you just put down the measuring stick.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: This was Moore's first major award in her decades long career, which is extraordinary, really. 
 
I'm joined by film critic and entertainment television host Andrew Freund, who's in L.A. where the awards were handed out last night, of course. I mean, I mean, that's extraordinary, isn't it? Demi Moore hasn't won anything big before this.
 
ANDREW FREUND, TELEVISION HOST AND FILM CRITIC: Yes, you know, Max, she spoke about that. She's had a 45-year career. This is her first major award ever.
 
And she gave that impassioned speech because she's really never had a chance to do it before. 
 
And I don't know if you've seen "The Substance," but it is the wildest film to come out last year. And she wholeheartedly deserves this award, Max, for sure.
 
FOSTER: Yes, absolutely. And, you know, it was interesting to see a female host taking this on as well, just because it hasn't happened before as well. So, this is another first for this award ceremony. 
 
Of course, you know, she's an absolutely brilliant presenter. But do you think it had an impact there? I mean, what resonance did it have? 
 
FREUND: Yes, you know, Nikki Glaser was the first solo female host of the show. They did have Tina Fey and Amy Poehler hosted before together. But Nikki was the first solo host. 
 
And I think she did great. I thought her jokes were hilarious. She towed that fine line. She went there. She roasted people in the room.
 
You know, she became really popular after that Tom Brady roast. 
 
And she handed it to a lot of people in that room, Max. And I was laughing a lot. I thought she did great. FOSTER: In terms of the rest of the awards, I mean, "Emilia Perez,"
 
 would you say she was the big winner? How would you define the big winner on this one? 
 
FREUND: Yes, you know, I would say "Emilia Perez" was definitely the big film winner with four awards. I would also say that, you know, "The Brutalist" won the Drama Award.
 
And on the T.V. side, "Shogun" won four awards. "Shogun" also hugely popular show. People are obsessed with that.
 
So, there were definitely, you know, some huge, huge winners. But, you know, there were also some snubs too. 
 
FOSTER: Yes, take us through them.
 
FREUND: So, you know, the biggest snub, I think, is "Wicked." You know, you can't move anywhere around the world without seeing something about "Wicked." 
 
And it only won one award in the ceremony, the Cinematic Achievement Award. 
 
So to me, that was kind of the biggest snub. Another snub was the film "Anora." "Anora" is getting a lot of buzz around a lot of circles. And it got zero awards. Nothing. Nada.
 
FOSTER: Yes, in terms -- This is often the issue, isn't it, with all these award ceremonies, that, you know, there's a committee that decides who wins. 
 
And it's often seen to be out of touch because you'll have a blockbuster, which is by definition a successful film and a good film, whether or not the critics like it. How much of a debate is that in Hollywood at the moment? 
 
FREUND: You know, I think it is a little bit of a debate. I will say that Golden Globes is made up of 334 entertainment journalists from 85 countries around the world. 
 
So, it's a very international voting membership, which is why I'm not shocked that "Emilia Perez" did so well, because it's a very international film. French director, French songwriters, set in Mexico.
 
So, it just, you know, when we come to the Oscars, the nominations are coming out on the 17th. It's a whole different ball game, a whole different voting membership. So, you know, time will, I guess, tell.
 
FOSTER: Do the Globes play into the Oscars? I mean, you hear two arguments, don't you? The Oscars want to be seen as independent, so they want to do something different from the Globes, but at the same time, they can see how people responded to the Globe winners. 
 
FREUND: Yes, you know, I think they -- maybe a little bit, but not too much. You know, next week, we also have the Critics' Choice Awards, which I'm a member of.
 
So, you know, we have all these different award shows. You know, the Oscars, of course, is the granddaddy of them all. Do they play into each other a little bit, but not, you know, not totally? 
 <br>[03:55:03]
 
FOSTER: No. Okay, well, thank you so much. We're waiting for the big one. There's some more before that, as you pointed out, but thank you so much for joining us, Andrew, today.
 
The NFL's New England Patriots have fired head coach Jerod Mayo after just one season, would you believe? 
 
The Patriots scored a win over the Buffalo Bills on Sunday, but finished with a dismal 4-13 record overall this season. Mayo took over from legendary Patriots coach Bill Belichick. And Mayo is a former player for the Patriots and became an assistant on the team's defensive staff back in 2019.
 
In northeastern China, the city of Harbin is hosting an annual spectacle of ice and snow. We like to bring it to you every year. With average temperatures well below freezing, the festival, which runs from December to February, draws visitors from around the world. 
 
In addition to the brightly lit ice and snow sculptures, there are nightly firework displays and other events, including a snow carnival and dog sledding, too. 
 
According to the organizers, this year's event is the largest in history and incorporates elements from the ninth Asian Winter Games, which will be held in Harbin next month. 
 
And to Spain now, look at that, skating, where the streets of Madrid came alive for the annual Three Kings parade. 
 
Thousands of spectators gathered to watch the kings make their way along the parade route. Amid the costumes and lights were giant colorful frogs, a highlight of the event.
 
The celebration marks the end of Christmas on the eve of Epiphany, the day when the three kings, not tree kings, are said to have visited the baby Jesus with gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh. 
 
Thank you for your company. I'm going to stick around. I'm back for another hour of Newsroom after the break when Christina will join me.
