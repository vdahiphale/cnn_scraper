THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
<br>[11:00:00]
 
BECKY ANDERSON, CNN HOST, CONNECT THE WORLD: Welcome back, I'm Becky Anderson. You're watching "Connect the World". Wherever you are watching as 
 
 ever, you are more than welcome. We begin with growing concern I'm afraid around the world is China's sudden decision to dismantle its harsh COVID 
 
 restrictions despite a surge of infections.
 
Italy, the latest country to announce new testing requirements on visitors from China and the United States is considering doing the same. Well, the 
 
 U.S. officials say there is a lack of I quote here transparent data in China, raising fears that new variants could emerge unchecked.
 
But China is undeterred in rolling back its regulations today announced an easing of restrictions on airlines. And Hong Kong now following the 
 
 mainland and scrapping mandatory PCR tests for international arrivals. Selina Wang is in Beijing with more.
 
SELINA WANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT: China is finally dropping quarantine and loosening its borders. Many people here are rejoicing after years of not 
 
 being able to leave this country. According to Chinese travel booking website trip.com searches for popular destinations jumped 10 times within 
 
 half an hour of the announcement. This news also means that many Chinese nationals living abroad can finally go home. It is a bittersweet victory 
 
 after so much sacrifice.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
WANG (voice over): The world's harshest Quarantine is no more as COVID sweeps through China; the country is scrapping quarantines for inbound 
 
 travelers from January 8, and promising to gradually restore outbound tourism. Since the start of the pandemic China has severely limited who can 
 
 go in and out of the country, drastically cutting the number of flights and forcing all incoming arrivals into government facilities.
 
I went through multiple quarantines and China this year lasting as long as 21 days. There is no choice in where you go or what room you get. Once the 
 
 door is closed, you can only open them for COVID tests and food pickups. Workers spray disinfected in the hallways every few hours. Food delivery is 
 
 not allowed for breakfast, lunch and dinner are part of quarantine fees. All of that is now soon going away. It's a huge relief for Chinese 
 
 nationals living overseas like this woman in New York City.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I really want to go back to my home immediately. And right now I'm very emotional. I'm almost in tears right now.
 
WANG (on camera): When's the last time you went home to China?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Four years before. I lost several of my family members during the pandemic; I lost my beloved golden retriever. I feel like I 
 
 missed everything.
 
WANG (on camera): How is your family doing now in China?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right now almost everyone got COVID and they are suffering. When my grandpa video called me, I cried so badly. At that 
 
 moment, I even don't know if I will get a chance to see him, just he got COVID and I hope he will be OK.
 
WANG (voice over): On Chinese social media people have been sharing everything they've lost during three years of border controls, while they 
 
 were stuck out of their home country. One writes, I received the bad news of my father's unexpected death while I was in a quarantine hotel. But I 
 
 couldn't go back to see him for the last time. Another writes because of the pandemic, I didn't even know that my grandma passed away and I heard it 
 
 from my mother a month later.
 
This new change finally ends China's ban on non-essential travel for Chinese citizens. I feel like the pandemic is finally over the travel plans 
 
 I made three years ago may finally become a reality, she says. It's exciting news for potential travelers but at home, the country is 
 
 struggling to grapple with an explosion in COVID cases.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The hospital is just overwhelmed from top to bottom. There was no preparation like nobody knew; you know there was no stockpile 
 
 of medications.
 
WANG (voice over): This viral video with the southern city of Guangzhou shows a man kneeling on the ground at a fever clinic breaking down and 
 
 begging the nurse to let him see the doctor after waiting for hours. Fever and cold medicine are nearly impossible to get drug stores across the 
 
 country.
 
Anti-virals are also extremely hard to get but in a major move Beijing has announced it's going to start distributing Paxlovid to community health 
 
 centers in the coming days, so there's chaos and confusion, but with zero COVID in the past finally there's light at the end of the tunnel.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
WANG: But now as China is finally loosening its borders some countries like Japan and India are increasing restrictions for travelers from China. 
 
 They're worried about the spike in cases here. Japan's Prime Minister said travelers from China will be tested for COVID on arrival.
 <br>[11:05:00]
 
WANG: Those who test positive will have to quarantine for seven days. Japan has also restricted plans to increase flights to and from China. India has 
 
 put in place similar COVID testing guidelines. Selina Wang, CNN, Beijing.
 
ANDERSON: And you can read more about China's handling of the COVID crisis on our website that is cnn.com. Of course on your CNN App we explain how 
 
 the government went from overzealous enforcement of regulations that damaged the economy to an abrupt abandonment of its zero COVID policy that 
 
 is left a fragile healthcare system struggling to cope, that story@cnn.com.
 
Well, the recently liberated Ukrainian city of Kherson is being pounded again by enemy forces. That is, according to Ukraine's military who say 
 
 that Russia has launched dozens of artillery strikes on civilian targets in the southern city, including on a hospital as these attacks continue the 
 
 effects while they're being felt across Ukraine not least in what is a grim death toll.
 
The United Nations now reporting that nearly 7000 civilians have died since the invasion began. CNN's Will Ripley joined some Ukrainians who gathered 
 
 to pay their respects to a fallen soldier, have a look at this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): So many tears for yet another victim of Russia's war in Ukraine. Mourners in Kyiv 
 
 are paying their final respects to a fallen Ukrainian soldier, a husband, brother and son. He was reportedly killed near Bakhmut. Intense fighting 
 
 has the city almost unrecognizable. Debris litters the streets. Buildings are on fire.
 
OLEKSANDR, BAKHMUT RESIDENT: Our house is destroyed. There's a shop near a building now it's not there anymore.
 
RIPLEY (voice over): In this besieged city across the country, millions are still living without power. Ukraine accuses Russia of persistently 
 
 targeting Ukrainian energy facilities, giving engineers little time to repair the grids before the next strike comes. Ukraine's Energy Minister 
 
 describes the situation across his country as really difficult.
 
Strikes have left Ukraine with a power deficit, unable to meet the basic energy needs of the country. Fears are growing among Ukrainian officials. 
 
 Moscow could be planning large strikes around New Year's Day. In this small village near Kherson people are bracing for a bitterly cold winter, a 
 
 winter without power, collecting firewood and other supplies to protect against plummeting temperatures.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We will get through the winter because we fix the chimney and now we can heat the house. We will get through it. We do not 
 
 have any other option. Where would we go?
 
RIPLEY (voice over): On top of all this a war of words brewing between Moscow and Kyiv. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov is issuing an 
 
 ultimatum. Ukraine must battle Russia's demands; including giving up occupied Ukrainian territories, or else the Russian army will take matters 
 
 into its own hands.
 
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says that won't happen. He's vowing to retake all captured Ukrainian ground. Diplomatic negotiations seem just 
 
 as gridlocked as the battlefield. Little sign of peace coming this holiday season and a conflict that continues to grind on. Will Ripley, CNN, Lviv, 
 
 Ukraine.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON: There are also questions now surrounding the deaths of a Russian tycoon and his friend on the same trip in India. They are the latest in a 
 
 series of unexplained deaths involving Russian tycoon since the start of the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine. CNN's Clare Sebastian joining us live 
 
 from London. Clare?
 
CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Becky this was a man called Pavel Antov, who in 2018 was named by Forbes as the richest civil servant in 
 
 Russia and net worth estimated around $140 million. He was a regional lawmaker, a member of United Russia, which is the party most closely allied 
 
 to Vladimir Putin made his fortune manufacturing sausages and died in India on Saturday in what police say was a fall from his third floor hotel room 
 
 window.
 
They say the result of suicide suspected and it came just two days after his friend and other Russian businessman died. They say have a heart attack 
 
 in the same location. Now interesting thing about this is of course the two deaths coming so close together.
 
The second is that Pavel Antov posted a post on the Russian Facebook equivalent for - back in the summer disavowing a WhatsApp status, which we 
 
 believe was some kind of criticism of the war in Ukraine, saying he's a true patriot, affirming his support for President Putin.
 <br>[11:10:00]
 
SEBASTIAN: So perhaps there was some criticism of the war in his past. We don't know exactly what the circumstances of this are, but it does fit a 
 
 pattern. We can show you not an exhaustive list. But some of the suspicious deaths that we've seen so far this year among Russian businessmen, that 
 
 causes range, there are some false there are some suspected suicides, murdered suicides.
 
These are all people from the business community. We don't know in most cases about whether they were critical of the war in Ukraine, perhaps in 
 
 the case of Ravil Maganov, who was the Chairman of Lukoil back in September. That Lukoil had called for an end to the violence at the 
 
 beginning of the war. But it is still a very high number of suspicious deaths and does raise questions or they're not answers at this point, 
 
 Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Clare Sebastian is in London for you. Clare, thank you. Pope Francis urging people to pray for his predecessor, as the Vatican says the 
 
 health of Pope Emirates has Benedict is worsening. Benedict the 16th resigned nearly 10 years ago is paving the way for Pope Francis's election.
 
Well, now 95 years old, he's been living a quiet life in a former convent inside the Vatican. Pope Francis calls for a prayer asking God's console 
 
 Benedict until the end. Well Delia Gallagher joins us now live from Rome. And you and I were there for the resignation and the election of Pope 
 
 Francis. It does seem an awful long time ago. What else did Pope Francis have to say about Benedict's health at this point?
 
DELIA GALLAGHER, CNN VATICAN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, well, you know, Becky, just go back to that in 2013 when the reason that Pope Benedict resigned 
 
 was for his frail health and so here we are today, talking about his frail health. Again, the Vatican statement from a few hours ago is saying that it 
 
 had deteriorated due to his advanced age. He's 95.
 
They say he is with his doctors who are monitoring the situation. Pope Francis this morning, as you mentioned was the first to give the news 
 
 saying, please pray for him because he is very sick. Let's take a listen to what the Pope had to say.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
POPE FRANCIS, CATHOLIC CHURCH HEAD: I want to ask you all for a special prayer for Pope Emeritus Benedict, who sustains the church and his silence. 
 
 He is very sick. We asked the Lord to console and sustain him in this witness of love for the church to the very end.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GALLAGHER: The Vatican also said Becky that Pope Francis went to visit the Pope Emeritus after that general audience. And we can say that if they are 
 
 being so public about his illness today, we assume that things are serious indeed. We are standing by for any updates and we'll bring them to you when 
 
 we have them, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Delia Gallagher is in Rome for you folks, thank you very much indeed. You're watching "Connect the World" with me Becky Anderson live 
 
 from our broadcasting hub here in the Middle East in Abu Dhabi. Still ahead, Buffalo New York is digging out after a deadly Blizzard. Well, the 
 
 mayor there is saying about how and why people perished during that storm.
 
And their bags are packed. I got nowhere to go Southwest Airlines cancels thousands more flights, passengers angry and frustrated. And so is the U.S. 
 
 transportation secretary, hear what he had to say and what happens next after this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:15:00]
 
ANDERSON: The impact of what is a massive winter storm that hit the United States over Christmas weekend is still being felt in Buffalo New York. 
 
 Roads there finally being cleared and emergency services restored after up to 131 centimeters of snow fell around the city.
 
At least 34 people died in the area among the 59 storm and cold related deaths across the United States. And now Buffalo is facing a flood threat 
 
 as warmer temperatures move in and all that snow begins to melt. Well officials there just gave the press an update last hour CNN's Athena Jones 
 
 in Buffalo for us. What did we hear?
 
ATHENA JONES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Becky, I just want to show you the amount of snow we're dealing with. Look behind me you can see 
 
 a mountain of snow it is several storey's high. It dwarfs some of the two storey houses that we can see down the street nearby. And we're told that 
 
 trucks have been dumping snow there since the snow clearing began.
 
And that now they're already moving on to a new pile. They're afraid that this one is getting too large. But that just gives you a sense of just the 
 
 job ahead. City officials and county officials - every single street in Buffalo has at least one lane clear by tomorrow morning.
 
And the reason for that is to make sure that emergency services can get to everyone who needs it and that city can begin to return to normal. As you 
 
 mentioned, the death toll has raised now 34 people dead. And authority is saying that least three of those people, two men and one woman are on 
 
 identified, so they're asking families to call the police if they have a loved one who is missing.
 
Another thing the National Guard is out they started at 9.30 this morning going door to door in neighborhoods that lost power, even neighborhoods 
 
 that may still not have power, though most power has been restored. They're going door to door to check on folks to make sure that they're doing OK.
 
We also know that authorities are going door to door to do wellness checks of people who called 911, or other EMS emergency services during the height 
 
 of the storm and couldn't be reached because the roads were impassable. We know that more than 400 of those calls took place, those calls that went 
 
 unanswered. And so that is part of the work that's being done.
 
Authorities are saying that the driving ban remains in effect here in Buffalo, so that they want people off the streets so that they can do, they 
 
 can do this clearing of the roads as much as possible. They're also doing dialysis run. So people who need you know kidney, which have kidney disease 
 
 and kidney illnesses, they're making sure that those people can get treatment, they're going to reevaluate the driving ban overnight.
 
And as you mentioned, one more point to make is that it's already warming up. Its freezing now, which I believe is zero Celsius, and the temperature 
 
 is only expected to go higher. It's going to rise by about 20 degrees over the next couple of days. And so authorities are saying that there could be 
 
 a rapid melting of the snow that's piled up in some places, it's more than 131 centimeters high, so a meter, a little over a meter high.
 
They're worried about that causing flooding. And so that is another reason it's so important for them to clear these roads as much as possible and as 
 
 quickly as possible, Becky?
 
ANDERSON: Yes, totally understandable. It's good to have you. Thank you. Well, through the chaos of winter weather in the United States comes a well 
 
 a happy ending. A woman in Buffalo, New York, in fact, became a hero. After taking a man stranded in a deadly blizzard, that act of kindness, saved his 
 
 life. CNN's Gary Tuchman has a story.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
GARY TUCHMAN, CNN REPORTER (voice over): The worst of Mother Nature, bringing out the best of human nature. This is Buffalo resident Sha'kyra 
 
 Aughtry on Facebook Live.
 
SHA'KYRA AUGHTRY, RESCUED MAN FROM BLIZZARD: I currently have an older 64 year old white man in my house, I found him yesterday I heard him screaming 
 
 for help.
 <br>[11:20:00]
 
TUCHMAN (voice over): In the midst of Western New York's Blitzer Sha'kyra spotted and heard the man in terrible pain in the frigid cold outside her 
 
 house on the morning of Christmas Eve. Her boyfriend carried the man inside, that man is Joey White, seen in this picture, the Toronto Blue Jays 
 
 baseball game.
 
AUGHTRY: He got away from his home that he lives in a group home he told me.
 
TUCHMAN (voice over): Yvonne's sister says her brother was mentally challenged and does indeed live in a group home. He works at a movie 
 
 theater may have gotten scared during the blizzard and tried to walk home from the theater getting lost in the heavy snow outside the mother of 
 
 three's house. Sha'kyra did her best to take care of him to comfort him feed him and pleaded for help with phone calls and on Facebook Live.
 
AUGHTRY: This man is not about to die over here. I want to let - to get this man some help.
 
TUCHMAN (voice over): But her neighborhood was virtually impossible. Christmas Eve became Christmas Day. Joey was in immense pain with severe 
 
 frostbite on his hands.
 
AUGHTRY: Joey. Listen to Joey. How you feel, Joey? Joe ready to go, he ready to go? He needs to go because he needs medical attention. I had to he 
 
 had a ring on his finger. I had to use these to cut the ring off the finger. I'm not no sergeant.
 
TUCHMAN (voice over): With her three children by your side, Sha'kyra tried to comfort Joey.
 
AUGHTRY: Joe, you feeling better? You're trying to feel better?
 
JOEY WHITE, YVONNE WHITE'S BROTHER: I'm going to die.
 
AUGHTRY: No, you're not going to die. We're not talking about death. This how you know he needs help.
 
TUCHMAN (voice over): And that help was about to come. Good Samaritan is showing up their vehicle that can make it through the snow. Joey was on his 
 
 way to the hospital.
 
AUGHTRY: I'm right here Joey.
 
TUCHMAN (voice over): And Sha'kyra rode with him.
 
AUGHTRY: Jessy, I'm right here. You OK?
 
WHITE: I love you.
 
AUGHTRY: I love you too, sweetie. You OK.
 
TUCHMAN (voice over): Joey arrived at the hospital safely.
 
AUGHTRY: This man could have died. 64 years old could have died outside. I won't letting that happen on my watch and he wasn't going to die in front 
 
 of my kids.
 
TUCHMAN (voice over): Joey has severe frostbite and is in the ICU in the hospital Burn Unit. His sister Yvonne is touching goes whether his hands 
 
 can be saved. But overall, he's in stable condition. And she is so grateful for Sha'kyra Aughtry archery.
 
YVONNE WHITE, SISTER OF RESCUED MAN: This woman did something that an angel would do. OK, to take in a perfectly stranger, a stranger you took him in 
 
 your home on Christmas Eve.
 
TUCHMAN (voice over): Joey White's life was saved by a woman who cared deeply about a man she had never met.
 
AUGHTRY: Thank you. I'm right here. I'm right here.
 
TUCHMAN (voice over): Gary Tuchman, CNN Atlanta.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON: Well, that winter storm that paralyze Buffalo has done the same to Southwest Airlines leaving hundreds of thousands of passengers angry, 
 
 frustrated and wondering if they will ever get to complete their holiday travel. Over the span of a week Southwest has canceled 15,700 flights.
 
U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is calling it a complete meltdown of Southwest's flight system and he is vowing to hold the airline 
 
 accountable. Adrian Broadus back with us this hour from Chicago's Midway Airport. It's interesting, isn't it?
 
I know that you've been speaking to people who, who simply didn't believe the airline when they said this was all about weather. I mean, Chicago is 
 
 not unfamiliar with cold weather. I know it's been pretty bad this year. But it's not unfamiliar with bad weather this time of year. And now the 
 
 real story coming out and an apology and as you know we will do better from the airline now for passengers, how are they taking that?
 
ADRIENNE BROADDUS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: You know the apology is hit or miss some people handling all of this with grace. Others call it in their words, 
 
 not true. Meanwhile Becky, we are used to seeing scenes that look like this. Travelers waiting for their luggage to fall off the belt onto the 
 
 conveyor belt so they can go on to their final destination.
 
But we have not seen that here at Chicago midway. Instead this has been the scene, a sea of luggage. And at this our crews are working to remove all of 
 
 these bags. If travelers did not have midway as their final destination they were unable to take their luggage.
 
So these teams have been organizing the bags by city, they will rescan them into the system and then the bags will be off to their original final 
 
 destination. We did meet up with two travelers who waited in line hours to get their luggage, listen in.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LAURA CROOKS, SOUTHWEST AIRLINES PASSENGER: You find your bag. They let me go on and find myself in a lot. This took me on a band, they found them 
 
 girl.
 
BROADDUS: Where was it?
 <br>[11:25:00]
 
CROOKS: They're just out everywhere. They all, --I had to walk. And as - I noticed him and I got all four bags.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BROADDUS: Four bags that was Laura Crooks who says she was initially stranded in Vegas. Meanwhile, Southwest is offering compensation to 
 
 travelers. But some even say that's not enough, they would have preferred transparency and honesty, Becky from the beginning back to you.
 
ANDERSON: Thank you. Well passengers flying in the U.S. have certain rights when their flights are canceled or delayed. We ask the Transportation 
 
 Secretary, what people are entitled to and how the airline should be responding. Have a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
PETE BUTTIGIEG, U.S. TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY: Another thing you should know is that when you're in the situation and the airline is responsible, 
 
 which is clearly the case right now, and then you can get those kinds of vouchers for hotels, restaurants.
 
But what I talked about with the southwest CEO is that a passenger shouldn't have to request that, they need to be proactively offering that. 
 
 He pledged that they would and again we'll be watching to make sure that they follow through.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Stay with CNN for more as we continue to update you on these weather issues and this travel chaos. Coming up Putin and his war on 
 
 Ukraine, Xi Jinping and tensions over Taiwan this year has tested diplomacy perhaps more than any other year in decades. We're going to take a look 
 
 back at some of the biggest challenges.
 
Plus the migrant crisis at the southern U.S. border what's next for thousands of migrants now that the restrictive policy Title 42 will remain 
 
 in effect from now at least.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: I'm Becky Anderson in Abu Dhabi. You're watching "Connect the World". Welcome back. Our top story this hour, a change of plans today for 
 
 Vladimir Putin, the Russian President's last minute trip to the Pskov region in western Russia had to be canceled due to what the Kremlin calls 
 
 flight conditions.
 
Now it's worth noting that that region is close to the border with Latvia and Estonia. Both were once dominated by the former Soviet Union. Well, in 
 
 Ukraine Moscow appears to be intensifying its attacks on Kherson including shelling a hospital after Russian troops were fought out of that southern 
 
 city just last month.
 <br>[11:30:00]
 
ANDERSON: Well, Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine is among the top diplomatic challenges facing the world as we head into the New Year. 
 
 Tensions with China, Taiwan, NATO, and the climate crisis are some of the other issues on the list. CNN's International Diplomatic Editor Nic 
 
 Robertson takes a look back and has a preview of what we should expect in the days and months ahead.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)
 
NIC ROBERTSON CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice over): This year's war in Ukraine, the biggest land war in Europe since 1945, is both a 
 
 symptom of diplomacy's limits and a harbinger of potential decay to come. Russian President Vladimir Putin's unprovoked aggression is yet to be tamed 
 
 by sanction or reason, despite diplomatic outreach.
 
OLAF SCHOLZ, GERMAN CHANCELLOR: I believe its right to have constant discussions. There must be a moment where Russia realizes that it needs to 
 
 get out of this situation.
 
ROBERTSON (voice over): China's Xi Jinping who's increasingly bellicose diplomacy defying claims to Taiwan is watching Ukraine. Learning possible 
 
 international limits on his own potential land grab Scholz, who is picking up his predecessor, Angela Merkel's peacemaking mantle, use his recent 
 
 visit to Beijing to try to shut down Russia's war and head off one over Taiwan.
 
SCHOLZ: It is important for China to use its influence on Russia it is about principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity.
 
ROBERTSON (voice over): 2022 has tested diplomacy more than any other year in decades. On the upside, democracies have risen to the challenge, 
 
 diplomatic unity in the face of Russian aggression.
 
EMMANUEL MACRON, FRENCH PRESIDENT: As war returns to European soil we need to become brothers in arms once more.
 
ROBERTSON (voice over): On the downside, it shown diplomatic words alone won't work; they need to be backed by military muscle.
 
JENS STOLTENBERG, NATO SECRETARY GENERAL: What happens at the negotiating table depends on what happens on the battlefield? Therefore, the best way 
 
 to increase the chances for a peaceful solution is to support Ukraine. We will not back down.
 
ROBERTSON (voice over): The past year is setting the stage for diplomatic storms to come.
 
VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT: We will defend ourselves with all available means at our disposal.
 
ROBERTSON (voice over): Putin continues to tease the threat of a nuclear strike, potentially taking diplomacy and 2023 to its limits.
 
FERNANDO ARIAS, ORGANISATION FOR PROHIBITION OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS: It does exacerbate that existing tensions to a point where unity of the 
 
 international community cannot be presumed.
 
ROBERTSON (voice over): Add to this the increasing tensions with China and 2023 is shaping up to be an even greater challenge than 2022.
 
RISHI SUNAK, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: We recognize China poses a systemic challenge to our values and interests, a challenge that grows more acute as 
 
 it moves towards even greater authoritarianism.
 
ROBERTSON (voice over): Paradoxically, another growing challenge, climate change, perhaps offers a way out of the downward diplomatic spiral and need 
 
 to combat global warming together.
 
JOHN KERRY, U.S. CLIMATE ENVOY: Without China, even if the U.S. is as we are moving towards a 1.5 degree program, which we are, if we don't have 
 
 China, nobody else can make to that goal.
 
ROBERTSON (voice over): As with previous years, 2023 will offer opportunity to develop diplomatic off ramps, perhaps none more poignant than the G7 to 
 
 be hosted by Japan in Hiroshima. There'll be another climate summit too.
 
But as this year's COP 27 in Egypt showed during global economic hardship, domestic politics, Trump collective salvation the G20 in India could be a 
 
 place where compromises are made. The war in Ukraine would be in its 19th month, and by then battlefield realities hard to ignore despite Putin's new 
 
 threats of a long war.
 
ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATES: This will end and it will end almost certainly with diplomacy within negotiation. But what I think we 
 
 have to see is a just and durable piece. Not a phony piece.
 <br>[11:35:00]
 
ROBERTSON (voice over): The big diplomatic question for 2023, how to get Putin to agree? The answer may lie in the soaring food and energy costs 
 
 triggered by the war. If the global situation worsens, collective pressure for some kind of peace will increase the test of 2023 what to do if Putin 
 
 ignores the warnings? Nic Robertson, CNN, London.

ANDERSON: Up to speed on some of the other stories that are on our radar right now. And an Iranian woman has participated in an international chess 
 
 tournament without a hijab. Sarah Kadim (ph) played at a tournament in Kazakhstan the hijab mandatory under Iran's dress code, of course, several 
 
 other Iranian women have also removed their hijab at recent international events in presumed shows of support for anti-government protests back at 
 
 home in Iran.
 
You're looking at pictures of the latest SpaceX launch in Cape Canaveral in Florida. Today's Falcon Nine Rocket launched at 54 Starlink Satellites into 
 
 Earth's lower orbit. Now these satellites will expand the company's ability to provide internet to places where ground based internet isn't available.
 
And Tennis Star Novak Djokovic is back in Australia almost a year after he was deported for not being vaccinated against COVID-19. The Serbian world 
 
 number five is getting ready for a tournament next week in Adelaide as well as next month's big one the Australian Open. Djokovic was allowed back into 
 
 the country after the government recently overturned the decision to cancel his visa. Australia's strict COVID policies have since been lifted.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CRAIG TILEY, TENNIS AUSTRALIA CEO: Well, Novak nine time champion we're welcome him back to Australia. I have a great deal of confidence in the 
 
 Australian public. I think we have - we're very well educated sporting public, particularly those that comes to tennis.
 
They love their tennis. They love seeing greatness. They love seeing great athleticism, great matches. And I have a lot of confidence that the fans 
 
 will react like we hope they would react and have respect for that.

ANDERSON: Well, Djokovic himself is seeking his 10th Australian Open Title more than anyone else in history. He is also hoping to tie Rafael Nadal's 
 
 record 22 Grand Slam wins.
 
Well, migrants looking to call America home will have to wait after the U.S. Supreme Court kept the restrictive policy Title 42 in place at least 
 
 for now. The Trump era policy put in effect during the early days of the pandemic allows border agents to expel migrants to their home countries in 
 
 the name of COVID prevention.
 
Well, the U.S. Supreme Court will allow Title 42 to remain while legal challenges play out. In El Paso, Texas officials have been preparing for a 
 
 surge of migrants. CNN's Leyla Santiago joins us from El Paso, where thousands are Leyla, quite frankly, waiting in limbo.
 
Let's talk about those who you've been speaking to today. We can talk about what the City of El Paso has been doing, to try and cope. But this is a 
 
 story about people oftentimes who have traveled thousands and thousands of miles, what are they telling you?
 
LEYLA SANTIAGO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, you know one family I spoke to said we'd been through nine different countries over three different months to 
 
 get to this moment. And now, uncertainty, you know, there's a lack of trust, a lot of fear of what may come in the future.
 
So let me kind of show you where I am. This is a church that also serves as a shelter with plenty of beds at night for many of the migrants. But 
 
 migrants are continuing to come by the hour. I mean, I spoke to one family who said they just got in last night not in time to get into the shelter.
 
So they along with two year old twins slept on the sidewalk last night and with blankets provided by the Red Cross. You know, when you speak to them, 
 
 you can clearly feel the anxiety and really you know, they're seeking understanding they have a hard time understanding what exactly this will 
 
 mean for them?
 
And what they will be able to do with their children over the next few days, weeks or months, many fearing that they could be sent back to Mexico 
 
 where they've been sharing some stories that I can only describe as nightmares and their experiences with some of the cartels there on the 
 
 border.
 
So there's a lot of uncertainty, a lot of nuance that they are trying to work through and figure out the details of what this will mean for them in 
 
 terms of impact. And that's not far off as you mentioned, Becky, from what the city of El Paso is right now doing trying to read into that fine print 
 
 and figure out exactly how they will move forward.
 <br>[11:40:00]
 
SANTIAGO: Now I can tell you they had a contingency plan before this announcement came through this decision from the Supreme Court. And they 
 
 are moving forward with that plan despite the decision that was made and announced yesterday because they still expect to see more migrants coming 
 
 in.
 
Because on the other side of the border, as CNN has reported, there are tens of thousands of migrants waiting in Matamoros and Reynosa and - just 
 
 on the other side of El Paso waiting to try to get in.
 
Another thing that many of the migrants will tell you are that they wanted to come in legally. They wanted to turn themselves in and be processed 
 
 legally through the system. But that Title 42 just does not allow that. And for that reason, many of them say they're coming in wherever they can on 
 
 the border.
 
So we continue to see the sidewalks lined with many of the migrants. There is some law enforcement presence here are actually kind of bring you around 
 
 to show you. We this - police car just arrived here and you can see some of the migrants kind of moving around wondering what will happen next?
 
I've got to say I've not seen that yet before. But this adds, again, to the uncertainty, the anxiety. I mean, the city will tell you that NGO shelters 
 
 will take and have enough capacity for a lot of the migrants including migrants like this, but they fear getting onto any sort of bus or 
 
 transportation because of the uncertainty not knowing where they will end up not knowing where they will go, Becky?
 
ANDERSON: Leyla Santiago, thank you. Fascinating, and one can only hope that this sort of limbo these men, women and kids, and you can see a lot of 
 
 kids there are in we'll close out sometime soon. We'll stay on the story. Thank you.
 
Up next, Cuba has opened up a new kind of tourist industry underwater. CNN's Patrick Oppmann and his crew goes swimming with sharks. We'll ask 
 
 TikTok about the sweat from some U.S. government devices why? Well, we are live in Washington with more on that up next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: Will start that again. Welcome back firstly! The U.S. House will no longer allow the video app TikTok on any congressional electronic 
 
 devices. Users are being asked to remove the software. The memo sent to the house staff calls the Chinese owned app "A high risk to users due to a 
 
 number of security risks". Let's get you to CNN's Technology Reporter Brian Fung in Washington what do you make of this Brian?
 <br>[11:45:00]
 
BRIAN FUNG, CNN'S TECHNOLOGY REPORTER: Well Becky, this is just the latest blow to TikTok. In what we've seen as a number of blows to the company, you 
 
 know, as it's tried to negotiate its way into staying operational in the United States.
 
As you saw this internal notice went to House staff and said it was effective immediately, and anyone who has TikTok on their devices will be 
 
 asked to remove it. The House is not the only government organization to do this already the Department of Homeland Security, the military and the 
 
 White House has all restricted this app from their services, citing security concerns.
 
But it also comes as Congress is set to ban TikTok more widely across all U.S. government devices. And that's expected to go in effect within days, 
 
 just as soon as President Joe Biden signs the $1.7 trillion omnibus spending package that was passed by Congress last week.
 
Now what's driving all this? It's the bipartisan security concerns that people have leveled against TikTok. Concerns that the Chinese government 
 
 could try to pressure TikTok or its parent company ByteDance into handing over the U.S. user data to the Chinese government.
 
Which policymakers say could be, you know, a potential security risk because it could allow China to engage in intelligence operations or spread 
 
 disinformation on TikTok using its algorithm.
 
Of course TikTok says these efforts to ban the app from government devices are just political and it doesn't help address the underlying national 
 
 security concerns. TikTok has been negotiating with the U.S. government on a potential deal that would allow it to stay operational in the United 
 
 States. But of course, we've not seen any significant progress on that front Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Quarter to 12 nearly midday in Washington, Brian, thank you. Well, from conservation to tourism. Cuba's bull sharks not only beautiful 
 
 and essential to the environment, they're also attracting visitors to the country. CNN's Patrick Oppmann heads the Coast of Cuba for a new 
 
 perspective on what are these underwater predators?
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Usually they are the last thing you want to see in the ocean. But sharks are the reason why we have 
 
 come here to the waters off eastern Cuba. We're hoping to see the predators up close and with no cage.
 
Local guides say this is the only place in Cuba perhaps one of only a handful in the world where divers can safely swim alongside bull sharks. We 
 
 are taking them at their word, praying the sharks had a big breakfast.
 
Bull sharks are considered some of the most aggressive in the world. But the ones we see mostly curious, swimming around me for a closer look before 
 
 gliding away. Guide - says they want to teach visitors to respect sharks and to protect them. The shark is the perfect machine the perfect predator 
 
 he says.
 
It's inspiring, emotional and satisfying to interact with them. Marine biologists say robust shark populations are necessary to maintain healthy 
 
 coral reefs. In 2015, Cuba placed restrictions on shark fishing. What have an increasing number of countries in the Caribbean to realize that sharks 
 
 are not only important to the environment, but a way to track visitors?
 
OPPMANN (on camera): People in the Caribbean used to commonly catch and kill sharks, either for food or because they were considered a nuisance. 
 
 But warmer countries in this region are now taking steps to protect sharks. It's not just about conservation. Shark tourism visitors specifically 
 
 coming to a country to dive with sharks can generate millions of dollars in revenue.
 
OPPMANN (voice over): Just before her first dive with sharks, Canadian Tourist Carrie (ph) tells us she's been terrified of them ever since seeing 
 
 jaws.
 
CARRIE PREVOST, DRIVING WITH SHARKS: I watched the movie very young. And I was even afraid to swimming pools let alone the ocean. So this is a 
 
 challenge to overcome.
 
OPPMANN (voice over): Guide spear fish to attract the sharks but are careful to use the minimum bait necessary. They say they've never had an 
 
 attack involving a client or guide. And that people come to dive here gain a new perspective on sharks.
 
It's the myth of the shark being dangerous a man eater that is aggressive he says. Then you manage to see a shark a meter and a half away from you 
 
 and when you come out of the water, they say this is the best dive of my life.
 
The sharks we swim with are undeniably powerful, and also incredibly beautiful. At the top of the food chain, but never seeming to threaten us. 
 
 And they said the shot of adrenaline in your arm they were not kidding nobody admit to being afraid but they're very impressive creatures that 
 
 there are now more and more reasons to try and protect Patrick Oppmann, Cuba.

TOM BRENNAN, MASTER ARTISAN, WATERFORD CRYSTAL: Each and every year a brand new theme or brand new cut pattern. And this is actually one of the 
 
 triangles here from this ball behind me so I can drop this because it's got to go up right here.
 
And you can see this intertwining beautiful love hearts on this cut on both sides, designed by Irish craftsmen and this is what's really special about
