ANNOUNCER: Live from CNN Abu Dhabi. This is CONNECT THE WORLD.
 
ELENI GIOKOS, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome to our second hour of CONNECT THE WORLD. I'm Eleni Giokos in Abu Dhabi.
 
Now, some potentially positive news from this region this hour. Source tells CNN, Israel's prime minister has approved the emerging cease fire 
 
 deal with Hezbollah in principle. This, following a deadly exchange, a fire between Hezbollah and Israel over the weekend.
 
And another potential punch to press freedom in Israel, where its cabinets unanimously voted to sanction the nation's oldest newspaper, Haaretz, 
 
 citing its critical coverage of the war following the October 7th Hamas attacks.
 
And the infamous Menendez brothers set to make their first public court appearance in nearly 30 years. They are bidding to get out of prison 
 
 decades after killing their parents.
 
All right. We are following a major story out of Israel this hour, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has approved, in principle, the outlines of a 
 
 ceasefire deal that's being discussed with Hezbollah. That's what a source close to the story is telling us.
 
Now, we've also got multiple sources saying an agreement will not be final until all issues are resolved. All this coming as we're seeing an uptick in 
 
 air strikes. The Israeli military said on Sunday, it struck 12 Hezbollah command centers in Beirut's southern suburbs, and this video showing 
 
 Israel's air defenses intercepting Hezbollah projectiles, fired from Lebanon.
 
We're back in Jerusalem this hour. We've got CNN's Nic Robertson, tracking developments and joins us now live.
 
The latest that we have from our source is that Netanyahu has agreed to the ceasefire in principle. What else are you learning?
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Yes, in the last few minutes, Eleni, we have learned that there will be a Cabinet meeting 
 
 tomorrow. This has been confirmed. A Cabinet meeting will be held tomorrow where they will take a vote on that cease fire.
 
Now, we heard from the foreign minister earlier on today, speaking about this. He said the prerequisites for this deal are that Hezbollah goes back 
 
 north of the Litani River. This is what's been under discussion as we know. That's 30 miles north of the Lebanon-Israel border.
 
He also says that -- and this seems to be -- yes, perhaps one of those areas where there is proving to be sticking points. But he said that it 
 
 must be a deal where Hezbollah cannot be allowed to regrow in Lebanon, and in essence, that other political sort of influences in Lebanon can take 
 
 hold as well.
 
That's a -- that's a pretty big thing to be asking for in a sovereign country. But that's what the foreign minister is saying. As we know, one of 
 
 the big issues for Israel is that right to strike back and strike back immediately if Hezbollah breaks a cease fire. This is expected to be a 60-
 
 day cease-fire.
 
We have also heard from one of the most hardline right-wing members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Cabinet, who will be there with a vote.
 
Itamar Ben-Gvir, the national security minister. He is saying that he has told the prime minister no to a deal with Hezbollah. He says that we're 
 
 close to essentially being able to completely crush Hezbollah.
 
I think there are a lot of analysts in the region and Hezbollah themselves who would take issue and don't believe that, they have certainly taken a 
 
 pounding.
 
But Itamar Ben-Gvir saying that we have a moment of opportunity here to completely crush Hezbollah, and that's why he is telling the prime minister 
 
 not to -- not to support the deal.
 
Now, there is a lot of time, 24 hours between now and when the Cabinet, including the foreign minister, including Itamar Ben-Gvir, will sit down 
 
 with the prime minister and take the vote.
 
But the view from the region at the moment is that this deal is getting close, and there appears to be a degree of momentum towards that. Some of 
 
 that momentum might look negative. The number of strikes coming into Israel today from Hezbollah is high. Again, the number of strikes by Israel at 
 
 Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, again, is high today.
 
But this is -- this is what we saw back in 2006 when the war back then was coming to a conclusion, cease fire was being negotiated down to the wire, 
 
 and there was a significant uptick and -- on strikes both sides. We seem to be in that moment right now, Eleni.
 
GIOKOS: It definitely feels like things are moving very quickly.
 
Nic, you've also been speaking to Palestinians in the West Bank and also getting a bit of insight on what a Trump presidency would mean for their 
 
 new reality.
 
ROBERTSON: Yes. There is a growing sort of consensus here in both in the Palestinian community. And in the Israeli community that Trump will be 
 
 better for Israelis than for Palestinians.
 <br>[10:05:06]
 
And there is one group that really feel that here on -- in Israel, and that's the settlers. The hard-right ministers within Prime Minister 
 
 Benjamin Netanyahu's government, and the settlers want a complete annexation of the occupied West Bank. And Mike Huckabee, in the past, has 
 
 indicated that he supports that.
 
So, there is real concern among Palestinians that Huckabee, in coming, can change the current dynamic and accelerate annexations that are already 
 
 going on.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MIKE HUCKABEE, NOMINEE, UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO ISRAEL: There is no such thing as a West Bank. It's Judea and Samaria.
 
ROBERTSON (voice over): Mike Huckabee, and at times, controversial visitor to Israel, looks set to return as President-Elect Donald Trump's pick to be 
 
 ambassador. If he does, he'll have plenty of friends.
 
Yishai Fleisher, an activist and settler, has met with Huckabee many times.
 
YISHAI FLEISHER, SETTLER LEADER: He happens to be a great friend of Israel, and of the kind of Israel that I represent, that lives in its ancestral 
 
 heartland, which is Judea and Samaria, what on CNN may be called the West Bank.
 
ROBERTSON: Even occupied West Bank.
 
FLEISHER: Right. Even occupied West Bank. But we can't -- we don't see it that way.
 
ROBERTSON (voice over): But the history of the West Bank is complex and deeply disputed. Under international law, Israel is deemed to be occupying 
 
 the land.
 
Huckabee will be arriving when settler violence against Palestinians is significantly up over Trump's last administration. And the Israeli 
 
 government's claim to the land is at its most politically charged in years.
 
Powerful right-wing nationalists in the government want to annex the entire occupied West Bank. So too does Fleisher.
 
FLEISHER: We are still fighting a war of liberation for that piece of land.
 
ROBERTSON: And is Huckabee going to be helpful in that liberation?
 
FLEISHER: I think he will be.
 
ROBERTSON (voice over): 50 miles north on the fringes of the West Bank Palestinian village, Bardala, Israeli diggers are gouging out a new barrier 
 
 through the middle of Palestinian farms, on land they say is a security risk.
 
The Israeli government is in the process of taking more land. The head of the council tells me, claiming no security threats here.
 
What the media is talking about with Huckabee is already happening, he says. These actions are part of Israel's systematic policies to occupy and 
 
 annex all of this land. Their goal is to drive us out of this area.
 
He shows me documents, he says, prove Palestinian families have owned this land for more than a century.
 
As we talk, Israeli troops show up to serve an eviction notice on the farmer below. He's been told his buildings are unlicensed.
 
ROBERTSON: What he is saying is this document, is the official document informing him that he has to be off this land by 9:00 am on the fourth of 
 
 December. Otherwise, all of this, he loses it.
 
ROBERTSON (voice over): Khaled is 60 years old, heart-broken.
 
I don't know how to describe my feelings to you, he says. This is my livelihood. My children rely on it. Then, someone comes along and takes it 
 
 away? You can't argue with them. We have no power. They have the power.
 
ROBERTSON: In the villages around here, they call this silent annexation. Little by little, the Palestinians losing their land to Israeli settlement 
 
 expansion.
 
ALON PINKAS, FORMER ISRAELI DIPLOMAT: If Israel unilaterally annexes large parts, large swath of the West Bank, this is not going to fly well in the 
 
 Arab world.
 
ROBERTSON (voice over): Pinkas is a former Israeli diplomat, believes Huckabee settler friends could harm Trump's bigger objectives, Saudi Israel 
 
 normalization.
 
PINKAS: He is going to be pressured by the Saudis, the Qataris and the Emiratis to strike a bigger deal. He's going to want to build on the 
 
 Abraham Accords.
 
DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Saudi Arabia, very soon.
 
ROBERTSON (voice over): The price of which, Trump's biggest regional friend, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman says is a Palestinian state.
 
MOHAMMED SHTAYYEH, FORMER PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY PRIME MINISTER: Maybe, there is an opportunity with Saudi Arabia for us. And that is why we are 
 
 closely coordinating with Saudi Arabia.
 
ROBERTSON (voice over): The Palestinian Authority's former prime minister believes it's Trump's friends who will triumph in influencing the Israeli 
 
 government, not Huckabee's.
 
SHTAYYEH: This man is not the one who will be declaring the shots. He's a player, he is an important player. But he is not the player, he is not the 
 
 president.
 <br>[10:10:00]
 
ROBERTSON (voice over): By the time Huckabee arrives, more land like farmer Khaleds, will have been seized. What will the future hold, he says, it's a 
 
 question everyone here is asking.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ROBERTSON (on camera): And I think when people try to sort of look at what's going to be the difference in attitude of this Israeli government to 
 
 the Biden administration -- to the Trump administration versus the Biden administration, the Biden administration had pressured this government of 
 
 Prime Minister Netanyahu, to put some controls on some of the sort of wilder settler youths (PH).
 
Well, those controls have just been lifted off by Netanyahu's government this past week, obviously, now knowing a Trump administration is coming.
 
GIOKOS: Nic Robertson, great to have you with us. Thank you so much. Authorities in the UAE say they have arrested three Uzbek nationals in 
 
 connection with the death of an Israeli rabbi in the United Arab Emirates.
 
The White House is condemning the killing of Rabbi Zvi Kogan, and says it is working closely with Israeli and UAE authorities. On Sunday, Israel's 
 
 prime minister called the killing an anti-Semitic act of terror.
 
Egyptian authorities say 17 people are missing after a tourist boat sank in the Red Sea. Officials told the Associated Press, 28 people have been 
 
 rescued, some of them being airlifted to hospital.
 
According to the regional governor, 45 people were on board the boat named the Sea Story, which was on a five-day trip when it went down near the town 
 
 of Marsa Alam. The Egyptian Weather Service had warned on Saturday about rough sea conditions.
 
Russia says it will use every means at its disposal to protect itself. Those comments from his senior diplomat come after Moscow fired a new non-
 
 nuclear ballistic missile on Ukraine's Dnipro region last Thursday.
 
President Vladimir Putin said in a televised speech the strike was a response to Ukraine's use of American and British long-range weapons 
 
 against targets inside Russia.
 
Meanwhile, Kyiv and its allies of studying debris from the new Russian missile fired on central Ukraine, as they work to assess Moscow's latest 
 
 military technology.
 
Nick Paton Walsh has the latest from Dnipro.
 
NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, it was dead of night here that people in the Dnipro saw the extraordinary 
 
 scene on their skyline of that multi warheads Russian missile experiment.
 
And according to U.S. officials in here, a children's rehabilitation center where some of the debris from the attack that night indeed landed. Children 
 
 were here at the time. Still, broken glass on the ground below me. And really, it's these vulnerable Ukrainians on the receiving end of the 
 
 broader geopolitical message that Russian president, Vladimir wanted -- Putin, wanted to send.
 
The parts of the debris of that missile on display to news agencies in Kyiv today, a select amount, clearly Kyiv trying to show the world exactly what 
 
 technology was used against them, and there is, of course, going to be a lot of forensic attention as to exactly what those missile parts indeed 
 
 show.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translator): Experts are currently analyzing the evidence and working with our partners to establish 
 
 all the details and the specifications of this missile, and to find a response together to this latest Russian escalation.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WALSH (on camera): There appears to be a consensus this was a hypersonic missile and it was one with multiple warheads, non-nuclear indeed.
 
Vladimir Putin suggested that it can potentially get through all Western air defenses, and I'm sure that the parts on display will be pored over to 
 
 see if, indeed, that provides any clues as to whether this is a technological leap by Russia or not.
 
But still here, the message itself was very much more immediate and terrifying, surely for those who saw multiple different fragments raining 
 
 down on them from above and damage still here, palpable in the freezing night.
 
Nick Paton Walsh, CNN, Dnipro, Ukraine.
 
GIOKOS: All right. Joining us now is CNN's senior international correspondent Fred Pleitgen, live in Moscow for us. Good to have you with 
 
 us, Fred.
 
So, Russia is saying that it will use any means necessary to protect itself. Take us through what they are -- they are talking about, what they 
 
 are thinking, importantly, this new type of ballistic missile, which was quite an important development, frankly.
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: An important development, and I think, an important part of their messaging as well. And 
 
 I think, a lot of the things that Nick just mentioned there in his report are extremely important right now to some of the geopolitical picture that 
 
 the Russians have been painting.
 
Because one of the things that we've seen here, Eleni, over the course of the entire weekend, is the messaging that we are seeing from Russian state 
 
 T.V., from Russian officials, from the Kremlin as well as that, this new weapon, the Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile, that, that was 
 
 something that was meant to send a message not to the Ukrainians, but certainly to the United States and its allies.
 
One thing that the Russians have been saying, the message that they have been sending.
 <br>[10:15:00]
 
And this comes also from the spokesman of the Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov, who has been saying this the entire weekend. I've looked at a lot of broadcasts 
 
 this weekend saying that the Russians believe that it was the U.S. that escalated by allowing the Ukrainians to use those longer-range weapons. 
 
 Like, for instance, the U.S. supplied ATACMS missiles.
 
But then, also, the U.K. supplied Storm Shadows air-to-surface missiles as well. That, that was the original escalation. That now, Russia is showing 
 
 how it could strike back if it wanted to.
 
Of course, this Oreshnik missile. Is a giant weapon that, as Nick just noted, can carry multiple warheads, which can be conventional, but of 
 
 course, could be nuclear as well, and certainly dropping that on a large city like Dnipro, was a big message that was sent by the Russians, and we 
 
 could see that evolve over the course of the end of last week.
 
On Friday night, very late in the evening, Vladimir Putin, once again, came out and said, this is a message to the United States and to its allies, and 
 
 that the Russians are going to keep doing things like this. That they are going to keep testing this missile. It's still in a development phase, as 
 
 the Russians have said, and that they are going to test it as they put it, in battlefield conditions.
 
So, essentially, what the Russians are saying is that they want to draw a red line. Obviously, that's a term that we've heard a lot in international 
 
 politics over the past couple of years. But they want to show that using these ATACMS missiles on the part of the Ukrainians was a step too far, as 
 
 far as the Russians are concerned.
 
And they have now upped the ante for their part, and are saying that these new missiles, this Oreshnik missile, which is very powerful, will be mass 
 
 produced and, once again, will be used again by the Russians on the battlefield, Eleni.
 
GIOKOS: Fred Pleitgen, great to see you. Thank you.
 
Well, we are starting the week with a pretty clear picture of Donald Trump's Cabinet picks. Ahead on CNN, we'll examine some of his popular and 
 
 controversial choices to lead the next administration.
 
Plus, convicted murderers Erik and Lyle Menendez are preparing for a Court hearing today where a judge could kick start their path to freedom. With 
 
 that story coming up.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
GIOKOS: President-Elect Donald Trump is heading into the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday week with most of his cabinet now chosen. One of his latest picks 
 
 is Brooke Rollins to head the Department of Agriculture. She is the CEO of the America first Policy Institute, a group with close ties to Trump's 
 
 transition team.
 
It means we now have a clearer picture of who will be -- who the next president will have around him, and this, of course, is developing over the 
 
 last few days. And the confirmation battles that may lie ahead.
 
CNN's Alayna Treene joins us now from West Palm Beach, Florida. Alayna, good to have you on again. Much of the confirmation process for Trump's 
 
 cabinet choices is expected to go smoothly. Give me a sense of where we stand right now. There are major concerns that are mounting about the likes 
 
 of Pete Hegseth, as well as to Tulsi Gabbard.
 
What more can you tell us about, frankly, the background checks that are going to be required here?
 <br>[10:20:06]
 
ALAYNA TREENE, CNN CONGRESSIONAL AND PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS REPORTER: Right. Eleni. That's definitely a big concern, particularly because, look, Donald 
 
 Trump has moved much faster than we have traditionally seen people in his position, president-elect at the same point in this transition process 
 
 move.
 
I mean, if you look back eight years ago to when he was first elected, he had only named one Cabinet pick, at this point, attorney general.
 
President Biden, at this point in the transition process, had not named anyone for his Cabinet role. So, Donald Trump is moving very quickly. And 
 
 that's part of the reason why the question over vetting and background checks -- FBI, background checks, I should say, specifically, has really 
 
 become a concern among the senators on Capitol Hill, who will be tasked with confirming all of Donald Trump's different appointments and nominees.
 
Now, part of the reason that they're not getting these FBI background checks is because Donald Trump and his team have missed a lot of the 
 
 paperwork and missed a lot of the deadlines that is traditional for this type of transition, and that includes these FBI background checks that are 
 
 really in senators minds kind of required before they begin the confirmation process.
 
Now, there, as you mentioned, I do think among all of Donald Trump's Cabinet picks and other top picks for top administration roles in his 
 
 second term, most of them are expected to have a pretty smooth confirmation process.
 
People in the Senate believe that they have the credentials that are necessary, that Donald Trump deserves the right to fill his administration 
 
 and his Cabinet with the people that he wants.
 
But there are some areas of concern, and people, I should really say, of concern. That does refer to Tulsi Gabbard. She is Donald Trump's pick to be 
 
 his director of national intelligence.
 
Some of the controversy around her is one, she is a former Democrat, but it's mainly that she is very skeptical of the way that the government -- 
 
 American government, has been conducting surveillance over the last several years. That is something where she differs from a lot of people and 
 
 conservatives, especially, about how she could potentially operate once in that role.
 
She also has ties to a lot of foreign leaders that people are uncomfortable with. She met with the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad in recent years, 
 
 something that wasn't totally confirmed or checked off by the Senate when she was in that process.
 
And so, there is some -- excuse me, in the House, she was a former House congresswoman. So, some questions around that.
 
As for Pete Hegseth, Donald Trump's pick to lead the Pentagon. One is he is a former Fox News host. Some people have questions over whether he has the 
 
 credentials, the experience, to be in that role.
 
But there is also concerns around recent sexual assault allegations against him, some of which we reported last week that came out in a police report. 
 
 And so, a lot of questions here that I think, or I know I should say that the Trump team is really working with senators on to see how they can help 
 
 assuage some of those concerns.
 
I think a big thing to watch for is many of these different picks are going to be going to Capitol Hill to be meeting with Republican senators behind 
 
 closed doors to hear what they have to say, kind of figure out what the vulnerabilities are and see what they can do and try and, you know, assure 
 
 the senators and assuage those concerns on the front end before they go through these very public confirmation hearings.
 
GIOKOS: Alayna Treene, thank you so much for that update. Now, for the first time in nearly 30 years, two high-profile convicted murderers are set 
 
 to make a public Court appearance.
 
Brothers Erik and Lyle Menendez have been serving life in prison for killing their parents. Now, they face a possible path to freedom as a judge 
 
 decides whether new evidence in their case warrants a change -- a chance to change their sentence.
 
The brothers are scheduled to appear before a judge in Los Angeles later today to discuss the next steps in their case.
 
CNN Jean Casarez is following this story for us from New York. Jean, good to have you on. Of course, everyone watching this so closely. What do we 
 
 expecting to hear today, importantly?
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
JEAN CASAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well -- 
 
GIOKOS: And tell us a little bit more about this new evidence.
 
CASAREZ: I think what is interesting is that, for the first time, the brothers, Erik and Lyle will be in court virtually, it is believed, but 
 
 yet, they will be in a courtroom.
 
And this is because of the current district attorney, George Gascon, who had such a passion in the final days of his campaign, which he lost, to 
 
 have them be released from prison.
 
And this is the highest. This is the top sentence in California. It's life without any possibility of parole. And this is a very, very serious case, 
 
 because it's a double murder case, and it is definitely a premeditated murder. I mean, that came out in the trial. There is no question of that.
 
But what George Gascon is alleging, and there are really two pathways here, because one is a habeas corpus petition, and that's going to focus on 
 
 evidence that didn't come into the trial, a letter that Erik wrote his cousin, according to documents, months before the trials began, saying, I'm 
 
 scared of my father if he's going to come into my bedroom at night.
 
Another is a former member of the group, Menudo, saying that they had been assaulted by Jose Menendez, who is -- was the father of Lyle and Erik.
 <br>[10:25:05]
 
So, that is one course. But California is really focusing in now on rehabilitation. That if you are rehabilitated to a point that you should be 
 
 able to be released to the public because of the value you have added to your life inside the prison, you can take that outside the prison.
 
And so, I think that today's hearing may be focused on that a little bit. But of course, this is a status hearing, which is just where are we now? 
 
 What do we need to do? Prosecutors, what do you need? Defense, what do you need? We'll see you in a few weeks.
 
Because at this point, December 11th, is the hearing to look at whether they should be released or not.
 
GIOKOS: Yes. It's a big question. I mean, you mentioned George Gascon. How has the L.A. district attorney's re-election failed re-election bid caused 
 
 some uncertainty over the Menendez brothers' fate?
 
CASAREZ: I think that's such an excellent question. People are not talking about that. But I think it could be significant, because Nathan Hochman, 
 
 who is going to be the upcoming D.A. He is going to actually get the reins a week from today. So, I'm shocked in the sense that they are having the 
 
 status hearing today.
 
And he has publicly said, I've got thousands of documents to go through. Thousands of pages of the first trial, thousands of pages of the second 
 
 trial. I need to go through the prison records for 34 years. I need to talk to the prosecutors, the defense attorney, the victim's family, and he says, 
 
 I'm fast at this because I was a former federal prosecutor, I'm a defense attorney, so, I know what I'm doing.
 
But there is a potential here that he may say, I know there is been rehabilitation. I understand that, but at this point in time, we need to 
 
 allow this sentence to stay, and we'll just move forward slowly in all of this. So, it will be very interesting. Because he was elected because L.A. 
 
 County wanted change. The people from Los Angeles County.
 
He is law and order. He is stricter sentencing, smart sentencing, following the law. But George Gascon, according to the public votes, was more lenient 
 
 in allowing those convicted to be out, allowing those not even to be charged with crimes that potentially could have been significant charges in 
 
 Los Angeles County to keep the public safe.
 
GIOKOS: Really great to have your insights today, Jean. Thank you so much.
 
CASAREZ: Thank you.
 
GIOKOS: And still to come, global war -- as global wars reach new flash points, America's top diplomat joins a G7 meeting for the final time before 
 
 Donald Trump takes office.
 
Plus, as thousands of Russian soldiers are fighting in Ukraine, we'll bring you rare accounts from some of the mothers who are waiting for them back in 
 
 Moscow.
 
We'll be back after this short break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:30:19]
 
GIOKOS: Welcome back to CONNECT THE WORLD. I'm Eleni Giokos. Now we're getting new details on our top story this hour, the Israeli Prime Minister 
 
 says that Israeli cabinet will vote tomorrow on the ceasefire deal that's been discussed with Hezbollah. We've also got multiple sources saying an 
 
 agreement will not be final until all issues are resolved. Now, the wars raging in the Middle East and in Ukraine will feature prominently in the G7 
 
 foreign ministers meeting today in central Italy. 
 
The delegations will discuss those wars, along with Indo-Pacific security and the ongoing security crises in Haiti and Sudan. It will be U.S. 
 
 Secretary of State Antony Blinken's last G7 summit before the Trump administration takes over the White House in January. CNN's Jennifer 
 
 Hansler is at the U.S. State Department for us. Jennifer, great to have you on. And as I just mentioned, the very last G7 for Anthony Blinken, of 
 
 course, representing the Biden administration before the Trump administration comes in.
 
So how important is this G7 meeting in terms of the U.S. exerting its influence in world affairs?
 
JENNIFER HANSLER, CNN STATE DEPARTMENT REPORTER: Well, Eleni, that's exactly right, because the Trump incoming administration is going to be 
 
 looming large over this G7 meeting. It is the last meeting of these foreign ministers before Antony Blinken and the Biden administration leaves office. 
 
 And they are going to try to push forward as much as they can on their own agenda, especially when it comes to Ukraine.
 
We have heard from the Biden administration that they are trying to surge their support, military and financial to Kyiv before they leave office in 
 
 January. We have seen a surge of military equipment. We have also seen in recent weeks that change in policy to allow Ukraine to strike with those 
 
 U.S.-provided attack on long-range missiles on sites further into Russia. So, this was a significant change in U.S. policy.
 
And when Blinken is in Italy today, he is going to be meeting with his counterparts to discuss how to continue that support and have the Europeans 
 
 sort of take on the mantle of supporting Ukraine. This is something we have also heard from European officials, the need to take up the support and 
 
 lead the charge here to continue to provide that assistance to Kyiv. The other big issue that we expect to come up is the ongoing wars in the Middle 
 
 East.
 
Even though there seems to be progress on the war between Israel and Lebanese Hezbollah, coming to a diplomatic resolution, as we heard, the 
 
 Israeli cabinet is going to be voting on a cease fire proposal tomorrow. There is still a lot that needs to be worked out on the Gaza front, there 
 
 has been very little movement, and the prospect of an incoming new incoming U.S. administration is likely to put a pause on a lot of those efforts.
 
Still, Blinken and the G7 foreign ministers will be meeting with their Arab counterparts later today to discuss a lot of these issues, Gaza, Lebanon 
 
 and all of the broader escalations in the Middle East there, Eleni.
 
GIOKOS: All right. Jennifer Hansler, thank you. Those talks come as Russia says it will protect its security interests by every means at its disposal. 
 
 On Monday, the deputy foreign minister said last week's strike on Ukraine with a hypersonic ballistic missile showed Russia was ready to respond to 
 
 what he called provocations by Ukraine's Western supporters. Now thousands of Russian troops continue to go to the front lines.
 
And the mothers of those soldiers rarely heard from throughout the conflict in Ukraine. Now speaking out to CNN, Fred Pleitgen reports from Moscow.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): As the war in Ukraine nears the three-year mark, more and more Russians are 
 
 signing up to fight. Vladimir Putin saying more than 700,000 are currently stationed in and around Ukraine. He got rare access to an event in Moscow 
 
 honoring the mothers of Russian soldiers battling in what the Kremlin still calls its special military operation. Mothers whose sons are fighting have 
 
 been killed or injured.
 
Oksana Medvedeva's son Yegor was severely wounded on the battlefield earlier this year.
 
IKSANA MEDVEDEVA, MOTHER OF RUSSIAN SOLDIER (through translator): He had surgery on his leg and the nerves had to be sewn back together, she says. 
 
 He also had surgery on his jaw, but it still has not recovered properly. He's still being treated. I am proud of my son that he is such a hero.
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over): While the Russians have been making significant battlefield gains recently, they appear to come at a heavy price. Moscow 
 
 doesn't publish casualty figures, but Western governments believe the attrition rate among Russian forces is significant.
 <br>[10:35:02]
 
To increase manpower, the U.S. and Ukraine say more than 11,000 North Korean troops are now also on Moscow's side, mostly in Russia's Kursk 
 
 region.
 
Yelena Yemelina's son Mikhail is still fighting in Ukraine. She won't say where but acknowledges for him it's tough.
 
YELENA YEMELINA, MOTHER OF RUSSIAN SOLDIER (through translator): He went through a lot of moments he doesn't like to talk about, she says, but I 
 
 found out by chance I think he's a true hero.
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over): The U.S. and its allies continue to condemn Russia's president, urging him to withdraw from Ukraine immediately. But this week 
 
 instead, a major escalation.
 
After the Biden administration allowed Ukraine to use longer-distance U.S. and U.K.-supplied missiles to strike deep inside Russia, Putin hit back 
 
 with a new intermediate-range ballistic missile capable of delivering devastating nuclear warheads, and he threatened to hit U.S. assets as well.
 
We consider ourselves entitled to use our weapons against the military objects of those countries that allowed their weapons to be used against 
 
 our objects, he said.
 
Back at the event for the soldiers' mothers, a Russian parliamentarian backing Putin up.
 
NINA OSTANINA, RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT MEMBER (through translator): We are a strong country and we've been patient for a very long time, she said, but 
 
 in the case of mass deaths of our people, if the collective West does not sober up, we should proceed to more decisive actions. We can no longer lose 
 
 any of our men.
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over): But for now, the battles continue to escalate and the losses continue to mount. As Vladimir Putin warns, the war is 
 
 increasingly becoming a struggle between Russia and the West.

GIOKOS: And ahead on CONNECT THE WORLD, Israel's oldest newspaper is hit with sanctions. We'll talk to the journalist who heads up press freedom for 
 
 the Union of Journalists in Israel. That's coming up next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
GIOKOS: Now, we are getting our first pictures from the coastal town of Marsa Alam in Egypt where a tourist boat sank in the Red Sea. Egyptian 
 
 authorities say 17 people are missing. Officials told The Associated Press, 28 people had been rescued, some of them airlifted to hospital, and 
 
 according to the Regional Governor, 45 passengers and crew of various nationalities were on board.
 
Now, Haaretz is Israel's oldest newspapers, also respected internationally. Now the Israeli government has placed sanctions on it. Benjamin Netanyahu's 
 
 cabinet lashing out in response to the paper's critical coverage of the war against Hamas. Haaretz describes the move as an attempt to silence a 
 
 critical independent newspaper. This moves -- move has been condemned both outside and inside of Israel.
 <br>[10:40:10]
 
The Union of Journalists in Israel have said the Israeli government has "declared war on the freedom of press." In a statement on X, it went on to 
 
 say, "it is time to remind that government publications in the media are not a prize that the government can deny to those who criticize it. So, it 
 
 is doubtful whether the government's decision will stand the test of the high court."
 
Anat Saagusti is in charge of the freedom of the press at the Union of Journalists in Israel. She joins us now live from Tel Aviv. Anat, great to 
 
 have you with us. And I think I really need to start off with this because we're hearing a lot of the criticism and the backlash of this decision. But 
 
 is there legal recourse that hearts could take? Could you -- could you play this out for us? Because these are just sanctions right now that have been 
 
 imposed.
 
ANAT SARAGUSTI, ISRAEL JOURNALIST: Well, we think we at the Union of Journalists think that those sanctions are illegal and we are considering 
 
 to petition the Supreme Court about that. But even if the Supreme Court rules against those sanctions, the damage has been done already, because 
 
 they are, you know, encouraging ministries in the government to ban Haaretz. They're encouraging commercial companies to ban Haaretz.
 
And they are making Haaretz an illegal publication. And this damage doesn't really need legislation, you know, and this is what's worrying. And the 
 
 other thing that is very worrying now we see that as one chapter in a bigger master plan to silence journalists in Israel and to weaken the 
 
 freedom of the press in Israel.
 
GIOKOS: And you say that it's part of a bigger master plan, and very interesting point. But I want to take you through what the Communications 
 
 Minister Shlomo Karri said and I quote. "We must not allow a reality in which the publisher of an official newspaper in the states of Israel will 
 
 call for the imposition of sanctions against it, and will support the enemies of the state in the midst of a war, and will be financed by it, 
 
 while international bodies undermining the legitimacy of the State of Israel. It's right to defend itself and actually imposing sanctions against 
 
 it and its leaders.
 
You know, and It's really interesting because it's basically referring to what the Harris publisher said in an event in London and being very 
 
 critical, frankly, of Benjamin Netanyahu. But you're saying this is part of a wider master plan to impose sanctions or to intimidate the media. Take us 
 
 through that.
 
SARAGUSTI: Both. I mean, they're introducing a few clusters of legislation, first to destroy the public broadcast in Israel. They want to defund the 
 
 public broadcast in Israel. They want to waive fees from T.V. channels that are aligned with the government ideology. They are weakening and the 
 
 freedom of the press. They are taking authority to shut down media outlets. They already shut down Al Jazeera in Israel.
 
They want to take control on the internet and prevent people from logging in to different Web sites. So, this is part of the master plan. The other 
 
 part of the master plan is organized, orchestrated, sometimes funded smear campaign against media outlets and against individual journalists. For 
 
 example, they call the three T.V. in Israel, TV channel in Israel, Al Jazeera to indicate that they are engaged in treason against the state.
 
I mean, this is very serious, and they smear against individual -- sorry.
 
GIOKOS: Yes. I'm just -- I've got a question for you. Do journalists inside of Israel and Israeli journalists themselves feel intimidated by 
 
 government?
 
SARAGUSTI: Definitely so. It has a chilling effect. It has, you know, an effect of self-censorship, because journalists would be anxious to go into 
 
 this. Minefields in which they will be smeared against, incited against. They will face even physical attacks. They were crews of T.V. cameras that 
 
 were physically attacked by mob because they were encouraged by ministers in the cabinet to see the journalists as enemies of the -- of the states 
 
 and enemies of this society of the State of Israel.
 <br>[10:45:03]
 
I mean, this is really, really happening right now. It's not a fear, it's an actual result.
 
GIOKOS: A scary prospect, because once you see an attack on media, you know, then you don't have press freedom, and that is a very big issue. So, 
 
 on a personal note, from your perspective, are you concerned where this is going? You were talking about legal action and this going to the Supreme 
 
 Court or going to the High Court? How do you see this playing out?
 
SARAGUSTI: First of all, we support Haaretz and we support Haaretz journalists and we support the Haaretz journalist's freedom of speech. I 
 
 mean, this is very important, because what he did, the minister of -- what I call anti-communication, he was intimidating and he was inciting against 
 
 them. So, we, at the Union of Journalists support Haaretz. We want -- we are trying to create a collective solidarity for hearts journalists and for 
 
 other journalists who are being intimidated and attacked.
 
And we are going to use all the legal tools and other tools that we have in our toolbox to support the press freedom in Israel and fight back against 
 
 this trend by the government. So, what's interesting here, specifically with Haaretz, it's actually saying that no public entity can, you know, buy any advertisements, and in fact, 
 
 also it goes down to subscriptions of any government employee.
 
And I wonder if there's any way that government could exert that kind of influence over private companies. The reason it's interesting is that it's 
 
 trying to squeeze Haaretz revenues so that it becomes economically unviable.
 
SARAGUSTI: Yes. They're trying to intimidate and to harm the ability of Haaretz to sustain. And this is very serious. I guess Haaretz will sustain 
 
 because it's a strong newspaper, But still -- I mean -- and about private companies, you know, it's a trend. It depends on the climate that you 
 
 create a political climate, and what will be more -- I mean, bring more revenue to them to align with the government or to be independently 
 
 supporting freedom of the press.
 
GIOKOS: You know, you said this isn't going to be the end of Haaretz. Do you truly believe that? It is the oldest newspaper in Israel. It's going to 
 
 be financially squeezed clearly? No.
 
SARAGUSTI: I don't think it's going to be the end of Haaretz. No, we can't allow that. I mean, this is going to be very, very serious. I don't think 
 
 it will happen, but it will really harm them in terms of economic sustainability.
 
GIOKOS: All right. Anat, great to have you with us. Thank you so much.
 
All right. Across the United States, millions of people are expected to travel this Thanksgiving holiday. But they may have more to contend with 
 
 besides crowded seats and traffic, how mother nature could dampen their travel plans. That's coming up just ahead.
 
Plus, meet Peach and Blossom. The two of the happiest turkeys this Thanksgiving week. Thanks to a presidential pardon. We'll be explaining 
 
 this right after the short break. Stay with CNN.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:50:00]
 
GIOKOS: Millions of Americans are expected to travel this week for Thursday's Thanksgiving holiday. AAA expects this Thanksgiving to be the 
 
 busiest on record with estimates of nearly 80 80 million people hitting road or the skies. On the radar, a series of serious storms expected to 
 
 bring rain and snow that could throw a serious range into travel plans. CNN Meteorologist Derek Van Dam is tracking it all for us. Here to dampen your 
 
 plans clearly, Derek, are you a bearer of bad news?
 
DEREK VAN DAM, CNN METEOROLOGIST: This obviously means we have to pack our patients this year, whether or not that's for the dinner table at your 
 
 holiday plans this weekend or if it's for the airlines that we're going to have to contend with because of the weather, right? So, we're going to tie 
 
 these things together, because a series of weather systems will move from west to east across the United States.
 
So, busiest travel year, time of the year, I should say. In fact, Tuesday and Wednesday of this week are the busiest travel days of the year across 
 
 the U.S. Right now, we have a generally dry outlook here along the east coast. If you're getting an early start in your travel plans, no problems 
 
 for let's say JFK. Southward into Atlanta, Hartsfield, Jackson International Airport. The same cannot be said, though, for Chicago, 
 
 Detroit and northward into Minneapolis, St Paul.
 
And there's another storm system. This is the big one that's going to send kind of a wave of weather across from the west to east. But breaking down 
 
 these numbers, you heard Eleni say, almost 80 million Americans expected to travel. About seven percent of them will travel by air. That's roughly six 
 
 million people. So, looking at the specifics for the airlines, again, no problems. You can see the shades of green on our little airline figure 
 
 there.
 
That indicates no weather delays on account of bad weather. This, of course, represents the cold front that's moving through. So that shade of 
 
 yellow could bring some minor delays to Chicago and Detroit. And of course, the shade of orange means that moderate delays because of the weather 
 
 incoming along the west coast. So, as we take you into tomorrow, that weather moves inland and then brings the delays, at least the potential to 
 
 Salt Lake City and places like Denver.
 
And this is the forecast rain and snow accumulation through this entire week. So, a lot of blue, a lot of white and purples on this map, indicating 
 
 that we have an active weather pattern across North America. And here it is, the first cold front moving through now, bringing the delays, or 
 
 potential delays, Chicago, Detroit. Eventually, we'll get some rainfall into the east coast by early Tuesday and into the lunchtime hours.
 
There's the next major weather disruptor. This is the storm we're paying very close attention to because where it goes from here, how it 
 
 strengthens, how it evolves is so critical to what happens on that busy travel day of Wednesday and certainly into the day on Thursday. So, looking 
 
 to kind of explode in strength and coverage. So, rainfall expected on the southern tail of the storm all the way down to Atlanta and Florida.
 
But that is snowfall for northern New England. How far that creeps south? That's still to be determined. But the latest weather models we look at 
 
 this does appear to be a rain event for the major East Coast cities along that I-95 corridor, Washington, D.C., New York City, Philadelphia, all the 
 
 way to Boston. So, we're enjoying above average temperatures now, but that cold front I just showed you a moment ago is going to change things 
 
 dramatically.
 
A lot of blues and purples on this map. That means the temperatures are going to tumble, and there are going to be many locations over the eastern 
 
 half of the U.S. that will be protected from this cold shot of air. In fact, Chicago will be running 15 to 20 degrees below. Average by 
 
 Thanksgiving. New York City, we've got a cool and wet Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, which starts at 9:00 am on Thursday morning, first time to see 
 
 Santa for the kids.
 
And they will also be cooling off dramatically by the weekend as well here in Atlanta. More the same. Eleni, I am the bearer of bad news but that is 
 
 my job.
 
GIOKOS: Derek, you must -- you -- listen, Derek, you must be the best travel partner. I can imagine everyone saying to you, I'm going to travel 
 
 to wherever and then you'll be like, let me tell you what you should do and then you pull out your little apps or whatever you do to predict the 
 
 weather.
 
VAN DAM: That's right.
 
GIOKOS: Brilliant. I'm calling you next time I go somewhere.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
GIOKOS: Oh, that's brilliant.
 
VAN DAM: I'll meet you in South Africa. 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
GIOKOS: I'll be calling you. I'm coming to New York in December, so maybe meet you there. It will be good.
 
VAN DAM: Perfect. See you then.
 
GIOKOS: See you soon, Derek.
 
VAN DAM: All right, Eleni.
 
GIOKOS: All right. Next hour. For the final time, U.S. President Joe Biden will use his pardon power for the deserving turkeys at the White House. 
 
 Meet Peach and Blossom, who, thanks to the President will be spared from being part of a turkey feast this week. And it is the 77th year the U.S. 
 
 president was has honored this Thanksgiving week tradition. Always a big holiday event at the White House.
 
CNN's Kayla Tausche joins us at the White House. Kayla, so much excitement. I mean, these, turkeys are, you know, some of the very few that are going 
 
 to survive this week. Take us through what we can expect.
 
(CROSSTALK) 
 <br>[10:55:07]
 
GIOKOS: But let me tell you a little bit about it while we're trying to get her audio back up. OK. So, this is the presidential pardon for the turkey. 
 
 It basically -- have you got -- I was just -- I was just about to do your head, Kayla, you had no -- you had no sound.
 
KAYLA TAUSCHE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: I'm sorry about that. But, of course, this is one of the marquee events of the holiday season 
 
 here at the White House. It has dated back centuries, back to the date -- days of Abraham Lincoln, folklore going back centuries. It is a raucous 
 
 event on the White House South Lawn. It is something that is well attended by members of the public, members of the administration.
 
So, they choose these turkeys based on their calm temperaments. Their ability to withstand these crowds, these bright flash bulbs, and, of 
 
 course, the lots of laughs from those who are attending. Peach and Blossom are from Northfield, Minnesota. They are 40 and 41 pounds respectively. 
 
 They were born in July and in the four months since then, the chair of the National Turkey Federation says they've been listening to a steady stream 
 
 of poke music and ACDC.
 
They are headed to what is called an interpretive agriculture center, after their part, and essentially a learning center that's a step above a petting 
 
 zoo here in the United States, where, of course, they will be spared from being on anyone's table in the future. As you mentioned, this is President 
 
 Biden's fourth and final Turkey pardon. It is always a moment of levity here at the White House because it -- this year comes after a bruising 
 
 campaign cycle against the backdrop of simmering geopolitical tensions.
 
So, it is something that can at least allow the staff here who has been through quite a gauntlet over the last several months, with their candidate 
 
 dropping out of the race and then their party losing power here in Washington, that at least that can give them a moment of comic relief.
 
GIOKOS: All right. Absolutely. Kayla, good to have you on. Thank you so much. Thank you for joining us on CONNECT THE WORLD. I'm Eleni Giokos.
