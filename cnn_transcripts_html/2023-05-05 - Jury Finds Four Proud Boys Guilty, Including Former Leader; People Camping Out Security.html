KARA SCANNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  He says, well, historically, that's true with stars. And Carroll's attorney says, True with stars that they can grab women by the -- well, that's what if you look over the last million years, I guess that's been largely true. Not always, but largely true unfortunately, or fortunately.
 
And then he's also though addresses the defamation claims in this case. Now this is all based on a true social post he made. And he's, you know, asked, did you write this yourself? And he says, oh, yes, I wrote it myself. You know, I don't know who this woman is. It's a hoax. She's not my type.
 
And then he says to Carroll's attorney, this, you wouldn't be a choice of mine, either, to be honest, I wouldn't under any circumstances have any interest in you so certainly not taking a demurer posture in his deposition from the Trump that we see often in these campaign speeches.
 
ERICA HILL, CNN ANCHOR:  Yes, certainly not -- I mean I'm going to leave that one alone, Kara, appreciate it, thank you.
 
KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN ANCHOR:  New overnight, The Washington Post has just put out a report drawing more scrutiny to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. I apparently a high profile conservative judicial activist arranged for the wife of Justice Thomas, her name is Ginni Thomas.
 
So we paid tens of thousands of dollars, but that there should be "no mention of her". This is how it all worked according to The Washington Post, the conservative judicial activist known as Leonard Leo, who plays a high profile role in many Republican circles.
 
He advises a network of conservative non-profits, including one known as the judicial education project, and 2012, the same year that non- profit filed a brief to the Supreme Court in a landmark voting rights case. Leonard Leo told Kellyanne Conway of course, who later became a Trump Adviser that he wanted to give Ginni Thomas another $25,000 with quote "no mention of Ginni".
 
Of course, that day her company billed the judicial education project for $25,000. And that money was for Ginni Thomas. Documents reviewed by the post show that Conway's company paid Thomas's firm $80,000 between June 2011 and June 2012.
 
It's still not fully clear what exactly Ginni Thomas did for Conway's polling company or for the judicial education project. The non-profit did file a brief in Shelby versus holder where the court invalidated key parts of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Justice Thomas wrote an opinion in that case that was consistent with judicial education projects position.
 
Here's how literally I was responding to all of this reporting, "The Work Ginni did here did not involve anything connected with either the Court's business or the other legal issues. Knowing how disrespectful, malicious and gossipy people can be, I have always tried to protect the privacy of Justice Thomas and Ginny".
 
You should know the post did not receive responses from Justice Thomas from Ginni Thomas his wife or from Kellyanne Conway in this.
 
HILL:  In one of the highest-profile January 6 cases yet a jury in Washington has convicted four far right Proud Boys' members of seditious conspiracy, including its former leader Enrique Tarrio. Prosecutors accused five men mounting a sophisticated operation to block the transfer of power from Former President Trump to President Joe Biden.
 
The jury convicted four of sedition and three other conspiracy charges obstructing the Electoral College vote and tampering with evidence. The fifth man was found guilty on a handful of other felonies. Now the verdict is a major win for the Justice Department marking the third time prosecutors have secured guilty sedition verdicts linked to the January 6 insurrection.
 
Attorney General Merrick Garland said it is clear the DOJ will do everything in its power to defend democracy.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MERRICK GARLAND, ATTORNEY GENERAL:  The evidence presented at trial detail the extent of the violence at the Capitol on January 6, and the central role these defendants played in setting into motion the unlawful events of that day.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HILL:  Tarrio's lawyer has argued prosecutors were using his client as a scapegoat and has already promised to appeal the decision. Let's bring it now, Harvard Law Professor Alan Jenkins he's also the co- author of 1/6, the graphic novel, which is out today.
 
Good to have you with us this morning. We're going to talk a little bit about that but first, I'm just curious, your take on what we saw in terms of these guilty verdicts? What does that do here? What is that message?
 
PROFESSOR ALAN JENKINS, HARVARD LAW SCHOOL:  Well, you know, stepping back democracy is the most important value we have as Americans, these guys tried to steal it. They tried to overthrow a full and fair election, and four of them were convicted of conspiracy of seditious conspiracy. So I think that's appropriate.
 
I think we also see that the jury was careful. They convicted some defendants of some things and other things. So I think it gives us some confidence that they were really paying close attention.
 
The implications are significant their multiple investigations into tampering with this election, at least two of them involving President Trump. So we'll have to wait and see but it's an important big step.
 
COLLINS:  So they did pay close attention to the charges here. One thing that I was interested by as this was breaking yesterday, and this verdict was -- is Pezzola.
 <br>[06:35:00]
 
One of the figures here was not convicted or he wasn't going charged and convicted of seditious conspiracy like the others because he wasn't a member, he wasn't a leader in the Proud Boys but he among the five of them was the most violent that day.
 
JENKINS:  He was and he was convicted of other charges will remember the images of him taking the shield from an officer and using it to break into the Capitol building. So he was certainly an actor here. But seditious conspiracy requires some other elements. And the jury found that hadn't been proved in his case.
 
HILL:  When we look at what else has to come here, and we look at other pending cases, and what we heard from Merrick Garland. Do you think this is sending the message that the Justice Department wants it to send it to being heard by the right people?
 
JENKINS:  Well, it depends who we think are the right people, I think that the threats to our democracy still remain, I don't think you see these actors going away, particularly the Proud Boys. And so you know, whether they're hearing the message that this was the wrong thing to do, I don't know.
 
Whether the American public is seeing that there is some measure of accountability for an attempt to overthrow a democracy, I think, yes, maybe perhaps not enough. But I think we see some important steps there.
 
COLLINS:  And one thing here in your book out today, and why this is so relevant to this entire discussion, is what could have happened that day. And you, kind of envision the scenario. What is the worst case scenario of what could have happened that day?
 
JENKINS:  Well, you know, regarding the book, I love comic books, and I love democracy, and our democracy remains at risk. And so a comic book seemed like a good way to reach a large audience with that message. In terms of what could have happened, you know, not much would have need to have changed, you remember that the professor, pardon me, Officer Goodman led the mob away from the Senate chamber.
 
If they had turned right instead of left as they do in our graphic novel, we could have had a completely different scenario. If President Trump had the opportunity to declare martial law to deputize the Proud Boys and the Oath keepers as they were asking him to do, we could have found ourselves almost immediately in an authoritarian state. It's very scary, and a lot of those dangers still exist.
 
HILL:  I mean, it fascinated me and as you send copies to 150, 150 members of Congress?
 
JENKINS:  We send copies to 150 election denier in Congress.
 
HILL:  Election denier.
 
JENKINS:  So they can grapple with the implications of what they tried to do. We also sent it to a lot of election defenders in Congress, a lot of people, elected officials, both parties, who stood up for democracy, and did the right thing that day. And so we thought it was important, both to praise and reward tomorrow Free Comic Book Day. I'm sure you didn't know that and also some kind of carnation is going on apparently tomorrow.
 
HILL:  And it's a big horse race too there's a lot happening.
 
JENKINS:  So a big day but in any event, we wanted to send a message both to the deniers and to the supporters of democracy.
 
HILL:  Yes, good to have you here. We appreciate it. Thank you so much.
 
JENKINS:  Thank you.
 
COLLINS:  And as of course we just mentioned the coronation of King Charles the third is happening in less than 24 hours. CNN's Max Foster is live where else Buckingham Palace with a preview.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[06:40:00]

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We were here in 2011. We camped out across the street and so we're just back to do it again for. I don't know when we'd ever get to do coordination.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HILL:  So there you have it this morning. Just one of many excited royal fans from around the world camped out ready for King Charles the third's coronation tomorrow. Police have deployed more than 29,000 officers to prepare for one of their greatest ever security challenges known as operation Golden Orb.
 
They have firearms officers, dog handlers, mounted police, helicopters all in place to keep people safe, including our own Max Foster. We want, Max, to stay safe. He's live in London this morning outside Buckingham Palace, boy a lot of excitement brewing, what's happening there on the ground? MAX FOSTER, CNN ROYAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, it's also to keep the crown jewels safe and never allowed out of the Tower of London normally, so they've got all these priceless you know, ornaments really, which are part of the ceremony and really an expression of the fact that this is not, these aren't just historic items.
 
These are part of a working monarchy. So I think you know, you might be pro monarchy, you might be anti-monarchy, but one thing you are guaranteed of, if you tune in tomorrow to see what's going on, it will be a spectacular show. We haven't seen anything like this for 70 years.
 
For more than 1000 years, the coronation ceremony for English monarchs has remained largely unchanged. King Charles will walk into Westminster Abbey in the footsteps of his ancestors, ancient symbols like the Stone of Scone.
 
See some Scotland by King Edward in the 13th century, and using coronations ever since brought to London for Saturday's event. The palace says he also wants to reflect modern Britain and look to the future. The challenge will be how to do both during a cost of living crisis.
 
Charles will be crowned with the St. Edward's crown, the very same one placed upon previous monarchs. Crown Jewels will feature including scepters, a Golden Orb and various swords each with their own symbolism. He'll wear robes that have been passed down through the generations.
 
The anointing, the most sacred spiritual part of the service will be hidden from view by a special screen. One of the only newly made pieces for the coronation, because Charles, who's always been known for his environmental campaigning has been keen to emphasize reuse.
 <br>[06:45:00]
 
He'll be welcomed to the abbey first by a young chorister, to whom he'll say come not to be served, but to serve. Inclusivity as at the top of his agenda, the ceremony will be conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury, the most senior member of the Church of England after the King.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JUSTIN WELBY, ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY:  It looks rounded our society and seeks to reflect us as we are with joy and celebration.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER (voice over):  For the first time people of multiple faiths will have a role. Even the Pope has sent a gift. Fragments believed to be of Jesus's Cross, which had been incorporated into this new one, which will lead the coronation procession. Symbols the new monarch hopes will be enough to reflect his continued relevance in the modern world whilst honoring sacred tradition. A truly global event Heads of State from around the world are flying in. There'll be a reception tonight at Buckingham Palace behind me. We think it will be the largest gathering of Heads of State ever, certainly in the U.K.
 
HILL:  Wow! All right, Max, appreciate it. Thank you and of course CNNs coverage of the coronation of King Charles the third begins tomorrow morning at 5 Eastern right here on CNN.
 
COLLINS:  Yep, set your alarms also this morning. We are seeing newly released footage. You're don't want to see this you haven't had an update on this case in a while but there are new court documents related to the murders of those four Idaho college students what we've learned ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[06:50:00]
 
COLLINS:  This morning, newly released footage and documents and the case against Bryan Kohberger, the suspect in the quadruple murder that last November at the University of Idaho. A number of body cam videos were released and this one show Kohberger are being pulled over for running a red light nearby Washington State University a month before the killings took place.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRYAN KOHBERGER, A SUSPECT IN THE QUADRUPLE MURDER:  I do apologize if I was asking you too many questions about the law. I wasn't trying to like.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No, no, no, not at all. I understand you're up from here.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COLLINS:  The officer who is speaking with him there let him go without writing a ticket. It was cited in a probable cause affidavit noting that the video showed him as the driver and sole occupant of that white sedan.
 
Joining us now for more on these documents and what they uncovered CNN's Jean Casarez. A lot of material that was released and you've been covering this so closely. I wonder what stood out the most to you.
 
JEAN CASAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, first of all in that video, the date is critically important. It's October 14, it is almost one month to the day when those murders happened. And so to see him and to hear him and the audio is really good. If we have any more of that, you know, I would love the audience to --.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No, no, I think you know I stopped you. You ran the red light.
 
KOHBERGER:  What actually happened was I was stuck in the middle of an intersection.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes, I was behind you the whole time, yes.
 
KOHBERGER:  Yes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  So technically, we're not supposed to enter the intersection at all for that reason because if the light turns red, then you're stuck in the intersection and then you run the red light. So that's the reason I stopped you.
 
KOHBERGER:  I'm actually just from a very rural area. So we just don't have crosswalks so unless I visit to an area where there are crashes. It's not very frequent.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.
 
KOHBERGER:  I do apologize if I was asking you too many questions.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  OK, so--
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CASAREZ:  You see him interacting, very polite, very contrary to anything that happened one month later in that home in Moscow. Now also documents were released. We want to show everybody they did testing on the scene for blood in that apartment. We knew they had found some reddish stains that had come out before.
 
But if you look at the document that is to the left of the one that is bright and white, you will see that there is one line and one checkmark that says positive, presumptively positive for blood. They found two stains that they believe could be blood they did testing at the same one was a pillow that didn't have a pillow case the other was a mattress cover.
 
And when you do a presumptive test at the scene that denotes positivity for blood, then you have to go into the lab to do a conclusive test but obviously they took those swabs there they went to the apartment it's very obvious. Idaho was communicating with Pennsylvania when they're making the arrest.
 
Idaho was flying in, they executed the search at the apartment and they found a lot of things were just cleared out they did collect things the defense a few weeks later went back with law enforcement that defense collected even more things to put in their possession.
 
COLLINS:  Wow!
 
CASAREZ:  Didn't do any of this before.
 
COLLINS:  Yes, it's also disturbing especially as you're just learning more about this as this trial is obviously going to progress. Keep us updated if anything else comes out of what you see there but it is remarkable like you said to hear from him.
 
CASAREZ:  Yes, it is.
 
COLLINS:  Just so strange.
 
CASAREZ:  And he has still pled not guilty.
 
HILL:  Jean, thank you. Up next are some new CNN reporting on how Russia is foiling game changing U.S. made weapons in Ukraine. Also take a look at this. Fist flying in Turkey after a Russian Representative took down the Ukrainian flag at a summit we'll show you more that video.

 <br>[06:55:00]
 
HILL:  The Warriors evening up their playoff series against the Lakers with a blowout win in game two.
 
COLLINS:  Andy Scholes joins us with more. Andy, obviously it's just everyday it's a great game for Steph Curry.
 
ANDY SCHOLES, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR:  Yes, it seems like that LA guys. He's just the game of basketball evidence series. You know, I really had seven games written all over and it was the Warriors making the adjustments in game two. And they certainly worth to JaMychal Green starting for Kevon Looney who was feeling a bit under the weather he gave the Warriors a boost on offense scoring 15 points in just 13 minutes of the Lakers.
 
They actually led by seven after the first quarter of this one for the second and third quarters just belong to Golden State the outscored LA 84 to 47. Klay Thompson getting red hot make it 8 of his 11 threes for 30 points wars recruits to a 127-100 win.

KLAY THOMPSON, GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS GUARD:  We know the broad -- law ADC law it's 1-1 at the end of the day. We got to go to LA and get one and go from there.
 
LEBRON JAMES, LOS ANGELES LAKERS FORWARD:  And they made the adjustments and you know we knew we were going to do that. That's what a championship team does.
