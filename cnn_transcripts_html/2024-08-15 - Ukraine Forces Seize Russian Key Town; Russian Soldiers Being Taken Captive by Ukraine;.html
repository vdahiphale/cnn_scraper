LYNDA KINKADE, CNN ANCHOR:  It is 7:00 a.m. in Tokyo, 3:00 p.m. in Los Angeles, and 6:00 p.m. here in Atlanta. I'm Lynda Kinkade, in for Julia 
 
 Chatterley. And wherever you are in the world, this is your "First Move."
 
A warm welcome to "First Move," here is today's need to know. Ukraine's President Zelenskyy says his forces have seized a key town inside Russia. 
 
 Five people are facing charges connected to the death of "Friends" actor Matthew Perry. Taylor Swift performs in London in her first concert since a 
 
 foiled terror plot in Vienna. And the 15-year-old named Times Magazine's Kid of the Year for trying to fight skin cancer with a special soap. That 
 
 conversation and plenty more coming up.
 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says his forces have captured a key town inside Russia as the stunning cross-border incursion makes new gains. 
 
 And the Ukrainians aren't just seizing land, they're seizing prisoners.
 
More video is emerging of Russian soldiers apparently being taken captive in this surprise assault. This video is showing alleged prisoners face down 
 
 in the dirt guarded by Ukrainian troops. Kyiv says POWs will be treated under the Geneva Conventions.
 
This offensive is now entering its 10th day, and Russia is struggling with how to respond. U.S. officials say Moscow is diverting thousands of troops 
 
 from occupied Ukraine back into Russia.
 
Well, a federal emergency was declared in the Kursk region days ago. But Ukrainian forces are still on the move, and Moscow has declared a new 
 
 federal emergency in neighboring Belgorod.
 
Our Chief International Security Correspondent Nick Paton Walsh, is in Sumy, Ukraine, near the border with Russia. Good to have you there for us, 
 
 Nick. So, a dramatic shift in the battlefield. What have you been seeing?
 
NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, we've just come back from being on the border area between Ukraine and 
 
 Russia, the specific border post, in fact, where Ukraine began, it seems, its push into Russia, now over 10 -- nine days ago.
 
And it's startling to see the devastation at that particular border point in itself, but even still now, the extraordinary freedom of movement for 
 
 Ukrainian troops heading back and forth into Russia, and also, the large amount of resources, of armor, some of it western supply that we saw them 
 
 driving up into Russia and coming back again as well.
 
There's been a sea change too, Lynda, as well, in terms of how freely the Ukrainians move around during the daytime. For the past months, they've 
 
 been in trenches, unable to use daylight hours for the most part in frontline areas because of the threat of Russian attack drones.
 
Now, Ukraine has their own, but that's basically left both sides only moving around often at night or in daytime at extreme risk, none of that at 
 
 all from, what we saw today in the areas around the border and the Ukrainians just relaxedly moving back and forth, reminding me, frankly, of 
 
 a time a year ago before drones were indeed such a threat.
 
That would suggest potentially that they have some sense of confidence built perhaps from a new capability. We didn't see much concern too about 
 
 the threat of Russian air. So, something has clearly changed in the way Ukraine thinks about how it's going to pursue this particular battle. We 
 
 don't quite know what that is yet, but they are increasingly confident.
 
We are now in the 10th day, as you say, of their advances. 35 kilometers deep in, they said they got today, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr 
 
 Zelenskyy clear that they've taken now entirely the town of Sudzha, which had been the focus of their initial advance. There's still been clashes 
 
 inside of it, but is now, it seems, fully under their control.
 
As their grip seems to expand to various different areas in Kursk, and also it seems to Belgorod too, where there's been, as you know, an emergency 
 
 situation and evacuations declared just recently. So, this offensive just continuing, it seems, in its strength and confidence.
 
KINKADE:  And, Nick, the Pentagon has now confirmed that it has seen Russian units moving from the front lines in Ukraine back into the Kursk 
 
 region. What does this ground offensive say about Russia's weakness?
 
WALSH:  Yes, look, I mean, obviously they were not expecting to be attacked in the Sumy direction, into Kursk. It's interesting because there had been 
 
 Ukrainian concerns a few months ago that, indeed, after a push into Kharkiv region by Russia and a new Russian invasion or incursion, that they might 
 
 try Russia, something similar in Sumy.
 <br>[18:05:00]
 
But instead, a few months later, it was Ukraine that pushed backwards in the opposite direction, Russia entirely unprepared, simply not expecting 
 
 this and leaving weaker units, some from Chechnya, some national guard, simply not prepared to take on the kind of forces that Ukraine threw at 
 
 this particular attack.
 
As I say, the amount of resources we saw on the road up towards that border point, quite startling. The most amount of western supply vehicles I've 
 
 seen in one concentrated area since the war began. So, it's quite clear that Russia was not expecting this.
 
But what is most startling, Lynda, is how, you know, 10 days in now, we're simply seeing them unable to kick the Ukrainians out. And I think most of 
 
 them expected this Ukrainian advance or incursion to be short lived. But it seems to instead be growing. We see evidence of them, you know, amassing 
 
 more than just the forces we've seen potentially inside Russia at the moment and the possibility this is something that's going to continue to 
 
 grow in strength and in areas inside which it controls every day Ukraine's commands announcing, an extra part of terrain, another 150 square 
 
 kilometers we're at since 48 hours ago.
 
So, startling how this continues to gain momentum. But also, Ukraine persisting with something which many, I think, have felt they might have 
 
 begun to slow down by now. Instead, the opposite seems to be the case. Lynda.
 
KINKADE:  Yes. Really is just extraordinary. Nick Paton Walsh, great to have you there in Sumy, Ukraine. Thanks so much.
 
Well, now to the race for the White House. The Republican candidate, Donald Trump, has been holding a news conference at his New Jersey golf club, 
 
 where he continued to attack Democrat Kamala Harris on economic issues. And all of this as the cost of living and other economic issues begin taking 
 
 center stage on the campaign trail.
 
Well, earlier today, in the U.S. State of Maryland, Harris and President Joe Biden appeared on stage together for the first time since she replaced 
 
 him as the party's presidential candidate. The two touting the Biden administration success in bringing down the cost of prescription drugs.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE:  We believe deeply every senior in our nation should be able to 
 
 live with security, stability, and dignity. And so, in the United States of America, no senior should have to choose between either filling their 
 
 prescription or paying their rent.
 
JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  For years, Big Pharma blocked Medicare from negotiating lower drug prices. The consequence, they're able to maintain 
 
 the exorbitant price increases and the profits are uncalled for. Look, but this time, we finally beat Big Pharma.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KINKADE:  Well, after lengthy negotiations, the Biden administration announcing Thursday that it has struck a deal with drug companies to lower 
 
 the price of 10 medications, and that's just the start. Stephen Collinson joins me now.
 
Let's start with that, Stephen, because it was interesting seeing Biden and Harris together for the first time in three and a half weeks since Biden 
 
 dropped out of the presidential race. Both claiming credit for this policy that will bring down the cost of prescription drugs. Trump called it a 
 
 communist price controls just a short time ago. How will this impact -- this policy impact Americans?
 
STEPHEN COLLINSON, CNN POLITICS SENIOR REPORTER:  I think it's going to have a big impact on the life of many Americans, especially seniors that 
 
 use these categories of drugs to treat cancer, diabetes, heart disease. It's going to save them potentially thousands of dollars a year when they 
 
 have to stump up for these out-of-pocket drugs costs.
 
So, that's the reason why you saw the vice president standing with the president to claim a share of the credit for a very significant win for the 
 
 administration as she tries to perhaps get a little bit of distance from the president in other areas in terms of their economic policy and as she 
 
 tries to shrug off attacks by Trump to the effect that she's to blame for the big inflation and grocery price hikes that we've seen throughout the 
 
 last four years.
 
So, it's a significant moment and it's something that could well be quite valuable to the vice president as she seeks the votes of senior voters in 
 
 the coming months.
 
KINKADE:  And of course, as much as people were listening to the policy, we were also looking at the body language and the optics between Harris and 
 
 Biden. We heard yesterday Biden joking about the fact that he'll be looking for a job soon. And today, we heard him joke about the fact that he, you 
 
 know, exaggerated that he'd been a senator for 217 years. What did you make of the optics?
 
COLLINSON:  I thought that the president looked quite well and rested, actually. Perhaps the alleviation of the need to have a campaign across the 
 
 country, an intense campaign of Donald Trump maybe sort of making him feel a little bit better. He did seem quite robust, far more so than we saw in 
 
 that debate.
 <br>[18:10:00]
 
I think what we saw in that room in Prince George's County in Maryland was a great deal of love towards the president. And I'd suggest that's going to 
 
 be a preview of what we're going to see on Monday night at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, when Biden will give a speech and 
 
 symbolically hand the torch of the Democratic Party to Kamala Harris.
 
I think there's going to be a great deal of adulation. I was speaking to a lot of Democrats at a rally, a Harris rally last week in Philadelphia, and 
 
 there was an outpouring of love for the president and respect for his decision to step aside. So, I think it's going to be quite a night on 
 
 Monday.
 
KINKADE:  And Donald Trump started speaking about an hour and a half ago. He was still speaking just as I came into studio. A very long speech about 
 
 how America is a failing nation. He claimed that Kamala Harris had broken the economy and the borders. What was your take away from that speech?
 
COLLINSON:  You know, I've been watching Trump very closely now since the summer of 2015, when he launched his first campaign. I can't remember a 
 
 time, you know, over that period when he has looked so ragged and ill- disciplined and almost disorientated as he does now.
 
I think the shift in the race, the withdrawal of Biden, the fact that he now has to take on a new, younger opponent has really scrambled some of the 
 
 former president's calculations. His campaign is still far more professional than it was in 2016 and 2020. He has a vice presidential 
 
 nominee, J. D. Vance, who isn't very popular, but he's making some pretty direct and effective arguments on the economy.
 
The problem for the Trump campaign right now is Trump, he's not delivering a clear message. That was supposed, today, to be an event highlighting the 
 
 cost of groceries. He was at his golf club with a bunch of groceries all around him. It would have been much more effective if he was out there for 
 
 10 minutes, made his speech and then left. But now, he's talking about all of his obsessions, this has been going on for an hour and a half. It's very 
 
 undisciplined and I don't think it's really that effective.
 
KINKADE:  Yes, exactly. We're still looking at live pictures right now of Donald Trump in Bedminster, New Jersey now talking to some supporters 
 
 there. In terms of his economic policy, we have heard him -- it is no secret, obviously, that Trump wants to increase tariffs. He said, we're 
 
 going to have 10 percent to 20 percent tariffs on foreign countries that have been ripping us off for years. This is an increase from the 10 percent 
 
 tariffs that he'd already mentioned. And of course, leading economists have said that sort of a policy would certainly fuel inflation, right?
 
COLLINSON:  Yes, and Trump either deliberately or otherwise doesn't seem to really understand what the effect of tariffs is. He often complains that he 
 
 got billions of dollars from China because he hiked tariffs on Chinese goods. But what actually happened, and there have been academic studies 
 
 since his presidency that have proven this, is that the cost of those tariffs was handed on to consumers.
 
So, not only is this an inflationary issue, which could be a problem given the rises in the cost of living we've seen in recent years, which have now 
 
 mitigated, but it's not really sound economic policy. A lot of it is policy making for political reasons because he wants to stand up and be shown as 
 
 tough on China.
 
But if Trump does win a second term, a lot of economists think we could be in for a bunch of trade wars, not just with China but potentially with 
 
 Europe, and now, the partners. So, this is part of Donald Trump's economic pitch. He's saying he's going to do a lot of things, for example, slashing 
 
 the cost of electricity by 50 percent. He so far hasn't come up with any details about how exactly he would do it.
 
KINKADE:  All right. Stephen Collinson, we will continue this conversation again very soon. Good to have you with us. Thank you.
 
COLLINSON:  Thanks.
 
KINKADE:  Well, I want to turn to Doha now where a source says critical talks over a Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal have wrapped up for the day 
 
 and they will continue into Friday.
 
The White House says discussions got off to a promising start. Representatives from Israel, the U.S., Qatar, and Egypt are taking part. 
 
 Like previous negotiations, Hamas is not at the table but working through mediators.
 
And it comes as we learn that more than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the war broke out. That's according to the Gaza health 
 
 ministry, which operates under Hamas. The ministry doesn't distinguish between civilians and militants, but says most of the dead are women and 
 
 children. CNN can't independently verify those numbers.
 
Our Jeremy Diamond is following the developments and joins us from Haifa in Northern Israel. Good to have you with us, Jeremy. So, let's start on those 
 
 ceasefire talks because we know that they have been trying to hash out this three-phase plan that was on the table some two and a half months ago. What 
 
 are you hearing about the progress being made today and the fact that they are going to resume these talks tomorrow?
 <br>[18:15:00]
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT:  Well, perhaps the biggest indication that at least things are continuing, the most positive sign that 
 
 we can glean so far is the fact that these negotiations are going to continue tomorrow.
 
The Israeli delegation that flew to Doha, Qatar earlier on Thursday is remaining overnight and the negotiations are expected to resume on Friday 
 
 morning. We aren't getting many details from inside the room about the actual progress being made as both sides try and work towards a bridging 
 
 proposal effectively, one that could bridge the difference between Hamas' position on these talks and Israel's.
 
And that may be intentional in terms of the lack of details coming out. We have seen at various -- very sensitive points in these negotiations that 
 
 the key negotiators involved in this, the U.S. Egypt, and Qatar, are really trying to keep the details inside the room as they try and work through 
 
 these thorny issues, try and work through compromises and concessions that can be made.
 
Now, the Hamas officials who are in Doha, they are being updated by the mediators, by the Egyptians and the Qataris. So, even if they're not in the 
 
 room, they're still very much involved in the potential progress of these negotiations. But we still don't know to what extent they've actually 
 
 bridged the gaps on some of the key issues that remain.
 
Notably, for example, the Israeli prime minister's demands that he's been making over the course of the last month regarding Israeli troops retaining 
 
 control of the Philadelphia corridor, that border between Egypt and Gaza, as well as some kind of a security mechanism to prevent armed men to -- 
 
 from going to Northern Gaza from Southern Gaza during a ceasefire.
 
Now, one key indication that I think is important to note here is the fact that the prime minister who has been in the room throughout these 
 
 negotiations, he spoke on Thursday evening with the Iranian foreign minister, and that just tells you how closely linked these ongoing 
 
 ceasefire negotiations are to the future of what will happen in this region, as we have been on kind of a knife's edge over the course of the 
 
 last two weeks since the apparent Israeli assassination of Hamas' political leader in the Iranian capital, since Iran has been making these threats of 
 
 retaliation.
 
Tonight, the Qatari prime minister updating the Iranian foreign minister on these negotiations and speaking about, quote, tensions in the Middle East 
 
 according to the Qatari readout. I think that makes very clear that these ceasefire negotiations have wide-ranging implications in this region far 
 
 beyond Gaza. Lynda.
 
KINKADE:  Yes, they certainly do. Jeremy Diamond for us, good to have you on the story. We will talk again tomorrow. Thanks so much.
 
We have stunning new developments around the death of actor Matthew Perry. The U.S. attorney's office for the Central District of California says five 
 
 people have now been charged. Investigators uncovered an underground network of drug sellers and suppliers in Los Angeles.
 
Investigators allege the network is responsible for distributing ketamine, the drug that played a major role in Perry's death last year. The 
 
 defendants include two doctors, Perry's live-in personal assistant, and a woman authorities describe as, quote, the Ketamine Queen.
 
Our Nick Watt is in Los Angeles with more on this. So, it's quite incredible, Nick, to hear that among the five arrested, include two 
 
 doctors. We heard from the authorities in California a short time ago. What are they saying about those arrested?
 
NICK WATT, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, listen, you're right. You kind of expect somebody called the Ketamine Queen and another dealer to be 
 
 charged in a case like this. You do not expect a couple of doctors necessarily or Matthew Perry's long-term live-in assistant.
 
Now, what prosecutors say happened here is that Matthew Perry, who, listen, has been very upfront or was very upfront about his struggles with 
 
 addiction and mental health, he was seeking treatment in a clinic for anxiety and depression and they were prescribing him small levels of 
 
 ketamine. It's an anesthetic, but it's used more recently as a depression treatment.
 
He apparently got hooked on intravenous ketamine. He then asked his doctors in the clinic to up his dose. They refused. So, prosecutors say he then 
 
 went to some more unscrupulous doctors. Now, these two doctors allegedly were giving him ketamine with the help of his assistant. And the assistant, 
 
 who had no medical training, was allegedly injecting this into Matthew Perry. Apparently, he injected Perry a number of times on the day that 
 
 Perry died. And it was in fact that assistant who found Matthew Perry unresponsive in the hot tub. And, you know, the autopsy report says it was 
 
 the effect of ketamine and then drowning.
 <br>[18:20:00]
 
So, yes, it is kind of tragic that these doctors, this assistant who, you know, we're supposed to be really looking after Matthew Perry, we're 
 
 supposed to have his best interests at heart, but prosecutors say they were just trying to make as much money as they could out of the "Friend star." 
 
 Lynda.
 
KINKADE:  And talk to us about the evidence that they laid out, including some of the text messages that that they described.
 
WATT:  Yes. I mean, listen, you know, they found lots of ketamine apparently at the Queen of Ketamine's place. And then, these text messages 
 
 are tragic. So, these -- the first is between the two doctors. One doctor asks the other, I wonder how much this moron will pay? And allegedly, these 
 
 doctors were buying the ketamine for $12 a vial and selling it to Matthew Perry for $2,000.
 
Then, listen, after a while, apparently Matthew Perry realized this was kind of expensive and went to kind of more street level dealers. And there 
 
 was another text between the Queen, the Ketamine Queen, and this other dealer who's also been charged. Just after the news of Perry's death broke, 
 
 she allegedly texted, delete our messages.
 
Now, you know, Matthew Perry was obviously star of one of the biggest sitcoms of all time and also very well known for his struggles with mental 
 
 health and with substance abuse. And, you know, since he died, his co-stars have all come out and spoken really glowingly of him, you know, calling him 
 
 -- Courtney Cox called him, you know, one of the funniest men alive with a huge heart. But she said, yes, you know, he obviously had his struggles.
 
And here, when he was facing those struggles, according to prosecutors, people didn't help him, these five. They took advantage of him. Lynda.
 
KINKADE:  Yes. So, tragic. Nick Watt, good to have you on the story first. Thank you.
 
WATT:  Thanks.
 
KINKADE:  Well, still ahead, you're up to the minute weather forecast, including the typhoon that is heading towards Eastern Japan.
 
And it is nice work if you can get it. The new CEO of Starbucks is not only making a lot of money, he's also getting some eye-opening perks.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
KINKADE:  Welcome back. I'm Lynda Kinkade. Another day of solid gains on Wall Street tops today's Money Move. The major U.S. averages rallying 
 
 across the board with the NASDAQ up more than 2 percent. Thursday's rally follows the release of new U.S. economic data, that shows that it's easing 
 
 fears of a slowdown. 
 <br>[18:25:00]
 
New jobless claims fell for a second straight week and retail sales rose 1 percent from June, much better than expected. Retailing giant Walmart also 
 
 out with strong earnings in soothing words about the health of the U.S. consumer. Well, Asian stocks mostly higher after the release of a whole 
 
 slew of economic debt data there. And Japanese economic growth and Chinese retail sales both coming in stronger than expected.
 
Well, the incoming CEO of Starbucks will have his work cut out for him when he begins efforts to boost sluggish sales. But at least he will be very 
 
 well compensated. Starbucks revealing that Brian Niccol will receive a signing bonus of 10 million when he begins work next month. All that plus 
 
 an annual base salary of $1.6 million, much more than what he was getting as head of Chipotle. He'll also be eligible for huge stock incentives and 
 
 Starbucks will pay for his remote office in Southern California.
 
Professor Christopher Kayes is the chair of the management department at George Washington University. Good to have you with us.
 
CHRISTOPHER KAYES, PROFESSOR AND CHAIR, GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY, MANAGEMENT DEPARTMENT:  Good to be here. Thank you for having me.
 
KINKADE:  So, Chipotle CEO is set to take over Starbucks officially next month, and he is being lured with this massive pay packet that could top 
 
 $100 million in the first year. If the targets are met, and he doesn't even have to move to the headquarters where Starbucks is based in Seattle, 
 
 right?
 
KAYES:  Well, that's right. So, what we have here is the first remote work from home CEO, I think. He doesn't even have to move. He's got the -- I 
 
 think he lives in Newport. So, I think he's got that view of the water and he can keep that. So, that's just one of the many perks that he's going to 
 
 be getting. And of course, this amazing compensation package that puts him at the top ranks of all CEOs, no matter how big the company is. So, there's 
 
 a -- they've put a lot into attracting him to Starbucks. That's for sure.
 
KINKADE:  Yes, that's for sure. Of course, the outgoing CEO, Laxman Narasimhan, survived in the job for less than a year. And in that time, of 
 
 course, Starbucks shares had shed nearly 25 percent of their value. What contributed to that?
 
KAYES:  Well, Starbucks has had a lot of problems, and you can see this with the turnover in the leadership and the CEOs. Starbucks isn't the 
 
 Starbucks that you and I remember, at least I know from 20 years ago. I mean, today, Starbucks is a sort of middling kind of marketing place. It's 
 
 sort of like the Sears or the JCPenney's of coffee.
 
I mean, at the high end you have the hipsters who are going to local coffee houses and they're stunning Starbucks. And at the low end, you have people 
 
 that are going to their local gas stations and getting that caffeine jolt for a lot cheaper. So, Starbucks is kind of in the middle. So, they need to 
 
 figure out who they are as a brand.
 
They have labor problems. They have problems with the quality. They have problems with service. So, there's a lot of different things that this new 
 
 CEO is going to have to do. He's really going to have to earn that big paycheck, because it's not going to come easy like it did at Chipotle, 
 
 which is a lot smaller company. It was growing a lot faster. That's not the same that he's going to have when he's at Starbucks. That's for sure.
 
KINKADE:  And of course, under Niccol's leadership at Chipotle, Chipotle doubled its sales over the last five years. It's stocked more than tripled. 
 
 And before that he helped turn around the fortunes of Taco Bell. What do you think he will -- what will be his number one task when he takes the 
 
 job?
 
KAYES:  Well, Niccol is kind of like the Ryan Reynolds of the restaurant business. I mean, companies are willing to pay more to bring him on board, 
 
 but they expect him to deliver at the box office. And in Niccol's case, they're really going to expect him to bring in --you know, it's a pumpkin 
 
 spice latte season here in Washington, D.C. coming up. They're really going to expect him to increase, you know, sales. I think that's going to be a 
 
 big issue for him, and he's going to have to figure out how to bring those app purchases and those drive-thru people, those people that are buying 
 
 through the drive-thru, it's about 70 percent of Starbucks customers now are either doing it through the app or through the drive-thru.
 
So, he's really going to have to figure out how to capture those customers, how to improve the quality, how to improve the service. And at the same 
 
 time, he's probably going to have to contend with higher wages because the unions are really pushing Starbucks. The unions have pushed about 450 to 
 
 500 baristas cafes perhaps to increase -- to put in unions at about 500 cafes. So, he is got a big labor problem.
 
At Chipotle, he kind of squashed that, and he's known as being kind of a union buster because he prevented a lot of unionization at Chipotle. So, 
 
 that's going to be a big agenda.
 
But I'll tell you, I think his biggest problem is going to be Howard Schultz, the former CEO of Starbucks, who just can't seem to retire. I 
 
 mean, Schultz, still a major shareholder. He has the rights to review board decisions. He keeps -- he's been keeping his hands in Starbucks So, one of 
 
 the things that this new CEO is going to have to do is going to have to figure out, how do I keep Howard Schultz out of these day-to-day operations 
 
 and out of the strategy? Because that's one of the reasons that they've had this high turnover. I mean, they just have a huge succession problem at 
 
 Starbucks.
 <br>[18:30:00]
 
KINKADE:  Yes. As you say Starbucks is not what it used to be and there are a lot -- there's a lot of competition right now. A lot of little cafes 
 
 popping around the country. We will see how he goes in the next 12 months. Christopher Kayes of George Washington University, good to have you with 
 
 us. Thank you.
 
KAYES:  My pleasure.
 
KINKADE:  Well, in Japan, many flights and bullet train services are getting canceled as Typhoon Ampil gathers strength in the Pacific. And now, 
 
 it looks as though it may not make landfall, but there is still the risk of heavy rain and strong winds. So, let's go to Chad Myers. Chad, good to have 
 
 you with us. How are things looking right now?
 
CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  Well, even if the center of the eye doesn't make landfall, and the eye wall does, Lynda, that still is going to be a 
 
 very big problem there for -- from Tokyo eastward all the way to the coast. This is an equivalent of a Category 3 major hurricane in the Atlantic. We 
 
 don't give numbers to Pacific typhoons, but very, very close to Tokyo.
 
And not every little storm is going to stay in that window, in that cone. It could be wobbling a little bit to the left, even as we speak, that would 
 
 spell more wind for Tokyo for sure. Now, the coast is going to get lashed with gale force winds, probably typhoon force winds, a lot of wind and also 
 
 the waves along with it, maybe even a little bit of surge here coming in, but 150 to 200 millimeters of rainfall will not be welcome along that 
 
 coast. It's kind of a sharp little drop off right through there.
 
And again, a lot of rain for Tokyo. The wind will be howling through the buildings. Those skyscrapers kind of funneling into the wind tunnel 
 
 effects. So, even if we're only at it 100 kilometers per hour, that is going to be a very difficult day coming up here, because we're already, 
 
 what, 7:30 in the morning here, Tokyo time. And yes, typhoon winds do hit the Cape there, and eventually out to sea. But this is a pretty significant 
 
 event for Tokyo and for the eastern part of Japan.
 
Something else that's going to be an interesting part or maybe a dangerous part will be the Bermuda storm. We're talking here about Ernesto. This is 
 
 the storm that will likely approach Category 3, but may never make it, maybe somewhere around 110 miles per hour as it does approach Bermuda. But 
 
 if you're on their one side, which is the left side of the eye, then all of a sudden, it's not so bad. If you're on the right side of where the eye 
 
 passes, then the winds are added together, the forward momentum of the storm and the wind itself has to be added.
 
If you're on the over here on the west side, you can subtract that forward momentum. But you can see that there are plenty of areas there where the 
 
 wind continues to blow, at least gusts, at 100 miles per hour. So, yes, waves wind.
 
Now, Bermuda is a hurricane ready type of community. Don't get me wrong. These people know what they're doing. They don't really have to go to 
 
 shelters because their house is already a shelter. And if they know that it's not, then they do, because these things have been built to withstand 
 
 these type of storms for centuries, really. That's how long it's been there. And this concrete block, poured concrete buildings are going to have 
 
 to take a pounding, going to have to take a beating here because there you see where the winds and the waves are.
 
We're probably going to see even waves along the East Coast of the U S at 10 feet. More than three meters along the coast this weekend. Going to have 
 
 to keep your children out of the waves because it could be a significant wind event. And also, storm surge event or even at least tidal, coastal 
 
 tidal possibly pulling you back out into the ocean every time big waves come. Never turn your back on the ocean.
 
We're still watching this. This is the most important thing right now at this point in time, because we're going to make close approach in probably 
 
 less than 12 hours. Lynda.
 
KINKADE:  Wow. All right. We will check in with you again tomorrow. Chad Myers, good to have you with us. Thanks.
 
Well, still to come, Taylor Swift fans are showing up in full force as the singer's massively popular Eras Tour continues in London. And that's 
 
 despite some serious security concerns after a terrorist plot in Austria. More on that after the break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:35:00]
 
KINKADE:  Welcome back to "First Move." I'm Lynda Kinkade with a look at more international headlines this hour. Marches and vigils were held across 
 
 India to protest the rape and murder of a 31-year-old doctor. She was found dead last Friday at the medical college where she was training. She had 
 
 been sleeping in a seminar room after a 36-hour shift. A police volunteer has been arrested in connection to her death.
 
The president of Columbia University has announced her resignation following criticism of her handling of the Gaza war protests on the New 
 
 York campus this past spring. Minouche Shafik says the turmoil took a toll on her family and says her resignation will help Columbia heal. She is now 
 
 the third Ivy League president to step down over the Israel-Hamas War protests.
 
Taylor Swift took to the stage in London Thursday evening. This is the latest stop in her massively popular Eras Tour, and her first since police 
 
 foiled a terror plot in Austria. Three teenagers have been detained and they're suspected of planning a suicide attack.
 
Swift had cancelled her shows in Austria, disappointing fans who had travelled from abroad. But security concerns haven't stopped the London 
 
 Swifties from showing up in full force. U.K. police saying ahead of Thursday's concert that they were, quote, well prepared for the event.
 
Salma Abdelaziz caught up with some of the fans in London ahead of the concert.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Thousands of Swifties are preparing for five Taylor Swift concerts set to take place at Wembley Stadium here in 
 
 London. Of course, security, safety is top of mind after what occurred in Vienna last week. Their authorities say they foiled a suspected terror 
 
 plot.
 
Now, the security scare did lead to the cancellation of the three Taylor Swift concerts that were set to take place in Vienna. Here in London, of 
 
 course, fans say security is a concern, but they wanted to go ahead and show their love for Taylor Swift.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Wembley as an organization were fantastic. They e- mailed fans within a couple of days with revised security notes. We're fortunate enough we'd been in June. So, we kind of knew what to expect and 
 
 we felt really safe then. There was definite apprehension, but going into it, I think the overriding feeling was let's come together, let's be 
 
 together, and have a good evening.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  And we read the news and it was disconcerting, but we really wanted to be here and I think they've taken precautions and my 
 
 sister reassured me.
 
ABDELAZIZ:  And, Grace, how did you feel? I know your mom read you the news report. You were aware. How did you feel coming here today?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I felt like a little nervous, but mostly so excited to see Taylor Swift.
 <br>[18:40:00]
 
ABDELAZIZ:  Now, one of the restrictions that is in place is that no one can congregate outside of Wembley Stadium. That's why you see these fans 
 
 just moving on rather quickly. Only ticket holders have been asked to come to the stadium. Non-ticket holders have been told, please don't come here 
 
 by the authorities.
 
Again, this is going to be a huge welcome on that stage for Taylor Swift. Many of these Swifties say that it's an opportunity to re-establish that 
 
 safe space for fans.

KINKADE:  Well, still to come, the U.S. men's soccer team has reportedly found its next head coach. As the team looks to rebound from its Copa 
 
 America embarrassment, that next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
KINKADE:  Welcome back with U.S. man's national soccer team is reportedly close to signing a new coach. Multiple outlets say Mauricio Pochettino has 
 
 accepted the job. The 52-year-old Argentinian has a wealth of top-level experience. Most recently, he was at the helm of Chelsea in the English 
 
 Premier League. Patrick Snell is here with more details. So, exciting news. What can we expect from him?
 
PATRICK SNELL, CNN WORLD SPORT:  Hi, Lynda. Yes, multiple reports on Thursday here in the United States. Mauricio Pochettino is to become the 
 
 new head coach of America's men's team. It's not a done deal at this point. So, we are tracking it very closely indeed. He's highly sought after. One 
 
 of the best technical coaches in the world from Argentina, and this would be a major coup for the U.S. Soccer Federation, no question about that, if 
 
 it were to go through and everything goes through smoothly.
 
Pochettino managed English Premier League club side Tottenham, taking them to the Champions League final in 2019. They lost that one to Liverpool. The 
 
 South American manager did have success, though, Lynda, in France, with Paris Saint Germain, one of the Liga crowned, coaching Lionel Messi as well 
 
 at one point. Won the Coupe de France as well before his most recent move to Chelsea where he oversaw one season at Stamford Bridge.
 
Big challenges ahead for him. No question. He's going to be tasked with guiding the U.S. team at a World Cup on home soil in 2026. Now, just a bit 
 
 of background, a bit of context there. U.S. soccer had previously tried reportedly again to tempt Jurgen Klopp, the now former Liverpool head 
 
 coach, into an early return to management, but then they focused on Pochettino after Klopp made it very clear he wanted to remain on his career 
 
 break.
 <br>[18:45:00]
 
His first international post having also been previously managing Espanol in Spain, Southampton, as I mentioned, Paris Saint Germain, and Chelsea. 
 
 Interesting as to where he's going to be based for this post, Lynda. You would think the positioning would be required of being in the U.S. But, you 
 
 know, not necessarily because, you know, a lot of his U.S.-based players there in Europe, they play their club footy in Europe, stars like Christian 
 
 Pulisic, Western McKinney, Gio Reyna, all wonderfully talented players playing their trade at the -- very applying their trade at the very highest 
 
 level in Europe.
 
So, it's going to be very interesting to see where he does base his time. Part of the job, if you're a national team head coach, is to be at the 
 
 matches week in week out following the progress of your star players. As I say, many of those talented youngsters are playing their highest football 
 
 level in Europe. So, it's going to be very interesting to see what happens.
 
We'll pick up on the Chelsea parallel here, because Chelsea provided the U.S. with a women's head coach, Emma Hayes. Emma Hayes has just taken over 
 
 as the U.S. women's national team head coach from Chelsea. So, you've got another former Chelsea manager. And of course, Hayes has had huge success, 
 
 this past weekend, in fact, when she led the U.S. team to Olympic gold medal as well in France. Hayes, of course, only taking over the job a 
 
 number of weeks ago.
 
But there's a big, big challenge ahead. You referenced it in your lead in, America had a really, really substandard showing at the recent Copa America 
 
 that was played over here in the United States. They were eliminated in the group stages, and that really put all the pressure on Gregg Berhalter, the 
 
 previous incumbent. And he now parted ways. Pochettino reportedly is on the brink of this deal. We'll see. As I say, it's not a done deal at this 
 
 point, and we'll continue to monitor it.
 
But the U.S. men's team forever in the shadow of the women's team. Women's team, of course, the Americans multiple World Cup winners over the years, 
 
 Olympic titles as well. I remember I covered the 2002 World Cup in Asia when the men's team got to the quarterfinals, Lynda, of that particular 
 
 tournament. They got to the last date in 2002 when it was played in South Korea and Japan. And everyone thought at that point, this is it. This is 
 
 the breakthrough. We're going to build on this and we're going to take the men's team to new heights. Well, they've never reached the last eight since 
 
 that tournament.
 
If Pochettino does take the job, Lynda, there's a huge amount of pressure on him. He's got to get it right, especially after the woeful Copa America.
 
KINKADE:  Exactly. But it's interesting you said you're not sure where he will be based for this job if indeed, he does take it. We were speaking 
 
 earlier in the show about the fact that the new Starbucks CEO wants to do the job remotely. And I understand it sounds like this new coach, if he is 
 
 indeed the coach, wants to also do the job remotely. We'll see how this turns out.
 
SNELL:  Yes, we'll see.
 
KINKADE:  Good to see have you with us. Patrick Snell.
 
SNELL:  Very interesting times. Thanks, Lynda.
 
KINKADE:  Thanks. Well, still to come after the break, skin cancer rates are on the rise. One cancer fighting teen is looking to stop that. His 
 
 latest invention is getting noticed. That story next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:50:00]
 
KINKADE:  Well, this just in, an update on one of our top stories today. Dr. Salvador Plasencia is one of five people charged in connection with the 
 
 death of Matthew Perry. He has pleaded not guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute ketamine. He was held on a $100,000 bond and has 
 
 surrendered his DEA license, which allowed him to prescribe controlled substances. His trial is set for October 8th, and he is one of five 
 
 defendants in that case.
 
Well, skin cancer remains a global public health threat, and despite more people slathering on sunscreen than ever before, skin cancer rates continue 
 
 to rise. Now, one precocious teenager is joining the fight. Heman Bekele is a 15-year-old already getting recognition for inventing a soap that could 
 
 treat cancer, and he's just been honored by Time Magazine, which named him the 2024 Kid of the Year.
 
Well, I'm joined now by Heman Bekele. Good to have you with us. Congratulations. You are the 2024 Time Magazine Kid of the Year. How do you 
 
 feel about that honor?
 
HEMAN BEKELE:  It is an absolutely surreal feeling. First of all, of course, thank you so much for having me. But yes, it feels so great. I 
 
 mean, of course, I feel really happy and gratified for this experience. But then, in addition to that, I also feel really inspired and motivated. 
 
 Because, you know, I'm just 15 years old, and this experience does show that as young as you are, your ideas can still be heard. And so, it is 
 
 really motivating, and will keep motivating me pushing forward as well.
 
KINKADE:  So, Heman, talk to us about your invention. This is a soap, a bar of soap that could in the future be a new and affordable treatment for skin 
 
 cancer, including melanoma, I understand. Tell us about it.
 
BEKELE:  Yes. So, SCTS, pretty much stands for skin cancer treating soap, and that's the name of the bar of soap. Pretty much the way that it works 
 
 is it uses this drug called Imiquimod, and it wraps it around these lipid- based nanoparticles. And so, without getting too in depth into all the science behind it, I guess the main point with this bar of soap is -- like 
 
 you said, it's a more affordable and accessible alternative to modern day skin cancer treatment. And that's what I was really aiming at doing by 
 
 creating SCTS.
 
KINKADE:  And this skin cancer, of course, is a huge issue. We know in the U.S. more people are diagnosed with skin cancer than all the other cancers 
 
 combined every year. And in my home country of Australia, skin cancer rates are the highest in the world. Most people in my family, grandparents, and 
 
 parents have had some form of skin cancer or melanoma. What prompted you to research and develop a soap that could treat skin cancer?
 
BEKELE:  That's a great question. My main inspiration for creating skin cancer treating soap was really growing up in Ethiopia. I was born in 
 
 Ethiopia and I saw so many people that were working really long hours under the hot sun and of course, I didn't think that much of it at a really young 
 
 age. But now, that I've grown up and kind of realized the damages and the consequences of U.V. radiation for such long periods of time, I was really 
 
 inspired to take action, not only to create a form of treatment, but also to make it affordable and accessible so that everybody could use it
 
KINKADE:  And talk to us about how you started developing this soap and how it's changed when you became a finalist in the competition and when it 
 
 could come to market?
 
BEKELE:  So, I first started making SCTS, it's been -- it's crazy, almost two and a half years since it first came to life and it's -- I gradually 
 
 progressed to the point where it is now -- for example, last summer, I was working at Johns Hopkins to kind of test the bar of soap on mice.
 
And so, right now, it's at a point where it's continuing to be tested. I'm really excited to see its future. But my hope, my goal is that within the 
 
 next five years we can turn SCTS from a simple passion project into more of a nonprofit organization where, you know, coming full circle to the initial 
 
 inspiration of giving an impact and an affordable and accessible manner, using that nonprofit to be able to distribute the bar of soap to people 
 
 that need it the most. People in third world countries that really can't afford super expensive skin cancer treatment.
 
KINKADE:  It's just incredible. And you, of course, 15 years old, Heman. What does the future have in store for you? What do you see yourself doing 
 
 it for a career?
 
BEKELE:  I mean, I'm really passionate about innovation and, you know, the whole process of bringing something from concept all the way to reality. 
 
 So, while I'm not sure what in specific I want to pursue in the future, I do know it has something to do along those lines of, you know, innovation, 
 
 creativity, being able to kind of build-up on my own ideas.
 <br>[18:55:00]
 
KINKADE:  Heman Bekele, great to have you. The 2024 Time Kid of the Year. Really impressive work. Huge congratulations and for joining us.
 
BEKELE:  Thank you so much for having me.
 
KINKADE:  Quite remarkable. Well, finally on "First Move," what do you get when you cross a bit of uptown funk with some bad romance? Well, you get a 
 
 pop super duet in the form of Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars. They're coming together for "Die With a Smile," a brand new single and video that will be 
 
 released in the next few hours.
 
We don't know much about the song, but judging by these outfits, we wouldn't be surprised if it had a bit of a country feel to it. Especially 
 
 given the recent success of Beyonce's "Cowboy Carter." This is the first time that Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars have released music as lead artists in 
 
 years that they have been busy with collaborators and collaborations.
 
And of course, we will see Lady Gaga on the big screen in just a couple of months as Harley Quinn in the Joker sequel.
 
Well, that just about wraps up our show. I'm Lynda Kinkade. Thanks so much for joining us. Julia, we'll be back tomorrow. Good night.
