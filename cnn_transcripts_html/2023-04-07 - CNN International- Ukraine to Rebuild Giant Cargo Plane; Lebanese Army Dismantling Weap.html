MAX FOSTER, CNN HOST: Hello and welcome to CNN "Newsroom", I'm Max Foster in London. Just ahead head a dangerous escalation of tensions. The Israeli Military has carried out airstrikes on what it says are targets belonging to Hamas militants in Gaza and Southern Lebanon.
 
Then French President Emmanuel Macron is wrapping up a high stakes visit to China. But upon his return to France, you'll have to deal with the aftermath of another violent day of protests. And the symbol of Ukrainian pride, a giant cargo plane was destroyed by Russian troops in the first hours of the war, the Ukraine vows it will fly again.
 
Israel has ordered the mobilization of its reserve forces amid rising tensions. It came hours after Israel conducted airstrikes against targets in Southern Lebanon and in Gaza. Israeli forces say they struck Hamas sites including weapons, manufacturing facilities, and tunnel infrastructure.
 
In retaliation for a barrage of rocket fire, which hit Israeli territory on Thursday? In these images from Gaza, you can see damage to buildings and cars. The Palestinian Ministry of Health however, says that the Children's Hospital was also held hit. They flare up in hostilities during a religious holiday period is understandably worrying those on the ground.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I hope there won't be a war because many people depend on Ramadan in the holiday season to earn a livelihood. I hope there will not be a war.

FOSTER: Well, Hadas Gold is near the Israeli Lebanese border. I mean, the fact that it stretched into Lebanon was a worrying new development. HADAS GOLD, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT: It was an incredibly worrying development, you can actually see the border with Lebanon, and it's on the hill, just behind me. And despite those Israeli airstrikes in Southern Lebanon, in the early hours of this morning, since then, it's been a tense, calm here; life is going on as normal.
 
Although the airspace is still closed up here for civilian aircraft, the Israeli Military saying that it struck what made took pains to point out where Palestinian targets in Southern Lebanon and from what we understand these were in open areas, and they were no injuries reported in Southern Lebanon.
 
It's important to distinguish that the Israeli Military is not saying or targeting Hezbollah as part of these airstrikes, because that could really tip the situation over into something so much bigger and so much more dangerous. And in fact, most we have been hearing from the Lebanese Prime Minister as well from the Israeli Military, both saying that they have no interest in escalating this further.
 
And so far, Hezbollah has not denied or taken responsibility for any part of those more than 30 rockets that were fired into Israeli territory yesterday. Most of the action has actually been over Gaza, because Israel is again, pointing the finger at Palestinian militant groups like Hamas, like Palestinian Islamic Jihad.
 
The Israeli military, launching airstrikes against Hamas targets it said in Gaza, including what they said were tunnels, weapons, manufacturing sites, militants, they're firing more than 40 rockets back towards Israel in response. But again, thankfully, no injuries reported on either side, although, as you noted, there have been damages on both sides, including to a pediatric hospital in Gaza.
 
Meantime, though, in the occupied West Bank, two Israeli women were shot and killed a third actually their mother was shot and critically injured in the occupied West Bank while they were driving in their car. This is just going to show you the multiple fronts that are ongoing here and how the situation of one event in one place can very quickly escalate and turn this into something so much bigger than it already is.
 
But for right now, it's been a tense come up here. We have not seen any response from militants in Lebanon in reaction to their airstrikes. As of right now, although we do know that the Israeli Air Force has called up its reservists. It seems to be more of a precautionary measure than any sort of indication that something bigger may be taking place, Max.
 
FOSTER: Hadas Gold in Lebanon border, thank you. Lebanese Security Officials tell CNN Israeli airstrikes in Southern Lebanon hit militia targets and weapons stores used by armed groups. Earlier the Lebanese military showed these pictures showing launchers and unused rockets discovered near the border are now dismantling those weapons.
 
CNN's Scott McLean joins us from the Lebanese capital Beirut. Just take us through these images and what we learned from them, Scott? SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Look, Max from the pictures that we've seen so far. The targets that were actually hit by the Israelis looked pretty benign. They looked pretty uninteresting. Frankly, we're talking about an electrical transformer.
 <br>[08:05:00]
 
We're talking about some buildings and cars affected again in this rural area about 10 miles north of the border with Israel. We are also talking about a crater that was left in an agricultural field in a farmer's field that actually jolted awake some nearby farm workers who were staying in a building nearby, the force nearby collapsing part of their roof.
 
But a Lebanese Security Source has told our team here in Beirut that look; those sites may have looked benign. They may have looked like they were wider out in the open as Hadas described them. But these were targets, where there was weaponry, where there was Lebanese militia presence there.
 
And so that same source said that, look, the Lebanese military is actively trying to prevent another round of attacks from going towards Israel. And so this is very much become sort of an internal challenge for the Lebanese military to try to control some of these Palestinian linked militia groups.
 
But there is some concern that of course, this could still escalate a concern that is shared by the United Nations that says that this back and forth across the border that we've seen over the last 24 or so hours really risks escalating into a much wider conflict. And so while there has been, of course, over the past few years, some strikes across the border here and there.
 
This is by far the most significant that we've seen in a very long time, at least in terms of volume of projectiles flying across that border. The Lebanese Prime Minister says that, look; his country should not be used as a launch pad to launch rockets at Israel. They are looking actively he says to try to track down the perpetrators of that initial rocket launch.
 
As Hadas pointed out as well, the Israelis are going to pains it seems to differentiate these Palestinian militant groups with Hezbollah because of course they view them as a much bigger threat. In fact, they believe that there are hundreds, perhaps thousands of rockets that are in Southern Lebanon that Hezbollah has stashed all over, that are within range of Israel.
 
Though, Israel also says that look, while Hezbollah may not have been firing these rocket launchers, they have huge influence over the Southern part of this country. And so they do bear some level of responsibility because they think that they ought to have known or they very likely knew that this was happening right under their noses, Max.
 
FOSTER: OK, Scott in Beirut, thank you. Now Russia may be gaining the upper hand in one of the fiercest most highly contested battles in its war on Ukraine. British intelligence says Moscow's forces have likely entered the center of Bakhmut and are now threatening a key supply routes.
 
On Thursday, Ukraine's General Staff said the besieged Eastern city remains at the epicenter of fighting. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh joins me live from Kyiv. How would you assess the situation there, Nick?
 
NICK PATON WALSH, CNN INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: I mean, clearly, this has been the front line grind for months now. The key battle that Russia states will be a symbolic victory for it partially something that mercenary leader Prigozhin tried to accomplish with his Wagner units.
 
Now they appear to have been assisted more and working according to this same British intelligence report in greater harmony with traditional Russian Military to try and move further into the center intense fighting now street by street, some of it around the railway station in the city center.
 
And quite clearly, now Ukraine has been pushed to the west side of that city, yet they are still holding on. And Moscow's major issue here is it as long said how this will be a vital victory for them, it has failed to pull that off so far. The limited strategic value of Bakhmut has long been talked about as well.
 
So essentially, even if we do see Russian forces, take control of large parts of the west of the city even possibly threaten the supply route that Ukrainian forces still have to resupply, what remains of their troops inside the city. Even that victory itself will be of questionable games, potentially enabling Russia to move into other parts of the Donbas they seek as well.
 
But it does appear, according to this British intelligence report that they think Russia may be getting some momentum here, but that is after months of stalling possibly thousands of lives lost here. And the broader question too, if you step back from the sort of micro assessment of street by street fighting in Bakhmut.
 
Ukraine's managed to tie Russian forces down in achieving this victory that they wanted to be so symbolic for them for months, and that potentially some will argue has enabled Ukraine separately to focus on the larger counter offensive that may be days, maybe weeks away from now.
 
Long talked about in Ukrainian and other circles too, as a decisive moment potentially, in this war, but it does appear as of today that the battle in Bakhmut is gently possibly edging in Russia's favor has reversed in times past though as well. And each month this continues to grind on it's a greater drain on Russia's already depleted resources, Max.
 
FOSTER: OK, Nick in the Ukrainian capital, thank you.
 <br>[08:10:00]
 
China announcing sanctions against two American organizations for hosting the Taiwanese Leader during her brief stopovers in the U.S. China loudly condemned Wednesday's meeting between President Tsai Ing- wen and U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in California in retaliation.
 
China said it was sanctioning the Reagan Library where Tsai and McCarthy met. The other sanctions target was the Hudson Institute, which gave Tsai an award while she was in New York. Here's what the Chinese Foreign Ministry had to say.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MAO NING, CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESPERSON: China will take resolute and strong measures to firmly defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: Taiwan's Foreign Ministry responded quickly calling China's sanctions irrational and absurd. Meanwhile, President Tsai is returning home at the same time, a bipartisan congressional delegation is in Taipei being led by U.S. House Foreign Affairs Chairman Mike McCaul. McCaul warned China that it should think twice before considering an invasion of Taiwan.
 
Now French President Emmanuel Macron is nearing the end of his three- day state visit to China, with war in Ukraine topping the agenda. Earlier he traveled to the Southern City of Guangzhou, where he was met by hundreds of students at the University.
 
Mr. Macron later had dinner with President Xi, and soon he is expected to meet with Chinese investors before heading home. CNN's Marc Stewart joins us from Tokyo. Was Ukraine at the top of the agenda? Did Macron get what he wanted?
 
MARC STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Oh, hi there, Max. This was a visit that was really based on two concepts, one diplomacy and two deal making. Let's first talk about diplomacy, no wholesale shift in position from China. In fact, both sides really held firm with France, blaming Russia and its invasion of Ukraine for really disrupting the peace and stability in Europe, and no condemnation by President Xi of Russia for its invasion.
 
However, French diplomatic sources tell us that President Xi has expressed interest he said he would take a call between he and Volodymyr Zelenskyy when the time is right. So that's where things stand on the diplomatic front and then there is this issue of deal- making.
 
President Macron did not travel to China by himself. He brought with him a delegation of about 50 French business people. Late tonight we can confirm that France and Chinese Shipbuilding Company have now agreed to a multi-billion-dollar deal. So that is significant as both economies try to rebound post pandemic.
 
In addition, you mentioned that visit to Guangzhou a chance for President Macron to see the manufacturing might of China. This is a visit that was billed by the French as one for conversation and discussion. And Max, that seems to be the tone that has held through all of this.
 
FOSTER: OK, Marc in Tokyo, thank you. France picking up the pieces yet again after another day of nationwide protests against pension reform protesters clashed with police in Paris on Thursday nationwide, more than 150 police officers were injured. France is bracing for more protests next Thursday, a day before the Constitutional Council will roll on the government's pension reform law. One union leader had this to say about it.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SOPHIE BINET, GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE CGT: Today, wanting to force through this reform creates chaos. Emmanuel Macron was the President of the rich and now he is the President of chaos. And so I think that the wisdom of the Constitutional Council should be to do what the head of state obviously refuses to do. That is to say to consider that in order to move on for the country to start to run against serenely, the reform must be withdrawn. There was no other way out than that.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: Nada Bashir joining us live from Paris. Really dramatic pictures last night Macron's favorite restaurant burning down at one point according to the pictures, it wasn't that bad. But the images were very strong, weren't they?
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER: Yes, hugely dramatic images. Although it has to be said that the number of protesters showing up to take part in what was the 11th day of demonstrations since the beginning of this movement back in January has begun to dwindle though around half a million people took to the streets across France.
 
According to the country's interior ministry, we certainly saw those dramatic scenes of protesters throwing smoke bombs and paint towards the heavily mobilized riot police here in Paris. We even saw around 100 protesters and union members storming the U.S. investment firm Black Rocks building here in Paris.
 
We waving red flags, and again throwing painted smoke bombs within the building. So it has been a dramatic scene, of course, there has been efforts by the unions to come to some sort of agreement with the government. We saw on Wednesday, the Prime Minister and other government members meeting with the heads of 8 of the largest unions here in France.
 <br>[08:15:00]
 
They weren't able to come to any sort of resolution the government refusing to budge from its position. Of course, as you mentioned there we are expecting next week to see Frances Constitutional Council coming to a decision on the constitutionality of this legislation which will see the retirement age raise from 62 to 64.
 
And hold of that decision by the Constitutional Council on next Friday. We are expecting to see once again thousands of protesters taking to the streets. This will be essentially their final chance to have their voices heard to make their voices heard ahead of that decision by the Constitutional Council.
 
We are expecting to see a huge numbers of people taking to the streets and of course there is anticipation that beats once again could turn violent as we have seen in the past. And of course, the police here in Paris have taken stringent measures to ensure that they aren't keeping order.
 
Have to stay today on Friday, the cleanup operation has been quite swift and we aren't seeing any other signs of demonstrations are taking place. But of course we can anticipate that there will be a heavy police presence once again next Thursday, Max.
 
FOSTER: OK, Nada, thank you for that. Still to come, the U.S. President Joe Biden prepares to head to Northern Ireland ahead of the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement. Officials are warning about possible disorder details coming up.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: U.S. President Joe Biden is preparing to visit Belfast next week to mark the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement a peace deal that brought stability and hope after decades of sectarian violence also known as the Troubles in Northern Ireland and that cost of the lives of more than 3500 people last week.
 
The British Security Service raise the terrorism threat level in Northern Ireland from substantial to severe and Northern Ireland police say they are deploying a significant policing operation to combat dissident Republican disorder over the Easter weekend.
 
The Biden administration is blaming conditions created by Donald Trump for the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. A report summary released on Thursday doesn't admit any mistakes and says President Biden followed his military leaders' recommendations as CNN's Natasha Bertrand reports.
 
NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTER: The White House said on Thursday that it would be transmitting to certain congressional committees a long awaited after action report outlining lessons learned from the lead up to the withdrawal of Afghanistan and of course the aftermath as well as that abrogate bombing that took the lives of 13 U.S. service members as that very chaotic evacuation was taking place.
 
Now this report is classified and members of Congress are going to be able to read a hard copy of it. But they of course will not be able to disseminate it widely. However, the White House is kind of getting out ahead of this and they release their own summary of their perspectives of the lead up to the withdrawal and the lessons that they believe the administration has learned since.
 <br>[08:20:00] Namely among those lessons, are the fact that they will now begin evacuations much sooner than they did with Afghanistan. They say that they delayed those evacuations, essentially, because they did not want the world to lose confidence in the Afghan government and for the Afghan government to collapse.
 
Well, now they say that they're prioritizing faster evacuations and they're also working more aggressively to communicate the risks to Americans who may be in these situations where the security environment is deteriorating very rapidly, as we saw with that rapid Taliban takeover in Afghanistan.
 
So while the White House says that they will be taking these lessons learned and applying them elsewhere, they also are arguing very fervently that this was a bad hand that was dealt to them by the Trump administration.
 
And they say that everything that they did was really a reaction to deals that President Trump made with the Taliban that forced the Americans to withdraw from Afghanistan reduce their presence there and thereby leave the Afghan government and the Americans in country a lot weaker.
 
That is the argument the White House is making. Obviously, this after action report, going to Congress they will remain classified. But it remains to be seen of course, whether any of this will be made public for now, however, the administration really pointing the finger back at their predecessors. Natasha Bertrand CNN at the Pentagon.
 
FOSTER: After the break, a major symbol of pride for Ukraine is now lies in ruin. I will tell you about the plans for the massive cargo plane back in the skies.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: The Antonov An-225 cargo plane affectionately known as the Mriya was the pride of Ukraine. It was destroyed last year during Russia's invasion when it flew. It was the world's heaviest plane and one of a kind with a huge following from aviation enthusiasts. Now Ukraine is vowing to rebuild it. David McKenzie reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): The first hours of the war rationally elite forces descending on customer, airport outside Kyiv. Their intended launch pad to the Capitol, it didn't work out. Ukrainian forces famously pushed the Russians back and they made a discovery at Hostomel. The pride of Ukraine the remarkable An-225 or Mriya cargo plane got it in the fighting.
 
YEVHEN BASHYNSKY, PILOT AT ANTONOV COMPANY: You know it was feeling like you're a part of something great.

MCKENZIE (voice over): The Ukrainian Antonov Company says it wants to rebuild this one of a kind giant, no matter what it takes. Designer Valarie Castillo says they've already retrieved much of what they can use.
 
MCKENZIE (on camera): You can feel the extraordinary size of this plane inside the fuselage Mriya was the heaviest plane in the world and it could carry up to 250 tons inside or even on top.
 <br>[08:25:00]
 
MCKENZIE (voice over): Designed to transport this Soviet Era Buran spacecraft. The Antonov Company refurbished the Mriya multiple times with 6 turbofan engines each with more than 50,000 pounds of thrust and a 32-wheel landing gear system. The Mriya was a marvel an outsized hit with plane spotters and aviation enthusiasts.
 
MCKENZIE (on camera): When you were flying this plane, so many people wanted to take photos of it, follow it. What was that like?
 
BASHYNSKY: I was feeling great responsibility. A lot on to operate this plane properly, correctly it was also a great responsibility because you're attracting a lot of attention a few days after, you can open the YouTube and see all what have you done.
 
MCKENZIE (voice over): But to put Mriya back in the sky, the Antonov Company says it could cost nearly a billion dollars and take years. But for Ukrainians, it's a point of pride David McKenzie, CNN Kyiv, Ukraine.
