COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: Hello, and welcome. I`m Coy. This is CNN 10, where I tell you the what, letting you decide what to think.
 
Happy Friday, Eve. Hope you have a thirst for knowledge this fine Thursday because we`re going to serve up a whole bunch of it. Let`s get you your 
 
 news.
 
We start today`s show on campus at the University of California, Los Angeles, or UCLA, where violent confrontations broke out between pro-
 
 Palestinian and pro-Israeli protesters overnight on Tuesday. The skirmishes happened hours after UCLA`s leader, Chancellor Gene Block, called a pro-
 
 Palestinian encampment on campus unlawful and threatened students with suspension or expulsion if they did not disperse. 
 
Fireworks were fired at the encampment built by pro-Palestinian protesters, and both sides fired tear gas or other gas irritants at each other, 
 
 according to the Daily Bruin, the UCLA student newspaper.
 
Now, people were also attacked, and objects were thrown at each side. Early Wednesday morning, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass posted on X that the Los 
 
 Angeles Police Department, or LAPD, was on campus to stop the unrest. Mayor Bass also calling the violence abhorrent, meaning horrible, repulsive, or 
 
 offensive.
 
The violence at UCLA came hours after Columbia University called the NYPD to clear out student protesters who had taken control of a building on 
 
 campus in New York City. 
 
In total, more than 300 people were arrested on Tuesday night at Columbia and a few blocks north at City College of New York. CNN`s Miguel Marquez 
 
 takes us on the ground on Manhattan`s Upper West Side to show us the aftermath.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MIGUEL MARQUEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: So, New York police officers moved in, in the hundreds into Columbia University. They were -- they were not in 
 
 full tactical gear, but they did have helmets and batons, and they moved in on this street. This is 114th Street in Amsterdam right here. They moved 
 
 in, in very large numbers onto the campus through a single gate on 114th Street. 
 
You can still see one bus down there. That bus is taking whoever is left to arrest. We saw dozens of people arrested that were brought out through a 
 
 separate gate here on 114th. But the hall that had been taken over by students, Hamilton Hall, is just up the Amsterdam Avenue here. 
 
Police were able to get into it using a bearcats. They were lifted up to the second floor. They used flashbang grenades to sort of distract whoever 
 
 was inside Hamilton Hall. And then they were able to get in. They said that the individuals in there had barricaded the doors with everything from 
 
 chairs and tables to soda machines. And there weren`t many people in there.
 
Police now say it is done, that everybody that was on the encampment for the last two weeks has been moved out or arrested, that everybody that was 
 
 in the hall has been either moved out or arrested, and that the entire campus, there was nobody on the Columbia campus that shouldn`t be there at 
 
 this point, say, New York police officers. 
 
The Columbia University has also asked the NYPD to keep a presence on the university through May 17th. The commencement is on May 15th, so it is 
 
 clear that Columbia doesn`t want to have a repeat of what happened a couple of weeks ago when they cleared the campus once and the encampment 
 
 reestablished itself. This time, they want to get back to the business of being a university.

WIRE: Ten second trivia. 
 
In the game of poker, what term is used to describe the combination of cards a player holds? 
 
Deck, flop, bridge, hand. 
 
If you said hand, got to hand it to you, you are correct. Did you know that your two hands make up more than a quarter of all the bones in your body? 
 
 All right, we all know that washing our hands is important, and that is particularly true if you`re a chef or another restaurant worker handling 
 
 food, right? But according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, only one out of every three food workers wash their 
 
 hands like they should. That`s not just gross, it`s dangerous, and possibly quite literally sickening. That could lead to the outbreak of foodborne 
 
 illnesses like norovirus, salmonella, and E. coli.
 
But as you`ll see in this CNN report, a new startup in New York has a potential solution.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
RAFAEL BUTLER, DIRECTOR, FOOD SAFETY, JUST SALAD: Not having clean hands could lead to crock contamination, could lead to illness, could lead to an 
 
 employee getting sick.
 
CLARE DUFFY, CNN BUSINESS WRITER: We`ve all seen these signs in restaurants telling employees to wash their hands, but is the person making your food 
 
 actually doing that? It`s an important question, not just for the customers but for the business too. After all, dirty hands touching food can lead to 
 
 food-related illnesses, forcing a restaurant to shut down temporarily or even for good.
 
CHRISTINE SCHINDLER, CEO, PATHSPOT: I think that, especially in today`s world, the heightened awareness on why contamination is present in our 
 
 world and our own personal objectives as well as responsibility in stopping the spread of illness is more apparent than ever.
 
DUFFY: Here at Just Salad, a restaurant with more than 80 franchises, the company showed CNN how it`s implementing food safety technology that it 
 
 hopes will lower the risk of foodborne illnesses such as E. coli, norovirus, and salmonella. 
 
One of its new tools is this hand scanner developed by New York-based PathSpot. The device scans employees` hands for contamination each time 
 
 they wash and can detect gut biomolecules in just seconds.
 
BUTLER: And this is what you should do. You need to get in the cracks in these little crevices here inside the palm and the nails especially is 
 
 where we see a lot of times people miss rinsing properly. Turn it off.
 
And then you come over to the hand scanner, put your hands underneath. It`ll let you know exactly when to flip and then it`ll let you know you 
 
 passed.
 
SCHINDLER: That data flow then translates back to management teams so they`re able to see in real time, are we hitting our required hand washes? 
 
 If we had a spike in hand washing contaminations, what actually caused that?
 
BUTLER: When you come here and you go to scan activity, it`s going to let me know how many times each day they`re washing their hands. Scroll up. 
 
 It`ll let me know how successful they are here. 
 
All the systems combined help us just monitor everything and make sure everything`s working properly. It allows us not to be in the store all the 
 
 time and be able to monitor it without being actually physically present.
 
DUFFY: While that might sound like micromanaging, the CDC has found that in the past, restaurant employees are more likely to properly wash their hands 
 
 when managers emphasize its importance.
 
BUTLER: Our team members can wash their hands for 20 seconds, but we can find out where they`re missing and coach, our team on how to do better.
 
DUFFY: PathSpot`s technology, which the company says is being used in roughly 10,000 food service locations worldwide, aims to take that a step 
 
 further.
 
SCHINDLER: By adopting this type of tool and technology, it`s creating a safer workplace and a safer livelihood for so many different aspects of the 
 
 supply chain.

WIRE: Now, our next story is on and popping. Today`s story getting a 10 out of 10, has us cracking up as a chiropractor in Oklahoma got a request for a 
 
 neck adjustment, but little did he know the patient was a giraffe. Jeanne Moos is on the story.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JEANNE MOOS, CNN NATIONAL NEWS CORRESPONDENT: If you think adjusting a giraffe`s neck would be a pain in the neck, listen for the crack. Here`s 
 
 how this Oklahoma chiropractor describes it. 
 
DR. JOREN WHITLEY, CHIROPRACTOR: Being able to work on a giraffe is a chiropractor`s dream. I mean, it`s the largest neck in the world. 
 
MOOS: Dr. Joren Whitley was called in because Gerry the giraffe, owned by a private rancher, had a chewing issue.
 
WHITLEY: His jaw was not moving to the left.
 
MOOS: So Dr. Whitley stuck his neck out trying to adjust Jerry`s. 
 
(On camera): What does it feel like to adjust a giraffe?
 
WHITLEY: Their hair is pokey and their -- their tongues are really slimy. Oh, it`s like a short haired cactus.
 
MOOS: Along with his human patients, Dr. Whitley specializes in animals, mainly dogs. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh, I heard that. 
 
MOOS: But also chickens. And after Dr. Whitley adjusted this injured bat, he says it was once again able to climb and hang upside down. He`s even 
 
 adjusted sedated lions like this one in South Africa. Skeptics say chiropractic has no basis in science, that there`s no proof it works on 
 
 humans or animals. But Gerry`s owner told the "Washington Post" the giraffe`s chewing improved after his adjustment. And look at that reaction. 
 
 One commenter called it the look of bliss.

WIRE: Now that`s one doc that will always have your pets back. All right, beautiful people. We are showing some love today to some of the folks 
 
 showing us love on our CNN 10 YouTube channel.
 
Johnston Senior High in Rhode Island. Let`s hear it for those Panthers. We appreciate you.
 
And how about those Gateway Gators in Nampa, Idaho. Rise up. 
 
I`m Coy. This is CNN 10. See you tomorrow. But a random thought Thursday before I go.
 
Why is it that when we deliver something by ship, it`s called cargo, but when delivered by car, it`s called shipment? That`s weird.
