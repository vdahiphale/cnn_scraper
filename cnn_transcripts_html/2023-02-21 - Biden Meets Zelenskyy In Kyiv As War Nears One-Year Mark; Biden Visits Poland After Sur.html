PAULA NEWTON, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: A warm welcome to our viewers here in the United States and all around the world. I'm Paula Newton. Ahead right here on CNN NEWSROOM. An unprecedented visit shrouded in secrecy. U.S. President Joe Biden travels to Kiva in a dramatic show of support nearly a year after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. 
 
China's top diplomat is expected in Moscow amid fears Beijing might send lethal aid to support Russia's war.
 
And then a massive 6.3 magnitude aftershock hits in southern Turkey just two weeks after the devastating quake that left tens of thousands of dead.
 
ANNOUNCER: Live from CNN Center, this is CNN NEWSROOM with Paula Newton.
 
NEWTON: So, it is just after 8:00 in the morning in Warsaw, Poland, where U.S. President Joe Biden is set to begin a two-day visit following a symbolic and highly secretive trip to Ukraine. Now in the hours ahead, Mr. Biden will be meeting with the Polish president before speaking at Warsaw's castle, Royal Castle, as he marks nearly one year since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. And that follows his surprise trip, of course, to Kyiv Monday.
 
An unprecedented presidential visit to an active war zone with no significant U.S. military presence. Think about that. Air-raid sirens in fact could be heard in Kyiv as he arrived. Mr. Biden walked alongside Mr. Zelenskyy outside St. Michael's Cathedral and some winter sunshine there greeted them. And it was a reminder though the dangers amid the ongoing war. And a risk that White House officials say the president wanted to take.
 
Mr. Biden said he wanted to leave no doubt of the unwavering U.S. support for Ukraine after a year of war that has devastated the country. Now, during his visit, Mr. Biden announced a half billion dollars in new assistance for Ukraine that will include of course, more military equipment. Now, we are tracking all developments with CNN correspondents. Kevin Liptak is standing by for us in Moscow. And Clare Sebastian is live for us in London.
 
Kevin, I want to go to you first. A bold and very historic moment there for Biden, Kyiv, and so much more to come in Poland. What more are you learning about how all of this went down and the fact that it really was truly unprecedented?
 
KEVIN LIPTAK, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: Yes. This was really months in the making. President Biden deciding that he really did want to visit the Ukrainian capital. We're told that he was given a few options, potentially some other locations in Ukraine. But he really made clear that in order for this trip to really be worth it, in order for the risks to be worth it, that he would need to visit the Capitol.
 
And that's, of course, what he did. He made the final call on Friday evening in an Oval Office huddle with his top national security advisors. Interestingly, the White House didn't notify Moscow before he departed in order to what they say deconflict to ensure that there wasn't sort of devastating mistake during the President's visit. He flew from Washington. He refueled in Germany. He flew from Germany to eastern -- or Eastern Poland.
 
And from there, he boarded that 10-hour train into Kyiv and making that highly symbolic visit. But of course, it was about more than just symbolism. President Biden wouldn't endure the risks and there were significant risks of this visit if he didn't really think you could accomplish something by meeting President Zelenskyy face to face there in Kyiv. And behind closed doors, they really did have very intensive discussions about what comes next in this war as it enters this highly uncertain phase as Russia prepares for this spring offensive.
 
President Biden really did want to discuss what will happen next on the battlefield and how the United States can best support Zelenskyy in his efforts to regain territory.
 
Now we will see President Biden today here in Warsaw really trying to bolster American support, Western support reaffirm that that Western alliance remains united as this war enters its second year. He will be meeting with of course, eastern flank NATO allies, including the President of Poland who will also meet with other allies tomorrow. And he'll deliver this speech from the Warsaw castle.
 
And Paula, the setting for this is interesting. And you'll remember last year 11 months ago President Biden also visited Warsaw, also delivered a speech from the castle here.
 <br>[02:05:01]
 
And at the end, he adlibs that line that President Putin cannot remain in power. Making this implicit call for regime change. Of course, President Putin does remain in power. He will deliver his own speech later today. And Moscow is setting up this extraordinary split screen of the two leaders laying out their visions of this conflict as it enters another year. Paula?
 
NEWTON: Yes. It really underscores of what a personal political point Biden was making, and certainly the way Putin is interpreting and interpreting all of this. For more, we're joined by Clare Sebastian. You are following developments in Moscow. You know, as Kevin just mentioned, look, Russia was given warning about Biden's visit. And yet now, as Kevin also mentioned, Putin will be making a speech later today. How is all of this received?
 
CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Well, I think that Putin speech long postponed, by the way, this is the State of the Nation essentially addressed, the first one in almost two years that President Putin will be giving designed efficiently for a domestic audience, but I think it's clear that they will also have the eyes of the world on this and they know that very well.
 
In terms of how it was received so far, the Kremlin seems to be holding fire for this speech. We did get a response from the former President Dmitry Medvedev. Now deputy head of the Security Council in Russia. He made a lot of the idea that this was sort of prearranged that that Moscow had some warning that this was happening. He said Biden, having received security guarantees in advance finally went to Kyiv.
 
He goes on to essentially accused the west of profiting from this war. I think economists will mostly tell you that the opposite is true. He is known for his very sort of strident, nationalist comments around this. But in terms of other reaction, we also heard from various influential military bloggers, their responses ranging from sort of defiance to despair around this one noting that it was a demonstrative humiliation of Russia and another pointing out somewhat ironically that Biden made it to Kyiv before Putin.
 
I think a couple of things are clear that we should watch for in Putin speech. One is that this really will bolster the Russian argument that they are at war, not just with Ukraine, but with the collective West, the U.S. and NATO. That is an argument that's used not only to diminish the sense of their own battlefield defeat, but also to deny Ukraine sovereignty, which is something that they have now been doing for this entire year.
 
But also, it's clear that the goals that President Putin expressed in speeches exactly a year ago, to essentially swallow up Ukraine to make it part of Russia. If you look at the optics of President Zelenskyy standing next to Biden, also President Zelenskyy's recent trips to various European countries and the U.S. that those goals as of now are failing.
 
NEWTON: Yes. A lot to go through there, especially when you consider that they had looked at this visit in Russia and actually thought perhaps that might play into their hands. Really proof positive that this is a war against the U.S. and its allies and not just Ukraine. OK. Clare Sebastian for us in London, Kevin Liptak in Warsaw. As you -- both of you continue to follow developments. Appreciate it.
 
Now, China's top diplomat meantime is expected in Moscow in the coming hours. Wang Yi could meet with President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in the Russian capital that he's been visiting with European leaders over the past week, selling China as in fact a potential peacemaker in the Ukraine war. But the U.S. of course, skeptical and warning Beijing not to provide lethal weapons to the Russian military.
 
CNN's Kristie Lu Stout is following developments from Hong Kong. And all of his, Kristie coming, of course, after that security conference in Munich where one was really quite blunt about what -- how China views this conflict. What do we expect on his agenda when he's there in Russia now?
 
KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes. And he is set to arrive in just the coming hours. According to the Russian news agency TASS, China's top diplomat Wang Yi is due to arrive Tuesday afternoon, local time. And according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week, they said that this visit would be an opportunity for Russia and China to exchange views on the relationship but also to exchange views on what they described as international hotspot issues, which is believed to be code for the Russian war in Ukraine on Monday.
 
As you look at these pictures on your screen, you know, we heard from Wang Yi while he was in Budapest making this appeal for peace in Ukraine, saying that China is willing to work with other countries in order to achieve a lasting peace in Ukraine. And according to a Kremlin spokesman, the Kremlin is not ruling out a meeting between Wang Yi and the Russian President Vladimir Putin.
 
Now this upcoming visit, it comes on the heels of the U.S. President's visit to Ukraine, but also in the back of just deepening diplomatic tensions between China and the United States over the Chinese balloon, and of course over Russia's war and its invasion in Ukraine. Just last weekend, the U.S. Secretary of State warned Wang Yi of consequences if China was to provide material support to Russia and China has fired back on that line.
 
I want to bring you a statement that was read out the Ministry of Foreign Affairs meeting on Monday and this is what we heard from the spokesperson. He said this, "the U.S. is in no position to tell China what to do."
 <br>[02:10:03]
 
Wang then continued to say, we would never stand for finger pointing or even coercion and pressurizing from the U.S. on our relations with Russia. So, China effectively telling the United States and regards to Russia keep out of our business, like since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russia and China have been edging closer on multiple fronts, you know, through military cooperation, through economic deals.
 
We know that China has been buying Russian energy, softening the blow of this Western sanctions and also politically as well, you know, China has been parroting Russian talking points refusing to condemn the Russian invasion yet condemning Western sanctions against Russia. So, when we see Wang Yi touchdown in Moscow, we will see this demonstration of this. No limits relationship. This partnership between China and Russia. Back to you.
 
NEWTON: Yes. And clearly the United States indicating that that is a red line. A lot of discussion with that in Russian media as well. And what does that red line mean? And will China attempt to cross it. Kristie, thanks so much for following up for us. Appreciate it.
 
LU STOUT: Thank you.
 
NEWTON: Now switching gears here. A powerful winter storm is beginning to bear down on millions of people in the United States. It is moving from the west coast to the Midwest and some states -- yes, unfortunately you're going to get hammered. California could suffer power outages in the coming day. And later this week, blizzard conditions are expected in the Twin Cities and sleet in Chicago that unfortunately will make travel a nightmare.
 
We want to bring our -- in our meteorologist Britley Ritz. I know what you're going to say. It is winter and yet this storm, really some severe consequences for a lot of states.
 
BRITLEY RITZ, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Absolutely. And, you know, Paula, on the other side of the state or on the other side of the country rather, we are dealing with record warmth. I mean, temperatures in the 90s across parts of Florida. And here we are yes, winter is not over yet. We have winter storm warnings and even blizzard warnings across parts of the Northwest and rolling across the northern plains and into the Great Lakes.
 
Winter storm watches and winter weather advisories. With the winter storm warning, that's backup now for Minneapolis where we can expect over two feet of snow within the next three days. There it is, the system. This is going to come in two waves here. Round one pushing in and then once the system moves in, the winds really pick up. So, then we wind up with whiteout conditions. We're talking like 35 to 50 mile per hour wind gusts.
 
We do have high wind warnings in place for parts of the Rockies, that's going to shift eastward as this first low moves eastward. There's round one coming in on Tuesday where Minneapolis could pick up four to six inches. Then the second wave moving in Wednesday and Thursday. That's where we expect some of the heaviest snowfall across the upper Midwest and across the Great Lakes. Ice expected.
 
So, there's the dark pink that you're seeing anywhere between 18 to 24 inches of snow across the northern plains and upper Midwest stretching into the Great Lakes. This is where we'll have to focus on the ice where we pick up roughly about a quarter of an inch to a half an inch regardless travel is going to be a mess. So, Paula, one of these times where you just want to stay inside and keep warm.
 
NEWTON: Yes. Good advice. Really thanks for that update. Appreciate it.
 
Just ahead for us. Wow. Look at that, two weeks after a devastating a hit by a earthquake. Turkey and Syria are reeling from another one. We'll have the latest in the live report from Turkey.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:17:28] NEWTON: Just two weeks after a powerful earthquake killed tens of thousands of people in Turkey and Syria, a magnitude 6.3 aftershock has further devastated the region. Now, this was the moment, you'll see it there when Monday's earthquake struck in southern Turkey's Hatay Province. At least three people were killed and almost 300 were injured in Turkey.
 
In northwest Syria meantime, the White Helmets organization reported more than 130 people injured. In both countries, several buildings that were already damaged by the last earthquake. Well, they've now completely collapsed.
 
For more on the story, I'm joined by CNN's Nada Bashir in Southern Turkey. I can't imagine how terrifying it was. I know you too were on the ground for this aftershock.
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN INTERNATIONAL REPORTER: Yes, absolutely. I mean, we are in the city of Adana which is about 120 miles away from the identified epicenter of Dafna in Hatay province. And we all felt the tremor here at around 8:00 p.m. local time, noon Eastern time. Yesterday, we were staying at a hotel. Now to save the sense of fear and shock amongst those staying here was palpable families moving all their belongings into their lobby -- into the lobby of the hotel so that they can be close to the exit for fear of another aftershock.
 
And this has been the most powerful aftershock that Turkey has felt since that earthquake two weeks ago. So, you can imagine the sense of fear and urgency around Southeast Turkey. Now we've seen search and rescue teams working overnight. Some of those buildings that were already damaged in the earthquake two weeks ago have since collapsed and there are concerns that there may be further fatalities at this stage.
 
Turkey's disaster and emergency agency has identified at least 294 people who have been injured in this latest aftershock. And among them, 18 are considered to be in a serious condition. But of course, we are still getting updates from the authorities on that.
 
And there is a real sense of urgency. We've seen that outpouring of support over the last two weeks and that is only going to increase following this latest aftershock. The authorities say they've already sent about 6000 tents to the affected areas. They're expecting that to continue as they assess the need in those affected provinces. We've already heard of field hospitals operating overnight. They already were.
 
But of course, you can imagine the shock for those already -- who've already been through the earthquake two weeks ago. Having to relive that trauma. It is an extremely difficult time. Paula?
 
NEWTON: Especially for parents trying to comfort children who have already been through so much. Nada Bashir for us. Thank you.
 
Now, meantime, the February 6 earthquake was so powerful it created a 300-meter-long canyon in a Turkish olive grove.
 <br>[02:20:06]
 
Residents there as another parts of Turkey are sleeping outside and waiting for basic supplies. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh has that story.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): They've all come to witness a site so extraordinary. Some would even say terrifying. The monstrous 7.8 magnitude earthquake split the land in the village of Tepehan in two. And olive grove now divided by this new canyon, roughly 130 feet deep and more than 900 feet long.
 
KARADSHEH (on camera): This area lies on the eastern Anatolian fault line that shook Turkey. And you can see how powerful it was. Geologists we've spoken to say that this is not unusual. They describe this as rock mass failure, but they say that this is not something they have seen in their lifetime.
 
KARADSHEH (voice over): These men from a nearby village tell us everyone is scared. They all now sleep outside.
 
No one was hurt in this village in the mountains, only a short drive from the devastated city of Antankya. Here like many other villages in the area, the damage is also limited. But its impact has been overwhelming.
 
I thought it was the apocalypse, the sky ruptured, the ground cracked. You have nowhere to run, Ilhan (ph) tells us. I have grandchildren. I hug them. And I think if we're going to die, we should be together.
 
Ilhan and his family more than 40 he says have been living out here under this makeshift tarp shelter. They need a tent, he tells us, but no tents or aid has made it to this village. There are too many hard- hit areas in need of urgent aid in one massive earthquake zone. And getting that aid out is a Herculean effort.
 
Incirlik Air Base has become an around the clock hub for these aid deliveries. These Turkish-American and Polish troops work together to get basic and lifesaving supplies out. Choppers here are constantly on the go.
 
KARADSHEH (on camera): This chopper (INAUDIBLE) of the city of Antakya. They're carrying baby clothes, warm children clothes, blanket, tents and much more of this desperately needed aid.
 
KARADSHEH (voice over): It's a quick landing here. People have to rush to grab what they've been waiting for for days.
 
Our house collapsed and we had no tents, this man says. I lost eight nephews. We asked for a tent, food and underwear. God bless you. You've made us so happy.
 
Help can't come soon enough for those who lost everything, left with nothing in an instant. 
 
Jomana Karadsheh, CNN, Hatay Province, Turkey. (END VIDEOTAPE)
 
NEWTON: Still to come for us. More details of Joe Biden's historic trip to Ukraine. And how it's providing a symbolic boost Kyiv at a crucial moment.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:26:47]
 
NEWTON: President Joe Biden is waking up in Poland this morning after his unprecedented visit to Kyiv. Now just days ahead of the one-year anniversary of the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Mr. Biden made that surprise trip to the capital city where of course he met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. His appearance in an act of war zone provided a symbolic boost Kyiv and ramped up pressure on Vladimir Putin as the Russian president gets ready to justify his invasion in a national address.
 
The President's trip to Kyiv was the first since Russia launched its invasion nearly one year ago. Alex Marquardt has the highlights of that visit.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Russian forces trying and so far, failing to make real headway in the opening stages of a new offensive in the eastern Ukraine. A devastating toll on both sides in the months long battle for Bakhmut where Ukraine is mostly facing mercenaries and convicts from the private Wagner Group. Today, a Ukrainian soldier in Bakhmut taking the time to thank President Joe Biden for his historic visit to Ukraine.
 
COL. YURIY FEDOROVYCH MADYAR, ARMED FORCES OF UKRAINE (through translator): This is the most powerful message of support for Ukraine at this moment.
 
MARQUARDT: In the capital, the U.S. and Ukrainian president seemingly undeterred by an air-raid siren trying to show the world they are in lockstep. Together briefly visiting St. Michael's Church before merging to lay a pair of wreaths. Ukrainian and American flags in front of a wall of portraits of soldiers who died in the fight with Russia. Biden keen to remind Russian President Vladimir Putin of his failures in the past year.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Putin thought Ukraine was weak and the West was divided. As you know, Mr. President, I said at the beginning, he's counting on us not sticking together.
 
He thought he could outlast us. I don't think he's thinking that right now.
 
MARQUARDT: While Zelenskyy called the moment the most important thing in the history of the U.S.-Ukraine relationship.
 
VOLODYMR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translator): This is the visit in this most difficult period for Ukraine when Ukraine is fighting for our own liberty. Today our negotiations were very fruitful. They were very important and crucial.
 
MARQUARDT: Negotiations about continued military aid. Today, President Biden announcing an almost half billion-dollar aid package for Ukraine, including ammunition, howitzers, and air defenses.
 
But big ticket items that Ukraine wants like longer-range missiles and fighter jets still up for discussion.
 
ZELENSKYY (through translator): This conversation brings us closer to victory.
 
MARQUARDT: This surprise unprecedented visit on the eve of a bloody anniversary. Extreme secrecy shrouding Biden's journey, no word, but there were signs. Deserted streets and a heavy police presence suggesting a prominent arrival.
 
President Biden quietly left Washington for Poland just after 4:00 a.m. under the cover of darkness, and after a long train ride across Western Ukraine arrived to warm smiles and laughter from Ukraine's first couple. His feelings left in a handwritten message about solidarity and friendship, which was echoed on the streets of Kyiv.
 
ANATOLIY, KYIV RESIDENT (through translator): It is support for us and a message for the Russians that this issue must be resolved and Ukraine must win. We hope that his visit will speed up the events.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
NEWTON: Joining me now from Warsaw is Marta Prochwicz-Jazowska. She is a program manager with the German Marshall Fund. And I want to thank you for weighing in here on what was really an incredible visit, profound significance. But I'm wondering how this was received in Poland and Eastern Europe where, you know, the war is literally on your doorstep.
 
MARTA PROCHWICZ-JAZOWSKA, PROGRAM MANAGER, GERMAN MARSHALL FUND: That's right. Thank you very much for having me. And good morning to Europe. Yes, the visit to Kyiv yesterday was just as big of a surprise as to anybody in the world.
 <br>[02:30:04]
 
And the feelings that the polls are sharing right now are very much akin to those shared by Ukrainians. So, first of all, there's a great feeling of surprise, that this visit was -- that he was able to travel to a -- to a war zone, where American military is not stationed. And admiration for his act of personal courage, and also, his the reassurance that Poles, and Ukrainians, and Europeans feel towards the American administration showing its resolve in this war.
 
NEWTON: You know, we're looking at some of the images now, and while the sunshine, of course, couldn't be planted, it was no less prolific there, both of them standing in the light. I want to know, though, do you accept that perhaps this visit, you know, gave Putin perhaps a propaganda win of his own? Because he has said to Russians, or he will say to Russians, certainly his allies have said to Russia -- to Russians look. We're not just battling Ukraine here, we are battling the United States and all its European allies.
 
PROCHWICZ-JAZOWSKA: Of course, you could -- when you look at it from the Russian propaganda perspective, and the way that they've spun this story, they didn't even need this particular visit, in order to portray this war in the way that they're showing it to their intern through their internal propaganda to Russians. Basically, they're portraying it as a proxy war of Russia against the United States, which is completely false. And this visit is analyzed in this light, of course, and very keen to see this is, of course, a developing story. 
 
And I'd like to see what President Putin will today say in his address, as you mentioned before. But at the end of the day, what we saw is the leader of the free world, going into a country that one year ago, was on the way to being invaded by Ukraine. But managed to withhold that invasion to not let the Russians take over their territory. And that is what really should be taken out from the story that now Biden is showing that Ukraine has withheld this invasion, and that he is capable of going to Ukraine and standing there while Putin is not able to leave his country and his hiding away.
 
NEWTON: Yes, it certainly reinforced the various pillars of Ukrainian sovereignty and everything that will be done to protect it. I want to ask you, though, about European unity. I mean, arguably, it's been very impressive so far. And those are the keywords, you know, especially in places like Poland, is there a worry that some other European allies may waver?
 
PROCHWICZ-JAZOWSKA: No doubt, experience a sense of a bit of fear of this wavering perhaps happening. However, this is a feeling that has been ongoing since the start of the war. And what we've seen so far, thanks to the push, also, thanks to Poland's push, to the push of the entire eastern flank. But with Poland playing a very special role here is to make sure that other European countries, that do not perceive this threat from Russia and aggressive Russian foreign policy are in such an existential way, in order for them to understand that it is an existential threat.
 
And so, we've managed throughout this year to really move the needle on many things that we thought were unthinkable arms deliveries from Germany and European Union, pulling together procurement in defense, which was unthinkable until now. And the United States coming back as a superpower, a leader in Europe, which in the previous era, under the Trump administration was very much doubted. So, since we've already seen so much move in this direction, I do believe that there's a very strong case to make that a lot can still be achieved in the -- in the upcoming future. 
 
And this is a war that is transforming the mentalities, not just the defense budgets, but the mentalities of Western Europeans towards this military threat and away from what they thought was time of peace, the end of history, the peace. And have to worry about our defense spending. So, so much has happened. And I can see this going forward in the right direction.
 
NEWTON: Well, I -- 
 
PROCHWICZ-JAZOWSKA: (INAUDIBLE) of the fears.
 
NEWTON: And we will as you point out, hear more in from Joe Biden in the coming hours there from Warsaw. Marta, thanks so much, appreciate it.
 
PROCHWICZ-JAZOWSKA: Thank you very much.
 
NEWTON: Now, after learning former U.S. President Jimmy Carter has entered hospice care people are traveling to his tiny hometown to pay their respects and reflect on his legacy. That's next.
 <br>[02:35:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
NEWTON: Admirers of former U.S. President Jimmy Carter are visiting his hometown to honor him. That's after we learned Carter is now receiving hospice or end-of-life care in the comfort of his home in Plains Georgia. CNN's Gloria Pazmino has that story.
 
GLORIA PAZMINO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: And all day here in Plains Georgia, the birthplace of President Jimmy Carter. We have heard from people who traveled from outside the area right here to Plains, to see the birthplace of Jimmy Carter and to pay their respects. They are reflecting back on his legacy, the time that he served as president thinking of the differences that he made, the life that he led, and the influence that he had over this tiny little town here in Georgia, so much of this small town is associated with him.
 
And there were people here who we spoke to, who wanted to see it and wanted to experience it and wanted to come here as they reflect on the legacy of Jimmy Carter. I spoke to someone earlier today who said that even though he did not grow up during the time of President Carter, he heard from him frequently from his parents, and his grandparents.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: One thing that strikes me about Jimmy Carter so much, and especially when I knew it, and especially when I heard the other day, he's been teaching Sunday school, see for four years. That's consistency, and we talk about consistency, we talk about leadership, and we talk about leadership -- we talk about impact. So, values, impact consistency and humility. You know, that speaks volumes about someone's life. And I think it's values that current America needs to lean more towards in order to ship the country in the right direction.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[02:40:06]
 
PAZMINO: Now, the place behind me is of course, where President Carter launched his political career first running for the Senate and then running for governor here in Georgia. Eventually, running for the White House at a time when he was a relatively unknown political figure in the country, but going on to win the White House. Only serving one term and at the time, many considered him to have been a failed president because he was not able to be reelected. However, he went on to define what post-presidential years are supposed to look like seeing extremely active in acts of a charity and launching the Carter Centre, which was responsible for overseeing democratic elections around the world. 
 
Helping to cure disease, helping to build housing for the homeless, among several other causes. The life and legacy of President Carter will be something that we will be discussing over the next several days, as he enters this period of hospice care in his home a decision that his family said was made jointly with his medical team. The president 98 years old, as survivor of cancer twice over, now receiving end-of-life care surrounded by those who are closest to him and his family here in Plains, Georgia. Gloria Pazmino, CNN.
