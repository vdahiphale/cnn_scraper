AMARA WALKER, CNN ANCHOR: Hi, everyone, and welcome to CNN this morning. It is Saturday, April 15th. I'm Amara Walker.
 
VICTOR BLACKWELL, CNN ANCHOR: I'm Victor Blackwell. It is so good to be with you on this Saturday morning. We got a lot going on today.
 
WALKER: It's been a very busy last summer days.
 
BLACKWELL: Yes. And here's what we're watching for you. President Biden is weighing in on the Supreme Court's decision to temporarily extend access to an abortion drug while it considers the case. The next steps in the process and why next Wednesday could be a pivotal day in the abortion fight.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MERRICK GARLAND, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: This is not just about taking home documents.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WALKER: A 21-year-old airman charged in connection with the leak of classified documents appeared in front of a federal judge Friday. What we're learning about him and the questions being raised about who should have access to classified information.
 
BLACKWELL: Part of South Florida are drying out or at least draining out now after the floods this week with some areas that got nearly two feet of rain. We'll talk about where the recovery efforts stand and where we're seeing the threat of severe storms for today.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I was proud to be the most pro gun, pro Second Amendment President you've ever had in the White House. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I will stand with each and every one of you in protection of what we all know, is cognizant.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I am a concealed weapons permit holder myself.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WALKER: Republican presidential hopefuls descend on the NRA Convention in Indiana to pitch themselves as the most pro Second Amendment person but not all of them got a warm reception.
 
We begin with women and health care providers across the U.S. being allowed to steal at least for now access one of the most common abortion drugs this morning. Last night the Supreme Court temporarily halted a ruling from a federal judge in Texas. Justice Samuel Alito extended access to the abortion drug, mifepristone while the full court considers an emergency appeal filed by the Biden administration and the drug manufacturer.
 
BLACKWELL: Significant restrictions on mifepristone had been set to go into effect early this morning. Well, now, that's been pushed back to midnight Wednesday, depending on when the justices decide. President Biden addressed the situation early this morning.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think it's outrageous what the court has done relatively to truly the match. They're going to overrule the FDA whether something says no, I think, it's -- other than Maine. And but we'll see what happens. We'll see.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BLACKWELL: CNN Supreme Court Reporter Ariane de Vogue is live with us now. So less than a year after the court overturned Roe versus Wade, clearly the abortion issue back before the court, what happens now?
 
ARIANE DE VOGUE, CNN SUPREME COURT REPORTER: Well, as you said, these restrictions to the access to this drug are right now on hold. Justice Samuel Alito moved in to freeze everything. He said, look, we need more time at the Supreme Court to look at this issue because of course, it's been swirling around in the lower courts.
 
But the justices need time to get read in. So he said, I'm going to put everything on hold for now until Wednesday. Now we can read the briefs, look at this issue. This does not really reflect how any of the justices were ultimately rule here. It's just to put it on hold for now to give them more time. But here's what they're going to now consider. The Biden administration and these manufacturers have come to them on emergency relief.
 
They say, look, you've got to put these lower court opinions on hold while this issue plays out while the appeals continue, because if you don't, it's going to severely restrict access to abortion medication. For instance, they say these lower court rulings, the effect is, is that before women could access this drug at 10 weeks, now they'd only be able to access it around seven weeks, if the labeling would change.
 
Also there's -- there'd be changes, they would have to have it administered in person and not by mail. So these are really significant changes in the FDA in its court papers, it said look, Justices, if you don't step in now, it's going to be much more difficult for women to access this drug while this appeals process plays out. So that's what they want the justices to do. And keep in mind the majority of abortions now in the states that allow abortions are medication abortion.
 <br>[06:05:12]
 
And so the justices will sit back and they're going to consider a couple of things. They're going to consider when they look at this emergency request, what is the FDA is authority here? What's the scope of their authority? But they're also going to consider something else whether the challengers, these doctors who do not believe in abortion have the legal right to be in court. So all this is swirling around.
 
WALKER: All right, Ariane de Vogue, appreciate your reporting this morning. Thank you. Joining me now is former federal prosecutor and defense attorney Shan Wu. I mean, this is obviously causing a lot of confusion for so many people, especially women. I mean, the pause button, as you heard Ariane de Vogue say, is on for five days, at least, which means that mifepristone is available until that right, so what happens then, after Wednesday?
 
SHAN WU, DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Well, a little bit unclear, I have to say that I'm a little bit pessimistic about what may happen here for a number of reasons. First of all, as we're just discussing with Ariane is a limited pause. And the fact that they want or a leader wants such an accelerated briefing schedule, makes me suspect there's an appetite on his part, on the courts part to take a hold of this issue.
 
The other concern is that it's a very nefarious type of issue, because by raising this near dead law, you know, the Comstock Act, it prohibits the mailing of not only justice, one abortion drug, but really anything related to abortion. And it has a huge impact, because so many women have been using the convenience of the mail drugs not having to go in person, not only because of COVID, but because it's probably less stressful.
 
So it has really big impact on them. And as a court with the conservative majority, they have been increasingly non-deferential towards agency expertise. I mean, the idea that they're looking at a drug that has been approved for some 20 years and possibly second guessing that, you know, is very worrisome. So I'm kind of pessimistic about what may happen here. And the effect would be really very, very terrible.
 
WALKER: And to that point, I mean, look, while these, this may be the same court, right, that overturned Roe v. Wade, last summer. This is a different case, though, right, because it focuses on the FDA and its process of approving drugs. I mean, do you see a window at all in which I know you said you're pessimistic. But do you see a window in which the conservative majority would not challenge the FDA scientific judgment? This is not about the, you know about abortion itself. It's about the drug process, right?
 
WU: Right. There's certainly a window there. And, you know, I think, Amara, traditionally, I would say, I'd have a different outlook on this, the court traditionally likes to make incremental changes. They don't want to take on something really big when they don't have to. And the issue of whether these plaintiffs have the standing, the legal doctrine of standing to sue, when arguably they themselves are not impacted by it.
 
Traditionally, that would be sort of an out for the court. They would push it down the road and say, hey, maybe this is an issue, but you folks are the wrong ones to bring it. But again, given that they have been eager to undermine agency type expertise, they may take the case. 
 
And in terms of the expertise issue, absolutely, they should be looking to the science here, and referring not only to the FDA's expertise, but to the time of how well this drug has been tested and used safely. So it's not like some new drug has just emerged. There's some questions about it. So they should refer to it. I just don't know if they will.
 
WALKER: So there's no chance, in your opinion that this case could even be thrown out under the argument that, you know, what the Solicitor General said and her filing for the Biden administration that these plaintiffs who are anti-abortion doctors, she said they don't have a legal right to take up this case, because they neither take nor prescribe the drug.
 
WU: Yes, I agree with that position. I think that's a very strong argument to throw it out there lack of standing, the lack of harm they've suffered. But I'd like to think that that may happen. I'm just not sure that it will.
 
WALKER: So then to your pessimism, Shan, we'll end it on this. I mean, so worst case scenario, then what do you see and what does this mean for women in terms of their health care, and also, you know, the FDA legitimacy going forward?
 
WU: Well, I think nothing is going to change the FDA's legitimacy. I think, the real issue here, again, it goes back to the high court's legitimacy and the only reason they would I think not take this on and uphold this very extremist position is because they may be concerned at this point about their own public image right now, because the court is in such low self-esteem. And they might want to take a more incremental approach to it.
 <br>[06:10:15]
 
I can perceive, for example, something similar to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals decision here. Remember there those two different conflicting district court rulings where they might uphold the ban on nailing but not ban access to and making women go to doctors has to be in person sort of thing. So there could be some sort of compromise there.
 
WALKER: Right. So meeting in the middle and putting some restrictions on mifepristone just like the appeals court did. Shan Wu, appreciate your time this morning. Thank you.
 
BLACKWELL: A 21-year-old Air National Guardsman has been formally charged with leaking top secret information. Jack Teixeira appeared in court yesterday and is charged under the Espionage Act. And he's due back in court Wednesday for a detention hearing. A witness tells the FBI that Guardsman started posting sensitive information months ago but U.S. officials only learned about these a few days ago. And that then set off a scramble to find the person responsible. CNN's Pentagon correspondent Oren Liebermann has details for us.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In a federal courtroom in Boston, 21-year- old Jack Teixeira faced his legal fate for the first time, charged through the Espionage Act with unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents and national security information.
 
The airman first class at the center of an investigation into a leak of top secret information. In court, his father yelled out, "Love you, Jack." The response, "Love you, too, Dad."
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you surprised by this?
 
LIEBERMANN (voice-over): Outside the courthouse, Teixeira's family thrust into the spotlight with national security interests at stake, said nothing. Teixeira was an IT specialist with the Massachusetts Air National Guard. He enlisted before graduating high school. His senior year photo quote that now appears prophetic, actions speak louder than words.
 
He's had a top secret clearance since 2021 and access to sensitive, compartmentalized information, in a job that requires a lifetime binding nondisclosure agreement.
 
GARLAND: People who sign agreements to be able to receive classified documents acknowledge the importance to the national security of not disclosing those documents, and we intend to send that message, how important it is to our national security.
 
LIEBERMANN (voice-over): One day earlier and one hour south, Teixeira was spotted on his back porch, reading a book. Moments later, an FBI tactical team closed in on to Teixeira, taking him into custody outside his house. Those who knew him growing up, described him as a bit of a loner, and into guns.
 
BROOKE CLEATHERO, FORMER CLASSMATE OF JACK TEIXEIRA: He doesn't have a lot of friends. But like some of the friends he did have or also kind of in the same boat as him in a way, but people are just wary of them.
 
LIEBERMANN (voice-over): But on Discord, an online platform frequently used by gamers, Teixeira built his own group of friends and followers. He's believed to be the head of a chat server named Thug Shaker Central.
 
Court documents allege that late last year, he began sharing classified information. A user in the chat group telling the FBI at first, it was just a paragraph of texts and then photographs of documents that contained what appeared to be classification markings.
 
ANDREW MCCABE, CNN SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST: The fact is, it's quite easy to do if you are a person who has decided to violate your oath, to violate the training and the rules that you operate under and to proactively make a decision to break the law.
 
LIEBERMANN (voice-over): In the days before his arrest, court documents say Teixeira used his government computer to search classified intelligence reporting for the word "leak" on attempt to find out if investigators were on to him.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
(on camera): After Teixeira's first court appearance on Friday, his detention hearing is set for Wednesday. This whole process moving fairly quickly, just about a week from when President Joe Biden and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin first learned about the leaks to the arrest and the prosecution of Jack Teixeira as a suspect in these leaked documents moving forward. Victor and Amara?
 
BLACKWELL: Oren Liebermann with the reporting. Thank you so much. And President Biden is directed national security agencies to take more steps to secure information after the leak arrest.
 
WALKER: Yes, CNN White House reporter Jasmine Wright is traveling with the president and she joins us now from Rehoboth Delaware. Jasmine, what more are we hearing from the President about this?
 
JASMINE WRIGHT, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: Yes, Amara. Well, the President is talking about next steps after this issue really shadowed his week-long trip to Ireland. Not only was he asked about it every day by reporters, but we know that he was also briefed repeatedly on it. So now the President on Friday, he really talked about Teixeira's arrest responding to questions on it. And he also talked about the conversations that he was having with Pentagon officials. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BIDEN: I've instructed the department to make sure that they get to the root of why he had access in the first place, number one. And number two to focused extensively on the extent to which it all occurred and that's going on right now. I have nothing to report beyond what's already been reported.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[06:15:13]
 
WRIGHT: So the President added later that he didn't believe the investigation would take very long, but he would not -- he would not talk about exactly how long is not very long, though, he said that he believed that they were getting to the bottom of the matter quicker than he had initially thought. Now, earlier on Friday, the President talked about what security steps that he was looking for. In a statement, he said that he had directed our military and intelligence community to take steps to further secure and limit distribution of sensitive information, and our national security team is closely coordinating with our partners and allies.
 
So President Biden obviously here looking forward notably, though, just a day earlier on Thursday, we heard the President kind of downplay the impact of his documents, though he said that he was concerned while in Ireland, he said that the information on those documents now public was outdated, but obviously from those two statements on Friday, it was a bit of a change of tone.
 
So the President is waking up this morning here in Rehoboth after a week-long trip to Ireland, really, as the fallout continues, and as this investigation moves very, very quickly. Amara, Victor?
 
BLACKWELL: And we'll talk more with some intel analysts and experts a little later about the potential damage of what was leaked. Jasmine Wright for us there in Rehoboth, thank you so much.
 
Fifty million people are facing the threat of severe storms today. We'll show you where the areas at risk are across the country.
 
BLACKWELL: Plus, South Florida is drying out after historic flooding, we've got to look at the recovery efforts there.
 
And there are new details in the fatal stabbing of Cash App founder Bob Lee. What we're learning about the timeline surrounding the stabbing and how the two may have known each other.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[06:20:57]
 
WALKER: More than 50 million people are waking up to a severe weather threat this morning across the Mississippi River Valley. Severe storms capable of producing very large hail damaging winds and even tornadoes are all possible. The biggest threat is in -- is for people in Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri and Illinois and the storms are expected to move in this afternoon.
 
To Florida now, where waters are receding this morning following a historic and catastrophic flooding event.
 
BLACKWELL: Did you see the video, the pictures coming out of South Florida? Look at Fort Lauderdale, inundated with almost three feet of rain and it turned that the streets into this I mean they had to drive down barely get down some of the streets and these vehicles. The airport there had to close for 40 hours. It's now reopened. Cleanup has started. CNN's Leyla Santiago is there for us.
 
WALKER: That's the airport.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LEYLA SANTIAGO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Folks here in South Florida returning to some sense of normalcy. The airport back open, flights coming and going water receding. But the damage here has been done for many of these communities. I spoke to one gentleman who at the time didn't have water called this a disaster said, in eight years of living in his home, he's never seen anything like this.
 
Remember, we're talking about historic numbers. The National Weather Service saying that on Thursday, three feet of flooding observed in areas and that was enough to force people to leave their cars immediately, leave their homes immediately, kept rescue crews very busy overnight as they tried to get to vulnerable people trying to get out of flooded homes. And hundreds of people had to turn to emergency shelters as well.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KEVIN GUTHRIE, DIRECTOR, FLORIDA DIVISION OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT: It is a significant flooding event. I will say this is a second most catastrophic flooding event that I've seen in my tenure as an emergency manager in public safety over the last 33 years.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SANTIAGO: So again, the words we heard to describe what many of these communities about nightmare, disaster, things they've never seen before. And yet the cleanup effort is still far from over.
 
Leyla Santiago, CNN, Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
 
WALKER: Yes. It looks like it'll be a while with all that water. Leyla Santiago, thank you.
 
Cash App founder Bob Lee, appeared to have gotten into an argument with a man accused of killing him right before he was stabbed to death.
 
WALKER: Court records show that Lee and the suspect Nima Momeni were connected through the suspect sister. CNN's Veronica Miracle explains the timeline of the events that led up to Lee's death.
 
VERONICA MIRACLE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Victor, Amara, in a newly filed motion to detain, the district attorney here in San Francisco lays a clearer picture as to exactly why they believe Nima Momeni is the one who killed Bob Lee. It describes the two of them as having been together at some point in the night before Bob Lee was killed and having some kind of altercation. Now exactly what they were fighting about and what the motive is, that is still unclear.
 
The district attorney says this is still an ongoing investigation. They are 10 days into this and they are still working out some of those details and it is still developing. But she did say they have a clearer picture as to what happened in the moments before the stabbing took place because of surveillance video. Hear what she had to say.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BROOKE JENKINS, SAN FRANCISCO DISTRICT ATTORNEY: The two men left and apartment in Millennium Tower prior to the stabbing, together. They got into Mr. Momeni's vehicle. Mr. Momeni was driving. They ended up in the area of the stabbing and that is where they exited the vehicle. And approximately five minutes later is when the stabbing took place.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
MIRACLE: Momeni was supposed to be arraigned on Friday, but that has since been continued to April 25th. He did appear in court and his family was in the front row including we're told his sister as well as an older woman who both held their hands up in the shape of a heart as he entered the courtroom. He acknowledged them and smile but said few words through the very quick hearing. His attorney who's representing him did have a few words to say to the media. Here's what he had to say.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[06:25:00]
 
ROBERT CANNY, ATTORNEY FOR NIMA MOMENI: The facts will come out what is basically in the press and what's being said the accurate as far as what occurred will come out in terms of time.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MIRACLE: Momeni is facing a murder charge as well as the special enhancement for using a knife in this crime, according to the district attorney. She says he is facing 26 years to life in prison. Victor, Amara?
 
BLACKWELL: Veronica Miracle, thank you so much.
 
Coming up, 2024 GOP hopefuls, they're heading to Indiana for the annual NRA Convention. We'll have details on what they had to say and what the audience said in reaction to some of their appearances.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BLACKWELL: The National Rifle Association kicked off its annual conference on Friday in Indianapolis just days after a tragic mass shootings in Louisville and Nashville.
 <br>[06:29:57]
 
WALKER: And former President Trump was a speaker at the gathering of gun rights activists along with other 2024 GOP hopefuls who vow to protect the rights of gun owners in America. CNN national correspondent Kristen Holmes has more on what the speakers at this year's event had to say. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I was proud to be the most pro gun, pro Second Amendment president you've ever had in the White House. 
 
SEN. TIM SCOTT (R-SC):  I will stand with each and every one of you in protection of what we all know is common sense. 
 
NIKKI HALEY, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I am a concealed weapons permit holder myself, my husband is a hunter and we value the fact that citizens have the right to protect themselves. 
 
KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The National Rifle Association Convention highlights the sway the NRA still holds with the Republican Party, even amid a rise in mass shootings in the U.S., including those in Kentucky and Tennessee in recent days. 
 
MIKE PENCE, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I know I speak with everyone here. When I say that our hearts and our prayers are with all the families that suffered loss and injury in these unspeakable attacks.   
 
HOLMES:  Former Vice President Mike Pence called for mass shooters to be punished more quickly. 
 
PENCE:  I believe the time has come to institute a federal death penalty statute with accelerated appeal to ensure that those who engage in mass shootings face execution in months, not years.
 
HOLMES:  Several contenders suggested policymakers should focus on expanding mental health resources and armed guards to protect schools. 
 
ASA HUTCHINSON, FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR:  If you're going to protect children, you need to have armed personnel to protect the children. 
 
GOV. CHRIS SUNUNU (R-NH):  We know the crux of these issues. It's undiagnosed mental health. It's a lack of opportunity in schools.   
 
HOLMES:  Former President Trump delivered the closing remarks at the forum, promoting his actions to expand gun rights while in the White House. 
 
TRUMP:  I fought Obama's unconstitutional effort to ban 3D printed guns. I stood up for our hunters, fishers and sportsmen like no other president has ever done before. 
 
HOLMES:  Appearing via a video, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who is seen as Trump's top rival for the nomination, touted his efforts to expand gun rights in the sunshine state. 
 
GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL):  As governor, I've resisted calls to take up gun control even when such a stand is superficially unpopular, because I understand that it is precisely at those moments when a right is unpopular. That it needs true champions. 
 
HOLMES:  The conference also marks the first time Trump and Pence have appeared in person at the same event after their public split following the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol, as the two former allies appear on a collision course in a 2024 GOP primary. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HOLMES:  And the former president didn't just tout what he did in the White House. He also talked about what he would do if elected president again in 2024, including calling for national concealed carry reciprocity, which, in addition to being extremely difficult to pass, would obviously be incredibly controversial. Amara, Victor?
 
WALKER:  All right, Kristen Holmes, thank you. Vice President Kamala Harris delivered some strong words during a speech Friday in New York, where she slammed Republican politicians for pushing anti-abortion measures. Now this comes after Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed a bill Thursday, that would ban most abortions in the state after six weeks. 
 
VICTOR BLACWELL, CO-ANCHOR, NEW DAY WEEKEND:  And the U.S. Supreme Court is considering whether to intervene in a Texas court ruling that would restrict the medication used in the majority of abortions today. Vice President Harris says the GOP is stripping away rights and masking it as freedom. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Isn't it interesting? That in the midst of all these attacks on fundamental freedoms, these so called leaders dare to tell us they are fighting for our freedoms. Don't you find that interesting? Don't fall for the okey-doke. Don't fall for the okey-doke. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
BLACKWELL:  And this morning, President Biden called it outrageous that the court was considering restrictions on that abortion medication. Here with me now to discuss is White House reporter for "Politico" Daniel Lippman. Daniel, good morning to you. 
 
DANIEL LIPPMAN, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, POLITICO:  Good morning.
 
BLACKWELL:  All right, so let's start here with where we find ourselves in this moment, and where the parties land. We're hearing a lot from Democrats who say that this is a moment that Republicans have called for, but we're not seeing the Republican jubilation for potentially a greater control on abortion and limiting the access to the medication. What's your view on how each party seized this moment as politically beneficial to them or not? 
 
LIPPMAN:  Well, Republicans could have had a huge victory in the midterms last year if Roe v. Wade had not been struck down by the Supreme Court, and Democrats would have probably lost both the House and the Senate if that court ruling had not happened. 
 <br>[06:35:00] 
 
But we find ourselves where we are now where abortion is not legal across the country, and that has huge partisan impacts because the majority of Americans are a pro choice. And so, the fact that Republicans have been pushing these anti-abortion bans, including the medication abortions that has real political issues for them, because in the suburbs, especially women, you know, you have a lot of people who say these are rights that are fundamental, and why are you taking them away from me?
 
And when the majority of Americans are very clear that this is something that they want enshrining the constitution potentially. 
 
BLACKWELL:  So let's speak about specifics and less generalities, and Ron DeSantis, Florida governor who signed on -- what was it? Thursday night, the ban on abortions beyond six weeks in most cases didn't have a big ceremony, signed it at night behind closed doors, the next day went to Liberty University, and he's on his book tour. 
 
This is potentially pre-announcement of his entrance into the Republican nomination fight. And didn't tout signing this major abortion legislation, only saying we have elevated the importance of family and promoted the culture of life. If you're going to sell that anti-abortion bona fides anywhere, you would do it at Liberty University. What do you take from even in a primary contest at a religious-affiliated university, we didn't hear from Ron DeSantis playing up that signature on that legislation.  
 
LIPPMAN:  It's pretty -- it's pretty wild. This is not something that he wanted to be as just about, because he is worried about the general election, frankly, where a six-week ban is even less popular than a 15-week ban. And you have almost 15 million women of childbearing age in the southeast, two are relying on Florida relax abortion laws.   
 
And now that may no longer be the case because of this. And so, I think DeSantis knows that he could easily lose the 2024 Republican or 2024 general election for the fact that he signed this. And so, he wants to basically wash this away. And you have a Florida legislature that is very anti-abortion, and wanted to get this passed.   
 
BLACKWELL:  Kristen Holmes has brought us a report about the Republican hopefuls who are in Indianapolis for the NRA Convention. Vice President -- former Vice President Mike Pence was booed at the beginning and the end of his remarks there. Let's get a little taste of that.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
(BOOING) 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We love you Mike!
 
PENCE:  I love you, too. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
BLACKWELL:  How much do we take away from Pence being booed here? He's still potentially going to run for president. Does it matter that, you know, a portion of a crowd at the NRA Convention boos the former vice president. 
 
LIPPMAN:  I think everything matters because we're talking about it, and a lot of this, you know, presidential primary is a -- you know, that media moments and those news cycles. And so if you have tough news cycles where you're booed by your own base of the Republican Party -- 
 
BLACKWELL:  In your home state -- 
 
LIPPMAN:  But then that's not good news -- yes, and it's a reminder that he -- the base of the Republican Party has never really forgiven Pence for what he did on January 6th, where Mr. Trump loyalists declined to overturn the election, wanted to stand well in history, even at the cost of his presidential hopes down the road.
 
And so, you have the hang Mike Pence crowd, not saying that those people were in that crowd, but they were booing Pence for a reason. And it's not for his social conservatism. It's for the fact that he was not willing to change the election results for Republicans. 
 
BLACKWELL:  Mike Pence might get into the race for the nomination. We know one person this morning who we can scratch off that list of potentials. Former Secretary of State, former CIA Director Mike Pompeo says he will not run for president this cycle, also did not commit to endorsing former President Trump, he was in the low single digits on most polls if he showed up at all. 
 
Does this change the race at all? Would a Mike Pence endorsement of Trump or someone else, even shift any votes? Mike Pompeo -- 
 
LIPPMAN:  I don't think that there's a lot of -- I don't think there's a lot of Republican primary goers -- in voters in the early states, especially who are waiting for Mike Pompeo to weigh in, and say, oh, actually, since Pompeo endorsed DeSantis now, I can vote for him.

So endorsements don't matter as much. I have been hearing for weeks that Pompeo was not going to run. There wasn't a clear lane for him, and he is not as charismatic as even a DeSantis or a Trump. And just like with Mike Pence, there isn't a huge core of constituent people in the Republican primary who were saying, hey, this guy, I want this guy to be my president. 
 
And so, I think that's -- this is good news for DeSantis because it shrinks the field a little bit. And you can't have a situation where you have a dozen Republican candidates going through super Tuesday. You will get Trump again as a nominee. 
 
BLACKWELL:  Yes, Chris Sununu said that everybody can get in. The question is, to know when to get out if the goal is to stop former President Trump from getting that nomination again. Daniel Lippman, always good to have you, thank you. 
 
WALKER:  All right, just ahead, thousands rally across France as the government raises the retirement age by two years to age 64. More on that from Paris.  
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [06:45:00] 
 
WALKER:  French President Emmanuel Macron has signed the controversial pension reform bill into law after its top court approved the legislation to raise the retirement age by two years from 62 to 64. That was on Friday for Macron, it's a big win. 
 
BLACKWELL:  Yes, but there are still lots of people in the country who are very angry at both Macron and his government with union leaders, they're vowing to continue the fight. CNN's Nada Bashir is live for us in Paris. So give us a sense of the mood there. 
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER:  Well, look, Victor and Amara, we have seen weeks of protests. And of course, that was the image we saw yesterday here in Paris and across France in response to the announcement by the constitutional council, still a significant amount of frustration and anger from the unions here in France, as well as other protesters directed towards the constitutional council for giving the green light to this legislation, which will raise the pension age from 62 to 64. 
 
The six minor measures included in that legislation were struck down by the council. But as you said there, this is a significant win for President Emmanuel Macron, but there is -- has been a significant amount of anger being directed towards the president for the way in which this legislation was pushed through. 
 
President Macron bypassing the lower house of parliament, where his party crucially doesn't have an outright majority, and for going a final vote, much to the frustration of many of the protesters we spoke to on Thursday and Friday, who told us that this undermines the principles of democracy here in France. Now, over the last few weeks, we have seen the protest figures waning somewhat from those record- breaking numbers we saw earlier in the year. 
 
On Thursday, 380,000 people taking to the streets, 42,000 in Paris alone, and we are expecting further   demonstrations. The head of France's largest union calling for many to take to the streets on May 1st, which is traditionally Labor Day here in France. She wants to see historic protests taking place on that day in response to the constitutional council's decision. 
 
BLACKWELL:  All right, Nada Bashir reporting from Paris for us there. Thank you so much. Coming up, a historic win streak comes to an end. The Tampa Bay Rays lose for the first time this season. We'll have the highlights in just a minute. 
 
And there's also something I want you to watch tomorrow night at 8:00. Nick Paton Walsh embarks on a treacherous journey through the Darien Gap, it's a lawless jungle riddled with danger alongside migrants hoping for a better life on the other side. 
 
It's the first installment of the highly anticipated program, "THE WHOLE STORY" with Anderson Cooper. It premieres tomorrow night at 8:00 on CNN. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [06:50:00]
 
BLACKWELL:  The Tampa Bay Rays record-tying perfect start to the season is over. 
 
WALKER:  Andy Scholes joining us now, I guess you can't win them all. 
 
ANDY SCHOLES, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT:  Wait, beyond guys, apparently 13 is the max for a winning streak to start a season. Yes, the 82 Braves did it, the 87 Brewers did it, they won 13 in a row. The Razors tried to break that record last night, but just wasn't meant to be. They're up in Toronto and the Blue Jays breaking this one open with four runs in the fifth inning.   
 
They're going to win 6-3, the Rays now 13-1 on the year.  
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
BRANDON LOWE, OUTFIELDER, TAMPA BAY RAYS:  I think probably everyone knew at 162, and I was probably out of the question, but no, it was a great run. Best thing about losing the streak is because you just start a new one. So, already to show up tomorrow and start a new streak.

SCHOLES:  All right, in the NBA, the Heat and Bulls playing a winner take all game for the eighth seed last night.

Minnesota using their great size to their advantage, Karl-Anthony Towns, 28 points, 11 rebounds, Rudy Gobert, he was back from his one game suspension for punching a teammate on the bench.

All right, the NBA announcing that Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid and Giannis Antetokounmpo are the finalists for this year's MVP award. 
 
Meanwhile, we've been speaking with 2007 MVP Dirk Nowitzki, the former Dallas Mavericks star just celebrated the 20th year of his foundation and his work with children here in the U.S. and in his home of Germany make him a true difference maker. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
DIRK NOWITZKI, FORMER BASKETBALL PLAYER:  We just celebrated 20 years of the Dirk Nowitzki Foundation here in Dallas, which, of course, makes me super proud. We were able to impact obviously lots of --lots of children and the families in the metroplex. Over the last two decades, we've done food drives over the last few years. 
 
Now, we always do a hospital appearance during the holidays, so we're able to impact a lot of families, and that makes us super proud. And in Germany, my foundation focuses a little bit of sports and integrating people. We have a mentorship program that we run where young coaches get to learn how to -- how to deal with their kids and make them better children. 
 <br>[06:55:00] 
 
And so, it's been -- it's been an amazing ride for me off the court, and trying to impact as many lives as I can. I think I learned early on in my career, you know, people come out to support you every night, and want you to do well. And it's sort of like a nice, a good thing to do is give back and make sure those people that are supporting you every night are taken care of as well.   
 
And now, I have even more time to really have more of impact and go to events, go to, you know, fundraisers or projects and really make sure that, we impact even more people. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
SCHOLES:  Yes, Dirk was one of the best on the court, and guys, he's still one of the best guys off the court, does such great work. 
 
BLACKWELL:  Yes -- 
 
WALKER:  Very likeable guy. 
 
BLACKWELL:  Thank you, Andy --
