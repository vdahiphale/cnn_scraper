MATTHEW MILLER, STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON: There's absolutely zero credibility to those charges. We have been clear from the start that Evan has done nothing wrong. He should never have been arrested in the first place.
 
Journalism is not a crime. The charges against him are false. And the Russian government knows that they're false. He should be released immediately.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: He should be released immediately. Do you feel, Paul, that there has been enough international outcry demanding Evan's release?
 
PAUL BECKETT, ASSISTANT EDITOR, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: There can always be more because until he comes home, our job is not done. So, we have worked closely with the American government. We're encouraged by the reception that we've got. But if anything, this procedure to trial should raise the urgency of bringing Evan back home and back to the nation.
 
BLITZER: Yes, as quickly as possible. The Biden White House says that it has attempted to make a prisoner swap for Evan and fellow American, Paul Whelan. What more do you -- would you like to see the Biden administration do right now?
 
BECKETT: Finish the job. I think it's something we've seen over the last eight months or so. We've seen -- periodically, we've had signs of hope. We had end of November, there was a proposal made that the Russians rejected.
 
There was more activity at the start of the year. And there's -- the longer it goes on, the harder it is for Evan. And the further down this path of injustice, we proceed. So, we just would love the American government, the Russian government, and any other governments that can be helpful to work with dispatch -- to get him released and stop this travesty of justice.
 
BLITZER: How much do you think the strained relationship between the U.S. and Russia right now that strained relationship is complicating the diplomatic effort to get Evan released?
 
BECKETT: Well, it's interesting. We've seen nation-states like Russia, like Iran, become the primary actors when it comes to the arbitrary detention of foreigners. And so, it becomes a national security issue.
 
It just becomes part of the relationship. And so, I think there's something that has to be factored in. We hold our conversations between two sides. So, it's not like there's -- you know, it's not a total freeze.
 
But it's a very complicated equation. We just need to focus on Evan and we're just asking the U.S. government just to focus on Evan and get Evan. And as you say, Paul Whelan has been there for so long. Getting them back to their families. So, it would be great if this didn't have to be part of the national security equation and relationship between the two countries.
 
BLITZER: As you know, Paul Whelan has been held in Russia now for more than five and a half years. Do you fear Evan could similarly languish in a Russian cell that long?
 
BECKETT: We're very, very hopeful that he will come back soon. And again, I hope that moving to trial will accelerate that process and not delay it. Roger Carstens says -- the chief U.S. hostage diplomat was on the Hill yesterday and he was asked about this development, and he said it would not slow them down or stop them from doing it. So, we're very hopeful.
 
But you have -- Paul Whelan is there obviously. Evan is there. And the Kremlin keeps doing it. They have you know Alsu Kurmasheva who is a reporter for Radio Free Europe Radio Liberty.
 
She has been there. Seized for no purpose. For being a journalist. And she's been there for over a year. So, this is habitual for the Kremlin. And the sooner that the U.S. finds a way to stop it, the better.
 
BLITZER: It's really horrible. Terrible, terrible indeed, Paul Beckett, let's hope that Evan comes home soon and Paul as well.
 
And coming up. Pope Francis is set to be part of a truly historic group photo with world leaders over at the G7 Summit in Italy. We'll take you there when it happens. Stay with us. You're in the CNN NEWSROOM.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:38:24]
 
BLITZER: Very shortly, Pope Francis will sit down with President Biden at the G7 Summit in Italy. This will be a very meaningful meeting for President Biden, who has often spoken about his Catholic faith. He's a devout Catholic.
 
Earlier at the summit, the pope met with comedians from around the world. Among them are Chris Rock and Jimmy Fallon. He told them, "You unite people because laughter is contagious."
 
Father Edward Beck is joining us now to discuss this truly historic visit. Father, thank you so much for joining us. Next hour as you know, President Biden, a lifelong practicing Catholic.
 
He goes to church every weekend, either Sunday or Saturday night. He's expected to hold a private meeting with Pope Francis. What do you think they will talk about?
 
REV. EDWARD BECK, ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH: Well, as you know, Wolf, this is their fifth time actually meeting together. So, they have kind of a relationship. So, I'm sure they're going to focus on global issues first, like the war in Gaza and Ukraine, and climate change.
 
But also, I wouldn't be surprised if they got into some personal issues. As we know, the president is dealing with family matters again with the recent conviction of his son Beau. That can't be easy for the president or his family or both.
 
And I'm sure as a pastor, if the opportunity is there, Pope Francis will also speak about some of these personal issues because he sees himself as a pastor to people first and foremost. And so, I think he will get into the important issues. But he won't shy away from talking to President Biden simply about how is he doing.
 <br>[11:40:02]
 
BLITZER: Father Beck, what do you hope will actually emerge will come from this meeting?
 
BECK: Well, I think what's on the pope's mind, in particular, is the war in Gaza and Ukraine. He'd love to see an end to these conflicts. And President Biden and the pope, as we know, are not exactly on the same page as to how that end will come about, or the swiftness by which it will come about.
 
So, I'm hoping that maybe there's some kind of meeting of the minds and wills to really work toward peace in those two conflicted regions. And I think that would be foremost on the pope's mind at this time.
 
BLITZER: How historic, Father Beck, is the pope's visit to the G7 Summit overall? Why hasn't this happened before?
 
BECK: Well, you know, this pope will go where he's invited. It happens to be in Italy. So, he was able to helicopter there.
 
He has an interest in AI, which is what he talked about at the G7 Summit. I mean, the Vatican has been working on this for a while. The Vatican Pontifical Academy for life has this document called Rome Call for AI Ethics. And that is kind of setting the gold standard for AI.
 
And the pope's concern is that AI be humanly based and take into account the poor and not leave people out or not be used as a method of destruction. And so, I think that it's historic because the pope wants to be where he has an influence. And so, he's invited. He goes. And I think he hopes to make a difference. He doesn't think we should shy away from political issues, especially if they affect other people on a global level. And I think that's really why he's there.
 
BLITZER: Good point. So far, what do you make of the response that Pope Francis has gotten from the G7 leaders?
 
BECK: Well, I think they were kind of surprised at how engaged he is. I mean, remember, Wolf, he's an 87-year-old man. He arrives in a wheelchair. But if you saw him speaking to those leaders and giving his speech, he was very animated about it.
 
I mean, he believes in this. He thinks it's important. And he thinks that they have the power to make sure that legislation is in place where AI does not get abused.
 
And so, I think the fact that you know, he's as engaged as he is, may surprise them. But I also think that they feel kind of honored to be in the presence of someone who cares so much about humanity, that he's willing at that age, and with all he has to do to make the time to be there and make his case.
 
BLITZER: A very special man, indeed. Father Edward Beck, thank you so much for joining us.
 
BECK: Thank you, Wolf.
 
BLITZER: And coming up. The fallout from Donald Trump's first visit to Capitol Hill here in Washington since the deadly January 6 Riot. Republican lawmakers welcoming him back with open arms. But former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney is warning "History will remember the shame."
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:47:35]
 
BLITZER: Today, former President Donald Trump is celebrating his 78th birthday, one day after his visit here in Washington up on Capitol Hill where Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell shook his hand. This coming despite the fact that Mitch McConnell blamed Trump for the deadly January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.
 
Former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney blasted her former colleagues for embracing Trump, warning "Remember, history will remember the shame."
 
Let's discuss this and more with CNN political commentators Maria Cardona and Shermichael Singleton. Shermichael, what do you think Mitch McConnell did a total reversal -- 
 
SHERMICHAEL SINGLETON, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Yes.
 
BLITZER: If we remember what he said then as opposed to what he's saying now and what he's doing now? What do you think? SINGLETON: You know, Wolf. I think the former majority leader, now minority leader probably still feels the same way I would say, Maria, about the former president. But I think Mitch McConnell is thinking we're on -- we're on the cusp of regaining control in the Senate. We're almost there. They're raising money within a Republican Senate Leadership Conference. And he wants to keep that momentum going.
 
And also, I think Republicans, broadly speaking, just want to regain the White House, whether it's Donald Trump or someone else. And so, with those aims being right in front of the minority leader, I think that's why he sort of quieted down some of his critiques and say, you know what, I'm just going to join the bandwagon and move things forward.
 
BLITZER: That's what he's doing.
 
MARIA CARDONA, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I have a little bit of a different take. I think it's one of the last bowling pins to topple. It is just such a demonstration of hypocrisy, cowardice, spinelessness, and frankly, a demonstration to the American people that the Republican Party really doesn't exist anymore.
 
It's the Trump party. Because those who are not going to play with Trump, I think, have -- either have to make a decision whether they're going to go with their values, with their beliefs, or they're going to kowtow to Donald Trump and genuflect at his altar. And clearly, McConnell and everyone else in that room that was with Donald Trump yesterday, has decided they're going to be puppets to Donald Trump the puppet master.
 
SINGLETON: Yes. I mean, look. I would say that Republican politicians, Wolf, are looking at the messages and signals from the voters. And the voting class within the GOP, they're resoundingly behind the former president. And you will see.
 
To Maria's point, anytime Republicans have attempted to critique the former president, former House member Liz Cheney, Adam Kinzinger, they're no longer in office. And there was a list of others who went against their voters, against the former president for what they would argue are their values, and they were not elected, Wolf, because Republican voters are saying we don't want individuals who are not going to support the former president one hundred percent.
 <br>[11:50:09]
 
BLITZER: Interesting. You know, what do you think, Maria, of Trump calling Milwaukee where the Republican National Convention in a few weeks is going to be taking place, in Trump's words, a horrible city? I mean, their excuses now emerging from various Republicans explaining what he meant.
 
CARDONA: Because they're worried about that kind of backlash and what it means to the people in Detroit, to the very host of the city that is going to have them for -- 
 
BLITZER: Milwaukee. CARDONA: Exactly. For -- in Milwaukee for their convention. It's horrible, horrible the way that he called Milwaukee. And Democrats to their credit are taking complete advantage of that right there underscoring just how hateful, just how vengeful, somebody like Donald Trump is.
 
And is this somebody that they really want as their commander-in- chief? And it gives the Democrats yet another opportunity to underscore the message about just how unfit Donald Trump is, 34 times convicted felon now and somebody who can't do anything positive for the American people.
 
BLITZER: Yes. Because Wisconsin is, you know, Shermichael, is a key battleground state right now.
 
SINGLETON: Yes, it's an important one.
 
BLITZER: It could go either way. And this presumably is going to upset a bunch of folks in Wisconsin when he calls Milwaukee, this horrible city.
 
SINGLETON: Well, look. Every city across the country right now that's a major city, they're facing a litany of challenges from homelessness to trying to make sure that people are bound and fully employed. You're going to find that everywhere. But I also believe that there are good hard-working people there, Wolf.
 
And we know I've been to a lot of conventions, so has Maria. The conventions bring a lot of money. A lot of people into those cities. It helps a lot of small businesses. And so, I want to look at this positively.
 
Let's have a good convention. And let's bring in those dollars to benefit the local economy. That's the way the former president should look at this.
 
CARDONA: You know, the problem is, is that somebody who seeks to be the leader of the free world has got to be somebody that can inject hope and optimism. That is looking at opportunities to bring in that hope and optimism.
 
SINGLETON: Yes.
 
CARDONA: Donald Trump does not have the ability to do that. And that's why again, I think it goes into and it helps the democratic message of just how unfit somebody like Donald Trump is.
 
BLITZER: Speaking of hope and optimism. Trump once again praised Hannibal Lecter yesterday. Listen to this. I'll play the clip.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: That's Hannibal Lecter. Did you ever hear of Hannibal Lecter?
 
They're being dropped into a country. Hannibal Lecter is coming in. Hannibal Lecter? How great an actor was he?
 
You know why I like him? Because he said on television on one of the -- I ended up Donald Trump. So, I love him.
 
I love him. He was great to me. The late great Hannibal
 
Lecter is a wonderful man. He oftentimes would have a friend for dinner. Congratulations, the late great Hannibal Lecter.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BLITZER: What's your reaction?
 
CARDONA: I mean I just really don't think I need to add anything to that craziness. That is just something that -- I mean I would be so scared if I were you, Shermichael, having to defend something like that. And look his base will eat it up, right? They loved him.
 
SINGLETON: Mr. Anthony Hopkins is a talented actor though. He's a talented actor. It's a great movie.
 
CARDONA: He didn't mention Anthony Hopkins.
 
SINGLETON: I know -- I know.
 
CARDONA: That's the problem.
 
SINGLETON: I Know. I know, Maria.
 
CARDONA: And so again, you know we laugh here. His face loves it. But this does nothing to add to the -- you know, the voters that he needs. Independent voters, suburban women. And as a Democrat, I'm great with that, you know.
 
SINGLETON: To that point -- 
 
CARDONA: Continue talking that craziness.
 
SINGLETON: To that point, quickly here, Wolf. There are some very serious issues that the American people are facing. And I think all Republicans would like to really stick to those issues. And I think even Democrats like to have that back-and-forth debate on which party will benefit the working-class people the most. And that's where I think these conversations should rest.
 
BLITZER: We're getting there. We're getting excited to think about this upcoming election. We'll see -- 
 
CARDONA: That is very true.
 
BLITZER: We'll see what's going to happen.
 
SINGLETON: Thank you, Wolf.
 
BLITZER: Maria Cardona and Shermichael Singleton.
 
CARDONA: Thanks, Wolf.
 
BLITZER: To both of you, thank you very much. And to our viewers, thanks very much for joining me. I'm Wolf Blitzer in Washington.
 
I'll be back later tonight 6:00 p.m. Eastern in "THE SITUATION ROOM," right back here Monday at 11:00 a.m. Eastern in the CNN NEWSROOM. Stay with us. "INSIDE POLITICS" today with Manu Raju starts right after a short break.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, host of CNN's "CHASING LIFE" podcast. What do athletes, office workers, and seniors all have in common? A need to stretch.
 
GUPTA (voiceover): Look, many people ignore this, but stretching is beneficial for all ages, all lifestyles, it enables us to move at our best. Think of it like this. Without stretching, your muscles will actually start to shorten. They'll get tight. And that puts you at risk for muscle and joint injury.
 
It doesn't take a lot. Research in the International Journal of Exercise Science shows that stretching just 10 minutes a day can improve flexibility and range of motion.
 
GUPTA: So, here are a few tips to get the most out of stretching.
 <br>[11:55:00]
 
GUPTA (voiceover): First of all, stretching cold muscles. That can hurt you. Do 10 minutes of light activity to warm up your muscles before you start stretching.
 
Second of all. Be consistent. Aim to stretch daily to get the most out of your routine. And find out when it naturally fits into your day.
 
Finally, enjoy the ritual. Join a class to make it social or make it a special time for you. Stretching is an act of self-care. And your body's going to thank you for this.
 
GUPTA: You can hear more about how to optimize your health and chase life wherever you get your podcasts.
