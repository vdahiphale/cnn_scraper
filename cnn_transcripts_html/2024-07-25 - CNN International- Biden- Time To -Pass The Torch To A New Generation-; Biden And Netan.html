FREDRICKA WHITFIELD, HOST, "CNN NEWSROOM": Hello, and welcome to our viewers all around the world. I'm Fredricka Whitfield, and this is the CNN Newsroom. 
 
Straight ahead, U.S. President and the Israeli Prime Minister will be sitting down to talk, one day after Joe Biden gave a historic address, and Benjamin Netanyahu spoke to U.S. Congress. Tracking Typhoon Gaemi, we'll have a live report as the storm makes its way into mainland China. And the Olympic opening ceremonies haven't even begun, but already controversies. We'll have a live report from Paris.
 
Hours after a pair of high-stakes speeches in Washington, D.C., Joe Biden and Benjamin Netanyahu will sit down today for serious talks on Israel's war with Hamas. The two leaders are trying to find a way to a ceasefire in Gaza and the return of hostages held by Hamas. For Mr. Biden, the focus on international conflict comes in the wake of an emotional speech Wednesday night, why he -- and he tried to enlighten people about his five decades in public service. The speech was full of hope and warnings about America's future, as Biden said, preserving democracy is more important than his personal ambition.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: I've made it clear that I believe America is at an inflection point, one of those rare moments in history when the decisions we make now will determine our fate of our nation and the world for decades to come. America is going to have to choose between moving forward or backward, between hope and hate, between unity and division. We have to decide, do we still believe in honesty, decency, respect, freedom, justice and democracy?
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
WHITFIELD: Well, earlier in the day, it was Mr. Netanyahu who commanded Washington's attention, as he addressed the U.S. Congress. He gave a little detail about the status of ceasefire talks, but offered this message of hope to the families of hostages.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER: The pain these families have endured is beyond words. I met with them again yesterday, and I promised them this. I will not rest until all their loved ones are home, all of them. As we speak, we're actively engaged in intensive efforts to secure their release, and I'm confident that these efforts can succeed. Some of them are taking place right now.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
WHITFIELD: We'll have more on the Middle East conflict in a moment. But, we do want to start with one of the most important speeches in Joe Biden's long political career. 
 
Arlette Saenz is at the White House for us. Arlette, what was the goal of the President last night in his speech?
 
ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Fred, President Biden was emotional and somber, as he reflected on his decision to bow out of the 2024 race, saying that it is now time to pass the torch to a younger generation. The President spoke for about 11 minutes from the Oval Office, with his family also in the room, including First Lady Jill Biden, as he really offered his first fulsome remarks relating to his decision to leave the 2024 race. 
 
Now, Biden made no mention of the Democratic pressure campaign he was facing over the course of the past month, as many Democrats publicly expressed their worry that Biden would be able to campaign effectively or beat Trump in November's election. Instead, Biden really tried to portray this moment and decision as an attempt to unite the country and preserve the very democracy he has been fighting for throughout his presidential time in office, as well as campaign. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
BIDEN: I believe my record as President, our leadership in the world, my vision for America's future, all merited a second term. But, nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy. That includes personal ambition. So, I decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. That's the best way to unite our nation.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 <br>[08:05:00]
 
SAENZ: Now, the President also talked about his record and accomplishments while also outlining a bit of his to-do list for his next six months in office, talking about how he wants to find ways to grow the economy, lower costs for Americans. He also said that he wants to or he will call for a reform to the Supreme Court, which is a major move for a President long considered to be an institutionalist, but one who has increasingly grown weary of the current makeup and trajectory of the Supreme Court. Now, Biden has said he'll will also focus on foreign policy issues during his final months in office as well. 
 
And the President also used this speech as an opportunity to praise his Vice President Kamala Harris, who will now lead the Democratic ticket. He painted her as capable and experienced and a leader for this country. He ultimately urged Americans to make their choice in the election, one that he hopes will preserve democracy after November. But, for President Biden, this speech really marks the first step in what's expected to be a long goodbye, as he has another six months left in office. 
 
WHITFIELD: And Arlette, in that six months, as you just outlined, he says he does have a significant to-do list. Will that still mean that he'll be on the campaign trail for Kamala Harris?
 
SAENZ: Yeah. President Biden has said that he will try to help in any way that he can to get Harris elected. He told staff in a phone call on Monday that he plans to remain fully engaged in this election. Now, it's unclear exactly how this will look. We know that advisors to the President and Harris have both committed to planning joint events for them in the summer and fall, but it's unclear when exactly he will hit the campaign trail. 
 
One thing to note that today, here at the White House, President Biden will turn his focus to that conflict in Gaza. He is set to host Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu here for a meeting. It comes just two days after the President has said he thinks they are on the verge of striking some type of deal to end the conflict in Gaza, as well as return hostages back home to their families. So, this meeting is coming at a consequential moment, as the President is hoping to discuss those ceasefire negotiations directly with Netanyahu. 
 
Of course, this will be the two -- first meeting in person between the two men since Biden visited Israel in the days after the October 7 attack by Hamas. Of course, the two men have had a very complicated relationship, and the entire approach to the conflict in Gaza has been a key concern for members -- voters within the Democratic coalition. This is something Biden is eager to try to find an end to the conflict, as he is winding down his time here at the White House. 
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Arlette Saenz at the White House, thanks so much. 
 
All right. More now on that nearly hour-long address to Congress by the Israeli Prime Minister. Benjamin Netanyahu lashed out at critics of his handling of the war in Gaza. He took aim at the International Criminal Court, among others, and downplayed Israel's role in causing the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. He also had this blunt message for protesters who have openly opposed his handling of the war. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
NETANYAHU: Clarity begins by knowing the difference between good and evil. Yet incredibly, many anti-Israel protesters, many choose to stand with evil. They stand with Hamas. Well, I have a message for these protesters. When the tyrants of Tehran, who hang gays from cranes and murder women for not covering their hair, are praising, promoting and funding you, you have officially become Iran's useful idiots.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) WHITFIELD: The protesters leaving behind graffiti, reading Hamas is
 
 coming. At least nine people were arrested by D.C. police. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi slammed Netanyahu's speech, calling it quote "the worst presentation of any foreign dignitary invited and honored with the privilege of addressing the U.S. Congress." 
 
All right. Let's bring in Barak Ravid now. He is CNN's -- CNN Political and Global Affairs Analyst, and a Politics and Foreign Policy Reporter for Axios. Great to see you. All right. So, you heard that criticism from our former House Speaker Pelosi. What was Netanyahu's goal in his address to U.S. Congress?
 
BARAK RAVID, CNN POLITICAL &amp; GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST, &amp; AXIOS POLITICS &amp; FOREIGN POLICY REPORTER: Hi, Fredricka. First, we have to tell the truth. I think what Nancy Pelosi said is actually quite accurate. And Netanyahu tried to use this speech to reassert his leadership, his tarnished image both here in the U.S. and back home in Israel where more than 70 percent of the people say in all the polls that they want him to resign. And I think what was, at least to me, pretty amazing is the celebratory tone in Netanyahu's speech, as if Israel has won the war and as if October 7 never happened. 
 <br>[08:10:00]
 
And October 7th was the worst failure of any Israeli government since the country was established. And he did not take any responsibility for this, not even in one word. He painted this rosy picture that most of the people in Israel just does not reflect how they live today. And I think that was pretty astounding. 
 
WHITFIELD: And in fact, what's allowed him to feel so emboldened to have that kind of tone on this visit?
 
RAVID: I think the fact that he knows that the room he was talking to was pretty favorable to him. There was a majority of Republicans in the room. Around 100 Democratic lawmakers didn't show up. So, I think he knew that he'll get a standing ovation and he can say more or less whatever he wants. And I think one of the things that he did not say, he did not say the word "hostage deal". And if you go and ask many of the hostage families who were in the gallery and listened to what he said, they were extremely, extremely frustrated and disappointed by the speech when Netanyahu did not say that he is going to push for a deal. He gave a lot of lip service, slogans, but he did not say, I'm going to get a deal.
 
WHITFIELD: So, those family members of some of the hostages who have been accusing Netanyahu of not working toward hostage release or ceasefire efforts, I mean, do they feel even more dug in with that sentiment, given that he did not mention the word ceasefire, hostage release? I mean, he did, however, implore to Congress to expedite the transfer to Israel billions of dollars in U.S. weapons.
 
RAVID: Yes, in many ways. This was not a speech of somebody who is looking on how to get a deal and end the war, but of a leader who is looking for ways to extend the war and continue the war. And today, Netanyahu will arrive at the White House to his meeting with President Biden, and Biden is going to press him on getting this hostage and ceasefire deal. And Biden has done something else. He invited to the meeting the families of the eight American hostages held by Hamas, a group that Netanyahu refused to meet as a group. And he will meet them in the White House today with President Biden, and they will be able to tell him exactly what they want him to do. And --
 
WHITFIELD: I'm so sorry that the last portion of his comment there interrupted, technical problems. All right. Well, Barak Ravid, if you can hear us, thank you. 
 
All right. After that meeting between Biden and Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister will also meet with Vice President Kamala Harris. Her break from the campaign trail will be brief, though. She has just come out with a new campaign ad. Harris' time back in Washington will also probably include some conversations about the search for her running mate. Sources were telling CNN that Harris hopes to pick a Vice President candidate in the next two weeks, an extremely fast timetable. 
 
All right. Let's go now to CNN's Jeff Zeleny with more on the Harris campaign. So, she has rolled out with that new ad there, which is in step with the song and the pacing when she met her new campaign workers there at the headquarters in Delaware. Tell us more about the momentum that she is feeling.
 
JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, good morning, Fredricka. Yeah. This campaign video from the Harris campaign is really designed to sort of put a frame on what her candidacy is going to be like, and it's all under the rubric of freedom. As you said, the -- we know what is going to be the anthem for her candidacy there. But, talking about freedom, as President Biden did actually when he announced back in 2023, he talked about freedom and democracy, but this is slightly different, talking about freedom for your own bodies (ph), freedom to vote to, freedom to work. So, that is going to be the soundtrack for her. But, she certainly is campaigning in Houston this morning, talking to the teachers union and members of the teachers union. 
 
But, going on behind the scenes, perhaps one of the biggest decisions that she will face, her first presidential-level decision, is picking a running mate. And we are learning that this is going to happen, the announcement will happen in less than two weeks. Certainly, the most accelerated process in modern American history. You'll remember, four years ago, four summers ago, she, as a Senator, was waiting four months along with others to learn if she was going to get that call from Joe Biden. She does not have the luxury of time. 
 <br>[08:15:00]
 
But, her a team of advisers and lawyers are looking through a variety of candidates, about six finalists or so, most are governors, one is a Senator, even a member of the cabinet, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. So, look, this is something that she is going to decide after her advisors look through all the vetting and things. She'll have interviews with these candidates and make that decision, of course, before the convention in Chicago. WHITFIELD: Right. I mean, it's going to be an incredible -- it's already an incredibly fast-paced week, and even more so over the next few weeks and just 100 days. 
 
All right. Jeff Zeleny, thank you so much. Appreciate it. 
 
ZELENY: You bet. 
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Donald Trump was in full attack mode Wednesday at his first rally since Kamala Harris became his likely opponent in the fall. After claiming last week that he was a changed man, Trump told his supporters that he is done being nice. At a rally in North Carolina, he repeatedly slammed Harris as an ultra-liberal, and claimed she has been part of every mistake made by the Biden administration.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If Kamala Harris gets in, she would be the most radical far-left extremist ever to occupy the White House times 10. There has never been a lunatic like this in the White House. And we've had some bad ones. But, the worst one is her (ph) actually.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
WHITFIELD: Meanwhile, a brand new CNN poll finds no clear leader in the race between Harris and Trump. Trump's small lead is within the margin of error. A CNN poll had given Trump a six-point lead over Biden just one month ago. 
 
Steve Contorno is tracking the Trump campaign for us. So, Steve, I mean, it didn't take long for Trump to go back to kind of the style that everyone usually associates with him. He says he is enough being the nice guy.
 
STEVE CONTORNO, CNN REPORTER: That's right, Fred. And let's be clear, he didn't stay the nice guy for very long in his convention speech, only through about the first half hour, and he certainly wasn't the nice guy last night on that stage. In fact, from the moment he took that stage, he more or less was on the attack. Take a listen to how he is going after his new potential opponent Vice President Harris.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
TRUMP: If Kamala will lie to you so brazenly about Joe Biden's mental incapacity, then she will lie to you about anything. She can never, ever be trusted. She can't be trusted. And just like crooked Joe Biden, Kamala Harris is unfit to lead. A vote for Kamala is a vote for four more years of dishonesty, incompetence, weakness and failure. Other than that, she is doing an excellent job.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
CONTORNO: That's a preview of what we can expect in the coming months. And look, the bottom line here is, Fred, that Donald Trump's campaign recognizes that this race has changed dramatically in the past week. His own campaign put out some polling -- some literature from their pollster that said, look, we expect Senator -- Vice President Harris to actually get a bump in the polls, and she may even be leading at some point. There is a lot of energy around her, a lot of enthusiasm. She is getting a new look by the media. And they know that that could include some sort of honeymoon period for her. So now, they are in a race to define her as quickly as possible. 
 
There is a Super PAC supporting Donald Trump, who is -- that is already on the airwaves in several swing states, trying to put her record in front of voters there. And Trump is going to be all around the country, trying to criticize her before she can get out there herself and to find who she wants to be and how she wants to campaign and look to what she brings to the table. So, this is an early glimpse into the Trump strategy over the next coming months. And as you can see, it's going to be pretty nasty. 
 
WHITFIELD: All right. That's his focus right now. All right. Steve Contorno, thank you so much. 
 
All right. Still to come, U.S. and Canadian fighter jets scramble after Russian and Chinese bombers get too close for comfort. The story after the break. And protests erupt in the UK over a police beating of three men, and it's all caught on video. We'll have the details.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 <br>[08:20:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
WHITFIELD: The U.S. says a joint Chinese-Russian air patrol near Alaska was not viewed as a threat. The U.S. and Canada scrambled fighter jets after the four bombers were spotted near Alaska. China just sent out these photos of the jets and says the patrol flights were not aimed at any quote "third party". The U.S. says it's the first time it has intercepted Russian and Chinese bombers operating together. 
 
Natasha Bertrand is at the Pentagon with more details on all this. I mean, it's a pretty ominous and frightening image. What do we know about these bombers, their capabilities, and really, what was the intent?
 
NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, Fredricka. It is the first time that the U.S. has seen the Russian and Chinese bombers actually operating together in Alaska's Air Defense Identification Zone, which is technically international airspace and therefore didn't pose a real threat to the U.S. and Canada at any point, but still, very notable. And the U.S. and Canada clearly felt the need to respond to it by scrambling F-16 and F-35 fighter jets on the U.S. side, and F-18s on the Canadian side. Now China, its defense ministry said in a statement earlier today that this was part of the normal kind of strategic cooperation that China and Russia are undergoing at this point in terms of cooperation between their two militaries. 
 
But, it really is concerning to U.S. defense officials, particularly the commander of Northern Command, who has said in recent months that he believes that the Chinese are going to try to be operating more in Alaska -- around Alaska in the Arctic in the coming months and years, especially as they continue to try to work more closely with Russia's military. As we have seen, the Russian and Chinese militaries, they have started to work more closely together and coordinate more closely, really, in the last several years since Russia invaded Ukraine, and China has been helping Russia's military support itself in that conflict. 
 
And so, this is a pretty ominous sign of that increased coordination between these two militaries. But again, the U.S. saying that at no point that they pose any threat, but of course, in order to send a message to the Russians and the Chinese that the U.S. finds this concerning, they did scramble those fighter jets to try to intercept them. The Russians have done this before. The Chinese have not. So, that is what makes this very significant at this point. Clearly, the Russians and the Chinese were trying to convey some kind of show of strength here to the U.S. and Canada, something that the U.S. felt it needed to respond to, Fredricka.
 
WHITFIELD: Interesting. All right. Natasha Bertrand, keep us posted. Thank you. 
 
All right. A police officer in Manchester, England, has been suspended after a video surfaced of a violent confrontation at the airport. It was all caught on video, and we do want to warn you that it's disturbing to watch. 
 
All right. You are going to see right here officers beating at least three people and one officer kicking and stomping on the head of one man when he was already on the ground. Police say they attacked after responding to a reported assault. And we don't know the condition of the men, can't independently verify what happened before, after that video was taken. 
 
Clare Sebastian is joining us now from London with more on the story. What more do we know? 
 
CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, Fredricka. This was an incident that we understand happened on Tuesday at Manchester airport. That is an international airport in Manchester. Now, the videos, as you see, they have gone viral, sparking public outcry. Police have provided a little bit of context as to how this happened. They say they responded to an alleged assault at the airport. That response then escalated. 
 <br>[08:25:00]
 
Three police officers were injured, including a female officer who had her nose broken. That's according to Greater Manchester Police. But, they are not using that context to justify what happened. They say that the footage that has emerged is truly shocking, very unusual. They have referred voluntarily the incident to the UK's Police watchdog for further investigation. That investigation is now in its early stages, according to the watchdog. They are looking into the level of force used by one Greater Manchester Police officer. Now, an officer has, as you say, been suspended. 
 
So, they are really trying to get out in front of this and that is because there is now serious concern that the outrage that we're seeing online because of these viral video videos is spreading into the real world. There was a protest outside Rochdale police station. That's a town just outside the City of Manchester on Wednesday night. That ended, police say, without incident and safely. 
 
But, we're hearing of more protests being called, people raising the question. Even though we don't know the identities of the men who were being beaten in those videos, yet raising the question as to whether this was an issue involving racism. A former Met police chief superintendent, this is the London Police Service, on the radio this morning saying racism was a significant part of this. Muslim faith groups have come out and condemned this. As I say, we don't know the extent to which there was a race issue here. Of course, disproportionate force is being investigated, but very much a concerted effort now to try and defuse tensions around this incident.
 
WHITFIELD: Incredible. All right, Clare Sebastian, keep us posted on that one. Thank you. 
 
All right. Still to come, from the grassroots level to big name donors, there is a significant surge of excitement surrounding the Vice President. Why some say Harris presidency would be best for business?
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
WHITFIELD: U.S. President Joe Biden will host Israel's Prime Minister for high-stakes talks at the White House in the coming hours. Benjamin Netanyahu will also meet separately with Vice President Kamala Harris. 
 <br>[08:30:00]
 
It comes one day after the Israeli leader gave a combative speech to Congress, trying to shore up support for the war in Gaza, while blasting his critics. Hours later, the U.S. President addressed the nation in a primetime speech, saying it's time to pass the torch. And he praised Harris, who is now the likely Democratic nominee.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
BIDEN: In just a few months, the American people will choose the course of America's future. I made my choice. I made my views known. I would like to thank our great Vice President Kamala Harris. She is experienced. She is tough. She is capable.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
WHITFIELD: It's not just the U.S. President who is expressing approval for Harris. Some major Democratic donors tell CNN that they are reinvigorated and planned to quote "go in big" and throw their money behind the Vice President. One big ticket donor said there is going to be a massive surge of new energy around Harris, and he is relieved the focus is now going to be going back to beating Donald Trump. 
 
CNN's Matt Egan joining me now live from New York with more on all this. Good morning to you. So, LinkedIn billionaire Reid Hoffman says a Kamala Harris presidency is best for business. You spoke to this mega donor. What more did he say? 
 
MATT EGAN, CNN REPORTER: Yeah, Fredricka. Reid Hoffman, he is going all in on Vice President Harris. He says that there is no such thing as Silicon Valley turning towards Donald Trump. He argues that many in the tech industry, including himself, are very excited about Vice President Harris. And he says that it's really Harris, not Trump, who would be stronger for American business and stronger for American families. Take a listen to why that is.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
REID HOFFMAN, CO-FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, LINKEDIN: Trump wants tariffs, which is anti-business. It makes us a very strange election indeed, because I think actually Vice President Harris is much more of the pro-business candidate than Trump and Vance.
 
EGAN: But, Vice President Harris, she wants to raise the corporate tax rate. The Harris-Biden administration or Biden-Harris administration has in fact imposed tariffs. So, aren't there some anti-business concerns there as well? 
 
HOFFMAN: I think what's most important for business is stability of a country, unity, rule of law. And a percent difference in corporate tax or two percent or three percent difference in corporate tax is far, far less important. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
EGAN: Now, the Trump campaign, of course, has pushed back on that, arguing that it's Donald Trump who is going to put more money in the pockets of American families, and blaming the Harris and Biden team for the high cost of living. Now, even Reid Hoffman, though, he conceded he is not a fan of all of the Biden administration. He was strongly critical of Biden's anti-trust cop. That's Lina Khan, the Chair of the Federal Trade Commission. Listen to what he said about Lina Khan.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
HOFFMAN: I do think that Lina Khan is a bad -- is a person who is not helping America in her job and what she is doing. And so, I would hope that Vice President Harris would replace her. I do find it entertaining that she is the precise person that J.D. Vance supports, Lina Khan, who is essentially trying to limit various forms of American business in ways that I think are not -- or outside the scope for job. I think the antitrust is fine, but I think just waging war is not.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) EGAN: So, you hear Hoffman going so far as to say that he wants a
 
 President Harris to replace Lina Khan, very strong words there. The FTC pushing back in a statement, telling CNN that Lina Khan is honored to serve in this administration, and arguing that she has worked to protect consumers, protect workers and entrepreneurs from corporate abuses. And it is worth noting that Lina Khan has won praise from many on the left, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, for taking on dominant companies, whether it's Big Oil or Big Tech. And as Hoffman alluded to, Lina Khan has even won some fans on the right, including on the Republican ticket. J.D. Vance has said that Lina Khan is one of the only Biden officials who is doing a pretty good job right now. 
 
So, for everyone who is screaming at home, that means we have a Democratic megadonor criticizing a Biden regulator who has won praise from a Republican VP nominee, Fredricka, another reminder of how this really is a strange election. 
 
WHITFIELD: It is strange indeed. All right. Matt Egan, thanks so much. 
 
EGAN: Thanks. 
 
WHITFIELD: All right. A former school police officer in Uvalde, Texas, who was part of the botched response to the 2022 mass shooting at Robb Elementary School will appear in court for the first time in the next hour. 
 <br>[08:35:00]
 
Adrian Gonzalez faces felony, child endangerment, and abandonment charges. He was one of nearly 400 law enforcement officers who responded to the scene, but then waited more than an hour to confront the shooter. 19 children and two teachers were killed. 
 
Shimon Prokupecz joining me now live from Uvalde, Texas. So, what do we expect today?
 
SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Yeah. So, it is 29 charges, as you said, and it relates to each of the victims in this case, the survivors and the victims who died that day. Prosecutors in their indictment say that Adrian Gonzalez failed to follow active shooter protocols, failed to impede the shooter. We expect to see him today. He will be arraigned on those 29 charges. Family members have started to arrive here in Uvalde at the courthouse, as well as other community members. 
 
But, this will be the first time that the families are face-to-face with the officer, the first time that they are in a courtroom, where they can finally get some accountability for the failures that day, of course, from the Department of Justice, which did its own investigation, state investigators who did their own investigation here in Texas, and other officials. All have said that there were massive failures that day and that the officers waited outside the classroom for over an hour, as the gunman remained inside with children who were injured, some who died. 
 
And so, now these charges, for the first time, you get some accountability, at least after family members are feeling, and this certainly is an important day for the community here and for the family members of the survivors and the victims. 
 
WHITFIELD: That's going to be a powerful day for so many. 
 
Shimon Prokupecz, thank you so much. 
 
All right. Still to come, Typhoon Gaemi eyes China after making landfall in Taiwan, bringing heavy rain, gusty winds and a dangerous storm surge. Details and a weather report when we come back. And we're just a day away from the opening ceremony of the 2024 Summer Olympic Games in Paris. We're live there for a preview of the big event.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
WHITFIELD: Typhoon Gaemi has just made landfall in mainland China. It left a trail of destruction in Taiwan, pummeling the island with heavy rain, strong winds and damaging storm surge. It also caused landslides and flooding in the Philippines. 
 
CNN's Marc Stewart reports from Beijing.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MARC STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The images of the damage left behind by Typhoon Gaemi show just how relentless and unforgiving the storm has been. Right away, I want to show you some pictures from the Philippines. 
 <br>[08:40:00]
 
In Manila, the capital, we've seen rescue teams at work in small boats in the streets. We've seen families rescued with children wrapped in towels or ponchos. Video and images show people wading through chest- deep water. Some people are even clinging precariously to overhead power lines. Businesses are closed. School is not in session, and flights have been canceled. One city in the north of Manila saw the evacuation of more than 55,000 people, including 16,000 families sheltering in evacuation centers. This according to a post by the government on the social media platform X. We should point out the typhoon itself didn't make landfall. Rather, this destruction is from its powerful outer bands. 
 
Taiwan also hit hard. What's interesting there, the mountain surfed to deflect and recurve the storm. As a result, the East Coast saw more impact than expected with powerful storm surge, extreme winds and heavy rain. And here in China, any rain is of concern, as we've seen a summer of intense flooding. 
 
Marc Stewart, CNN, Beijing.

WHITFIELD: All right. Let's bring in CNN Meteorologist Derek Van Dam. Wow. I mean, extreme weather all over the globe. But, that is really a sight to see. DEREK VAN DAM, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Yeah. And now this storm is making its presence known across southeast China. As Marc mentioned, it's currently located across the Fujian province. That's home to about 40 million people that's been impacted, at least by the most powerful part of the storm. But, let's not forget what's still ongoing on the outer bands across Taiwan, this area just getting pummeled with extremely heavy rain. Go back 24 hours and you can see some of the wind impacts from this powerful typhoon, which was equivalent at one stage to a Category 4 Atlantic hurricane. 
 
But, Marc was talking about this deflection that occurred as it approached mainland Taiwan, and it's all because of the mountainous terrain here. You can see on this map, there is Taiwan. These mountains, by the way, they tower over 12,000 feet or roughly 3,200 meters. And they work to actually help deflect a storm system. Here is a radar image to show you what we're talking about. See that recurve of the eye before it actually started to make the secondary approach to northeastern sections of Taiwan. That is incredible, but it's not unheard of. A lot of times, tropical cyclones, as they approach Taiwan, actually go through that process of deflection, slowing down and weakening. And that's what we saw minus the weakening stage for this particular typhoon. 
 
Here is a look at the rainfall totals. These are astronomical. We're going to be measuring this rain in meters across Taiwan. Now, it's still going to bring a lot of heavy rain to Fujian province and the southeastern portions of China, as it continues to move inland over the next 36 hours. How much rain? Well, we could exceed 250 millimetres in some locations. So, localized flash flooding, a possibility there, but really a lot of eyes focused on what's happening and continues to happen across Taiwan, because they got battered with heavy rain and wind. Fredricka. 
 
WHITFIELD: I mean, battered, indeed. All right. Thank you so much, Derek Van Dam.
 
All right. It's a story that sounds like something from the television show "Succession". There appears to be a battle happening for control of a vast media empire, for real. The New York Times reports that Rupert Murdoch, the 93-year-old owner of Fox News and other right-wing media properties, is going to court to block three of his children from taking control of the company once he dies. Murdoch wants to leave the Fox, leave Fox, rather, in the hands of Lachlan Murdoch, the only one of his children who he believes shares his political ideology. 
 
Our Hadas Gold is on this case for us. Wow. This really is like something that we've been watching and mesmerized about on television. So, explain why Rupert Murdoch feels like he needs to go to court to get a hand at things.
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN MEDIA CORRESPONDENT: Yeah. If you're a fan of the TV show "Succession", you should pay attention to this trial that's going to be starting in Nevada in September, and that's where we're going to see this family fight really play out. This was a stunning story reported by The New York Times. This is according to a secret sealed court document The Times obtained. CNN has not independently verified this. But, according to this court document, Rupert Murdoch wants to change what is called an irrevocable family trust. 
 
Now, according to this irrevocable family trust, initially, was that all of the four eldest Murdoch children, Lachlan (TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY) equal power, equal votes of the Fox Company, of Rupert Murdoch's company after Murdoch passes away. Murdoch is in his 90s. He is still going strong now. He just recently got married. But, at some point, he is mortal, he will die. So, what will happen to the company next is of course of great interest. 
 
But, according to the secret document, Rupert Murdoch wants to put it -- essentially ensure that all of the company is only controlled by Lachlan. Lachlan is currently the Chair of the company. He took over last September. 
 <br>[08:45:00]
 
He is chosen as the successor to his father, and he is seen as the Murdoch child, of the eldest child, with the most closely aligned political beliefs or political leanings as his father. 
 
Now, according to this court document, the reason that Murdoch wants to do this is because he believes that by keeping it within Lachlan's control that it will ensure the financial success of the company because his other three children are seen as more moderate. He is worried that they will moderate the politics, moderate the leanings of places like Fox News, and he worries that will hurt their financial -- the financial future. Now, the only way you can change an irrevocable family trust is if it is for the benefit of the heirs. 
 
And that is what Murdoch is arguing, essentially saying, my other three children, they're not right and -- right-leaning enough. They're going to change the stances of these companies. And in order for them to continue making money and continue being successful, as they have been, this has to change -- this has to stay with Lachlan, who was seen as the most right-wing amongst them. And keep -- if you look at the other children, that's pretty much true. James Murdoch, who once had a role in the company, he backed Biden in 2020. He has even come out publicly against how the -- these media companies have covered things, especially around climate change. 
 
Now, the kids have filed a legal challenge against this. The three other eldest Murdoch children have filed a legal challenge. This will play out now in court in September in Nevada. The New York Times pointing out that this may have caused even a personal family rift in terms of the personal relationships, because Rupert Murdoch just recently got married once again, and only Lachlan, of the eldest children, was in attendance. 
 
WHITFIELD: Wow. A must see must follow case. 
 
All right. Media Correspondent Hadas Gold, thank you so much. 
 
All right. More news after the break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
WHITFIELD: Tennis great Andy Murray is pulling out of the singles competition at the Paris Olympics. The three-time Grand Slam champion has said he plans to retire after the Paris Games. But now, at the games, he wants to concentrate on his doubles competition with partner Dan Evans. Murray recently had surgery to remove a cyst from his spine. He is the only man in tennis history to win two Olympic singles gold medals. 
 
And we've learned a Canadian Women's Football team member, a member of the staff, that is, has been given an eight-month suspended prison sentence after allegedly flying that drone, filming a closed-door training session of the New Zealand team. Canada's Olympic Committee has already confirmed two staff members of the would-be -- just two staff members, rather, would be sent home immediately amid the fallout from the incident.
 
(VIDEO PLAYING)
 
And enthusiastic welcome for the Palestinian athletes arriving in Paris ahead of the Olympic opening ceremonies on Friday. There are among the more than 10,000 athletes participating in the games. 
 
For more on the start of the Olympic Games, CNN's Melissa Bell, of course, is joining us from the River Seine. Berry (ph). And oh my Gosh. Melissa, are the opening ceremonies going to be on the Seine, the River Seine?
 
MELISSA BELL, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: This was the big ambition, the big pledge of Parisian authorities that this could be the scene for the first time ever, Fredricka, of an opening ceremony not held inside the stadium, but instead in a city center on a river.
 <br>[08:50:00]
 
You can see, the River Seine has been all decked out. There is no more traffic here on the River Seine, apart from the odd police boat. Over here, you can see where people will line the banks of the River Seine to watch, some of them seated, some of them standing. And in the end, you're going to have 325,000 people, say Parisian authorities, that are going to be watching that opening ceremony, the biggest crowd ever to attend in person. 
 
So, Parisian authorities very tight lipped, Fredricka, about who the artists are that will be taking part. But certainly, what they promise is something quite extraordinary in terms of the visuals. The security operation has been formidable, some 45,000 policemen and soldiers. This entire part of Paris really closed down ahead of that opening ceremony that promises to be spectacular. And Fredricka, it isn't just the opening ceremony that's to be held tomorrow on this river. But, of course, the swimming events, the marathon swimming, the swimming part, the triathlon. 
 
We spoke to the mayor of Paris a moment ago about her dip in the Seine just a couple of weeks ago to prove to the world that it was safe. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
ANNE HIDALGO, PARIS MAYOR: I love the water. I love the sea. I love the rivers. But, it's more than that. It's cleaning the Seine. Cleaning the Seine is cleaning our life. Clean the Seine is for the -- our generation and next generation live with the nature.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
BELL: That was from the very start at the heart of the pledges of Paris authorities that they would ensure that the city was not just taking care of the Olympics, but actually transforming the city that it becomes more livable for ordinary Parisians. There were a lot of pledges made when the bid was first won that seemed very optimistic, the swimability of the Seine, the fact that the opening ceremony would be held safely in a city center when you consider all the threats that weigh on these games, geopolitical, the terror threat as well. But, they believe, Parisian authorities, that this will be a spectacular event tomorrow. 
 
The only outstanding question at this stage, Fredricka, whether the weather hold up. It's sunny today. We expect rain tomorrow morning. And if we have it tomorrow afternoon, it would make a big difference. What Parisian authorities say is that there will be dancers on the rooftops, and of course, any rain would absolutely put a damper on things. For now, they are confident that it will hold. Fredricka.
 
WHITFIELD: Oh my goodness. That is going to be spectacular. I mean, just the idea is spectacular, and of course the security sweep continues, because it just happened as you were in the middle of your live shot. Keep a close watch on the River Seine. OK. We'll be watching. Even if you have tickets to sit right in those little bleacher seats behind you, I mean, that's great, but I have a feeling it's just going to be incredible to watch on TV because you're never going to have a vantage point of the rooftops, the river, all that at once even if you have tickets. 
 
All right. C'est la vie (ph). Melissa Bell, thank you so much. 
 
All right. Paris is expecting up to 15 million visitors to actually attend the Summer Games. And if you're one of them, maybe you're wondering how you can blend into the city without being a tourist cliche. 
 
CNN's Saskya Vandoorne has some advice.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SASKYA VANDOORNE, CNN SENIOR PRODUCER: Ah, Paris. Millions of people flock here every year for the culture, for tour, cuisine. But, how do you avoid being a cliche? Well, this summer, the Olympics are coming to town and in a city that's seven and a half times smaller than New York. Trust me, it's easy to spot a Taurus. There are a few simple ways to navigate Paris like a local. I'll be your guide. Suivez-moi. 
 
A classic faux pas asking for alternative milk with your coffee. 
 
VANDOORNE (Interpreted): Almond milk, Please? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (Interpreted): Sorry Madam, I don't have almond milk here.
 
VANDOORNE: Short and black, that's the traditional way.
 
Craving if get. What you really want to order (inaudible).
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (Interpreted): The Tradition.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (Interpreted): The Tradition.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (Interpreted): Tradition bread every day. Tradition, Tradition.
 
VANDOORNE: TRA-DEE-SI-ON (ph).
 
Those in the know (ph) would avoid traveling by car. Paris traffic is notoriously chaotic. (Inaudible), the city's public bike sharing service, and pretty much everywhere and cycle lanes are plentiful. The city's metros are often super congested, and in the summer, unbearably hot. So, try walking instead. In Paris, it's easy to get distracted, but beware of pickpockets. Don't keep your phone in your back pocket. Do keep an eye on your belongings. 
 <br>[08:55:00]
 
If you're lucky enough to be here for the games, the first thing to know is that tourist sites like these have been turned into an Olympic venues. So, it's probably best to avoid them. Places like (inaudible), the Eiffel Tower, right here at (inaudible). Metro stations will be closed and areas will be shut off to the public. Make sure you know how to pronounce the event venues properly. This place is called Les Invalides. It's a former military hospital. It's pronounced AHN-VAH- LEED.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (Interpreted): AHN-VAH-LEED.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (Interpreted): AHN-VAH-LEED.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (Interpreted): AHN-VAH-LEED.
 
VANDOORNE: No Invalids.
 
And lastly, know how to refer to the Olympic Games like a local, Jeux Olympiques. A lot of young people live in the east. That's the cool hipster area, great for a glass of wine on a terrace or some nightlife. The French capital skyline is a familiar sight and the Eiffel Tower might be its most famous icon. Try one of its many rooftops instead. That way, you're only a stone's throw away from some of these other standing landmarks. (FOREIGN LANGUAGE).
