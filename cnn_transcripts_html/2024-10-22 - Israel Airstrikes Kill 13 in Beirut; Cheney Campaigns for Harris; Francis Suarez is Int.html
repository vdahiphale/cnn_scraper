KASIE HUNT, CNN ANCHOR: All right, welcome back.
 
Secretary of State Antony Blinken touching down in Tel Aviv overnight. He is set to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The secretary hoping to revive peace talks and move toward an agreement on a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza and an end to the fighting in Lebanon. 
 
The Israeli military pounding Hezbollah targets in Beirut overnight. Thirteen people, including a child, killed by an airstrike near the main government hospital in southern Beirut. 
 
Let's go live to Jerusalem, where we find CNN's chief global affairs correspondent Matthew Chance. 
 
Matthew, this, of course, comes after Yahya Sinwar, the head of Hamas, was killed, potentially some thought providing an opening to renew this push for a ceasefire deal. What can you tell us about whether that is even a remotely possible expectation at this point?
 
MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Kasie, you're right, I mean following the death of Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader last week. He was killed by Israeli forces inside the Gaza Strip. There were a lot of people in Israel, in the United States, amongst Israel's allies elsewhere as well, talking about how this could be a window of opportunity for a ceasefire for hostages - there are 101 Israeli hostages still being held in Gaza to be brought out - and for a broader sort of settlement - a broader sort of ceasefire to be introduced in the region. 
 
But, I mean, that is not what's happened in reality. In fact, Hamas is still leaderless. It hasn't got anyone to negotiate with right now. And once that person is identified by the movement, it's not clear what their negotiating position would be. 
 
In the meantime, the Israeli government is pressing ahead with its strikes inside Gaza, killing, what was it, 27 people over the course of today according to Palestinian health officials. It's also expanded its military operation into neighboring Lebanon, where it's been conducting airstrikes as well. And it's poised, of course, the carry a strike on Iran, at which the Israeli government has threatened to do as well for the past couple of weeks. 
 
And so, it doesn't seem at this stage any side in this conflict is prepared to back down or prepared to ease off the fighting. And so that's the challenge Antony Blinken, the U.S. secretary of state, is facing as he comes for I think what will be his 11th trip to the region since the war in Gaza, since the October 7th attacks.
 
HUNT: An enormous challenge indeed. And, of course, shouldn't lose sight of the fact that we are, in fact, two weeks from the election here in the U.S., which certainly is something Benjamin Netanyahu is extraordinarily aware of. 
 
Matthew Chance for us this morning.
 
Matthew, thank you. I really appreciate it.
 
All right, let's turn back now to the final two weeks of the campaign.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JON STEWART, HOST, "THE DAILY SHOW": And the Democratic nominee is hosting some sort of book club with Liz Cheney. What the (EXPLETIVE DELETED)?
 
That's a Cheney. What are you doing with a Cheney? You're not allowed to hang out with a Cheney. They're Marvel. You're DC. You can't be in the same movie.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT: Flash back to when Jon Stewart first really made it. He remembers Dick Cheney perhaps better than many voters now. Once unlikely allies, Kamala Harris, Liz Cheney joined forces yesterday as part of a swing state tour of Philadelphia, Milwaukee, and Detroit suburbs. And, of course, the goal was to use Cheney, a former Republican lawmaker - former lawmaker, still a Republican, with true conservative bona fides, to reach out to disenchanted GOP voters, especially women who may be open to voting for the Democratic ticket this time around.
 
Cheney predicted there are many more Republicans who are willing to do so than you might think.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LIZ CHENEY, FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE: If people are uncertain, if people are thinking, well, you know, I'm a conservative, I don't know that I can support Vice President Harris, I would say, I don't know if anybody's more conservative than I am. 
 
And you can vote your conscience and not ever have to say a word to anybody. There will be millions of Republicans who do that on November 5th.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[06:35:05]
 
HUNT: All right, the panel is back. 
 
We've touched on this earlier in our conversation, but I think it's kind of one of the most interesting things that's playing out on - on the trail right now, this question of, are there these voters who silently are - you know, feel embarrassed I think was the word you used, Brad, about saying that they don't want to vote for Trump for whatever reason, and that they are interested in voting for Harris.
 
Is it real?
 
BRAD TODD, PARTNER, ONMESSAGE INC., CO-AUTHOR, "THE GREAT REVOLT" AND REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: I don't see the evidence of it in the polling. Mostly these suburban college-educated voters, they would - they would like gladly tell anyone who they're voting for. They think their opinions need to be broadcast. And so I don't see that as a pool of last-minute, undecided voters. I understand, I guess, while the Harris campaign is doing it because they're behind and they have to, in these swing states, and they have to peel some people back who are currently voting for Trump. But that's - I don't - I don't know that I see it.
 
KATE BEDINGFIELD, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, I think there's also this question, if you look at the gender gap in the race and overlay the gender gap and are - are they actually trying to talk to women in MAGA households who don't want to go against - not just go against their husband in like a very sort of like Old Testament kind of way, but don't you want go against - don't want to go against their community, don't want to - I mean, you know, our politics has gotten so personal and there's so much vitriol.
 
HUNT: So tribal culturally.
 
BEDINGFIELD: So tribal. And people don't want to, you know, spend a bunch of time having to defend to their family and friends why they're voting the way we're voting. 
 
So, you know, I think given the dramatic gender gap we see in the race, it is possible that there's a universe of people who need to be reminded that their vote is private. 
 
TODD: You know, one thing that might be there is, there's a marriage gap. And what - married women are going to probably vote for Trump right now. Single women are voting for Harris by like 75 points. So, it may be - that may be the root of what they're trying to do. 
 
JONAH GOLDBERG, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Yes, I mean, look, I - I have to think they're spending a lot of money on data. Like, if they don't see anything and they're doing this anyway, then the game's over, right? So, there must be some reason for it. 
 
At the same time, I really don't like doing anecdotes. Or, you know, anecdotes are not the plural - data is not the plural of anecdote. But in my world, I know lots of people who - HUNT: I was going to say, I like some good anec data every once in a while, Jonah. 
 
GOLDBERG: Yes, so, like -
 
HUNT: Don't feel guilty about it. 
 
GOLDBERG: You know, look, I - I - and I want to be like Pauline Kale (ph), but I know lots of people who are - feel very conflicted about this and are not going to vote for Trump because they just can't but they don't - in their sort of - this is one of the things you get from the big sort is people live in communities that are all on one side or another side of thing.
 
BEDINGFIELD: Yes.
 
GOLDBERG: And so, whether or not they are a statistically relevant number of people, I have no idea. 
 
ALEX THOMPSON, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: I mean, Trump is going on basically every bro podcast known to man and basically doing the inverse of what - of what Kamala Harris is doing right now. And that's why she's also doing it because - and this is why the gender gap is probably going to be the biggest maybe in American history is because not only is there real division on the issues, particularly abortion rights, but both sides are actually driving the wedge even further. 
 
HUNT: So, let's talk -
 
GOLDBERG: And you would rather have women. Women are more - I think are more conscious voters than bros.
 
HUNT: Women are more reliable. They're more reliable voters. Yes.
 
BEDINGFIELD: Yes.
 
TODD: It's a math problem. It's a math -
 
BEDINGFIELD: Especially young bros. They're not aways going to show up to vote.
 
GOLDBERG: Yes.
 
TODD: It's a math problem. That's - that's true, but it's a math problem. The gender gap is not a - there's not a value to it, it's just weather - how you work the math.
 
GOLDBERG: Right.
 
HUNT: Yes. So - but let's talk a little bit about - one of the most interesting things I thought that came out of some of these events was how Liz Cheney was talking about the Dobbs decision and abortion rights. Let's play a little bit of how she talked about this. Again, Liz Cheney, she identifies as pro-life. She was, you know, on the side of wanting Roe to fall. Here was a little bit of how she answered questions about this with voters - again, women voters in the suburbs yesterday.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LIZ CHENEY (R), FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE: I think there are many of us around the country who have been pro-life but who have watched what's going on in our states since the Dobbs decision, and have watched state legislatures put in place laws that are resulting in women not getting the care they need.
 
In places like Texas, for example, the attorney general is talking about suing - is suing to get access to women's medical records that's not sustainable for us as - as a country. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT: I mean, Kate, I just think it's fascinating to listen to her talk about this.
 
BEDINGFIELD: It is. I mean she's kind of giving voice to the - like the dog that caught the car issue that Republicans have had on this. I mean they've been hard charging, trying to overturn Roe for - for decades. And then they did and all of these consequences, which, I guess, maybe they would argue were unforeseen, although I don't know how you could reasonably argue that, you know, are now having an impact on people's lives and also, by the way, costing them electorally. 
 
So, you know, to hear her - to hear Liz Cheney of all people kind of give voice to that really tells you where this issue has moved in the two years since the Dobbs decision.
 
HUNT: I mean, Jonah, I think, for me, I think the question is, is there space here for maybe - is that something that might resonate with otherwise conservative voters, people who say, yes, I think an elective abortion would be morally wrong. 
 <br>[06:40:09]
 
I'm opposed to that. But if I'm having a miscarriage and I go to the hospital and I need something, it sort of makes sense to me that I should - they should take care of me. Is there space for that? I mean -
 
GOLDBERG: I think - look - look, I think so. I think that there is - I mean I - Kate referred to the dog that catches the car thing. That has been a huge issue on the right, is that the right, the pro-life movement had not really thought about day one post Roe very much. And they had not developed their arguments very well. And all of a sudden, the edge cases, which were on the pro-life side about partial birth abortion, and late term abortion, no matter how rare, they do it, it does happen, the stuff in Minnesota. All a sudden the edge cases flip. The emotional edge cases flip to being on the pro-choice side. And very few people had any idea how to argue about that, how to defend the new environment. And I think this is part of the shakeout.
 
THOMPSON: Well, and a lot of women have been the collateral damage of that lack of foresight from that movement. And that's also why so many women are, you know, especially with so many abortion rights ballot amendments on the ballots in key swing states that could end up being the deciding factor in the race.
 
GOLDBERG: Yes. 
 
(CROSS TALK)
 
HUNT: Well, and can I also just say that the fringe cases that you say, I mean, there are a lot more of them in this construction then there are - 
 
GOLDBERG: Yes.
 
HUNT: You know, the number of partial birth abortions in the country as - it's very, you know, late term abortion is very low. The number of women who get pregnant every year and have something bad happen is very high.
 
BEDINGFIELD: Yes.
 
TODD: But you don't hear, when you go to the rallies for Kamala Harris, you don't hear that in every state you have emergency medical care. That she - her rallies are not fact checked on this subject. 
 
And I also - I hated to watch Liz Cheney -
 
HUNT: But you don't in places like - I mean there are -
 
(CROSS TALK)
 
TODD: I hated to watch Liz Cheney, who signed the Amicus Briefs on the Dobbs case, who said let's push this back to the states, who said - who's made a career - she was rated A by all the pro-life groups when she was in - in Congress. And she's now so all in for the Democratic ticket that she's willing to sell out all her principles before I - I thought that was a bad look for her as a (INAUDIBLE).
 
GOLDBERG: I'm sorry, I don't hear anything that mean she sold out all her principles. I mean we had a huge fight about this on Twitter. A lot of friends of mine last night. And everyone - the way this originally broke on - on Twitter, which is, again, a bad place to be at night -
 
HUNT: Your friends are making some interesting appearances here today at the table.
 
GOLDBERG: Was - was that - that she came out against overturning Roe, that she came out against Dobbs. There's nothing in what she said there that says she came out against Dobbs. She said that some of this stuff - some of the consequences in some state legislatures have - have gone to the point where women aren't getting the medical care they need. You can have a problem with that. You're going to have a problem with the message - political messaging of it, but I don't think it's fair to say she's sold out all of her principles. TODD: OK. Where's Liz Cheney campaigning for Republicans for the U.S. Senate? Where is she campaigning for Republicans to control of the House? I don't see her doing any of that. As a conservative -
 
GOLDBERG: Yes, but that's not selling out all her principles. That's a different strategy and that's politics.
 
BEDINGFIELD: Yes, that's - that's a choice.
 
Also, I've got to push back on the idea that Kamala Harris' rallies are not fact checked on this. I mean she is talking about the cases of women who have lost their lives, in Georgia, you have the woman in Texas who's been very prominent spokesperson on this because of her experience -
 
HUNT: Kate Cox.
 
BEDINGFIELD: Right, Kate Cox, where, you know, she lost her baby and then was nearly rendered infertile because she couldn't get medical care. I mean these are facts. These are stories. These are happening because of the fact that these protections have been rolled back. That's - that's just true. I mean there is - that's not - you know, you can argue about whether, you know, you agree with that decision, but those are - those are facts. That's what's happening to women in this country because we no longer have the protections of Roe v. Wade.
 
TODD: There's a middle ground where we can work to make sure everyone has the medical care they need. 
 
HUNT: Well, I think that's the ground she was trying to stake out there. She's not saying we need to put Roe versus Wade back. She is saying that these laws that are resulting from the fall of Roe are unsustainable, I mean that was the word that she used. 
 
All right, straight ahead here on CNN THIS MORNING, Donald Trump's call for deportations under a law more than 200-years-old and how the former president's messaging on immigration is landing with Latino voters. We're going to speak live with Miami Mayor Francis Suarez.
 
Plus, Kamala Harris using Trump's visit to McDonald's to try to highlight a key economic issue for blue-collar workers.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I just saw something, a process, it's beautiful. It's a beautiful thing to see.
 
KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S. (D) AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I absolutely believe we must raise minimum wage and that hardworking Americans, whether they're working at McDonald's or anywhere else, should have at least the ability to be able to take care of their family.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I will invoke the alien enemies act of 18 - no, of 1798. Seven - think of that 1798. That's when we had real politicians that said, we're not going to play games. We have to go back to 1798. To target and dismantle every migrant criminal network operating on American soil. We're going to knock the hell out of them.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT: All right, Donald Trump calling for the return of a more than 200-year-old law that allows the president to deport non-citizens considered enemies during war time. This is his latest hardline rhetoric on immigration. Trump is set to participate in a roundtable discussion with Latino business leaders later this morning as part of his effort to court Hispanic voters. Immigration is a top three priority for the group. While Harris is also reaching out to Latino voters with a Telemundo interview today, polls show an opportunity remains there for the former president.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REGALLIO REGALADO, NEVADA VOTER: I see people on social media, Hispanics, sharing that polls that I'm down (ph) with her. I'm that, whoa (ph), I - even people that I know that they don't have a legal status in this country are doing that.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT: All right, joining us now, Republican mayor of Miami, Mayor Francis Suarez. He has endorsed Trump for president. 
 
Mr. Mayor, thanks so much for being here.
 <br>[06:50:01]
 
MAYOR FRANCIS SUAREZ (R), MIAMI: Thank you for having me. I appreciate it. 
 
HUNT: Let me just start with what we saw Trump say there about this 1798 law. Historically, it's only been used during war time. It was used in World War II as a pretexts for interning Japanese Americans. Do you think what we're seeing at the border meets the standard for invoking that law?
 
SUAREZ: I think Hispanics very much care about the border. In fact, I saw a recent poll that showed that over 80 percent of Hispanics are worried about border security. And that impacts their quality of life. As a mayor, and - and as we've seen, even Democratic mayors have criticized the current administration's border policy and - and the porousness of the border policy. We know that under Biden as of I think February of this year, over 7 million people have entered illegally into the United States. Thats more than the population of, I think, 36 states. That's something that tremendously concerns Hispanics that live in border communities. You're talking about, you know, tens of thousands of people that have died from fentanyl overdoses, which is the equivalent of a 747 crashing every single day. That's something that concerns Hispanics that live in border communities. 
 
And - and, frankly, a lot of cities have become border communities. You know, a city like Miami has had to really expand its public school network offering because of how many people have come. And that puts a strain on the system. 
 
So, I do think that Hispanics care about border security. I think that they care about abiding by the laws of this country. You know, they want to be - have a sort of an equal playing field. They want to be prosperous. And they've seen, in terms of this election, that this is a record versus rhetoric election, where under Trump's leadership, under former President Trump's leadership, you had record low unemployment, record high home ownership, and record low poverty among the Hispanic community. And those are going to be the - you know, sort of the indexes that Hispanics are going to use to determine who they vote for.
 
HUNT: So, are you saying that there is more concern about the border and border security than there is about what the mass deportations that Trump has promised might look like?
 
SUAREZ: What I'm saying is that Hispanics, law abiding Hispanics care more about having a prosperous future for themselves and their children than they do about people who are in this country illegally.
 
HUNT: All right (ph).
 
SUAREZ: And so I think there's a misperception that all they care about is, you know, immigration. And I think that's - that's, you know, that's something that - that is, frankly, somewhat racist. You know, I think Hispanics care more about making sure that they have an opportunity to succeed, making sure that inflation doesn't crush them every single day as it's done under this administration. And they're law-abiding people, like my parents are, who came to this country at 12 and seven from - from Cuba, which is a communist country and has - and has only produced misery and poverty for its people. And they see a lot of the same rhetoric being, unfortunately, espoused by the Democratic Party and that's something that concerns them.
 
HUNT: So, sir, I want to make sure that we acknowledged that the Latino vote across the country means so many different things in so many different places. People come from different communities. Obviously, Miami, you have so many Cuban Americans, et cetera. 
 
But I am still interested in your assessment of why Latinos, as a voting bloc, we're seeing this with black voters as well, voters of color, that are not necessarily seeming to be as inclined toward the Democratic Party this time around as they have been in past election cycles. It's part of why we're seeing numbers, especially across the sun belt, seem to look better for Donald Trump. And you touched on some of these issues in terms of the border, but
 
 I'm curious why you think that is and how much of it has to do specifically with culture.
 
SUAREZ: I think it has to do a lot with culture. I think it has to do with the fact that, you know, the Democrats have had four years under this administration and - and Hispanics don't see a record of success. They see inflation eating their paychecks. And then they see rhetoric that does not motivate them. Under President Trump, he was tough on Latin American dictators, like Fidel Castro's regime, Raul Castro and Miguel Diaz-Canal, and - and also in Venezuela as well. And that resonated with the Cuban and Venezuelan communities. I saw a statistic once where he got, I think, 75 percent of new arrival Cubans voted for the former president in the 2020 or the 2016 election, I can't remember which one.
 
At the same time, you had Democrats monolithically branding Hispanics as Latinx. Something that doesn't resonate with the Hispanic community, or saying, you know, that there as unique to San Antonio tacos, which is something that, you know, the - the first lady said in one of her speeches in I believe San Antonio. 
 
So, you know, those are things that, you know, Hispanics just feel disconnected from the Democratic Party. They feel that the Democratic Party has not listened to them, has not made their lives better. 
 <br>[06:55:02]
 
And so they're looking for an alternative. And I think that's part of what you see. 
 
And then I also think that the former president has listened. He's listened better to the Hispanic communities. He's tailored his policies specifically to meet the needs, as you said, I think very correctly, of the diverse Hispanic communities. They're not monolithic. They're not the same. Every community needs a different approach, has different priorities and they have to be met on an individual basis.
 
HUNT: All right, Mayor Francis Suarez of Miami. Sir, thanks very much for coming on with your perspective. I really appreciate it.
 
SUAREZ: Thank you so much. Can't wait to vote for President Trump today.
 
HUNT: All right. Thank you, sir.
 
I actually want to just take a beat before we talk about this next story because, Brad, I mean, why - and, Kate, I'm honestly interested in all of your perspectives as to why this is moving the way that it is. And like, in Pennsylvania, for example, Reading, Pennsylvania, is a place - it's a city with a lot of Latinos who are living there. I talked to the mayor of that city who's a - it's a different kind of story, but there is an undercurrent of potentially pro-Trump influences there in a way that I think might surprise some people. What do you see going on with this? TODD: I think Democrats approach the Latino community wrong. They have
 
 an identity politics approach. And I think a lot of immigrants to this country don't want that. They want to be treated as Americans, not something hyphen Americans. And I think when you look at their individual concerns, you know, it's inflation, it's crime, wait a minute, the border. It's the same as everybody else. 
 
Donald Trump is going to get more Hispanic votes and Republicans down ballot are going to get more Hispanic votes this year than they ever have before. Some of it's culture. You know, we mentioned earlier that Trump currently leads among Catholics by 22 points. That - that's a factor. But it's definitely a big movement. And I think four years from now Republicans will carry the Hispanic vote.
 
THOMPSON: I also think some Democratic strategists, for a long time, mostly white Democratic strategists, to be honest, basically thought that Latino vote equaled immigration policy. And that's just not true. 
 
BEDINGFIELD: Yes, there's a huge gap, as there - as there are with, frankly, most advocacy groups working in Washington and real voters - excuse me, there is a huge gap between the professional advocacy class representing people who are trying to make progress on immigration laws and, in some cases, doing very good work and not impugning them. But there's a huge difference and there's a big gap and voters largely, I agree with Brad and with the mayor, voters of all stripes largely care about the economy, they care about crime, they care about safety, they care about being - the same thing that all voters care about.
 
GOLDBERG: Yes, so Trump (ph) (INAUDIBLE) made this point a decade ago, that Hispanics voted just proportionally Democratic, not because of identity politics reasons, but because they were disproportionately poor. And as Hispanics move up the socioeconomic ladder, they become indistinguishable from the median voter. It is the normal story of American immigration, of American ethnic groups. They just become Americans. And so, therefore, you would expect their distribution between the parties would look more normal.
 
THOMPSON: Well, but it's interesting because a lot of the Hispanics that are moving towards Trump are not middle - are not necessarily middle class or upper class Hispanics.
 
GOLDBERG: Yes.
 
THOMPSON: It's a lot of people that are just high school educated.
 
GOLDBERG: Right, but a lot of those people are also coming - there's also an enormous amount of diversity in the Hispanic community. So, it's one of the problems with the D.C. consulting class that's thought of him as a monolith. But like the ones that are coming from places that have seen the ravages of communism, they're very susceptible to the arguments against communism in the United States. And that means they're going to skew more - I mean there's like Venezuela, all that kind of stuff. They're going to skew more Republican and fit more with the Cuban model than say the California Mexican American. THOMPSON: Well, this is also part of Kamala Harris' problem because,
 
 as Kate remembered, during the 2020 primary, Joe Biden resisted some of these calls that just go way far to the left, you know, decriminalizing the border, everything else. And Kamala Harris didn't resist a lot of those calls, and that's really hurting her right now. 
 
HUNT: Yes, I mean, Kate, should Democrats drop the Latinx framing?
 
BEDINGFIELD: Well, I feel as a white person that's not my call to say. I think, you know, it has always felt a little - at least what we would hear - I could - I could say on the Biden campaign in 2020, what we would hear from voters on the ground is it didn't necessarily resonate with them. It felt a lot more like language that people who were, again, professional, political - professional, political class was using.
 
HUNT: Yes.
 
BEDINGFIELD: So, again, I'm not - I feel like it's not - it's not my call to say but it -
 
TODD: It's a white, urban, liberal framework (ph). It's not an Hispanic -
 
BEDINGFIELD: It's - it's -
 
GOLDBERG: It's an academic phrase. It's an academic (INAUDIBLE) to Democratic discourse (ph).
 
BEDINGFIELD: It didn't - it didn't feel - it didn't feel like it was resonating with Latin American voters across (INAUDIBLE).
 
GOLDBERG: There's been an enormous amount of polling on this, which I'm - I'm sort of obsessed with this. Among Latinos - going back the last five years - who have heard the phrase - because most of them have never heard the phrase. And, first of all, good fricking luck degendering (ph) the Spanish language. I mean that's a -
 
HUNT: It is a lot more than just one x on one word, I will say that.
 
GOLDBERG: That is a lift, right?
 
HUNT: Yes.
 
GOLDBERG: But most Hispanics who heard it didn't like it. They felt they were being condescended to by like sort of Harvard yard academics. There were a whole bunch of progressive polling firms that were basically shouting, please stop using this because you're losing more Hispanic voters than you're gaining when you use it.
 <br>[07:00:06]
 
TODD: It's a flashing red light. If you're a conservative and Catholic and Hispanic, that this party is way left of you on every cultural issue. It's one letter that tells you everything.
 
HUNT: Fascinating. 
 
All right, guys, thanks so much for a great conversation today. Two weeks out.
 
All right, thanks to all of you for joining us as well. I'm Kasie Hunt. Don't go anywhere. "CNN NEWS CENTRAL" starts right now.</pre>
