KASIE HUNT, CNN ANCHOR: All right, welcome back. 
 
Later this week, the Senate will be voting on legislation to try to ensure nationwide access to IVF treatments. It's the Democratic efforts to not only enshrine federal protections for reproductive care, but also highlight Republican resistance ahead of the November election. The vote comes as the country is approaching the two-year anniversary of the downfall of Roe versus Wade and made way for controversial Alabama ruling that through into question the legality of increasingly used fertility treatments. 
 
Majority Leader Chuck Schumer calling on his Republican colleagues to pass this IVF bill.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): Protecting IVF should be one of the easiest votes the Senate has taken all year. The vast majority of senators should agree that strengthening treatments that help people start a family is a good thing. 
 
In no way shape or form is protecting IVF a show vote. It's a show us who you are vote.

HUNT: All right, joining me now are "New York Times" reporters Elizabeth Dias and Lisa Lerer. They are the authors of the new book, "The Fall of Roe and The Rise of a New America."
 
Good morning to both of you. Thank you so much for being here. And we'll let Kate and Matt ask some questions as well because this, obviously, is a conversation that the country is now having with itself, what - how is the nation going to look in the wake of the fall of Roe? And we are learning kind of every day the new implications that come out of it.
 
Talk a little bit about how you came to write this because you really, I think, set out to answer the question, how was it that Roe fell? What did you learn in the course of reporting this that helps us understand what's going on now? 
 
ELIZABETH DIAS, CO-AUTHOR, "THE FALL OF ROE": Sure. We felt it was really important to create a narrative of just what even happened, especially over the last ten years, because there hadn't really been one, right? This is an issue that's pretty polemical. And instead of just looking at that side of it, we needed to know, what are the facts, because you can't understand where we're going. And now we're talking about IVF, all kinds of issues that the - we had not talked about really publicly in campaigns before. I mean when was the last time anyone talked about IVF as a presidential issue or in the Senate.
 
HUNT: I think never. I mean I -
 
DIAS: Right, never. Right. We just can't remember.
 
LISA LERER, CO-AUTHOR, "THE FALL OF ROE": Yes, never. 
 
HUNT: Except when we were talking about, you know, used embryos on the -
 
DIAS: Right.
 
LERER: Right.
 
HUNT: There was a conversation, but it was a long time ago. Yes.
 
DIAS: Right. So you can't understand the stakes about where we're going until you understand the pieces of where we've come from. 
 
So, our book, "The Fall of Roe," really takes a look at all the things that maybe people missed about how we ended up where we are.
 
HUNT: Yes.
 
LERER: Yes, it really is the first narrative of how Roe fell. It's - you know, we - we did a lot of deep reporting on both sides of this fight, talked to people who really just opened up about sort of the legal and political strategy and the anti-abortion movement, and also how the abortion rights movement failed to see and can, in some cases, stop what was going on as much as they could. And - so it's really encompassing of the legal strategy and the political strategy of, you know, documenting this - this really, like, historic period in time. 
 
And I do think it scrambled our politics massively. I can't think of an issue that scrambled our politics so quickly and so dramatically as the end of Roe. And so to understand these new politics, and really in some ways to understand this election cycle where abortion has emerged as this determinative issue in a way that it really hadn't been at the presidential level, you have to understand how we got to this point.
 
HUNT: Yes, fascinating. 
 
And, of course, we got to this point in no small part because of Samuel Alito, is a justice who has come under increasing criticism here. And we actually heard him on tape - this was a liberal activist who recorded him at a dinner where he talked about - and, again, this was someone at a party who was approaching him with kind of her view and he says he agrees. 
 <br>[06:35:12]
 
But the word godliness kind of comes up. And I think it really ties into this conversation. 
 
Let's just watch a little reminder here, I suppose, that, and then we'll talk.
 
Watch.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LAUREN WINDSOR: People in this country, who believe in God, have got to keep fighting for that, to return our country to a place of godliness.
 
JUSTICE SAMUEL ALITO, SUPREME COURT: Oh, I agree with you.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT: So, Elizabeth, I mean, you really focus in on the connection between religion and our politics. When you hear that, I mean, how does it tie in with what Lisa does every day, which is cover campaigns? 
 
DIAS: Right. Well, it's not a phrase you normally hear in legal - like, legal decisions, godliness, returning - the idea, return America to a place of godliness. But we're seeing more and more in American public life, like basically you'd name - name the area where this merging of conservative Christianity and the future - like what the certain segment of mostly right-wing Evangelicals and Catholics want for the future of the country. It's a movement that prioritizes opposing abortion, often same-sex marriage, all kinds of these big hot-button cultural issues. And you hear echoes of this all the way in the highest court, right, with Samuel Alito. It's why we're hearing references to, you know, the flags being flown at his home, right, appeal to heaven, which is another conservative Christian sort of, well, actually banner basically -
 
HUNT: Right.
 
DIAS: About what kind of country they want.
 
LERER: Yes, I mean, I think part of what our book shows that they're - that, you know, the fall of Roe was accomplished by this web of conservative activists and lawyers and church - you know, churches and other - and politicians, of course, Republican politicians, who are all pulling together. There's no one mastermind. But they were pulling together, you know, in a way that took generations. And part of that effort was working conservative justices up through the courts and particularly to the Supreme Court. 
 
And, you know, then they made their sort of - the guidance had - they made their deal, political deal, with Donald Trump, helped get them election - elected. Donald Trump got three justices on the court, which was pretty unprecedented. And they got these justices who had come up in their movement and were willing to strike at such a landmark legal precedent.
 
KATE BEDINGFIELD, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I'm curious, did you - did you find, especially in the wake of kind of the immediate political backlash that I think it's fair to say Republicans are feeling after the fall of Roe, as you're talking to Republicans, do you - do hear them charting a course forward that is about leaning further into this? Do you feel - do you - did you hear them, you know, recalibrating? I'm just curious sort of what the -
 
LERER: Well, yes.
 
BEDINGFIELD: What they - what the - the political folks you were talking to, what they feel like the prognosis is.
 
LERER: It's so interesting because it wasn't just that Democrats didn't believe Roe could actually fall and abortion, even some abortion rights activists didn't believe Roe could actually fall. Many Republicans didn't believe Roe could actually fall. 
 
BEDINGFIELD: Yes.
 
LERER: So, the policy that was made, as we show in the book, and sort of the - what we call the Roe era, was built with this understanding that a lot of these things were political positioning, or even if they - Republicans believe they wanted to end abortion, they didn't actually think these policies would necessarily be put in place.
 
Then Roe fell, and the country was plunged into this series of unprecedented debates. And all of a sudden these politicians, on both sides, had to talk about things like IVF, had - I think I've heard the word miscarriage in uterus more - used more in political discourse over the past two years. I don't think I ever heard that in all my years - all our years covering campaigns, Kasie, right?
 
HUNT: Right. Right. Yes.
 
LERER: And so now everyone is plunged into this world where abortion rights are not sort of this abstract concept on the national level, like we're living in this real reality of like how sick does a woman have to be to get a medical exemption? What's sick enough? Like what - what do these things actually mean? And that's forced, as you're sort of saying, a scrambling of these politics. 
 
HUNT: Yes. Yes.
 
MATT GORMAN, FORMER SENIOR ADVISER, TIM SCOTT PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: And I would ask, I would agree with you first of all -
 
LERER: Oh, really.
 
GORMAN: I think in a lot of respects, on our side it was, oh, yes, we're got this kind of thing. It's coming. Like, you know, and it really wasn't like, for a lot of folks, a very tangible thing until it got very, very close. LERER: Right.
 
GORMAN: And I get to that point, what is one kind of either event or decision that kind of led - that we might have missed during that, you know, five, 10 year span prior that you think, like, this was kind of where it was set a little bit on the glide path? Was it the justices? Was it something more minute?  
 
LERER: Yes, and I'm not saying Republicans were not sincere in their desire to end abortion. 
 
GORMAN: Yes.
 
LERER: I think they were. I just think nobody really thought through what it actually would mean in real life, tangible impact. 
 
You know, it's interesting because our book starts in 2012 and - right after the re-election of Barack Obama, and we started in that point because it's really the lowest point for the anti-abortion movement. And if you remember what the country was, it's the moment when conservative Christians stopping being a majority in American public life. 
 <br>[06:40:05]
 
It's the moment when Obama's re-elected, when Democrats feel ascendant, when they have this abortion rights majority on the Supreme Court. And I think that moment, that Republican autopsy, which I'm sure we all remember -
 
HUNT: Yes, we all remember it well.
 
BEDINGFIELD: We all remember.
 
LERER: We are - Republicans -
 
HUNT: Lisa and I covered that campaign together. Yes, we did.
 
LERER: Yes, we did. Yes. We sat next to each other on the plane.
 
HUNT: Yes.
 
LERER: For many, many, many, many days, weeks.
 
HUNT: Yes.
 
LERER: Where Republicans - the Republican Party really said, we think abortion's a loser. It's a loser of an issue for us. And that moment I think is overlooked because that's the moment when the anti-abortion movement start to claw back and they really - sort of these activists, I think, dug deep and figured out a new strategy. And their strategy was, we're not shying away from this, we're leaning into it more. And we think our voters and our politicians will support us. And they were right in some ways.
 
DIAS: Well, and it would be really easy to just find one moment, right? If there was just one thing we all understood, then we could unlock this mystery. But the - part of the major success of the anti- abortion movement was their ability not to create one plan, but dozens, hundreds of plans, right? It was this idea that they would leave no stone unturned. They would fill every crack. And eventually, like, they would build kind of a collective - a collective body of work that would inevitably leave to - lead to the overturning of Roe.
 
HUNT: Yes, and I - I think your book also kind of outlines how, while these groups were able to do that and had sot of the passion, the dedication to do this for years and years, that was missing from people - from the movement that supported abortion rights. 
 
DIAS: Oh, it did.
 
HUNT: Yes, absolutely. OK. 
 
Lisa Lerer, Elizabeth Dias, thank you both so much for being here. 
 
LERER: Thank you.
 
DIAS: Thanks.
 
HUNT: Again, the book is "The Fall of Roe and The Rise of a New America." I highly recommend it. It's a fascinating read. 
 
All right, coming up next here, the emotional toll Hunter Biden's federal conviction is having on the president and his family.
 
Plus, Joey Chestnut, remember him, removed from the Nathan's hot dog eating contest. Why organizers - I'm not reading this - they want me to say he was tossed out on his buns. I guess I said it anyway. That's ahead.

And this. The top dog is out at this year's Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest. The 16-time champion, Joey Chestnut, was disqualified for striking an endorsement deal with a plant-based food company, Impossible Foods. That violates Major League Eating regulations apparently.
 
Matt Gorman, this is kind of sad. 
 
GORMAN: It's kind of sad. End in an era. Sixteen-time champion to the (INAUDIBLE) Takeru Kobayashi. Watch Matt (INAUDIBLE) Stonie, could be the next champion. This is one of the best events of the year. I swear to God. The guy in the gray - or the - the straw hat, George Gray (ph), is an electric host. At noon every July 4th, my dad and I - I have a t-shirt. I love it every single year. It's amazing.
 
BEDINGFIELD: That's awesome.
 
HUNT: You all - you all should know out there, I - in the break, I asked everyone, hey, like who wants to talk about the hot dog guy. Matt goes, yes. 
 
GORMAN: Jumped on it. Yes.
 
HUNT: I had no idea where it would lead (ph).
 
GORMAN: I have the t-shirt. I wear it every year. It's fantastic.
 
BEDINGFIELD: That is awesome. ALEX THOMPSON, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, "AXIOS": That's what you
 
 live for.
 
GORMAN: (INAUDIBLE).
 
HUNT: All right, we'll bring you back after - after it happens.
 
GORMAN: Please do.
 
HUNT: All right.
 
Let's turn now to this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
STEPHEN COLBERT, HOST, "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT": It's no secret how I feel about Trump's conviction. So, ethically and morally, I have to be consistent and say that, in light of this verdict, I don't believe Hunter Biden - should be president.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HUNT: Hunter Biden now awaiting sentencing after his felony gun conviction. Yesterday, a federal jury in Delaware found the president's son guilty on all three counts. Two for lying about his drug use on a federal background check, a third for possessing a gun while addicted to or using illegal drugs. The president embracing his newly convicted sound on a tarmac in Wilmington shortly after the verdict, 
 
Biden releasing this statement, "as I said last week, I'm the president, but I'm also a dad. Jill and I love our son and we're so proud of the man he is today." He added, "also, as I said last week, I will accept the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal." 
 
And, of course, this is the first time in American history the child of a sitting president has been convicted of a crime. 
 <br>[06:50:01]
 
Matt, Kate and Zolan are back with us. And we're also joined now by national political reporter for "Axios," Alex Thompson, who has been covering this trial day in and day out. 
 
Welcome. 
 
Alex, you've been, I think, in your hotel - may of our viewers may be familiar with your hotel room in Wilmington, so we're happy to have you here. 
 
THOMPSON: Me too.
 
HUNT: Look, this has been, for the Biden family, just, you know, the cliche would be airing dirty laundry, right, but he is the president of the United States. The events of this period of time, in Hunter Biden's life, and in the family's life are incredibly difficult. Now, he faces prison time. Probably unlikely he'll get it for this particular case. But it's all out there in the public. 
 
I mean, take us inside the room and kind of what it was like to watch this family go through this. 
 
THOMPSON: Yes, absolutely. It's simultaneously a family tragedy, but also sort of a love story too in which, you know, and in the room, you know, the jury barely - barely deliberated at all. It was like three hours and they came back with a guilty verdict. It was so short that actually much of the family wasn't even there for the actual reading of the guilty verdict. It was just Jimmy Biden, the president's brother, and - and his wife. Jill Biden was not there. Val Biden was not there. She hurried in basically right after the guilty verdict had been read. And basically the first lady came up and then went straight to the witness holding room and then went to Hunter and then, obviously, exited with him, holding his hand. 
 
Hunter Biden, when he heard the verdict, you know, he basically didn't move. He was like just a still portrait. And then right afterward, he just nodded his head three times as if, OK, let's move forward. He hugged his lawyers. He kissed his wife. And then just said, let's get on with it, the next thing.
 
And there's plenty of next things to go. Beyond appeals, which are definitely going to come, potentially on Second Amendment grounds. You also have another trial that, honestly, as messy as this one was, this one - the next one might be messier because when you're talking - dealing with a tax case, you're dealing with everything he was spending money on. 
 
HUNT: Yes, there's a lot there. 
 
Kate Bedingfield, I mean you, when you were working in the White House, had to grapple with a lot of this as it was unfolding in real time. And one of the things, you know, I think I hadn't quite realized was the level of guilt that the president seems to feel around what Hunter was going through then. It, obviously, coincide with a time when he was deciding that he was going to run for president of the United States. 
 
Can you kind of take us inside that a little bit? 
 
BEDINGFIELD: Yes. So, yes, there is an amount of guilt that President Biden feels. He obviously know that if he were not president, if he were not kind of front and center in our political conversation, Hunter probably would not be dealing with these legal challenges.
 
But it's also important to understand about that period of time when President Biden was deciding whether or not to run in 2019, that Hunter really encouraged him to run. And Hunter didn't want to be a reason that he didn't run for president. So, there was a lot of - you know, Alex called it a love story. There's, you know, there was a lot of mutual love there between the two of them. Both of them kind of looking out for each other personally and wanting the other - you know, wanting to do what was right for the other. So there's, you know, there are a lot of complicated feelings there,
 
 but, you know, at its core, a lot of love and a lot of respect. It is also incredibly difficult and challenging for the president, as it is for - I mean I think any American who has a family member who's struggled with addiction, it is a constant cloud that can hang over you. And, obviously, the president is enormously proud of how far Hunter has come and how he's fought to get to where he is today and, you know, protecting and preserving that progress that Hunter's made is really important to the Biden family.
 
ZOLAN KANO-YOUNGS, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, "THE NEW YORK TIMES": And we know today, in his story as well, that the president does still fully believed that Hunter can continue on this - on his road to - for recovery. But at the same time, given all the events going on, he is concerned about what the future holds for his son as well. I think that it's interesting that also you're seeing - and that's evident also in just the movement of the president yesterday. You saw him change his scheduled to go to Wilmington. You saw those images as well of him stepping off the plane, immediately embracing his son. 
 
I was in Delaware last weekend and thought it was interesting that they're - I mean every public appearance you saw him basically attached to Hunter Biden.
 
HUNT: Yes.
 
KANO-YOUNGS: Whether they were going to church together, or cycling together, as well. You've seen him really continue to embrace his son. And I think that will continue, as well as the language we saw from President Biden's statement when describing this case, when reacting to it. You're going to see him continue to sort of affirm his love for his son and, you know, continued to express empathy similar to that moment that we saw on the debate in 2020 when Trump was attacking - was going after Hunter Biden, and the president had one of his more memorable moments where he really stood there and said, look, I stand by my son and I - I do love him.
 
HUNT: Right. 
 
THOMPSON: And -- -- oh, sorry.
 
HUNT: No, no, go ahead.
 
THOMPSON: Just like the more down that, you know, the president's greatest fears is Hunter relapsing. And anyone knows that's been through, you know, family members with addiction, the biggest trigger for a relapse is shame, which is why you have Hunter always - or, sorry, Joe Biden always saying, I'm proud of my son, I'm proud of my son, and trying to show that I'm not embarrassed by you.
 <br>[06:55:09]
 
HUNT: Yes, what I was going to say was, they - I mean, when you're the president, you know, they - there are cameras for your ever every movement. But if they didn't want a picture of Joe Biden embracing Hunter Biden yesterday, they could have avoided it, right? KANO-YOUNGS: Right.
 
THOMPSON: Yes.
 
HUNT: Like, they did that on purpose.
 
THOMPSON: Yes. Well, and sometimes -
 
BEDINGFIELD: Absolutely. Absolutely.
 
THOMPSON: When I think sometimes like Joe Biden doesn't even really care about the optics. I mean I don't think having, you know, Hunter Biden at some of these state dinners, alongside Merrick Garland, is like the best political optics, but Joe Biden doesn't care. 
 
BEDINGFIELD: Yes. He's always - sorry to interrupt -
 
KANO-YOUNGS: (INAUDIBLE), go ahead.
 
BEDINGFIELD: But, yes, he is always going to put Hunter's first - Hunter first. He's always going to put his family first. And, yes, there are times when it's optics be damned, I love my son, and the most important thing to me is being a father.
 
GORMAN: I guess that's why, kind of considering everything we've said here, I am candidly skeptical if, win or lose, there's not - there's not a pardon in the future for every you just said, you know.
 
THOMPSON: Yes, you're not alone. There are people - there are people close to the president -
 
GORMAN: Yes.
 
THOMPSON: That even though he has said this - he has said this, you know, obviously very publicly, there's some people around him that think he could change his mind. 
 
HUNT: Yes, I mean could we - I think - do we have that - the interview with David Muir where President Biden said that he's not going to pardon his son?
 
All right, we don't have that. But, I mean, do - there is the looming question of this, Alex. And in this other trial as well, I mean, if he gets off on prison time in this, which many of our legal experts have said, look, like he's a first-time offender. It's unlikely that this gun thing could lead, even though there's a potential for 25 years, it's likely not to hit that. 
 
However, we were talking to a lawyer earlier on this program who said one of the things they could consider if there's a guilty verdict in the next case is that there will also then have been this prior conviction, which makes it much more likely - I find it very hard to believe that - that Joe Biden, the man, if he has the power to get his son out of prison, doesn't do it.
 
THOMPSON: Well, and as Kate was just saying, you know, Joe Biden feels responsible for some of this because you have to remember, when Joe Biden declared for president, Hunter Biden is still not in recovery yet, right? Joe Biden announces April of 2019, has his first rally on May - in May of 2019. Hunter Biden does not get sober until June of '19, 2019. And the thing is, if you're running for president, in this vicious political environment, with a son that has a crack cocaine addiction, you know that this is going to probably hurt his life potentially. And it really has. 
 
So, that's why I think, you know, that's why I think people, as you - as you sort of noted and insinuated, people close to the president thank he might ultimately change his mind because he feels guilty.
 
KANO-YOUNGS: Also, you referred to the ABC News interview. 
 
HUNT: Yes.
 
KANO-YOUNGS: He did say that he would not pardon his son. There is still the follow-up question of commutation as well. There's multiple forms of clemency. Could there be a sentence, you know, shortened or - or any sort of relief that way. That - I - would imagine that that question at some point the president will face it.
 
BEDINGFIELD: Yes.
 
Look, I will say, he - he loves his son unquestioningly. He also loves his country. And he also thinks that it is dangerous that we are in a moment where the rule of law is under attack, where our judicial system is under attack. And so I would say don't - don't underestimate how significant it is to him that a president needs to send a message that the justice system works, that he will not inappropriately put his thumb on the scale. 
 
So, I think, you know, let's see how things play out. But I would say, as somebody who knows Joe Biden very well, I would take him at his word that he believes that, you know, not sending a signal that he is going to interfere in the way the justice system plays out here is important and genuine.
 
HUNT: And it puts the hypocrisy of these Republicans on display. 
 
BEDINGFIELD: Absolutely.
 
HUNT: I just have to say.
 
BEDINGFIELD: Absolutely.
 
HUNT: The hypocrisy. The way that they're handling this Hunter thing. They're basically saying, well, it's totally not the same. 
 
GORMAN: Well, I'm sorry. Like, you mean, as Trump - 
 
HUNT: Republican politicians are looking at, you know, when they - when we've asked them and they've responded to this, they're, you know, the speaker of the House, for example, said, every case is different. The evidence was overwhelming in the Hunter case. But that's not the case in the Trump trials, right? GORMAN: Yes, I mean, look, I think it, at the end of the day, wading, if you're a Republican politician, into the Hunter stuff is not going to win you any votes. Let the - let the process play out. But I - I am very keen to see - I do think, if there's a pardon, I think that could change things. 
 
HUNT: All right. Thank you, guys, for that conversation. 
 
I will leave you with this.
