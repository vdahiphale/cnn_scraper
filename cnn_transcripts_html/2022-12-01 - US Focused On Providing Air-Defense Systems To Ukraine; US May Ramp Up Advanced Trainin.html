PAULA NEWTON, CNN ANCHOR: Hello, everyone. I'm Paula Newton. Ahead right here on CNN Newsroom, Ukraine says it needs more weapons from the west and fast. But with stockpiles running low it may need to rely on more arms from the Soviet era. China claims it's entering a new stage of COVID controls hoping to calm public anger and anti-lockdown protests. And heavy rains trigger flash floods and landslides in Brazil leaving dozens missing and a huge mess behind.
 
Ukraine is calling on NATO to supply the country with everything needed to defeat Russia's invasion as quickly as possible. Ukrainian foreign minister delivered the message in-person, Wednesday, on the second day of talks between NATO foreign ministers in Bucharest. Now, he thanked the block for pledging more aid to Ukraine, including for its energy infrastructure, which of course has been heavily damaged by weeks now of Russian attacks.
 
And Ukraine welcomed additional military aid including armored vehicles, artillery, and, of course, those all important winter uniforms. America's top diplomat, meantime, Antony Blinken, tells CNN the US is very focused on providing air defense systems to Kyiv. The Ukraine's foreign minister says there is one specific system they need more than all others. Listen.

DMYTRO KULEBA, UKRAINIAN FOREIGN MINISTER: The message is simple, give Patriot as soon as you can. Because this is the system that Ukraine needs to protect its civilian, civilian population and critical infrastructure. This is not an offensive weapon.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NEWTON: So almost as important as obtaining the weapons is knowing how to use them effectively. Up to now, US training on those kinds of battlefield tactics has been quite limited but that could soon change. CNN's Oren Lieberman has our report.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The White House is considering a proposal that would see the US dramatically expand the training of Ukrainian forces with as many as 2,500 soldiers per month trained. Now this, if approved, would be far greater than the training that's currently going on in terms of scope, scale and the complexity of what the US is trying to accomplish.
 
Since the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, US training of Ukrainian forces has been in small groups and focused on individual systems. So for example, 60 or so troops would be trained on how to use the HIMARS rocket launcher or the NASAMS air defense system. This, again, if approved, would see that dramatically expand to hundreds or load thousands of soldiers at a time. And not just on an individual system but on how to fight as a cohesive unit.
 
So for example, how to make artillery work with infantry, work with tanks and fight cohesively to achieve an advantage on the battlefield. And that's one of the big goals here. If approved, this training would take place at Grafenwoehr where the US conducts its own combined arms training of US Army forces in both Europe and Africa, this according to multiple officials who've been briefed and are familiar with the plans here.
 
Now, an administration official says the White House is looking at how to ramp up the current training efforts and turn that into this larger scale effort. Now, it's not the only country that's looking at doing this sort of training. The UK has, since summer, made it its goal to train 10,000 Ukrainian soldiers. But there's a fundamental difference here. That's more basic training for soldiers that don't have much experience on the front lines. This goes well-beyond that trying to teach an army, or large parts of an army at the battalion level, how to fight as a cohesive unit to gain an advantage against Russia.
 
What about the timing? Well, this may be the perfect time for that, as winter sets in with a slowdown in fighting there. This potentially is an opportunity for Ukraine to pull some soldiers off the frontline, out of combat and send them out of country to gain this training so they can go back in and achieve the success they're looking for off of those counter offensives that we've seen taking place in Eastern and Southern Ukraine. Oren Liebermann, CNN in the Pentagon.

NEWTON: Cedric Leighton is a CNN military analyst, a retired US Air Force colonel. He joins us now from Washington. Good to see you. I really need your opinion on this, what is the danger you think in the months ahead? Given the first issue, which is the seemingly relentless drawdown of weapons from the US and other NATO countries, you know, as this war continues to draw down on more and more stockpiles and equipment.
 
CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes. Paula, that's one of the big issues that's confronting the entire Western alliance, because the defense industrial base, as it's known of all these countries, the NATO countries in Europe as well as the United States and Canada, it's really not built for this kind of war. And that very fact has made it really difficult for the West to resupply Ukraine. Ukraine is using weapons at a very high rate. It's using ammunition of course as part of this. And then the other thing that we're confronted with is the barrels of the various artillery pieces are overheating because of overuse. So that's a major issue for the Ukrainians and for the West, especially if the West wants to continue to help the Ukrainian and help the Ukrainian stop the Russians.
 
NEWTON: You know, Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke to CNN's Christiane Amanpour about the option we were just talking about, right, possibly resuscitating Soviet era weapons systems. I never thought it would hear this after hearing for more than three decades, that the West wanted these Eastern European countries to modernize their military. But I want you to listen to them now, we'll talk on the back end.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANTONY BLINKEN, US SECRETARY OF STATE: We're looking at every option to make sure that, again, they get what they need and what can be most effective for them. Some of that does go to Soviet era systems that they've had in their inventory for decades, and for example, making sure that the ammunition is there for those systems.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NEWTON: So, colonel, does this strike you as a good strategic option or more of a sign of desperation that, you know, there has been a study the most recent from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and found that it would take years to replenish these stocks given that, as you say, the industrial military complex is designed for peace. I mean, does it strike you as desperate or a creative idea?
 
LEIGHTON: Somewhat creative in the sense that the Ukrainians, of course, have had to Soviet era weapon systems ever since they gained their or regained their independence in 1991. So they're used to this, they've been trained on this, and even if they've had a break in service you between their initial military service and their call up for this war, they're so familiar with these weapons systems. So in that sense, it makes sense to do that.
 
But on the other hand, these systems are old. They are not as effective as their western counterparts, especially the modern Western counterparts. And the Ukrainians would be better served if they could receive the Western systems, and they could be trained on them. So that's a big end. But that is one of the key things that would need to happen in this case.
 
So I think that requires a lot of creative solutions, using the old Soviet equipment but also ramping up the training for modern Western equivalent to be used by the Ukrainians themselves.
 
NEWTON: Right. I see like a two track approach that you're talking about, I'm going to lean on your expertise here because we all remember at the start of this war that Ukraine asked for that no-fly- zone that they didn't get. Now, you say it's now highly likely that these new air defense systems that they get maybe, could potentially have a truly integrated air and missile defense system in place for Ukraine. Do you think, though, that it will come soon enough given everything you've seen on the battlefield?
 
LEIGHTON: Yes. That's my biggest concern, Paula, actually, that they won't come soon enough. So this requires not only the logistical piece to move forward but also the training piece to move forward. And, you know, we do understand that the US is working in conjunction with the Ukrainians and with NATO partners, especially Germany, to train a much greater volume of Ukrainians on a Western systems.
 
So if that happens, it can be done but it also requires the Ukrainians to leave their country and leave their fighting posts in order to come in, get some training and then come back. So it's a bit of a tough haul and it's certainly very concerning. And basically, the clock is running out in multiple directions. And that's going to be a really big problem for the West, for the Ukrainians and really for the world.
 
NEWTON: Yes. You really have laid bare the challenges ahead on what will continue, will be for certain a tough winter. Colonel Leighton, thanks so much.
 
LEIGHTON: You bet, Paula. Thank you.
 
NEWTON: Meantime, there's a new international effort to hold Russia accountable for its war on Ukraine. The president of the European Commission is proposing a new court to investigate and prosecute Russia for its aggression and cruelty.
 <br>[01:10:07]
 
Ursula von der Leyen says Moscow and its oligarchs must cover the costs of rebuilding Ukraine estimated now more than $600 billion and compensate for the damage caused. Now specifically she referred to the horrors of Bucha where alleged evidence of Russian war crimes against civilians shocked the world in the early months of this war.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
URSULA VON DER LEYEN, PRESIDENT, EUROPEAN COMMISSION: Russia must pay for its horrific crimes, including for its crime of aggression against a sovereign state. And this is why while continuing to support the International Criminal Court. We are proposing to set up a specialized court backed by the United Nations to investigate and prosecute Russia's crime of aggression.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NEWTON: Now, Ukraine has welcomed the EU's court proposal calling it exactly what they have been waiting for. Now, Ukraine is stepping up security at its embassies worldwide after a letter bomb exploded Wednesday at its embassy in Madrid. Spanish officials say a Ukrainian employee was slightly injured. The letter was addressed to Ukraine's ambassador to Spain. A separate letter bomb was also delivered to a company that reportedly made some of the weapons Spain has sent to Ukraine. A device was safely deactivated. The Spanish official says the second envelope apparently came from Ukraine and investigators believe that may be the case with the first one as well. She says both letters had the same return address.
 
And we go to China now which may be ready to make some adjustments to its zero COVID policy. Beijing's top COVID response official says the country is entering a new stage and mission in controlling the pandemic. Some of the more notable changes are happening in the southern metropolis of Guangzhou, which has seen days of protests. The man who shot this video, in fact, is yelling unsealed as authorities removed those blue and orange barricades.
 
The city is lifting lockdowns in some areas ending district wide mass testing, and letting some close contacts of COVID patients isolate at home rather than in quarantine facilities. And there are now similar reports of those kinds of moves in Shanghai as well, where there's obtained video from that city showing people pushing and shoving police in hazmat suits although it's not clear when this footage was actually recorded.
 
CNN has in fact been able to verify at least 20 protests in 15 different cities right across China since the weekend.
 
Now for more on all this, we want to bring in our Anna Coren, who has been tracking developments in the region. And, Anna, how much is this a subtle move or will it be more pronounced? I mean, to see Chinese officials move at all on what has been, you know, literally three years and counting on a zero COVID policy is actually quite extraordinary.
 
ANNA COREN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It is. It would seem, Paula, that they are relenting, you know, in the face of these week long protests. But, you know, perhaps we're getting a little bit ahead of ourselves. They can relax these measures and then reimpose them, you know, if numbers continued to rise, or there's a dramatic spike.
 
Case numbers at the moment hovering around 35,000, you know, across China. Once upon a time, you know, that would be unthinkable considering they locked down major cities of millions of people for, you know, 150 cases. But certainly the indication that we're getting from some pretty senior Chinese officials is that the government has realized it does need to relax. It's very draconian measures that, as you say, have been in place for almost three years.
 
We heard from the vice premier of the Pandemic Containment, and she said that the approach needs to be human-centered, basically saying that we have to be more thoughtful to help people feeling and coping. And as we just saw those scenes, you know, people celebrated being able to ride through the streets that have normally been barricaded or locked down, yelling, you know, unsealed, where we have been unsealed.
 
And we heard from the Global Times, this is an editorial mouthpiece really for the Chinese government. And it's cited data from the United States, from here in Hong Kong and from China saying basically that this strain is less virulent. Let me read it to you. Compared with the original strain of the new coronavirus, the pathogenicity and virulence of the new coronavirus, Omicron mutant strain, have been greatly reduced. This reminds us that we don't have to panic too much about Omicron. For the general population under the protection of vaccines, the new coronavirus is not as harmful to the human body as before.
 <br>[01:15:10]
 
I mean, Paula, these words have never come out of the mouth of Chinese officials. You know, it would have only been a few weeks ago that China was celebrating its zero COVID strategy saying that it's managed to protect the population. And we have to remember that 90% of Chinese people have been vaccinated, received two shots. For the people who are over 80, it's more like 66%.
 
The problem that China faces is that Sinovac, which is the local vaccine, is not as effective as what we receive elsewhere in the world. Hence, authorities have been concerned that they won't be able to deal with a wave of COVID and that it will could wipe out, you know, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people. That was, you know, the numbers that were being bandied around.
 
But in light of these protests which, you know, we have not seen this in China for a generation. This has obviously rattled the government, it's been unable to censor the videos, the dissent, the angst that we have seen in the videos leaking out of China. And they realize that they've had to relax these measures. We're seeing this not just in Guangzhou, in Shanghai, in Chongqing, as well as in Beijing.
 
People have had enough, Paula, and unless the government relents, people will continue to take to the streets and protest.
 
NEWTON: And yet, and does this also go against what is unfortunately a medical reality that, as you just pointed out, the vaccine has not been as effective and that China's public health care system is not equipped to deal with, you know, an overwhelming wave of Omicron, even if it is less virulent.
 
COREN: Yes, absolutely. I mean, those more virulent strains of COVID, experts were saying that millions of people could die in China. And that is what the Chinese authorities, what Xi Jinping, who is the commander in chief in the fight against this pandemic, what they fear most is that there is mass deaths, mass protests in response to that. Well, the protests are happening on the streets now and the government, which has the best censoring apparatus in the world cannot stop these videos from leaking.
 
And basically, they know that to try and ease people's concerns, try and to stop that angst and dissent, they need to act. And look, this is piecemeal, right? You're talking about removing roadblocks. You're basically seeing some lockdowns ease in some cities. This is not saying, you know, complete end to China's zero COVID strategy. But they are taking steps we'll have to see, you know, how the population reacts. NEWTON: Yes. It is a very good point you make. It is by no means going to be a no holds barred. There will still be those restrictions as you said. It is likely subtle moves that are being made here. Anna Coren, thanks so much for that update. Really appreciate it.
 
Now, Russia is stepping up its crackdown on what it calls LGBTQ propaganda. Moscow sees it as a broader battle against the West. We'll explain why. Plus, from worse to first, Argentina survived the group stage and hopes of Lionel Messi winning a World Cup, yes, still alive.
 <br>[01:20:55]
 
NEWTON: To the World Cup now where a make or break match broke millions of hearts in Mexico on Wednesday. Despite beating Saudi Arabia, 2-1, Mexico failed to advance to the knockout stage for the first time since 1978 losing to Poland on goal differential. Meantime, Tunisia added to the string of major upsets defeating defending World Champs France, 1-0. But Les Bleus still ended up first in Group D.
 
And Australia defied the odds and secured their spot and the round of 16 after overcoming Denmark, 1-0. This is only the second time the soccer ruse, I love saying that, made it this far in the tournament.
 
And finally a big sigh of relief for Argentina who defeated Poland decisively and are heading to the knockouts despite their dismal start to this tournament. CNN's Don Riddell has more.
 
DON RIDDELL, CNN WORLD SPORT: Argentina arrived here in Qatar as one of the World Cup favorites. But for their fans, it has been a roller coaster of emotions. They lost their opening match. They were stunned by Saudi Arabia. But since then, back to back wins including a 2-0 victory against Poland, here a steady of 974 means that they are surging into the round of 16.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
RIDDELL (voice-over): This is Lionel Messi's fifth World Cup tournament and it's expected to be his last, but he's finding it difficult in Qatar. He was given a penalty against Poland but it was well saved by the keeper. Argentina deserved something from the game though they were by far the more positive team and they were rewarded very early in the second half when Alexis McAllister scored, and then Julian Alvarez made the game safe for Argentina, 2-0 the final score.
 
Poland also managed to squeak through as the second place team but the night belonged to Argentina and their jubilant fans.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We started low and after the victory last game and this one will really make a different. Now, the spirit you can hear the spirit is back again. So we are confident that Argentina came back to be a candidate.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Very excited. Very, very excited. My god, round of 16 now, you know where (inaudible), you know where Messi is.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It' a very nice game, very nice. This is Argentina. This is Argentina. We go for you, England. We go for you, France. And the final match, we go for your Brazil.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
RIDDELL: Argentina's next game will be against Australia, the Socceroos have only ever played one World Cup knockout game that was back in 2006, a heartbreaking defeat to Italy. Now, the Azzurri went on to win the title that year. So if Argentina can win their next game, it could be a really good omen for them. Back to you.
 
NEWTON: Our thanks to Don. Our thanks to Don who always gives us great stuff from the crowds there, OK.
 
We're in Group F now, we can expect this in the coming hours. Canada will face Morocco, even though they've already been knocked out and the 2018 runner up Croatia will take on world number two, Belgium. In the match, the Belgians absolutely have to win to avoid an early exit.
 
Now we go to Group E. We'll see Spain and go up against Japan who triumphed over Germany in their opener. And Germany must beat Costa Rica in order to even have a chance of moving ahead in this tournament. Hard to believe.
 
And that upcoming Germany vs. Costa Rica match will feature a first for the Men's World Cup, which is an all woman team of referees. Their head ref will be France's Stephanie Frappart to was the first woman to officiate a UEFA Men's Champions League match two years ago. She'll be joined by assistants from Brazil and Mexico, previously told CNN she doesn't think about breaking barriers or making history and is just focused on doing her job.
 
Now, Russia is one step away from formally expanding its ban on what the government calls LGBT propaganda. The Upper House of Parliament passed the controversial bill Wednesday and now it just needs President Vladimir Putin signature. As Fred Pleitgen reports, the Kremlin is framing the move as part of a larger battle with the West.
 <br>[01:25:04]
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
FRED PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: For years being gay has been extremely tough in Russia, now it's about to get even harder. After Russian parliament passed what it calls the LGBT Propaganda Law, claiming in part it's a defense against US influence.
 
VYACHESLAV VOLODIN, RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT SPEAKER (through translation): We cannot put it any other way, the United States of America has become the global center of this sodomy. Let them live there. Do not touch us.
 
PLEITGEN: Anti-gay tirades are often embedded into coverage of what Russia called its special military operation in Ukraine on state TV, making the war out to be part of a larger battle of Russia against the West, it's alleged moral decay. Yaroslav Rasputin, a gay rights activist in Moscow says he feels singled out. YAROSLAV RASPUTIN, GAY RIGHTS ACTIVIST (through translation): This is the information noise that we're becoming victims of. We're being used as scapegoats to distract attention and redirect the hatred of the electorate that supports Putin and the war.
 
PLEITGEN: Russian President Vladimir Putin often portrays himself as the savior of traditional family values, even equating Western LGBTQ freedoms to devil worshipping
 
VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translation): Such a total denial of a human being, a rejection of faith and traditional values, suppression of freedom begins to look like a perverted religion outright Satanism.
 
PLEITGEN: The new law bans praise of what the government considers non-traditional sexual relationships or otherwise suggesting those relationships are "normal." But LGBT activist Renat Davletgildeev who has fled the country says the law will essentially make it illegal to be openly gay in Russia.
 
RENAT DAVLETGILDEEV, LGBT ACTIVIST (through translation): The only text that I can now show publicly according to the law in Russia, in my social network on the street in a newspaper or in a movie is gays are outlawed, gays are bad, and lesbians should be in jail.
 
PLEITGEN: Not a single Russian legislator voted against the bill. Punishment includes fines up to thousands of dollars for individuals. Foreigners could be jailed for up to 15 days and deported.
 
Vladimir Komov heads an organization providing legal aid to the LGBTQ community, and he fears the lawyers might soon be targeted as well with significant fines for legal entities.
 
VLADIMIR KOMOV, HEAD OF DELO LGBT (through translation): There are fears among lawyers that if they defend political cases like rallies or alleged gay propaganda, this may be turned against them in the future.
 
PLEITGEN: But activists and lawyers fear that even more of Russia's LGBTQ community will come to the conclusion that their only way to live openly will be to flee the country. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Moscow.

NEWTON: Some sad news, legendary singer songwriter Christine McVie of the rock band Fleetwood Mac has died. No cause of death was given but a family statement says she died following a brief illness. McVie was also the group's keyboardist and the song writing force behind many of Fleetwood Mac's best known hits. And that includes "Say You Love Me, "Over My Head," and "Little Lies." And believe me, I am only naming a few.
 
The band released a statement saying in part, "She was the best musician anyone could have in their band and the best friend anyone could have in their life." Christine McVie was 79 years old.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[01:31:14] 
 
NEWTON: You are watching CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Paula Newton. 
 
At least two people are dead in southern Brazil after heavy rain triggered a landslide. It cut off access to two ports, one of which is the second largest in Brazil for sugar and grain shipments. 
 
Authorities believe several vehicles and trailers are buried in mud on a highway with as many as 50 people possibly missing. Flash flooding has also been reported in the region.
 
Meteorologist Derek Van Dam joins us with more. And you know, the picture speaks for themselves. And obviously, the fact that so much seems to have been swept down this mountain. 
 
DEREK VAN DAM, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Yes, Paula, look at this. This truck is literally dangling off the side of this mountain slope. 
 
This is just such a vulnerable area. Anyone that lives at the base of a steep terrain or steep mountainside has the potential to see landslides. I did a bit of research on this and a study on landslides in 2007 stated that the most vulnerable locations are inclines of about 10 degrees to 30 degrees, right. and this definitely qualifies for that. 
 
So about 82 percent of landslides occur within that slope of the angle. So add in the heavy rainfall and, of course, you've got problems. 
 
Now, the Brazilian meteorological agency highlighted on Wednesday the southern portions of the country to experience flash flooding. The highest likelihood of flash flooding as well as landslide possibility.
 
The heavy rain just soaked into the soil. Gravity ultimately won. And we saw that landslide which, by the way, picked up all of the debris in its path. It has the potential to pick up boulders, trees, dirt, mud. And on top of that, of course washing away anything in its path. 
 
And by the way it can travel upwards with speeds of 300 kilometers per hour depending on the environment and the situation. Incredible amounts of moisture just associated with this system. Over 150 millimeters in a 24-hour period. 
 
Of course, climatologically speaking, we are entering the rainy season in this part of Brazil. And you can just see the rainfall still expected to continue although lighter at times. We won't want to see any more rain on top of what has already fallen here for the search and recovery efforts, Paula.
 
NEWTON: Yes. Absolutely not. Keeping our fingers crossed for those efforts. 
 
Derek, thank you so much. Now as we reported earlier, Beijing suggested on Wednesday, it had a
 
 new mission for controlling COVID-19 perhaps indicating some potential adjustments to its controversial zero COVID strategy.
 
Several cities are already lifting their COVID lockdowns and that includes Zhengzhou. It's home to the world's largest iPhone factory owned by Foxconn where employees revolted over the past few weeks over working conditions and COVID restrictions.
 
CNN's Selina Wang has our report. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SELINA WANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Anger boiled over into violent protests at the world's largest iPhone factory. Workers streamed out of Foxconn factory dorm in central China. 
 
Protesting unfair treatment, dirty living conditions and chaotic COVID rules at the Apple supplier. 
 
Videos obtained by CNN show a group of police in white hazmat suits beating workers with batons and metal rods. 
 
"The police are hitting people", a worker shouts in the video. A Foxconn employee at the protest told CNN, the scene turned into a river of blood. Police hit the workers ruthlessly. 
 <br>[01:34:48]
 
WANG: Earlier, squadrons of riot police had rolled in. "They are going to start beating us," protesters yelled in fear, facing off rows of law enforcement with riot gear. 
 
The protests escalated into the evening, workers tearing down COVID barriers using metal beams against police. 
 
Masses of them hurling metal parts towards law enforcement, even using a COVID barrier as a shield against rows of authorities. They worked together to push over a police car, cheering and chanting. 
 
Since October, the Foxconn plant has been sealed off from the outside world after a COVID outbreak that forced employees to live and work on site and what videos obtained by CNN show are filthy conditions. Garbage piling up in the hallway. The factory plunged into chaos. Videos showed workers scrambling, fighting to get enough food and supplies. Then came the exodus. Masses of workers walked miles along highways to escape the plant. 
 
Analysts estimate this factory produces more than half of Apple's iPhones. Apple already warned customers they will need to wait even longer to get their new products because of China's COVID lockdowns. 
 
So to attract workers, Foxconn promised higher pay and bonuses. New workers signed up. But when they got to the factory, the pay package was worse than what Foxconn advertised. A Foxconn employee said workers felt cheated, leading to thousands of
 
 people protesting. Foxconn later blamed the payment discrepancy on a quote, "technical error". And said text messages to workers offering to pay them $1,400 to quit and go. 
 
Soon after, videos showed long lines of workers boarding buses to leave the factory. Their departure possibly putting an end to another violent and dramatic scene but increasing the pressure on Apple. It's just the latest victim of China's zero COVID policy.

NEWTON: Elon Musk has been put on alert. Just ahead, the European Union tells Twitter's new owner the platform needs huge changes to comply with a new law. Will it conflict with Musk's new version of the site.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
NEWTON: The European Union's digital chief warns Elon Musk that Twitter needs, quote, "huge work", or could face penalties including fines. 
 
In a meeting with E.U. officials on Wednesday, Musk was advised that the company would need to comply with a new Digital Services Act, or it could face billions in fines. Musk agreed apparently to a so-called stress test of the Website early next year, which would give Twitter the opportunity to make any needed changes. 
 <br>[01:39:49]
 
NEWTON: Musk has been met with a less than stellar, shall we say, welcome by some after his purchase of Twitter, due to reinstating suspended accounts and relaxing the enforcement of Twitter's terms of service. 
 
For more on this, we want to bring in Mike Isaac. He's a technology correspondent for the "New York Times". And he joins me now from San Francisco. 
 
Shall we say never a dull moment. I just actually had to check Elon Musk's Twitter feed, to make sure we weren't missing anything, when we started this conversation. 
 
I want to get to that threat from the E.U. I mean how serious of a threat does this pose to Elon Musk and Twitter. And, you know, his feed if you look at it is full of references to free speech. But the E.U. for one is holding him to responsibilities to moderate content, you know, reminding him there is no First Amendment here. Free speech comes with responsibilities. 
 
MIKE ISAAC, TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT, "NEW YORK TIMES": That's right. Well, unfortunately I have to check his Twitter feed more times a day than I'd like to. I'm right there with you. And I have more than once been surprised, right before I'm about to do an interview, so it's good practice. 
 
But I think -- I think you're exactly right, you know, he got -- Elon Musk has come in with this sort of free speech maximalist idea of what Twitter should be. And that means essentially reining in a lot of the policies of Twitter of old. 
 
You know, content moderation -- he basically fired off a lot of the content moderation of people that were there, and you know, compliance with E.U. laws, which are going to be more stringent in 2024, when the DSA, the Digital Services Act is really sort of put into place. 
 
So I think this was kind of a wake up call from (INAUDIBLE) just to say, look, you need to hire the right people in order to comply with these laws. And we're kind of giving you a warning, so we don't have to come down and bring the hammer down.
 
NEWTON: Yes. And, by the way, the E.U. is not the only jurisdiction that is looking at this kind of enforcement. 
 
And recently, we had, you know, the COVID, the issue over whether or not medical content on COVID, let's say, was going to be moderated.
 
You know, I also have to point out though that people like U.S. Congressman Troy, now who is in fact a Republican tweeted that the E.U. was threatening to ban Twitter, unless Musk censors it, in his words. 
 
You know, is this setting up for a political fight? And is Elon Musk be as transparent to say he wants Twitter to be, let's say on the right, more politically, or even more libertarian. 
 
ISAAC: Right. I mean, it's a fascinating tug-of-war, especially in the United States. You know, conservatives and Republicans have been -- really have been using tech companies like Twitter and Facebook, as kind of a cudgel for a while, basically saying, if you don't give us unmitigated free speech, meaning basically little to no content moderation whatsoever, we are threatening you with regulation that could potentially harm the company long-term, their bottom line. 
 
And you know, Mark Zuckerberg resisted that to some degree for a while with his content moderation operation. But Elon seems more amenable to conservatives point of view here, essentially.
 
And I think he also is recognizing that, if he want Twitter to operate in every country around the world or as many possible, he's going to have to make some compromises that before he came in to owning the company, he didn't think he was going to make some -- 
 
And so that's why I think he had a call today with you know, E.U. officials, that was a little more, I guess sensible on both sides. 
 
NEWTON: I want to get your take just on the broader outlook though here for Twitter. I mean in terms of the platform, perhaps being or continuing to be a global public good is it bad is it a menace? Especially if you take out these elements of moderation.
 
ISAAC: You know, I've really struggled for a long time with the effects of social media. Is it an unmitigated good. Is it an unmitigated bad. I think weirdly enough I agree with Mark Zuckerberg on this, and that there is no real clear cut answer to me, I think it has both good and ill for the world, and think it's a lot about sort of figuring about how much of that you're willing to live with and how much each country can sort of rein in the negative effects of social media, you know.
 
And if there's a point at which those effects are too negative, you know, whether that's the spread of random misinformation around COVID, or other illnesses. Then it's up to people to decide, maybe, this is not worth it. 
 
You know, right now, at least in the United States, they haven't reached that point, obviously COVID is politicized here, unfortunately.
 
ISAAC: But I think at some point, you know, folks are starting to sort of -- you're going to sort of decide, whether they think they should continue to exist in its current form, or if they should look much more reined in or different in the future. 
 <br>[01:44:55]
 
NEWTON: Yes, and what Elon Musk's involvement will be at that point with this platform. 
 
A lot to think about there Mike, after your perspective, really appreciate it.
 
ISAAC: Thanks for having me.
 
NEWTON: Now, Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives have chosen Hakeem Jeffries to succeed Nancy Pelosi as their leader next year. They will make Jeffries the first black leader of one of two major political parties in the U.S. Congress and that in fact signifies a major generational shift.
 
CNN's Eva McKend filed this introduction. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
EVA MCKEND, CNN NATIONAL POLITICS REPORTER: After nearly a decade on Capitol Hill, Brooklyn-bred attorney Hakeem Jeffries making history as House Democrats selected him as the first black American to lead a party in Congress. 
 
REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY): I stand on the shoulders of people like Shirley Chisholm and so many others, as we work to advance the ball for everyday Americans and get stuff done. Because that's what Democrats do.
 
MCKEND: And 52, Jeffries ascension marks a generational change from 82-year-old outgoing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. 
 
JEFFRIES: We're going to work hard -- 
 
MCKEND: Jeffries became Democratic Caucus Chair in 2019, and has long been known for his advocacy around affordable housing and criminal justice reform. Working across the aisle in 2019, to get the first Step Act passed. 
 
JEFFRIES: We look forward to finding opportunities, to partner with the other side of the aisle, and work with them. Whenever possible. But we will also push back against extremism, whenever necessary. 
 
MCKEND: But, it was his role as an impeachment manager, during former President Donald Trump's first impeachment trial, that was among Jeffries -- highlighting his background as a lawyer and his penchant for weaving in the legacy of hip-hop. 
 
JEFFRIES: That is why we are here, Mr. Sekulow. And if you don't know, now you know. 
 
JEFFRIES: One of my constituents, the congressman the shouted out biggest malls on the house floor two weeks ago, I said yes that was me. And now I hear, that you're the number five Democrat in the House of Representatives. How did that happen?
 
And the only way that I can respond is by throwing the Biggie Small which is, you never thought that hip hop would take a (INAUDIBLE).
 
And so I think that Biggie Small's daisies, in many ways you know, is Trump is judge by of the ail Rachel quoting taps the sort of the aspirational aspect of the American dream. 
 
MCKEND: A former long-time staffer suggest Jeffries will pose a formidable challenge to Republicans.
 
MICHAEL HARDAWAY, FORMER HAKEEM JEFFRIES COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: He has a mind like a computer. He's absolutely brilliant and so he remembers every single detail of everything for all the species we never write a speeches out. We pull together the substance and he could just go and speak for 45 minutes. 
 
MCKEND: And argued he's the right man for this moment. 
 
HARDAWAY: In 2015, I said to him, I said, you're going to be the next speaker of the House because the reality of all party is that we have this old factory that was destined to leave at some point and he came with the guy that could best articulate what we stood for. And we now live in an area where that matters more than most other things. 
 
JEFFRIES: Can't stop.
 
CROWD: Won't stop.
 
MCKEND: But Jeffreys will have to contend with the left wing of the Party, who view him as part of the establishment and poised to take the mantle with the Democratic minority. MICHAEL ERIC DYSON, PROFESSOR, VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY: As the great philosopher for Grace Jones said, I may not be perfect but I'm perfect for you. 
 
So for those who claims he's not progressive enough, there are far less progressive people who could stand in his stead and try to occupy his space.
 
He's as progressive a figure as it is capable of securing the broad base of the Democratic Party, in order to represent them. 
 
MCKEND: Eva McKend, CNN -- Atlanta.

NEWTON: The Biden White House is pulling out all the stops, for Thursday's state dinner with the president and first lady of France. But, before that happens, the two leaders have a lot of tough issues they will try and work through. 
 
We'll have details on those, just ahead.

NEWTON: For the first time ever, a Finnish prime minister is visiting New Zealand. Sanna Marin met with Jacinda Ardern in Auckland with both leaders reaffirming the need for global support for Ukraine. They also welcomed a U.N. fact finding mission to investigate human rights abuses in Iran.
 
But one reporter's question seemed to miss the mark. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A lot of people will be wondering are you to meeting just because you are similar in age and, you know, got a lot of, you know, common stuff. When you got into politics and stuff, what can (INAUDIBLE) actually speak to say more deals between our two countries down the line because there is -- 
 
JACINDA ARDERN, NEW ZEALAND PRIME MINISTER: My first question, I wonder whether or now anyone ever asked Barack Obama and (INAUDIBLE) if they met because they were of similar age. 
 
We of course have a high proportion of men in politics. It's reality. Because two women meet, it's not simply because of their gender. 
 
SANNA MARIN, FINNISH PRIME MINISTER: Yes. We are meeting because we are prime ministers, of course. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NEWTON: That was blunt. Marin is 37 years-old. Ardern is 42. The Finnish prime minister says she is focused on the coronavirus pandemic, the energy crisis in Europe and trade with New Zealand.
 
And reporters are free to write about whatever they want. 
 
Now, Britain's royal family is again embroiled in allegations of racism. Buckingham Palace confirms a longtime member of the household apologized and has stepped down for allegedly grilling a black woman about her heritage at a royal reception on Tuesday. That woman was the CEO of assisted space. It is a charity that helps domestic abuse victims. 
 
And even though she was born in Britain, she says the palace aide repeatedly asked her where she was from. She said the exchange was deeply unsettling. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
NGOZI FULANI, CEO, SUSAN STAGE: When you go into Buckingham Palace, you are searched quite rightly to protect the people that are in there. But they're not  myself. What protection was there for me? Against this kind of racism. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NEWTON: The British media have identified the palace member as LABC's heart he is PRINCE WILLIAM'S godmother in fact and served for decades as lady in waiting to the late Queen Elizabeth.
 
Now, the racism controversy is casting a shadow over the visit by the new Prince and Princess of Wales to the United States. They arrived in s Boston Wednesday on their first trip to the U.S. Since the death of queen elizabeth. 
 
The trips focus is founded and we'll bet you meant to be on the earth shot prize. An environmental honor Prince founded and will present Friday. 
 
CNN royal correspondent Max Foster has more now from Boston

MAX FOSTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: A pretty wet welcome for the prince and princess of Wales here in what Pretty pet welcome and for a three day Wales n the to the 21st Coston for a three-day visit. Culminating in the earth shot prize giving, which is about finding solutions to the climate crisis. 
 
In financing those solutions with some big prize money as well. Described as Prince William's Super Bowl moment really. In the meantime, they are getting to know the city. They were here at city hall, in lit up green to start the celebrations. They went to a Boston Celtics game as well. 
 
We will see them out and about in the city, trying to get to know as much as possible. The emphasis really on climate and some of the other interests the couples have. And want to express really whilst they are here. The Loving
 
 conversation has been. A guest as batting and  overshadowed by this race back in London. A guest at Buckingham Palace grilled about her heritage, people repeating that she was from the U.K. but a senior royal aide asking where from Africa they were from, whether people are from and it was very awkward entertaining and that senior royal aide has had to step down and an investigation is underway. 
 
We will wait to hear the results of that investigation.

NEWTON: Now France's president and first lady we'll be feted Thursday evening at the first official state dinner of the Biden administration. Day one of the Macron visit ended Wednesday with a night at a private dinner with the Biden's at a Washington restaurant. They look cozy don't they. 
 
President Macron and President Biden will get down to brass tacks on Thursday with a host of sensitive issues and that of course includes Ukraine, China and Bilateral trade all on the agenda. 
 
CNN's Melissa Bell has more. 
 <br>[01:54:58]
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It was the first state visit of the Trump presidency. 
 
An attempted bromance in desperate search of common ground. 
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I'll get that when (INAUDIBLE).
 
BELL: A visit anchored by the traditional pomp and pageantry that will also mark the first state visit of the Biden administration. 
 
PHILLIPPE ETIENNE, FRENCH AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S.: This time, I will say that the context is not the same. Because we have the war in Ukraine, the Russian invasion and many, many crisis more than in 2018. 
 
BELL: Among them, the climate and energy crises, areas for cooperation in theory given the two presidents' more natural chemistry and their shared commitment to multilateralism. 
 
But the sailing since Biden's election has not been as smooth as Europeans had imagined. 
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I'm honored today to be joined by two of America's closest allies, Australia and the United Kingdom. BELL: With France blindsided by the (INAUDIBLE) agreement -- the French ambassador to Washington recalled. The G20 (INAUDIBLE) that autumn not quite an opportunity for a hug. Nor an apology. But at least an explanation. 
 
BIDEN: What happened was to use the English phrase for what we think was clumsy. 
 
It was not done with a lot of grace. 
 
ETIENNE: We have learned on the European side that even if you have a administration which is more multilateral in its approach you have issues on the table. 
 
BELL: But behind the proximity and unity that the war in Ukraine have brought, Europe's feathers have once again been ruffled. This time by the Inflation Reduction Act. And behind the scenes of this visit, President Macron will be demanding more help for Europe on energy. 
 
EMMANUEL MACRON, FRENCH PRESIDENT: This is the story of a great cooperation between our two countries. 
 
BELL: The oak tree, meant to symbolize the longevity of the transatlantic friendship that he brought last time, has since died. This time, the Elysees said President Macron will be bringing a gift that symbolizes France and this time to a determination for Europe to be heard. 
 
Melissa Bell, CNN -- Paris.
