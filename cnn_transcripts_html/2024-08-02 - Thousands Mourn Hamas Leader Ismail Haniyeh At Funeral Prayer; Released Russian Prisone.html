ISA SOARES, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST: A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, Hamas calling for a day of rage as its 
 
 political leader Ismail Haniyeh is buried and mourned in Qatar. We are live in the region as tensions soar.
 
Then for the first time we are hearing from some of the released Russian prisoners less than 24 hours since that historic prisoner exchange. Plus, 
 
 the U.S. recognizes Venezuelan opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez as the winner of the presidential election. I'll be joined by the former President 
 
 of Colombia for his reaction to the election turmoil. 
 
Well, from Doha to Beirut, Istanbul to Islamabad, mourners across the Muslim world are saying final prayers for Hamas   political leader Ismail 
 
 Haniyeh today, as calls grow for his death to be avenged.

SOARES: Words of sorrow gave way to angry chants at Haniyeh's funeral in Qatar. He was killed, if you remember, many suspected Israeli hit in Tehran 
 
 two days ago. This new video from an Iranian news agency shows Haniyeh's burial in Qatar. Hamas senior leader Khaled Mashal was among those 
 
 attending.
 
Israel won't confirm or deny responsibility for that assassination. But Haniyeh's death along with the Israeli killings of Hezbollah commander in 
 
 Beirut, Hamas military chief in Gaza, and now a senior member of Palestinian Islamic Jihad are raising fears of an all-out regional war.   
 
Hezbollah's chief suggests a coordinated attack on Israel could be coming. And Iran's supreme leader says he considers that Iran's duty to avenge 
 
 Haniyeh's death. The U.S. meanwhile says it is ready to move resources to the region to counter the threat. Have a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOHN KIRBY, COORDINATOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS, NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL, WHITE HOUSE: We've heard the supreme leader loud and clear that he 
 
 intends to avenge this killing of Hamas leader in Tehran, and that they want to conduct another attack on Israel.  
 
We can't just assume that we aren't also potentially going to be victims of that kind of an attack. So, we've got to make sure we get the right 
 
 resources and capabilities in the region. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
SOARES: John Kirby speaking early here to CNN. We're joined now by CNN's Clarissa Ward, who is in Tel Aviv, and our Ben Wedeman in Beirut. And 
 
 Clarissa, let me start with you on this developing story that we've been following here on CNN, that Israeli forces have detained the Imam of Al-
 
 Aqsa Mosque. What more can you tell us about this?  
 
CLARISSA WARD, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Isa, this happened earlier on today, and there were allegations that he had publicly 
 
 mourned the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh. He was taken from his home, interrogated. We have seen some videos and some stills of that 
 
 interrogation. 
 
He is well into his 80s, and obviously, all of this giving rise to fears that there could be more violence, more discord, not just in terms of the 
 
 geopolitical side of the picture regionally, but within Israel and the occupied territories itself. We already saw the National Security Minister 
 
 Ben-Gvir, who is very far right, and part of Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition come out and sort of celebrate this investigation. 
 
But certainly, the abiding concern is that this is not going to do anything to try to keep tempers calm on what Hamas had declared a day of anger, Isa. 
 
SOARES: And Ben, to you in Beirut, like Clarissa was saying there, Hamas has been calling for a day of anger following, of course, the assassination 
 
 of Ismail Haniyeh whose funeral was held today. Just what more can you tell us about this, and particularly, the mood across the region. Clearly, every 
 
 -- the tensions are very high right now. 
 
BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, what we've seen is prayers for Ismail Haniyeh across the region, and in addition to, of 
 
 course, his funeral in Doha, the capital of Qatar. We saw prayers in Indonesia, in Turkey, in Pakistan, and in Amman, Jordan.
 <br>[14:05:00] 
 
We saw a massive demonstration in support of the Palestinians in particularly marking the death of Ismail Haniyeh. 
 
And so, certainly, yes, when you add all the elements that are making the situation ever more tense, of course, the arrest of the Imam of the Al Aqsa 
 
 Mosque really is the cherry on top of a cake of really a last few days, which has seen, as you mentioned, the assassination of Fuad Shukr here in 
 
 Beirut. 
 
A few hours later, the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, and then of course, the Israelis announcing that they killed Mohammed Deif; the head of the 
 
 military wing of Hamas. So, it really is adding up to a situation where the Middle East is already a powder keg, obviously. 
 
But now, it's a very big powder keg. Now, the Americans are talking about sending more forces to the region possibly, even troops now. It would be 
 
 good if they spend as much effort and time to actually witness -- get a ceasefire in Gaza -- 
 
SOARES: Yes -- 
 
WEDEMAN: Which is really the core problem at the moment. And of course, here in Lebanon, the economy has suffered drastically from the tensions. 
 
 The head of the -- one of the federations that runs tourism in Lebanon said that in July, there was a 60 percent cancellation -- hotel reservation 
 
 cancellations in that since last Saturday's strike on the Majdal Shams  area, that killed 12 children there.
 
There's been a 90 percent cancellation rate. So, the situation is catastrophic on every level, in addition, of course, to the more -- almost 
 
 40,000 people dead in Gaza. And it seems the United States' only solution to that is to send more military forces to the Middle East.  
 
SOARES: It does seem to me, at least, a little bit of a tinderbox right now. And Clarissa, we heard clearly in the last 24 hours or so what Iran 
 
 had to say, they have been promising a harsh and painful response. I wonder how Israel responding to this, and how it's preparing crucially for any 
 
 sort of retaliation from Iran here.
 
WARD: Well, officially, the home-front command hasn't changed anything for most Israelis, and they're continuing to go about their daily lives. There 
 
 have been some alerts for people in northern border communities near to Lebanon. But we are seeing preparations that are ongoing. 
 
We spoke to a hospital in Tel Aviv that has cleared out an underground car park to prepare to potentially treat or move patients there if there is 
 
 some kind of an attack. We saw the Jerusalem municipality issue instructions to people to make sure that their shelter is ready to be used, 
 
 telling them that they would have about 90 seconds to find somewhere to shelter if there was some kind of an attack. 
 
Also warning them that they would potentially be without power for several days. And in that vein, we have heard from one of the supermarket chains 
 
 here that there's been a 30 percent uptick in sales. A lot of people buying toilet paper, buying canned goods, certainly last night, when we attended a 
 
 rally for families of hostages inside Gaza and their supporters, there were quite a few people who mentioned to us that they had reservations about 
 
 going out and joining the rally because of concerns that there is some kind of a large strike potentially imminent. 
 
Israeli forces say that they are ready to meet the moment as it were. We saw the Minister of Defense here Yoav Gallant who spoke with his U.S. 
 
 counterpart Lloyd Austin today for the third time this week. He also had a visitor in the form of the British Secretary of Defense, and we have heard 
 
 again from the Prime Minister, saying that everyone is on high alert and ready. But no sense yet as to when this attack or retaliation may be 
 
 coming. Isa.
 
SOARES: Clarissa Ward and our Ben Wedeman, who is in Beirut for us. Thank you to you both. Well, reaction today to the deaths of two "Al Jazeera" 
 
 journalists in Gaza. The group, "Reporters Without Borders" says it's quote, "outraged by the deadly attack".
 
Ismail al-Ghoul and Rami al-Rifi were killed in an Israeli airstrike on Wednesday. Israel's military alleges that al-Ghoul was a member of Hamas' 
 
 military wing and quote, "participated in the October 7th attack". But he didn't provide CNN with any proof of its claims. 
 
"Al Jazeera" denied what it called baseless allegations. It says, quote, "this latest attack on "Al Jazeera" journalist is part of a systematic 
 
 targeting campaign against the network's journalists and their families since October 2023. Well, amid the endless destruction and rising death 
 
 toll in Gaza, it's rare to hear from Israeli soldiers about the horrors they witnessed while fighting. 
 <br>[14:10:00] 
 
One of the few to speak out is Yuval Green, an IDF medic who publicly refused further service after what he saw. Our Bianna Golodryga spoke with 
 
 him recently from Jerusalem. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
BIANNA GOLODRYGA, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT: You said that a commander told your unit to burn the house that you were stationed in, and it was 
 
 after that you decided not to come back to duty. 
 
YUVAL GREEN, FORMER IDF PARATROOPER: The extent of damage I've seen in Gaza is just beyond every imagination. You can't imagine it. Cities that are 
 
 completely ruined, and at some point, my commander told my platoon to burn down the house we were staying at. And I went to him, I approached him and 
 
 I asked him, why are we doing that? 
 
And he gave me a few reasons. And I think those reasons were just not strong enough, and they were, you know, military type of reasons, but they 
 
 came along the revenge type of reasons. Now, I think this is just what's going on in Gaza. Israel is doing things because it needs to fulfill a type 
 
 of military purpose. 
 
But it all mixes up with our need for -- or the Israeli need for revenge. And I said, I'm not willing to participate in that. I'm not destroying a 
 
 house that belong to few families that would become homeless because of that and I'm leaving. And I just left on the next -- with the next car that 
 
 went out. 
 
GOLODRYGA: You made similar claims and statements and accusations against the IDF and your commanders and superiors. In an interview with "ABC News" 
 
 and in the IDF in response said, quote, "its actions are based on military necessity and in accordance to international law. There was no idea of 
 
 doctrine that aims at causing maximum damage to civilian infrastructure regardless of military necessity.
 
Defacing homes with graffiti and stealing household personal objects is against the IDF's code of conduct and values. The IDF has acted and 
 
 continues to act to identify unusual cases that deviate from what is expected of IDF soldiers." What do you make of those statements, and the 
 
 fact that the IDF states that anyone who commits these acts will face prosecution.
 
GREEN: I do think that the IDF, you know -- the IDF is against if you'll look at things from above, from the -- you know, the superior commanders of 
 
 the IDF. I think they do believe that this shouldn't happen, looting or a graffiti. But I don't think it has the resources to stop, and I think, you 
 
 know, it all comes down to the soldiers at the field.
 
You can't stop any soldier from doing things. And I think that's what I said about, you know, the mix-up of the military and revenge type of 
 
 purposes. If a soldier is telling you or trying to explain something with military reasons, that sometimes are true. And I've seen it many times in 
 
 which in cases that was true, it's very difficult to un-prove it.
 
And I could tell you 100 percent that we've destroyed houses at least for reasons that were just not -- we don't care enough about the lives of 
 
 Palestinians. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
SOARES: And you can watch the full interview with Yuval Green at amanpour.com. Well, for the first time, we are hearing from the released 
 
 Russian prisoners less than 24 hours since their historic prisoner exchange. Take a listen to this. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
VLADIMIR KARA-MURZA, RELEASED RUSSIAN PRISONER (through translator): Only yesterday, we were in a KGB isolation cell. Me and my comrades here, and 
 
 here we are on the picturesque Banks of the Rhine. It feels really surreal what's happened. To feeling that I'm in a surreal situation. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
SOARES: Well, last night in U.S. state of Maryland, have a look at that. An emotional scene really unfolding before our very eyes to welcome home the 
 
 three Americans, just imagine that hug and that welcome home. Who of course, were released from Russian prisons. 
 
U.S. President Joe Biden says this prisoner exchange would not have happened without the help of America's international allies. Nada Bashir 
 
 has the details on last night's emotional reunions. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER (voice-over): Home at last. Landing at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, the long-awaited   return of three Americans detained 
 
 in Russia now finally a reality. Former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan, journalist Alsu Kurmasheva and "Wall Street Journal" reporter Evan Gershkovich seen 
 
 here being welcomed by cheers -- 
 
(CHEERS) 
 
BASHIR: Before an emotional reunion with his mother. All smiles as he greets fellow journalists. For President Biden, this was a historic feat of 
 
 diplomacy.  
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Did you think that this moment would come, sir? 
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Yes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What made you feel so confident? 
 
BIDEN: Our relations with other heads of states -- 
 
BASHIR: The return comes as part of a carefully broken exchange. The largest prisoner swap according to the U.S. since the cold war. 
 <br>[14:15:00] 
 
Secured in coordination with Germany, Poland, Slovenia, Norway and Turkey. Among the 16 U.S. and European nationals released from detention in Russia, 
 
 prominent Putin critic Vladimir Kara-Murza, a British national and permanent U.S. resident.
 
KARA-MURZA: (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) 
 
BASHIR: Heard here, speaking to his children who joined the President in a call from the Oval Office.
 
KARA-MURZA: I was sure I was going to die in prison. I don't believe what's happening, I still think it's a -- I still think I'm sleeping in my prison 
 
 shabby(ph) uniforms(ph).  
 
BASHIR: Not all American nationals held in Russia, however, were released. The family of Marc Fogel, who worked in Russia as a teacher and was 
 
 arrested on drug charges in 2021, have expressed their disappointment. 
 
ANNE FOGEL, SISTER OF MARC FOGEL: It's been a roller-coaster, no sleep, I feel like we've been kind of collectively stabbed in the back.
 
BASHIR: In an emotional statement, U.S. National Security adviser Jake Sullivan said, all Americans wrongfully detained remain a priority.  
 
JAKE SULLIVAN, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: Today was a very good day, and we're going to build on it, drawing inspiration and continued courage from 
 
 it for all of those who were held hostage or wrongfully detained around the world. 
 
BASHIR: As part of the exchange, eight Russian nationals, including convicted killers and spies, will also return to Moscow. Sparking concern 
 
 that the deal could strengthen Russia's hand and even encourage other adversaries to arbitrarily detain foreign nationals as bargaining chips. 
 
 But such criticisms have been rejected by Biden. 
 
BIDEN: Hello, everybody. 
 
BASHIR: And for those who have anxiously waited for the return of their loved ones -- 
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
BASHIR: Including Evan's "Wall Street Journal" colleagues who campaigned for months for his release. This is a moment of celebration. Nada Bashir, 
 
 CNN, London. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE) 
 
SOARES: It is indeed. CNN's Rosa Flores standing by for us in San Antonio, Texas. But first, let's go straight to Alex Marquardt, who is live in 
 
 Washington D.C. And Alex, just bring us up to date with what we heard in the last hour or so from some of those Russian political prisoners who were 
 
 of course, were part of this hostage deal. 
 
And I think they included Kara-Murza, we heard a bit from him. Just give us a bit more what we heard from him, from Elia(ph) and Andrei(ph) here.
 
ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Yes, so that trio who went to Germany spoke at a press conference, you know, quite 
 
 quickly after their release in the past few hours, just yesterday. And you know, Kara-Murza is arguably the most famous dissident to have been 
 
 released among this group.   
 
He told reporters there in Germany that he was certain that he was going to die in Putin's prison. He said that it feels surreal to be out of jail and 
 
 in Germany. And then he made this vow, Isa, that he will return to Russia, the day will come, he says when Russia is free. 
 
So, we are starting to hear about the ordeals of these prisoners who have just been released by Russia. We also heard from Evan Gershkovich just 
 
 moments after he landed on the tarmac just outside Washington D.C. He went over to his fellow reporters, which included a group of his colleagues from 
 
 the "Wall Street Journal". This is a little bit of what he told them. Take a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Evan, how are you feeling?
 
EVAN GERSHKOVICH, WALL STREET JOURNAL JOURNALIST FREED IN PRISONER SWAP WITH RUSSIA: I'm all right. It was a good flight. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What about the show of support?
 
GERSHKOVICH: It's -- 
 
(CHEERS) 
 
GERSHKOVICH: It's overwhelming. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
MARQUARDT: So, Gershkovich and the two other Americans then went on to Texas where Rosa is. And then, on the other side, of course, Isa, there 
 
 were eight Russians who went back to Russia, including that assassin who Nada mentioned   in her piece, Vadim Krasikov. There were also four spies, 
 
 they're called illegals. 
 
They go to other countries to spy for Russia, posing often times as other nationals. And one of the most remarkable details that we've learned since 
 
 this release is, we saw two of the spies who had been returned from Slovenia come off that plane, greeted there by Vladimir Putin, given 
 
 flowers, they had children with them. 
 
And those children believed that they were Argentinean. They didn't even know there were Russian. This is according to the Kremlin, they only found 
 
 out that they were Russian on that flight back to Russia. They didn't know who Vladimir Putin was. Putin, according to the Kremlin greeted them in 
 
 Spanish because of course, they believed that, that was their native tongue. 
 
So often in these cases, when spies are undercover, their children have absolutely no idea until their parents are caught and then returned home. 
 
 The same thing happened back in 2010 when there was a large spy swap, ten Russian spies were caught in the U.S. and sent back to Russia, quite 
 
 remarkable, Isa.
 
SOARES: Indeed. The stuff for spying novels, right? At what you've just outlined there for us. And Rosa, we did see some beautiful and wonderful 
 
 moments of course, with the American hostages coming home. 
 <br>[14:20:00] 
 
It's also a moment not just of celebration, but a moment I imagine that requires adjustment from them. I understand that they're at Brooke Army 
 
 Medical Center right now. Just talk to us, what happens there? 
 
ROSA FLORES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: You know, this is a very important step, because as you mentioned, there's a lot of video of very emotional and 
 
 happy moments in which the freed Americans are able to embrace their families for the first time in years for some of them. 
 
But what we don't see, Isa, is some of the trauma that they are experiencing. The mental scars from the detention and isolation that 
 
 they've been facing. And so, what's happening here in San Antonio, Texas, is that recovery. And it actually started moments after they landed here in 
 
 San Antonio at about 3:11 a.m. this morning. 
 
We were there, our cameras were rolling. We witnessed as the freed Americans exited the plane with their family. And then shortly thereafter, 
 
 officials from the State Department and the White House, in essence said that they were handing them off to a U.S. Army colonel who then said that 
 
 they would be transported to the facility that you see behind me, which is Brooke Army Medical Center.   
 
And then shortly thereafter, a team of psychologists talk to them and told them that their well-being was going to be their priority. So, imagine that 
 
 moment, Isa. Again, these freed Americans had been in detention, in isolation in Russia for sure, their well-being was not the priority of the 
 
 Russian authorities. 
 
But here in America, that's what -- how they were welcomed here. That's what they were told. And they were also told that they would be maximizing 
 
 their family time. And this is important because the facility that you see behind me, they will be receiving a medical evaluation, but they will also 
 
 be incorporating family time. 
 
And it's that family time that Paul Whelan told us a little bit about. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
PAUL WHELAN, U.S. MARINE VETERAN FREED IN PRISONER SWAP WITH RUSSIA: So, looking forward to seeing my family down here and just recuperating from 
 
 five years, seven months and five days of just absolute nonsense by the Russian government. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
FLORES: Now, take a look at this video because these freed Americans know that they're not alone. Now, this was a special moment. They held a hostage 
 
 and wrongful detainee flag, and at one point, Paul Whelan pointed to the three bars at the bottom, Isa, and he said, that's the three of us, the 
 
 three Americans that were on American soil. Isa?
 
SOARES: So wonderful to hear from them and to see them all there together. Rasa and Alex, thank you to you both, appreciate it. And this hour, we are 
 
 monitoring the stock market. Stocks have been down sharply to close the week. In fact, they started the day pretty much from the green, and 
 
 disappointing U.S. jobs report stoked fear among investors.
 
Right now on Wall Street, red -- pardon me, right across the board. CNN business editor-at-large, Richard Quest will join us after this short break 
 
 to explain what else could be behind this. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 <br>[14:25:54]
 
SOARES: Now, I want to take you there live. We're listening to Ronald Rowe as you can see there, the acting director of Secret Service, talking about 
 
 the failures of Trump assassination. Let's just listen in.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thanks for doing this. I wanted to ask you about changes moving forward. Former President Trump has said he wants to continue having 
 
 outdoor rallies. What specifically will be different at the next rally that wasn't   the case in Butler?
 
And if I could ask a follow-up too, do you have information in the 30 seconds after the gunman was confronted on the roof by a local law 
 
 enforcement officer, that there were local law enforcement trying to communicate with the Secret Service that there was someone on the roof with 
 
 a gun, and that, that transmission was the one that was missed.  
 
RONALD ROWE, ACTING DIRECTOR, U.S. SECRET SERVICE: OK, so with respect to the former President who want to get back out there, listen, it's a 
 
 campaign season, right? Candidates want to be out there, they want to be -- whether it's an indoor site or an outdoor site, it's on the Secret Service 
 
 to make sure that we create a secure environment.
 
And, you know, listen, we identify challenges. We identify concerns, and then it's on us to figure out what we need to do to mitigate that. So, if 
 
 there are going to be future campaign rallies outside, we -- it's going to be on us to make sure that we are providing all the assets and resources to 
 
 make sure that those sites are indeed secure. 
 
With respect to the radio transmissions, you know, based on, you know, what the FBI, my colleague from the FBI testified the other day, and they are 
 
 working on isolating some of those radio frequencies from the state and locals, that there was somebody who did in fact radio out that they had 
 
 seen the individual with a weapon. 
 
What I can tell you is that, that piece of information, that vital piece of information -- and by no fault of anyone, it was a very stressful 
 
 situation. It did not make it over. Our detail, our counter-snipers, everyone that was there that day were operating under the assumption and 
 
 under the -- under the last bit of information they had received, that there was an issue that the locals were working at the 3 O'clock.
 
That's a bit of information that we had, not anything about a weapon. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I wanted you to address or if you can describe the Pittsburgh field office and their level of experience, especially in 
 
 preparing for events like this, and also, have they explained their thinking and how they defined their perimeter that day?
 
ROWE: Sure, thanks Holmes(ph). You know, our Pittsburgh field office, I don't think there's anybody in the Secret Service who is feeling this more 
 
 than the men and women of our Pittsburgh field office. And I've met with them, and they are down right now.
 
And so, when I met with them the other day, it was very -- it was very difficult. It's difficult for them. They feel like they let their 
 
 colleagues down. They feel like they let the country down, and they are wearing this, and it is -- it's open. You can see it. It's an open wound 
 
 that they are carrying. 
 
They're a very experienced office, and what I will say is, they are cooperating with the mission assurance. They understand the gravity of this 
 
 situation and they are definitely down right now.  
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I wanted to, if I can, one follow-up. You testified about one of the Secret Service (INAUDIBLE) -- how curious, how is the 
 
 Secret Service going to do it, make assumptions, probably, protection, it seems they need to protect for the entire protection mission.
 
ROWE: Yes, so, when we -- when I said it's a ferry to challenge our assumptions -- 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes -- 
 
ROWE: Meaning the assumption that, hey, that's going to be addressed or that's going to be covered by state and local. So, earlier this week, I 
 
 convened a call with all of our special agents in charge of all of our field offices, and I expressed to them, listen, we need our state and local 
 
 counterparts, but we also have to be very direct, very clear about what our expectations are about what we need from them. Whether it's a particular 
 
 asset, whether it's particular numbers of personnel, we need to be very clear so that they have an understanding of exactly what we need from them. 
 <br>[14:30:25]
 
That is, that's on us. We need to be better communicators and articulate exactly what we need to mitigate any challenges, concerns, or anything that 
 
 we identify during that advanced process. And so I have full confidence in our SACs in the field. I have full confidence in our state and local 
 
 counterparts that moving forward now, we're not going to have this assumption that, oh, we think that they have it. 
 
No, we're going to work together. We're going to have good, hard, fierce conversations about what we're going to do, and then we're going to go out 
 
 there, and we're going to make all of these venues secure moving forward. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE REPORTER: Thank you, Acting Director. One thing -- for starters, I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit on a portion of the 
 
 timeline in which you address a communication between the Secret Service detail and personnel at the Pittsburgh field office. That was -- it just 
 
 struck me as a little vague, and I was curious if you could elaborate on what that communication was. 
 
ROWE: So the former president's details, they had an advanced person on the ground who was responsible for the site. The radio transmission goes out 
 
 about locals working an issue at the 3:00. That former -- the member of that detail called their Pittsburgh field office counterpart, hey, what do 
 
 you know about this? 
 
In the midst -- right in the middle of that phone conversation, the shots begin firing. So that's the context of it.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE REPORTER: And sorry if I missed, could you say how they became aware of the locals working an issue in the first place to even have 
 
 that conversation? 
 
ROWE: That was the radio transmission that was put out by our security room. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE REPORTER: I got it. OK. The other -- just to follow up, I'm curious about, you know, you mentioned that this was the first event 
 
 where Secret Service counter-snipers had been assigned as part of the security for former President Trump. To what extent do you think that 
 
 factored into what were ultimately shown to be the failures, just that this was a first time, at least in a while, in his capacity as a former 
 
 president, that they were there on the site? 
 
ROWE: So -- 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE REPORTER: The novelty of it, sorry. 
 
ROWE: Sure, sure. So let me just clarify one thing. This was the first time that Secret Service counter-snipers, but the former president at campaign 
 
 rallies has actually been getting state and local resources, so tactical assets, counter-snipers from state and locals. 
 
So with respect to why they were there in Butler, listen, we evaluate our threat landscape every day. We calibrate based on that threat. We evaluated 
 
 a threat stream that we have, and we put our Secret Service counter-sniper personnel out there. 
 
And looking back, you know, it was very fortunate that we did, but the former president will have counter-sniper coverage moving forward, as will 
 
 the president, the vice president, Senator Vance, and then we'll await the eventual Democratic vice presidential nominee. 
 
We are going to put full resources out there to make sure that, you know, our campaign cadence now is obviously picked up, and we're going to make 
 
 sure that we have all the resources out there to address any challenges that we have. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE REPORTER: Thank you. As you're doing this review, are you looking at the days leading up to this event and the instructions that 
 
 you gave to state and local and federal partners? I know in the past there used to be a PowerPoint presentation that was given before events like 
 
 this. 
 
People who were part -- of each unit in the Secret Service would stand up, go through the mission, who was assigned to them, what they'd be doing. I 
 
 understand that did not happen in this case and hasn't been happening for some time prior. Is that something you think was missing here? Is that 
 
 something you might review and bring back? And do you also think the Secret Service is too reliant on state, local, and federal partners? 
 
I mean, you have almost 2,000 HSI agents helping in events coming this fall. That's a third of their workforce, and it takes a lot from state and 
 
 locals as well. So first, would you bring back the PowerPoint? Do you think there should have been more planning? And are you too reliant on state and 
 
 local and other partners? 
 
ROWE: Thanks, Julia. So that will be part of the mission assurance, the communications and what was communicated leading up to it. What I can tell 
 
 you now based on information I have is there was -- and what you're referring to is what we call a police meeting. 
 <br>[14:35:01]
 
Where we bring all the agencies together that will be directly supporting a particular visit. We know that there was a police meeting. We know that 
 
 there were agencies from the various jurisdictions were present. The ones - - and when I say that, the ones that were the primary ones identified with providing support and were going to be involved in the advanced planning 
 
 process, meaning they were going to provide a counterpart, kind of like what you said, the PowerPoint. 
 
If you're going to be conducting the site, this is Special Agent so-and-so, and, you know, here's their contact info. And then usually at the end of 
 
 that meeting, everyone kind of goes off, and they form up, and they go over, you know, how they're going to go out and do the walkthroughs and 
 
 identify some of the things. 
 
I -- 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE REPORTER: You're saying that did happen, that they did do a PowerPoint? 
 
ROWE: Based on the information -- I don't know about the PowerPoint. I can tell you that there was a police meeting. 
 
With respect to the PowerPoint, I certainly think that visuals are always good. I think that if we're not using it, we certainly will. But that goes 
 
 back to my direction, that we have to be very specific about what we're communicating and what our expectations are moving forward.
 
With respect to the reliance on state and local law enforcement, listen, there are 700,000 full-time law enforcement officers, over 700,000 full-
 
 time law enforcement officers in the United States. The majority of prosecutions in the criminal justice system in the United States are done 
 
 by state and locals. That's a result of criminal investigations that they do every day in their communities to keep them safe.
 
Over 135 officers died last year serving their communities, federal, state, and local. Forty-seven of them died by violent means, gunfire. There's not 
 
 an over-reliance on them. They're out there every day securing their communities. They know the terrain. They know the people.
 
More importantly, they know the local laws. If you're in a state where it's open carry, we're going to rely on them to enforce local laws. I, as a 
 
 federal agent, cannot go out there and enforce the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. I need those state and local law enforcement officers, so 
 
 I would push back on that. 
 
With respect to leveraging other federal partners, when we were in the Department of Treasury and I was a brand-new agent, I would stand post 
 
 during a campaign year with agents from ATF, IRS Criminal Investigations. You know, we were all one big, happy family. Customs. Customs moved over to 
 
 DHS just like we did. 
 
So we do this every four years. We rely on those partners. We use them during national special security events like the Democratic National 
 
 Convention, the United Nations General Assembly, the presidential inauguration. Those are whole-of-government security operations, which the 
 
 Secret Service is the lead planning for, and we're going to bring in partners from across the government. 
 
I don't feel that it's an over-reliance. It's something that we have done going back to our days at Treasury, and we're going to continue to do that. 
 
 We need those partners, and we need those state and local officers. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE REPORTER: Can I follow up here? 
 
ROWE: Sure.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE REPORTER: There's something I didn't understand here. Talking about that time period where locals understand that this person is 
 
 a threat but it's before Secret Service finds out, I understand, communication. Were they not standing right next to them, or were they in 
 
 two separate communities? 
 
ROWE: So there was -- we had our security room, and then they had a unified command post, and we had Pennsylvania State Police officer representative 
 
 in our security room. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE REPORTER: But there was no Secret Service agent in the unified? 
 
ROWE: No, there was not. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE REPORTER: Okay. So are there typically two separates unifieds? 
 
ROWE: That was unique. As I understand it, they -- that's a -- an emergency management model that they use. You know, and as I mentioned in that 
 
 conversation with our special agents in charge in the field, I've directed them, hey, we need to rethink where we put our security room. 
 
If the large -- majority of our partners are in a unified command post or in a different location, we need to probably be there, too. And so we have 
 
 to rethink how we, you know, where we put our security rooms, and we are, in fact, doing that now moving forward. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So let's go to Ellen Gilmer with Bloomberg. We'll be at the pool. I think it's time to follow up with you, David.
 
ELLEN GILMER, BLOOMBERG REPORTER: Thanks so much. You know, appropriators in Congress this week delayed consideration of DHS's budget for fiscal 25. 
 
 They want to know more about what Secret Service needs. 
 
I know you said Tuesday, obviously, every agency head is always going to say they need more resources. But can you be kind of specific about what 
 
 resource needs there may be, particularly when we're looking at the technology issues, radio transmissions, the CUAS system? 
 
ROWE: Sure. So following this, we have had tremendous support from the Department of Homeland Security and from the Secretary. And we have, in 
 
 fact, looked at all of these needs. Given this dynamic, high-threat environment that we're operating in, in order to meet this -- 
 <br>[14:40:02]
 
We can meet this now, but it is going to require additional investments and resources, and we are having those conversations. We certainly have been -- 
 
 we've had great support not only from the department, but also our Appropriations Committee -- committees and we are working through kind of 
 
 what our needs are right now. 
 
We will have future conversations about this, and we are appreciative that everyone is really coming together to make sure that we have what we need 
 
 to meet this high threat. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE REPORTER: And since (INAUDIBLE) 
 
ROWER: Listen, that's not for me to weigh in on, but what I will tell you is, you know, there's also a lot of discussion about why should the Secret 
 
 Service do criminal investigations. And what I will say is this. 
 
We were founded in 1865 as an investigative entity. It's in our DNA. I firmly believe that the best protection agents learn those skills being 
 
 criminal investigators. You learn how to interact with people. You learn organizational skills. You learn to be analytical. Those are all traits 
 
 that you need to have when you're on a detail. 
 
Moreover, if you look at where we are today, buildings, communities, everything is interconnected. And so we have a particular expertise in 
 
 cyber and in cybercrime and critical systems protection.
 
And so when you overlay that, that investigative skill set that we have, you know, it's more than just securing the President or our protectees in a 
 
 brick and mortar setting. It's also protecting them from things that make them vulnerable due to cyber. And so the only way to learn that -- those 
 
 skills to be able to detect, to be able to analyze, to be able to make sure that we are hardening not only cyber systems, but hardening a building that 
 
 is fed by cyber systems. 
 
The only way to gain that experience, that knowledge, is to be able to do criminal investigations. Additionally, it is within our investigative 
 
 authority to follow up on threats. People make threats to the President and the people we protect every day. 
 
We need to have that domestic and international network of field offices to be able to track down those threats. And if necessary, bring those people 
 
 to justice and present them to a U.S. Attorney's Office. So this, you know, I know there's been a lot of talk. 
 
Should we or shouldn't we? Should we do this? Should we be in DHS? The bottom line is this. If you want the Secret Service to continue to be the 
 
 Secret Service and be effective at what it does, it needs to be doing investigations and it probably needs to be in the Department of Homeland 
 
 Security until Congress or others have an opportunity to weigh in. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Director, last question (INAUDIBLE) 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE REPORTER: Just a quick question. There's a report that a whistleblower has alleged that you personally directed cuts to the Counter 
 
 Surveillance Division, which led to the Threat Assessments Team failing to perform its duties that it typically would before the Butler rally. Is that 
 
 accurate? Is that allegation accurate? 
 
ROWE: So I've recently -- I've become aware of this. We got a congressional letter on it. What I can tell you is that the Counter Surveillance 
 
 Division, they do a fantastic job. They have a very specific mission set. A lot of that mission set is here in the National Capital Region, focused on 
 
 permanent protective sites. 
 
But they do go out and they support -- when requested, they go out and support former details. I know that there's been allegations that I 
 
 personally cut or that I -- let's see, that I denied requests. The Counter Surveillance Division has been out there supporting the former president's 
 
 detail at some very high profile events. 
 
They continue to provide that support, and they're out there providing support right now. So we're going to respond to the letter that we 
 
 received, and we'll be sure to make that -- I'm sure they will be able to share that response when the committee says it's okay to respond. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE REPORTER: Is that a no though? Did you cut funding personally? 
 
ROWER: I did not, no.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE REPORTER: Did you finally figure out what -- how he got that gun on the roof? Did it fit in the backpack? 
 
ROWE: We're working to determine that. That's something that the FBI is working on. There's a couple of -- I don't want to speculate as to exactly 
 
 how he would have gotten it up there. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE REPORTER: Director Rowe, in the 2024 campaign (INAUDIBLE) 
 
ROWER: So we have already trained numerous details to be able to mobilize, to pick up multiple candidates. 
 <br>[14:45:02]
 
You know, most of the presidential campaign activity usually picks up coming out of the conventions. So we are prepared for this. It's just that 
 
 now we are in such a heightened, dynamic environment. We're actually making sure that we are probably putting everything we can to make sure that we 
 
 don't have a mission failure. 
 
It is incumbent upon everyone in the Secret Service, we all understand the gravity of this situation, and we are rising to meet this moment. 
 
And we are certainly, as we go into the Democratic National Convention, as we await picking up another candidate with the eventual naming of a vice-
 
 presidential nominee from the Democratic side, we are going to staff that, and we are going to make sure that we have all the resources and assets 
 
 necessary to provide that level of protection. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE REPORTER: Director, thank you. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you, everyone. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
SOARES: Right. You have been listening there to Ronald Rowe, the acting director of the Secret Service, and I'm going to quote what he said. "The 
 
 Secret Service takes full responsibility for the tragic events of July 13." Really, they're briefing the media on the failures surrounding the 
 
 assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump. 
 
He said, "In no way should any state or local agency supporting us in Butler be held -- are responsible for a Secret Service failure." This was, 
 
 he said, a Secret Service failure. He said the agency didn't know the shooter had a weapon until the shots were actually fired, and he said, 
 
 clearly, they should have had better coverage on that roof line. 
 
We will keep across, of course -- this is part of an investigation, a review that is only starting, a lengthy one, but it is the first time we've 
 
 heard from Ronald Rowe this week, at least, on where we are taking questions from the media. 
 
He did also discuss how some of those officers were feeling. I think this is important. He said they were experienced officers. They understand the 
 
 gravity, but said this is an open wound. They're all down right now. 
 
And still to come on the show tonight, Juan Manuel Santos is a Nobel Peace Prize winner, and the former president of Colombia. He'll join me live to 
 
 speak about Venezuela's disputed election. That's next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:50:23]
 
SOARES: While the U.S. has officially recognized Venezuelan opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez as the clear winner of last week's presidential 
 
 election, widespread international condemnation has continued to pour in as regional leaders, including Brazil and Mexico, as well as Colombia, call 
 
 for full transparency. 
 
In response to the U.S., the government of strongman Nicolas Maduro has accused Washington of staging a coup. 
 
Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, meanwhile, is currently in hiding, and her party says their headquarters were vandalized earlier today. 
 
And joining me now is the former president of Colombia and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Juan Manuel Santos. He has called the results not credible 
 
 and asked the international community to stand up for democracy. 
 
Mr. President, welcome back to the show. Wonderful to see you. As you were joining us just now, I am seeing that Venezuela's electoral authorities 
 
 have released new figures, and they claim, quelle surprise, that Maduro's win for the election. So, 98.87 percent of the ballots transmitted. Nicolas 
 
 Maduro obtained 51.95 of the votes. This was coming from the electoral council, important to say to our viewers that Maduro controls the electoral 
 
 council. So, your reflection at this juncture? 
 
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS, FORMER PRESIDENT OF COLOMBIA: I'm sorry, but I am having a problem with the voice. Could you repeat the question again? 
 
SOARES: Of course, of course. I was just saying, Mr. President, we've heard from the National Electoral Council of Venezuela in the last few minutes, 
 
 and they claim that Maduro's won by 51.95 percent of the vote. As we know, the electoral council is run, controlled, by Maduro. Your reaction? 
 
SANTOS: Well, this is part of the charade. I mean, nobody believes the numbers that the electoral council, which is controlled by Maduro, gave a 
 
 few days ago or is giving right now, because the key aspect are the official records of the polling stations. 
 
Everybody is asking for those records. And until those records are not produced by Maduro, nobody will recognize or believe that the results -- 
 
 that the electoral council is giving are true or valid. 
 
And, on the contrary, there's vast information demonstrating that the results are completely the opposite of what the electoral council is 
 
 saying.
 
SOARES: And we heard from the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken saying they'll recognize Edmundo Gonzalez. But the U.S. hasn't gone as far as to 
 
 say to recognize him as the legitimate leader, which, of course, is what we saw with Juan Guaido, which I remember clearly more than 15 countries, in 
 
 fact, recognized him as the president. 
 
There's also no talk of sanctions. So I wonder what lessons you think, Mr. President, can be learned here, because what happened in the past wasn't -- 
 
 didn't produce any results. So how does the international community react now? 
 
SANTOS: Well, what the U.S. is saying is very much what most of the Latin American countries and the Europeans are also saying, that what we know so 
 
 far is that the vast majority of the Venezuelans voted for Edmundo Gonzalez. 
 
The precise words that Secretary Blinken used don't say that he recognizes him as president, but recognizes that he won the election.
 
SOARES: Correct. 
 
SANTOS: And there's a subtle difference there. And that's what the United States and the three countries that are working to find a solution, Brazil, 
 
 Mexico and Colombia, what they're trying to do is to force the regime to publish the records of the polling stations, which I am sure he's not going 
 
 to do because he's not going to be able to demonstrate that what he's been saying is true. 
 <br>[14:55:03]
 
So we're in a sort of Catch-22 situation. Very, very worrisome because we are seeing more and more repression. There is various polls that are saying 
 
 that more than 20 percent of the Venezuelans that are right now in Venezuela would flow out of Venezuela if the regime is maintained. 
 
That's more than six million people on top of the eight million that are not in Venezuela anymore. So it's a very worrisome situation. I hope that 
 
 the international community can force Maduro to sit down and negotiate a -- what I have been calling for some years a dignified way out, a golden 
 
 bridge.
 
SOARES: How would that work? Because in my coverage of covering Venezuela over the years is that, you know, there's been no way to dislodge him, Mr. 
 
 President, that he is surrounded by the -- by military who, you know, are strong and well, you know, pocketed financially. So how do you dislodge 
 
 that? How do you dislodge the military heavyweights here? 
 
SANTOS: Well, from the international point of view, the international community, there are ways to give Maduro some kind of dignified way out. 
 
 For example, the -- all the accusations that are made before the International Criminal Court could be withdrawn if the Security Council 
 
 agrees to that. 
 
There is a procedure. We've been talking about this for many, many years. But I don't think that at this time Maduro is going to accept that. And the 
 
 other aspect is what you mentioned, the military. The military right now are backing Maduro. This is, in fact, what Venezuela is becoming is a 
 
 military regime because without the military, he would have nothing. And that is also very worrisome because the military regime will continue to 
 
 violate human rights. And what we all want is for those violations of human rights to cease. 
 
SOARES: Mr. President, I appreciate you waiting for us. A busy day of breaking news. Always wonderful to get your insight. Thank you very much. 
 
 Wonderful to see you. Muchas gracias. 
 
That does it for us tonight. Do stay right here. "NEWSROOM" with Jim Sciutto is up next.
