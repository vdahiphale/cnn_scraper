THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
JULIA BENBROOK, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Now, back in 2017, Biden actually received this award from then-President Barack Obama, and it was a surprise, one that left Biden looking visibly emotional.
 
Today could be a bit of a reflective moment for him as well. He's got less than 20 days left before he says goodbye to the presidency and his long career in politics. This event today is expected to start at the top of the hour, so just a few minutes away now.
 
FREDRICKA WHITFIELD, CNN HOST: Oh yes, and that was a beautiful moment. I think everyone remembers that because it was such a surprise for Biden when Obama did that. And yes, he said he was visibly emotional. He was moved to tears, he couldn't even speak, but it was beautiful. And today's ceremony will be amazing as well.
 
Julia Benbrook, thank you so much. And we'll get back to you, of course, when it begins.
 
A new hour of the CNN NEWSROOM starts right now.
 
Hello again, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me. I'm Fredricka Whitfield. And we continue to follow the start of the touching final farewell to the late President Jimmy Carter.
 
The first of six days of tributes and observances is underway right now in Georgia as the nation and the world honor the life and legacy of America's 39th president, who passed away Sunday at the age of 100. An emotional moment this morning when former and current U.S. Secret Service agents who protected Carter during his lifetime and his political career carried his casket to the hearse in Americus, Georgia.
 
And then there was another ceremony at Carter's boyhood home and farm in Archery, Georgia, right here, where the two longest-serving National Park staffers rang the farm bell 39 times.

WHITFIELD: Carter's motorcade, also going through nearby Plains, where Carter was born. People lining the streets to pay their respects. The motorcade is now slowly making its way from South Georgia to Atlanta. And in a few hours, it will stop off at the Georgia Capitol in Atlanta, where Carter served one term as governor and as state senator.
 
And after a moment of silence honoring his service, the motorcade will then head to the Carter Center in Atlanta, where a service will be held later on there today.
 
CNN's Jeff Zeleny is at the Carter Center for us. Jeff, set the scene for us for the rest of today's tributes.
 
JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Fredricka, each one of those stops is a touchstone of former President Jimmy Carter's life and indeed his legacy. As you said, his motorcade is making its way north up to Atlanta. He will be pausing for a moment at the Atlanta Capitol.
 
Governor Brian Kemp, we are told, will be greeting the presidential motorcade there before making its way here to a service. And that is going to be the first of several services in this state funeral ceremony over the next several days here.
 
And Chip Carter and Jason Carter, the late president's son and grandson, who are members of the Carter Center's board here, they will be speaking as well as the Navy Hymn, of course, recognizing the service of Jimmy Carter in the Navy.
 
Of course, he left Plains, Georgia to go be a naval engineer. That is a key part of his legacy as well before returning to Plains, Georgia. So throughout the day, certainly one of history and legacy. But here at the Carter Center, there is no question this represents the unfinished work.
 
Of course, his time in the White House was cut short. In his eyes, he was elected under a wave of discontent in the country in the era of Watergate and the Vietnam War, but also was sent on his way after just four years in the White House when Ronald Reagan soundly defeated him in 1980.
 
But it was then, one year later, where Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter founded the Carter Center. And that would indeed be their life's work through a democracy, humanitarian work around the globe. So that is something that will be marked here as well, Fredricka.
 
So certainly, a day of history, a day of mourning, also a day of perhaps learning more about Jimmy Carter's time as the 39th president and then nearly a half century in his post-presidency.
 
WHITFIELD: I think people are learning so much more about him as a man, as a president, as a family man and a spiritual man, indeed, throughout this entire week.
 
Jeff Zeleny, thank you so much.
 
All right, joining me right now to talk more about Jimmy Carter's life and legacy is Julian Zelizer. He is a CNN political analyst and a historian and professor at Princeton University. Julian, great to see you.
 
JULIAN ZELIZER, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Thanks for having me.
 
WHITFIELD: Well, in fact, you are among many who wrote about the breadth of Jimmy Carter's life. You wrote an article for Foreign Policy this week where you talked about how Carter really was underestimated since leaving office and argued that he stands as a model for what a one-term president can and should be. Explain further.
 <br>[13:05:19]
 
ZELIZER: Well, I think as we look back, we see how much he did in four years on domestic issues. He put forward onto the agenda issues such as the environment or reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. And on foreign policy, he made human rights central to how we decide what to do or not to do.
 
The Camp David Accords between Israel and the Egyptians is the most enduring peace agreement in the region. And he just amassed a huge record, even though in the end, his re-election was not successful.
 
WHITFIELD: Yes. You know, among the -- some of those domestic policies, if you will. And, you know, there -- it's a great litany, quite frankly, from saving Social Security, passing the Panama Canal Treaty, SALT II Treaty.
 
He is largely responsible for why many of us are wearing seatbelts in our cars and why it's a requirement. Deregulating airlines. With all of that, why does it appear that sometimes his administration has been undervalued during his one term?
 
ZELIZER: Well, I mean, part of it is we do think of one-term presidencies as failures in general. And I think it's harder for many Americans and historians to look back at these as examples of success. Although when we look back, we often see how much was accomplished.
 
Part of it was his presidency ended not in a great way, meaning even before the 1980 election, the nation was really focused on the Iranian hostage crisis, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and the late President Carter had very low approval ratings. And we remember that.
 
And finally, it's not only that he's a one-term president, but he loses to Ronald Reagan. He loses to the representative of the conservative movement that until this day has fought against many of the things that Carter stood for.
 
And so, that I think influences the way we look back on those four years. And rightly so, I think it's a legitimate conversation to have about what he could or could not do well.
 
WHITFIELD: And but it's interesting. I've heard it being described that Carter really was a conservative Democrat on fiscal matters. And -- but he was very liberal on social issues. And that, in contrast, or perhaps it's in concert with the fact that he really was someone who grew up in the Jim Crow South. And he's being credited as really changing the South with his term as president.
 
ZELIZER: Well, I think it would be too much to give him all the credit for that. Lyndon Johnson, of course, already had been responsible for the Civil Rights Act of '64 and the Voting Rights Act of '65. But certainly Carter represented what we call the New South, a new younger generation that believed that the region had to break free from a really horrendous racial history.
 
And so, he did try to take steps to show his commitment to civil rights. And he himself embodied a new kind of voice for Southern leaders that until this day has been much more reflective, certainly of liberal Democrats from the region. And so he does deserve credit. And we want to always contextualize that credit.
 
WHITFIELD: Do you feel like he'll be remembered or perhaps celebrated most for the work he did after his presidency?
 
ZELIZER: He might be. And I'm not sure that's the right way to think about it. But his post-presidency was remarkable. As much as he did as president, he redefined what it meant to be a post-president. He used that platform, the power he amassed in the White House, to continue working through the Carter Center on issues such as democracy and diplomacy and negotiation.
 
And he was often very controversial. Many people did not agree with what he had to do. But the key was that once you leave the White House, public service is not over. And that was different than many presidents before and certainly many presidents since. And I think it remains a model that we will continue not only to discuss, but hopefully other post-presidents will emulate.
 
WHITFIELD: And as America now is in the midst of a transition, witnessing the end of one-term for President Biden, what lessons can the Democratic Party perhaps learn from Jimmy Carter?
 <br>[13:10:01]
 
ZELIZER: Well, the plus side will be to remember just how much a one- term president can do. And I think many people will think that of President Biden. He had a huge legislative record, even more than Jimmy Carter was able to amass. But at the same time, Carter, you know, shows that politics matters.
 
And that in the end, if your presidency ends with an opposition party taking power and one that really has very different views of the world, there's a high cost. And that will be some of the criticism level that Carter -- that Biden, that he didn't do enough to nurture the strength of the party in a similar way to Carter.
 
And so both in complex ways will be part of how we compare these presidencies.
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Julian Zelizer, great talking to you. Thank you so much. ZELIZER: Thank you.
 
WHITFIELD: Later tonight, the CNN film, "Jimmy Carter: Rock &amp; Roll President" explores how the 39th president formed lifelong bonds with artists like Willie Nelson, the Allman Brothers and Bob Dylan, and how his deep love of all kinds of music informed his storied life and career. "Jimmy Carter: Rock &amp; Roll President" airs tonight, 7:00 Eastern, right here on CNN.
 
The latest in the New Orleans terror case, new questions about the explosive devices planted inside coolers by the attacker. We'll have a live report.
 
And new video of the cybertruck driver at a Tesla charging station as he made his way to Las Vegas and detonated explosives in the truck outside a Vegas hotel.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[13:15:16]
 
WHITFIELD: All right, we're keeping a close eye on the White House, where President Joe Biden will award the Presidential Medal of Freedom to 19 exceptional honorees at the White House. It is the nation's highest civilian award.
 
Several people will be at the White House to receive the award. And among the big names, Denzel Washington, Hillary Clinton, and Bono. We'll bring you the ceremony live once it gets underway.
 
All right, now to the latest in the deadly New Orleans truck attack. Sources tell CNN investigators are trying to figure out where the former Army veteran got a rare organic compound used in the explosive devices that he planted along Bourbon Street.
 
And now temporary barriers designed to prevent a similar attack are in place, but questions remain about why those barriers were not in place before the New Year's Eve.
 
CNN's Rafael Romo is following all of this for us. Rafael, you have some reporting on a warning the city actually received years ago?
 
RAFAEL ROMO, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: That's right. Little by little, we're learning about the horrific details, and it is really quite terrifying when we learn about what happened. And CNN, one of those things that we have learned is that a security firm warned five years ago that the Bourbon Street area in New Orleans was especially vulnerable to a vehicular ramming attack.
 
Both the FBI and ATF say the killer set fire to the short-term rental property where he stayed to destroy evidence, including precursors for bomb-making material. The FBI also says the killer intended to use a transmitter found in his truck to set off two improvised explosive devices that he had previously placed on Bourbon Street.
 
In an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper, Louisiana Lieutenant Governor Billy Nungesser accused New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell of failing to secure Bourbon Street despite requests made years ago.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)
 
BILLY NUNGESSER, LOUISIANA LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: The mayor, the mayor and her team failed miserably. You know, today I sent out a video of the balusters in front of Jackson Square, historical Jackson. Two years we've been asking to get them replaced. I didn't let that out to the public because we didn't want people to know you could drive through that pedestrian mall.
 
(END VIDEOCLIP)
 
ROMO: New Orleans Mayor Cantrell said the day after the tragedy that over 10 years ago the city undertook an infrastructure project that included installing bollards on Bourbon Street, but they would frequently malfunction and had to be replaced. She also said at the time of the attack, there was already a plan in motion to get those bollards replaced.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)
 
MAYOR LATOYA CANTRELL, CITY OF NEW ORLEANS: We were able to build in bollard replacement into our Super Bowl infrastructure package. And because of that, the city of New Orleans has moved forward with that infrastructure that is nearing completion. Bollards were not up because they are near completion with the expectation of being completed of course by Super Bowl.
 
(END VIDEOCLIP)
 
ROMO: And Fred, we're also learning more about the victims. A royal source has told CNN that a British man killed in the New Orleans terrorist attack was the stepson of a woman who was the nanny of Prince William and Prince Harry.
 
British media reported Edward Pettifer was the stepson of Alexander Pettifer, formerly known as Tiggy Legge-Bourke, who served as nanny for both princes for several years and is remembered as someone who supported them after their parents Charles and Diana separated and especially following the death of the Princess of Wales.
 
Meanwhile, the Orleans parish coroner released a list of 12 of the 14 people who died in the attack. Seven of the victims were from Louisiana but there were also others from Alabama, Mississippi, New Jersey and New York as well as the British National. And one person who up to now remains unidentified, Fred.
 
WHITFIELD: Terrible. All right, keep us posted.
 
Rafael Romo, thank you so much.
 
All right, let's go back to the White House because very soon will be the Presidential Medal of Freedom extended to 19 honorees. Very notable ones. You're seeing the former President Clinton walking into the room right now because it will be his wife who is among the honorees. Hillary Clinton who is a former U.S. Secretary of State, Senator -- U.S. Senator as well.
 
Our Julia Benbrook is there and has much better detail about all the goings on there and what will happen and the many 19 some posthumously who will be honored today as well.
 
BENBROOK: Busy day here at the White House, and you can see people filing in for this moment. President Joe Biden of course going to be handing out those awards and we also expect to see First Lady Jill Biden as well as Vice President Kamala Harris and Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff in attendance.
 
Now, speaking of these awards in this moment, it really is a reflective time for people as they look back on their careers and their accomplishments.
 <br>[13:20:09]
 
And there -- this was a reflective moment for President Joe Biden back when he received it in 2017 from then-President Barack Obama. He surprised Biden with this award. It was quite an emotional moment and he told him it was for his lifetime of service.
 
I expect it will be a reflective moment for him today as well as he's preparing to say goodbye to a decades-long career in politics and to the presidency. And there are going to be some big political names, there are some big political names in that room already.
 
As you mentioned, Hillary Clinton is among those being honored as a former First Lady, former Secretary of State, and then the first woman to lead a major party ticket when she was a Democratic nominee for president back in 2016.
 
Also some prominent political figures are being honored posthumously including former Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy as well as former Michigan Republican Governor George Romney, the father of former Senator Mitt Romney.
 
Not just about politics today though, lots of areas are being represented. I think you could see some of those honorees walking in there. You're going to see world-renowned conservationist Jane Goodall, legendary basketball player Magic Johnson, Bill Nye the Science Guy, Vogue editor in chief Anna Wintour, award-winning actor Denzel Washington, and U2 frontman and philanthropist Bono.
 
So lots of different areas represented lots of different accomplishments, decades of service and time. You know, it'd be really interesting to hear what all these honorees have to say to each other about their careers and their different -- 
 
WHITFIELD: Yes.
 
BENBROOK: -- perspectives on life.
 
WHITFIELD: Yes. Something tells me -- I mean there's a lot of admiration we all have for many of the people that we're seeing, but then I can only imagine what kind of conversations the honorees are having with each other because, you know, they're got kind of gobsmacked and starstruck as well.
 
We're seeing right now, you know, Mitt Romney who's walking in and we just saw -- because his dad is being honored by the way -- we saw already taking the stage there to all the applause. Now we're seeing Denzel Washington walk in, we saw Jose Andres, we saw Bono, we saw Hillary Clinton, we saw Jane Goodall just as you were mentioning her name, Julia.
 
I think we just saw Anna Wintour walking in. I mean, I'll just kind of tick off some of the other names. Michael J. Fox will be an honoree. Tim Gill and we've got Fannie Lou Hamer posthumously who will be honored.
 
Robert F. Kennedy as you mentioned posthumously. Ralph Lauren who, Julia, did a great job earlier explaining how he has feted of the First Lady and her daughter or -- was it her daughter as well, during the wedding?
 
BENBROOK: So actually, first granddaughter Naomi Biden was married here at the White House in 2022 and she selected Ralph Lauren to wear for that event.
 
WHITFIELD: Yes.
 
BENBROOK: One that will go down in history books, you know, in that dress absolutely.
 
WHITFIELD: That's right. Lionel Messi will also be among the honorees and Bill Nye, the science guy as we continue to see people enter the room. Hey, what do you know about many of the folks who -- oh and there's the president right now along with Dr. Jill Biden entering the room to applause and lots of hugs and kisses there.
 
What do you know about the people who are in the room? I mean, of course, we the former president Bill Clinton, who is there to celebrate his wife Hillary Clinton among the honorees. Julia, maybe you can fill in some of the blanks before the President speaks.
 
Oh wait never mind.
 
BENBROOK: Well, in there he -- 
 
WHITFIELD: He's about to speak. Sorry, Julia. Let's listen to President Biden.
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Happy New Year.
 
ALL: Happy New Year.
 
BIDEN: As we gather in this room on January 2025, imagine March of 1865. President Lincoln had just delivered his inaugural address at the Capitol. The return to the White House for reception here in the East Room.
 
There were many well-wishers, but he spotted someone whose opinion he greatly valued. President Lincoln asked him what he thought of the speech he had just delivered to the nation by a divided civil war. The man replied it was a sacred effort. It was a sacred effort.
 
That man was Frederick Douglass. Here we are nearly 160 years later in a room where Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass stood to unify the nation.
 
I'm joined by our incredible First Lady Jill. We're joined by incredible Vice President Kamala Harris and Second Gentleman Doug. Doug, he's a hell of a lawyer, by the way.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
BIDEN: Finally going to get to practice again.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 <br>[13:25:10]
 
BIDEN: For the final time as president, I have the honor of bestowing the Medal of Freedom on our nation's highest civilian honor on a group of extraordinary truly extraordinary people who gave their sacred effort, their sacred effort to shape the culture and the cause of America.
 
So let me just say to each of you, thank you, thank you, thank you for all you've done to help this country.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
BIDEN: You all, you all literally embody the nation's creed a pluribus unum out of many one. Collecting the people of different backgrounds, beliefs, and talents from different generations and different genders using the remarkable gifts and unwavering passion to strengthen our resolve as one nation under God indivisible, liberty and justice for all.
 
It matters. It really does matter. As cultural icons to find statements should be a dignified statement. Humanitarians, rock stars, sports stars. You feed the hungry. You give hope to those who are hurting. And you craft the signs and sounds our movements and our memories.
 
You know it's amazing. Your innovation, you inspire, you bring healing and joy to so many lives otherwise wouldn't be touched. You answer the call to serve and led others to do the same thing. And you defend the values of America even when they're under attack which they have been as of late.
 
Together, you leave an incredible mark. And I mean this sincerely. This group of -- you leave an incredible mark on our country with insight and influence that can be felt around the globe in major cities and remote areas alike. Finding us closer as people and showing us that what's possible as a nation nothing beyond our capacity while representing your families, your communities, your ancestors with pride and appreciation at the same time.
 
I'd also like to take a moment to recognize those honorees who are no longer with us including the young man speaking. By the way, kids rule in this house, OK?
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
BIDEN: Don't worry about it.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
BIDEN: You all think I'm kidding, I'm not.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
BIDEN: Ash Carter, Ms. Fannie Lou Hammer, George Romney, Bobby Kennedy, heroes of the highest order. And Bobby Kennedy is one of my true political heroes. I love and I miss him dearly. I -- thank you, their families, all their families. You know as we carry on the sacred effort of courage and conviction that you all began.
 
So today, I want to congratulate you on all you've accomplished. And I'm grateful for the work you'll inspire for generations to follow, to stay engaged, to never give up, to always keep the faith. And that spirit from the people's house for Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass and generation of patriots before us have stood watch over the republic.

God bless you all and may God protect our troops.

(APPLAUSE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Distinguished guests, please remain in your seats as the president and --
 
WHITFIELD: All right. The ceremony of the Presidential Medal of Freedom. These are grand honorees spanning politics, sports, arts, humanitarian and courageous work. 
 
When we come back, we'll talk further about the honorees today with CNN's Julia Benbrook at the White House -- oh, actually, we're going to do it right now. 
 
OK. Julia Benbrook at the White House, along with CNN political analyst, Julian Zelizer, also with us. 
 
OK. So, Julia, wow, what a span of honorees here. And they all seemed so enthusiastic, honored. And I mean, also very touched, you know, to be named as honorees here. 
 
JULIA BENBROOK, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I think Biden said it well, not a bad group --
 
WHITFIELD: Right.
 
BENBROOK: -- right? You know, it's definitely a group that represents a wide range of accomplishments and a wide range of areas. 
 
And there were some kind of funny moments as they're listening to award-winning actor Denzel Washington's bio, I mean, award after award. And they said, "so far." You know, so he -- he got a good laugh out of that. 
 
You also had legendary basketball player, "Magic" Johnson. I think this maybe got the most laughter from the room, as he had to really bend down and hold that position just so they could get the medal on him, because he is so tall. 
 
And maybe the moment that stood out the most to me, Fredricka, was, of course, when Hillary Clinton received a standing ovation from the room. She stood on stage holding the presidents hand. 
 
And they went through her long list of accomplishments in politics, but ended with saying her nomination for president broke barriers and inspired generations.
 
And kind of a powerful visual there, sitting on the front row just a little bit in front of her was Vice President Kamala Harris. And just a little while ago, just a few months ago, speaking at the Democratic National Convention, Clinton spoke about how they had both put cracks into that glass ceiling. 
 
WHITFIELD: And, Julian, I mean, what's the message you see here in this incredible variety of recipients, from Hillary Clinton, George Romney, posthumously, Fannie Lou Hamer? What's the message you think Biden was sending here? 
 
JULIAN ZELIZER, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, he told the story. He started with the meeting between President Lincoln and Frederick Douglass. He moved through the honorees who were very diverse and represented the diversity of the United States. 
 
One of the most prominent female political figures of the last generation, Hillary Clinton, Fannie Lou Hamer, who was one of the iconic civil rights activists of the 1960s, who appeared at the 1964 convention demanding rights, to philanthropists.
 
And even George Romney, who represented a kind of civic moderate- Republican tradition that many feel has -- no longer with us. And, of course, Robert Kennedy, who is one of the icons for the president. 
 
So he told the story about the diversity of the country. And he came back to that at the end. And I think that's the message we learned from this list of honorees. 
 
WHITFIELD: Beautiful ceremony. Always fun to watch. And of course, who can forget what that moment was like for then-Vice President Joe Biden, who received the same honor from then-President Barack Obama? Now, full circle. 
 
All right, Julian Zelizer, Julia Benbrook, thanks to both of you. Appreciate it. 
 
A quick break. We'll be right back after this. 
 
Thank you.
