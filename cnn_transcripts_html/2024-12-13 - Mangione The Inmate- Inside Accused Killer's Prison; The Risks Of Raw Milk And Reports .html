(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
 
JASON CARROLL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It's the State Correctional Institution at Huntington, the oldest-operating state prison in Pennsylvania. 
 
Mangione's cell looks much like the one you see here, according to a law enforcement source. His actual cell is 15 by six feet. 
 
A Department of Corrections spokesperson says, "He's in a single cell and not in solitary confinement. He is not interacting with other inmates at this time. He has a bed, sink, toilet and a desk with a seat." 
 
STEVE BOHNEL, "PITTSBURGH POST-GAZETTE": It's always interesting to see, you know, a prison in your backyard that, you know, frankly, most people wouldn't be able to pick out of a map or wouldn't know the name of. 
 
And now everyone's interested in the type of food he's eating. You know, the cell block that he's in. 
 
CARROLL: Meals at the facility are served three times a day, 6:15, 10:40 and supper at 5:15. Tonight, on the menu, Mangione has a choice between chicken parmesan and a dish called pizza beans. 
 
The Department of Corrections says Mangione has taken his meals in his cell and is not interacting with other inmates.
 
Adding, "All inmates are afforded time outside their cells, even if they are a higher custody level. 
 
(SHOUTING)
 
CARROLL: Mangione's case has received a great deal of national attention, so perhaps no surprise he's already known to some inmates.
 
That type of notoriety is also an added security concern at a correctional facility. 
 
JUSTINE PAPERNY, PRISON CONSULTANT: Any prison, state or federal, is a predatory environment. And there could be prisoners who are there for a long time, perhaps looking to get in the media, get some attention. 
 
So he's got to learn to enjoy his own company in a little cell with a desk, with a toilet, with a little -- with a pen, to be able to write, with a sink, because he will not be around prisoners, as I see it, for quite some time. The prison just can't risk it.
 
CARROLL: Huntington's inmates have made headlines before Mangione. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Why did you do it? 
 
CARROLL: Cosmo DiNardo, who was convicted of murdering four men and burying them on his parents' property, served part of his life sentence there. 
 
Nick Yarris also served time there. Yarris was wrongly convicted and sentenced to death in 1982 on rape and murder charges. His sentence overturned in 2003 due to DNA evidence. 
 
He says his time at Huntington are years he will never forget.
 
NICK YARRIS, WRITER: Because he decided to send me to Huntington prison, the hardest prison in America at that time. 
 
JOE ROGAN, PODCAST HOST: What was he going to do before that? 
 
YARRIS: I don't know, but he made sure I went to a place that they broke you.
 
CARROLL: Mangione's time there could be measured in weeks, as prosecutors push to have him brought back to New York.

BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN HOST: Our thanks to Jason Carroll for that report. 
 
Coming up, growing concern from health officials about the risk of drinking raw milk. At least 10 illnesses now tied to the product in California alone. We're going to dig into those safety concerns with a medical expert in just moments. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[13:37:15]
 
BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: Today, the California Department of Public Health announcing that raw milk is to blame for at least 11 illnesses in the state. Just last month, raw milk and cream products from a California-based dairy, called Raw Farm, were recalled after samples tested positive for bird flu. 
 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has now announced that it will begin testing raw milk stored in dairy silos across the country. 
 
Raw milk is milk that has not undergone pasteurization, which is the process of heating milk to remove disease-causing germs, yeasts, molds, and other harmful microbes, according to the CDC. Joining me is Yale associate professor of public health, Dr. F. Perry
 
 Wilson. 
 
Dr. Wilson, thanks for taking the time to talk with us about this topic that I think, increasingly, people are really interested about. 
 
First off, just talk to us about the kinds of illnesses that we are seeing in this particular case. 
 
DR. F. PERRY WILSON, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF PUBLIC HEALTH, YALE UNIVERSITY: Sure, absolutely. 
 
And thanks for having me, Brianna. 
 
So, you know, milk inside a cows udder is actually sterile. Where these bacteria are coming from is from the skin of the cow, from the machines that take the milk away and store it from the environment that they're in, which is often not clean. 
 
And we see diseases like salmonella, E. coli, campylobacter, all bacterial diseases that affect the G.I. tract. And in people who are susceptible, like young children, older adults and people with immune compromising conditions, some of these can be fatal. 
 
KEILAR: Yes, I mean, that's pretty serious. 
 
I was surprised to learn that experts estimate, before pasteurization was adopted, beginning 100 years ago, roughly 25 percent of all disease outbreaks in the U.S. were actually milk borne. Just a staggering number. 
 
And yet, recently, you're seeing the popularity of raw milk and raw dairy products surging. It's got high-profile fans, including President-Elect Trump's choice to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, RFK Jr. 
 
So what benefits of raw milk have people ignoring those risks that you outlined? 
 
WILSON: I mean, to be honest, it's quite baffling. You know, pasteurization is one of the greatest public-health advances of the past two centuries. It's -- it's probably on the order of benefit that we see with, like, sanitation of water supplies. 
 
You know, I mean, this is -- people were dying of tuberculosis from raw milk in large numbers prior to the advent of pasteurization. 
 
Now, currently, the risk of infection is still relatively low. Most people get away with drinking raw milk, like most people get away, you know, driving without a seatbelt in their car. 
 
The problem is that sometimes you don't. And when you get in that accident, when you have that infected bottle of milk, you're going to wish it was pasteurized. You're going to wish you're wearing your seatbelt. 
 <br>[13:40:01]
 
In terms of benefits, scientifically, there really are none. There's no proven benefit. 
 
This seems to be driven a lot by hype and what we often refer to as the naturalistic fallacy, the idea that, because something is somehow more natural, more direct from nature, it is healthier. In this case, this is just really not true. 
 
KEILAR: So Raw Farm, for instance, which was the supplier I mentioned there of the milk that's been recalled, touts on its Web site, quote, "Bioavailable vitamins, minerals, enzymes, beneficial bacteria, naturally occurring CLA and omega three fatty acids." 
 
And when people read that, it sounds pretty good. So what do you say to people who, they have distrust in the food industry? And certainly there are examples that I think you might look at and say, OK, I understand why you may be a little skeptical.
 
But these are folks who may be won over by a description like that. 
 
WILSON: I mean, much of it is pseudoscientific nonsense for -- for lack of a better phrase. The truth is milk, all kinds of milk, is quite healthy. It does have vitamins and good fatty acids and things like that. 
 
The process of pasteurization, all it is -- this is not -- this is not, you know, ultra processing of food and making, you know, nacho chips. This is heating milk to 161 degrees Fahrenheit for 15 minutes. That's all it is. It's enough to kill the bacteria that's in there. 
 
You know, some people say, oh, but what about the good bacteria? Well, first of all, as I mentioned, the milk that comes out of a cow is sterile. There aren't good bacteria either. 
 
And if you want those probiotic bacteria, we've got great ways to get them. You can take pasteurized milk and people culture that, using known bacteria. And they make things like yogurt and other forms of cultured milk products from pasteurized milk. 
 
And you get all the benefits of healthy milk, plus these probiotics. So there are ways to do this. 
 
But, you know, I'm saying that pasteurization is doing anything to decrease the nutritional value of milk is really not based in science. 
 
KEILAR: So the USDA getting involved like this, announcing that it's going to begin testing raw milk stored in dairy silos across the country, is that going to be enough? 
 
WILSON: Well, to my knowledge, their main focus is on the H5N1 virus, which has infected, you know, millions of cattle across the country. And we're all, in the public health field, sort of holding our breaths, waiting to see if this will actually cause significant disease in humans. 
 
And so to the extent that humans are consuming raw milk that may be infected with H5N1, that could be a major public health concern. 
 
Some raw milk companies report that they are testing their milk for bacteria, which is -- which is great if people want to look for that, but they are not required to and not all farms do that. 
 
KEILAR: That's a very important note. 
 
Dr. Perry Wilson, thanks for being with us. 
 
WILSON: Any time.
 
KEILAR: Boris? 
 
SANCHEZ: Now to some of the other headlines we're watching this hour. 
 
A Florida woman is accused of threatening her health insurance company using words linked to the killing of the UnitedHealthcare CEO.
 
According to an affidavit, Briana Boston called Blue Cross/Blue Shield about a denied claim. And at the end of the call, she said, "Delay, deny, depose. You people are next." 
 
The words "delay, deny, depose," were allegedly written on the shell casings found at the scene of Brian Thompson's killing. 
 
Boston is now charged with threats to conduct a mass shooting or an act of terrorism. She says she does not own any guns and is not a real threat to anyone. 
 
Also, dramatic video out of Michigan showing a box truck slamming into a fire truck on an icy interstate. The truck hitting two other fire vehicles and a car before rolling over and skidded to a stop. 
 
You see it there, again. Amazingly, the truck driver only suffered minor injuries. And fortunately, no one was hurt. 
 
And a world-renowned cellist was forced to cancel a concert in Toronto after Canada's largest airline refused to give his priceless cello a seat on the plane. 
 
Sheku Kanneh-Mason, famous for playing at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding, says Air Canada denied the $3 million antique instrument the seat that he purchased for it. He actually purchased a seat for it.
 
After nine hours at the airport, he says he had no choice but to call off the show. He says he's now working to reschedule for next year. 
 <br>[13:44:26]
 
Coming up, a 125-year-old rivalry is about to see it's next big battle, Army-Navy. Brianna is pumped. It is about to go down. Well take you live to Northwest Stadium with a preview. Stay with us. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) KEILAR: It's one of the most legendary matchups in American college sports, tomorrow's 125th Army-Navy game, held just outside the nation's capital. There's, of course, the joy of trash talk and bragging rights, and the pride of hoisting up that shiny commander-in- chief trophy. 
 
But what you also see on the field is a shared culture of hard work, sacrifice and grit. While Navy and Army face off on Saturday, in the future, they'll be working together to defend the United States. That bond underlines every part of the game. 
 
Navy Coach Brian Newberry has said, "What you're seeing with us and Army is a reflection of developmental programs with players that are selfless, play for each other, play for a team, play for a country." That's what he said to "Yahoo Sports" in an interview. 
 <br>[13:50:07]
 
And Coy Wire is with us now from Northwest Stadium in Landover, Maryland. 
 
And, Coy, you played pro ball. What makes this rivalry so different and stand out in an almost mythical way? 
 
COY WIRE, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR: It's -- you know, I played in NFL playoff games, played in the Rose Bowl, and, Brianna, there's nothing that can match the tradition, the pageantry. 
 
This game is all about honor and respect. And these Army and Navy players, after the game, they're going to be hugging. They're going to be crying together. Because they know that they are brothers who have -- are willing to sacrifice everything for this nation. It's incredible bond. 
 
But, Brianna, let me just say, on the field on game day, they will be going at it. This is one of the most passionate, heated rivalries in all of sports. 
 
And we asked the players and coaches about that. Listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DABA POFANA, NAVY MIDSHIPMAN #45, FULLBACK: I feel like it has something to do with our hatred for each other, you know, because -- and also the fact that this game is always so close. It's always -- it's always defined by one or two mistakes. 
 
BRYSON DAILY, ARMY BLACK KNIGHTS #13, QUARTERBACK: When you go into service together, after you get to kind of hold that against them and, you know, let them have it, you know, for the rest of your careers, for the rest of the jobs in your careers. You know, that really doesn't happen in any other college sports rivalry. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WIRE: All right, dating back to 1890, Brianna, I mentioned that tradition and pageantry. One of those traditions is the running of the game ball. 
 
Check this out, west -- Army, West Point Marathon Team, they started this 300-mile journey in West Point, New York. They we're running through the night, through the cold. They started on Wednesday all the way here to the home of the NFL's Washington Commanders in Landover, Maryland.
 
And communities all along the way, they come out, they support them, they cheer them on. And they finish that journey right here at midfield. Just moments ago, handing the ball to Colonel Chad Foster, deputy commandant. 
 
I asked them what makes this tradition, this game, one of the greatest rivalries in the world.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOSIE OBERTON, ARMY, WEST POINT CLASS OF 2025: Coming in at the end, our captains let me carry the ball in, which was super special. So really appreciative for that moment. 
 
COL. CHAD FOSTER, ARMY, WEST POINT CLASS OF 1998: It's amazing to think about the distance that this team ran. You know, about 300 miles, you know, throughout the night across many states. And it's -- its impressive. 
 
And to receive it down here, to be the first one that gets to touch the ball here on the field, it's a -- it's a big deal. All the fire and police stations we're stopping by. And the police escorts we have It's -- its super inspirational. 
 
So we've got people cheering for us on the side of the road. It's -- its just all those small moments, sir. They're really incredible. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WIRE: Army and Navy game, it is. 
 
To highlight some of the best, brightest young leaders who've committed themselves to a lifetime of service for all of us. It's a rivalry like no other, Brianna. 
 
And I know you have a little bit of Army ties. Husband, Green Beret. 
 
So to bring a little bit of balanced journalism to this report, I say go Navy.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
WIRE: But I know you're probably not wanting to hear all that. 
 
KEILAR: Don't take sides against the family, Coy. 
 
Yes, I mean, I'm wearing my -- my Army black and gold. I'm ready for the game. I've got my jersey.
 
But I think, you know, even when the teams are doing so-so, the rivalry is strong. 
 
But let's just be clear about the football this year. These are -- these teams are doing great. 
 
WIRE: Yes. We just recently had the first-ever overtime game. And they always come down to like the final kick it seems. And it's incredible. 
 
No matter how good these teams are -- Army's ranked 22nd in the nation. Their win totals on both sides are as high as they've been in quite some time. 
 
So this game is about to be off the charts, packed, and it's going to be full of emotion. I can't wait to see what they have for us in store. 
 
Kickoff tomorrow is set for 3:00 p.m. Eastern. 
 
KEILAR: OK. And tell us a little bit about these jerseys. I'm actually holding up the Army jersey. This is it here. OK, here's the camera. And this is the back of it. 
 
Tell us about -- every year they do a very cool thing. So tell us what they have going on this year.
 
WIRE: Yes. First of all, how did you get your hands on one of those? Because we've been trying to get our hands on one of those. I think I know how. You have some pretty good ties. 
 
But, yes, this is one of the coolest traditions. Each year, these teams have custom handmade painted helmets. And each of the uniforms, they reflect a certain era. 
 
And I'm looking for you because I didn't know we were going to do this. But Army, they honor the 101st Airborne Division. Nearly 80 years ago, the Screaming Eagles, they raced into the town of Bastogne in response to the Nazi -- Nazi offensive that became known as the Battle of the BNulge, of course. 
 
And they were encircled by Nazi forces. They endured weeks of relentless attack in close combat, in the freezing cold weather. And so that's what those uniforms are about, those little flecks of snow that you see on there. It's incredible. 
 <br>[13:55:10]
 
And these players and the fans cheering them on, they are able to help that history, that strong history, the shoulders upon which this nation has been built. 
 
And honoring those, even who've come long before them. It's a truly special Army-Navy game, one of the best that will ever see in all of sports. 
 
KEILAR: Yes, and I reluctantly admit that the Navy uniform is also pretty cool. 
 
But we're going to see tomorrow who wins. I think I know who it's going to be, but it can be a nail biter, so we'll see. 
 
But of course, Coy, go Army, beat Navy. We'll see tomorrow.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
KEILAR: And we'll be right back.
