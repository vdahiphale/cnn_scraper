UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is CNN Breaking News.
 
BIANNA GOLODRYGA, CNN HOST: Hello, everyone. Live from New York, I'm Bianna Golodryga. Zain is off today. You are watching ONE WORLD.
 
Nothing short of miraculous. That's what the Hostages Families Forum calls the rescue and return of an Israeli hostage from Gaza today.
 
The Israeli military rescued a 52-year-old hostage who was abducted by Hamas on October 7th. The IDF says Kaid Farhan Al-Qadi was being held in an 
 
 underground tunnel in southern Gaza. He was working at a kibbutz packing factory when he was kidnapped on October 7th.
 
You're looking at family members literally running to greet him at a hospital in Israel earlier today. Just unbelievable images there. And you 
 
 see a photo with his brother. Al-Qadi is an Israeli Bedouin, father of 11 and grandfather.
 
The IDF describes the rescue of a complex mission.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DANIEL HAGARI, SPOKESPERSON, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES: His family had been waiting 326 days to receive the news they did today. But there are still 
 
 108 hostages whose families are still waiting.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLODRYGA: CNN's Jeremy Diamond joins us now from Tel Aviv.
 
Quite a miraculous day indeed, Jeremy, to see the family members there running towards the hospital knowing that their loved one, after so many 
 
 days being held captive was finally returning home to them. He is said to be in stable and in good medical condition right now.
 
But what's so fascinating about this rescue because there have been eight hostages that have been rescued alive throughout the course of these 10 
 
 months is that this hostage was rescued in an underground tunnel.
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that's right. This is the first time that the Israeli military has successfully rescued a hostage 
 
 alive from one of those tunnels beneath the Gaza Strip where we know many of the hostages have indeed been held.
 
We have seen them recover of course a number of bodies from tunnels. But this is the first time that a hostage has actually been rescued alive from 
 
 those tunnels. And that, of course, is significant in previous operations where hostages were rescued alive. They were being held above ground. So 
 
 this is a new development in that sense.
 
Kaid Farhan Al-Qadi was a 52 -- is a 52-year-old father of 11. He was held by Hamas for 326 days after he was taken hostage while he was working at a 
 
 kibbutz near the Gaza Strip on the morning of October 7th. He was working as a security guard at a factory there.
 
He was taken hostage alongside hundreds of other Israelis. And only today was he finally reunited with his family. His brother saying today that they 
 
 had begun to lose hope that he might even emerge from the Gaza Strip alive. And then suddenly, they received this phone call telling them to come to 
 
 Soroka Medical Center in the southern Israeli city of Beersheba (ph).
 
He said that the joy he felt was even greater than the joy of seeing a newborn child. And that's because in his view, his brother was resurrected 
 
 today. Resurrected as he was rescued by Israeli forces inside the Gaza Strip.
 
We also have images from the Israeli military showing his first moment with Israeli soldiers in what appears to be a home or a building inside of the 
 
 Gaza Strip. He was then airlifted by helicopter brought to that medical center in Beersheba where doctors say that he is in good medical condition. 
 
 Although it does look like he's lost quite a bit of weight during his nearly 11 months in captivity.
 
But certainly some good news for the family. The hostage family form, as you noted, called this a miraculous recovery. But they also noted something 
 
 that is very clearly and well understood in Israeli society. And that is to say that these military operations to rescue these hostages alive are 
 
 incredibly rare.
 
As you said, only eight hostages have been rescued alive by the Israeli military operations. And so there is an understanding that the majority of 
 
 the remaining hostages will not be rescued in this way. Instead, they will emerge from Gaza only once there is a ceasefire and hostage release deal. 
 
 The details of which are still being negotiated in Cairo.
 
GOLODRYGA: And, of course, we remember the horrific news just a week ago where six hostages, the remains of six hostages, were discovered and 
 
 brought back to Israel to be buried. 
 <br>[12:05:05]
 
Quite a different day today. A country really experiencing joy and that was a really powerful moment in a photo released by that hospital where you see 
 
 this hostage that recovering standing there with a family member. Obviously Muslim-Israeli standing next to there. You see a Jewish-Israeli doctor. We 
 
 don't see images like this every single day.
 
And, Jeremy, as you note, his brother saying that we are -- we hope there will be celebration not just by us, by all -- but by all the families of 
 
 hostages that they will enjoy this experience as well.
 
"The New York Times" reporting incidentally that this discovery was made by chance as the IDF was on a mission. In one of those tunnels. We'll talk to 
 
 the reporter behind that reporting later on in the hour.
 
Jeremy Diamond, thank you so much.
 
Well, it's not a question of if but when. Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Ukraine will undoubtedly respond to the latest deadly Russian bombardment warning 
 
 that crimes against humanity cannot go unpunished.
 
For the second straight night, Russian missiles and drones rain down throughout Ukraine, killing at least five people and setting off waves of 
 
 panic throughout the country.
 
The onslaught comes one day after Russia unleashed its largest aerial attack on Ukraine since the start of the war. And it comes as President 
 
 Zelenskyy calls on the West to lift restrictions on the use of long range weapons inside of Russia.
 
CNN Salma Abdelaziz joins me now live in Russia. Live -- I'm sorry, in London.
 
And, Salma, it was notable to hear from President Zelenskyy again today reiterating on the urgent aid they still need from the West, from the 
 
 United States, in particular.
 
ABDELAZIZ: Absolutely. And it's not just about the aid they need, but it's about the rules that they have to abide by when they receive that military 
 
 equipment.
 
For a second day in a row now, Ukrainians have endured this massive Russian air assault. President Zelenskyy says that the country's air force has been 
 
 able to repel some 230 attacks on Monday, but still absolutely those drones, those missiles are getting through, and they are wreaking havoc.
 
You're looking at aftermath pictures right now of rubble. Emergency responders trying to dig through those scenes, trying to find survivors.
 
And you also have a power grid across the country that's been impacted, because that's the target here for Russia, to hit the country's civilian 
 
 infrastructure, to affect its ability to run power, turn on water, or whatever it may be for that daily life activities. That is the target for 
 
 Russian.
 
President Zelenskyy says there's very little he can do to stop it if he doesn't have these restrictions lifted.
 
There's two things he wants. First, he wants to use those long-range missiles that he's been provided by the U.S. and NATO. He wants to use 
 
 those long-range missiles to hit inside Russia, to hit targets at the source on Russian territory.
 
Secondly, he wants to be able to use those air defense capabilities, again provided by NATO, right up to Russian airspace.
 
Now, of course, Western officials may gawk at this. They may cringe at this because they fear that this could potentially escalate the conflict with 
 
 President Putin, aggravate tensions on the ground.
 
But President Zelenskyy says, this is my only option. This is the only way that I can fight back.
 
He also points to a very mixed battlefield picture. Of course, this air assault begins to shift the narrative potentially in Russia's favor. But 
 
 you still have Ukrainians making gains on Russian territory in Kursk where they're claiming more and more settlements are taken.
 
But again, with that mixed battlefield picture, you have further in Eastern Ukrainian forces on the back foot as Russia advances further.
 
So, you're going to hear President Zelenskyy yet again, as you mentioned, appeal not just for weapons, but for a change of rules when it comes to 
 
 those weapons.
 
GOLODRYGA: And that appeal not coming just from the president in Ukraine, but also from some of his cabinet officials who will be traveling to 
 
 Washington this week, including his defense minister to make the same appeals of government officials here in the United States.
 
Salma Abdelaziz, thank you so much.
 
Well, two weeks from today, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are scheduled to meet for their first debate of the campaign. But it is still unclear if it 
 
 will even happen.
 
Trump continues to question about whether ABC can be a fair host for the debate. And his campaign says Harris is trying to change the rules by 
 
 insisting that the candidates' microphones remain live during the entire debate. No muting allowed.
 
Harris' social media team is taunting Trump, effectively calling him chicken.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[12:10:03]
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why not debate her?
 
DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Well, wait. But because they already know everything. They say, oh, Trump's, you know, not doing the 
 
 debate. It's same thing they say now. I mean, right now -- 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLODRYGA: Trump says he doesn't care about the mics, but says asking for a rules change is not fair.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TRUMP: Doesn't matter to me. I'd rather have it probably on, but the agreement was that it would be the same as it was last time.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLODRYGA: CNN's Alayna Treene is tracking the Trump campaign for us. And, Alayna, we're also learning that Trump is planning to name R.K. Jr. and 
 
 Tulsi Gabbard as honorary co-chairs of a presidential transition team, perhaps getting ahead of himself. But these nominations raising eyebrows 
 
 following their endorsements earlier of the former president.
 
In the meantime, all eyes are going to be on whether or not we actually will see him on stage on that ABC debate with Kamala Harris on the 10th. 
 
 What are you hearing?
 
ALAYNA TREENE, CNN REPORTER: That's right. Well, I'm going to start with the first part of that, Bianna, because it is interesting that they're 
 
 naming RFK. Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard to his transition team.
 
It is normal for candidates, presidential candidates, particularly once they officially become the nominee to start planning for a transition. We 
 
 know that the Harris campaign is doing that as well.
 
But the reason this is interesting is because, first of all, they were both former Democrats. Tulsi Gabbard was a Democrat. She actually ran for 
 
 president in 2020 as a Democrat, had faced off with Harris herself on the debate stage.
 
And then RFK. Jr., of course, he did end up switching his candidacy to independent last year when he ran for president.
 
But the Trump campaign has spent the last several months attacking him as radically liberal, as a progressive in conservative clothing to kind of get 
 
 to the point that he's trying to have it both ways.
 
So just keep that in mind. It is interesting. I mean, clearly, this is all politics. This isn't anything new where you see, you know, strange 
 
 bedfellows, particularly in an election year.
 
But the fact that they are being named to the transition team, I think just gives you a sense of how much the Trump team is planning to deploy both of 
 
 them as they continue to look ahead to the sprint to November.
 
But as for the debate, I recognize, Bianna, that this seems very processing. It's, you know, the debate over the debate. It's not anything 
 
 new when it comes to these types of debates.
 
But it's important. And I think the reason that, you know, this idea about whether the mics will be on or off, whether it'll be on for the entire 
 
 debate or it'll only be on when one person is speaking, all that comes down to, I think, the big picture here, which is both campaigns recognize how 
 
 important this debate is going to be. It's really going to be one of the last defining moments of this election cycle.
 
And both of them, of course, if you look back at the June 27th debate with CNN, with our network, that was an incredibly momentous day because that is 
 
 really what set off the chain of events that led to President Joe Biden ending his campaign. So the stakes are very high. Both Trump's team and the 
 
 Harris team knows this.
 
Now, when I talk to Donald Trump's team about this, even though, you know, there's a question, will he or won't he debate? Will he end up pulling out? 
 
 It's hard to say you never know with Donald Trump. You cannot make predictions.
 
But I can tell you that from my conversations, his team genuinely believes that Donald Trump does want to debate. He does feel like it's an 
 
 obligation. I think the Trump campaign also recognizes how much of a bad look it would be if he were to pull out now that we're only two weeks away 
 
 from it.
 
The question more so is really this jockeying about the rules and what it will look like. And both candidates are very focused on trying to get any 
 
 sort of advantage they can in that -- on that stage for this very high stakes showdown.
 
And I also think, you know, one thing that I just want to point out as well is just some of the hypocrisy from both campaigns on this. I mean, 
 
 originally when Joe Biden's campaign was the one that had pushed for the mics to be turned off in that first debate, Trump's team criticized it 
 
 before recognizing that it actually could serve Donald Trump better.
 
The Harris campaign, for their part have said, you know, when they wanted a September 10th ABC debate, that those are the rules that everyone had to 
 
 abide by the rules. But now they're saying they never because they weren't -- the Biden campaign -- the Biden campaign was the ones that had made 
 
 those rules. Now they're saying we are allowed to negotiate these.
 
And so all sides all to be said are trying to do whatever they can get to get an edge over their opponent.
 
Bianna.
 
Golodryga: And obviously this makes it very clear just how high the stakes are for both candidates, really because this is the only debate that both 
 
 sides had agreed to. Now, Trump sort of saying, you know, stay tuned, we'll see.
 
But as you said, he also has a lot to lose by not following through on that commitment to debate Kamala Harris, and it's likely the only debate that 
 
 we'll see between the two of them before Election Day.
 
Alayna Treene, thank you so much for breaking it down for us. Appreciate it.
 
Well, prominent Latino civil rights group in Texas is now calling for a federal investigation into a series of state raids targeting democratic 
 
 activists and leaders last week.
 
It was all part of a voter fraud inquiry conducted by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. The group is accusing Paxton's office of carrying out 
 
 illegal searches and says the attorney general is using his authority to harass and intimidate Latino nonprofit organizations. Now, no charges have 
 
 been filed in any targets against the targets of the searches.
 <br>[12:15:18]
 
CNN's Jessica Schneider joins me now live from Washington. Jessica, what's the latest here?
 
JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Bianna, this is the Latino civil rights group, LULAC. And because of these searches last week, 
 
 they've sent a letter to the Justice Department, and they're saying that their members are being targeted as part of this attempt, they say, by 
 
 Texas Republican officials to suppress the Latino votes. Now they want Justice Department officials to step in.
 
You know, our team in Texas, they've talked to several members of this Latino organization. And they've gotten many accounts of homes being 
 
 searched in the last week. The people whose homes were searched, they say, electronic devices were taken, other personal items confiscated. 
 
So here's the account from one 87-year-old woman, who's part of this group. She said armed officers from the attorney general's office showed up at her 
 
 home last week before the sun was even up.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LIDIA MARTINEZ, MEMBER, LEAGUE OF UNITED LABOR AMERICAN CITIZENS: They came in, and they -- two of them went into my bedroom and started searching 
 
 everything. They searched all my house, my storeroom, my refrigerator, my kitchen cabinets, everything. 
 
And I said, can I help you? What are you looking for? And they said, anything to do with voter registration.
 
They questioned me for three hours. And at one point, they had me outside in front of all my neighbors while they searched the living room. And they 
 
 never let me get dressed. And it was just very embarrassing and intimidating harassment.
 
They searched everything in my house.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SCHNEIDER: OK. So what is this all about? Well, it appears to be an effort from the Attorney General Ken Paxton to investigate what he's calling 
 
 alleged voter fraud.
 
So he sent out a notice last week, and in it, were allegations that some groups might be illegally registering non-citizens to vote in Texas.
 
What's interesting about Paxton's announcement, though, is the only example he gave is that his officials have noticed groups sitting outside 
 
 departments of motor vehicles registering people to vote. That's actually quite common.
 
And so far, we really haven't seen anything from the attorney general's office about any particular effort to register people who aren't citizens.
 
So again, Bianna, this is why that Latino group is now asking the Justice Department to step in and investigate. DOJ officials are telling us that 
 
 they have received this letter, but they're refusing to comment any further.
 
But this is, you know, Bianna, a really just part of the flurry of potentially false allegations and confusion that we might actually see more 
 
 of as we head into the 2024 election that's just about two months away.
 
You know, some of these Republican officials are maybe trying to sow confusion or doubt about the vote. And this is just one example in Texas. 
 
 So we'll see what happens as we move more toward the election.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes. And as you noted, the DOJ has not responded in terms of how and if they will respond. I'm just curious, either way, if they do or 
 
 don't, what signal does this send to other states that are potentially looking to follow suit.
 
SCHNEIDER: Well, yes. I mean, it sort of, you know, opens the door to other officials to maybe take similar action, whether it's founded or not. 
 
 Unfortunately, the Justice Department, they often move relatively slowly in initiating investigations.
 
I mean, they do it very thoroughly. But there's a lot of time right now for officials to, like I said, kind of sowed out, create confusion, maybe 
 
 target people with allegations of voter fraud. And this is just one really big example that we're seeing in Texas.
 
You know, Ken Paxton has, you know, made similar false claims before relating to the election back in 2020. He filed a lawsuit that was 
 
 eventually tossed out about voter fraud. So he's been at the leading edge of this.
 
But like you -- like you referenced, Bianna, I mean, this might give the green light to other officials to try something similar in other states.
 
GOLODRYGA: All right. Jessica Schneider, I'll be following this closely for us. Thank you so much.
 
Well, the games are about to begin. We'll take you back to the Olympic Village for a look at the challenges Paralympic athletes have to overcome, 
 
 not just to make it to the games, but just to get around Paris itself. Stay tuned.
 
Plus, Apple is expected to unveil its latest iPhone in a couple of weeks fully equipped with, you guessed it, AI. We'll give you a sneak peek.
 
And later, wow, the Gallagher brothers have decided not to look back in anger. Oasis is back. So what's behind this huge brotherly band reunion?

GOLODRYGA: Well, the torch is making its way to Paris for tomorrow's opening ceremony of the 2024 Paralympic Games. Organizers say 1.75 million 
 
 tickets have been sold. More than 4,400 athletes will compete in 22 sports and medals will be awarded in 549 events.
 
Sixteen-time gold medalist Jessica Long described the feeling of competing in her sixth Paralympics.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JESSICA LONG, U.S. PARALYMPIAN: Being here in Paris has been so exciting, right? Everywhere I look, it's the Olympic rings and the Agitos. I think 
 
 that's huge for us, especially even our credentials.
 
I am so excited to compete. For me, this is kind of just the icing on the cake.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLODRYGA: While the Paralympics are a celebration of overcoming challenges, Paris has to prove that it has to overcome its own challenge, 
 
 having accessibility across the city.
 
Only a quarter of the city's rail services are reportedly wheelchair- friendly. However, the city is offering minibuses to take disabled visitors to the venues. And there's an app to help prepare their journeys.
 
We're joined now by Craig Spence. He is the Chief Brand and Communication Specialist for the International Paralympic Committee. Thank you so much.
 
We are so excited to kick off these games after an incredible Olympics earlier this summer.
 
So talk to us about what is actually being done to make this accessible for those that are going to be competing today. What differences, what 
 
 investments have we seen over the past few years in preparation?
 
CRAIG SPENCE, CHIEF BRAND AND COMMUNICATION SPECIALIST FOR THE INTERNATIONAL PARALYMPIC COMMITTEE: Well, when Paris won the right to stage 
 
 these games in 2017, from the outset, they said, look, let's try to create the facilities for the games that are accessible.
 
For previous Paralympic games, accessibility was often not an afterthought, and they invested in ramps post-Olympic games.
 
Here, Paris has created a very good accessible environment. Yesterday, I was in the Paralympic village, and one athlete said to me, if the whole 
 
 world was built like a Paralympic village, then the world's 1.3 billion persons with disabilities could get around much easier.
 
Away from the village, the city of Paris has invested 125 million euros trying to improve accessibility in the city.
 
Now, Paris is one of the world's most historic cities. And it's impossible to make it accessible in the seven years that a city has to prepare for the 
 
 games, but they've done a great job.
 <br>[12:25:04]
 
The overground transport system here for buses is 100 percent accessible, so people can get around.
 
And the Paralympics is an accelerator. What we want to see is this great work continue post games and I've got great confidence that that will 
 
 happen.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes. There's an "NPR" headline that Paris has become more accessible for the disabled. Will it last after the Olympics?
 
And this comes as an agreement with local officials has been made to make the Metro more handicapped accessible in 20 years.
 
Craig, this still is an issue for those, not only competing in these games, but residents in Paris as well.
 
When you hear that headline, do you really view this as an impetus being put on this specific issue? Twenty years is a long time.
 
SPENCE: Absolutely. I mean, change doesn't happen overnight. Paris is a city that was probably built hundreds of years ago. And at that time, 
 
 accessibility wasn't front of mind.
 
But the Paralympic Games here has acted as a catalyst to the city authorities and the government treating accessibility for persons with 
 
 disability seriously for the first time.
 
The fact that the Ile-de-France Region yesterday announced that they were willing to make the metro accessible, even if it takes 20 years, is a 
 
 mammoth step forward for persons with disabilities who live here and visit here each year.
 
It's going to cost 20 billion euros, but that's a huge step forward. And now we need the city of Paris and the government to join forces with the 
 
 Ile-de-France Region to make what is a great vision for reality.
 
GOLODRYGA: We know there were a lot of hurdles in the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, not least of which obviously being COVID.
 
But what lessons have been learned on this front from 2020 that have been implemented here and addressed in Paris in '24?
 
SPENCE: Well, Tokyo was a great city when it came to transport infrastructure. When Tokyo won the right to host the games, 71 percent of 
 
 their metro stations were accessible.
 
By the time the games took place, it was 100 percent. And I think Paris has seen that and said, look, we need to do something similar.
 
The fact that the city of Paris has invested in overground transport so that it's fully accessible on the buses is a huge step forward.
 
And once the games finished, they can look underground and try to out the metro. But the metro is one of the world's oldest systems when it comes to 
 
 transport infrastructure. So it will take 20 years.
 
But if you look back even further to the Barcelona 1992 Paralympic Games, Barcelona was one of the most inaccessible cities in Europe before it 
 
 hosted the Games.
 
The Games was the catalyst to investing into accessibility across the city. Today, many years on from the Barcelona Games, the city is one of the most 
 
 accessible cities in Europe attracting hundreds of thousands of tourists with disabilities each year. And hopefully Paris can do the same.
 
GOLODRYGA: We are with you in that hope and just hoping for a wonderful Olympics and seeing that these athletes, these Paralympic athletes coming 
 
 together, some 4,400 of them competing in 22 sports. We will be watching and so proud of them really cheering them on the toughest of the toughest.
 
Craig Spence from the International Paralympic Committee, thank you so much. Best of luck with the Games.
 
SPENCE: Thank you very much.
 
GOLODRYGA: And still to come for us, more on that complex operation to rescue an Israeli hostage held in a Gaza tunnel. We'll have details about 
 
 the 52-year-old man freed after nearly 11 months in captivity.
 
Plus, a school in Northern Israel prepares to open its doors in a new location after violence forced it to move away from the border with 
 
 Lebanon.
 
Ahead, a look at how school officials and students have been coping.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JIM SCIUTTO, CNN HOST: The school is outside the evacuation zone in the north, but it's still within range of rockets and missiles and drones from 
 
 Lebanon. So it has air raid shelters like this one.

 <br>[12:30:44]
 
GOLODRYGA: Welcome back to ONE WORLD. I'm Bianna Golodryga.
 
More now on our top story. The Israeli military rescued a hostage abducted by Hamas on October 7th. Here you see him in the hospital in Southern 
 
 Israel with his brother by his side. Full of smiles.
 
Here's a little more of what we've now learned about Kaid Farhan Al-Qadi. He's a 52-year-old father of 11 children. He's an Israeli citizen from 
 
 Rahat. The IDF rescued Al-Qadi after 326 days being held by Hamas. The Hostages Families Forum says he was kidnapped October 7th while working as 
 
 a security guard at a kibbutz.
 
Meantime, we've just learned the technical ceasefire talks are headed to Doha on Wednesday. That's according to a U.S. official. They've been in 
 
 Cairo for the last few days.
 
Mediators from the U.S., Qatar, and Egypt continue to try to work to close the remaining gaps in a hostage and ceasefire deal.
 
Well, time now for The Exchange. My conversation with one of Israel's leading investigative journalists. We're joined by our friend "New York 
 
 Times Magazine" journalist, Ronen Bergman.
 
Ronen, it's been a busy day for you. You broke the story that Kaid Farhan Al-Qadi was found by chance during an Israeli operation to capture a Hamas 
 
 tunnel network beneath Gaza.
 
What more are we learning about this rescue operation?
 
RONEN BERGMAN, STAFF WRITER, NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINE: Bianna, thank you.
 
The operation which is still taking place, this is why Israeli forces are keeping the exact location of this tunnel network a secret is one of many 
 
 operations. Always ready forces to cover, get control, clear, find out whatever they can in the tunnels in the past. Hundreds of miles long 
 
 network of tunnels.
 
Now, there's a procedure how to clear a tunnel, how to make sure that this tunnel doesn't have bobby traps or Hamas militants.
 
In every tunnel, there is a chance to find a live Israeli hostage, which are kept, fortunately underground, or regretfully, a body of one.
 
But as I was told by two Israeli senior officials, as the forces got underground as deep, as 25 yards underground, they bumped into a door. And 
 
 after thedoor, after taking the precautions, they found Mr. Farhan, who was there, exhausted, couldn't get out, but was left there alone. 
 <br>[12:35:27]
 
There was no Hamas captors. There were no other hostages, alive or dead. And why he was left alone, maybe he was left there, as we see of other 
 
 (INAUDIBLE) with many other cases, sometimes Hamas militants believe that they are under threat.
 
They leave the hostage locked in, they flee, they come back. Maybe this time they ran away, but they couldn't get back or for whatever reason. But 
 
 he's the first Israeli hostage being rescued from inside the town (INAUDIBLE). And searches are still being -- are still going on by the IDF 
 
 to maybe find others or any other traces for Hamas and the other material or records Hamas militants left behind.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes. I would imagine that officials will be asking him more information about whether he did, in fact, come across other hostages in 
 
 those tunnels during his time there.
 
And, Ronen, what does this mean in terms of potential pressure this puts on Yahya Sinwar, that a successful operation like this in a tunnel in Rafah 
 
 brings out a hostage alive in the middle of hostage negotiation talks when we know that there had been renewed pessimism just over the last 48 hours 
 
 or so about the outcome of these talks.
 
What, if any difference does today's news make?
 
BERGMAN: So I believe there would be no effect. If there was one hostage in the hands of Hamas, one is -- Gilad Shalit was Israeli soldier that was at 
 
 the hand of Hamas, despite Israeli efforts to negotiate a deal for almost five and a half years a decade ago, that this discussion might take place.
 
This could have an effect, but Hamas has in its captivity in the tunnels in dire conditions, dozens, many dozens of still alive Israeli soldiers and 
 
 civilians, women and children and elderly men and women. So they have so many, even if half of them are released, still the problem of how to 
 
 release the others will remain as the main issue that Israel has not able to solve militarily.
 
And Israeli officials, high-rank officials, already said repeatedly, this will not be the 1976 Entebbe raid. This will not all of them could be 
 
 rescued in military reparation. They can only be rescued and they are getting fewer and fewer because they're being killed or dying or murdered. 
 
They can only be rescued through a deal with Hamas. That deal, as you said, the officials from the U.S. and Qatar, Egypt and Israel, the officials are 
 
 pessimistic into the chances that the meeting tomorrow in Doha will get us the Middle East anywhere closer into the deal.
 
The deal is not just a deal about the hostage. Of course, it's about the hostage and rescuing their lives because they will not -- they will not 
 
 survive there for a long time.
 
But it's also the beginning of a new -- the turning into a new page in the history of the Middle East. There's a -- there's a decision that is mainly 
 
 on the shoulders -- on the shoulders of Prime Minister Netanyahu and leader -- Hamas leader, Yahya Sinwar, whether to turn to that page or choose and 
 
 making the necessary role and compromise or to choose to continue with the war basically endlessly.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes. And as you and I have discussed in the past, the window for a ceasefire and perhaps not turning that page and letting a pause consist 
 
 now of a reprieve for the fighting, if there is a ceasefire and perhaps, you know, renewed concerns about what if anything we could see in the north 
 
 later on, perhaps more a larger combat fight between Israel and Hezbollah. All of this is on the table right now.
 <br>[12:40:10]
 
But for the very least, you know, Ronen, this is quite a difference we've seen this past week, last week, six of these hostages came home in body 
 
 bags. Today one came home to be reunited alive with his family.
 
Ronen Bergman, thank you so much for joining us.
 
BERGMAN: Thank you, Bianna.
 
GOLODRYGA: Well, Israel is stressing that its military will continue to degrade Hezbollah's capabilities and, quote, eliminate more of its 
 
 commanders.
 
And after the latest back and forth attacks across the Israel-Lebanon border, Israelis living close to the frontier are on high alert.
 
CNN's Jim Sciutto shows us how they're dealing with the ongoing violence.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SCIUTTO (voice-over): On Kibbutz Dafna, less than two miles from the Lebanese border, students at the Har VaGai School fled just after October 
 
 7th, quickly abandoning their lockers.
 
Those mandatory evacuation orders came almost a year ago now, yet, the threat remains more present than ever.
 
Last month, a rocket burst through the roof of the school's gym.
 
And just this past weekend, the most intense crossfire along the border this year.
 
RAVIT ROSENTAL, HEAD OF HAR VAGAI SCHOOL IN NORTHERN ISRAEL: This is the sign of our school. It's written Har VaGai School, and those three 
 
 buildings are ours.
 
SCIUTTO (voice-over): Now, as a new school year begins, Head of School, Ravit Rosental, has built an entirely new school 20 miles south for more 
 
 than 1,000 displaced students.
 
Instead of a tree lined campus set around the babbling brook, classes will take place this year in once empty warehouses.
 
On September 1st, they hope a new school year will begin here.
 
ROSENTAL: A lot of students are depressed. Teachers are not in a very good situation. And they are waiting to come to school to see each other because 
 
 they want to fill back our community in Har VaGai.
 
SCIUTTO: The school is outside the evacuation zone in the north, but it's still within range of rockets and missiles and drones from Lebanon. So it 
 
 has air raid shelters like this one. In fact, 18 of them surrounding the school, like all these shelters, reinforced walls, reinforced doors like 
 
 this, and close enough to the classrooms, so the students can get here very quickly in the event of incoming fire.
 
SCIUTTO (voice-over): But the shelters cannot shield the students and teachers from the stress of war.
 
ROSENTAL: We're afraid. I cannot say that they're not afraid. But I know that me and my team will do the best to make good for the kids.
 
ZIV ZINGER, HAR VAGAI HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR: A few days ago, I woke up at 8:00 A.M. from the rockets, and they were very close.
 
SCIUTTO (voice-over): Seventeen-year-old Ziv Zinger (ph) is going into his final year of high school.
 
ZINGER (ph): If you kind of cheated how you feel, you feel very connected to the old school. You know, we had grass and we had the river flowing 
 
 through the school, and it doesn't feel like home.
 
SCIUTTO (voice-over): The goal then, in some measure of stability, the same classmates, same teachers, same subjects, even without the same sense of 
 
 safety.
 
Merav Atmor is sending her 12-year-old son.
 
MERAV ATMOR, MOTHER OF HAR VAGAI STUDENT: This routine, it's something that keep them safe in their mentality. But you go to school every day, you see 
 
 your friends, you see your teachers. I think it's very important.
 
SCIUTTO (voice-over): One promising sign of that routine, Matan (ph), just beginning seventh grade, tells us he's more nervous about his classes than 
 
 the rockets.
 
For Ravit, the school is her contribution to a way forward.
 
ROSENTAL: Very angry about a lot of things going on in Israel, but I have a mission now to take care of more than 1,000 students and 130 teachers. So I 
 
 must do the best now.

GOLODRYGA: Well, fans of the iPhone are getting excited. It's not long until Apple is expected to unveil its new model equipped with artificial 
 
 intelligence. That could come at the company's next public event set for September 9th. Under the motto, It's Glowtime.
 
Apple watchers hoping that's when we get to see the iPhone 16 complete with what the company calls Apple Intelligence.
 
CNN's Clare Duffy is following this story for us from New York.
 
So what version of this new iPhone will we see in terms of any introduction into AI?
 
CLARE DUFFY, CNN BUSINESS WRITER: Yes. Bianna, we get a new iPhone every September.
 
But what's expected to be really special about this iPhone 16 is that it's going to be the first iPhone that is purpose-built with artificial 
 
 intelligence in mind incorporating these Apple Intelligence AI features that the company launched earlier this year.
 
We're going to get a better sense of what that's actually going to look like on the iPhone, but we have some idea of what to expect.
 
Apple Intelligence is going to make Siri smarter. It's going to be able to draw on your personal information from your iPhone.
 
So for example, I could ask it to tell me about my day today and it could pull information from my calendar and my email to give me a really concise 
 
 answer. People will also be able to generate personalized emojis, get help writing e-mails.
 
And then we're also expecting in the September event to hear about some other upgrades that consumers won't necessarily see, but that will still be 
 
 really meaningful, like a faster processing chip that will be able to handle all of the data that's needed to run these AI features.
 
And then, of course, we're likely to see new colors, bigger screen sizes, all of the things that people have come to expect from these annual Apple 
 
 events, but really the highlight will be these AI features.
 
GOLODRYGA: And the company has been facing pressure from competitors, specifically in this world in terms of investing in AI.
 
DUFFY: Yes. It's going to be a lot of pressure on Apple, in particular, to convince consumers that these AI features are compelling enough to be -- to 
 
 be willing to upgrade to the latest iPhone.
 
Apple hasn't really given consumers an exciting reason to upgrade over the last few years, and that's caused iPhone sales to really slow down. And so 
 
 Apple is hoping that these features are going to be that next big upgrade cycle.
 
But a lot of these AI features are available elsewhere. You can do a lot of these same things on ChatGPT, on Microsoft devices or Samsung devices.
 
The sell for Apple really is that it will bring all of those features together in one place, right on your iPhone, and potentially make them 
 
 easier to access and more private -- privacy conscious for consumers.
 
So it'll be a big question leading into September. Will consumers be interested enough in these AI features to want to buy the iPhone 16?
 
GOLDORYGA: We'll be watching, September 9th, just around the corner.
 
Clare Duffy, thank you so much. We'll be right back.

GOLODRYGA: Well, fans will once again get to hear 90's super group Oasis perform their biggest hits live.
 
Fifteen years after the breakup, brothers Noem (ph) -- Noel and Liam Gallaghen (ph) say that they -- Gallagher, say that they are putting 
 
 together the band for a reunion tour.
 
The band that once claimed they were bigger than The Beatles will tour the U.K. and Ireland next year. They are expected to announce additional tour 
 
 dates outside of Europe.
 
And today is going to be the day that Max Foster takes a look at the next chapter in Oasis career.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
(MUSIC)
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Fans may have wondered if they'd ever seen Noel and Liam Gallagher play on stage together again.
 
But 15 years after their feud broke up, one of the U.K.'s biggest bands, a reunion for the brothers is definitely maybe on the cards.
 
Oasis will tour the U.K. and Ireland next year. The group announced it on Tuesday and industry insiders expect tickets to sell out within minutes, as 
 
 fans clamor to hear hits like "Supersonic" live.
 
Oasis shot to fame in the 1990s as part of the so-called Britpop era. The band's debut album, Definitely Maybe, released 30 years ago. This week was 
 
 the start of a journey that saw Oasis become one of the biggest bands in British history.
 
(MUSIC)
 
A second record, "What's the Story Morning Glory," was the U.K.'s best- selling album of the decade, featuring anthems like "Wonderwall" and "Don't Look Back in Anger."
 
But the Gallagher brothers became just as famous for their wild lifestyles and public arguments as their music.
 
After years of making the front pages for their bus stops, Noel Gallagher walked out of the group in 2009 in Paris saying, he simply could not go on 
 
 working with Liam a day longer.
 
Two years later, Liam left fans in no doubt, but he felt the same way.
 
LIAM GALLAGHER, OASIS: I mean, him and I don't get on. He's a different person than I am.
 
 And that's just the way it is.
 
He thinks he's the man and I think I'm the man, you know what I mean?
 
FOSTER (voice-over): It seems this taken this long for them to put the feud and their successful solo careers aside and reconcile. And the peace deal 
 
 could be lucrative. And let's say the Gallagher brothers could make millions of dollars when tickets go on sale this Saturday.
 
The band will play 14 dates across Britain and Ireland and they say they plan to play more dates outside Europe later next year.
 
Fans may be speculating how long the truce will last though.
 
Max Foster, CNN, London.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 <br>[12:55:00]
 
GOLODRYGA: Fans may speculate how long the truce can last, but many didn't even think there'd be a truce at all. So I guess never say never.
 
And finally for us, a British woman celebrated her 102nd birthday in an unusual and daring way. Manette Baillie jumped out of a small plane on 
 
 Sunday to skydive over Suffolk, England, becoming the country's oldest skydiver.
 
Baillie is a veteran who served in the Women's Royal Navy service during World War II. Incredible.
 
Her jump raised money for a local veterans' charity. And happy birthday to you. Look at that video.
 
Well, that does it for this hour of ONE WORLD. Incidentally, it is Zain Asher's birthday as well. We're wishing her a happy birthday.
 
I'm Bianna Golodryga. Don't go anywhere. I'll be right back with "Amanpour".
