PAULA NEWTON, CNN HOST:  And a warm welcome to our viewers here in the United States and all around the world. I'm Paula Newton. Ahead right here on "CNN Newsroom" an unprecedented visit shrouded in secrecy. U.S. President Joe Biden travels to Kyiv in a dramatic show of support, nearly a year after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. 
 
We are live with Russia's reaction to the visit as President Vladimir Putin is set to deliver a speech of his own on the so-called special military operation. 
 
Plus, in the U.S., over 30 million people, look at that map, are under winter alerts across every western states. The latest from the Weather Center ahead. 
 
So, at this hour in Warsaw, Poland, U.S. President Joe Biden is set to begin a two-day visit following a symbolic and highly secretive trip to Ukraine. Now, in the hours ahead, Mr. Biden will be meeting with the Polish president before speaking at Warsaw's Royal Castle as he marks nearly a year since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
 
And that follows of course a surprise stop in Kyiv Monday, an unprecedented presidential visit to an active war zone with no significant U.S. military presence. Now, if you can hear this. Sounds alarming. It's air raid sirens and they could be heard, as you see there, with Biden and Volodymyr Zelenskyy walking outside of St. Michael's Cathedral.
 
And it was a reminder of the dangers amid the ongoing war that this is a risk White house officials say that the president was intent on taking. Mr. Biden said he wanted to leave no doubt that the unwavering U.S. support for Ukraine and announced $500 million in new assistance for the country. Ukrainian soldiers shared the message of thanks for the U.S. President. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNKNOWN (TEXT):  Mr. President Biden, the honor is yours. This is the most powerful message of support for Ukraine at this moment.
 
UNKNOWN (TEXT):  Thank you, Mr. President Biden! God bless America! Thank you for support and help. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NEWTON:  CNN correspondents are tracking the developments. Kevin Liptak is in Warsaw for us and Clare Sebastian is in London. Kevin, to you first. I mean, unmistakable this kind of a photo-op. Its significance and what it means, and the day ahead for President Biden. Spell it out for us exactly what White House officials are telling you in terms of the task ahead. 
 
KEVIN LIPTAK, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER:  Well, I think what you hear from American officials is just how uncertain the next phase of this war will be. You hear them talk about what they call troubling signs that China may be considering sending lethal aid to Russia. They talk about the uncertainty on the battlefield as Russia prepares for the spring offensive. 
 
And so, I think behind the scenes yesterday when President Biden was in Kyiv meeting with President Zelenskyy, that was what they were really very intently focused on, is what the next steps will be? What Ukraine needs from the United States to help it sustain some momentum on the battlefield.
 
And that is something that President Biden was in fact very focused on, on the flight over to Ukraine yesterday, was trying to determine how he was going to approach Zelenskyy, how he was going to use the very limited time that he had on the ground there to really make some substantive discussions about what comes next.
 
And you would hear him talk about that today as well when he speaks here in Warsaw after meeting with the Polish president. He is here marking the one-year anniversary of the war and certainly he'll want to talk about the resilience of the Ukrainians, sort of the unexpected ability if Ukraine to sustain its fight.
 
But as much as he wants to talk about the last year, I think it is also the next 12 months that are so much in focus right now as President Biden works to bolster western support, reaffirm that this western alliance remains united even as, you know, polls indicate that there could be a softening of support for Ukraine at least in the United States.
 
Certain Republicans talk about limiting the number or the amount of aids dollars that are sent to Ukraine. 
 <br>[03:04:59]
 
President Biden spoke to that a little bit yesterday when he said that Congress was united. And it is true that the Republican leaders in Congress remain a stalwart in their support for Ukraine. But as the next year proceeds, I think it is an open question about how much support can be sustained going forward for Ukraine. 
 
And that is really President Biden's overarching goal in his visit to Europe this week, showing that the United States remains committed and reminding the world, including Americans of why the support is so necessary going ahead. Paula?
 
NEWTON:  A lot to cover there, especially as you said, it is in words and deeds to remind Europe as well about why that unity is so important. Clare, the speech from Biden was unmistakable in that it was very cold war-esque. I will speak for myself. I remember cold war rhetoric. Putin will likely lean into that rhetoric himself later today. What kind of message are we expecting from the Kremlin? 
 
CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, Paula, this is going to play very heavily in Russia. I can tell you that the state T.V. is currently running a countdown clock for the start of his speech, which is less than an hour away. This is a state of the nation speech really designed for domestic audience, and of course will -- also play heavily internationally. 
 
Putin will need to rally support, patriotism of his people for continuing the special military operation and he still most of the time calls it. We expect that he will double down on those goals. This time exactly a year ago, he made a speech, calling Ukraine an alienable part of our own history, culture and spiritual space. Making the point that modern Ukraine was entirely created by Russia. 
 
We don't know whether he will concentrate more on the Donbas region. He's taking goal of taking over that region or repeat those claims that the whole of Ukraine should be part of Russia. But either way, looking at those optics that you saw in Kyiv yesterday, President Biden and President Zelenskyy, that expression of unwavering support, that is not playing to those military goals that Moscow is pursuing. 
 
He was clearly, those tactics that you see on the battlefield, attrition, attacking Ukraine's energy grid, all of that suggests that Russia was trying to outlast western support and has so far failed in doing that. I think that this will also play to the notion that we've seen heavily in Russia that they are at war now not with Ukraine but with the collective west with U.S. and NATO, and that Ukraine is somehow doing the U.S.'  bidding. 
 
I feel like if President Putin does mention this trip, it will be spun in that way. But either way, the anniversary of the special military operation as they call it, if the war matters a lot in Russia these kinds of moments matter and this will be a critical speech for President Putin to try to appeal as I said, to the patriotism of its people and to make it very clear that he intends to continue with this fight. 
 
NEWTON:  Yeah. It's something important that we'll continue to follow. As you guys said, with the split screen, right, within about an hour, Putin speaking. And a few hours from now as well, Biden with a speech of his own. Kevin Liptak for us in Warsaw, Clare Sebastian in London, thanks so much. Now, China's top diplomat meantime is expected also in Moscow today.
 
 Wang-yi could meet with Vladimir Putin and foreign minister Sergey Lavrov in the Russian capital. He has been visiting with European leaders over the past week, selling China as a potential peacemaker in the Ukraine war. 
 
But the U.S. of course got to go and warning Beijing not to provide lethal weapons to the Russian military. CNN's Kristie Lu Stout is following all of this for us right now. And given the strong words from Wang-yi at that security conference in Munich in the last few days, what message do we expect them to send and what would be the agenda at this point? 
 
KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah. You know, this is a meeting that is going to be watched very, very closely. China's top diplomat, Wang-yi, is en route on his way to Moscow according to the Russian news agency TASS. Wang-you is set to arrive Tuesday after (inaudible) local time. And according to the ministry of foreign affairs last week, they gave a bit of a preview about what to expect. 
 
They say that this visit will be an opportunity for both sides, China and Russia, to exchange views on the relationship and also to exchange views on what China described as international hot spot issues which has been interpreted as code for the war in Ukraine. 
 
Now, that was something that Wang-yi did address on Monday while he was visiting Budapest. And he made this appeal that he said that China is willing to work with other countries to achieve a lasting peace in Ukraine. We also heard from the Kremlin spokesman who said that the Kremlin does not rule at a meeting between Wang-yi and Vladimir Putin, he president of Russia.
 
Now, this upcoming visit comes amidst a time of just deepening diplomatic turmoil between China and the United States over the Chinese balloon incident and of course over Russia's war in Ukraine. Last weekend we heard the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, warn Wang-yi of consequences should China provide material support to Russia's ongoing conflict in Ukraine.
 <br>[03:09:56]
 
And China, on Monday, through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs fired back with this pointed message, let's bring it up for you -- according to the MOFA (ph) spokesperson on Monday afternoon, saying, "The U.S. is in no position to tell China what to do. We would never stand for finger-pointing, or even coercion and pressurizing from the U.S. on our relations with Russia," unquote. 
 
Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russia and China have been edging closer on multiple fronts. On the economic front, we know that China has been purchasing Russian energy, the softening, the blow from western sanctions. And on the political front, China has been parroting Kremlin talking points. 
 
It has been also condemning western sanctions, yet refusing to condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine. So, when Wang-yi, again, China's top diplomat due to arrive shortly in Moscow does touchdown, meet with Russian officials, we'll be seeing a demonstration of what's been described as a no limits partnership between Russia and China. Back to you. 
 
NEWTON:  Yeah. A very clear message on an important day there in Moscow. Kristie Lu Stout for us in Hong Kong. Thanks for following this. Appreciate it. 
 
Now, Russia is now apparently the most sanctioned country in the world says the Center for European Policy Analysis. One year into the war and the west has imposed more than 5,000 measures aimed at limiting Moscow's access to money. 
 
Now, on Tuesday though, President Biden reported Russia's economy shrank just 2.5 percent in 2020. If you want to compare that to Ukraine which suffered a 30 percent contraction in its GDP. Now, European countries are discussing now a tenth sanctions package. E.U. trade commissioner points out that a current Russian recession is a telltale sign and sanctions in their opinion are working. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VALDIS DOMBROVSKIS, EUROPEAN UNION TRADE COMMISSIONER:  The fact that last year despite record high energy prices, Russia's economy was in recession and is expected by most forecasts to be in recession also this year. That's a direct consequence of the sanctions because energy exports is Russia's main revenue source. So, normally when energy prices are high, Russia's economy is doing well. And this was not the case this time. This is a direct consequence of the sanctions. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NEWTON:  Okay. Despite of what you just heard there though, and the sanctions, the Russian ruble, you'll see it there, reached a seven- year high last year, rising and falling as more measures have been put into place. 
 
Okay, a powerful storm system moving across the United States, and it's going to affect millions of people. The severe winter weather is heading from the west coast to the mid-west and some states, yeah, you're going to get hammered. 
 
California could suffer power outages today. High winds will hit the Rockies and Minneapolis, Minnesota could see historic snowfall. Meteorologist Britley Ritz is following this storm for us, and it just seems like it's going to have everything. The ice, the snow, and the wind. 
 
BRITLEY RITZ, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  Yeah. Including the threat for severe weather on the southeast side of the states as well, Paula. So, we've got a lot going on here. Over 30 million people from California to the Great Lakes, under some sort of winter weather alert. From winter storm warnings to blizzard warnings now, highlighted in orange, from Montana down into Colorado where winds are going to white out all of these locations. And high wind warnings are in place, too. So, we can expect the
 
 snowfall already coming down through parts of the Cascades and pushing into the northern Rockies. This is round one by the way as it moves in. And there are the high wind warnings we were talking about, whiteout conditions expected. 
 
Blizzard warnings mean 35 mile per hour winds over certain amount of time, several hours, where we have visibility less than a quarter of a mile, and these warnings are likely to get extended across the northern plains and the upper mid-west within the next 24 hours as that low continues eastward. 
 
Heavy snowfall, there is round one rolling through Tuesday, Minneapolis could pick up 4 to 6 inches. Round one mind you. Round two comes in Wednesday into Thursday, and that when we can expect some of the heaviest snowfall for Minneapolis and the upper mid-west, nearing two feet of snow by the time it's all said and done over the next three days. 
 
You'll see the darker pinks, there it is, just south of Minneapolis, 18 to 24 inches. Isolated higher mounts area possible. And I'll remind you, that is 3:00 Thursday. Snowfall all the way through the Great Lakes, but where it's just warm enough, we're talking about ice. And these areas highlighted in blue, a half an inch of ice, if not a little bit more where we're starting to see these darker pinks. 
 
That's where we could pick close to an inch of ice. That's devastating where we have widespread power outages and travel, just near impossible. And of course, the warmer end of things dealing with flooding rains from the Ohio Valley back down through parts of the lower Mississippi Valley. Two to four inches of rain expected there through Wednesday. 
 
You'll see areas highlighted in yellow. That (inaudible) connect, suspects some of the heaviest rainfall.
 <br>[03:14:56] 
 
Just north of Columbia and Missouri, all up into Chicago, Illinois where we could pick up some of the heavier rains, so ponding all the roadways, isolated areas, we could have roadways covered in water. So, it's just not a good situation overall with this entire area of low pressure, Paula. 
 
NEWTON:  Yeah. Well, the storm really does have it all. Britley, thanks for following it. Appreciate it. 
 
Now, this week, people are traveling to the tiny hometown of former U.S. President Jimmy Carter where he is receiving hospice or end of life care to pay their respects. Carter, a former peanut farmer put Plains, Georgia on the map and the town is now putting a brave face as it once again receives attention from all over the world. CNN's Eva McKend is there. 
 
EVA MCKEND, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  A mix of sadness and pride falls over the town of Plains, Georgia as the residents here on this small community of about 500 residents digest the news that former President Carter is receiving end of life care. We spent the day at Benita's Soul Food Restaurant (ph) having grits and eggs, speaking with the owner there, Ms. Benita. 
 
And she recalled when she took her own kids just a few years ago to hear the former president at Sunday service, that's because up until recently, he was still conducting Sunday lessons at church. We also met a painter and a mail carrier in this community feverishly painting a large peanut sculpture at the edge of town. This was a sculpture that was part of President Carter's 1976 presidential campaign. 
 
It has worn in recent years and he said that when he heard the news of former President Carter being in hospice care, that he felt a certain sense of urgency to really make sure that that sculpture was represented well as now the eyes of the nation falls on Plaines. Take a listen to what Michael Dominic had to say. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MICAHEL DOMINICK, PAINTER:  He doesn't want any recognition for any of that. And I did the same thing in my life. I just do stuff because its need done, just like painting the peanut, but you know, you don't have to -- he didn't want to make a big news statement about everything that he did, you know. He was just a simple man. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MCKEND:  The former president, well known for his life of service, for his service with Habitat for Humanity, in particular, but you can hear from Mr. Dominick, he indicated that sometimes the former president engaged in the service without telegraphing it, without broadcasting it. Something else he shared with us. He says -- said that this community was full of believers. People who are steeped in their fate. And they are clearly are relying on their fate during this difficult time. In Plains, Georgia, Eva McKend, CNN. 
 
NEWTON:  Just ahead for us, two weeks after being hit by a devastating earthquake, Turkey and Syria are reeling from another one. We'll have the latest on a live report from Turkey. 
 
And there has been major development in the murder investigation of a Los Angeles Catholic bishop. We'll have those details as well.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[03:20:00]
 
NEWTON:  At least 40 people are dead after heavy rain and landslides hit Brazil's Sao Paulo state during carnival festivities. Hundreds have been left homeless. 180 days state of calamity has been declared in six cities now. Brazil's president got a view of the area from a helicopter Monday. It's feared many tourists could be trapped in flooded areas. Now, more than 130 rescue teams are currently looking for survivors. 
 
United Nations says it is ready to provide more support to Turkey and Syria after another powerful earthquake struck the region. The magnitude 6.3 aftershock on Monday happened two weeks after a devastating earthquake killed tens of thousands of people in both countries. In the latest disaster, at least three people were killed and almost 300 were reported injured and that was according to Turkey's health minister. 
 
For more on this story, I'm now joined by CNN's Nada Bashir who is in southern Turkey. And it's so alarming to hear about this, especially given the fact that it was really traumatic for people as soon as the earth started shaking. Nada, I know that you were also in the middle of this. 
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER:  Yes, it is extremely traumatic for everyone in southeast Turkey who's already been through so much since the last earthquake two weeks ago. And you can imagine the fear, the emotional trauma of having to relive that for so many who have already lost so much in the devastation. In southeast Turkey, it's difficult to grasp for the people, here and they have already lost not only their homes but many of them have also lost loved ones.
 
And so, you can imagine the fear yesterday at around 8:00 p.m. local time, noon, eastern time when that very strong after shock struck. And we felt it here in Adana. We're still about 120 miles away from the reported epicenter in Defne in Hatay province, which was one of the hardest hit provinces by the earthquake two weeks ago. 
 
We've already seen people attempting to flee that area fearing another strong aftershock. Here in our hotel in Adana, we felt the tremor, we've seen families now sleeping in this hotel fearing that there could be another shocked, that they would be unsafe in the rooms and hoping to stay close to an exit. And you can imagine the children here as well and of course southeast Turkey are extremely afraid.
 
And the fact that our colleague, Jomana Karadsheh was down towards the epicenter just last night speaking to those impacted. We've already seen buildings now collapsed, many of them were buildings that were damaged in the last earthquake, and have now been further damaged in the collapse in the aftermath of the latest aftershock. She spoke to one local resident who described their fear. Take a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNKNOWN (through translation):  We were terrified of the quake. We were sitting, then electricity went off. Then communications went off. Then, immediately, we ran outside. The incident had happened. 
 <br>[03:25:00]
 
We were afraid, sitting in our cars, sitting also in a tent. It was told that there was nothing left, come back to your houses. We went back to our house and the shock happened again and we went out. May god help us. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BASHIR:  And look, Paula, the authorities here are still trying to assess the extent of that damage. Search and rescue teams have been working, overnight. Aid groups are still very much present on the ground to provide support. The authorities here say they have sent already 6,000 tents to support those impacted or who have fled their homes in the nearby areas. 
 
They are expecting more tents to come in. Field hospitals are still working around the clock. But as we mentioned, there has been some injuries in the aftermath of this latest aftershock. At least 294 people injured so far, 18 of them reportedly seriously injured and now we are learning from the disaster and emergency agency that that death toll has now gone up. A further three people reported dead bringing the latest death toll in direct relation to this latest after shock to six. Paula? 
 
NEWTON:  Yes. Just unimaginable, what everyone there has already gone through and the fact that, you know, they live in terror every hour, wondering if it would happen again. Nada, really great for (inaudible) there. Thank you so much. Appreciate it. 
 
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the murder of Los Angeles auxiliary bishop David O'Connell. The suspect was identified as 65-year-old Carlos Medina. He was apprehended at his home in Torrance, California on Monday and that police also said Medina is the husband of the late bishop's housekeeper and in fact had done work on the bishop's house himself.
 
Police are still looking into what could have been a motive for this crime. According to the Los Angeles Archdiocese, O'Connell was a native of County Cork, Ireland. He was ordained as a priest in Los Angeles in 1979. He later worked to try and restore trust between residents of south Los Angeles and law enforcement after the 1992 L.A. riots.
 
Now on Sunday, parishioners held a vigil for the Bishop O'Connell in Hacienda Heights. This is how one of them described the late bishop. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
RON SANCEDA, PARISHIONER:  I'm stunned. I'm still stunned. This one is a good guy. I mean, you just -- he brought life when he came. He, you know, in and he was a good guy, and he was always talking about -- how he joked, he was a joking guy and he was a pleasure to listen to. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NEWTON:  The archbishop of Los Angeles described O'Connell as a peacemaker who had a heart for the poor and immigrants.
 
New Mexico prosecutors have now downgraded the manslaughter charges facing actor Alec Baldwin after a fatal shooting on his movie set. Now, he no longer faces so-called fire arm enhancement charges, which would've carried a five-year prison sentence if convicted. The same charge has been dropped against the film's armorer, Hannah Gutierrez- Reed. She and Baldwin are accused of involuntary manslaughter, but both claim that they are innocent. More on President Biden's surprise visit to an active war zone. Will
 
 his trip to Ukraine make a difference as Russia's invasion approaches the one-year mark? Details on that right here ahead on "CNN Newsroom."
 <br>[03:30:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
NEWTON:  And welcome back to our viewers here in the United States and all around the world. I'm Paula Newton. You are watching "CNN Newsroom."
 
 President Joe Biden is in Poland this morning, following his unprecedented visit to Kyiv just days ahead of the one year anniversary of the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Mr. Biden made a surprise trip to the capital where he met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
 
The U.S. leader's appearance in the active war drone provided a symbolic boost to Kyiv and he ramped up pressure on Vladimir Putin as the Russian president, himself, prepares to, in a national address justifying the invasion of Ukraine.
 
Joining me now is Julie Norman. She is co-director of the Centre on U.S. Politics at the University College London. And I thank you for joining us. I mean, this really is likely to be one of the most significant and symbolic foreign policies moves of Biden's presidency so far. I mean, the security, the covert choreography alone, it was really worthy of a screenplay. But what purpose do you think this visit can serve going forward?
 
JULIE NORMAN, CO-DIRECTOR, CENTRE ON U.S. POLITICS, UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON:  Well, probably it served a couple of very key aims. And the first and foremost was, of course, just showing solidarity with Ukraine at this moment, you know, with Zelenskyy, with soldiers on the front, especially in advance of what we expect to be a Russian offensive this spring, so very important that he was there on the ground doing that.
 
But just as importantly, really a statement of defiance to Putin, again, on the eve of the anniversary of the war right before Putin himself is going to speak. Biden is there on the ground saying, look, he still stands, Ukraine still stands, democracy still stands. And saying that message importantly is from a bunker or undisclosed location, but from the streets of Kyiv from major landmarks. And so, I think that was an important kind of pushback to which we can expect from Putin this week.
 
And finally, it was just an important sign from Biden, I think, to Americans and to European allies that Biden individually as well as the U.S. more broadly, is still very much supportive of Ukraine in this war and it's still very important in leading on it.
 
And again, this is at a moment when Putin is trying to chip away at NATO is resolved when some of the U.S. are trying to push back at some of the commitments here. So, for Biden to do this at this moment, especially considering how risky it was, really was quite notable. 
 
NEWTON:  Yeah. And as we said, we are waiting, in the next hour, for Vladimir Putin to make a speech of his own. Now, you argued that the visit was consequential and that you also say that Biden's approach is still measured in your opinion, cautious even. Do you expect that to continue?
 
NORMAN:  Well, I think the Biden administration, from the beginning, has been trying to find a somewhat difficult balance here. Obviously, visits like this are extremely important in a symbolic sense. They do a lot to galvanize morale and to keep the momentum going. But in real terms, you know, we expected that there will likely be a conversation between Biden and Zelenskyy sending a F16 fighter. That's something that the U.S. has not committed to so far. They were cautious throughout the fall in terms of committing to certain kinds of arms and weapons that have now been sent.
 <br>[03:34:58]
 
The Biden administration has been trying to be cautious in not escalating things too quickly, not going too far to provoke Putin unnecessarily in certain ways. And also, I think, trying to figure out what is going to be the endgame here. Yes, committed to being with Ukraine as long as it takes but also trying to think pragmatically, what is that going to look like and what steps do we need to move it to that point?
 
NEWTON:  Yeah. And you know, as this conflict weren't enough, we were also pointing out that China's top diplomat is likely going on to the ground in Moscow in the next few hours, meeting probably with Sergey Lavrov, the foreign minister, at least but possibly with Vladimir Putin. How will the U.S. and its allies pivot if indeed China dips its toe into this conflict and backs Russian materially with lethal aid? 
 
NORNAN:  Yeah. Paula, it's such an important question because really for the last year since the war started, one of the wildcards has been China, how would they play this? Will they back Putin strongly or would they take more of a middle road?
 
And what we've seen up until now is indeed they have maintained economic ties with Russia, diplomatic political, but they have not directly sent military aid up to this point. What we heard Secretary of State Blinken say over the weekend is that the U.S. intelligence does expect that that might be a possibility. I do think if China starts sending military aid directly to Russia that will be a major factor in this war, and it will also severely threaten ties between the U.S. and China because that has been a sort of red line up to now that China has not crossed but really would take things to a different level. 
 
NEWTON:  I don't have a lot of time. But quickly, in terms of the U.S. support of this, we have polls indicating that while Democrats are behind Joe Biden, in the majority, Republicans and Independents, are to but not to the extent that democrats are. Do you think that could be a bit of an Achilles heel here for President Biden? NORMAN:  It will a little bit, but as you noted, Independents are
 
 mostly still with this, about half of Republicans are. And, importantly, within Congress, they're still a majority to get the aid packages through, to get the real terms support through, and I think that's what Biden is focusing on right now.
 
NEWTON:  Julie, I can't thank you enough for taking us through that in a very detailed way, especially as we await speeches from both President Biden and President Putin. I appreciated it, Julie. 
 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says that there are no water or air quality concerns in East Palestine, Ohio. Now, that's two weeks after a train carrying hazardous material derailed there. The agency says that it screened more than 500 homes for indoor air quality, and have not detected any dangerous levels of contaminants.
 
However, residents are reporting a growing number of elements from rashes to nausea and trouble breathing. Today, the state will open a health clinic to provide with -- to provide them -- those residents with some care and assistance.
 
Elsewhere in Ohio, at least 13 people were taken to local hospitals after an explosion at a metal factory that sparked a huge fire. According to one medical center, two victims are in critical conditions. Witnesses say that the blast shook nearby buildings, scattered debris and damaged vehicles. Officials say the bulk of the fire is now contained. The crews are working on putting out certain hotspots. The cause of the explosion is still unknown.
 
Okay. A push to revamp Israel's judicial system passes its first hurdle by the skin of its teeth, we should say, as huge crowds protest outside parliament. The next step and why these reforms are so pretentious. Plus, the U.N. is calling for action as North Korea launches three missiles in the past few days. We'll have details, next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[03:40:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
NEWTON:  So, a controversial set of bills meant to weaken the independence of Israel's judicial system has now advanced past its first hurdle in parliament, primarily along party lines. The reform would allow the Knesset to overturn the Supreme Court rulings with a simple majority. And, in fact, change the way judges are pointed.
 
Now, the prime minister, who's facing corruption charges, is all for that and so are his allies. After the preliminary vote went, Benjamin Netanyahu's way, he tweeted that it was a great day and a great night. The bills must pass two more readings to become law. Lawmakers are bitterly divided over all of this, some with flags inside the chamber, you see in there, and were escorted out by security.
 
Outside of the Knesset, meantime, there was a sea of Israeli flags as roughly 75,000 people showed up to protests.
 
CNN's Hadas Gold was there.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  This is the main road that leads not only in front of the Israeli Supreme Court but also and in front of the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, and that's where the thousands of protesters are heading. For these protesters, today, here, they believe that these judicial reforms would threaten the independents of the Israeli judiciary. Some of them believe that it's only to help Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, in his ongoing corruption trial, something he denies.
 
The protesters here are chanting things like democracy. They're chanting things like Israel it will not become a dictatorship. For many of them here, they have this visceral belief that these reforms are really threatening the Israeli way of life and the Israeli democracy.
 
But, for the counter-protesters, and there are counter-protesters here, they support these reforms. They believe that they are very much needed. They believed that it is a long time coming, and that this is what the Israeli voters voted for those November elections when Benjamin Netanyahu and his allies won a 64-seat majority in the Israeli parliament.
 
But, Benjamin Netanyahu is facing external pressures, including from the American ambassador to Israel, who in a recent podcast in recent days called on the Israeli government to pump the brakes, he said. He said to slow down the legislative process and allow time for consensus, allow time for negotiations.

NEWTON:  The U.N. is also warning that missile launches by North Korea posed a serious risk to the international aviation and maritime traffic. Now, during the meeting with the Security Council, Monday, a top U.N. official called for immediate steps to resume dialogues. Listen.

MOHAMED KHALED KHIARI, U.N. ASSISTANT SECRETARY GENERAL:  We welcomed the Security Council commitment to a peaceful comprehensive diplomatic and political solution for the situation on the Korean Peninsula as well as the importance that council has placed on working to reduce tensions. Diplomacy, not isolation is the only way for it to work.

NEWTON:  Now, that meeting comes after North Korea launched three ballistic missiles over the past three days, claiming that it has not developed missiles capable of surviving re-entery. CNN's Will Ripley has more on the story.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
WILL RIPLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The massive missile was a menacing site, moving into place at the Pyongyang's airport. North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, gave the order just hours ahead of Saturday's surprise launch state media says. This intercontinental ballistic missile, Hwasong-15, hitting hypersonic speeds, hurdling high above the Earth, barreling back down to Japan's territorial waters about 67 minutes later.
 
Saturday's missile, one of many on display just last week, a record number of ICBMs, more than any military parade in North Korean history. Kim ordered mass production of ICBMs earlier this year, featuring new missiles and a new face, Kim Ju-ae, Kim's daughter, believed to be just 9 years old. She began appearing on state media three months ago, fueling speculation she is being groomed as the next North Korean leader.
 
(on-camera):  So, given the fact that Kim Jong-un chose to introduce his daughter on the day have his previous ICBM launch, what do you make of the timing and symbolism of that?
 
CHAD O'CARROLL, FOUNDER, KOREA RISK GROUP:  I think that it demonstrates that she's being groomed as the next leader. And that, to me, suggest that there could be something behind the scenes, maybe a health problem with Kim Jong-un that is accelerating, I need to do this now rather than years later when she's a bit older. 
 
RIPLEY (voice-over):  Kim's daughter, now a fixture on state media, sitting with their father at a weekend soccer match, posing together for a postage stamp, dad, daughter and the family arsenal. 
 
Two smaller missiles fired Monday, a test of tactical nuclear weapons, state TV says. The bellicose broadcast came to the warning from Kim's younger sister, Kim Yo-jong, saying the frequency of using the Pacific Ocean as our shooting range depends on the nature of the U.S. military's action. She's referring to upcoming military drills on the Korean Peninsula. The U.S., South Korea, and Japan responding to the ICBM launch with joint air exercises over the weekend, fueling fears of further escalation.
 
PARK JIN, SOUTH KOREAN FOREIGN MINISTER:  If North Korea conducts the seventh nuclear test, which could happen at any time, it would be a game-changer in a sense that North Korea could develop and deploy tactical nuclear missiles.
 
RIPLEY (voice-over):  And growing arsenal, some say, has one purpose, preserving the power of the ruling Kim family for generations to come.

NEWTON:  So, a long lost letter from George Washington was expected to sell for some $50,000 at auction. Ironically, the correspondent touches on financial troubles Washington was having at the time, written months before he would travel to Philadelphia for the constitutional convention and two years before he would become president. Washington talked with the retired colonel about his need to sell some of his land, holdings in order to raise money. Bit of a history lesson for all of us there.
 
Now, the the one year anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine is just days away. But photojournalist, Anastasia Taylor Lind, has been documenting the situation in Ukraine since 2014. The photos have gone on display at the Imperial War Museum in London.
 
Our Isa Soares spoke with Taylor Lind about some of the absolutely incredible and heartbreaking images she has captured in Ukraine.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ISA SOARES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  Let's start off with really the image that is just over your right shoulder. And that is the Maidan Revolution. That moment, was that, do you think, a turning point?
 
ANASTASIA TAYLOR LIND, PHOTOJOURNALIST:  It was absolutely a turning point. It was -- it was the moment when ordinary civilians deposed a president who had very close ties to Russia and demonstrated that they wanted to move forward with closer ties to Europe. It's ironic, of course, that I believed I was documenting the end of violence in the country. And now, we know it was only the beginning.
 
SOARES (on camera):  And we saw at that very moment what we have been seeing over the past year, the fight, the resilience of Ukrainians.
 
TAYLOR LIND:  Well, of course, they're faced with no choice, aren't they? But to be resilient and but the fight. No one chose this -- no one in Ukraine chose this war. And I am particularly concerned in my work and personally about the civilian experience of war. Everybody is affected guide in some way.
 
SOARES (voice-over):  Much of your work focuses on that lived experience of the traumas around this war. You focused in particular on one family, one that lived in the rural part of Ukraine.
 
TAYLOR LIND:  This is Arlia (ph) and her husband Nikolai and little Kyria (ph) and Medaslava (ph). They lived on the front line already.
 
SOARES:  Yeah.
 
TAYLOR LIND:  So, fighting came to their neighborhood very fast. And since both of their kids were born after 2014, and neither of them had ever seen peace.
 
SOARES:  I mean, looking at this picture, you would never imagine it was in the middle of a war, so beautiful. 
 
TAYLOR LIND:  Pictures like this one seem more precious and more important and more poignant than they ever did before because everything that you can see here is gone.
 
SOARES:  You've got to photos, focusing on one soldier in particular. 
 
TAYLOR LIND: Yevgan (ph) is an I.T. Consultant. I photographed him in 2014 after he had been beaten very badly by the bad cops (ph), riot police. In this photograph, he has a concussion. You can see his two black eyes as well.
 
SOARES:  Yeah.
 
TAYLOR LIND:  And his hand was broken. He was also arrested and he was detained for several days. So, he'd just gotten out when I made this picture.
 <br>[03:55:03]
 
SOARES:  And then, here is again. This is last year, March of 2022.
 
TAYLOR LIND:  So, unsurprisingly, Yevgan (ph) volunteered the day -- the day after the full scale Russian invasion along with a lot of men who fought in in (inaudible). And, now, he's a member of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and we know that the Ukrainian Army became a very professional and very well equipped and well trained in that time because they had to. 
 
SOARES:  What do you admire about Ukrainian spirit? What is so special about it? 
 
TAYLOR LIND: Can I give you a specific example? 
 
SOARES:  Absolutely.
 
TAYLOR LIND:  From my friend, Julia Kochitova (ph), who is a Ukrainian -- a young Ukrainian photojournalists in Filmika (ph), we were working together and donbas this summer, and we had been very close to the front line when there was a lot of very active shelling, And it was terrifying. It was terrifying to work there, and we had made plans to go back the next day and to stay overnight with the family that we have been following.
 
And when I woke up in the morning, I was so filled with fear. I went with Julia, and I said, Julia, I can't. I just can't go today. I am so sorry. I know you would want to go anyway but always here for you. And she said, I understand. This is my war and if I die, that's okay.
