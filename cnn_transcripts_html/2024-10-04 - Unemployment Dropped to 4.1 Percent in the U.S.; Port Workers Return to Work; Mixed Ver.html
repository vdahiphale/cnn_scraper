THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
<br>[10:30:00]
 
JIM ACOSTA, CNN ANCHOR:  Some robust job numbers are out this morning. In September, 254,000 jobs were added and unemployment dropped to 4.1 percent, exceeding expectations.
 
Also, after days of standing on the picket lines and hampering the nation's port system, nearly 50,000 dock workers are returning to work today. A tentative agreement was reached last night. Still, the deal needs to be ratified by those union members. And joining me now is someone who was part of the final stages of the strike negotiations. White House economic adviser, Lael Brainard. Lael, thank you so much for being with us. We appreciate it.
 
I do want to jump right into this strike and how this tentative deal was reached, but there were reports of people across the country hoarding toilet paper, apparently, because they were worried about the impact of this strike. Of course, that had nothing to do with the strike, but can Americans breathe a little easier this morning?
 
LAEL BRAINARD, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL ECONOMIC ADVISER:  Absolutely. I think American consumers can feel really good. Their supply chains actually haven't been affected. Dock workers are back at work, the ports are open. And of course, you know, a lot of retailers had already been preparing in advance. So, this period hasn't been disruptive at all. We haven't seen any direct effects. And now, with the ports back open, don't expect to see any.
 
Of course, there are parts of the country that are affected by the devastation of Hurricane Helene and we're doing everything we can to get recovery up and running in those parts of the country. But of course, those are unrelated, and having the ports back open will only help with that.
 
ACOSTA:  And the president of the International Longshoremen's Association, Harold Daggett. He was not holding back about the union's demands, and this is what he was saying just hours before the deal was reached. Let's listen to this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HAROLD DAGGETT, PRESIDENT OF INTERNATIONAL LONGSHOREMEN'S ASSOCIATION: I'm looking for $5 across the board for six years. And I'm going to fight for it. Because those greedy companies are making billions of dollars, and they don't want to share. We're going to fight for it, and we're going to win it, or this port will never open up again.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
AMANPOUR:  Lael, Daggett has faced some criticism for giving for some of these demands of his companies forking over money but he makes over -- apparently, makes over $900,000 a year as a union leader. Was that brought up during the negotiations?
 
BRAINARD:  You know what, let me just step back and say from day one, the president thought it was very important to get the two parties back together to get the collective bargaining process back on track, to get the ports reopened. He pushed really hard for that, and he got it done.
 
And yes, I think it is important that the companies came forward to make a generous wage commitment. That's important because these workers, for the six previous years, some years, they didn't see any wage gains. Other years they saw only $1. And don't forget these are workers that came out every day during COVID. They risk their lives to keep goods moving for American families and consumers.
 
And the companies did actually do very well following COVID. And this allows the companies to share with the workers, those benefits. And it puts the collective bargaining process back on track. So, I think the president and the vice president, they strongly believe collective bargaining works. And this is an instance where by sticking with that, we've gotten good outcomes for American families.
 
ACOSTA:  And just to get a quick reaction from you, if we can to these latest unemployment numbers, your thoughts on the new numbers that are out this morning, and is there any concern that because the numbers were a little bit better than expected or a lot better than expected, that perhaps it might make the Fed reconsider these continued rate drops that we've been seeing or that we expect to see in the coming months?
 
BRAINARD:  You know, sometimes good news is good news. And I think what we saw this morning, over 250,000 jobs created, unemployment back down to 4.1 percent, real incomes, that means purchasing power actually growing. And of course, we know from last week, inflation's back down to 2.2 percent, that's a good picture for American middle- class families and for American workers. So, here today good news is good news.
 <br>[10:35:00]
 
ACOSTA:  You think we'll still see those interest rates coming down then?
 
BRAINARD:  Well, you know, we are seeing that inflation has come back down and interest rates have been falling. And today, we saw the jobs market continues to expand. And 16 million jobs created since the beginning of this administration. That's a very, very good progress.
 
ACOSTA:  All right. White House National Economic Adviser Lael Brainard, thank you so much for your time. We appreciate it. BRAINARD:  Thank you.
 
ACOSTA:  All right. Still to come, a federal jury has convicted three former Memphis police officers on some of the charges related to the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols. We will break down the verdict next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:40:00]
 
ACOSTA:  Today, three of the former Memphis police officers charged in the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols are awaiting sentencing after being convicted by a federal jury. The three were found guilty of charges of witness tampering and could face up to 20 years in prison, but were acquitted on harsher civil rights charges. Nichols died after being brutally beaten following a 2023 traffic stop. His death drew national outrage and calls for broad policing reform. Following the verdict, his family expressed their relief on the courthouse steps.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
RODNEY WELLS, FATHER OF TYRE NICHOLS:  We're just so very proud that all of them are going to jail today. We cannot wait on the sentencing, so we know what their total time will be. But today, was a very good day for our family.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ACOSTA:  CNN's Shimon Prokupecz joins me now. Shimon, walk us through these verdicts. I mean, I remember covering this when you were covering this. This case just sent shockwaves through Memphis and across the country.
 
SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, just the brutality, that video that we all saw from the beating that Tyre Nichols took. The police moving very quickly in this case. Remember, it was about two weeks, then they fired all of the officers that were involved.
 
But I think this really shows that prosecuting these cases, Jim, are very difficult for federal prosecutors. The top count in this case was a civil rights charge relating to the death of Tyre Nichols, that the officers acting in their capacity as officers violated his civil rights, which then caused his death. This was a federal case. It was before a federal court.
 
They're all still facing state charges, but on the federal case, the top count there, the jury deciding to acquit these officers in just about six hours after deliberating, they had their verdict. The officers, as you said, are facing still that witness tampering charge. They were convicted on that. And now, we wait for their sentencing. They're set to be sentenced in January, but the judge remanded them to jail until Monday to have a bail hearing to determine if he's going to release them until their sentence, Jim.
 
ACOSTA:  All right. Shimon Prokupecz, thank you very much. Very important case. Appreciate the update.
 
Coming up, navigating debris on a kayak. I'll talk to a world-champion kayaker on how he's using his skills to rescue those stranded by Helene. You want to see this video, coming up.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:45:00]
 
ACOSTA:  All right. We want to show you some new before-and-after pictures of Western North Carolina that are painting Helene's destruction. This is Chimney Rock on the left. You can see some sort of amusement park with a couple of rides. On the right is what is left. What used to be a road is now water, washing away most of everything in its path. The same community left unrecognizable in these before-and-after images. Just unbelievable. It gives a glimpse of the challenges survivors and rescuers still face as many roads are impassable or just plain gone.
 
The video you're seeing here, take a look at this, was shot by kayaker Mason Hargrove. He is paddling into isolated areas on debris filled rivers, trying to find anyone who may be still out there.

MASON HARGROVE, ASSISTING IN HELENE RESCUE EFFORTS AND PROFESSIONAL KAYAKER:  Hello? Hello?
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ACOSTA:  And Mason Hargrove joins us now. Mason, thank you so much for what you're doing. I mean, it's very brave of you to go out there. I feel like it might be a little dangerous to be in this water with all that debris in there. What has this experience been like? And have you found some folks along the way?
 
HARGROVE:  Yes, definitely. So, the day after the storm we kind of waited around and see, make sure the road were clear before we dropped in, but we hadn't paddled the Green River Narrows down into this community that had not been touched yet because there was no way to get in there other than the river or via helicopter. And there was none in the sky yet.
 
So, me and my friend, Dan Jackson, loaded up our kayaks to be around 150 pounds and navigated down Class 5 Rapids, walking a lot as well, because the main goal was to get down there, bring them, like, amazing supplies, and just make sure they were OK. And then, along the way, we had a few videos just to show everyone how devastating all of this actually is.
 
ACOSTA:  Yes, and we're showing, Mason, some of your video that you captured as we speak, and you're just seeing roads washed out, you're seeing houses toppled over on their side. I mean it just speaks to the awesome power, the destructive power of this water as it was rushing down these mountains. HARGROVE:  Yes, water is the strongest force in nature, as we can see. And so, just seeing how it's taking away all of these communities is really saddening, but it's also pretty cool to see that I'm using my kayaking abilities to get to places that other people can't and also doing other search and rescue efforts trying to find survivors and helping other search and rescues connect the dots between the towns.
 
ACOSTA:  And when you're running into folks, what are they saying? What's that experience been like?
 <br>[10:50:00]
 
HARGROVE:  You're getting a lot of different kind of personalities between different people. Some people are telling you stories about when landslides hit their house or how they narrowly escaped their house being flooded, and others kind of just not knowing what to do. So, just trying to help them find the next steps and wanting -- where they need to go, getting them immediate supplies or medical assistance that they need and helping them find a way to continue with life.
 
ACOSTA:  Yes. And, Mason, I have to think that these rivers are just -- these waterways that you're navigating are pretty -- I mean, they're pretty hazardous, I have to think. It looks like the trees are just all over the place in the water. What was that like getting around all of that?
 
HARGROVE:  Yes. So, a lot of it is kind of scrambling up and down the riverbanks, jumping over logs, and also checking the logs for people and other things, and some stuff that might be of use to some people that they lost and you want to return back to them.
 
And so, as professional kayakers, we really can assess the risk and assess what is feasible and what's not feasible, depending on the mission that we're on for that day and what's the goal and where are we trying to get to help people. Because at the end of the day, we're going to do as much as we can to help these people out, but also keep ourselves safe so we don't add to the problem.
 
ACOSTA:  Yes. No question. And my producers tell me that you have been doing a lot of hiking as well as the kayaking. And you have a story -- pretty interesting story that goes along with that. What was that like?
 
HARGROVE:  Yes. So, after Sunday, we found a trail that led into the Green River Cove. And so, we were actually hiked in over 200 of produce, gasoline and propane down a super steep mountain and kind of just an old back road. Jumping over logs, sliding down the mud just to bring these people what they needed so they can start clearing an access road to get out of there and also just keep surviving. And that was a really hard task in itself.
 
ACOSTA:  And, Mason, why did you decide to do this?
 
HARGROVE:  Because I love people and want to help people. And it hurts me to see people hurting. And so, I want to do as much as I can just to give back to the community that has given so much to me. Western North Carolina has a really special place in my heart, even though I'm not from here. This is my second home and it's what I was called to do.
 
ACOSTA:  Well, Mason, you did an amazing job. Keep doing what you can. I'm sure everything that you're doing is helping a great deal. Thank you so much for your time. We really applaud your efforts here. Thank you for doing that.
 
HARGROVE:  Thank you so much. And if you guys want to keep following along, follow me @masonkayaks on Instagram. I'm going to keep posting updates and keep posting missions that we're going to need help with.
 
ACOSTA:  We will certainly do that. And you're absolutely right, it's such a great part of the country. I can totally understand why you love it so much. I've been there a lot and it's just an amazing place. I hope they can get back on their feet soon. Thanks, Mason. Good talking to you.
 
HARGROVE:  You as well.
 
ACOSTA:  All right. And people who live across Helene's 500-mile path of destruction, as Mason was saying, they still need basic necessities. For ways you can help, go to cnn.com/impact. And we'll be right back.

 <br>[10:55:00]
 
ACOSTA:  The Mets are advancing in the postseason in dramatic fashion with a ninth-inning home run. CNN's Carolyn Manno joins me now. Carolyn, I mean, what a season for the Mets. And Pete Alonso, what a night.
 
CAROLYN MANNO, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, especially when you consider, Jim, that he's going to be a free agent. I mean, what an incredible performance in a moment that Mets fans are going to remember forever has now been solidified and maybe changed the narrative around him not being clutch, because this certainly was.
 
New York down, two-nothing in the top of the ninth, two runners on for Alonso, hadn't hit a home run since September 19th, but that slump ending emphatically with the three-one shot off of all-star closer Devin Williams to boot to right. The man known as the Polar Bear giving the Mets lead, stunning the home crowd in the process. New York would tack on an insurance run too to win 4 to 2 and advance to the National League Division Series.
 
The Mets popping bottles, I know, in the clubhouse. Afterwards, as you might expect, they won't have long to savor this though. Next up, a clash with their National League East rival, the Philadelphia Phillies. That starts tomorrow. The Falcons hosting the Buccaneers on Thursday night.
 
Football and a quarterback, Kirk Cousins, stepping up when it matters most in prime time. Down three with a minute 14 left, Jim, in the fourth. No timeouts. Leads his team downfield. Set up (INAUDIBLE) for a 52-yard field goal as time expires, and they would be able to force overtime. But this extra period didn't last long. Cousins hitting KhaDarel Hodge here on the first drive. He broke through, scampered 45 yards for the walk-off touchdown. So, Kurt Cousins's breaking the franchise record, 509 passing yards in this 36-30 win that delivered on Thursday night.
 
And there's another full slate of games, of course, this weekend. I know you're going to be watching the Commanders hosting the Browns Washington.
 
ACOSTA:  I am.
 
MANNO:  Led by Jayden Daniels, looking for a four in one start to the season for the first time since 2008. Number two overall draft pick. Has completed more than 82 percent of his passes. Favorite so far to win offensive rookie of the year. His jersey, the top seller. I'm sure you might have one in your closet.
 
ACOSTA:  I'm going to be getting one, a couple of them for Christmas, I think. I mean, this guy is off to an amazing start. Football fans in D.C. have --
