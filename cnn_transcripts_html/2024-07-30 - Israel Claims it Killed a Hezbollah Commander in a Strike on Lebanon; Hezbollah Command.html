THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
<br>[18:00:00]
 
JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN HOST:  It's 1:00 a.m. in Beirut, 6:00 a.m. in Beijing, and 6:00 p.m. here in New York. I'm Julia Chatterley. And wherever 
 
 you are in the world, this is your "First Move."
 
And a warm welcome to "First Move" as always. And here's today's need to know. Beirut blast. Israel claims it killed a Hezbollah commander in a 
 
 rocket strike on Lebanon's capital.
 
Power play. Opposition leaders calling for peaceful protests as hundreds are arrested in Venezuela following Nicolas Maduro's disputed election 
 
 victory.
 
Golden Girls, Team USA winning gold as Simone Biles becomes the most decorated American gymnast of all time.
 
And a mochi moment, the Japanese American founder finding sweet success with a very traditional recipe. That conversation and plenty more coming 
 
 up.
 
But first, conflicting reports over the fate of a Hezbollah official targeted by Israel Tuesday in Lebanon. Israel saying within the past hour 
 
 that the senior Hezbollah commander was killed in a "targeted strike" in a suburb of Beirut. Yet a senior Lebanese government official says he 
 
 survived the attack. Israel calling the commander the right-hand man of Hezbollah chief, Hassan Nasrallah, and was responsible for ordering the 
 
 weekend attack in the Golan Heights that killed 12 children. The region now waiting Hezbollah's response, an IDF official insisting that Israel is not 
 
 looking for a wider war.
 
Joining us now, Ben Wedeman in Beirut, and Jeremy Diamond is in Haifa, Israel. Jeremy, I'll come to you first. This is the targeted response that 
 
 I think everyone was waiting for from Israel at this stage. They're saying it's a success, but clearly, we're hearing conflicting reports. What more 
 
 do you know at this hour?
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, for several days now, since this rocket attack killed 12 children in the Israeli occupied Golan Heights, 
 
 Israeli government officials, military officials have made clear that there would be a severe price to pay for the deaths of those children for this 
 
 rocket attack, which Israel said Hezbollah was responsible for.
 
And tonight, we learned what that response would look like with this Israeli strike in Southern Beirut, the capital city of Lebanon, where the 
 
 Israeli military says that it was targeting Fuad Shukr, a senior Hezbollah commander.
 
In just the last hour, the Israeli military's top spokesman, Admiral Daniel Hagari, confirming that the Israeli military has indeed successfully killed 
 
 Fuad Shukr in this strike, and they're really talking up the impact of this. They note the fact that he was a senior adviser to Hassan Nasrallah, 
 
 the head of Hezbollah. They also call him the most senior Hezbollah military commander, and they note his involvement in prior attacks against 
 
 Israel, his involvement in directing Hezbollah military activity since October 8th, when Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel in what they 
 
 say was in solidarity with the people of Gaza, and the war there following Hamas' attack on Israel on October 7th.
 
We don't know yet to what extent Hezbollah will respond. They have also yet to confirm the death of Fuad Shukr, but there's no question that this is a 
 
 region very much on edge at this moment, waiting to see what could potentially happen and whether or not, as has been feared for months now, 
 
 this is a region that will tilt now into all-out war.
 
A senior Israeli official who I spoke with this evening telling me that this was a serious blow that they believe that they dealt to Hezbollah. But 
 
 at the same time in the same breath, indicating that they do not want to see all-out war, but they make clear they understand that that is now in 
 
 the hands of Hezbollah. Julia.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes. And, Ben, come in here as well, because as we mentioned there, the IDF is saying, look, they're not looking for a wider war at this 
 
 moment, but this was, in their mind, at least, a response to the events of the weekend. The question now, I think, is everyone watching Hezbollah to 
 
 see if they then respond to the response.
 
BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, surprisingly, Hezbollah has been very quiet since that attack took place just before 8:00 
 
 in the evening local time. They have not put out anything on their Telegram channel. I've been in touch with a senior adviser to -- media adviser to 
 
 Hezbollah. He told me about two hours ago he was going to get back to me with a response to my questions regarding Fuad Shukr and whether he's dead 
 
 or not. I have yet to hear back from him.
 <br>[18:05:00]
 
There's been -- we've been waiting for some sort of statement from Hezbollah. We haven't seen that yet. Now, earlier I spoke with a senior 
 
 Lebanese government official who told me that Shukr had survived the blast of the attack. But -- so, we're sort of waiting to find out more.
 
As far as the response, Hezbollah has reported 11 attacks on Israeli positions today, but none since the strike on Beirut. In the past, we've 
 
 heard Hassan Nasrallah, the secretary general of Hezbollah, saying that striking Beirut is a red line and that Israel -- that Hezbollah will 
 
 respond in kind if Israel hits Beirut.
 
Now, on the 2nd of January of this year the Israelis did strike the southern suburbs of Beirut killing a senior Hamas official in that 
 
 instance, and that did not lead to sort of a massive Hezbollah response. So, we shall see.
 
Hezbollah has made it clear that it does not want a full-scale war with Israel since the 8th of October when it started opening fire on Israel, it 
 
 said it was doing so in solidarity with the people of Gaza. But it is -- always stayed within largely what's known as the rules of engagement, 
 
 whereby they will focus mostly on civilian -- rather military targets along the border and not strike well inside and to avoid civilian casualties.
 
Of course, that strike on the Israeli occupied Syrian Golan Heights on Saturday that left 12 children dead, Israel has blamed on Hezbollah. 
 
 Hezbollah has denied that they were behind the strike. Regardless of that, it is anticipated in some form or another Hezbollah will respond. The 
 
 question is, how big will its response be? And we'll just have to wait and see for that.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes. Critical question. Ben Wedeman there. Thank you. And Jeremy Diamond, of course too. Thank you to you both.
 
Now, to Venezuela, where thousands are protesting for the second day following Sunday's presidential elections. The opposition party, which 
 
 claims it won in a landslide, says one of its leaders was kidnapped from his home. An eyewitness saying armed, hooded individuals forced two people 
 
 into a van.
 
Incumbent Nicolas Maduro was declared the winner of the election by an electoral body controlled by his allies, triggering allegations of fraud. 
 
 So far, he's been backed by the nation's military. Nearly 750 protestors were arrested during Monday's protest according to the attorney general and 
 
 they could face sentences of up to 20 years in prison as we were discussing on the show yesterday.
 
Stefano Pozzebon joins us once again from Caracas. Stefano, no sign of a let up in the protests from the people there. I think it's always 
 
 interesting to understand though what the military is saying and doing. How involved have they been in some way helping quell the protests that we've 
 
 seen, if at all?
 
STEFANO POZZEBON, JOURNALIST:  Well, Julia, it's great that you're asking me about the military and the security forces because, look, we're coming 
 
 to you live again from the Wall Street of Venezuela. This area is known for its banks and we are -- this is literally, it's what you would call the 
 
 Broadway at the height of Wall Street if you were in New York.
 
And at the bottom, you can probably see down there some semi armored vehicles and tanks and military motorcycled police units that have been 
 
 leading up the repression and the fight against some of the protesters.
 
The streets of Caracas are, of course, clean and quiet now. It's remarkable that at 6:00 p.m. on a working day, on a Tuesday, this is how it looks. 
 
 Caracas, just a few scattered cars, even every now and then. And military forces or semi armored military forces just a couple of hundred meters from 
 
 where I am.
 
Today, there was a widespread opposition march assembly that, just like in other occasions, both this year and in previous years, arrived up until 
 
 here and was met with tear gas and rubber bullets. And I really think that the opposition is claiming and -- the opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez 
 
 told me today that he believes by the data that they've been able to collect that he won that election with 72 percent of the vote and they are 
 
 daring the Maduro government, they are urging the Maduro government to publish all the data that they have, which is something, by the way, Julia, 
 
 that this has been asked about by pretty much everyone in the region. I think the diplomatic game is really important to look at right now.
 <br>[18:10:00]
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes, the International Community also pushing, saying, if this is the truth, show us the data. To your point, I think he said we've got a 
 
 mathematically irreversible victory. That was what the opposition parties are saying. There are reports that President Nicolas Maduro has suggested 
 
 that he would release the data. Do we know if that's true? Where is that coming from?
 
POZZEBON:  Yes, that's information that we were able to verify at CNN directly from the envoy of the Brazilian president, Lula, who met with 
 
 Maduro yesterday. He told us, or his sources close to him told us, that Maduro pledged to release all the data to him. There was a meeting 
 
 yesterday between a personal envoy of Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Celso Amorin. He's a former Brazilian foreign minister. He's widely involved in 
 
 foreign policy here in Latin America. He arrived here in Caracas last week ahead of the election to act as a monitor, to act as an observer.
 
And after the fallout of that election, Brazil has become more and more involved in diplomatic talks in applying diplomatic pressure onto the 
 
 Maduro government to release all the data. It's not just Brazil that has been asking that, it's a Columbia also, Mexico also, pretty much every 
 
 Latin American country, the United States, the European Union. The message has been consistent that if Maduro really wants to get out of this impasse, 
 
 the easiest way to do it and the safest and the most peaceful way to do it and the democratic way to do it actually is to release all the data.
 
The Brazilians have been telling us that they have been able to speak with Maduro directly and that he responded to the request positively, pledging 
 
 that he will release the data. Now, whether he will do it or when he will do it, if he ends up doing it, it's everyone's guess because right now, 
 
 Maduro is still staying put, saying that he won that election that is so controversial, for lack of a better word. And that -- that's the data that 
 
 they've got.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes. And the question is, do you trust that data if indeed it is released? Stefano, there's a lot of angry Venezuelans that want to see 
 
 it, certainly. Good to have you with us. Thank you there. Stefano Pozzeban.
 
All right. In the United States now, Kamala Harris' presidential campaign believes it can achieve something many Democrats didn't think was even 
 
 remotely possible 10 days ago, and that's win the battleground State of Georgia.
 
In just moments from now, the U.S. vice president will speak at a rally in Atlanta. This as she launched a new $50 million ad campaign. Meanwhile 
 
 Donald Trump launched his own ad campaign, attacking Harris on immigration and casting her as the Biden administration's border czar. Kristen Holmes 
 
 has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Vice President Kamala Harris is hitting the campaign trail tonight, holding a rally in the 
 
 critical battleground State of Georgia. Seeking to keep the state Joe Biden flipped in 2020 blue in 2024. This, as a source tells CNN, Harris and her 
 
 vice-presidential running mate will travel to several battleground states next week. A new sign that Harris is inching closer to deciding who will 
 
 share the top of the ticket.
 
The Harris campaign also out with a new ad, as they seek to educate voters on the vice president's record.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The one thing Kamala Harris has always been, fearless as a prosecutor.
 
HOLMES (voice-over):  Focusing on her public service.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  As California's attorney general, she went after the big banks.
 
KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE:  We believe in a future where every person has the opportunity. 
 
 But Donald Trump wants to take our country backward.
 
HOLMES (voice-over):  The ad is part of a $50 million blitz ahead of next month's Democratic Convention. Meanwhile, Former President Donald Trump's 
 
 campaign is up with their own ads today, zeroing in on Harris record on immigration.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Under Harris, over 10 million illegally here. A quarter of a million Americans dead from federal.
 
LESTER HOLT, NBC NIGHTLY NEWS ANCHOR:  Do you have any plans to visit the border? You haven't been to the border.
 
HARRIS:  And I haven't been to Europe. I mean, I don't understand the point that you're making.
 
HOLMES (voice-over):  With a multimillion-dollar ad buy in six key battleground states. Trump's team believes the border is a political 
 
 liability, and one that the former president can seize on.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Kamala Harris failed. Weak. Dangerously liberal.
 
HOLMES (voice-over):  As Trump's vice-presidential nominee J. D. Vance remains under fire for his 2021 childless cat lady remarks, CNN's KFILE 
 
 uncovering a pattern of disparaging comments from Vance towards those without kids, including this statement in 2020.
 
SEN. JD VANCE (R-OH), VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  The fact that so many people, especially in America's leadership class just don't have that in 
 
 their lives, you know, I worry that it makes people more sociopathic and ultimately, our whole country a little bit less mentally stable.
 
HOLMES (voice-over):  Trump defending Vance in an interview Monday.
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  He's not against anything, but he loves family. It's very important to him. 
 
 He grew up in a very interesting family situation and he feels family is good. And I don't think there's anything wrong in saying that.
 <br>[18:15:00]
 
HOLMES (voice-over):  Vance now facing new scrutiny after "The Washington Post" obtained audio of the vice-presidential candidate from a donor event, 
 
 projecting less confidence in the race against Harris than the Trump campaign has let on.
 
VANCE:  All of us were hit with a little bit of a political sucker punch. The bad news is that Kamala Harris does not have the same baggage as Joe 
 
 Biden, because whatever we might have to say, Kamala Harris is a lot younger.

CHATTERLEY:  OK. Straight ahead, Microsoft's moment. The tech giant is just out with its Q2 results. Are company is still splashing the cash on A.I.? 
 
 Yes, is the answer.
 
Plus, yummy gummies. The inspiring story of a Japanese American entrepreneur who created a bestselling cleaner candy line. Her recipe for 
 
 success just ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHATTERLEY:  Welcome back to "First Move." And tech stocks seeing red as investors await the Fed. All that and more topping today's "Money Move." It 
 
 was a tough Tuesday for big tech with the NASDAQ falling more than one and a quarter percent. But the blue chips put in a blue-chip performance amid 
 
 new signs of U.S. economic resilience.
 
Job openings dipped just slightly last month and consumer confidence is on the rise. The Fed surely taking notice too, as it studies its new policy 
 
 statement due Wednesday. We did see a softer day across Asia too, but modest gains for Japanese stocks as the Bank of Japan began its two-day 
 
 policy meeting. We'll find out if the BOJ is going to raise rates or keep them steady in just a few hours' time.
 
Now, the tech troubles in the United States may not be over yet after just released results from Microsoft, the tech giant beating on the top and 
 
 bottom lines, but results from its so-called intelligent cloud division, a key gauge of A.I. demand missed expectations. It shares a down some 3.5 
 
 percent in afterhours trade.
 
Paul La Monica joins us now. He's senior markets analysis writer at Barron's. Paul, welcome. I'm not having that. It's not surely about cloud 
 
 growth when it's glowing -- growing at 29 percent. This is about the bill, the amount of money, surely that they're spending on A.I.
 
PAUL R. LA MONICA, SENIOR MARKETS ANALYSIS WRITER, BARRON'S:  Yes, exactly. Julia. Definitely Microsoft has been one of those magnificent seven tech 
 
 stocks that the expectations were extremely high. So, I do think even though it is the tiniest of meats to pick, 29 percent year over year growth 
 
 for Azure when the street was maybe expecting 30 percent doesn't sound like a dramatic slowdown. But I think, you know, investors really want to see 
 
 growth that's even higher than forecast.
 <br>[18:20:00]
 
But to your point, when you look at the fact that Microsoft had 111.3 billion in cash on its balance sheet at the end of the 4th quarter a year 
 
 ago, now it is 75.5 billion, so it's still a fortress balance sheet, of course, but that's a tremendous amount cash burn. It's down from about 80 
 
 billion a quarter ago as well.
 
So, Microsoft, much like we saw with the Alphabet numbers last week, Google spending a lot of investments on the cloud, but it may not be paying off 
 
 for the software and services companies just yet. The beneficiaries are AMD, which reported strong earnings after the close today, and probably 
 
 NVIDIA as well. Both those stocks up after hours.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes. So, you can see the beneficiaries, ultimately, of this A.I. spend, and you can see it in their numbers that they're doing 
 
 incredibly well. But I think your point is a very apt one. $112 billion down to $75 billion in the space of, what, six to eight months. That's a 
 
 significant amount of money to be spending.
 
What we have seen more broadly in the market is a rotation away from some of these larger cap stocks into smaller cap stocks. And that's hurt some of 
 
 these big tech companies that have had a fantastic year so far. Do you see this as a reason to perhaps continue that trend, or at least not a reason 
 
 for it to either to accelerate nor slow?
 
LA MONICA:  Yes, we'll have a better sense of that, Julia, when we get those results from Meta platforms, from Amazon, and from Apple, those other 
 
 three magnates and seven companies reporting this week. NVIDIA doesn't report until the end of August. We're going to have to wait a while to see 
 
 whether or not NVIDIA still has that momentum on the chip side for A.I.
 
I do think, though, that especially with the Federal Reserve appearing to be inching towards a rate cut in September, Jerome Powell might hinted that 
 
 again when the Fed meets tomorrow, they're not going to do anything with rates unless they really want to shock the market. So, I think investors 
 
 will be waiting to hear about potential rate cuts. That would, I think, trigger another rotation for some of the value stocks, financials, some of 
 
 the industrials.
 
And then, small caps, because small caps have more exposure to the American economy. And the hope is that we're going to get this soft landing with the 
 
 Fed starting to cut rates in the fall, maybe doing so in December.
 
I've talked to some people who've said that November may still even be on the table, despite what will be considerable election drama, most likely. 
 
 So, two cuts, maybe three this year. And, you know, we could be getting rate cuts all the way down.
 
CHATTERLEY:  I think you're being optimistic.
 
LA MONICA:  I think I am being optimistic. But, again, the Fed -- if Jerome Powell really wants to show how independent of a body the Fed is, then 
 
 basically toss up your hands and say, we don't care what the Electoral College thinks. We're going to do what is best for the economy despite what 
 
 happened in those elections two days ago, they will have two days, that November meeting comes the Thursday, not the Wednesday after election day. 
 
 But, you know, I don't think we're going to have a winner decided by that point just yet. Call me crazy.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes, I take that bet. But I do think interesting your point about if we do see confirmation of the intention at least to cut in 
 
 September, then that could be another potential lift for some of these stocks. So, noted. Paul La Monica, great to have you on as always, sir. 
 
 Thank you.
 
LA MONICA:  Thank you.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Now, the Olympics are heating up. Tuesday was the hottest day of the year so far for Paris, with temperatures reaching a, wowsers, 36 
 
 degrees Celsius, or almost 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The high heat has already impacted some events, with tennis games allowing breaks between 
 
 sets. For more on this, we're joined by Chad Myers.
 
Wow, this is hot, Chad. How long is this going to continue?
 
CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  It really is. I mean, we have a cold front that's going to come through. Cold front is going to eventually chill 
 
 things off quite nicely, I think. But remember, we talked about this yesterday. Here's France right there. We talked about this yesterday, the 
 
 potential for thunderstorms for today. And they are here now tonight. It's after dark. It's midnight or so here.
 
But 29 still right now in Paris. So, yes, not even cooling down yet, but it will. Why? Because storms fired down near Le Mans and then eventually now 
 
 rolling right up into Paris proper, especially northern suburbs up there. But this is going to drop temperatures at least another five to 10 degrees.
 
If it drops another 150 to 100 and 200 and whatever millimeters of rainfall, that's going to be another problem for the Seine, but at least it 
 
 doesn't really run that way. At least we're looking at north of the city for most of the precip, at least for now, that could continue for most of 
 
 the night.
 <br>[18:25:00]
 
It does get mild, though, by the weekend. It looks very, very nice by the weekend. Temperatures tomorrow are going to be in the 30s, 32 for Paris. A 
 
 couple of showers by morning still lingering around. But Thursday, Friday and even into Saturday look really nice and dry where temperatures are 
 
 going to be down closer to normal, where you should be 26, and on Saturday, you'll be 27. So, we can't tell the difference.
 
Here we go, though. This is Kerala in India, the west coast of India itself, picking up somewhere around 200 millimeters of rainfall in just 24 
 
 hours. That's eight inches -- seven inches of rain in just 24 hours, and that flooding occurred. Nearly 100 people right now have lost their lives 
 
 and they're still picking up the pieces. And it will still rain tonight and it will rain again tomorrow. Another 100 to 150 millimeters of rain on top 
 
 of those devastated villages there right here along the west coast of India, in Kerala proper. Julia.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Wow. Thoughts with everybody there. Chad, good to have you. Thank you. Stay with CNN. We'll be right back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHATTERLEY:  Welcome back to "First Move" with a look at more international headlines this hour. A third child has died following a stabbing attack in 
 
 Northern England. A 17-year-old suspect has been arrested. Prime Minister Keir Starmer laid flowers at the site in Southport saying that as a father, 
 
 he couldn't imagine their family's grief. The attack took place at an event at a dance school. All three girls who died were under 10 years old.
 
The acting director of the U.S. Secret Service testified at a contentious Senate hearing Tuesday into the assassination attempt against Former 
 
 President Donald Trump. Ronald Rowe gave a damning assessment of the security breakdown in Butler, Pennsylvania, saying the Secret Service was 
 
 directly to blame. He said he is ashamed of what took place and that the agency will learn from its mistakes.
 <br>[18:30:00]
 
And returning to our top story once again this hour. Israel has claimed responsibility for a strike in the Beirut area. It says the strike killed a 
 
 Hezbollah commander. This follows Saturday's rocket attack in which 12 children in the Golan Heights lost their lives, with Israel blaming 
 
 Hezbollah for the strike. The Israeli military says it wasn't looking for a fight, but was prepared for one.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REAR ADMIRAL DANIEL HAGARI, IDF SPOKESPERSON:  The IDF will not tolerate terrorist attack on Israeli civilians. We have been responding to these 
 
 attacks with precise strikes on Hezbollah commanders, terror operatives, and military infrastructures in Lebanon.
 
Hezbollah's ongoing aggression and brutal attacks are dragging the people of Lebanon and the entire Middle East into a wider escalation, while we 
 
 prefer to resolve hostilities without a wider war. The IDF is fully prepared for any scenario.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHATTERLEY:  And we're joined now by retired U.S. Army General Wesley Clark. General Clark, great to have you on the show with us, sir. Is this a 
 
 proportional response to the strike that we saw at the weekend?
 
GEN. WESLEY CLARK (RET.), FORMER NATO SUPREME ALLIED COMMANDER AND U.S. ARMY (RET.):  That's the intent. Yes, that it would be a proportional 
 
 response. And I think Israel, as the spokesman said, doesn't want an escalation. So, they attempted a proportional response.
 
CHATTERLEY:  I mean, Hezbollah has denied the strike that killed those 12 children at the weekend. How do you now expect them to respond, if at all, 
 
 to the response?
 
CLARK:  I expect that Hezbollah is probably not going to respond. I think Hezbollah and Iran don't want a wider war. What they want is a drip, drip, 
 
 drip, peck, peck, peck attack on Israel. It makes Israel an unlikely, unwelcome place to invest money. They want to squeeze Israel politically, 
 
 economically, diplomatically, and it's a long-term war of attrition at this point.
 
One of Iran's motives has to be that it's protecting its nuclear assets. And were the war to escalate, I'm sure Israel would look at the opportunity 
 
 to take out what it believes to be Iran's nuclear potential.
 
CHATTERLEY:  John Kirby, the White House national security communication adviser, said this week that he believed that the risk of a broader 
 
 conflict or a war, as you're pointing out here, is being over exaggerated. Just based on what you're saying here, I think, for whatever reason you 
 
 decide to point to you would agree with him.
 
CLARK:  That's right. I think that both sides want to avoid escalation, but Iran wants to keep inflicting punishment on Israel. Israel has its hands 
 
 full with Hamas, but Israel is going to respond to these prick, prick, prick attacks that keep coming from Lebanon. And when they kill a bunch of 
 
 children, they're going to respond more strongly.
 
CHATTERLEY:  When do mistakes happen in this case? Because as you're suggesting, if Iran is, in some way, approving of these sporadic attacks 
 
 that we're seeing and Israel saying, look, we're not trying to precipitate some wider conflict here, the risk, particularly as this continues, and 
 
 despite the talks behind the scenes pushing, we hope, towards some kind of ceasefire and hostage release, the risks of something tipping, spilling 
 
 over into worse is rising.
 
CLARK:  Well, this kind of conflict could go on for a long time, and it's connected to several different events outside the conflict. One would be 
 
 the future of the American presidential elections. So, who's going to come into office and what will be their policies? Another would be Iran's 
 
 efforts to gain nuclear power and actual deliverable nuclear warheads. If that happens and they admit it and it's known in the Middle East, it will 
 
 change the equation.
 
Another outside factor is Russia and how much Russia wants a distraction from western efforts to resolve Ukraine. So, events in this region are 
 
 they're subject to outside forces and influence.
 
CHATTERLEY:  General Clark, how do you think Iran, to your point, about the influence of the presidential elections this year and how perhaps policy 
 
 might change? Do you have a sense of how they're perceiving what a potential return of a President Trump would look like versus a potential 
 
 President Harris?
 <br>[18:35:00]
 
CLARK:  I think that the Iranians believe that President Trump would probably be harsher, more prone to have a maximum pressure crackdown, more 
 
 prone to use military force against them. And perhaps the Iranians believe that that if Vice President Harris becomes commander-in-chief, she'd be 
 
 more open to some kind of an accommodation based on the fact that the Democratic administrations in the past have sponsored the efforts through 
 
 the joint comprehensive program of action to get a diplomatic resolution to the Iranian nuclear program.
 
But the truth is, whoever is elected president of the United States in November is going to be very tough on Iran, because Iran has moved forward 
 
 with its nuclear program. Most of the information that's available to me at least suggest they may already have one or two nuclear weapons. They may 
 
 test before the election in fact. So, I think this could be one of the first crises that hits the new administration, whether it's Democratic or 
 
 Republican.
 
CHATTERLEY:  And we have about 30 seconds and I'm going to push you on this. Would you agree that less money, less ability and flexibility for 
 
 Iran to move here means less financing for groups like Hamas and Hezbollah? And that has to be remembered.
 
CLARK:  I think that we not properly constrained Iranian hegemonic aspirations. And Hezbollah has gotten too powerful. It's too strong. It's 
 
 too much of a meddler inside Lebanon and the region, along with the other of the terrorist organizations that Iran runs. So, I think whoever becomes 
 
 president of the United States is going to have to deal with this.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes. General Wesley Clark, sir, always good to get your insights. Sir, thank you. Now, gunfire erupted in Haiti's capital as the 
 
 country's leader gave an interview to CNN. Just watch this.
 
So, that shootout you're seeing happened just minutes after our Larry Madawo interviewed interim Haitian Prime Minister Gary Connell. They were 
 
 at Port-au-Prince's hospital destroyed by gangs when shots rang out in a nearby neighborhood. It actually turns out it was the interim's leader's 
 
 security team providing cover to get him out of the building safely.
 
No one was injured and the prime minister did return to his office safely. And Larry Madawo explains what happened.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
LARRY MADAWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  That dramatic afternoon highlighting the security challenges, the gang violence problem here in Port-au-Prince, the 
 
 Haitian capital. We were speaking to Interim Prime Minister Gary Connell when we heard shots in the air.
 
A short while after that, his security detail motioned for him to stop and they motioned him back into his car and we stayed out of there. We kept 
 
 hearing shots throughout that time. We now know after having seen video and eyewitness accounts, Haitian police and Kenyan police were firing. They 
 
 said to provide cover as the Haitian prime minister's convoy sped out of there.
 
One eyewitness telling CNN that they saw gang members exchanging fire with the police. In that moment, the prime minister was safely escorted back to 
 
 his residence, and there were no casualties, no injuries on the Haitian side or on the Kenyan side.
 
In the moment this happened, and this is extraordinary, it was probably the most protected place in Port-au-Prince with a prime minister and two 
 
 ministers, the head of the Haitian National Police there and the Kenyan head of the Multinational Security Support Force.
 
I had asked the prime minister how he feels about the security challenges here and if he fears for his own life.
 
Do you fear for your life doing this job?
 
GARRY CONILLE, HAITIAN INTERIM PRIME MINISTER:  We don't give it much thought, and it's not just me. I mean, we've been put -- able to put 
 
 together an incredible group of men and women that have left their jobs and their careers to be able to commit to this. And to be honest, it's rarely 
 
 part of our thought. Now, I am privileged. I have a whole bunch of men and women that try to make sure that nothing happens.
 
MADAWO:  The fact that he took us to this university hospital that's been vandalized and destroyed by gangs, he took us there because the Kenyans and 
 
 Haitians recently reclaimed it and the Haitian prime minister's desires to reopen it so that Haitians can have medical care, which is a short supply 
 
 right now.
 
But as he was making that appeal to the International Community, it appears the gang leaders made a direct target of this same facility that he hopes 
 
 to reopen. And that really highlights the challenges, the gang violence problem at the heart of the Haitian capital.

CHATTERLEY:  Our thanks to Larry there. OK. Coming up for us. How one mom Googled her way into the food business. Mika Shino battled to make her 
 
 success of her healthy, Asian inspired gummies. And now, she's reaping the rewards. A sweet story for you next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:40:00]
 
CHATTERLEY:  Welcome back to "First Move." A Japanese-American mother of two who wanted to protect her family from processed junk food has created a 
 
 bestselling candy range here in In the United States. Mika Shino founded Issei, selling mochi gummies, which embrace traditional Japanese 
 
 ingredients of rice and water, from a recipe she used to enjoy growing up.
 
It's sold as an alternative to traditional gummies loaded with sugar and artificial flavors. And within eight months of setting up, she scored a 
 
 deal to supply 170 Whole Foods stores. Now, her clean confectionery mission is being recognized on the front cover of "Ink" magazine, which she shares 
 
 with Katy Perry. Not bad.
 
Mika is also ranked number two in the top 200 female founder list of world changing companies. But her journey to the top was far from a sweet ride, 
 
 as we're about to discover. And Mika joins us now. Mika, congratulations and fantastic to have you on the show. Just start by explaining why you 
 
 began this business.
 
MIKA SHINO, FOUNDER AND CEO, ISSEI MOCHI GUMMIES:  Well, thank you so much, Julia, for having me. It's an honor. So, I started this journey because I 
 
 have two boys and they love anything chewy. So, gummy bears, sour patch, gummy worms. If it's chewy, they wanted to have it. And as a mother, I 
 
 always felt guilty about giving them something that I knew was full of a lot of artificial flavors and colors and mainly made with gelatin, which is 
 
 pork base. It's boiled pork skin and bones, and, you know, the origins are not really very clear as to where gelatin comes from a lot of times.
 
So, I started to make these slabs of mochi cakes. Mochi is a Japanese confectionary, and I grew up eating it just as a cake with tea. But I kind 
 
 of knew that there had to be some way to mimic the chewy candies that my boys are always asking for. And so, it started in my kitchen. It really 
 
 started very naively and very simply.
 
CHATTERLEY:  It's plant-based, it's kosher, it's gluten, it's dairy, it's nut free, and it's all natural ingredients. What is actually in it then? 
 
 Can you give me all the ingredients? Because I think some of the candy that you were mentioning there, it's the antithesis of clean. So, actually 
 
 having something that does taste it, and I've tried it, and they're pretty yummy, I have to say. But it is, in your words, far cleaner than the 
 
 alternatives out there, particularly if you're trying to protect your children.
 
SHINO:  Absolutely. For me, the main concern was gelatin, was the pork. I used to feel a lot of discomfort eating a lot of gelatin-based candies. So, 
 
 our ingredients are, like you said, clean. Clean, meaning that there's no animal derived products and no artificial sweeteners, no artificial colors, 
 
 no artificial flavors, and the chew comes from basically rice and tapioca flour.
 <br>[18:45:00]
 
So, two plant-based ingredients, and that's what really gives it that texture. So, we've got tapioca syrup, some real sugar and natural colors 
 
 coming from different vegetables.
 
CHATTERLEY:  I mean, you're selling in all sorts of places, Walmart, Whole Foods, Sprouts, Albertsons for people that live in the United States. How 
 
 easy was it to find a manufacturer that could help you with what is a traditional Japanese treat?
 
SHINO:  Well, Julia, that was really the most difficult part because nobody had tried to make this before. Even in Japan, you know, mochi has existed 
 
 for over a millennia. It's a sacred food that's offered to the gods during New Year and celebrations, but nobody tried to sell it as a shelf stable 
 
 candy that rivals jelly beans and gummy bears. So, finding a partner, finding a facility that knew how to make it was really, really challenging.
 
And for the first order that we delivered to Whole Foods, I, together with my husband my kids and a few other factory workers, we hand slabbed and 
 
 hand cut 3,000 pounds of mochi. So, it was a very difficult road. It was -- you know, everybody got tendinitis and we were all just -- afterwards. We 
 
 cut mochi for three months over summer break. And that's how we did our first delivery.
 
So, luckily, now we have a bigger facility, a bigger processing machine, but even that, once we got the machine, it had to be customized. You know, 
 
 our starches are tapioca and rice starches didn't gel properly. It would just be like a big gooey mess like Play Doh. It was really a very difficult 
 
 road where every night, you know, you're worried. You get up every morning with a knot in your stomach, you're bleeding money, you don't know if it's 
 
 going to work. And you think, why did we do this? How did I -- you know, how did I get myself into this?
 
CHATTERLEY:  And your children are suffering from repetitive strain injury, which I think is -- there's some tough things about being a founder. Just -
 
 - wait, I have to ask you about, Issei, I have to ask you about the name. I read that you called it a love letter to immigrant communities everywhere. 
 
 What does it mean to you to share a bit of your history, culture with others?
 
SHINO:  That's such an amazing question, Julia. Thank you for that. Issei means first generation Japanese immigrants. And it's very specific to the 
 
 Japanese community. There's first generation Issei. Nisei, second generation and on and on, Sansei, Yonsei. And we hold that very dear to our 
 
 hearts. But for me, it was really a hope to elevate immigrant culture of everybody in the U.S. And what we bring to this country and what we bring 
 
 to the table and the heritage that we have.
 
And I think a lot of the memories and the experiences that we carry with us to this country share through food. So, the flavors, the textures, the 
 
 meals that, you know, by breaking bread you become closer together and you bring the community together. So, I really saw a gap in, you know, many of 
 
 the different segments of the food category where, you know, immigrant experience and immigrant heritage was underrepresented.
 
So, definitely, the candy aisle, there's a lack of diversity and a lack of inclusion in terms of global flavors, you know, global textures. And I 
 
 really wanted to contribute to that. And also, you know, have my kids be proud of seeing their culture reflected on the aisles.
 
And we started with very familiar flavors, like strawberry, mango, vanilla, but we intend to really explore all the Asian flavors, Middle Eastern 
 
 flavors, Latin American flavors, because there's so many beautiful flavors and textures and experiences that you can -- you know, you can provide and 
 
 share.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes. Yuzu, please. I'm putting in a special request. We're actually sharing the packets. I had some, but we ate them all. So, they're 
 
 over your left shoulder for viewers. Viewers that are watching. My apologies. We ate them all. Yes. Mika, stay in touch. Congratulations. And 
 
 I can't wait to hear about progress soon in the future. Thank you.
 
All right. Coming up -- 
 
SHINO:  Thank you.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Thank you. Coming up after the break, smiles from Biles leading the U.S. gymnastics team to victory in Paris and bending over 
 
 backwards to bring pied to Team USA. That's next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:50:00]
 
CHATTERLEY:  Welcome back to "First Move." And to some fantastic gymnasts. The U.S. women's team won gold in Paris after overcoming Italy and Brazil. 
 
 Simone Biles fought through a calf injury to take victory, and the team competition medal makes her the most decorated U.S. gymnast of all time.
 
But Olympic glory will have to wait for competitors in the men's triathlon meanwhile. It's been postponed until Wednesday because of the poor water 
 
 quality in the River Seine. Officials are watching the weather to determine when it will be safe to swim again.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
AURELIE MERLE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF SPORTS, PARIS 2024:  We've seen that we go from, you know, heavy rain to extreme heat like today in very few 
 
 days. So, it's actually hard to control how it can affect the quality of a river.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes, we don't envy them. Now, so far, Japan has collected the most gold medals, the U.S. leading the overall count, followed by France. 
 
 Don Riddell is following all the action for us. I may have actually watched the women's team in gymnastics because the enticement, the excitement, and 
 
 the hype around this was huge.
 
DON RIDDELL, CNN WORLD SPORT:  Yes. Absolutely, Julia. So much hype and it delivered on Tuesday anyway. Let's show you what happened. The American 
 
 icon, Simone Biles, making history, leading her country to victory in the team event. Coming back from the mentally devastating twisties that so 
 
 plagued her in Tokyo. Biles is now the most decorated U.S. gymnast of all time. This was her fifth Olympic gold medal. She'll be going for four more 
 
 later this week.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SIMONE BILES, WON 5TH CAREER OLYMPIC GOLD MEDAL:  So, at the beginning of the day, I started off with therapy this morning. So, that was super 
 
 exciting, and then I told her I was feeling calm and ready, and that's kind of exactly what happened.
 
But after I finished vault, I was relieved. I was like, whew, because at least no flashbacks or anything. But I did feel a lot of relief. And as 
 
 soon as I landed vault, I was like, oh, yes, I'm definitely -- we're going to do this.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
RIDDELL:  It is no secret that New Zealand loves its rugby. And so, I guess it should be no surprise that one of their rugby teams landed their first 
 
 medal of the Games, and it just so happened to be gold. In the women's sevens final on Tuesday, New Zealand beat Canada by 19 to 12. Canada 
 
 actually were surprise finalists here. They were five points up at halftime, but the Black Ferns showed their experience by scoring two tries 
 
 in the second half. New Zealand's women really do love this competition, winning silver in Rio. And now, back-to-back goals in Tokyo and Paris.
 
And bronze medal went to the American team who scored a thrilling last gasp try to stun Australia and send them home with nothing. And the Aussies had 
 
 a nightmare day, blowing a 12-point lead against Canada in the semis and then snatching defeat from the jaws of victory here. Team USA, though, were 
 
 absolutely thrilled. This is the first sevens medal for either their men's or women's teams.
 
In tennis, they're becoming known as Nadalcaraz. Two legendary Spanish tennis players who are combining at opposite ends of their glittering 
 
 careers in search of Olympic glory. On Tuesday, Rafa Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz teamed up again to win their second round match in the doubles, 
 
 beating the Dutch team in three sets. These men, of course, just love this Roland Garros venue. Nadal won a record 14 French Open Titles here. Alcaraz 
 
 has just won his first. They'll play the Americans Austin Krycek and Rajeev Ram in the quarterfinals.
 
Andy Murray says that he'll be retiring after these Olympics, but he is in absolutely no hurry for that day to come. He and partner Dan Evans pulled 
 
 off another thrilling victory in the doubles, saving two match points and beating their Belgian opponents in a third set tiebreak.
 <br>[18:55:00]
 
He, remember, is a two-time Olympic champion. And if he keeps this up, that he might well end up with another Olympic medal, Murray and Evans, into the 
 
 quarterfinals, Julia.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Wow. I mean, there's so much to discuss, but can we quickly please talk about Gabriel Medina?
 
RIDDELL:  Yes.
 
CHATTERLEY:  One of my friends sent me this picture, and I thought, you know, you idiot, this is the worst A.I. fake superimposed.
 
RIDDELL:  Yes.
 
CHATTERLEY:  So, we didn't do it on the show and it turns out it's real.
 
RIDDELL:  It's so Photoshopped, right? I mean, that just -- look at it. It's just -- it's almost ridiculous. He's standing on a cloud just as cool 
 
 as a cucumber. No, this really did happen. I've seen the video of it happening. Unfortunately, because of the broadcast restrictions we can't 
 
 show you the video. But to be honest, this is way cooler.
 
CHATTERLEY:  This is better.
 
RIDDELL:  The photo is way, way cooler. Yes, just an absolutely amazing moment. He is a national hero in Brazil. He's absolutely beloved there. One 
 
 of the biggest names in surfing. He, of course, will be hoping that he can end the week with a medal, preferably a gold one. The surfing was suspended 
 
 in Tahiti on Tuesday because of the bad weather, but hopefully, they can go again on Wednesday. But yes, let's just admire that photo in the meantime. 
 
 Amazing stuff.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes. The photographer gets a gold medal too. I'm actually being told to shut up. I'm over on time. Oops. Don Riddell, thank you so 
 
 much for that.
 
And that just about wraps up the show. Thank you for joining us. We'll see you tomorrow.
