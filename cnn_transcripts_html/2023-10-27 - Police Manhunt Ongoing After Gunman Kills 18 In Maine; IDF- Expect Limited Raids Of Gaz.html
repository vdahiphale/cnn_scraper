PAULA NEWTON, CNN ANCHOR: Hello, and welcome to our viewers joining us from the United States and all around the world. I'm Paula Newton. And we begin in Maine where police are in their second night of hunting for the suspect in two back to back mass shootings that killed 18 people and wounded more than a dozen others.
 
Law enforcement descended on the suspect's last known address just a few hours ago. Authorities were later heard shouting, you're under arrest and come up with your hands up. Though it appears the suspect was not there at the time. Police are searching for this man, 40-year- old Robert Card. He is considered armed and dangerous. He's charged with multiple counts of murder. Officials are telling residents in the areas around Lewiston, Maine to stay vigilant, remain inside and lock their doors as their search for Card continues.
 
That search now ongoing and there are other locations they plan to investigate in the coming hours. Now schools and government properties will again be closed on Friday while the suspect is still on the loose. Hundreds of local state and federal agents are involved in the search and that investigation into Wednesday's massacre.
 
This is the deadliest mass shooting in the United States this year. It took place at two locations Wednesday evening, first a bowling alley and then a restaurant. CNN's Brian Todd breaks down how the shootings and subsequent search unfolded.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
COLONEL WILLIAM ROSS, MAINE STATE POLICE: He should be considered armed and dangerous.
 
BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): And intense manhunt underway in Maine for the shooter who went on a rampage Wednesday night, killing 18 people and injuring 13 others at two different locations. Hundreds of law enforcement personnel by land, air and even at sea looking for the suspect, 40-year-old Robert Card, an army reservist who spent two weeks in a mental health facility this past summer and is still at large.
 
ROSS: We believe this is someone that should not be approached that approximately 6:56 p.m. the Auburn Communication Center received a 911 call of a male shooting in just in time or the spirit time Recreation Center. Shortly after that and about 7:08 p.m., the Communication Center received multiple 911 calls about an active shooter inside of Schemengees billiards.
 
TODD (voice-over): Shortly after 8pm officials have released a photo of the shooter. And by 9:26 p.m. Lewiston police received a call identifying the suspect. And then just before 10:00 p.m., police say they located his car. Now an entire community is left in fear of being asked to shelter in place. Businesses are shut down and schools ordered closed through Friday. Witnesses left in shock.
 
MEGHAN HUTCHINSON, DAUGHTER SURVIVED SHOOTING: She was grazed by a bullet while we were running.
 
ZOE LEVESQUE, SURVIVED SHOOTING: I never thought I'd grow up and get a bullet and my leg and it's just like, why, like why do people do this.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He was holding a weapon, I just booked it down the lane. And I slid basically into where the pins are.
 
TODD (voice-over): Others mourning the loss of family in another senseless shooting.
 
LEROY WALKER, SON KILLED IN SHOOTING: When you get anything that happens like this, you go empty. And it's just nothing, nothing you can do.
 
TODD (voice-over): Many are asking, were warning signs missed. According to a National Guard spokesperson, the shooter was reported as behaving erratically at an army training facility this past July. And sources say he made statements about hearing voices and wanting to shoot up a National Guard Base. He was then transported to an army hospital for medical evaluation.
 
SEN. ANGUS KING, (I-ME): Now I'm sure there'll be a lot of review of this and a lot of analysis. Was there something missed? Was he deemed a danger to himself or someone else?
 
TODD (on camera): A law enforcement source tells CNN that investigators found a gun in a car connected to the suspect, Robert Card, but it is unclear whether that gun was used in the shootings. Meanwhile, a former colleague of Card's who was in the U.S. Army Reserves with him told CNN that Card is a skilled outdoorsman and marksman and was one of the best shooters in their unit.
 
Brian Todd, CNN, Bowdoin, Maine.

NEWTON: For more on this, we want to bring in Daniel Brunner who is a retired FBI Supervisory Special Agent and I thank you for being with us. You know it is more than 24 hours now and I can't imagine how tense it is for residents in Maine at this hour. What does it tell you about how far the suspect could have gotten now and could he possibly have used a boat, does he perhaps headed for the border?
 <br>[01:05:09]
 
DANIEL BRUNNER, FBI SUPERVISORY SPECIAL AGENT (RET.): Thank you for having me on. I think there's a tremendous amount of possibilities. And that's what the investigators in the command team is working on right now is to try and get into his mind utilizing whether he was on social media or other methods of getting his preparing his plan.
 
He has a multitude of options that were at his disposal where he left his vehicle, he could have gotten into a second vehicle and he could be as far away as Florida at this time. He could have gotten into a boat and or he could have gone on foot into the woods. I think the boat option going out into the Atlantic and other Coast Guard is patrolling, I think that is the least likely of the options because his smaller craft needs fuel.
 
And he would have known this that he would have attracted attention of anybody getting for him obtaining fuel. So I think the most likely option based on what we're learning about the subject is that he is very adept to the rural area of the woods. He's very knowledgeable about these wooded areas. So I think either him going out on foot at the boat dock area, or taking the boat down river to other locations where he had supply setup. Eric Rudolph in 1998, was a man -- of five year manhunt after he was put on the 10 Most Wanted, the Atlantic City bombing, excuse me, the Atlanta Olympic bombing, and then other medical facilities.
 
And then he was on the run for five years because of the same situation. He was familiar with the woods. He had set up, and he was able to stay hidden from law enforcement for over five years. So I think that is one of the most likely scenarios that he either went from foot from that parking area, or he took his craft downriver. Now, law enforcement is trying to get these leads together. And once they establish a good lead, then they'll start focusing the search teams on that area.
 
NEWTON: And I want to get to the issue of leads in a moment. But you make the point that if this attack was well planned out, and it seems like it was, then it is likely that his escape may have been well planned as well.
 
BRUNNER: Absolutely, I think it one goes in the other. He knew where he was going, the two locations which were four miles apart. He knew that he had to travel 10 miles to the boat dock. So everything seemed to be very well thought out. I know there's a focus on his mental health issues. But that doesn't take away from the possibility that he had planned this out. He was prepared for this. He knew how to make entry. He knew how to conduct the shooting operation.
 
The fact that he is very likely on the run, my gut would say that he is in those wooded areas right there because he's familiar with that, for him to travel by vehicle, and to go to South Carolina and go to Florida, where he is in unknown territory is the least likely of the scenarios. But what's most important is law enforcement and the FBI, HSI, all these agencies are going to look at every single lead, every possibility they're going to talk to their partner agencies, in those divisions, Atlanta division, all the way up to 56 different FBI divisions across the country, everyone is prepared for leads that may be coming out at the Incident Command Center, which is set up there in Maine.
 
If those leads come in, they're going to go rush it out. It doesn't matter what hour it is. I know FBI Boston. I know a lot of agents that are there. And they're very much working very diligently along with tactical operations specialists. And we understand that this is a very clear and present danger for the people of Maine right now. And that's why there's no holds barred. All law enforcement agencies are doing their best to figure out where he has gone.
 
NEWTON: Yes. And that's the issue, you have tens of thousands of people right now and shelter in place. And this goes to what I was saying earlier about any clues or tips that they may have. And I appreciate, there are many, many smart people working on this right now. And yet the fact that they went back to his last known address now twice, what does that tell you about concrete clues they have real tips about what you might be doing and where you might be?
 
BRUNNER: Well, the fact, the difference between a concrete clue and a possibility or a lead, every clue, every tip, everything is washed out everything, every phone call that is provided, his call to 911, they're going to look at every single one. There's not going to be one that's going to be overlooked.
 
The fact that of why they went back to the house at a second time, I don't -- I can't give you a reason why. Maybe somebody saw something. Maybe somebody heard something. Maybe a dog was barking. There's any number of reasons why. And, you know, why the tactical teams will conduct that second entry.
 
Now what FBI SWAT what we will do now, what FBI SWAT does now is a much more methodical entry instead of what used to be what you see in the movies, a dynamic entry where FBI SWAT comes rushing into the house. Lately, our new protocol in the FBI is controlled, approach the house. Surround the house. Let everyone know in the house, hey, FBI is here. Your best option is to come out.
 <br>[01:10:23]
 
So when those statements were on the bullhorn have come out with your hands up, come out to the truck. Those were just protocol statements. That doesn't mean that there was actually someone that was actually seen in there. We just make those statements. The FBI makes those statements, because that is the protocol. That is the way the FBI SWAT will make surrounding to prepare for a search warrant, then they'll make those next, maybe sending a drone or a canine if that's available. So there are steps to slowly approach.
 
NEWTON: Well, that's certainly been enlightening in terms of the process that's ongoing right now on the ground in Maine, as you said, with all of those law enforcement resources on the ground, Daniel Brunner for us, appreciate it.
 
BRUNNER: Thank you.
 
NEWTON: Now we are learning more about some of the people who lost their lives in the rampage in Maine. These are a few, just a few of the victims who have been identified so far. Arthur Strout, a father of five children was killed at the restaurant on Wednesday night where he had been playing pool. His family was told he was at hospital at first. And then on Thursday, they learned the awful truth.
 
Joseph Walker was the manager of the restaurant. His father, who you saw earlier says Joseph was killed when he tried to stop the shooter from killing others. Bryan MacFarlane was part of the local deaf community and usually went to the restaurant to play cornhole on Wednesdays. His sister tells CNN the 40-year-old was there to take part in a tournament when the shooting happened. And 34-year-old Tommy Conrad was killed at the bowling alley where he was the manager. Conrad leaves behind a nine-year-old daughter.
 
Now another victim who was killed at the bowling alley was a woman who worked there part time, 53-year-old Tricia Asselin was there on her night off with her sister who was able to run for her life when the shooting started.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOBBI NICHOLS, SISTER OF TRICIA ASSELIN, WHO WAS KILLED IN LEWISTON SHOOTING: We heard a loud noise. And I wasn't sure what it was until I heard another shot. And I knew and I seen that I couldn't see her and everybody was running. And I got caught and people trampling and running out and we just kept running. And there was shots fired outside the building after. And we just kept running and running and running. And it was dark out. There's very little lighting there. I just ran to the, as far as I could go until there was a fence. And there was some trees. And a bunch of us were just hiding behind the trees, wondering what was going on.
 
And when the cops showed up, there was all kinds of cops, tons and tons of cops and guns and rescue. And we were coming out of the woods. And we were telling the cops, don't shot. And they were telling us to keep walking and walking and walking. And I kept asking, where is my sister, where's my sister, she's in there. And I just wanted to be remised, my sister because she was in there.
 
And I didn't know she was her until like two hours later, somebody came out and said that she called 911. And when she called 911 to save everybody, she lost her life because of it. And she was a great person.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
NEWTON: A great person and she also called her sister, Tricia, a hero.
 <br>[01:14:25] Still ahead for us, the IDF announces the next phase of its war with Hamas ahead of the anticipated ground invasion of Gaza. Those details when we return.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
NEWTON: And we want to bring you up to date now on Israel's war against Hamas now nearly three weeks old. Israel announced the next phase of its military operations on Thursday saying it will conduct more limited raids into Gaza in preparation for its ground defensive. Video from the Israeli military shows a column of IDF tanks and heavy equipment during one targeted raid on Thursday.
 
The IDF said the operation was large but limited and the troops withdrew from Gaza. Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas after the group massacred more than 1,400 people in southern Israel with more than 200 others taken hostage. The IDF said an airstrike on Thursday killed a senior Hamas leader who was involved, they say, in planning the October 7th attacks.
 
Meantime E.U. leaders are appealing for safe corridors to deliver aid to Gaza where basic necessities are in short supply. Red Crescent says another 12 aid trucks entered Gaza Thursday but didn't bring any fuel, which Israel has refused to allow in. Israel says Hamas has stolen and will steal fuel to use in its rocket attacks.
 
We go now to CNN's Jim Bittermann who's live for us in Paris. It has been nearly three weeks now, Jim. And I think people are still wondering whether or not the Israeli government is, you know, on the brink of a full scale ground invasion.
 
JIM BITTERMANN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, in fact, I think here in France, there's a lot of wonder about that because in fact the French have a fair stake in what's going on. There were 35 French citizens killed in the attacks on October 7th. And there are nine French still missing, they're presumed to be among those hostages.
 <br>[01:20:10]
 
So yes, I think the French are very concerned about what's going on. We just saw President Macron make a quick trip to the Middle East, be with the key leaders in both Israel and Egypt and Jordan, and in Gaza in the Palestinian territories. And he was basically pitching a plan for A, a ceasefire, but also B, some kind of an anti-terrorist coalition.
 
He sort of used it and the nature of the anti-ISIS coalition that was put together and involve Europeans and some Arab countries. His ideas that were not met with a lot of approval by the various leaders, in fact, he didn't seem to get much traction in terms of getting this coalition together.
 
So we'll see how this develops in the coming days. But I think the French are very interested in being involved. They have sent now a ship, a Navy ship, the Tonnerre, which is really a helicopter, which is described as a hospital ship. And it's not really it's -- it does have hospital beds on about 50 or 60 hospital beds on it.
 
But it's more of a helicopter carrier. And it also provides the French with this kind of intelligence outpost because it does have some pretty sophisticated communications equipment on it, Paula.
 
NEWTON: I think at this point, and many are wondering if this kind of involvement by France will actually lead to more aid getting in to Gaza. Jim Bittermann for us, we have to leave it there. But thank you.
 
NEWTON: Colonel Cedric Leighton is a CNN military analyst. He's a retired Air Force. Colonel, good to have you with us. And good to see you again. Now, the Israelis continue to promise more of what they're calling targeted raids in the day ahead. I mean, what do they hope to accomplish in advance of this kind of an offensive?
 
COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, Paula, it's good to be with you. The big thing that they're trying to do is find out where Hamas fighters actually are. So we targeted raids, somewhat similar, I think in concept to reconnaissance in force, they're going forward. They're taking a look at what's out there. They also with targeted rates, they perhaps know a little bit more from an intelligence perspective.
 
And they're going in and they're trying to find leadership elements, perhaps tunnel entrances, other aspects of house infrastructure that they could perhaps take advantage of. And of course, they're looking for any weak points that are out there. So that's what they're doing. Of course, as they move forward with those tanks, that becomes a very critical element for these days, because what they're trying to do is they're trying to find good ways to move their forces, their armor, especially in position so that they can actually use it to for maximum effectiveness.
 
NEWTON: Yes. And it makes a good point that they do want that armored, you know, the armed personnel carriers in there, the tanks in there, and they have to find a way to go. I want to ask you, though, do you think there is a possibility that the Israeli government is reconsidering its strategy at this hour that perhaps a full ground invasion may not, in fact yield the results they want?
 
LEIGHTON: Yes, I think they are reconsidering it because there are a lot of warning signs out here, out there, Paula. Because when you're seeing the kinds of things that could happen with this maximum type of urban combat that really awaits the Israeli Defense Forces, when they enter the populated areas of Gaza, that could be a real problem. That could really pull them in into a real quagmire.
 
And that's the kind of thing that Israel should really try to avoid at all costs, they have to really play to their own strengths, as opposed to Hamas's strengths. If they went in and did a full force on force type invasion, that wouldn't really play to Hamas's strengths, because they'd be on the defensive, they wouldn't know what to expect from the Israelis. If the Israelis, on the other hand, go to a targeted type of Special Forces like incursion, then it would be much different and they would perhaps prosecute more high value targets, in other words, important people. And that would be the kind of thing that they could I think profit from on the Israeli side.
 
NEWTON: Yes, it was interesting speaking more to what you're saying that the IDF has been careful in the last 24 hours to make it clear to CNN, that, look, this is not a ground invasion, that in fact, these were targeted raids. They're being very careful themselves in terms of explaining what they're doing and saying these are not special forces that are on the ground yet.
 
And more to the point when we talk about how complicated it is on the ground. The hostage situation, of course continues to constrain every military move they'll make. Do you think U.S. pressure from the families at all is shaping military strategy at this hour?
 <br>[01:25:06]
 
LEIGHTON: I think it is. Now, some people will never admit that that's the case, Paula. But the key thing here is that the Israelis, Israeli government, in particular, they do respond to public pressure. And it would be very important for them to try to do their utmost to get the hostages back. And also to not get caught in some kind of a trap that Hamas would be setting for them both figuratively and literally in the form of booby traps, and IEDs, and things like that.
 
So it becomes really important for the Israelis to develop a more nuanced strategy. And that nuanced strategy should include something that, you know, perhaps uses the diplomatic channel, in other words, to work the hostage issue in a more coherent fashion, that would be the kind of thing that would really helped their case, and I think would make a lot of difference when it comes to the further movements on the military side.
 
NEWTON: You know, and what is so important in these situations is when you talk about nuance, I mean, I've been in Gaza, when there have been precision air strikes, what we're seeing now, it seems to me without being on the ground is completely different. What do you make of the fact that these airstrikes, they have declared quite proudly about how many they've gone in with and obviously, it continues to take a civilian toll?
 
LEIGHTON: Yes, it certainly does. And I think that's really dangerous for the Israelis from public opinion standpoint, and also from a military effectiveness standpoint. After a while, you know, you run out of targets, as some army generals say. And that actually is true, because after a certain point, especially in a very narrowly confined area like Gaza, you're going to find that you're hitting the same target over and over again.
 
Now, sometimes it's necessary to do that just from a targeting perspective. But in this particular case, when you're talking about hundreds of targets being struck every day in the 30 or so square mile area, that is, I think, really, really hard to justify. And that becomes a real problem, precision strikes are great. But over bombing the same thing and impacting civilian lives, that becomes a completely different story then.
 
NEWTON: Yes. And it does point to the fact that the end game this time around may be completely different than what we've seen in decades past. Colonel Leighton thanks so much. Really appreciate it.
 
LEIGHTON: You bet, Paula.
 
NEWTON: Now meantime, the U.S. says it has carried out airstrikes on two facilities linked to Iran and its allies in Eastern Syria. Two senior officials say the targets were used for storing weapons and ammunition in the area known as Abu Kamal. The facilities were reportedly used by Iran's Revolutionary Guard and its allied militias. The strikes came after a series of attacks on U.S. forces in the Middle East which Washington says Tehran was involved in. U.S. Defense Secretary says the overnight operation was not related to the conflict in Gaza.
 
Residents are urged to shelter in place as authorities hunt for the suspect in Wednesday's mass shooting. The latest on the search, just ahead.

PAULA NEWTON, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome back to our viewers in the United States and all around the world. I'm Paula Newton. 
 
Residents around Lewiston, Maine are being told to lock their doors and stay inside as the manhunt for the suspect in two back-to-back mass shootings continues for yet another day. At least 18 people were killed and more than a dozen others were hurt in that rampage. 
 
Several agencies are searching for suspect Robert Card. He is a certified firearms instructor and a member of the U.S. Army Reserves. Law enforcement experts say Card's training and outdoor experience are making it more difficult to locate him. 
 
At least one person, who was treated for a gunshot wound, has now been released from hospital. Families and friends of those killed in the massacre are trying to process the tragedy while mourning the loss of their loved ones. 
 
CNN's Jason Carroll has some of the victims' stories. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
GOVERNOR JANET MILLS, MAINE: This city did not deserve this terrible assault on its citizens, on its peace of mind, on its sense of security. No city does, no state, no people. 
 
JASON CARROLL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The magnitude of what happened last night coming into focus as authorities removed the bodies of some of those who perished in the shooting at the Schemengees Bar and Grill restaurant. Police say, of those who were killed, eight died at the bar, including Leroy Walker's son Joseph. His father says his son died when he tried to stop the shooter. 
 
LEROY WALKER, SON KILLED IN SHOOTING: My son actually -- he is manager of the bar and everything else -- picked up a butcher knife and went after the gunman to try to stop him from killing other people. And that is when he shot my son to death, trying to save some more lives. He ended up losing his life. 
 
CARROLL: 40-year-old Bryan MacFarlane, also identified as one of the victims -- his sister says he was deaf. He was there for a regular Wednesday night gathering of members of the deaf community and cornhole tournament. 
 
His sister who was also deaf says their loss is deeply felt from her family and the community. 
 
SISTER OF BRYAN MACFARLANE (through translator): I want people to know how big this has impacted the deaf community that, you know, we have lost four community members, not only just Bryan MacFarlane, but we have lost three other friends as well from this tragic 0incident in this community. It is a huge loss. 
 
Carroll: Minutes away from the bar, more victims and more tragedy. Police say seven were killed at Just in Time Recreation Center, a bowling alley in Lewiston, including 53-year-old Tricia Asselin. Her brother said she was calling 9-1-1 when she was killed. He told CNN she wasn't going to run. She was going to try and help. 
 
Just in Time Recreation released a statement which sums up the feelings of many in the community. "There are no words to fix this, or make it better. We are praying for everyone who has been affected by this horrific tragedy. We love you all and hold you close in our hearts."
 
An unidentified employee of Bates College was one of 13 people injured during the mass shootings. 
 <br>[01:34:47]
 
CARROLL: In a statement, Bates President says that the employee is expected to make a full recovery, adding, "No matter how many times something like this happens, I find myself at a loss for words. And this time it happened so close to come home."
 
Some of the injured are being treated at Central Maine Health Care Hospital in Lewiston. 
 
MILLS: This is a dark day for Maine. I know it's hard for us to think about healing when our hearts are broken. But I want every person in Maine to know that we will heal together. 
 
CARROLL: Jason Carroll, CNN, New York.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
NEWTON: Up next for us, Israel's volunteer first responders with the stories of some of the brave men and women who heeded the call in the Hamas attack. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) NEWTON: Let's get you up to speed on Israel's war with Hamas. The Palestinian Red Crescent says another 12 aid trucks entered Gaza on Thursday, but didn't bring in desperately-needed fuel. Gaza's health ministry which is controlled by Hamas says 12 hospitals in the area have now stopped working. 
 
Meantime, Israel says it will keep carrying out raids in Gaza like the one you see here. The IDF released video of this so-called targeted raid on Thursday, saying the goal is to lay the groundwork for an expected military ground offensive into Gaza. 
 
Al Jazeera's bureau chief in Gaza is now back on the air after his family was killed in an Israeli airstrike, that's according to his network. We do want to warn you some images you are about to see are graphic. 
 
Now this video shows journalist Wael Al-Dahdouh coming face to face with the remains of his family members at a hospital in Gaza Wednesday. Al Jazeera says 12 of them were killed while sheltering in a refugee camp and that includes his wife, teenage son, daughter and grandson. 
 
This is what the journalist said after he came back on the air. 
 <br>[01:39:53]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
WAEL AL-DAHDOUH, AL JAZEERA BUREAU CHIEF (through translator): Thank you for all of the messages of solidarity, the cause (ph), and for checking on us. The solidarity and prayers were certainly something very important for us. But we thought it was necessary to return quickly despite everything. 
 
The area's still burning as you can see, from the raids and artillery bombardments. I saw that it was my duty, despite the pain and the bleeding wounds, to return quickly and to meet you through the camera lens, and social networking sites. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NEWTON: Israel said it was targeting Hamas infrastructure at the time of the strikes. 
 
Now, United Hatzalah is Israel's volunteer rescue service ready to spring into action when alerted that at least will be help that they provide until an ambulance arrives. On October 7th, they heeded the call, but some paid the ultimate price. 
 
We want to warn you some of what you are about to hear is very disturbing. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Police, save me. There are terrorists in the city.
 
JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR: Frantic callers knew what was going on immediately. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There is an infiltration of terrorists. They shot at my car.
 
TAPPER: Caller after caller understood and pleaded for help. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I have here a gunshot injury shot in the head. I need help. I'm alone here.
 
TAPPER: It was a deliberate terrorist attack. 
 
Calls rang out in this busy Jerusalem call center at the headquarters of United Hatzalah, or United Rescue. The all-volunteer first responders group is nearly 7,000 strong across Israel. 
 
Using high tech tracking, and communications tools to reach emergencies as fast as possible. Treating patients free of charge, and getting to them quicker than say the National Ambulance Service here. 
 
ELI BEER, FOUNDER, UNITED HATZALAH: I was here at 7:15 in the morning, then sent out everyone, just go out, wear any protection gear you have, take your medical equipment with you, take your gun if you have one.
 
TAPPER: Founder, Eli Beer says the morning of October 7th, more than 1,000 team members, did just that. 
 
BEER: Everyone was out no matter if they're Jews or Arabs or Christians, they were all out saving lives. 
 
TAPPER: Videos taken by the group that day show Hatzalah volunteers who rushed into regions under attack. In the first 14 days of the war, United Hatzalah says it dispatched at least 300 response vehicles including helicopters, ambulances, and the specially equipped ambo- cycles that can weave between traffic with supplies. More than 3,000 people have been treated according to United Hatzalah. But not all of them could be saved. 
 
Two of their own were murdered that day. One, a medic with an elite unit of the Israeli army was killed in action. The other, 23-year-old Awah Darawasha (ph) was working at the Nova Music Festival as a medic. 
 
BEER: Everyone was running away. He stayed with this young girl who was bleeding, trying to stop her bleeding and said she had three or four bullets in her. He was trying to save her, and the terrorist came and caught him. They realized he was an Arab, and he was wearing this vest, with the Israeli flag on it. (INAUDIBLE) they threw him in a ditch, he was unrecognizable. And he was a beautiful young boy. 
 
TAPPER: The terrorists tortured Dr. Tarek Abu Arar, a veteran when who was driving into danger, to try to help anyone who needed it. He was ambushed by terrorist when he stopped to help what he thought was a patient in need. 
 
BEER: And when he came, he started treating people, he took out his equipment, and they captured him. And they hung him, they tied him to a pole, a light pole. And he was there for nine hours. They shot his legs, he was injured. We actually found him hours later, and thank God he is ok. 
 
TAPPER: Beer started United Hatzalah as a teenager 35 years ago. He has responded to countless scenes of horror and gore and grotesque scenes of terrorism. 
 
But he says nothing, nothing could've prepared him for what he saw in the aftermath of October 7th. 
 
BEER: I'm doing this for so many years and I've been to the worst bomb attacks and terror attacks and car accidents in my life. If you put all these attacks together for 35 years and all the gruesome stuff I saw, it comes nothing compared to one day, October 7th. The day I saw in the south of Israel. 
 
I never imagined in my life, I'll ever see -- I never imagined I could see Holocaust. I used to see the Holocaust in a museum in black and white. I saw it in color. 
 
I saw people that were torn apart to pieces, they killed, they literally wanted to torture them and humiliate their bodies. Things that I saw that I will never ever forget. I'm still smelling the smells of the flesh, of the burned flash. A lot of the victims were burned. 
 
I don't know why they did this, but they started burning people. Maybe they didn't want them to be recognized. They were going round shooting and killing people. After that just torturing their bodies. 
 <br>[01:44:51]
 
BEER: And they came back home with pictures of Jews murdered. That's why they came, they wanted to humiliate the Jews in the world. To say look what we did to the Jews. They wanted to cause another Holocaust here in Israel.

Just ahead for us, China's top diplomat is making the rounds in Washington, more on his meetings with top U.S. officials and one coming up with President Joe Biden. That is next.
 
And recovery efforts are underway after Hurricane Otis slams into Acapulco, as a powerful category 5 storm, killing more than 2 dozen people. We will have the latest on that storm. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
NEWTON: The U.S. Secretary of State and China's top diplomat are meeting in Washington as concerns continue to grow over the Israel- Hamas war expanding. Antony Blinken said he's looking forward to having quote, "constructive conversations with Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi over his 3-day visit. U.S. officials have said the two plan to discuss a range of bilateral issues. Want will also meet with national security adviser Jake Sullivan.
 
Now, the Chinese foreign minister is set as well to speak with President Joe Biden during his trip. 
 <br>[01:49:46]
 
NEWTON: CNN's Beijing bureau chief, Steven Jiang is live for us in the Chinese capital with the latest. Good to see you, Steven. 
 
I mean look, I can't even begin to articulate how many things are on the list of things that these two people should be discussing and the fact that these countries should be discussing it. 
 
STEVEN JIANG, CNN BEIJING BUREAU CHIEF: Yes, Paula. I think the list is long but probably the expectation is low which sometimes help things move along. And the key takeaway from all these meetings Wang Yi is having right now in D.C. of course, is it's increasingly likely that Chinese leader Xi Jinping is going to San Francisco next month to attend the APEC summit, and also meeting with President Biden there, because Wang Yi's trip is very much seen as hashing out the details to pave the way for his leader to visit the U.S. next month. 
 
Now this is happening right now I think for both international and domestic reasons obviously, as you mentioned with global conflicts growing and intensifying, there is this international expectation that the two superpowers, need to put a floor on their free-falling relationship because a lot of things simply cannot be done without the two sides at least seeing eye to eye somewhat. 
 
The Chinese, for example, recently vetoed a U.S.-proposed resolution at the U.N. Security Council regarding the Gaza conflict. And that's why one of the reasons why that issue remains very much deadlocked at the U.N. body.
 
But also, I think the two sides see and agree on this very narrow window they can work off, between now and early next year when the U.S. Presents election season kicks off in earnest.
 
So that is why a lot of these things are happening. The state visit by U.S. officials here to China, and also politicians, the latest being Gavin Newsom, the California governor for example, who's still here, but also of course, you know, you see tensions very much remain high with the two militaries for example releasing videos, that they say show the other side making dangerous maneuvers, putting their war planes and warships on a collision course. 
 
So I think this is the kind of dynamic we are talking about. And both sides see this opportunity right now, to somewhat stabilize, or even improve this relationship for Xi Jinping. Of course, there are also domestic reasons when he's still facing strong economic headwinds. So he needs to show this domestic audience that he is capable of managing and recalibrating international relations, especially with the U.S. But fundamentally though Paula, I think these are all considered
 
 tactical moves by analysts because fundamentally, I don't think Xi's rather dim view of the U.S. has changed. He still sees the U.S. is out there to continue (INAUDIBLE) to suppress Chinese interest. 
 
But according to him, the east is rising and the west is declining so he does see opportunities in the current world conflict. And his desire to change the world order very much hadn't changed, Paula.
 
NEWTON: Yes. That was a good curtain raiser to what's going to go on in the next few weeks, Steven that you just you gave us there. Especially given as well that they perhaps will find some common ground and the climate talks that will be upcoming in the years to come.
 
Steven Jiang for us, reporting from Beijing. Appreciate it.
 
Now, in the last few hours we learned China's former premier, Li Keqiang has died. According to Chinese state media, Li suffered a sudden heart attack early Friday morning. Li served as the China's number two leader until last November, overseeing his country's for more than a decade. He was once viewed as reform-minded contender for the country's top leadership role.
 
Japanese officials sent their condolences saying the former premier played an important role in Japan-China relations. Li was 68 years old. 
 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he can see quote "the end of the war" in his country. This comes after new American and Danish defense support measures were announced on Thursday. U.S. Secretary of State said his country's security assistance includes $150 million worth of arms and equipment. President Zelenskyy says Denmark's offering is over $500 million worth of tanks, drones and ammunition. 
 
Hurricane Otis has left its mark on the popular Mexican resort area of Acapulco, killing at least 27 people. A drone video shows the destruction the hurricane left in its wake. The storm surprised many by quickly reaching the powerful Category 5 status before making landfall, leaving little time for people to prepare. 
 
CNN's Patrick Oppmann has our report 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This can't be possible. Acapulco has been destroyed. 
 
PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Acapulco, a tourist beach town, now the scene of heartbreak and destruction. After the Category 5 Hurricane Otis barreled into southern Mexico, with sustained winds of 165 miles per hour -- building after building ripped apart. 
 <br>[01:54:44]
 
OPPMANN: Video taken from a drone showing widespread flooding. Some residents say they had no choice but to evacuate on foot. Power is disrupted for more than 300,000 people as of Thursday and food increasingly scarce. 
 
ERIC HERNANDZ, ACAPULCO RESIDENT: Looking at it now, Acapulco is a total disaster. It's not what it was before. The park was totally destroyed. The buildings, or the streets -- no, I would describe Acapulco now as a total disaster. 
 
OPPMANN: As rescue workers reached the hardest-hit areas, they reported grim news about the loss of life. 
 
ROSA ICELA RODRIGUEZ, SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SECURITY (through translator): Unfortunately we received word from the state and city governments that 27 people are dead, and four are missing. 
 
OPPMANN: Officials said they tried to work (INAUDIBLE) -- for the rapidly intensifying storm but there was not enough time for many to seek shelter, flee, or stock up on supplies. 
 
In less than 24 hours, Otis exploded from a tropical storm to a Category 5 hurricane, which can inflict catastrophic wind damage and life-threatening storm surge. 
 
Forecasters admit Otis' sudden strengthening as it traveled over uncommonly warm waters, caught them off guard. High ocean temperatures help fuel hurricanes, 2023 broke records for surface ocean heat which scientists say is one of the effects of human-caused climate change. 
 
Mexico's president is visiting the region where the storm hit, and said his country had never experienced a hurricane like Otis. 
 
ANDRES MANUEL LOPEZ OBRADOR, MEXICAN PRESIDENT: This has no precedent in this country, not only because of the way it gained strength in a short time, but also because of the magnitude of the hurricane.
 
OPPMANN: Forecasters called Otis a nightmare scenario. But it could simply be a sign of the hurricanes to come.
