KIM BRUNHUBER, CNN HOST:  Warm welcome to all of you watching us around the world. I'm Kim Brunhuber. Ahead on "CNN Newsroom." Ukrainian President Zelenskyy says more weapons and military are needed for  (inaudible) after Russia attacks with 70 missiles. 
 
Plus, the deadliest day in the West Bank in over a year with 10 Palestinian's killed by Israeli forces. Fears are growing of an escalation in violence. 
 
And in the U.S., the police brutality case in Memphis that has a nation on edge. Five police officers were fired and now charged with murder and kidnapping after the death of a man they were trying to arrest. 
 
Ukraine is making the case for more western weapons following the latest barrage of Russian missile strikes. Kyiv says dozens of drones and missiles were fired on targets across Ukraine on Thursday killing at least 11 people and leaving 11 others wounded. 
 
Ukraine says most of the missiles were shot down, but dozens of buildings and power facilities still took heavy damage from the strikes. Russian attacks came just hours after western allies agreed to send their advance tanks to Ukraine. In response, the Kremlin now accuses the west of direct involvement in the war but the Ukrainian president says Kyiv needs even more firepower. Listen to this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translation):  This evil, this Russian aggression can and should be stopped only with adequate weapons. The terrorist state will not understand anything else. Weapons on the battlefield, weapons that protect our skies. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER:  Ukraine says Russia is also stepping up its ground offensive in the east. Intense fighting is being reported in more parts of the Donetsk region. The most vicious battles around the city of Bakhmut where Russian troops have been trying to break through for months. CNN's Fred Pleitgen reports on this grueling fight. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over):  Ukraine's tanks taking aim at the invading Russians. Kyiv's forces, rallying to try to halt the massive assault on Bakhmut. The city where there are still some 6,000 civilians has become a cauldron of fire.
 
(On camera):  From this vantage point, you can both see and hear just how fierce the fighting is. You can hear impacts from heavy weapons, not just every minute, but literally every second. The Ukrainians say that the Russians are pouring a massive amount of personnel and weapons into this area because they seem to want to take Bakhmut at nearly any cost. 
 
(Voice-over):  There are plenty of regular Russian troops fighting around Bakhmut now. But the Ukrainians say, it's still the Wagner private military company that's leading the charge. With waves of fighters trying to storm Ukrainian positions both north and south of the city, as well as specialized forces like these snipers, claiming to have killed Ukrainian soldier. 
 
All I could see was a curtained window, this sniper says. The person who was paired with me saw a thermal outline and I just determined where to shoot. 
 
Wagner's boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin, often touts his malicious successes, but the cost is immense. This is a Wagner cemetery in the Krasnodar region of southern Russia. Row after row of fresh graves, a disposable force used to take just a few kilometers of land. 
 
Wagner acknowledges recruiting prisoners straight out of jail and throwing them on the battlefield with minimal training and only slim chances of survival. That same indifference shown in Russian strikes that kill and maim Ukrainian civilians every day. These folks are cleaning up after a Russian missile landed in their neighborhood near Bakhmut. 
 
We were getting heating from the heating plant which was hit, Yuri (ph) tells me. Yesterday at 3:00, it was destroyed, so now we have no electricity, no heating, we have nothing. 
 
And a few miles away, one person was killed in another densely populated area. 
 
(On camera):  Some of the long distance drones and missiles that Russia uses to attack Ukraine come down right near civilian areas. This here is only a few yards away from a kindergarten. However, others are used to directly target critical infrastructure. (Voice-over):  More than 50 missiles fired just on Thursday. And while
 
 many of them were intercepted by Ukrainian air defenses, some were not brought down adding to the daily toll of destruction.

BRUNHUBER:  So we told you that western allies have promised to send tanks to Ukraine, but some countries are moving cautiously with committing specific numbers. Salma Abdelaziz joins us from London with more. So Salma, President Zelenskyy got the tanks he wanted, but he's already asking for more. So take us through what's on Kyiv's wish list and is the west willing to fulfill it?
 
SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Absolutely. It's really a race against time now to get those tanks to the frontlines as quickly as possible. There's a few logistical issues here. These tanks are spread out across over a dozen countries. Germany has to give pre- authorization. They are the manufacturers of these Leopard 2 tanks. They have to give pre-authorization for every country to deploy those tanks. 
 
They have to provide training. That is supposed to start as soon as possible for Ukrainian soldiers in Germany. And then there's the question of compensation. How will NATO or how will Germany pay for these tanks or compensate the countries that gave these tanks to Ukraine? All of those logistics, again, being dealt with in Berlin. Take a listen to how Ukraine's defense minister responded when one reporter asked, how quickly are we going to see these tanks on the battlefield?
 
(BEGINV VIDEO CLIP) 
 
UNKNOWN:  Minister, can you get the tanks to Ukraine in time? 
 
BORIS PISTORIUS, GERMAN DEFENSE MINISTER:  I probably will. 
 
UNKNOWN:  How long will it take to get there? 
 
PISTORIUS:  At the -- at the end of the first quarter of the year. That's what we are going to do. 
 
UNKNOWN:  So how many months? Two? Three? Four? 
 
PISTORIUS:  I just said, at the end of -- at the end of March, I think. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ABDELAZIZ:  Now, the reason for this rush, the reason for this push is this counteroffensive as the weather gets warmer. There's an expectation that Russian forces will pick up the tempo of the war, try to attack Ukrainian forces. Ukraine, of course, for its part, wants to push through as described these tanks as an iron fist that will allow them to spearhead their offensive in the spring.
 
But a note of caution here, Kim. In total, we have just have over 100 tanks that have been promised. Among them are those 30 Abrams, 31 Abrams to be exact, tanks from the United States. Those could take over a year before they actually arrive in Ukraine. As you heard there, the Leopard tanks arriving sooner. But, this is a lot less than what President Zelenskyy says he needs. 
 
He was asking for over 300 tanks. And as I said, just over 100 going into Ukraine. But really, what this is about is the bigger picture here, Kim. This is about the political will of allies to provide tanks. Something that was unimaginable a year ago. So, for Kyiv, they're hoping this opens the door a little bit to ask for more of those weapons on their wish list. Kim? 
 
BRUNHUBER:  Thanks so much, Salma Abdelaziz in London. And Russia's propaganda machine is moving into high gear as the war in Ukraine nears its first anniversary. Vladimir Putin's shameless supporters in state media are making a mockery of western weapons, but not everyone is buying it and CNN's Nic Robertson reports. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over): Toothless cats, battered Abrams, he says. The Russian state media anchor points to a huge graphic alleging flaws in the NATO tanks. His purposeful propaganda playing down risk the Russian troops in Ukraine does seem to be working. 
 
Sending tanks is going to be bad for the Americans and Germans she says. 
 
We're going to win regardless, Sergei (ph) tells us. It just enlarging the conflict. If we pull out, the west will put more pressure on us. 
 
But not everyone buys the state TV hype. Putin has killed off independent media but not independence of mind. This young film student tells our team a friend was drafted and deployed but has now disappeared. And for peace, she says, it's very sad. People are dying, among the verge of tears here. 
 
I don't know if it's true or not or what's going on in this war this lady tells us. But I do know people have been killed. Some of them are friends. All emotions the Kremlin likes to prey on.  
 
Around the capital, air defense systems have been lofted atop government buildings, for less than subtle message, Russia is under threat. It's leverage Putin needs to drum up more recruits for the increasingly unpopular meat grinder, that is Ukraine's frontline trenches.
 
And more primetime Putin propaganda, Yevgeny pop-off, pops a plan for the audience. Tells them the German Leopard 2 tanks will burn very nicely.
 <br>[03:10:00]
 
Another Putin acolyte, the insanely popular Vladimir Solovyov, asked the audience, "After all this, isn't Berlin a lawful target?" 
 
Such is the stitch up in Russian media. Putin is able to spin almost any message he wants. His tv puppets serve fast and fear in equal measure. But even that is not going down so well with some. 
 
Everyone is listening to Solovyov's opinion, this lady says, but it would be good if the expert started expressing their real opinions instead of obeying orders from Putin. 
 
What's real is anyone's guess. And for some, that means tuning out. This lady tells us, she doesn't know about the tanks when we ask her opinion. 
 
I think that this is a political war and not a war for the people, this lady tells the team. What are we supposed to do, she says? Our opinions mean diddly-squat. 
 
(On camera):  Increasingly isolated from outside views and under threat of harsh retribution if they dissent, Russians are stuck in a rut, in a war they don't want with a leader they can't remove, and the threat of potential recruitment around the corner. They are doing what Russians have historically done in the face of adversity. Focusing on their own survival. Nic Robertson, CNN, London.

BRUNHUBER:  Israel has launched new airstrikes on Gaza, targeting an underground rocket manufacturing site that the Israeli say was operated by Hamas. This is part of a series of cross border attacks after what became the deadliest day for Palestinians in West Bank in more than a year. 
 
Earlier, sirens blared in Israel after several rockets were fired from Gaza. We're hearing at least one was intercepted, that's after Israeli forces launched a deadly raid on the Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank. The Palestinian health ministry says nine Palestinian's were killed, a 10th died hours later in what Israeli police called a violent disturbance. 
 
From the Israel border, police released this helmet video from the raid. An IDF spokesperson told CNN that military was responding to intelligence about an imminent attack and moved in to apprehend Islamic jihadi terrorists. Thousands of Palestinian marched in Jenin during the funerals for those killed. Palestinian authorities have since announced to halt all security cooperation with Israel. 
 
Israeli and Palestinian relations will be one of the main issues discussed when the U.S. Secretary of State visits the Middle East in the coming days. Antony Blinken is expected to discuss a range of global and regional priorities, including Russia's war on Ukraine, human rights, and Iran. On Sunday, he's scheduled to visit Egypt and will meet with the country's leader, Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, then Blinken will head to Israel and the West Bank. This will be his first trip to Israel since the far-right coalition government lead by Benjamin Netanyahu came into power. 
 
And the U.S. and Israel held their largest ever joint military drills this week, even though the Biden administration has expressed concerns about the far-right ultra nationalist members of Benjamin Netanyahu's government. CNN's Hadas Gold got exclusive access to the exercises and find out what's motivating both countries now to quickly assemble such massive military exercises. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  CNN granted exclusive access to the danger zone on the super carrier USS George H. W. Bush to see part of the largest ever American and Israeli joint military exercise, covering all aspects of warfare, from the air, on land, to the sea, online, and even in space.
 
The timing is no accident. It's meant to send a clear signal to Iran and other adversaries in the region. That despite the attention on Ukraine and U.S. concerns over the new right-wing Israeli government, the Americans remain deeply aligned and committed to a military partnership with Israel. 
 
(On camera):  For the Americans and the Israelis, these types of exercises are a show of force, a show of partnership, and a way for the both of them to show the world that they can walk and chew gum at the same time. 
 
MICHAEL KURILLA, COMMANDER, U.S. CENTRAL COMMAND:  Only through a firm commitment to this partnership are we able to plan and organize such an incredibly complex, high-end operation, with so many elements across such a large geographic area against all aspects of war fighting. Some of which are seen, some of which are not.
 
GOLD (voice-over):  For the Israelis, the exercise is crucial. They've long opposed a return to the Iranian nuclear deal and have argued that a credible military threat needs to be on the table to deter Iran from fully developing a nuclear weapon. 
 <br>[03:15:02]
 
HERZI HALEVI, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES CHIEF OF STAFF:  Israel and the U.S. share the same values, the idea and the U.S. CENTCOM see eye to eye the threats on this area. 
 
GOLD (on camera):  More than 6,400 American personnel joined 1,100 Israelis as part of these exercises that utilize more than 142 aircraft including these F-18s. 
 
(voice-over):  And while the Israelis and Americans regularly carry out joint exercises, this one shifted the focus more on the offensive rather than just defensive capabilities. It also came together in just two months, incredibly quickly especially for something of this scale compared to the typical year or so of planning. 
 
While officials shy away from drawing a direct connection between the speed and recent events in Iran, and the breakdown last year of negotiations over the nuclear deal, it is hard to ignore the context. 
 
JOE BUCCINO, U.S. CENTRAL COMMAND SPOKESPERSON:  I think it's fairly clear that we can very quickly move assets in the region to respond to crises and we can do so alongside our partners. And we can fight and conduct offensive operations in every domain alongside our partners. 
 
GOLD (voice-over):  The military option which President Biden called the last resort to deal with Iran seems to be on loud display. Hadas Gold, CNN, aboard the USS George H. W. Bush.

BRUNHUBER:  Today is International Holocaust Remembrance Day, which also marks the anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp. It's time to honor the 6 million Jews killed by the Nazis whose other victims include minorities, the disabled, and the LGBTQ+ individuals. The husband of the U.S. vice president, Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff is visiting key sites in Poland and Germany this week including Auschwitz.
 
U.S. President Joe Biden released a statement reading, quote, "As we join nations around the world in bearing witness to this dark chapter in our shared history, we also honor survivors and their stories, pledging to always remember and to keep faith with that sacred vow; never again. 
 
Taiwan has a new premier. Former Vice President Chen Chien-jen was appointed to the post by the president following the resignation last week of the previous premier and other members of his cabinet. Removed by President Tsai Ing-wen is part of a wider cabinet reshuffle following heavy election losses by her democratic progressive party last November. Taiwan is scheduled to hold its next presidential election early next year.

BRUNHUBER:  (Inaudible) a vigil Thursday night in Memphis for Tyre Nichols, nearly three weeks after he died following a violent encounter with Memphis police. Nichols had been an avid skateboarder and the vigil was held in a skate park he used to frequent. 
 
Later today, Memphis authorities are expected to release the police video of the fateful incident, and when that happens, Nichols mother pleaded for any protests be peaceful. Here she is.

ROWVAUGHN WELLS:  When that tape comes out tomorrow, it's going to be horrific. 
 
UNKNOWN:  My lord. My lord! 
 
WELLS:  I didn't see it, but from what I hear, it's going to be horrific. But I want each and every one of you to protest in peace. I don't want us burning up our cities, tearing up the streets -- 
 
UNKNOWN:  Amen! 
 
WELLS:  -- because that's not what my son stood for. 
 
UNKNOWN:  That's right.
 
WELLS:  And if you guys are here for me and Tyre, then you will protest peacefully.

BRUNHUBER:  All five officers involved have been fired and now face multiple charges, including second degree murder, aggravated assault, and aggravated kidnapping. Prosecutors spoke to CNN about the rationale behind the murder charges. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
STEVE MULROY, SHELBY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY:  First degree murder requires that we'd be able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury that the murder was intentional and premeditated. That there was an intentional and premeditated killing. And, if we don't believe in good faith of the evidence, at this point, would sustain such a charge then it's not appropriate for us to charge it. But we are comfortable charging second-degree murder which under Tennessee law requires evidence of a knowing thought (ph).

BRUNHUBER:  CNN's Shimon Prokupecz is in Memphis and has the latest. And we just want to warn, you some images in this report may be disturbing.

DAVID B. RAUSCH, DIRECTOR, TENNESSEE BUREAI OF INVESTIGATION:  We continue to pursue every lead, justice demands it. And our agency exist so that guilt shall not escape nor innocence suffer. 
 
SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT (voice- over):  The law enforcement official in charge of the Tyre Nichols investigation say he was sickened by what he saw police officers do to the 29-year-old. 
 
STEVE MULROY, SHELBY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY:  We all want the same thing. We want justice for Tyre Nichols. 
 
PROKUPECZ (voice-over):  Shelby County district attorney charged Demetrius Haley, Desmond Mills, Emmitt Martin, Justin Smith, Tadarrius Bean with second degree murder, aggravated assault, and kidnapping among several other charges. The lawyers for two of the former officers who were all fired last week say they still don't have the details about what happened. 
 
WILLIAM MASSEY, DEFENSE ATTORNEY FOR EMMITT MARTIN:  We do not have those covered. And we've not seen the video. So, we're kind of in the blind right now, and this process has just started. 
 
UNKNOWN:  We got one male, black running.
 
UKNOWN:  Set up perimeter. 
 
PROKUPECZ (voice-over):  Memphis police say Nichols was pulled over on January 7th for reckless driving. 
 
UNKNOWN:  You know (inaudible) car pulled over at the (inaudible). We have one running on foot.
 
UKNOWN:  Run that tag and see what's the address.
 
PROKUPECZ (voice-over):  Police say a confrontation occurred. And after using pepper spray, Nichols fled the scene on foot. 
 
MULROY:  There was another altercation at a nearby location, which the serious injuries were experienced by Mr. Nichols. After some period of time of waiting around afterwards, he was taken away by an ambulance. 
 
PROKUPECZ (voice-over):  Nichols died of his injuries three days later. 
 
CERELYN DAVIS, CHIEF, MEMPHIS POLICE DEPARTMENT:  This incident was heinous, reckless and inhumane. 
 
PROKUPECZ (voice-over):  The five officers involved in the beating were fired after an internal investigation found they violated multiple department policies, including the use of excessive force and failing to render aid. Two EMT's with the Memphis Fire Department were also put on leave. And additional officers are under investigation. 
 
RODNEY WELLS, TYRE NICHOL'S STEPFATHER:  No father, mother should have to witness what I saw today. 
 
PROKUPECZ (voice-over):  The Nichol's family has viewed video of the incident, which has been described as brutal and heinous. And, prosecutors plan to release it publicly Friday night with the hopes of easing tensions. 
 
RAUSCH:  We are here to pursue truth and justice, realizing that we should not be here. Simply put, this shouldn't have happened. I've been policing for more than 30 years. I've devoted my life to this profession. And I'm grieved. Frankly, I'm shocked. PROKUPECZ (on camera):  We're now waiting for the next steps in this case. Obviously, it would be the arraignment. The officers have spent most of the day after being charged in jail waiting to get bonds. We're told two of those officers did bond out. They are now out with bond. And three other officers still remain in jail. 
 <br>[03:24:58]
 
They are expected to make bond. And then the next steps will be the arraignment for these officers. They have to be arraigned on the indictment and that could come next week. And then finally next week, really the emotional part of this, the funeral is expected next week. Shimon Prokupecz, CNN, Memphis Tennessee.

BRUNHUBER:  As more details emerge in the circumstances surrounding Nichol's death, top political leaders are weighing in. Tennessee's governor tweeted, "This message, calling out the alleged police behavior as a, quote, cruel, criminal abuse of power." He called on the Memphis police to take a hard look at the misconduct and failure. 
 
And at the White House, U.S. President Joe Biden said in a statement, "Tyre's death is a painful reminder that we must do more to ensure that our criminal justice system lives up to the promise of fair and impartial justice, equal treatment and dignity for all. 
 
The last hour, I spoke about this disturbing case with retired Los Angeles Police Sergeant Cheryl Dorsey, and I asked her to explain the mindset of officers who is specialized in police units as some of these, I mean, had been, when they engage someone like Nichols. Listen to what she said.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHERYL DORSEY, RETIRED LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT:  When you work in specialized units like that and I have in operation South Bureau Crash (ph), you tend to have free rein. And if you don't know have the right temperament and the experience and the skill set, you find yourself being extra aggressive. These are officers who I like to refer to as elephant hunters. 
 
They are the ones that go out and proactive, they get involved in what we call pretext stops. And it sound like this may have been something like that. A reckless driving, which is just an infraction. And then it can hopefully lead to maybe finding someone that has drugs or gun, or in a  stolen vehicle. 
 
And when you have someone who runs, officers routinely, some will punish you at the end of a foot pursuit. And that's what happened with Mr. Nichols. 
 
BRUNHUBER:  Well, I mean, your reference about the previous incidence when in those incidence the police officers accused were generally white. I mean, these officers involved are all African-American. So race won't be the factor. It's been in other similar cases. So, how do you think that will play into how this is perceived and how it's dealt with? 
 
DORSEY:  Well, you know, I don't think race, in my opinion, ever really plays a part. I think in all instances, there are officers who are drunk with power and it's just that most of these departments have so few black that we don't see them out working patrols. We don't see them engage in this kind of outrageous and egregious behavior. It's mostly male whites. Every now and then we'll see a female involved. But, it's just officers who are drunk with power.
 
One of the officers reportedly have been previously sued for some excessive use of force. Clearly, he didn't learn a lesson. He live to the (inaudible) again. And so unless and until there's substantive accountability, we're going to continue to have these officers who are hotdogs, that are hard charges who kick butt and take name on the specialized unit involved in this kind of activity across these 18,000 police departments in the U.S.

The Chinese consulate in San Francisco now confirms that five of the seven people killed on Monday in Half Moon Bay, California were Chinese citizens. The statement condemning the mass shooting, the consulate said they contacted most of the victims families' and was offering assistance. 
 
According to NBC News, the alleged gunman, 66-years-old Chinese citizen, confessed to the crime in a jail house interview and said he didn't know what came over him mentally. Authorities believe he acted alone and described the attack as a workplace violence incident.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
KIM BRUNHUBER, CNN ANCHOR:  Welcome back. I'm Kim Brunhuber. This is "CNN Newsroom." U.S. military has killed a senior ISIS leader and 10 members of the terror group in operation in Somalia. The Biden administration says Bilal al-Sudani helped fund the network of ISIS affiliates around the world, including Afghanistan.
 
CNN's David McKenzie is following developments from Johannesburg. So, David, what more do we know about this operation?
 
DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN SENIOR INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Kim, what we know is from U.S. officials that described as early morning helicopter ride with commandoes into the northern section of Somalia, what is known as Puntland.
 
And I think that nature of this actual operation shows how seriously they took Bilal al-Sudani as a senior member of ISIS. The name isn't well known as maybe some other leadership is ISIS. You see some of the details of this operation here.
 
But given that it was a commando raid, not an air strike of some kind, tells me that they took this very seriously, would have been planned for a significant amount of time and would have genuinely needed to have President Biden's go ahead for final execution.
 
Now, they say, the U.S. officials that they were willing to take al- Sudani alive but that they met resistance. Himself and several other ISIS members in the northern part of Somalia were killed in this operation. No I.S. soldiers were injured except for one by one of the service dogs and they said that there were no civilians involved in this attack.
 
But it is a significant sign that the Biden administration is looking to take on financiers and those involved in the raising of money and logistics of ISIS in the Africa region and beyond. Kim?
 
BRUHUBER:  And so, David, then let's take a wider look at the current state of the ISIS network. So, how strong is it these days and what countries are still seen as safe heavens for terrorists?
 
MCKENZIE:  Well, let's focus on the Africa region and start with Somalia. In fact, ISIS Somalia is not a very substantial group in the northern part of that country.  It's unclear to me whether at this stage this group was directly ISIS Somalia or they were sheltering as it were in that ungoverned space of Puntland where they were targeted.
 
Overall in Africa, ISIS is operating either semi-directly or with ties to multiple groups across the West Africa (inaudible), parts of Southern Africa and Northern Mozambique where we travel to recently. There are also, of course, Al Qaeda linked groups across the continent with a variety in terms of ISIS level of direct linkages with ISIS Central.
 
What is interesting though, the last time I saw this name, al-Sudani, was when there was a treasury notice late last year designated a group of South Africans in fact as being an ISIS involved in financing and recruiting for the terror network.
 <br>[03:35:02]
 
So, it does appear that they're going after the money trail both here on the continent and in other parts of the world to try squeeze out the financing and logistics of ISIS after they, obviously, lost their caliphate in very dramatic fashion some years ago. Kim?
 
BRUNHUBER:  Interesting. I appreciate the context there. David McKenzie in Johannesburg.

TOM KABU, BROTHER OF ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES FLIGHT 302 VICTIM:  We are put in a position whereby there was no other choice but death by those who didn't knew and continued after the Lion Air crash. They continued to conceal the safety issues and the defect for profit.
 
MADOWO (on-camera):  You lost your brother in Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302. You're also lawyer in Kenya. So, you know the law.
 
KABU:  Yes.
 
MADOWO (on-camera):  Who do you hold responsible for his death?
 
KABU:  I hold responsible the Boeing corporation and in particular the senior executives who made the decisions for that.
 
MADOWO (on-camera):  To be clear, you want the senior executives who are in charge of Boeing at that time to go to jail?
 
KABU:  Certainly. And that will be a very important milestone not only for accountability for the deaths directly it caused but also the good of the safety.
 
MADOWO (voice-over):  These family members feel that the settlement that the Trump Justice Department arrived at with Boeing shields the company and that should be thrown out. They also especially take issue with what they feel as the Boeing narrative after the Lion Air crash in Indonesia and the Ethiopian Airlines crash that appear to blame it to pilot error.  These were third world pilots who didn't know how to operate these aircraft. These family members say Boeing deliberately manufactured a defective aircraft and should pay for that. People should go to jail, they tell me.

BRUNHUBER:  The health ministry in Malawi says a cholera outbreak has left more than a thousand people dead in less than a year. More than 31,000 cholera cases have been reported across the Southeast African country. The situation isn't as deadly in Kenya but still critical where the World Health Organization says people who have fled drought and conflict in sought refuge in Kenya have pushed the death toll from the cholera outbreak there to 79. There have been more than 4,000 cases reported in Kenya since the outbreak began in October.
 
Earlier, I spoke with Dr. Sam Kariuki, the acting director general of the Kenyan Medical Research Institute, and I asked him what's missing from the government response to the cholera outbreak across the region. Here's what he said.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SAM KARUIKI, ACTING DIRECTOR GENERAL, KENYAN MEDICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE:  We have vulnerable populations, those that have been displaced in refugee camps. Again, sometimes with the limited supplies of clean water due to challenges of, you know, displaced populations in very, very large numbers.
 
And they think government do need to put in place measures that prevent these from happening.  Obviously, it's going to take time to improve water sanitation and hygiene infrastructure, but we also have what we call very low lying fruits (ph) that can go ahead and prevent this. [03:40:06]
 
For example, having populations that are most vulnerable having the vaccine, the oral cholera vaccine and that prevents cholera at least for a year or two.

BRUNHUBER:  The WHO the vaccination campaign is expected to start early next month with more than two million doses of oral cholera vaccines being shipped to Kenya.

BRUHUBER:  India has banned the BBC documentary critical of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and now is taking action against students who planned to go ahead with the screening of the film.
 
CNN's Anna Coren tells us how the government is cracking down on what it describes as propaganda.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANNA COREN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Police in India have detained at least a dozen university students over attempts to screen a banned BBC documentary critical of the country's prime minister, Narendra Modi. The two-part documentary, "India, The Modi Question," looks at Modi's alleged role into the deadly 2002 Gujarat riots, that claimed more than a thousand lives, mostly Muslim, when he was the states chief minister.
 
Last week, the government blocked the documentary from airing in India after enforced emergency powers under the country's New Information and Technology Act that allows it to suppress any information that appears online. Both YouTube and Twitter have complied with the order.
 
The government has called the documentary a propaganda piece designed to push a particular discredited narrative. The BBC responded, stating the documentary was, quote, "rigorously researched according to the highest editorial standards."
 
Students at two prominent universities in New Delhi this week tried to screen the documentary, but we're faced with power cuts and an Internet shutdown according to student leaders. Police then detained 13 students, saying, they need to ensure peace in the area.
 
SANAM HUSSAIN, STUDENT (through translator):  Stopping the screening of the film and then attacking the students in such a manner, this is a violation of all kinds of, you know, democratic fundamental rights of every citizens of this country. COREN:  Critics of the ban have expressed dismay at what they view as censorship by the Indian government. The committee to protect journalists also weighed in, saying this was an attack on the free press that flagrantly contradicts the country stated commitment to democratic ideals.
 <br>[03:44:53]
 
The BBC documentary explores an unpublished British government report that reveals the violence in Gujarat back in 2002 had all the hallmarks of an ethnic cleansing, claiming there was widespread and systemic rape of Muslim women.
 
Modi has denied accusations that he failed to stop the violence. And in 2012, a Supreme Court appointed this special investigation team, found there was no evidence to suggest Modi was to blame.

BRUNHUBER:  After decades on the run, mafia boss, Mateo Messina Denaro, is awaiting trial in a maximum security prison in Italy, but there are questions about how he was able to live so long in relative freedom despite being one of Europe's most wanted men.
 
We're joined now by Barbie Nadeau in Rome. So, Barbie, a fascinating case in so many ways. What more we learning?
 
BARBIE NADEAU, CNN CONTRIBUTOR (on camera):  Well, you know, as investigators are trying to interrogate him while he's in prison, they're also trying to unravel his life. They found three hideouts so far and they've given us a look at what they found inside.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
(voice-over):  Infamous mafia boss, Matteo Messina Denaro's, arrest has taken Italy storm. Every detail of his life in hiding for the last 30 years, scrutinized to the nth degree. He may have been hiding from the law, but he certainly wasn't hidden away.
 
Moments before his arrest on January 16, Messina Denaro can be seen in police video walking freely and alone into a private health care clinic in Palermo. Raids of three of 60-year-olds hideouts have turned up a collection of high-end sunglasses and other luxury goods.
 
Journalists Roberto Saviano has been living under police protection since 2006 when he wrote his book about the mafia, "Gomorrah." Authorities say that they also found a collection of movie memorabilia, including posters from the "Joker" and the "Godfather."
 
Saviano tells us that the "Godfather" movie is fundamental in the formation of Mafiosi. They see themselves in the portrayal of the inner conflicts, they live the same realities.
 
But he also knows that the fact that Messina Denaro wasn't handcuffed after his arrest sends a message.
 
Carabinieri wants to show the boss is totally collaborative, he tells us.
 
Messina Denaro chose not to attended first court date last week, which is right under Italian law. His next court date is March 9th for the deadly bombings of two anti-mafia judges in Sicily in 1992.
 
Prior to his arrest, the last time Messina Denaro was thought to have seen in public was a 1993. But it is becoming clear that he led an open life in the small town in Sicily where some of his alleged hideouts were found. And that the Omerta, the code of silence that protects Mafiosi also protected him.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
(on camera):  And you know, Kim, when you look at that, you know, the "Godfather," "Joker," all of that sort of stuff, is sort of art imitating life, life imitating art. But authorities aren't just focused on the stuff. They're trying to understand who's in charge now. The mafia still exists. It's still powerful, not as powerful perhaps was 30 years ago, but they want to know who's in charge and who's giving orders now, Kim. That is the priority, not necessarily all the movie posters and what they might mean.
 
BRUNHUBER:  Yeah. Exactly.  All right. Thanks so much, Barbie Nadeau. I appreciate it.

Freestyle skier, Eileen Gu, took the world by storm at last year's Winter Olympic games. The California born teenager who competes for China won three medals in Beijing. But believe it or not, it's not her only day job. The 19-year-old shares her remarkable and hectic life story with CNN's Coy Wire.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
(VIDEO PLAYING)
 
EILEEN GU, FREESTYLE SKIER:  After 11 and a half months out of the competition scene, it was so much fun to get back on the snow, take two wins in Calgary this past. Being away from snow just made me realized how much I miss it, how much I love it, how truly passionate about it I am, and I'm so lucky to get to do what I do for a living.
 
COY WIRE, CNN SPORTS:  Some say balance is one of the keys to a great life. You're a stellar student attending Stanford, a pro athlete, and a model. What's the secret?
 
GU: I'm really just very passionate about what I do. I'm so lucky that I get to ski, go to school, do to fashion. They're such different, I guess, life paths. But at the same time, they all really relate to one another. For example, in school, what I'm learning in psychology, what I'm learning about how to learn and how to play your work ethic to different kinds of difficult tasks, I really apply that to my skiing.
 
But then in skiing, I feel like I'm creative and I'm very expressive. And I really bring that to the fashion industry. And then, from fashion, I feel like I'm really putting myself out there. I'm learning about resilience and I'm learning about confidence. And I can apply that into my school.
 
So, it all goes in a circle. I guess, it's really connected. And, at the end of the day, I don't get tired of what I do because I'm just jumping from one thing to the next. And it's always new, it's always refreshing. So, I guess that's the secret. 
 
WIRE:  You have an unrelenting work ethic. What does one of your more demanding days look like scheduled wise? 
 
GU:  Let see, in Calgary, just recently I woke up at 8.00 a.m., 7.30 in the morning, got up, and put on my skis stuff on, went to the hill and competed in the qualifiers for the World Cup, qualified first, drove back, sat down, wrote two essays, did a Dick Heart (ph) and Berkeley (ph) philosophy reading, did some physics, and put all my ski stuff on, went back to the hill, competed in the World Cup final that evening at 6.00 p.m., won that, came back, proofread my essay because the way that I write I'd like to do my writing, finish, let it marinate for a little bit, and then come back, re-read it, and then turn it in. So, I came back, re-read my essay, turned it in, called it a night 10.00 p.m. and hit the hay. 
 
WIRE:  I'm sweating. I'm stressed. I'm tired just thinking about it. Outstanding. And don't tell me you were doing a little date card. I think, therefore, I am.
 
GU:  There you go. There you go. See, two Stanfords. We know each other.
 <br>[03:55:00]
 
WIRE:  I'm sure we took the same class. I'm sure. Now, excellence can't be achieved though without sacrifice. What are some of the things you've sacrificed to make your dreams a reality? 
 
Gu:  I guess that's a hard question because I'm very optimistic and I like to think that everything I do I actively choose to do it, and it enriches my life every day. But I guess the hardest part, really, is just not being in the same time zone, traveling so constantly, not being with my friends when I'm away, missing my cats and my grandma. But, I think that those are all things that, when I'm away I miss them so that when I'm back I really just make that much more effort to be present and to be caught up with them and to be as active as a friend and family members I could be.
 
WIRE:  Yes. Living in the meow is very important.
 
GU:  That's right.

BRUNHUBER:  Yeah. What a great story. All right. Now, this video might make you feel a little dizzy. Have a look at this. Brazilian highliner, Rafael Bridi, has broken the record for the longest crossing of an urban area in any of the Americas on a slack line suspended 114 meters above the streak of Sao Paulo where he walked for 25 minutes between two skyscrapers. No thank you. The 35-year-old nail-biting trip stretched 510 meters from first step to last. And this isn't the first record. Two years ago, he walked between 2 hot air balloons.
