PAULA NEWTON, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Hello and a warm welcome to our viewers here in the United States and all around the world. I'm Paula Newton. 
 
Ahead here on "CNN NEWSROOM," millions of Americans starting their weekend off under heat alerts. We'll tell you when people could see some relief. 
 
Plus, Donald Trump saying it would be dangerous if he were sent to prison. This as a date is finally set for one of the trials he faces.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over): Live from CNN Center, this is CNN NEWSROOM with Paula Newton.
 
NEWTON: We begin this hour with the extreme weather situation that just will not quit. More than 80 million Americans are still under some sort of heat alert at this hour with no major relief in sight. 
 
High temperatures of 114 to 120 degrees are expected in southern California and across into Texas on Saturday. El Paso, Texas, topped 100 degrees Friday afternoon for the 36th straight day. The old record was 23 days of triple-digit temperatures. Yet there is no sign this streak will end anytime soon. The scorching
 
 weather has caused four deaths this month in one Texas county alone. Officials say two of the victims were in their homes with no functioning air conditioning. 
 
The U.S. Weather Service warns the elderly and those who work outside during extreme temperatures are especially susceptible to heat-related illnesses. 
 
(WEATHER REPORT) 
 <br>[05:05:00]
 
NEWTON: The extreme weather isn't limited to the United States. Greece is also bracing for another round of scorching heat with temperatures expected to soar as high as 113 Fahrenheit, 45 degrees Celsius, for the next two days. Greek authorities have ordered all archaeological sites, including the Acropolis, to close in the afternoons all weekend long. 
 
In Italy, 19 major cities on red alert due to the intense heat as the northern regions clean up from a wave of violent hailstorms that injured more than 100. 
 
Crews in Western India are searching for survivors after heavy rains triggered a landslide that killed at least 22 people. And sweltering temperatures and rising floodwaters are wreaking havoc across much of China. The country's weather service has issued heavy rain warnings for eight provinces. 
 
Now a date now has been set for the highly anticipated trial of Donald Trump's classified documents case. A judge on Friday scheduled the proceedings to start in May 2024, deep into the U.S. presidential election campaign. 
 
Earlier Trump, the leading Republican candidate, said it would be, quote, "very dangerous" if he's sent to prison for mishandling top- secret documents. Listen. 
 
(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) 
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: It is a dangerous thing to talk about. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK.
 
TRUMP: Because we do have a tremendously passionate group of voters -- and I mean maybe 100, 150 -- I've never seen anything like it. Much more passion than they had in 2020, much more passion than they had in 2016. I think it would be very dangerous. 
 
(END AUDIO CLIP) 
 
NEWTON: Trump also says he's been invited to appear before a grand jury investigating the 2020 election but his lawyer says he doesn't need to make an appearance. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOHN LAURO, FOUNDER, LAURO FIRM: There's no need to appear in front of any grand jury right now. President Trump did absolutely nothing wrong. He's done nothing criminal. And he's made his case that he was entitled to take these positions as president of the United States.
 
When he saw all of these election discrepancies and irregularities going on, he did what any president was required to do.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
NEWTON: The judge rejected a request from Trump to start the documents case after the election and another request from the government to begin the hearings in December. CNN's Paula Reid has our details. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PAULA REID, CNN SENIOR LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: The central conflict in this case between the two sides is about timing and when the case should go before a jury. 
 
Defense attorneys argue, that it would, quote, "unfair" to put it on before the election. They say it is unusual and too early to set a date. 
 
The prosecutors wanted a date of December. They argued it doesn't matter if he's running for the White House again, he should be treated like any other busy and important person. 
 
The judge split the difference. She put down a date of May 2024. She also included a detailed schedule, all the things that need to happen between now and when it goes to trial. 
 
It is easy to see if a few of those hearings and filings get pushed back, you could see how it could get pushed to the end of 2024 or 2025. The Trump team is happy with this. They're confident they'll get to push this back after the election. 
 
This case is likely, every expert I talk to, says it is more like likely than not this will be delayed, possibly delayed after the 2024 election -- Paula Reid, CNN, Washington.

NEWTON: The White House announced that several tech giants have agreed to put a guardrail on artificial intelligence. Microsoft, Google and Meta committed to clearly labeling AI generated content and to put new AI systems through outside testing before they are released publicly. 
 
Mr. Biden met with senior executives from seven companies. Congress and the White House are trying to develop regulations for the rapidly growing industry. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: In the weeks ahead, I'm going to continue to take executive action to help America lead the way toward responsible innovation. And we're going to work with both parties to develop appropriate legislation and regulation.

NEWTON: Team USA got over its opening day jitters with an easy win over Vietnam, 3-0. The game ended several hours ago in Auckland. It was a one-sided affair with the U.S. dominating and taking 28 shots on goal. Vietnam had none. It had little choice but to play defense and try and just keep that score down. 
 <br>[05:10:00]
 
NEWTON: CNN's Angus Watson joins me live from Sydney where much of the tournament is going to be played. 
 
I'm tempted to ask what's going on behind you. But before that, this game followed the script, right?
 
ANGUS WATSON, CNN PRODUCER: It did. And it excited the fans here in Sydney, in downtown at this live fan zone, where people have gathered all day to watch the games. Team USA and Vietnam fans were in full voice earlier. 
 
Because, although Team USA did put a great foot forward into the -- you know, putting down three goals, scoring three ahead of the next few games that are going to be tougher against the Netherlands and against the other champion teams that they're going to have to come up and play, the Vietnamese, too, put in a great defensive effort. 
 
They could have -- the Team USA could have scored more than the three that they did. The Vietnamese goalie, Kim Tan, saved a penalty from Alex Morgan. Of course, the U.S. gets the three points with the goals, two from Sophia Smith, one from Lindsey Horan in the second half. 
 
All teams on high alert watching Team USA to see what they're up against as the tournament goes on. Paula.
 
NEWTON: All right. Lucky man there for all of it. Thank you so much, Angus Watson for us in Sydney. Thank you. 
 
We'll have much more on this and the matches ahead when we are joined by "WORLD SPORT's" Carolyn Manno. 
 
Ukraine's president has a message for Moscow after this week's devastating strikes on Odessa. But Russia is trying to make a point of its own with firepower on the Black Sea. We'll explain. 
 
Also ahead, a horrifying discovery along the U.S.-Mexico border. The shocking details when we come back. 
 
Plus, a possible changing of the guard in Spain after years of center left politics. Conservatives are well positioned to win Sunday's parliamentary election. A live report next. (MUSIC PLAYING)
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

NEWTON: We are getting reports that at least six people are dead after a new wave of Russian strikes in Ukraine. Officials say Russian troops targeted the Donetsk region and other parts of Ukraine, leaving eight more people wounded. 
 
Meantime, Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Russia will pay for its back-to-back strikes on Odessa this week. Ukraine says 21 people were wounded in the attacks that targeted crucial grain infrastructure. 
 
Moscow is raising the stakes, conducting live fire drills in the Black Sea on Friday. Russia quit the grain deal this week and later said any cargo ship heading to Ukraine can be considered a carrier of military equipment. We have developments from London. 
 
Nada, thanks for the update as again we have more breaking news from Ukraine. Russia hit hard in Eastern Ukraine. 
 
What are you learning?
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT: New details from Ukrainian military officials following a spate of attacks, six people killed, eight others wounded. Among the death toll, at least two children reportedly killed in a Russian missile strike. 
 
And this comes, of course, as Russia doubles down on its bombardment of Ukraine. We've seen an increase in the bombardments from the eastern front line regions. We heard from Russian-backed military officials in the northeast Luhansk region. 
 
They say that they have Ukraine on the back foot. Of course we have also heard from Ukrainian regional military officials in the northeast, who have said that while the situation there is complicated, it remains under control. 
 
Now, of course, this comes as Ukraine continues to push ahead with its counteroffensive. And we heard from President Zelenskyy, acknowledging that counteroffensive is not going as quickly as some would have anticipated or hoped. 
 
He said that is the result of the counteroffensive not getting underway as soon as had initially been planned in the spring because of a lack of armament, ammunition and adequate training. And did say he believes Ukraine is still making progress on the front lines as the bombardment by Russian forces continues to intensify. 
 
NEWTON: In the south there are tense nights that continue in Odessa. Ukraine's defenses have been no match so far. What's the ongoing risk here, though, of escalation, especially from
 
 what we're hearing about what's going on in the Black Sea?
 
BASHIR: Well, look, we have seen night after night of bombardment of Odessa. This comes as Russia has withdrawn from the Black Sea grain initiative deal. As you mentioned earlier, Russia has said, the Kremlin has said that only ships leaving, vessels leaving these port cities could be considered carrying ammunition. 
 
Russia pulling out, not participating in the joint inspections by both Ukrainian and Russian delegations that would have taken place under the framework. There is a real concern that we could see a stepping up of this bombardment of the ports as we did last summer ahead of the signing of the deal. 
 
Listen to this message from President Zelenskyy yesterday. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): In total, since the beginning of the week, more than 20 people, including two children, had been affected by Russian terror in the Odessa region alone. Only absolute evil can inflict such strikes. There will be a response. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) BASHIR: Now there is a real pressure coming from the international community on this. We've heard from both the U.N. and, of course, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, speaking about Russia's withdrawal from the Black Sea grain deal. 
 
President Erdogan says he remains committed to mediating some sort of revival of that deal. He remains in communication with President Zelenskyy. They spoke on Friday and also has expressed hope, according to Turkish state media, of communication with Vladimir Putin. We heard from the Russian deputy foreign minister. 
 <br>[05:20:00]
 
BASHIR: He said that President Putin will continue contact on this topic with President Erdogan. Of course, the stakes here are high. We've heard from the U.N., warning that there are millions relying on grain exports from Ukraine. 
 
As we continue to see Russia bombarding and shelling these regions, there is a real concern that we could see yet another global food security crisis on our hands. 
 
NEWTON: Yes, which is why hopefully those talks between Turkiye and Russia will be substantive. Nada Bashir reporting from London, thank you so much. 
 
North Korea is said to have fired multiple cruise missiles toward the sea in the latest show of force against the South and the United States. South Korea's military says the missiles were launched early in the morning off the western coast of the Korean Peninsula. It's the second time this week that Pyongyang has conducted a weapons
 
 test and it comes after a nuclear-capable U.S. submarine made a port call in South Korea, a move that the North criticized as crossing a red line. 
 
An anonymous social media tip led a group of volunteers in Mexico to a horrifying scene. The government there says more than 100 people have gone missing in the last six decades -- pardon me; that's 100,000 people that have gone missing in the last six decades. 
 
This latest discovery along the border is startling. CNN's Rafael Romo has the disturbing details. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It's not only the shocking fact that it was 28 bodies altogether that were found in clandestine mass graves. What's also raising eyebrows is how the bodies were found in Tamaulipas, a Mexican state that borders with Texas.
 
The discovery was made by a group of civilians dedicated to finding missing people in Mexico. The group called Love for the Missing and Tamaulipas Collective says they made the discovery after receiving an anonymous tip through its Facebook page. 
 
The mass graves were located on a private property in the city of Reynosa near the Texas border town of Hidalgo.
 
The Mexican attorney general's office announced originally that it was 27 bodies, later adding one more victim to the count. It has launched an investigation. And while forensic experts are working to identify the bodies as horrible and gruesome as it sounds, the Mexican state of Tamaulipas has a long history of cartel violence.
 
As you may remember, this is the same state where four Americans were kidnapped at gunpoint then marched with two of them dying in the attack. Several mass graves have also been found in the border state over the years.
 
In 2010, 72 migrants from Central and South America were massacred by a cartel in San Fernando a few hours from Tamaulipas border. It's not unusual for relatives and friends of those missing to take matters into their own hands and try to find their loved ones by themselves because many feel authorities aren't doing enough.
 
According to the government figures, more than 111,000 people have gone missing in the country in the last six decades -- Rafael Romo, CNN, Atlanta.

NEWTON: Spain has become the latest European country to swing to the Right. Voters will start heading to the polls in less than 24 hours to choose their next government. The opinion polls show the conservative Popular Party is poised to win the most seats. Socialist prime minister Pedro Sanchez called snap parliamentary
 
 elections after the coalition of his party and left-wing partners suffered big losses in May's regional and local elections. But whoever wins will likely need, of course, to form a coalition government in order to govern. 
 
Journalist Al Goodman joins me from Madrid. 
 
Good to see you. You are a veteran of these campaigns. And I ask you, want to get your insights, this could be a watershed moment for Spanish politics.
 
What did we learn from the campaign in terms of what Spanish voters want from those right-wing parties?
 
AL GOODMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Paula. We certainly saw during the two-week campaign that the leader of the far right party said repeatedly that any eventual support for the main conservative party which he used to be part of, any support for the main conservatives would not come for free, would be with a price, his agenda. 
 
Now the campaign ended just hours ago, late Friday night. Today is what Spain calls a day of reflection. 
 
If it plays out as the polls are saying and the conservatives need the far right to form a government, that would be the first time that the far right is in a government in Spain since the dictatorship of Francisco Franco, which ended when he died nearly 50 years ago. 
 
Now Europe is certainly watching because the far right has been making gains right across Europe. They're governing in Italy with prime minister Meloni. In Finland they've entered the government. 
 
In Sweden the government need the far right for votes in parliament. The European Commission president here in Madrid earlier this month said the European Union needs to do a better job to keep extremism at bay. 
 <br>[05:25:00]
 
GOODMAN: And Spaniards during this campaign have seen how this is playing out because the local elections swept out socialist mayors and socialist regional presidents. And in their place, the main conservative party needing help from Vox. 
 
So we see that happening in more than 100 town halls and city halls and also in some regional governments. Throughout all of those, Vox has been pushing its anti-immigrant, anti-feminist, skeptical about climate change, that's their agenda. And that's what they're getting seats on in and power in these local places. 
 
But voters can see that. There's another possibilities that the socialist prime minister will make a rebound. He ended on a high note on Friday, saying he's got a chance to turn this around with a coalition of smaller leftist parties, including Sumar, which his deputy prime minister has led. So that's another possibility. He has been saying that he wants the country to go forward, not
 
 backward to the conservative policies. The economy is looking good in the macro terms. The inflation is down, employment is up. 
 
But even the socialist admits that the -- many of the average Spaniards are not feeling that in their pocketbooks right at home. So the vote begins with 37 million Spaniards ready to go to the polls on Sunday. And it's the first time these elections have been held in Spain at the height of the tourist season. There's a lot of unknowns coming up. Paula.
 
NEWTON: Absolutely. You certainly sketched it out as we continue to see if, you know, the results are borne out by those polls. Al Goodman, appreciate it.

NEWTON: Welcome back to our viewers here in the United States and all around the world. I'm Paula Newton. This is CNN NEWSROOM. 
 
A new search warrant in the Gilgo Beach murders case is revealing potential trophies allegedly kept by suspect Rex Heuermann. Now he's charged in the deaths of three women, whose remains were found on Long Island's Gilgo Beach in 2010. 
 
According to the "Chester News and Reporter" which has seen the warrant, the trophies include victims' photos, Bibles and even a specific type of Bounty paper towel. Meantime, Heuermann's neighbors are speaking out about him and reacting to news that some of the murders may have been committed in his home. 
 
Jean Casarez has our report. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JEAN CASAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Crime scene investigators continue to process the scene at defendant Rex Heuermann's home on Long Island. 
 
The murders of the three victims may have occurred in 2008 and 2009 but investigators continue their pursuit to find any evidence that can help prosecutors in the upcoming trial. Neighbors in the area still stand in disbelief. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The guy was odd and strange but never violent.
 
CASAREZ (voice-over): Neighbors of suspected serial killer Rex Heuermann speaking out about his past behavior.
 
One telling "NewsNation," Heuermann dug holes in his backyard, another saying that they remained friendly after a confrontation 28 years ago, when Heuermann would look over the fence and try to talk to his wife while she was sunbathing.
 
ETIENNE DEVILLIERS, REX HEUERMANN'S NEIGHBOR: It happened so many times that finally I pulled him over and said -- and we had a talk.
 
CASAREZ (voice-over): Residents in this Long Island suburb still in shock.
 
DEVILLIERS: For something like this to happen, right under our nose.
 
CASAREZ (voice-over): As authorities continue to collect and investigate potential evidence, they are now trying to determine if the alleged serial killer may have committed the murders of Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman and Amber Costello right in his own home.
 
Investigators are combing through Heuermann's home, searching for clues, including personal effects linked to the victims.
 
SHERIFF ERROL D. TOULON JR., SUFFOLK COUNTY: Every piece of evidence that could be gathered, whether from storage containers or from his home, could be valuable not only to the murders that he's currently being charged with but, more importantly, if we can connect them to other murders.
 
CASAREZ (voice-over): But it is the forensic evidence from possible victims that will establish the home as the primary crime scene. 
 
Documents show authorities believe they already have circumstantial evidence that points to the Long Island home, where victims may have been murdered. In 2022, a comprehensive investigation revealed for the first time Heuermann used burner phones to arrange dates with the victims. 
 
Documents state, before each victim went missing, triangulation of cellphone tower data showed the burner phones and the victims' phones traveled to Massapequa, Long Island, at about the same time as Heuermann, where his family home was located. They were never seen again.
 
Heuermann was charged in the murder of the three women. He has pleaded not guilty. Legal documents also reveal Heuermann's wife, Asa Ellerup, was out of town each and every time that the three victims were last seen. On Thursday, Heuermann's wife filing for divorce from her husband of more than 27 years.
 
Her attorney telling CNN in a statement, "The sensitive nature of her husband's arrest is taking an emotional toll on the immediate and extended family, especially their elderly family members." Authorities also expanding the investigation as well as looking to see
 
 if Heuermann is connected to unsolved homicide cases in Nevada, South Carolina and New Jersey.
 
CASAREZ: The next court date for this New York City architect is set for August 1st. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
NEWTON: That was Jean Casarez for us. 
 
The breakthrough in the Gilgo Beach murder investigation is one of many cases, where a long-unsolved homicide got a break, thanks to DNA analysis. Not only can police examine DNA taken from the crime scene, it can also analyze DNA from discarded food, soda cans, car doors, even cigarette butts that belong to suspected killers. 
 
Law enforcement can also make use of genetic genealogy. Earlier this year Massachusetts police announced that the murder of 31-year-old Todd Lampley over a decade ago was solved, thanks to DNA found on a sweet potato. 
 <br>[05:35:00]
 
NEWTON: Canadian police used genetic genealogy to solve a cold case nearly half a century old. DNA linked the murder of a 16-year-old Quebec girl to a deceased man buried over 800 miles away in West Virginia. 
 
And more than 50 years after Rita Curran's roommate found her strangled to death in her room, Vermont police identified her killer using DNA found on a cigarette butt on the victim's clothing. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NEWTON: Joining me is Anne Marie Schubert, former Sacramento County district attorney and she also led the efforts to use DNA evidence in cold cases. She is now with Verogen Incorporated, which develops DNA- based biometric human identification projects and products. 
 
Thank you so much for being with us. You've advocated and worked for most of your career, in fact, to use cutting edge DNA technologies in solving crimes and the innocence. 
 
You led the prosecution of Joseph DeAngelo. He was the Golden State Killer. That happened in 2018. And you know, he was responsible for horrific crimes, including 13 murders. 
 
When we see everything that's been in the news this week, is that what you envisioned decades ago when you highlighted that this DNA could be used in this way?
 
ANNE MARIE SCHUBERT, FORMER SACRAMENTO COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY: You know, I had my first DNA case almost 30 years ago. And I realized then that it was the greatest tool ever given to law enforcement, to find the truth, no matter where it leads us. Then as time went on and the science got better and better and better
 
 and then this -- one of the Golden State Killer victims described as a seismic shift, with the technology that we used to solve that case, we are in the greatest era of our ability to solve crime that we've ever seen. 
 
And I think it's all starting to be seen by the public. It's being seen by law enforcement. And it's honestly, it's extremely exciting on many, many levels. 
 
NEWTON: And just to build on that, what scientific developments do you think could make this field of investigative work even more effective and obviously lead to perhaps solving crimes more quickly? 
 
When you look at the pathology of serial killers -- people like you want these people caught as soon as possible, obviously. We all do. 
 
SCHUBERT: Absolutely. One of my colleagues, one of the FBI guys that worked on the GSK case, said we have the ability to eliminate the word "serial" from crimes; serial rapes, serial murders. 
 
You know and where we are right now is we have this ability to use forensic investigative genealogy, being used across the world since the Golden State Killer. We the tools, using public genealogy sites, such as GEDmatch, a Verogen database, to solve 90 percent of violent crimes that have DNA. 
 
That's astronomical, never seen in our lifetime. Right now we have this tremendous system called CODIS, which is a DNA database for convicted offenders. And that solves a lot of cases. 
 
But that has some limitations. Now with genetic genealogy with what they are using across the world and what was used on the Golden State Killer, every day of the week we're seeing new and more and more stories coming out. 
 
You know, what we're going to see in the future is it's going to become the standard, that this is the next tool we use if we cannot solve it with traditional databases. 
 
NEWTON: I want to get to the science in more detail in a moment. 
 
Before we get to that, how effective has it also been for exonerating people who have spent decades in prison for crimes they did not commit?
 
SCHUBERT: You know, I was very proud when I was a district attorney to partner with the Innocence Project in California and a neighboring district attorney's office that had an individual in prison, who claimed his innocence for years. 
 
It was only through DNA and through this tool of forensic investigative genetic genealogy, he spent 15 years in prison for a murder he did not commit. So I believe that it will continue to evolve. I believe that, as more and more funding comes in line, more training,
 
 more opportunities, it's not going to be -- it's going to be a tool for justice, wherever that tool leads us. And I think that's what's so powerful about this tool. 
 
NEWTON: And in terms of the other side of the coin, some people have worried that, look, everyone always tells us, if you didn't do anything wrong you shouldn't worry about where your DNA ends up, which -- how it's archived or used. 
 
Do you buy that, though?
 
Do you see that privacy needs to be protected, as well, in a certain way?
 
SCHUBERT: I think there's obviously privacy interests. When we start talking about people putting their DNA into Things like GEDmatch or family tree DNA --
 <br>[05:40:00]
 
SCHUBERT: -- these are folks that are agreeing to allow law enforcement to use their DNA, just like anybody else. We now have people that are going in to find their biological parents that were adopted, all those things. 
 
Should we have guardrails?
 
Absolutely. Things like what we call informed consent, making sure that people understand what their DNA is being used for, that's the thing that people are concerned about and something that we are very mindful and particularly in law enforcement that we follow what we call best practices. 
 
NEWTON: Thank you so much for being with us. You've been a pioneer and again we learned this week how effective those scientific tools can be. Thank you so much. 
 
SCHUBERT: Thank you so much, Paula. I appreciate it.

NEWTON: You think they're excited?
 
Yes, they are pumped up. Those fans in Auckland, New Zealand, as the U.S. powered through its opener with Vietnam 3-0. 
 
Now the U.S. scored early and kept control of the ball during most of the match. Vietnam never got a chance, unfortunately, to even take a shot. Instead, it had to play defense in the hopes of avoiding a blowout. 
 <br>[05:45:00]
 
NEWTON: CNN's Carolyn Manno has more from New York. 
 
They did avoid the blowout, right?
 
Which was a risk. 
 
CAROLYN MANNO, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: Definitely. I love those fans. A whole new definition of road warrior, going all the way to New Zealand. But the United States team was the heavy favorite here. 
 
They started the tournament with a solid win. A little bit to improve on but, overall, a good effort. They did possess the ball for the majority of the 3-0 win. It certainly didn't take Sophia Smith long to make an impact in her World Cup debut, driving the ball into back of the net to open up the scoring in just the 14th minute. 
 
She did strike again deep in stoppage time at the end of the first half for her second goal of the game. It was tight score-wise at that point. She's just shy of 23. She became the second youngest player in U.S. Women's team history to score multiple goals in a World Cup game. 
 
Megan Rapinoe came in as a substitute in the 61st minute for Team U.S., becoming the first 14th player to reach a milestone for her nation. And captain Lindsey Horan added a goal of her own. 
 
This was a sigh of relief, a little breathing room in the 77th minute, to officially put the game away. The U.S. will next face the Netherlands on Wednesday night here stateside in their second group E game. That's a rematch of the 2019 World Cup finals. 
 
So it gets more challenging from here. But while much of the focus was on the United States, there are a lot of other games being played at the Women's World Cup, of course. 
 
England in action now against Haiti. Another team making their tournament debut. The Lionesses are one of favorites, looking to follow up last summer's Euros triumph with another big win here. Right now at 0-0. 
 
Things underway in the first half of that game. Earlier, 2011 Women's World Cup champions, Japan, taking care of business against Zambia. Japan rolling to a 5-0 win over the lowest ranked team to ever qualify for the tournament at number 77 in the world. 
 
Japan has been on a roll as of late, now winning four of their last five games, including against Olympic champion Canada in February, she believes, cup (ph). So a lot to look forward to. 
 
NEWTON: We all are, right?
 
All eyes now on those matches. 
 
I got to turn to some poetry here. I called it poetry. You could not have written this script better. Tell us about football icon Lionel Messi and his debut for Inter Milan (sic). Crazy. 
 
MANNO: I think you might be heading toward a Messi question with poetry in motion. I mean, somehow, someway this debut with Inter Miami lived up to expectations that were sky high. I mean, his profitability, the fandom, everything has pointed to this.
 
And seven months after winning the men's World Cup, the seven-time FIFA player of the year delivers one of these signature magical Messi moments. He curls in the free kick strike from outside the box in the 94th minute. That's what the crowd wanted to see. More than 20,000 going absolutely wild.
 
And that would turn out to be the game winner in this 2-1 victory over Mexico's Cruz Azul. After the game, he said, he saw the goal, he knew he had to score and he felt an intensity. Everybody was waiting for that. I loved David Beckham just shaking their head, like that's what we brought him for. 
 
NEWTON: Isn't that lovely?
 
And that goal was -- I hate to use the cliche, the "Bend It Like Beckham Goal." It was incredible. I got chills when I was watching that. Carolyn Manno for us from New York, thanks so much. 
 
Now just days after a Powerball ticket won a little more than $1 billion, yes, I did read that right, the Mega Millions lottery is also heading into buy myself a private island territory. No ticket won on Friday so the jackpot continues to grow. The next
 
 drawing on Tuesday will have an estimated -- drum roll -- grand prize of $820 million. In case you were wondering, the lump sum payout would be $422 million before taxes. 
 
The odds of you or me for that matter winning are about, in case you were wondering, 302 million to one. 
 
Still ahead for us here on CNN NEWSROOM --

NEWTON: So many of us listened to those songs all day long today. Singer Tony Bennett died yesterday, a few weeks short of his 97th birthday. We've known since 2016 that he was battling Alzheimer's disease. 
 
Bob Hope discovered him in 1949. He was the opening act for Pearl Bailey in a New York City club. Frank Sinatra called Bennett the best pop singer in the whole world. 
 
(MUSIC PLAYING) 
 
NEWTON (voice-over): Bennett sang pop, he sang jazz, he sang standards. And he sang duets with so many, including Lady Gaga. 
 
(MUSIC PLAYING)
 
NEWTON (voice-over): His voice never failed him. Prominent musicians have been paying their reports to Tony Bennett with touching messages about what the singer meant to them. 
 <br>[05:55:00]
 
NEWTON: Billy Joel says, "Tony Bennett was one of the most important interpreters of American popular song during the mid to late 20th century. He championed songwriters who might otherwise have remained unknown to many millions of music fans." 
 
Elton John said, quote, "So sad to hear of Tony's passing. Without doubt, the classiest singer, man and performer you will ever see. He is irreplaceable. I loved and adored him. Condolences to Susan, Danny and the family." 
 
Tony Bennett made a big impact on fellow singers as well. Harry Connick Jr. and Michael Buble spoke to CNN about what they'll remember about their friend. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRY CONNICK JR., SINGER AND ACTOR: I've known Tony for years, probably since I was a teenager. I think when he came through New Orleans was the first time I met him.
 
And I just remember him aside from -- we could talk for hours about what an unbelievable musical talent he was but he was so nice to me, always so kind; his arms were always open. 
 
And I just have a lot of laughs when I think about it, because he was the kind of guy -- I would love to have him come on stage and sing with me. But you also had to be careful because you knew who was going to get the most applause and it wasn't going to be me.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MICHAEL BUBLE, GRAMMY AWARD-WINNING SINGER: He has changed the face of music and it's not just in the beautiful country of America or even North America, including Canada; it is worldwide.
 
I mean, listen, I toured nearly 50 countries this year and there's not a place -- there's not a language spoken that doesn't love him and that won't love him forever. He'll become part of all our lives in wonderful moments, when we get married or when we fall in love, to difficult moments, you know, when we're saying goodbye to one another. 
 
He's just become a part of culture.

NEWTON: The legend, Tony Bennett, was 96 years old.
