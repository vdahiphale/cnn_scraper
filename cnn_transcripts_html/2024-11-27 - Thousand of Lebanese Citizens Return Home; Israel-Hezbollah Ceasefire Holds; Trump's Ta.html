ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  -- on the Biden administration's race to send crucial aid to Ukraine before 
 
 President-Elect Trump's inauguration. Now, this comes as we're also learning new details about the Trump team's potential strategy to end the 
 
 war between Russia and Ukraine. CNN chief -- 
 
JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN ANCHOR, FIRST MOVE:  It's 7:00 a.m. in Beijing, 3:00 p.m. in Vancouver, and 6:00 p.m. here in New York. I'm Julia Chatterley. 
 
 And wherever you are in the world, this is your "First Move."
 
And a warm welcome to "First Move." And here's today's need to know. Heading home. Thousands of Lebanese citizens return home as the Israel-
 
 Hezbollah ceasefire holds. Transition targets. Several of Donald Trump's cabinet nominees say they've suffered threats to their lives. Swap success. 
 
 Three American prisoners detained for years in China are finally released. And --

(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHATTERLEY:  -- Afghan activism. The award-winning teenage girl raising her voice to help those back home who've been silenced. That conversation and 
 
 plenty more coming up.
 
But first, the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah appears to be holding. Thousands of Lebanese are headed back to their homes, but Israel 
 
 is warning residents not to return south of the Litani River. At least 1.3 million people were displaced during more than a year of fighting, 
 
 according to the U.N. Refugee Agency. And across the border in Northern Israel, many residents are refusing to return, fearing that the deal is 
 
 unlikely to bring permanent peace.
 
Jeremy Diamond joins us now. Jeremy, that's the challenge here. For those that are very skeptical about this truce, and about their hopes for longer-
 
 term peace, they've got two decades of violence to get over, and trust to overcome.
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT:  No doubt about it. And listen, we are nearly 24 hours now into this ceasefire between Israel and 
 
 Hezbollah and questions still abound about how long this truce will actually last. For now, we are still very much in the implementation phase 
 
 of this agreement.
 
We've been watching as the Lebanese military has been moving into Southern Lebanon. They are expected to play a stepped-up role during this 
 
 implementation phase, but also beyond as well in terms of monitoring ceasefire violations by both sides.
 
The Israeli military, for its part, is still very much in Southern Lebanon. And today, we saw videos of Lebanese civilians who are returning to some of 
 
 these Southern Lebanese towns, very close to those Israeli positions.
 
The Israeli military now warning Lebanese residents not to approach its military positions, telling civilians not to move south of the Litani 
 
 River. That is the area now, some 25 miles north of the Israeli border where Hezbollah operatives are meant to move north, from which south of 
 
 that point, Hezbollah is not meant to operate.
 
We saw scenes of joy on the Lebanese side as people celebrated what they hope and believe to be the end of this war and as they began packing into 
 
 cars and moving south. It was a very different picture though on the southern side of that border, in Northern Israel, where we spent much of 
 
 our day today and where residents are still very skeptical about the ceasefire. And not many are returning home yet.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DIAMOND:  So, you're back in Shtula with all the dogs.
 
ORI ELIYAHU, SHTULA RESIDENT:  Yes. I am at home. It's not really home at the moment, but -- 
 
DIAMOND (voice-over):  Ori Eliyahu is one of just a handful of residents living in this Israeli community along the Lebanese border. But he's not 
 
 back because he thinks it's safe.
 
ELIYAHU:  So, basically not -- it's not just that this is Lebanon, Jebel Blat, you see here the mountain?
 
DIAMOND:  Yes.
 
ELIYAHU:  Those houses are Hezbollah's houses. They are shooting missiles from there.
 
DIAMOND (voice-over):  The new ceasefire agreement means Hezbollah must withdraw from this area, about 25 miles north of the Israeli border. But 
 
 like many others in Northern Israel, Ori doesn't trust Hezbollah, nor the Israeli government's assurances that it will prevent Hezbollah from 
 
 regrouping.
 
On the first day of this new ceasefire, Shtula is just as much of a ghost town as when we visited over the summer.
 
DIAMOND:  Let's go quick.
 
DIAMOND (voice-over):  Back then, the Israeli military gave us just three minutes to see homes struck by anti-tank missiles, fearing Hezbollah could 
 
 strike again.
 
DIAMOND:  I remember when I came here with -- 
 
DIAMOND (voice-over):  Today, overlooking that same view, standing along that same devastated home, that threat seems further away, but for how 
 
 long?
 
DIAMOND:  Your fear is that this agreement won't prevent this from happening again?
 <br>[18:05:00]
 
ELIYAHU:  You are saying it's a fear. It's not fear. It's not fear, it's effect. Here in the Middle East, this is how you go. This is how thing 
 
 works. If a terrorist can shoot you, he'll shoot you.
 
DIAMOND (voice-over):  He says his neighbors, among the roughly 60,000 Israelis displaced from the north, don't feel safe enough to return.
 
ELIYAHU:  They won't do it. We are speaking about it all the time in the WhatsApp group and in the phone, anywhere, everywhere. They want -- they 
 
 are not stupid.
 
DIAMOND (voice-over):  Just down the road, Ora Hatan is enjoying her first peaceful day in more than a year.
 
ORA HATAN, SHTULA RESIDENT:  We wake up to the quiet morning. It's -- after one year, it's unusual.
 
DIAMOND (voice-over):  She, too, is skeptical that the ceasefire will lead to a lasting peace, but she doesn't see an alternative.
 
HATAN:  I spoke with the soldier. They tire us. They exhaust. Also, what another option that we have, to arrive to Beirut?
 
DIAMOND (voice-over):  On the Lebanese side of the border, many civilians were quick to return to Southern Lebanon.
 
Yes, thank God. I'm happy, of course. We're going back to our hometown, to our land.
 
The Lebanese military also headed south, expected to monitor Hezbollah activity as a fragile truce takes hold.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
DIAMOND (on camera):  And while that truce is indeed still holding for now, that doesn't mean that it's been all quiet on the Lebanese-Israeli border. 
 
 As we were there today, we heard at least one burst of artillery fire, several bursts of small arms fire heard in the distance as well. There are 
 
 some ceasefire violations being claimed by both sides. The Lebanese state news agency reported that several journalists who were covering the return 
 
 of displaced people to Southern Lebanon were fired upon by Israeli troops. The Israeli military, for its part, says that it arrested and also killed 
 
 several Hezbollah militants who it claimed were violating the ceasefire and approaching their position.
 
The Israeli military, as I said before, is indeed warning Lebanese civilians not to approach its positions in Southern Lebanon. The Lebanese 
 
 military is also now issuing similar warnings. The Israeli military says that it will enforce this and any potential ceasefire violations by force. 
 
 Julia.
 
CHATTERLEY:  That was a very important report, Jeremy. Ori's comment, it was a powerful statement where violence is concerned, it's not a fear, it's 
 
 a fact. And that's what both sides have to overcome here. It's a challenge. Thank you. Jeremy Diamond there.
 
Now, President-Elect Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum have spoken about migration and security. President Sheinbaum described it as a 
 
 quote, "excellent conversation," which included migrant caravans and moves being made to prevent fentanyl consumption. Mexico is under threat of new 
 
 U.S. tariffs, along with Canada and China, and a growing number of business leaders, companies and lobbyists are sounding the alarm.
 
IKEA, among the latest to warn that customers risk bearing the brunt of rising prices. Most of its goods are made in Europe, with the remaining 30 
 
 percent coming from Asia, mainly China, the U.S. is its second biggest market, by the way. The Consumer Brands Association, which represents Coca-
 
 Cola, General Mills, and many others, is warning of a, quote, "clear and present danger to its members."
 
Richard Quest joins us now. Richard, they could almost be lobbyists for the government. Some might call this a stroke of genius. In the space of three 
 
 days, not one tariff applied, but the president-elect has managed to have direct phone calls with Prime Minister Trudeau and the president of Mexico.
 
RICHARD QUEST, CNN BUSINESS EDITOR-AT-LARGE AND CNN ANCHOR, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS:  He's negotiating. He's not even president yet until January the 
 
 20th. He is negotiating. And, Julia, we don't know what the success of that negotiation would even look like. For instance, he says if they have not 
 
 reduced -- judging by the tweet alone, if they have not reduced the flow of migrants or illegal drugs, fentanyl and the like, by certain amounts by 
 
 January the 20th, these tariffs will apply.
 
But there is nowhere in this the barometer by which that can be achieved or success monitored, which leads one to the assumption that it is merely a 
 
 raft of promises before then from Canada and Mexico that he will take on board.
 
CHATTERLEY:  The president-elect is the barometer, Richard. When he gets into power, he'll declare if there's some element of success. And that's 
 
 the point, I think.
 
QUEST:  Yes, absolutely. So, Trudeau had his conversation and said he was going to do this, that, and the other, and they were talking about it. And 
 
 the Mexican president, who's much more, by the way, hardline and to the left, she's basically saying, no, we're not going to do that. We're going 
 
 to have a trade war if necessary, as indeed has China said similar.
 <br>[18:10:00]
 
But in both cases, we do not know what Donald Trump would accept as being the answer that would forestall the tariffs. I can only assume it is a raft 
 
 of promises. It's, we will cut this, we will do this, we will extend this, we will spend on that, we will do all of this. And we may start it now or 
 
 we may start it later, but we don't know that those are the measures that he'll accept.
 
CHATTERLEY:  No, and it has nothing to do with trade, in essence, it's about, to your point, immigration and the flow of drugs, which he's 
 
 promised, let's be clear, in the campaign to discuss, it's just he's using tariffs or taxes on consumers as his weapon of choice.
 
QUEST:  Donald Trump is exceptionally clever. He knows the power of the threat. He knows the power of the bully pulpit. He knows all of these 
 
 things. What's not clear is how far he is prepared to destabilize the supply chain. And the reason I say this is because back in his last 
 
 administration, he had not seen the full effects of that.
 
It was only in 2020, as we came out of COVID, that we realized the fragility and the futility of messing around with the with the supply 
 
 chain. And then, we saw the results of inflation that followed on, from demand supply led. He doesn't -- he hasn't fully experience that.
 
If you take cars -- look, Julia, you know this, look under the UMMCA, take cars, bits go this way, bits go that way, the car goes that way, the car 
 
 goes this way. The thing is built in one country or another. And the whole idea is it's meant to be to a certain extent, national neutral. That will 
 
 not happen if he starts tinkering round with tariffs.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Oxford Economics says it could be recessionary, if he does this for a year over Mexico and Canada.
 
QUEST:  Oh, yes.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Grocery prices, half of fresh fruits imported from Mexico. Richard, do you think he's willing to do that? Do you think he was even 
 
 aware of that?
 
QUEST:  He's going for the traditional Trump strategy. I will bulldoze my way through, and they will give in. And he has a certain amount of 
 
 precedent on his side. He knows both of these countries. You know, who needs who more, Julia? Answer that question. Who needs more than who in 
 
 this environment? Who can afford to stand the pain of this most, if they choose to stare down the president? And he's not even in power yet.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Let's see if the United States can withstand it longer. No one can stand it, but the standoff can continue longest on the U.S. side. Plus, 
 
 he's just won an election. It's going to be interesting, Richard. Happy Thanksgiving.
 
QUEST:  Thank you. Thank you.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Thank you.
 
QUEST:  Where's my turkey? Where's my turkey? Cluck, cluck.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Cluck, cluck. All right. Let's move on. Concerning threats across the United States, the FBI says bomb threats since swatting targeted 
 
 some of Donald Trump's cabinet picks and administration appointees. Several people tapped by Trump have said they were threatened, and they include 
 
 Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, the president-elect's choice to serve as U.N. ambassador, and Lee Zeldin, the nominee for the Environmental Protection 
 
 Agency.
 
Swatting, by the way, is a hoax that involves falsely reporting a crime to send police to a certain location. Jeff Zeleny joins us now. Jeff, it's not 
 
 the first time we've heard of either of these kind of threats in the political sphere. What are we hearing about who might have been carrying 
 
 this out and what are the individuals concerned saying?
 
JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Julia, these threats are quite common, actually, for people who are in the news, 
 
 talking to law enforcement officials. They tell CNN that it often follows names in the news, often if they're controversial or whatnot, they receive 
 
 bomb threats or swatting incidents.
 
But as you said, the different part about this is that many of them are Trump administration officials, people who he has appointed or intends to 
 
 appoint to be in his cabinet. Everyone from the CIA director, John Ratcliffe, to as you said, Elise Stefanik, a member of Congress who is 
 
 tapped to be the U.N. ambassador to the United Nations to the AG secretary, to the labor secretary, on and on. So, there are several examples of them.
 
But the FBI said it is working with local law enforcement officials because that is the curious thing. These threats happened at individuals' homes, 
 
 which are across the United States, not simply just here in Washington.
 
The Trump transition, an official is telling us it's un-American and they believe that this is indeed a threat. The FBI is taking this seriously and 
 
 is looking into this. The White House was briefed on this. We're told that President Biden was briefed on this, and he condemns this in all forms. The 
 
 question is how real were these threats? And that is an open question, the FBI is still looking into that.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes. Question also is how do you stop it? Difficult. Jeff Zeleny, thank you for that report.
 
ZELENY:  Sure.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Now, some U.S. government workers are facing a different kind of fear. They're worried about being targeted online by Elon Musk and his 
 
 social media followers.
 <br>[18:15:00]
 
This comes after posts on X that named four people in obscure federal jobs. Other federal workers told CNN they're now worried about being physically 
 
 threatened as Musk looks to slash government spending and jobs.
 
Hadas Gold joins us now. Hadas, good to have you with us. It reminds me a little bit of when Musk took over X and he had some altercations with 
 
 workers at Twitter at the time. Just explain what happened here and I wonder whether some part of this is trying to force some kind of natural 
 
 attrition in government jobs.
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN MEDIA CORRESPONDENT:  Yes. So, last week, in the flurry of posts that Elon Musk makes every day on X, he reposted a couple posts from 
 
 an anonymous account that was taking screen grabs of a publicly available database of federal workers. But in these screen grabs were the names, the 
 
 titles, and the city of some federal workers who all do different jobs around climate change.
 
Now, some of the titles are, you know, rather obscure titles like director of climate diversification, senior adviser on environmental justice and 
 
 climate change. And Musk reposting some of these made comments such as so many fake jobs. And this is, of course, goes into all the effort that he is 
 
 heading up along with Vivek Ramaswamy, the Department of Government Efficiency, trying to slash the size of the federal government.
 
Now, I've been speaking to federal employees, some of them who are actually of the idea of trying to make government more efficient, but not only are 
 
 they preparing themselves for likely job losses, but now, they are also concerned, after these posts by Elon Musk, that they are also going to be 
 
 somehow personally targeted, because what we're seeing after Elon Musk made these posts, keep in mind he has hundreds of millions of followers, is a 
 
 torrent of negative comments specifically about some of these people calling them out by name.
 
Now, the four women who were listed, they have not responded to requests for comment or have declined to comment, but we also don't know what sort 
 
 of threats or otherwise they might be getting in their, you know, personal inboxes, because in the past, when Elon Musk has targeted other people by 
 
 name, those people, I've spoken to some of them, they were getting death threats. They had to move from their homes temporarily.
 
So, now there's a real fear among federal employees that as part of this effort to cut down on the size of the government, that some private 
 
 individuals may be caught up in this as well, because all of those people that were mentioned in those posts, these are, you know, more private 
 
 government employees. These are not public facing roles. This is not the spokesperson for a government agency. Somebody who is facing the public on 
 
 a daily basis.
 
We do have a statement for the union that represents these federal employees. They say these tactics are aimed at sowing terror and fear in 
 
 federal employees. It's intended to make them fearful that we will be -- that they will become too afraid to speak up.
 
Now, Julia, while I was reporting out the story, I tried to reach out to some experts on cyber harassment, on doxing to get their point of view. And 
 
 I was stunned when several of them declined to comment on the record using their names because they themselves were afraid of becoming one of Elon 
 
 Musk's latest targets.
 
Now, we reached out to X, trying to get a comment from them, trying to get a comment from Elon Musk. We did, our colleague, Rene Marsh, did speak to 
 
 Vivek Ramaswamy, and he said, our opponent is not any particular individual. Our opponent is the bureaucracy. Of course, that's of little 
 
 comfort to those four women who were listed in those screen grabs that Elon Musk amplified.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes. Efficiency gains, I think, are important wherever you are in the world, be it the public sector or the private sector, but personal 
 
 persecutions of individuals not so good. Halas Gold, thank you for that report.
 
Now, three Americans are giving thanks ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday for their freedom. Kai Li, Mark Swidan, and John Leung have been, all been 
 
 released, according to U.S. officials, as part of a prisoner swap between Washington and Beijing. All three men have been detained for years. Now, a 
 
 spokesperson for the National Security Council says the Americans should be reunited with their families soon.
 
Jennifer Hansler joins us now from Washington, D.C. Jennifer, tell us more about this release and how it came about.
 
JENNIFER HANSLER, CNN STATE DEPARTMENT REPORTER:  Well, Julia, this was really months and months and years and years of diplomatic effort by the 
 
 Biden administration to get the Chinese to agree to this prisoner swap. We understand that this is brought up in basically every meeting between U.S. 
 
 and Chinese officials, be it Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting with Foreign Minister Wang Yi, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan when he 
 
 was in China earlier this year, and then just in the past few weeks, President Joe Biden, when he met with President Xi Jinping on the margins 
 
 of the APEC Summit in Peru.
 
And of course, a lot of this work goes on quietly, privately behind the scenes. But we did get some indications that the wheels were turning when 
 
 another wrongfully detained American was released back in September. David Lin was released from China also after serving years behind bars there. And 
 
 then, today, we saw these three Americans return home, Mark, Kai, and John. Two of them, Mark and Kai, had been designated as wrongfully detained by 
 
 the U.S. State Department.
 
Now, their families are giving major thanks ahead of the holiday that their loved ones are coming home. We expect them to land on U.S. soil in Texas 
 
 later tonight, and the family of Kai Li put out a statement just in the past hour. If I can read a little bit of that.
 <br>[18:20:00]
 
This is his son, Harrison said they enthusiastically welcome the news that Kai has been released from captivity after just over 3,000 days of wrongful 
 
 detention. They give thanks to the president, the national security adviser, secretary of state. And they urged President Biden to use his 
 
 remaining days in office to bring home the remaining Americans who are held abroad or wrongfully detained. Julia.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes, fantastic news for their families. What an incredible Thanksgiving and heading into the season as well. Good news. Jennifer 
 
 Hansler, thank you so much for that report.
 
All right. Straight ahead, the superheroes of the robotic world. A.I. powered Gecko Robots. They climb, they crawl, they swim, and even fly to 
 
 help keep infrastructure safe. We'll get the very latest on the firm from the CEO.
 
Plus, inflation running out of control in New York City, at least temporarily. A Thanksgiving Eve tradition well underway as Macy's Parade 
 
 balloons are gently being inflated.
 
Plus, the Thanksgiving holiday getaway now well underway too. Stay with us, there's more.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHATTERLEY:  Welcome back to "First Move." And a pre-Turkey Day dip or swoop on Wall Street, topping today's Money Move. Little appetite for 
 
 stocks the day before the big Thanksgiving feast with tech leading the declines as you can see there. Weak forecasts from computer makers Dell and 
 
 HP. And the latest U.S. inflation data, not helping sentiment either. The Federal Reserve's prepared -- preferred, excuse me, inflation gauge rising, 
 
 2.3 percent year over year in October. That was in line with estimates, but still headed in the wrong direction.
 
Core inflation, which strips out food and energy cost rising to 2.8 percent year over year. That's the highest that's been since April. More investors 
 
 now worried the Fed will hold off on cutting interest rates next month as U.S. economic data continues to come in strong. And of course, we can throw 
 
 in tariff uncertainty too.
 
Now, news just in from the tech sector. U.S. antitrust officials launching a sweeping investigation into Microsoft that, according to a source 
 
 familiar with the matter. Officials now ordering Microsoft to turn over information related to the case, no comment as yet from Microsoft or the 
 
 Federal Trade Commission.
 
Meanwhile, in Asia, a strong day of trade for Chinese stocks. The Hang Seng, the outperformer, but weakness for the Nikkei and the South Korean 
 
 KOSPI. Asian trading could be light on Thursday too later today because of the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday.
 <br>[18:25:00]
 
And speaking of which, the U.S. Thanksgiving getaway also well underway. And airports are busier than ever. The Transportation Safety 
 
 Administration, or TSA, is expecting to screen more than 18 million people during this holiday week. 2.9 million people are expected to pass through 
 
 security on Wednesday alone. On Sunday, it could exceed 3 million as the travelers all then head back home.
 
I know Thanksgiving Day will be complete without the annual Macy's Parade here in New York City, and our Harry Enten, resplendent in a turkey 
 
 costume, is down among the preparations.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
HARRY ENTEN, CNN SENIOR DATA REPORTER:  We're here on Central Park West ahead of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, which will be going on 
 
 tomorrow morning. I got my dear, big, older brother, Tom the Turkey, who has been part of this parade pretty much since it started, get this, 100 
 
 years ago. My goodness gracious.
 
Look, today, the energy is absolutely through the roof. You can see the folks have been making their way on Central Park West here. Of course, this 
 
 is part of the big pregame show the parades tomorrow. But tonight, they will be inflating the balloons. Some of which have already been inflated, 
 
 others of which are under netting. Tomorrow, down Central Park West here in Manhattan, all the way down to 34th Street in Midtown Manhattan.
 
Of course, a big question tomorrow is the weather. Now, the weather forecast ain't so hot to trot. Rain is in the forecast, but I dare say that 
 
 is part of the reason why we have hats. We have hats here to cover ourselves up from the elements.
 
Look, the good news is that the wind forecast is supposed to be rather minimum in terms of wind and that is key because those 17 giant balloons, 
 
 including new ones such as Minnie Mouse, who's making her debut in the parade, will be able to fly as long as the wind stays minimum.
 
All I can say is 1, 2, 3, let's have a parade tomorrow. Back to you.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHATTERLEY:  Harry Enten clucking about there and all bundled up and rightly so with the rest of the Thanksgiving Day weather. Here's Elisa 
 
 Raffa. The question is, are you going to rain on the Thanksgiving Day Parade, at least it, metaphorically speaking?
 
ELISA RAFFA, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  It will, yes. It does look soggy. Yes, it looks like a soggy Thanksgiving Day Parade for New York City and for 
 
 Philadelphia as well. There are parades there too.
 
The good news is that travel has been good today with a record number of Americans out trying to travel. We've had green airplanes here on the map 
 
 pretty much all day. We have a storm system developing, but it's not really packing a punch yet. We've had some wet conditions on I-70 all day from 
 
 Denver across Kansas, to Kansas City in St. Louis. That rain is now stretching into Indianapolis and Cincinnati. So, it's been a wet go of it 
 
 on the roads if you're doing any traveling by car in the Midwest.
 
As we get towards tomorrow, the storm system is really going to flourish. We'll have cold air pummel itself in behind it. And then you've got soaked 
 
 turkeys there up and down the East Coast. So, it does include some of those cities with the parades like New York and Philadelphia. But we are also 
 
 looking at some snow on the top side of this. So, major travel impacts likely across New England, where several inches of snow is possible.
 
So, you could see this storm really blow up as we go into Thanksgiving. Rain and snow in interior New England, several inches possible, and then 
 
 we'll find the rain stretching from New York down to D.C., even it's the southeast, Charlotte, Atlanta, the Gulf Coast. That will all push east by 
 
 Friday, but cold air comes in and the lake effect snow machine starts in the Great Lakes. You'll have travel headaches there all weekend.
 
So, again, we'll continue with some of this rain the Tennessee Valley, but by tomorrow morning, problems at the airports for New York, D.C., if you're 
 
 doing any last-minute traveling. As you go through the day, the problems up in New England will increase as we get more of that snow. And then, all 
 
 weekend, I expect problems at the airports for the Great Lakes, Chicago, Detroit, Buffalo, because you'll have snow that's nonstop from the lake 
 
 effect. Snow, winter storm warnings are in effect for a lot of New England from that first round of Thanksgiving snow. But again, once those lakes 
 
 start going, several feet of snow possible in areas like Buffalo and Watertown. Julia.
 
CHATTERLEY:  So, it may be a rainy Thanksgiving Day Parade, but you can get your skis on in other areas if you fancy it. Elisa Raffa, thank you so much 
 
 and Happy Thanksgiving.
 
RAFFA:  Happy Thanksgiving.
 
CHATTERLEY:  All right. Still ahead for us, superstar robots and a supercharged CEO. We'll hear from the co-founder of Gecko Robotics with an 
 
 incredible tale of how he launched his firm and the progress they've made. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:30:00]
 
CHATTERLEY:  Welcome back to "First Move" with a look at more international headlines this hour. Volkswagen has sold its car plant in China's Xinjiang 
 
 province citing economic reasons for the decision. It points to pressure from rival car makers producing EVs. The company's also looking at shutting 
 
 down plants in Germany too.
 
The streets of Pakistan's capital were empty after supporters of Imran Khan called off their protests. They've been demanding the former prime minister 
 
 be released from jail. Security forces cracked down to disperse the protesters overnight. At least six people were reportedly killed during 
 
 clashes on Tuesday. Mike Valerio has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MIKE VALERIO, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, these latest developments are certainly a huge turn of events from the end of Tuesday night when Imran 
 
 Khan, the former prime minister of Pakistan, wrote on X that he wanted his supporters to continue fighting until their demands were met. And 
 
 ultimately, none, at least at this point, of their demands have been met.
 
What exactly did they want? Three central things. Protesters, supporters of Imran Khan, the former prime minister of Pakistan, wanted him out of jail. 
 
 He's facing more than 150 criminal cases. They also wanted a constitutional amendment for Pakistan's constitution repealed. And they finally wanted 
 
 seats that they believe they won fair and square in parliament in elections in February to be given to them. And from their point of view, those seats 
 
 have been denied to their political party.
 
So, one of the main questions going forward is what will both of these sides do? The side of Imran Khan. His wife, Bushra Bibi, certainly a 
 
 galvanizing force in Imran Khan's absence of leading protesters to go on these convoys, from the outskirts of town into the center of Islamabad.
 
And conversely, we will be acutely watching what will the government, led by Prime Minister Sharif, be doing as well. At the end of Tuesday, we were 
 
 able to report no substantial measures of progress between Prime Minister Sharif's government and Imran Khan's political party and the protesters. 
 
 Will there be talks that will be held in the next few days to avoid this situation from playing out?
 <br>[18:35:00]
 
At least in the time being, our team on the ground is reporting that internet service is being restored to different quarters of Islamabad. It 
 
 has been cut off to varying degrees over the past few days and roads are clearing of protesters.

CHATTERLEY:  Our thanks to Mike there. Now, call in A.I. so things don't go awry. Gecko Robots boldly go where humans can't to inspect critical assets 
 
 and infrastructure. They also help in the building process and day-to-day operations.
 
The U.S. Navy and Air Force are customers, as well as Mitsubishi and power giant Siemens Energy. All of us here in New York owe them a debt of 
 
 gratitude too. Gecko Robots have inspected many of our state's roughly 17,000 bridges to see if they need repair. It's an area of tech that may 
 
 not grab a lot of headlines, but it's incredibly important nonetheless.
 
Gecko Robotics say its devices can decrease maintenance costs by up to 80 percent Jake Loosararian is CEO and co-founder of Gecko Robotics and he 
 
 joins us now. Jake, fantastic to have you on the show. This is very fun. Just start by explaining how these robots work and how much and what kind 
 
 of data is collected.
 
JAKE LOOSARARIAN, CO-FOUNDER AND CEO, GECKO ROBOTICS:  Absolutely. Well, it's great to be on. Thanks so much. Gecko is making robots and software 
 
 that help diagnose the health of the built world, and we do that with robots that's -- you know, it comes in all shapes and sizes, whether they 
 
 fly or they're climbing up walls or they're walking around.
 
What they're doing is they're gathering structural integrity data, health data of the built world all around us, whether it's on a bridge, whether 
 
 it's on a pipeline, ICBM missile silo, a ship, all the different kinds of physical structures that we rely on every single day.
 
And what we're doing is we're creating all this information and data set that never existed before about the health of all these things, combining 
 
 that with advanced software and artificial intelligence to help drive better decisions about how to deploy capital, how to reduce risk and also 
 
 environmental impact as well as how do you make more with less, which is the big name of the game right now in the U.S. for manufacturing.
 
CHATTERLEY:  OK. Put the A.I. part into English for me. Where's the A.I. part of utilizing the data that you're collecting to help make better 
 
 decisions in all the forms that you mentioned? What's the A.I. part of this?
 
LOOSARARIAN:  It's a great question. Well, you know, I think what's been so clear is that artificial intelligence is promising this amazing ability to 
 
 help optimize decisions. But we all know that, you know, artificial intelligence is only as good as the data you put into it.
 
And so, our robots are going out into the real world every single day. We've got now over 500,000 assets that we manage inside of our software, 
 
 our artificial intelligence driven software called Cantilever. And what it's doing is it's using artificial intelligence to understand take all the 
 
 information from those 500,000 assets and help inform what's going to fail into the future, especially when you begin to incorporate operational 
 
 variables that change and you begin to predict and understand how to deploy capital most efficiently to ensure that you get longer life of these 
 
 manufacturing facilities that we're all supposed to not last as long and we need them to last twice as long and we need them to produce way more.
 
And so, all the data that we're collecting about the health and the operational variables at these facilities and manufacturing, for example, 
 
 you know, help them produce as well as ensure catastrophic failures like explosions or oil leaking into rivers, these are things that just never 
 
 happen. And do it in a way that we can collect data in a way that's safe and also, of highest fidelity. Because right now, we're relying on the 
 
 bridges in New York to be safe based on a guy on a rope with a handheld sensor camera. And it's -- yes. So, anyway, it's a real existential crisis 
 
 right now.
 
CHATTERLEY:  I was about to say, that was exactly the example I was going to use, because we just saw a sort of image of one of the robots, a drone, 
 
 or what looked like a drone flying towards the bridge. Is that the point that you effectively want to have one of these robots scanning the area the 
 
 whole time so you can look at deterioration rates, you can make small fixes over time rather than delaying for years and then there being some kind of 
 
 significant or more catastrophic failure later on?
 
LOOSARARIAN:  That's right. And I think it's -- you know, I started the company out of a college dorm room back in 2013. And, you know, back then, 
 
 it was just a wall climbing robot looking for structural defects instead of a power plant that would explode every couple of weeks. And you know, now 
 
 it's kind of evolved and we use way more robots on way more assets and infrastructure. But the problem is the same, just identifying invisible 
 
 defects that could cause -- whether it's 18 percent increase in emissions, which is, you know, kind of the studies are showing, like, that's the 
 
 impact of things breaking when they're not supposed to in these industrial sectors.
 <br>[18:40:00]
 
But it's also to, you know, help ensure that, you know, when we think about how manufacturing is so vital and critical in the U.S. and we have all 
 
 this, you know, big surge on manufacturing here domestically, it's almost like a national security threat right now, well, the thing -- the reality 
 
 is that 54 percent of steel, for example, is made in China, only 4 percent in the U.S.
 
And over the last 40 years, 7 million manufacturing jobs have left the U.S. for other countries. And when you walk into these facilities and you see, 
 
 you're basically walking into the past. And that's what you hear from these customers.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes.
 
LOOSARARIAN:  And so, technology like ours is completely changing that you want the best talent in the world to run towards these big problems in 
 
 manufacturing. And so, that's what our company is trying to do.
 
CHATTERLEY:  I have so many questions for you, but I have to ask a very important question, first and foremost, and it's sort of Spider Man 
 
 related. How is the robot sticking to the side of the ship?
 
LOOSARARIAN:  I can't tell you that -- no. We use neodymium Earth magnets.
 
CHATTERLEY:  (INAUDIBLE) to technology. Go on.
 
LOOSARARIAN:  Designed in the whole block arrays, which increase the force of the robots. But you also can use this vacuum adhesion for nonferrous 
 
 substrates. And so, anyway, it's -- the tech is cool. And building robots, you know, is amazing, it's fun, but most importantly for customers, it's 
 
 practical. We're helping to deploy billions of dollars for each individual customer. How do you deploy billions of dollars of capital across all your 
 
 physical things? We're helping to figure out how to do that about 20, 30, 40 percent more efficiently.
 
And so, yes, hundreds of millions and value creation for each individual site for our customers and for the (INAUDIBLE). Yes. What's that?
 
CHATTERLEY:  I'm sold. How much does it cost? How much does one of these robots cost?
 
LOOSARARIAN:  You can invest. We'll get you into the next round.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Now, that's a different question. Wait, can you give me ballpark? How much does one of the robots cost?
 
LOOSARARIAN:  So, we don't sell the robots. So, what we do is we integrate all these incredible technologies, right? They're all going out and 
 
 gathering data and that all flows into a central software that's helping customers deploy capital, reduce risk, operate their assets more 
 
 efficiently.
 
CHATTERLEY:  So, you lease them?
 
LOOSARARIAN:  Yes. So, it's -- you know, the robots are gathering all this information that literally never used before. And then customers are using 
 
 the software to make decisions that saves seven months of time to make a decision, it can reduce labor by 85 percent on, you know, vessel 
 
 turnarounds for the Navy. Just a huge, huge amount of impact for customers. But, yes, we sell the software and the robots just feed us the data.
 
CHATTERLEY:  I read as well that you spent two and a half years sleeping on a sofa that you were working 100 hours a week that your co-partner in this 
 
 -- 
 
LOOSARARIAN:  It was actually on the ground behind the sofa. So, not even as elegant, unfortunately.
 
CHATTERLEY:  We don't even have time to talk about it, but I want to talk to you as an entrepreneur as well and on what building a business like this 
 
 takes, but we'll save it for the next conversation. Jake, Happy Thanksgiving and thank you so much for your time. Fun to watch.
 
LOOSARARIAN:  You as well. Thank you.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Thank you. The CEO and co-founder of Gecko Robotics there.
 
All right. Coming up, singing out for human rights. One Afghan teenager using her voice to protest discrimination. Well, now, she's handing the 
 
 microphone to other young women. We'll speak to Nila Ibrahimi after this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:45:00]
 
CHATTERLEY:  Welcome back to "First Move." My next guest is just 17 years old, but she's already a rising star in the field of human rights. Nila 
 
 Ibrahimi is the co-founder of the platform "Her Story." The initiative gives Afghan women and girls the chance to share their experiences with the 
 
 rest of the world. And now, she's joined an illustrious group of young women, including Greta Thunberg and Malala Yousafzai, by winning the 
 
 International Children's Peace Prize.
 
Her first show of activism began as a young teenager when authorities in Kabul tried to ban schoolgirls from singing in public. Ibrahimi's brother 
 
 posted a video of her singing on social media and the I Am My Song Campaign took off. And by the way, the order then was never implemented.
 
Fast forward to last week, and here is Nila singing as she accepted her award in Amsterdam. Just take a listen.

CHATTERLEY:  And I'm very excited to say, Nila Ibrahimi joins us now from Vancouver, Canada. Nila, fantastic to have you on the show. You have the 
 
 voice of an angel, first and foremost. How does it feel to win this award?
 
NILA IBRAHIMI, WINNER, INTERNATIONAL CHILDREN'S PEACE PRIZE AND CO-FOUNDER, "HER STORY":  I mean, thank you so much. First of all, for having me, 
 
 Julia. It's great to be here. I think getting that award was a really big moment, not only for me, but for all the girls of my country, because as 
 
 there are so many causes to fight for and the news headlines change very fast, the attention from the girls of Afghanistan swept by really quickly.
 
And I think this award serves as a reminder -- and my song that I performed that should serve as a reminder for all -- people all over the world, not 
 
 to forget about the girls of Afghanistan, because it's been three years that they haven't been going to school. And I think the significance of 
 
 that award is just that for me.
 
CHATTERLEY:  I understand. And in many ways, one could argue you're one of the lucky ones because you left, you've been able to continue your 
 
 education now in Canada, but you also went through a traumatic time. You and your family fled. You were in Pakistan for a while. And now, as I 
 
 mentioned, you're in Canada. What's your message? And I think you do this so incredibly well through your singing and through your advocacy now. 
 
 What's your message to the girls and to the women back home whose voices have been suppressed in the past three years?
 
IBRAHIMI:  Well, I think the biggest message that I have for all Afghan girls, whether they're in Afghanistan or outside, because I think, even for 
 
 the girls who are displaced like me, we do feel the pain of our sisters who are still in Afghanistan and banned from their basic rights.
 
It's to keep their hopes alive. Because, as I said in my speech in the award ceremony as well, and it was the main message behind the song as 
 
 well, it was that the current regime, they can implement new laws, they can restrict and ban girls from any kind of rights that they want, but they 
 
 can't take away the hope and they can't take away the dreams of these girls. And that's my main message to the girls of Afghanistan, and also, 
 
 that's the main message behind all the work that we do and "Her Story" as well, sharing the stories of other girls.
 
So, I think if -- yes, people can take away that message, I've done the -- I mean, my job.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes. Keep the hope alive. I mentioned in the introduction, the video of you singing that your brother shared on social media, and this was 
 
 even before you left Afghanistan and you managed, through that campaign, to prevent the suppression of young women, young girls, even being able to 
 
 sing in public.
 <br>[18:50:00]
 
What was that moment like when you realized you had a voice that you could use social media and actually you could change things at a very difficult 
 
 time?
 
IBRAHIMI:  It was a very big understanding for me and it was really hard to like actually take in and digest as a 13-year-old at that time. Because in 
 
 my head, I just thought, so, there's this new law that is going to impact my personal life, and it's not going to allow me to just pursue my hobbies 
 
 as a girl and just be allowed to sing in public.
 
And when I saw how much attention and support it got, I was surprised at first, but also, it was heartwarming to see the support not only from other 
 
 Afghan girls, but also from other countries who were doing interview requests and the fact that they covered this issue a lot was also a source 
 
 of pressure for the government of Afghanistan to ban this decision and reverse this decision.
 
And yes, I think that was the initial point in my journey that I thought, maybe I do want to be an activist. But also, there's another point that 
 
 comes. Yes -- that if you're born in Afghanistan -- activist.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes, it's such an important point. And even as a 13-year-old girl in such a difficult circumstance, you can be powerful. Nila, I know 
 
 your message is one of power in many respects and hope, as you said, but you also describe the pain, whether you're still there as a young woman, or 
 
 like you, somewhere else in the world and away from home. What's been the hardest part of this entire journey for you, and do you hope to go home one 
 
 day?
 
IBRAHIMI:  I think that's one of the most difficult questions for me. When it comes to thinking about going back, of course, it makes me emotional 
 
 because the hardest part for me was leaving everything behind because we left five days after the fall, which was August 15th. And we didn't know in 
 
 the morning of the 20th of August that we would be leaving in the afternoon. So, it was hurried. It was shocking. And I didn't have enough 
 
 time to process that once I'm leaving, I -- it's not guaranteed that I may come back.
 
So, definitely that was the hardest part for me. And I'm still not like trying to process that, but things in future me deciding whether I want to 
 
 go back or not, it really depends on the current regime and what's going to happen. But like I said, I will remain hopeful that one day I may be able 
 
 to.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Nila, thank you for your bravery and your passion and your advocacy. And I know one day I'm going to interview you because we talked 
 
 off camera as one of the most famous human rights lawyers in the world. I firmly believe it. Nila, we'll stay in touch.
 
IBRAHIMI:  Thank you.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Congratulations again on the prize and keep fighting. We're proud of you.
 
IBRAHIMI:  Thank you so much.
 
CHATTERLEY:  More "First Move" after this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:55:00]
 
CHATTERLEY:  Welcome back to the and finally, on "First Move." The sky certainly not the limit when it comes to Thanksgiving's festivities on 
 
 board the International Space Station. NASA astronauts are sending a message to everyone celebrating here on Earth with a glimpse into their out 
 
 of this world feast.
