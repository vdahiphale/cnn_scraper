THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: Hello, and welcome to the show. I`m Coy. This is CNN 10, the best 10 minutes in news because of you.
 
It`s Wednesday, May 8th. I`m looking forward to using one of your vocab words in today`s show. Lots of stellar submissions, so thank you for 
 
 boosting our vocabulary.
 
First up, we start in Israel, where the country`s military, known as the Israel Defense Forces, or IDF, has taken control of the Palestinian side of 
 
 the Rafah crossing. That`s a key point of entry for aid coming into Gaza. It`s located on the border with Egypt.
 
The assault began overnight on Tuesday with Israeli airstrikes on Rafah. Medical officials there say 23 people were killed. Soon after, the IDF 
 
 rolled tanks into the area, replacing Palestinian flags with Israeli flags.
 
This new offensive comes as ceasefire negotiations between Israel and the terror organization Hamas, which runs Gaza, have hit a snag. Hamas has 
 
 agreed to a deal that would require them to release 33 Israeli hostages taken during its October 7th assault on Israel. In exchange, Israel would 
 
 release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and pause the war for an indefinite period to allow for the rebuilding of Gaza. So far, Israel has 
 
 rejected the deal. The U.N. Secretary General is urging both sides to keep talking.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANTONIO GUTERRES, UNITED NATIONS SECRETARY-GENERAL: It would be tragic. If weeks of intense diplomatic activity for peace in Gaza yield no ceasefire, 
 
 no release of hostages, and a devastating offensive in Rafah. I reiterate my appeal for both parties to show the political courage and spare no 
 
 effort to secure an agreement now. To stop the bloodshed. To free the hostages. And to help stabilize a region which is still at risk of 
 
 explosion.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WIRE: Before moving into Rafah on Tuesday, Israel warned residents to evacuate. But earlier in the war, Israel had told Palestinians in northern 
 
 Gaza to flee south towards that city. So this new offensive is leaving people who originally fled to Rafah in dire circumstances with few options 
 
 on where to go. 
 
Next, we head to Oklahoma, where giant hail, hurricane force winds, and devastating tornadoes tore through parts of the state Monday night, killing 
 
 at least one person and injuring multiple others.
 
Tornadoes and inclement weather also causing considerable damage in Missouri and Tennessee. The residents of Barnsdall, Oklahoma, are all too 
 
 familiar with this kind of destruction. This tornado was the second in a little over a month to hit the small city with a population of about 1,000 
 
 people.
 
CNN`s Lucy Kafanov is on the ground to show us the damage up close.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
LUCY KAFANOV, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Behind me, a residential home. The parts that were built out of stone still sort of standing, but a lot of this no 
 
 longer livable. The family will have to find another place to live. As we walk over here, this was a garage structure that also was a part of this 
 
 property. And that tornado, the direct hit here, flattening this structure. I don`t know if you could see it behind me, but over there is a pickup 
 
 truck. It just gives you a sense of the scale of this destruction.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WIRE: This region is not yet out of the woods. Millions in the Midwest are still at risk of strong tornadoes ripping through the area, and millions 
 
 more are vulnerable to damaging storms. 
 
Boeing`s Starliner needs a do-over. We told you earlier this week that the new spacecraft was supposed to take off Monday night with astronauts on 
 
 board for the first time. But shortly before launch, there was an issue with the rocket that propels the capsule into space. CNN`s Kristin Fisher 
 
 explains what happened.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE AND DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT: About two hours before lifting off with two NASA astronauts, Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore on 
 
 top inside that Starliner spacecraft, the ground teams discovered an issue with an oxygen relief valve on the second stage of the Atlas V rocket. 
 
This is a valve that essentially releases some pressure from the oxygen, the liquid oxygen that`s building up in the tank. Liquid oxygen is one of 
 
 the propellants that fuels the Atlas V into space.
 
And so the United Launch Alliance says this is typically a pretty minor issue that they`ve experienced before. They know how to troubleshoot. If it 
 
 had only been a payload on top, a non-human payload, like satellites or something like that, they would have gone ahead and launched.
 
They say that those satellites would already be up in space now. But because this was the first time that they actually had people on top, the 
 
 first crewed test flight of Boeing`s Starliner spacecraft, they decided, out of an abundance of caution, to hold off.

WIRE: NASA and Boeing may try for another launch on Friday. When it does take off, the spacecraft is headed to the International Space Station, 
 
 where it will spend about a week before coming home. NASA is welcoming a second company with which it can partner on missions to the ISS. SpaceX has 
 
 already been flying astronauts there since 2020. 
 
In South Africa, rescue operations are underway in the city of George after a multi-story building collapse left dozens of people trapped under debris. 
 
 Rescue teams are working quickly to save as many people as possible.
 
At least 26 people have been pulled from the rubble, but dozens more are missing and at least six people have been killed. South Africa`s president 
 
 is offering his condolences to families who lost their loved ones. He`s also launching an investigation into the cause of the collapse in order to 
 
 help prevent something like this from happening in the future.
 
Ten second trivia. 
 
Which of these countries has the largest population in the world? The United States, India, China or Nigeria?
 
If you said India, then Indi-yeah, with more than 1.4 billion people, the South Asian nation edged out China last year as the world`s most populous 
 
 country, according to the U.N. 
 
India, the most populous country, has nearly a billion people who are eligible to vote. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seeking a third term in 
 
 office, but with a billion people, it`s not easy to keep track of who voted and who hasn`t. So India developed a special system. It involves purple 
 
 ink. CNN`s Ivana Scatola has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
IVANA SCATOLA, CNN DIGITAL VIDEO PRODUCER (voice-over): This purple mark has become a symbol of Indian elections. It`s painted on with something 
 
 called indelible ink, meaning it can`t be removed easily. The Indian Election Commission has used this practice for more than seven decades to 
 
 prevent fraud and duplicate votes.
 
When a voter arrives at the booth, the ink is painted onto the left index finger, leaving a stain.
 
K MOHAMMED IRFAN, MANAGING DIRECTOR OF MYSORE VARNISH AND PAINTS LIMITED: Right from the prime minister to the most common person, everybody flashes 
 
 their fingers, from celebrities, from film stars, everybody. That is a mark of democracy.
 
SCATOLA: Although it`s hard to remove, it does eventually wash off after around two weeks, depending on the person`s skin. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translation): It stays for approximately three days.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translation): It goes away slowly, slowly, on its own. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translation): Even if a person wants to take it off they can`t. 
 
SCATOLA: What makes the ink last this long is strictly confidential. It`s a secret formula that hasn`t changed since 1951. What we do know is that the 
 
 chemical compound silver nitrate is a key ingredient.
 
IRFAN: This formula comes in contact with the sunlight, it reacts with the skin and the color emerges.
 
SCATOLA: The company Mysore Varnish and Paints has the exclusive rights to make and distribute the liquid to polling booths across the entire country. 
 
 This year, the company has prepared 2.7 million ink vials, its largest order to date. Each vial contains enough ink to mark 700 voters.
 
IRFAN: Our ink is being used to mark every electorate. It is a very proud moment.

WIRE: Today`s story getting a 10 out of 10, is a peel good story. LaToya Keeling made some friends with two young bulls in a pasture next door by 
 
 doling out a bunch of bananas. Yes, they found the fruit appealing. But LaToya was utterly shocked when one of those incorrigible bulls busted 
 
 through the fence and showed up at her house. She called the police, who helped move the bull back to his farm, but not before milking the situation 
 
 for a few selfies. Here`s LaToya`s advice.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LATOYA KEELING: Don`t feed young bulls bananas. They`re like cats. They`ll come back.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WIRE: Now that`s a legen-dairy story. 
 
Congrats to Ms. Bozek`s class at Hardey Prep in Chicago. You are our #YourWordWednesday winner for incorrigible, an adjective meaning incapable 
 
 of being corrected, amended, or reformed. Well done. 
 
Our shout-out today goes to Mr. Godoy`s class from Shue-Medill Middle School in Newark, Delaware. We see you and go Tigers.
 
This shout-out goes to Aloha-Huber Park in Beaverton, Oregon. Thanks to Ms. Tofty`s class, the 7th graders there for requesting this shout-out. You 
 
 rock.
 
Rise up. Remember, the day doesn`t make you. You make the day. So let`s make it a great one, right? I`m Coy. This is CNN 10. And I`ll see you 
 
 tomorrow.
