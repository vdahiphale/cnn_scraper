THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Good morning, everyone. Happy Friday. This is CNN 10. I`m Omar Jimenez. I am so happy to be back. Just filling in for Coy 
 
 Wire today, though. You may make a surprise appearance in some way. You never know. But the news doesn`t take a day off. So let`s get right into 
 
 it. We`ve got a jampacked show for you. 
 
We begin in Sudan where there is a major humanitarian crisis that really isn`t getting enough attention. This all started when a war broke out in 
 
 April of last year, between Sudan`s army and a paramilitary group called the Rapid Response Forces or the RSF. 
 
Now, during the beginning stages of the war, the RSF took control of most of the country`s capital city of Khartoum, as well as Darfur, and other 
 
 regions in Western Sudan. Late last week, though, the Sudanese army claimed its first major advance in 10 months taking back part of the city of 
 
 Omdurman, but the RSF has disputed those claims. 
 
The effects of this war have created a tragic scene in Sudan where thousands have been killed in nearly 8 million people displaced. According 
 
 to the U.N. office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs, nearly 18 million people are facing acute hunger, as well as civilian infrastructure 
 
 and health facilities being destroyed. 
 
Internet blackouts have limited communication where many are unable to seek safe zones or access healthcare and banking services. Children have been 
 
 greatly impacted as well with some 19 million of them not attending school. The U.S. has determined that both sides of this conflict have committed war 
 
 crimes, but is holding the RSF responsible for crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing in Sudan. 
 
Now, I know that was a lot to take in, but we want to bring you the latest on this humanitarian crisis. So we`re going to turn now to international 
 
 correspondent, Larry Madowo.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Sudanese armed forces celebrate as they advance in Omdurman, the twin city of the capital 
 
 Khartoum. The army releasing these videos last week, seeing it as a win in its war against the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces.
 
In North Darfur, the agony of Sudan`s children, the youngest victims of a war that has raged for 10 months. This small clinic run by the aid group 
 
 Doctors Without Borders in the Zamzam camp is the only one for miles. A child dies every two hours here, the agency says, as a war has led to 
 
 catastrophic cases of malnutrition.
 
CHEICK TRAORE, EMERGENCY COORDINATOR, DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS:  We have over 200 patients every day waiting for treatment. And they are not coming 
 
 only within the camp, they are coming also from the surrounding area, seeking, looking for health care.
 
MADOWO (voice-over):  They are overwhelmed that these mothers and their children have nowhere else to go.
 
ASHIA ABUBAKER ADAM, DISPLACED SUDANESE MOTHER (through translator):  We are out of everything, even wheat. Now we just get insignificant amounts of 
 
 food to make it through the day. I have five children apart from this one.
 
MADOWO (voice-over):  Sudan has the world`s largest displacement crisis. The U.N. says as 15% of the population has fled their homes. Humanitarian 
 
 workers say it is not getting enough funding or attention.
 
MARY LOUISE EAGLETON, UNICEF SUDAN DEPUTY REPRESENTATIVE:  And feels like the country has really been abandoned and the children and the country`s 
 
 children have really been abandoned. What this means for families and children is that they`re facing a lethal combination of displacement, 
 
 hunger and disease outbreaks.
 
TOBY HARWARD, U.N. DEPUTY HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR FOR SUDAN:  It is arguably the biggest humanitarian crisis today. It is bigger than the other 
 
 crisis that gets a lot more attention.
 
MADOWO (voice-over):  Everything is in short supply in Sudan, and a ceasefire appears unlikely. Those caught in the middle of another war worry 
 
 and the wait.

JIMENEZ:  Now, for our next story, we head to Europe where the European commission recently announced a very ambitious goal to help cut down planet 
 
 heating pollution and carbon emissions. But some people are not on board with this proposal, our International Climate Editor, Angela Dewan 
 
 explains.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANGELA DEWAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CLIMATE EDITOR:  The European Union recently announced one of the world`s most ambitious goals to tackle 
 
 climate change. It wants to cut 90% of its carbon pollution by 2040, that`s from 1990 levels. There`s a lot standing in their way. Farmers, for 
 
 example, have been protesting for months against some of the E.U. strongest climate policies, because they say it`s too hard to keep food growing for 
 
 their people if they have to do these new measures, like using certain types of fertilizers.
 
Auto makers, for example, don`t want to phase out combustion engine cars quite as quickly as the European Union does. They want to get rid of 
 
 combustion engine cars by 2035. And a lot of countries are saying that`s too soon. 
 
Another sticking point is defense. So Ursula von der Leyen, and the President of the E.U. announced she`s going to run for reelection. She made 
 
 climate center of her agenda in her last term, but this term climate was largely missing from her agenda speech. And that`s largely because defense 
 
 has really taken over the climate agenda in the last few months. 
 
So what happens next? The E.U. is notorious for taking months and months to get legislation finalized. This is going to be up to a year of talks to 
 
 discuss exactly how to reach this 90% target. And while there`s broad support for that target in the current parliament, that all may change in 
 
 June. There are elections coming up and the greens parties are expected to lose a lot of their seats to conservatives and even far right parties, that 
 
 may not be so progressive and ambitious on climate. 
 
So what that will look like in the future? We`ll see.

JIMENEZ:  All right, everybody. Ten second trivia.
 
Which country became the first European nation to establish a national parks system. 
 
Is it England, Sweden, France, or Germany? 
 
If you said Sweden, shout it from the nearest mountain top, it is Sweden. In 1909, the country designated nine areas of its country as national park, 
 
 the first nation to do so in Europe. 
 
All right, speaking of Sweden, that`s where some we`re going to call them, brave, young students are taking a school course in a chilling situation. 
 
 Quite literally, dozens of children, fully clothed are jumping into this frigid lake. Is this an ice sponge challenge? No, it`s actually part of the 
 
 elementary school curriculum where it teaches kids survival training on what to do if they ever fall through the ice from one of the many lakes in 
 
 the country.
 
As you see students with big backpacks, strapped on, learn how to use ice spikes to help pull themselves out of the icy waters. These classes are 
 
 gaining attention now with a rise in ice incidents in the country. 
 
All right, as you know, today is Friday and we couldn`t let you go the whole week without getting at least some FaceTime from our very own Coy 
 
 Wire. Recently, Coy had a chance to speak with a bunch of celebrities who graciously offer some tips for success specifically for you. Check this 
 
 out. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What`s that one secret to success?
 
GARY VAYNERCHUK, ENTREPRENEUR:  Not judging yourself too early. You know, everybody wants everything so fast out, you know, and the reality is real 
 
 stuff takes time.
 
JELLY ROLL, MUSICIAN: The seeds you plant today will grow in 10 years if you water them for the next 10 years. And that`s the mistake people make, 
 
 they plant seeds and they forget to water them. They think, well, no, I planted that seed. That should be growing. No, no, you got to water. Every 
 
 single day for all 10 years.
 
PEYTON MANNING, RETIRED QUARTERBACK:  Have goals, have dreams and work hard to accomplish those goals.
 
JOE BURROW, NFL QUARTERBACK:  Focus on the process, don`t focus on results.
 
NE-YO, MUSICIAN:  Whoever you are, once you figure out who you are, just be that person regardless to anyone else`s opinion, regardless of what anybody 
 
 else says or thanks. You are not built to blend in, blend out by all means.
 
CEEDEE LAMB, NFL WIDE RECEIVER:  Follow your mind, follow your passion and follow your own dreams. Don`t let no one negate it. Tell you otherwise, 
 
 believe in yourself and work hard. 
 
WIRE:  I love that.
 
MANNING:  You are a 10 out 10.
 
ROLL:  You are a 10 out 10.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALES:  You are a 10 out 10.
 
NE-YO:  You are a 10 out 10, salute.

JIMENEZ:  What a great way to end the week. Thank you Coy for grabbing those interviews and thank you all for letting me guest host this amazing 
 
 show. Coy will be back next week. Don`t worry.
 
But before I go, I got to shout out some of you. I`m looking at you, Barret Traditional Middle school in Louisville, Kentucky. Keep climbing  
 
 Hilltoppers. 
 
Also, I want to shout out Delaware Valley High School in Milford, Pennsylvania. Thank you for making this show special. Have a great weekend. 
 
 And until next time, thank you for letting me be part of the CNN 10 family.
