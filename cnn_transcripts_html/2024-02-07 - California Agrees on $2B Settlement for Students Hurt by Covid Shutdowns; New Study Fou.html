COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: Hello, lovely people. I`m Coy Wire here in Las Vegas. And so glad to spend this Wednesday, hump day with you. Welcome to 
 
 CNN 10, your CNN 10, especially on a #YourWordWednesday. See if your vocab word made today`s show. 
 
We`re going to start today in California, where a settlement will steer 2 billion to help students who fell behind in their education during the 
 
 pandemic. Our Nick Watt has more for us on why parents, students, and community groups sued for this money and how it`ll be used.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NICK WATT, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: With this settlement, you know, you`re not -- no one`s cutting you a check.
 
KELLY R., LAWSUIT PLAINTIFF: No.
 
WATT: You`re not getting any money?
 
KELLY R.: I have not, but I`m hoping that the kids will benefit. All kids will benefit from this.
 
WATT (voice-over): Kelly R., still struggling to help her kids catch up in math, is among the parents, teachers, kids and community groups who sued 
 
 California and won a settlement.
 
The state just agreed to spend $2 billion on tutors, extended school days, mental health support, and more for kids who suffered most during remote 
 
 learning, predominantly low-income black and Latino kids, who are now not bouncing back as fast as kids in whiter more-affluent districts.
 
MARK ROSENBAUM, ATTORNEY: The most pressing crisis in America today is what happened to kids during COVID. And hopefully, this settlement will be a 
 
 model for 49 other states.
 
WATT: During COVID, Kelly`s kids at least had a parent who tried her best and some Internet. 
 
KELLY R.: Their computers were glitchy. So then that`s when I would have to at that point, go over some of their lessons with them, while I`m working 
 
 from home.
 
WATT: In California, around 10,000 schools were closed.
 
ROSENBAUM: There were between 800,000 to a million kids who had no digital access whatsoever. What does that mean? It doesn`t mean they got bad 
 
 education means they got no education.
 
WATT: School-age kids were among those at lowest risk of serious illness from COVID-19 but suffered a lot from the restrictions to stem the spread.
 
THOMAS KANE, PROFESSOR, HARVARD UNIVERSITY: We`re asking poor kids to pay for the public health measures that were meant to, you know, benefit us 
 
 all.
 
WATT: Professor Thomas Kane and colleagues at Harvard, Stanford, and Dartmouth found many more affluent kids have already regained a lot of the 
 
 learning they lost during COVID. But --
 
KANE: In some places, like here in Massachusetts, the high-poverty districts did the opposite of catching up last year. They actually lost 
 
 additional ground.
 
WATT: Some they fear might never catch up, given what was lost during COVID and systemic educational inequities that existed long before we had ever 
 
 heard of COVID-19.
 
(On camera): As a white guy, I`ve always kind of, you know, assumed possibly rightly that my kids are going to get a fair shake. But as a black 
 
 parent, do you feel differently than, you know, you are at a disadvantage?
 
KELLY R.: We are at a dis -- and that`s one of them major reasons why I felt like this was important because we cannot continue to let things like 
 
 does happen and let our kids fall short. I`m hopeful that this will make a huge impact.
 
WATT: You say you`re hopeful?
 
KELLY R.: Yes.
 
WATT: I sensed a slight tinge of doubt.
 
KELLY R.: It hasn`t happened yet. So I could just be hopeful in the -- until it happens.

WIRE: Ten second trivia.
 
Which stage of life is ADHD or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, usually first diagnosed?
 
Childhood, teen years, adulthood or elderly?
 
According to the CDC, ADHD is usually first diagnosed in childhood, but often last into adulthood. 
 
All right, if you`re a TikTok user, you might have seen mental health pop up as a popular topic on the platform. But as your teachers might tell you, 
 
 don`t always trust what you see online. Researchers from the University of British Columbia studied the most popular TikTok videos about the 
 
 neurodevelopmental disorder, ADHD, and found that more than half of them contained misleading information. 
 
CNN`s Lacey Russell explains why you might want to astute those videos, that claim that they can help you self-diagnose.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KELLY B., TIKTOKER: Five less well-known ADHD behaviors with doodles. Let`s go. Number one, listening to the same song on repeat until you are -- 
 
LACEY RUSSELL, CNN PRODUCER: If you`ve seen videos like this or this, chances are that you`ve wondered into the world of ADHD TikTok. ADHD or 
 
 Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders in childhood. According to the CDC, people 
 
 with ADHD may be hyperactive or have trouble paying attention or controlling impulsive behaviors. 
 
Dr. Anthony Yeung is a Clinical Psychiatrist with the University of British Columbia and has a particular interest in ADHD. He and his colleagues 
 
 became intrigued when they started to notice an influx of patients seeking help for their focus and concentration. All of which coincided he says with 
 
 the rising popularity of so-called ADHD TikTok. 
 
So Yeung and his team set out to look at what kind of information was being shared, what they found was shocking. More than half of the top 100 most 
 
 popular videos at the time about ADHD contained misleading information.
 
DR. ANTHONY YEUNG, CLINICAL PSYCHIATRIST, UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA: I think the whole conversation around mental health, of course, has changed 
 
 for the better, in the sense that people are actually quite open and honest about talking about their individual struggles. 
 
AMILY ANNE, TIKTOKER: I don`t know why I`m crying.
 
YEUNG: But the challenge or the flip side of it is that it almost becomes, talked about term in the popular sphere where clinical terms might start to 
 
 get misused. For example, there was one video that talked about object permanence in ADHD.
 
OLIVIA LUTFALLAH, TIKTOKER: Remember we talked about how I have ADHD, so I also have object permanence issues. Yeah, it`s like an out of sight out to 
 
 mind thing. 
 
YEUNG: The term object permanence really has nothing much to do with ADHD. Object permanence is really a more fundamental developmental concept for 
 
 babies. And it`s really whether or not the babies understand that people still exist. If you can`t see them or hear them. There`s another term 
 
 that`s very commonly used something called like rejection sensitivity dysphoria. 
 
DR. SHAWN: Yeah, did you know that 100% of people with ADHD experience rejection sensitivity dysphoria goes what`s that -- 
 
YEUNG: And if you actually really dive down into even where this term came from, it`s a term proposed by one -- one psychiatrist, but it`s not a 
 
 universally accepted term and it`s certainly not a term, that I would say the vast majority of psychiatrists use.
 
RUSSELL: Yeung worries that for people who have ADHD, the trend of self- diagnosis could potentially lead to more stigmatization of the condition around, 10% of children in the U.S. have been diagnosed with ADHD, the CDC 
 
 estimates. 
 
YEUNG: This has happened historically in the past where people would more commonly say things like I`m so OCD, I`m so bipolar. 
 
KRISTY LEE, TIKTOKER: I am so ADHD. 
 
YEUNG: If everybody starts identifying themselves as having ADHD, you know, if like 10% becomes 20%, becomes 30 becomes 50, becomes 60%, then really 
 
 what is the disorder that we`re talking about here where are we drawing the line.

WIRE: All right today`s story getting a 10 out of 10. We`ve got a story that`s a bit of a catastrophe. At least for a judge at a cat show in Mesa, 
 
 Arizona. One particular cat in the show got a bit perplexed on the judge got more than she bargained for. Our Jeanne Moos takes us inside the black 
 
 cat, smacked down.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JEANNE MOOS, CNN NATIONAL NEWS CORRESPONDENT: They get stroked. They get lifted. They get stretched. They get their tails touched. No wonder a two-
 
 year-old named Ludwig von Beethoven lost his composure. He even slapped the judge. Veteran Judge Vicki Nye says she fondly refers to the video -- 
 
VICKI NYE, JUDGE, CAT`S FANCIERS` ASSOCIATION: -- is the black cat smack down.
 
MOOS: The pedigreed show cats are accustomed to the commotion of a show like this one in Mesa, Arizona organized by the Cat Fanciers` Association. 
 
 But Beethoven was a first timer competing in the household pet category.
 
NYE: That one was just terrifying. When you see the eyes going like that.
 
MOOS: And, though, Vicki gave him plenty of compliments,
 
NYE: Beautiful coat, shiny, nice green eyes.
 
MOOS: Beethoven turned on her, though, the judge didn`t even get scratched. 
 
NYE: I need the owner now.
 
MOOS: Contestant 177 in the background was freaked. Did you actually attack a judge? Vicki says she`s only been bitten twice in 35 years of judging. 
 
OK. So this slap may not compare with say the famous Oscar slap as for Beethoven. 
 
(On camera): So this cat did not get a ribbon?
 
NYE: No, this -- that kitty was actually disqualified.
 
MOOS: His owner said, sorry, but for the feline Beethoven, the Cat Show see more cacophony than symphony.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
WIRE: Looks like this Beethoven, couldn`t compose himself.
