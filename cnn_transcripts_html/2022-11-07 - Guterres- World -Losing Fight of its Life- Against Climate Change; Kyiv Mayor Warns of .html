<br>[09:00:00]
 
JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNNI HOST: A warm welcome to "First Move". It's fantastic to have you with us. We kick off another important week for global markets 
 
 U.S. politics, as well as the fight to protect our planet. The opening ceremony at the UN Climate Conference, COP 27 began with a stark warning 
 
 from the UN Secretary General saying we're on a "Highway to climate hell".
 
Now the challenge is only exacerbated of course by the spending splurge during the COVID pandemic and the energy crisis following the war in 
 
 Ukraine. Climate justice though too in the spotlight, with developing nations hard hit by the global warming crisis, they say they did not create 
 
 and they're asking the industrialized world for billions of dollars in compensation to help them adapt.
 
We can't separate the burden of course of climate change too, on global health systems. We'll hear from Dr. Vanessa Kerry, the Co-Founder and CEO 
 
 of Seed Global Health, who says the medical community, has barely begun to plan for the climate emergencies to come.
 
In the meantime, the market climate cautious after last week's sharp losses and with political risk, of course, ahead with the U.S. midterm elections, 
 
 polls show control of the Senate still up for grabs investors hoping above all, I think for a clean and quick outcome.
 
And tech travels remain in the spotlight too after the NASDAQ 5 percent tumble last week. The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Meta, the 
 
 parent company of Facebook is about to lay off thousands of workers as the company grapples with a serious advertising sales slowdown and of course, 
 
 growing uncertainty over its Metaverse moonshot spending as we've discussed on the show.
 
Now add to that Apple warning of an iPhone delivery pressures as driven by China's COVID restrictions at the Foxconn manufacturing plant. We don't 
 
 really get a sense yet of the scale of that. But in the meantime, Asia is higher, even as China pushes back on speculation that those zero COVID 
 
 policies might soon ease.
 
Goldman Sachs today saying Beijing is still "Months away from any zero COVID walk back". So a busy show as always, let's begin with the latest 
 
 from the COP 27 Summit in Egypt and Becky Anderson, is there for us, Becky, great to have you with us! And I think the UN Secretary General laid out 
 
 the scale of the challenge really well.
 
BECKY ANDERSON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: He did absolutely. This the latest installment in the global effort to flight climate change, the meeting 
 
 underway here in Sharm-el-Sheikh and as you rightly pointed out, it kicked off with a grim warning from the Head of the United Nations here at COP 27.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANTONIO GUTERRES, U. N. SECRETARY-GENERAL: And the clock is ticking. We are in the fight of our lives and we are losing. Greenhouse gas emissions keep 
 
 growing. Global temperatures keep rising. And our planet is fast approaching tipping points that will make climate chaos irreversible. We 
 
 are on a highway to climate hell without food still on the accelerator.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, let's be very clear here. This is a meeting hosted by Egypt which is set to highlight the very real challenges faced by the global 
 
 south in adapting to and mitigating the effects of climate change. Because let's be clear, just forcing change on poor countries won't work without 
 
 providing financing to catalyze a real transition to cleaner energy.
 
There is also the very thorny and contentious issue of how to compensate poor countries for the loss and damage of climate change in Pakistan no 
 
 better example of that. We've seen obviously the enormous impact of the derby floods just this summer. I want to start though, with Eleni who's 
 
 with me here because South Africa is an incredibly good example of the sort of impact that change as we pivot from dirty energy to clean energy can 
 
 have on a country and its population.
 
ELENI GIOKOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: To be honest, Becky, I think the biggest news out of COP 26 was South Africa's commitment to decommission coal fired 
 
 power stations and to move away from call. $8.5 billion dollars was pledged last year.
 
Now, you know, the question is how is that money going to be implemented? That's always the problem is actually getting the money on the ground. I 
 
 grew up in a coal mining town in South Africa everyone in my elders was in some way exposed to the coal mining industry.
 <br>[09:05:00]
 
GIOKOS: I went back to speak to the coal miners to see their reality because it might be a climate emergency which we all face. But for them, 
 
 it's a question of survival today.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
GIOKOS (voice over): Community living in the shadows of power lines, with no access to the electricity that towers above them, water that arrives in 
 
 trucks, and using coal, as their main source of energy.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You can't do anything - it's expensive, gas is expensive. Then after--
 
GIOKOS (voice over): For Martha, everything comes from this cold stove. The food, heat and the dirty air they breathe.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Some of them they have got TB and asthma because we're using this--
 
GIOKOS (voice over): A home a microcosm of South Africa's dilemma, an abundance of coal and the most unequal country in the world that's dealing 
 
 with the crippling power crisis 34 percent unemployment with the potential of cleaner sources of energy. For many like Martha living here, the thought 
 
 of abandoning coal means more economic hardship.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We're going to be paid. I don't want to lie many people have lost their job because of those contracts.
 
GIOKOS (voice over): We're in Witbank, known as - it means the place of coal in the - language. This is also where I grew up. Mining has been going 
 
 on here since 1890. Greenpeace says it's the most polluted place on Earth. Than Palmer Langer Province have the world's highest nitrogen dioxide 
 
 levels.
 
GIOKOS (on camera): I wish you could smell this. It's so far it's rotten egg. This is how you know you've arrived in Witbank.
 
GIOKOS (voice over): My first stop the National Union of Mineworkers Offices.
 
MALEKUTU BIZZAH MOTUBATSE, HIGHVELD CHAIRPERSON, NATIONAL UNION OF MINEWORKERS: We can say 80 percent, if not 90 are working at the mines.
 
GIOKOS (voice over): 90 percent of South Africa's electricity comes from coal. The majority of power stations and mines are here in Mpumalanga. Now, 
 
 the wheels of change are turning during COP 26 South Africa committed to transitioning away from coal. The country's Minister of Mineral Resources 
 
 and Energy has an ominous warning for the fate of 10 towns.
 
GWEDE MANTASHE, SOUTH AFRICAN MINISTER OF MINERAL RESOURCES &amp; ENERGY: Those are the owners of the coal mining belt which is the home of a number of 
 
 questions and if you can just read it off once. That means you've got a culture written.
 
GIOKOS (on camera): It is the end of an era for Komati power station that was built in the early 1960s. And it is the first of South Africa's aging 
 
 coal fired power plants to be decommissioned. By the time you see this it'll be completely switched off.
 
ANGEL MOKWENA, DAUGHTER OF KOMATI EMPLOYEE: My dad works.
 
GIOKOS (voice over): Angel Mokwena is dealing with the uncertainty firsthand.
 
GIOKOS (on camera): How does it feel that your father might lose his job? Are you scared?
 
MOKWENA: If it doesn't work, who's going to provide for us?
 
GIOKOS (voice over): As Komati employees leave the plant on its final days they do so knowing they will also be left jobless.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When this come to close everything's finished.
 
GIOKOS (voice over): Eskom is repurposing Komati to solar and wind with no start date announced.
 
GIOKOS (on camera): Just transition do you understand what that means?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, no - I don't understand.
 
GIOKOS (on camera): They didn't tell you at the mines Eskom--
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not anyone came.
 
GIOKOS (on camera): Do you know that the coal mining industry is going to be over?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No we didn't know.
 
GIOKOS (on camera): Do you understand that South Africa is trying to transition out of coal.
 
UNIDENTIFID MALE: I haven't heard anything yet.
 
GIOKOS (voice over): The West hypocrisy when it comes to re-firing up coal plants because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine hasn't gone unnoticed.
 
KOPI MATSHASHA, NUM BRANCH CHAIR, MIDDLEBURG MINE COLLIERY: We are not foreign to clean energy. But we are saying it is premature for us to move 
 
 to clean energy.
 
GIOKOS (voice over): The people living here face a stark future. They can literally smell, taste and touch the danger all around them. But can they 
 
 survive, if it is taken away?
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON: Eleni reporting there. She's with me here at COP. There's a very basic question here. Can you replace the jobs lost in the coal industry by 
 
 those in clean energy?
 
GIOKOS: It's such an important question. It's probably the most important question for people that I spoke to. And some of them as you saw, had never 
 
 heard of the transition away from coal. I spoke to one coal mining CEO that is investing in renewables and he says we have to be realistic. It's not 
 
 doable. One to one is not doable.
 
The multiplier effect of the coal mining industry is you know, obviously you've got the coal mines feeding coal into the coal fired power plants. 
 
 It's a fuel depot, it's the guys that are contractors, supplying all sorts of services to the coal mining industry and can they then be replaced in 
 
 renewable?
 <br>[09:10:00]
 
GIOKOS: South Africa says it's got a plan but these little faiths in incrimination thereof. And I have to say this, Becky, you know, seeing the 
 
 faces of the people that I spoke to, they already are living in dire circumstances, many people support 7 to 10 family members. And there is 
 
 this huge fear.
 
You know, when I was living in the coal mining sector, in the industry, my dad had a little shop. And when the coal mine reached the end of life, they 
 
 demolished everything, and we lost everything, right? But we were able to recover.
 
A lot of these people face demolitions of where they live. So if a coal mine shuts down, what will happen? What is the plan? And that is the big 
 
 question that the National Union of Mineworkers has, and the people on the ground as well.
 
ANDERSON: So it's fascinating, isn't it? The point being you know, you can get world leaders and leaders from the world of business and finance all 
 
 gathered at a summit like this as they did in Glasgow committing to the end of coal as a dirty fuel as it were, for the impact on people.
 
The promises are made that promises are out there. This is about growth. This is about jobs going forward in a sort of a world of energy transition, 
 
 but the issues are really, really real?
 
GIOKOS: And the one, you know, African Finance Corporation, Head Executive said to me Eleni, how are you going to ask a woman or a family to not chop 
 
 down a tree to cook for their family or not burn coal to cook for their family?
 
Here's the number. 600 million people in Africa right now don't have access to reliable electricity. So you've got energy poverty that needs to be 
 
 married with the climate emergency and finding solutions that will in some way, lead to a better and cleaner and greener future and really money. 
 
 That's the money issue that comes up?
 
ANDERSON: The challenge is a very real, Eleni thank you. Julia global leaders in the world of business and finance have a very real challenge 
 
 here, against what is very challenging backdrop of a war in Ukraine, and the resulting energy crisis.
 
So we hear more about energy security than we do about energy transition, right? The world needs to come up with some very real solutions to ensure 
 
 the prospect of an energy transition that is affordable. And there's Eleni pointed out a realistic option for people living in a country like South 
 
 Africa, the challenges are very, very real.
 
That's not to say that there aren't solutions out there, we've got to drill down on these solutions and hold those who are providing them to account 
 
 Julia.
 
CHATTERLEY: Couldn't agree more. Vast challenges and to your point, we don't talk enough about transition, never mind investing in renewable, it's 
 
 about as Eleni was sort of beautifully pointing out the challenges of getting from A to B. Both of you thank you, and we'll be back with you 
 
 later on in the show.
 
For now, let's move on and talk about Ukraine, the Mayor of Kyiv warning people to prepare for the complete loss of electricity, water and heating 
 
 amid Russian missile attacks. People in cities across the country have had water and power supplies knocked out in recent weeks as Russian forces 
 
 target key infrastructure.
 
Officials implementing scheduled blackouts today to conserve energy supplies. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz it's across it and in Kyiv for us too. 
 
 Salma good to have you with us! I saw President Zelenskyy saying around four and a half million people are still dealing with those blackouts as 
 
 they try and repair infrastructure. And the big fear is that Kyiv Mayor pointed out is when they're knocked out again, it is an ongoing battle?
 
SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, and many of those suffering are right here in the capital right here in Kyiv. Let me just explain to the 
 
 situation overall, for hours every day families have no electricity, no power, there's these scheduled outages.
 
They last three to four hours. They happened a couple of times a day, if there is a huge energy deficit than they might extend those hours. So it's 
 
 not uncommon to hear of a family going half a day without any energy without any electricity to heat up their home or make a warm meal or light 
 
 their living rooms.
 
And what is concerning is what you've pointed out there. This infrastructure, the country's civilian infrastructure is so fragile, so 
 
 weak now that any missile that lands is going to cause really huge devastation.
 
So authorities are preparing for the worst case scenario, essentially a complete collapse of the energy system if Russia continues to target the 
 
 infrastructure. They're setting up emergency services, emergency spaces for families to go to in every single district.
 
The Mayor of Kyiv has even said if you have family that live outside the city with running electricity, maybe consider with staying with them for a 
 
 while. He went so far as to say that he believes Russia wants Ukrainians to freeze to death this winter.
 
And yes, you absolutely can see that that's the motivation behind the targeting of civilian infrastructure is really to ramp up the cost of 
 
 civilian suffering to really make sure that even far from the frontlines families really feel the impact of this war.
 <br>[09:15:00]
 
ABDELAZIZ: But if you really take a step back, Julia I think it also shows a sign of weakness from the Kremlin, the fact that civilian infrastructure 
 
 is being targeted rather than focusing on the battlefield. That's why you hear so many Ukrainians say yes, we are suffering yes, this is difficult, 
 
 but we continue to stand together. This is only making us stronger in the face of these Russian assaults Julia.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes, hardening the resolve for now. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz in Kyiv there for us, thank you! China's zero COVID policy taking a bite out 
 
 of Apple. The company morning production of the latest iPhones will be temporarily impacted. As its supplier Foxconn factory continues to be under 
 
 lockdown measures.
 
Selina Wang joins us now on day eight, I believe now of the 10 day quarantine in Beijing. Selina you're almost there. Talk to us about what 
 
 Apple is saying? We would expect there to be some impact on supplies given the challenges of operations within that Foxconn factory.
 
But in the backdrop here, were hopes that we were talking about last week of perhaps some easing of those measures. The Health Ministry coming out 
 
 over the weekend and saying nothing's changing for now.
 
SELINA WANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, thanks, Julia for reminding me. I just got a few days left. But look what Apple is saying here is if you're 
 
 planning to buy the new iPhone 14 Pro or Pro Max well, you're going to have to wait a little bit longer to get those new products because the latest 
 
 lineup of products are being impacted by these COVID restrictions in China.
 
This doesn't come as a surprise given the lock downs and the COVID situation in Zhengzhou which is where Apple's biggest iPhone assembly 
 
 facility is located where analysts estimate that up to 85 percent of the iPhone capacity is running for that assembly.
 
So Apple is saying that the capacity there has been significantly reduced. Apple here is really just the latest victim to China's zero COVID policies. 
 
 Chinese businesses, global businesses, they're all being hit by this endless cycle of lockdowns, quarantines, mass testing, taking a massive and 
 
 growing toll on the economy and on people's lives.
 
And since mid-October, that factory in Zhengzhou, has been struggling to deal with a COVID outbreak. Last week we talked about those viral videos 
 
 showing migrant workers fleeing the factory trying to get away from those COVID restrictions walking miles on highways to try and get back to their 
 
 homes.
 
And last week, authorities also imposed a seven day lockdown over the area there are houses there are factories so, all of this putting huge pressure 
 
 on Apple and its major supplier Foxconn right before this key holiday shopping season.
 
Now we also talked about last week how there were these unfounded rumors that China was going to start to exit its zero COVID policy. Investors they 
 
 are desperate for any piece of good news that those rumors caused a big share jump.
 
However, authorities this weekend they quashed those rumors and oppressor they said China is unwaveringly sticking to zero COVID. We are seeing 
 
 authorities double down on this policy with more lockdowns, more mass testing more quarantines, protests even breaking out in some areas, 
 
 including Tibet, in Lhasa, Tibet where they've been locked down for three months.
 
This is continuing and year three of the pandemic it means that China is a less attractive place for foreign investment. It means that this country is 
 
 getting more and more isolated as well Julia.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes, pressuring growth and of course, the knock on impact too to things like jobs and social cohesion challenged. Selina, great to have 
 
 you with us thank you so much for that!
 
OK, straight ahead a dynamic duo fighting for a better world while John Kerry pushes for progress at COP 27 his daughter is working to strengthen 
 
 health systems across Africa. Dr. Vanessa Kerry is up next.
 
And later on the show Twitter terminal 2.0 or 20.0 depending on how you choose to look at it after a dramatic big breakup? Is Elon Musk trying to 
 
 make up with some of Twitter's former staff we'll discuss stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:20:00]
 
CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to "First Move". Fighting climate change is not just about saving the planet; it's also about protecting our health. The 
 
 World Health Organization has reported that less than 1 percent of multilateral climate finance is currently directed to health related 
 
 projects.
 
Well, our next guest says investing in health systems around the world is essential to economic and social well-being as well as national security. 
 
 And that includes protection against climate related shocks by investing in our healthcare workforces.
 
The W.H.O. also estimates there will be a shortfall of 18 million health workers by 2030. Now for the past 10 years Seed Global Health has been 
 
 working to strengthen those health systems since its founding. It has partnered with four countries Malawi, Sierra Leone, Uganda and Zambia and 
 
 30 institutional partners.
 
The organization has placed over 200 physicians, nurse and midwife educators and taught nearly 28,000 trainees. And I'm pleased to say joining 
 
 us now is Dr. Vanessa Kerry, Co-Founder and CEO of Seed Global Health. She's also a critical care doctor and Director of the Global Public Policy 
 
 and Social Change Program at Harvard Medical School.
 
She also happens to be the daughter of Former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. Dr. Kerry Vanessa, wonderful to have you on the show! That was a bit 
 
 of a long introduction, forgive me, but I love the name and the idea of seeding communities across Africa with the information and knowledge and 
 
 support to help them protect their communities. Just start there by explaining what you do and how it works?
 
DR. VANESSA KERRY, CO-FOUNDER AND CEO, SEED GLOBAL HEALTH: Thank you very much for having me join us especially this really critical moment in time. 
 
 Seed Global Health was really founded to partner with governments and institutions in Africa to ensure that they have the strong robust, just 
 
 strong health systems they need to be able to meet the health challenges that they see.
 
And so over the last decade, we have partnered with governments in Sub Saharan Africa and with hospitals and training institutions to train 
 
 actually now close to 40,000, doctors, nurses and midwives who are in service to close to 72 million people across the continent.
 
CHATTERLEY: This is astonishing. And in all of these countries, based on your work with governments with I know NGOs and those on the ground, it's 
 
 the focus seems to be of similar things. And it comes down to a greater need for maternal care for protection of newborns, protection of children, 
 
 in certain cases as well, mental health. Just talk us through how you've honed in on some of the key priorities.
 
KERRY: Of course, I think the reality is that it's 2022. And it is truly unacceptable. We have two such different standards of care in the world. A 
 
 woman in Sierra Leone has 50 times the chance of dying in childbirth than a woman say in my home country of the United States.
 
And we're fundamentally trying to change that. And so we do that by really identifying the most pressing health needs of the countries where we work 
 
 whether it is you know, pregnancy and child childbirth whether it is a child under five and the health issues they see with diarrhea or pneumonia 
 
 or malnutrition?
 <br>[09:25:00]
 
KERRY: Whether it is trauma? You know, the World Bank found in Uganda that over half the deaths in the country are from a failure of emergency and 
 
 triage services. And so we support training and rising generation of health professionals that can not only provide high quality care, but can stay and 
 
 continue to train so that we're really building out a network of health care providers that are in response to the people in these countries and 
 
 can make sure that woman in Sierra Leone doesn't die. And it's really about, frankly, challenging the status quo that we have allowed to be 
 
 really unacceptable for too long.
 
CHATTERLEY: Just reiterate that statistic, because it's just shocking. A woman in Sierra Leone 50 times more likely to die, giving birth than a 
 
 woman in the United States. I think if that doesn't illustrate the importance of the work that you're doing nothing will.
 
I think, and actually, it's becoming very clear if people are watching the video that we're showing of the sheer quantity of women that are being 
 
 shown here as healthcare workers. And there are sort of two ties here.
 
There's the importance of sort of protecting many of the women in these situations with these health care emergencies. But it's also that two 
 
 thirds of the healthcare workers themselves are women. So providing them with the essential skills and support in the work that they're doing helps 
 
 tackle the gender divide in a completely different way and in a vitally important way?
 
KERRY: Absolutely. 70 percent of healthcare is provided by women. And so we are really talking about our gender equity opportunity. And women, I 
 
 believe that statistic is about 3 billion of work in the healthcare sector goes unpaid.
 
And so there's an opportunity by investing in training a health workforce and investing in formalizing the sector in countries around the world to be 
 
 able to create jobs, to build economies to create gender equity.
 
And I think that it's, you know, most people don't realize, but there's very strong data between better health and better GDP growth, and or 
 
 whether a household lives above or below the poverty line?
 
And a lot of that is tied to creating jobs for women, a lot of that is tied to making an investment in somebody's their main asset, which is their 
 
 ability to go to work. And if you're not healthy, you cannot go to work. You cannot care for your family.
 
And so these investments in health are truly, you know, for lack of a better analogy, a tide that lifts all boats, and there's a huge opportunity 
 
 for us to recreate our worlds by investments in health.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's essential for functioning society for a healthy functioning society. And I don't just mean in health terms. Where did the 
 
 educators come from? How long do they stay? Where does the financing come from, because this is a critical part of it?
 
If those that are imparting their knowledge and providing wisdom and experience to those that are working in these communities, just give us a 
 
 sense of how that works, and crucially, where the money comes from?
 
KERRY: We are deeply privileged that we partner with ministers of health with governments in the places that we work. And we work together to 
 
 identify faculty to fill the faculty shortages. I'm sure many countries around the world you will find that there's a doctor and nurse and midwife 
 
 health provider that came from another country.
 
And in fact, it's estimated that they're, you know, the brain drain of physicians and nurses is left huge gaps in these countries. And so we 
 
 recruit folks to come back, they spend a year of their life serving alongside existing faculty to build up the faculty enough to be able to 
 
 continue training and ensuring that there is high quality mentorship in a clinical setting.
 
One of the things we do that are very different and that you just can't replace for telemedicine is that we teach at the bedside. And so when there 
 
 is a breech birth, you actually have somebody to be with you to guide you how to do it, and then it happens again.
 
You know, we've seen this time and time again, the power of saving lives, what it does to transform people's sense of hope, of optimism, of 
 
 understanding of what can be achieved? And so we do this entirely through philanthropic funding.
 
We all of our funding comes from foundations, and people who are willing to be on this journey and to really support it as well as now increasingly we 
 
 are building a coalition of folks that really are trying to give to this bigger effort writ large.
 
We've just announced in September, the Clinton Global Initiative $100 million commitment that we need to raise and work towards and with some of 
 
 our partners like AMREF and others to really be transformative and to invest in these health systems to make them stronger, more resilient.
 
Even after COVID-19 only 60 percent of countries have strong emergency preparedness response. That means 40 percent of our countries are left 
 
 completely vulnerable to another global pandemic. We have a lot of work that we need to do and we are going to be - we deeply believe that there's 
 
 no such thing as too ambitious for this moment that we're in.
 <br>[09:30:00]
 
KERRY: We have strong emergency preparedness response. That means 40 percent of our country are left completely vulnerable to another global 
 
 pandemic. We have a lot of work that we need to do and we're going to be - we deeply believe that there's no such thing as too ambitious for this 
 
 moment that we're in.
 
And that it is critically important that we invest in health to address the whole range of issues that we face, be it migration pandemics and the 
 
 ability to have a healthy workforce that can be investing in our better world.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes, I have about a minute left. But I mean, everything that you just said there in terms of the challenges are all exacerbated by the 
 
 impact of climate change that the need for migration, lower labor productivity, communities struggling to take care of themselves, never-mind 
 
 the you know, the need to be able to afford or pay for adequate decent health care. Vanessa, just tie it to your reason for being in court and 
 
 what you hope to achieve there?
 
KERRY: Absolute, thank you, I am here at COP because there is going to be a huge rise in death and suffering from climate change. We don't do anything 
 
 about it. And the ability to have a health center to investments in our climate response is going to be critically important.
 
And the workforce is critically needed to address that growing burden of disease that we're going to already see that we are to see 250,000 deaths a 
 
 year, 216 million people estimated to start migrating because of some of these problems. And so we have a critical need to ensure that we are 
 
 prepared and able to really see health as integrally tied to the climate crisis as well.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes, fundamental to saving lives. Dr. Vanessa Kerry, great to have you on and I know that we will speak again soon and please come back 
 
 and talk to us again, the Co-Founder and CEO of Seed Global Health Fair, thank you.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to "First Move" and global Investors out with their votes on the state of the U.S. stock market ahead of tomorrow's all 
 
 important U.S. midterm election vote to decide who controls congress. In the meantime U.S. stocks currently higher as you can see there in early 
 
 trades, the bulls hoping for some follow through after Friday's solid gains.
 <br>[09:35:00]
 
CHATTERLEY: Stocks, if you remember got an end of the week boost from that solid U.S. jobs market report. Investors perhaps positioning themselves 
 
 post midterm elections when stocks tend to do well, historically. At least Morgan Stanley today saying that it pays to stay bullish as voting gets 
 
 underway, that said we've got a major consumer inflation print coming on Thursday that will also help dictate the market direction, of course, the 
 
 direction the Federal Reserve heads into.
 
Now in other news re-united and it feels so good quality case of their breakup to make up or fired to rehired, we shouldn't really joke. But 
 
 reports say Twitter hopes to lower back some of the thousands of workers that were shown the door last week, or this is Elon Musk push his paws on 
 
 Twitter's new blue check verification feature.
 
Rahel Solomon joins us on this. Rahel, I can't keep up. So I'm glad I've got you here to do that. Talk to me about what we think happened here. He's 
 
 moved so fast on making changes, it's perhaps not surprising, some people will let go that they actually need.
 
RAHEL SOLOMON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Julia exactly. I think this really underscores the pace at which things are happening, because as you might 
 
 remember, it was just October 27, that Elon Musk actually took control of Twitter. And so some 10 days later, I mean, Twitter, of course, has let go.
 
Its top executive is Elon Musk has let go some of the top executives at Twitter, we know half the staff was laid off as of Friday. And then these 
 
 reports surfaced just days later that apparently, Elon Musk and some of the top at Twitter actually want some of these folks to come back.
 
And it is unclear at this point, Julia, if that's because these people were not supposed to be let go to begin with. Or if it was a big oops, actually, 
 
 we really might need you now I can tell you that we here at CNN have reached out to Twitter.
 
But here's something that's interesting, folks who we have communicated with before who we have worked with before. Well, those emails are bouncing 
 
 back implying that they too may have been let go. So it really just speaks to the dizzying pace at which things are happening.
 
And it is, of course unsettling, perhaps to the employees both presently and former, but also advertisers. And you're starting to hear big 
 
 advertisers start to pump the brakes and pull back as folks wonder what is going on inside of Twitter.
 
Some new features have also been unveiled, but then they've been pulled back including, as you mentioned, Julia of the blue check verification 
 
 program for $8 a month that on Saturday was unveiled in a launch and an update. But then we got word here at CNN that the sprint to our launch 
 
 continues.
 
But some folks may see us making updates because we are testing and pushing changes in real time, Julia again in real time, so things are happening 
 
 very quickly at Twitter and I would argue for some perhaps a bit too quickly.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes, I think for many, quite frankly and Rahel, to your point, that's the one of the joys I guess, of being a private company is that you 
 
 don't need to have such a substantial communications team because you're not communicating with Investors. But it will be good to have someone. 
 
 Rahel Solomon, thank you for that.
 
OK, coming up, we'll take you back to COP27 in Egypt. CNN's extensive coverage at the UN Climate Summit with Becky Anderson is up next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:40:00]
 
ANDERSON: Welcome back to Egypt, where the COP27 UN Climate Summit is underway. The crossroads of the Middle East and Africa providing adequate 
 
 funding for the global south to transition to cleaner energy is top of the agenda here as is the issue of compensating poor countries for the loss and 
 
 damage caused by this climate crisis.
 
Well, in his speech at today's opening ceremony, former U.S. Vice President Al Gore strongly criticized leaders in developed nations have a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
AL GORE, FORMER U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: We have a credibility problem all of us. We're talking and we're starting to act. But we're not doing enough. It 
 
 is a choice to continue this pattern of destructive behavior. We have other choices.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, taking action now making those choices now not next year, not 10 years from now, couldn't be more critical.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON (voice over): Never before seen rain in Pakistan, placing a third of the country underwater and killing over 1000 people and climate change 
 
 likely caused the disaster.
 
BILAWAL BHUTTO ZARDARI: Frankly, the people of Pakistan the citizens of Pakistan are paying the price in their lives and their livelihoods for the 
 
 industrialization of rich countries.
 
ANDERSON (voice over): Data from Oxfam shows that the richest 1 percent of the world is responsible for twice as many carbon emissions as the poorest 
 
 50 percent in the last century. Yet the poorest are often left to bear the brunt of climate change and pay a steep price.
 
Pakistan's biblical flooding has reignited the question of loss and damage to compensate developing countries for climate disasters. While a little 
 
 late, the EU and the U.S. say they now support discussions on financial compensation, a sign that the tone may shift at the COP27 climate 
 
 conference in Egypt.
 
JOHN KERRY, U.S. CLIMATE ENVOY: Simply put with respect to finance, we developed countries need to make good on the finance goals that we have 
 
 set. So Sharm el-Sheikh is another milestone for measurement, for accountability and for focus.
 
ANDERSON (voice over): And here's why that matters. Without adequate financial investment developing countries can't pivot away from fossil 
 
 fuels. But there has been some progress. Take the United States and the United Arab Emirates, for example, who recently signed a partnership aimed 
 
 at investing billions of dollars in clean energy industries, particularly in emerging economies.
 
The White House said, "to help bridge the gap, the two countries intend to work together to prioritize commercial projects in developing and low 
 
 income countries, as well as provide them technical and financial assistance". Poor countries will want to see similar pledges being made in 
 
 Sharm el-Sheikh where organizers are vowed to make climate financing a key focus.
 
MAHMOUD MOHIELDIN, U.N. CLIMATE CHANGE HIGH LEVEL CHAMPION FOR EGYPT: Climate finance is insufficient. I would say as well unfair and 
 
 inefficient, the reductionist approach that misled us all as global community that climate change and sustainability means only de-
 
 carbonization and dealing with the emissions had been misleading.
 
But we cannot ignore the impact of the decades and actually centuries of mismanagement of the nature in - harm to climate and the planet. If we're 
 
 not addressing these problems, we're going to be seeing more instability around the world.
 
What we need really to see this time that we need to shift from the weather and when questions into the house and the house all about finance.
 
ANDERSON (voice over): Finance, that's so important for countries like Pakistan which emits less than 1 percent of the world's planet warming 
 
 gases but is now faced with a $40 bill.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 <br>[09:45:00]
 
ANDERSON: We are on a highway to hell that the ominous warning from the UN Secretary General here earlier has he appealed for further efforts towards 
 
 net zero goals. But as my report just suggested, it's not just about emissions cutting targets, it's about a lot more it's about financing the 
 
 world is falling short, on the financial commitments made, for example, in 2015.
 
And the really contentious issue of how to compensate poor nations for loss and damage. Well, I put those two issues to European Commission President 
 
 Ursula Von Der Leyen. I started by asking you if the funding that's coming through is insufficient.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
URSULA VON DER LEYEN, EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESIDENT: It is insufficient. So we have to accelerate. And this COP27 now is about implementation. Here my 
 
 very clear messages from the European Union, we are on track. We have cast in law, our climate targets, not just put targets out, but cast them in 
 
 law, minus 55 percent to 2030 and climate neutral 2050. And now we have to accelerate. We've put forward I think, the most ambitious legislative 
 
 package now worldwide to achieve these goals.
 
ANDERSON: In 2015, the world signed up to $100 billion a year funds for the poorer countries, because there was an understanding that they needed 
 
 financing on adaptation and mitigation to questions. The wall hasn't ponied up that money, the U.S. is way behind. That's wrong, isn't it?
 
LEYEN: It is wrong, we have to do more. Europe is doing its fair share $23 billion as Euros. We've said, we're going to pledge that last year, we did 
 
 it and we're going to give more than 23 billion Euros this year, too. But you're right. I mean, there's still a gap. And this gap has to be filled.
 
ANDERSON: Loss and damage is the phrase that viewers will hear a lot about here, compensating poorer countries for the loss and damage caused by 
 
 climate change. Pakistan is the poster child in the most awful way for that thousand lives lost this year 40 billion, the price of damage.
 
The EU and other developed countries are frankly not interested in engaging in engaging in a conversation about loss and damage. Why?
 
LEYEN: I think loss and damage the discussion about is very important. And therefore I'm happy that it's an agenda point, this time at COP27 it wasn't 
 
 so far. There's a lot of work ahead of us to define what is loss and damage, and then to look into the possible funds to compensate.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: That was Ursula von der Leyen speaking to me earlier, David McKenzie is here with me, in Egypt. And if COP26 was about ambition, David, 
 
 we are promised that COP27 will be about implementation. But it's frankly, the failure of the world's industrialized nations to pony up at this point, 
 
 which is caused this sort of trust deficit from the Global South.
 
This is a meeting in Africa. The next meeting is in the UAE, we've got in a region which couldn't be more risk from climate change at the forefront of 
 
 the climate conversation for the next couple of years. What will success look like from this meeting?
 
DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: When I've been speaking, Becky to climate scientists and activist and hear the same thing 
 
 over and over action, action, action, talk isn't going to cut it. People need to make concrete decisions now at this cop and into the months ahead. 
 
 How is the rich world nation going to try and fund the impact of climate because the climate catastrophe is with us right now?
 
You've been reporting on the Pakistan floods, you see the Horn of Africa, East Africa, millions of people facing starvation. Now, climate scientists 
 
 now have the facts to show that it's made worse by the climate change that we are facing.
 
And also in some cases, like the heat waves in Europe, it's made possible at all those would not have happened if we didn't see the warming that 
 
 we've been seeing. So what is needed now are concrete promises from rich nations to pony up the cash as you've said.
 
ANDERSON: David McKenzie will be here in Egypt. David thank you very much indeed. And it's important to point out that there are some solutions out 
 
 there.
 <br>[09:50:00]
 
ANDERSON: If we're going to win the fight against climate change, we need to get creative. And these solutions do exist. For example, the U.S. and 
 
 the UAE recently signed a clean energy initiative that will provide $100 billion globally to help catalyze public private funding.
 
But it is that public private funding that is needed so critically at this point. We will continue to discuss this with those who are gathered here 
 
 and try and get some accountability from those who hold the purse strings. Julia will be back after this short break. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to "First Move". Global travel is back in full swing following the COVID-19 pandemic. And one of the industry's biggest 
 
 gatherings is kicking off in London. As we speak, the World Travel Market bringing together some of the biggest names in business and of course it 
 
 doesn't get bigger than our Richard Quest who is there for us too. Richard much to discuss climate the World Cup is the travel boom sustainable, talk 
 
 us through your conversations.
 
RICHARD QUEST, CNN EDITOR-AT-LARGE: And that's exactly the situation here. Look, we decided today your property will come to Asia and Pacific part. 
 
 The whole place is booming, to be honest, Europe particularly is very busy. The Caribbean is very busy.
 
Asia Pacific is picking up Indonesia, all these areas, the Middle East as well; because the pent-up demand coupled with retain savings that people 
 
 have means that planes are falling, everybody's traveling. Can they do it sustainably?
 
At the moment everybody has the right jargon and the right language and says yes, they can do it sustainably but they're just glad the business is 
 
 back. One country particular Qatar, next week, of course starts the World Cup. One and a half million visitors will be in Qatar.
 
I asked the Minister of Tourism what's going to happen. All those facilities, all the sustainability, how does the tourism industry 
 
 developed?
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BERTHOLD TRENKEL, CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, QATAR TOURISM: Qatar is a modern city and the World Cup obviously will help us to change some of those 
 
 misconceptions that people will go like wow, those football stadiums are better than what I have in my home country. Same goes we talked about the 
 
 infrastructure. So some of those misconceptions we will address during the World Cup and the region it's interested.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
QUEST: Now that was the Chief Operating Officer, I should say of the visit Qatar, the Qatari Tourism Authority. So Julia what you have here, delight 
 
 to be back in business aware of a need to do it sustainably, but frankly they're just trying to get the economy the tourism economy back on the 
 
 road.
 <br>[09:55:00]
 
CHATTERLEY: We have one minute, Richard, did they think it is sustainable or are they worried dark clouds on the horizon?
 
QUEST: Recession will take its toll but they'll people will just trade down, they'll go low cost instead of full service airlines stay in cheaper 
 
 hotels, the will and the wish to travel is there. They'll just do it in a different way.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes, the will sustainable even if some of the cost pressures will way. Richard, great to have you with us, thank you so much.
 
QUEST: Thank you.
 
CHATTERLEY: He's there at the World Travel Market in London, and we're back throughout programming. And that's it for the show. If you've missed any of 
 
 our interviews today, they will be on my Twitter and Instagram pages; you can search for at @jchatterleycnn. In the meantime, "Connect the World" 
 
 with Becky Anderson at COP27 is next.
