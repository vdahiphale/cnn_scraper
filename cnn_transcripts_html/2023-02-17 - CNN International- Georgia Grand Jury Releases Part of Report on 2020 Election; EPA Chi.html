(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SARA MURRAY, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Some witnesses may have lied to a special grand jury in Georgia, the panel says, recommending the district attorney consider indictments.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is basically the grand jury saying, go get them, Madam District Attorney.
 
MURRAY (voice-over): The special grand jury which spent months digging into efforts by former President Donald Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election in the Peach State concluding: Perjury may have been committed by one or more witnesses testifying before it. The grand jury recommends that the district attorney seek appropriate indictments for such crimes where the evidence is compelling.
 
This after the special grand jury heard from 75 witnesses, including high-profile names like Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, former Trump Attorney Rudy Giuliani.
 
RUDY GIULIANI, FORMER TRUMP ATTORNEY: They asked the questions and we'll see.
 
MURRAY (voice-over): And South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, who is standing by his testimony.
 
MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Are you confident in your testimony?
 
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): Yes.
 
MURRAY (voice-over): The grand jury also heard from technical experts, poll workers and investigators. 
 
Concluding: We find by unanimous vote but no widespread fraud took place in the Georgia 2020 presidential election that could result in overturning that election. Adding that they heard from witnesses still claiming that such fraud took place.
 
Because Georgia's special grand juries don't issue indictments, their final report is a vehicle to recommend whether anyone should face criminal charges. The judge overseeing the grand jury ordered sections of the report released Thursday but held back the panel's conclusions on criminal charges after Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis argued against the report's release.
 
FANI WILLIS, FULTON COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY: We think for future defendants to be treated fairly, it's not appropriate at this time to have this report released.
 
MURRAY (voice-over): Saying last month that she would soon make decisions on whether to seek indictments from a regular grand jury.
 
WILLIS: Decisions are imminent.
 
MURRAY (voice-over): The Georgia probe got underway soon after Trump phone Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in January 2021 pressing him to find the votes for Trump to win Georgia.
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have, because we won the state.
 
MURRAY (voice-over): Since the call of the investigation expanded to include the fake elector scheme, false election fraud claims before state lawmakers and efforts by unauthorized individuals to access voting machines in one Georgia County.
 
MURRAY: Now Trump's team is arguing that because he wasn't named in any of these sections of the report released, that he must have done nothing wrong. This must be a total exoneration. Obviously, we don't know that yet. The judge made the call not to allow any names to be named in this early release of the sections of the report and ultimately it will be up to Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis to decide if she's going to go before a regular grand jury and seek indictments either for former President Donald Trump or for any of his allies. 
 
Sara Murray, CNN, Washington.

BIANCA NOBILO, CNN ANCHOR: Georgia Secretary of State who was on the receiving end of that phone call with Trump is reacting to the partial release of the report. Republican Brad Raffensperger refused to go along with Trump's baseless claims about election fraud and now he says the grand jury report proved him right. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRAD RAFFENSPERGER (R) GEORGIA SECRETARY OF STATE: We were vindicated. We've been shown that we have been factually correct from day one. They said there were 66,000 underage voters. There is actually zero. We'll always follow the law and we always follow the Constitution that we're compelled to testify. Then we'll show up if we are subpoenaed. It's something that that's an obligation of everyone. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR: The secretary also says the grand jury unanimous vote that there was no evidence of widespread fraud should put to rest -- or should put to rest any questions. 
 
We're getting a better sense of what happened in the moments leading up to the train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio that spilled toxic chemicals all over the community two weeks ago. 
 
NOBILO: Take a look yourself at the top of the screen. An apparent overheated wheel bearing began sparking more than 40 minutes before the disaster as the train passed through another town. Investigators are looking into what exactly caused that bearing to overheat. 
 
FOSTER: The White House is deploying teams from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the health department to address concerns about residents' health. Both of Ohio Senators visited East Palestine on Thursday to assess the disaster. Republican JD Vance shared this video of a creek in the town. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEN. JD VANCE (R-OH): I want to just show this to people. I don't know if you can see this on the camera but watch this. You see that chemical pop out of the creek. This is disgusting.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
NOBILO: Head of the Environmental Protection Agency toured the disaster area on Thursday and he spoke with CNN's Jason Carroll about the government's response. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MICHAEL REGAN, EPA ADMINISTRATOR: We will be here for as long as it takes to see this process through. I want to assure the people of -- 
 
JASON CARROLL, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: I just want to say -- when you say as long as it takes, I think the question is long term, is someone going to be here a year from now, two years from now to come back and test the water, test the soil? 
 <br>[04:35:00]
 
REGAN: I'm very clear when I say as long as it takes. We will go through this process with the citizens of East Palestine for as long as it takes. The federal government will be here for as long as it takes. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
NOBILO: The chair of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board addressed the train derailment On Twitter. She writes: The agency is, quote, working vigorously to understand what caused this train derailment so it never happens again. 
 
In the meantime, the NTSB is urging people to stop speculating and spreading misinformation about the crash. 
 
FOSTER: Residents are increasingly angry over the disaster and the response from officials and the rail company. CNN's Brian Todd reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Anxiety and frustration continue to mount in East Palestine, Ohio.
 
KRISTINA FERGUSON, EAST PALESTINE, OHIO RESIDENT: People were getting sick. We should not be back in the town until all was done.
 
TODD (voice-over): Officials are pumping oxygen into local water ways hoping that will break down chemicals. They've removed contaminated soil from the area near a train derailment that unleashed a torrent of toxic chemicals. But about two weeks since that accident and despite an assurance from the governor that the town's water is now safe to drink --
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you feel in that?
 
FERGUSON: I'm honestly, no, I don't.
 
TODD (voice-over): Some residents report symptoms like dizziness, headaches, rashes. They're also complaining about a lack of transparency. Resident Jamie Cozza tells CNN the only reason she knows her house isn't safe to live in is because she demanded that the soil and water be tested and Norfolk Southern Railroad sent a toxicologist.
 
JAMI COZZA, EAST PALESTINE, OHIO RESIDENT: And it's only because I run my mouth, I got this testing done.
 
TODD (voice-over): Today, EPA administrator Michael Regan was on the ground there on Thursday, assuring residents they'll get all the resources they need for the clean-up. And --
 
MICHAEL REGAN, EPA ADMINISTRATOR: We are absolutely going to hold Norfolk Southern accountable and I can promise you that.
 
TODD (voice-over): But the railroad is being accused by some resident of ducking accountability after railroad officials bailed on attending a town hall meeting Wednesday night. 
 
Citing, quote, the growing physical threat to our employees. A meeting where residents vented more of their anger. 
 
TRENT CONAWAY, EAST PALESTINE, OHIO MAYOR: They screwed up our town, they're going to fix it. If they don't, I'll be the first one calling all of you back to do this all over again.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Why are people getting sick if there's nothing in the air or the water?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Everybody that came here expects a hell of a lot more than what we are getting right now. TODD (voice-over): Investigators say they haven't found significant traces of the dangerous chemical that escaped from the train, vinyl chloride in the local water ways but health monitors warn --
 
WENONAH HAUTER, FOOD AND WATER WATCH: Vinyl chloride causes cancer. If the soil is used in gardens, children play in it, it can be very dangerous. And the chemical will leach into ground water. 
 
TODD: Compounding all the anxiety and uncertainty the community is dealing with are worries about practical living arrangements. East Palestine resident Jamie Cozza told CNN some residents feel they are forced to go back to the town because they don't have the money to move elsewhere. 
 
Brian Todd, CNN, Washington.

NOBILO: Nearly eight months after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned federal abortion rights, the U.S. military is granting new protections to service members. Those who need to travel out of state for abortions will be given up to three weeks leave. 
 
That's because they can't control where they're stationed. In states like Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana that have some of the toughest abortion restrictions are also home to major military bases. The new policy goes into effect a month from now.
 
NOBILO: Meanwhile, Kentucky's Supreme Court is allowing the state's almost complete ban on abortion to remain in place for now. They state's top court ruled that a lower court was wrong when it stopped two abortion laws from taking effect. 
 
FOSTER: Those measures include a so-called trigger law banning the procedure and a separate law that outlaws' abortions after six weeks with no exceptions for rape or incest. Planned Parenthood and American Civil Liberties Union say the fight isn't over. 
 
NOBILO: Ahead, tremendous damage and so many deaths. And yet glimmers of hope are still emerging from the earthquake wreckage in Turkey. Will be live in Istanbul.
 
FOSTER: And later, a voluntary recall for hundreds of thousands of Tesla cars. The issue that could pose a danger on the roads.
 <br>[04:40:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
NOBILO: NATO's secretary-general flew over the disaster zone in Turkey to witness the destruction caused by last week's powerful earthquake. 
 
Jens Stoltenberg offered his condolences to the Turkish people and met with the country's president and top ministers. Stoltenberg says this the deadly natural disaster on alliance territory since the foundation of NATO in 1949. And the blocs focus going forward will be on reconstruction and supporting the displaced. NATO is setting up temporary housing and will bring in tens of thousands of tents in the coming days and weeks. 
 
NOBILO: The U.N. has launched a three-month campaign to raise $1 billion for relief efforts in Turkey and a similar appeal for nearly $400 million for Syria. On Thursday Syrian president Bashar al-Assad made his first televised speech since the disaster. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BASHAR AL-ASSAD, SYRIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): The size of the catastrophe and the task that falls upon us are much greater than our existing capabilities. But what our society managed do with the help of the citizens and state institutions was also much greater than the capability. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NOBILO: The heartbreak in Turkey and Syria is unrelenting with almost 44,000 people confirmed dead. But 11 days after the magnitude 7.8 earthquake, there are still signs of life. A 12-year-old boy was rescued in Turkey's Hatay Province 260 hours after the quake. We're told that Osman was found in a hole in a sitting position and appears to be OK. 
 
FOSTER: And let's go to Nada Bashir who's in Istanbul. These rescue teams are doing incredible work, aren't they. 
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER: They really are, Max. And it's unbelievable really that we are still hearing of these remarkable rescues this many days on. And in fact, the last few days we've been hearing the warnings from the United Nations, from these rescue teams on the ground that the window for finding survivors beneath the rubble was closing very quickly and it certainly is. But despite that, we are still seeing these survivors being pulled out. 
 
One man overnight, a 33-year-old man being pulled out 261 hours after being buried beneath the rubble. And we've seen emotional videos now be circulated and released by the Turkish Health Ministry, showing this man, his name was Mustafa, calling his friend whose number he had memorized to ask if his family and relatives were also alive. And of course this is the hope for so many people in southeast Turkey waiting for news of their loved ones still buried beneath the rubble. 
 <br>[04:45:00]
 
But of course, there is a focus now on providing support and relief for those survivors. Because the situation on the ground there is just so difficult. It is freezing cold temperatures. These people have lost absolutely everything. Not only are they waiting for news of their loved ones, but they are dealing with the loss of their homes, the loss of their livelihoods. They are now hugely and entirely dependent on humanitarian assistance. And as you mentioned there, we've seen now the United Nations
 
 appealing for further funding. $1 billion over the next three months for Turkey, some $400 million for northeast Syria. But this is going to be a significant challenge ahead for the Turkish government. They themselves has been appealing and raising money for funding to support that humanitarian effort. 
 
But of course, this is going to take months if not years for southeast Turkey to recover. And there has been some pressure on the government really to speed up that recovery process. The government so far has committed to rebuilding the affected areas within a year. And currently the buildings damaged in this earthquake are undergoing an assessment. More than 50,000 buildings have been deemed unsafe and may require demolition. And there is currently an investigation ongoing into allegations of construction negligence. So, there is building pressure on the government. But of course, the focus for now remains squarely on that humanitarian response efforts -- Max, Bianca. 
 
FOSTER: NATO getting involved and sending in all of those tents just sort of expresses the scale of the temporary problem which is housing all the people who have lost everything. 
 
BASHIR: Yes, absolutely. And in fact we're already beginning to see evacuations taking place from southeast Turkey here in Istanbul we have seen a number of families being evacuated. Some are being housed in university dormitories, others are being housed at homes hosted by volunteers. 
 
And we were able to actually visit one family, she was connected, a Syrian woman, with another Syrian family living here in Istanbul. They have described it as a lifeline, they simply had nowhere else to go. 
 
But these are very temporary measures, Max. They need homes, they need somewhere permanent to stay. And the uncertainty surrounding all of this is only really exacerbating the trauma that these families have already been through. And we are talking about thousands and thousands of families. And of course, were also talking about Syrian families, who have not only been displaced because of the earthquake, but they been displaced multiple times now because of the brutal war at the hands of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria -- Max, Bianca. 
 
FOSTER: OK Nada in Istanbul, thank you so much. 
 
NOBILO: And if you are looking for information on how to help earthquake survivors, go to CNN.com/impact and you will find a list of organizations working on rescue and relief efforts. Again, that is CNN.com/impact. 
 
FOSTER: Still ahead, the Phoenix Suns give a warm welcome to their newest player, Kevin Durant. His reasons for joining the team, after the break.
 <br>[04:50:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) FOSTER: Tesla is recalling nearly 363,000 vehicles due to problems
 
 with the self-driving feature. Whilst Tesla issued the voluntary recall, CEO Elon Musk tweeted that the word recall was wrong and the problem could be fixed with a software update. 
 
NOBILO: The issue is with the "full self-driving" system in all models of the Tesla. That includes the S, X, 3 and Y. Some of the rest involve the cars being unsafe in intersections, not responding to in time to changes and speed limits and not accounting for drivers adjusting the speed. 
 
FOSTER: Kind of scary. 
 
NOBILO: Yes, it is. But hopefully they'll fix it. 
 
A leak in two Russian spacecrafts will delay the return to earth of the astronauts on the International Space Station. The first a cargo ship docked at the space station was already supposed to act as a replacement vehicle. In December it was found to be leaking coolant. 
 
FOSTER: Then a leak was detected on the spacecraft meant to replace the first one. Russian engineers anticipate a new rescue vehicle will be ready to launch in March. Until then the crew on the space station will continue with normal activities. 
 
Now in the NBA, the Phoenix Suns gave a warm welcome to their newest star player Kevin Durant. 
 
NOBILO: Holding his number 35 jersey, Durant was officially introduced at a press conference Thursday with the team's owner and general manager. Durant has been out with a knee injury the past month but says that he is excited about the Suns' energy and culture along with the enthusiasm from the fans. 
 
FOSTER: Durant also grew emotional reflecting on his team with his former team the Brooklyn Nets. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KEVIN DURANT, PHOENIX SUNS PLAYER: It was a lot of ups and downs, but I love the grind. So -- and everybody in Brooklyn love the grind too, so I built a family over there. As they're going to always be a part of my journey. So we didn't accomplish what we wanted to accomplish as far as winning that champions -- just like I told him. 
 
But I enjoyed the grind and everybody there we tried our hardest every day regardless of what was going on in the media, what was going on with our teammates. Everybody who is in that Jim we grind it. So, I love those guys, I get emotional talking about them because that was a special four years of my career. Coming off of an Achilles and they help me through a lot. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NOBILO: In the world of golf, Tiger Woods is back where his career started 31 years ago, the PGA tour. The legend tees up Friday for round two of the Genesis Invitational in California and this is his first tournament in seven months. Right now Woods is five shots from the lead. I feel like my dad. 
 
FOSTER: You are. With over 82 PGA wins, Woods is just one away from the most victories ever. He's struggled since suffering a leg injury in a car accident two years ago, but he's not ready to put away his clubs just yet. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TIGER WOODS, GOLFER: They'll come a point in time when I can't do this anymore. But right now, I feel like I still can. Given the right golf course. The way this golf course is playing right now, you watch Rory and JT and myself, we're all hitting the little cheater kind of flies to everyone and rolling the ball out there. 
 <br>[04:55:00]
 
I'd have a little hard time playing with having against him, Rory and JT when it was wet and they could bomb the 320, but this golf course is set up where you can kind of scoot it, kind of get it around. And I was able to that all day today. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NOBILO: Now to another legend in her own right, American skier Mikaela Shiffrin won gold in the giant slalom in the world championships on Thursday. She now has seven titles and 13 overall metals from world races. Shiffrin could still another metal when she competes on Saturday.
 
FOSTER: Now waves of color and costume flooded city streets in Germany to mark the crazy days of the Cologne Carnival. The 200 year old tradition is back after being halted in 2021 -- that was due to COVID -- and 2019. In 2022 it was canceled because of the Russian war in Ukraine. And so, it is just beginning again. So, they are all enjoying that. Germans in attendance is here are thankful for the festival's return. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Guys, it is like a liberation. You want to celebrate carnival every day now. Ash Wednesday should not be the end of it if you ask me. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): It is great. Everyone is enjoying it. All generations celebrating together. We have all been waiting for this for a long time. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NOBILO: The Cologne Carnival will party on through the weekend building towards the peak of celebration on Rose Monday and its symbolic closing ceremony on Ash Wednesday to mark the start of Lent. 
 
FOSTER: No kids there. Wonder what they're thinking of their parents dressed up like that. 
 
NOBILO: Yes.
 
FOSTER: Thank you for joining us here on CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Max Foster. 
 
NOBILO: I'm Bianca Nobilo. "EARLY START" is up next right here on CNN.</pre>
