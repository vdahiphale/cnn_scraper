SARA SIDNER, CNN HOST: I'm Sara Sidner in New York. Jim Acosta has the day off. You're in the CNN NEWSROOM. 
 
We begin with news on former President Jimmy Carter. The 98-year-old will begin receiving hospice care at his home in Plains, Georgia. That is according to a statement from the Carter Center which says the 98- year-old has decided to spend his remaining time surrounded by family and forgo any further medical treatment away from home. 
 
CNN's Jeff Zeleny has more on that story. 
 
JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Sara, the decision of former President Jimmy Carter to remain in Plains, Georgia, after a series of hospital stays certainly speaks to the center that this town has really been to his life. He spent nearly all of his 98 years in Plains, Georgia, with the exception of his time of course in the White House and his time as a young man serving in the American military. 
 
But Plains, Georgia, a town of about 140 miles or so south of Atlanta, really has been the place where this former president has done his life work in the post-presidency. He's talked about democracy. He's been a leader for housing, building homes himself through Habitat for Humanity. Talking about democracy. So clearly, Plains, Georgia, has been his life blood. And that is where he is choosing to remain as opposed to being sent back to the hospital. 
 
The Carter Center on Saturday afternoon had put out the news that after a series of hospital stays, he has chosen with his family to remain in Plains in hospice care. We are learning from family and friends that he is comfortable. And his grandson, Jason Carter, who's a former Georgia state senator, ran for governor in Georgia unsuccessfully, he said he visited with his grandparents on Friday. And he said the house is full of love. 
 
Now, President Biden of course has a long history with former President Jimmy Carter. A young Senator Joe Biden was the first Democratic senator to endorse Carter's presidential candidacy all the way back in 1976. So I am told that President Biden is keeping in close contact with the Carter family, as well. Of course he visited the Carters on the 100th day of his presidency back in the spring of 2021. 
 
So all thoughts in Washington certainly are on the life and the legacy of Jimmy Carter. 
 
SIDNER: Our thanks to the indefatigable Jeff Zeleny. 
 
The CEO of Norfolk Southern met today with residents of East Palestine, Ohio, and rail crews two weeks after one of the company's freight trails derailed in the town, sending toxic chemicals into the air, water and soil. Criticism is growing now over Norfolk Southern's handling of the spill and its aftermath. 
 
Our Polo Sandoval has the very latest on that story. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Sara, good evening. It's Norfolk Southern, that's the rail company that the U.S. EPA maintains will be held accountable for its role in this disaster. The company, for its part, though, as recently as earlier today, tweeted saying that they will not walk away. That they will be in the community, as they have been from the beginning, and working with officials there, as part of the cleanup that they described as a responsible and safe cleanup process. 
 
They also tweeted access to home and business air testing services, free of charge, that the company is offering there. And again, reiterating that they are in for the long haul. But this is really not assuring many of the residents in the community that's deeply affected by this. They say that some have even developed rashes, sore throats, nausea and also headaches. They're worried that these symptoms could potentially be related to the chemicals that were released after that derailment just over two weeks ago. 
 
And they still have these concerns as you're about to hear, even after they've heard from authorities on the ground, who have already said that even after multiple tests, they have not seen any elevated levels of chemicals in the tap water or in the air. 
 
KRISTINA FERGUSON, EAST PALESTINE, OHIO RESIDENT: We need help. We do. We need -- we need President Biden. We need FEMA housing. People are getting sick. 
 <br>[19:05:00]
 
JAMI COZZA, EAST PALESTINE, OHIO RESIDENT: The railroad sent out his toxicologist who deemed my house not safe, but had I not used my voice, had I not thrown a fit, I would be sitting in that house right now when they told me that it was safe. 
 
JIM STEWART, EAST PALESTINE, OHIO RESIDENT: I don't recommend you put anything in the ground. I mean, vegetables or tomatoes or anything this year because we don't know. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
SIDNER: That was our Polo Sandoval reporting for us there. 
 
Very direct and candid. That's how the State Department is describing today's talks between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and China's top diplomat. It's the first meeting between senior officials since tensions spiked after a U.S. fighter jet shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon flying over U.S. soil. Also new this evening, the State Department says Blinken was quite blunt in warning China to not provide lethal aid to Russian forces in Ukraine. 
 
Meanwhile, Ukraine plugs away, often relying on unreliable and outdated equipment. CNN's Sam Kiley took the skies with Ukraine's outgunned helicopter pilots. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The target is Russian troops. A hard bank left and a dive, and flares to distract heat-seeker missiles. A pair of Ukrainian helicopters on an assault against Russian forces close to Bakhmut. 
 
HENNADY, UKRAINIAN ARMY PILOT: The Russian aircraft are waiting around the border, it's on the frontline. We should be careful when we go. We should fly at very low altitude and very low speed to prevent our recognition. 
 
KILEY: Below, trenches and East Ukrainian villages smashed by war. 
 
Back from their sortie, this forward base is secret, as low profile as possible. The MIA helicopters are refueled and re-armed. They expect to fly at least three sorties a day. 
 
(On-camera): When you took off this morning, were you frightened? 
 
HENNADY: Why? 
 
KILEY: Well, because the Russians want to kill you. 
 
HENNADY: We don't have any other choice than to fight with Russians. If you're frightened, you should stay at home. 
 
KILEY (voice-over): That's not an option here. 
 
(On-camera): This Soviet-era helicopter is about 30 years old. The threat against it is extreme, and as a result of that, we are having to fly quite literally below the height of trees, climbing and dipping with every piece of woodland that we pass. 
 
(Voice-over): Built as transport aircraft, they're most vulnerable when they climb to shoot their rockets. Diving for cover to 20 feet above the ground is also perilous. 
 
A change in sound indicates a tree strike by the helicopter's blades. Back at base, the blades are swapped quickly. Ukraine doesn't have aircraft to spare, nor pilots. Serhiy skippers the chopper that hit the trees. He tells me, "In
 
 December, a very close friend of mine died. A lot of people I knew, friends, have already died, unfortunately. It's very painful and I'm very upset and I cannot move on." He went on, "We need new attack helicopters, new jets. Unfortunately, our equipment is old and its range is very small and it's inaccurate." 
 
A year into fighting Russia's invasion, Ukraine is still asking for more advanced helicopters and jets. So far the response from her allies has been, sorry, but no. And so they fight on here with what they've got. 
 
Sam Kiley, CNN, Eastern Ukraine. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
SIDNER: Wow. What incredible reporting there from Sam Kiley and his team. 
 
I want to bring in CNN military analyst and retired Air Force colonel, Cedric Leighton. 
 
Colonel, thank you so much for joining us at this hour. What would Western-supplied planes mean to Ukraine and its ability to push Russia back? 
 
COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, between planes and helicopters, Sara, you'd have quite a good mix for the Ukrainians to aptly go after the Russians, not only on their front lines but behind the frontlines. 
 <br>[19:10:01]
 
So this is, you know, I think one of the key factors that the Ukrainians are still looking for. One of the key factors that's also missing from any type of modern military operation. Either side has been able to declare air supremacy over the Ukraine or even air superiority over Ukraine, and if the Ukrainians were able to get air superiority, even in localized areas, that would be a huge deal for them. 
 
Now one of the big questions of course is how well and how quickly can they be trained to use different equipment? You know, what Sam showed, you know, with the MI-8 helicopters, that's, you know, about two generations ago in terms of helicopters and aviation. If they're going to be brought up to speed, that's going to be a different situation and it's going to take some time to do that. 
 
SIDNER: Yes. There is a lot of technology that has been majorly updated, and a lot of things to learn. Next week, and I cannot believe this, but it marks the one-year anniversary of Russia's invasion in Ukraine. I remember at the time when it first happened that the U.S. intelligence at the time has said that probably Russia was going to take the capital Kyiv in three days. That clearly did not happen. 
 
And of course, since then, there have been rethinks about all of this, especially on Russia's side. Did you think that the war would be where it is today, not knowing what you know now? 
 
LEIGHTON: Yes, hindsight of course is always 20-20, right, Sara, but the -- I think the big takeaway here is that the Ukrainians confounded most expectations that are on the Russian side or on the Ukrainian side, even certainly on the Western side. I think a lot of people expected a repeat of 1968, when the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact invaded what was then Czechoslovakia and to, you know, get rid of that relatively liberal communist regime at that point. 
 
But, you know, Ukraine is quite different. And Ukraine had tasted freedom. They knew that they had to fight in order to survive. And that very fact I think surprised many of us. And I think that's the key thing. It's quite a surprise that they did this. But now that we're at this point, the Ukrainians need a lot more in terms of weapons, in terms of ammunition and in terms of the ability to move forward to actually regain the territory that they've lost. 
 
They've done a major job in recapturing a lot of territory up to this point. But they haven't quite gotten what they want in order to achieve that stalemate that they're looking for. 
 
SIDNER: Yes, there's still some horrible, bloody battles that continue and continue to take civilians' lives. One of the things about being on the ground there from my perspective is there were a few things that really changed the tenor and tone of this. One of them was Zelenskyy. Him staying in place and fighting back himself. And not just putting his countrymen on the frontline. 
 
And the other is that the Ukrainian people aren't having it. Like you're talking about grandmothers to grandbabies. Like they are not going to let this end with Russia taking over their country. 
 
The U.S., though, has been warning its allies that China may increase its military support of Ukraine. And what that would mean, I would like to hear from you what you think that would mean if China decides to start supplying Russia with whatever it may need, although everyone thought that Russia's forces were stronger than Ukraine's. But what would that mean going forward for Ukraine? 
 
LEIGHTON: Yes, certainly would cause some problems for Ukraine. I think one of the key things to think about here is the huge disparity in terms of numbers between the Ukrainians and the Russians. The Russians before the war had about 10 times the defense budget of the Ukrainians. And that, you know, was also reflected in personnel numbers. But what we've learned since then is that the quantitative ability of the Russians and the quantitative preponderance of the Russians is really not a match for the Ukrainians as long as the Ukrainians get the weapons that they need from West. 
 
So the Chinese, if they support the Russians, you know, in a major way, that is going to put a strain on the Ukraine. It's also going to put a strain on NATO. And NATO is going to have to step up its game. The defense industrial base is going to have to play a huge part in resupplying the Ukrainians and it's going to have to do so very, very quickly. We have to expect the Chinese to do this and we have to act accordingly. SIDNER: Well, this is an unprovoked war from the auspices of Ukraine's
 
 side. Russia invaded for no apparent reason other than wanting to take territory, and so we will see what happens in the end but I know that the Ukrainians are going to be fighting awfully hard to keep that from happening. 
 <br>[19:15:04]
 
Colonel Cedric Leighton, thank you so much for your insight. 
 
LEIGHTON: You bet, Sara. Any time. 
 
SIDNER: Police say a man accused of shooting two Jewish people was motivated by hate. Ahead, how those shootings have an entire community on edge in Los Angeles. 
 
And later, new incredible rescues from the earthquake rubble in Turkey. 
 
You're in the CNN NEWSROOM. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
SIDNER: Turning back to our top story, we found out a few hours ago that former President Jimmy Carter will begin receiving hospice care at his home in Plains, Georgia, and will not receive medical interventions. 
 
Joining me now is Dr. Devi Nampiaparampil. I hope I got that right. From NYU School of Medicine. I tried, Dr. Devi. 
 
DR. DEVI NAMPIAPARAMPIL, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF REHABILITATION MEDICINE, NYU SCHOOL OF MEDICINE: You did a great job. 
 
(LAUGHTER)
 <br>[19:20:00]
 
SIDNER: Can you explain for our viewers exactly what it means to be receiving hospice care? 
 
NAMPIAPARAMPIL: Yes. So it's a complicated concept. But usually when people are sick, what they're trying to do is to survive or to get better as quickly as possible. So even something simple let's say that you get bacterial infection, what you'll do is you'll get antibiotics. And those antibiotics -- side effects because you know at the end of the day if you get an infection, you can probably heal -- you can probably recover from those side effects and they'll be temporary. 
 
But what happens is, if you have something more dangerous, let's say heart disease, cancer, something more terminal or advanced, then as you continue to get those side effects or those complications of the treatment, you eventually get sort of stuck between a rock and a hard place because you're getting complications from the condition itself, this terminal condition, and you're getting complications from the treatment. And maybe at a certain point you just don't feel like you can recover. Like you can heal from the damage of either one. 
 
So at that point, people start to consider, you know, am I going to continue with this path, where maybe not going to, you know, quote win, or survive from this, you know, I'm actually going to pass either way. So should I try to figure out what's the best way of doing this that I can spend time with my family or I can do the things that I want to do and kind of prioritize the things that I wanted to accomplish with my life? 
 
And at that point, people usually consider hospice or palliative care. And it can come at a different point for different people. But that's really the aim of it, where the priority changes from survival to actually, you know, comfort or whatever you wanted to accomplish with your life. 
 
SIDNER: Yes. You know, there does come a point at which someone says enough, and it sounds like that's what happened with former President Carter. He's 98 years old. He's been through bouts of cancer and a whole host of other things. And in the statement that was sent out by the Carter Center, it was that he is no longer going to be taking any sort of medical care in the hospital. He wants to be at home and he wants to be beside his family. 
 
And I want to ask you why someone might choose hospice over a hospital. Is it really that, look, I see that the end is near, and I just want to be surrounded by the people who I love the most and who love me the most? 
 
NAMPIAPARAMPIL: Yes. So that's usually part of it. And of course, you know, people start to -- these treatments often aren't painless, right? So a lot of things that people do, especially when they have advance disease, they're often painful. Sometimes costly, although people usually don't like to think about cost. But they start to wonder why am I enduring all of these painful treatments? Why am I being rushed to the hospital? 
 
Being hospitalized itself a painful process. You don't get sleep. You're often woken up all the time, blood draws, sometimes painful procedures, et cetera. And you start to question why am I doing this if this is not going to achieve the outcome that I'm looking for? So then you start to think about, well, you know, if I'm going to die, what do I want to have left behind? And then that can change what you're doing. 
 
Also, you know, usually in hospice, people think about not just the person who is sick, but the caregivers. Who is left behind after all this is done? Because oftentimes for the family, it's extremely stressful trying to treat this person who's extremely sick. And they may also feel like let's do everything possible. Actually most people spend a fortune in that last week of life when the person is dying. 
 
And of course it's not all about costs. But actually if you think about it, if that cost was going to give you that loved person back, that's one thing. But it often doesn't. And it doesn't prolong the time. So if they could spend that time and money with the person kind of doing things that they would prefer to do, rather than being in the hospital, but spending quality time together, often that's what they would rather do. 
 
The hard part is we never know when we're going to die, right? So if we knew when it was going to happen, then we would change the way we do things. But hospice is often not used because people don't -- they don't know so they'd rather try to do everything. And there's different stages. So in this case, President Carter has decided he doesn't want medical care necessarily. Often, you do get medical care at least for pain and for a lot of different symptoms. 
 
SIDNER: Right. 
 
NAMPIAPARAMPIL: But people can choose to get some care. And it's usually once you have the terminal condition that you can go into these different stages where you get some care but you're kind of changing the priorities and it depends how you really want to do it, and you could communicate that to the team. 
 
SIDNER: Yes. You're not trying to cure something, you're trying to alleviate pain as you march towards the end. 
 <br>[19:25:06]
 
Dr. Devi Nampiaparampil, thank you so much for joining us and explaining this. It's a hard time for anyone going through it and your calm demeanor has been wonderful. Thank you. 
 
NAMPIAPARAMPIL: Thank you. 
 
SIDNER: A community in Los Angeles is on edge after a series of shootings. Police say they were hate crimes. The latest next on CNN NEWSROOM. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
SIDNER: There's growing worry over the dangers toxic chemicals could pose in East Palestine, Ohio, after a freight train derailed in the town earlier this month. Some residents say they've suffered headaches, rashes, sore throats and other symptoms. And I am joined now by Heather McTeer Toney, vice president of Community Engagement for the Environmental Defense Fund. 
 <br>[19:30:00]
 
Heather, thank you so much for joining us. I see that we got the memo, we're all wearing blue today.
 
What is your biggest concern right now for people in this area, especially those who are complaining of symptoms?
 
HEATHER MCTEER TONEY, VICE PRESIDENT, COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND: You know, East Palestine is like so many communities all around this country that are connected by railway, and it is so concerning that not only are we dealing, again, with another tragedy of a train derailment, it's in community where their children, their families, and that people are very concerned about what they're smelling, they're seeing, they're feeling, and how we are measuring and monitoring that exposure is extremely important.
 
So when we think about the chemicals that we know have been released, they are known carcinogens. Vinyl chloride is a carcinogen, and when it is burned, you get phosgene, which again, is something that is not only a known carcinogen, but we have to look at the health impacts to our vulnerable populations, and that's what worries me.
 
It is looking at the impacts to children, to elderly, to our pregnant women and women of childbearing age. We should definitely closely monitor not only their health impacts, but really look to see what the exposure was, and how many of those persons were actually exposed.
 
SIDNER: You know, sometimes when things like this happen, and I'm not saying that's what's happening this time, but sometimes companies or the government or someone tries to sweep it under the rug, because they know that there could be long-term impacts and that is costly.
 
What kind of work do you think will need to be done in this particular time, to one, alleviate the fears and worries of those who saw this happen, who experienced this happening, and who have to live with this in their community, and two, to actually do the cleanup to make sure that everything is actually safe.
 
TONEY: Communicating with community and understanding that this is something that we're all connected to is a critical component of this.
 
In St. James, Louisiana in just a few months ago, in November, there was a train derailment, where again, there was another entire community that had to be evacuated, but how many of us really understood and knew that what happened in St. James, Louisiana was going to happen again here in East Palestine, and that we would continue to see these type of incidents, because we don't know what's going through the trains that are coming through our community?
 
So I think it's very -- it's incumbent upon all of us to understand that this is a connector. This is an environmental community connector. Every community deserves to know what is coming through there. And let's be honest, when you're out with your kids, and you're going like the folks in East Palestine to support the East Palestine Bulldogs, you want to know that they're breathing the air that is clean for them, you want to know if there's an emergency if the Waffle House closes, that there's a real emergency. That's how people in communities think about how to determine whether or not there's a health hazard.
 
So when we take those real-life connections, and now look at what people are feeling, what they're smelling what they're seeing, I think it's extremely important that not only the corporations and the community -- that corporations and government take note that that we all listen to community first, and then respond to what they're telling us, they are living through the experience.
 
We can't let the corporations off the hook.
 
SIDNER: Yes, Heather Toney, I do want to mention that I have had several conversations with the EPA Director, Michael Regan. And one of the things he said and I thought it was important is that they are going to have to earn back and I'm talking about the government itself, and the companies earn back the trust of people because at this point in time, that trust has been lost, and it takes time to rebuild that.
 
And so all the things that you said, you know, ring true for a lot of people who have been through this before.
 
Heather Toney, I really appreciate you coming on the show and sharing your insights with us.
 
TONEY: Thanks so much.
 
SIDNER: Authorities a California man accused of targeting and shooting two Jewish men in separate incidents has a history of antisemitic acts.
 
The suspects told investigators he was looking specifically for Jewish people. According to prosecutors, the first shooting happened Wednesday as the victim was walking to his car from religious services at a synagogue in Los Angeles. The second attack happened, Thursday, just three blocks away and video shows the victim just moments after he was shot in the arm.
 
Police say both men were hospitalized, but they are in stable condition expected to survive.
 
CNN's Camila Bernal joins us now from Los Angeles. This has to be really terrifying for the community there.
 
CAMILA BERNAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It really is, Sara, especially because a lot of the people that I talked to what they told me is look, "That could have been me." They feel like it could have been themselves, their family members, their children, and that's why so many of them are worried.
 <br>[19:35:03]
 
BERNAL: They know this was a targeted shooting because when this 28- year-old was arrested, he told authorities that he was looking at this area, that he was looking at kosher markets in this area, that he specifically targeted these two men because of their headgear. They were easily identifiable as Jewish men, and so that's what creates a lot of this fear.
 
In addition to that, we know that authorities were looking into his past. As you mentioned, his antisemitic behavior, he was messaging via e-mail and text to his classmates with threatening messages and so there's a whole case being built.
 
The US District Attorney that is now handling all of this saying that this man could face up to life in prison for what he has done here, and also for terrifying this community. There is a prominent Rabbi here in Los Angeles that spoke out about all of this. Here is what he said.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
RABBI ABRAHAM COOPER, SIMON WIESENTHAL CENTER: Parents will be looking over their shoulders, walking to houses of prayer on the Sabbath. It is not a situation that should be normal anywhere.
 
The security measures at the houses of worship and Jewish schools are already in place.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BERNAL: And we have seen a lot of security in the different synagogues in this area. We saw Mounted Police throughout the day just going up and down the street. But again, as I mentioned, a lot of the people here say they are worried because they think this could happen again -- Sara.
 
SIDNER: Camila Bernal, it's always good to see you. Thank you so much for your reporting.
 
It's been nearly two weeks since that massive earthquakes hit Turkey and Syria and people are still being found alive in the rubble. We'll have the very latest, next.

 <br>[19:40:47]
 
SIDNER: In Turkey and Syria, the death toll from powerful earthquakes 12 days ago has now surpassed 46,000 people. But amid the devastation, more amazing stories of survival. This morning, a couple and their son were pulled alive from the rubble of a collapsed apartment building 296 hours after the earthquake. Sadly though, the little boy died later.
 
This week, I spoke to another survivor who escaped from under the rubble, only to learn that part of his family wasn't as fortunate.

SIDNER (voice over): Ahmed Ayan (ph) is grieving the loss of his wife and son, while clinging to the one person who willed him to stay alive.
 
(AHMED AYAN speaking in foreign language.)
 
SIDNER (voice over): "My daughter was telling me, 'Papa, don't cry. Relax. They're coming to rescue us,'" he says.
 
(AHMED AYAN speaking in foreign language.)
 
SIDNER (voice over): This is Ahmed four days after he was buried neck deep in rubble with his wife and two children. Only he and his four- year-old daughter, Gada (ph) made it out alive.
 
(AHMED AYAN speaking in foreign language.)
 
SIDNER (voice over): "We stayed under the rubble about four days. When the building fell down, my daughter was on my leg. Thank God there wasn't any rocks or something on her."
 
(UNIDENTIFIED MEN speaking in foreign language.)
 
SIDNER (voice over): She was rescued first. A half hour later, he was, and the two got separated. He was taken to a hospital. She was eventually taken to Social Services with barely a scratch on her.
 
For days, he had no idea where his little angel was.
 
SIDNER (on camera): Did you worry that you'd never seen her again?
 
(AHMED AYAN speaking in foreign language.)
 
SIDNER (voice over): "No. Never," he says.
 
SIDNER (on camera): You knew you would see her again.
 
SIDNER (voice over): And he was right.
 
(AHMED AYAN speaking in foreign language.)
 
SIDNER (voice over): This is the day they were reunited. They screamed and cried, elated to hold each other once more.
 
(AHMED AYAN speaking in foreign language.)
 
SIDNER (voice over): "On the fourth day, my daughter told me, 'Look Papa, there is light.' I didn't understand the light at the time," he says. 'Then I heard some voices."
 
Those were the voices of rescuers and a family member later found her in Social Services and made the connection.
 
Jean Gilsoy (ph) is hoping beyond hope, he too will be reunited with his parents.
 
(JEAN GILSOY speaking in foreign language.)
 
SIDNER (voice over): "I have one request for you. Please help me find my mother, Shukran Erdon (ph)," he tells us.
 
He and his family were trapped inside this collapsed building for 24 hours. He and his sister made it out, his mother has not been seen since.
 
(JEAN GILSOY speaking in foreign language.)
 
SIDNER (voice over): "I remember the collapsing of the building. I remember passing out after a piece of the house hit me in the eye," he says.
 
SIDNER (on camera): Can you describe what it was like in this tight space physically for you.
 
(JEAN GILSOY speaking in foreign language.)
 
SIDNER (voice over): "It was so difficult to breathe there. On the other hand, there was something crushing my leg making me suffer," he says. Ultimately, it was his decision to pull on a bit of the curtains that were visible to the outside that alerted someone he was alive.
 
While he continues searching for his mother, Ahmed is nursing his foot injury while thanking God, he has at least one child left to love.
 
(AHMED AYAN speaking in foreign language.)
 
SIDNER (voice over): "That's my daughter," he says, and "She is my little hero. My hero."

SIDNER: (2020) presidential hopeful, Nikki Haley is hitting the campaign trail. Yesterday, she spoke to a crowd in New Hampshire, making an appeal to nostalgia.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
NIKKI HALEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Do you remember how simple life was? And you remember that your parents are what taught you what was right and wrong. And you went to school and they gave you the basics. And neighbors took care of neighbors, and being patriotic was something you felt in your heart and your gut.
 
Do you remember that? Don't you want that again?
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) SIDNER: Some will say, we still have it.
 
Joining us now, CNN senior political analyst, Ron Brownstein. He is also a senior editor for "The Atlantic."
 
Ron, is this a variation of the Trump theme, Make America Great Again?
 
RON BROWNSTEIN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes, look, I mean, I wrote in 2016, the most important word in the Trump lexicon was "again." And I believe that since I wrote -- I wrote in 2012, and for the last decade, I think it's been pretty clear that the fundamental fault line in American politics, is between those voters who are fundamentally comfortable with the way America is changing demographically, culturally and economically and those who feel threatened or aggrieved by it.
 
And, you know, the Republican coalition is centered on that, what I call the coalition of restoration. The voters who are the most uneasy about the way the country is changing, and Nikki Haley, boy, she is spoon feeding it vary or shooting it directly into that vein, with that kind of argument.
 
SIDNER: It's interesting, though, because the way she delivers the message seems to be very different, much softer, much less vitriol, the way in which she is sharing her message.
 
Let's now talk about South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, who is headed to Iowa this week. I wonder why.
 
Speaking of which, what do you think? Do you think this is a step towards becoming a candidate for 2024 for President?
 
BROWNSTEIN: It's a step toward examining whether to become a candidate, right?
 
I mean, look, if you recall, people may recall that it was last week, 15 years ago, 16 years ago, I guess that Barack Obama declared his candidacy. Compared to that in 2007, compared to that, this is unfolding very slowly. Ron DeSantis, like George W. Bush in 1999, when he was a frontrunner, has the built-in excuse of he can wait till after his legislative session is done later this spring.
 
But you don't really get the sense that there's anybody on the Republican side who is anxious to spend one more day than they have to as a declared candidate in the crosshairs of a certain former President, who has shown if nothing else, he is very good at bludgeoning political rivals.
 
SIDNER: Yes. I have a question for you. You there's always this expectation that we know what's going to happen with a candidate, that yes, we know so and so is going to run. You have President Biden, who has alluded to probably maybe doing it.
 
We have not heard from Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. Is there a sort of deadline that is put out there that needs to be adhere to? Or can they kind of come in the race whenever they darn well please? BROWNSTEIN: Well, generally speaking, you know, the feeling has been you have to get in earlier to build an organization and to raise money. I think that's less relevant for DeSantis and for some other candidates, because he does have extraordinarily high name ID and support in early polling and obviously, has tremendous ability to raise money online and through small donors around the country, so I don't really feel he has like a real pressing deadline.
 
I think what's happening, though, is that the dynamics of the race are being kind of readjusted by Haley possibly and Scott, taking South Carolina off the board and the Governor of New Hampshire, Sununu, possibly taking New Hampshire off the board. Those early races really set the program for the Republicans, and it is not clear what will happen if two of those races have favorite son/daughter candidates in them.
 
SIDNER: Yes, it is really interesting, actually, to see, as this sort of comes out.
 
Ron Brownstein, you're always amazing. Thank you so much for joining us.
 
BROWNSTEIN: Thanks for having me.
 
SIDNER: A young fan stole the show at a hockey game. Why the arena went crazy for this four-year-old. Next, a little happiness for you on CNN NEWSROOM.

SIDNER: Wrapping up a 16-hour flight without being jetlagged sounds like a lucky break, but not for passengers on an Air New Zealand flight this week. They thought they were on their way to New York, but a terminal at JFK International Airport closed unexpectedly because of an electrical outage, so their flight from Auckland got turned around despite being half way to its destination. The total flight time 16 hours and 25 minutes to end up right back at home. Bless you, people. I hope you're all okay.
 
Starbucks Frappuccino drinkers, listen up. Distributor PepsiCo is recalling more than 300,000 bottles of the coffee chain's vanilla version because they could contain pieces of glass.
 
If the drinks in your fridge have the product code shown on screen and come with any of these expiration dates, you are urged to call Starbucks Customer Relations.
 
Thank you so much for joining me this evening. It has been my pleasure.
 
I'm Sara Sidner, in for Jim Acosta.
 
He is going to be back tomorrow, don't worry starting at four o'clock Eastern as usual and stay with us now for the CNN film: "Dreamland: The Burning of Black Wall Street."
