MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome back to CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Max Foster. If you're just joining us here are some of today's top stories.
 
At least 191 deaths have been reported in the wake of Hurricane Helene, the second deadliest hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland in the last 50 years.
 
Rescue efforts continue across the southeastern U.S. were President Joe Biden predicts it will take billions of dollars in recovery efforts.
 
A typhoon Krathon made landfall in Taiwan a short while ago now has winds of close to 85 miles per hour and is equivalent to a category one hurricane. Taiwan's president is wanting potentially catastrophic damage. At least two people were killed.
 
The Vatican, a nearly month-long religious conference, the Synod of Bishops is now underway. Pope Francis opened the assembly with a mass in St. Peter's Square urging participants to avoid imposing agendas. It ends October 26th.
 
The fighting in Lebanon hasn't stopped Israeli airstrikes on Gaza. The Ministry of Health reports at least 90 people have been killed in the latest attacks including an incursion into Khan Younis. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment.
 
Hospital officials say at least eight people were killed in an Israeli strike on an UNRWA school building. The IDF says Hamas was using the facility as a command and control center. CNN's Nada Bashir here in London with more.
 
Obviously, the focus of world attention has been on Lebanon. But you know, the deaths are greater in Gaza still.
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's right, we are seeing these significant death tolls still. And it's difficult to imagine that almost a year on since the beginning of this war we are still seeing these staggering figures. At least 90 people killed overnight Tuesday into Wednesday in a series of strikes carried out by the Israeli military on Gaza. As well as that incursion that we saw into Khan Younis in the southern area whereas we know so many of the displaced are still gathered despite this being a very dangerous area. Of course there is simply nowhere safe left. 
 
In that incursion at least 51 people were killed according to the Palestinian health ministry in Gaza. We have been hearing from health officials saying that some are still stuck under the rubble, that ambulance crews were not able to reach many of the injured and many of the casualties for some time before being able to take them to nearby hospitals.
 
We have been seeing some of the devastating video coming in. I think we have a sound bite from one eyewitness in Khan Younis. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Suddenly they invaded from everywhere. Many people could not evacuate their homes as some did evacuate. Those who remained in their homes were the ones who were hit.
 
Within a few hours more than 30 people were killed. Seven or eight from the al-Fada (ph) family and in this house 15 or 20. Our neighbors, the al-Masi (ph) family, and the photojournalist, Ahmed al- Zard's family were targeted here beside the school.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[04:35:00]
 
BASHIR: And of course these areas are areas that are densely populated still with civilians many of whom are displaced. We know of course many are taking shelters in schools. This was an area nearby a school.
 
Separately we know that a U.N. run school was also targeted. At least eight people killed there.
 
Now the Israeli military has acknowledged that they have targeted what was an all girls school. They have said that in their words this was a precise strike that they were targeting a Hamas command and control center. But as we know and as we have been hearing from many humanitarian organizations the vast majority of schools are still being used as shelters for civilians.
 
These are densely populated areas. And we have been seeing footage coming in. Many of those wounded were children. This is a hugely devastating development still ongoing in Gaza.
 
FOSTER: Yes, OK, thank you so much, Nada.
 
Families of hostages still being held in Gaza protested Wednesday near the Israeli Prime Minister's private residence in the coastal town of Caesarea. They placed fake headstones alongside a long banquet table set for Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year. The tablecloth had a slogan calling for the return of the hostages in the New Year. Organizers said the event aimed to convey their refusal to celebrate the Jewish New Year during the present, quote, reckless reality. Dozens of suspected gang members connected to white supremacy were
 
 arrested in Los Angeles on Wednesday. Officials say the suspects are facing numerous charges including racketeering, drug trafficking and financial fraud.
 
Josh Campbell has more.

JOSH CAMPBELL, CNN SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: One of the largest criminal takedowns in Justice Department history against a suspected violent neo-Nazi white supremacist organization. That's how authorities are describing this massive takedown in Los Angeles Wednesday that resulted in over 40 people being taken into custody, suspected gang members. Authorities seizing guns, drugs as well as bomb making material, they say. Now in a sweeping indictment, authorities accused group members of racketeering, drug and gun trafficking as well as financial fraud.
 
Now there's no indication that group members were planning any type of imminent attack, but authorities did say --
 
MARTIN ESTRADA, U.S. ATTORNEY FOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA: This group has as its mission to plan attacks against racial, ethnic, religious minorities. They fund that through various criminal means, including financial fraud, including drug trafficking. We're not going to wait for the next tragedy to take action.
 
CAMPBELL: Now these arrests come as authorities have been warning about a heightened terrorism threat environment. We now also know that law enforcement across the United States have increased patrols at houses of worship after Iran's latest attack on Israel as well as the start of the Jewish high holidays and the upcoming one year anniversary of the October 7th terrorist attack by Hamas on Israel. No indication of any imminent threat.
 
Authorities say these increased patrols will serve as a deterrent, but as the FBI director previously said, he can't remember a time in his memory when so many different types of threats were elevated all at once.

FOSTER: One or two doctors charged in connection with actor Matthew Perry's death has pleaded -- has entered a guilty plea in a Los Angeles court. Perry died a year ago at age 54 due to the effects of the anesthetic ketamine and subsequent drowning -- according to a coroner's report. Dr. Mark Chavez pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute ketamine. As part of a plea agreement he faces up to 10 years in prison.
 
About 120 men and women are now accusing Sean Diddy Combs of sexual assault, false imprisonment and numerous other sex crimes. The music mogul has already pleaded not guilty to federal charges, including sex trafficking. CNN's Elizabeth Wagmeister spoke with the accuser's attorney.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ELIZABETH WAGMEISTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): More than 100 new accusers plan to pursue legal claims against Sean Diddy Combs, according to their attorney.
 
TONY BUZBEE, ATTORNEY: These were people that were there that were that were allegedly drugged and then allegedly raped, passed around, woke up the next morning with just completely clueless about what had happened to them.
 
WAGMEISTER (voice-over): Combs denies the allegations, his lawyer telling CNN in part: Mr. Combs emphatically and categorically denies as false and defamatory any claim that he sexually abused anyone, including minors. 
 
Combs already faces a dozen civil lawsuits and is pleaded not guilty to charges of racketeering, conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. Houston attorney Tony Buzbee tells CNN he intends to file individual lawsuits against Combs for each of the 120 new accusers, some who he says have already spoken to the FBI.
 
WAGMEISTER: Do you have video evidence of your clients allegedly being sexually abused?
 
BUZBEE: It's full on video of things happening that would never be appropriate for public viewing.
 <br>[04:40:00]
 
WAGMEISTER (voice-over): Buzbee says he's in the process of collecting video, photos, text messages, medical records and drug tests. 
 
WAGMEISTER: Many of your clients have alleged to you that they were given a horse tranquilizer.
 
BUZBEE: You know, you hear that one time you think that's really strange. You hear it three or four or five times. All of a sudden you're like, holy what is going on here?
 
WAGMEISTER (voice-over): In the indictment, federal authorities also accused Combs of drugging victims. 
 
WAGMEISTER: They do not believe that Sean Combs acted alone.
 
BUZBEE: I do agree with the FBI and the federal authorities. I do think that there are a lot of individuals involved and a lot of entities involved.
 
WAGMEISTER: Household names. Are we talking about celebrities, executives in the entertainment industry?
 
BUZBEE: All the above, yes. WAGMEISTER: We've all heard about the white parties. Just because a celebrity is photographed wearing white at a Sean Combs party does not mean that they are complicit in any criminal activity.
 
BUZBEE: The white party comes up quite often. And typically later in the night with the same MO, a drink, -- a drink laced with something in some cases.
 
WAGMEISTER: Was this all happening in plain sight at these parties?
 
BUZBEE: That's the allegation that people saw exactly what was going on and did nothing about it.
 
WAGMEISTER: Now, these new potential lawsuits comes as Sean Combs is already incarcerated in a Brooklyn jail awaiting his criminal trial. The attorney tells me that out of these 120 new accusers, 60 are men and 60 are women. He also says that 25 of them alleged that they were minors at the time of these alleged incidents.
 
The attorney says that he plans to start filing these lawsuits within the next 30 days. 
 
Back to you.

FOSTER: Israel-Hezbollah war is creating a humanitarian crisis as hundreds of thousands of people flee their homes. We'll discuss their plight just ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[04:45:00]
 
FOSTER: The Israel-Hezbollah war is creating a humanitarian crisis in Lebanon. The United Nations says about a million people in Lebanon have been displaced in recent weeks as airstrikes continue in Beirut and other parts of the country. Now, Lebanese officials are appealing for $427 million in aid to address the internal refugee crisis. 
 
Sana Basim is the head of program for Islamic Relief Lebanon. She joins me now from Beirut. Thank you for joining us. Just describe how quickly the situation has turned to the worst.
 
SANA BASIM, HEAD OF PROGRAM, ISLAMIC RELIEF LEBANON Yes, thank you for having me. So, the situation is very bad on the ground and there is massive displacement on the ground and people are trying to, like, you know, look for the shelter, to seek refuge to the safer places, but they are unable to find. And the government, though they prepare some collective shelters like school buildings and, like, you know, mosques and churches, but they are -- the capacity of these places are very limited and they are unable to accommodate all these displaced peoples.
 
Now the people, like, you know, they are, if you go to the Beirut and the surroundings, you will find people having tents on the beaches, they are on the street, and, like, the numbers are growing every day.
 
FOSTER: Why are you still there? Because presumably you've been asked to evacuate as well.
 
BASIM: Yes, so my evacuation is in process and, like, you know, there are many other countries, citizens of many countries that have already evacuated. But as a humanitarian, I feel like this is my responsibility to work and I am working till the time I can work. So otherwise I will be, like, you know, working online and will be supporting my team.
 
FOSTER: A lot of people who have evacuated are talking about the guilt that they feel because there are many people who, of course, who are just going to be left there. 
 
BASAM: Yes. 
 
FOSTER: Just describe that feeling.
 
BASIM: Yes, so, like, you know, for one year people are in constant fear. They are psychologically traumatized that what is going to happen. There are many people I know that they left in December, then they came back, then they left. So it is the fear is constantly there. 
 
But now as the situation is unfolding and things are becoming very intense, there is a lot of fear in the people. And it's not only the people, like, you know, from foreign nationalities, but also the Lebanese people who have access to other countries, they evacuated in a lot of numbers.
 
FOSTER: A lot of people, you know, initially evacuated to Lebanon, didn't they, because they didn't feel safe in their own countries. What's happening to them? Syrians, for example. A lot of people going back to countries they originally came from.
 
BASIM: Yes, that is true. Because, like, you know, they don't feel safe here. And that is why the situation, they are feeling that anything can happen anytime. So that is why they don't feel safe. And they want to flee to any space where they can feel safe, where they feel protected. They are trying to go there.
 
It's not only the Syrian refugees who are crossing the border at the moment to Syria, but also there are many Lebanese who are going to Syria just to seek refuge and to have a safe place.
 
FOSTER: So in terms of the support you need from other countries, what sort of aid do you need? How will it be used for the people who are left there when people like you and other aid workers leave the country?
 
BASIM: So when it comes to support, especially for the people who are displaced, it's like, you know, the need is huge. And, like, for example, when we are talking to the U.N. agencies and when we are talking to the government established unit, when we ask them what is the need, what are the gaps, they said that they need everything. Because just imagine, we have visited some of the shelters where 100 people are using only one sanitation facility.
 
So imagine the crowd and the hygienic condition and, like, you know, the plight of the people. So they are badly in need of assistance, in need of our support.
 
FOSTER: Are you concerned of a situation like we've had in Gaza? Obviously, it's a much bigger space, Lebanon. But in Gaza, you've had the situation where people have been asked to leave some areas, they move to another area and then are told to leave there as well.
 
Are you concerned that people might choose the wrong places to evacuate to in Lebanon?
 
BASIM: Yes, so, like, you know, we also received some messages, for example, especially for Dahiya, many people received messages to evacuate the place and then they evacuated. But the thing is, where to evacuate? Like, you know, they don't have resources sometimes, they don't have any space where they can go. Collective shelters are already occupied, so they end up staying on the streets. 
 <br>[04:50:02]
 
So the problem is not only about evacuation, about where to evacuate and where to find that safe space.
 
FOSTER: OK, Sana Basim in Beirut, thank you for taking time out for your very busy work to speak to us today. Thank you.
 
BASIM: Thank you for having me.
 
FOSTER: The Prince and Princess of Wales helped a British teenager with cancer achieve a dream and crossed some item off her bucket list too. That story and more still to come.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: A cruise ship that was due to begin a round-the-world voyage back in May is still struggling to start its journey. The Villa Vie Odyssey set sail from Belfast in Northern Ireland Monday night after months of setbacks, but two days later it was still anchored in the Belfast waterway due to what's been described as a paperwork issue. They haven't had enough time to sort that one out.
 
The ship's previous delays were blamed on the certification process taking longer than usual. But once everything gets sorted, the passengers will finally begin their three-and-a-half-year voyage with their first stop in Northern France. 
 
The UK's Prince and Princess of Wales released images Wednesday that showed them helping a teenager with cancer fulfill a dream. 
 <br>[04:55:00]
 
Sixteen-year-old Liz is a budding photographer who's fighting a rare and aggressive form of cancer. She was invited to take pictures of a ceremony at Windsor Palace as part of her photography bucket list. In one of the photos, Catherine can be seen embracing the teen, a rare image of her at an engagement. The 42-year-old princess only recently returned to public duties after announcing that she had completed chemotherapy treatment for cancer.
 
In the NBA, the Denver Nuggets appear to be settling in quite nicely as they visit Abu Dhabi. The team shared these images of the players riding camels on Wednesday, along with the #HumpDay. The Nuggets are in the UAE as part of the NBA's International Showcase Series, which also includes games this season in Mexico, Canada and France. It's the third year the league has held pre-season games in the Arabian Gulf. The Denver Nuggets will take on the reigning champions, the Boston Celtics, in two pre-season games this weekend starting Friday. 
 
A U.S. bomb from World War II that had been buried at a Japanese airport exploded on Wednesday. The blast created a large crater in the runway at an airport in southwestern Japan. More than 80 flights were cancelled, no injuries reported. The United States officials are trying to determine what caused the bomb to suddenly detonate after so many decades.
