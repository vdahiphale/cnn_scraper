ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR (on camera): Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us here in the United States and all around the world, you are watching CNN NEWSROOM, and I'm Rosemary Church.
 
CHURCH (voice over): Just ahead, students demand action on guns in the wake of the Michigan State University shooting. We'll discuss what needs to happen to prevent the tragedies we are seeing all too often in America schools.
 
Former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, throws her hat into the 2024 presidential ring, but she will likely face some stiff competition in the Republican primary.
 
And as the death toll in the Turkey-Syria quake continues to rise, images of rescue teams finding survivors under the rubble offer a glimmer of hope.
 
ANNOUNCER: Live from CNN Center, this is CNN NEWSROOM WITH ROSEMARY CHURCH.
 
CHURCH (on camera): Thanks for joining us. And we begin this hour in East Lansing, Michigan. The community is mourning three college students killed in a mass shooting, and praying for five others still in the hospital.
 
We have new video showing students at Michigan State University, hiding from the gunmen in their classroom.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (INAUDIBLE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Get the -- out.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (INAUDIBLE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They said don't open the door. Get the -- out.
 
CHURCH (voice over): Terrifying moments there. And police don't know what motivated the gunman to opened fire on the sprawling campus. Then, later take his own life.
 
They say that he had a history of mental health issues. East Lansing's mayor, Ron Bacon, says he's had enough conversations. It's time to make it more difficult for dangerous individuals to have weapons.
 
RON BACON, MAYOR OF EAST LANSING, MICHIGAN: We don't have a complete generation that's grown up with this many times over, as just the part of from elementary school all the way up to now, and now we're looking at this at the college level as well.
 
So, they've lived with this the entire time. And it's unfortunate that those with the abilities to even make the most minor changes that refuse to real pretty much their entire lifetime at this point.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH (on camera): More now on the victims and the investigation from CNNs Miguel Marquez.
 
MIGUEL MARQUEZ, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Students flee. A shooter, this time, on campus of a major university. Michigan State in East Lansing.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ELLIE DEZONNA, STUDENT, MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY: I was like shaking in the bathroom and it was just terrible. It's just like preparing myself for like the worst thing ever.
 
MARQUEZ: The shooting started around 8:30 p.m. in a classroom, just as the last class of the day was wrapping up.
 
DOMINIK MOLOTKY, WITNESS: I booked it to the far side of the class and ducked down, and he came in and shot three to four times in our classroom.
 
MARQUEZ: The shooter, 43-year-old Anthony Dwayne McRae, with no known connection to the school, made his way from a classroom to the student Union building. Two students were killed in the classroom, one at the student Union.
 
CHRIS ROZMAN, PUBLIC SAFETY INTERIM DEPUTY CHIEF, MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE: We had officers in that building within minutes. And in that building, they encountered several students who were injured.
 
MARQUEZ: Across the University of some 50,000 students, panic.
 
GRAHAM DIEDRICH, STUDENT, MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY: Myself and a few others that are with me, we took heavy furniture from around the library, and just essentially barricaded ourselves into a study room to make sure we were safe.
 
MARQUEZ: The dead, Alexandria Verner, a junior from Clawson, Michigan. And sophomore Brian Fraser and junior Arielle Anderson, both from Grosse Pointe.
 
Alli Vanderaue, a senior at the school, watch the shooting in response unfold, unable to believe what she was seeing.
 
ALLI VANDERAUE, SENIOR STUDENT, MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY: Every time I think all of us hear a loud noise, we freak out. I mean, this isn't thoughts and prayers, we need change, and we need change now. How many times we have to sit here and watch my students die, our friends die, like, please, like I just -- something needs to change.
 
MARQUEZ: Students, staff, and residents, now coming together to pray and cope with how this could happen here.
 <br>[02:05:01]
 
The shooter's father tells CNN, his son grew bitter, reclusive, and angry after the death of his mother two years ago. The shooter was charged with carrying a concealed weapon in 2019. He pled guilty to a misdemeanor. His probation ended in May of 2021.
 
McRae located with the help of an alert citizen, just minutes after police released his photo. And at the rock, as sort of community message board on campus, a question with no easy answer. How many more?
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
MARQUEZ (on camera): So, Michigan State University is home to the Spartans, and this is the Spartans statue on campus, which has now become sort of a makeshift memorial, where students and others had come just to try to reflect on what's happened here.
 
On the body of the shooter, there was a two-page note found in his back backpack, in which he made reference to finishing off East Lansing, and also seeming to threaten schools in New Jersey where he grew up.
 
Still unclear tonight as well is whether or not the two guns the shooter had on him were purchased legally in 2021. Back to you.
 
CHURCH: And less than a day after the mass shooting at Michigan State University, U.S. President Joe Biden, called on Congress to take action to stop gun violence.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: And it's a family's worst nightmare. It's happening far too often in this country. Far too often. While we gather more information, there's one thing we do know to be true. We have to do something to stop gun violence ripping apart our communities.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH (voice over): Tuesday was also the 5-year anniversary of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.
 
14 students and three educators were killed that day, Mr. Biden marked the anniversary by announcing $231 million in federal funding to curtail gun violence.
 
The funds will be used to create projects like red flag programs, as well as mental health, and substance use treatment courts.
 
CHURCH (on camera): There's a new Republican contender for U.S. president in 2024. Former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley has formally announced her bid. Making her the first major rival to challenge her old boss, former President Donald Trump for the nomination.
 
CNN's Kylie Atwood has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NIKKI HALEY, FORMER GOVERNOR OF SOUTH CAROLINA: I'm Nikki Haley, and I'm running for president.
 
KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Nikki Haley, telling her story to the American people as a presidential candidate for the first time.
 
HALEY: I was the proud daughter of Indian immigrants. Not black, not white. I was different.
 
But my mom would always say your job is not to focus on the differences, but the similarities. And my parents reminded me and my siblings every day how blessed we were to live in America.
 
ATWOOD: The 51-year-old casting herself as the future of the Republican Party.
 
HALEY: It's time for a new generation of leadership.
 
ATWOOD: Urging the GOP to chart a new course.
 
HALEY: Republicans have lost the popular vote in seven out of the last eight presidential elections.
 
ATWOOD: And highlighting her accomplishments as a two-term governor of South Carolina, the state where she was born and raised.
 
HALEY: Every day is a great day in South Carolina.
 
ATWOOD: Cutting taxes and leading her state through the aftermath of the 2015 deadly shooting by a white supremacist at the Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The severity -- HALEY: We turned away from fear toward God.
 
ATWOOD: At the time, Haley confronted a controversial issue, spearheading efforts to remove the Confederate flag from the state capitol.
 
HALEY: The biggest reason that I asked for that flag to come down was I could not look my children in the face and justify it standing there.
 
ATWOOD: In her announcement, Haley also nodding to her experience on the world stage as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.
 
HALEY: China and Russia are on the march. They all think we can be bullied, kicked around. You should know this about me. I don't put up with bullies. And when you kick back, it hurts them more if you're wearing heels.
 
ATWOOD: But no mention of former President Trump, who tapped her for that role.
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I just want to thank, Nikki.
 
ATWOOD: Haley's entrance, prompting praise from Republicans.
 
REP. NANCY MACE (R-SC): She's got all the qualifications to run for president.
 
ATWOOD: Even as some are concerned that a crowded primary could benefit former President Trump.
 
MACE: To see someone, you know, see some of the leadership coming out of South Carolina's exciting but I do have concerns if there are too many people on the ballot by the time it gets to South Carolina that, you know, that lessens the chances of anyone else sort of coming out in this thing.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ATWOOD (on camera): And on Wednesday, Nikki Haley will make her pitch in person for the first time here in South Carolina, which is her home state. And then, she's off to the races. Headed to New Hampshire and Iowa to continue campaigning.
 <br>[02:10:00]
 
Kylie Atwood, CNN, Charleston, South Carolina.
 
CHURCH: The White House is sharing its leading theory about the three airborne object shot down over U.S. and Canadian airspace over the last several days.
 
Given the limited information they have, officials believe they are balloons serving a commercial or otherwise benign purpose. Now, U.S. lawmakers want to make sure the country is better prepared if more objects are discovered.
 
CNN's Phil Mattingly has more now from the White House.
 
PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Well, even as another day passed without the recovery of three objects that were shot down by U.S. fighter jets over the weekend.
 
MATTINGLY (voice over): Without any clear answers, still, at least definitively to what they actually were, U.S. officials now saying they at least have a leading theory. And that theory is that these objects weren't a threat. They weren't state owned, and they weren't really that problematic at all, despite the action that was ordered by President Biden.
 
As for President Biden, he is still not speaking publicly about the issue.
 
Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The intelligence community did say that they are considering or looking this -- at this to be potentially benign.
 
The president is taking this very seriously. And he's receiving briefings regularly, we are sharing as much information as we can, as possible. And but we do want to make sure that the Americans -- American people understand that there's no need to panic.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MATTINGLY (on camera): Now, White House officials acknowledge there are still a lot of unanswered questions. They had top administration officials on Capitol Hill, briefing all 100 senators in a classified setting to give them as much information as they possibly could.
 
But to some degree, given just how difficult and arduous the recovery process has been because of weather related issues, they acknowledge that they may not ever have some of the answers that they're looking for. And that, more than anything else is what is driving a parallel effort that administration officials are undertaking, putting together an interagency task force to try and at least give some sense of what operational mentality will be like going forward on issues like this.
 
Putting protocols into place in terms of when an object would need to be or merit some type of force -- some type of action like we saw over the course of the last weekend.
 
Those protocols are expected by the end of this week, they will be driving the administration's approach going forward. But again, given how many unanswered questions remain certainly a lot of work to do behind the scenes, administration officials acknowledge, the certainly took them by surprise, it is certainly something they didn't plan to be grappling with at this moment in time. And that, that element of uncertainty has driven what has been a very real process behind the scenes to get some type of coordinated policy approach on the books and then move from there.
 
Hopefully, when you talk to officials, with more information from these objects that they're still in the process of trying to recover it.
 
Phil Mattingly, CNN, the White House.
 
CHURCH: Turning now to Wall Street, where stocks finished the day mixed.
 
CHURCH (voice over): The Dow dropped more than 155 points and the NASDAQ was up 0.06 percent. That's after a stronger than expected increase in consumer prices.
 
The surge is fueling fears the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates for longer than hoped. The Consumer Price Index released Tuesday shows inflation hit a three-month high in January, but is still slowing on a year-to-year basis.
 
The U.S. president says that's progress.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BIDEN: Today's report on inflation shows the good news is that inflation in America is continuing to come down. It has fallen seven straight months, with more to go. Food prices and grocery store are coming down. Gas prices are down $1.60 since their peak.
 
Real wages for working Americans are up over the last several months.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH (on camera): Still to come. This search and rescue team from California has responded to hurricanes and worked in war zones, but they tell CNN they have never seen anything like the devastation from the earthquake in Turkey and Syria.
 
We'll have their story on the other side of the break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:17:51]
 
CHURCH: Last week's catastrophic earthquake has now killed more than 41,000 people in Turkey and Syria, and that's what authorities know so far.
 
Nine days after the disaster, the rescue window is closing. But astonishing stories of survival are still emerging from the rubble.
 
CHURCH (voice over): Just a few hours ago, word that a 77-year-old woman in southern Turkey was saved 212 hours after that quake.
 
Turkish media's say she was hugged by family members waiting at the scene of the rescue.
 
And on Tuesday, a handful of people were found alive after being buried some 200 hours and enduring all those violent aftershocks.
 
Three of them pulled from the debris in the Kahramanmaras region of Turkey.
 
Meanwhile, the U.N. says more humanitarian aid is flowing into northern and northwest Syria, and reaching areas held by rebels. That's after two more crossings were approved. The Syrian government had previously insisted all aid go through the capital.
 
CHURCH (on camera): A search and rescue team from California is among the volunteers from around the world, who have jumped into action in Turkey. And they say, they felt compelled to help in any way they could.
 
CNN Jomana Karadsheh has our report.
 
JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Deep in the heart of Turkey's disaster zone, these Americans are in a mission like no other they have known.
 
As soon as the earthquake hit, volunteers from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department say they just knew they have to be here.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MIKE LEUM, MONTROSE SEARCH AND RESCUE, LOS ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT: The type of thing that we feel strongly about because we volunteer to do search and rescue back in America. And so, it's one of the things that just burning in our heart to get out there and help people if we can.
 
KARADSHEH: They do mountain rescues, have responded to hurricanes, and even traveled to Ukraine. They've never seen anything on this scale before.
 
COLIN LIEVENSE, MONTROSE SEARCH AND RESCUE VOLUNTEER, LOS ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT: The destruction here is incredible. There is -- there is -- were in one city right now, where there is, you know, we could go to each and every building and just know that there's someone that needs help there, and there's not enough people to help them.
 <br>[02:20:05]
 
Even though there is over 100,000 rescuers, they would need a million. And this is just one city -- 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
LEUM: Yes.
 
LIEVENSE: -- in a very large picture of Turkey. KARADSHEH: On Monday, they helped rescue a 17-year-old boy, the third life they've saved this past week in hard hit Hatay. But there is just so much to do here.
 
LIEVENSE: We were looking at a pile of rubble the size of this building behind me, and we're standing there just on a pile of rocks. We knew there were hundreds of people underneath us, and getting to them is just near impossible.
 
LEUM: This is where we feel helpless, and because so much devastation is being witnessed.
 
LIEVENSE: It breaks our hearts.
 
LEUM: There is been -- there is been times, though, you know, complete happiness and joy because of people being found. So, it's a rollercoaster of emotion.
 
KARADSHEH: The group says they're only here to support the people of Turkey, reeling from their deadliest earthquake.
 
LIEVENSE: The people of Turkey are doing the hard -- the hardest thing they've ever had to do. They're having to unbury their own community, their friends, their loved ones. Some of the people that we're working with lost their entire family, and they're helping to dig out --
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
LEUM: And then, still out of here.
 
LIEVENSE: And they're helping to dig out other people's families.
 
KARADSHEH: There is no giving up. Everyone here is searching for a 70- year-old grandmother. Just one mission in one city, in one massive earthquake zone.
 
Jomana Karadsheh, CNN, Antakya, Turkey.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHURCH: And still ahead, searching for a motive in the Michigan State University mass shooting.
 
CHURCH (voice over): I'll ask a national security analyst what can be done to prevent more tragedies like this one.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:25:45]
 
CHURCH (on camera): Welcome back, everyone. Returning to our top story now, we are learning more about the gunman who opened fire at Michigan State University, Monday, killing three students and critically injuring five others.
 
CHURCH (voice over): Police say 43-year-old Anthony Dwayne McRae had a history of mental health issues and was also charged with a gun related felony in 2019.
 
But authorities are still trying to determine a motive for the shooting. Meanwhile, the gunman's father tells CNN, his son had become bitter, isolated, and evil angry after his mother died from a stroke two years ago.
 
For more on this, I'm joined now by CNN national security analyst Juliette Kayyem.
 
Appreciate you talking with us at this truly tragic time.
 
JULIETTE KAYYEM, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST (on camera): Yes, thank you for having me.
 
CHURCH: And so, we're looking at another deadly mass shooting in this country, the 68th since the start of the year. This time, at Michigan State University, and yet, we're not seeing saturation coverage of the shooting, perhaps, a sad sign that these deadly incidents have actually become a pretty normal part of American life. What needs to be done to stop these massacres happening again and again?
 
KAYYEM: Yes.
 
Well, we start with the obvious, of course, which is not simply gun ownership or the types of guns that are owned. And the debates that you're seeing here, you know, about assault rifle bans or either -- or are focusing on specific weapons.
 
So, that's the obvious, then, it is who or the age of the person who is trying to get access to these guns?
 
Although in the -- in the MSU case, the perpetrator was older, in many of these cases, it is younger males. So, do we want to put restrictions on their ability to purchase certain guns as some states have done?
 
But then, obviously, it gets to a culture of responsible gun ownership, which we've sort of failed to discuss anymore, right?
 
I mean, in other words, it becomes this debate here about the Second Amendment, my right, you're right, who is right are we talking about? Rather than, OK, these are weapons, some of them are weapons of mass destruction.
 
Can we get to a place where responsible gun ownership, responsible gun legislation becomes the baseline?
 
CHURCH: And, of course, as we tackle the issue of what to do about these constant mass shootings, we are learning more about the 43-year- old suspect, who had no affiliation with Michigan State University,
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
KAYYEM: Yes.
 
CHURCH: Anthony McRae, apparently pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor weapons charge back in 2021. So, how was he able to get a weapon and commit this heinous crime?
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
KAYYEM: Yes.
 
So, by all accounts right now, so, we don't know all the details. Because he pled to the misdemeanor, it would mean that once he had served that probation period, it was lawful for him to buy a gun again.
 
So, in terms of just the way the legislation works, and the way that the federal gun legislation works, this was not unlawful gun purchasing. So, that's just one piece of it.
 
On the other hand, what we're starting to hear is a community around him that began to understand that he had become violent, uncontrollable, unrealistic about things that he was saying.
 
And angry. I mean, that's what his father said. That he became angry. His father says that he -- that he believes that his son did not have guns that appears to -- that is obviously not true.
 
So, part of this is, you know, the community in the family that begins to sense something, those sort of hairs on the back of your -- you know, on the back of your neck, that, that actually can mean something.
 
And those are the kinds of interventions that either red flag laws are meant to focus on, or even just, you know, social services to the extent that they're accessible to people in the United States.
 
CHURCH: And investigators are still trying to figure out the suspect's motive.
 
KAYYEM: Yes.
 
CHURCH: In an effort to learn from this incident to hopefully prevent future shootings like this. But, of course, the frustration here is that finding out past motives hasn't stopped future mass shooting.
 
KAYYEM: No.
 
CHURCH: So, what does it achieve exactly to know why a gunman decides to go and shoot people on mass?
 <br>[02:30:03]
 
KAYYEM: So, in some ways, though, understanding motivation has helped us understand. Are there intervention moments that can help stop these mass shootings? And it turns out that both the criminal justice research as well as the social sciences research suggests that there are what we call sort of trigger points. Moments in which the appropriate intervention by family, by social services or law enforcement can assist. This is what the FBI is trying to get a handle on, to try to stop the mass shootings. Of course, this is all defense in many ways. I mean, it is
 
 acknowledging that there are people who have access to guns that can kill lots of people quickly, but that is why we continue to study motive to begin to understand a phenomenon that is, as you said, a sort of purely, uniquely American phenomenon. That here we don't seem to get that, like we don't seem to see just how horrific this legacy is that we've created. When you think of these MSU students, I saw pictures of the three students who passed away. 
 
This is the generation that people might feel called Generation Lockdown. These are the kids that sort of came out of Columbine or the post-Columbine world, they are being raised K-12, Sandy Hook. They are -- they're doing the lockdown drills, they even graduate from K-12. They go to their adult settings, colleges and universities, and one would hope, that this would be an experience that could be open, and free for them. And now, what this is it -- case shows is this that sort of -- they are -- they are generation locked down for life, until we figure out this challenge that we have in the United States.
 
CHURCH: Yes. It is tragic, and for our viewers overseas confounding it is for me -- 
 
KAYYEM: Yes.
 
CHURCH: -- I'm sure, it is for you too. Juliette Kayyem. 
 
KAYYEM: Yes.
 
CHURCH: Always appreciate you joining us.
 
KAYYEM: Thank you for having me.
 
CHURCH: Two sources tell CNN, Federal Prosecutors investigating Donald Trump's handling of classified documents. And now asking a court to force one of his attorneys to provide more testimony. One source as prosecutors alleged in writing that Trump used attorney Evan Corcoran in furtherance of a crime or fraud. Last month, Corcoran appeared before the grand jury for about four hours of sources, he declined to answer some questions citing attorney-client privilege. Well, still to come. An extremely difficult situation on the front lines in eastern Ukraine. An update on the fierce fighting there. Just ahead.
 <br>[02:35:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHURCH: Welcome back, everyone. Well, in the hours ahead, NATO Defense Ministers will be meeting for a second day in Brussels, where the focus is on the war in Ukraine. Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, says allies will continue to support Ukraine for as long as it takes, as the war nears the one-year mark. Ukraine's Defense Minister who is in attendance, says Russia is the most significant and direct threat to countries in the Alliance. NATO's chief reaffirmed the commitment to helping Ukraine.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JENS STOLTENBERG, NATO SECRETARY GENERAL: NATO allies are providing
 
 unprecedented support to Ukraine to help uphold its right of self- defense. And from the start, we have been working very closely with the European Union, determined to support Ukraine, for as long as it takes.
 
CHURCH (voiceover): Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is calling the situation on the front lines in the East extremely difficult. Ukraine says Russian troops are continuing offensives from the air and on the ground in the Donetsk region, Bakhmut is among the cities being targeted by Russian attacks. The U.S. Defense Secretary says he expects to see Ukraine conduct an offensive sometime in the spring.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
(on camera) And CNN's Clare Sebastian is following developments. She joins us now live from London. Good morning, to you Clare. So, as NATO pledges to support Ukraine for as long as it takes. What were you learning about this fierce fighting on the frontlines?
 
CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Rosemary, it's clear that we've seen Russian efforts to fulfill what they've stated as their central goal of taking the Donbas region, those Donetsk, Luhansk regions step up again. The Ukrainian General staff talks this morning about the fighting being concentrated in five different areas. And this really shows the sort of the strain that this is putting on Ukraine, because this is over quite a wide area from Kup'yans'k in the North across the border and in the Kharkiv Region down to Shakhtars'k which is in Donetsk. Which is more than 250 kilometers away.
 
So, this is a wide area that Ukraine is trying to defend, of course, that includes fighting that continues around the embattled city of Bakhmut, which the Russians have been trying to take, for months now. We know that Russia is deploying more and more manpower, the governors of both the Donetsk and Luhansk region, have talked about that in recent weeks. The governor of the Luhansk Region in the Ukrainian governor, says that he believes that in that region, Russia may be trying to -- what he called Sal victory (PH). Take over the whole of that region to try to bring something home perhaps for the anniversary, which is less than 10 days away, the anniversary of the invasion. He says there are less than 10 settlements left for Russia to occupy in that region.
 
So, we know they're worried about the numbers of troops. There's now questions about whether Russia may be bringing in more airpower. The Financial Times quoting, two officials briefed on the matter saying that Western intelligence believes that Russia, might be amassing airpower on the Russia-Ukraine border. The U.S. Defense Secretary asked about that, so, they're not seeing evidence of that yet. But they are worried about the amount of airpower that Russia could potentially deploy in this conflict. Rosemary? 
 <br>[02:40:19]
 
CHURCH: Yes, thanks to Clare Sebastian, joining us live from London. And thank you for joining us. I'm Rosemary Church, for our international viewers. "WORLD SPORT" is coming up next. And for those of you here in the United States and in Canada, I'll be back with more news in just a moment.
