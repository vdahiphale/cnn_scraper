PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN HOST: A trail blazer and also a -- tennis player, Billie Jean King here in New York last night. Sara Sidner will continue our coverage of Hurricane Idalia in the next hour. We're standing by for Florida Governor Ron DeSantis to speak in just moments. We'll be back covering all of this tomorrow morning as well. Stay tuned to CNN. CNN News Central starts right now.
 
RAHEL SOLOMON, ANCHOR, CNN NEWS CENTRAL: Hurricane Idalia, the rapidly intensifying storm now a category one taking aim at Florida's Gulf Coast. And with life threatening storm surge and extreme winds the impact could be devastating.
 
BORIS SANCHEZ, ANCHOR, CNN NEWS CENTRAL: Plus a calculated risk, President Trump's former Chief of Staff Mark Meadows taking the stand. But will his testimony convince a jury to move his trial to federal court?
 
SOLOMON: And classes are canceled today at UNC Chapel Hill. That's after a faculty member was shot and killed. What we're learning about the suspect in custody, those major stories and more all coming in right now to CNN News Central.
 
Right now Idalia is pounding parts of western Cuba as a hurricane while Florida prepares for impact. Idalia is expected to make landfall in Florida Big Bend region early tomorrow morning, potentially as a category three. It's forecast to bring a life threatening storm surge that could cause water to swell up to 12 feet in some areas of Florida. And up in down the state's western coast, Floridians are preparing.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Well, we're tying the boats down right now. My husband is preparing what we can.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There have been plenty of times when I over prepared and then griped about it afterward because all the work I did I had to undo. But it's better than the alternative of not being prepared if it does turn this way when things go sideways. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Sunday it was like its coming. And now it's like get out. It's mandatory. I don't know if I want to leave or not though. I don't know where to go.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SOLOMON: I want to show you this time lapse imagery captured on satellite shows a lightning storm inside Idalia, when it was still a tropical storm. And also hurricane hunters capturing this image of Idalia from above may look calm, but the storm currently has maximum sustained winds of 80 miles per hour.
 
Actually want to take you now to Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who is speaking right now about storm preparations. Let's listen in.
 
GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): module with Expedia. So if you want to find a hotel, you can go to expedia.com/florida. We are coordinating; continue to coordinate with the power companies across the state. We had as of this morning over 25,000 linemen station more on the way. So you will have most likely between 30 and 40,000 linemen when the storm hits.
 
We'll be in the state of Florida, and then they will immediately move to commence power restoration efforts. We've also been working with counties to make sure that they know that we have resources ready to deploy and we want to be helpful to support their efforts.
 
So we have received more than 450 active missions that we are coordinating every resource request we receive has either been filled or will be filled by the end of this morning. We do have 420,000 gallons of fuel staged and ready to deploy and additional assets are expected over the next few days.
 
And the gas stations that will be prioritized will be the ones along the heavy evacuation routes. We have eight urban search and rescue teams activated and over 580 search and rescue personnel ready right now. We have delivered 431 pallets of water, 303 pallets of MREs and over 1200 tarps to communities that may be impacted.
 
We've got many more gallons of water and a lot of MREs that are ready to be deployed as needed. There are over 20 shelters open and additional 20 special need shelters are mobilizing are on standby throughout the state of Florida. We have 5500 National Guardsmen that have been activated.
 
We have deployed 247 starlings with another 529 states in Central Florida, and they will be deployed to impacted areas as the needs arise. 42 school districts have announced school closures over the next two days along with 16 state colleges and seven Florida universities.
 
Our Florida Department of Transportation has more than 600 personnel including over 220 cut and toss crew members with more than 400 pieces of heavy equipment. And trucks strategically placed at across the state to prepare for cut and toss operations post storm. And if you look at that track of where it's going now, you are going to see a lot of debris.
 <br>[09:05:00]
 
There are a lot of trees along that track and it is going to knock down trees, it's going to knock down power lines and there's going to be a need to be able to clear a lot of the right aways. Florida Department transportation has about 1100 generators in route to impacted areas.
 
And they're going to use that to get the traffic signals up and running as soon as possible when the storm passes. As wind become stronger later today and into the night FDOT will be coordinating with FHP and local law enforcement to close bridges. Once the speeds reach in excess of 40 miles an hour, road rangers will be concentrated along evacuation routes to help motorists.
 
We have also called up 33 ambulance strike teams with over 200 ambulances that are ready to surge in any impacted area. We've also requested an additional six strike teams through our Emergency Management Assistance compact with other states.
 
So this storm is going to hit tomorrow morning, you will start certainly seeing effects of this in different parts of the state later on today. You still have time this morning to be able to make your final preparations. If you are in one of those areas, that's in line for some of the major storm surge and you're told to evacuate you know, you have time to do that.
 
But you got it; you got to do that now. You don't have to go hundreds of miles, you can go to a shelter and a different part of your county, go to a friend's house in an area that is not going to be susceptible to the storm surge hotel, all these things are good to do.
 
And you should do that in heat, this is going to be a major hurricane, likely a category three. And where it's scheduled to hit along this Big Bend and we've not really had a hurricane strike this area for a long, long time. If you got to go back to the 1800s before you would see a path like this and so, those coastal areas there have not necessarily been through this before.
 
And I think that being safe is the appropriate thing and erring on the side of caution is the appropriate thing. We will of course be mindful of any changes in the path of the storm. I think everybody on that gulf coast from Tampa Bay, up until Northwest Florida must remain vigilant.
 
They have nudged the track a little bit further west over the last 24 hours. I mean, we were looking at potentially Levy County I think yesterday and today. And now we're looking more at a Taylor County. There are some models that say it may go even further west.
 
So places like Tallahassee where we are today, certainly, you could end up having it hit Tallahassee directly in some of the surrounding areas. So everyone just remain vigilant, continue to watch and listen to the local orders that you receive from your local emergency management personnel. I want to thank everybody you know, we've been in contact with people from most of these counties over the last few days. Everybody's working hard. Everybody understands that, that this is a significant event. And they're remaining calm and cool and collected. But they're executing.
 
And that's what we need to continue to do. I want to thank everybody here at the State of Florida for working hard; they've been working now round the clock and getting the resources where they need to be as those requests come in. And of course, once the storm passes, we're going to immediately go to commence any type of rescue operations and of course the power restoration will be a big priority.
 
Go to Floridadisaster.org/getaplan. If you have any questions, again, you still have some time this morning and into the early afternoon. But as we get throughout this day, you are going to start to see rain and wind pickup particularly the further south. You are in the state of Florida.
 
SOLOMON: We've been listening of course to Florida Governor Ron DeSantis there in Tallahassee at the state emergency operations center, essentially warning Floridians that are in the path of this hurricane Idalia now in tracking at hurricane -- one saying that you have time to prepare.
 
But time is ticking essentially saying that if you want to evacuate, you need to do that now urging people to evacuate he said that you have time this morning to make final preparations. You don't have to go hundreds of miles but go to a different county, go to a friend's house, go to a hotel.
 
SANCHEZ: Yes, Governor DeSantis saying this is going to be a major storm and an uncommon one. He made the point that a hurricane directly hitting the Big Bend area of Florida is not something that sunshine state has seen since the 1800s.
 
SOLOMON: Yes.
 
SANCHEZ: And a significant storm at that it is tracking to land potentially as a category 3 storm as well. Let's take you now live to Clearwater Florida with CNN Meteorologist Derek Van Dam; he's been tracking Idalia since it formed.
 <br>[09:10:00]
 
Derek it's sunny right now. But that's going to change in a matter of a few hours. And then soon that storm surge also is going to be a serious concern.
 
DEREK VAN DAM, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Yes, Boris, you know, we talked about the hazards affecting this area, we are in Clearwater Beach. And this is in Pinellas County, one of the mandatory evacuation zone A's. And you're looking out at the warm Gulf of water, Gulf of Mexico waters.
 
And stepping into this and just feeling it to the touch. This is way, way beyond that bathtub feel we talked about when we describe a pleasant beach scene; it's more like a hot tub. It is above average. And that's literally fuel for hurricanes to strengthen and to form as well. Let me show you why this coastline is so susceptible.
 
And I want to take you to the skies because we've got our drone here. And talented group of people behind these camera lens to by the way, just so much going on with this coastline. But I want you to see just how flat it actually is. I can actually walk out several 100 feet from where I'm standing and have water only up to my knees.
 
It goes on for several 100 feet from here. So that shallow nature of the water makes this so susceptible to a storm surge of four to seven feet. That's the official forecast for this particular area. Clearwater Beach is just over my shoulder there. And if the drone goes higher in elevation, you'll see that the beach stretches for miles.
 
And other graphics here, this is also very interesting to note. So four to seven feet for Tampa Bay, the Pinellas County region, but look at the rents, eight to 12 feet around the Cedar Key region. That is where we're concerned about all of that shallow water from the eastern Gulf of Mexico that you see behind me, that warm water is going to push up and pile up into that almost catcher's mitt type topography feature that we referenced to.
 
So what you're looking at is storm surge potential. And this is also very important because you can see those shades of orange around the Tampa Bay that's four to seven feet, perhaps locally higher. And then along the intercostal, waterways, the barrier islands you can see yellows and oranges there as well.
 
That's four to seven feet of inundation literally above, normally dry lands, including the Clearwater Beach area where we are currently located; this storm has got a trajectory towards the Big Bend. But again, we talk about the wobbles with the strengthening storms.
 
Any deviation to the west, or any deviation to the east has major implications for such large population densities, including Tampa Bay, do not let your guard down, Boris.
 
SANCHEZ: A really important pieces of advice that rapid intensification that we've seen, especially in storms over the last few years. We saw it unfold with Hurricane Ian last year, the cone of uncertainty, leading the hurricane to move in an unexpected direction.
 
SOLOMON: But do not let your guard down.
 
SANCHEZ: Absolutely. Derek Van Dam live from Clearwater, Florida. Thanks so much.
 
SOLOMON: And evacuation orders have been issued for at least 22 Florida counties. But officials are telling people and low lying areas or mobile homes to also consider leaving.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
PAUL NASH, LIVES IN MOBILE HOME, WORRIED ABOUT HURRICANE: Worried a little bit about the rain, we live in, I mean the wind we live in a mobile home. But at all the years I've been in Florida which all my years, never really had much. One time it blew the awning off my trailer, and 40 years so I consider myself pretty lucky.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SOLOMON: And CNN News Central Anchor Sara Sidner also in Clearwater Beach. Sara, I've been watching your coverage this morning, incredible job, my friend. I mean, you've been talking to officials, what are they telling you is the most serious concern right now.
 
SARA SIDNER, CNN ANCHOR: Listen to the orders that are being given and do it now. It looks gorgeous. You know, you look at those pictures from Derek Van Dam. You look at the image behind me. And it's attractive. You want to come here you, want to see this beautiful beach, it is quiet. There's no one here it is gorgeous.
 
But the weather is going to change. And when it does, it will be rapid. And when it does, it will be dangerous. Not necessarily because of the wind, although you will definitely notice it, but because of the storm surge. Derek is talking about the fact that it could be between six and 12 feet of storm surge.
 
That would be the double the size of Derek himself where he is standing, water coming up that high and coming at you fast with ferocity. It is an absolutely imperative that you try and get your things together, get your pets ready and get to higher ground.
 
Now authorities have been saying look, you don't have to travel hundreds of miles, make sure you fill that gas tank up but you don't have to go hundreds of miles. You don't have to go to another state. You just have to get out of the low lying areas.
 
The areas that you're seeing right there, the beach it is flat. When these waters get pushed up onto the beach, they come at you very, very, very quickly.
 <br>[09:15:00]
 
You do not want to be anywhere near there when that happens when those first bands start coming in, we know that people have been preparing. We know that this is extremely frustrating and it's unsettling for people who love where they live.
 
They love their home, they don't want to see anything happen to it, but you don't want to be in that home and dealing with all this, because the emergency services will not be ready to take action during the major part of this storm.
 
They have to keep themselves safe. And so you will have to wait for assistance because if the water is surging, if it is coming, no one can get to you. We saw this so many times in so many storms. The most important thing is your life. The most important thing is a life of your family and your pets. Take care of that first. Everything else will fall in line. Back to you guys. SOLOMON: Thank you Sara and we heard DeSantis say, you have time to do that that being prepared, but you have to do it. Now Sara Sidner live for us in Clearwater. Thank you, Sara. Coming up for us, will Donald Trump's former Chief of Staff turn codefendant Mark Meadows went his court battle in Georgia while the judge's decision could be a game changer.
 
Also, Russia releases rare footage of detained American Paul Whelan inside a prison. What he says happened the first time a TV crew tried to tape him. Also a deadly shooting at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, this morning police are searching for a motive and the shooters weapon, we'll be right back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:20:00]
 
SOLOMON: Welcome back. This morning there are several highly significant questions still outstanding as Donald Trump's legal and political worlds further collide. Question number one, when will Trump's Georgia trial be held the day that DA Fani Willis wanted, March 4?
 
Well, that is now officially the start of the Federal Election trial. It's also one day before Super Tuesday, with primary scattered throughout and March 25. Taken, the timing is getting trickier. Number two, will Meadows get his federal court move? A judge has yet to issue his ruling after Trump's former chief of staff took the stand.
 
And number three, will the former president be in Georgia next week? Arraignment is set for September 6. And last night one co-defendant entered in early not guilty plea. CNN's Evan Perez joins us now, Evan, a lot of moving parts here. Where do we start?
 
EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Rahel, that's a very crowded calendar. And as you pointed out, the judge in Washington, Judge Tanya Chutkan already chose March 4 as the day that her trial, the trial here in Washington is going to get started. And that's a day before Super Tuesday.
 
And what we're looking at is given the prospect that the prosecution has said that their case is going to take you know, four to six weeks to present. That means that the former president is going to be sitting in a courtroom here in Washington, not on the campaign trail during those key periods there when other states are up for grabs. Other delegates are up for grabbing the Republican nomination.
 
That's a huge imposition, obviously, on a political campaign. And the judge really addressed all of that saying that the public interest to have this matter resolved as soon as possible is really the thing that is driving her. She said from the bench that sending a child aid does not depend and should not depend on the defendants personal or professional obligations.
 
And of course, you know, for the Trump team, they're also trying to figure out whether Mark Meadows succeeds in his effort to move his case out of state court in Georgia, to the federal courts. Because that decision, which the judge said could come at any point at any time, and will really have an impact not only on other defendants, there's four of them who have asked for their cases to be moved to federal court as well. But the Former President who hasn't made that request, we fully expect will do so, we saw his trial team in the courtroom yesterday in Atlanta.
 
So they were closely watching and they watched as Mark Meadows stood on the stand for three hours really taking a risk answering questions, both from the prosecution and from his own team, answering questions that really I think every prosecutor is going to be paying attention to his words, given the fact that he was testifying before the Georgia officials have even been able to present their case against him, Rahel.
 
SOLOMON: Yes, that could have implications but also what the judge decides with this Meadows case, of course, could have huge implications not just for Meadows, but for others as you pointed out. Evan Perez live for us in Washington. Thank you, Evan, for us.
 
SANCHEZ: Let's get some legal perspective now from Jessica Roth. She's a former federal prosecutor for the Southern District of New York. Jessica, thank you so much for being with us. Let's start with a statement from Donald Trump that he's going to appeal the March 4 trial start date, can he actually do that?
 
JESSICA ROTH, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NY: So he can't at least not now, a judge has enormous discretion to set the schedule in their courtroom, including the trial date. So this is something that is not going to be immediately appealable. I doubt very much that we would see his lawyers actually following up on what Trump has said, and filing a motion to appeal.
 
It may be that at some future date, if there is a conviction that the early trial date could be part of the grounds for an appeal based on ineffective assistance of counsel or some other reason. But I very much doubt that we're going to see even a motion to appeal at this point. And certainly even if it were filed, I doubt very much that an appellate court would consider that.
 
SANCHEZ: And so, let's talk about what we saw yesterday in Fulton County, Georgia. Evan spoke about the former Chief of Staff at the White House Mark Meadows, taking a risk by going on the stand and giving testimony. Why is that risky for him?
 
ROTH: So there are a number of reasons why it's risky for somebody who is facing criminal charges to take the stand especially at this early stage. Anything he says can be used against him as a matter of evidence law whether in a future prosecution in this case or in some other case for example in the January 6 DC case where he's not currently charged, but he potentially be.
 <br>[09:25:00]
 
So anything would be admissible in court against him, even though otherwise, he has a Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. So they can be used against him. If he does take the stand in some future case, these statements can be used to cross examine him and to impeach him, for example, if they're inconsistent with what he later says, at a future trial.
 
Once he's had the opportunity to consider further what his testimony might be informed by the discovery he's going to be seeing from the government. So it's risky because the statements can be used against him.
 
SANCHEZ: Yes, that makes sense. So the decision from the judge supposedly coming very soon, but his arraignment is also coming soon as it is for all the other co-defendants on September 6, I believe. Does a decision need to come before the arraignment?
 
ROTH: The decision doesn't need to come before the arraignment. I believe the judge said he was mindful of the September 6 date.
 
SANCHEZ: Right.
 
ROTH: I believe he said that Meadows needed to show up for arraignment on September 6 in the event that the judge had not issued an opinion in Meadows favor before then. But I think the judge clearly wants to move this along.
 
The other defendants are going to be watching to see not only the judge's ultimate decision, but the reasoning behind it in evaluating whether they too want to seek removal to federal court once the arraignment happens on September 6 that actually starts the clock for purposes of the deadline for other defendants who have not yet done so to file a motion to remove their actions to federal court so for example, the Former President will have 30 days after he is arraigned in which to file a similar motion.
 
SANCHEZ: Yes, Jessica, very quickly. One co-defendant in Fulton County, Ray Smith, he's already pleaded not guilty. He skipped his arraignment anything to read into that?
 
ROTH: No, I think that's probably just somebody trying to move things along. Perhaps he has other things he needs to take care of in the interim, focusing on his defense. I don't think we should read too much into that.
 
SANCHEZ: All right, Jessica Roth thanks so much for the expertise. We appreciate it.
 
ROTH: Thank you.
 
SANCHEZ: Rahel?
 
SOLOMON: All right, Boris coming up for us hundreds of flights are canceled. And Tampa's airport is now closed. That's ahead of a hurricane Idalia's arrival in Florida. Coming up, we will look at the storms potential impact as we near the busy Labor Day travel weekend, we'll be right back.
