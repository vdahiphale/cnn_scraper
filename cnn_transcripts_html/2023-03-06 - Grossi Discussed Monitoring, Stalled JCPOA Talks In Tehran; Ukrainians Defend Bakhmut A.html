BECKY ANDERSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: I'm Becky Anderson live from Abu Dhabi. This is CONNECT THE WORLD. Coming up this hour. A potential nuclear 
 
 climb down. I'll speak to the head of the AIEA freshly back from Tehran.
 
Zelenskyy vows to keep defending besieged Bakhmut. Thousands take to the streets of Israel to protest the government's judicial plans.
 
And later in the show. Mo Salah's as a magical night at Anfield.
 
We start with a nuclear progress report out of Vienna. Iran set to allow increased monitoring of its nuclear facilities. Now the head of the U.N.'s 
 
 nuclear watchdog announcing that information today amid growing international concern over Iran's nuclear activities. Rafael Grossi say and 
 
 I quote him here. "Concrete access will be given to certain individuals a uranium enrichment sites."
 
Just last week, uranium particle enriched to well beyond stated limits were found at undeclared sites. Grossi says, Iran will assist in an 
 
 investigation of those articles. Well, he traveled to Tehran after the discovery of those particles which were enriched to near weapons grade 
 
 level. He talked with high-level officials about access for monitors and efforts to jumpstart talks on reviving the nuclear deal.
 
And Rafael Grosi joins me now live from Vienna. So, it's very good to have you. How did you find your meetings with the leadership?
 
RAFAEL GROSSI, DIRECTOR GENERAL, INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY: Thank you very much. It's good to talk to you again. Well, indeed, like you just 
 
 said, we come after a few weeks of serious findings on top of an already long, protracted process of trying to clarify a number of issues related to 
 
 the Iranian nuclear program without much, much results. And this is what prompted me to go there and to meet with the leadership.
 
What I think was important was my first meeting with President Raisi. I saw again, the Foreign Minister and the nuclear establishment, so to speak, in 
 
 Iran. And I think we were able to get a few concrete results there which I would qualify as steps in the right direction. Certainly, yes.
 
CHURCH: All right. Let's drill down on what you did learn then because enriched particles up to 84 percent. At that's what came out in your most 
 
 recent report. That is close to weapons grade, sir. And that is worrying. Was -- what answer did Iran give you to explain these particles? Because, 
 
 of course, Iran has denied those accusations and called those claims conspiracy.
 
GROSSI: Well, I don't know how they call him. I can tell you what we did and what we do -- what we are doing. We found through environmental samples 
 
 and samples that we took in a particular cascade, you know, the cascades were the centrifuges, the machines that enrich uranium are located. We 
 
 found that one particular spot, there was a reading of 84 percent, almost 84 percent, you know, weapon grade is around 90 percent.
 
So, we questioned, we asked them about this. Iran has indicated that this could have been a peak in the -- an, you know, an oscillation if you want, 
 
 an unintended oscillation in the -- in the work of that which is technically --
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
ANDERSON: Rafael Grossi, do you buy -- do you buy that account?
 
GROSSI: I don't buy or sell, I just check. And now what we are doing is precisely looking with our inspectors and their experts into the 
 
 functioning of this cascade to see whether indeed, this was just an oscillation, a technical oscillation to a high -- very high peak or whether 
 
 this was something else. What I can tell you is that in any case, oscillation or not oscillation, there hasn't been an accumulation.
 <br>[10:05:07]
 
Hasn't been production at that level. In any case, it is very relevant. We have to check this is the case because that facility is supposed to be 
 
 reaching out already a high level, which I think I have discussed with you in the past of 60 percent which is already quite high. But this was, of 
 
 course, quite unexpected. And this is why we have open this technical discussion, which at the moment is ongoing.
 
ANDERSON: All right. OK. Let's park that conversation then for a moment. Iran has stonewalled the IAEA's investigation into three past undeclared 
 
 sites. In your statement after the trip and I just want to quote you here, you said, regarding the outstanding safeguards issues related to the three 
 
 locations, Iran expressed its readiness to continue its cooperation and provide further information and access to address the outstanding 
 
 safeguards issues.
 
I have to ask. What sort of further information and access will Iran provide?
 
GROSSI: As you may understand, this is a bilateral process. This is a sort of an inquiry, an investigation we are carrying out, right? So, what we -- 
 
 what we do is we request them to clarify certain information to -- if possible to talk to people in some cases, it may require us, again, 
 
 sampling material or sampling pieces of equipment to see whether there is correspondence. This is like a forensic investigation.
 
So, at this point in time, you know, telling you we're going to see X, Y or Zed does not add too much. What we are doing now is starting this process 
 
 or kickstarting it, because it has been ongoing, for a very long time actually. And we have been frustrated --
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
ANDERSON: Last year Iran gave answers that were not technically credible. That's what you said last year. They gave us that weren't technically 
 
 credible. What makes you believe that it will be different this time?
 
GROSSI: Well, to begin with, the fact that they have accepted to continue this process, because for them, their answers were that, and that was that. 
 
 They said we this is what we believe happened or what happened. And we said, well, no, we have analyzed your replies and we find that for 
 
 technical reasons, the things cannot have happened as you describe them. And we were in a sort of an impasse.
 
So, now what we decided is that we are going to be looking into other things and that we are going to try to clarify this. What the final -- some 
 
 colleagues of yours say, well, how do you know this will be set? Well, of course, I don't know. The important thing is that we have picked up where 
 
 we left it. And this is positive in the sense that I am going to be able to continue with this probe. And until now, I have been stopped.
 
So, of course, we hope for a clarification or resolution. But I cannot tell you now today, whether they are going to be successful or not.
 
ANDERSON: Understood. Understood. Last year, Iran removed camera equipment that monitors its nuclear program. Are you confident that it will reinstall 
 
 those monitoring cameras? Because this conversation and any further conversations with Tehran, you know, are useless if you do not have those 
 
 eyes on what is going on, sir, with respect.
 
GROSSI: I agree with what you said. I am confident this will happen. Of course, we have to agree on certain modalities when we go, how we do it, et 
 
 cetera. But I am confident. Yes.
 
ANDERSON: Does this pave the way from your perspective to at least get talks revived? And do you see that as feasible given that since the talk 
 
 sort of broke down, what nine, 10 ago, the U.S. and the Europeans have massively hardened their stance towards Tehran.
 
GROSSI: Let me put it that way, Becky, if you allow me. I would say that without this, without us being able to tell the JCPOA partners and the 
 
 world in general that we have a pretty good idea of what is there in Iran, any return to JCPOA or anything else would be rather frail because you 
 
 would not know on the basis of what you are entering an agreement. So, my impression, I don't know if paves the way, I think it should but perhaps 
 
 this is the eye of the beholder.
 <br>[10:10:04]
 
Some may feel that it's not enough, some -- but what I can tell you is that for sure without this, without us regaining some degree of visibility, at 
 
 least, I would never be in a position to say this is the situation. So, people may enter or not any agreements. So, I believe it is an 
 
 indispensable factor in the equation. And in this sense, you can really see it as a positive element, hopefully for these negotiations on which we're 
 
 about to do, of course.
 
ANDERSON: Israel suspected of attacking Iranian nuclear facilities. You've condemned any attack on nuclear facilities. Are you conveying that message 
 
 to this current Israeli government? And are they listening?
 
GROSSI: Well, I'm not conveying messages to the -- to the Israeli government. All I'm saying, and I say this, with regards to any country, 
 
 any place, you know, at the moment, I'm so worried about Zaporizhzhia which has nothing to do with Iran. I believe that attacking a nuclear power plant 
 
 is -- first of all is illegal. And it's not an opinion. It's something that since the 1940s, you know, there's legislate international law and they had 
 
 -- there have been resolutions.
 
I don't want to bother or bore your audience with legalese, but it is absolutely outside international law. But I would never go into polemics 
 
 with Israel, of course, or any other country. All I'm saying is nuclear power plants. nuclear installations should not be attacked be it in 
 
 Zaporizhzhia or in Iran or in any other place. This is a word, my mandate in terms of nuclear safety, security, the world indicates but of course, I 
 
 don't want to enter --
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
ANDERSON: Let me get an update from you on Zaporizhzhia because I know that you are increasingly concerned about what's going on. Ukraine says the 
 
 diplomatic efforts have stalled. Just how critical is the situation around that plant at present?
 
GROSSI: Well, it's very serious because as you know, first of all, that is the overall situation, which is very fragile, because the plant is light on 
 
 the -- exactly on the front line. And we know that increased military operation combat is supposed to be, you know, in the -- in the -- in the 
 
 rise. So, the general situation is very worrying. We continue to see a lot of military activity in the vicinity of the plant, the plant has been 
 
 shelled in the past several times.
 
So, this is why my efforts continue. And it is my obligation, my duty to continue with this -- with these efforts. And I don't see these 
 
 negotiations are stalled or dead or anything else. I continue, I know how difficult it is to get to compromise. But what would be the situation if 
 
 the head of the IAEA threw his hands up and said, well, there's nothing else I can do. Of course, we can come to agreements and I'm positive that 
 
 we will be able to do that.
 
ANDERSON: With that, we'll leave it there. We thank you for your time. Obviously, your insight and analysis on both the Iran story and on 
 
 Zaporizhzhia in Ukraine and the other facilities, incredibly important. So, thank you very much indeed.
 
GROSSI: Thank you so much for the opportunity.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
ANDERSON: Just back from Teheran. Let's get you to CNN's Melissa Bell now in Ukraine. Melissa, we've just heard from Rafael Grossi there about the 
 
 nuclear plant in Zaporizhzhia. How aren't Ukrainians dealing with that situation?
 
MELISSA BELL, CNN PARIS CORRESPONDENT: Well, they're extremely worried about it, Becky, because what they fear the most and this is from Ukrainian 
 
 energy officials, the helm of their main stage utility. They say the problem is that through satellite imagery, they get an idea that this 
 
 nuclear power plant, remember, there's been in the hands of Russian forces now for a year, Becky, is being used as a de facto military base.
 
It's something we'd seen when Rafael Grossi himself came to Zaporizhzhia last August, and it's something that appears to have continued. Their real 
 
 fear beyond the occupation of it as a military base is actually that this could be in their words a slow-motion disaster. Where they for the most 
 
 desert there is a slow progressive, inevitable degradation of the facilities there with a number of the reactors still not functioning.
 
They can see through satellite surveillance, what they see as constructions being made around it. The Russian authorities say that this is about 
 
 protecting the site but the Ukrainians point out that this is illegal and the -- their lack of access to it I think is one of their biggest concerns, 
 
 Becky.
 <br>[10:15:08]
 
ANDERSON: Meantime, on the ground on the most fierce battle still ongoing around Bakhmut in the Donbas with Ukraine vowing to keep defending the 
 
 city. We know, it's besieged, it's been besieged for weeks and weeks. And it certainly seems as if the talk is that it is about to fall to the 
 
 Russians. What do we know about what's going on? And again, it should that be the case? Just how significant a move would that be by the Kremlin?
 
BELL: We've been hearing -- we've been hearing this morning, Becky, for the American Defense Secretary Austin Lloyd saying that this is wouldn't so 
 
 much be a strategic loss and we shouldn't read into the fall of Bakhmut shooting when it happens. Any turning of the tide in favor of the Russians 
 
 on the ground because a tactical retreat at this stage on the part of the Ukrainians would make sense.
 
And yet that's not what they're doing. The message very much from Kyiv this morning that they intend to hold on with President Zelenskyy holding a 
 
 meeting with his senior defense officials, after which it was announced that not only are they holding on to it but sending more men in.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BELL (voice over): Ukrainian forces giving all they can to defend Bakhmut or what's left of it. After the longest battle of the war, one of the 
 
 oldest cities in the Donbas lies in ruins.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): There were no orders, no decisions were made regarding withdrawal from Bakhmut. There have been no tactical 
 
 changes, we are holding the defense.
 
BELL: Abandoned by more than 90 percent of its population over the course of the seven months siege, only those who couldn't leave before are left. 
 
 The intense fighting means that only five to 10 people a day can now be evacuated compared to the 500 to 600 a day when the evacuation started at 
 
 the end of February according to the city's deputy mayor.
 
The Russians throwing all they have at the city says the deputy mayor. Heavy artillery, mortar fire, airstrikes and a substantial commitment of 
 
 ground forces both regular soldiers and Wagner Mercenaries. But Russian advances have come at huge cost. Wave after wave of Russian soldiers have 
 
 been sent to their deaths. And Ukraine has accused Russia of exaggerating its gains, claiming they still control one of the major highways into 
 
 Bakhmut.
 
A lifeline for Ukrainian defenders, with one Ukrainian commander tweeting that there are many ways still to get into the city.
 
Analysts have questioned the strategic importance of Bakhmut but that has not stopped Moscow's intense campaign to capture the city. Nor Ukraine's 
 
 existential fight to keep it. The unceasing barrage of artillery fire hasn't just killed or forced out most of the city's civilians. It's taken a 
 
 huge toll on Ukrainian soldiers too, as the battle turns to close quarters street fighting. 
 
But Ukraine continues its fierce fight for victory, even as Russian forces continue to close in on a city that's already a byword for Ukrainian 
 
 resilience on the battlefield.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
BELL: Beyond Becky, that symbol that Bakhmut has become the Ukrainian strategy appears to be holding on to it for every extra hour, every extra 
 
 day that they can because the belief is that by doing so, every piece of equipment they draw from the Russians into the town, every Russian life 
 
 they take is that much gained as they try and prevent any further Russian advances and hold that front line as strongly as they can, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Melissa Bell is in Kyiv. Melissa, thank you. And you can go to cnn.com for more expert analysis on the situation in Bakhmut. Find out how 
 
 a Russian victory there could come at a heavy cost and why some believe Ukrainian withdrawal from the city would not be a disaster but should be 
 
 considered a routine battle tactic. You're watching CONNECT THE WORLD. Standby. Still ahead this hour.
 
Israel's protest -- Israeli's protest for a ninth straight week over proposed changes to governments checks and balances. We'll have the very 
 
 latest on that coming up.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:21:58]
 
ANDERSON: In Israel, police estimates around 150,000 people demonstrated in Tel Aviv at the weekend against a judicial overhaul fanned by the 
 
 government of Benjamin Netanyahu. As you can see in this video, they were met with some resistance by the police. It marked the ninth week of 
 
 protests railing against the change to the judiciary.
 
Joining me now to break this down from Jerusalem is Elliot Gotkine. And organizers, Elliot, put the number of protesters significantly higher than 
 
 150,000. And this wasn't just in Tel Aviv, we've seen demonstrations across the board and some real criticism coming from some very influential 
 
 players. For example, in the United States and elsewhere. How big a problem is this becoming for Prime Minister Netanyahu?
 
ELLIOTT GOTKINE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Becky, I think it's becoming a potentially existential problem for Benjamin Netanyahu. It's not just the 
 
 hundreds of thousands of protesters that you're seeing on the streets. Every weekend, there was also a midweek protest last week or so-called Day 
 
 of Disruption when roads were being blocked. There's another one planned for this week as well.
 
It's not just those people you're seeing on the streets. It's not just the criticism you're seeing from important people in the United States. For 
 
 example, all living former heads of the Israeli Air Force today, writing to the Prime Minister calling for him to, you know, try to find some kind of 
 
 amicable solution here. You've got Air Force pilots in one particular elite squadron, many of them saying they plan to strike to miss their training 
 
 session this week in order to take part in this week's day of disruptions.
 
You've got economist, professors, you've also got the evidence on the financial markets. You've seen the Israeli shekel the currency, weakening 
 
 against the U.S. dollar this year whereas most major currencies around the world have been strengthening against the U.S. dollar. And even allies like 
 
 former Mayor Michael Bloomberg. And of course, head of the eponymous company that at full disclosure I used to work for penning an op-ed in the 
 
 New York Times today talking about Israel courting disaster, warning that it's imperiling alliances, security, the economy and even democracy itself.
 
And saying that as far as the economic damage potential damage is concerned, Mike Bloomberg writing, this could make the cost being paid by 
 
 the U.K. for Brexit looked like bupkis in his word. So, criticism from all around. President Herzog still trying to persuade the government to come to 
 
 some kind of accommodation with the opposition, no sign of that. This government has been trying to ram through these judicial reforms which 
 
 effectively might remove all checks and balances on the government, for example, by removing the Supreme Court's right to strike down laws except 
 
 in very narrow circumstances.
 
And enabling the government to pack the Supreme Court with judges of its own choosing. Ultimately, of course, this could also mean the scrapping of 
 
 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's ongoing corruption trial. So, those judicial reforms are still making their way through the Knesset. The 
 
 Israeli parliament protests are continuing on our set to continue the President trying to broker some kind of accommodation but no sign of that 
 
 just yet. Becky?
 <br>[10:25:08]
 
ANDERSON: Fascinating. Worrying times. Elliot, thank you.
 
Let's get you up to speed on some of the other stories that are -- on our radar right now. And thousands are homeless after a massive fire tore 
 
 through a Rohingya refugee camp in Bangladesh. And this happened Sunday in Cox's Bazar. One of the world's largest refugee camps. No casualties, 
 
 thankfully reported so far, but officials are investigating the cause of that fire.
 
Well, CNN has learned that more than 50 people have been killed in clashes between rival gangs in Haiti. A human rights group says the violence went 
 
 on for days last week in the capital of Port-au-Prince. Dozens of people are also missing.
 
And protesters have clashed with police in Greece almost one week after the devastating train crash that killed 57 people. You're looking at scenes 
 
 outside the Parliament in Athens on Sunday. This is people in Larissa. The candles and a makeshift memorial for the victim. Stationmaster has now been 
 
 detained. He blamed the collision on a technical fault but later admitted to making a mistake. His lawyer says he is being completely honest.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
STEFANOS PANTZARTZIDIS, LAWYER FOR TRAIN STATION MASTER (through translator): The accused said everything. He told the truth. He was 
 
 devastated. He said exactly what happened without fear that his words would make him bear more responsibility. If from what he said there is evidence 
 
 that constitutes criminal offenses against him, it is something that justice will decide.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: You're watching CONNECT THE WORLD with me Becky Anderson from our Middle East Broadcasting headquarters here in Abu Dhabi.
 
Still ahead. More Iranian schoolgirls poisoned. Now Iran Supreme Leader is speaking out. What he is saying should happen to those responsible. That is 
 
 after this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: Welcome back. I'm Becky Anderson in Abu Dhabi. You're watching CONNECT THE WORLD.
 
Your headlines this hour are as follows. Russian forces to be on the verge of capturing Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine. That will be the first time Russia 
 
 has taken the Ukrainian city in eight months.
 
One Ukrainian soldier says Russians have been attacking with mortar and artillery for hours. Ukraine vowing to keep defending the city.
 <br>[10:30:02]
 
U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke about that operation while on a visit to Jordan. He said that if Ukraine repositioned in some areas to the 
 
 west of the city, he would not view that as a setback. He added that he sees Russia continuing to -- for him what he called ill-trained and ill-
 
 equipped troops which are quickly being taken out, he said. 
 
Wel, the head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog says Iran will allow more monitoring of its nuclear facilities. Rafael Grossi says "Concrete assets 
 
 will be given certain individuals that uranium enrichment sites and that Iran will assist in an investigation of their weapons grade Ukrainian or 
 
 uranium particles found at undeclared sites."
 
Well, a big and unforgivable crime. That is how Iran's Supreme Leader describes what has become a spate of poisonings of schoolgirls in his 
 
 country that have been going on for months. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
AYATOLLAH ALI KHAMENEI, SUPREME LEADER OF IRAN (through translator): This is a
 
 crime against the most innocent part of society meaning children, and it's causing fear and insecurity in the minds of society and concerns families. 
 
 These are not small matters, these must be seriously pursued.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, more than thousand girls have been poisoned since November according to state media and government officials. But who is responsible? 
 
 Well, Nima Elbagir has been taking a deep dive into this story for us. She joins us now from London. What have you been able to nail down at this 
 
 point, Nima?
 
NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT: Well, evidence is very difficult to sift through, Becky, at this remove. 
 
 Especially given the role that Iran's authorities are playing in terms of asking parents, medical officials, and those at the forefront of these 
 
 incidents not to speak out. Take a look at this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
Furious parents outside in Education Office in Tehran. Challenging Iranian authorities desperate for answers.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (text): Right now, my eight-year-old is at home.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (text): I am scared. I am scared.
 
ELBAGIR (voice over): After what is believed to be the worst day of incidence of suspected poisonings at girls' schools. These videos were 
 
 filmed on Saturday which marks the start of the school week in Iran.
 
For months now, Iranian school girls and their families have been speaking out about incidents of suspected poisoning. The numbers of incidents 
 
 reported to CNN in the dozens. Then over the weekend, dozens more. CNN was able to verify these new incidents using video and witness testimony across 
 
 10 provinces. The U.S. and others are calling for Iran's authorities to investigate these incidents.
 
But speaking to CNN, medical sources say they have been barred by hospital administrators from sharing details of symptoms and test results even with 
 
 the patient's parents. We dub this doctors voice for his safety.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I am inside Iran, my phone is being monitored. I can't share any more with you.
 
ELBAGIR: Iran's interior minister after months of vague statements now says suspicious samples have been found and being assessed at laboratories. 
 
 Parents though say they don't trust authorities to investigate.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): To hell with this country and its rulers, we would be better off without a leader. This is our country. They 
 
 don't know what they're doing. They don't even have medicine.
 
ELBAGIR: All the incidents begin in a similar manner as described to us by students. A noxious smell and then I felt dizzy and fainted. I had dimness 
 
 of vision and heart palpitations. All of us had identical symptoms, palpitations, my hands and legs were numb and frozen. I was shaking, we had 
 
 tears coming out of our eyes.
 
With no one so far held to account and parents no closer to answers, many continue to risk their lives to challenge Iran's authorities.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ELBAGIR: And if the Ayatollah and the Interior Minister's comments gave parents some hope that something was being done by Iran's authorities. Now, 
 
 Becky, the deputy Health Minister has come out and denied that there are any incidents of suspected poisoning. So, you can imagine it's only 
 
 amplifying the uncertainty and the fear that so many of feeling inside Iran.
 
ANDERSON: Nima, I do want to just talk to you briefly about some of your previous reporting. A U.S. Senate committee wants the United Nations now to 
 
 investigate a network of secret Iranian torture centers brought to light by you and your team. Just explain where we're at with this.
 
ELBAGIR: Well, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee essentially acts as the lead on U.S. foreign policy for the U.S. government. So, this move by 
 
 the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Chairman Bob Menendez is -- it's a huge vindication for the bravery of those sources who spoke to us, Becky.
 <br>[10:35:07]
 
But beyond that, it also speaks to the U.S. being more willing increasingly, to use multilateral international organizations. The U.S. was 
 
 part of that international mandate for the U.N. Human Rights Committee. And there had been a lot of concern with the Iranian authorities' repression of 
 
 the process in Iran, that perhaps the international community and the U.S. had given away, much of its ability to pressure Iran by the escalation of 
 
 the sanctions.
 
The rapid escalations under former President Trump. Now what we're seeing with this latest move is the U.S. sending the message, well, if we can't 
 
 work just bilaterally and individually, we're going to start using international institutions and definitely those we're speaking to inside 
 
 Iran back are -- that they were very happy to see this move, they felt very vindicated.
 
ANDERSON: Nima, keep up the good work. And you can find them as full investigation pinpointing more than three dozen so-called black sites used 
 
 to brutalize protesters into submission. U.S. Senator Bob Menendez is calling it the latest example of the Iranian regime's cruelty and says the 
 
 international community should hold Tehran accountable.
 
Well, coming up. Liverpool Football Club is in seventh heaven today. A record defeat of Manchester United and an individual milestone for one 
 
 player in particular.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: Well, after nearly two decades of talks about 200 countries have agreed to a treaty aimed at helping protecting the world's oceans. Now this 
 
 was an historic wind for environmentalists that could bring 30 percent of our oceans under protection by the end of the decade. Oceans are the heart 
 
 of our planet covering about three quarters of the Earth's space and producing about half of the oxygen in the atmosphere.
 
They drive weather systems and absorb large amounts of carbon dioxide but all too often those bodies of water that nourish our planet are treated 
 
 like dumping grounds. You've seen it. The creatures living the sea are overfished and climate change has warmed waters around the globe. That is 
 
 melting polar icecaps, bleaching coral reefs and intensifying hurricanes floods and droughts.
 
Right now, only about one percent of those areas are protected. But the treaty aims to limit fishing and certain waters, consolidate shipping lanes 
 
 and require environmental checks on deep sea mining. And there is also an agreement to share marine genetic resources which was a sticking point in 
 
 negotiations since they have potentially lucrative pharmaceutical uses. Well, activists have been lobbying for years to get more regulations on the 
 
 high seas because international waters go largely unregulated.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JANE FONDA, ACTRESS AND ACTIVIST: -- them. We're pooping in our kennel. We're supposed to be so smart. We're destroying things we don't even 
 
 understand. We are not behaving right and why the treaty is important is it will force us to behave right. And to save this great ally that we have 
 
 called the ocean, the one ocean on this blue planet that can save us. There's a lot at stake
 
 Countries.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Countries now have to formally adopt and ratify that treaty. It's got to be good news.
 
Well, if Mohamed Salah wasn't already considered a Liverpool legend, the Egyptian certainly cemented his place in Merseyside folklore last night. 
 
 His electric performance earned him his 128th and 129th Premier League goals. Making him the club's all-time top goal scorer in England's most 
 
 elite competition. It is amazing to think is accomplished that feat in just six years. And back in 2018, before the Premier League wins, the glorious 
 
 champions League Knight and Big Cup titles.
 
I met with the young man down at Liverpool docks and asked him just how he would cope with the status of icon.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MOHAMED SALAH: Of course, it's a great feeling, you know, to feel that -- feel the love from the first here is a special feeling for me. But, you 
 
 know, something makes me work harder and think more positive and of course, you know, now the people everyone is looking to like you have to do 
 
 something, every game you have to do something. So, that's also more pressure, but it's something huge to be hero for this city. It's something

ANDERSON: Well, it certainly got bigger and bigger for him. I think we can all say he has lived up to that pressure. 
 
Mo Salah wasn't the only one celebrating last night. Of course, his teammates were absolutely ecstatic too. That is because they defeated arch-
 
 rivals Manchester United seven goals to nil. You heard that right. Seven nil. That's seven goals. It's an unprecedented result marks Liverpool's 
 
 biggest win over Manchester United ever, which is what makes it unprecedented I guess.
 
I'm doubling up here. World Sports' Amanda Davies joins me now. It was a -- it was already a great -- a great weekend of football and then this. How 
 
 big was it?
 
AMANDA DAVIES, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR: Well, I mean, seventh heaven or seventh hell, depending on which side of the second encounter you set. And Becky, I 
 
 love my job. But I have to say today was one of those days I would quite happily have not come to the office to talk about this because it was 
 
 dreadful from a Manchester United perspective. There's bad and then there's awful.
 
But, you know, this was a match that everybody went into. It has great history. It has great rivalry. But Liverpool with a team with question 
 
 marks against their name. United with a side who just won their first trophy since 2017. And on riding a crest of the Erik ten Hag wave and it 
 
 came absolutely crashing down on United last night. Liverpool's biggest ever win in this fixture. United's heaviest defeat in over 90 years.
 
Ten Hag asked his team to go into the training ground early this morning. You wonder what has been said behind those walls at Carrington. But we're 
 
 looking a little bit more about the repercussions of this which will be talked about for years in just a couple of minutes.
 
ANDERSON: Here. I'm sorry. This pain is going to on and on at least through the next 15 minutes for you. Thank you, Amanda. World Sport after this 
 
 short break. I'm back after that. Stay with us.
