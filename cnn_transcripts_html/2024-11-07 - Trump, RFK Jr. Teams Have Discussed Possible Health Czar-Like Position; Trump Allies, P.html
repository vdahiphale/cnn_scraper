THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
<br>[07:30:00]
 
SARA SIDNER, CNN ANCHOR:  A lot of people watching that and looking at whether or not maybe they can buy a house if it goes down or maybe their credit card debt goes down a bit. What are you hearing?
 
MATT EGAN, CNN REPORTER:  Well, Sara, this might be the easiest Fed decision for the next several months because the Fed had long been signaling plans to cut interest rates today and Wall Street is expecting the Fed will do just that. The market is pricing it at about a 99 percent chance, 98 percent chance of a quarter of a point cut today. That would come after the Fed cut rates in September by half a point -- that supersized interest rate cut. 
 
Interest rates are still high. They're still close to two-decade highs, but as you can see on that chart they are starting to come down which, yes, it is good news for people who are struggling to pay credit card debt, for people who are -- have a home equity line of credit or they're thinking about getting one, or financing the purchase of a car. 
 
But the big question really looming over the Fed right now is how does this Trump victory change things going forward. Does the Fed maybe dial back its plans to cut interest rates in the coming months because they're concerned about inflation? How do they think about the fact that Trump has proposed all of these tariffs and how inflationary that could be?
 
And another big question is how is Fed chair Jerome Powell going to work with this next Trump White House? Because remember, Trump and Powell -- they have a controversial, testy kind of relationship, right? I mean, Trump nominate Powell, but Trump's also been very critical of Powell and some of his moves. Trump has argued that the president should have a greater voice in interest rate policy.
 
So we should expect a lot of questions today to Powell along all of these fronts and exactly what changes for the Fed now that Trump is going to be the next president -- Sara.
 
SIDNER:  I know you will be watching all of the machinations, Matt Egan. Thank you so much -- appreciate it -- John.
 
EGAN:  Thanks, Sara. JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR:  All right, Matt's done a great job explaining all these economic proposals that may soon be policy. 
 
All right. New this morning, control of the House of Representatives still undecided, but House Speaker Mike Johnson is already making his pitch to keep his job. In a letter to Republican colleagues, Johnson writes, "I'm humbly asking for your support to continue leading this conference as your speaker. It has been the honor of my lifetime to serve with you thus far and I look forward to playing the biggest offense of our lives. We have a country to save, and we will."
 
With us now, CNN political commentator and Republican strategist Shermichael Singleton, and Michael Blake, founder and CEO of Kairos Democracy Project. 
 
Shermichael, I am so curious now that the election is over --
 
SHERMICHAEL SINGLETON, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Yeah.
 
BERMAN:  -- and we're looking toward the future. Republicans and the Trump -- incoming Trump administration will claim it has a mandate. That's what you do when you win. The question is a mandate to what and how quickly?
 
SINGLETON:  Well look, they can mandate to do a couple of things to address economic concerns and inflationary costs. I think, too, secure the border. That's still a big concern for a lot of Americans out there. 
 
And I think foreign policy -- while that doesn't really register as a high mark on most polling data that we have available, people are worried about it. They're worried 1) how much money are we going to send to countries like Ukraine? They get the importance. But I guess the ultimate question is what is the end goal? What does success look like? How long does it take us to get there? 
 
And finally, do we avoid sending actual troops to a conflict over there or potentially if China decides to invade Taiwan, what does that look like?
 
So I think those three things are principal concerns of most American people. If I'm Trump, I'm trying to appoint people who are experienced, who have trust. That signals to the American people we are ready to resolve these solutions on day one.
 
BERMAN:  What do you think he wants to do most quickly and most, to use a word he might use, most bigly?
 
SINGLETON:  I think the biggest thing is going to be inflation. We're wondering if the Fed is going to lower interest rates any further. 
 
I think you also need to potentially address the housing issue. What does that look like in terms of increasing the number of available and affordable housing within the market thus decreasing rates so that younger people can afford to buy their first homes? Those two things, to me, I think are big. And if the president can
 
 move the needle just a little bit within the first 90 days, that will signal success.
 
BERMAN:  All right, Michael, where do you think Democrats should work with the incoming Trump administration, and how do you think exactly they should try to check it, and where?
 
MICHAEL BLAKE, FOUNDER AND CEO, KAIROS DEMOCRACY PROJECT, FORMER VICE CHAIR, DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, we should check it by actually telling the truth, unlike Shermichael. So let's be clear. 
 
The first thing that the Trump team has stated is that they want mass deportations on day one, which is actually not what Americans actually want. And practically doing that would lead to jobs that people are not able to fill, And so I'm trying to understand how that addresses the inflation concerns. 
 
Second, if we're actually talking about addressing cost of living and economic concerns, then the Trump tariff plan would not do that. Taxes went up on consumers in his first term. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center said that there would be $1,800 less income for Americans if his policies are enacted.
 <br>[07:35:00]
 
And so when we think about what's happening right now it is the responsibility of focusing on the two issues that people said they wanted to focus on: the economy and democracy. 
 
And so, what should we do as Democrats? Make it very clear how our proposals actually would help you as opposed to the Trump lies. 
 
This is a Trump white Christian nationals' agenda that was focused on and continues to be focused on deporting Black and brown people as immigrants, saying they want to defund public schools that teach Black history, and implementing a national ban on abortion. 
 
Democrats must be the counter on that at every possible level to make sure that our democracy actually has a chance of thriving.
 
BERMAN:  So, specifically, on two of those broader policies, tariffs and some parts of immigration, those are some areas where Trump may be able to act almost unilaterally with executive action -- on parts of it -- on parts of it, Michael. 
 
So how would you propose then Democrats make their case or try to influence it?
 
BLAKE:  Democrats, we have to be very clear of calling them on who they is. Donald Trump is a white supremacist who has a Project 2025 agenda that wants to implement that. And anyone who voted for those policies need to be clearly counted on that. 
 
So very practically, John, to your question, the mass deportation of immigrants on MLK Day, which is when Inauguration Day would be, would hurt our economy in damaging ways. Make it very clear that their proposals are about the whitening of America rather than the strengthening of America. 
 
Second, when we talk about the economy, we actually laid out policies that would help people create jobs. If you focus on what has to happen in terms of startup businesses, you actually focus on a minority business development agency. That is how you can actually create jobs on the ground.
 
And so very practically, when you see what happened on Tuesday it was, in particular, white men and white women who unfortunately decided to not vote for the vice president -- yet they elected Black women on the Supreme Court in Michigan. Yet, we had victories and Ruben Gallego is going to win Arizona. Yet, we had victories in North Carolina.
 
It was the fear of a Black and South Asian woman that we have to speak about. And we're not clear about race, gender, and class. We are ignoring the truth of what's happening in the country right now.
 
BERMAN:  Shermichael, one of the things that you just heard from Michael was this idea of mass deportation. I say idea -- it's a proposal --
 
SINGLETON:  Sure.
 
BERMAN:  -- or a promise from Donald Trump there. 
 
I have heard from some Republicans who absolutely support severe action on immigration --
 
SINGLETON:  Um-hum.
 
BERMAN:  -- that they are concerned with how Trump might implement that; in that it might be handled in a way that is unsettling to the greater population. 
 
How do you think they should go about that, or what do you think the parameters might be?
 
SINGLETON:  Look, I do, I guess, question what the systematic approach would be. This is an interesting topic to me.
 
In 1988, Vice President Harris' father, who is an economist -- renowned economist who taught at Stanford for a number of years -- wrote a very interesting treaty. He was talking about immigration at the time and how an influx of illegal immigration creates competition for lower-skilled Americans. And I thought that was fascinating. 
 
So if that's the premise of the argument from the Trump administration -- or the incoming administration, I certainly understand it. And so the question for me becomes if you're going to remove criminals, I think most Americans would say yeah, that makes perfect sense. 
 
In terms of people who are actively working in the country, what is the approach for them to become legalized citizens? What does that look like? How much time does it take? Is there a fee or a fine associated with them coming into the country illegally and having stayed for so much time? 
 
I think most Americans will say well, that's an approach that seems logical. I can understand it. It's systematic. It makes a lot of sense. You're not harming people or ripping people across -- or families apart.
 
So that's how I would personally want to approach this, John. Remove criminals. In terms of other individuals that are contributing to our society, have a systematic approach for them to gain --
 
BERMAN:  And Dreamers, too.
 
SINGLETON:  -- citizenship.
 
BERMAN:  What about the Dreamers?
 
SINGLETON:  Yeah, and the Dreamers. I would put them in that --
 
BLAKE:  (INAUDIBLE).
 
SINGLETON:  Well, hold on Michael. I'm not done yet. Just give me a second.
 
I would also put Dreamers in that same category. 
 
BERMAN:  Right.
 
SINGLETON:  You need to allow people to have an approach to earn their citizenship. And again, people who came in illegally but are contributing, there should be some type of a fine associated. President Obama talked about it in the past. Hillary Clinton talked about that in the past. I think you could see bipartisanship agreement on that point.
 
BERMAN:  Michael, we really have 15 seconds left because we've got to go but go ahead.
 
BLAKE:  The anti-Blackness that just happened in Shermichael's comments is very concerning. Look, the reference he just utilized is the vice president's father when talking about a policy on illegal immigrants. 
 
Let's be very clear. There is one entity that has been pushing this, and this is Donald Trump. And that is why Democrats have to counter that every step of the way. 
 
SINGLETON:  Well, Michael -- John, I mean, most Americans are worried about immigration. I didn't use an anti-Black policy, Michael. You're not talking to Donald Trump. John asked me my specific points on this. This is how I would address it. I think a lot of Democrats would also say --
 <br>[07:40:00]
 
BLAKE:  Your specific (INAUDIBLE).
 
SINGLETON:  -- this is systematic. 
 
BLAKE:  (INAUDIBLE) to find one example from 1988 referencing the vice president's father, which is --
 
SINGLETON:  I can list -- I can list a litany of examples, Michael. Let's not call BS this morning. Immigration is a problem.
 
BERMAN:  Listen --
 
SINGLETON:  Most Americans find it to be a problem, including many Democrats.
 
BLAKE:  (INAUDIBLE). 
 
BERMAN:  Friends, we're going to -- we've got to -- we've got to end this discussion here.
 
BLAKE:  Thank you.
 
BERMAN:  We will have it -- we will have it over the next several months and it very much seems the next several years.
 
Shermichael Singleton --
 
SINGLETON:  Thanks, John.
 
BERMAN:  -- Michael Blake, I appreciate you both being with me this morning -- Kate.
 
KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR:  So there are questions swirling about Robert F. Kennedy Jr. right now and what role he is going to play in the next Trump administration. We do know that the president-elect has told RFK Jr. to "go wild" on America's public health agencies. 
 
Now, Kennedy is a well known vaccine skeptic. He has been a dominant force in spreading conspiracy theories about vaccines for years, leaving people who work in health and public health searching and worrying what that means for the future of public health.
 
Here is what he said after Trump's victory.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR., (I) FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I'm not going to take away anybody's vaccines. I've never been anti-vaccine. I'm going to make sure the scientific safety studies and efficacies are out there, and people can make individual assessments about whether that product is going to be good for them.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOLDUAN:  CNN's Meg Tirrell is tracking this one, and she's going to be tracking this one for quite some time I think Meg. 
 
The scientific safety studies -- aren't they already out there?
 
MEG TIRRELL, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, Kate. I mean, we saw this during COVID. Of course, it was a tremendously expedited process that we saw there under the Trump administration -- one of its great achievements, a lot of people in the public health world said. 
 
But this typically happens over many, many years. We see animal studies, then clinical trials that take many years to go through. Once these vaccines have shown their safety and efficacy in large clinical trials they go to the FDA for review. The FDA reviews it and often brings in outside advisers. 
 
We saw this during COVID, too. Those are public hearings. Anybody can tune in and listen to these things. They last all day and usually they're very boring, but they put all the data out there. 
 
The companies themselves publish pages and pages -- hundreds of pages of data. The FDA publishes its own review of that in case it disagrees with the way the company is presenting the information. All of that is out there for the public to review itself as well. 
 
The advisers often take a vote or make a recommendation. The FDA decides whether or not to approve a vaccine. If it approves the vaccines, then it goes to a panel of outside advisers to the CDC. We saw this during COVID as well. 
 
They have a public hearing, and we get to watch all of that and see all of their slides and all of their data. They make a recommendation about whether a vaccine should be added to vaccine schedules. How often people should get them. Who should get these vaccines. 
 
The CDC director then decides whether to accept that recommendation. And even after these get on the market there are many systems in place to monitor vaccine safety as they are out there, Kate.
 
BOLDUAN:  Yeah, and all of this -- all of these -- the experts and the -- and all of this happening with people who study and care deeply about public health and the health of children. I mean, it's not like anyone is out there trying to rush this through for some personal gain when it comes to these hearings and this review. That's why it's in place.
 
What are you hearing from people then in public health about RFK Jr. taking on some kind of leadership role in public health?
 
TIRRELL:  Yeah. There's obviously a lot of concern, particularly around vaccines -- these sort of conflicting statements that he says he's not anti-vaccine, but then he also tells folks like our own Kasie Hunt that -- or she pressed him in an interview on comments he made that there's no vaccine that's been proven safe and effective.
 
Public health experts are very worried not that he will get in there and find any data that haven't been presented and find real evidence that there's a problem, but that he'll erode confidence even further in vaccines. 
 
And we've already been seeing declining rates. They're still very high for things like the MMR vaccine (Measles, Mumps, and Rubella). 
 
But if you look at kindergarten vaccination rates over the past four to five years, they have been steadily inching lower. So they haven't been above that 95 percent threshold the CDC wants to get to since 2019-2020, and that's a real problem, Kate. That can lead to more spread of diseases, like measles.
 
BOLDUAN:  Absolutely.
 
Meg, thank you very much -- John.
 
BERMAN:  All right, getting new details this morning on how Donald Trump plans to follow through with those mass deportations he talks about.
 
And new video of the moment travelers and airline staff scramble to catch a raccoon that fell from the ceiling at an airport. Raccoon on the lamb.
 
(COMMERCIAL)
 <br>[07:47:57]
 
BERMAN:  This morning, Department of Homeland Security officials are bracing for a seismic shift on U.S. immigration policy. The mood among the agency is reported a mixed bag with many internally wondering if controversial Trump-era policies struck down by President Biden will be reimplemented. One official tells CNN there is a sense of optimism at the DHS after years of intense criticism under Biden.
 
CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is with us now. Priscilla, you have been at the forefront of covering immigration policy for years now and you've got your work cut out for you I think the next several months and years because it's about to get very interesting.
 
PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, it is, and Homeland Security officials are bracing for that. Look, they are well aware that there is often whiplash when it comes to immigration policies. And it's for that reason that there has been a mixed outlook in the department with some just shellshocked by the election results and others welcoming it because they want to see more border security under an incoming -- the incoming Trump administration.
 
Now, of course, senior advisers to former President Donald Trump have said that they are going to reverse Biden policies. They have also promised mass deportations. And I am now being told by multiple sources that Trump allies and some in the private sector have been quietly preparing for a largescale detain and deportation of immigrants. 
 
Now, one of the people that could be leading that is Tom Homan. He was a former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. And when he has talked about this in the past publicly, he has described it as a targeted operation. 
 
But a key element of any type of mass deportation plan is detention space. If you're going to arrest someone you have to have somewhere where you are going to put them. And on that front, I am told that some in the private sector have been preparing for that. There were ongoing discussions even before election night to set up that detention space, and now they are planning for that to pick up over the next several days and weeks.
 
Now, when asked about this, Brian Hughes, a Trump senior adviser, said the following. "President Trump won a landslide victory Tuesday because Americans embrace his common sense policy to secure our border and implement mass deportation for illegal migrants."
 <br>[07:50:10]
 
Now, John, of course, anything like this is going to be costly. In fact, we know from previous studies that to apprehend, detain, process, and remove an undocumented immigrant -- it can cost nearly $11,000. Add onto that the cost of transporting them back to their home country.
 
Now, I have posed this question to multiple sources and they say well, one way around that is to reprogram funds. The Department of Homeland Security has done it before. But this would be a magnitude of change when it comes to an operation like this. 
 
But John, I can tell you that from the multiple people I've been talking to there are preparations underway to do something like this. What it ultimately looks like and when it can be done is a question we'll keep asking.
 
BERMAN:  Yeah, what gets done and how -- huge questions. Priscilla Alvarez, I know you'll be on it. Thanks so much -- Sara.
 
SIDNER:  OK. And now to a former senior Trump administration official who quit the first Trump administration, calling Trump unstable and a danger to democracy, is now urging conservatives of conscience, as he put it, to join the incoming Trump administration; not run away from it.
 
When Miles Taylor worked inside the first Trump administration, he published an anonymous op-ed in the 2018 New York Times article decrying Trump's leadership or lack thereof. Now, in a new op-ed, he says "Principled people must serve in the second."
 
Miles Taylor is joining us now.
 
Why are you calling for Republicans to join Trump when you quit, really, in disgust with what you had seen?
 
MILES TAYLOR, FORMER TRUMP DHS SENIOR OFFICIAL (via Webex by Cisco): Well, Sara, look, I think there's a very, very clear reality that we saw on election night, which is that the Never Trump movement failed, and it failed catastrophically to try to swing the party back to the sort of Bush-Reagan era. The Trump era is in full effect and it's evident that the party is not going to go back to where it was before.
 
So those of us that were pushing for a return to how the GOP was we need to acknowledge that if we want to shape a conservative agenda then it's going to be having to shape the MAGA movement. It's going to be having to shape Trump's orbit and making sure that there are people who actually adhere to conservative values going to work with him.
 
Now, you know, people like me, Sara, have been progenitors of the notion that there was a resistance in the last Trump administration. That resistance was just people trying to prevent him from doing things unlawful. What we hope to see in a second term is people who do the same thing but also, at the same time, try to advance a reasonable conservative agenda.
 
SIDNER:  I'm curious why you think, though, that Republicans would be accepted who have wanted to put guardrails in place when it doesn't seem that is who Trump is surrounding himself with necessarily.
 
TAYLOR:  Yeah, it's a great question, Sara. I mean, look, at the end of the day, people are policy and that's something that took Donald Trump a long time to figure out. He hired a lot of people who he did not know in the first term, and folks that ended up getting very frustrated with his lack of understanding of government. 
 
But this is a different time. Trump's coming in also as a different and much more seasoned and experienced operative. He knows a little bit more about how government works. 
 
The good news, I think, is there are quite a few people that did serve in the first term, especially in national security positions, who could be steady hands on the wheel. Who don't want the president to do unlawful things but do align with traditional Republican values. 
 
And that's what I'm hoping happens in this second Trump administration is that those people go in. Even though they saw the tumultuousness and the turbulence of the first term, they are not dissuaded from going in and serving our country, and if they have to that they say no if something unlawful is proposed. 
 
SIDNER:  I do want to ask you about some reporting we just heard from our Priscilla Alvarez. Trump's allies and some in the private sector are ramping up preparations to deal with what could be a huge mass deportation of migrants residing in the U.S.
 
You were a senior official in the Department of Homeland Security. How do you think this will go down?
 
TAYLOR:  I think it's going to be dramatic. I would -- I think people should prepare on day one that Donald Trump is not going to do symbolic things as it relates to the border. There's a range of actions he could take. I'll describe them as from mild to wild, including everything up to invoking the Insurrection Act to deploy the U.S. military to seal the southern border.
 
I think we should take very seriously that Trump might go towards that wild end of the spectrum. And he feels vindicated in doing so because it is one of the top issues that the American people voted him back into office for, and people are very frustrated that there hasn't been action on this. Now, what I would say, Sara, is if the future President Trump wants to solve the border for the long run, he cannot do it without Congress. That's where Biden failed. That's where Trump failed the first time. It's where Obama and Bush failed. 
 <br>[07:55:00]
 
The only way to really fix the problem is you have to get Congress to close the loopholes. And if there was one thing Trump could do to solve it, it would be sort of a Nixon goes to China moment and to collaborate across the aisle to try to get comprehensive immigration reform. If he doesn't do that, no matter what he does through executive orders there will still be a crisis.
 
SIDNER:  And there was a bipartisan bill that was agreed upon, but he tanked that. We will see what happens. Also, whether or not Republican take the House. They have already taken the Senate. That would make a big change in how quickly that might pass. 
 
I want to you quickly take a look at some of the people that are being floated as potential officials in Trump's second administration. You have people like Elon Musk. You have RFK Jr. You see Tulsi Gabbard, Elise Stefanik, Sen. Tom Cotton, and the rest.
 
What do you make of these folks here joining the administration?
 
TAYLOR:  Look Sara, I think it's better than it could have been. I mean, honestly, a lot of us were concerned that it would be campaign operatives that would come into senior positions in a second Trump administration -- people who had no experience in government. 
 
Just take an example. Two people being considered for Secretary of Defense, Tom Cotton, as you mentioned, and Mike Pompeo. Both have served for a long time in government. But have been Trump loyalists, yes, but they also know the national security community extremely well and they're not the type that you would consider to be unexperienced political operatives. So I do think there is some cause for optimism there.
 
And you mentioned Elon Musk. And while a lot of folks may not like Elon Musk's politics, beyond Elon, a lot of people in the technology sector that previously weren't politically active are considering coming into the administration. Folks that do have a lot of experience in emerging tech, competition in emerging tech. And I think that's giving folks another silver lining of optimism of the types of folks that are more qualified than you'd expect coming into serve in a second go-around. 
 
SIDNER:  Miles Taylor, thank you so much for talking to us and bringing an interesting conversation to the table. Appreciate it -- Kate.
 
BOLDUAN:  So, Rudy Giuliani has been ordered to appear in federal court today after two Georgia election workers who he owes millions of dollars to now accuse him of hiding assets. The judge, you'll remember last month, ordered Giuliani to turn over a
 
 lot of things, like his Manhattan apartment and other valuable items, to Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss because he was found liable for defamation and falsely accusing the two of ballot fraud during the 2020 election. That never happened. And Giuliani was ordered to pay them nearly $150 million. But where is all of that? 
 
Lawyers for the -- lawyers for the two women say Giuliani has emptied out most of his apartment. Giuliani's attorney says that the things were -- that the things that were in there are now in a storage facility in Long Island.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Hey, can someone get this (bleep) raccoon? (Bleep).
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOLDUAN:  A new mascot for LaGuardia. No, just kidding. A wild moment for passengers who were waiting to check in at the Spirit Airlines counter at LaGuardia Airport. Out of nowhere that adorable raccoon falls through the ceiling and does a hilarious and strange high wire act but does not stick the landing, I will say -- which leads to people running -- obviously, clearly running away. And finally, someone trapping it.
 
Spirit Airlines put out a statement they probably never thought they'd have to, talking about after they did locate it -- locate and release the animal and are now addressing the matter with a professional wildlife control company. 
 
The Australian breakdancer known as Raygun who went viral during the Paris Olympics is retiring from competitive breakdancing. She says it's all because of the backlash that she did face online over her Olympic performance. The 37-year-old was mocked online after losing all three of her round robin battles. Rachael Gunn says that she will though continue to breakdance, just not competitively -- John.
 
BERMAN:  I want to go back to the raccoon.
 
BOLDUAN:  Oh, really?
 
BERMAN:  And this issue is what? It didn't have priority boarding?
 
BOLDUAN:  Um, I think -- yeah. I think it -- I think it tried to budge the line. And you know what? That's unacceptable for those of us who paid for the priority seating on Spirit.
 
BERMAN:  You've got to board with your zone. 
 
BOLDUAN:  Yeah -- no.
 
BERMAN:  Clearly, the raccoon didn't know that.
 
BOLDUAN:  I mean -- but you know what? A-plus credit for how he tried to budge the line.
 
BERMAN:  Yeah.
 
BOLDUAN:  I mean, I've never considered actually swinging from the ceiling and now I know what to do.
 
BERMAN:  Yeah.
 
All right, happening now, world leaders bracing for the impacts of a new Trump term. He has promised to slap China with huge tariffs and end the wars in the Middle East in Ukraine, but how? 
 
CNN's Nic Robertson joins us this morning. Nic, what are you hearing from around the world?
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATINAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR:  Yeah, John. Look, President Trump, when he becomes president in a few months, is going to face a different world from the one that he left behind when he last left the White House. 
 
There is an alliance between China, Russia, Iran, North Korea that didn't exist before. We know that Donald Trump likes to deal with individual leaders and break them out of alliances. 
 
Of course, when he comes in, those very significant wars going on that he's going to vow -- that he is vowing to end. But I think that's the sort of big take to challenge as he comes in.
 
BERMAN:  And what do think the most pressing issue to watch is?
 
ROBERTSON:  Ukraine. Look, right now you have almost 50 European leaders meeting in Budapest. A top line issue for them is Ukraine. President Zelenskyy is there, the NATO secretary general is there. All these leaders -- these European leaders who are there are making the right noises.
