WHITNEY WILD, CNN ANCHOR:  Welcome to our viewers in the United States and all around the world. I'm Whitney Wild, in for Christine Romans. 
 
A dangerous new storm system is headed to the West Coast, with heavy rain, mountain snow and strong winds. The Pacific Northwest we'll get it first, California gets it tomorrow, this is right on the heels of that storm that shut down a stretch of I-70 in Colorado for nine hours, leaving drivers stranded. 
 
Meteorologist Chad Myers is live in the weather center. 
 
Chad, these storms had millions of people under alerts right now. There's just no relief. It's been one thing after another.
 
CHAD MYERS, AMS METEOROLOGIST:  And there are still two more to the west, still to come onshore for Monday and into Tuesday. So, yeah, the storm that was in Denver yesterday has now taken its energy and focus it down here to Lake Charles. Some of the weather overnight in Houston, and, Beaumont. It's move to the east of you. 
 
But there is the storm system for the west. We have already had 2 to 4 inches of rainfall here, in a lot of snow in high sierra as well, but more snow and more rain is coming, flash flood watches in effect here, or rising rivers in parts of California. And then, of course, when you get into the higher elevations, winter storm warnings are posted. 
 
I'm not kidding. This could bring some spots ten feet of new snow in the next 48 to 72 hours. This is a major event for the high sierra. And this is good news. This is the rain and the snow which will run off into the reservoirs. And last into spring in some spots.
 
Now, by eight o'clock, the weather moving through into the low parts, into parts of Mississippi and Louisiana, finally spreading off to the east later on to the today. As I move you into tomorrow night, there could be some showers in New York City, and also even into L.A. for maybe ringing in the New Year. If you're going to be standing out there, Times Square, make sure you have a poncho because this is going to be kind of a wet day. They don't allow umbrellas anymore. 
 
Showers across the Northeast for today and tomorrow, and that's still going to be warmer weather than we should be having at this time of year. So tomorrow, take 50 degrees and New York anytime. 
 
WILD:  Oh, absolutely. T-shirts, flip-flops, jogging shorts, the whole thing. 
 
All right. Chad Myers --  
 
MYERS:  Ponchos.
 
WILD:  Exactly. All right. Chad Myers, thank you. 
 
The death toll from the winter storm in western New York is on now up to 40, almost all of those, 39, where in Erie County. 70 people were found not side, 11 people were found inside, other people were found dead in their cars, as some people died after shoveling snow or because EMS just couldn't get to them in time. 
 
Officials warn that the number of deaths is likely to climb as the medical examiner reviews cases. 
 
CNN's Miguel Marquez has more from Buffalo, New York. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MIGUEL MARQUEZ, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  The death toll rising as Buffalo continues digging out. The scope of this disaster still coming into focus.
 
MARK POLONCARZ, ERIE COUNTRY EXECUTIVE:  Unfortunately, there are families in this community who still have not been able to identify where a loved one is. They're missing, and we do have still John Does. And eventually those family members are going to find out the worst news possible.
 
MARQUEZ:  Enock Rushikana lost his nephew, Abdul Sharifu.
 
So, it's a big Congolese family here. What have you lost?
 
ENOCK RUSHIKANA, ABDUL SHARIFU'S UNCLE:  An angel. We lost an angel in our community. We lost an angel.
 
MARQUEZ:  Sharifu was married last year. His wife due to give birth to their first child next week, a son. He was working two jobs saving up to buy a house. His uncle overcome with grief.
 
RUSHIKANA:  I'm sorry.
 
MARQUEZ:  He says, Sharifu went out in the storm to help another family. His car got stuck. His body found over a mile from it. It appears he was trying to walk home and got disoriented. 
 
RUSHIKANA:  Abdul was known as helper in our community. 
 
MARQUEZ:  Violeta Quinones' husband died after shoveling snow. 
 
VIOLETA QUINONES, HUSBAND DIED AFTER BLIZZARD:  He walked to the bathroom, and at that point he collapsed. MARQUEZ:  But emergency crews were not able to immediately help, says

UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Another two brush. Thank you. 
 
MARQUEZ:  The community handing out food, making due until grocery stores can reopen. 
 <br>[05:05:00]
 
PASTOR JAMES GILES, BACK TO BASICS OUTREACH MINISTRY:  They cripple the community in doing that. Now the people that could walk around the corner or walk across the street to a store to get services much needed food items and those kind of things, they don't have that anymore. That is the fallout from all of that. Trauma on top of trauma that's taken place in our community. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
MARQUEZ (on camera):  So, the city of Buffalo is starting to feel like it's getting back to normal, those welfare checks that authorities have been doing are just about done, though they are still trying to identify some of the individuals into the county morgue here, the ban on driving has been lifted across the city, in all areas that were affected by the storm, and the flooding that they were concerned, about the temperature has really gone up and will continue to stay high for the next few days, they are not as concerned about flooding now. They think it will not be as bad as they were unofficially concerned, but this is a storm that is going to haunt this city, for years to come. 
 
Back to you. 
 
WILD:  And hopefully it results in some changes moving forward. 
 
Miguel Marquez, thank you.
 
Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg promising to get tough on Southwest Airlines. He's threatening penalties if passengers aren't paid back for the money that they lost when Southwest canceled thousands of flights. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
PETE BUTTIGIEG, SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION:  The airline said to me that they were going to go above and beyond what is required of them. I'm looking to make sure that they actually do that, and if they do not, we are in a position to levy tens of thousands of dollars per violation, per passenger in fines. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) WILD:  So far this morning, Southwest has cancelled only about a few dozen flights and that is a far cry from the 2,300 flights canceled yesterday.

PATRICK KEANE, PICKING UP LOST LUGGAGE:  I'm just glad to be here, and I'm glad I have my bag and they better give me some compensation for a week.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  See you later.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Thank you.
 
VALENCIA:  Amid the mess, stories of compassion with Southwest passengers coming together to help one another. Like the three strangers from Wisconsin stuck at the airport in St. Louis who ended up carpooling to Milwaukee.
 
ALEX TICK, TRAVELER, CARPOOLED WITH STRANGERS:  He had seen my packer hat and, you know, nice Wisconsin guy assumed I was going to Milwaukee.
 
VALENCIA:  Or the Denver couple stranded in Minnesota, struggling to rent a car who ended up hitching a ride with a stranger.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  And she jumped right up and she said, if you guys want to join me on going to Denver, I'd be happy to take you guys.
 
VALENCIA:  Sadly for some, the outcome is a little more heartbreaking like it is for this St. Louis bride forced to cancel her wedding in Belize.
 
KATIE DEMKO, MISSING WEDDING DUE TO SOUTHWEST ISSUES:  We were in -- I was in shock. We tried to rebook and there was nothing. Southwest actually booked me on a flight for January 2. My wedding is tomorrow, December 30.

Nick Valencia, CNN, Atlanta. 
 
WILD:  Welcome news but hopefully it's not too late for some of those travelers. 
 
While tributes are pouring in for Brazilian soccer player Pele, who died at the age of 82 after a battle with cancer. He's being remembered as a man who transcended the sport, not only as a champion of three World Cups but for giving to the less fortunate, and placing his country in the global spotlight.
 
So let's go to CNN's Amanda Davies. She's live in London. 
 
He was one of those, once in a generation talent that is just so much more than the sport, and so much more than an athlete, I'm in he was a titan among mere mortal, so let's start there. In what way did he change the way that soccer was viewed across the world? And particularly in America he changed that.
 
AMANDA DAVIES, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR:  Yeah, perhaps you would go forward then once in a generation, an absolute one-off. There's not many people who would sellout the giants stadium for a farewell exhibition match, but that is exactly what Pele did, the final match before the 1st of October, 1977, a game between his two former clubs, New York Cosmos and Santos, attended by the likes of Muhammad Ali, and Bobby Moore.
 <br>[05:10:12]
 
He was credited with a huge rise of soccer or football in the United States and in the NASL after he joined Cosmos in 1975, he was one of the clubs who played tribute in the last 24 hours saying, O Rei, as Pele was known, he treated fans to numerous legendary moment on the pitch, including scoring a hat trick to win the 1977 and as soccer ball. 
 
During three seasons with the Cosmos, Pele helped transform the domestic landscape of the sport of soccer where once there had been baseball diamonds, now there were also soccer pitches. And as with so many moments in his career, where Pele went so many others followed, absolute legends of the game of football, the likes of France Becker, Bobby Moore and Carlos Alberta. 
 
If you give me, or forgive, me a personal moment. I want you to show you a photo that I've grown up with on the wall at home. A man on the right here is a player called Dennis  Tueart. He is the play for Manchester United here in England, and he moved from Manchester to New York, I'm not sure you're really able to see it. But he, there he, is Dennis is on the right. He moved from Manchester city in England, to New York to play alongside Pele. He stood there with his wife, Joan, and my parents, David and Susan.
 
And when he moved from New York, to New York, he sold his house to my parents in Manchester. And they became very good friends, my mom and dad loved that trip where they were able to meet Pele in New York. And I remember growing up hearing Dennis's stories of the joy of going out, training on the same field as his boyhood idol, the flare, the swagger, his white suits and the gold watches. 
 
And what is so special about, Pele is it's not just people within football playing tribute to him, but others. He transcended other sports, and all aspects of society. We've heard from the likes of Usain Bolt, from Barack Obama, and these tributes suspected to continue over the coming days with the weights set to get underway on one day. 
 
WILD:  Amanda, thanks so much for sharing that. You know that the obituaries in the newspapers have this common theme about transcended the sport, but in some ways it was like transcending Earth. There were so many people who said that they would go out onto the pitch and play against, him and try to convince themselves that he was a man just like they were. And they would walk away saying, no, he was born somewhere else in this universe. 
 
Again, someone, talent like that come around so infrequently. And he will be sorely missed, but the legend will live on.
 
Amanda Davis, thank you so much. 
 
All right. Turning now to Washington. The House Ways and Means Committee will release six years of Trump's tax returns. Trump fought for years to keep them secret. The committee said last week that the IRS failed to audit Trump's taxes as required during his first two years in office. 
 
Just ahead, the invitation that just extended from Russia's Vladimir Putin to China's President Xi Jinping.
 
Plus, banning TikTok harmless dance videos, or is this a serious security threat? First, hiding in plain sight. Why didn't the lies of George Santos get
 
 in front of the national media? Why didn't they get in front of the national audience? More on that next.

Then there were tensions between Wilde and lead actress, Florence Pugh.
 
And video seemed to show Styles spitting on Chris Pine during a press tour, which his spokesperson denies.

As soon as Ticketmaster's pre-sale began, the heavy demand snarled Ticketmaster's Web site. 
 
Thousands of Swifties were in line for hours, and many left empty- handed when Ticketmaster suddenly canceled the pre-sale. 
 
Swift blamed Ticketmaster for the snafu, saying it's been excruciating, but nothing stopped her ultra-loyal fans from supporting the pop star.

ELAM:  Smith resigned from the Academy and was banned from attending any of their events, including the Oscars for the next 10 years. 
 
He apologized to Rock and is trying to move on. He's currently seeking redemption in Apple TV's "Emancipation," already getting some 2023 Oscars buzz.

NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER:  Well, China has long been one of the main allies between President Putin and behind Russia over the course of this ten-month invasion of Ukraine. That was certainly a sentiment that we heard from President Putin, his opening remarks ahead of the virtual meeting. He said the relations between the two nations are at their best ever.
