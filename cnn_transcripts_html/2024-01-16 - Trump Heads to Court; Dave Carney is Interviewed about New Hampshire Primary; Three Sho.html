PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN ANCHOR: Well, just moments ago, you saw this, Donald Trump's motorcade was seen leaving Trump Tower in New York City, heading to federal court, this time for E. Jean Carroll's second defamation case against the former president. It comes after a jury last May found Trump liable for sexually abusing and defaming Carroll. Today's trial involves comments Trump made about Carroll both while he was president and after the verdict. 
 
POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR: Our Kara Scannell live outside the courthouse with more. 
 
OK, gearing up for what's about to happen. He's going to choose to be in court. He didn't go for her whole trial, by the way, before after a big win in Iowa. The judge has been interesting about what he said that Trump cannot do in court. 
 
KARA SCANNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, good morning, Phil and Poppy. 
 
So, Donald Trump will be arriving momentarily to this courthouse where he will sit through jury selection in this trial. It will also be the first time he has been in a room with E. Jean Carroll since the alleged rape took place. Remember, a jury did find Trump liable for sexually assaulting her and defaming her and awarded her $5 million. So at this trial, E. Jean Carroll is seeking more than $10 million in damages, and Trump will be here in person where he's not required to be. He did not attend the first trial. 
 
Now, this judge moves pretty quickly. So, we expect him to seat a jury today. And then it will move into opening statements. Carroll's team will have their opportunity to make their case. Trump's team will be able to put on their defense. And then it will get into the witnesses. 
 
Of the witnesses we do expect E. Jean Carroll to testify again in this case, as well as calling some other witnesses, including an expert on damages. Donald Trump's lawyers say he wants to testify in this case. There's been a lot of back and forth about what he would be allowed to say because the judge has made it very clear they are not having a do- over. They are not re-litigating the alleged assault and they're not re-litigating the defamation. 
 <br>[08:35:02] He said Trump is liable for both in this case. 
 
And so the issue here will be damages. So, the question is, what can Trump testify to that relates to the damages. That is going to be one of the decisions the judge will have to make. 
 
Now, Trump's lawyer saying that he has a right to testify about his state of mind, that he didn't intend to defame her. But this will be something the judge will make real-time. 
 
Now, also interesting, Trump's team never qualified an expert on damages, so he will not have any expert to come forward to counter E. Jean Carroll's claims. This trial is expected to last just a few days. 
 
Phil. Poppy. 
 
HARLOW: That is interesting. Kara Scannell, thank you very much, for us. 
 
MATTINGLY: And joining us to discuss, CNN chief legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid. David Axelrod and Adam Kinzinger are back with us.
 
Paula, I understand the courthouse campaign kind of confluence that we've seen over the course of the last couple of months. I don't understand it in this case. 
 
PAULA REID, CNN CHIEF LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I don't get it either. 
 
MATTINGLY: Why - OK. Good. 
 
REID: He's setting himself up for some disappointment. I think this is going to be a lot more like what we saw last week with the federal appellate argument where you didn't see him go in, you didn't see him when he was inside, there was no role for him, and then he had this kind of hastily arranged press conference to get some attention. He's not going to get the return on investment here that he got last week in the New York civil case where there are cameras in the hall when you walk in, there's cameras when you walk out. He got a chance to talk. There's a pool spray. You have none of that here.
 
And, of course, he didn't participate in the first phase of this trial last year. So, he may not fully understand just how little attention there is to garner right now, especially today with jury selection. There's no role for him. 
 
HARLOW: But at the core of this case, which I think is so interesting, is about how much he will have to pay for what he said. And remember after he was found liable, he went on air with Kaitlan Collins on CNN and, again, according to E. Jean Carroll's team, defamed her once again after that. 
 
REID: Yes, it's surprising that he'd want to bring so much attention to this case, right? The facts have mostly been decided. We're once again talking about damages and sort of an inability to show any remorse or change. So, again, I don't think there's a great return on investment in terms of the whole, let's bring the campaign to the courthouse for this particular case and especially in this format. This is a federal courthouse. They don't play. There are no cameras. 
 
MATTINGLY: David, I mean, the clever thing is to ask you whether you would advise a candidate who's been found liable for sexually abusing and defaming someone to go draw more attention to that case, but I guess does he just -- 
 
DAVID AXELROD, CNN SENOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: But you're not going to be clever. 
 
MATTINGLY: I'm just -- it's not my jam. That's not how I roll. 
 
But the idea that this just -- you can keep playing this game no matter what the case is, no matter where the courthouse is -
 
AXELROD: Yes.
 
MATTINGLY: No matter the attention you're going to get there. 
 
AXELROD: Yes.
 
MATTINGLY: Is it viable? 
 
AXELROD: Well, I'd say two things. One is, there is no r on Donald Trump's gear shift. I mean his strategy is always go straight ahead, deny everything, you know, call everything a scam and a rigged deal. And I do think this is central to his project, his political project here, that the whole system is conspiring against him because he is speaking out for his flock and they're trying to stop him. And I think he's fitting everything into this. 
 
I'm sure there are people in his camp, he's got rational people working for him, who probably said, you know, it'd probably be better to be in New Hampshire today than in New York on -- at this very messy trial. But I think his attitude is, I'm branding this thing, and all of it as one piece. 
 
ADAM KINZINGER, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, he's really good at playing the victim. I mean he's -- he's actually really good at it. I mean it's like - I'll give him -- I'll credit him on that. He's always -- everything thinks he's the victim of everything. He thinks he's -- he's convinced people of it. And so I think by going to this, I mean, most normal, sane people would say, don't, don't draw attention to it, like we're talking here. But if you're a narcissist who plays the victim game over and over again and it's working for you, how best can you appear more of a victim except to walk into the lion's den of, you know, this conviction and say, I'm not scared of this. I'm a victim. Even this. Even this case against me is, you know, is some government corruption or whatever. And I think that's what he's doing is just like take it all head on. 
 
REID: Yes, you make a good point. I think with the narcissism, though, at some point you need attention. You need cameras. 
 
KINZINGER: Yes.
 
REID: You need that white hot light. And this is probably the most we're going to see of him, the motorcade heading to the court. I think that he may not fully realize federal court is really different than that highly accessible New York court that he was in later last week. No reporters in the hallways at federal court. 
 
AXELROD: Is there - is there no opportunity, Paula, for him to step outside somewhere and have a presser there?
 
REID: Sure, he can. And I bet that's what we'll see. I doubt he's going to step outside in the snow. But I think that maybe a hastily arranged, you know, press conference at one of his properties, like we saw, his fourth appearance last week when he was here in New York, probably something like that once he realizes there are no reporters roaming the halls in federal court, and there's no pool spray at the top. 
 
HARLOW: Thank you, Paula, David, Adam. 
 
MATTINGLY: Thanks, guys. 
 <br>[08:40:00]
 
Well, how will Trump's 30-point victory in Iowa impact the first primary in the nation. We're going to ask the dean of Republican strategists in New Hampshire as candidates sprint towards the granite state. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
KASIE HUNT, CNN ANCHOR: All right, so after we had some frigid fun in the subzero temperatures in Iowa yesterday, the CNN politics team, we have already made our way to New Hampshire. It is a balmy nearly 25 degrees here. Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis, of course, trying to make some sort of dent in Trump's -- basically the feeling of his inevitability, especially after his dominant win in Iowa. 
 
So, with one week left, what would it take to win here next week? There is no better person to ask than long-time New Hampshire Republican strategist Dave Carney, @granitewinger, who is here with me now. 
 
Dave, thanks for being here. 
 
DAVE CARNEY, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Glad to be here. 
 
HUNT: Let's talk about who actually is prepared to win in New Hampshire. Who is doing the work on the ground and who - and you - who you think might come out on top and why. 
 
CARNEY: Well, Trump has a real organization. A grass roots organization. They're doing block walking with volunteers. They're doing local phone banks around the state. They have good data. They're targeting the low propensity Trump people. And everyone else is running an event-driven campaign. Candidate comes to town, they try to build a crowd. They have a good, looks good. But when the candidate goes -- leaves Londonderry and goes somewhere else, there doesn't seem to be the kind of follow-up. You see this organically. People's yard - you know, front yards with signs. 
 <br>[08:45:02]
 
You know, Trump has people's yards. Other candidates are on the side of the road in the right-of-ways. You know, people have the - you know, their pickup trucks or the, you know, Trump banners. There's a neighbor of mine that has a gigantic banner nailed to the second floor of his house. People have pained 4 by 8 on plywood, you know, on their driveway. 
 
So, I just think the energy is with Trump. The huge victory and Eric Hollander, who works for Trump, be the first guy to ever oversee a win in Iowa and a win in New Hampshire at the same time, same cycle. 
 
HUNT: That we have see - I mean the most recent CNN poll showed Nikki Haley within single-digits of Donald Trump, which was part of what generated so much chatter about, well, maybe she could actually beat him. What do you see in those numbers? Because it sounds to me like when we were talking about this off camera, that this would mean an awful lot of undeclared people would have to vote for her. 
 
CARNEY: Right. So, the poll had about 45 percent undeclared, you know, independents in New Hampshire in that sample. That would be ten points more than was -- showed up in '16. So, I think it's -- you know, it's doable. But even with that, you know, almost 50/50 Republican and undeclared voters, she was still down, you know, pretty good single- digits, 7 or 8 points. And, you know, her underperforming in Iowa, you can spin it anyway (INAUDIBLE), it's a two-person race, you know, she lost to Ron DeSantis. And she was supposed to win Ron DeSantis. The poll, "The Des Moines Register" poll had her in second place. She came in, in third. Momentum is driven when you -- have you at third and you come in second, where you over performer. There was no over performing there. So, I think it's going to be a tough, a tough road to hoe. 
 
HUNT: So, Nikki Haley says this morning that she only plans to debate Donald Trump or Joe Biden. There were some potential debates between her and Ron DeSantis on the calendar here in New Hampshire. Smart move by her? 
 
CARNEY: Yes, I mean, you look at the other debate last week. You know, she and DeSantis, from the minute they said good morning or good after -- evening, they started trashing each other. They didn't stop for two hours. And voters were disgusted - would be disgusted watching that because they didn't talk about them. They didn't talk about their plans. It was my website or your website. You're a liar. No, you're a liar. I mean, they're politicians. Their lips are moving, they're both lying. 
 
But in reality they didn't talk to voters. And so I don't think it helped them at all. I think it hurt them. It made them small. And Trump is large. And they need to elevate themselves. So, it's a move - it's a smart move not to go one on one with anybody right now. HUNT: So, speaking of Trump being large, obviously his win in Iowa, it was above - you know, the over/under there was really 50 percent, right? And they hit it. What is the over/under here in New Hampshire on Tuesday? 
 
CARNEY: Well, I think they would be happy with a win right now. But I -- you know, him getting 50 percent in New Hampshire is possible. I think it will be in the mid-40s, you know. And the real question is, you know, Vivek people's, he's out. They're going to - you know, his 6 or 7 percent are going to go to Trump. You know, DeSantis is going to underperform. You know, Haley only got -- according to polling, was only getting 65 percent of the Christie vote. That was like 10 points. 
 
HUNT: Uh-huh.
 
CARNEY: You would have thought that she'd get 90 or close to 100 percent. And the real question is, how many undeclared voters come in. In Iowa, Democrats can switch on caucus night to register Republicans and switch out. 
 
HUNT: Right.
 
CARNEY: But, in New Hampshire, you've got to be an undeclared or a Republican. So, it will have an impact.
 
HUNT: Right.
 
CARNEY: But he's getting 20 percent of the undeclared, Trump is. So, I think he'll do mid-40s and it will be a pretty wide spread. 
 
HUNT: All right, Dave Carney, thank you very much. I hope you'll come back next time. We're back next week here in New Hampshire. 
 
CARNEY: Well, great. Come here early and often. 
 
HUNT: I love Shay Bushan (ph) in particular as well.
 
All right, today at noon on "INSIDE POLITICS" do not miss my colleague, Dana Bash. She's going to have a sit-down interview with Nikki Haley. She's also going to talk to New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu. Must watch TV. 
 
Poppy.
 
HARLOW: Kasie, thank you. That was a really interesting conversation with Dave. Glad - glad he came to join you. We'll get back to you in a second.
