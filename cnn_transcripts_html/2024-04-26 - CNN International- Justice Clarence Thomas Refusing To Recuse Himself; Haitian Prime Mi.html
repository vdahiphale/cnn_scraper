THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Points of contention and friction also focusing on areas of collaboration.
 <br>[04:30:05]
 
And we also have to note just the flurry of diplomatic activity that has led to this moment. Not that long ago, the U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, also paid a visit to China. Back to you, Max.
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN HOST: OK. Kristie, thank you so much for joining us from Hong Kong. 
 
Now, ahead, calls for a conservative Supreme Court Justice to recuse himself from Trump's presidential immunity case are falling on deaf ears.
 
Plus, Haiti at a crossroads. All eyes are on the new interim prime minister and transitional council tasked with restoring peace to the island ravaged by gun violence -- gang violence, that's just ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: Welcome back to CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Max Foster. 
 
If you're just joining us, here are some of today's top stories. Pro- Palestinian protests are expanding across the U.S. with law enforcement officers moving on demonstrators at universities in Georgia, New Jersey, California and several other states. 
 
Plus, the former publisher of the National Enquirer tabloid will return to the witness stand today in Donald Trump's hush money trial. On Thursday, he revealed secrets about the so called catch and kill deals involving a former porn star and a Playboy Playmate. 
 
Meanwhile, the U.S. Supreme Court is signaling that it will reject Trump's claims that he and all presidents should enjoy absolute immunity, but the justices could still give him a boost by potentially delaying Special Counsel Jack Smith's election-subversion trial. 
 
Now, despite a steady stream of calls for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas to recuse himself from that immunity case. He's made it clear he's staying put and apparently feels no need to share his reasoning.
 
CNN's Brian Todd explains why his involvement in this case is controversial.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): With no explanation, Justice Clarence Thomas again defies ethics concerns at the Supreme Court.
 
JUSTICE CLARENCE THOMAS, U.S. SUPREME COURT: Does the president have immunity? 
 
TODD (voice over): The conservative did not recuse himself from the case before the court involving former President Trump's claim of presidential immunity in the January 6th election subversion case.
 
Critics and watchdog groups had called on Justice Thomas to step aside from this case because of past efforts by his wife, Ginni Thomas, to reverse the 2020 election results in Trump's favor and because she attended Trump's Stop the Steal rally on January 6, 2021, just before the attack on the Capitol that day.
 <br>[04:35:04]
 
GABE ROTH, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, FIX THE COURT: A justice is required to disqualify themselves to recuse if their impartiality might reasonably be questioned. And the fact that we're even having this conversation over recusal means that reasonable people are questioning Justice Thomas's partiality.
 
TODD (voice over): In the weeks before she went to the Stop the Steal rally, Ginni Thomas, an ardent conservative activist texted Trump's White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, "Help this great president stand firm, Mark. Release the kraken and save us from the left, taking America down."
 
Mark Paoletta, an attorney who represented Ginni Thomas, wrote in a recent op-ed that her activities at the time were "minimal and mainstream." Still, ethics watchdog say Clarence Thomas should at least explain why he's still taking part in a case involving Trump's actions surrounding the insurrection, while his wife was associated with the insurrection. Why won't he explain?
 
JOAN BISKUPIC, CNN SENIOR SUPREME COURT ANALYST: There are no rules that would require him to comment on it. The signal is that he just simply does not find it necessary and doesn't feel he should even explain himself as other colleagues have done in the past.
 
TODD (voice over): Clarence Thomas also came under scrutiny after ProPublica reported he accepted luxury travel and gifts from several Republican mega donors.
 
Will there ever be consequences for Thomas? ROTH: I think that by and large, it is going to be an exercise in frustration and Justice Thomas will, you know, leave the court in 10 years or so, and they'll leave unscathed.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
TODD (on camera): The Supreme Court has not responded to CNN's requests for comment on Justice Thomas's refusal to recuse himself from the Trump immunity case. In an interview two years ago, Ginni Thomas said that while she did attend the Stop the Steal rally on January 6th, she played no role in planning the events that day and does not involve her husband in the political work she does. 
 
Brian Todd, CNN, Washington,
 
FOSTER: The New York Court of Appeals has overturned the rape conviction against Harvey Weinstein. It comes four years after the disgraced Hollywood producer was found guilty of felony sex crimes and sentenced to 23 years in prison. Allegations against Weinstein for more than 100 women helped launch the Me Too movement. Some of its leaders spoke out against Thursday's decision.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ASHLEY JUDD, ACTRESS AND WEINSTEIN ACCUSER: This is what it's like to be a woman in America, living with male entitlement to our bodies.
 
TARANA BURKE, FOUNDER, ME TOO MOVEMENT: We are devastated for the survivors who are connected to this case and the survivors who had found some solace -- some solace and catharsis in the original verdict around Harvey Weinstein.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: The appeals court has ordered a new trial stating that the use of witnesses to prior bad acts could not have been or shouldn't have been allowed. Weinstein will remain behind bars since he was convicted for rape and sexual assault in Los Angeles last year. 
 
Kim Kardashian headed to the U.S. Capitol on Thursday, the reality star joined Vice President Kamala Harris at the White House for a forum on criminal justice reform. The conversation comes a day after President Joe Biden issued pardons or commuted sentences for 16 people convicted of nonviolent drug offenses. 
 
Harris thanked Kardashian for her advocacy work. Kardashian visited the White House several times during the Trump administration to push for criminal justice reform. 
 
Now, embattled Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry announced his resignation on Thursday, saying that given the current state of affairs, the time was right for him to step down.
 
Since February, an alliance of gangs has created chaos in Haiti's capital. A transitional council is working to form a new government. It will exercise some presidential powers until a new president elect is inaugurated, which must take place no later than February the 7th, 2026. Now, Haiti's finance minister, Michel Patrick Boisvert will serve as interim prime minister.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MICHEL PATRICK BOISVERT, HAITIAN INTERIM PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Haiti, our country, finds itself at a crossroads searching for suitable solutions to emerge from this multi-dimensional political crisis, which has lasted too long and whose consequences are harmful and the population on property and on both public and private infrastructure.

FOSTER: Now, desperately needed ammunition is now heading for Ukraine after the U.S. approved a new batch of military aid for Kyiv. A senior U.S. defense official says the ammunition has been pre-positioned in Europe, and it's rapidly being shipped to Ukraine. 
 
In addition to that, Kyiv's allies will also look into the possibility of sending more Patriot air defense systems. The official says the topic will be discussed at Friday's virtual meeting of the Ukraine contact group. A group includes more than 50 countries which are supplying military aid to Kyiv. 
 
CNN's Melissa Bell is live for us in Paris with more. So, it does feel as though there will be this gush of ammunition at least because they've already put it in place.
 <br>[04:40:05]
 
MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's right, that it's already begun. What the Pentagon are saying, Max, is that it is significant amounts of ammunition that are moving at a very fast pace, as you say, because part of their stockpiles were pre-positioned in the E.U. 
 
And of course, this follows the unblocking after all these many months of this significant tranche of American military aid, 61 billion, the latest package to be approved, but there's also the 1.5 billion that's just been released by the European Union as part of that 50 billion Euro package that had been announced and agreed upon by the E.U. just a few months ago. 
 
So, a significant boost to Ukraine on the front lines is to be organized and has begun already. And of course, this meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, which will mark a significant anniversary.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRIG. GEN. PAT RYDER, PENTAGON PRESS SECRETARY: The meeting will commemorate the two year anniversary of the first Contact Group following Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. 
 
Over the past two years, the Contact Group has shown its unity and resolve, as evidenced by the continuing support and donations made by our international partners and allies. 
 
Additionally, the Contact Group continues its work with Ukraine to help it move towards development of a robust, efficient and self- reliant defense industry.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BELL: So, the defense ministers will meet virtually later today, Max and at the heart of that will be the discussion of how operationally they can help boost Ukraine at this very critical time in its frontlines. 
 
As you mentioned, there'll be discussion about what further missile -- Patriot missile systems can be delivered. Kyiv has said that it needs at least an additional seven. 
 
But as part of that discussion, but also the latest tranches of aid, you're likely to see the focus not just on air defense that Ukraine says is so critical to its ongoing defense, and indeed, its hope of turning back the momentum of the war of the last few weeks. 
 
But also, long range missiles and of course, artillery. Just on long range missiles, first, Max, what we've heard from the United States over the last couple of days is that in fact, the delivery of the longer range attack and missiles that are launched from the HIMARS have already been making their way to Ukraine as part of a deal that was signed in March. 
 
And that (INAUDIBLE) what we hear from Kyiv, is that some of those have already been used in an attack on Russian forces in Crimea. And then of course, the ammunition. This critically is what the European Union and the United States needs to get to those Ukrainian front lines if Kyiv has any hope of changing their fortunes there, Max. 
 
FOSTER: OK, Melissa in Paris, thank you so much for that. 
 
Now, up next, we'll take you live to Johannesburg as South Africa prepares to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Freedom Day, just a month before a crucial election. 
 
Plus, more than a hundred escaped inmates on the run in Nigeria, how they got out of a medium security prison, after the break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[04:45:04]
 
FOSTER: Tomorrow marks 30 years since the historic election that board Nelson Mandela to power in post-apartheid South Africa. 
 
However, with inequality in all-time high and crime corruption running rampant, the once hopeful promise of democracy seems to be losing its appeal ahead of next month's critical elections, which pose a serious threat to Mandela's party, the African National Congress, holding on to power.
 
Live now to CNN's David McKenzie in Johannesburg and David, critical elections, how much of a threat is there to what was Mandela's party?
 
DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, I think there's a real sense that the ANC might lose its majority in this election. That at least is the sense from political scientists and commentators here in South Africa. We'll have to wait and see. 
 
But it is a critical election. And this week marks a very significant milestone for South Africa. 30 years of democracy, there is much to celebrate for this country, but we look at what many are calling a silent crisis.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SETH MAZIBUKO, SOUTH AFRICAN LIBERATION HERO: Corner of death.
 
MCKENZIE (voice over): Liberation icon Seth Mazibuko live the painful history of this country. 
 
MAZIBUKO: Students were coming from that direction and police were coming from that direction. 
 
That morning of June 16, 1976. This was when the students who were marching peacefully, they were raising their hands and fingers of peace. They were given bullets.
 
MCKENZIE (voice over): Protesting the apartheid state and its racist education system. 
 
MAZIBUKO: I still feel guilty today that I lead students and children out of the classroom to be killed. 
 
MCKENZIE (voice over): Their sacrifice and the sacrifices of later generations helped toppled the violent apartheid state, birthing a peaceful democratic South Africa, the Rainbow Nation where everyone can vote.
 
But for Mazibuko, 30 years on, the Rainbow has faded. 
 
MCKENZIE: Has the leadership of this country respected the sacrifices that you made?
 
MAZIBUKO: Sold out.
 
MCKENZIE: Sold out?
 
MAZIBUKO: Many of the leaders that were supposed to be leading, they left this community, they left the very people that they're fighting for. 
 
MCKENZIE: When thousands of students were bravely marching down this streets, they were fighting for a better future for South Africa. But decades later, here's a staggering statistic, more than 80 percent of grade fours cannot read. 
 
Has it gotten worse over the 18 years of you being at the school?
 
PRINCE MULWELA, TEACHER, MORRIS ISAACSON HIGH SCHOOL: Yes, it's becoming worse and worse. 
 
MCKENZIE (voice over): At Morris Isaacson High School, famous for its role in '76. Teachers like Prince Mulwela say that jobs in education are given to the politically connected and corruption is rife. Primary students now come to his classes unprepared, he says. Corruption watchdogs call it a silent crisis.
 
MULWELA: We're living in a world in South Africa, where it's all about politics. Everything's been politicized. So, the education system is also being politicized. 
 
So, that is the reason why probably why I'm expressing such problems.
 
ATIEGANG ALCOCK, STUDENT, MORRIS ISAACSON HIGH SCHOOL: I feel honored being in the school because then I get to learn about history.
 
MBALI MSIMANGA, STUDENT, MORRIS ISAACSON HIGH SCHOOL: Some put their lives in danger for a better future, for better education.
 
MCKENZIE (voice over): I spoke to two leading students at Morris Isaacson, they are proud of their school, but acutely aware of the challenges that lie ahead. 
 
MCKENZIE: Is there enough opportunity for young people like yourself in this country?
 
ALCOCK: Right now? No.
 
MSIMANGA: That's going to be a struggle. Yes, and it is scary for us to be sitting at home and doing nothing. 
 
ALCOCK: Especially when you know that you went to university for so long and to have a degree or qualification but you're still struggling to get a job because of the unemployment rates.
 
MCKENZIE (voice over): Those rates are some of the world's highest. An uncertain future, despite the bitter struggles of the past. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
MCKENZIE (on camera): Now, South African officials told us that they are happy with the progress in their education system, especially because so many children now proportionately are actually in school, but the quality of that education is being questioned. 
 
The parties in South Africa are fiercely out there contesting this election. It is going to be a fascinating poll late next month. Many people believe that this is the most serious challenge to the ANC since the start of democracy. They say that this will be a key test for the ANC. And we will see should they -- if they are able to form that government or if they have to go into a coalition. 
 <br>[04:50:02]
 
FOSTER: OK, David McKenzie in Johannesburg, fascinating. Thank you. In Nigeria, officials are urging the public to be on the lookout for
 
 inmates who fled a weather damaged prison. Authorities say more than a hundred prisoners escaped from the facility on Wednesday night after heavy rainfall destroyed parts of the building.
 
The fence surrounding the facility was also destroyed. Officials say 10 of the inmates have been captured and taken into custody.
 
CNN's Stephanie Busari live this hour in Lagos. The most remarkable type of prison break, although I guess they just walked out.
 
STEPHANIE BUSARI, CNN SENIOR EDITOR, AFRICA: Max, this is an extraordinary story, but unfortunately, not very uncommon here in Nigeria, where we've reported several times on prison breaks.
 
But this this one in particular is quite so remarkable as you say, we're hearing that 118 inmates fled on Wednesday night after heavy downpour and storms near the nation's capital, Abuja. 
 
This happened in Niger states, in north central Nigeria in a town called Suleja and we hear that this is a medium correctional facility. 
 
So, but we don't know much about the makeup of the inmates that have been held in this facility, but we do know it's a medium correctional facility. 
 
And the Nigerian authorities say that 108 of them are underground. They've recaptured 10. And they've asked the public to be on the lookout and they assured the public that they are on top of this situation. 
 
But residents have been describing how they heard gun battles between the authorities as they chase inmates. 
 
Now, this prison is in a residential area and residents have been speaking out, saying, that they're frightened for their lives. They don't know where these inmates have gone, they could well be in their communities. And they've asked the government to move these facilities from the area. 
 
And the correctional facilities saying that this is an old colonial era style building, and many of them -- there are many of them around the country. Prisons are often dilapidated and overcrowded. 
 
Nigerian's interior minister Tunji-Ojo has been speaking out, saying that he's looking to overhaul the prison facilities in the country. This one in particular is meant to have 250 inmates but was holding 499 people. 
 
So, you could just imagine the scenes of chaos inside there. And when the perimeter fences collapsed during the downpour and you could just imagine the scenes of chaos.
 
And residents really putting pressure on the government to say, we don't feel safe, that we need action now to move this correctional facilities away from residential areas, Max. FOSTER: Yes, absolutely. Stephanie in Lagos, thank you. 
 
Well, the first round of the NFL draft is in the books and quarterbacks were in high demand. Who came out on top? Just ahead on CNN NEWSROOM.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: Quarterback Caleb Williams is celebrating today as the newest member of the Chicago Bears. The USC standout was selected number one in Thursday's NFL Draft. Williams won the Heisman Trophy in 2022. Five quarterbacks were selected in the top 10 including Jayden Daniels by the Washington Commanders and Drake Maye by the New England Patriots and J.J. McCarthy by the Minnesota Vikings. 
 <br>[04:55:22]
 
Wide Receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. was the first non-quarterback selected on Thursday night. He was the fourth overall pick by the Arizona Cardinals. 
 
Now, German Football Club closes offices and fan shop after a bomb from World War II was discovered near their home stadium. Officials in the city of Mainz say the 500 kilo American aerial bomb was discovered on Wednesday during renovations of the stadium. Officials evacuated the area while the bomb is set to be diffused today, allowing for Sunday's Bundesliga match against FC Cologne to go ahead as planned. 
 
And it's always the spotlight this hour. 113,000 people registered to enter Venice, Italy on the first day of the city's new tourist fee, aimed at curbing visitors. About 14 percent of them were day trippers required to pay the five euro charge. The pilot scheme runs for 29 days until July the 14th. It's a well first but not everyone is pleased about it.
 
Some locals protested the fee, saying it risks turning the city into a theme park. 
 
Scientists are announcing a dynamite discovery in the nature reserve in Argentina. Paleontologists found a new medium sized dinosaur that lived 90 million years ago in present day Patagonia. The animal was a fast running herbivore with a downward curve trail. Its fossils were uncovered in 2018 in an area where other dinosaur species have been found.
 
Paleontologist announcing their discovery recently in an article in a scientific journal. 
 
And before we go, it looks like one U.S. company is giving a whole new meaning to the term hot dog. Throwflame based in Ohio is offering what it claims to be the world's first and hopefully the only flame- throwing robotic dog. 
 
The Thermonator can throw flames up to nine meters and costs around $9,000 if you want one. The company says its fiery Fido (ph) which runs on gasoline or napalm can be used for wildfire managements, snow removal, and even entertainment. 
 
Thanks for joining me here on CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Max Foster in London. This is CNN this morning.
