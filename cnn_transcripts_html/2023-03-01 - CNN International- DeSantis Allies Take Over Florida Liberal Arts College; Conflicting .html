MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome back to CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Max Foster. If you are just joining us, let me bring you up to date with our top stories this hour. 
 
Another round of winter weather hitting -- or expected to hit California. Parts of the state have been buried in up to 7 feet of snow over the past few days as a freezing cold system moves inland over the U.S. 
 
And authorities are searching for survivors of a double train collision that killed at least 38 people near Larissa, Greece. 
 
Conservative allies of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis are quickly shaking things up at a small liberal arts college, the school's board of trustees which includes several members hand picked by DeSantis voted Tuesday to abolish all diversity, equity and inclusion programs at the new college of Florida. The governor's critics say it is nothing more than a political power move as he prepares for a widely expected presidential run. The school's interim president explained the reasons for the changes but students are voicing their concerns. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
RICHARD CORCORAN, INTERIM PRESIDENT, NEW COLLEGE OF FLORIDA: New College has experienced every kind of threat to its very existence, to its very autonomy. And what governor DeSantis -- he looked back at the history, he digs into the subject matter and says, you know, why are we trying to move it, close it, all these different things that have been proposed over those 12 years. What it needs is new leadership to come in there, additional funding. 
 
BENJAMIN CASEY, NEW COLLEGE OF FLORIDA STUDENT: We do not welcome you here because you do not reflect the values of the New College community and you do not respect the people here who have poured their blood, sweat and tears into this institution. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
FOSTER: Meanwhile Governor DeSantis is on a nationwide book tour. He offered his defense of his culture war agenda.

RON DESANTIS (R) FLORIDA GOVERNOR: They want you to believe that babies are born racist. They want you to believe things that you know based on common sense is not true but they want that ideology to govern society. And I think the reason why it's been a threat is because, yes, they're trying to jam it in the schools. We recognize here in the state of Florida that part of what makes us the free state of Florida is, yes, we're protecting your freedom from government overreach, but we're also protecting your freedom from having the left's pathologies slammed down your throat through all these different institutions.

FOSTER: In the coming hours, the jury in the Alex Murdaugh double murder trial expected to visit the scene of the crime -- the family's sprawling estate in South Carolina. Murdaugh is accused of killing his wife and son in an attempt to cover up financial crimes. And on Tuesday the prosecution wrapped up its rebuttal. CNN's Randi Kaye explains what happened in court.
 <br>[04:35:00]
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ALAN WILSON, SOUTH CAROLINA ATTORNEY GENERAL: Is it your expert opinion that a 6'4" shooter cannot be excluded from the murder of Maggie and Paul?
 
DR. KENNETH KINSEY, CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION AND RECREATION EXPERT: I see nothing that could exclude a 6'4" shooter.
 
RANDI KAYE, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Dr. Kenneth Kinsey, an expert in crime scene Investigation and recreation called back to the standby the state to dispute key testimony. A forensic scientist testified for the defense and told the jury whoever killed Maggie and Paul Murdaugh was likely much shorter than Alex Murdaugh, who was about six, four, but the prosecution's expert disagreed.
 
WILSON: Can a person be an -- on their knee and get the same angle and be standing and get the same angle?
 
KINSEY: Yes, sir.
 
WILSON: Can a 6'4" person and a 5'4" person still shoot the same angle just at different distances?
 
KINSEY: Absolutely.
 
WILSON: Can you exclude a 6'4" defendant like Alex Murdaugh, or anyone for that matter at that height from shooting that shotgun at that angle?
 
KINSEY: Absolutely not.
 
KAYE (voice-over): In one of the most dramatic moments of the trial, South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson pointed a shotgun at Kinsey to illustrate another defense theory the state also believes is flawed.
 
WILSON: You'll give me permission to point this to you, correct?
 
KINSEY: I have.
 
KAYE (voice-over): A defense witness said Paul Murdaugh's fatal shot was a downward facing contact wound, meaning the barrel of the shotgun was up against his head. But this court demonstration was designed to show why prosecutors say that just doesn't make sense.
 
WILSON: OK, Paul has just been shot.
 
KINSEY: Yes, sir.
 
WILSON: And in the defense's theory, you tell me what to do, and you act this out. And I'm going to do what you told me to do based on the defense's theory of the case.
 
KINSEY: The defense agreed with the assessment that Paul stood there for a moment bleeding down his injured left arm, and he slowly walked toward the door.
 
WILSON: OK, and what is the shooter do?
 
KINSEY: The shooter's coming in the door.
 
WILSON: And then what does the shooter do?
 
KINSEY: He shoots Paul in the back of the head after he passes him.
 
WILSON: OK. And then shoots Paul in the back of the head like this.
 
KINSEY: I think the theory is preposterous, in my opinion.
 
WILSON: The shooter is shooting down. How do pellets get embedded into the doorframe up here? How's that possible?
 
KINSEY: I think it's impossible myself. It -- physics don't work that way. They will turn around because of the pressure. Go back the opposite direction. 180-degree direction at enough velocity to dent a steel exterior door and embed in the doorframe. That doesn't happen.
 
KAYE (voice-over): The defense did its best to push back.
 
JIM GRIFFIN, DEFENSE ATTORNEY: So, you believe that this pellet that's in the door jamb came through his shoulder through his neck, out the top of his head and ended up at that location?
 
KINSEY: Well, they didn't turn around and come back out of the top of his head. Yes, sir. I do --
 
KAYE (voice-over): Randi Kaye, CNN, Walterboro, South Carolina. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE) FOSTER: And San Francisco leaders have approved controversial legislation meant to tackle fatal drug overdoses. The city's board of supervisors unanimously voted to allow nonprofit groups to operate supervised drug injection sites as long as it's with private funding. Federal and California state laws currently bar government funds going towards the programs along with medical supervision, the sites also provide counseling and referrals to other social and health services. Opponents, however, say the sites would promote and normalize drug use and attract crime. 
 
Just ahead, after a controversial election, Africa's largest democracy has a new president. We're live in Lagos. 
 
STEPHANIE BUSARI, CNN SENIOR EDITOR, AFRICA: Nigeria is waking up to a new president. We'll have the latest update for you live here in Lagos.
 <br>[04:40:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
FOSTER: Nigeria has declared the winner of its controversial presidential election. Bola Ahmed Tinubu will now lead Africa's largest economy despite a growing outcry from opposition leaders and independent observers who say the vote was rigged. And we are going to go to Lagos -- and Nigeria of course. Stephanie Busari is there. So, they woken up with a new president but will they accept him? 
 
BUSARI: That remains to be seen, Max. This morning everything is going on as normal. I suspect that many Nigerians will just shrug it off and go about their daily business anyway. There will be disappointment among young voters who were complaining vigorously for Peter Obi. But Nigerians -- and you know, if you look at the turnout, Max, actually, 24 million people voted and that many have said is not a ringing endorsement for this election or indeed Nigerian democracy. Many Nigerians clearly just do not feel that their vote counts or that the outcomes of elections will change their lives. 
 
Now, Bola Ahmed Tinubu is part of the old guard, part of the team that elected -- helped elect President Buhari who was outgoing in 2014 -- 2015 rather. And many people wanted a different type of leader. But he has said he's ready to work from day one. He's appealing to the opposition candidates who are rejecting these results. He's asking them to come together to, quote, fix the broken pieces of this country. And there are many broken pieces, Max. 
 
The country is very divided along the religious lines, along ethic lines and now generational lines with the young people who were backing the third party -- the Labour Party candidate, Peter Obi. 
 
So, it's an uphill battle. Many have said, does Bola Ahmed Tinubu have the health and agility to lead this nation. He says he has it. It remains to be seen. 
 
FOSTER: OK. Stephanie, thank you very much indeed for reporting -- all your reporting on this from Lagos. Iran's foreign minister recently sat down with our Christiane Amanpour
 
 for an exclusive interview covering a range of topics including the alleged sexual abuse of anti-government protestors in the custody of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: When you say the Islamic Republic of Iran respect human rights, one female protester says that she was detained inside a Revolutionary Guard facility for more than a month and raped by three different men. 
 <br>[04:45:00]
 
She went to a cleric, a mullah, afterwards, because she was having suicide thoughts, she was so upset. CNN spoke with that cleric. Is that acceptable? Is it acceptable for a woman, whatever she's done, to be arrested and raped? And there are many, many, many reports of sexual abuse in this situation against women and men.
 
HOSSEIN AMIR-ABDOLLAHIAN, IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER (through translation): Firstly, in the peaceful demonstrations in the fall, no one was arrested.
 
AMANPOUR: So, you're just denying that?
 
AMIR-ABDOLLAHIAN (through translation): However, in those protests that have become violent, some individuals, some of whom had entered Iran from the outside and we're using firearms and killing the police, were arrested. You do know that the Supreme Leader actually issued an amnesty. And all of those who are imprisoned were released, with the exception of those who had killed someone or were being sued. Regarding the Iranian woman that you mentioned, I cannot confirm it. There have been so many such baseless claims made on social media and in media.
 
AMANPOUR: OK, these are not baseless and they weren't on the internet. CNN spoke to a cleric, a religious person, inside your country and got this story.
 
AMIR-ABDOLLAHIAN (through translation): We have seen some of CNN's reports that are targeted and false.
 
AMANPOUR: That's not true. We report the facts and we report the truth. And that's why you are sitting here with me, Mr. Foreign Minister.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
FOSTER: Tune into Christiane's exclusive interview with the Iranian Foreign Minister covering topics including the crackdown on protestors, supplying Russia with drones and Iran's uranium enrichment, that's Wednesday, 7:00 p.m. in Geneva, 6:00 p.m. in London, only on CNN. 
 
The highest court in the U.S. is hearing arguments on student loan debt relief. Just ahead, the issues the justices are considering. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: A look ahead at Wall Street as we enter a new month, this follows a volatile February of course. Strong economic data and persistent inflation are fueling fears that the Federal Reserve will keep hiking interest rates and keep them higher for longer as well. The Dow fell more than 4 percent for the month and is down 8.5 percent for the year. The S&amp;P 500 dropped 2.6 percent and the Nasdaq has shed just over 1 percent. 
 
Meanwhile, a new survey shows American consumers felt worse about the U.S. economy in February with fears of a recession still looming. The latest data from the conference board shows consumer confidence fell by several points last month when economists were expecting it to rise. 
 
One of the last aid programs from the COVID pandemic in the U.S. is ending today. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP benefits provided millions of Americans with extra help to buy food during the pandemic. Many states had already let this benefit expire and now the remaining 32 states will end the program as well. Additional food stamps will be discontinued even as inflation in the U.S. continues to soar. 
 
The Biden administration says that is confident the U.S. Supreme Court will rule in favor of its student loan debt relief program. But the court's conservative majority is potentially poised to deal a blow to the president's plan. Here's CNN justice correspondent Jessica Schneider. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Cancel student debt now!
 
JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Big stakes for more than 40 million student loan borrowers, as the Supreme Court decides whether a program eliminating up to $20,000 in debt per borrower can go into effect.
 
ELIZABETH PRELOGAR, SOLICITOR GENERAL: To provide a measure of loan forgiveness to make sure that this unprecedented pandemic does not leave borrowers worse off in relation to their student loans.
 
SCHNEIDER (voice-over): The Biden administration is defending their student loan forgiveness program, arguing that it is necessary in the wake of the COVID pandemic. But the conservative justices repeatedly zeroed in on the program's $400 billion plus price tag to question whether the president by way of his education secretary has the power to enact this kind of relief.
 
JOHN ROBERTS, CHIEF JUSTICE: I think most casual observers would say if you're going to give up that much amount of money, if you're going to effect the obligations of that many Americans on a subject that's of great controversy, they would think that's something for Congress to act on. SCHNEIDER (voice-over): The solicitor general responded that federal law allows for the education secretary to waive or modify loan obligations in the wake of an emergency, and the ongoing financial effects of the pandemic justifies the administration's stepping in.
 
PRELOGAR: Without this critical relief for debtors, we are going to have a wave of default across the country with all of the negative consequences that has for borrowers. I think it is precisely the type of context where the executive should be able to implement those emergency powers.
 
SCHNEIDER (voice-over): The Supreme Court has repeatedly struck down programs implemented by the Biden administration under COVID, including the eviction moratorium and the testing or vaccine mandate for large employers. This student debt program uses the pandemic to justify forgiving $10,000 in federal loans for people making under $125,000, or $20,000 in loans for those with Pell grants. About 20 million borrowers could see their remains balances entirely wiped out.
 
But Justice Neil Gorsuch asked whether that undermines basic fairness. 
 
JUSTICE NEIL GORSUCH, ASSOCIATE JUSTICE: What I think they argue that
 
is missing is cost to other persons in terms of fairness, for example, people who have paid their loans, people who plan their lives around not seeking loans, and people who are not eligible for loans in the first place. And that half a trillion dollars is being diverted to one group of favored persons over others.
 
SCHNEIDER: So a lot on the line for millions of borrowers. If the Supreme Court upholds this program, debt cancellation could come pretty quickly because the Biden administration has already approved 16 million applications. But based on the questioning of this conservative court, it does appear the court is set to strike down this program and of course that would end debt relief at least for now for millions of Americans. 
 
At the Supreme Court, Jessica Schneider, CNN, Washington.

FOSTER: A new study finds just 11 minutes of moderate to vigorous aerobic activity per day could have lasting health benefits including lower risk of cancer, heart disease or premature death. Scientists here in the U.K. looked at data from nearly 200 studies that followed more than 30 million adults for an average of ten years. The study is published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. 
 
Comedian Chris Rock is expected to address getting slapped by actor Will Smith at last year's Oscars just one week before this year's Academy Awards. Netflix says Rock will talk about the incident during a live standup special on the streaming service this Saturday night. The comedian had alluded to the kerfuffle in short bits over the past year, but this is expected to be the first time he'll address the incident at greater length. 
 
Anow an amazing and kind of odd discovery in Peru and it was found inside a food delivery bag. A prehistoric mummy which could be up to 800 years old was found by police over the weekend in a delivery bag with three men who were drinking in a deserted park. It turns out they probably weren't supposed to have the mummy. At least one of the men had been detained and he is under investigation. He nicknamed the remains Juanita and keeps his at home saying that they sleep with him and even describing them as a, quote, spiritual girlfriend. However, the remains are actually believed to be that of an adult male. The culture ministry has taken custody of the mummy. 
 
Finally, this hour, the flight of a lifetime for passengers on EasyJet. On Monday the pilots flew in a circle to give them a view of the Northern Lights, this was on route from Iceland to Manchester in England. One passenger says the flight crew turned off the lights so that everyone on board could enjoy the view. EasyJet said that they were pleased that the crew went, quote, above and beyond for the passengers. Lucky them.
