COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What`s up superstar. It`s Friday, Friyay. Great job of taking this week by storm grinding and shining, maybe even having to 
 
 power through some tough moments, but rise up. 
 
Here we go. Welcome to the best 10 minutes in news. Um, Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. And come on with me as we zip through an overview of some of the 
 
 latest news headlines. 
 
Another round of snow and cold weather is expected to hit parts of the U.S. This, after a series of winter storms has already killed at least 40 people 
 
 across nine states since last week, potentially dangerous wind chills are also expected in the central U.S. once again. So please stay warm, stay 
 
 covered, and try to avoid any risk of frostbite and/or hypothermia. Hypothermia occurs when your body loses heat faster than it can produce 
 
 heat, normal body temperatures around 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, but hypothermia sets in when your body temp falls below 95.
 
And the South Asian nation of Pakistan, the fifth most populated nation in the world carried out a series of military strikes on what it said were 
 
 separatist militant hideouts inside Iran. The attack came a day after Iran said it used precision missile and drone strikes to destroy two bases of 
 
 another militant group in Pakistani territory. According to Reuters, both countries reported that civilians including children were killed during the 
 
 attacks.
 
Reuters obtained this eyewitness video from Iran, with villagers standing among damaged buildings and says the location matches scenes of the 
 
 aftermath shown on Iranian TV. 
 
Earlier this week, people gathered across Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan to protest Iran`s cross border strike. Hostilities between 
 
 Pakistan and Iran aren`t new, but Reuters cause the exchange of attacks this week, the highest profile cross border intrusion in recent years, this 
 
 along with all of the other tension in the Middle East is raising great concern of a growing wider conflict. CNN`s Paula Hancocks is here to give 
 
 us a quick recap of all that`s happened and explain Iran`s web light connection to the conflict in the Middle East.

PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  To understand the very real fears of a wider conflict in the Middle East, it`s useful to take a closer look at the 
 
 axes of resistance, the proxies and allies of Iran stretching from the red sea to the Mediterranean. 
 
This latest regional tension was sparked by the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7th and Israel subsequent war in Gaza. The U.S. says Hamas is 
 
 funded, equipped, and sometimes trained by Iran. Although Tehran claims it was not involved in the October 7th attack, then Iran`s other proxies got 
 
 involved.
 
October 8th, Hezbollah in Lebanon, one of the most powerful forces in the region boasting some 100,000 fighters and links with the Lebanese 
 
 government fired missiles across the border into Northern Israel, which Israel`s military responded to this raised fears of a wider conflict. 
 
Next, on the 19th of October, the Houthis rebels in Yemen launched missiles against Israel before moving their focus to commercial vessels in the Red 
 
 Sea causing global chaos in the shipping industry. U.S. and U.K. strikes against targets in Yemen have not stopped these continued attacks.
 
In Iraq, there are a number of Iran-backed militia groups that are increasingly active since the war in Gaza targeting U.S. troops in the 
 
 country on a near daily basis, operating under umbrella group, the Islamic resistance in Iraq. They`re united in ideology, but splinted in operations, 
 
 making them more challenging to target. 
 
There is little to suggest that Iran wants direct conflict with Israel or the United States at this point, but the sheer number and reach of its 
 
 proxies, engaging the U.S. and its allies, inevitably sparks fears of an unintentional wider conflict.

WIRE:  Ten second trivia. 
 
What is the longest river in the world, according to the Guinness World Records?
 
The Missouri, The Nile, The Amazon, The Yangtze.
 
Some scientists debate this, but Guinness, Britannica, and U.S. government say The Nile is the longest river in the world, some 4,160 miles long. 
 
If you could simply use the palm of your hand to pay for things, whether it`s groceries or hopping on a subway or bus, or even entering buildings 
 
 like an office or gym, would you do it? Well, a Chinese tech giant Tencent has launched a new biometric payment system designed to allow you to leave 
 
 your keys, cash and credit cards at home. Our Marc Stewart has more from Beijing.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MARC STEWART, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  In a busy Beijing Metro station, time is of the assets and here on the dashing airport express 
 
 line, passengers can ditch their smartphones instead paying for their ride like this. With the palm of their hand, this new biometric payment system 
 
 is part of a trial by Chinese tech giant Tencent for its ways and pay users. The digital wallet and payment service is a sister app of WeChat and 
 
 users must opt in to use the contactless service. 
 
Infrared cameras analyze both a user`s palm print and a unique pattern of veins under their skin. Within seconds, the user is identified and a 
 
 payment is made.
 
GUO RIZEN, VICE GENERAL MANAGER, WEIXIN PAY INDUSTRY APPLICATION (through translator):  We`re hoping that palm payments can save people to trouble of 
 
 carrying physical items like cards and keys so that our lives become more convenient.
 
STEWART:  Here at Tencent headquarters in the Southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, the technology is used across the building from the cafeteria to 
 
 the gym.
 
Guo Rizen oversees the lab that began developing this technology in 2019. He says the double verification of palm prince and veins helps prevent 
 
 identity theft.
 
RIZEN:  With face scanning technology, people can look a lot like each other like twins, but with palm payments, even brothers and sisters who 
 
 look alike have unique palm prints and veins.
 
STEWART:  Tencent began rolling out this tech in early 2023. It`s now being tested in convenience stores at Shenzhen University and in local gyms. The 
 
 co-founder of this gym chain says nearly 2000 members have registered to use the system.
 
XIA JINGLONG, CO-FOUNDER OF SUPERMONKEY (through translator):  Before this, our users needed to enter a password to open the door and use their 
 
 smartphone to check in and make purchases. Now, they can just use their palm.
 
STEWART:  Biometric payment systems are nothing new from fingerprint to facial recognition. These services have been around for years, including 
 
 palm scanning technology. In 2020, Amazon began rolling out this palm payment service at whole food supermarkets in the U.S., but concerns have 
 
 been raised about biometric payment systems around data security and privacy, both in China and abroad.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  When you amass huge amounts of people`s most sensitive information, their biometric data, you`re creating a kind of honey pot, 
 
 which cyber criminals, uh, kind of lick their lips about and really want to access.
 
STEWART:  Tencent says security and privacy is their number one priority. Users` biometric data is stored on a cloud and is encrypted for security. 
 
 Tencent is working to improve this service and hopes to expand its reach. But the future of this tech lays firmly in the hands of the public.
