THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
<br>[09:00:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BECKY ANDERSON, CNN HOST, CONNECT THE WORLD: Well, this was the scene just over an hour ago. The Polaris Crew oversaw the first ever commercial 
 
 spacewalk with civilians as astronauts. It's 05:00 p.m. here in Abu Dhabi. I'm Becky Anderson, you're watching "Connect the World".
 
Also, over the next two hours, for you pressure bills on Joe Biden to ease Ukraine strike restrictions. Six UN workers are among 18 killed in an 
 
 Israeli strike on a school. And Peru's controversial Former President Alberto Fujimori, dies at 86.
 
The stock market in New York will open at 09:30 that is about 30 minutes from now on the East Coast of course. The futures market at present 
 
 indicating a mixed open at the bottom of the hour, and we will get you back there for that open when it happens.
 
The world watched history unfold today, 700 kilometers above the earth, in the last hour, the crew of the SpaceX Dragon Capsule completed the first 
 
 ever commercial spacewalk. Two of the four took turns exiting the craft and venturing into space for about 20 minutes total, including Billionaire 
 
 Entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, he helped finance the groundbreaking mission. 
 
Well, they performed a series of mobility checks to test SpaceX's newly developed space suit. The other two crew members stayed inside there. They 
 
 were exposed to the vacuum of space the entire time since the capsule does not have an airlock. The most remarkable pictures coming to us from up 
 
 there in the past hour or so. 
 
CNN's Space and Defense Correspondent Kristin Fisher is live in Washington with the very latest. And it's a day like this -- you know that you must 
 
 absolutely love your job. Remarkable images coming to us from that mission. Spacewalks, of course, are among the most dangerous activities astronauts 
 
 perform. Why was this one in particular so risky?
 
KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE &amp; DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT: Well Becky, because up until this moment, spacewalks have been something that only the wealthiest, 
 
 most powerful countries and governments have been able to do. Only the most you know prestigious government and professional astronauts have been 
 
 allowed to embark on such a risky endeavor.
 
And so, what made today and this spacewalk so unique is this was one giant leap forward to the democratization of space, right? Opening up space to 
 
 not just the professional astronauts, not just the United States, China and -- you know the Soviet Union back in the day.
 
This is now something that private companies can do. And what that means is that this type of thing can become much more frequent. They can develop 
 
 this type of technology much faster. And of course, the other thing that the private sector can do, that historically, the government can't do quite 
 
 as well is make things much cheaper and much more affordable. 
 
So right there, I can't tell exactly which astronaut that is, but it's either the commander, Jared Isaacman, or Mission Specialist Sarah Gillis, 
 
 also a SpaceX employee, conducting one of the spacewalks this morning, Becky. And what they were doing out there was testing the mobility of the 
 
 spacesuit. 
 
It's difficult to move in a spacesuit, so they were collecting all of that data and then going to bring it back to the SpaceX engineers back on Earth, 
 
 so that someday a suit like this can be worn on Mars.
 
ANDERSON: And SpaceX has spent, as I understand it, more than two years developing what certainly looks like a more sleek, formal fitting suit than 
 
 we've seen in the past. What kind of tests did the astronauts run on those suits today? Because this is -- this is a significant part of this mission, 
 
 correct?
 
FISHER: It is. Yeah, and you're right. It's a lot more streamlined a little less clunky than those NASA EMUs that we've gotten used to for 40 years 
 
 now. 
 <br>[09:05:00]
 
Becky so, what they're doing is what's called the mobility tests. And so, they're literally just trying to move their bodies, and in particular, 
 
 their joints, like finger joints, wrist joints, various things that you would need to do to build things. I mean, a lot of times when spacewalks 
 
 are conducted by NASA astronauts, they're doing maintenance like you would on your house, but only they're doing it in space, up at the International 
 
 Space Station.
 
And it requires doing things like -- you know holding a tool in your hand, or making very small motions, and that's tough to do when you have these 
 
 really big, puffy gloves, and you're in a pressure suit. You know, when you think about being in space, you think, oh, you know, your weightless. 
 
 You're in microgravity. It must be so easy to move.
 
But this is a pressurized suit, and so just lifting your arm up takes a lot of strength. And so, these two astronauts that venture outside of the hatch 
 
 and into the vacuum of space right there, are describing to the engineers on the ground, well -- you know this feels good. This does not feel good. 
 
 You know, maybe here's where I'm getting a hot spot. 
 
This is a place where I feel like I can't really move my body. This is a place where the suit feels really good. So, we don't know exactly what 
 
 parts of the space suit worked and didn't, except that it did keep them safe from the vacuum of space, of course Becky.
 
ANDERSON: I mean, Kristin, as you talk, we are looking at images of a civilian, somebody who hasn't been -- you know an astronaut by trade on 
 
 this -- on this spacewalk, and you've got the Earth there in that shot. These are extraordinary images, and ones, one just never really gets over. 
 
 Tell us more about what, not just a spacesuit, but this mission could mean for the space industry and space exploration? What's the bigger picture 
 
 here? 
 
FISHER: So, Polaris is not just a mission, it's a program. This is the first mission, the Polaris Dawn Mission, part of the Polaris Dawn Program. 
 
 And the ultimate goal is for Jared Isaacman, the commander, to partially finance the development and advancement of SpaceX's further exploration 
 
 into space. 
 
So, this was just the first step. The third mission that he has essentially chartered is going to be the first crewed mission of SpaceX's starship. 
 
 Becky, that's the biggest, most powerful rocket that's ever flown. It's the one that Elon Musk hopes to land some day on Mars. It's also the one that 
 
 NASA has awarded a contract to land NASA astronauts on the surface of the Moon for the first time since the end of the Apollo Program. 
 
So, if all goes according to plan, the Polaris program Ps going to allow Jared Isaacman and whatever other commercial, private astronauts he selects 
 
 for these missions to really serve as the test pilots for SpaceX's advancements in the space.
 
ANDERSON: This is just remarkable. It's so good to have you. Thank you very much indeed. Your inside analysis just fascinating as we watch these 
 
 remarkable pictures. Well, the UN is calling it the highest death toll of its staff in Gaza in a single incident. Six UNWRA workers among 18 people 
 
 killed in an Israeli strike on a UN school in the Nuseirat Camp in Central Gaza on Wednesday.
 
Thousands of displaced Palestinians have been sheltering there. Israel's military says it carried out what it calls a precise strike on Hamas 
 
 terrorists operating inside the school compound. Well, this latest attack comes as the Health Ministry in Gaza reports more than 41,000 people now 
 
 killed since the war started last October. 
 
Well, Nic Robertson connecting us this hour from Tel Aviv. And the UN community, once again mourning the loss of staff as I understand it, this 
 
 is the greatest loss of UN staff in any one incident ever Nic. What more can you tell us about what happened and why?
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: It was the Al-Jaouni school in the Nuseirat Camp in Central Gaza, close to Gaza City, the fifth 
 
 time. I mean, the metrics about this strike are quite staggering. It's the fifth time that this particular UN run school that's now a shelter for 
 
 about 12,000 displaced people has been hit, the fifth time. 
 <br>[09:10:00]
 
Six UN workers were killed there. The director was killed. We understand as well that his brother, who was also a UN worker, was killed in an Israeli 
 
 strike several months ago. But the director and five teaching staff at that school were killed. 
 
One of the staff at the school describes around about lunchtime having a meal with colleagues in a room, and then leaving that room to go walk to 
 
 another part of the building to give something to colleagues there, hearing this massive explosion, running back to the room that they left, only to 
 
 discover the room was destroyed. 
 
The colleagues were essentially missing, destroyed in the blast that the strike itself clearly devastating. We know that 18 people were killed, 44 
 
 wounded. But the metrics, and we're talking about them here, the fifth time that school was hit. 
 
We understand from the Irish Foreign Minister, who's commented about this, saying that there were -- there have now been 220 UNWRA workers killed 
 
 since October 7th who were from the UN Special Rapporteur on this issue, says 70 percent of all the UN run schools in Gaza since October 7th have 
 
 been struck. 
 
These are schools where people go to displace people, because they can get distributions of aid, they can get water. They can -- they can at least 
 
 have some life with some sense of safety, although not really. It is clear where they can live with their families when their houses are destroyed, 
 
 when they've got nowhere else to live. 
 
So, these are places that have become places of sanctuary. The IDF is saying that it's a cynical manipulation of this by Hamas that is using 
 
 these locations to build their command-and-control centers. And the IDF says this was a specifically targeted strike at a Hamas command-and-control 
 
 center at this school. 
 
But for the UN and the UN Secretary General, I think, is being very clear on this. Lines are being crossed they're being crossed too often. And the 
 
 UN Secretary General said that these violations of international law must stop. That said there's no indication that the IDF is going to change its 
 
 tactics and that this will end these types of strikes.
 
ANDERSON: Nic Robertson is on the story in today in Tel Aviv, in Israel. Thank you, Nic. And you can follow all the news from Gaza and indeed, the 
 
 rest of the region in our "Meanwhile in the Middle East" Newsletter, there is a gripping story up now on. What are the unimaginable hardships facing 
 
 the injured in Gaza who are unable to get treatment for severe wounds? Scan the QR code on the bottom of your screen to access that newsletter. 
 
Well, pressure is building on U.S. President Joe Biden to lift restrictions on Ukraine's use of Western supplied weapons. He is facing calls from 
 
 Republican and Democratic lawmakers to give Ukraine the green light to use long range weapons to hit targets deep inside Russia. 
 
They say the current limits put Ukraine at a disadvantage. U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken discussed the weapons restrictions with Ukraine's 
 
 President and Britain's Foreign Secretary during their meeting in Kyiv on Wednesday, speaking in Poland today, Blinken said the purpose of his visit 
 
 was to listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: One of the purposes of my visit to Kyiv yesterday was to hear from our Ukrainian partners what they believe 
 
 they need now to deal with the current battlefield, including in Eastern Ukraine and other parts of the country.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: CNN's Fred Pleitgen is in Ukraine's Capital in Kyiv. It is not like the Biden Administration hasn't been asked this of them. This request 
 
 has been in for months and months and months. How much pressure is the Biden Administration under to lift these weapons restrictions, and what do 
 
 these restrictions look like at this point?
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: First of all, you're absolutely right Becky, the Biden Administration certainly has been 
 
 asked for months by various international partners, but of course, specifically by the Ukrainians, to lift some of these restrictions on the 
 
 longer distance weapons.
 
Essentially right now, what the U.S. is telling the Ukrainians that they are allowed to use some of these weapons that can strike at longer 
 
 distances, like, for instance, those surface-to-surface attack and missiles in areas very close to the Russian borders, but inside Russian territory.
 
But only also in those areas where the Russians are directly launching offensive operations against Ukraine from Russian territory, like, for 
 
 instance, the Kharkiv region and the other side of the border, adjacent to that. 
 <br>[09:15:00]
 
Further along, they are not allowed to strike deeper into Russian territory using American weapons. And the U.S. even goes further than that. They also 
 
 say that they are not encouraging Ukraine to even use its own weapons to strike deep inside Russian territory. 
 
Now, the pressure to change that has been mounting, indeed, over the past couple of weeks, but I would say specifically since this past week, it 
 
 certainly has increased considerably, where the U.S. itself has come out and said that they believe that the Iranians have now given ballistic 
 
 missiles to the Russians.
 
And that the Russians are literally only days away from using those ballistic missiles on the battlefield. Of course, the Iranians continue to 
 
 deny that they've given any such technology to the Russians. However, the U.S. says that it is certain that, that is the case, and that will allow 
 
 the Russians to use their own ballistic missiles in different ways than they have before.
 
And of course, now they have that additional component of those shorter range traveling about 75 miles ballistic missiles from Iran, which again, 
 
 puts a lot of pressure under the Ukraine -- on the Ukrainians that are already suffering on the battlefield.
 
In fact, the new Ukrainian Foreign Minister, he came out after that meeting with Secretary of State, Blinken, and he said, for the Ukrainians, it's 
 
 absolutely imperative to lift those restrictions. Here's what he said.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDRII SYBIHA, UKRAINIAN FOREIGN MINISTER: We must remove all obstacles and limitations on the use of British equipment and American weapons against 
 
 military targets in Russian territory.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
PLEITGEN: So, what the Ukrainians are saying is that they definitely need to use those weapons, on the one hand, to try and stop the Russians, at 
 
 least to a certain extent, from hitting Ukrainian cities with some of their ballistic missiles, being able to strike some of those sites from where 
 
 those missiles are launched from.
 
But then also, of course, for their frontline battlefield troops as well, with the Russians now using their air force a lot more effectively than 
 
 they have in the past. And right now, it's difficult, very difficult situation for the Ukrainians, especially on the Eastern Front near the City 
 
 of Pokrovsk.
 
We've learned today that that city now does not have water anymore, and another key bridge through that city has also been destroyed, literally a 
 
 couple of minutes ago, Becky, we have learned that apparently a convoy from the International Red Cross was also hit, killing three people there.
 
The Ukrainian President has already come out and condemned that. But with that always comes Ukraine saying, look, give us the weapons that we need 
 
 and also allow us to use them in a way that is the most effective, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Fred Pleitgen is on the ground. Fred, thank you. Well, still to come, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump plan to aggressively ramp up their 
 
 campaign appearances in the battleground states in the weeks to come. We're going to get you more on that after this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:20:00]
 
ANDERSON: With the debate now behind them, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are back on the campaign trail today. Harris's team says that her campaign 
 
 is now entering what it calls a more aggressive phase. She is kicking off her new way forward tour, as it's being labeled, through battleground 
 
 states, beginning with two rallies in North Carolina today.
 
Her team is hoping to build off the momentum from that presidential debate and mobilize voters. Meantime, sources close to the Trump campaign says 
 
 that the former president plans to ramp up his schedule in the weeks leading up to the November election. He will be in Tucson, Arizona later 
 
 today for a rally, and he is expected to hold several events each week.
 
Well, CNN's Alayna Treene following the Trump campaign for us, Isaac Dovere is following Kamala Harris. And just tell us more about what this 
 
 aggressive phase Alayna, is for the Harris campaign at this point. Am I getting it right? Who's on which Alayna you're on Harris today, correct?
 
ALAYNA TREENE, CNN REPORTER: No, I cover Trump, but I can talk about Trump's more aggressive approach if you want me to delve into that right 
 
 now.
 
ANDERSON: No, no, no, I'm sorry. We're getting it all. Isaac, give me that -- give me where we are at with Harris, and then I'll get to you later, 
 
 because I know that you're all over that Trump campaign like a rash.
 
EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER: Well, we're about halfway through into Kamala Harris being a Democratic nominee here. She started about 100 
 
 days out, or 55 days from the election now. And what she is doing is trying to get herself more out on the ground ever it's had about three weeks of 
 
 not a lot of on the ground campaigning from Kamala Harris between the Democratic Convention, and then a week where she did a couple of stops, but 
 
 not that many right before Labor Day.
 
And then the time that she spent in debate prep in Pennsylvania, where she made a couple of appearances during breaks, but mostly was in a hotel 
 
 getting ready for that debate. Now she is getting out there. She's getting out there. Her husband, Doug Emhoff is getting out there.
 
Her running mate, Tim Walz, his wife, and other democratic officials going to fan out too over the course of the next couple days, trying to now make 
 
 their presence on the ground felt and show the way that they are trying to fight for every vote that they can find in all these battleground states 
 
 which they continue to feel are very close as happy as they are with how the debate went on Tuesday night.
 
ANDERSON: Yeah, this is absolutely fascinating again. You know, let's not beat around the bush here. I mean, this is as close as it gets. The Trump 
 
 campaign in full gear, of course, Trump heading back onto the campaign trail. Alayna, who's been talking to her sources. His allies are certainly 
 
 in damage control in the wake of the debate. What is going on at this point? What's the atmosphere in that campaign?
 
TREENE: Look, it's really interesting, because publicly, you see Donald Trump himself telling the media he said himself in the spin room the other 
 
 night, following that debate, that he thinks he won the debate, that it was the best debate he's have performance he's ever given. However, behind the 
 
 scenes, it's quite different.
 
I've been talking to a lot of people, both on Trump's campaign, but also people who are close to the former president, his outside allies. Many of 
 
 them agree that this did not go the way that they had hoped. They recognize that Kamala Harris successfully baited Donald Trump into going off of the 
 
 issues, veering off topic, going into detail about some conspiracy theories and rumors as well as personal attacks.
 
All things, Becky, that we had been reporting for weeks, that they wanted him to avoid. They wanted him to talk about the issues. You know, many 
 
 people, even RFK Jr., who ever since he dropped out of the race and endorsed Donald Trump, has become a top Trump campaign surrogate.
 
He said publicly yesterday on Fox News that he thinks that Harris won on style points. He thinks that Donald Trump had a better case, he argued to 
 
 make on substance, but that Donald Trump didn't do that on Tuesday. He said that he thought he got distracted. That very much lines up with what I'm 
 
 being told behind the scenes from all of my sources.
 
And people are frustrated. They think that he had a good policy case to make, particularly on the issues when it comes to the economy to 
 
 immigration, things that they believe Harris, you know, does not pull better on that she hasn't handled well, but Donald Trump really didn't make 
 
 that case.
 
And so, they are trying to kind of find a way to bat away that criticism. And I think you'll hear some of that rhetoric tonight when he's in Tucson, 
 
 Arizona, as well as tomorrow when he goes to Vegas, Becky. Yeah, good stuff. Thank you. And apologies for the confusion at the top of all of 
 
 that, you both did a super job, thank you.
 <br>[09:25:00]
 
TREENE: It's OK --
 
ANDERSON: Well NATO's outgoing chief says the mission in Afghanistan was a catastrophe for the military alliance. Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg 
 
 spoke with CNN Christiane Amanpour as she prepares, as he prepares, sorry to step down at the end of this month.
 
The U.S. and its allies pulled out of Afghanistan in August 2021 after almost 20 years of fighting the Taliban. Well, the militant group is now 
 
 back in power, despite all the efforts by the U.S. led coalition and $2 trillion spent by Washington alone. Stoltenberg says NATO's ultimate goal 
 
 in Afghanistan was simply a step too far.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JENS STOLTENBERG, NATO SECRETARY GENERAL: Afghanistan that was -- that is and was painful, because we tried something that we didn't achieve. We 
 
 tried to build a democratic, free Afghanistan with equal rights for men and women. We realized after some years that that was too ambitious. That was 
 
 something that required too much. Because reality was that we didn't have the resources they will to do that for decades.
 
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: And yes, yet it was more than 20 years. There was, like trillions of dollars spent, lots of 
 
 people, and now we can safely say that it's gone 360 back to Taliban, 1.0. I mean, that is a catastrophe, in fact.
 
STOLTENBERG: Yeah, extremely bad. And catastrophe, not least for the people of Afghanistan, in particular, women and I met many women members of 
 
 parliament, journalists who begged us to stay. And for many years, I promised that we will stay. We were going to live on a conditions-based 
 
 approach.
 
AMANPOUR: Yeah.
 
STOLTENBERG: But after 20 years and after paying a high price in -- pressure, we realized NATO allies, realized the United States realized that 
 
 we could not continue this, and therefore we made the decision to leave Afghanistan.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: And tune in Thursday to see the full exit interview with NATO Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg. That is 01:00 p.m. Eastern time, 06:00 
 
 p.m. in London, 09:00 p.m. if you're watching here in Abu Dhabi. Well, Peru has lost a former president who is considered both a hero and a villain in 
 
 his country, according to who you speak to.
 
Alberto Fujimori died on Wednesday at the age of 86 after a long battle with cancer, according to his daughter. To his supporters, Fujimori was a 
 
 strong man. The country desperately needed when he took office in 1990. He brought Peru back from the brink of economic collapse and defeated a 
 
 terrorist group that de stabilized the country.
 
To others he was an autocrat who used security forces to crack down on anyone standing in his way. Fujimori was later convicted and imprisoned for 
 
 human rights violations and corruption. We are back after a quick break. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:30:00]
 
ANDERSON: Well, welcome back. I'm Becky Anderson, you're watching "Connect the World". The bell has just rung on Wall Street, and the U.S. market is 
 
 out of the gate. And here is how things are looking. Futures were indicating a rather mixed open, and that indeed is what we have got 
 
 investors watching two key pieces of news out in the past hour.
 
In the United States, data shows that wholesale prices rose in line with expectations, with the Producer Price Index rising by 0.2 percent for 
 
 August, another set of inflation data pointing in the right direction, while the European Central Bank has just cut interest rates for the second 
 
 time this year, that move was made to tackle sluggish growth and slowing inflation. We've got the Fed meeting, of course, and a decision on U.S. 
 
 rates next week.
 
Let's bring in Anna Stewart with more on what is going on in Europe with the ECB's rate cut. Talk us through, if you will, Anna the ECB decision?
 
ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER: Well, the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde, is still speaking on the press conference that follows this rate 
 
 decision. The rate decision itself, as often is the case, was completely expected. Everyone thought there would be a rate cut.
 
This is the second rate cut for the ECB. The last one was in June. But what's really interesting is to look into what the language is around that 
 
 decision, and also what the outlook is going forward. Will we continue to see at the pace we've had more rate cuts from the ECB, and there's a lot of 
 
 reason for caution right now with Europe.
 
You know, GDP is not looking that healthy. It's pretty stagnant in terms of economic growth for the Eurozone, it actually came in for the second 
 
 quarter at 0.2 percent which is barely growing. And the ECB today says it's revising downwards its economic projections for this year, the year after 
 
 and the year after that.
 
Also risks in terms of inflation is coming down, but it's very sticky when it comes to services, inflation, which went higher in the summer, wages. 
 
 Similar arguments that we often see in the U.S., of course, and here in the U.K., actually. And it was interesting Lagarde she said, the risk to 
 
 economic growth is tilted to the downside.
 
And one of the things she mentioned, in addition to geopolitics, the war in Ukraine and so on, was the potential for an increase in trade restrictions 
 
 for the Eurozone's major trading partners -- it's keeping its eye on the U.S. election and who the next President will be. Because, of course, one 
 
 president is more likely to bring in some tariffs and protectionist policies, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Yeah, it was, it could be Donald Trump. He was really not a big European fan, was he? Certainly, wasn't a fan of European space. So, we 
 
 will see. Meantime, before that election and the -- there is a Fed decision, of course, next week, Jerome Powell is the Head of the Federal 
 
 Reserve, Anna has said that.
 
This is a decision which is completely away from politics. Will have nothing to do with politics. This is an independent central bank in the 
 
 United States. But whether or not you know this has anything to do with politics, it will be highly politicized whatever happens next week. What 
 
 are we looking at here?
 
STEWART: Of course, it'll be heavily politicized, even though it is not a political decision. Listen, all of the expectations here are for a similar 
 
 story in the United States. All eyes on the federal reserve for a rate cut. This would be their first we've had two here in the U.K., with the Bank of 
 
 England.
 
Essentially, as inflation is coming down, as we are seeing the cost-of- living crisis easing, that is when you see the unwinding really, of what has been a really restrictive policy. If anything, we could see more rate 
 
 cuts, I think, from the U.S. in the next year, over the next 12 months, than the ECB, if you look at where they've been.
 
So, the ECB actually had negative rates at some at one stage. So already its rate is much lower than the United States or the U.K., so it's got less 
 
 room to maneuver, and also the difference in terms of economic growth, really quite interesting. Eurozone grew 0.2 percent in the second quarter.
 
For the U.S., it actually revised it recently. It grew 3 percent in the second quarter, so much healthier economic break over there.
 
ANDERSON: Yeah. It's so interesting, isn't it? I mean U.S. economy is doing well. They have calmed it down. Inflation is down, looking at interest rate 
 
 cuts, and yet it is. The economy is front and center for U.S. voters and most, it seems --
 <br>[09:35:00]
 
That things are unless they don't feel better off. It's such an interesting, you know, set of sorts of visions and feelings, emotive 
 
 feelings about where that economy is at present. Thank you. Ahead of this, after this break, ahead of this NFL game, Miami Dolphins Star Tyreek Hill 
 
 has been reflecting on the moments before he was dragged out of his car by police on Sunday. More on that coming up.

ANDERSON: Well now a single request to an artificial intelligence platform consumes about 10 times as much electricity as a typical Google search. 
 
 That's according to the IEA, which is the International Energy Agency. Goldman Sachs says by 2030 AI is expected it to increase its demand on data 
 
 center power by a whopping 160 percent. AI being talked about a lot right now and ready or not tonight, it goes mainstream thanks to Oprah.

OPRAH WINFREY, HOST OF THE OPRAH WINFREY SHOW: AI, it may fascinate you or scare you, or if you're like me, it may do both. So, let's take a breath 
 
 and find out more about it. I've gathered --
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, White House officials will meet with top tech execs today discuss how to move forward given an AI's huge demand for energy. The U.S. 
 
 government is asking what can be done about AI, seemingly quenchless thirst for it? Well, CNN's Matt Egan has more.
 
MATT EGAN, CNN REPORTER: But what doesn't really get enough attention is how this technology consumes vast amounts of energy. What's really 
 
 interesting here is that a single request on ChatGPT consumes 10 times the electricity that is as a typical Google search 10 times. Think about that.
 
And by 2026 the AI industry is projected to consume 10 times as much energy as it does right now. And so that is why they are meeting at the White 
 
 House today. This is the first time the White House officials are sitting down with AI leaders and executives from the power industry to try to 
 
 discuss how they can meet AI's needs for energy without putting too much stress on the power infrastructure.
 
So, CNN has learned that this meeting, which hasn't been previously reported will include Mr. ChatGPT himself. That's Sam Altman, the CEO of 
 
 OpenAI. Other executives from the tech world include Ruth Porat, a Top Executive from Google, and the CEO of Anthropic, another major AI company, 
 
 and Microsoft is also expected to have a representative.

And from the federal government, the -- as you mentioned, the Energy Secretary, Jennifer Granholm, but also Commerce Secretary, the National 
 
 Security Advisor, will all be there. And this shows how, we have leaders from the public sector and the private sector. They're trying to address 
 
 this issue of meeting AI's energy needs.
 
And it's also worth noting that this is something that Sam Altman has been focused on. He's been I'm talking at length recently and publicly about how 
 
 the U.S. needs to do more to get AI infrastructure up to speed.
 
ANDERSON: Fascinating, isn't it? Matt Egan reporting for you. Rock Star Jon Bon Jovi found himself in the right place at the right time to help, save a 
 
 life. That place was a pedestrian bridge in Nashville, Tennessee, where a woman was standing on the other side of the railing, appearing ready to 
 
 jump.
 
Bon Jovi was filming a music video when he noticed the woman, the singer and another person helped lift the woman to safety and gave her a hug. 
 
 Police say the woman was taken to hospital and they thanked the singer for coming to her aid. Well, Miami Dolphins Star Tyreek Hill admitted some 
 
 regrets about his actions during his pre-game detainment on Sunday.
 
Speaking to the media before tonight's NFL game, he did call for the officer who restrained him to be taken off the force. Amanda Davies with 
 
 more, Amanda.
 
AMANDA DAVIES, CNN WORLD SPORT: Hi, Becky. We're gearing up for week two, match day two in terms of the NFL, but discussions, all the headlines very 
 
 much focused still on the repercussions of what happened at the Hard Rock Stadium ahead of match day one or game day one for the Miami Dolphins.
 
You can only imagine what has been going through Tyreek Hill's head over the last four or five days or so, very much the focus both on and off the 
 
 field. He said, I am used to being an athlete, being able to look at myself, assess where things have gone wrong, what I did right, what needs 
 
 to be done better.
 
There's obviously been a serious period of self-reflection in terms of his role in the traffic incident where he was dragged out of the car by the 
 
 police officers in Miami Dade. But he has stood firm in terms of his assessment of the police officer who has been suspended pending an 
 
 investigation, and he's returning to take to the field of play once again.
 
ANDERSON: Right.
 
DAVIES: And I'll be joined by my colleague, Andy Scholes in just a little while, a couple of minutes to look at the impact that the last few days 
 
 might have had on him.
 
ANDERSON: Good stuff. "World Sport" up after this, we will be back with more "Connect the World" after that.
