SARA SIDNER, CNN ANCHOR:  This morning, Moscow now pointing a finger at the United States, claiming it directed Ukraine to carry out an alleged drone attack on the Kremlin. The White House is calling the allegation ridiculous. Ahead, what we're learning about that new claim.
 
JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR:  No defense. Former President Donald Trump's legal team says it will not call witnesses in the civil battery and defamation case brought by Author E. Jean Carroll. Court resumes this hour.
 
KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR:  And the man accused of a shooting rampage inside an Atlanta medical center is about to appear in court. What we're learning about the suspect and what his mother is blaming today. We're following these major developing stories and more all coming up right here on CNN News Central.
 
SIDNER:  This morning, the White House is pushing back hard on Russia's baseless accusation that the U.S. directed Ukraine to carry out an alleged attack on the Kremlin. Moscow claims it was an attempt to assassinate President Vladimir Putin. The White House calls the allegation the U.S. was behind that ridiculous, and Ukraine is also strongly denying any involvement in that attack.
 
After making that claim with no evidence, Russia ramped up its attacks on Ukraine. At least 23 people were killed by Russian shelling in the Kherson region Wednesday. And Kyiv's military chief said the city was hit by the most intense airstrikes so far this year overnight.
 
CNN's Alex Marquardt joins us now. Alex, National Security Spokesman John Kirby told CNN they are still monitoring what happened at the Kremlin. What more do you know about this new claim by Russia?
 
ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Sara, national security officials here in Washington still very much poring over any intelligence they have to try to figure out what exactly happened here, but this is a significant escalation from Russia to accuse the U.S. of direct involvement, in their words, of what they had already called an act of terrorism and an attempt on Vladimir Putin's life.
 
But at the same time, Sara, it is in line with what we have heard from Russia before, accusations that Ukraine is simply a puppet of the U.S. and NATO, that Russia is, in fact, fighting not only against Ukraine but against the U.S. and the rest of NATO. And so what we've heard this morning is a forceful rejection of these new accusations from the Kremlin, the White House calling these claims ridiculous. We heard earlier on CNN from the White House's John Kirby who called them ludicrous. Take a listen.

JOHN KIRBY, NSC SPOKESPERSON:  I would just tell you Mr. Peskov is lying. I mean, it's obvious, it's a ludicrous claim. The United States had nothing to do with this. We don't even know exactly what happened here, Kaitlan. But I can assure you the United States had no role in it, whatsoever. And, again, just to be clear, and I think you covered this at the beginning, that we neither encourage nor do we enable Ukraine to strike outside Ukraine's borders.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MARQUARDT:  Sara, Peskov did not provide any kind of evidence to back up his claims. We should note that as we look at what happened yesterday, Peskov really is at the center of this timeline, as we examine it. These attacks -- this alleged attack, I should say, happening around 2:30 in the morning, Peskov spoke with reporters about ten hours later and there was no mention of any of this. You would think that the Kremlin spokesman might have something to say about an alleged attack on the Kremlin.
 
Now, Ukraine, of course, denying any involvement publicly, we heard from President Zelenskyy yesterday. We should note that they're also denying it privately. The White House has, of course, spoken with Kyiv in the wake of this, and we are told by numerous officials that Kyiv is denying this to them as well.
 
But, Sara, this does raise significant concerns regardless of what happened, regardless of who's responsible, that Russia could use this as a pretext to further escalate their attacks on Ukraine and perhaps on Kyiv itself. Sara?
 
SIDNER:  They've already said in their words that they were going to retaliate. Sos we can expect more there in Ukraine. Thank you so much, Alex Marquardt, for that. Kate?
 
BOLDUAN:  New this morning, the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose last week to 242,000. This is a sign -- could be a sign that the labor market is softening.
 
The release of this data, though, comes at an interesting moment, as the U.S. banking system continues to be rattled Bloomberg News is reporting that the regional bank, Pac West, is, quote, exploring strategic options, including a possible sale. And exploring strategic options I sometimes think is likely also could be considered Wall Street speak for, please help. [10:05:00]
 
CNN's Christine Romans, she is joining me now for a look at this. So, Christine, you've got this with Pac West. You've got the Fed chairman saying just yesterday the banking system is sound. JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon saying also this week the banking system is sound, and then you have the reporting on Pac West. How does it all fit together?
 
CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Maybe is true, right, that, overall, the banking system is solid, it's better than it was in 2008, but you have these pockets of weakness in the banking sector after a year of higher interest rates. Pac West in a statement saying nothing really has changed here. The bank has not experienced out of the ordinary deposit flows following the sale of First Republic Bank and other news.
 
But you can see the stock is really getting hammered here. It had been $26 a share before this bank drama began back in March, and then now it's down in the $3 handle.
 
You're also watching this other company, First Horizon Toronto Dominion Bank, T.D. Bank, they've called off a $13 billion merger, and that has sort of shaken some nerves on Wall Street, too. This was kind of a plain vanilla merger that was announced back in February, but a lot has changed since February. And they're citing the fact that they can't get a clear regulatory timeline here, so abandoning that merger here kind of just adding to these -- I won't call it a crisis, I'll say stress in the banking system.
 
BOLDUAN:  And it could be various data points made, have some link, may not be coming all at the same time, it has kind of the same something of an effect, of shaking it, rattling it, even if it is still stable and very strong.
 
There's a new Gallup poll I wanted to ask you about. It shows that almost half of all Americans are concerned about the money that they have in the bank. But the FDIC insures all depositors up to $250,000. Where's the worry?
 
ROMANS:  Look, I think that's a really important point to make. It shows that people are feeling more actually nervous about their money than any time since the great financial crisis in 2008, even though we know your money, if you have an account in a bank and you have $250,000 or less, it is insured. There are people who have been in these banks that have failed over the weekend, it's been taken over by the FDIC. And then on Monday morning, they've been able to withdraw their money, they've been able to transfer money, the apps have worked. So, all of that has been very, very smooth, but it still shows the worries among consumers.
 
And I think longer term what that might tell us is does that mean consumers get a little more cautious. Consumers drive the economy. Does all this feed into sort of a slowing of the American economy here?
 
BOLDUAN:  So, that's -- because one of things that's been consistent that is added to the complicated picture has been the strong consumer spending throughout this entire roller coaster we've been. So, let's look for another interesting chapter ahead.
 
ROMANS:  Watch this space, right.
 
BOLDUAN:  Exactly. Thank you, Christine.
 
ROMANS:  You're welcome.
 
BOLDUAN:  John?
 
BERMAN:  All right. This morning, a dire warning from the White House. Officials say a protracted debt default could wipe out more than 8 million jobs and cut the stock market in half. This as House Republicans and President Biden remain locked in a standoff over raising the debt ceiling.
 
CNN's Arlette Saenz is at the White House this morning. Arlette, how much closer are they to a solution this morning?
 
ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, John, still no movement as we're heading into that meeting next week between the White House and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and other congressional leaders.
 
But what the White House is trying to do today is lay out the stakes, the real world impacts that a potential default would have on Americans, as that so-called X date is less than a month away. The president's top economic advisers writing yesterday, detailing three scenarios that they're looking at, including the possibility of this brinksmanship continuing but resulting in a deal.
 
Even if they wait until the last minute to hammer out an agreement, the White House is projecting that there still would be significant impacts on the American economy. They say that there could be up to 200,000 jobs lost. There's also a scenario where they look at just a short-term default, which would be about 500,000 jobs lost in the country.
 
And then there's that eye-popping 8 million jobs lost figure, which would be tied to what they described as a protracted default, something that would range into the three-month period. And those advisers wrote in a blog post yesterday that, quote, a protracted default would likely lead to severe damage to the economy with job growth swinging from its current pace of robust gains, losses numbering in the millions.
 
Now, this also follows Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warning lawmakers earlier in the week that a potential default on the U.S.'s obligations could occur by June 1st. She warns that even waiting up until the last minute could cause serious harm to business and consumer confidence.
 
The White House is really hoping that these warnings might help to move the needle in the discussions over the debt ceiling. But for the moment, the two sides still remain in their corners as the White House says it's not moving off its position, that they want to see a clean debt ceiling increase while Republicans still want to see those spending cuts tied to any decisions on the debt limit.
 
BERMAN:  Yes. Look, they all know how bad this could be. It'll be interesting to see if it moves them any closer to working out some kind of deal. Arlette Saenz at the White House, Arlette, keep us posted. Sara?
 
SIDNER:  Next hour, Suspected Mass Shooter Deion Patterson is expected to make his first court appearance in Atlanta.
 <br>[10:10:07]
 
He is suspected of killing one person and opening fire inside a waiting room at a medical center where four others were also injured yesterday. This morning, CNN has received new 911 dispatch audio from that rampage. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They're now advising an active shooter, a person shot. Bed advised. A female shot. She's seriously bleeding. Shot in the thigh and the back. Black male about six feet tall wearing a black hoodie. He's going to be a per between the ages of 20 and 25 named Deion Patterson. Caller is still on the phone with 911 advising it's going to be her son.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SIDNER:  Patterson led police on a nearly eight-hour manhunt across the Atlanta metro area. He was eventually arrested about, and you can see on the map, ten miles north of where that shooting took place.
 
CNN's Nick Valencia is in Atlanta for us. Nick, we're hearing from Patterson's mother this morning. What is she saying about his state of mind potentially?
 
NICK VALENCIA, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Sara, she released a very heartfelt statement to our local affiliate here, WANF, in which she advocated for her son and also apologized to all the families who suffered loss yesterday, all those who were injured as well.
 
And she chose to focus part of her statement on the mental health of her son, saying in part that this was caused and part by mental health. She says this mental health illness is real. And when we say it's real from a medical standpoint, it is real. And when someone is saying they need help or you see that they're acting out of sorts, they need help. Help them, just don't disregard them.
 
The Atlanta Police Department has yet to release a motive as to why they say Deion Patterson opened fire yesterday at that Midtown medical facility. He is charged with three counts or four counts, rather, of aggravated assault, as well as one count of murder.
 
Our local affiliate here, WSBTV, they also spoke to the mother of Patterson who says that he became agitated during a medical evaluation he was there for, saying he was denied the prescription for Ativan, which is an anti-anxiety medication.
 
As you had mentioned, he is expected to make his first court appearance at about 11:30 local here. His mother, we're told, is cooperating with the police, as is the Coast Guard. Patterson is a former member of the Coast Guard between 2018 and 2023. He was discharged from active duty. And we understand that the Coast Guard is cooperating with authorities as well. Sara?
 
SIDNER:  All right. Nick Valencia, thank you for all that. Kate?
 
BOLDUAN:  Coming up on CNN News Central, back behind bars, the last of four escapees from a Mississippi prison finally captured. How it happened, that's ahead.
 
Plus, a team of doctors in Boston performing incredible brain surgery on a child in utero. Sanjay Gupta has an exclusive look and he joins us.
 
And later, it is going to be busy to fly this summer. Delta has already reported record advanced bookings, and the FAA is making moves to try and fill major vacancies and air traffic control towers across the country, but will it be enough? We have a report.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:15:00]
 
BERMAN:  The North Carolina House has passed a bill to ban abortions after the 12th week of pregnancy. It now heads to the state Senate. Now, the state's Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, is a vocal supporter of abortion rights but a super majority for the Republicans in the general assembly means that any veto would not hold.
 
The last of the four men who escaped a Mississippi jail last month has been arrested. Cory Harrison was taken into custody this morning about 30 minutes away from the jail in Crystal Springs, Mississippi. Two of the other inmates who escaped were found dead, a fourth was arrested in Texas.
 
Some scary moments for a woman in California, the stroller that was carrying her great niece rolled directly toward traffic. You can see it going right there. Oh, my gosh. She tried to rush and catch up to it but she fell and could not get back up. But, luckily, right there, you see a Good Samaritan sprinting in to stop the stroller in the nick of time. Everyone, we are told, they're doing fine. Kate?
 
BOLDUAN:  I mean heart-stopping as I was just watching that. Okay.
 
BERMAN:  Good thing he was there, right?
 
BOLDUAN:  I mean, yes.
 
All right, now that my head is back on straight after watching that, here we go. Let's turn now to the civil battery and defamation trial against former President Donald Trump, this as E. Jean Carroll heading back into court once again this morning. Her attorneys are expected to rest their case today after they call a few more witnesses, and then Trump's legal team says that they will not be calling any witnesses.
 
CNN's Kara Scannell outside the courthouse once again for us in New York. So, Kara, court is going to be dark tomorrow. So, it seems that today is shaping up to be a pretty important day.
 
KARA SCANNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Kate, and it is. I mean, the jury is listening now for the second day the videotaped deposition of former President Donald Trump answering questions posed by Carroll's attorney. He sat for this deposition in October. The jury heard 20 minutes yesterday. They picked up right where they left off this morning listening again to this deposition.
 
Trump is sitting there in a blue suit. He's fairly hunched forward, sitting very still. And at the moment I just saw, they showed a photo, that black and white photo of him when he had met E. Jean Carroll and he's standing there. Next to him is his wife, Ivana Trump, and she's with her husband. He looks at it in the photo and says he never met Carroll, he says he recognizes her husband and then he says, that's Marla, right? That's my wife, literally fingers pointing to the piece of paper to E. Jean Carroll.
 <br>[10:20:01]
 
And he's corrected by the attorneys saying, no, that's E. Jean Carroll.
 
So, that's something that Carroll's attorneys want to use to show that she was his type. Because part of the defamation claim is that Trump said she wasn't his type.
 
Now, they also asked him both yesterday in this deposition and the portion played today, again, about the statements he said, where he never met her, she wasn't his type, she made up a story. And he said, yes, I absolutely did say those statements, I never did meet her.
 
So, there's about another 15 minutes of this video deposition that they will play today. And part of it, they previewed, is that they're going to show him reacting to the Access Hollywood tape. That is tape where he said I just kiss women and along with a lot of other things. But that is another portion of this. They played it yesterday for the jury when they had a witness, another woman who has come forward and said that Trump had forcibly kissed her when she was interviewing him for People Magazine. They played the tape then for the jury, but they'll see now Trump's reaction to it on this videotape.
 
Then Carroll's team is going to call a friend of hers who Carroll said that she confided in at the time. Then they say after another two witnesses, they will rest their case. And as you said, Trump's attorneys say that they will not be calling any witnesses in their defense. The judge is saying that the jury could get this case as soon as Tuesday. Kate?
 
BOLDUAN:  As soon as Tuesday. All right, Kara, thank you so much. This trial moving along.
 
SIDER:  It sure is. All right, coming up, the writing is on the wall for air travel. It could be a hot mess this summer. What you need to know.
 
Plus, as President Biden runs again, Congressman James Clyburn is ready to endorse again. So, what's his message to voters on the fence? We'll talk to him live, next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:25:00]
 
BOLDUAN:  We do have breaking news coming in. A partial verdict has been reached in the seditious conspiracy trial against five members of the Proud Boys for their actions leading up to and on January 6th.
 
Let's get over to the courthouse. Katelyn Polantz is standing by with the latest for us. Katelyn, what are you picking up? What are you hearing?
 
KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE REPORTER:  Kate, we do have a partial verdict coming up. The judge is going to be taking the bench in five or ten minutes to have that verdict returned by the jury.
 
This is a major case, the centerpiece really of much of the efforts of the January 6th prosecutions brought by the Justice Department. In this case, there are five men accused of seditious conspiracy among other charges, other conspiracy, efforts to obstruct Congress on January 6th. Those five men are perceived to be leaders of the Proud Boys. Some of them are -- others were working with the leaders allegedly.
 
And in this case, that includes Enrique Tarrio, the leader of the Proud Boys who wasn't even in Washington, D.C. on January 6th. But prosecutors have really tried to make the case for several months to this jury and the jury has been deliberating for about seven days, have asked a couple of really astute questions about the law over recent days. And now, they have informed the court that they are at a verdict and they're ready to deliver that.
 
BOLDUAN:  As you mentioned, the jury has been deliberating for about seven days, but bring people up to speed on everything that went into the prosecution that DOJ brought and went on in this trial.
 
POLANTZ:  Well, this trial is one of those cases where the prosecutors had just gobs and gobs of video and text messages and signal messages, all kinds of communication as well as footage from the day of January 6th. And the argument that they were making to the jury was that these men were working together. And then once they got there to the Capitol on January 6th, they broke off from the crowd and found a way inside the Capitol that revved up all of the Trump supporters there and got them breaking into the building.
 
And so that is what they have been arguing on the prosecution side. They also have shown plenty of text messages about these men talking about revolution, civil war, being very celebratory. On the defense side, the argument is that these are just goofballs, that these were men that they weren't working together, they didn't have a master plan, and this was just something that they took part in, even if they were on the Capitol grounds, at least for four of the five of them. Kate?
 
BOLDUAN:  All right, Katelyn, she is going to have all the details for us when the judge does take -- get back into the courtroom, and we do hear what this partial verdict will mean. Katelyn Polantz, thank you so much. We're going to continue following this and bring you the updates as they're going to be coming in. Sara?
 
SIDNER:  All right. Thank you so much.
 
President Biden's re-election campaign has released its second ad focusing on the economy and targeting battleground states. Democratic Congressman James Clyburn, who played a critical role in electing Biden to his first term, is joining us now. Thank you, sir, so much for being here today.
 
REP. JAMES CLYBURN (D-SC):  Well, thank you very much for having me.
 
SIDNER:  Joining us from there in South Carolina, where voters helped to skyrocket President Biden into the White House because they chose him during the primary, can you tell me if you think this is going to happen again? Will the people of South Carolina back Joe Biden for other four years? He has made some promises, like putting a black woman on the ticket for vice president. He did that. He put a black woman in the Supreme Court. But when it comes to something like police reform, that has not happened in the way some folks in the country thought it should.
