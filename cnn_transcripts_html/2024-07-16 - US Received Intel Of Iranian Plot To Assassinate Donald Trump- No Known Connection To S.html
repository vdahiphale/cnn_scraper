BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN HOST: Welcome back to CNN's Special Live coverage of the Republican National Convention. I'm Boris Sanchez coming to you live from Milwaukee.
 
Brianna Keilar, my good friend and co-anchor is live for us in Washington, DC. Day two of the RNC Convention has kicked off, and at any minute, Donald Trump's newly minted running mate, freshman Senator JD Vance of Ohio is expected to do a walkthrough of the convention center ahead of his big speech. All of this happening as we are learning of an Iranian plot to assassinate former President Donald Trump, a plot with no known connection to Saturday's assassination attempt.
 
Now, CNN's Evan Perez is going to have more details on that plot in just a moment. But first, we want to go to Kaitlan Collins, who is on the convention floor and Kaitlan, what are you seeing now? What's coming later tonight?
 
KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN HOST: Yes, Boris, it is a little bit calmer right now. We're not being totally crammed here on the floor, which typically is the case when the delegates are actually here on the floor.
 
I am standing in between Wisconsin and Pennsylvania right now. And if you can see behind me, you could see Donald Trump, Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle, they are two people who are expected to speak tomorrow.
 
Donald Trump, Jr. is going to be one of those introducing the newly minted vice presidential nominees, Senator JD Vance when he gives his speech tomorrow. Of course that first formal appearance that we are going to see from him since he was picked yesterday as Donald Trump's running mate.
 
And I should note that I am hearing from sources that Donald Trump and JD Vance are expected to appear every single night here at the Republican Convention together.
 
Obviously, we saw all that moment last night, one of the biggest moments, probably that is going to come out of this convention where Donald Trump entered the hall here where I am standing, the VIP box is just behind the camera. And of course, you see that bandage on his ear, and so, just moments like that that remind everyone of exactly what happened on Saturday night, how that has changed what you are going to hear from some of these figures like Donald Trump, Jr. on the campaign stage who say -- on the delegation stage, I should note who say that they have changed and toned down their speeches.
 
Of course, we will have to wait to see how those speeches are actually delivered. We saw Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson saying they put the wrong one in the teleprompter when he spoke yesterday, so we are watching all of these moments.
 
And the other person that we are expected to see here to come out to also test out the microphone and the lectern is Senator Vance himself. There is a lot of security here on the delegation floor right now, Boris, as we are watching from them.
 
The other thing though, to keep an eye on, on that stage behind us tonight is you're going to see two of Donald Trump's fiercest Republican critics now turned allies of his who are back on an endorsing him for the 2024 campaign. That's Governor Ron DeSantis and Governor Nikki Haley, who both were harsh critics of his during the campaign when they were challenging him for the Republican nomination with Ron DeSantis saying he did not believe Trump was pro prolife and Nikki Haley saying she thought that trump was unhinged and diminished.
 
And so now you will see them coming out in support of him tonight just speaks to really what we are looking at here on the floor, how much the Republican Party has changed in the eight years since there was a last formal convention in Cleveland, Ohio.
 
SANCHEZ: Kaitlan Collins, look forward to seeing you on that claustrophobia-inducing jam-packed conference floor. Thanks so much.
 
Let's go now to CNN's Evan Perez, who helped break this exclusive CNN reporting on the Secret Service ramping up security after they received intel of an Iranian plot to assassinate Donald Trump.
 
Evan, bring us up to speed.
 
EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Boris.
 
Well, this was information that came from a human source. This is intelligence that came from a human source that indicated that the Iranian intelligence services were plotting to assassinate the former president. And so that led to the Secret Service increasing some of their protection for the former president in the last few weeks.
 
We saw the Secret Service say that over the weekend that they had increased some of his protection and it did not have to do necessarily just with the fact that he was about to become the official nominee for the Republican Party for the presidency, but it had to do with this new intelligence that was deemed credible enough that they needed to take some action.
 
Now, we should note that this has nothing that appears to be nothing at all to do with the gunman on Saturday, a 20-year-old from Western Pennsylvania, who did manage to get on a roof and fired those shots at the former president narrowly missing his head and of course, what could have been a fatal shot.
 <br>[15:05:03]
 
So what we do know though, is that obviously this is raising new and important questions for the Secret Service as to why and how that is possible that someone could be able to get to a roof and fire those shots.
 
Now, we have a statement from an official in the administration, a US official, National Security official and I will read you just what they're saying in reaction to our reporting. They say: "The Secret Service learned of the increased threat from this threat stream, the NSC directly contacted the Secret Service at a senior level to be absolutely sure they continue to track the latest reporting. The Secret Service shared this information with the detail" -- the former president's detail, his protective detail, "... and the Trump campaign was made aware of an evolving threat."
 
"In response to the increased threat, Secret Service surged resources and assets for the protection of former President Trump." We should note also, Boris, that we heard from the Trump campaign and they say that they do not comment on former president's security and they've directed questions to the Secret Service.
 
But Boris you know, keep in mind that there has been a long-running concern about Iran. You remember that in 2020 during the former president's administration, the United States assassinated the former head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, Qasem Soleimani, and as a result of that, the Iranians have been known to be making threats against John Bolton, against Mike Pompeo, others in the US government, and of course, against Donald Trump in retaliation for that.
 
So that is something that that have been on guard for and the other factor we understand over the course of months, the Secret Service has made it very clear to the campaign that there were inherent risks about doing these outdoor events because they are so much harder for them to control access to.
 
So there is something that has been repeatedly warned to the campaign about holding these types of events, the kind that happened on Saturday, where of course a gunman was able to get those shots at the former president -- Boris.
 
SANCHEZ: Yes, notable given the context of what we saw unfold.
 
Evan Perez, thank you so much for that reporting.
 
PEREZ: Thanks.
 
SANCHEZ: We want to discuss now with Republican Congressman Dan Meuser of Pennsylvania. He is a state co-chair of the Trump campaign, and he was actually there on Saturday in Butler when the shooting took place. Congressman first, I want to get your reaction to this reporting that there was actually enhanced security at that rally in light of the Iranian plot to assassinate former President Donald Trump.
 
Enhanced security at a rally in which the president was still talking by a shooter, roughly 150 yards away. What's your reaction?
 
REP. DAN MEUSER (R-PA): Yes, the shooter's plan wasn't all that complicated, right? I mean, he went around the so-called perimeter. He climbed up on a building with a -- seemingly an AR-type weapon and was able to fire.
 
So there was certainly a lot of security there, both Homeland Security, Secret Service, and local Pennsylvania State Troopers, and the local police. So there was ample security.
 
The plan and execution clearly had some significant lapses in it. A hundred fifty yards outside of the staging area, able to get a shot off from a rifle. I mean, anybody who hunts knows that that that's an easy target to hit.
 
And I'll tell you something, Boris, I mean, we were -- I was sitting with Dave McCormick and Mike Kelly, and many others. Christine Toretti, our national committee person, many others, was truly within the line of fire. We were right under it, and that's where the poor gentleman from Pennsylvania was hit because he was raised up and he was trying to be heroic and guard his children and his wife and tragically, he was murdered in this.
 
SANCHEZ: Yes, our hearts go out to that fire chief and his family.
 
MEUSER: Yes.
 
SANCHEZ: From that devastating moment to what we saw unfold last night on the floor of the convention, what was your reaction to seeing the reception that the former president got here?
 
MEUSER: Well, I will tell you, it is an emotional thing. I mean, when the president went down, when the gunfire began, we looked at him, he grabbed his head, he went down, he hit the deck. That wouldn't think he fell. He hit the deck.
 
But when he came up, I mean, everybody fell with him. I mean, literally and figuratively. I mean, it was a really heartfelt catastrophe that just occurred, and when he came up in fist pump and said -- meaning, I'm okay, in a way it made everybody okay.
 
So when he came in here yesterday, I mean, people were just so emotional to see him walking strong, alive, and just being so positive and strong.
 
And I will tell you, I mean, that's a signal of I think who the man is. I mean, the fortitude and strength of character to react in that way under those circumstances.
 
So I think a lot of people find that a very appealing quality in a leader.
 <br>[15:10:10]
 
SANCHEZ: There have been calls from both Democrats and Republicans to tone down the political rhetoric in light of what we saw unfold. I am wondering if you support those calls and what you would like to see from the folks that are speaking here at the convention.
 
MEUSER: Very much so. I support it very, very much.
 
I mean, we really need to use this as a unifying moment and there is no reason it shouldn't be. There is a lot of personal attacks that have taken place, and certainly some from Republicans. We will take responsibility.
 
But there has also a lot coming from the left. I mean, just this past Friday, excuse me, Joe Biden was stating how Donald Trump was nothing short of Hitler. He is going to be a dictator. He is going to destroy our country. He is dangerous to our country.
 
The bullseye comment that we heard. I mean, frankly the First Lady Jill Biden saying President Trump is evil and I am not saying it is one-sided, but those are pretty personal attacks and that is why I challenge the DNC and the Biden ministration to a policy debate.
 
Let's avoid all of these mischaracterizations because that's what they are, they are really not based upon truth. They are based upon trying to get -- trying to fire up one side over another.
 
SANCHEZ: So, I am sure you've heard the reporting that the vice presidential pick, JD Vance at one point likened president Trump to Hitler. We also heard even last night several speakers talking about Democrats being dangerous for the country.
 
One speaker referred to President Biden as being senile. Do you wish that hadn't been a part of the proceedings?
 
MEUSER: Absolutely. I do my very best to not make that part of my vernacular, my vocabulary. Now, I will tell you this. Sometimes, sometimes it does, it gets a little hot out there in politics. But we need to all make a conscious effort to cool it down, to tone it down, and we need to see examples of it.
 
You know, again, there are two sides to the story, but even in the press release for the Democrats' platform give us some really, really inflammatory language in there regarding what -- who the president is, what is he going to do as opposed to where it should be filled and what policies they have to make a better future for America.
 
SANCHEZ: I understand in our reporting that part of the way that the Trump campaign is planning to use the Ohio Senator JD Vance in their campaign is to fortify the so-called blue wall -- Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania obviously, your home state.
 
What do you think JD Vance brings to the table in helping Republicans recapture Pennsylvania. MEUSER: Well, you know what? He is a very good messenger. He is very -- he speaks very, very clearly, and he makes -- I think he makes policies very common sense and sensible to people. I mean, I've noticed that in him over the last two years.
 
I mean, if you look at his background, very humble beginnings, joined the Marines, then went to Ohio State. Then went to Yale Law School, had a successful business career.
 
You know, I think as the American people get to know him as I do, and certainly as President Trump, because he is going to pick the best person he can under the criteria that he had, so I think he is going to impress the American people.
 
SANCHEZ: You were speaking about JD Vance's background. He is actually in our background right now. These are live images of the vice presidential pick touring the stage where he is set to deliver remarks later this week.
 
Does it bother you at all that at one point he was a Never Trumper and that he said those things about the former president and called people that voted for Trump stupid?
 
MEUSER: Sure, it does, but on the same note, it is more impressive that President Trump can overlook that and get past that and say, okay, once he learned more about our agenda, about President Trump himself, about what America First means, it doesn't mean America alone, it doesn't mean America and the heck what everybody else, it doesn't mean that at all. It just means, let's make America strong as it can be so our allies and friends can be that much stronger, in my view, and I think that is stated.
 
And so, you know, I think it is kind of impressive that President Trump can get past that and give him the most important job in his administration.
 
SANCHEZ: It is notable that there are going to be several Republicans who said negative things about the former president taking the stage, not just this week, but specifically tonight.
 
Congressman, we appreciate you joining us to share your perspective.
 
MEUSER: Likewise.
 
I want to send it to my colleague, Kaitlan Collins, who is on the convention floor right now, getting an up close view of the new vice presidential pick.
 
COLLINS: Yes, Boris, you could see Senator JD Vance right now on stage behind me. He is getting a little bit of a tour, like all the speakers that you're going to see in primetime tonight and tomorrow and later this week are. We've seen all of them come out to kind of just get a test, see where they are, see where the prompters are, see where the cameras are, and practice coming in and off the stage.
 <br>[15:15:04] Also up there right now with him notably is Donald Trump, Jr., who of course is one of Vance's fiercest advocates to make him his dad's VP pick. I am told that there was even a moment last week at Mar-a-Lago where Donald Trump, Jr., hearing that his dad was considering other people like North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum went in and made a personal appeal again to his dad to put Vance on the ticket believing that he would be the best for him.
 
And notably, given that influence and said clearly how it, in part worked with his father. He was interviewed, Donald Trump, Jr. was by AXIOS earlier this morning. He was asked what his thoughts were on staffing for a potential second Trump term, what that would look like, if he would be recommending anyone else for his father's administration.
 
He said he didn't necessarily want to pick people to be at jobs, but he wanted to have veto power over certain people that he did not believe should be in there and Senator Vance himself has also been questioned on this when he once wrote that he wanted to be able to fire every mid-level bureaucrat and replace them with people who are loyal to Trump, arguing that that was something that worked against him during his first time in the White House.
 
That was something that ABC's George Stephanopoulos questioned him about. And so obviously, I think that's something to think about as we talk about what this pick is looking like and the fact that Senator Vance is going to be on Donald Trump's ticket as if they are elected to the White House as president and vice president, what that means for what the staffing of a second Trump term would look like, something that of course has had heavy and intense focus.
 
And as we see, it does include at least one former Trump critic who says his views have evolved and Vance himself.
 
And so Boris, yes, I will just note that we are watching them come up here, take a bit of a loop around the stage. We are going to see that a lot over the next few hours as then we get into the speakers tonight that does include that very long list of people who could potentially also hope to have a job in the Trump Cabinet, in the Trump administration.
 
I talked to Doug Burgum yesterday, just a few hours after he learned he was not going to be the vice presidential pick, he said that when he connected with Donald Trump during the day yesterday, Trump called him, Mr. Secretary, hinting that he may have a role in a future Trump Cabinet if there is one.
 
Now, that is notable because Burgum said previously that he did not want any Cabinet secretary position. It was VP or nothing basically for him. Yesterday, he seemed potentially open to doing so -- Boris.
 
SANCHEZ: Yes, we often see that tune change when the opportunity becomes available.
 
COLLINS: Yes.
 
SANCHEZ: Kaitlan Collins from the floor of the convention, thank you so much.
 
Stay with CNN. Our special coverage from the RNC continues after a quick break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[15:21:56]
 
SANCHEZ: This video is from moments ago, JD Vance going through a walkthrough of the stage at the Republican National Convention here in Milwaukee. At one point, embracing former President Donald Trump's son, Don, Jr. alongside his girlfriend Kimberly Guilfoyle.
 
His big moment, JD Vance's as the newly anointed running mate of Donald Trump coming later this week as he addresses the convention, one of many big moments we are expecting on the heels of last night's dramatic appearance by the former president with a bandage still on his ear after the attempt on his life last Saturday.
 
We are joined now by CNN's Chris Wallace, and Chris, obviously, the convention comes at an important moment in history, and last night, you said that you'd never seen a moment like that at a convention before when Trump emerged and was received by this crowd.
 
CHRIS WALLACE, CNN HOST: Less than 48 hours after an assassins bullet had grazed his ear and by a millimeter missed taking him out and the feeling on this convention floor, the joy was quite extraordinary.
 
One moment that may be compared to it, and I thought about this after I made that statement, 1964, just nine months after President Kennedy was assassinated, his brother, Bobby Kennedy, who was the attorney general, came to the Democratic Convention in Atlantic City, you can see him there, to introduce a tribute video to his brother and the convention, remember these were the delegates who had thought they were going to be there to renominate his brother, his slain brother, gave a standing ovation for 22 minutes before Bobby Kennedy could finally speak.
 
And to give you a sense how fraught this was, Lyndon Johnson, the president and Bobby Kennedy did not like each other and Johnson and was afraid that the delegates were going to draft Kennedy and make him the vice presidential nominee over Johnson's objections.
 
So Johnson would let Kennedy speak until the last day of the convention after Hubert Humphrey, the senator, had already been nominated for vice president. He did not want this extraordinary display of emotion to get out of hand and force him to live with Bobby Kennedy as his vice president for four years.
 
SANCHEZ: a fascinating slice of history especially given that we know the fate of Bobby Kennedy eventually.
 
WALLACE: Exactly.
 
SANCHEZ: Well, Chris, I wanted to before we focus on tonight, get your thoughts on something that stood out to me about last night that we haven't actually addressed yet, at least not on NEWS CENTRAL and that is Amber Rose.
 
I asked you earlier if you were familiar with her and you surprised me when you said yes, but I am not --
 
WALLACE: But not very familiar.
 
SANCHEZ: I thought she gave one of the best speeches of the night.
 
WALLACE: No, I have to say, and the CNN anchor, but with a lot of people who had never heard of her, people were very impressed with her, among other reasons, because she is a performer. She knows how to talk, not to ten or 15 or 20,000 people in the in the arena here, but to millions of people watching at home and that kind of personal one- on-one staring into the camera and talking in a very low-key personal way.
 <br>[15:25:18]
 
And not somebody you would typically expect at any convention, particularly not a Republican Convention, and I think, an indication you also saw that with the labor leader, Sean O'Brien of the Teamsters of how determined the Trump camp is to try to reach out and win over some demographics.
 
They are doing surprisingly well among young voters and Amber Rose is obviously an effort to try to cement that relationship.
 
SANCHEZ: Yes, no question about that.
 
I wanted to get your thoughts on what we are going to see tonight, not only the theme of safety in the United States, but also party unity with some of Trump's recent rivals who said disparaging things about him taking the stage and endorsing him.
 
WALLACE: Yes. I think the big moment tonight is Nikki Haley.
 
Nikki Haley, who as you say, was very critical of Trump, called him unhinged, called him diminished, said that he creates chaos during the campaign, stopped running in March. But as people said, it was kind of a zombie campaign even though she was no longer a formal candidate, she got 16 percent of the vote in April in the Pennsylvania primary and 20 to 25 percent in some of those color, suburban counties around Philadelphia that are so important for Trump to try to pick up.
 
If he is able to get some of those Nikki Haley voters to go for him instead of Joe Biden, that could be the difference between winning and losing a state like Pennsylvania, which is probably a must-win state for Joe Biden if he is going to get re-elected president.
 
SANCHEZ: Chris Wallace, always great to get your perspective, an Amber Rose fan, I didn't know that.
 
WALLACE: Well, I wouldn't say fan. You asked me if I knew who she was, I said yes, I did.
 
SANCHEZ: Fair enough. Fair enough. Chris, thanks so much. We will be watching you tonight. Thanks so much.
 
WALLACE: Thank you.
 
SANCHEZ: Coming up, the Republican Governor of Georgia recently revealed that he didn't vote for Donald Trump in the primary, so what is he hoping to hear from the former president at the RNC during his speech that's promised to be toned down.
 
We will discuss in just moments.</pre>
