MAX FOSTER, CNN LONDON CORRESPONDENT AND ANCHOR: Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us from all around the world and everyone streaming us on CNN Max too. I'm Max Foster, I'm in London. 
 
Across the Middle East though and around the world there's an all-out diplomatic push right now to contain the fallout from Iran's unprecedented aerial assault on Israel early on Sunday and to prevent any further escalation of violence. Israel says that over the course of about five hours some 350 drones, missiles, rockets all fired from Iran, Iraq, Yemen and by Hezbollah as well in Lebanon. Israel intercepted most of them with help from the U.S., U.K. and France however the U.S. says it won't join any retaliatory strikes. 
 
Now soon after the attacks the U.N. Security Council called an emergency session. Members of the G7 held a virtual meeting with regional leaders which began and regional leaders began reaching out to their global counterparts as well. At the U.N. the U.S. warned Iran against taking further action.

ROBERT WOOD, U.S. DEPUTY AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N.: Let me be clear, if Iran or its proxies take actions against the United States or further action against Israel Iran will be held responsible. The United States is not seeking escalation. Our actions have been purely defensive in nature. The best way to prevent such escalation is an unambiguous condemnation from the Council of Iran's unprecedented large-scale attack and an unequivocal call on it and its proxies and partners to refrain from further violence. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: Well a source tells CNN Israel's War Council is divided on a response but a call from the U.S. president convinced Israel's Prime Minister to delay retaliation at least for now. CNN's Paula Hancocks joins us now from Abu Dhabi. So no response right
 
 now but they're certainly thinking about one and a former IDF spokesperson said it would more than likely include a direct hit on Israel, on Iran rather. 
 
PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Max. I think the overall consensus is that there will be a response. The question at this point is what's the timing and what sort of format will that response take? 
 
The fact that the war cabinet meeting lasted for hours and went on into Sunday evening is very telling. It's clear that there is disagreement within the cabinet or differences of opinion as to exactly what the -- the response should be but there is expected to be a response. We know that it is -- this coalition in Israel at this point does have a very far-right element within it and certainly we've been hearing very publicly from some of those ministers that they want to see a hard and fast response to Iran but we have heard from others within the government that want to take more time.
 
We've heard from for example the president Herzog who was speaking to CNN saying that they want to have a cool-headed response to what we saw over the weekend. Let's listen to what he said. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ISAAC HERZOG, ISRAELI PRESIDENT: I think we're operating in a very focused way and a very responsible way and I'm sure there will be a decision accordingly that will make sure that we protect and defend the people of Israel and of course serve the idea of this coalition that has emanated all of a sudden in front of our eyes in opposing the aggressive acts and the operations of Iran in the region for so many years. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HANCOCKS: We have heard that Israel's cabinet is determined to act and at this point they are asking the military for more options so the options they had on the table on Sunday none of them seemed appropriate it would appear and they're asking for the military to figure out other ways that it can retaliate against Iran and that unprecedented attack on Israeli soil on Sunday. 
 
What we have also heard from one senior Biden administration official is that they believe Israel is not looking to escalate the situation. That's the message that Israel is giving at this point but of course the concern is that there will be a significant escalation in the wider region. 
 <br>[03:04:59]
 
There's been an escalation just by the very fact that this is the first Iranian attack from Iranian soil onto Israeli soil and we've also heard from Iran's president saying that if Israel responds then there would be an even bigger response from Iran. As far as Tehran is concerned this was a retaliatory attack for a suspected Israeli attack at the beginning of the month on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Damascus and they have been very clear in their messaging saying that they believe now they have retaliated and the situation has concluded. 
 
Of course that is not the way that Israel sees it. Max.
 
FOSTER: Paula Hancocks in Abu Dhabi, thank you. 
 
Other countries in the Middle East are calling for restraint on both sides of the conflict. Egypt's foreign minister spoke with his counterparts in Iran and Israel on Sunday warning any further escalation could destabilize the Middle East even more. The Saudi foreign ministry issued a statement expressing concerns over any potential severe repercussions.
 
In a social media post the ministry called on the U.N. Security Council to step up and manage the situation given the threat to international peace and security. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman also spoke with Iraq's Prime Minister to discuss steps to prevent further escalation in the region. 
 
Officials in the UAE responded as well. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement saying it called for resolving differences through dialogue and through diplomatic channels. 
 
Joining me now is Kasra Aarabi, Director of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Research at the United Against Nuclear Iran, a non-profit and non-partisan policy organization. Thank you so much for joining us. I mean, it is a horribly tense situation, isn't it? What do you think the Israeli war cabinet at least will be weighing up today? 
 
KASRA AARABI, DIRECTOR OF IRGC RESEARCH, UNITED AGAINST NUCLEAR IRAN: Well, I think it's important to underscore that Israel must retaliate. The Islamic Republic of Iran, the regime in Iran, conducted an unprecedented attack on Israeli soil. 
 
It should be noted, though, that this was a well-choreographed attack, a symbolic attack really serving the propaganda needs of the regime. 
 
Israel was tracking the drones, for example. It had advanced notice that this attack was coming. The Islamic Republic of Iran communicated this. 
 
So this was serving propaganda needs. However, it also the regime in Iran is seeking to test the boundaries of the red lines, push the red lines further. 
 
So an Israeli retaliation is a must to deter this action from taking place in the future. 
 
But also the key element here is the U.S. support for Israeli retaliation, because if Tehran perceives about the Biden administration being weak in its support, we can expect greater escalation, particularly in the next 10 months before a potential new administration in the White House. 
 
FOSTER: We had the attack on the Syrian consulate, didn't we, for Iran. Then we had this, which many people are seeing more of as a warning strike because it didn't have any casualties and it was pretty easily disrupted with the support of Israel's allies and Iran saying this is now concluded. If the counter strikes continue, that's the dangerous area, isn't it?
 
 Rather than, you know, because there's been resolution already to some extent (inaudible). 
 
AARABI: I would come back to that. I would come back to that and we need to set the record straight here. 
 
There's been a lot of talk about diplomatic facility in Syria. The facility that was being used by the Islamic Republic of Iran was being used by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the IRGC, the paramilitary organization of the regime.
 
The individuals that were targeted were IRGC terrorist commanders. Mohamed Reza Zahedi, who was among those who was killed by Israel in Syria, was responsible and oversees, or oversaw the IRGC foots force operations in the Levant. And that includes, by the way, personally spearheading the more than 170 attacks on U.S. forces by IRGC proxy. So that's important to understand. This was the Revolutionary Guard exploiting diplomatic status for terrorist operations. 
 
Now, the danger here, as I go back to that original point, is that the regime in Iran is testing the boundaries of the red lines. It's pushing these boundaries, pushing the red lines further and further. 
 
Now, since October 7th, it has been doing this. The Islamic Republic has been escalating against not only Israel, but the U.S. and its regional allies. Now, the Biden administration since October 7th has gone out of its way to tell Tehran that it does not seek to impose direct consequences on Iran. 
 <br>[03:10:06]
 
Now, rather than having a de-escalating effect, that's actually shaped the Iranian calculus, that's shaped the Islamic Republic's calculus, and has made them believe that they can get away with escalation without facing any consequences. 
 
So it's key to lead to, in order to have the escalation, the U.S., the Israelis must change that calculus and must make it very clear to the regime in Iran that there will be direct consequences imposed on it, including in sites on IRGC sites inside of the country. 
 
FOSTER: But it was a consulate, which the Iranians argue was sovereign territory. So that was the escalation from their point of view. 
 
AARABI: Well, the Islamic Republic has for years been exploiting international protocol on diplomatic status, not just in the Middle East, but also in Europe. When we've seen terror plots taking place in Europe against targeting Iranian diaspora members, targeting members of the Jewish community, the Islamic Republic's embassy has always acted as a shield, and has been exploited by the terrorist arm of the regime to conduct such attacks. 
 
You have to understand why was, and ask the key question, why was the IRGC's Gutz Force commanders meeting at a so-called diplomatic compound? Why was Mohammad Reza Zahedi, who spearheads and is responsible for coordinating Hezbollah attacks on Israel, why was he using a diplomatic facility? 
 
Well that is because the IRGC exploits international protocols on diplomatic status to conduct terror operations. Now, Zahedi, as I said, was responsible for coordinating Hezbollah attacks on Israel, for overseeing more than 170 attacks on U.S. forces. By the way, that includes the killings of three U.S. soldiers.
 
Now the U.S. still, despite the fact that U.S. forces were killed, has avoided, until now, imposing direct consequences on Tehran. That calculus must be changed. You need to change the calculus of the regime in Iran if we're looking for long lasting peace and stability and de-escalation in the region. 
 
FOSTER: Kasra Aarabi, thank you so much for joining us with your insight today. 
 
AARABI: Thank you very much. 
 
FOSTER: Now, Iran's attack on Israel has renewed debate in Washington over military aid, facing pressure from both sides of the aisle. House Speaker Mike Johnson says he'll try this week to bring an Israel aid bill up for a vote. Whether that bill will include funding for Ukraine, as well, remains to be seen.
 
CNN's Melanie Zanona has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MELANIE ZANONA, CNN CAPITOL HILL REPORTER: Well, Congress is divided right now over how to provide aid to Israel and specifically whether to also attach aid for Ukraine. This was a question that Speaker Mike Johnson was already wrestling with. But that question has taken on renewed urgency and significance in the wake of Iran attacking Israel. 
 
Now, Speaker Mike Johnson did say that he plans to put some type of Israel aid bill on the House floor this upcoming week. But he said those details are still being finalized. Let's take a listen.
 
REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA), U.S. HOUSE SPEAKER: The House Republicans and the Republican Party understand the necessity of standing with Israel. We're going to try again this week. And the details of that package are being put together right now. We're looking at the options and all these supplemental issues. 
 
ZANONA: And part of the reason for the indecision here is because Johnson is facing competing pressures over how to proceed. In one corner, there are bipartisan calls, including from GOP leader Mitch McConnell, including from some of Johnson's own Republican committee chairman in the House, to just put a Senate-passed foreign aid package on the House floor. That package includes aid for Israel, Taiwan and Ukraine. 
 
And if the House were to pass it, it could go immediately to President Joe Biden's desk for signature. But in the other corner, Johnson is facing calls from his conservative hardliners to keep Israel and Ukraine separate. And one of those hardliners includes Marjorie Taylor Greene, one of those people who has threatened Johnson's job and his speakership if he moves ahead with any aid to Ukraine.
 
So Johnson has some very big decisions to make in the coming days. He did participate in a phone call on Sunday with the other top four congressional leaders with President Biden to discuss the ongoing situation in the Middle East. But at this moment, very uncertain how Congress is going to act. And what Johnson does has not only big implications for his speakership, but also for our allies abroad. 
 
Melanie Zanona, CNN, Washington.

FOSTER: Still to come, leaders of G7 countries met virtually to discuss a diplomatic response to Iran's attack on Israel. More on their message to Tehran after a quick break. 
 
Plus, we're also getting reaction from leaders in Asia to Iran's attack. Our special coverage continues in just a moment. 
 <br>[03:15:07]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: Israeli officials say they are determined to respond to Iran's large-scale attack, but are still figuring out the timing and the scope of any action. The IDF says Iran launched about 350 missiles and drones at Israel, but most of them were shot down by the Israeli military and its partners, including the U.S. 
 
In an emergency session of the U.N. Security Council on Sunday, America's deputy ambassador to the U.N. reiterated the country's support for Israel and condemned Iran's attack in the strongest terms. But he said the U.S. is not trying to escalate tensions in the region. Leaders of G7 nations are also well, they also met on Sunday to discuss, quote, "an urgent diplomatic response to Iran's attacks on Israel". The group condemned the strikes in, quote, "the strongest terms expressing solidarity with Israel". 
 
In a joint statement, they demanded that Iran and its proxies cease attacks and said that they will continue working towards stabilizing the situation and avoiding further escalation. 
 
For more reaction from around the world, CNN's Kristie Lu Stout standing by for us in Hong Kong. Barbie is also in Rome for us because Barbie, the Italian Prime Minister really led these international discussions. 
 <br>[03:20:08]
 
BARBIE NADEAU, CNN REPORTER: That's right. You know, Italy right now holds a rotating presidency of the G7. There was a big meeting here in Puglia in the southern part of the country in June. But before that, this week on the 17th, the foreign ministers will meet in Capri. And that is going to be an absolutely important point in the diplomatic efforts here, not just in the response to Iran, but also in how Israel responds to these latest attacks. Now, Europe has been very, very strong in its support of humanitarian
 
 efforts inside Gaza. But, you know, Europe is a complicated place. And the 27 member states don't always agree on basically anything, but they certainly don't agree necessarily on the relationship historically and in the future with Iran. And that complicates things even more.
 
The Italian foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, is leading these talks that begin on Wednesday in Capri and vows to do everything they can with the G7 in order to kind of temper the emotions right now and to try to keep things, to try to de-escalate things and keep things, you know, as calm as possible. Because, of course, this affects much more than instability in the region. It affects trade in the Red Sea. 
 
And also, you've got to remember that there is a war already going on here in Europe with Ukraine. And that was going to be the main topic of conversation. But it's going to be Iran right now, this week, Max. 
 
FOSTER: Yeah. Kristie, China not always getting involved in matters like this, but it could hold a lot of sway potentially. 
 
KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, and China has weighed in along with other nations across Asia. China, in fact, has expressed deep concern. It's calling for an immediate ceasefire. It's also calling out what it calls countries of influence to act. 
 
On Sunday, we heard from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and they said this. Let's bring up the statement for you. Quote, "this conflict must end now. China calls on the international community, especially countries with influence, to play a constructive role for the peace and stability of the region". 
 
China, they're making reference in particular to the United States. Look, China wants to be a peace broker in the Middle East. It's a region where it sources a growing amount of oil and energy. But from Beijing's point of view, the off-ramp here is now for China to step in and restrain Iran before the United States to step in and to restrain Israel. 
 
Now, in addition to China, we also heard from Japan and South Korea, leaders there strongly condemning the strikes. 
 
India and Pakistan have also expressed concern. Indonesia and Malaysia are urging restraint. And we also heard from close U.S. ally Australia. Australia has condemned Iran's attacks on Israel. It says it continues to support regional security, including that of Israel. But, Max, as you can imagine, this attack has raised the threat of a much wider conflict, and Asia is on tenterhooks. Max. 
 
FOSTER: Well what sort of leverage might you expect China to use here over Iran? 
 
LU STOUT: Well, Max, analysts say that China on paper has leverage. Yes, it's true. China has big investments, trade relations with Iran. China is a main purchaser of Iranian oil. China has helped soften the blow from U.S. sanctions. China also delivered that surprise deal last year when it brokered the reestablishment of diplomatic ties between Iran and Saudi Arabia. 
 
But analysts say China's leverage has limits, as does China's appetite to get involved. You know, analysts point out that relations between Iran and China are shaky. They've been strained by China's underinvestment in Iran, not delivering on investment promises. And China also tends to mind its own business. It doesn't want to overextend itself the way it believes the U.S. has. 
 
And that's why, from China's point of view, the solution here, again, is not for China to step in and restrain Iran, but for the U.S. to restrain Israel. Max. 
 
FOSTER: Okay. Kristie, Barbie as well, thank you both very much indeed for joining us.
 
Just ahead, Becky Anderson will be speaking with the Jordanian foreign minister on what Iran's attacks mean for the region at large. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[03:25:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: I'm Max Foster, you're watching "CNN Newsroom". 
 
More on our top story today, the U.N. Secretary General calling for de-escalation in tensions over Iran's attack on Israel. 
 
During Sunday's emergency Security Council session, Antonio Guterres said, quote, "now is the time for maximum restraint". 
 
Israel and Iran condemned each other's actions during that meeting, but the U.S. warned in no uncertain terms that Tehran, quote, "will be held responsible if it takes any action against the U.S. or Israel". 
 
Jordan is issuing a stern warning to Iran after its attack on Israel. Residents in Amman say they saw and heard explosions in the sky over parts of the capital Amman early on Sunday morning. The footage taken by residents and obtained by CNN shows what appears to be mid-air interceptions, although CNN can't independently confirm that. But Jordanian officials summoned the Iranian ambassador later on Sunday and during an interview, Jordan's foreign minister asserted the country's firm stance on national security and vowed to, quote, "intercept every drone or missile that violates Jordan's air space. It has a real regional impact". 
 
For more on Jordan's position, let's go to my colleague Becky Anderson, who's in Abu Dhabi. Becky. 
 
BECKY ANDERSON, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT: Max, it is just over 600 miles or a thousand kilometers in a direct line, if you will, from Iran to Israel across Iraq, Syria and the Kingdom of Jordan. The government in Amman confirming there were interceptions of, quote, "flying objects over Jordan to secure, it says, the safety of its citizens". Look, Jordan does not want to see this conflict spilling over, nor
 
 does anybody across this wider region. And we're hearing the demands for de-escalation, for restraint, profound concerns around this region, statements from ministries of foreign affairs, foreign ministers, leaders saying we need to see de-escalation, not escalation at this point. 
 
Well, I'm joined now by the Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman al- Safadi. He is live for us from Amman. 
 
And Foreign Minister, let's start with the Iranian strikes. I mean, unprecedented five-hour wave of projectiles directed towards Israel. To be clear, was it Jordan or the Americans who intercepted those projectiles over Jordan? 
 
AYMAN AL-SAFADI, JORDANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER: Good morning, Becky. The attack was a retaliation to the Israeli targeting and attack of
 
 the Iranian consulate in Damascus. The Iranians said that they've done what they needed to do and no more. Now I think the pressure is on Israel not to escalate and work towards the objective that we all share, which is de-escalating the conflict.
 
And the first step towards de-escalation is ending the aggression on Gaza, ending the illegal measures on the West Bank, and get on a track that will produce just and lasting peace on the basis of a two-state solution that we all believe is the only path to peace and security. 
 
As far as Jordan, what we did was consistent with our longstanding policy. Any projectiles, drones, whatever that enters our space historically, and we'll continue to deal with it because it poses a threat to Jordan. We are in the range of fire. Any missile or projectile that could fall in Jordan would cause harm to Jordan. So we did what we have to do. 
 
And let me be very clear, we will do the same regardless where those drones are from, from Israel, from Iran, from anybody else. Our priority is to protect Jordan and to protect Jordanian citizens, and to do whatever we can against escalation that would be detrimental to all. 
 
ANDERSON: Foreign Minister, was it the Americans or the Israelis who asked you to intercept or are you saying it was absolutely a decision by Jordanians first and foremost, unilaterally, to intercept those projectiles? 
 
AL-SAFADI: As I said, Becky, our longstanding policy, whatever objects that go into our skies, violate our airspace, that we believe pose a danger to Jordan, we will do whatever within our means to end that threat. And that's what we did. 
 
Again, I think what happened was a sign of how terrible things could be, how dangerous the situation could deteriorate into, unless we deal with the cause of all this tension, which is the Israeli aggression on Gaza, and the continued absence of political horizons to solve the conflict as a result of Israeli policies. Again, Iran retaliated against the attack on the sea, that is over. Now we have to look to the future, and to look for now actually, and to make sure that there's no other triggers for escalation. And I think the onus is on Israel for that. 
 
ANDERSON: And I want to pursue your thoughts on that. Let me just bear with me for one moment. Were you warned ahead of the pending attack by Iran? I mean, you summoned the Iranian ambassador over statements you said they've made against Jordan. So firstly, were you warned? And secondly, can you be clear about what was said to the Iranian ambassador? I mean, does Jordan believe it is under increased threat from Iran and its proxies at this point? 
 
AL-SAFADI: Look, I mean, it's no secret that, you know, days before the attack, it was clear to everybody that the attack, that the Italian retaliation was imminent. And we were aware of that, as were many, many other countries. 
 
In relation to the question of the summoning with the ambassador, we saw in reaction to what we believe was harmful disinformation statements carried by Iranian news agency against Jordan, incitement against Jordan. And we told them very clearly, very unequivocally, that this is not acceptable. 
 
Their problem is with Israel and not with Jordan. And we will not allow for such disinformation against Jordan to continue. And we will retaliate if they continue with that. We don't want conflict with Iran. We don't want conflict in the whole region. But in order for good relations with Iran to develop, we have to address all causes of tension with Iran, which include some intervention and some threats to our national security, including through or by militias affiliated with Iran that are trying to flood Jordan with drugs and weapons. But again, I think we need to be focused. The issue here is not Iran. The issue here is the aggression on Gaza. 
 <br>[03:35:00]
 
The issue here is the extremely illegal and harmful measures to the Palestinians of the West Bank. This has to stop. As you said, Becky, nobody wants escalation. We all want to calm things down. But the first step towards that is ending the aggression. And we're seeing that aggression continuing. And I think one more point I want to say is that, look, the Israeli prime minister has always wanted to invoke some sort of confrontation with Iran. Now, as the international pressure on Israel to stop the aggression on Gaza continues, invoking a fight with Iran is something that we believe he thinks could dilute that pressure and could take attention away from Gaza and focus on this new confrontation. 
 
What we tell all our partners in the international community, the issue is in Gaza and the West Bank. And our focus needs to continue to be on that because unless we solve that, then the chances for regional escalation will continue. 
 
ANDERSON: And you and I have -- have spoken about this at length over months and months, even before October the 7th, you have been warning of the potential for a widening escalation here. King Abdullah has spoken to Joe Biden, the U.S. president, and he has warned him that any escalatory measures would widen this conflict. And again, you've warned since October the 7th and before that, that this region is being driven to the abyss. 
 
We hear those sentiments echoed around the wider region. Do you genuinely believe the Biden administration will be able to use its leverage with Israel to contain the situation, given that you've just said you believe that Benjamin Netanyahu is intent on widening this war? 
 
AL-SAFADI: Look, I mean, we do hope that will be the case. Reports about American positions have clearly said that the U.S. has taught Israel that it should not escalate, that it will not even support Israel if it -- if it decides to go against Iran. And as I said, I mean, Israel attacked the embassy, the consulate in Iran and consulate in Damascus. Iran retaliated. It said it will do no more. So I think that should stop now. And I think the whole world has an interest in making sure Israel gets that message and is not allowed to invoke another confrontation with Iran. 
 
As to your second question, look, we've said it before. I think I said it on your show, Becky, before, that as the pressure on Netanyahu mounts as a result of the continuation of the war in Gaza, he will be looking for ways to dilute that. And I think he has an interest in the conflict continuing so that he doesn't face the reckoning that he is inevitably going to face in Israel.
 
And therefore, we should all be cognizant of that fact and we should all work to make sure that this escalation doesn't happen, that the war in Gaza stops, so that we all start working on a once-and-for-all solution that will end this conflict on the basis of the two-state solution that would fulfill the legitimate rights of the Palestinians to freedom and statehood and also address Israel's legitimate security concerns. 
 
Other than that, we're going to be in this cycle, in and out. And history has shown that the region won't go into conflict unless the root cause of that conflict, which is the occupation of the Palestinian territories, the measures that are being taken by Israel systematically to kill the two-state solution, are stopped. 
 
And again, you see what's happening with the West Bank. Since Friday, six Palestinians have been killed, over 60 injured. Houses and cars have been put on fire by settlers who continue to rampage Palestinian communities. 
 
So that is the danger that we are focused on right now. Again, the only way to de-escalate is to stop the aggression, create real, credible political horizons that would take us to a solution that will be in the hands of Palestinians, Israelis, and everybody else in the region. 
 
ANDERSON: Foreign Minister, Jordan, let's be quite frank here, is trying to balance what is a very delicate position. Maintaining relations, of course, with the United States, but also with Israel. You have a peace treaty with Israel, with what is your highly critical position of the way that Israel has carried out its war against Hamas in Gaza. And many in Jordan want to see the kingdom do more. And that includes calls for cutting ties with Israel. Will that happen? 
 
AL-SAFADI: Becky, it will not happen simply because we don't believe that will be helpful to Jordan or to the Palestinians or to the cause of peace, which is a necessity for all of us in the region. 
 <br>[03:40:03]
 
That said, however, given what Israel is doing, given its killing of political horizons, given the aggression on Gaza, that peace treaty is a document collecting dust because we will not be able to act on many of the opportunities that this treaty should offer to us, to the Palestinians, to the whole region. Public opinion, as you said, is extremely against any kind of normalization with Israel now.
 
And again, this is Netanyahu's doing, not since October 7, but long before October 7, when he publicly said he doesn't believe in a two- state solution, when he publicly said he will suffocate the aspirations of Palestinians for freedom, when he continued with settlement building, confiscation of land, security attacks on Palestinian communities, allowing settler terrorism against Palestinians. 
 
This is the reality. So Jordan is a country that believes in the necessity, in the need for just and lasting peace for all, because we believe it's the only path to bringing about peace and security to Palestinians, to Israelis, to all of us. 
 
But in these conditions, under these circumstances, and we've warned before, Becky, that the amount of dehumanization and hate that this war is producing in Israel, in the Arab Muslim world, is extremely dangerous and it will be extremely difficult to navigate through in the future, unless there is serious effort that will deliver just and lasting peace that we all have been working for. 
 
ANDERSON: Foreign Minister, let me ask you this as a final question. Who is more of a threat to that peace and security, not just for the region, but international peace and security at this point, Israel or Iran? 
 
AL-SAFADI: Look, I think there's no point comparing, Becky. Israel and what Israel is doing, what this Israeli government is doing, what the radicals in this Israeli government are inciting for, is an extreme danger to the security and stability of the Middle East. 
 
And as far as Iran is concerned, Iran is saying, even though it retaliated again -- against the attack on its embassy, the war on Gaza had been happening for six months. 
 
The retaliation came after the attack on the consulate. But if we solve the Palestinian issue, if we fulfill the Palestinians' right, if we create real peace between Israel and the Palestinians, then all of us will tell Iran, you know, you have nothing to, you have no right to interfere in the affairs of the Palestinians or all of us. So I think everything is connected in the Middle East. All conflicts are interconnected. And I think we need to start by the urgent now, and the urgent is to end the aggression in Gaza, start a real horizon for peace, and then we can deal with Iran. And look, it's clear that we have issues with Iran. 
 
As I mentioned, the drug trafficking from Syria by militias that are affiliated with Iran, intervention in the affairs of the Arab world. But I think right now, Iran is saying that it has a problem with Israel because of the occupation. It champions itself as a protector of the Palestinian and Arab Muslims' right. If we solve the Palestinian issue, then all of us will be able to tell Iran, hold on, hold back, don't drive us into trouble. So I think the immediate danger now is the aggression, is the failure to create political horizons.
 
And as for Iran, all of us want, again, good relations with Iran, with Israel. But in order for that to happen, roots of conflict, causes of tension have to be addressed. And right now, I think the biggest cause of tension in the region is the war on Gaza and the continuation of the occupation and the absence of any political horizon for fulfilling the Palestinians' right, and therefore create a peace that will also address the legitimate rights and concerns of Israel.

FOSTER: In our other top story, just three months before the Republican Party is set to choose him as their presidential nominee, Donald Trump is going on trial today in New York. Jury selection will begin just hours from now. Trump will be there and it'll be an unprecedented scene as well. Never before in American history has a current or former president faced a criminal trial. 
 
He's accused of falsifying business records to hide the reimbursement of hush money paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels. The former president is pleading not guilty. CNN's Zachary Cohen has more on how the jury selection process will work.

ZACHARY COHEN, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY AND JUSTICE REPORTER: Donald Trump will make history when he arrives in lower Manhattan on Monday as the first former president to face a trial over criminal charges. The trial is expected to last about two months, but will take its first step forward with the beginning of jury selection. Lawyers on both sides will ask hundreds of potential jurors a series of questions about their feelings toward Donald Trump and the fact that he is a current candidate for president. The goal is to narrow down the pool to 12 jurors plus a handful of
 
 alternates who can render a verdict fairly. That process could take days or even potentially weeks, but when selected, they will be able to watch Trump throughout the duration of the trial. 
 
Going forward, Trump will largely trade the campaign trail for the courtroom, where he's expected to be four days a week. It appears likely that Trump will continue to try to use his court appearances to rally support for his presidential campaign, but despite the showmanship, the stakes are high for the former president. He faces 34 felony counts for falsifying business records in the first degree, and if convicted, he could be sentenced to probation or a maximum of four years in state prison on each count.

Still to come, Iran's attack on Israel is causing world oil prices to tumble. Why Israel's next move could impact access to one of the world's largest oil stores just ahead.

FOSTER: Iran's attack on Israel is impacting the global oil markets. Both major benchmarks are down today. Iraq are over-concerned for Iran's oil supply, and comes after they were hitting their highest level since October on Friday, in anticipation of Iran's retaliatory attack. 
 
Anna Stewart, following developments here in London, we're in a bit of a holding pattern, aren't we? Because you don't know what Israel is actually going to do.
 
ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, oil is the key asset to watch if you're looking at sort of the investment appetite around conflict in the Middle East. And with Iran, it's interesting because it's not just to do with the oil supply, but actually the fact that Iran sits on the Strait of Hormuz, which is where around a fifth of the global oil consumption passes through. So there is obviously concern about the supply. 
 
However, looking at the oil prices you see there, they are actually lower today, likely because oil prices actually rose significantly on Friday, in anticipation of the attacks. We've already had that in many ways sort of priced in at this stage. 
 
And we're actually seeing a similar story, Max, in terms of other asset classes over the weekend and this morning. Gold prices, sort of the safe haven where you expect to see money flow
 
 into, those are higher this morning. They're actually off the highs, though, we saw on Friday, where they hit an all-time record high. 
 
And looking at equities as stock markets opened this morning, Asia, Pacific, we saw a fairly mixed story, largely indices were down. I believe the Shanghai Composite bucked those trends. Also, you're looking there at Europe, which opened in the last hour. Mixed picture again, and no huge moves at this stage. 
 
So what I think we can see here is that there was a lot of moves last week in anticipation of the attack. And at this stage, investors are very much treading water to see whether there'll be any sort of escalation in the response from Israel. Max.
 
FOSTER: Okay, Anna, thank you so much.

Now, golf's world number one, Scottie Scheffler, has captured his second career green jacket of the 2024 Masters. The tournament wrapped up on Sunday in Augusta, Georgia, after a dramatic weekend, which saw players battling extremely windy conditions in the opening rounds. Scheffler was up and down during the first nine holes on Sunday, but he finished strong, with four birdies on the back nine, securing victory by four strokes. Scheffler is now in some elite company, just the 18th player to win the Masters more than once. His first victory was in 2022. 
 
We are following all the latest developments for you out of Iran, particularly out of Israel, where they are pondering a response to that Iranian strike over the weekend. And meanwhile, the rest of the world leaders are coming out and scrambling to issue statements calling for restraint. We'll follow all the reaction from both those countries and around the world in the coming hours. 
 
I'm Max Foster, back with more "CNN Newsroom" after this short break.
