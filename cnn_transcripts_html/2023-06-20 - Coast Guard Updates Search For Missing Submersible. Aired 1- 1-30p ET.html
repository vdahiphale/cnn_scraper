DANA BASH, CNN HOST:  He faces 11 disciplinary charges for allegations that he tried to convince then-Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the 2020 election. 
 
Thanks so much for joining INSIDE POLITICS. 
 
"CNN NEWS CENTRAL" starts right now. 
 
BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST:  Some urgent unanswered questions for the Coast Guard this hour. We're going to be hearing from them any moment at a press conference, as this tourist dive vessel has still not been found, the oxygen supply running low. 
 
Officials say the submersible lost contact with its support ship about an hour and 45 minutes into its descent on Sunday. And they say that the vessel has enough oxygen to last about three to four days. So,this is what we're looking at now, anywhere from 50 to 76 hours until they run out of breathable air. 
 
The vessel, by the way, is about the size of a minivan, and it's the property of an expedition company called OceanGate. 
 
Let's head now to Boston, where the Coast Guard is holding this press conference.
 
(JOINED IN PROGRESS) 
 
CAPT. JAMIE FREDERICK, U.S. COAST GUARD: ... search efforts for the 21-foot submersible with five people on board, along with providing an update on current search efforts and plans for the next 24 hours. 
 
On behalf of all the men and women of the United States Coast Guard and our search partners, we offer our most heartfelt thoughts and prayers for the five crew members, their families and their loved ones. 
 
Our crews are working around the clock to ensure that we are doing everything possible to locate the Titan and the five crew members. Yesterday, we set up a unified command consisting of expertise from the United States Coast Guard, the United States Navy, Canadian armed forces and Coast Guard, and the Titan's parent company, OceanGate Expedition. This is a complex search effort, which requires multiple agencies with
 
 subject matter expertise and specialized equipment. While the U.S. Coast Guard has assumed the role of search-and-rescue mission coordinator, we do not have all of the necessary expertise and equipment retired -- required in a search of this nature. 
 
The unified command brings that expertise and additional capability together to maximize effort in solving this very complex problem. 
 
And we're out of order here. 
 
As a recap, on Sunday, the coordination command center in Boston received a report from the Canadian expedition vessel Polar Prince of an overdue 21-foot submarine Titan with five people on board. The Titan was attempting to dive on the wreck of the Titanic approximately 900 miles east of Cape Cod and 400 miles south of St. John's, Newfoundland.
 
Approximately one hour and 45 minutes into the scheduled dive, the Polar Prince lost all communication with the Titan. The Polar Prince conducted an initial search and then requested Coast Guard assistance. The U.S. Coast Guard in Boston assumed the responsibility of search- and-rescue mission coordinator and immediately launched search assets. 
 
Since Sunday, the Coast Guard has coordinated search efforts with the Us and Canadian Coast Guard, Air National Guard aircraft and the Polar Prince, which has searched a combined 7,600 square miles, an area larger than the state of Connecticut. These search efforts have focused on both surface, the C-130 aircraft searching by sight and with radar, and subsurface.
 
With P-3 aircraft, we're able to drop monitor sonar buoys. To date, those search efforts have not yielded any results. Search efforts have continued through last night and today. Today, the vessel Deep Energy, 194-meter pipe laying vessel, arrived on scene with underwater ROV capability. 
 
They have rendezvoused with the vessel Polar Prince, and could then commence an ROV dive at the last known of the position of the Titan and the approximate position of the Titanic wreck. That operation is currently ongoing. 
 
Additionally, a Canadian P-3 aircraft is currently conducting a six- hour search of the area. And several C-130 aircraft and another P-3 are scheduled to fly this afternoon and this evening. 
 
The Canadian Coast Guard cutter or vessel John Cabot is scheduled to arrive later this evening, and several other Canadian Coast Guard vessels and the Coast Guard cutter Sycamore are in route. Additionally, the U.S. Coast Guard has the U.S. Navy's SUPSALV, Supervisor of Salvage and Diving Command, is working with U.S. Transportation Command to bring additional assets to the search area. 
 
These more capable assets will be staged out of St. John's for further transport to the search area. There are also several private vessels, research vessels with ROV capabilities that are making preparations to join the efforts.
 <br>[13:05:00]
 
So I want to reiterate this is a very complex search. And the unified team is working around the clock to bring all available assets and expertise to bear as quickly as possible in an effort to solve this very complex problem.
 
We will continue to provide updates as they become available. And, again, our thoughts and prayers are with the crew and the families and their loved ones. We will provide unwavering effort as we continue the search. 
 
And I think, at this time, we will open it up and take a few questions. 
 
QUESTION:  Captain, can you explain how an ROV would work, sir, if it's tethered to a ship and what it can see? And then could it actually (OFF-MIKE) or something?
 
FREDERICK:  So, each of the ROVs -- so that's kind of a vague question, right? The ROVs have different capability. It's our understanding the current ROV that is deployed at the site now has some limited capability, has a camera on board. 
 
But, again, each of those is different. And we will be gathering more information as that operation goes on for the day. 
 
(CROSSTALK) 
 
QUESTION:  If your submersibles can find this sub, is there any way to retrieve it and save the people on board? 
 
FREDERICK:  Yes, so, right now, all of our efforts are focused on finding the sub.
 
What I will tell you is, we have a group of our nation's best experts in the unified command. And if we get to that point, those experts will be looking at what the next course of action is. 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
QUESTION:  Captain, how many hours of oxygen are left that you know or that you can estimate right now on the submersible? And does it to be approved or regulated? 
 
FREDERICK:  So, first of all, it's an estimate, right? Because we know from the data we were using the starting point was 96 hours. We know at this point we're approximately about 40, 41 hours. 
 
QUESTION:  Forty-one hours left?
 
FREDERICK:  Yes, correct.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
QUESTION:  And does it to be approved or regulated, the submersible? Does it go through anything that you know of?
 
FREDERICK:  Yes, I'm not sure of the exact technical piece of that.
 
We know there's about -- there's about 40 hours of breathable air left, based on that initial report. Again, that was just the initial report based on 96 hours from when the vessel...
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
QUESTION:  Even with that amount of time (OFF-MIKE) if you were to find the submersible at this moment, would that give you enough time to save these five people on board?
 
FREDERICK:  Yes, I -- so, listen, I don't know the answer to that question. 
 
What I will tell you is, we will do everything in our power to effect a rescue. Again, it's going to depend on -- if the ROV finds something, it is going to depend on what they find, what needs to be -- what steps need to be taken next. And, really, that is for the experts within the unified command to take a look at it and then decide what the best course of action is. 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
QUESTION:  It seems to have taken the mother ship vessel, those running this operation, about eight hours to contact you on Sunday, after they lost contact with the sub.
 
Is that a cause for concern?
 
FREDERICK:  Listen, right now, our effort and our focus is on searching with what we know.
 
When -- as soon as we received the report on Sunday evening, we immediately launched search efforts. We flew assets that evening. And we have continued constant surface and air asset searches since that point. 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
FREDERICK:  Go ahead.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
QUESTION:  You mentioned that the search operation is very complicated. What are biggest challenges (OFF-MIKE)
 
FREDERICK:  Well, it's -- this is a complex search. And it's complex for a variety of reasons. 
 
We're -- you're talking about a search area that's 900 miles east of Cape Cod, 400 miles south of St. John's. So, logistically speaking, it's hard to bring assets to bear. It takes time. It takes coordination. And then we're dealing with two pieces of -- you're dealing with a surface search and a subsurface search. And, frankly, that makes it an incredibly complex operation. 
 
QUESTION:  Captain, will the Navy -- will the U.S. Navy or the Canadian Navy to be able to get salvage equipment on time before the air runs out? 
 
FREDERICK:  Obviously, getting salvage equipment on scene is a top priority. 
 
Unified command is working through that to prioritize what equipment we can get there. There are ongoing operations right now via the U.S. Navy and TRANSCOM to get -- to get equipment staged in St. John's and to get it on scene. I can't give you an exact timeline of when that's going to happen. 
 
What I can tell you is, there is a full press -- full-court press effort to get equipment on scene as quickly as we can. 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
QUESTION:  ... the East Coast, though, or is it coming from the Pacific, for example?
 
FREDERICK:  No, the -- so, some of the equipment that is coming is coming from the East Coast, but, again, we're talking about very heavy equipment. 
 
It's a complicated transport operation, but the best professionals in the world are working it. And that's USTRANSCOM.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
QUESTION:  When it's comes to the equipment, can you put in more detail? Do you have a CURV 21 that's being shipped out to that location? 
 <br>[13:10:02]
 
And since you don't have a fleet tug vessel, because the (OFF-MIKE) was decommissioned, what other assets you have? Do you have civilian ships that can help?
 
FREDERICK:  Yes, there are two -- like, I said, there are several civilian ships that have offered services heading that way. There are additional Coast Guard cutters. 
 
We hope to have a Canadian Coast Guard cutter on scene this evening. We hope that they may be able to assume on-scene commander. Polar Prince has been doing a great job with those duties, but if we could take some of that from them, that would be good. 
 
But your question about specific equipment, I'm not going to get into talking about specific equipment. Frankly, I'm not an expert on what that equipment is. But again, I can tell you we have experts in the unified command that are going through that, prioritizing what we need and then how we get it on scene. (CROSSTALK) 
 
QUESTION:  ... the personnel from Boston? How many people from here out there, and also what equipment?
 
FREDERICK:  From Boston, specifically?
 
QUESTION:  Yes, from Boston.
 
FREDERICK:  So, the -- so, Boston -- where Boston plays a role is the command center, the rescue and coordination center is here in Boston. 
 
The aircraft that are coming in are coming from different locations, but the command structure is being worked out of Boston. I think we have time for two more questions. 
 
QUESTION:  In all your years of experience, just how unique is this? Does the Coast Guard (OFF-MIKE) 
 
FREDERICK:  Well, I -- yes, I don't want to speak about if the Coast Guard has ever. I would say it's a unique operation. It's a challenging operation.
 
But, right now, we're focused on putting everything we can at it and searching as hard as we can and getting assets out there as quickly as we can. 
 
(CROSSTALK) 
 
QUESTION:  (OFF-MIKE) assets that are rushing to the area? What sort of assets do they have? Do they have ROVs? Do they have similar technology to OceanGate?
 
FREDERICK:  Yes, so there are some additional assets with ROVs. There is one asset that is working to get on scene with a decompression chamber. So those are all pieces that are coming together, and we're working those logistical challenges to get them there. 
 
And I think we will take one more. 
 
QUESTION:  Is a deep sea rescue a realistic prospect? And what would that look like? 
 
FREDERICK:  Well, I can't tell you exactly what it would look like. 
 
I would tell you that we are out there, we're searching. We wouldn't be doing this, we wouldn't be searching and putting all effort out there -- I think that, if the sub is located, that's a question that then the experts need to look at, what is the best course of action for recovering the sub?
 
But I think it's going to depend on that particular situation and if we encounter that.
 
QUESTION:  Sir, is it true that the British offered assistance and they were told, we don't need your assistance at this point? FREDERICK:  No, I'm not aware of that. Again, what I would tell you,
 
 though, is that the unified command is working through, working through prioritizing.
 
We know that there's equipment out there that can be brought to the scene. The unified command is working through prioritizing what equipment we need and then how we get it there. And so...
 
QUESTION:  And the French are also responding with a ship as well? 
 
FREDERICK:  Yes, that's my understanding. Correct. 
 
And I think we're in wrap. 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
FREDERICK:  Thank you. 
 
QUESTION:  Thank you, Captain.
 
ROBERT SIMPSON, U.S. COAST GUARD FIRST DISTRICT:  Thank you. I really appreciate you guys coming out today to do this portion of the brief on there. 
 
I can stay behind just to take some additional stuff that maybe wasn't answered and we can try to get some information back to you kind of a little later. 
 
QUESTION:  (OFF-MIKE) 
 
SIMPSON:  Yes.
 
QUESTION:  ... about the men and women here who are based on Boston?
 
SIMPSON:  Yes. 
 
QUESTION:  So, are they not out there? Are they just working here (OFF-MIKE) 
 
SIMPSON:  Right. 
 
So the rescue coordination center that he's talking about specifically, that's based in Boston. So the personnel that are working in the command-and-control environment, as far as building a lot of the search-and-rescue plans, sending out the information, coordinating those pieces are here.
 
The people effecting the mission, so the pilots, the air crews, all of the ships, those are based out of different areas. So our pilots, air crews are out of Elizabeth City, North Carolina. The Coast Guard cutter Sycamore, I believe, is out of Newport, Rhode Island. 
 
But they were operating already in the Arctic. So there are a number of people that are here working in a staff element, but are not physically located out in the search area, if that makes sense. 
 
QUESTION:  (OFF-MIKE)
 
SIMPSON:  It is, yes. 
 
QUESTION:  Does OceanGate have another submersible that they could try to send down?
 
SIMPSON:  I don't know. I don't know.
 
QUESTION:  It sounds like, for the most part, the staging area is moving to St. John.
 
SIMPSON:  So, I believe, yes, a lot of it into St. John, Newfoundland, right? 
 
QUESTION:  Right.
 
SIMPSON:  Yes. 
 
So, our aircraft, the C-130 aircraft, are -- they're based out of there as well. So I know there is a number of pieces going out there. Logistically, it's easier, as opposed to from here.
 
QUESTION:  So, you talked about TRANSCOM organizing the different assets available. I asked TRANSCOM. And they kicked it over to you guys.
 
SIMPSON:  OK. 
 
QUESTION:  So can you give a little bit more clarity on what kind of assets you have put in the water? I specifically asked about the CURV 21.
 
SIMPSON:  Yes.
 
QUESTION:  (OFF-MIKE) Is there one on the way? 
 
SIMPSON:  I don't know. I don't know an answer that. 
 
So I know a lot of those questions weren't -- were unanswered. And it's -- a lot of it's because we're not the right agency to be asking that. I know it's (INAUDIBLE) command, and we should be to be the ones to give the answer to you, but we want you guys to hear it from the subject matter experts.
 
QUESTION:  Right.
 
SIMPSON:  So that's our next plan is, what we want to do is give an opportunity for you all to have -- to get all of the subject matter experts we can into one location to kind of get those questions answered, to give you kind of the best thing we can do. 
 <br>[13:15:05]
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
SIMPSON:  Yes. (CROSSTALK)
 
QUESTION:  Do you anticipate in that -- in those 40 hours, when that becomes a recovery mission (OFF-MIKE) 
 
SIMPSON:  I'm sorry?
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
SIMPSON:  When?
 
QUESTION:  When those 40 hours are up that...
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
SIMPSON:  Yes. Yes.
 
QUESTION:  ... yesterday, is that the moment you shift from a search- and-rescue to a recovery operation, if you choose to do a recovery operation, given the difficulties?
 
SIMPSON:  I think it really depends on a number of factors, so anything that could change between now and then as far as information response, things like that that could change that. 
 
So it's not a hard-and-fast timer is up, time to transition. There's a lot of factors that go into it that could extend something like that. 
 
QUESTION:  What role does the oxygen, the amount of oxygen play (OFF- MIKE) with 40 hours of oxygen left, when (OFF-MIKE) 
 
SIMPSON:  I don't know. I don't know an answer to that. That's definitely outside. But we can try to get back to -- as we transition through that phase, we will have better answers for that.
 
QUESTION:  (OFF-MIKE) Like, what exactly are Coast Guard facing (OFF- MIKE)
 
SIMPSON:  So, the weather...
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
QUESTION:  ... water.
 
SIMPSON:  Well, I was -- so, actually, I have -- I believe the weather on scene today was five-to-six-foot seas.
 
QUESTION:  What does that mean? Sorry, like the wave?
 
SIMPSON:  So, wave height five to six feet. I believe it was 15-knot winds. Visibility was very foggy yesterday with very little nose visibility, but was increasing today. And they were expecting better -- in much better conditions from an aerial search perspective. 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
QUESTION:  ... today?
 
SIMPSON:  Yes.
 
QUESTION:  And it's cleared in terms of visibility?
 
SIMPSON:  Yes.
 
QUESTION:  High winds persist or...
 
SIMPSON:  It's 15-knot winds. So, in terms -- it's not -- it's about average out there, right? 
 
QUESTION:  How long would it take a typical Coast Guard vessel from the U.S. or, for that matter, from Newfoundland to get on site if they're running at maximum speed?
 
SIMPSON:  That depends on the cutter itself or the ship itself, because they all have different speeds. 
 
QUESTION:  Yes.
 
Do you have an average, just so we have a feel for how long it would take to get there?
 
SIMPSON:  Well, depending on where they're coming from, it could be a matter of two days, up to four to five days. It just depends on where they would be deploying from. 
 
So...
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
QUESTION:  ... Newfoundland, for example?
 
SIMPSON:  I don't know. We don't have any ships up in there, so I don't know. I don't have an answer to that. 
 
The Canadian -- we're trying to find out more information on the Canadian vessels that are assisting on there, sort of what their capability speeds are. I just don't have an answer for you on that right now. 
 
QUESTION:  Does the Coast Guard have a line on a piece of equipment that is capable of going down to the Titanic?
 
SIMPSON:  The Coast Guard specifically, no. 
 
This type of a salvage operation in our expertise as an organization is...
 
QUESTION:  No, in terms of private companies. 
 
SIMPSON:  Yes.
 
QUESTION:  Have you reached...
 
(CROSSTALK) 
 
SIMPSON:  So, that's all part of the conversations of the unified command, to find out what capabilities are out there and explore all avenues that they can.
 
QUESTION:  You're looking at that now?
 
QUESTION:  (OFF-MIKE)
 
SIMPSON:  We just haven't received any yet at this point. 
 
QUESTION:  And you don't expect (OFF-MIKE) 
 
SIMPSON:  We do. We do expect to get some.
 
Like I said, we do have some graphics that we're trying to look to send out this afternoon, as well as we have reached out to the aircraft crews to get footage from them, now, I know, with the ROVs that are on scene today, so there just hasn't been any before. 
 
So we've -- are requesting out there to try and see what we can get to go through that and try to make that available to you all. 
 
QUESTION:  Sir, even images from the command center would be awesome.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
SIMPSON:  What's that?
 
QUESTION:  If the submersible was discovered on the bottom of the ocean right now, right now, there are no assets on scene capable of retrieving it. Is that correct?
 
SIMPSON:  I don't have an -- I don't know. I don't have an answer to that.
 
QUESTION:  The Coast Guard does not have the asset (OFF-MIKE) right now, correct?
 
SIMPSON:  The Coast Guard assets itself, no, we do not have any Coast Guard cutters on scene. 
 
QUESTION:  (OFF-MIKE) 
 
SIMPSON:  No. So the research vessels, I just don't know what the capabilities are at -- for that.
 
QUESTION:  Do you think it's looking pretty unrealistic that it has made its way to the surface and it's waiting to be spotted? Because you have done all of these aerial searches. Are you quite confident it's in the water?
 
SIMPSON:  That's why we have both types of assets, because we don't want to exhaust one possibility in place of another. 
 
So we don't want to rule out that it is on the surface. QUESTION:  The likely...
 
SIMPSON:  And the way that our crews train, this is the environment they train in. They're specialized in being able to see these things from the air.
 
So they have given everything that they have to it. And if it's on the surface, we're fairly certain that we would be able to find it. 
 
QUESTION:  You would have by now? 
 
SIMPSON:  No, that we will find it if it is on the surface. 
 
QUESTION:  Do you think it's more likely (OFF-MIKE)
 
SIMPSON:  It's impossible to say. 
 
QUESTION:  Can I just ask you to -- I realize this may be challenging. You may not have the answer. 
 
SIMPSON:  Yes.
 
QUESTION:  But we're trying to get a sense of how far away the nearest naval asset would be that has that lift capability, salvage capability. 
 
Is it coming from North Carolina, from Florida, from Boston? Any sense -- can you give us any idea of how far away it might be? 
 
SIMPSON:  Yes, I don't have an answer to that, yes. 
 <br>[13:20:00]
 
QUESTION:  (OFF-MIKE) 
 
SIMPSON:  From the research vessel?
 
QUESTION:  The Titan (OFF-MIKE) 
 
SIMPSON:  Yes. Oh, communicating with them? 
 
QUESTION:  Yes.
 
SIMPSON:  No, I don't have specifics on technology on the board. 
 
QUESTION:  (OFF-MIKE) 
 
SIMPSON:  Not to my knowledge. 
 
QUESTION:  (OFF-MIKE) 
 
SIMPSON:  Absolutely. So, yes, they're part of the unified command in here, so we're all making decisions together. 
 
QUESTION:  (OFF-MIKE) 
 
SIMPSON:  I don't know. But, if they do, it's definitely being discussed, as far as their capabilities.
 
QUESTION:  (OFF-MIKE) 
 
SIMPSON:  I don't understand.
 
QUESTION:  (OFF-MIKE)
 
SIMPSON:  That's just the biggest part of the challenge of all of this, is trying to understand how the capabilities are working together, how they would do it, the technical aspect of that.
 
QUESTION:  (OFF-MIKE) 
 
SIMPSON:  I think it was clearly stated with Captain Frederick on there.
 
QUESTION:  Can you -- could we ask, could you just describe the crush depth here? We're talking about 400 times, as I understand it, what we all experience at sea level. 
 
What can that do to a vessel? 
 
SIMPSON:  I can't. I can't speak to the scientific side of that. Again, this is just more or less trying to get some background information for you guys on there. 
 
I don't have any of that information on that. 
 
QUESTION:  Can tell you about what the (OFF-MIKE)
 
SIMPSON:  I don't know that.
 
QUESTION:  (OFF-MIKE)
 
SIMPSON:  And that would be a great question that we could try to get answered for you with that subject matter expert discussion that we talked about for the -- to get an opportunity for you guys to ask that question, because it'd be much more important and realistic for somebody within that community, part of the command, that would be able to answer that question a lot clearer than anything I would be able to. 
 
So, I don't know.
 
QUESTION:  (OFF-MIKE) 
 
SIMPSON:  So, we do have a press release that's going to be going out shortly with the graphics we talked about, probably similar information to what was passed today. 
 
If any new information comes up, we will update that. But I think, ideally, we'd be putting out press releases daily. And we'd look at probably doing another briefing tomorrow. 
 
QUESTION:  Can I just ask you one last...
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
SIMPSON:  Sorry. (INAUDIBLE) I don't know.
 
QUESTION:  Could you just reiterate for us just how big of an urgency is this with the Coast Guard, how big of a priority? Do you prioritize these things? 
 
In other words, do you classify them as priority red, one, two, three? How big of a priority is this? 
 
SIMPSON:  This operation is our top priority right now within the district.
 
We have every available asset that we can that's to this that we can dedicate to it on this. That's why we are spending so much time and energy trying to coordinate really this enormous response effort to truly understand the scale of how far away this truly is and in the context of the types of assets that we can get out there over something that's that enormous, something larger than the state of Connecticut, into perspective of what is available to be able to search in those kind of conditions so far offshore.
 
Understanding, 900 miles looks like -- is an enormous amount of distance. 
 
QUESTION:  Can I just also (OFF-MIKE). Is a deep sea rescue realistic, and what would that look like?
 
SIMPSON:  I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what it would look like.
 
Realistic, and -- and that's all part of the conversation of the unified command. They're looking at doing everything that they can to find out the options that are available. 
 
QUESTION:  Thank you, sir.
 
QUESTION:  And family members have indicated that there are five people on board. 
 
Is there an official manifest or log saying exactly who is on that vessel?
 
SIMPSON:  There is on there. 
 
QUESTION:  Will that be released publicly?
 
SIMPSON:  So, the -- not until all the next of kin notifications have been completed through that process can we release names in that way. 
 
I know that some have gotten out, but they have not been through us. 
 
QUESTION:  OK. 
 
QUESTION:  Thank you so much. 
 
SIMPSON:  Thank you. I really appreciate your time today. Thank you. 
 
And we will send out an update when the next advisory or adviser will be out for you guys. 
 
KEILAR:  All right, we were listening there to Robert Simpson. He is the assistant public affairs officer for the Coast Guard district that is based there out of Boston. 
 
I want to bring in our Jason Carroll, who is there at that press conference that has just wrapped up.
 
Listening to him as well, as to Jamie Frederick with the Coast Guard as well, one of the response coordinators here, I think, Jason, you really just get a sense of how difficult this task is. 
 
This is as if they are looking not just for a needle in a haystack, but a needle in a haystack that is 370 nautical miles from the nearest port, with conditions in a way of being blindfolded and underwater. There is very little visibility above the water and certainly next to nothing beneath the water. 
 <br>[13:25:22]
 
JASON CARROLL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Right, Brianna. They definitely have some challenges ahead of them. 
 
Some of the key items I want to tick through here from the briefing, which is now just now beginning to wrap up, they called it a unique operation, as you were saying, a challenging operation. 
 
Some of the headlines here, about 40 hours of breathable oxygen that is left on board that submersible, just 40 hours. And when I asked Captain Frederick here, I said, even if you were able to get the necessary equipment to pull that submarine out of the water at this time, if you had it right there on the surface, would 40 hours be enough to conduct that type of rescue operation? 
 
And he said he couldn't answer that question at this time. Also, Brianna, he had indicated that the Deep Energy vessel has what is called an ROV unit that is currently right now conducting a search in the area where the submersible went down.
 
ROV unit, that's a remotely operated vehicle that's operated, again, remotely. Think of it as some sort of a mechanical underwater vehicle that can be operated where they can search in the area. It has a camera on board, so it can try to see what it can, again, in the immediate area where the submersible went down and where the ship lost contact with it. 
 
But, again, very sobering to hear that just now at this point, some 40 hours of oxygen left. And, repeatedly, the question was asked, I know that you have got assets that are on their way, in some cases, still 48 hours-plus away from the area, the types of -- the types of assets that would be needed to lift a submersible at great depths up from that, from those great depths, to the surface, still hours and hours away, and at this point, just 40 hours of breathable oxygen that is left. 
 
One final point I also want to bring up here is that they have indicated that, at some point later on today, they're going to be releasing a graphic of a grid of the search area that they that they have done in this remote area of the Atlantic to show specifically where the air units have been searching, where the vessels at sea level have been searching to try to get sort of -- some sort of a grid together to give us a visual of that. 
 
But now just getting all these updates now from this Coast Guard, which is -- Coast Guard briefing, which has now just wrapped up -- Brianna. 
 
KEILAR:  Yes. 
 
So, Jason, let's talk about what is there and what's on the way. You mentioned, obviously, that Deep Energy ship, which has the camera capability. There are sonar buoys that have been set up as they're looking for something.
 
We know that, in general, the U.S. and the Canadian Coast Guard are involved here. And there have been these reconnaissance aircraft that are flying over trying to find something. But, again, the conditions are very difficult. 
 
It sounds like, this evening, they may be getting some more Canadian Coast Guard vessels in the area. But it's sort of difficult to determine what the capabilities will be and how that's really going to help them further the search here. 
 
CARROLL:  Yes, it's very difficult, very challenging, because not only are you dealing with, as you say, the needle in the haystack analogy, but you're also dealing with the weather. 
 
I mean, yesterday, it was foggier. Today, it's looking a little better, winds at five to six -- winds are at a point where they say it's manageable at this point. 
 
KEILAR:  Yes.
 
CARROLL:  So there is still so much more that they're having to deal with here. And, again, they have a number of assets that are in the area. They have got C-130s that are in the air, searching on the off- chance that this submersible has surfaced and is in the area. 
 
But, once again, the thing that really struck many of us here is that 40-hour-or-so window now that they're looking at, because this is what these five people on board have left to breathe, just 40 hours, assets still heading into the area. Again, you have got that ROV that's right now in the area searching beneath the water where the submersible went down. 
 
But, again, now they're just looking at about 40 hours of breathable air -- Brianna. 
 
KEILAR:  Yes. And that is going to be the number, as these odds are against them. But as we just heard the Coast Guard making clear, they are going to keep searching. They wouldn't be searching if they didn't think there was some chance here at some sort of rescue. 
 
So, hopefully, we're going to maybe hear some signs of progress as we continue to monitor this story. 
 
Jason Carroll live for us in Boston, where we just heard the Coast Guard updating reporters on the situation there -- Boris.
 
BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN HOST:  We are going to stay on top of this story, this race against time, including what it's like to be inside a submersible like this one.
