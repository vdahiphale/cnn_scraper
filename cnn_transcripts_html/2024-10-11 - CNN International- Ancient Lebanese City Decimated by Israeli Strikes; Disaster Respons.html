(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BECKY ANDERSON, CNN HOST, CONNECT THE WORLD: Well, you are looking at live pictures of Beirut, where Israeli air strikes on a densely populated 
 
 neighborhood killed 22 people last night. It is now 04:00 p.m. there, it is 05:00 p.m. here in Abu Dhabi, you're watching "Connect the World" with me 
 
 Becky Anderson.
 
Also, over the next two hours, Iran's President and Vladimir Putin meeting today as Iran awaits Israel's response to its recent missile attack. The 
 
 United Arab Emirates calls on the United States to step in as regional war escalates. And the winner of the 2024 Nobel Peace Prize is an organization 
 
 that campaigns for a world free of nuclear weapons. More on that is coming up.
 
Well, the stock market in New York will open about 30 minutes from now, and if the futures markets are anything to go by, indicating a mixed start to 
 
 the trading day. We begin with fast moving developments in this region in the past few hours, Israel says it killed a Hezbollah commander as part of 
 
 its operation in Southern Lebanon.
 
This as the IDF pushes ahead with strikes on the Lebanese capital Beirut. Lebanese authorities say at least 22 people killed in a densely populated 
 
 neighborhood on Thursday night. Let me get you straight to Beirut and CNN's Ben Wedeman. Ben, in the wake of Wednesday night's strike on a busy area in 
 
 the center of Beirut. What or who do we understand the Israelis were targeting and why?
 
BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, we saw claims in Israeli media, Becky, that they were targeting Wafiq Safa, who was the 
 
 coordination, the senior coordination official for Hezbollah, basically a diplomat for the group.
 
However, a Hezbollah source told us that he survived the strikes. And just a few moments ago, there were some Hezbollah bloc members of parliament in 
 
 on TV, live on TV, insisting that in neither of the two buildings that were struck were there any Hezbollah leaders.
 
Now, those two buildings struck were significant because they're just a few of the strikes that have happened outside the southern suburbs, which are 
 
 behind me. One of the buildings struck was a nine -- eight story building. Just one floor was hit, definitely the telltale signs of a targeted 
 
 assassination.
 
However, the other building, four floors are in a very crowded residential area, the building totally collapsed. And this is an area, sort of a mixed 
 
 Sunni, Shiite area, to which many people had fled because they assumed, because it was within Beirut city limits, very much near the heart of the 
 
 city, that they might be safe.
 
But clearly not with 22 dead and 117 wounded, and we understand that they are still digging through the rubble, looking for either bodies or 
 
 survivors. And Becky, we just actually arrived in Beirut. We were entire in the South. That's the city, very much on the front lines.
 
Just before we were leaving, Israeli jets were flying overhead, breaking the sound barrier. We spent some time in that city, and found that most 
 
 inhabitants, because of the bombing, because of Israeli evacuation orders had left, but there are still a stubborn handful still hanging on.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
WEDEMAN (voice-over): You have to walk carefully through the rubble, all that remains of three buildings and Tyre demolished by Israeli bombs. 
 
 Neighbors say the bombing killed at least five people, including women and children.
 
WEDEMAN: The Arabic spokesman for the Israeli military will occasionally, over Twitter or X put out evacuation orders for specific buildings in 
 
 Beirut before they're struck here in Tyre. There have been no warnings.
 
WEDEMAN (voice-over): For 35 years Baha (ph) has run a small clothing shop next door, now in shambles. History is repeating itself she says, a three-
 
 story building fell over our heads during the 1982 Israeli invasion. This ancient city is just 12 miles or 19 kilometers from the border with Israel. 
 
 Most of the residents have fled north.
 <br>[09:05:00]
 
Those who stayed behind live under constant threat. It was terrifying. The missile hit and it collapsed, says 70-year-old Megdad (ph) describing 
 
 another Israeli strike that destroyed multiple homes in Tyre's old city. For more than half a century, every generation has witnessed destruction 
 
 and death.
 
We're used to it says Megdad's (ph) neighbor Yousef (ph), we're used to wars. We've seen wars. Going back to the days of the Phoenicians, Tyre has 
 
 looked to the sea now a forbidden zone. Israel has warned people to stay off the beaches and fishermen not to take their boats out.
 
So, in Tyre's port, Abu Ibrahim sits and smokes his water pipe. We go to sea so we can eat, he tells me, now we can't. How can we eat? An old man 
 
 deprived of his sea.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
WEDEMAN (on camera): And just down the coast from Tyre we could see Ras-an- Nakura, which is the cape that marks the border between Israel and Lebanon. And there, of course, is the headquarters of the United Nations Interim 
 
 Force for Lebanon, otherwise known as UNIFIL.
 
We saw smoke rising from that area that headquarters has been struck by Israeli forces, causing a diplomatic uproar with protests from the U.N., 
 
 from Italy and Indonesia, two of whose peacekeepers have been wounded, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: The caretaker Prime Minister in Lebanon calling today for a full and immediate ceasefire. Any evidence that that call will be supported that 
 
 this is likely to stop any time soon? What's the end game here, as far as Israel is concerned, is it clear?
 
WEDEMAN: It's not at all clear. We do know that, for instance, that Hezbollah has, and we just heard it on television again, empowered Nabih 
 
 Barry, who is the speaker of parliament here, who is the intermediary between Hezbollah and the United States to work on ceasefire efforts, so 
 
 he's the man, sort of spearheading it.
 
But it takes several to tango in this part of the world. And as we heard from the UAE, it's time for the Americans to step in, because the feeling 
 
 is the Americans talk a lot about trying to stabilize the situation, reach a cease fire, but they're speaking out of two sides of their mouth.
 
On the one hand, they're calling for diplomacy, cease fire, so on and so forth. On the other, they don't really seem to be doing much in terms of 
 
 restraining their Israeli allies, and they're certainly not doing anything to cut off the supply of weapons, which of course, are why there is so much 
 
 destruction and death in Lebanon and Gaza over the last year, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Ben Wedeman is on the ground in Beirut. Appreciate your reporting, Ben and the voices that we have heard from Tyre today as well. 
 
 Thank you. Well, Russian President Vladimir Putin meeting with his Iranian counterpart a short time ago, saying that the two share a very close 
 
 worldview.
 
It comes as the region braces for Israel's response to Iran's recent missile attack, an official says -- tells CNN that the Israeli Security 
 
 Cabinet has not yet reached a decision on how it will respond, what its strikes will look like, or its action against Iran will look like.
 
But ahead of any possible retaliation, Iran's Foreign Minister visited Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, it's part of a tour of this region aiming to 
 
 gain support from Gulf Arab states. Meantime, a regional diplomat here in the UAE tells me that the UAE will not allow its airspace to be used for 
 
 any attack against Iran.
 
Well, CNN's Fred Pleitgen is following this all for us. He's on the ground, as he has been now for a number of days in Iran's capital, and joins us 
 
 now. The Presidents of Russia and Iran meeting for the first time. Of course, this is a relatively new Iranian President. And they share it is 
 
 reported, a similar world view, by which they mean what very specifically at this point?
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, both of them have actually said that it was quite interesting, because you're 
 
 absolutely right. The first time that Vladimir Putin and Masoud Pezeshkian have met face to face there at that larger conference that's taking place 
 
 in Turkmenistan. Pezeshkian already went to Turkmenistan yesterday.
 <br>[09:10:00]
 
And both of them said that they share similar views of world events. Obviously, as far as the Russians are concerned, those are the expanding 
 
 ties between Russia and Iran. Vladimir Putin spoke about ties in the economic sphere. Very often spoke about the BRICS group of nations.
 
But then also, of course, the Russians in the past have said that they believe that there will be deepening ties and closer cooperation with Iran, 
 
 as they put it, in the military technical sphere as well. And that, of course, is something that has been very bad news for both the United States 
 
 and for Ukraine.
 
As both of those countries have accused Iran of giving Russia both drones, those Shahed drones that are used in the war in Ukraine, but then also, 
 
 very recently, those short-range ballistic missiles, the Iranians still continue to deny that that ever happened. But certainly, the United States 
 
 and Ukraine say that it does, and it is happening.
 
And the Iranians, for their part, Masoud Pezeshkian on the international stage, still fairly new, as you put it, Becky, also said that he believes 
 
 that Russia and Iran see eye to eye on those things. There was one interesting thing that we picked out. He also said he believes that Russia 
 
 and Iran at this juncture, need to support each other on the international stage.
 
The Iranians, of course, speaking about the current situation that they are in right now, with this standoff that they have with Israel, bracing for 
 
 that possible Israeli response, the missile attack by Iran on Israeli territory last week, and at the same time, the threat here in the middle 
 
 east of all of this expanding into a wider confrontation that, in the end, could pit both the Iranians and the U.S. against one another, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Yeah, there are real grave concerns around the region that this will -- these risks escalating further. A U.S. official who spoke to CNN 
 
 told us that the gap between American and Israeli positions on how to respond to Iran is narrowing. Now we can only hypothesize at this point 
 
 about what that action might look like.
 
We certainly know from the Biden Administration that the U.S. President is not keen on supporting either a strike on the nuclear facilities or on the 
 
 oil installations, but we really do not understand at this point, and have no detail on what a strike might look like. Does it feel like we are closer 
 
 to a response?
 
And when you talk to people today, I know you've been out and about, it's Friday prayers today. What's the sense there of how risky things are 
 
 getting?
 
PLEITGEN: Well, I think it certainly does feel here in the region as though a response by the Israelis is closer. I think some people were actually 
 
 quite surprised when they learned today, as sources had told a CNN there inside Israel that apparently that cabinet has not yet come to a conclusion 
 
 of what exactly that strike is going to look like.
 
And I think that a lot of people here on the ground and certainly Iranian officials, have been following very closely some of the things that they've 
 
 heard from the Biden Administration. Of course, the President himself saying that the U.S. would not support any strikes on Iran's nuclear 
 
 facilities, and at the same time, also on the oil and gas infrastructure as well.
 
What we're hearing from Iran here is very tough talk, and you're absolutely right. We were at the Friday prayers earlier today, and the sermons there 
 
 really centered around the standoff with Israel, and of course, also the recent killing of Hezbollah Leader Hassan Nasrallah and prayer goes there 
 
 also gave a clear warning to Israel. Let's listen to some of what they had to say.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They will see a very harsh response from the IRGC, the army and the people of Iran be sure that this will happen.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Israel has experienced this before, and if they repeat this experience, they will definitely be destroyed.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They are brutally overseeing the bloodshed of innocent children which is taking place, and both America and Israel have a share in 
 
 this crime. They should overthrow the leadership of their countries.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
PLEITGEN: I think it really shows how dangerous the situation is here in the Middle East right now, again, with the Iranians saying that if there is 
 
 a strike by the Israelis, there will be a response from the Iranians. And they have said that response could very well be crushing, as they put it, 
 
 Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Fred, it's good to have you. Fred is in Tehran. We are across the region, and we will do more on this story as we move through the next 
 
 couple of hours. Thank you. I want to get to the aftermath of the second major hurricane to hit the U.S. in two weeks.
 
The death toll from Hurricane Milton has now risen to at least 16, all of them in Florida. Crews still searching for missing people saying that they 
 
 may be trapped by floodwaters. Some vulnerable people who thought they were safe found themselves trapped as the water level rose. CNN's Isabel Rosales 
 
 reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's terrible.
 <br>[09:15:00]
 
ISABEL ROSALES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: -- terrifying.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That water was so cold.
 
ROSALES (voice-over): Theresa (ph) and over 100 other residents at a Hillsborough County assisted living facility awoke to waste high water in 
 
 the middle of the night.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The chairs were just floating. Couches were floating. Everything was floating.
 
ROSALES (voice-over): This employee stunned by the flooding, telling CNN they thought they were safe because the facility is not in an evacuation 
 
 zone.
 
ROSALES: Just rainfall reaching to levels they never anticipated. You expect this in the Gulf. You expect this in the bay, not in areas inland 
 
 like this.
 
ROSALES (voice-over): But storm surge isn't the culprit. Instead, it was all the torrential rainfall leading to flash flooding.
 
SHERIFF CHAD CHRONISTER, HILLSBOROUGH COUNTY, FLORIDA: They were literally living in four to five feet of water, and these are individuals that can't 
 
 walk.
 
ROSALES (voice-over): By two in the morning. It was an emergency, and residents needed out, some of them on oxygen.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It was quite scary, because we had to think on our feet, because obviously it's last minute.
 
ROSALES (voice-over): Residents describe water pouring through air conditioning units, leaving them terrified.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You could literally hear that thing coming around the corner, and it just sounded like it was going to take the building with it.
 
ROSALES (voice-over): And in a twist, the facility houses more residents than normal, residents who had evacuated from the south in Manatee County, 
 
 expecting they would be safe here.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Everybody was sitting in the cold waters. Everyone was getting frustrated, upset.
 
ROSALES (voice-over): They waited for hours, cold, scared, and some of them without any shoes until it was safe for deputies to get to them. One by 
 
 one, first responders loaded them into a school bus off to an elementary school, now a makeshift shelter for these unexpected guests.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON: Well, still to come the horrors of war inspiring this year's Nobel committee selection as survivors of the atomic bombs dropped on Japan 
 
 are honored with the Peace Prize. Their story is just ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: Of Japanese atomic bomb survivors from Hiroshima and Nagasaki has been awarded this year's Nobel Peace Prize. The grassroots organization 
 
 known as Nihon Hidankyo was recognized for its efforts to help rid the world of nuclear weapons.
 
Now, over decades, this group has collected thousands of witnesses accounts and sends annual delegations to the U.N. and other peace conferences 
 
 pressing for nuclear disarmament. Well, CNN's Hanako Montgomery has very latest live from Tokyo and tell us more. What do we know about this 
 
 grassroots organization and the work that they do?
 
HANAKO MONTGOMERY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, Becky, this grassroots organization, Nihon Hidankyo, as you mentioned, is comprised of survivors 
 
 from the atomic bombs dropped on Japan during World War Two by the United States.
 <br>[09:20:00]
 
So, these survivors, also known as Hibakusha in Japanese, really advocate for the elimination of nuclear weapons around the globe, and their win is 
 
 actually very important, not just for Japan, but really for the entire world as well. After decades of nuclear anxiety during the Cold War, we're 
 
 seeing nuclear weapons once again, causing a lot of unease, especially amid the wars in Ukraine and also in the Middle East.
 
Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly warned the West that it could use its nuclear weapons if the United States and its allies get too 
 
 involved in the war in Ukraine. And meanwhile, Israel, which is believed to have its own nuclear weapons, is trading fire with Iran, a country that is 
 
 enriching its uranium and is believed to have the capabilities of developing its own nuclear arms.
 
Even some of Japan's neighbors, like North Korea, for example, are rapidly developing their nuclear weapons. So really the works of these 
 
 organizations, for instance, like Nihon Hidankyo, is extremely relevant and important, especially as they speak from experience, these survivors have 
 
 lived through and have literally seen just how devastating and destructive these atomic bombs can be.
 
Japan is the only country to have ever experienced atomic bombs during wartime, and it completely decimated entire towns, neighborhoods, people's 
 
 lives, their families. So even though some of these Hibakusha are now getting old and are dying, Becky. They do hope that their message of 
 
 nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation continues to live on, generation to generation, even after they're long gone, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Yeah, it's good to have you. Hanako, thank you. When awarding the prize, the Nobel Committee highlighted the important work and testimony of 
 
 these atomic bomb survivors, saying, quote, they help us to describe the indescribable, to think the unthinkable, and who somehow grasp the 
 
 incomprehensible pain and suffering caused by nuclear weapons.
 
We're joined now by the Chair of the Norwegian Noble Committee, Jorgen Watne Frydnes, joining us now. Thank you. How did you and the Nobel 
 
 Committee make this final selection. And why did you end up choosing this organization in 2024?
 
JORGEN WATNE FRYDNES, CHAIR OF THE NORWEGIAN NOBEL COMMITTEE: First, thank you for having me. In the year of 2024 where we see as you just said, that 
 
 the nuclear threat is on the rise. There are nuclear threats being made regularly to use nuclear weapons. That is a challenge for what we call the 
 
 nuclear taboo. This strong international norm stigmatizing nuclear weapons as morally unacceptable.
 
But if this norm is under pressure and is being broken, that would be devastating for mankind. So, in this particular year, we find it 
 
 appropriate and important to highlight the important role of the Hibakusha, the survivors of the atomic attacks in 1945, because they have through 
 
 seven decades, but not least to this day, highlighted their testimonies, highlighted their pain and suffering, and by doing so, creating and 
 
 maintaining this nuclear taboo.
 
ANDERSON: And the co-chair of the organization that won the award this year broke down in tears at a press conference after the award was announced. He 
 
 compared the situation in Gaza to what Japan faced at the end of World War Two, saying this, and I just want our viewers to hear this quote.
 
In Gaza, bleeding children are being held by their parents. It's like in Japan 80 years ago. I wonder, to your mind and to the mind of the jury, how 
 
 the testimony of these survivors can and should be relevant today. And what sort of power you believe the Peace Prize can or should wield in 2024?
 
FRYDNES: Well, it is the testimonies which is the important aspect of their work in creating and maintaining the international global norm against the 
 
 use of nuclear weapons, particularly because they create the human face of why these weapons should not be tolerated?
 <br>[09:25:00]
 
Why these weapons are morally unacceptable? And that is important for all of humankind. It's of course, important in the specific regions of the 
 
 world where nuclear threats are being made, but nuclear war in 2024 could result to millions of people losing their lives. It could mean catastrophic 
 
 consequences for our climate. So, this is also a price that addresses how nuclear weapons will affect all of mankind.
 
ANDERSON: And certainly, provides a platform for the narrative of nuclear disarmament. But I have to say, the Nobel Peace Prize this year is awarded 
 
 as wars rage. You look around the region that I am in, we think about the Russia's war on Ukraine and in so many other parts of the world.
 
And you have to ask yourself whether the prospect of peace today in 2024, isn't dimmer than it's been for years? And there are voices who suggested 
 
 that perhaps the noble committee should not award a Peace Prize this year. Can I just ask you whether the committee discussed that as an option?
 
FRYDNES: The Norwegian Nobel Committee discuss every year if we should give out the price or not. That is the starting point of the discussions when 
 
 the dark skies, is gathering on the horizon, when there are conflicts on many of our continents. We believe that it's even more important to 
 
 highlight those who fight for peace, those who are doing a difference.
 
And this years with the Nihon Hidankyo and the Hiroshima and Nagasaki survivors, we find it very relevant to say for decades they have been 
 
 telling their stories. They have been improving and maintaining the nuclear taboo, the norm against the use of these weapons, and which will be of the 
 
 greatest benefit to humankind. So, I think it's more important than ever to find those who are in the work of making peace.
 
ANDERSON: Yeah. And that is an argument that it is more important than ever that in 2024. We discuss and applaud those who have spent an entire 
 
 lifetime pursuing peace. Thank you for joining us. It's been extremely good to have you on. Well, still to come with Kamala Harris and Donald Trump in 
 
 a virtual dead heat in the polls, Harris campaign turning to a familiar face for a boost. More on this after this short break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:30:00]
 
ANDERSON: Right. You're watching "Connect the World". I'm Becky Anderson in Abu Dhabi. Welcome back. Let's do some U.S. politics for you and Former 
 
 U.S. President Barack Obama hit the campaign trail for Kamala Harris in Pennsylvania on Thursday, calling her a leader who has spent her life 
 
 fighting on behalf of Americans.
 
His appearance comes as polls show Harris and Donald Trump locked in an extremely tight race for president with just 25 days to go until the 
 
 election. In Pittsburgh, Obama headlined a rally delivering a fiery speech attacking Trump's character. Have a listen to part of what he said.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BARACK OBAMA, 44TH U.S. PRESIDENT: When Donald Trump lies or cheats or shows utter disregard for our Constitution, when he calls POWs losers or 
 
 fellow citizens vermin. People make excuses for it. They think it's OK.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: While Obama was making his pitch for Harris, Donald Trump himself was in Detroit, Michigan, trying to appeal to swing voters in what is a key 
 
 battleground state. At one point, he slammed the very city where he was speaking.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, we're developing nation too. Just take a look at Detroit. Detroit's a 
 
 developing, Detroit's a developing area. Hell of a lot more than most places in China, the whole country is going to be like you want to know the 
 
 truth, it will be like Detroit. Our whole country will end up being like Detroit, if she's your president.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: All right. Well, let's discuss this. Kristen Holmes joining us now from Aurora in Colorado, where Donald Trump will speak to supporters 
 
 later today. Ahead of that in Detroit, insulting a city while he was there. What's the strategy for this if at all?
 
KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Becky, I don't think there's a strategy in him insulting Detroit while he's there. We often hear 
 
 him speak off the cuff like this and insult the very places that he's going. I mean, one perfect example of that is earlier this year, before the 
 
 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.
 
He attacked the City of Milwaukee, insulting it. His team did everything they could to try and scramble and clean that up, but this is just Donald 
 
 Trump speaking without a teleprompter and saying things that are on his mind but that don't necessarily benefit him politically.
 
Now part of what he was saying, there is something that we expect to hear him say today in war Colorado, which is a fear-based messaging, essentially 
 
 talking about Detroit as though it is in decline, as though there is this fear around the economy there that could lead to overall destruction in the 
 
 United States if she is president.
 
We expect to hear that here except for in the vein of immigration, not in terms of the economy. Keep in mind, Colorado itself is a solidly blue 
 
 state. This is not a state which he is visiting to try and court swing voters, although you might be surprised to hear that when you see the line 
 
 behind me and there are hundreds of people who are here to see them in this state.
 
However, the strategy is more a chance for Donald Trump to continue using this largely false narrative around immigration. The fact that he has said 
 
 Aurora, Colorado is a city that has been quote unquote overtaken by Venezuelan gangs. Now, just to be clear, we have spoken to the governor of 
 
 the state.
 
We have talked to state officials who all say that, that is not true. In fact, one state official saying that he hoped that this video, excuse me, 
 
 this appearance here in Aurora, shined a light on the fact that the city was not overtaken by gangs. But when you talk about that fear-based 
 
 messaging, there are many who believe that it is working.
 
And you talked about those close polls, you said how it really seems to be a neck and neck race, both campaigns believe that so, if that is the case, 
 
 you have to keep in mind that his campaign might be right. A lot of this messaging is working on voters ahead of November, and they believe that 
 
 he's going to continue to double down on it, because they think it could help propel him to the White House in November.
 
ANDERSON: We know that there are what, six odd key swing states, Pennsylvania is One of those. Obama was there in Pittsburgh, speaking to. 
 
 What will, effectively, I'm sure, have been, you know, an audience of Democrats? It was a pretty fiery speech and pretty personal, and some real 
 
 attacks against Donald Trump. And perhaps you would expect that, who's he talking to?
 <br>[09:35:00]
 
What's the point of wheeling Barack Obama out at this point? And what's the, what's the constituency that the Harris campaign and the Democrats 
 
 believe he can make a difference with?
 
HOLMES: Well, I mean, one of the reasons that you would roll out President Barack Obama is because of the fact that he still has the star power that 
 
 he had when he was in office. He is immensely popular within the Democratic Party, but it also goes to show you there might be some issues that the 
 
 Kamala Harris campaign has, particularly with turning out base voters.
 
Now, the directive that Obama made yesterday when he was on the campaign trail for Kamala Harris was really aimed at men. And in particular, one 
 
 stop black men, they have had an increasing issue with men across the board, coming to vote for Kamala Harris.
 
One of the things that Obama said yesterday was the fact that he believed that the reason people weren't coming out to vote, the same people who 
 
 voted for him coming out to vote for Kamala Harris, was because perhaps she was a woman telling people to get over it, to show up at the polls.
 
At one point, he also took credit for the economy. Obviously, as we know, one of the key issues this election cycle is the economy. And Donald Trump 
 
 polls ahead of Kamala Harris when it comes to dealing with the economy. Barack Obama said you might remember that he had a good economy when he was 
 
 in office, but I'll remind you that he inherited my good economy.
 
That is where that came from trying to then connect himself to Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party. But it goes to show you, and this is 
 
 something we've heard from political operatives, that there might be an issue with Kamala Harris actually reaching out and touching her base 
 
 voters.
 
That is something that Donald Trump doesn't have a problem with. His base is always going to show up, but they want to see more minority voters, in 
 
 particular, black voters and black men voters show up for her in the polls. They think that will help her and propel her to the White House in 
 
 November.
 
ANDERSON: Good to have you. Thank you. Well, still ahead, a major fine for a major bank accused of laundering money for drug cartels. Details on that 
 
 up next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: TV Bank will pay a whopping $3 billion in fines to settle charges that it was used by drug cartels to launder money. U.S. officials say the 
 
 bank's financial surveillance was so poor that more than 90 percent of its transactions went unmonitored for more than six years.
 
Well as a result, three money laundering networks transferred close to $700 million through the bank, which is based in Canada with large operations in 
 
 the United States. CNN's Matt Egan is here. Just how significant is this decision. Certainly, the sum of money sounds huge.
 
MATT EGAN, CNN REPORTER: Yeah, it is, Becky.
 <br>[09:40:00]
 
And these are stunning allegations against one of the biggest banks operating in America, and really one of the biggest banks on the planet. 
 
 U.S. officials allege that TD Bank failed to properly monitor $18 trillion worth of customer activity over the span of six years, and that failure 
 
 allowed three money laundering networks to take advantage.
 
And some of the specific allegations laid out here by prosecutors and regulators, they read like something taken out of an episode of Breaking 
 
 Bad, in one particular episode, Prosecutors allege that someone that TD Bank employees knew as David was able to move a mill over, sorry, half a 
 
 billion, half of a billion dollars of illicit funds through the bank by bribing bank employees with tens of thousands of dollars of gift cards.
 
And at one point, prosecutors say that this individual named, known as David, he was able to get a million dollars' worth of official bank checks
