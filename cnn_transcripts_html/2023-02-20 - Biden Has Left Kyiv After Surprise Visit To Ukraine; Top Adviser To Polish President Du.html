KIRA RUDIK, UKRAINIAN PARLIAMENT (via Webex by Cisco: We still do have the curfew and the energy outages and we -- every single day is a fight. 
 
But what is the alternative for us? We have seen what happened in Bucha, Irpin, and Izium. We see how bravely our military are fighting for all of us to have a chance. And this is why no matter how hard it is we know that there is no alternative -- that we have to grind. That we have to get stronger, get closer, get more united, and push, push, push. This is our only path and this is how we see it. 
 
SARA SIDNER, CNN ANCHOR:  Kira Rudik, you said we have to grind and push, push, push. Just lastly, if you had a moment to look Putin in the eye what would you say to him?
 
RUDIK:  You saw that you would have a parade on the streets. Look what's happening now. Watch us. 
 
SIDNER:  Watch us. 
 
Kira Rudik, thank you so much for coming on. As a member of Parliament, I know you have a lot of work to do and with the war going on in your country I know where you are is safe. I appreciate you taking the time.
 
RUDIK:  Thank you, and glory to Ukraine.
 
POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR:  Watch us.
 
SIDNER:  Watch us.
 
HARLOW:  It says it all. 
 
Coming up, the handwritten note that President Biden left for President Zelenskyy.
 
(COMMERCIAL)
 <br>[07:35:32]
 
KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN ANCHOR:  You can see President Biden and President Zelenskyy there walking through the Alley of Courage in Kyiv, Ukraine. That is the alley that President Zelenskyy opened last fall. He said that is where the names of those who have stood with Ukraine since Russia invaded nearly a year ago this Friday -- that is where the names of those who have stood with them will be engraved.
 
President Duda, of Poland, was the first one to have his name engraved there. He was there for the opening of that ceremony. Now you see President Biden and President Zelenskyy there as President Biden was making that historic trip to Kyiv. 
 
Earlier, he had visited the official home of the Ukrainian leader. He wrote a note in a guest book saying that he was honored to be welcomed again in Kyiv -- obviously, his first trip since the invasion, but President Biden's eighth trip to Kyiv overall. And said to stand in solidarity and friendship with the freedom-loving people of Ukraine.
 
Alex Marquardt is live on the ground in Kyiv. Alex, you were there as President Biden arrived before it was publicly known that he was actually there. You know, what does this mean for people who have stayed in Ukraine during this war -- who have lived through this -- to see a U.S. president come and visit?
 
ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  Oh, I think it's extraordinarily impactful, Kaitlan, and we've heard as much from people here in the streets of Kyiv who we've spoken with. Everyone, of course, extremely pleased and happy -- honored that the American president came here today not only because of the symbolism but what he's offering in terms of more material assistance.
 
Of course, they didn't know he was coming. This trip has been shrouded in an incredible level of secrecy. And as we learn more details about when Biden left Washington more than 24 hours ago and how he got here, even though he's left Kyiv, we're still learning more. It is just remarkable how he pulled off this trip. But it does speak to not just the security concerns but the importance that Biden and Zelenskyy have attached to his coming here. 
 
It's clear that there is an extraordinary level of admiration between the two men. The president -- the Ukrainian president thanking Biden for all of his support. 
 
But there are -- there is still some daylight Kaitlan and I thought what was notable in the remarks between the two men was Zelenskyy's mention of negotiations. The fact that they are still not completely on the same page when it comes to the military aid that is being offered to Ukraine. 
 
A half-billion dollar aid package announced today by President Biden with more of the kinds of equipment that we have seen in past aid packages but not some of the items that President Zelenskyy has long been asking for, including long-range missiles and those F-16 jets. The kinds of things that Ukrainians really feel could push back the Russians from what really has become something of a stalemate in this fight -- this grinding fight along a very long front line to the east and to the south of here.
 
So while you look around this city everything does feel relatively normal. People are back to their normal lives. They're out in the streets. They're out in the bars and restaurants. They are going back to work.
 
A wildly different scene from this time last year when people were hunkered down in their homes underground. Many had fled the country.
 
There are, of course, countless reminders of the fact that this is still very much a war zone that President Biden visited today. You have these bombed-out, burned-out vehicles here behind me. Over here, a statue that has been sandbagged for protection. 
 
And Kaitlan, we keep talking about the fact that President Biden visited a war zone where there are no U.S. troops. One more thing we should note is no one is flying into Ukraine. When foreign dignitaries come here they essentially -- they take the train. They don't fly in. So it's not like Air Force One just landed in Kyiv and then took back off again. 
 
This is a long, arduous trip to get here to Kyiv. It means a lot of time on the ground. It means a lot of time when the American president is exposed. That's why, as you noted earlier, we're getting updates from the White House on a delay because there is still a significant security concern. 
 
And there is, of course, a question now how will Russia respond -- Kaitlan.
 <br>[07:40:00]
 
COLLINS:  Yes, Alex. It's notable to hear you talk about how life has returned to normal for a lot of people in Kyiv. They're going back to restaurants. They're going about their daily lives. But still, there's a tank in the middle of the town square. As you note, there's no flights going in and out Kyiv.
 
Alex Marquardt, thank you.
 
Poppy, Sara, it is notable to see what the differences are but also see how much it -- there is still an active war zone that the president was just in.
 
HARLOW:  Absolutely. We'll get back there in just a minute in Warsaw. Kaitlan, thank you very much.
 
Let's bring in David Sanger and Col. Cedric Leighton. Good morning to you again, and thank you both for joining us.
 
David, let me just take a step back with you for a moment to remind people of how Biden's position on Ukraine was informed through eight visits now and his time in the Obama administration, really pushing then-President Obama to provide lethal aid to Ukraine -- the decision, ultimately, the president decided against. 
 
How does that play into the decision you think he will make next about long-range missiles and F-16s?
 
DAVID SANGER, CNN POLITICAL AND NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, Poppy, it's a great question. 
 
And I think that it's pretty clear as we reconstruct the debates in the Obama White House that then-Vice President Biden was pressing for more. You'll remember that President Obama's view was let's not send Javelin antimissile systems. He -- that seems pretty quaint today compared to what else we've given the Ukrainians. But President Obama was very worried about provoking Russian aggression.
 
At this moment, it's provoked. And the question that faces President Biden is how does he square the two different objectives that he's laid out for his staff and for this war. One is help the Ukrainians remain independent, and the second is don't start World War III. And he is hesitant every time he thinks a missile system could provoke Russia to widen the war or perhaps use nuclear weapons.
 
SIDNER:  It's terrifying, the idea of nuclear weapons and the idea of the attack on this sort of nuclear power that Ukraine uses and that's already happened there -- already sort of tried to take that over.
 
I do wonder from the two of you -- and I hate to do this to you because predictions are always fraught -- but because of your historical perspective, because of what you have done in your lives, can you give me a sense of a) where we are in this war, and b) if this war -- do you see Ukraine coming out of this as victors?
 
COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST, U.S. AIR FORCE (RET.):  Well, Sara, as far as I'm concerned, I think the possibility certainly exists that Ukraine can be victorious. But, of course, you've got to ask the question, as I'm sure David has as well, what does victory actually look like? And in a situation like this victory is at least rolling the Russians back to the status that existed on February 23, the day before the invasion of this past year. So that would be considered I think at least a major change. 
 
It is not what President Zelenskyy wants. President Zelenskyy wants to eliminate the Russians from Crimea. He wants to eliminate them from the east -- from the Donbas region. And he certainly wants to make sure that the Russians don't pose a threat again to Kyiv or any other city in Ukraine.
 
So those are I think the major things but that, at least, would be a major step forward and it would give the Ukrainians a chance to achieve some degree of, if you will, breathing space, at least temporarily. 
 
HARLOW:  Thank you both very much, David Sanger, Col. Leighton. We appreciate it. 
 
We're going to stay on top, of course, of the president's unannounced surprise visit to Ukraine. We are also following other big stories, including former President Jimmy Carter now in hospice care. We'll get the very latest. 
 
SIDNER:  Plus, people who live in East Palestine skeptical that their water is safe to drink, that their air is safe to breathe. We'll talk to a woman who lives there and is very concerned. That's coming up. (COMMERCIAL)
 <br>[07:48:19]
 
COLLINS:  All right, welcome back.
 
President Biden is expected to travel here to Poland after making that surprise visit to Kyiv. He was here last year right after the invasion happened -- about a month after. At that time there was widespread skepticism about Ukraine's ability to withstand the assault and what that was going to look like. 
 
That was the same visit where President Biden delivered this message.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  My message to the people of Ukraine is a message I delivered today to Ukraine's foreign minister and defense minister who I believe are here tonight. We stand with you, period. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COLLINS:  It's a similar message to what President Biden said today as he was in Kyiv. Now, nearly a year after that invasion, Ukrainians have still resisted Russia's initial attempts to take control of the capital. But the war is still entering a volatile new phase. The path to peace far from clear to anyone.
 
Here with me now to discuss this visit that President Biden is making here -- not only to Kyiv but also his expected stop here in Warsaw -- is Marcin Przydacz, who is a top adviser to Polish President Duda. Also, Poland's secretary of state and a former deputy foreign minister. So, Minister, thank you so much for joining us.
 
I just want to start with your reaction to President Biden making this first trip to Ukraine since the invasion began. What did you make of it?
 
MARCIN PRZYDACZ, POLISH SECRETARY OF STATE, TOP ADVISER TO POLISH PRESIDENT ANDRZEJ DUDA:  Well, first of all, thank you very much for having me.
 
We are here in Warsaw waiting for the visit of the President of the United States -- down here in Warsaw looking forward to see him on Polish land. But, of course, we welcome very much also his brave decision to go to Ukraine as a clear sign of U.S. commitment and his personal engagement in this situation. I mean, you are sending a clear signal that the U.S. is with its allies, with its partners, and there is a belief that Ukraine can be victorious in this difficult situation. 
 <br>[07:50:26]
 
COLLINS:  And Poland has been a vocal advocate for Ukraine for sending them what they need. While the president was there, he announced they will be providing another half a billion dollars in assistance to Ukraine, but he did not name the long-range missiles or those F-16 fighter jets that Ukraine has asked for. 
 
Do you think what President Biden is sending Ukraine right now -- what the United States is sending is enough?
 
PRZYDACZ:  Well, the United States has already sent quite a lot of equipment just like many other allies and partners. Poland is one of the first -- was one of the first to send our tanks, our artillery systems. So, of course, we welcome very much this decision to send additional equipment. The more the Western technologies and the better equipment Ukraine has, the sooner we will bring back the peace and stability and this -- and the end to this war.
 
Of course, we've heard what are the -- what are the plans of the Americans. As for now, the artillery system, the anti-aircraft systems are very much needed. The ammunition to those missiles and rockets and, of course, to those systems. This is what is very much needed now.
 
Of course, as diplomats, we will continue our work in order to convince also, all our partners -- not only Poland, U.S., or Great Britain, but also our Western allies to follow the same path. As I said, the sooner that we do it, the sooner that when -- that there will be the end of this war.
 
COLLINS:  How do you expect the Kremlin to respond to this visit by President Biden -- not only to Ukraine but also coming here to Warsaw as well?
 
PRZYDACZ:  Well, as I said, I mean, we are looking forward to see President Biden down here in Warsaw. It's the second -- his visit to Poland within one year. It's a historical visit.
 
I do -- we do expect, of course, there will be a reassurance with regard to the U.S. commitment to the Euro-Atlantic Security. We, down here on the Eastern Flank of NATO, doing our job but with the great leadership of the U.S. We need this support. 
 
So what we would like to hear is also this commitment that we are standing together, that we are united, and we will continue the policy of deterrence to Russia. That are ready to continue our support to Ukrainian partners because it is the right thing to do.
 
And, of course, we're going to -- we're going to hear the White House already said a couple of words about the Polish role and the role of Polish government and the Polish people with regard to this crisis. As you know, we tried to do our best in order to help our neighbors.
 
COLLINS:  The Polish ambassador to the U.S. recently said that they -- that you want Americans to establish a more permanent presence on your soil, saying quote, "We need more American troops."
 
Have you gotten any indication that the U.S. is prepared to send more forces here, or that they are prepared to make that presence permanent? PRZYDACZ:  Well, as you remember, in 2016, down here in Warsaw during the NATO summit, the decision was taken to deploy NATO troops on the Eastern Flank. Thanks to this good decision we down here -- down here on the Eastern Flank -- we are -- feel much more safe and stable. 
 
Their challenges are still there -- are still to the east of our borders. We are doing our part. We are spending almost three percent or four percent of our GDP for military purposes because we want to secure the Eastern Flank of the entire NATO. 
 
So the more help from our allies, including U.S. but also our Western European partners, the better for all of us. There should be a division of labor. We are securing the Eastern Flank but what we need to do -- what we need to get is more support by personal but mostly equipment, storages of ammunition, infrastructure. That's what we would like to see. 
 
But, of course, the decision will be taken during the NATO summit in Vilnius this summer. This is the preparatory meeting as I -- as I expect. So, for sure, President Duda will be trying to convince President Biden to take this leadership and to show its commitment also to -- I mean, America's commitment to the entire Euro-Atlantic region.
 
COLLINS:  Yes, a division of labor, as you say. 
 
Marcin Przydacz, thank you so much for joining us with that perspective this morning.
 
PRZYDACZ:  Thank you very much.
 <br>[07:55:00]
 
COLLINS:  And Sara and Poppy, we've been talking about how much -- who different -- the difference that you see a year into Kyiv, but also the difference here in Poland. It has remarkably changed in just the last year. And talking about what they're spending on GDP -- a huge boost in defense spending here in Poland. Obviously, we'll talk much more about that as President Biden is here.
 
HARLOW:  And what they've done for so many refugees --
 
SIDNER:  Refugees.
 
HARLOW:  -- in Poland, going extraordinarily far in trying to make life livable for folks that have fled there.
 
Kaitlan, thank you. We'll get back to you in just a minute.
 
Much more of CNN's breaking news coverage of President Biden's surprise visit to Ukraine ahead. Kaitlan is standing by in Poland with the chief White House correspondent Phil Mattingly. Clarissa Ward is live in Kyiv.
 
And we'll also bring you analysis of the significant moment in the war ahead of the one-year mark. SIDNER:  Also, former President Jimmy Carter is now in hospice care. What we're learning this morning. We're live in Plains, Georgia.
