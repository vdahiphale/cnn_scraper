JESSICA DEAN, CNN ANCHOR:  And I think people are thinking about this more.
 
MEGHAN HAYS, FORMER SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO PRESIDENT BIDEN:  I think people are thinking about it more. People are taking more precautions. Like you're staying in your seat, everyone's staying in their seat. But I also think we need to be looking at climate change. It's not just what the airlines can do. There are other things here that are impacting this that I think we should take a real look at.
 
DEAN:  Right. And that's what the experts have said too, that it is, it is going back to climate change.
 
All right, thanks to this panel, always good to see all of you. And thank you for joining us this morning. I'm Jessica Dean in for Kasie Hunt and CNN News Central starts now.
 
RAHEL SOLOMON, CNN ANCHOR:  Over a hundred million Americans are facing the threat of severe weather this Memorial Day. That's after powerful storms ripped through the central U.S., leaving terrible destruction and killing at least 19 people in four states.
 
BIANNA GOLODRYGA, CNN ANCHOR:  The TSA says that it set a new record for most travelers screened in a single day on Friday. But could that intense storm system impact millions trying to get back home after the holiday weekend?
 
And a former General Hospital actor fatally shot in Los Angeles. Police right now searching for the suspects.
 
I'm Bianna Golodryga with Rahel Solomon. This is CNN News Central.
 
SOLOMON:  Let's begin this morning with that severe weather, deadly tornadoes ripping through America's heartland with severe storms today now threatening millions of people as they gather for the holiday. Right now, at least 19 people are dead including four children. That's after a violent weekend tornado outbreak hit four states, miles of homes and businesses destroyed across Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky.
 
And in Kentucky, a state of emergency declared, brand new video showing one reported tornado as it struck near Eddyville. One couple's home taking a direct hit. Look,
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I thought it was going to blow the door open, but it was a steel door I'd put on there and reinforced it, so that's the only thing that safe.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It's awful, almost everything. But at least my dog is okay. My husband is okay.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SOLOMON:  And the threat is not over. More than 120 million people could see severe storms today. Life threatening heat also an issue.
 
CNN's Ed Lavandera is standing by one of the hardest hit areas in Texas, but, first, let's go to Meteorologist Derek Van Dam. He is tracking the latest out of Kentucky where the threat is greatest right now.
 
Derek, give us a sense of what you're seeing and what you're watching.
 
DEREK VAN DAM, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  Yes, Rahel. Well, the same storms that struck Kentucky yesterday have advanced a little further to the south and east. This is our severe weather threat for the day, which, by the way, encompasses over 120 million Americans. The reason for that is because of these large population densities across the mid- Atlantic, including our nation's capital, New York, Philadelphia, stretching all the way to the southeast, and that's inclusive of Atlanta under this slight risk of storms. The threats today, a few tornadoes, damaging wind gusts, and large hail, all possible within these locations.
 
Here's a tornado that struck the Hopkins County region. This is Dawson Springs, Kentucky. And if you recall, back in December of 2021, this area was ravaged by an EF-4 tornado. To see yet another tornado come through the same exact location is truly heartbreaking.
 
Now, Kentucky has the highest number of customers without power, but look at how many states are impacted, over 600,000 customers without power this morning. They wake up on this holiday Memorial Day and they are just, of course, having to deal with that.
 
Now, we're considering a watch box, a tornado or severe thunderstorm watch box across Central Georgia. More on that to come, getting bits of information from the Storm Prediction Center. But we still do have severe thunderstorm and tornado watches across portions of Mississippi and Alabama, a few severe thunderstorm watches, but no tornado warnings at the moment across the area.
 
But look at this, we've had over 1,000 reports of severe weather through the course of this weekend, an extended holiday weekend, and many people outdoors being caught off guard with these storms that are advancing eastward.
 
And then we recycle that severe weather threat tomorrow into the state of Texas, where, of course, we have a heat wave that is still ongoing. Look at these heat indexes. This is what it'll feel like as you step outside on your skin, Rahel, over 115 degrees Fahrenheit. So, all kinds of threats facing the nation this morning.
 
SOLOMON:  Yes, just brutal. Derek Van Dam, thank you. But, Bianna, you could see in the map there just how many people in the U.S., over 100 million people facing some sort of severe weather. It just gives you a sense of just how many people are going to be experiencing this potentially today.
 
GOLODRYGA:  Yes, an unbelievable destruction we've already seen in some of those images.
 
And right now, let's go to Texas, where a massive cleanup and recovery effort is now underway. Our Ed Lavandera is in Valley View, Texas.
 
Ed, our home state just can't catch a break here, just horrific images behind you.
 <br>[07:05:02]
 
What more can we expect to see?
 
ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, in the darkness of Saturday night, an EF-2 tornado with winds of 135 miles per hour ripped through this area near Valley View, Texas, north of the Dallas Fort Worth area in Denton, Texas. It was terrifying moments.
 
If you look behind me, this is the convenience store along the interstate where dozens of people, in fact, emergency officials say more than 100 people sought, sought shelter inside here to protect themselves because there isn't much else to in many other places to be able to hide from, the storm that was barreling its way through this part of north Texas, and it came through with devastating results. In this area alone, seven people were killed, four of those victims, young children.
 
And we spent a yesterday in the neighborhoods that were so ravaged by the storm and we spoke with many residents who said, you know, they had they had some time of warning, preparing for what was coming. And they knew as the storm hit that it was going to be bad.

FRANK GARCIA, SURVIVED TORNADO:  Sirens everywhere. It was all dark and, yes, I mean, it's one of those moments that you see, you see videos about tornadoes. You see people retelling him. Just like how, you know, I'm retelling him now, but it's really one of those things you never expect and, you know, until it actually happens.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) LAVANDERA:  And, Bianna, you know, much of the day has been spent clearing properties from all of the damage. That effort will continue today. The debris cleanup here at this gas station will continue. And it was widespread. This tornado spent a considerable amount of time along the ground here in North Texas. Also, a few miles from where we are, Marina at a popular lake, was destroyed with boats overturned and all the extensive damage there as well. So, you know, terrifying moments.
 
And right now, as this heat will continue to increase throughout the day, many residents here will spend their Memorial Day cleaning up the pieces. Bianna?
 
GOLODRYGA:  Cleaning up the pieces in record heat. Ed Lavandera, thank you so much. Rahel, back to you.
 
SOLOMON:  All right. After the break, tomorrow, Manhattan prosecutors will try to convince a jury that Donald Trump should be convicted on 34 criminal charges. Coming up, a look at the last minute preps for both teams before closing arguments.
 
We're also watching developments in Massachusetts. That's where a man is in custody after stabbing four girls in a movie theater, the youngest victim just nine years old. What police are saying about his possible connection to a murder in another state.
 
And at least 35 people killed in an Israeli strike in Gaza that Doctors Without Borders said hit a camp for displaced people. The IDF claiming that it took out two senior Hamas commanders. But the strike could now impact hostage negotiations. All of that when we return.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[07:10:00]
 
SOLOMON:  Welcome back. Tomorrow, closing arguments are set to begin in Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial. In more than five weeks, prosecutors have called 20 witnesses to the stand while the defense has called two. Throughout the testimony, prosecutors have put the spotlight on 11 invoices, 12 vouchers and 11 checks. Those are the 34 documents that Trump is charged with falsifying and included reimbursement for the 130, 000 hush money payment for Stormy Daniels.
 
Let's bring in CNN's Katelyn Polantz. Katelyn, the jury has obviously had a few days, a bit of a delay here. So, what can we expect tomorrow?
 
KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE REPORTER:  Well, Rahel, tomorrow is closing summation. So, both sides are going to make their final pitches to the jury. The prosecutors are going to argue that they have proved the case that those 20 witnesses were able to connect all of the dots in this case against Donald Trump.
 
Those 20 witnesses were able to say that Donald Trump was motivated to hide these payments, that the jurors saw those payments to Stormy Daniels being made to keep her quiet during the 2016 election, and it was all an attempt for Donald Trump to keep and protect his 2016 political campaign, campaign finance motivation. That is part of the core of their case.
 
The defense, they're going to argue in their summation that the prosecutors, they don't have enough evidence. They didn't prove the case, that it's all circumstantial. And then also that guy, Michael Cohen, who took the stand for three days, four days, that he was not somebody that can be trusted. That is very likely to be the whole of the defense case.
 
Now, all of this has a lot of mechanics tomorrow. These are arguments where the defense will go first, they'll present, then the prosecutors, they will present their closing. These could go all day. We know from the judge that he has not set any specific time limits at this point in time. And then after those summations are done, jury instructions.
 
That is when the jurors will be told exactly what their work needs to do, what they need to be able to find if they want to convict the former president of the United States for these business falsification of records crimes. And then the jury deliberations will begin. Those could go however long it takes to reach some sort of verdict or for the judge to say it's taking too long.
 
I've heard from sources, the defense team has been working to all over the weekend preparing for this, but they're also busy with some other things as well, Rahel. There is now a request for a gag order on the former president related to a separate criminal case, his classified documents case in Florida.
 <br>[07:15:04]
 
We're waiting to see what they do there as well. Rahel?
 
SOLOMON:  Yes, certainly a question mark, how long the jury could take, but deliberations could begin as early as Wednesday. Katelyn Polantz live for us in Washington, Katelyn, thank you.
 
All right, a search for suspects is underway in California. That's after a former General Hospital actor was shot and killed in a robbery.
 
Also, how much will those extreme storms disrupt your Memorial Day travel plans? We're tracking all of it, coming up next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
SOLOMON:  New this morning, police arrested a suspect after six people were stabbed in separate attacks in Massachusetts over the weekend. Officials say that four girls between the ages of 9 and 17 were attacked at a movie theater in Braintree.
 <br>[07:20:04]
 
Then about an hour later, two other people were stabbed at a McDonald's in Plymouth. All of the victims were taken to the hospitals with non life threatening injuries. The Plymouth County D.A. said that the 26-year- old suspect was arrested 15 minutes after fleeing the scene of the McDonald's and now faces multiple assault charges. Police say that the attacks are likely connected and that the investigation is active and ongoing. Bianna?
 
GOLODRYGA:  All right. Also new this morning, Los Angeles police are searching for the suspects involved in a shooting that killed a former General Hospital actor. Johnny Wactor was fatally shot over the weekend after police say he walked up on an attempted robbery.
 
CNN's Camila Bernal joins me now with more quite stunning news overnight. What more are we hearing about this?
 
CAMILA BERNAL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Bianna. So, we know that police are currently searching for the people responsible for killing this actor. According to police, this happened on Saturday at around 3:25 in the morning as the actor was leaving work. His mother spoke to our affiliate, KABC, saying he was actually at a rooftop bar. That's where he worked in downtown L.A.
 
And as he was leaving, he saw what he thought was people working on his car, his mother saying that he thought his car was being towed. So, he approached these three people and one of the suspects looked up and shot him, according to his mom. Then authorities confirmed this, they did not name Johnny Wactor but said that there were three people who were trying to steal a car's catalytic converter when the suspect approached or, excuse me, the victim approached the suspects and that's when he was shot. Those three people drove off in a car, and authorities say that he was taken to the hospital where he was later pronounced dead.
 
So, as authorities are trying to figure this out and continue this investigation, searching for these three people that were trying to steal the catalytic converter, the soap opera community really coming together to remember this 37-year-old. He was on General Hospital from 2020 to 2022, so about 150 episodes more than that, he appeared on the show.
 
So, the show releasing a statement, I want to read part of what they said. They said this. The entire General Hospital family is heartbroken to hear of Johnny Wactor's untimely passing. He was truly one of a kind and a pleasure to work with each and every day. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his loved ones during this difficult time.
 
Now, his T.V. wife, Sophia Mattson, also posted a small tribute on her Instagram and she said this. Johnny was the absolute best, so genuine, so caring, incredibly hardworking and humble, with a huge heart that spread so much kindness and joy.
 
You know, he was on General Hospital. He also appeared on criminal minds, an episode of NCIS, and, again, just the Hollywood community coming together, his agent saying he was an example to others, someone that would give you the shirt off his back. Bianna? GOLODRYGA:  Just really sad news. Camila Bernal, thank you.
 
Well, still ahead for us, severe weather threats persist in the east after at least 19 people died this weekend when tornadoes rocked the central U.S. What to expect today if you're traveling.
 
And there's a brand new presidential candidate this morning, the libertarian who has jumped in the race and why President Trump was booed on stage this weekend, all that up next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[07:25:00]
 
SOLOMON:  Well, Memorial Day weekend is certainly living up to the expectations for travel numbers. Experts are predicting shattering records across the board. AAA says nearly 44 million people will travel by plane, car and train this holiday weekend, coming close to the 2005 record.
 
The TSA announced that on Friday that it screened nearly 3 million travelers at checkpoints nationwide. That is the most ever recorded in a single day. And as many of you are watching are set to head home, a series of storms across the country could have a serious impact on your trip.
 
CNN's Pete Muntean is live for us at Reagan National Airport. Pete, I saw you last week. You told me that we were going to be making some new records, perhaps meeting old records. You were right.
 
PETE MUNTEAN, CNN AVIATION CORRESPONDENT:  Yes. You know, that now really begins the rush home though. All of those people who left are now coming back. It's really ushering in this huge summer for travel. Even here at Reagan National Airport, they're predicting a 3 percent increase in travel all summer long.
 
The TSA Numbers for this weekend have been huge. On Thursday, it was 2. 9 million people at airports nationwide, came only 11,000 passengers short than the all-time air travel record recorded by the TSA. Then Friday, 2.95 million people, that is now the all time air travel record, really obliterated the previous record by about 45,000 people.
 
Today anticipated to be pretty big, 2.7 million people expected to be screened by TSA at airports nationwide, really foreshadowing a gangbuster summer for air travel, a bubble that shows no signs of bursting.
 
Here is what TSA Administrator David Pekoske said about that.
 <br>[07:30:00]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DAVID PEKOSKE, TSA ADMINISTRATOR:  This will be the busiest summer travel season we have on record. We expect to see between 8 and 10 percent growth over the course of this --</pre>
