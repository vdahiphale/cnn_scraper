LYNDA KINKADE, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST: Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us from all around the world. I'm Lynda Kinkade, and this is CNN Newsroom. Good to have you with us.
 
Coming up, an air bridge brings humanitarian aid to Haiti, as a gang uprising continues to cause havoc in the country.
 
The third and final day of voting in Russia's presidential election is underway. These are live pitches coming into us from Moscow. Of course, there's little doubt who will win with next to no opposition.
 
And Niger breaks off a military agreement with the United States. We'll have a live report from the region.
 
And we begin with a humanitarian tragedy gripping Haiti, where violence is widespread in the streets as the gang uprising limits access in and out of the country. Sources tell CNN the first flights of a U.N. air bridge between Haiti and the Dominican Republic have been completed. It will help bring much-needed humanitarian aid into Haiti as people struggle to find food and supplies.
 
Police say several bandits were killed during an operation in Port-au- Prince Friday. Police seized firearms and unblocked roads in the Lower Delmas neighborhood. Authorities say they're hoping to take back some areas held by armed gangs.
 
CNN's David Culver is on the ground in Haiti's capital and explains how people are trying to stay safe as gangs expand their control.
 
DAVID CULVER, CNN SENIOR U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Neighbors protecting neighbors. That's essentially what this has become here in Port-au-Prince just to survive. And this is one community that we're in that feels rather safe. And that's just because several blocks out, you've got perimeter after perimeter that is set up by the community and works with the police.
 
So, the police essentially allow the community to do what they need to do to set up these blocks at entries and exits. And the community in turn helps empower the police so that they can then do their patrols.
 
But for many of them, it's about setting these up to block what is not far from here. And that is an expanding gang territory, one that has been trying to encroach on this community in particular many times over the past year or so.
 
And it got to a point where community members, according to one police commander, had to take justice into their own hands. And they were able to take into custody 14 suspected gang members. They then executed those gang members right in the middle of the street.
 
It was a very public display, but for them, it was to send a message to other gang members to keep out of their community. It hasn't stopped the gangs from trying to push further and further in. But for the folks who live here, they say everyday life has gotten increasingly difficult.
 
We see a few street vendors, but not many. When we were here three weeks ago, many of the sidewalks were filled with street vendors. Folks now simply don't have things to sell. And so they've resorted to trying to secure as best as possible using the police's help some of the supply lines, trying to bring water and food into areas like this.
 
I asked some of the community members, how is it that they're able to stay afloat? And he said, we rely on each other. Essentially, they will have some of these community members go door to door collecting food, maybe some money, some water, and then that provides some subsidence for the folks who are securing these communities.
 
If you ask who's in charge, they look around and they say no one. That's why they've taken matters into their own hands. If you ask what do you need, what can help Haiti in this moment, the first thing that most folks have told us is for the international community to not intervene in the way they have in the past. Instead, they want help in the form of aid, but they also say that they need some sort of security backup.
 
What that looks like, they didn't really articulate. Folks really didn't want to go into too much detail in trying to explain what that added security might come in the form of.
 
But for most here, it's just about trying to figure out how to get to tomorrow and knowing that tonight could bring another round of violence.
 
David Culver, CNN, Port-au-Prince, Haiti.

KINKADE: Joining me now is Jacqueline Charles. She is the Caribbean correspondent for the Miami Herald. Good to have you with us.
 
JACQUELINE CHARLES, CARIBBEAN CORRESPONDENT, MIAMI HERALD: Thanks for having me.
 
KINKADE: So, we know gangs now control roads in and out of the capital. Describe what you're hearing from your contacts on the ground.
 
CHARLES: Well, you know, the gangs have been controlling the roads for a while, and what we've seen over time is that, you know, on any given day, any given week, a road may be open. It just depends on the gangs and on what's happening or their ability to collect tolls.
 
I mean, what's happening right now with these coordinated attacks is people are basically forced to shelter in place. They just cannot move out of Port-au-Prince. And so Port-au-Prince is completely locked down at this very moment.
 
KINKADE: And we have heard from the U.N. World Food Program who says the eastern part of Haiti's capital has malnutrition rates comparable with any war zone in the world. We know that the U.S. is offering to charter out citizens and eligible family members if they can get to the airport safely.
 
Is there a safe way to the airport right now and what will people find if they get there?
 
CHARLES: So, this charter flight is going to be leaving from the north of Haiti, which is Cape Haitien. And if you're in Port-au-Prince, there's no way that you can get there. There are three roads that you can take, and they're all locked by gangs.
 
So, this will benefit people who were already in the northern part or in the northwest, and they would have to go through a back road as opposed to going down another road that leads essentially into, you know, kidnapping alley.
 
So, it's great that they are doing these voluntary flights, but the people who really honestly need them because they feel surrounded by gangs, they can't get there safely.
 
KINKADE: But is it fair to say the gangs currently control the airport in the capital?
 
CHARLES: It's not that the gangs control the airport in the capital. It's the fact that they have been targeting the airport. And just a few days ago, we had heavy gunfire on the perimeter of the airport, and it was aimed at the Haitian National Police headquarters.
 
So, if your plane is trying to land, this is not a very safe situation at the particular moment. When the airport is going to reopen, we do not know. But that's the concern, that the gangs have been targeting the airport.
 
KINKADE: Jacqueline, how many people are likely to make it to this charter plane?
 
CHARLES: So, this charter flight has 166 seats. They basically announced it, you know, on social media. We don't know if this is the first of many that they are going to attempt or what, you know, sort of requests that they've had. They basically have been reaching out to American citizens.
 
And I have to remind folks that there has been a level four, do not travel to Haiti warning. And you have people who may even be in the capital, but because they're in some process, for instance, adoption, you know, they can't leave because their child doesn't have all the necessary paperwork and they can't even get to the U.S. embassy. So, we really do not know how many people we're talking about that's going to take advantage of this.
 
KINKADE: And, of course, we know many Caribbean countries are worried about the influx of refugees. For those Haitians trying to flee, what's their best hope of getting asylum? Where should they go?
 
CHARLES: There is nowhere that you should go, because, for instance, in neighboring Turks and Caicos, where I'm originally from, I mean, they've been turning Haitians back even before this. Jamaica just turned back 65 Haitians.
 
The Bahamas is on guard. And we hear their discussions about, once again, using Guantanamo Bay by the U.S. And what we've seen with the U.S. is that they will turn Haitians back. And, in fact, if you attempt to leave by sea, you know, there really is no exit.
 
So, I know the people are desperate, but what we are being told by the international community, the U.S. and East Caribbean islands, is that, no, don't attempt to do this.
 
KINKADE: Well, and, of course, you know, gangs are also taking control of humanitarian aid, UNICEF saying that 17 of its containers were looted yesterday in another attack by gangs. Another 260 humanitarian- owned containers are under the control of gangs.
 
It's obviously horrific for people desperately in need of aid. The prime minister, as you've been reporting, has resigned. What comes next?
 
CHARLES: So, that's the situation here. While the violence is focused in Port-au-Prince, and we've been talking a lot about Port-au-Prince, but what's happening in Port-au-Prince is going to start to have effects outward, because the seaport is shut down, the airport is shut down.
 
This is a country that relies 50 percent of its food imports. And so people in these other areas are not going to be able -- they're not having access to food, to fuel, to potable water, to basic essentials. And that's the concern, that that will drive people, you know, to risk their lives at sea.
 
Right now, we are waiting to see whether or not this presidential council that's supported by CARICOM in the United States is going to take formation. But even then, is that going to be enough to calm the violence? What we've seen since the announcement that the violence has ratcheted up. Last night, the Haitian police, into Saturday morning, they have basically been running an operation in the Lower Delmas area, which is the fiefdom of a particular gang member. But, again, it's challenging for them.
 <br>[03:10:01]
 
They can't hold these areas after they take control of them.
 
KINKADE: Jacqueline Charles, we'll leave it there for now, but we appreciate your time and perspective. Thanks so much for joining us. CHARLES: Thanks for having me.
 
KINKADE: Well, as the unrest continues in Haiti, there are concerns about a possible influx of Haitian refugees in Florida. And the governor there, Ron DeSantis, says the federal government isn't doing enough to prevent that. He's acting on his own.
 
CNN's Rafael Romo reports.
 
RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Governor Ron DeSantis announced Friday that he's boosting law enforcement in Florida by increasing the number of officers and agents. The goal is helping federal officials deal with a potential increase in the number of migrants trying to get to the United States through Florida as the unrest continues to grow in Haiti.
 
DeSantis said he's beefing up agencies like the Florida Department of Law Enforcement as well as Fish and Wildlife. According to the governor, as part of this new directive, he has increased the National Guard by 48 guardsmen, the Florida State Guard by up to 133 soldiers and the Florida Highway Patrol by 30 additional officers in addition to equipment and aircraft like four more helicopters to be used by the National Guard.
 
DeSantis specifically referred to the crisis in Haiti and the potential for a new wave of migrants from the Caribbean nation trying to get to Florida by boat.
 
This is part of what he had to say.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): What we decided to do, given the situation that's happening in Haiti, some brutal reports that are happening, we want to make sure that we're protecting Floridians. And so we have authorized additional officers with the relevant agencies, Florida Department of Law Enforcement, Florida Fish and Wildlife.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ROMO: Also on Friday DeSantis signed three new bills into law, including one that increases maximum sentences for people driving illegally without a license in the state, another one that enhances penalties for a crime committed by an individual who returns to the country after deportation. The third one says that Florida will not recognize I.D.s issued to undocumented migrants elsewhere.
 
DeSantis also said that since he declared a state of emergency over migrant entries in January 2023, Florida law enforcement agencies have intercepted 670 vessels carrying over 13,500 undocumented migrants.
 
Once again, DeSantis criticized the federal government for not doing enough he said to secure the border and says states have been left to fend for themselves. Last month the White House blamed House Republicans for rejecting a bipartisan bill that it said contained, quote, the toughest and fairest reforms to secure the border we have had in decades.

KINKADE: Russia is holding the third and final day of voting in a presidential election. And with no real competition allowed, Vladimir Putin is likely to get another six years in office. But as voters cast their ballots, the Kremlin is going after those who staged small acts of protests at the polls.
 
This is a polling station coming into us live right now from Moscow. We are keeping an eye on the pushback at some of those polling stations. Prosecutors have opened 15 cases against suspects who reportedly tried to set fire at polling stations or put dye on ballot boxes.
 
The widow of opposition leader Alexei Navalny has urged voters to come out Sunday and send a clear message to Mr. Putin.
 
Our Clare Sebastian is keeping an eye on developments in Russia and joins us now live from London. Good to have you with us, Clare.
 
So, Russia is accusing the Ukraine of disrupting the election and you're just hearing about a drone strike at a polling station. What are you learning?
 
CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, this is not in Russia, Lynda, but in Russian-occupied area of Ukraine in the Zaporizhzhia region, a town near actually the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. A member of the Russian installed administration there is saying that there was a double strike with Ukrainian drones on a polling station in a cultural center, which apparently started a fire, but there are no casualties.
 
Now, this on top of another explosion that was reported in the town of Berdyans'k, also in Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia, an improvised explosive device, according to Russian authorities claiming, as you say, that Ukraine is trying to disrupt the elections there.
 
Of course, illegal under international law to hold elections like this in occupied territory. And Ukraine has urged its citizens not to vote in these elections. So, that is the occupied territories in Ukraine.
 
In Russia proper, we have seen the elections come with this uptick in attacks. This really is a visual reminder, I think, to the Russian people that this is a vote happening in a state of war, the Belgorod region, where we've seen attacks really step up in the past week or so. The governor claiming another attack this morning, which killed a 16-year-old girl.
 
We know, according to a CNN count, there were around five people who have been killed in that region before this over the past week.
 <br>[03:15:05]
 
Separately, the Russian Air Force is claiming to have shot down some 35 Ukrainian drones and we're hearing of a potential attack on another oil refinery after a spate of attacks on oil refineries that we've seen inside Russia over the past week.
 
So, significant, I think, that the Russian state media glossing over this, because, of course, they don't want the Russian people to associate these elections with the danger and inconvenience caused by this war, Lynda.
 
KINKADE: Yes, exactly. And as you pointed out, certainly, plenty of acts of defiance, both in Russia and in these occupied territories, but certainly plenty of Russians are not even bothering to vote given the expected outcome, the fact that most opponents are dead, detained or banned from running.
 
Clare, how does the turnout this year, as far as we know, compare to previous elections?
 
SEBASTIAN: So, turnout is the key metric in this election, Lynda, because, of course, there are no opposition or real opposition candidates on the ballot. So, this will be the number that the Kremlin uses to prove the legitimacy of Putin's continued tenure, his entry into what we expect to be a fifth time.
 
As of now, the Central Election Commission is providing regular updates. It's over 60 percent. Now, the magic number here is 67.5 percent, which was what was achieved six years ago in 2018. So, certainly, it seems the Kremlin will be looking to surpass that, to show that, as Putin has said outright, that the majority of Russia's people support him.
 
Now, that may be true, but, of course, we are seeing as well this undercurrent of opposition sentiment coming to the fore with these various acts of vandalism and civil disobedience at polling stations. That certainly, given the climate of repression in Russia, this very tough legal system, new laws coming in since the start of the war to prevent acts of opposition, is perhaps more than expected. So, that is something that we are watching very closely, as well as the call from, as you noted, from Navalny's team to come out at noon and show support for this sort of opposition movement.
 
We've already seen images coming out of eastern regions. So far, it just looks like people turning up to vote, but the big cities are where we expect to see the majority of that opposition sentiment right now.
 
It's just after 10:00 A.M. in Moscow, so this is something we'll be watching closely in the coming hours. Lynda?
 
KINKADE: Yes, we will be following it closely indeed. Clare Sebastian for us in London, good to have you with us on that breaking news. Thanks so much.
 
Well, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy says, quote, there will definitely be military responses to Russia. It comes after 21 people were killed in the southern port city of Odessa on Friday. Moscow is also accusing Ukraine of escalating strikes inside Russian territory. Officials in the southern region of Belgorod are closing schools, colleges and shopping malls for the next few days after an increase in Ukrainian cross-border attacks.
 
Belgorod's governor says two people were killed on Saturday, including a truck driver whose vehicle was hit by a shell. Ukraine's spy chief says it's actually a domestic problem for Putin to solve, saying Russia's sabotage groups are carrying out the attacks as well.
 
Israel-Hamas ceasefire talks are expected to resume in just a matter of days. That's coming up ahead with concerns about Israel's plan for a ground offensive in Rafah.
 
Plus, a big loss for the movie and T.V. industry, the Hollywood on the Nile, a historic film studio in Cairo, goes up in flames.
 
You're watching CNN.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[03:20:56]
 
KINKADE: Welcome back. Protesters in Israel clashed with police while calling for new elections. Police made several arrests in the town of Caesarea, where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has a private residence. Thousands rallied in the town angry about the government's handling of the hostage situation in Gaza.
 
In Tel Aviv, thousands more protested Netanyahu's government. They called for the government to make a deal with Hamas to bring the hostages home.
 
And in Gaza, the Ministry of Health says Israeli military operations have killed at least 63 people over the past 24 hours. The head of the World Health Organization says he's gravely concerned about Israel's plan for a ground defensive in Rafah. He says it would, quote, lead to many more deaths, especially with health facilities already overwhelmed.
 
And ceasefire talks are expected to resume Monday.
 
Journalist Elliott Gotkine is live in London with more on all of this. Good to have you with us, Elliott.
 
So, plenty of protests, thousands of people turning out, some demanding the return of the hostages, others just want Netanyahu gone.
 
ELLIOTT GOTKINE, CNN REPORTER: That's right, Lynda. There were two protests, certainly in Tel Aviv. There were two different lots of protesters. As you say, one lot was demanding that Prime Minister Netanyahu step down and that fresh elections be called, elections that opinion polls suggest that Netanyahu would not only lose, but elections in which he would be trounced. And then the other lot were protesting to put pressure on the government to try to get them to do a deal to bring back home the 100 or so hostages believed to be alive and still being held captive in Gaza after being kidnapped on October the 7th as part of the Hamas-led terrorist attacks.
 
Now, they do overlap somewhat, both physically, because they're both happening in downtown Tel Aviv, and also ideologically, because some of those demanding that Netanyahu stepped down are doing so because they believe that he is now an obstacle to bringing the hostages back home, because so long as the hostages are still being held by Hamas and others in the Gaza Strip, and so long as the war with Hamas continues in Gaza, then Netanyahu will be able to say that it's impossible to hold elections and he will remain in office and won't have to face the polls. So, that is why some of them are calling for Netanyahu to step down.
 
But as you say, it wasn't just Tel Aviv. There were protests in Jerusalem and by Prime Minister Netanyahu's private residence in Caesarea. There were some arrests. There was a little bit of violence with fires being set on the Island Highway, the main highway that kind of splits Tel Aviv, that runs through Tel Aviv.
 
And, of course, this all comes ahead of a war cabinet meeting due to take place at 10:00 A.M. Eastern Time, 6:00 P.M. local time today, followed by a full cabinet meeting, during which they are due to discuss Israel's position in the face of Hamas' new proposal. Its demands seem to have softened a little bit, but Netanyahu is still calling those demands absurd.
 
And then, of course, also to decide what David Barnea, the head of the Mossad, who is Israel's main point man in these truce negotiations, what his position ought to be when he goes to Doha, which is expected to happen either later this evening or tomorrow, to resume those talks, to try to get a truce, a ceasefire, a six-week ceasefire in place, get those hostages, at least some of them, back into Israel, and that would also require the freeing of a number of Palestinian prisoners and more humanitarian aid going into the Gaza Strip. Lynda?
 
KINKADE: So, Elliott, big picture, looking at these protests that are taking place, what do they say about the growing divisions in the country?
 
GOTKINE: I think it shows clearly that they are growing, that the unity that the Hamas-led terrorist attacks of October the 7th created is now fracturing. And for a lot of 2023, you will recall, there were protests every week pretty much on a Saturday evening in Central Tel Aviv demanding the government abort its plans to dilute the powers of the Supreme Court. And I was there on many occasions in Tel Aviv seeing those protests up close.
 
Those were put on hold as a result of October the 7th, and now they seem to have morphed into this kind of, you know, get a hostage deal done, Netanyahu should leave office protests, which seem to be growing, because the people in Israel are very frustrated that these hostages are still being held.
 <br>[03:25:10]
 
That's not to say that Israelis are against the war against Hamas, but, certainly, they -- many will believe that the priorities of the war should be more to get the hostages back rather than destroying Hamas. Lynda?
 
KINKADE: All right. Elliott Gotkine for us in London, thanks so much.
 
Well, a fire has destroyed a historic film studio in Egypt. State media reports that flames erupted at the 80-year-old Al-Ahram studio in Cairo after filming wrapped on a Ramadan T.V. series. All buildings at the site are reportedly affected with three stages, screening rooms and editing suites.
 
The studio is considered the cornerstone of the film industry in Egypt, dubbed Hollywood on the Nile. Several people were hurt, but there have been no reports of deaths, and an investigation is underway.
 
Well, still to come on CNN, Donald Trump campaigns in Ohio, making a shocking comment about what could happen if he loses the election in November. Details just ahead.
 
Plus, we'll take a look at the latest in a series of incidents troubling embattled aircraft-maker Boeing.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
KINKADE: Welcome back. Donald Trump is on the campaign trail after securing enough delegates to clinch the party's Republican presidential nomination. He was in Ohio Saturday, two days before the state's primary. He promised to protect the U.S. auto industry and made a shocking comment about the consequences should he lose November.
 
CNN's Alayna Treene reports.
 
ALAYNA TREENE, CNN REPORTER: Well, former President Donald Trump gave his first formal speech here in Ohio after he secured enough delegates earlier in the week to effectively declare him the Republican presidential nominee.
 
But, look, Donald Trump's visit to Ohio was not necessarily to boost his own candidacy. Both Donald Trump and his team believe that he will do very well in this state in November. Instead, he was here to boost his endorsed candidate for the Ohio Senate primary. That's businessman Bernie Moreno.
 
Moreno was locked in a messy, contested three-way primary. And Donald Trump really came to the state in the hopes of giving him that last- minute boost and more support ahead of that race on Tuesday.
 
But even though Donald Trump was here to talk about the Ohio Senate primary, much of his speech focused on the general election. He attacked Joe Biden and blamed him for what he argued were the many charges that he is facing.
 <br>[03:30:00]
 
And he also offered a new line that I have yet to hear yet on the campaign trail, and that is essentially that he argued if he were to not win re-election in November that there would be a bloodbath in this country. Take a listen to how he put it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We're going to put a 100 percent tariff on every single car that comes across the line, and you're not going to be able to sell those cars, if I get elected. Now, if I don't get elected, it's going to be a bloodbath for the whole -- that's going to be the least of it. It's going to be a bloodbath for the country. That will be the least of it.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TREENE: Now, those comments came as Donald Trump once again argued that he wanted to free those imprisoned for their role on January 6th. He referred to those convicted as hostages, a more favorable term that we've heard him use time and again on the campaign trail, and he argued that it was a day one priority for him if he were to reclaim the White House in November.
 
Alayna Treene, CNN, Vandalia, Ohio.
 
KINKADE: The Trump campaign later sought to clarify Trump's comments saying he was specifically talking about an economic bloodbath for the auto industry and auto workers when he said there would be a bloodbath if he loses.
 
But President Joe Biden's campaign was already slamming the comment. In a statement, Biden's campaign spokesperson said Trump wants another January 6th but the American people are going to give him another electoral defeat this November because they continue to reject his extremism, his affection for violence and his thirst for revenge.
 
In Venezuela, President Nicolas Maduro confirmed that he will seek a third term in office in the upcoming presidential election. He has accepted his ruling party's official nomination Saturday but it's not clear who Mr. Maduro will face in July.
 
His main rival, Maria Corina Machado has been barred from running over corruption allegations, which she denies. The country has descended into economic collapse since Mr. Maduro took power in 2013.
 
Growing concerns for embattled aircraft-maker Boeing after another plane was found to be missing a part. United Airlines Flight 433 flew from San Francisco to Medford, Oregon Friday. After the Boeing 737-800 landed safely, someone on the ground noticed a panel missing from underneath the wing.
 
CNN's Camila Bernal has more.
 
CAMILA BERNAL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: So, what's interesting here is that despite that external panel being missing, nobody noticed. This was discovered by someone after the plane landed. And while it was at the gate, this was a flight from San Francisco to Oregon, and it was a Boeing 737, but it was a previous generation, so not the MAX that's been in the headlines recently.
 
It had 145 passengers and crew members. And according to United, those crew members did not declare an emergency while they were in the air. United now saying that they're reviewing and trying to figure out exactly how and why this all happened, but, unfortunately, it's not the first incident that they're dealing with.
 
They have been under scrutiny for several incidents, including one where the engine ingested bubble wrap. That all caught on fire midair. And another incident, well, that after takeoff, the plane lost a wheel and crashed into some cars below it.
 
Now, United has said that they're reviewing all of these incidents separately, and I also want to point out that there was another incident, so not with United, a separate airline, a different incident, but also involving a Boeing aircraft.
 
This time it was LATAM Airlines, where, on Monday, passengers on that plane experienced a midair drop. About 50 passengers were injured after all of this. And Boeing putting out essentially an alert and recommending checks to these airlines on the switches on the pilot seats.
 
After all of this happened, American Airlines, for example, also saying that they've identified a potential hazard on those switches on the pilot seats, which they believe possibly caused that midair drop on that LATAM flight.
 
And so, again, a lot of different issues but a lot of people asking for accountability. This is something that the FAA says they're looking into, specifically that advisory from Boeing. And they say they will continue to monitor this incident.
 
Camila Bernal, CNN, Los Angeles.
 
KINKADE: Joining me now is CNN Safety Analyst David Soucie. Good to see you, David.
 
DAVID SOUCIE, CNN SAFETY ANALYST: Hi, Lynda.
 
KINKADE: So, you're a former U.S. Federal Aviation Safety inspector. What is going on? Because it seems like barely a day goes by without another incident involving a major passenger plane.
 
SOUCIE: You know, Lynda, there are a lot of things going on, but, statistically, I've looked at the numbers and it really there hasn't seen a sharp increase in any kind of safety hazards or incidents as compared to last year.
 <br>[03:35:00]
 
So, it really has a lot to do with how these things are happening and not really the increase in number, but how severe they are.
 
Of all the incidents we've had and we've seen in recent weeks, the door plug falling off a plane, a panel flying off a plane, a tire flying off a plane, pilots claiming they temporarily lost control of a flight between Sydney and Auckland, of all those incidents, what concerns you the most? SOUCIE: I'll tell you, Lynda, what concerns me most right now is that all of these incidents we're talking about, they don't have to do with engineering, they don't have to do with maintenance per se, they have to do with individual human beings making errors or bad decisions about things, maybe missed inspection, or perhaps -- we're still not clear about the Auckland flight, whether it was a flight attendant that bumped into a pilot, or whether there was a technical issue, we really don't know at this point, but it points a lot to the human factor that always is present. But it concerns me that right now it seems like there's more and more of these human factor errors going on.
 
KINKADE: And of all these incidents, most affect Boeing planes. Critics say that for too long, Boeing has been able to self-regulate. They have no competition in the U.S., and so generally no one to answer to. How much truth is there to that?
 
SOUCIE: Well, they do answer to the FAA. However, they hadn't been doing that as much as they are now. With the organizational designee program that they had in place, they were able to kind of regulate themselves and decide what things that they do are really safety related or what things need to be double checked.
 
So, now, the FAA has gone back on that and they're much more participating in those types of decisions as to what Boeing is doing on their manufacturing line. And I think that's a step in the right direction, for sure.
 
KINKADE: Yes, definitely. Of course, we know about one whistleblower, John Barnett, who worked for Boeing for 30 years on the 787 Dreamliners. He was found dead, reportedly by suicide. He had claimed that Boeing workers had been pressured to fit substandard parts to aircrafts. He claimed that there were serious issues with the oxygen system, meaning that one in four oxygen masks might not work in an emergency. And overall, he said, because of the rush to get aircraft out, that safety standards at times were compromised. And we know that a 2017 review by the FAA upheld some of those claims.
 
People obviously want to be able to trust the planes that they're flying on, right? What more can be done?
 
SOUCIE: Well, I think the things that are being done right now are really going to make a huge difference. Number one is the more participation by the FAA as far as oversight on the line. What that does is it gives the employees the out or the option to go around their direct line of management, around them to a quality supervisor.
 
Now, Boeing specifically has put in a new quality control person, and Kate, I think, Lund is her last name. But she is there to assure that that is well aware, that the employees are well aware that they can go around their direct supervisor and bring up safety issues. So, that's step one.
 
However, in any manufacturing process, any company, really, you have to be concerned as an employee, I'm bringing up something that can cost the company money. So, it really has to be emphasized and there has to be a safety valve to allow them to do this without any retribution whatsoever, and I think putting Kate in this position at Boeing has really made a big difference, and I think also the FAA being more participating in the line, on the line of assembly is going to make a big difference as well.
 
I'd love to see the fact that they're going back to this more participating role and allowing the employees really to be the quality control, the people that really are there looking at it to say this is an issue, and now they need to be sure they emphasize the ability for them to go around their direct line of supervision and go above them and go straight to who's going to make a difference.
 
KINKADE: And, finally, what would you say to passengers who are seeing all these incidents add up and are concerned now about flying?
 
SOUCIE: Well, I am one of those passengers, as is my granddaughter and everyone else. So, what I would say to them, and I have said to my family, is, again, statistically, flying in an airplane is the safest place to be. It literally is the safest place to travel. And so for that reason, I still go there.
 
Are there ways that can be improved? Are there challenges ahead of us? As technology improves, as things get more and more complex, this concern that I have about the human factors and the human decision- making is going to be an issue.
 
But as I see it right now, today, I don't think there's anything that's concerning to me. I still feel like it's the safest place to be.
 <br>[03:40:00]
 
And the fact that we're bringing all these things to light right now actually to me says a lot. It tells me that there is no longer hidden things going on. There's no longer hidden safety concerns or threats that we don't know about.
 
If there is a safety concern now, we know about it. And that's not how it's been over the last five or six years. But right now, that's how it is. And I think that that's a good thing, that that's being known, that there are safety issues being exposed and that we know about them. But we're still in the safest system of travel that exists today.
 
KINKADE: All right. David Soucie, we will leave it there for now. I appreciate your time. Thanks for joining us.
 
SOUCIE: Of course. Thank you, Lynda.
 
KINKADE: And still to come, Niger ends a strategic military alliance with the United States. Just ahead, why the country's ruling junta says it's ending the agreement that allowed U.S. forces and contractors to operate inside its borders.
 
Plus, Thailand says it has plans to combat its air pollution problem as parts of the country deal with some of the world's worst air quality.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
KINKADE: Welcome back. Niger says it's breaking off its military agreement with the United States. It comes following a three-day visit by a U.S. delegation. The agreement had allowed military personnel and civilian staff from the Defense -- Department of Defense to operate in Niger.
 
But on Saturday, a military spokesperson denounced the accord as unfair. Relations between the two countries have deteriorated since the military seized power last July, ousting the democratically elected president, Mohammed Bazoum.
 
Well, for more on this, I'm joined by CNN International Correspondent Larry Madowo. Good to see you, Larry.
 
So, Niger's coup government says the U.S. military presence is no longer justified. What does this mean? How many U.S. troops are stationed there?
 
LARRY MADOWO, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Let's start with that final one, Lynda. There are 648 U.S. troops who remain in Niger, according to a letter from President Biden to Congress in December. And the wider question, the word that came up a lot in that seven- minute announcement from the Niger military junta was sovereignty. And they feel that the U.S. presence in their country violate their sovereignty.
 
This is a word that you've heard a lot from the military junta, it's not just in Niger, but it was in Burkina Faso, in Mali, in Guinea. It's a common byword because the popular thing to say in these moments. But make no mistake, this is an embarrassing development for the United States, especially because it comes after a high powered U.S. military and diplomatic delegation just left Niger trying to avoid this outcome.
 
And now the Nigerians are saying they don't want the U.S. military and they have to leave immediately. Pay attention.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
COLONEL AMADOU ABDRAMANE, NIGER MILITARY SPOKESPERSON: The government of Niger, taking into account the aspirations and interests of its people, decides with full responsibility to denounce with immediate the effect the agreement relating to the status of military personnel of the United States and civilian employees of the American Department of Defense and the Republic of Niger.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[03:45:10]
 
MADOWO: The Niger military junta also forcefully condemning what they're calling America's condescending attitude to the people of Niger and the threat of reprisals. They say they have a state-to-state deal with Russia to acquire military equipment, to deal with terrorism there. And they condemned some claims from the U.S. delegation that they had signed a similar deal with Iran. They say in their sovereign nation they can do what they want.
 
And the U.S. operates two bases in Niger, including one in Central Niger, which was built at a cost of about $100 million. It's a drone base that's been carrying out operations all across the Sahel region. The belief from the U.S. and many of the western countries is that their presence in Niger was central to their counterterrorism operations, to tackle these armed insurgencies operating all across this region.
 
And so this is a major blow to that, but it's not new. The Niger military junta also kicked out the French military, and they last -- they finished that withdrawal in December. There's a few German and Italian troops that remain in the country, but for the most part, this junta does not like foreign troops on their soil. And they know that's also a popular thing among the population. So, they know doing this helps make them look good with the wider population, Lynda.
 
KINKADE: All right, good explanation. Larry Madowo for us, good to have you on the story, thanks so much.
 
Well, Thailand is trying to find its way out of a thick blanket of smog after one of its top tourist hotspots is recently ranked as having some of the worst air quality in the world.
 
The haze is posing a serious health risk to everyone, especially vulnerable populations like children and the elderly.
 
Our Michael Holmes reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN ANCHOR (voice over): Not the view some tourists had hoped for, a thick layer of smog covering the city of Chiang Mai in Thailand. On a clear day, this overlook is usually a popular photo stop, but haze is once again obscuring the view, perhaps not surprising since Chiang Mai ranks as one of the world's most polluted cities, according to IQAir, a website that monitors air quality.
 
But the smog isn't just unsightly, it's unhealthy. IQAir says the level of cancer-causing pollutants in Chiang Mai's air is more than 20 times higher than World Health Organization guidelines, and people are getting sick from it.
 
A Thai government report says more than 10 million people required treatment for pollution-related illnesses last year, with many people wearing masks to protect themselves.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: On the day that I don't wear a face mask, I'm exposed to pollution. Then I would come home with an allergic rash on my arm. I can't breathe. I have a stuffed nose.
 
HOLMES: In Northern Thailand, high pollution levels are common during the early months of the year, when farmers burn crops to clear the fields.
 
But this year, the government says it's taking steps to curb the problem. Legislation for a Clean Air Act is underway, and Thailand's Prime Minister says he'll impose regulations on crop burning, but didn't give further details.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are going to do what we can to make sure that the air condition is improved.
 
HOLMES: The smog also affecting Thailand's capital, Bangkok, and one of the country's most vulnerable groups, children. Many public schools in Bangkok don't have air purifiers or filtration systems, so students even inside the classroom can be exposed to toxic air.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The humidity in the classroom is high if we close the windows, so that's why we need to leave the windows open. But then pollution dust comes into the room, which causes the children to get sick.
 
Most children have allergies. Many of them have long-term allergies. Some don't really recover from it.
 
HOLMES: There are pilot programs to install purifying air conditioning units in some public schools, equipment that could create healthier classrooms and changes, some parents say, can't come soon enough.

KINKADE: Well, the luck of the Irish is strong this St. Patrick's Day, Ireland celebrates as its defending Six Nation champs take home their sixth title. That's coming up.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[03:51:07]
 
KINKADE: Well, take a look at these pictures, dramatic images coming out of Iceland after a volcano erupted near the capital on Saturday night. You can see the smoke and lava against the night sky. This is the fourth time the volcano has erupted since December.
 
Authorities had warned for weeks that this latest eruption was imminent. Nearby communities had already been evacuated and police declared a state of emergency in the area. No flight disruptions have been reported.
 
Well, celebrations are in full swing this St. Patrick's Day weekend across Ireland as the men's national team won rugby's Six Nations Championship for the second straight year. It was a thrilling, hard- fought final match on Saturday against Scotland, and Ireland held on to win 17-13 in Dublin.
 
World Sport's Patrick Snell has more. PATRICK SNELL, CNN WORLD SPORT ANCHOR: Well, Ireland celebrating back- to-back rugby Six Nations triumphs after an absolutely superb 2024 edition of this tournament, the Irish and their opponents on Saturday Scotland serving up a thriller in front of a packed house in Dublin.
 
Andy Farrell's team knew how much was at stake in this one. It would be a nerdy, tense evening in the Irish capital, but the home fans' nerves were soothed when Dan Sheehan going over much of the light of the home fanfare, Ireland at that point with a one-point advantage at the end of a close-fought first half.
 
And there was more to come from the home side, Andrew Porter scoring a vital try for his country to give the champions some breathing room.
 
But it's never over until it's over, as they say. Scotland making it interesting when Hugh Jones scores a late try, but too little too late in the end for the Scots. Ireland sealing a famous victory, 17 points to 13, and the celebrations in full swing for the Irish on this St Patrick's Day weekend.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDY FARRELL, IRELAND HEAD COACH: Everyone talks about Grand Slams and blah, blah, blah, it's so tough to do that, that's why it's never been done before. Back to back, Six Nations is tough enough within itself, so we're delighted, you know?
 
That's why everyone loves the Six Nations, isn't it, you know, because it's so hard to do the Grand Slams pieces, but we'll take this any day.
 
PETER O'MAHONY, IRELAND CAPTAIN: A special group of people, players, staff. I think that World Cup experience really bonded this group. I know we're missing a couple of guys from that, but, you know, between our families and the group, you know, we're tight and it's a huge honor. It's a huge honor to captain your country. You know, if it was my last one, it's not a bad one to go on, you know what I mean?
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SNELL: Well, another historic achievement for Ireland's men's rugby team who missed out on the Grand Slam for a second straight season. That's when one country beats every other competing nation, but they will be absolutely delighted with this hard-fought victory over the Scots.
 
They become back-to-back Six Nations title winners for just the third time in their history. A wonderful achievement for Andy Farrell's team and our congrats to them. This is Ireland's sixth title as well in the Six Nations era and their fifth in the last 11 years. What an accomplishment.
 
So, here's a look at the final standings. England and France also serving up a thriller on Saturday in their final match, but the English, well, their hopes of winning the title were over as soon as Ireland beat Scotland. Italy beating Wales in their final match to end up in fifth place for their most successful Six Nations campaign ever after two wins and a draw. Wales end up bottom of the table, they get the wooden spoon.
 
As you can imagine, the party in full swing on this St. Patrick's Day weekend in Ireland. And with that, it's right back to you.
 
KINKADE: Our thanks to Patrick Snell.
 
Well, St. Patrick's Day celebrations in New York City and Chicago left the two cities seeing green. In the Big Apple, large crowds lined the streets, decked in green Saturdays, marching bands, performers and politicians walked the parade route to celebrate Irish heritage, along with the New York City Fire and Police.
 <br>[03:55:04]
 
And in Chicago, the windy city's world-renowned St. Patrick's Day event drew thousands of spectators from across the globe, with the Chicago River glowing emerald green. It is a tradition that goes back nearly 70 years, courtesy of the city's Plumbers Union dying the river green each year.
 
Well, this is possibly the video of the week, a teenager trying to catch some air at a skiing competition wound up almost catching a ski chairlift.
 
CNN's Ginny Moore shows you his spectacular wipeout that has the internet buzzing.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JEANNE MOOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): It was a little like one of those James Bond ski chases, like when 007 skied over a picnic table. Only 17-year-old Ivan Jones was just trying to do a move called the Flat Spin 360, when he almost landed on the chair lift.
 
Of course, everyone wanted to know, were you injured?
 
IVAN JONES, 17-YEAR-OLD SKIER: I definitely felt very beat up, mild concussion, I was quite sore.
 
MOOS: But Ivan was able to ski down the mountain at the Lake Louise Resort in Canada to get checked out by the ski patrol. So, close to landing on the actual seat, maybe next time, was a typical comment, but Ivan said he had no intention of trying that. He thought it would be impossible to hit the chairlift until he did.
 
JONES: When I hit the chairlift, I was actually in shock, so I didn't feel anything.
 
MOOS: His mom, Mindy, was off skiing when she got the call that her son had hit the chairlift.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I was very grateful to see him in person before seeing the video because the video is pretty awful. MOOS: As the video went viral, jokesters added audio.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's dreamed about this his whole life. Oh, (BLEEP). That is not good.
 
MOOS: Lake Louise Resort told CNN it does not condone what happened. Imagine a view from the chair full of steers coming up the lift. And instead of just wondering how Ivan fared -- I'm like, is the chairlift okay?
 
You'd be giggling too if you survived this.
 
Jeanne Moos, CNN, New York.

KINKADE: Millions of people have now seen that video online and, of course, it's going viral, but, thankfully, he is okay.
