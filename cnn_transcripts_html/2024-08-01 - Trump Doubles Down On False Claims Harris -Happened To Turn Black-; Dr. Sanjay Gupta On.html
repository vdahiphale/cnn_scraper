 <br>[07:32:35]
 
OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN ANCHOR:  Kamala Harris is dismissing Donald Trump's false claims about her racial identity and heritage as the same divisive and disrespectful rhetoric he's been using for years. Now, he said she just happened to turn Black a few years ago to gain political points, and he's doubling down on those claims.
 
Joining me now are CNN political commentators Bakari Sellers and Shermichael Singleton. Gentlemen, good to see you.
 
Bakari, I'm half Colombian, but for the purposes of this panel, I guess I will be Black. How do you think Vice President Harris handled her response of Trump?
 
BAKARI SELLERS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, (D) FORMER SOUTH CAROLINA STATE REPRESENTATIVE (via Webex by Cisco):  No, I think that this is an amazing moment in American TV history because we can all tell the audience to the time we turned Black. For me, it was about '99, 2000 when I first heard Juvenile's "Back That Azz Up" and it had a rhythmic cadence to my dance. At that moment, I knew I was Black.
 
But look, I just think Kamala did what she was supposed to do. Like, you've got to be a leader focused on the future. You've got to be a leader focused on tomorrow. And that's what she -- that's what she's doing.
 
For me -- and I've said this a number of times, and it bears repeating -- not everyone who supports Donald Trump is a racist and we can't lump people together like that. But I can say that Donald Trump is a racist. And I can say that he uses racism as political currency. 
 
And just the shear audacity to go into the National Association of Black Journalists in their convention, in front of their face -- in front of three journalists who did the best they could do yesterday -- or two of three did the best they could do yesterday -- and insult a Black woman in that manner, I just think it is a place where this country doesn't want to go back. And that's why Kamala Harris keeps saying we're not going back to that.
 
JIMENEZ:  And Shermichael, what was your first reaction when you heard -- one, obviously saw how this panel unfolded overall, but also in this specific instance of falsely accusing Harris of deciding to -- deciding to turn Black?
 
SHERMICHAEL SINGLETON, CNN POLITIAL ANALYST, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Look, I think Kadia asked some very great questions. I think Harris Faulker at Fox News asked some very pertinent questions about the economy, about his vice presidential pick. A little bit of news was sort of made there with his response.
 
Overall, though, I just wish this were not the topic we were discussing this morning, Omar. I mean, I would prefer to stick with talking about immigration, the economy, cost of living, and inflation. 
 <br>[07:35:00]
 
I would prefer to talk about Vice President Harris attempting to moderate and reversing a bunch of her positions on the federal jobs guarantee, which was a part of the Green New Deal, or her pivoting on law enforcement, or her pivoting on her immigration stance. 
 
I mean, those are the things that I think the vast majority of Republicans would prefer to talk about because I think most of them would argue that as a party writ large, the party is a lot stronger when talking about those issues and making their case to the American people.
 
So I think when you -- when you get into issues of race or identity, ethnicity, I really think you're losing. And I think you're losing, potentially, because there are some swing voters that you're going to have to reach out to. 
 
You're going to have to penetrate those voters with a palatable message to convince them to come back to the Republican side. We lost quite a few of them in 2020. We lost quite a few of them over the past two years because of reproductive rights. We're going to have to gain some of those voters back, and I'm not certain talking about this and focusing on these issues as a party writ large is helpful when I think the party wins on all of the other saleable policy fronts.
 
JIMENEZ:  And Bakari, on that point -- because look, there has been some criticism from Republicans that Kamala Harris is just riding out campaign stops. That she hasn't faced tough questions on some of those positions that have changed from when she was running for president previously to now.
 
How do you combat that perspective? And less than 100 days out, how much does she need to?
 
SELLERS:  She's going out and meeting people where they are. I mean, she was, last night, in Houston with the Sigma Gamma Rho. Today she's speaking at the funeral of Sheila Jackson Lee. You saw her in Atlanta, Georgia. Next week she's going to the voters in every single swing state that there is with her vice president.
 
Look, if you want her to sit down for an interview, I hear you. But the fact is she's actually going out where it matters. We have 100 days and she's going out to meet voters where they are. In terms of her record, look, it is what it is. I mean, she has grown a lot since 2020. Her record also encompasses the successes of the Biden administration. Her record also encompasses her successes as attorney general and district attorney. 
 
And when she comes out and she says that the person who killed -- if you want to talk about the border, the person who killed the toughest immigration bill that we've had in recent history was Donald Trump. And she's going to sign that bill on day one. She's going to codify Roe on day one. She's going to do things like make sure that she doesn't raise taxes on individuals who make less than $400,000. 
 
Look, if you want to have a policy debate, Shermichael, I wholeheartedly agree with you. But tell your boy to show up on ABC on September 10 and we can have that policy debate. Because right now, he hasn't agreed to it. 
 
JIMENEZ:  And Shermichael --
 
SINGLETON:  Well look, Bakari, I certainly would not advise him to agree to it. I don't think there's a whole lot of benefit for the former president to debate Vice President Harris. I'm just being honest. I think he needs to stick to the issues with his voters and we'll see what happens in November.
 
JIMENEZ:  And look, Shermichael, on the points that you were making earlier -- I mean, look, that's something even Speaker Mike Johnson has talked about, essentially telling members --
 
SINGLETON:  Yeah.
 
JIMENEZ:  -- to stop this line of attack here.
 
So if you're -- if you're strategizing with Trump's team right now -- I mean, you've already seen him double down on it, so I'm sure you --
 
SINGLETON:  Yeah.
 
JIMENEZ:  -- would have told him not to do that. But what is the first legitimate move that you do moving forward to try and make inroads with some of the voters that you know are going to determine the election?
 
SINGLETON:  I mean, look, the campaign, for the most part, has, I would argue, been somewhat effective on releasing some ads and really hitting the vice president on the immigration front. That's still, like, a top-two, top-three issues for voters. We know that. The economy and cost of living is a big deal.
 
I'm looking at what's occurring in Venezuela right now with Maduro. I'm wondering if we'll potentially see individuals leaving and attempting to come to the U.S. That can make immigration a bigger issue, you know, maybe 60 days out. 
 
I'm looking at what's going on with Israel and potentially, Iran now. College students will be back on campuses in a couple of weeks. Will those protests come back? I think that's another vulnerability for the vice president.
 
So I think there are a litany of things, strategically speaking, that Republicans and the former president should be focused on in terms of policies. But I think --
 
JIMENEZ:  Yeah.
 
SINGLETON:  -- Omar, we've seen for about a year now where a lot of the poll numbers -- voters say they trust the former president on a list -- a litany of these issues -- a litany of these fronts. And yet again --
 
JIMENEZ:  Yeah.
 
SINGLETON:  -- here we are, Bakari and I, having to talk about having to talk about these issues instead of debating each other on why Republicans versus Democrats are better or not as great on certain topics. That's what I think the American people actually want.
 
JIMENEZ:  Yeah -- you know, and we will see if it gets to that point. Right now, we are still very midst -- very much in the middle of arguing about who is Black and when. But it'll potentially change a little bit later on.
 
Bakari Sellers, Shermichael Singleton, really appreciate it -- Kate.
 
SINGLETON:  Thanks, Omar.
 
KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR:  Things Omar never thought he would ever have to say, arguing about who is Black when it comes to our lives and politics today.
 <br>[07:40:00]
 
Let's focus on this now. Another big day is underway in Paris as Team USA goes for more gold in several events.
 
Simone Biles will compete again today, this time in the gymnastics individual all-around final. She is hoping to add to her now eight Olympic medal count: five of them gold medals.
 
Team USA's Katie Ledecky is also back in the pool today for the four by 200-meter freestyle relay. She won her eighth swimming gold and her first gold of these games with a record-setting performance in the 1,500-meter freestyle yesterday. She won that race -- you know, this is like milliseconds is how people win in the Olympics. She won that race, incredibly, with a lead of more than 10 seconds -- unreal.
 
And with these games you may start wondering, especially when it comes to Simone Biles and Katie Ledecky, how do these athletes do this? Are they just superhuman? The answer is yes. 
 
But then there's Dr. Sanjay Gupta, another superhuman, jumping into this. He's kind of leaning into this question for another episode of your "Chasing Life" podcast. And it's one of those things --
 
DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah.
 
BOLDUAN:  -- to compete at this level -- and we're showing these amazing -- just images cycling through on the wall -- you clearly have to be at top -- at peak physical condition. But there's a mental component to it --
 
GUPTA:  Yes.
 
BOLDUAN:  -- as well, Sanjay, and this is what you're exploring.
 
GUPTA:  Yeah, I -- first of all, I mean, Katie Ledecky -- I mean, that is just next level, right? I mean, so no matter what -- no matter how you analyze it physically or mentally, that's just next level.
 
But I think the point that you're making is a -- is a really important one. You have these really, really highly trained physical athletes. What separates them now on the world's highest stage?
 
Yogi Berra once said you can't hit and think at the same time. He was -- he was, of course, talking about baseball but I think it applies here as well.
 
How you actually sort of just, in some ways, compartmentalize and perform on the world's highest stage is a pretty remarkable thing mentally.
 
Dominque Dawes, gymnast and part of the Magnificent Seven in the 1996 Olympics -- I got a chance to interview her for the podcast. Really fascinating. 
 
She was 19 years old when she was competing at that point. Forty thousand people. She had never really done anything on -- with that sort of size audience before. She had a lot of things going on at home. Her parents were going through this divorce. She was trying to compete.
 
And what she had to do was compartmentalize. She knew she could do things physically but then it was a question of almost learning how to turn the mind off.
 
Listen to what she said.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GUPTA:  How do you navigate that sort of pressure, given everything that we've just talked about? You know, your previous and earlier stumbles, things like that. What do you do? Is it a physical sort of navigating of the pressure? Is it all mental? 
 
DOMINIQUE DAWES, 3-TIME OLYMPIAN, 4-TIME OLYMPIC MEDALIST:  It's all mental. At that point at the Olympic Games, physically, you already know what to do. Your muscles have memories. You've done those tumbling passes, that dance routine, thousands and thousands of times. You don't want to overthink things. So it becomes very mental where you don't want to overanalyze things. My coach used to always say, analysis paralysis. I would try to
 
 overthink things and need to control things, but I had practiced so many hours and days and years in the gym that my body already knew what to do. It just needed to go on autopilot.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GUPTA:  Yeah, so that's the thing. Again, they have to really count on the fact that their physical preparation is adequate, but their mental preparation is what it takes.
 
I'll tell you something interesting. The cognitive scientists I spoke to about this, Kate -- they said that many of these athletes, when it comes to swimming, for example -- they've broken these records in their home pools away from the huge crowds. The question for them is can they replicate that same thing when they're actually at the Olympics?
 
BOLDUAN:  And then, what happens when this mental component slips, and what are the tricks? It's easy to say compartmentalize, but how?
 
GUPTA:  Everyone chokes. That was another theme that came about in the podcast. These cognitive scientists say it happens to everybody. Everyone will choke in some way. So you have to sort prepare ahead of time to try and reduce the chances of choking as much as possible recognizing that it happens, even to the world's best athletes. 
 
But I think there were some real lessons in here -- I think for athletes but also for everyone else -- in terms of preventing that. They key again, don't overthink things. Our prefrontal cortex tends to analyze every single thing. In some ways, you're shutting off that component of your brain.
 
There is something known as the "recency effect," which can go both ways, meaning that if you just had a great play, you're going to sort of remember that great play and try and replicate that. But if you had a terrible play, that can start to overwhelm you as well. So having a next-play mentality -- that's really important. 
 
Reflect on the loss. Actually spend a little time reflecting on the loss so that you don't actually get overwhelmed by it in the future. And then finally, practice how you play, whether in your pool at home or you're on the Olympic stage. You've got to practice as if you're on the world's biggest stage.
 <br>[07:45:02]
 
BOLDUAN:  Another line of work that I have -- that I have seen is amazing at compartmentalization because of the high stress that they're in all the time, surgeons, physicians, doctors, especially neurosurgeons. A genius -- a mental giant you are.
 
GUPTA:  We do like to think about things, though. 
 
BOLDUAN:  Oh, no.
 
GUPTA:  We get it -- we don't -- we don't --
 
BOLDUAN:  It's just autopilot when you have your hand in my brain. It's just autopilot. 
 
It's great to see you, Sanjay. Thank you so much. 
 
GUPTA:  You got it.
 
BOLDUAN:  And a reminder. You can hear more of Sanjay's "Chasing Life" podcast available wherever you get your podcasts.
 
Coming up for us, the terrifying moment a toddler falls down a 12-foot hole in the family's yard. The lengths that officers went to try to rescue this little guy. He is -- he is OK, fortunately, and we have the video of the whole thing.
 
We'll be right back.
 
(COMMERCIAL)
 
BOLDUAN:  As the Politico Playbook put it this morning, "So much for the 'new' Trump."
 <br>[07:50:00]
 
In the days after the attempt on his life, Donald Trump said he was changed. He called for people to tone it down. He said he wanted to unify. But then came Donald Trump of yesterday really removing any doubt that Donald Trump of 2024 is the same Donald Trump of 2015 through 2020, not taking on his political opponent on the issues; instead, deciding to attack her personally -- not just at the conference of Black journalists yesterday but also at his campaign rally hours later.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  She's an extreme radical- left lunatic. Everything about Kamala Harris' rollout, it's phony and it's fake. Did you see when President Obama and Michelle called to just say hello, hello. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOLDUAN:  And it's clearly not a one-off. Trump double down on this on social media, and J.D. Vance backed him up on the personal attacks at his own rally yesterday, which makes this headline in The New York Times today all the more interesting. "My Fellow Republicans: Stop the Trash Talk."
 
Joining me now is the author of this New York Times bestselling article --
 
GOV. CHRIS SUNUNU, (R) NEW HAMPSHIRE:  Bestselling -- I like that.
 
BOLDUAN:  -- Gov. Chris Sununu. It's great to see you, Governor.
 
SUNUNU:  Good to be here.
 
BOLDUAN:  Let me read your own words --
 
SUNUNU:  OK.
 
BOLDUAN:  -- to yourself to you because you literally wrote -- this piece is essentially saying, like, capital letters -- STOP --
 
SUNUNU:  Yeah.
 
BOLDUAN:  -- to your party.
 
Here is what you say. "The path to victory in November is not won through character attacks or personal insults. In fact, those attacks won't bring a single new voter onboard. Catchy one-liners calling Vice President Harris a bum, not a serious person, and bottom of the barrel might rile up the base, but they do nothing to connect with Independent voters needing to close the deal in November."
 
And you say it's not just distracting, it's not just wasted time, it's time lost.
 
SUNUNU:  Yeah.
 
BOLDUAN:  But, but, but, but, but, but, but you have said many times before no one can get Donald Trump to do anything.
 
SUNUNU:  Yeah.
 
BOLDUAN:  So --
 
SUNUNU:  Yeah. Unfortunately, we know that, right? Nobody can tell Donald Trump what to do or what to say or what to tweet.
 
The one thing that my hope is -- and again, this is all based on one thing -- winning, right? This is about elections. This is about winning. And I want Republicans to win.
 
But the one thing he will respond to maybe is polls, right? Because if -- I've sat with him before, and he'll spend half the conversation or more -- what are my poll numbers? Where are the polls? What are you hearing in the poll? Poll, polls. So if he can't -- he has to be seeing the poll numbers slip.
 
And so my message is there's so much to win on. There's so much to win on when you talk about policy, immigration, inflation -- the issues that Americans care about. Just connect with them on that and this thing is extremely winnable. But he's got to get back to it.
 
BOLDUAN:  But I was looking back at our past conversations. I mean, you just said -- in the conversation you had this weekend, you were asked, "What would you say to those people who said Harris was a DEI hire?" You were asked this just this weekend. And you said, "That is not helpful at all --
 
SUNUNU:  No, no. BOLDUAN:  -- to say." That's exactly your point in this piece.
 
But if 2024 does look like, in terms of the commentary on the campaign trail and what voters are going to end up hearing --
 
SUNUNU:  Um-hum.
 
BOLDUAN:  -- no matter how often you talk about the issues or a surrogate --
 
SUNUNU:  Um-hum.
 
BOLDUAN:  -- talks about the issues -- if it looks a lot like 2015, 2016, 2019, 2020, what does that mean for you guys?
 
SUNUNU:  Yeah, if nothing changes, you're going to hand something over to Vice President Harris who, frankly, hasn't earned it on the issues. I don't think she's earned it on the issues. I think her administration is extremely problematic.
 
Lord knows, I've said a lot of things about Donald Trump. I stick by every one of them.
 
BOLDUAN:  Yeah.
 
SUNUNU:  I'm going to vote for him. I think a lot of us are going to hold our nose and vote because I want a Republican administration that believes in less government and local control, and all of those things. So we need to win.
 
And so the message isn't just for Donald Trump. I know -- I have no misgivings. I don't think Donald Trump is going to sit there and read my op-ed. But for the surrogates. For the other governors. For the other candidates, right?
 
You know, we talk about J.D. Vance, right?
 
BOLDUAN:  Yeah.
 
SUNUNU:  He's a -- he seems to have -- he's young. He seems to have surrounded himself with folks that say hey, kind of be like Trump. Be Trump-like. But he's missing -- again, that's the time lost -- an amazing opportunity in the next 100 days to connect with folks on his lived experience, which is pretty amazing, by the way. Poverty, these issues that people are really struggling with. To have somebody in the White House that has lived those kind of struggles and make that connection.
 
But they're missing out. They're missing the opportunity. So get back to the issues and win this thing.
 
BOLDUAN:  On J.D. Vance, I want to play -- it was -- it was interesting yesterday when he -- when Trump was at NABJ, and he was asked about the things J.D. Vance is saying. The childless cat ladies -- cat peoples. SUNUNU:  Is that polling yet? Is that up in a poll, the childless cat ladies? Is that a top issue for Americans? I haven't seen it yet but, you know, obviously, it's not going to make it.
 
BOLDUAN:  And maybe, but what is does --
 
SUNUNU:  So we shouldn't be talking about it.
 
BOLDUAN:  And what it does is it speaks to -- it speaks to what is he saying in the past, what are his priorities --
 
SUNUNU:  Yeah.
 
BOLDUAN:  -- and how -- if they're going to personally attack Kamala Harris they're going to get it back at them, right?
 
Donald Trump is asked about J.D. Vance and his attacks on people. And I want to play what Donald Trump said in response because I want you to help me --
 
SUNUNU:  Sure.
 
BOLDUAN:  -- decipher for us -- decipher it.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I've always had great respect for him and for the other candidates, too. But I will say this -- and I think this is well-documented -- historically, the vice president, in terms of the election, does not have any impact. I mean, virtually no impact. You have two or three days where there's a lot of commotion as to who -- like, you're having it on the Democrat's side -- who it's going to be. And then that dies down and it's all about the presidential pick.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOLDUAN:  It's not a ringing endorsement of this guy is really going to help me push it over the edge.
 
SUNUNU:  No. I --
 
BOLDUAN:  Do you think it -- do you think there is a universal possibility he would be reconsidering his VP?
 
SUNUNU:  No, no. You can't reconsider him at this point, nor should he override it. It would create division within the party, and it would -- it would -- it would not build that momentum that they carried through the convention.
 
I actually agree with him in that point that it's very rare that a vice presidential pick -- it's interesting. It's media fodder.
 
The one exception, believe it or not, is Vice President Harris' potential pick. If she were to pick Josh Shapiro, let's say, in Pennsylvania, now Pennsylvania is really in play and that could actually bleed over to Michigan. Those are huge swing states. If she could win back those states now, the Republicans are really in trouble. It's one of the few examples.
 
But for the most part, we know Trump -- if you're with him, you're with him. If you're not, you're not. There's about 10 percent of the voters out there that are still undecided. There's Democrats that I've talked to directly that have said look, I have never voted for Donald Trump. And I want to change with this administration but he's making it so difficult.
 
And that's what really drove me to do this. I was at the gym working out and I had a bunch of people say we've never voted. We want to vote for the Republicans and they're making it hard --
 
BOLDUAN:  And there's a -- there's a "but" after that.
 
SUNUNU:  -- because it's this barrier they can't get beyond, which is understandable, on the personal attacks.
 
So I think if they can -- if he can clean that up, capitalize on the next 100 days and not miss another -- every day matters, right? I mean, the clock's ticking here, guys. Every single day matters.
 
BOLDUAN:  Because it's not -- well, people would like to say that -- and I actually heard you say it, too. Like, after Labor Day, it's when everyone heads back to school. We're back in full swing and that's when people are going to pay attention.
 
SUNUNU:  That's right.
 
BOLDUAN:  But this time feels different. I mean, people -- the earliest voting --
 
SUNUNU:  Yeah.
 
BOLDUAN:  -- starts in September. Like, who --
 
SUNUNU:  No. Well, again, the Democratic Party just -- they pushed Biden out. I think there's going to be this honeymoon period of about 30 days. I think the Democrat convention will be fairly unifying.
 
BOLDUAN:  I'm stopping you there --
 
SUNUNU:  Yeah.
 
BOLDUAN:  -- because you're about to give me your crystal ball predictions --
 
SUNUNU:  Yeah.
 
BOLDUAN:  -- because I actually want to go back to one of your past crystal ball predictions.
 
SUNUNU:  Sure.
 
BOLDUAN:  You have a scary history of predicting the future on this show -- while you were on the show. I would like to play one moment --
 
SUNUNU:  Oh.
 
BOLDUAN:  -- when you and I were speaking at -- when I was at the -- I was at the Republican Convention. You just said -- you did not come to Milwaukee --
 
SUNUNU:  That's right.
 
BOLDUAN:  -- but you did say this -- listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SUNUNU:  As soon as the convention is done, around Monday-Tuesday, all the attention is going to focus right on Joe Biden. So I still very much believe Biden will not be the nominee. Kamala Harris will be there. And my warning to Republicans is don't take that for granted. That's not an easy race. If Kamala were smart, she's going to pick a Republican -- a Democrat governor, like a Shapiro or Andy Beshear -- something like that.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOLDUAN:  That was the Thursday of the convention. The only thing you got wrong was it wasn't Monday or Tuesday when Joe Biden stepped aside; it was Sunday.
 
SUNUNU:  It was Sunday.
 
BOLDUAN:  It was Sunday --
 
SUNUNU:  I was off by about 24 hours.
 
BOLDUAN:  -- which is -- you know, you're not allowed to come back again --
 
SUNUNU:  Yeah.
 
BOLDUAN:  -- until you get it right.
 
So what does your crystal ball say now, realistically?
 
SUNUNU:  Uh, a neck-and-neck race post the -- post-Labor Day.
 
BOLDUAN:  Yeah.
 
SUNUNU:  It will get back to issues. Vice President Harris has a lot to answer. Her administration has a lot to answer for -- everything from immigration and policy.
 
I still think that the Democrats have a huge problem in that Democrat voters voted for Joe Biden. Joe Biden didn't want to get out of this race, clearly. But it took three phone calls on a Thursday and all of a sudden, he was pushed out, which -- when you talk about threats to democracy -- I mean, you have a couple of elites in Washington that said we understand the voters voted for you, Mr. President, but we're going -- we don't think they got it right. We're going to push him out.
 
BOLDUAN:  You're not going to call it a coup like I've been hearing from --
 
SUNUNU:  No, no, no -- not like that.
 
But I'm concerned about the precedent. I mean, doesn't that tell people don't bother voting? A couple of elites will decide right before they -- right around the convention who the nominee really should be. That's a concern.
 
We want people to vote. I want everyone to vote. I'm not here to tell people to vote for Donald Trump. Vote for whoever you want. Please vote, right? Don't sit it out. It's a huge privilege to vote.
 
But I am -- what I try to do is explain what's happening on the ground.
 
BOLDUAN:  Yeah.
 
SUNUNU:  And people saw what happened and said whoa, that ain't right, right? Nobody voted for this person.
 
So it's not the only issue but I think it's one issue that will come back to haunt them a little bit as you go down the path. As they try to say Trump's a threat to democracy. It's very easy to hit that ball right back across the net and say whoa, whoa, whoa -- you guys just literally pushed a president aside when he didn't want to go.
 
BOLDUAN:  And that gets us back to the actual issues.
 
SUNUNU:  Get back to the issues. And you know what? That's what Americans want.
 
BOLDUAN:  Yeah.
 
SUNUNU:  That's what they deserve.
 
BOLDUAN:  All right. So you're not allowed to come back until after Labor Day so now I can test your crystal ball during then.
 
SUNUNU:  They can test my crystal ball.
 
BOLDUAN:  Right.
 
Good to see you, Governor. Thank you for coming in.
 
SUNUNU:  Thank you so much.
 
BOLDUAN:  Omar.
 
JIMENEZ:  I look forward to that test. We do, too.
 
Meanwhile, tricking concertgoers with bait-and-switch ticket prices and junk fees. This morning, those are the accusations in a new lawsuit against StubHub filed by Washington, D.C.'s attorney general. CNN's Matt Egan joins us now. All right, Matt, what are we learning
