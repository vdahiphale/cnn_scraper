ELENI GIOKOS, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  I'm Eleni Giokos live from Abu Dhabi. This is CONNECT THE WORLD. 
 
Coming up this hour, eight people are wounded after a driver rammed into pedestrians in Tel Aviv. Hamas has claimed responsibility. This comes as 
 
 thousands of Palestinians flee the Jenin refugee camp. Israel is pressing ahead with its largest military operation there in more than two decades. 
 
Russia carries out more strikes in Ukraine as it claims to fend off an attempted Ukrainian attack near Moscow. 
 
And CNN sits down exclusively with tennis legend Roger Federer. For the first time he has spoken about his retirement. 
 
(MUSIC PLAYING)
 
GIOKOS:  We begin with what Israeli police are calling a terror attack in Tel Aviv. They say a car rammed a number of pedestrians near a shopping 
 
 center, injuring eight people. The Palestinian Islamic Jihad is praising the Tel Aviv attack, saying it comes in response to what is happening in 
 
 the Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank. 
 
Live pictures here of Jenin; Israeli forces say no non combatants have been killed during their ongoing raid, now in its second day. Palestinian 
 
 officials say at least 10 people have lost their lives as Israel carries out what it calls counterterrorism activities. Let's go to Tel Aviv and 
 
 CNN's Hadas Gold, who is live at the scene of the car ramming. 
 
Hadas, could you give us a sense of what is going on right now?
 
Of course, we've heard that Hamas claimed responsibility for this attack. 
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Eleni. We are in a northwest Tel Aviv, where exactly this attack took place. They've already 
 
 cleared the truck that was used in this ramming attack. We saw the truck ourselves; it was very badly damaged. The windshield was smashed. 
 
Windshield was smashed, its entire front of the truck was ripped off. And as you can see behind me, this bus stop was also badly damaged as well. 
 
 Israeli police are saying that the car mounted the pavement here, rammed into several pedestrians, who were standing here, and then the attacker got 
 
 out of the car and began stabbing people. 
 
An armed civilian, who happened to be on the scene, heard the noise, turned around and shot and killed the attacker. We know that at least eight people 
 
 have been injured as a result of this attack. One of them is critically injured. 
 
And the attacker has now been claimed as a member of Hamas, the military group saying that he is one of their fighters and saying it is in direct 
 
 response to what we are seeing going on in Jenin. 
 
Of course, that is in its second day of operation. The Israeli military is undertaking its largest military operation there since 2002, since the days 
 
 of the Second Intifada. And overnight, it has been a little quieter than it was a night before. 
 
The Israeli military saying it is reaching every corner of the refugee camps. Their goal, they say, is to essentially reform the refugee camp from 
 
 being a hornets' nest, they say, for militants' activity. We know 10 people have been killed in the refugee camp. 
 
The Israeli military claiming that all of those killed, that no non- combatants have been killed or all of those killed were armed or were engaging with their soldiers in some way. But the Israeli military is 
 
 acknowledging that, amongst the 100 people injured, at least some of them are civilians. 
 
They are also acknowledging problems with electricity and water in the refugee camp as a result of the extensive damage we are seeing in the camp. 
 
 And overnight, thousands of people, thousands of Palestinians are leaving the refugee camp, evacuating out of fear of what is to come. 
 
Because as it has been described by one of the locals, there they are saying it looks like a natural disaster hit the refugee camp. That is why 
 
 people are leaving, out of fear of what is to come next. The Israeli military saying they will continue this operation as long as it is 
 
 necessary. 
 
It could take another few days, they say, before they believe they have reached all of their objectives. Eleni.
 
GIOKOS:  That is Hadas, Gold thank you so much for that update. 
 
My next guest is Lynn Hastings.
 <br>[10:05:00]
 
GIOKOS:  She is the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for the occupied Palestinian Territories. She tweets that she is alarmed by the scale of 
 
 Israeli forces in Jenin. She says that airstrikes were used in the densely populated refugee camp, leaving several dead and critically injured. She 
 
 says that access to all injured must be ensured. 
 
Lynn Hastings joins us live now via Skype from Jerusalem. 
 
Lynn, we just heard from Hadas Gold, saying that it looks like a huge disaster within the refugee camp. 
 
Could you give me a sense of what is going on right now, the impact on the people living there? 
 
We know that thousands have been evacuated. 
 
LYNN HASTINGS, U.N. HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR FOR PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES:  Yes, thanks for having me on. So as I understand it, you've been showing 
 
 your audience some of the pictures. 
 
And certainly some of the pictures I've seen, and we have a team up there right now --
 
(AUDIO GAP) 
 
HASTINGS:  -- it could've been a natural disaster. Of course, along with that has come damage both to the electricity grid and to water pipes. 
 
So the majority of the people who are in and living in the Jenin refugee camp no longer have access to either electricity or the water. So that is 
 
 something that is of immediate concern to us. 
 
And we need to be able to get in and do proper assessments and start providing humanitarian assistance. And we are hoping that the municipal 
 
 workers will be able to get in as well on the ground, to fix both the water pipes and the electricity grid. 
 
I do just want to highlight that right now -- sorry, go ahead?
 
GIOKOS:  Yes, please, go ahead. We have time. 
 
HASTINGS:  Yes, I was just going to say I would like to highlight to your viewers that the conflict is ongoing right now. We are receiving reports 
 
 from our team on the ground that one of the hospitals is under attack with tear gas. 
 
That means that the patients have actually left the hospital. The emergency ward is empty and people are fleeing the hospitals. 
 
Now under international law, of course, the Israeli forces are required to protect humanitarian or civilian installations, which of course, includes 
 
 hospitals. We have been seeing tear gas used in civilian areas over the past couple of days. This is a large concern for us as well. 
 
GIOKOS:  It is concerning to hear these reports, of course, the idea that you are saying that they have very precise targeting, that they are 
 
 focusing only on terror hotspots. 
 
What is your understanding of the reporting that we have seen, specifically, on hospitals and schools in particular?
 
This is, obviously, as you're saying, of grave concern. 
 
HASTINGS:  Yes, definitely the use of airstrikes, which I think your reporter mentioned, it is the first time that the U.N. has recorded it 
 
 since 2005. So there was an earlier operation in June and then another one now, where airstrikes have been used. 
 
This is a --
 
(AUDIO GAP) 
 
HASTINGS:  -- very -- regardless of any level of precision, we really need to be looking at proportionality and whether or not other mechanisms could 
 
 have been used. Obviously, airstrikes are going to result in significant damage to civilian infrastructure. 
 
GIOKOS:  Yes, we are battling with your sound a little. So pardon me if I repeat some of what you say. I just want to take a step back here and I 
 
 want to look at the Oslo Accords and whether they are in violation right now. 
 
What is going on at the higher level here? 
 
HASTINGS:  Yes, I don't think I'd be able to respond exactly in terms of violations of Oslo Accords. What I can say is that counterterrorism's 
 
 operations don't actually change any legal framework because of the objective of the operation. 
 
Those who are engaged in the counteroffensive, they are still required to comply with international law. 
 
And of course one issue that you may be wanting to be addressed under the Oslo Accords is Jenin is in, what we, call Area A, which is under exclusive 
 
 jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority, both for administrative reasons and security reasons. And we have been seeing more and more of these types 
 
 of operations by the Israelis into Area A. 
 
GIOKOS:  What we also know is that security coordination has not been happening between the two parties, right?
 
I think if we take a look at what is happened in 2002 versus what we see now -- 
 <br>[10:10:00]
 
GIOKOS:  -- the Palestinian Authority is not involved in these raids. 
 
Is that of concern that, basically, we are not seeing contact between the IDF and the PA?
 
HASTINGS:  So the Palestinian Authority has come out over the past two days and said that it will stop all security coordination. Security coordination 
 
 had already have been at a very, very low level. 
 
Of course, it is always a concern when parties to conflict are refusing to speak to each other and coordinate. So this is something that we will need 
 
 to be taking a look at in terms of how to get the coordination back up and running, so these sorts of issues are avoided. 
 
GIOKOS:  Yes, so let's talk about the people that have been evacuated. Around 3,000 people, from what we understand; we are seeing empty streets, 
 
 basically. Some of the images that we are getting through. 
 
What more do you know about the relocations and where these people are going?
 
HASTINGS:  Yes, so currently, what we understand is that the people who are leaving, especially yesterday, they were going to public places like 
 
 hospitals, which now, of course, we are hearing reports that one of the hospitals at least is under attack with tear gas. 
 
They've also sought safety with families and friends, which is often the case when these sorts of operations take place. So essentially, people are 
 
 trying to find safety wherever they can and, obviously, access to drinking water and electricity and food. 
 
GIOKOS:  I also want to just take a look at the casualties. We're seeing 10 people that have lost their lives. The Israelis saying right now that most 
 
 of these people, their profile falls under what they were targeting. 
 
We don't know exactly who they are. But on the other end, we are hearing that some civilians might have lost their lives. 
 
What is your understanding right now on the people that have died during these raids?
 
HASTINGS:  What I can say is that three of the people who have died, three of the 10 Palestinians that were killed, are children. And children should 
 
 never be a target, regardless of the accusations or allegations against them. 
 
Now it is very difficult, obviously, for us to know whether or not people are militants or not and it is something that the U.N. tries to do, usually 
 
 after the escalations occur. But I would not want to speak to that right now, because we do need to have time to verify. 
 
And then, of course, now we are looking at 120 people being injured and will, again, have to take a look at who was injured, et cetera. But I think 
 
 the numbers probably speak for themselves. 
 
GIOKOS:  Within the last hour, we've had this attack in Tel Aviv of cars (ph) landing into people, Hamas taking responsibility. 
 
Are you concerned that this is a sign of how inflamed the situation can get, that more violence is looming?
 
HASTINGS:  Yes. So I just first want to say that, of course, the U.N. condemns any attacks on any civilians. And that is why we are concerned 
 
 about the entire situation. And we don't condone any type of violence in any form. 
 
These situations here, I'm sure if you've been watching the Israeli- Palestinian situation for years, this is quite often what happens. The tensions rise; there is escalations from different parts of the Palestinian 
 
 Territory or within Israel. 
 
So yes, it is obviously a concern. What happened in Tel Aviv today, as I say, we absolutely condemn it. And the special coordinator himself has been 
 
 calling for calm to try and make sure that it does not escalate further and that different parts of the Palestinian Territory and Israel are not drawn 
 
 into this. 
 
GIOKOS:  Yes. Lynn Hastings, thank you so much for taking the time to speak to us today. We appreciate it. 
 
Well, we have a lot more on this coming up throughout the show. Next hour we will be hearing from Nabil Rudeineh. He is a deputy prime minister for 
 
 the Palestinian Authority and a spokesperson for Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas. That is less than one hour from now. 
 
You're watching CONNECT THE WORLD, live from Abu Dhabi. Up next, Russia claims to intercept Ukrainian drones near Moscow, causing one airport to 
 
 divert flights. 
 
Plus Russian president Vladimir Putin takes the world stage less than two weeks after the Wagner rebellion. What he is saying about Russia's response 
 
 to the uprising.

GIOKOS:  Vladimir Putin tried to protect a image of strength during a virtual meeting of leaders friendly to Moscow. The Russian president's 
 
 address at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit marks his first appearance on the world stage since the Wagner rebellion. 
 
Putin thanked Russian allies in attendance for backing him. Chinese president Xi Jinping also spoke, warning against other countries inciting a 
 
 new cold war in the region. Indian prime minister Narendra Modi had hosted a virtual event just two weeks after his state visit to the U.S.
 
Vedika Sud is in New Delhi. 
 
Seeing these leaders meet to discuss economic growth, to talk about ties political and otherwise, really quite a big message to the rest of the 
 
 world. And India being involved is absolutely vital. 
 
VEDIKA SUD, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Absolutely. I think for the Indian prime minister and the governor trying to showcase also was how they're emerging 
 
 as a global power by chairing this summit. 
 
You also have the G20 summit later that is being chaired by India, where the biggest leaders of the world will be converging in September in New 
 
 Delhi. 
 
However, I think the timing of this summit is highly significant for the simple reason that you had the Russian president Vladimir Putin appearing 
 
 for the first time ever since the Wagner mercenary insurrection that we had seen just a few days back -- a few weeks back rather. 
 
He came out and he tried to reassure these leaders of the strength, stability and unity of Russia. Here's what Putin had to say these leaders. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA (through translator):  The Russian people are consolidated as never before. The solidarity and high 
 
 responsibility for the fate of the fatherland was clearly demonstrated by Russian political circles and the entire society by coming out as a united 
 
 front against the attempted armed rebellion. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SUD:  Putin also said he'd be standing up to Western pressure and sanctions and it's time for the bloc to come together to strengthen them as a unit. 
 
 Also along with that he did go on to thank the leaders for their support during the crisis. 
 
It's not just Putin and Modi; you have the Chinese president; you have the Pakistan prime minister and four leaders from Central Asian countries, who 
 
 were also part of this online summit, hosted, like you said by Modi. 
 
Xi Jinping also had a lot to say here. He was talking about how this group needs to come together and consolidate. He also asked for regional leaders 
 
 to take charge of the future of their countries. I'm going to quote what he had to say here. Xi Jinping went on to stress for the unity and 
 
 cooperation. 
 
And he went on to say, "We must be highly vigilant against external forces inciting a new cold war in the region and creating confrontation between 
 
 camps," unquote.
 <br>[10:20:00]
 
SUD:  That's what he had to say. Please remember at this point, very important for our viewers to know, for these two countries, Russia and 
 
 China, this summit, this bloc is seen as an anti Western bloc. 
 
But for India, it's walking a tightrope here, because it wants to be seen as a non aligned country. We all know how it depends on Russia for oil and 
 
 weapons. More than 50 percent of India's imports in terms of weapons come from Russia. 
 
We know the West is highly dependent on India, because it sees it as a counterbalance to China. But for India, it doesn't want to be seen as 
 
 taking sides. This entire group out here, the SCO, none of the member nations have come out and condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine in the 
 
 U.N. resolution. 
 
None of them have come out and actually voted against Russia. You have India that has said this should be resolved peacefully. Narendra Modi has 
 
 said this is not the era for war. So India wants to be not aligned; they want to balance ties with the East and West. 
 
So this was very interesting to see the Russian president emerge after the insurrection, to see what the Chinese president had to say and India asking 
 
 for this to be a very strong SCO member nation group coming together. Back to you. 
 
GIOKOS:  It reminds me of the images of Modi we saw in the U.S. just two weeks ago in what was a significant visit as well. Thank you so much, great 
 
 to have you on. 
 
President Xi Jinping also told the summit, boosting economic growth for the region is a shared responsibility. He called for further trade and 
 
 investments and the importance of keeping the regional supply chain running smoothly. CNN's Marc Stewart has more for us. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MARC STEWART, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Even though this conference has been hosted by India's prime minister, China still has a significant 
 
 role in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, otherwise known as SCO. It's a founding member, along with Russia and several former Soviet states. 
 
STEWART (voice-over):  We heard from Chinese leader Xi Jinping during an address to the summit. He brought out themes of unity and cooperation, 
 
 calling for regional leaders to take care of their country's futures, an apparent bid to resist outside influence in the region. 
 
He talked about chaos in the world, bringing up questions like peace or conflict, cooperation or confrontation, calling for win-win cooperation. He 
 
 added policies needed to be focused on the long term interests of the region. 
 
But this is a challenging time for China. It has been leaning on the West at times to encourage investment at a time when its economy is facing 
 
 significant challenges. In addition, China has not condemned Russia's involvement in the war in Ukraine, with one analyst telling CNN XI does not 
 
 want the nation to become a bigger target of NATO than it already was before the war -- Marc Stewart, CNN, Tokyo. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
GIOKOS:  Meanwhile, Russia is accusing Ukraine of trying to attack Moscow with at least five drones, calling it an attempted terrorist attack. But 
 
 the Russian defense ministry says they were all shot, down no one was injured. Moscow's mayor says some flights were diverted and one of the 
 
 city's airports because of the alleged attack. 
 
But now the airport is operating as normal. Ben Wedeman joins us now from Eastern Ukraine. Ben, take us through the latest. 
 
BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, according to the Russians, four of those drones were shot down in the Moscow area by air 
 
 defenses. One of them brought down by electronic warfare means. 
 
Now no one was hurt, nothing was damaged in this incident. The spokeswoman for the foreign ministry said the target was an area, in her words, that 
 
 included civilian infrastructure as well as this airport. 
 
According to the Tass news agency, 14 flights were diverted from the airport. But it is now up and running. Again this is not the first time 
 
 such an -- such an incident has happened. Back in May, there were also drones over the Kremlin, one of them reportedly exploding over the Kremlin. 
 
Russia said this was an attempt to assassinate Vladimir Putin. Ukrainians, as is always the case, have denied any responsibility for this. However, 
 
 after the spokeswoman for the foreign ministry of Ukraine accused them of engaging in what she called international terrorism, an adviser for the 
 
 Ukrainian president said, essentially said this is rich coming from the Russians who, since February of last year, have consistently struck 
 
 civilian infrastructure, including last week that pizzeria --
 <br>[10:25:00]
 
WEDEMAN:  -- in Kramatorsk, where 13 people were killed and dozens others wounded. Eleni. 
 
GIOKOS:  Ben Wedeman, for us thank you so much. 
 
Meanwhile, despite months spent in detention in Russia, an American journalist accused of spying is apparently in good health. On Monday the 
 
 Kremlin allowed the U.S. ambassador to Russia to visit "The Wall Street Journal" reporter Evan Gershkovich for the first time since April. 
 
Just hours ago, the Kremlin hinted the door is open to talks of a potential prisoner swap. But that first conversation needs to happen out in the 
 
 public eye. 
 
After days of fury in France, the president says he thinks the worst might be over. Cities and towns are adding up the cost of the damage. 
 
(MUSIC PLAYING)
 
GIOKOS (voice-over):  Later, record heat in the U.K. in June and record heat possible across the U.S. for today's 4th of July holiday. We will be 
 
 right back. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
(MUSIC PLAYING)
 
GIOKOS (voice-over):  Welcome back. I'm Eleni Giokos, you're watching CONNECT THE WORLD. 
 
NATO has extended its secretary general's contract for another year. Jens Stoltenberg of Norway will stay in the top job until October 2024, giving 
 
 him a full decade in the job. On Twitter, Stoltenberg said he was honored by the decision. 
 
The International Atomic Energy chief has weighed in on Japan's plan to release treated wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear plant. Rafael Grossi 
 
 says the plan conforms with international standards and will have a negligible impact on the environment. 
 
And the Israeli military says its massive operation in the occupied West Bank could go on for several more. Days Ten Palestinians have been killed 
 
 in the raid at the refugee camp in Jenin and around 100 injured. 
 
In the meantime, eight people were injured in a car ramming and stabbing attack outside a Tel Aviv mall. The suspect was killed. 
 
GIOKOS:  Now French president Emmanuel Macron says he thinks the peak of the urban violence has passed but the -- but he will stay cautious. Mr. 
 
 Macron has been meeting with dozens of mayors from the areas hardest hit during the week of violent protests, riots and looting.
 
This all followed the deadly police shooting of a 17 year old boy after a traffic stop. CNN correspondent Melissa Bell is with us. 
 
Many meetings, a lot of discussions; in the meantime, things have seemed to calm down in the streets. But there is a question. 
 
Has the anger truly dissipated, Melissa? 
 
MELISSA BELL, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Certainly, when Emmanuel Macron spoke to that -- a meeting just wrapping up behind me at the Elysee 
 
 Palace of some 241 mayors of some of the worst hit communes over the course of the last week. 
 <br>[10:30:06]
 
When he mentioned that he believed the peak might be behind us, he went on to say that he remained cautious, it by no means -- by no means a certainty 
 
 that this is done for good. Quite right there's only 72 people who were arrested overnight, down still from the more than 150 who were arrested on 
 
 Sunday. 
 
Substantially down, from the figures of the weekend. So the suggestion, is the understanding, is this may now be petering out. And yet, Eleni, it has 
 
 been a week of remarkable violence. 
 
In fact we have been speaking to the head of what is France's main business unit union, who says they are estimating the damage that has been done over 
 
 the course of the last week to come in at $1 billion. 
 
There are, of course, the many hundreds of shops and banks that have been either looted or completely destroyed. They include in that figure the hit 
 
 to tourism. When you look at July, they say they believe the cancellations from people coming from abroad will be down 20 percent to 25 percent.
 
That, of course, is part of the cost to France to what has happened. The main thing from the point of view of the authorities, the many mayors who 
 
 are gathered here today -- and we know Macron, the government themselves, hope this has come to an end. I think it's important to remember another 
 
 part of this, Eleni, is the consultation, this procedure, to try and understand exactly what was the root cause of this, how this explosion of 
 
 anger could have erupted. 
 
What fueled it, what was behind it and how to prevent it happening again, that is perhaps the most important of the things that Emmanuel Macron has 
 
 announced these last few days, Eleni. 
 
GIOKOS:  Back to your point in terms of the economic fallout of the riots, what we've been seeing on the ground as you say, the cost could be $1 
 
 billion. That is quite extraordinary. 
 
Who is going to foot that bill?
 
If that's coupled with a loss in tourism numbers, specifically for the month of July, we're looking at far bigger numbers here. 
 
BELL:  Certainly when it comes to the infrastructure that's been damaged, the interior minister has announced taking money, giving it to the 
 
 communities to help with the reconstruction. 
 
As for tourism, many are simply going to have to take a hit. There are difficult things to quantify. For now, we don't know exactly what the 
 
 impact is going to be. Clearly, this is something that comes even off the back of many weeks and months of protests over pension reform, Eleni. 
 
We are entering a period now of Paris trying to get itself in shape for next summer's Olympics, trying to get its city tidied up, its image, right 
 
 ahead of that. So there is a lot still to do. And the cost or the beginning of counting the cost of what the last week has brought, it's only just 
 
 begun, Eleni. 
 
GIOKOS:  Melissa Bell, thank you so much. 
 
The U.K. endured record-breaking heat in June. Britain's Met office says last month was the hottest June since forecasters began tracking 
 
 temperatures in 1884. The average of 15.8 degrees Celsius was almost 4 degrees higher than the previous record. Experts warn it's part of a 
 
 dangerous trend. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  All the numbers are suggesting we're going in the wrong direction when it comes to the heat, the intensity of the heat and 
 
 how prolonged it is. Obviously this month culminated in some quite violent thunderstorms toward the end. 
 
And climate change trends do suggest that our summers are going to become hotter and also drier. But when we do see rain, it will be more intense. So 
 
 a higher likelihood of things like flash flooding. That's exactly how June played out this year. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
GIOKOS:  Meteorologists say England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland individually reported their warmest June on record. In the U.S., record 
 
 heat isn't the only issue on the 4th of July holiday. Heavy rains caused flooding in northern New York state. 
 
Strong storms are possible in the Upper Midwest and Central Plains. Fire danger is also a threat in northern Arizona and southern California.

GIOKOS (voice-over):  Ahead in sports, rocking with Tymon (ph). CNN talks exclusively with the all-time Wimbledon men's champion about life after 
 
 (INAUDIBLE).

 <br>[10:40:00]
 
(MUSIC PLAYING) 
 
GIOKOS:  A new, live action "Barbie" movie has been banned in Vietnam. 
 
(VIDEO CLIP, "BARBIE") 
 
GIOKOS:  The film is distributed by CNN sister company Warner Brothers. It was slated to open in Vietnam on July 21st. A state-run newspaper said it 
 
 won't, be screened because it shows a map of Beijing's claim to the South China Sea, which you can see depicted in U-shaped line. 
 
Now, Vietnam considers some of the oil-rich territory as its own continental shelf and has already awarded drilling contracts there. China 
 
 has refused to accept an international court ruling in The Hague that rejected its claims. Warner Brothers has not commented on the ban. 
 
A big name is missing from the draw at Wimbledon this year, the retired superstar who, for now, holds the record for most men's titles at the 
 
 tournament. I'm talking about Roger Federer. And CNN sat down with him for an exclusive interview. 
 
Coy Wire joins me now. He's taking a break from July 4th celebrations. Good to see you. Coy, I have to say, I mean, I saw Roger Federer was, you know, 
 
 on a stage playing some music. Has he given up the tennis racket for music? Did I see correctly?
 
COY WIRE, CNN ANCHOR, "WORLD SPORT":  That was very kind of you to call it playing music. He had a shaker and was kind of just going like this.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
But he did it to the beat, for the most part, Eleni, yes. We're going to hear from Roger, who spoke exclusively with CNN to our Christina 
 
 Macfarlane. 
 
He talked about that appearance on stage with the super group Coldplay. And he also talked about his family life, what he's doing in retirement, 
 
 helping so many others around the world, especially a lot of work he's doing in Africa. He's totally inspiring and totally just likable. You just 
 
 want to give the guy a hug and play the shaker with him a little bit.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
GIOKOS:  Yeah, and he was also just absolutely relaxed. Wasn't he? And he said he doesn't really miss the tennis court so much. It was a good 
 
 transition, right, from COVID to his knee injury. It was really quite telling of where he's at.
 
WIRE:  Yeah. And you know, he said he was in a much better place this time than he was last year at this time, of course, because he was still feeling 
 
 like he had a chance to keep going. And now that he knows he's not, he's in a much better place, playing his music with Coldplay and maybe he'll take
