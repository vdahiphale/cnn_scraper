ANNA COREN, CNN ANCHOR: Hello and welcome. I'm Anna Coren, ahead here on CNN NEWSROOM. Deadly attacks in Russia's places of worship. There's no claim of responsibility so far, but authorities believe they were coordinated. 
 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the intense phase of war with Hamas is ending but the focus is now shifting to the Lebanon border. And scorching temperatures are expected for the upcoming summer Olympics in Paris. We'll talk about the impact the heat could have on the athletes.
 
We begin with a series of shocking and brutal attacks on churches and synagogues in southwestern Russia. Authorities in Dagestan province say at least 15 police officers and a priest were killed on Sunday in what appears to be coordinated attacks, but the total number of victims remains unclear.
 
This video shows heavily armed law enforcement officers taking on gunmen at a Russian Orthodox Church in Makhachkala. And this is the aftermath of an attack on a police traffic post in the same city as synagogue there was also attacked. There were similar scenes in the city of Derbent. 
 
Authorities say a 66-year old priest was killed during the assault on a church in the city and Molotov cocktails were used in an attack on a synagogue there. No claim of responsibility so far, but officials told Russian news that the perpetrators were quote, adherents of an international terrorist organization.
 
Well, Dagestan is a predominantly Muslim province on the Caspian Sea. Three days of mourning have been declared. Well, our senior international correspondent Ivan Watson joins us with more. And Ivan, what more are you learning about what appears to be coordinated attacks?
 
IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Right. It was a very deadly evening and afternoon at these two cities on the coast of the Caspian Sea in Dagestan. We had descriptions of the attacks beginning sometime after the afternoon prayers on Sunday. 
 
And as you mentioned the authorities they're describing what appeared to have been a coordinated series of attacks on police posts, on a synagogue and on churches. This taking place in the region's capital of Makhachkala, as well as in the city of Derbent. And the authorities say at least 15 law enforcement officers were killed. 
 
They've also named a priest in Derbent at that Russian Orthodox Church, who they say his throat was slit, a 66-year old priest they've identified as Father Nikolay, and they say that at least six militants since gunmen have been killed and social media videos have emerged. We're trying to confirm them that do appear to show armed men in broad daylight wandering the streets and shooting as well. 
 
You can see the aftermath of the fire at the synagogue in Debent. As you mentioned Dagestan is a majority Muslim populated region of Russia. Dagestan is they have their own language, a Turkic based language. This is in the caucuses. This is historically been a turbulent region next to Chechnya. The authorities there have said they've carried out raids against suspected ISIS affiliates there. There has been no claim of responsibility for these attacks yet. 
 
However, back in March, ISIS did claim responsibility for a horrific terror attack on a concert hall outside of Moscow, where they actually torched the building as well with more than 140 people killed. And if you go back to the end of October, and that's when a mob attacked and overran the airport in Makhachkala. 
 
It was in the weeks after the October 7, Hamas attacking Israel and that crowd some of them were waving Palestinian flags, and they believed that a plane had arrived from Israel and some of them were protesting against Israelis coming to Makhachkala. 
 
So there has been a history of instability there and unrest and suggestions that this is kind of targeting religious minorities in this Muslim majority area.
 <br>[01:05:00]
 
We'll be waiting to hear how the Kremlin will respond to these deadly attacks and gun battles that erupted there, Anna.
 
COREN: Ivan Watson, as always, we appreciate your reporting. Thank you. 
 
Jill Dougherty is an adjunct professor at Georgetown University and former CNN Moscow bureau chief, she joins us now from Washington. Jill, great to see you. A lot to unpack here. But what are you learning about these seemingly coordinated attacks on churches, and a synagogue in Dagestan? JILL DOUGHERTY, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: You know, I think at this point, we have to be very careful about where we go with the story and how we interpret it. I mean, you know, big picture, this is an area that ever since the Chechen wars has been very unstable, and remember, is the Muslim area, it's very ethnically diverse. So you do have a very old Jewish community there, you have Christians, but essentially, it's a Muslim area, there have been a lot of tensions. And those tensions have been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine. We can get into that if you want. 
 
So when the Russians right now are investigating this as a terrorist operation. And you know, that could turn out to be the case. But I would say still, it's very complex, and actually quite brutal. I was surprised at the number of people and those could change. Those figures could change, but it's quite a high number.
 
COHEN: You mentioned the heightened tensions since the war in Ukraine, but there have also been heightened levels of violence, ethnic and religious tensions, worsening since the Israel-Hamas war as well. 
 
DOUGHERTY: Yes, definitely. In fact, I think it's really important to remember that back in October of last year, there were antisemitic riots at the airport in Makhachkala. And again, that's a little complicated, but essentially, there was disinformation, that there were Jewish refugees who were coming to settle in Dagestan, because what was happening in Gaza. 
 
I told you it was complicated, but that is what happened was a disinformation campaign locally, and there was a very big ride at the airport. So you have that. You have previously you'd have attacks on churches. And then, you know, in with terrorist operations, Crocus City, outside of Moscow, back in what was it March of this year. So, there's -- there are a lot of, I'd say destabilizing and sometimes terrorist acts that have been taking place.
 
COREN: Yes, as you mentioned, authorities have opened a terror investigation. And yes, it comes months after that terrorist attack on Crocus City Hall on the outskirts of Moscow, which claimed the lives of something like 145 people. ISIS-K claimed responsibility for that. 
 
Do you see any link between that attack and what has happened in Dagestan? Or it's just too early to tell?
 
DOUGHERTY: I think it really is too early to tell. We'll see who claims responsibility. But certainly the way it was carried out, it was again, very brutal in the murders of especially the priest who was murdered, and then the attack on the synagogue, so that -- whatever was going on, you know, you have, you'd have to say, inter religious violence. And that is one thing I can tell you that Vladimir Putin has been very, very worried about. 
 
Remember, during some of the back in the Syrian war, et cetera, some people from that region went to fight with ISIS and other organizations like that in Syria and in the Middle East, and then they came home. And so that's another wrinkle to this. Again, very complicated and very, I would say unstable situation. COREN: Jill, have we heard from the Kremlin? And if not, who do you think Vladimir Putin will blame for this attack?
 
DOUGHERTY: At this hour, we haven't. There could be something of course coming. But remember Crocus City, which was deemed a terrorist attack by ISIS. President Putin at least initially blame that on the West, Ukraine, in general, and I've already seen some comments, I think there was a member of the Duma, essentially, like a congressman from that region, who has blamed Ukraine and NATO, but then there was another official Dmitry Rogozin (ph) who was quite well known. He's a senator and he said look, you know, if we blame everything on NATO and Ukraine we're going to be in a fog and this will be very bad.
 <br>[01:10:10]
 
So I think it's very important to watch whom the Kremlin blames, and why. It will be significant in terms of Ukraine, the war and also domestically.
 
COREN: As you say, a very complex story. This investigation, we'll have to see where it leads. Jill Dougherty. Always a pleasure. Thank you. 
 
DOUGHERTY: Thanks Anna.
 
COREN: In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the intense phase of fighting in Gaza is quote, about to end as the country looks to possibly shift some military power to its northern border. But the Israeli leader is making clear this doesn't mean the war against Hamas is over. CNN's Paula Hancocks has more details from Jerusalem.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has given an interview to the Israeli TV Channel 14, and he's really given some more clarity on the war in Gaza and his plans for its future. 
 
Now, he said within this interview, that the intense phase of the war is about to end. Also saying that he's vowing to shift the power to the north, meaning Northern Israel on the border with Lebanon, there have been increasing cross border attacks with Hezbollah over recent weeks. 
 
Now, he also pointed out that this doesn't mean that the war will come to an end. He is saying that the current phase of fighting in Rafah will come to an end. He also said that he was ready for a partial deal with Hamas. This is about the ceasefire hostage deal, which is on the table at the moment, but has really been in limbo in in recent days. He says though, that he is willing to agree to a partial deal, he wants to get some of the hostages back. But he also said that he will continue after the ceasefire to try and achieve his goal of eliminating her mass. 
 
Now, of course, this may well be problematic for Hamas, we have heard consistently from Hamas officials that they want a specific timeline for a permanent ceasefire for this war. So it may even make it more difficult for the two sides to come to any kind of agreement now on this ceasefire hostage deal, which I must add has been stalled somewhat over recent days. 
 
He also pointed out he wants to bring people back to the north meaning tens of thousands of residents who have been evacuated due to the tension at North and he said that he would like a political agreement, that would be great. But if it's not possible, we will do it another way. 
 
Now, of course, on the Lebanese side as well, there are also tens of thousands of residents that have had to be evacuated. So this interview really giving a little more clarity on where the Israeli prime minister is and what he plans for the upcoming potential days weeks. There is no timeline when it comes to these clarifications. Paula Hancocks, CNN, Jerusalem.

COREN: Israel's defense minister is set to discuss the war against Hamas during his visit to Washington. Yoav Gallant left Israel on Sunday and is scheduled to meet with his U.S. counterpart Lloyd Austin, and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken this week. 
 
The White House said it's looking forward to constructive consultations with Gallant, while also saying it will not keep responding to claims by the Israeli prime minister that the U.S. was delaying the shipments of weapons. U.S. officials last week called those claims not accurate and disappointing.
 
Ukrainian strike in Russian occupied Crimea left at least five people dead including three children, and more than 100 others wounded. Well, Russia's Ministry of Defense says it's shut down for missiles. Another missile exploded in the sky, scattering fragments over a busy beach in Sebastopol on Sunday. 
 
Russia says the Ukrainian fired missiles were supplied by the United States and blamed Washington for the attack. Witnesses say air raid sirens did not sound to warn of the attack. CNN has reached out to the Ukrainian military for comment. 
 
Meanwhile, Russia's continued bombardment of Ukraine second largest city has left another person dead and 12 others wounded. Official say strikes on Kharkiv Sunday hit a home and school. Russian troops inching closer to a city after an offensive near the border last month. But Ukraine says its forces are bouncing back in the region as Western aid starts pouring in again. CNN's Fred Pleitgen has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
Frederik Pleitgen, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): Ukrainian troops storming a Russian trench in the Kharkiv region firing and throwing grenades at those unwilling to surrender.
 
[01:15:0] Elsewhere in the same region, a Russian soldier does give up after the Ukrainians decimated his unit. We ran to him and I saw his uniform up close and realized he's a Russian servicemen, he says, then I shouted at him hands up, he put up his hands in the air and then did everything I told him to do. 
 
Moscow's military launched a surprise offensive targeting the northeast of Ukraine earlier this year, destroying a key town and gaining a foothold not far from Ukraine's second largest city Kharkiv. But now the Ukrainians say they've killed scores of Russians here and are back on the offensive. A major reason resumed military aid from the U.S. and its allies, Ukraine's president says.
 
We see the world's determination opening up new perspectives for restoring our security, he says, among other things, this concerns the security of Kharkiv, the destruction of Russian terrorist positions and launchers near the border by our forces and soldiers really matters.
 
As Ukraine's land and air forces are pounding his troops, Russian leader Vladimir Putin was at a children's musical school in Russia's Far East and route to meet a key ally North Korean strong man Kim Jong Un. 
 
With the going tough on the battlefield, Putin has already threatened the West for supporting Ukraine but also claims he wants peace talks. So far the West has been ignoring our interests, he says, while they forbid Kyiv to negotiate they hypocritically call on us to start some sort of negotiations. It just looks idiotic. 
 
But Ukrainian troops facing the Russians on the Eastern Front say they have no trust in the Russian leader's words and want to fight on. Russia understands force only, the soldier says, all the agreements and signings are just games with a beast sooner or later it will regain its strengths, lick its wounds and will be conquering even more because it has already tasted blood. 
 
And so, Ukraine's forces continue the battle against the enemy with more troops and a lot more firepower. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Berlin.

COREN: After the break, CNN presidential debate is now only days away more on the historic showdown next. Plus, a U.S. woman accused of trying to drown a three-year old Muslim girl. We hear from one civil rights group who is calling the attack a hate crime.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
COREN: CNN historic presidential debate is now just three days away. U.S. President Joe Biden will debate his predecessor Donald Trump for the first time since 2020. Mr. Biden and Trump have very different approaches to debate preparations, while Trump hit the campaign trail this weekend caught in Christian conservatives. President Biden is been hunkered down at Camp David with his advisors.
 
CNN's Kevin Liptak has more on Mr. Biden's debate strategy.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KEVIN LIPTAK, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: President Biden has now completed three days of debate prep out at Camp David and we are getting some new insights into the Biden campaign strategy heading into this week and heading into Thursday's debate in Atlanta. 
 
They've released a memo spelling out some of the things that they're doing to boost enthusiasm among their supporters ahead of this showdown that includes 300-debate night watch parties, and 1,600 events in battleground states to try and ramp up energy around President Biden's appearance on that debate stage against President Trump. 
 
And I think this memo really lays clear, the three most important items that President Biden will want to hammer home on that debate stage one is the issue of abortion. And this is one that the Democrats really believe will be galvanizing for their support supporters come November. President Biden really wants to lay at Donald Trump's feet, the overturning of Roe vs. Wade. 
 
And in fact, on Monday, the Biden campaign plans a 50 events around the anniversary of the Dobbs Supreme Court decision that stripped the nationwide right to abortion really trying to rally their supporters around this key issue. 
 
The second item on the debate stage that you're going to hear from President Biden is this idea of democracy and the threats that he believes Donald Trump poses to American democracy, threats of political violence. This, of course, has been an underpinning of the entire Biden campaign. And certainly, he wants to hammer that point home on Thursday night. 
 
The third issue is the economy. The number one issue for many voters, President Biden wants to claim that Trump's record and agenda would only benefit the wealthy. Of course, this is a vulnerability for President Biden, many Americans don't see the economy as improving despite indicators that suggest the economy is doing well. It is something that he will have to talk about on the debate stage on Thursday night. 
 
Now, the other items that I think are likely to come up and that we heard from Biden surrogates on Sunday is this idea of Trump as a convicted felon. We did hear from one key voice Mitch Landrieu who's a co-chair of the campaign, he talked about this idea of which Trump would show up on the debate stage would be a restrained presidential Trump. Would it be a bombastic sort of ferocious Trump like we saw in 2020? Listen to what Mitch Landrieu said today. 
 
MTICH LANDRIEU, NATIONAL CO-CHAIR OF BIDEN CAMPAIGN: It really doesn't matter how Donald Trump shows up if he comes in unhinged like he is most of the time, or he sits there and his quiet. People are going to know that he's a twice impeached, convicted felon who has been found to have defamed somebody sexually abused somebody and gone bankrupt six times. They will always know that and that is something that the American people have to think about. 
 
LIPTAK: So you hear they're a preview of sorts of what you might hear from President Biden on the debate stage when it comes to all of the legal issues that have been surrounding President Trump. This is certainly a major backdrop to this entire campaign and will be a major backdrop as well to this debate, this face off on Thursday night. Kevin Liptak. CNN, Washington.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
COREN: Tune in to watch the CNN presidential debate on Thursday at 9:00 a.m. Eastern and we will replay the entire debate at 7:00 a.m. London time. That's 2:00 p.m. here in Hong Kong. 
 
Well, police in Texas say a woman has been charged with attempted murder for allegedly trying to drown a three-year old girl in a swimming pool. One civil rights group has called the attack a hate crime after identifying the victim as Muslim. CNN's Camila Bernal has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
CAMILA BERNAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The Council on American Islamic Relations says that this family was Muslim and it's why they believe this could have been racially motivated. And it's also why they're calling for this to be investigated as a hate crime. 
 
Now authorities say this all happened back in May 19 when they were called to an apartment complex pool in Euless, Texas, they were called for a disturbance between two women and attempted drowning and authorities say when they initially arrived to the scene. They arrested Elizabeth wolf for public intoxication. 
 
And once they began that investigation, they spoke to the mother of the victim who told them that Wolf had asked her where she was from and asked if those were her children. Once she answered that question that mother says that Wolf grabbed her six-year old son. Here is how the executive director of the council's Dallas Fort Worth chapter is describing it. 
 
MUSTAFAA CARROLL, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, COUNCIL ON AMERICAN-ISLAMIC RELATIONS, TEXAS: According to the mother, the six-year old son was able to escape, but her petite three-year old daughter was unable. The alleged attacker snatched off the mother's head scarf and used it to beat the mother with as well as kicking her or to keep her away from forcing her child he had underwater.
 <br>[01:25:03]
 
Now that mother also telling police that her child was yelling for help that her child was coughing up water but thankfully she was able to pull her child out of the water. Both children are evaluated medically and authorities saying they are OK. 
 
The mother also telling police that Wolf made racial statements and made statements about her not being American. Now, Wolf was charged with attempted capital murder. The bail was set for $25,000. She was also charged with injury to a child that bail was set at $15,000. She posted bail, and it's why the council is now asking for a higher bail. It's why they're asking for this to be investigated as a hate crime and they're also asking for the safety and security of the Muslim community overall. Camila Bernal, CNN, Los Angeles.

COREN: Well, CNN is trying to reach the accuser Elizabeth Wolf for comments. It's unclear if she has an attorney. Still to come. The death toll soars during this year's Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, with authority saying too many people just weren't prepared for the extreme heat they would endure. 
 
Plus, is Paris too hot for the Summer Olympics? We'll break down a report outlining the risks to athletes and everyone involved in the upcoming Paris Games.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
COREN: Saudi Arabia says more than 1,300 people have died during this year's Hajj pilgrimage. Temperatures at times peaked about 50 degrees Celsius or 122 Fahrenheit. It says most of those who died were an authorized to perform the trip and walks long distances and the scorching sun. CNN's Scott McLean has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, it's been clear for several days now that the official death toll from this year as Hajj would likely rise and now we know by precisely how much. The Saudi Arabian government says the more than 1,300 people died at this year's pilgrimage at least in part due to the extreme heat. It says that almost half a million people receive some form of medical attention, some are still hospitalized. It also says that all of the families of the 1,301 victims have been notified despite serious challenges in identifying all of the bodies. 
 
On Monday, the mercury hit almost 52 degrees Celsius, 125 degrees Fahrenheit. And what you have to remember is that almost everything at the Hajj is outdoors and involves some physicality walking some distances between or two some of the various sites.
 <br>[01:30:00]
 
And pilgrims that we spoke to described really seeing two categories of pilgrims. One, the official kind, the kind that came with a Hajj visa that had proper transportation options and air-conditioned accommodations.
 
And then you had this unregistered kind of pilgrim that maybe came on a tourist visa or a business visa to Saudi Arabia, didn't have proper transportation and didn't have access to proper accommodation. In fact, some people were setting up these makeshift tent encampments to try to get under any shade that they possibly could. And the Saudis say that some 83 percent of all of the pilgrims who died were in that latter category. 
 
Now countries like Egypt are cracking down on tour companies that may have helped facilitate these are unofficial travel routes. 
 
We have also heard from the daughter of an American couple who paid more than $20,000 to a travel company to attend this year's Hajj only to find out that that company could not provide proper transportation. 
 
And she says that on the day that her parents died they reported waiting several hours for transportation that never came. So they ended up walking a long distance to one of the sites. They went missing and were later confirmed dead.
 
And then to add insult to injury, she says that she had asked the Saudi government to hold the bodies for identification, but it turns out they had already been buried and now her and her family are not sure where they were buried. 
 
Scott McLean CNN -- Istanbul.

ANNA COREN, CNN ANCHOR: Athletes competing in the 2024 summer Olympics face a greater risk of health-related illnesses than ever. That's according to a new report. The British Association of Sustainable Sport and Front Runners, issued the report with the summer games just over a month away.
 
Using data from climate scientists, they warn quote, "The threat of a devastating hot spill is very real." 
 
Among the highest health risks to athletes and the officials are heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke. They also faced problems like cognitive impairment and dehydration. 
 
The group warns that some Paralympians and other athletes with underlying medical conditions are at a greater risk from the heat.
 
Well, joining me now is Mike Tipton a professor of human and applied physiology at the University of Portsmouth. Professor, great to have you with us.
 
The Tokyo Olympics were the hottest in history and it looks like Paris will surpass that. Tell is how the heat will affect the upcoming Olympic Games.
 
MIKE TIPTON, UNIVERSITY OF PORTSMOUTH: Well, it could be devastating in many ways. As you've just said, it's ten times more likely that we'll see a hot Olympics than it was just 100 years ago. And some of the temperatures we're talking about, Paris had a heat wave just in 2023 where the air temperature got into the 40s. 
 
Now at that level of temperature, its pretty well impossible to compete at anything like a normal level and body overheating results in firstly, exhaustion associated with dehydration. And then as the body temperature continues to rise, there's a direct effect of heat on the function of the brain and other cells and proteins in the body, which is a serious medical condition. 
 
And it's not just the elite athletes that are producing lots of heat, 80 percent of the energy you consume is released as heat. It's also the officials and spectators who are probably less well-prepared for those temperatures that are also at risk.
 
COREN: Well, in the past week, we've seen what extreme heat can do during, you know, the Hajj in Saudi Arabia, 1,300 people died.
 
Athletes, obviously they're going to be exerting themselves physically and mentally. I mean, what are your fears -- collapsing, even dying
 
TIPTON: Well, yes. I mean, the range of -- the range of heat illnesses goes from cramping through to fainting through to exhaustion. And then as I say, a major medical condition of heat stroke, which is life- threatening. 
 
And particularly in a competitive environment where people are trying very hard to do their best. We know that people will push themselves beyond the normal limits where, you know, you'd have a natural inclination to slow down.
 
And so if we do get the temperatures that we could easily get because of climate change then those two things of competing, producing lots of energy and lots of heat, and those temperatures are incompatible. 
 <br>[01:34:51]
 
TIPTON: The cognitive impairment of course, will affect even people who are not necessarily generating a lot of heat. The distraction that comes from discomfort and sweating can affect even though sports where there's not a lot of heat generation. 
 
So it's not limited just to people who are running long distances or exercising hard.
 
COREN: I guess I want to ask you what sports are most at risk? You are part of this report, Ring of Fire regarding heat at the upcoming games. 
 
TIPTON: Yes, well I mean, obviously if you're running a marathon, if you're doing a triathlon, cycling, doing anything that involves reasonably long -- reasonably long duration heat production, then you know, your chances of a high body temperature when air temperatures get into the 40s is significant.
 
But even with accumulated dehydration over time, sports that don't involve a lot of heat production can be impacted. And as I say, both physical and mental -- the decision-making gets impaired. People make bad decisions in the heat. And that will affect athletes, that may affect officials as well. 
 
Even sitting in the heat, becoming sunburned, becoming discomfort -- and just become uncomfortable, sweating a lot, becoming dehydrated can have a significant impact on people who are not particularly healthy. 
 
So that may in fact have an impact on spectators. So it's across the board. It's not just people doing long distance events in the heat.
 
We really are calling in the recommendations for people to understand these problems and lobby in particular for mitigation of climate change because that's the fundamental problem here is that we're just seeing more and more high temperature situations.
 
COREN: Professor Mike Tipton, great to speak to you. Thank you for your analysis.
 
TIPTON: Thanks.
 
COREN: Well, torrential rain is still lashing southern China as it deals with deadly flash floods and landslides. And Chinese state media is reporting the death toll has now risen to at least 71 people across the region. 
 
For more, let's go to CNN's Steven Jiang live for us in Beijing. Steven, what more are you learning?
 
STEVEN JIANG, CNN BEIJING BUREAU CHIEF: Yes Anna, these floods are turning increasingly dangerous and in many cases, deadly as the authorities continue to revise up their casualty figures. As you just mentioned, the death toll of 71. That is expected to rise as we are not even the month of July just yet. 
 
And the bad news is there's no reprieve in sight because after pounding for days, these heavy rainfalls are now moving northwards to impact even more provinces. 
 
The National Weather Service just a few hours ago issued a red alert -- that's their highest alert for heavy rainfalls for multiple provinces along the Yangtze River. And that's after over the weekend, for example, we saw in one eastern Chinese province along (INAUDIBLE) more than half a million people already been affected by flash floods and landslides with the authorities there evacuating some 64,000 people. 
 
We've also learned a growing number of tragedies being reported by state media with entire families being wiped out by these flood waters.
 
Now, dramatic footage we have all seen in the past few days showing how both urban and rural areas submerged in muddy water as emergency responders rush to rescue trapped residents using speed boats, rafts, and in some cases, carrying elderly citizens on their shoulders away from their submerged houses. 
 
We've also seen heavy equipment being sent in and choppers being deployed to sending supplies as a growing number of residents are now finding their access to roads, electricity, and the communication all being cut. 
 
Now, a lot -- a lot of these areas in southern and eastern China, they're no stranger to these annual summer floods. But scientists have warned the effect of climate change has amplified extreme weather, making them more frequent and deadlier. 
 
So one case in point is as these rains and floods continue in southern and eastern China in many parts of northern China, we have been experiencing severe drought and record high temperatures. 
 
So the misery really doesn't seem to end across this vast country, Anna.
 
COREN: Steven Jiang joining us from Beijing, we appreciate the update. Thank you.
 
We're only days away from Iran's presidential election. After the break, we'll take a closer look at the candidates and what to expect this week. 
 <br>[01:39:23]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
COREN: Iranians are preparing for an early presidential election this week as s the country faces unprecedented challenges at home and abroad. The election was called after President Ebrahim Raisi died in a helicopter crash last month.
 
Iran's Guardian Council chose six candidates out of 80 contenders. The list mostly includes hardliners along with one reformist lawmaker. Analysts say the traditional reformist base has boycotted recent elections amid dwindling trust in the government. 
 
In March, Iran recorded its lowest voter turnout since the Islamic Republic's founding in 1979.
 
Trita Parsi is executive vice president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft. He's also the author of "Losing an Enemy: Obama, Iran, and the Triumph of Diplomacy". He joins us now from Virginia.
 
Trita, thank you so much for joining us. 
 
TRITA PARSI, EVP, QUINCY INSTITUTE FOR RESPONSIBLE STATECRAFT: Thank you.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
COREN: This election in Iran is as much about electing a president as it is showing the world that Ebrahim Raisi's death last month has not destabilized the country.
 
Talk us through the top candidates, what they represent at such a time of turmoil in the country, in the region.
 
PARIS: You're quite right. This election represents much more than just who will be the next president because as we saw in the last few years, there had been a situation in the country in which a clear majority of the population had lost faith in the idea that the system could be reformed through elections and through the ballot box. 
 
And you saw major riots and people calling for the overthrow of the regime immediately. That did not end up working out. And people thought that there was going to be years and years of essentially political apathy. But Ebrahim Raisi's death paradoxically has created this situation. 
 
Now suddenly, you're starting to see slowly, but surely some enthusiasm for this election. And that enthusiasm is going to be critical for the reformist candidate Pezeshkian because he needs at least 60 percent voter turnout in order to be able to get to the second round. 
 
If the excitement is low as it had been in the parliamentary elections, for instance, just a few months ago, then there will be a fight only between the conservative candidates.
 
COREN: The Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei has, of course, final say on all state matters. Is it likely a president would sway away from his beliefs or vision for Iran? Is there really any chance of election a president who has ideas of reform.
 
PARSI: Well, we've seen previous presidents having various degrees of success when it comes to pushing Khamenei in a specific direction. On a more fundamental level, I don't think there's any room for maneuvering for them in the sense that he's going to continue to defend the Islamic Republic. 
 
But we saw, for instance, that Rouhani was quite successful in convincing Khamenei that there had to be negotiations with the United States and made sure that those negotiations were successful and made sure that Khamenei helped ensure that the entire political system in Iran backed it.
 <br>[01:44:55]
 
PARSI: So you have the opportunity if it's the right president, if he knows how to play his cards right. But it's definitely going to be a major, major power struggle.
 
But I do believe that someone like Pezeshkian with the approach that he has taken so far seems to be eyeing the presidency with the aim of making sure that he manages to have clear impact on Khamenei's approach on a couple of key issues with their foreign policy (INAUDIBLE).
 
COREN: Rapper, Toomaj Salehi has had his death sentence overturned in recent days, the timing is interesting. Do you believe that this is tied to the election? 
 
PARSI: It could very well be. We've seen in the past that when the regime wants to see higher turnout in the elections and wants to see turnout and successful elections essentially give a perception of legitimacy for the system that they have taken measures of this kind in order to give people some hope that perhaps there can be some change. COREN: To the main election issues within Iran -- the economy, western sanctions, women's rights -- you talk about this voter dissatisfaction and there has been, you know, word of boycotting the election. Do you think that will still be the case?
 
PARSI: There is a struggle about that as we speak right now. But what is fascinating is that the energy that seems to exist right now is much higher than it was when Raisi got elected in which turnout was extremely low. 
 
And they had done quite a lot to manipulate those elections. We're seeing now that more and more people are coming out endorsing some candidate and declaring that they're going to participate in the elections. 
 
And again, it doesn't have to be terribly high, above 60 percent roughly, in order to make sure that there's a runoff election a week after the elections on the 28th. 
 
And if the turnout is above 60 percent, there's a high likelihood that Pezeshkian, the reformist candidate will be in the second round. And at that moment, it's going to be really interesting because I think it is fair to say that there's a likelihood that in that scenario, a lot of the people who didn't vote in the first round may actually cast a vote in the second round and push for the reformist candidate because at the end of the day, he is seen as the most anti-establishment of the candidates on the ballot right now even though he himself has tried to not portray himself that way.
 
COREN: These certainly are fascinating elections. It'll be interesting to see what voter turnout will be.
 
Trita Parsi, we thank you for joining us and for your analysis.
 
PARSI: Thank you for having me.
 
COREN: Demonstrators turned out across Brazil Sunday to protest a bill that would equate abortions after 22 weeks to homicide. The legislation would also impose prison sentences of 6 to 20 years. Protesters demanding that the bill be dismissed permanently. 
 
Abortion is only allowed in Brazil in cases of rape, fetal deformity or when the mother's life is in danger. Many Brazilian women resort to unsafe, illegal abortions. Botched procedures cause dozens of deaths every year.
 
Rising sea levels have forced hundreds of families off the coast of Panama to leave their homes for a more permanent place to live. But some of them are not pleased about the move.
 
CNN's Rafael Romo reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Some 300 families have left their home on the island of Gardi Sugdub in Panama in hopes of a better future. For some that does not seem to be the case. 
 
The Panamanian government relocated these families to the new community of Nuevo Carti on the mainland due to the rising sea levels affecting the island.
 
CNN went to the island and spoke with locals there and on the mainland, not a local seem happy with this solution to climate change.
 
Resident Brenes Garcia goes back to his home on the island every day.
 
BRENES GARCIA, GARDI SUGDUB RESIDENT: This morning at 6:00 a.m. I crossed here.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: But where are you going to live, here or there?
 
GARCIA: Here and there. I have quite a few things here. I would have to take everything with me.
 
ROMO: Garcia owns a shop in Gardi Sugdub, and he tells CNN there's not enough space in the new community for his business. It would not be profitable for him to stay in Nuevo Carti. 
 
Community officials say some 32 families stayed on the island. There were no more houses left and others decided to stay on their own. 
 
Residents of the Panamanian island tell CNN, living on the mainland would affect their livelihood and lifestyle. 
 <br>[01:49:54]
 
HERMINIO REYES, GARDI SUGDUB RESIDENT: I'm losing fishing time because I'm not looking at the sea every day. and that's in my nature. I want to ensure that every day my family is eating fish and also yucca. Everything that is natural.
 
ROMO: The community secretary, Agusto Walter (ph) said that before the move, the island of Gardi Sugdub had around 1,300 habitants and in some homes, up to four generations would live under the same roof. 
 
But conditions in the new community of Nuevo Carti do not seem to be better. Walter says that electricity and water go out sometimes for days at a time. 
 
The climate change effects will only get worse as sea levels rise. Residents of the island looked at other solutions to protect their homes. These fillings seen here on the island are built with wood and stones to prevent water from entering the houses when the tide rises.
 
CLAUDIANO LOPEZ, GARDI SUGDUB RESIDENT: What they told me at first was that they didn't think it was climate change. They didn't believe it.
 
But now they're tired of drying everything, removing stones and when the sea rises, it takes things away. 
 
AGUSTO WALTER, COMMUNITY SECRETARY: I know that in 10 or 30 years this will be noticeable, but not now. Now people think that it is not a big deal, that it's not going to happened. But yes, the sea level is going up. 
 
ROMO: Rafael Romo, CNN -- Atlanta.
