KIM BRUNHUBER, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT:  Welcome to all of you watching us here in the United States, Canada, and all around the world. I'm Kim Brunhuber. Ahead on "CNN Newsroom".
 
Eight people were killed after a gunman opened fire in an outlet mall in Texas. What we're learning about the shooter and the weapon. Now, this comes amid a weekend of gun violence across the U.S. We'll look at some mayors in those cities, what they're saying in response.
 
And Ukraine says, it's used an American Patriot made system to take down a Russian hypersonic missile. We'll go live to Kyiv for the latest.
 
ANNOUNCER:  Live from Atlanta this is "CNN Newsroom with Kim Brunhuber."
 
BRUNHUBER:  We begin in Allen, Texas where at least eight people have been killed in a mass shooting in America. Authorities say, a gunman opened fire at an outlet mall as hundreds of people were out shopping. One witness filmed the horrifying scenes from the rampage which we have to warn you may be hard to watch.

(END VIDEO CLIP) BRUNHUBER:  Now, you see people there are running for safety as gunfire rings out in the background. Police say, an officer responded to the shooting and killed the gunman. Here's how the mayor reacted to the tragedy.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KEN FULK, ALLEN, TEXAS MAYOR:  Allen is a proud and safe city which makes today's senseless act of violence even more shocking. However, I want to commend our police and fire departments for their quick response. Their thorough training not to hesitate to move toward the threat likely saved more lives today than what we could imagine.

BRUNHUBER:  CNN's Ed Lavandera is in Texas with more on how the shooting unfolded.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR CORRESPONDENT:  This is the site of the horrific shooting at the outlet mall in Allen, Texas, where authorities have announced that there are eight victims in all. Six of those victims died here at the scene. Two of the victims were pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital. Now, there are also, we are told, seven other victims that are being treated for wounds that were suffered here in this shooting attack at this outlet mall, three of those patients are in critical condition. So many people still fighting for their lives.
 
It was an extremely chaotic situation as the shooting scene unfolded here just before 4:00 central time on Saturday afternoon. We are told by witnesses that there was what they believed to be the gunman, a man dressed in cover. We saw a picture of this with -- covered in tactical gear with ammunition on a body vest, as well as an AR-style assault rifle laying on the ground next to him. So, that is someone that was witnessed the end of this shooting.
 
And what is interesting is, is that we were told that many of the victims that were killed were just beyond the lights that you see me, near the H&amp;M store. And from what we've been able to gather and piece together from speaking with witnesses, the area where the gunman was taken out was around the corner, some distance away in this large outlet mall shopping center parking lot.
 
So, it's not exactly clear how much time elapsed from the initial moment of the shooting to when it all ended. We are told by authorities that it was an Allen, Texas, police officer who was able to take out the shooter and bring the shooting attack to an end. But much more beyond that we don't know. We don't know if investigators, so far, have been able to identify who the gunman is or what the motive might be in this situation.
 
Many of the witnesses spoke with say, in those initial moments when the shots started firing, many people ran, took cover inside the department stores, seeking shelter and hiding places in the storage areas in the back. And for many people, it took almost two hours for law enforcement investigators to come through the scene and clear out those areas, letting them know that it was, at that moment, OK to be able to come out. They were escorted out of the buildings with their arms in the air and out of the parking lot area here.
 
So, on Sunday, investigators will continue working this crime scene, continue looking into the motive and the background of this shooter, and that is what they will be doing for some time. But as of now, the latest information we have is that there were eight victims in all, not including the gunman, and three people still in critical condition fighting for their lives. Ed Lavandera, CNN, Allen, Texas.

BRUNHUBER:  Well, witnesses at the scene described the tense moments in which they spotted the shooter setting off a panic. Listen to this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Down the sidewalk, and he was just, like, blazing for the most part and just shooting his gun.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Inside or outside?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Outside. Outside the store. He was walking down the sidewalk -- towards -- he was down the sidewalk towards Fat Burger and he was just shooting his gun everywhere for the most part.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  My manager, he went out and, like, I guess when he was opening the door, like, people just kept trying in, try to run in. But he saw -- I guess he saw the person. He was, like, with a vest and everything, had a gun. It looked like an AK, like he looked -- looked like he was trained. So, like, I don't know if, like, if he was a felon before, but he looked like he was -- he knew what he was -- he wanted to do.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We'll think twice, I guess, you know? And it makes you a little bit more afraid to go out in the community. I mean, this is a very safe community, or I thought it was.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER:  And our Ed Lavandera spoke with a restaurant employee who says, she heard the shootings and saw victims on the ground.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TIFFANY GIPSON, WITNESS:  This incident happened right outside the restaurant.
 
LAVANDERA:  Right outside.
 
GIPSON:  And they were -- there were customers inside. So, we escorted them to the back but there was a lot of things -- people's purses and wallets and cell phones are in there but this came to a shock. So -- 
 
LAVANDERA:  When -- describe to me what you saw and what you heard when it first erupted.
 
GIPSON:  I just saw -- I mean, I heard a bunch of shooting and then I went outside -- and then I went next to the glass, and then that's when I saw the victim on the ground. I've never -- 
 
LAVANDERA:  You saw one victim on the ground?
 
GIPSON:  The one that got shot. I actually saw three people on the ground.
 
LAVANDERA:  The man that was shooting was there on the ground?
 
GIPSON:  Yes, the police shot him. They shot him. The picture that I showed them, it's multiple -- yes -- I think, they shot him in the head and chest and stuff. So -- and he was laying on his back.
 
LAVANDERA:  Did you see this person? Were they walking around the parking lot? What was -- what were they doing?
 
GIPSON:  I just saw the aftermath.
 
LAVANDERA:  What goes through your mind when you heard that shooting all of a sudden?
 
GIPSON:  I never witnessed anything like this. This is very traumatic for me. It's a bunch of teenagers that work at Fat Burger, but there were families in there, little kids, small children, toddlers. And so, my supervisor just escorted them to the back, to a hallway. So, it's full. I just -- I just squatted on the ground.

BRUNHUBER:  And President Biden was briefed on the shooting in Texas after he returned from church on Saturday. The White House says it's in touch with local and state officials to offer support. CNN's Jeremy Diamond has the details.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  President Biden has been briefed on the shooting in Allen, Texas. And additionally, that the White House is closely monitoring the situation. White House officials have been in touch with local law enforcement and local officials to offer any potential support as well as federal officials as well.
 
We look back at previous statements that President Biden has issued in the wake of these mass shootings. He is very quick to call for action. He -- we are no longer in a phase where a president of the United States would see a report like this and talk about thoughts and prayers and not immediately pivot to what he sees as the legislative solution. That is exactly what we have seen from President Biden. In the wake of shootings, he has said, how many more Americans must die before Republicans in Congress take action? That was the statement that President Biden released after that shooting in Louisville, Kentucky last month. And we have seen President Biden in the wake for these shootings quickly talk about a need for a ban on assault weapons, a ban on high-capacity magazines, safe storage laws.
 
And what we've also heard from President Biden more recently is that he believes he has done all he can from an executive action standpoint and that ultimately now the burden rests on Congress. We know, of course, that the dynamic in Congress, though, remains unchanged. Republicans control the House of Representatives, and even in the Senate, Democrats have a slim majority, certainly not a filibuster proof majority to be able to move the kind of legislative solutions that they would like to see.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER:  Former Washington D.C. Police Chief Charles Ramsey says, gun violence is rampant in the U.S. and something has to be done now to end it. And he says thoughts and prayers aren't enough. Here he is.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHARLES RAMSEY, CNN SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST AND FORMER WASHINGTON, D.C. POLICE CHIEF:  In a matter of minutes, you can have multiple casualties if someone is using an assault-type weapon, especially in a place like a shopping mall on a Saturday afternoon. I mean, it's just ridiculous that we have these kinds of weapons in our country available for civilian use.
 <br>[04:10:00]
 
And our elected officials fail to do anything about it. I mean, there's no need for them. There's needs to be a ban on these weapons. And people who already have them, they need to turn them in, or at very minimum, register their firearm.
 
Until we get elected officials that aren't afraid to sit down and at least have dialogue to try to come up with a solution. And solutions are there. It may not be perfect for either side, but we have to do something other than just give thoughts and prayers. I mean, if thoughts and prayers worked by themselves, we'd be the safest nation in the world. But obviously, more than that has to happen. And we need elected officials that have the courage to stand up and do what they have to do in order to protect us because right now, I mean, you can't go to the mall, schools aren't safe, churches -- there isn't a place that I can think of where we haven't had a mass shooting.
 
So, when's it going to end? There's just no end in sight. It's going to continue until something is done about it. At what point in time are we going to stand up and just do what we need to do in order to get these kinds of weapons off our streets and deal with the people that use them. This isn't just about mental health. There are some people that are just flat out evil and they do these kinds of things and we need to make sure that we do everything humanly possible that keep firearms out of their hands so they can't hurt anyone.
 
But we have gun violence taking place on our streets of our city every day. One person, two people, three, what have you. It just -- it's -- it just never ends. And as far as politicians saying, you know, this isn't the time. Well, when is the time? With the number of mass shootings we've had, we're in a perpetual state of mourning. At some point in time, you've got to stop mourning and start doing something.
 
And so, we're just at that point right now where we've got to force it and make it happen, and that's the people. The people have the ability to make this happen. If they sit around waiting for our elected officials, we're going to be waiting a long time.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER:  The Gun Violence Archive which follows shootings in the U.S. says there have been almost 200 mass shootings so far this year, more than once a day.
 
In another city affected was in North Carolina, Chico, on Saturday, one person was killed and five more injured when a gunman opened fire at a large party. Police say they won't be release releasing any names at this time as the investigation remains in its early stages but authorities report that incident appears to be isolated and there's not an ongoing threat to the community at this time.
 
No, in Chicago a police officer who is coming off work was shot and killed on Saturday. It happened in the city South Side Avalon Park Neighborhood. Responding officers found the female officer with a gun wound and immediately took her to the hospital where she died. Police say, as of Saturday morning, there's no one in custody.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LORI LIGHTFOOT, CHICAGO MAYOR:  I had an opportunity to speak with the family of this officer, who, as you might imagine, is completely shattered. I won't speak for the mother, but I can tell you that she poured everything that she could into her child. No mother wants to wake up to the tragic news that their child is dead.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER:  The Columbus, Ohio, police chief is condemning the accessibility of guns after series of shootings in her city. At least two people are dead and several more injured in three separate incidents on Saturday. The chief says, guns are ending up in the hands of way too many people.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHIEF ELAINE BRYANT, COLUMBUS POLICE:  It's tragic that these incidents occurred. And one of the things that we're really concerned about is how many guns are so easily accessible? How many people are walking around with guns? As you know, the gun laws changed back in June of last year. We were concerned. We're, obviously as police, we want to be able to make sure that we make people as safe as possible.
 
But when you have a situation where anyone can have a gun with no checks and balances, they don't have to have any type of training, they don't have to have any CCWs, they don't have to have anything to be able to get guns. What we're seeing is the guns are readily available.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER:  Under an Ohio law passed last year, eligible adults are allowed to carry a concealed handgun without a license or training.
 
And here in Atlanta, police released an excerpt from one of the 9-1-1 calls from Wednesday's shooting that killed one person and injured four others. Listen to this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We hear gunshots in the hall. One of the doctors says he sees -- he thinks he sees someone on the floor by the elevators on the 11th floor, but it's definitely loud and -- 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Are they still shooting?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We don't -- they're not shooting at this moment but there were several shots that we heard.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER:  The suspect, 24-year-old, Dion Patterson is in custody. Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens says, he's calling for a change in gun laws in the wake of the shooting. Here he is.
 <br>[04:15:00]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDRE DICKENS, ATLANTA MAYOR:  This cannot be the new normal. We know the common-sense gun laws that we should have. Universal background checks should be just adopted and established as a norm. We should not allow convicted felons to have the ability to buy guns and violent misdemeanors. Anyone that's mentally unstable, we should disallow them to have access to guns as well.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER:  Patterson opened fire in the waiting room of a medical office. He faces one count of murder and three counts of aggravated assault.
 
More than 100 wildfires are burning in western Canada, where the state of emergency declared across the province of Alberta. More than 24,000 people have been forced from their homes. Alberta has been experiencing a hot, dry spring which has contributed to the outbreaks. Officials say, dozens of the fires remain out of control, already scorching more than 460 square miles or 300,000 acres. Cooler weather is on the way and could offer some relief to firefighters. The hot weather has also triggered a faster snow melt, triggering floods in neighboring British Columbia, and so far, there have been no reports of any deaths.
 
All right. Still ahead, King Charles has been crowned but the celebrations continue today with the likes of Lionel Richie and Katy Perry. We're live from outside of Buckingham Palace with all the details coming up next, stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[04:20:00]
 
BRUNHUBER:  All right. You're looking at one of more than a dozen gun salutes fired from locations across the U.K. during Saturday's historic coronation. They were time to start the moment that King Charles III was crowned by the archbishop of Canterbury. Charles is only the seventh monarch to wear St Edward's Crown.
 
Festivities marking the coronation will continue in the hours ahead after a daylong celebration packed with pomp and pageantry and plenty of history. Tens of thousands braved the rain to witness the moment of Buckingham Palace when the king, queen, and other royals appeared on the balcony.
 
And our own Royal Correspondent Max Foster covered all of it, Saturday, and he joins us now to preview the events in the coming hours. So, Max, what can we expect?
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN ROYAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, today's party day, really. So, street parties up and down the United Kingdom. They created a map for the number of street parties, and they are -- they do appear to be hundreds. People are just gathering in their local streets, basically, with neighbors, with a table down the middle of the road and celebrating the coronation.
 
And tonight, there will be a big concert at Windsor Castle. Lionel Richie and many other big names appearing there. And we're expecting Prince William to make a speech about his father these. So, a lot of people are looking forward to that because that will be televised here in the United Kingdom. A lot more informal, let's say, than yesterday's formalities.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER (voiceover):  A day of destiny, the patient prince crowned at last. Charles III, king of the United Kingdom and Commonwealth Realms. London stood still as well wishers lined the streets, huddled in the rain to join the celebration of British monarchy. Leaders, dignitaries, family members and celebrities, more than 2,000 gathered in Westminster Abbey for this once in a generation event.
 
Prince Harry entered alongside other royals including Prince Andrew, Prince Edward, Princess Beatrice, and Princess Eugenie. The Prince and Princess of Wales arrived behind the king and queen and followed them into the Abbey in what appeared to be a break from the schedule. King and queen married in 2005 arrived in splendor. The couple wore their respective robes of states. Camilla in the Robe of State originally made for Queen Elizabeth II. The deeply religious ceremony moved through several stages. First the recognition, Charles faced the four points of the compass, symbolically representing himself to the people.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I here represent unto you, King Charles.
 
FOSTER (voiceover):  Breaking from tradition, Charles read a prayer aloud.
 
CHARLES III, KING OF THE UNITED KINGDOM:  We may discover the ways of gentleness and be led into the paths of peace.
 
FOSTER (voiceover):  Another first, a gospel choir before the oath, Charles acknowledged the role of the Church of England to foster an environment in which people of all faiths and beliefs may live freely.
 
KING CHARLES III:  I will.
 
FOSTER (voiceover):  70 years since his mother before him, Charles fulfills his destiny and takes his place in the holy lineage of kings and queens. Made for the last King Charles in 1661, the sovereign crown comprises solid gold set with rubies and sapphires and other gems. Would the crown fit?
 
JUSTIN WELBY, ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY:  God save the King.
 
CROWD:  God save the King.
 
FOSTER (voiceover):  Queen Camilla received her own coronation. Like her husband, she was anointed with holy oil and the keeper of the jewel house, then presented the consort's ring, marrying her to the king, to God, and their people. From Westminster Abbey to Buckingham Palace, a vast procession of 4,000 ceremonial troops accompanied the royals into a new era, a new Britain ruled by its newly crowned monarchy.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[04:25:00]
 
FOSTER (on camera):  So, we don't know when we're going to see King Charles and Queen Camilla next. Everything is breaking down here as the focused attention moves to Windsor tonight.
 
BRUNHUBER:  Interesting. And so, Max, as you mentioned in your report there, Prince Harry was at the coronation. But I understand he didn't stay in London for very long after the ceremony. Is that right?
 
FOSTER:  Yes. So, well, I've been told that he didn't receive an invitation for the balcony moment. And then we're hearing from the Press Association that he was spotted on a plane back to the U.S. last night. So, he left straight from the Abbey, from what we can tell, back to the U.S. It was his son, Archie's, birthday yesterday. So, that might be part of the story as well.
 
BRUNHUBER:  Interesting. All right. So many plots there. Thanks so much, Max Foster. I really appreciate it.
 
So, not everyone was rejoicing as the historic event got underway. London police arrested dozens of antimonarchy protestors ahead of the coronation for a variety of offenses. The last report, all of them remained in custody. The police have faced criticism for its robust approach towards demonstrators during this momentous event but they say they have a duty to intervene when protest becomes criminal.
 
So, as the Prince of Wales, Charles has been passionate about climate change issues for decades. Now that he is King Charles, will he make any real impact on saving the environment? We'll have insights from one of the country's top environmental campaigners later this hour. Stay with us.

BRUNHUBER:  Welcome back to all of you watching here in the United States, Canada, and all around the world. I'm Kim Brunhuber and this "CNN Newsroom".
 <br>[04:30:00]
 
The City of Allen, Texas is in mourning this hour after eight people were killed in another U.S. mass shooting. Police say, the gunman was also killed by an officer after he opened fire on a crowded mall. Seven victims were taken to the hospital and some are in critical condition. Republican Congressman from Texas says, he was praying for the victims' families and he pushed back against critics who say, prayers aren't enough. Here he is.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. KEITH SELF (R-TX):  For those are people that don't believe in an almighty God who has -- who is absolutely in control of our lives. I'm a Christian. I believe that he is. We have people though with mental health that we're not taking care of. Since this nation made the decision that we were going to close the mental health institutions, many of these situations are based on that.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER:  The congressman also urged people to focus on the victims instead of politics.
 
Moscow is blaming Ukraine and several western nations for an apparent attack on pro-Kremlin military blogger about 400 kilometers east of Moscow. A Russian state news agency says Zakhar Prilepin was wounded after a roadside bomb targeted his car on Saturday. Investigators say they later arrested a suspect who reportedly confessed he received his orders from Ukraine.
 
The Ukrainian secret service -- security service, rather, is neither confirming nor denying its involvement in the blast. Prilepin has a telegram channel with some 300,000 followers. Another pro-Kremlin blogger was killed in an explosion in St. Petersburg last month. The Ukraine has denied any role in that attack.
 
Meanwhile, a Russian mercenary leader says he's laying groundwork for his possible pullout from Bakhmut. Wagner boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said his troops would withdraw by Wednesday because of a lack of ammunition. And now, Prigozhin says, Wagner will hand over their positions to the forces of this man, notorious Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov. He's an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin and also has a private army fighting in Ukraine.
 
So, for more on all of this, Sam Kiley joins us from Kyiv. So, Sam, what more are we learning about this development and what it could mean for the long ongoing battle for this key city?
 
SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Kim, what we've heard is that Kadyrov has said that he is fine with that handover, which is supposed to happen, in their words, on May the 10th, today. And they have also said, this is Kadyrov, that any Wagner fighters that want to stay on and continue to fight in that location, he would guarantee them better ammunition and better supplies if they want to continue to prosecute that war.
 
Now, from the Ukrainian perspective, they haven't really reacted with any kind of energy because this is part of what they see, as something of a soup opera being generated by Prigozhin. They're intrigued by the extent to which he constantly and frequently and very publicly criticizes the Russian ministry of defense. Complains about a lack of ammunition, allows photographs, indeed, points to pictures of his own dead soldiers or allegedly dead soldiers on the Bakhmut front line, and constantly claims to be on the verge of victory.
 
If they were to do a pullout of Wagner and a replacement with Kadyrov's Chechens, this is relief in place. A rip as the military, we call it, will provide the Ukrainians with a delicious opportunity when their enemy is at its most vulnerable to a counterattack. And I think we could imagine that that would be an almost certainty. This is something that the Ukrainians, I think, who are on the backfoot at the moment in Bakhmut would relish. Kim.
 
BRUNHUBER:  Interesting. All right. And then, Sam, another incident of note. Ukraine claiming it shot down a hypersonic missile. What more are we learning about that?
 
KILEY:  Well, this is an extraordinary technological feat. We've only got the Ukrainian's word on this at the moment, but the Patriot missiles, supplied by Ukraine's allies, notably Germany and the United States. American made missiles were conceived and developed before the existence of hypersonic missiles. The Russians have got these missiles so they claim they can travel at 10 times the speed of sound. The Patriot is not supposed to be able to knock them down.
 
So, if they have been able to shoot one down, that gives a bit of an additional edge, an unexpected edge to the Patriot batteries that have been promised to Ukraine. But they are saying that they need a far greater amount of air defensives, not just against these hypersonic missiles but, of course, the huge amounts of very basic drones that the Russians send that are supplied by Iran right through their cruise missiles and these Kinzhal hypersonic.
 
But it is a significant breakthrough, but it's also a very grubby, murderous war at a ground level today.
 <br>[04:35:00]
 
For example, Kim, the Ukrainians saying that six emergency workers involved in demining were killed by a Russian bombardment on -- in Kherson Province. That province, of course, was liberated last year as part of what they hope will be another offensive that the Ukrainians are hoping to prosecute this summer. Kim.
 
BRUNHUBER:  All right. Appreciate it. Sam Kiley, thanks so much.
 
Dozens of prisoners of war have been returned to Ukraine, among them 42 men and three women in an apparent prisoner swap.

A glimmer of hope in Sudan at this hour as representatives of the two warring factions have gone to Saudi Arabia, reportedly for face-to- face talks. A prominent Saudi diplomat tweet on Saturday morning suggested that representatives of the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces had arrived in Jeddah. But so far, there is no confirmation. A meeting has taken place. A supposed ceasefire is underway in the county but people on the ground told CNN that RSF forces were trying to take control of a strategically located hospitals to use as bases.
 
Meanwhile, Turkey says it's moving its embassy in Sudan because of security concerns. The Turkish foreign minister says the move from Khartoum to Port Sudan is temporary but necessary after the car the Turkey's ambassador was fired on in the Sudanese capital.
 
Funerals have begun in Serbia after two mass shootings in as many days. Services were held Saturday for a security guard killed along with eight children when a gunman went on a rampage in a school in capital Belgrade. Police say, a 13-year-old is in custody and undergoing psychiatric assessment. A day later, eight more people were killed in a separate shooting in villages south of the capitol. The country has declared three days of mourning and there's anger and sadness across Serbia.

BRUNHUBER:  Iran has executed the dual Swedish Iranian citizen and Sweden was furious about it. A media outlet affiliated with Iran's government says Iran, on Saturday, put to death Habib Chaab. Accused him of being the leader of a separatist group responsible for the shooting attack on the military parade in 2018 that killed 29 people. Sweden staunchly opposes the death penalty and summoned Iran's ambassador to complain.

BRUNHUBER:  For decades, King Charles has been a vocal advocate for climate change issues and protecting the environment. One of his private residences, Highgrove House is a prime example of his commitment to sustainability. The estate's gardens have environmentally friendly features like solar panels and a natural sewage system. In 2021, he attended the COP26 climate change conference in Glasgow as then-Prince of Wales where he called on world leaders to take more meaningful action on climate change. Here he is.

BRUNHUBER:  All right. Let's bring in Craig Bennett, the CEO of The Wildlife Trusts, a group of 46 independent wildlife conservation charities in the U.K. Thanks so much for being here with us. All right. So, we know of King Charles' interests in the environment, but what are his bona fides on the subject?
 
CRAIG BENNETT, CEO, THE WILDLIFE TRUSTS:  Well, I think the first thing to say is that King Charles has been really interested and passionate and concerned about these issues for a long time before it was trendy to do so. You know, he's been a patron of The Wildlife Trusts since 1977. And the first speech he made on the environment was back in the very early 1970s when he highlighted the link between air pollution and the impact on peoples' health. So, he's been a world leader on this issue and he's often led the way well before many other people to highlight just how important the climate major crises are and how we've really got to move much faster to address these interlinked crises.
 
BRUNHUBER:  So -- I mean, the sovereign is meant to stay out of politics. So, looking ahead to what this actually means, what can he really do? Can he make a real material difference? And if so, how?
 
BENNETT:  Well, I mean, the first thing to say is -- you know, this is an issue, in the U.K. at least, where this cross-party political support for -- in theory at least, for action on the climate and nature crisis. But sadly, often, government struggle to make the progress that is needed in the context of short-term electoral cycle.
 
So, you know, you can have a big discussion whether we should or shouldn't have a monarchy. But, I mean, if you're going to have a monarch -- a monarchy, arguably, one of the things that absolutely we should do is be thinking about the long term and trying to deal with those issues that are actually short-term politics is very bad at dealing with, and surely the environment is one of those.
 
But the primary reasons -- primary way in which he goes about this is really to convene. He, sort of, quite gently, actually, invites people to come together. Make sure that those gathering of the right people at the right moment to have the conversations that need to happen to try and make progress. And he will sometimes quite gently invite people to think about what's needs to happen to protect the planet but also, therefore, humanity in the longer term.
 
And he's done this to really, kind of, leading approaches on a whole range of issues. Rainforests, obviously, air pollution, the oceans, wildlife, and climate as well. But I think it's also worth and precise, you know, one of the things he's been fantastic at, sometimes often better than many people of the environmental community is he understands the interlinkages between these.
 
You know, very often you have specialists that really specialize in the individual issues across the sustainability of gender. What I think, his majesty, the King, has always been very good at doing this spotting (ph), what some people would call a system level approach. Understanding all the connections between these issues and how they're inextricably linked.
 
We can't hope to solve the climate crisis unless we put nature on recovery for example. We can't hope to solve the major crisis unless we tackle climate change. And the king has always understood that.

BRUNHUBER:  When you mentioned that, sort of, the question about, you know, whether there should be a monarchy. I mean, you touched on one of the central questions that's been, sort of, a theme during this coronation time. And looking at that question of the relevance of the monarchy, I saw one statistic that popped out. Among young people, 38 percent said they preferred an elected head of state, and 78 percent said they weren't interested in the royal family. So, could this be an issue that gives the king and the monarchy more broadly -- more relevance, particularly with young people?
 
BENNETT:  I mean, I don't think for a minute that that's why the king has had this long interest in these issues. It comes from a deep place within him and he's long been very passionate about these. And it's, unquestionably, there's real authenticity to his concern about these issues.
 
But, I mean, there is the case that, you know, as I was saying, that a monarch, one of the things that they need to do is, of course, think about the long term and almost catch those issues that the governments aren't so good dealing with. And that, inevitably, obviously it's like the environment, sadly. And that -- and I think, obviously, we also know that young people are incredibly concerned about the state of environment and need to see faster action on this.
 
So, I think there is an issue here that it's, sort of -- kind of, a good way to reach out to younger people and to enable and inspire young people to get involved. So, I think what the king has done through -- over many, many decades have created many opportunities for young people to speak up and be heard, whether it's on social justice issues which is done through things like the Prince's Trust and empower them to do so, or whether it's through these sustainability issues where time and again he has recognized the huge importance for young people to be able to have a voice dealing on dealing with the environmental crisis. So, I think, unquestionably, it makes it very relevant.
 
BRUNHUBER:  Well, let's hope he can make a difference. We'll have to leave it there, but thank you so much for being with us. Craig Bennett, really appreciate it.
 
BENNETT:  Thank you.
 
BRUNHUBER:  Well, what some may see as an unlikely friendship between the man who would be king and the people who deliver lunch, the cross- cultural relationship leading to an invitation to the coronation. Vedika Sud reports from New Delhi.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VEDIKA SUD, CNN REPORTER (voiceover):  One of the many celebrations across the globe marking the coronation of his majesty, King Charles III.
 
WELBY:  God save the King.
 
CROWD:  God save the King.
 
SUD (voiceover):  These are Mumbai's dabbawalas. Long before Uber Eats, they have been delivering hundreds of thousands of lunch boxes of dabbas on foot and by bike in one of the world's busiest cities for over 120 years. A 2010 study by the Harvard Business School graded them six sigma, which means they have a 99.9 percent efficiency rate. Their first brush with British royalty came in 2023 when the then- Prince Charles met the dabbawalas during a royal tour of India and was left impressed by their work. Since then, they formed a close association with the royal family. They were invited to King Charles's wedding to Queen Camilla Parker Bowles in London in 2005.
 
VISHNU KALDOKE, SPOKESPERSON, MUMBAI DABBAWALLA ASSOCIATION (through translator): The dabbawalas have good relations with the royal family. So, keeping this in mind, Prince Charles is going to be crowned as the king of Britain after the death of Queen Elizabeth II. So, we are very happy. We thought of giving him gifts on May the 6th, the day of his coronation. We are giving him a turban and a shawl of the Warkari community.
 
SUD (voiceover):  And they were invited to his coronation. They weren't able to attend. but earlier this week they were out picking presents. On Tuesday. members of the Mumbai Dabbawalas Association presented a turban and a shawl for his majesty at an event at the British consulate. A small gesture for a king they see as a friend.

PATRICK SNELL, CNN WORLD SPORT ANCHOR:  Well, the run for the roses is always one of the biggest days on the U.S. sports calendar, but the buildup to this year's Kentucky Derby well and truly overshadowed, though. Two more horses, Chloe's dream and Freezing Point having to be put down following races that were held earlier in the day on Saturday.
 
Now, PETA, that's People for the Ethical Treatment for Animals putting out a statement saying, Churchill Downs is a killing field. Freezing Point is the latest casualty. He's the second horse to die today at the track, making it an appalling seven deaths in advance of the Kentucky Derby. They should play taps at the Derby instead of My Old Kentucky Home.
 
Two of the horses that died earlier in the week were trained by Saffie Joseph Jr. He was suspended and the horse he was training for the Derby, Lord Miles, being pulled from the race. Saffie says, he's been made out to be a scapegoat and did nothing wrong.
 
Five horses had to drop out of Saturday's race. The latest was Forte who began the morning as the betting favorite. He injured his foot in training on Thursday. Well, that meant 18 horses started the first leg of horse racing's coveted triple crown and a thrilling race it would be. And this, the 149th edition of the Derby, a close forward contest seeing Mage with a studding late surge to seal a famous victory.
 
The three-year-old chestnut colt ridden by Venezuelan jockey Javier Castellano edging out Two Phil's who finished in second place, and Angel of Empire who finished in third. This, in front of the over 150 fans in attendance.

Mage will now have a chance to continue their chase for the elusive triple crown at the Preakness Stakes later on this month. The third leg is at the Belmont Stakes in June. Well, in the end, a winter saver for Mage, albeit one that now caps of a sad and indeed really troubling week at historic Churchill Downs. Back to you.
