THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
<br>[09:00:00] 
 
MATT EGAN, CNN REPORTER: Scenario, where other countries do retaliate, and even more workers are deported, employment would be 9 percent lower. So, again, fewer jobs, not more.
 
But what's really telling here is the inflation part of this, because Trump has said that his tariffs, his deportations will help the cost of living. But this report finds, again, the opposite, that by 2026 we would see inflation go up to 6 percent, even in the low scenario -
 
KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR: Wow.
 
EGAN: And 9.3 percent in the high scenario. So, remember, inflation today, it's around 2.5 percent. The goal is 2 percent. They're saying it could go to 9 percent. That would be worse than two years ago, except it would be self-inflicted.
 
A really key line from the authors here. They say that, "we find, ironically, that despite his make the foreigners pay rhetoric, this package of policies does more damage to the U.S. economy than to any other in the world."
 
Which, Kate, I just think it brings us to one of the ironies here, right? The economy is the number one issue. Voters say they trust Trump over Harris on the economy. And yet these experts, when they dig into the policies, they say that he wouldn't just fail to fix inflation, he would actually make things worse.
 
BOLDUAN: Brutal, brutal analysis for sure. 
 
Thank you so much, Matt.
 
EGAN: Thank you, Kate.
 
BOLDUAN: We're going to head over to Florida right now where the governor of Florida is holding an update on Hurricane Helene as it's making its way to the Gulf Coast.
 
GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): Department of Transportation and Major General John Haas from the Florida National Guard. As you know, as of 8:00 a.m., Hurricane Helene is now a category two hurricane. It is located 365 miles south of Apalachicola. It is expected to speed up throughout the day. And it's expected to make landfall in northern Florida sometime this evening.
 
Maximum sustained winds are currently about 100 miles per hour. It is possible that this storm could make landfall as a major hurricane, as a category three, or even, potentially, a category four.
 
It is moving fast. More rainfall is, of course, expected. And it could lead to significant storm surge in our coastal areas. 
 
And so, we are prepared for that, of course. And we'll see what happens in terms of the intensification. I think that these things can rapidly intensify. Sometimes they become majors. Sometimes there's changes. So, we're just going to continue to do our thing and assume that this is going to be a major hurricane when it makes landfall.
 
This is a very large storm. So, you're going to see tropical weather that's going to extend hundreds of miles away from the center of the storm. It doesn't necessarily mean you're going to have a hurricane category three winds say on the east coast of Florida, but you are going to have tropical conditions. It is going to be nasty throughout the latter part of the day here in the state of Florida.
 
We are, of course, looking at the track. If you look at the 8:00 a.m. advisory. And I think this has been happening probably for probably the last eight hours. The models are nudging the center of the storm a little bit east. And that's significant when you're talking about Tallahassee because I think yesterday we were looking at an eyewall that was probably just on the western part of the city. When these storms hit, the northeast part of the storm is usually the most damaging. And so to the extent it is tracking east and mirroring more of an Idalia track rather than a direct hit on Tallahassee, that is going to impact the extent of the damage. This area has not had a major hurricane hit in quite some time and certainly nobody in recent memory has seen a storm of this magnitude that has hit. 
 
So, we'll watch that. There's no guarantee that it's going to continue on that trend, but we have seen that slight trend. And that could potentially be very impactful if you're talking another 30 or 40 miles to the east versus maintaining course or even toggling a little bit west.
 
There will be debris either way. Obviously, if it hits direct into Tallahassee, with the - with the trees that we have here, and it's nice, but it will cause a lot of damage. We have been - Kevin and his team have been working with local governments throughout the state, but particularly throughout this region, about making sure they have their debris contracts ready to go. There's going to be a need to get debris out of the roadways. Kevin and his team are going to be helping. 
 
Jared and his team are going to be helping. But then also with power restoration. You want to be able to get the - the power back on. The linemen are going to have to access these power lines. And that could be more challenging in an area like Tallahassee than it would be in areas that may not be as wooded. 
 
So, those debris - all local governments, do your debris contracts. You're going to get FEMA reimbursement for this. Fiscally constrained counties, we've stepped up at the state level and helped them in the past. But I think you can anticipate that there's going to be a need for some serious debris removal. 
 <br>[09:05:01]
 
So, please take the appropriate steps. 
 
As we've said all along, this storm was never projected to make landfall in - on kind of the Florida peninsula gulf coast. Whether you're talking about Sarasota, Tampa, some of those areas. But, because it's such a big storm, it's churning a lot of water. And so you're going to see surge all up and down the west coast of Florida. The water is going to rise. And that is going to create hazards as well. 
 
So, just because you're outside the cone, and I think a lot of those parts on the west coast of Florida are probably outside the cone, that does not mean that you're not going to see significant impacts.
 
We have, overnight, had 14 different tornado warnings. There's likely to be more of those throughout today. Warnings were issued in Palm Beach, Hendry, Glades, and Collier County.
 
Now, parts of our state are starting to feel the effects already. Certainly if you're in north Florida, you still have time to execute your plan, but you've got to do it now. You have time to get to a shelter, but you've got to do it now. Every minute that goes by brings us closer to having conditions that are going to be simply too dangerous to navigate. 
 
But if you are in the northern part of the state and you have access and you're in an evacuation zone and you've been told to evacuate, you do have time to do it now, so do it, but don't wait another six hours, seven hours and say, oh, man, this thing looks big and think that you're going to want to go out. That will be very hazardous to do that.
 
With all of the evacuation orders, there's going to be a time, and some of that time may have been reached in southern parts of the state, where your local official is going to tell you it's too late to stay put. I don't think that we've reached that in northern Florida yet.
 
But wherever you are, if your local EM officials say that it's - that it's too hazardous to go and that you're better off just hunkering down, heed that advice. I know Jared's talking about - with the folks about the winds. We're looking at the Skyway Bridge is having - I don't know if they've closed it yet, but I think that was imminent. So, you're starting to see this. So, just listen to your local officials depending on where you are in the state. 
 
And there will be - come a time in north Florida as the hours pass today where they may tell you, stay put. But - but don't put yourself at risk. We have fatalities on the roadways and hazardous conditions almost every storm, and those can be avoidable - avoided with proper planning. 
 
Remember also, we're going to experience power outages. A lot of people use generators. And that's - that's great. But please use the generator properly. If you use the generator inside your house, that could kill you. You've got to keep the generator outside the house a safe distance from any doors or windows. You can't let the carbon monoxide get into your home. So, please, use the generators appropriately.
 
Also, in terms of shelters. So, if you are in an evacuation zone, you've been ordered, some people just recommended evacuation, some people may not have been told to but they look and maybe they feel like they need to get out, there are shelters available. 
 
If you want to look at the shelters available in your particular county, go to floridadisaster.org/shelters and you will see the options that you have. All counties are required to have at least one pet-friendly shelter. So, please, do not leave your pets behind. Make sure that you take them with them. We want to keep our pets safe in addition to - to our families.
 
The Division of Emergency Management has partnered with Uber, we announced yesterday, to provide free rides to shelters for Floridians in counties that are under a state of emergency, which is, you know, almost all of them at this point. So, if you want to use that, the Uber code is "helenerelief" when you book your ride. Just one - all in one, no space, "helenerelief," when you book your ride. So, take advantage of that.
 
Obviously, we're reaching the point where that's not going to be an option as this storm gets closer. But I can tell you, you know, if you're in - in Tallahassee, if you're in Wakulla, if you're in some of the northern Florida, and there's Ubers available, you still have time right now to be able to take advantage of that. 
 
Lastly, as we've learned in major storms, two of the greatest dangers are tree limbs falling on roofs, as well as driving during the storm. 
 
So, once the storm hits, do not go out on the roadways. There will be hazardous conditions. Do not drive in standing water. You're going to see roadways that are going to be flooded throughout the state of Florida. You're putting yourself at risk if you do that.
 
Also, if you're sheltering at your home, be aware of the tree limbs that are on your property or in - or adjacent to your home. 
 <br>[09:10:01]
 
Try to be in an interior room or away from limbs that could fall through the roof or window and cause harm. And we do see fatalities that happen in these storms because of tree limbs falling on homes. And you can have a great home that can withstand a category three storm winds. It's a lot more difficult to withstand a big tree falling on your roof. So, take a look at that and know that that is a very real hazard when it comes to this storm JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: All right, you've been listening to Florida
 
 Governor Ron DeSantis speaking here in Tallahassee, not far from where I am right now. John Berman here. This is CNN's special live coverage of Hurricane Helene, which is right now a category two storm strengthening as it moves north and is due to make landfall tonight on the Florida coast as a major hurricane, a category three, maybe even a category four storm.
 
What you just heard from Governor DeSantis was a warning to the people here in northern Florida along the big bend. Basically, he said, you still have time to get out, but you have to do it now. Heed the warnings from local officials and get out if you are told to do so. Now is the time.
 
Along the big bend area, there could be storm surge of 15 to 20 feet. That, we are told, is unsurvivable. That is why the governor is issuing that warning. 
 
He also noted that power could be out for some time. He also noted, as you're looking at the so-called cone there of where this storm could hit, don't just pay attention to the cone. This storm is so big, it's going to have impacts over the entire Florida peninsula. Whether it means rain or wind, or that storm surge. 
 
All right, CNN is covering this story up and down the coast. We've got Carlos Suarez in Gulfport, in Pinellas County. We've got Marybel Gonzalez in Steen Hatchie, Florida. That is part of the big bend where this storm could push that surge. 
 
First, though, I'm going to go to Allison Chinchar at the weather center to get a sense of the very latest forecast.
 
Allison.
 
ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Yes, that's right. 
 
So, it is a category two storm currently churning in the Gulf of Mexico. In the last few frames here we've really started to get a more definitive eye develop in this particular storm. That shows that it is continuing to strengthen. And we anticipate that this storm will continue to strengthen as we go through the rest of the day today. 
 
We now have not one but two separate tornado watches. One in effect for about two-thirds of Florida, the other for portions of Georgia and South Carolina. And more of these are likely to come as we go through the next 24 to 48 hours. We've had several tornado warnings off and on for both Florida, Georgia, as well as South Carolina. More of those are expected as more of those outer bands begin to creep into these states. 
 
The storm is expected to become a major hurricane later on today before making landfall tonight near the big bend region. And at that point the forward speed well pick up quite considerably. And what that really means is, it means it can make it pretty far inland before its able to weaken back down to a tropical storm. So, you're going to have cities that are well away from the ocean that are still looking at hurricane force winds. 
 
And then from there it continues up into portions of Tennessee, where it's just going to kind of hover. And that's going to allow a lot of rain to get dropped in some of these areas. Widespread. A lot of these portions of these states are looking at four to eight inches of rain, but some spots not out of the question to pick up ten or even 12 inches before this system finally moves out. 
 
We showed you the two tornado watches in effect. More are likely to come because this entire area you see here has the potential for severe weather. We're talking waterspouts, tornadoes and the potential for damaging winds. 
 
Now again, the flood threat is really what's going to be widespread. And it exists, obviously, where we have landfall. But even imminently after that, you can see the wide swath. It stretches into Georgia, portions of eastern Alabama, as well as the Carolinas. And we're also going to continue to see more of this, not only today, but the rainfall will continue for many of these states throughout the day on Friday.
 
BERMAN: All right, Allison Chinchar, at the Weather Center. 
 
This is CNN's special live coverage of Hurricane Helene. We're going to get to some of the areas already feeling this the most right after the break.

 <br>[09:18:51]
 
JESSICA DEAN, CNN ANCHOR: Breaking news, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy just arrived on Capitol Hill. You see him there with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. He's going to be meeting with a bipartisan group of lawmakers. 
 
And we have new reporting this morning. President Biden just announcing nearly $8 billion of additional military aid for Ukraine. 
 
CNN congressional correspondent Lauren Fox, live on Capitol Hill, monitoring all of this.
 
And, Lauren, his visit to The Hill comes as he is pushing America and U.S. - U.S. lawmakers from more assistance in its war fighting back against Russia.
 
LAUREN FOX, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Jessica. And this comes at a really critical moment because this is the last opportunity perhaps that he's going to have to meet with this exact Congress. A lot can change after the November election. The political dynamics certainly could shift underneath his feet.
 
And the support that he's been relying on, including from Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has been a vocal advocate to trying to encourage members of the Republican Party to continue supporting Ukraine in the Senate, he's going to be stepping down as the Republican leader. So, this meeting today is not just in the Senate with Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, but also other key Republican and Democratic senators who are going to be able to carry this mantle forward given the fact that this war has no view of ending anytime soon, Jessica.
 <br>[09:20:15]
 
When he goes to the House of Representatives later today, he is going to meet with Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leader, and members of the Armed Services Committee, but he won't be meeting with Speaker Mike Johnson. 
 
Now, Johnson has met with Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the past. Obviously, he made a major political gamble by putting additional aid for Ukraine on the floor of the House just a couple of months ago. But it gives you a great sense right now of the political position that Johnson finds himself in, in which this meeting, obviously, could have a very difficult outcome for him given the fact that there are those on his right flank who were already mad that he put additional aid for Ukraine on the floor. It's really going to be interesting to see whether or not any future aid can come out of a new Congress. 
 
Jessica.
 
DEAN: Yes, and interesting to see that contrast between House Republicans. And then you see Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell walking there with him, obviously meeting with him.
 
Lauren Fox, on The Hill, thank you so much. 
 
John.
 
BERMAN: All right, Hurricane Helene is now a category two storm, expected to strengthen before it makes landfall tonight as a major hurricane, either a category three, maybe even a category four storm. Expected to hit about 20 miles south of where I am, along the big bend coast, but could easily move over Tallahassee, the capital of Florida, part of Leon County. 
 
And with me now is county administrator Vincent Long.
 
Administrator, thank you so much for being with us. 
 
I was reading that Tallahassee has never actually recorded hurricane strength - sustained hurricane strength winds. It's possible this is the most powerful storm ever to pass over where we are right now. 
 
VINCENT LONG, LEON COUNTY, FLORIDA, ADMINISTRATOR: Well, thanks for having me, John. 
 
That's right. We are certainly no strangers to hurricanes here. Since 2016, we have experienced the impacts of five hurricanes. This - Helene will be the sixth. And she certainly has our full attention. We're very focused here. As you - as you might imagine, we've been monitoring the systems since its very early stages, and we've been actively preparing our community to best protect them from what is now a very powerful, as you mentioned, system, which we expect will have significant impacts in our community. 
 
But we're hopeful too that our citizens who, again, have a lot of experience with storms have heated all of our - all of our guidance on this and the warnings and they have effectuated their plans. 
 
And again, we are about as prepared as we can be with all of the early coordination and communication that has taken place so far. Very soon, though, we will be we are bracing for the impact of this storm. Soon thereafter we will do damage assessments. And then thereafter we will get about the work of rolling up our sleeves and restoring our community.
 
BERMAN: So, one of the challenges here in Leon County, and I'm not sure people can see behind me - no, not behind me, but - but almost everywhere I look, big, beautiful trees. The live oaks a feature of Tallahassee and this county. But also I have to believe a challenge in a storm like this, correct?
 
LONG: Well, that's right, John. I mean we have told our citizens from very early on, we've advised to prepare for thousands of trees down and literally hundreds of roads blocked and prolonged power outages. As you mentioned, we've not experienced anything like this, although we've had, again, very significant experience. 
 
But at this point in time, again, with just hours to go and not much time to prepare, we're advising citizens who haven't sought shelter in our - in a shelter who are in manufactured homes, or mobile homes. We've done a mandatory evacuation from mobile homes. And any of those folks who have not sought shelter in one of our seven shelters throughout the community, we are advising that they do so now or do so very, very soon. Again, we're almost out of time as far as that goes. 
 
For those people who have decided to stay in their home,  it's time to make sure that that home is as buttoned up as it can be, and that people are very mindful of those trees, which have been saturated in this rain that you've been experiencing over the last 12 hours or so. A very - very mindful of those trees and downed power lines. And, of course, again, we're providing that - that kind of guidance. We - and we want people to continue to heed the official guidance coming out of the EOC, which will not only help them protect their families, but will greatly assist us in our community response and recovery.
 <br>[09:25:03]
 
BERMAN: Vincent Long, the Leon County administrator, thank you for the work you're doing. Thanks for being great hosts to us here as we ride out this storm with the rest of you. Appreciate it.
 
And I'm just going to reiterate the message that the administrator, Vincent Long, just sent, which is that if you live in this area, north Florida, you've got an hour, maybe two to evacuate if that is your plan. But beyond that, you've got to stay where you are and ride this out. Get somewhere safe. Because every hour that passes, this will become more dangerous. This is CNN's special live coverage of Hurricane Helene.
 
We'll be right back.

BERMAN: All right, welcome back. I'm John Berman, in Tallahassee, Florida. This is CNN's special live coverage of Hurricane Helene.
