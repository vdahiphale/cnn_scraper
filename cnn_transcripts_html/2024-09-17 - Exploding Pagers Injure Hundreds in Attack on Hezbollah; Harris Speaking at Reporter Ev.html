ISA SOARES, HOST, ISA SOARES TONIGHT:  A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, thousands are wounded in Lebanon after 
 
 deadly pagers explosion across the country, Hezbollah is pointing the finger at Israel, we'll have more details ahead on this breaking news 
 
 story. 
 
Plus, Sean "Diddy" Combs is charged with racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. The details -- well, rather disturbing. He's due in a federal 
 
 court this hour, we'll bring that to you live. And extreme weather is causing chaos in Europe right now with catastrophic flooding in central 
 
 Europe, and deadly fires ranging in Portugal. 
 
But first, we begin with an apparent coordinated attack across Lebanon. The Lebanese Health Minister says that at least nine people have been killed 
 
 and nearly 3,000 others injured when hand-held pages suddenly exploded. Both the government and Hezbollah blame Israel. Hezbollah is vowing 
 
 revenge.   
 
The explosions targeted Hezbollah members, but civilians were also affected including an 8-year-old girl who was killed. Footage of the pages exploding 
 
 have been circulating, are still circulating on social media. Of course, we want to warn you, the next video is disturbing.

SOARES:  And that explosion happened as you can see there in a supermarket, you can see a man falling to the floor and then clutching his stomach. More 
 
 than 100 hospitals right across Lebanon are treating casualties, at least 170 people are reportedly in critical condition with many injuries to the 
 
 face, especially the eye area.
 
I'm joined now by CNN's chief international security correspondent, Nick Paton Walsh. And Nick, I mean, this is a major security breach, but first 
 
 of all, let's talk about this rather violence we saw there and widespread - - 
 
NICK PATON WALSH, CNN INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  Yes -- 
 
SOARES:  Attacks. What more are you learning?   
 
WALSH:  Yes, I mean, it's kind of extraordinary, it appears that at 3:30 this afternoon, multiple pages -- unclear if the same model or what the 
 
 connection between these devices are, but Hezbollah admit that these explosions targeted their members and what they called some of their units. 
 
Now, the death toll has risen to nine, we're talking about over 170 critically injured here at this point. And it is probably one of the most 
 
 widespread acts of violence to hit across Lebanon since the war with Israel in 2006. There was a Beirut port blast, and that was concentrated in the 
 
 capital. 
 
This hit all around Hezbollah's stronghold it seems in the country. Now, we don't know if some of these devices were in the hands of non-Hezbollah 
 
 members. There is some suggestion that this may have been a particular kind of device that only that armed militant group used. But it's a shocking 
 
 violation of their own internal security. 
 
This is a group that I've been with, you know, who are very cautious about handing our phone numbers, used burner phones, appear to have moved to this 
 
 pager device, so they can stay away from smartphones like this -- 
 
SOARES:  Yes --
 
WALSH:  Which the Israelis have been phenomenally good at using to track people down. And so, this psychological impact, not just against Hezbollah, 
 
 secretive, very careful about their whereabouts, suddenly finding devices exploding and causing horrific injuries to some of them. 
 
But the Lebanese in general, to find that if it is the Israelis who have not commented on this so far as we have seen them do in the past, the 
 
 ability for their southern enemy to violate, to penetrate some of the most heavily-guarded areas for Lebanese Hezbollah is quite extraordinary. 
 
And I think that we're dealing now with a psychological shock, not just for Lebanese, but for Hezbollah themselves, who must be working out who's left 
 
 to call, how do I call them?   
 
SOARES:  Yes, and as you're talking I'm hearing that the State Department is talking, and Miller is basically saying that denying any U.S. 
 
 involvement, we -- it's the first time we are hearing from the United -- 
 
WALSH:  Yes -- 
 
SOARES:  States on this. We have heard from Hezbollah who are blaming, as you said, Israel, we have yet to hear from Israel. 
 <br>[14:05:00] 
 
But you mentioned that Hezbollah psychology -- I mean, clearly, state of panic across the country as we saw. How do you think then Hezbollah -- how 
 
 do you think Hezbollah retaliate, because it has said it would? 
 
WALSH:  Look, I mean, I think the key question here is less about how Hezbollah retaliates because their scope for that is going to be quite 
 
 limited. You know, dilemma(ph) you know, who's going to be in phone if you try and ring them at the moment -- 
 
SOARES:  Yes -- 
 
WALSH:  Until they've worked that out. The question I would be more keen to answer now is, is this the prelude if indeed it was Israel to a wider 
 
 Israeli operation? They have an extraordinary moment now where they have an advantage over their enemy -- 
 
SOARES:  Yes -- 
 
WALSH:  Who's command and control is all over the place, you may have key leaders in hospital right now who is just probably quite terrified to 
 
 getting communication with each other, period. Do you try and exploit that in the hours ahead to achieve a wider goal? 
 
Just yesterday, the Israeli Defense Minister met U.S. envoy and made it clear that in his belief, the moment for diplomacy to resolve the issue in 
 
 their northern border with southern Lebanon where Hezbollah are very fierce had passed, and a military option was now more likely. Now, this has been a 
 
 war of attrition for -- you know, we talked about -- 
 
SOARES:  Yes -- 
 
WALSH:  For nearly a year now. But the Israelis are clear, they want to get their citizens back to their homes in the north and all of this has been 
 
 tied, to stop this violence has been tied to a ceasefire deal, which now seems even more out of reach. So, we have this extraordinary moment now 
 
 where either the Israelis are delivering a singular blow to Hezbollah, saying essentially, we  know where you live, we know where you shop. We can 
 
 get to you any time -- 
 
SOARES:  We can get to you, yes -- 
 
WALSH:  So, potentially, push them in one direction or are they trying to generate this sort of confusion and panic so they can do something else. 
 
 And we'll learn that in the next couple of days. 
 
SOARES:  Nick, appreciate it, thank you very much. Well, let's get more on this and where we go from here. Let me bring in Fawaz Gerges; he's a 
 
 Professor of International Relations at the London School of Economics and Political Science. He's also the author of "What Really Went Wrong: The 
 
 West and the Failure of Democracy in the Middle East".  
 
And so, Fawaz, good to see you. Let me pick up really where Nick just left off, and that is where that leaves Hezbollah. The group is already saying 
 
 it will retaliate, blaming, quote, "criminal Israeli aggression". What are we likely to see you think? Is it beginning of something bigger as Nic was 
 
 perhaps suggesting?
 
FAWAZ GERGES, PROFESSOR, INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, LONDON SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS &amp; POLITICAL SCIENCE:  Well, I have no doubt in my mind that 
 
 Hezbollah will retaliate. It will not retaliate immediately. Hezbollah does not really basically act out of hand. Hezbollah will assess its options, 
 
 it's a moment of chaos. It's a moment of volatility. It's one of the greatest security breach of Hezbollah's communications. 
 
A large number of Hezbollah's fighters and commanders are injured, it will take Hezbollah quite a few days, but my take on it is that Hezbollah sees 
 
 this vast attack as a kind of really the first salvo in Israel's all-out war against Hezbollah. And just to add, you know, to what your 
 
 correspondent said earlier. 
 
Hezbollah has been planning for this moment for years. Hezbollah expects such moment. This is an organization, a party, a powerful military 
 
 organization that has been planning different emergencies. And I take it, even without communications, units will know what to do in such moments. 
 
 So, even though there's chaos, it's very unsettling for Hezbollah. 
 
My take is Hezbollah will retaliate much bigger than it has had before, but at the same time, Isa, Hezbollah will avoid a retaliation that triggers 
 
 all-out war with Israel. Hezbollah does not want a direct all-out war with Israel. It has been really trying to avoid targeting Israeli civilians for 
 
 the past 12 months. 
 
SOARES:  Yes -- 
 
GERGES:  And Hezbollah has made it very clear, it does not really want all- out war with Israel.
 
SOARES:  And so, Fawaz, I mean, given that, I mean, this is level of sophistication that we're seeing, that Nick was talking about and the 
 
 scale. This is perhaps -- is what you're hinting at, the first step in the broader escalation, right? That perhaps Israel is planning. We do not know 
 
 if Israel's behind this. 
 
And I only asked this because only yesterday, we saw -- we saw Israel obviously meeting -- in a security cabinet meeting, voting to expand its 
 
 war objectives to include the north, as Nick was pointing out there. So, frame this moment for us and frame the timing of this? 
 
GERGES:  Well, look that's why President Biden sent his personal envoy to Israel. And in fact, we have leaked information that the American, the 
 
 President Biden envoy told his Israeli counterparts, look, if you think that really a military, a bigger military campaign against Hezbollah will 
 
 basically allow your citizens to return to the north, you are delusional. 
 
In fact, an all-out war with Hezbollah-Israel could start such a war. This war will last for years. In fact, not only Israeli citizen, the civilians, 
 
 the 50,000 civilians will not return to the north, but you're going to talk about a million Israelis will be displaced, not to mention the destruction 
 
 of large parts of Lebanon.
 <br>[14:10:00] 
 
I think the cost not only for Lebanon, but also for Israel of an all-out war with Hezbollah is staggering. That's why I still hope -- I could be 
 
 wrong. I still hope that, you know, that the Americans basically prevail on Netanyahu and his war council against really expanding the military 
 
 campaign against Hezbollah --  
 
SOARES:  Yes -- 
 
GERGES:  But it seems to me -- it seems to me that the situation is spiraling out of control. We are really now at the brink, at the very brink 
 
 of all-out wider regional conflict, not just between Israel and Hezbollah - - 
 
SOARES:  Yes -- 
 
GERGES:  But between Israel on the one hand and Hezbollah and Iran and its allies on the other hand. 
 
SOARES:  And a vow -- as I know if you really mean -- but I don't think the Americans have had much luck in trying to change Netanyahu's thinking or 
 
 tactics in fact. But look, you're right, the tit-for-tat between Israel and Hezbollah have been escalating for some time. 
 
And of course, it follows the death of that Hezbollah commander. But Hezbollah has always said, Fawaz, that it didn't want to escalate. So, how 
 
 -- escalate into a regional war, I should say. But so, how does it retaliate without escalating this into something much bigger? 
 
GERGES:  Well, this is really the dilemma. I mean, you put your finger on the strategic dilemma facing Hezbollah. Hezbollah cannot afford not to 
 
 retaliate on a much bigger scale. The question is, how and what particular target that Hezbollah -- because this is -- you're talking about almost 
 
 3,000 casualties, including, you know, commanders, politicians, civilians. I mean, remember, many civilians were injured, Lebanese civilians. 
 
We're talking about all the casualties and not Hezbollah. You're talking about bystanders. You're talking about shoppers. So, this is the challenge, 
 
 and that's why it seems to me we are reaching truly a tipping point that is any kind of miscalculation. I think this is what Israel basically is doing, 
 
 is really trying to provoke Hezbollah, trying to provoke Iran. And I'm not exaggerating. In fact -- 
 
SOARES:  Fawaz, I'm sorry to interrupt you -- I'm sorry to interrupt you, but on this, the White House is holding a briefing. And I just want to hear 
 
 what they have to say.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The Secret Service can refocus on executive -- 
 
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  So, a couple of things you asked. So, just want to -- as it relates to the CR, as you know, that's 
 
 a short-term, CR. The Secret Service is working closely with Congress on their needs, and so, there can be many avenues to get there, to get to make 
 
 sure that we -- that we actually achieve that goal. 
 
So, we're not going to get ahead of those conversations as we're talking about more broadly, supplemental funding. Just want to take a step back and 
 
 walk through again what the President believes -- in your -- in your -- in your question to me. The President believes that Secret Service should have 
 
 every resource capability available to them, the protective measures available to them to do a mission that is indeed critical. 
 
And so, we want to make sure -- the President wants to make sure that they have the resource for that. And just to take a step back in August, as part 
 
 of our responsibility to plan for a possible short-term continued resolution, OMB provided Congress with a list of budget -- of budget needs 
 
 to avoid disruptions to government services through the first quarter of the fiscal year.
 
One of those -- one of those requests submitted was for the U.S., for the Secret Service -- it would ensure Secret Service had the ability to execute 
 
 its -- again, critical mission even during a continuing resolution, including its responsibilities related to the 2024 presidential campaign 
 
 without that particular requests in August, that anomaly, the Secret Service would have inefficient resources to sustain and enhance protective 
 
 operations during the period of the CR.
 
Separately from that, again, the Secret Service has been in touch with Congress. We believe there are many avenues to get that done, and so, we're 
 
 not going to get ahead of those conversations, but this is -- 
 
SOARES:  Right, we took you to the White House, Karine Jean-Pierre, because she was asked a question about the pager attacks in Lebanon, but she's 
 
 taking -- she decided to answer a different question. We will of course, continue to monitor as soon as there are any developments or we hear 
 
 anything from Karine Jean-Pierre, we will of course, bring that to you, and we'll have much more on the pager attacks a bit later in our show.   
 
Meantime, this hour, Sean "Diddy" Combs is expected to appear in court in New York City where he was arrested last night and taken into federal 
 
 custody. The music mogul is facing some truly stunning allegations. Prosecutors in New York today unveiled a 14-page indictment, including 
 
 charges of racketeering, conspiracy and sex trafficking. 
 <br>[14:15:00] 
 
They claim that for 16 years, Combs run a criminal enterprise through his business empire. According to the complaint, Combs allegedly uses staff and 
 
 business associates to help carry out as well as cover up his crimes. The U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York went into detail about 
 
 some of the allegations. Have a listen to this. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
DAMIEN WILLIAMS, U.S. ATTORNEY FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK:  The indictment alleges that Combs abused and exploited women and other people 
 
 for years and in a variety of ways. As alleged, Combs used force, threats of force and coercion to cause victims to engage in extended sexual 
 
 performances with male commercial sex workers, some of whom he transported or caused to be transported over state lines.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
SOARES:  And joining us -- more of all of this on the allegations on some of this is Josh Campbell. And Josh, I mean, this indictment alleges of some 
 
 truly horrific conditions for the victims who were under his control. Just talk us through the charges and the allegations here?
 
JOSH CAMPBELL, CNN SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  So, already, Isa, what a continued fall from grace for this -- 
 
SOARES:  Yes -- 
 
CAMPBELL:  International music star, now criminally charged with as you mentioned, these very serious allegations. What   prosecutors in New York 
 
 City say is that he essentially run a criminal enterprise that existed for his own personal sexual gratification, and in order to commit other crimes. 
 
And they're prosecuting this under what is called a racketeering statute here in the U.S. What does that mean? It means a conspiracy involving other 
 
 people, that he didn't just do this allegedly himself, but had surrounding of individuals, prosecutors alleged that included members of his security 
 
 team, members of his household staff who essentially worked in order to help traffic these women, drug them, sexually assault them in certain 
 
 cases. 
 
Now, I'll read you part of what this indictment actually entails. You can see here just a slew of allegations as prosecutors allege "members and 
 
 associates of the Combs enterprise engaged in and attempted to engage in, among other activities, sex trafficking, forced labor, interstate 
 
 transportation for purposes of prostitution, coercion and enticement to engage in prostitution, narcotics offences, kidnapping, arson, bribery and 
 
 obstruction of justice." 
 
Just a slew of federal allegations there against Combs and his criminal enterprise, they allege. Now, for his part, he is intended to plead not 
 
 guilty as attorneys say that they will continue to fight this in court. But Isa, certainly, serious allegations unsealed today.   
 
SOARES:  Yes, and the arrest in Manhattan, Josh, follows, of course, those two raids on his properties in Los Angeles. What more can you tell us? What 
 
 did they find as a part of this ongoing investigation into sex trafficking in particular here? 
 
CAMPBELL:  Yes, spot on. You know, you brought up those two dramatic raids that we saw earlier this year where federal agents essentially descended 
 
 upon two very large homes owned by Combs, both here in Los Angeles as well as in the Miami area. And we saw these officers in tactical gear. 
 
You can see them there pulling people out of the house. They then went to execute a search warrant that a judge had signed. We were told that they 
 
 uncovered numerous items, electronic medium, the prosecutors today said that as part of their investigation, they've actually uncovered video that 
 
 was taken of these women being assaulted, which will all be part of this ongoing prosecution. 
 
And of course, you know, this all stems from many of those civil allegations that several women had filed in court against Combs, accusing 
 
 him of sexual assault. Of course, there was the one dramatic video that CNN broke that occurred. This was an incident in a hotel room here in Los 
 
 Angeles several years ago, where you can see Combs on videotape brutally assaulting his former girlfriend, there she is there, standing in a lobby. 
 
What prosecutors said today is that she was trying to flee that hotel room to escape. And you see him running down the hall, even goes, grabs her, 
 
 throws her to the ground, starts brutally attacking her, reason I bring this up is because until that video came out, Combs and his team were 
 
 essentially attacking the women, saying that these accusers were out to get money.
 
That story changed after this came out, Combs issued somewhat of an apology, and so now, here we are now. This investigation now moving to a 
 
 very dramatic new level. He is now in federal custody.
 
SOARES:  Josh Campbell, I know you'll stay across this for us as soon as any more developments, do come back to us. Thanks, Josh.   
 
CAMPBELL:  You bet. 
 
SOARES:  Now, at least 17 people have been killed in what authorities are calling the worst floods to hit central as well as eastern Europe in 
 
 decades. This video is from Nysa in Poland, where the mayor has ordered the evacuation of all 44,000 residents. The rainfall is tapering off, but 
 
 officials warn water levels in the rivers remain dangerously high.  
 
Meanwhile, wildfires are tearing through Portugal, more than 5,000 firefighters are battling the flames, three of them were reported dead 
 
 today, and authorities have closed highways as well as roads throughout the country. Our Melissa Bell is keeping an eye on those developments and joins 
 
 us now from Paris. 
 
Melissa, I mean, pretty wild and extreme weather right across Europe and has been going for days. Just bring us up-to-date with the very latest. 
 <br>[14:20:00]
 
MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  That's right, and it came rather unexpectedly. These were all the effects, both the wildfires you mentioned, 
 
 Isa, down in Portugal and the low pressure system, this Storm Boris, that has caused such devastation across central and eastern Europe. These were 
 
 extreme weather conditions that had been foreseen as a result of climate change in Europe becoming the fastest -- the fastest warming continent on 
 
 the planet. 
 
But it was -- it arrived with such fury, the water that we saw over the course of the weekend with some parts of central Europe seeing more than a 
 
 month's rainfall in a matter of a couple of days. And I think that's what's really left authorities unprepared. And what you've seen across those vast 
 
 swaths of Europe, Isa, from Poland, the Czech Republic, but also Hungary and Austria are dams bursting, bridges collapsing under the weight of the 
 
 water and fears that although Storm Boris heads further southwards, warnings now, as far as Italy. 
 
That the water levels are such and the ground so sodden that any further rainfall is likely to cause a great deal more damage. And what you're 
 
 talking about, of course, as you say, the 17 people who have tragically lost their lives, communities who have   had to deal with evacuations, 
 
 parts of Europe where people aren't able to get drinking water, terrible emergency relief conditions that people are facing. 
 
It is the lack of preparedness of authorities that I think have left many extremely concerned about what these extreme climate changes mean for the 
 
 immediate future of a continent like Europe. And again, here, you're talking about the European Union really struggling to deal with such 
 
 catastrophically fast rainfall.   
 
So, in those areas hardest hit -- and I'm thinking here of the Czech Republic's border with Poland, the water levels you see, beginning to 
 
 recede. But it is far from certain that Storm Boris has finished with the devastation as it heads further south, Isa.
 
SOARES:  And those pictures are truly astounding. Melissa, appreciate it, thank you very much. And still to come tonight, more updates on our 
 
 breaking story from the Middle East, that extraordinary situation, of course, unfolding in Lebanon after hundreds of Hezbollah pagers suddenly 
 
 exploded. We'll bring you the very latest for you after this short break. You are watching CNN. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  
 
SOARES:  Well, back now to our top story. A massive series of pager explosions that targeted Hezbollah members right across Lebanon. 
 <br>[14:25:00] 
 
The U.S. State Department says it doesn't have an assessment yet on who's behind the coordinated attack. But the Lebanese government and Hezbollah 
 
 are putting full responsibility on Israel. Authorities say at least nine people were killed, including an 8-year-old girl, nearly 3,000 others were 
 
 injured. 
 
Our Paula Hancocks has been monitoring the story right from when it broke, and she follows -- she joins us now from Abu Dhabi. And Paula, in the last 
 
 few minutes, we just heard from Matthew Miller, the State Department saying the U.S. was not involved in the series of pager explosions. 
 
They're calling it an incident, not the attack, and they would not say whether they assess that Israel is responsible or not for that attack. 
 
 Having said that, we have heard from Hezbollah, who are putting the finger directly at Israel. 
 
PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, that's right, Isa. We heard that State Department  briefing and he was asked a dozen times in 
 
 different ways, do you believe that Israel was behind it? Pointing at Hezbollah and also the Lebanese government have been very clear that they 
 
 blame Israel for what has happened.   
 
But the U.S. will not be drawn on it at this point, saying that they are still gathering information. Now, we're also not going to get a comment, it 
 
 appears from Israel itself. The Israeli military saying that they won't be commenting on it, not necessarily a surprise. But we also know that the 
 
 Israeli military has announced that it had a situational assessment on all arenas on Tuesday.
 
So, this was really to make sure of its readiness in both offensive and defensive areas. It was headed up by the chief of staff of the IDF. So, 
 
 that's really all we'll be hearing from the Israeli side. But Hezbollah has been very clear, in the fact that it believes Israel is responsible, they 
 
 have said that there will be retribution. 
 
Although, of course, it's difficult in these chaotic hours after this attack took place to understand what sort of retaliation that would be, how 
 
 logistically, technically it would be possible when potentially you have hundreds, if not thousands of Hezbollah operatives injured. And one key 
 
 method of communicating between the militants, having been taken out. 
 
And of course, there will be great reticence to be picking up phones or to be communicating in the regular ways after such an attack. Now, it has been 
 
 called by the Lebanese Minister of Health, a mass casualty event, 2,800 people being injured, well over 100 of those critically wounded, as you 
 
 say, Isa, as well, nine have been killed. 
 
And what we have heard is that hospitals in southern Lebanon that are trying to cope with the influx of injuries have been overwhelmed, that they 
 
 are working at over capacity. We know that the Ministry of Health has told health officials to come back to work as soon as this happened, to make 
 
 sure that they had the personnel available to deal with the sheer number of casualties. 
 
Now, what we understand is that much of the injuries are to the hands, the face, and also to the abdomen, clearly showing where you would usually 
 
 carry a pager, potentially hooked on to onto the top of trousers, so that is the area that would have been injured. So, at this point, there is a 
 
 sense and was in the hours afterwards of chaos in Lebanon.
 
The southern suburbs of Beirut, Hezbollah's stronghold areas of the Beqaa Valley, again, the Hezbollah stronghold and areas in southern Lebanon. Isa? 
 
SOARES:  Yes, and as you were talking, Paula, I believe -- my producer was telling me those are live images and some medicals -- and this is Beirut's 
 
 -- American University of Beirut Medical Center. And you're talking to -- just the panic, the sheer panic -- we've seen some of those videos, so  
 
 many people are out on the streets, and of course, it's 9:28 in the evening, thousands have been injured. 
 
And I wonder, Paula, if you could speak to the psychological impact, perhaps of this attack. Hezbollah of course, famously prides itself in 
 
 operational security, right? So, what do you think this does to that?   
 
HANCOCKS:  Well, the very basic thing it does to it, Isa, is, it makes it impossible for them to communicate in the very near term, the immediate 
 
 term, because if you are a Hezbollah operative, you don't know who's been injured, you don't know how your internal system has been compromised, and 
 
 there will be a lot of paranoia at this point. 
 
In their belief, Israel has managed to significantly infiltrate what they believe to be a fairly low tech, but also a secured way of communicating 
 
 with each other. And one key point as well is, we don't at this point know the numbers of militants that have been injured or killed. We do know one 
 
 8-year-old girl has been killed as well. 
 
The Ministry of Health saying anybody with a pager should discard it. So, this isn't necessarily just Hezbollah who has been affected, this is 
 
 terrorizing for the country.
 
ISA SOARES, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST:  Paula Hancock's there for us. Appreciate it. Thank you very much.
 
Well, Vice President Kamala Harris is about to speak before members of the National Association of Black Journalists. I want you to listen in. Have a 
 
 listen to this.
 
KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE:  -- unemployment since the Great Depression. We came in during 
 
 the worst public health epidemic in centuries. We came in after the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War. And a lot of it due in large 
 
 part to the mismanagement by the former president, as it relates to COVID and obviously January 6th. And we had, then, a lot of work to do to clean 
 
 up a mess.
 
As of today, we have created over 16 million new jobs, over 800,000 new manufacturing jobs. We have the lowest black unemployment rate in 
 
 generations. We have invested in small businesses, and I'm going to -- there to the benefit of many people, but including black small businesses, 
 
 some of the highest rate of creation of new black small businesses in years.
 
We have done the work of capping the cost of prescription medication for our seniors for issues like insulin and again, I'm speaking to the black 
 
 journalists who care about all people, but in particular, I'll talk about the impact on black people, where we know black folks are 60 times more 
 
 likely -- 60 percent, excuse me, more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes. And we have now finally capped the cost of insulin for our seniors at $35 a 
 
 month, capped the cost of prescription medication for our seniors at $2,000 a year because we, unlike the former president who promised to do it, we, 
 
 finally, have allowed Medicare to negotiate drug prices against the big pharmaceutical companies. And these are just some of the accomplishments.
 
Is the price of grocery still too high? Yes. Do we have more work to do? Yes. And I will tell you, I do believe that I offer a new generation of 
 
 leadership for our country that is about, in particular, turning the page on an era that sadly has shown us attempts by some to incite fear, to 
 
 create division in our country, and to do the work that is about bringing some level of optimism, and dare I say ambition, about what I know is 
 
 possible in our country.
 
And so, my plan for the economy includes what I imagine and believe and call an opportunity economy. What we can do to grow an opportunity economy 
 
 where all people have access to the resources to compete, to apply their incredible work ethic, their ambition, their aspirations and their dreams 
 
 and actually, not just get by, but get ahead.
 
And I can talk in more detail about it, but specifically, I'll mention a few things. One of the big issues that affects people right now, in terms 
 
 of the economy and their economic wellbeing, is we have a shortage of housing supply. It's too expensive. People can't afford to buy a home. You 
 
 know, we grew up, our parents, where they had the ability to somehow believe the American dream was attainable. Not so much for younger working 
 
 people. And I recognize that.
 
So, my approach is a new approach, which is to say, let's just take this and deal with it head on. And part of my approach is to say, I'm going to 
 
 employ and engage the private sector, in particular home builders with tax credits, to give them the incentive to create new housing, 3 million by the 
 
 end of my first term. And understanding that not everybody is, you know, handed a silver spoon but works hard and is trying to save up for a down 
 
 payment.
 
Part of my plan, under my opportunity economy, is to give first time home buyers a $25,000 down payment assistance so they can just get their foot in 
 
 the door to be able to then engage in what will prove to be their opportunity to build intergenerational wealth.
 
And here's my personal experience coming at that. I grew up a middle-class kid. My mother was hard working. She raised me and my sister, Maya. She 
 
 saved up. And it was only by the time I was a teenager that she could afford to actually buy her first home. And I know, and I identify with, I 
 
 know where I come from.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Madam Vice President -- 
 
HARRIS:  And I know -- but I'm just going to finish. I know that so many people work so hard and should have the opportunity to just get their foot 
 
 in the door. Again, so, it's not just about getting by but getting ahead. Please.
 <br>[14:35:00]
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I'd like to ask you more about the opportunity economy. Housing is a part of it, as well as expanding the earned income 
 
 tax credit, financial support, as you mentioned, for first time buyers, and a $50,000 tax deduction for startups and small businesses.
 
HARRIS:  Yes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  But I want to talk to you about the squeeze that millions of Americans are also dealing with, that impacts their ability to 
 
 work and make money, and that is child care and elder care. And it's a squeeze for millions of people.
 
In some parts of the country, it costs more for child care than for rents. I think Bloomberg recently reported an average of $33,000 a year. So, I'm 
 
 just wondering, you mentioned that in your opportunity economy, a child tax credit, but that's just one part of an ecosystem.
 
HARRIS:  Right.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Please tell us what plans will you propose to guarantee that families can actually afford childcare and elder care?
 
HARRIS:  So, to your point, it is, sadly the state of affairs in our country that working people often have to decide to either be able to work 
 
 or be able to afford child care, like they can't afford child care and actually, do the work that they want to do because it's too expensive and 
 
 it doesn't actually level out in terms of the expense versus the income.
 
My plan is that no family, no working family should pay more than 7 percent of their income in child care. Because I know that when you talk about the 
 
 return on that investment, allowing people to work allowing people to pursue their dreams in terms of how they want to work, where they want to 
 
 work, benefits us all, it strengthens the entire economy.
 
We saw, for example, during the pandemic what happened, and it sadly has dissipated as a conversation that we need to resuscitate, which is the 
 
 number of women that had to leave the workforce because of a lack of child care and home health care. And so, many of our families, in particular 
 
 women, end up carrying the responsibility. Men do too, of course. What we call people who are in the sandwich generation.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Exactly.
 
HARRIS:  Who have young children and are also taking care of their parents. And it is just absolutely too expensive for them to be able to work and do 
 
 that. So, my plan is not only about 7 percent of income for working people for childcare, but also, we need to do better for our childcare providers 
 
 and our home health care providers in terms of ensuring that they receive the wages that they deserve based on the dignity of their work.
 
I have spent time with home health care providers and their work is some of the most taxing work you can imagine. And I actually, when my mother was 
 
 sick with cancer, did a lot in terms of taking care of her. And the work that is about taking care of a loved one, in particular an elder, is 
 
 extraordinarily heavy in terms of the emotional toll, the time it takes and we do it because that is what we do, but not everyone has the ability to 
 
 take time from work to do it. And they need help, and we need to make sure we have home health care workers that can help them.
 
But I want to also get back to the earlier point that you made about extending the child tax credit. So, part of my new approach is we need to 
 
 expand the child tax credit. And so, part of my plan that is under an opportunity economy is to extend and expand the child tax credit to $6,000, 
 
 so that young families, in particular, for the first year of their child's life, which is an extraordinarily important time in their development, have 
 
 the resources to be able to buy a crib, buy a car seat, buy children's clothing, and not have to worry about whether they're going to be able to 
 
 meet their other needs.
 
And I will -- I don't need to remind anybody here, especially these esteemed journalists, but when we expanded the child tax credit a couple 
 
 years ago, we reduced black child poverty by half. And so, again, if you talk about the benefit, and if you think about the benefit to the economy 
 
 overall, it strengthens our economy to do things like pay attention to affordable child care, affordable home health care, and extending the child 
 
 tax credit.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Madam Vice President, black men, as you know, are a closely watched voting bloc. You've hosted black men at your residence. You 
 
 have engaged black men and censored them in your economic opportunity tour. But polling shows that some black men, particularly young black men, are 
 
 considering voting for Donald Trump. And they see him as better for the economy.
 <br>[14:40:00]
 
What is your message to young black male voters who feel left out of this economy, and how can your economic policies materially change their lives?
 
HARRIS:  So, I appreciate the spirit of the question, but I'll tell you I've often been asked this question in a way that I've had to respond by 
 
 first saying that I think it's very important to not operate from the assumption that black men are in anybody's pocket.
 
Black men are like any other voting group, you got to earn their vote. So, I'm working to earn the vote. Not assuming I'm going to have it because I 
 
 am black, but because the policies and the perspectives I have understands what we must do to recognize the needs of all communities, and I intend to 
 
 be a president for all people, specifically as it relates to what we need to do, to your point, around economic opportunity.
 
Yes, I started way before I was at the top of the ticket in what I called an economic opportunity tour focused on black men. Understanding that, for 
 
 example, we have so many entrepreneurs in the community who do not have access to capital, but they've got great ideas, an incredible work ethic, 
 
 the ambition, the aspiration, the dream, but don't have the relationships necessarily.
 
So, my work has included, as vice president, getting billions more dollars into community banks, including working with the big banks to do that, so 
 
 that we can increase access to capital for our small businesses, for our startups.
 
Part of my plan, under my economic opportunity plan going forward, is that right now, startup entrepreneurs, small businesses, only get a tax 
 
 deduction of $5,000. Nobody can start a small business with $5,000. So, I'm expanding that to $50,000. Understanding, again, that when people have the 
 
 opportunity to have the resources to get started, they're going to put the good ideas, they're going to put the hard work into it.
 
And part of what I also know is that our young black men, our black men, just like any group of people, anybody, our small businesses are really the 
 
 backbone of our economy overall. And when they do better economically, we all do better.
 
Part of my work is about understanding what we need to do in dealing with, for example, the historic inequities that have faced the black community 
 
 around home ownership, right. I don't have to go through the history with anybody here about what that has meant in terms of redlining, what that has 
 
 meant in terms of biases and home appraisals, and what that -- the impact it has had on stemming the opportunity to build intergenerational wealth 
 
 because of those obstacles.
 
So, part of the work that I have done and will continue to do is identify speak truth about those obstacles and address them. Another example is 
 
 medical debt. One in four black families or individuals is more likely to carry medical debt than others So, part of my perspective and as vice 
 
 president, part of the work that we have done is to say that we're going to eliminate medical debt from being on your credit score.
 
Because until now, medical debt worked against your credit score, and, you know, people know their credit score, like, you know, your weight, right? 
 
 You know that number. And the difference between what that number is and what it needs to be is the difference between you being able to get a car 
 
 loan, a small business loan, or even a lease on an apartment.
 
And so, part of my approach is understanding the obstacles that traditionally and currently exist to allow anyone, including black men, be 
 
 able to achieve economic wealth. And I'm going to tell you, I don't think it is sufficient to just only talk about economic policy around reducing 
 
 unemployment. It is an important marker. And I'm proud of the work that we've done thus far, but it should be a baseline that everybody's working.
 
The point is, do people have an opportunity to build wealth if that's what they choose to do? If that's what they want to do? And a lot of my 
 
 perspective as we go forward is just that. I believe that there are a lot of opportunities that are available to the American people if we just see, 
 
 if we see people and understand what they want for themselves and their families, and then meet them where they are.
 <br>[14:45:00]
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Madam Vice President, I want to switch gears a little bit and talk about the war in Gaza. You've called for a ceasefire hostage 
 
 deal and a two-state solution as an end to the war for many months now. And while you've expressed support for Israel to defend itself, a two-state 
 
 solution and a ceasefire are at odds with what Benjamin Netanyahu has said is their right to defense.
 
If it matters, as you say, how Israel defends itself, where do you see the line between aggression and defense? And our power as Israel's ally to do 
 
 something.
 
HARRIS:  OK. A lot to unpack in what you just said. So, let's start with this. I absolutely believe that this war has to end and it has to end as 
 
 soon as possible. And the way that will be achieved is by getting a hostage deal and a ceasefire deal done. And we are working around the clock to 
 
 achieve that end.
 
Stepping back, October 7, 1,200 Israelis were slaughtered, and actually some Americans, by the way, in that number, slaughtered. Young people who 
 
 were attending a concert, women were horribly raped. And yes, so I have said, Israel has a right to defend itself. We would. And -- 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  But Madam Vice President, I think my ask is the difference between aggression and defensiveness.
 
HARRIS:  No, no, let me finish. No, but it's important to put it in context, which is what I'm doing, and I'll get to that. And so, how it does 
 
 so matters. And far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed, women and children. We have seen with horror the images coming out of Gaza. And 
 
 we have to take that seriously.
 
And we have to agree that not only must we end this war, but we have to have a goal of a two-state solution because there must be stability and 
 
 peace in that reason, in as much as what we do in our goal, is to ensure that Israelis have security and Palestinians, in equal measure, have 
 
 security, have self-determination, and dignity.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  A question for you on that, though. What levers does the U.S. have to support Palestinians in their right to self-determination? 
 
 And is it even possible as Israel's ally?
 
HARRIS:  Well, absolutely. I'm -- I will tell you, I have been actively involved in, for example, meeting not only with Israeli officials, but with 
 
 Arab officials to talk about how we can construct a day after scenario where we participate in ensuring those exact goals that I outlined, 
 
 including as part of the principles that should be applied to those goals that there be no reoccupation of Gaza, that there be no changing of the 
 
 territorial lines in Gaza. that there be an ability to have security in the region for all concerned in a way that we create stability, and let's let 
 
 us also recognize in a way that ensures that Iran is not empowered in this whole scenario, in terms of the peace and stability of the region.
 
But absolutely, the United States of America, absolutely, has a role, which is why we have been active, in particular with the Qataris and the 
 
 Egyptians, around attempting to get a deal done and get it done as quickly as possible.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Madam Vice President, just to follow up really quickly, is there a specific policy change that you, as president of the United 
 
 States, would say you would do that would help this along? Because, you know, you've gotten a lot of credit for emphasizing the humanity of 
 
 Palestinians. But what I often hear from folks is that there's no policy change that would -- that either you or the president, President Biden, 
 
 have gone and said they would do. Is there a specific policy change as president that you would do in our helping of Israel in this war?
 
HARRIS:  We need to get this deal done and we need to get it done immediately, and that is my position and that is my policy. We need to get 
 
 this deal done.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  But in the way that we send weapons, and the way that we interact as their ally, are there specific policy changes?
 
HARRIS:  Well, Eugene, for example, one of the things that we have done that I am entirely supportive of is the pause that we've put on the 2,000-
 
 pound bombs. And so, there is some leverage that we have had and used. But ultimately, the thing that is going to unlock everything else in that 
 
 region is getting this deal done.
 <br>[14:50:00]
 
And I can -- I'm not going to disclose private conversations, but I will tell you, I've had direct conversations with the prime minister, with the 
 
 president of Israel, with Egyptian leaders, and with our allies. And I think we've made ourselves very clear that this deal needs to get done in 
 
 the best interest of everyone in the region, including getting those hostages out who -- I mean, we saw the latest example of what happened with 
 
 the six most recently, one of whom was an American citizen.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  But what do you say to those that say that's not enough, that stopping the 2,000-pound bombs, the onetime wasn't enough, 
 
 that this administration and your possible administration has to do more?
 
HARRIS:  Well, we are doing the work of putting the pressure on all parties involved to get the deal done. But let me be very clear also, I support 
 
 Israel's ability to defend itself, and I support the need for Palestinians to have dignity, self-determination, and security as we move forward and 
 
 get a two-state deal done, but right now, the thing we need to get done is this hostage deal and the ceasefire deal. We need a ceasefire. We need the 
 
 hostage deal.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I want to switch gears to racial justice, Madam Vice President. Last month, you eulogized Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee. 
 
 Jackson Lee's signature bill, one of a few, was H.R.40, which would create a commission to study the history of U.S. slavery and study the issue of 
 
 reparations. She introduced H.R.40 every session of Congress, taking up the mantle from Congressman John Conyers. This is a bill that you have co-
 
 sponsored as a U.S. senator.
 
Yet, this has -- despite the fact that this has been -- similar commissions have been created on the state level and on the local level, is yet to pass 
 
 in Congress, let alone come out of committee. Congresswoman Jackson Lee, Congresswoman Barbara Lee, and other advocates have called for President 
 
 Biden to take executive action to take -- to create this commission. Would you as president take executive action to create this commission, or do you 
 
 believe that it should happen in Congress?
 
HARRIS:  Well, first of all, I just -- as you mentioned, Sheila Jackson Lee, she was an extraordinary leader who we just recently lost, and she was 
 
 a friend and a real champion for so many issues. So, I feel compelled to say that about her.
 
On the issue of what we need to do going forward, look, first of all, we just need to speak truth about history in spite of the fact that some 
 
 people are trying to erase history and try and teach our children otherwise. We need to speak truth about the generational impact of our 
 
 history in terms of the generational impact of slavery, the generational impact of redlining, of Jim Crow law. I could go on and on and on.
 
These are facts that have had impact, and we need to speak truth about it. And we need to speak truth about it in a way that is about driving 
 
 solutions. And frankly, I think that we -- you know, and part of that is studying it to figure out exactly what we need to do.
 
But part of what we can do right now is, for example, what I'm talking about in terms of building an opportunity economy, which is addressing 
 
 explicitly the obstacles that historically and currently exist and dealing with them, student loan debt, medical debt, bias, and home appraisals What 
 
 we need to do in terms of dealing with an issue that I have championed for years, black maternal mortality, which is the fact that black women are 
 
 three to four times more likely to die in connection with childbirth than other women. And we know that the reasons for that include disparities that 
 
 preexist her pregnancy, including disparities that exist in the system during her pregnancy. So, all of those things must be addressed.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Do you have a position on whether that should happen, this commission should happen through executive order or via Congress?
 
HARRIS:  I think Congress, ultimately, will have the ability to do this work. I'm not discounting the importance of any executive action, but, 
 
 ultimately, Congress. Because if you're going to talk about it in any substantial way, there will be hearings, there will be a level of public 
 
 education and dialogue that -- and I think that was part of the spirit behind the congressional action thus far, to ensure that everyone can 
 
 participate in this conversation in a way that elevates knowledge about history and the reference points that have -- that are the impetus of this 
 
 conversation.
 <br>[14:55:00]
 
Especially, again, when people are trying to deny history. When people -- our, you know, so-called leaders are saying that enslaved people benefited 
 
 from slavery. I mean, let's talk about the delta here in terms of the work that needs to be done. It's profound.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Madam Vice President, I want to move to Springfield, Ohio and what's happening there. We've seen school closures, parents 
 
 worried about their kids leaving the home because of racist conspiracy theories that I won't repeat here, but they have been repeated by leaders 
 
 on the Republican side. President Trump -- vice president -- excuse me, Former President Trump and Vice Presidential Nominee J. D. Vance.
 
From your perspective, is this just a case of irredeemable racism that can't be mitigated by any rational action, or is this a situation in which 
 
 a federal response could help this community heal? There's a question of resources and -- 
 
HARRIS:  Well, I'll let you finish and then I'll speak. It's a crying shame. I mean, my heart breaks for this community. You know, there were 
 
 children, elementary school children who -- it was school photo day. You remember what that's like, going to school on picture day, who dressed up 
 
 in their best, got all ready, knew what they were going to wear the night before and had to be evacuated.
 
Children, children. A whole community put in fear. And I'll say a couple things about it. One, you know, I learned a long time ago in my career, 
 
 having a background as a prosecutor, when you have these positions, when you have that kind of microphone in front of you, you really ought to 
 
 understand at a very deep level how much your words have meaning.
 
I learned at a very young stage in my career the meaning of my words could impact whether somebody was free or in prison. As attorney general, I was -
 
 - of California, fifth largest economy in the world, I was acutely aware that my words could move markets.
 
When you are bestowed with a microphone that is that big, there is a profound responsibility that comes with that, that is an extension of what 
 
 should not be lost in this moment, this concept of the public trust. To then understand what the public trust means. It means that you have been 
 
 invested with trust to be responsible in the way you use your words, much less how you conduct yourself.
 
And especially when you have been, and then seek to be, again, president of the United States of America. And so, I go back to it's a crying shame, 
 
 literally. What's happening to those families, those children in that community, not to mention, what is happening in terms of, look, you say you 
 
 care about law enforcement. Law enforcement resources being put into this because of these serious threats that are being issued against a community 
 
 that is living a productive good life before this happened.
 
And spewing lies that are grounded in tropes that are age old. And look, I said it not very far from here the other day at the debate, this is not 
 
 new. This is not new in terms of these tropes. This is not new in terms of where it's coming from. And you know, whether it is refusing to rent to 
 
 people, rent to black families, whether it is taking out a full-page ad in The New York Times against five innocent black and Latino teenagers, the 
 
 Central Park Five calling for their execution, whether it is referring to the first black president of the United States with a lie, birther lies --
