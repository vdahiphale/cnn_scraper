BECKY ANDERSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Well, hello, and welcome to CONNECT THE WORLD with me, Becky Anderson. Time here in the UAE is 6:00 
 
 p.m. And tonight we begin with a celebration 70 years in the making. The soul of a nation, reveling in the first coronation of a British monarch in 
 
 seven decades. 
 
King Charles III will be crowned on Saturday in Westminster Abbey, where his royal ancestors have also held the orb and held the auburn scepter. 
 
 Then he and his wife Queen Camilla will head back to Buckingham Palace to appear on that iconic balcony. Of course, anointing a sovereign is a 
 
 serious undertaking dating back to 1066. 
 
We're camped out along the procession route in central London. Royal supporters telling us the mood is electric. So the flags are out, the 
 
 bunting is up, and people are ready to party. The prince and princess of Wales have been down the path to toast Prince William's father. 
 
Our very end own Anna Stewart is in the center of all of it. Not at the pub. She joins us live from outside Westminster Abbey. 
 
ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Not yet. 
 
ANDERSON: Not yet, exactly. Set this up for us if you will. This is going to be a weekend as we always described it when we're talking about the 
 
 royal family in Britain as a weekend of pomp and ceremony. 
 
STEWART: Wow, pomp and ceremony, more than we've ever had, really. So we have every 10 years a jubilee. I know you've seen many royal weddings and 
 
 you've seen how big the pomp and ceremony can be. There is nothing as big, as grand as a coronation. And of course, we haven't had one for 70 years. 
 
 So, few people can really remember what it all looks like. But tomorrow we will see the biggest military procession. 
 
We will see everyone gathering at Westminster Abbey, heads of state, members of the royal family here in the U.K. but also from abroad, for what 
 
 is a very solemn and sacred ritual to anoint a new king. Now, quite aside from that we also, as you said have all the excitement of the royal fans 
 
 who are already sort of lining them out. Already getting their camps up. Making sure that they have the best spot for the procession tomorrow. 
 
And actually some of them, Becky, were incredibly lucky. I think we've got some pictures to show you. Because that king and the prince and princess of 
 
 Wales made a surprise visit. A little walk about a short time ago. Up and down the Mall, speaking to some of those well-wishers. Many hands are 
 
 shaken, lots of selfies were taken. You can see plenty of flags. People have flown in from all of the world to be here for what will be a moment in 
 
 history that I suspect they will never forget. 
 
It's a busy day for that king. He's also hosted a lunch at Buckingham Palace, the commonwealth, prime ministers and visiting dignitaries. And 
 
 there's also a glittering dinner reception I'm told tonight at Buckingham Palace. All that, and then I suspect an early night ahead of tomorrow 
 
 because it will be an incredibly busy day for King Charles. Many changes of outfits, and that includes robes and crowns. Changes of carriages and a 
 
 long procession to make to Westminster Abbey and back again. 
 
ANDERSON: Anna Stewart, out and about for you as are many of my colleagues in London today, setting the scene for what will be a fantastic weekend. 
 
 Thank you very much indeed. More on that as we move through the next couple of hours. 
 
Well, Serbia's president is vowing to toughen his country's gun laws after a second mass shooting there in as many days. Police arrested a 21-year-old 
 
 suspect. They say he killed eight people and wounded 13 others in a shooting spree south of Belgrade. This happened just a day after police say 
 
 a 13-year-old boy killed eight students and a security guard in a school in the Serbian capital. 
 
Scott McLean connecting us from Belgrade today. 
 
And, Scott, you and I spoke at this point and we were discussing the response to that original school shooting attack and what authorities were 
 
 doing in Belgrade. What's been at the police response to this second shooting? 
 <br>[10:05:03]
 
SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It has been absolutely massive. Of course, in the school shooting that we saw on Wednesday, the police response was 
 
 fairly straightforward. To go in and arrest this boy who had already called police on himself. In this case it was a massive manhunt across a huge 
 
 swath of this country involving some 600 heavily, heavily armed police in full tactical gear. Many wearing balaclavas, driving vehicles that you 
 
 might not immediately recognized as police vehicles. It looked a lot more like they ought to belong to the military. 
 
And they were fanned out across the country. We saw them surging in the line across or alongside a highway. We saw them manning checkpoints and we 
 
 saw them in the towns and the hamlets around where the shots were actually fired. They managed to apprehend this suspect more than an hour away from 
 
 where those shots were initially fired. And things were so tense initially, though, when this manhunt was going on that we actually met one man inside 
 
 one of these villages who, in the early hours, actually was arrested himself by police because they mistakenly believed he may have himself been 
 
 the gunman. This is what he told us. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Now I am feeling OK because it is over, so we are on the one hand, I'm happy because it's over. On the other hand, I am scared about 
 
 the situation. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MCLEAN: Yes, that man refused to come out of his house with his family until he had confirmation. He's actually shouting at me at the road for 
 
 confirmation that there had been an arrest made. I should also mention quickly, Becky, that police did release new images of the actual arrest 
 
 itself. It appears from the limited pictures that we have that that went off without incident. What would be surprising, though, is that police 
 
 found, not only an automatic weapon but also four hand grenades in the house where they found the suspect -- Becky. 
 
ANDERSON: You've been reporting that Serbia is set to tighten gun laws after these two mass shootings in a week. That is perhaps not a surprise. 
 
 Just describe what the Serbian government is planning? 
 
MCLEAN: Yes, so there are already gun control laws on the books in this country. You have to go through quite a few hoops to actually get a weapon, 
 
 fully automatic weapons like the one used in this shooting you cannot access as a civilian. Semiautomatic weapons you can get if you've done the 
 
 background check and the training and you have a good reason to have one. 
 
Yesterday the government proposed legislation that would put a two-year moratorium on the issuing of new gun licenses until they can't figure out 
 
 how best to prevent something like this in the future. Today, though, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic was much more direct, much more forward, 
 
 much more ambitious with his plans in light of this latest shooting, vowing to go even further to de-arm the Syrian or the Serbian, excuse me, 
 
 population. 
 
We know that there are hundreds of thousands of guns floating around this country legal and illegal, and he wants to get them largely that number 
 
 down as low as he possibly can. And so, he is proposing tight gun restrictions and mandatory buyback programs for people who cannot abide by 
 
 the new restrictions. He also, Becky, wants to put an armed police officer inside of every single school. 
 
In his words, he said that, look, great nations managed to find solutions after tragedies, and he believes that Serbia can do the same after now 
 
 these two tragedies in just two days. 
 
ANDERSON: Yes, it's shocking, isn't it? Scott, thank you. Scott McLean in Belgrade or just outside Belgrade in Serbia. 
 
Well, to what Ukraine is calling a possible turning point now in its battle against Russia. In what is a key city of Bakhmut, the head of the Wagner 
 
 mercenary group, important Putin ally of course, railing against Russia's military leadership in what is a new video. Yevgeny Prigozhin points to the 
 
 bodies of fighters he says are getting slaughtered because of a lack of ammunition. And then he released this stunning announcement. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
YEVGENY PRIGOZHIN, WAGNER GROUP CHIEF (through translator): I am officially informing the Defense minister, chief of the general staff, and the supreme 
 
 commander in chief, that my guys will not be taking useless unjustified losses in Bakhmut without ammunition. So, on May 10th, 2023, we are pulling 
 
 out of Bakhmut. We have only two or so kilometers left to capture out of 45. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: I want to bring in CNN's diplomatic editor Nic Robinson here. He is in eastern Ukraine. 
 
Just how significant is what we are hearing here? 
 <br>[10:10:04]
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: It's very significant because it's very personal. Yevgeny Prigozhin is calling out Sergei Shoigu, 
 
 the Defense minister, President Putin's Defense minister, and his military chief of staff, Gerasimov. So he is making this very, very personal, going 
 
 after these two men and saying they're the ones that are responsible for not supplying enough ammunition to his troops on the frontline. 
 
And it comes after months and months and months of fighting for Bakhmut where Wagner troops have been at the vanguard of the fight, at the front 
 
 lines, losing a lot of lives. That's something that we've been hearing from Ukrainian officials. But Ukrainian officials have actually told us today 
 
 that, look, Prigozhin has been short. The Wagner fighters have been short of artillery ammunition. That's something that we have seen. 
 
But they are also saying if they don't, if the Russians don't sort out their ammunition shortage then this could be, as they described, a turning 
 
 point. They wouldn't expect it to come immediately or too quickly, but it could be the moment where the battle again shifts back into Ukraine's 
 
 favor. Ukraine has been losing ground there, meter by meter, every day. But the city, the town itself of Bakhmut is now very much destroyed. 
 
But Prigozhin has put this battle within the Kremlin on the front line for President Putin now. He's made it a real challenge. And not only has he 
 
 gone after the defense minister and the chief of staff, he's also just hired the deputy defense minister who was fired from his job, the Russian 
 
 deputy defense minister fired from his job just last week. So the rift is there. It's big and significant. And potentially turns into a battlefield 
 
 lost just when Putin needs it. 
 
ANDERSON: Nic Robertson is on the ground. Nic, context is really important. Thank you. 
 
Bakhmut, the flash point for this war currently at least and has been now for some months. But critical battles are also being waged from the forest 
 
 to the fields of eastern Ukraine. 
 
CNN's Nick Paton Walsh reports from the countryside where Ukrainian fighters are putting pressure on the Russians. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY EDITOR (voice-over): Out here, Moscow is losing but never kindly. The shell flies into the old 
 
 position this artillery unit used to sit in just ahead of us. This unit of Ukraine's marines keep moving, keep the Russians guessing. Every time they 
 
 fire, there is a risk they will be spotted and hit back. 
 
(On-camera): All about increasing pressure on Russian lines as the counteroffensive looms and that crackle in the distance of small arms fire, 
 
 the Ukrainians trying to take down drones being used to spot them. 
 
(Voice-over): Something rare is happening here over the hills far into which these shells land. It's indicated by the unusual sight of Russian jet 
 
 trails in the sky, one launching a missile here. Russian forces are being pushed back from around the town of Avdiivka, we are told, from positions 
 
 Russians have occupied for about nine years before last year's war even started. 
 
SERHIY, ARTILLERY COMMANDER, SEPARATE MARINE BRIGADE (through text translation): We moved forward to the left of Avdiivka. In two days we took 
 
 up to a kilometer. It's quite a success. They abandon positions, slowly pull back. They are less and less strong. See, they can't hold on and pull 
 
 back. 
 
WALSH: Whether this is a weak spot in Russia's lines or a counteroffensive in action, we do not know. But this pushback in the east is something these 
 
 troops from the 128th Territorial Defense Brigade training furiously, hope to replicate in the south where the counteroffensive will likely focus. 
 
There is little shortage of ammunition here, quite the opposite. And they say the Russians already seem to know something from Ukraine's coming. 
 
RENAT, UKRAINIAN SERVICEMAN, 128TH TERRITORIAL DEFENSE BRIGADE (through text translation): They are scared and fire more at our positions. They 
 
 were preparing for some time for our counteroffensive, shelling less to save ammunition. And now they are not holding back. 
 
WALSH: For all the simulation and noise, the reality on the front has been ugly, brutal. They show us this video taken from a dead Russian that shows 
 
 his tank trying to escape. 
 <br>[10:15:08]
 
The Ukrainians know this horror, too. 
 
DMYTRO, UKRAINIAN SERVICEMAN, 128TH TERRITORIAL DEFENSE BRIGADE (through text translation): There are enemy tanks and artillery working on us. They 
 
 use all they have. I lost my best friend, my uncle, and my best friend's father. 
 
WALSH: It will be real again all too soon. Heavy losses fueling their steps forwards. 
 
Nick Paton Walsh, CNN, near Huliaipole, Ukraine. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON: Well, tensions over the war broke out at a meeting of Black Sea nations in Turkey when a Russian delegate tore down the Ukrainian flag. The 
 
 Ukrainian delegate punched him. On social media, the Ukrainian member of parliament wrote, "Paws off our flag. Paws off Ukraine." And some words 
 
 that we can't repeat here. Earlier, scuffles broke out when Ukrainians tried to shout over what was a Russian speaker. 
 
Well, still ahead on the show, I'm Becky Anderson, of course. The time is 6:15 here in the UAE. Coming up, a coronation fit for a king. More on what 
 
 is our top story this hour with final preparations for the king's coronation in Britain in full swing. And from the king to reigning 
 
 champions in the football world, a crown for Napoli in Serie A. That after this. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: Well, we are just hours away from an event that many of us have never witnessed before in our lifetimes. The coronation of a new British 
 
 monarch. King Charles III, this time. He'll be crowned in Westminster Abbey on Saturday in a ceremony drawing on almost a millennium of tradition. 
 
 Crowds already out in force despite heavy rainfall across London and across other parts of the U.K. 
 
Well, from the stone of destiny to a throne dating back to the 1300s, ancient pageantry will be on display like never before for the modern 
 
 world. Our modern world to see at the heart of the coronation of King Charles will be deeply religious ceremony. One that will showcase Britain's 
 
 rich spiritual heritage. 
 
My colleague Max Foster has more. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN ROYAL CORRESPONDENT and ANCHOR (voice-over): For more than a thousand years, the coronation ceremony for English monarchs has remained 
 
 largely unchanged. King Charles will walk into Westminster Abbey in the footsteps of his ancestors. Ancient symbols like the Stone of Scone seized 
 
 from Scotland by King Edward in the 13th century and used in coronations ever since, brought to London for Saturday's event. 
 <br>[10:20:07]
 
The palace says he also wants to reflect modern Britain and look to the future. The challenge will be how to do both during a cost-of-living 
 
 crisis.
 
Charles will be crowned with the St. Edward's crown, the very same one placed upon previous monarchs. Crown jewels will feature, including 
 
 scepters, a golden orb and various swords, each with their own symbolism. He'll wear robes that have been passed down through the generations. 
 
The anointing, the most sacred spiritual part of the service, will be hidden from view by a special screen, one of the only newly made pieces for 
 
 the coronation. Because Charles, who's always been known for his environmental campaigning, has been keen to emphasize reuse. 
 
He'll be welcomed to the Abbey first by a young chorister, to whom he'll say, I come not to be served, but to serve. 
 
Inclusivity is at the top of his agenda. The ceremony will be conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury, the most senior member of the Church of 
 
 England after the King. 
 
JUSTIN WELBY, ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY: It looks around at our society and seeks to reflect us as we are with joy and celebration. 
 
FOSTER: For the first time, people of multiple faiths will have a role. Even the Pope has sent a gift, fragments believed to be of Jesus' cross, 
 
 which have been incorporated into this new one, which will lead the coronation procession. Symbols, the new monarch hopes, will be enough to 
 
 reflect his continued relevance in a modern world whilst honoring sacred tradition. 
 
Max Foster, CNN London. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON: We'll have more on what this very ancient ceremony. What it means for a very modern Britain. Let's bring in royal biographer, Sally Bedell 
 
 Smith, who is in London. 
 
Let's just remind ourselves then before we sort of do a deep dive on. Been 70 years since the last time we saw a ceremony like that. And we certainly 
 
 didn't have the sort of social media, the digital channels, LiliaTV channels, the streaming channels that we have today. And yet, this was well 
 
 watched by the British and a world audience. Just how have things changed? 
 
SALLY BEDELL SMITH, ROYAL BIOGRAPHER: Well, all the things that you've mentioned when the Queen was, when she went through her coronation back in 
 
 1953, the big innovation then was having a televised, which she actually resisted initially. But then was prevailed upon particularly by her 
 
 husband, the Duke of Edinburgh. And -- but she insisted on keeping the most sacred parts of the coronation service, the anointing, and also in her case 
 
 taking communion. 
 
And 86 years ago, and we last saw an actual king and queen go through a coronation, that was her parents George VI and Queen Elizabeth, they 
 
 allowed radio for the first time and newsreels which were shown in movie theaters. But in essence the ceremonies themselves were pretty much the 
 
 same as they had been really going back to at least Edward VII whose coronation was in 1902. 
 
And it is really only now that we have a new monarch who has spent really his entire life waiting to take the throne, that he's really imprinting 
 
 with some of his basic and cherished ideas. 
 
ANDERSON: Right. 
 
BEDELL SMITH:  As Max referred to earlier with the ecumenical aspect. 
 
ANDERSON: Yes, let's talk about those. Yes. Let's talk about those. Just how is King Charles going about making what is such an ancient ceremony, as 
 
 it were, into a very modern one for the 21st century? 
 
BEDELL SMITH: Yes, well, I think he is doing it with a great deal of imagination. Just having a 14-year-old boy greet him at the very beginning 
 
 brings a young person into the proceedings right away. And the words that he is going to say to him which is, I am here to serve you, and, you know, 
 
 with his signature he usually, or the Queen used to say, Elizabeth, are your servant. And he is being proceeded by a group of religious leaders 
 
 from non-Christian faiths. 
 <br>[10:25:03]
 
And in the course of the ceremony, people of different faiths are going to participate. You have to remember that even though the Catholic archbishop 
 
 was invited to be at the coronation in 1953 and 1937, they declined. Then it wasn't until 2013 when the laws were changed to allow a monarch to marry 
 
 a Catholic, and that was an ecumenical gesture that made it more comfortable for a Catholic to be included. 
 
And Charles, from the very, very beginning, from the time he was really a teenager, has been a spiritual seeker and has been a fascinated by other 
 
 religions. Muslim, Hindu, Buddhism, Sikh, Sufi. He loves Sufism because he described it as a one religion that honored many lamps over the course of 
 
 several years in the 1990s. 
 
ANDERSON: Right. 
 
BEDELL SMITH: He made pilgrimages to Mount Athos in Greece where there are monasteries for men only and he would go, and he would contemplate. And it 
 
 was something his father had done as well because his father was raised in the Greek Orthodox faith and converted to the Church of England. So there 
 
 is a lot there. Elements -- 
 
ANDERSON: It's good to have you on. It's going to be -- I'm sorry, we're going to have to take a break for the bottom of the hour here, but it's 
 
 super to have you on. I'm sure you'll enjoy the weekend. Our viewers thank you. 
 
BEDELL SMITH: Well, I can't wait. 
 
ANDERSON: You can get special live coverage of the coronation of King Charles III on Saturday, live here on CNN. That is made the six of course 
 
 starting 10:00 a.m. London, 5:00 a.m. Eastern. And 1:00 p.m., if you are watching here in Abu Dhabi, and will be everywhere from Buckingham Palace 
 
 to Westminster Abbey. And all along the Mall with the crowd. You'll see that all on CNN. 
 
All right. Coming up, the ocean temperatures are heating up. The surprising culprits behind the rise. And one of the most successful singer songwriters 
 
 around says, he is sick of being sued. How a jury verdict this week could impact the future of songwriting is after this. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: Welcome back. I'm Becky Anderson in Abu Dhabi. 
 <br>[10:30:02]
 
You're watching CONNECT THE WORLD. The time here is half past 6:00 in the evening. Here are your headlines this hour. 
 
Witnesses report fresh fighting near Sudan's presidential palace. Warplanes were also seen over Khartoum. Rival military factions ignoring yet another 
 
 cease fire. Conflict which is about to roll into its fourth week has killed hundreds of people. 
 
China is hitting back at accusations of political interference by Canada. The Chinese ambassador to Canada was summoned to respond to claims of that 
 
 Beijing tried to intimidate Canadian politician Michael Chong following his criticism of how Beijing treats Uyghur minorities. China calls the claims 
 
 groundless. 
 
In Japan, a 6.3 magnitude earthquakes struck near the town of Noto in central Japan on Friday. Local officials said at least one person has died. 
 
 The Japanese prime minister has set up an emergency efforts to assess the damage. No abnormalities were detected at the nearby nuclear power plant. 
 
Well, ocean surface temperatures reached record-breaking levels last month. And scientists are alarmed. Temperatures naturally rise going into April 
 
 but this year is warmer than ever. In addition to global warming and approaching El Nino, there may be another factor having an effect. Recent 
 
 changes in shipping regulations limit how much sulfur can be used in fuel and it turns out that air pollution was acting as an artificial sunscreen 
 
 and getting rid of it may have aided in turning up the heat. 
 
Well, here to explain more is chief climate correspondent Bill Weir who is outside New York City. 
 
Just dig a little deeper on this, if you would. What's going on here? And how important is this? 
 
BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT: Well, it could be hugely important, Becky. If the pollution that was sort of an accidental sunscreen 
 
 coming out of these massive container ships for the last decades now, if that was masking the true effects of global warming by a degree or more, 
 
 well then that's bad. That means we've undercounted just how much warming has been hiding in the oceans. 
 
When you think about heating up a bathtub, one kettle of water at a time. That's what is happening, only that kettle of water has the heat of five 
 
 Hiroshima sized atomic bombs every second. That's how much extra heat comes into our oceans. And a lot of that we don't notice because it has such an 
 
 incredible absorbing power there. But now, some are worried this could be a new tipping point. 
 
It could be cyclical, it could have to do with El Nino, a natural sort of system that will warm up the Pacific. But if it's this hot now, Becky, how 
 
 bad is it going to be if El Nino is around for a couple of years now? That's the concern, and of course the effects of this, warmer water takes 
 
 up more space, so that's more sea level rise. It means less ice shelves at both ends of the earth. It means moving fish stocks. These heat waves, 
 
 marine heat waves are moving like cod the way they fled the Gulf of Maine. And then there's coral beaching. That piece of it as well. So a lot to 
 
 worry about here. 
 
ANDERSON: You've just described very adjointly the problem here and the effects. So what is the solution? 
 
WEIR: The solution is the same answer as always. The sooner we can transition away from fuels that burn the better. The less damage that will 
 
 be done ultimately. The other solution is bracing for what is sort of built into the system now. Adaptation measures on coastal cities, but this 
 
 affects all forms of life regardless of where you are in relation to these oceans. 
 
ANDERSON: Bill, good to have you, sir. Thank you very much indeed. 
 
Pop music superstar Ed Sheeran says copyright lawsuits are damaging the songwriting industry. He made that comment shortly after a New York jury 
 
 ruled in his favor in a lawsuit alleging that Sheeran used the proportion of Marvin Gaye's hit song "Let's Get It On" in his hit, "Thinking Out 
 
 Loud." It is the third time Sheeran has been sued for copyright infringement for one of his songs. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ED SHEERAN, SINGER, SONGWRITER: If the jury had decided this matter the other way, we might as well say goodbye to the creative freedom of 
 
 songwriters. We need to be able to write our original music and engage in independent creation without worrying at every step of the way that such 
 
 creativity would be wrongly called into question. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: CNN's entertainment reporter Chloe Melas joins us. 
 
And this is a really interesting case, isn't it? Because there's what's happened with Ed Sheeran, and there's much wider story going on. Let's just 
 
 touch on, you know, the specifics of this case. Ed Sheeran said he is fed up of being shaken like the proverbial piggy bank. What is ultimately, 
 
 where does he go from here? 
 <br>[10:35:07]
 
CHLOE MELAS, CNN ENTERTAINMENT CORRESPONDENT: Well, I mean, he has a new album that has come out today, Becky. It's almost like perfectly 
 
 orchestrated timing that only a mega superstar could manage to do. 
 
I sat in that trial almost every single day. I listened to both the defense and the plaintiffs argue both sides. And I think that what it comes down to 
 
 is that, "Thinking Out Loud" and "Let's Get It On" has a very similar and common four-chord progression. So for those of you that don't play music, 
 
 there are these four chords that are found in many songs as it turns out. And the defense was able to lay it out very clearly for the jury that this 
 
 four-chord progression was found in songs that predate Marvin Gaye and Ed Townsend's hit single from 1973, "Let's Get It On." 
 
So in the sense that, yes, this is a creative arrangement of art that was copyrighted in this deposit copy of "Let's Get It On," but this was also 
 
 commonplace in songs before and that Marvin Gaye and Ed Townsend were not the first to create it. And obviously, the jury they felt really strongly 
 
 about that, siding with them. And, you know, this is a pivotal moment for the music industry, because as Ed Sheeran pointed out, if it hadn't gone 
 
 this way, going forward musicians like in theory would have had to ask the Townsend family for permission, therefore stifling creativity when it comes 
 
 to those four chords. 
 
I did speak to Ed Sheeran's co-writer of "Thinking Out Loud," Amy Wadge, who also testified at one point during the trial, and she spoke to me 
 
 moments after the verdict and got a bit emotional. Take a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MELAS: Talk about what the meaning that this verdict has on the music industry? 
 
AMY WADGE, SINGER, SONGWRITER: I think it's a very, very big far-reaching, you know, meaning for everybody creative. And I think it even goes beyond 
 
 music, the idea that it just comes down to building blocks of anything. It was a painter or a film. And for musician who has just relied upon very 
 
 little musical knowledge for my whole career, it was terrifying to even contemplate that this could happen. 
 
And so the fact that this has gone our way is just such a huge relief for every young songwriter. You know, it's all, you know, of course popstars 
 
 are huge part of this. But it's about the next generation of musicians who they are going to be and making sure that they still happens, there's still 
 
 music still created. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MELAS: So Kathryn Townsend who brought this lawsuit, at one point in the courtroom after the verdict was read, she was seen giving Ed Sheeran a hug. 
 
 And we had some reporters in there for CNN who said that Ed was overheard saying that he would love to invite her to an upcoming show. And as she 
 
 walked out, she was smiling out of the courthouse. She didn't really address anyone but she did say, God is great and, you know, or God is good, 
 
 and you know, she seemed OK. And she always said this wasn't about money. But that this was just about upholding her father's legacy. 
 
So what does this mean for the music industry you asked? Just to bring it full circle. I think it's an important moment. But I think that we will 
 
 continue to see these lawsuits, continue to pop up. And maybe against Ed in the future. You know, so, I don't think any star can evade those types of 
 
 lawsuits. 
 
ANDERSON: Yes, he said he's sick of being sued. He's one of the most successful singer, songwriters around. This verdict could or perhaps should 
 
 impact the future of songwriting. It's whether it will or not, as you rightly point out. It is, we are likely to see these sorts of cases 
 
 carrying on. Thank you. 
 
From a pop superstar star to the reigning superstars of Italian football, Napoli hosts a street party like no other as its main team win Serie A.

ANDERSON: Well, a party three decades in the making. There were huge festivities, and I mean huge festivities, last night in Naples as Napoli 
 
 won their first Serie A title in 33 years. The last time that happened, it was none other than Diego Maradona himself who led the team to victory. 
 
I'm old enough, Andy of "WORLD SPORT," to remember that occasion. It was remarkable, once again, to see Naples alive last night. This is a city that 
 
 loves its football. So deservedly so. 
 
ANDY SCHOLES, CNN WORLD SPORT ANCHOR: Yes, certainly, and Becky, think about that. 33 years, there's a lot of grown men and women in that crowd 
 
 who have never experienced a celebration like this. They waited so long, and you know, the years and years of suffering and waiting for a moment 
 
 like this just made it so much sweeter, right? That's why these celebrations were so much fun to watch. 
 
We'll show you how Napoli got it done and created these celebrations coming up in a little bit on "WORLD SPORT." But, man, there were some fun pictures 
 
 to see for sure. 
 
ANDERSON: Superb stuff. That's WORLD SPORT coming up after the break. We'll be back top of the hour for you for the second hour of CONNECT THE WORLD 
 
 here on CNN. I'm Becky Anderson. Stay with us.
