MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome back to CNN NEWSROOM, I'm Max Foster. Here are today's top stories. 
 
More than 9 million people in central and northern Florida are under tornado watch right now. It includes the cities of Orlando and Tampa. The severe storms could bring large hail and damaging wind gusts. 
 
Brazil's President Lula da Silva is expected to visit the state of Rio Grande do Sul today. At least 149 people have died from recent flooding and more than 800 others have been injured. 
 
The grandson of former U.S. President Jimmy Carter said Tuesday that he is, quote, coming to the end. Carter has been in hospice care for nearly a year and a half. At the age of 99, he is the oldest living U.S. President in history. 
 
U.S. President Joe Biden currently increasing tariffs on $18 billion worth of imports from China to counter what the White House calls unfair trade practices by Beijing. The new tariffs apply to a range of products such as steel and aluminum, electric vehicles, battery components, solar cells, cranes and medical products.
 
Electric vehicles will see the biggest hike, going from about 27 percent to 100 percent. It's meant to challenge Beijing's practice of encouraging very low pricing by domestic EV makers while charging a 40 percent tariff on U.S. car imports to China. Here's President Biden.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The price is unfairly low because Chinese companies don't need to worry about a profit because the Chinese government subsidized them and subsidized them heavily. And Chinese relies on other anti-competitive tactics as well, like forcing American companies to transfer their technology in order to do business in China. 
 
Sometimes it's just outright steal through cyber espionage and other means. And it's been a well-documented and internationally recognized. And when you make tactics like these, you're not competing. It's not competition, it's cheating. (END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: CNN's Steven Jiang joins us now from Beijing. Obviously, Beijing is not liking that sort of language. But the more immediate question is how you think they might respond.
 
STEVEN JIANG, CNN BEIJING BUREAU CHIEF: That's right, Max. So far, their rhetoric has been quite predictable. Strong protest, firm opposition accusing Washington of politicizing trade issues.
 
And, of course, they have promised so far unspecified countermeasures against these new tariffs. But if you talk to Chinese officials and analysts, many of them do understand election year politics in the U.S. And many of them say this is simply Biden's posturing aimed at key voters in swing states, especially those union workers in the Rust Belt. 
 
So the question becomes whether or not they will take that into consideration when they make their next move. When is their retaliation going to be symbolic? 
 
But when you look at the numbers, $18 billion, quadrupling of current tariff rates, they are very eye-catching. But in the bigger scheme of things, this is only some 4 percent of all of Chinese imports into the U.S. So we're not likely to see an immediate major impact on bilateral trade. The deeper concern here is actually whether other Western economies, especially fellow G7 members, would follow suit and impose something similar. 
 
That could actually potentially have a bigger impact, considering, for example, the Chinese EV industry's much bigger footprint in Europe. And, of course, Max, they're not looking at this in a vacuum from Beijing.
 
They have seen a pattern emerge after that Xi-Biden summit last year. The U.S. keep adding more Chinese companies on their entity list because of alleged ties to the Russian defense industrial base and more export controls targeting China and now these tariffs. So the worry is whether this latest announcement could jeopardize this whole relationship that has just recently been stabilized -- Max.
 
FOSTER: Couldn't be better timing for President Putin, who's visiting China.
 
JIANG: That's right. Presumably, Putin and Xi will talk about this. And the one thing that's clear is both men increasingly bonded over their desire to reshape this U.S.-led world order. And their so-called no-limit partnership has really withstood the test of times, which is in a way surprising to a lot of people, considering the challenges. 
 
But the one thing that's been proven time and again is their bilateral trade, for example, soaring. They see a lot of benefits in strengthening these bonds.
 <br>[04:35:00] And the question right now for the Chinese leadership, especially Xi Jinping, is whether this so-called straddle strategy that is forming this very close strategic bond with Russia while trying to maintain massive trade relationship with the West, that can be sustained in the long run, especially considering a lot of European countries are very worried about Putin's policy and strategy undermining the core of European security -- Max.
 
FOSTER: Steven Jiang in Beijing, thank you so much.
 
Developing story out of the French territory of New Caledonia, where at least one person has been killed as gunfire broke out during violent protests against the French government. The island has seen its worst unrest in decades in response to a bill in Paris which would give more French nationals in New Caledonia the right to vote. Pro- independence groups feel it's an attempt by France to consolidate power over the Pacific island chain.
 
More than 130 people have been arrested in the protests. Dozens of security officers have been injured. Demonstrators have set fire to buildings and cars, and a curfew is in place until Thursday.
 
French President Emmanuel Macron will chair a Defence and National Security Council meeting this morning to discuss the ongoing violence over there. 
 
Joining me now, though, is Coralie Cochin, a local journalist in New Caledonia. Thank you so much for joining us, Coralie. Just explain what the atmosphere is like there and what you're seeing.
 
CORALIE COCHIN, JOURNALIST: So, tonight is going to be the third night of, probably, violence again, so it's quite difficult to go out --
 
FOSTER: There are some communication issues we've been having over the course of the morning, but it's an important story, so we'll try to get back to Coralie a bit later on. 
 
Now, ancient tree rings reveal a dark, or stark, rather, new warning. A study finds last summer was the hottest in at least 2,000 years, going back to the year 246, when the Roman Empire ruled Europe and the Mayans controlled Central America too, and this warning is creating dangerous extremes.
 
In the U.S., more than 200 tornadoes have already been reported this month alone, and for the year, the active tornado season thus far is the second busiest on record to date. There's also deadly flooding around the world, claiming hundreds of lives in Afghanistan, Indonesia, Brazil and Argentina. 
 
Meanwhile, crews in Canada are battling more than 130 active wildfires, over 40 of which are out of control. Most are burning in the western provinces of Alberta and British Columbia, where tens of thousands of hectares have been scorched. One of the fires, driven by strong winds, is approaching the town of Fort McMurray, where several neighborhoods were ordered to evacuate.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We had an alert yesterday, so we're just being really proactive. And just -- I asked my kids, so I have four, and I asked them to just pack a bag overnight, so that's ready to go in case we have to evacuate.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: Crews had to be pulled from the fire -- the fire line that was one of the last huge safety concerns, really, forcing them to battle it mainly from the air. 
 
Flooding in north-eastern Argentina has forced hundreds of families to flee their homes for safer ground. The heavy rain that struck southern Brazil over the past several weeks has caused the Uruguay River to overflow in Argentina. Local officials say some 568 people were evacuated on Monday. 
 
In Indonesia, more than 50 people have died after torrential rain in that country triggered flash floods over the weekend. The floods have brought with it cold lava from a nearby volcano, forcing nearly 3,400 residents to evacuate. Cold lava is a mixture of volcanic material and pebbles that flow down volcano slopes during wet weather. 
 
CNN's Lynda Kinkade has more on that.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
LYNDA KINKADE, CNN ANCHOR (voice-over): Roza Yolanda sits on a hospital bed. She's covered in cuts and bruises head to toe. The recent college graduate tells Reuters she was at home Saturday, texting her sister about the heavy rain outside. Moments later, she heard a thundering noise.
 
ROZA YOLANDA, FLOOD SURVIVOR (through translator): Suddenly the lights went out and the water rushed in. I didn't have time to stand up and I no longer had time to run and was just washed away by the flood.
 
KINKADE (voice-over): Flash floods triggered by torrential rains in Indonesia's West Sumatra province have left dozens dead and missing. Mudslides and cold lava flow from volcanic eruptions, a mixture of rock, sand, water and volcanic ash, adding to the level of devastation, inundating roads and sweeping away homes, trapping victims or sending them into nearby rivers.
 
YOLANDA (through translator): I got stuck on the road that was full of wooden materials and debris from the houses that were washed away. I got trapped by the pile of debris and the water was not flowing anymore. 
 <br>[04:40:00]
 
And I hit the rubble and then tried to get my head out of the water because I could feel the water flow was receding.
 
KINKADE (voice-over): Thousands of people have been evacuated from their flooded homes as rescuers recover bodies and dig through the damage.
 
While Roza Yolanda recovers in hospital, others remain lost in the rubble. 
 
YOLANDA (through translator): Mom, thank God, is safe while they are still searching for my dad. 
 
KINKADE (voice-over): With heavy rains forecast throughout the week, the dire search for survivors continues.
 
This, the latest flood catastrophe, as unprecedented rainfall triggers flash floods around the world. 
 
Lynda Kinkade, CNN.

FOSTER: We're going to go back now to Coralie Cochin, a local journalist in New Caledonia, because you were describing, Coralie, the protests and how you feel it's unsafe to go out.
 
COCHIN: Yes, and what I was telling you is that people think, people fear that tonight is going to be worse than the other two nights before. Because, as you said, one people was dead. And now we just learned that another people, but now two people are dead. That's what we were told by the high commissioner. 
 
And so we don't know a lot of information about this second victim. But the first one has been shot, not by the police, but by another people from the neighborhood.
 
So it's going to be very tense in the streets because it's not only policemen against people who protest, but now people who are living in the neighborhood against people who are protesting.
 
FOSTER: The French president holding an emergency meeting about this today. What can he say to calm concerns, do you think? Because this is about the right of French citizens to vote on the islands.
 
COCHIN: I think it's going to be very difficult for Emmanuel Macron to find something to say to people here to calm down. Because the independentists have said a lot of time, we don't want this law, we don't want it. So now that there are two people dead, I don't know, apart from sending more policemen here to calm down things, I don't know what he can say to these people here rioting.
 
It's going to be very difficult. They said that they don't want to hear anything. Now it's too late. That's what he said.
 
FOSTER: The protesters are in the minority, obviously, because of these, you know, it doesn't involve everyone. But would you say they represent a majority view on the islands or a minority view on the islands?
 
COCHIN: It's a good question, actually. There are maybe several hundred people rioting, protesting. But even though some of the independentist people in the population don't agree with all the things that are done, like the fire, but they support them because they are OK with what they defend.
 
So it's going to be difficult for the president to -- how do you say -- to find a solution here, not only in the streets, but for the whole people, independentist people, to calm down.
 
FOSTER: Will it help the independence campaign, do you think? Because obviously France is facing, you know, issues with former colonies around the world at the moment. This idea of a foreign power dominating a local community. What do you think?
 
COCHIN: Can you ask the question again? Sorry.
 
FOSTER: You know, France is facing issues in many countries where it's seen as a former colonial power and shouldn't have any rights over the local communities. Do you think this may help the independence campaign, basically?
 
COCHIN: Yes, maybe. It's difficult to say because at the United Nations, the tribe, the independence people tried to defend their cause. For example, for the third referendum, they tried, but it's difficult to have an answer for them.
 <br>[04:45:00]
 
So I don't really know. And especially with the tension in the Pacific area, so a lot of people, like the American people, like Australian people, they really want New Caledonia to stay French. So it's going to be difficult for them.
 
FOSTER: Big question, isn't it? Coralie Cochin, thank you so much indeed for joining us from there.
 
And we'll be back in a moment.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: A manhunt is underway in France for at least two gunmen who ambushed a prison convoy, freeing an inmate and killing two guards in the process. After finding two burned-out vehicles used in the attack, investigators are now looking for any clues as to where they could have headed. CNN's Saskya Vandoome has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SASKYA VANDOOME, CNN SENIOR PRODUCER: This kind of incident is extremely rare in France. Now, it happened shortly after 11 a.m. Two gunmen ambushed a police van that was transporting an inmate from court to a nearby prison in Normandy.
 
Now, authorities say the gunman killed two guards and wounded three others while helping the prisoner escape. Both the gunman and prisoner are now at large and there's an ongoing manhunt for them. 
 
Now, this happened at a motorway tollbooth where many cars had stopped, so there are several videos of the scene. One quite dramatic video shows two hooded individuals who look like they're carrying long rifles. 
 
Now, the Justice Minister has said that everything will be done to find the perpetrators. But what do we know about the prisoner?
 
Well, he's 30 years old and he was in prison because he had been convicted of burglary. He's also being investigated for a kidnapping that resulted in a death, according to the national prosecutor. 
 
Now, there are currently several hundred police officers that have been deployed in the manhunt and authorities on the scene have set up roadblocks.
 
President Macron also weighed in, saying that every effort is being made to find the perpetrators of this crime so that justice can be done in the name of the French people. 
 
Saskya Vandoome, CNN, Paris.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
FOSTER: Buckingham Palace revealing the first official portrait of King Charles since his coronation. What do you think? The King himself did the honors on Tuesday.
 
Artist Jonathan Yeo was also present at the unveiling. The King is depicted with a sword in hand and a butterfly landing on his shoulder. Here's what locals around London think about it.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think it's nice. It's different to what you'd see normally in like a royal portrait. It's a bit more modern, I would say.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's very artistic and I don't -- hmm. It's kind of ghoulish.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's striking. I mean, I think if -- it'd be really cool as like a, you know, rock music cover album or something, album cover or something maybe. I like the face. I think they've done a really good job on that.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I mean, the face actually shows a lot of character. I'm not quite keen about the red. It looks like floating head and floating hands.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 <br>[04:50:00]
 
FOSTER: Well, the King is in the uniform of the Welsh Guards. Charles took part in four sittings for that portrait. The artist says he wanted to reference the history of royal portraits and the modern monarchy while showing the King's deep humanity. Just ahead, college basketball sensation Caitlin Clark makes her professional debut as the 2024 WNBA season tips off with excitement surrounding the sport at a pretty much all-time high.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: The excitement surrounding the 2024 WNBA season is through the roof, largely due to a crop of talented young players, headlined, of course, by rookie sensation Caitlin Clark. The number one pick in last month's draft made her season debut Tuesday for the Indiana Fever. Clark scored 20 points, which tied for the game high, but the fever fell to the Connecticut Sun, 92-71.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CAITLIN CLARK, INDIANA FEVER GUARD: Obviously, I'm disappointed, and nobody likes to lose. Like, that's how it is. But I don't think you can beat yourself up too much about, you know, one game. I don't think that's going to help this team. I don't think, no matter who it is on this team, nobody can do that with how they played. And just learn from it and move on.
 
And, you know, I guess I'm just excited for Thursday to get back home and have our home opener. You know, I thought I -- I thought it took me a little while to settle into the game.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: Still, expectations are high for Clark after her historic season at the University of Iowa. Ticket prices for the Fever more than doubled even before Clark was drafted, and her number 22 Fever jerseys sold out within just a matter of hours of going on sale. 
 
In golf, Tiger Woods says he feels good about his game heading into the PGA Championship on Thursday. Woods is returning to the Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville, Kentucky, where he won the same championship back in 2000. This will be his third tournament of the year as he deals with injuries. He withdrew from the Genesis Open in February due to illness and finished sixth at the Masters last month.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TIGER WOODS, FOUR-TIME PGA CHAMPIONSHIP WINNER: I still feel that I can win golf tournaments. I still feel I can hit the shots and still feel like I have my hands around the greens and I can putt. I just need to do it for all four days, not like I did in Augusta for only two.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: Woods faces a tough competition. World No. 1 Scottish Scheffler is amongst the favorites to win this week, along with defending champion Brooks Koepka and Rory McIlroy, who won the championships the last time it was at Valhalla, which was 2014.
 
Legendary tennis star Serena Williams will host this year's ESPY Awards show. The 23-time Grand Slam singles champion says hosting the show, which celebrates the past year in sports, is a dream come true. And she added that it's been a sensational year for sports and an unprecedented one for female athletes.
 
Williams last played competitively in the 2022 U.S. Open. The ESPY's set to air on July 11. 
 
After meeting in Kyiv with the Ukrainian president, the U.S. Secretary of State sampled Ukrainian pizza. Ukraine's foreign minister took Antony Blinken to a pizzeria on Tuesday and reportedly joked about catching flack for bringing him to McDonald's during his last visit. The country's top diplomats split two pizzas, one with meat, the other with a vegetarian. Blinken raved about the meal.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[04:55:00]
 
ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Well, I have to say, as somewhat of a knowledgeable person about pizza, as most Americans are, the pizza here is superb. I highly, highly recommend it.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: There you go. After dinner, an unexpected performance too. Blinken covering a Neil Young Soviet-era anthem, Rocking in the Free World, while jamming alongside a local Ukrainian band at an underground bar popular with soldiers and veterans.
 
He pledged steadfast support from the U.S. as Russia ramps up its attacks.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BLINKEN: Your soldiers, your citizens, particularly in the northeast, in Kharkiv, are suffering tremendously. But they need to know, you need to know, the United States is with you, so much of the world is with you. And they're fighting, not just for a free Ukraine, but for the free world. And the free world is with you too.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: Two Sumatran tiger cubs born at Berlin Zoo in February have been given names, you'll be glad to hear. They'll now be called Kuno and Ede, which are the names of popular German cartoon characters. The zoo says the names are also meant to mark efforts to protect the highly endangered species. The cubs were unveiled to the public on Tuesday. 
 
It was a rough competition at the Westminster Dog Show on Tuesday, as dog lovers gathered in New York to watch the canine contenders vie for the top title. The best-in-show title was claimed by a miniature poodle named Sage.
 
Look at that ownership. The three-year-old Ball of Fur, as some people were calling it, was the clear favorite of the crowd. To win, she had to outshine six other group winners.
 
The honor for runner-up went to Mercedes, a German shepherd. 
 
Workers at a Las Vegas airport are saying goodbye to their long- serving canine. Meanwhile, airport workers thanked the ten-year-old Dodi for his service with a proper tennis ball send-off. Dodi is a German wire-haired pointer who enjoys taking naps and going on long walks with his handler, which I hope he'll get to enjoy even more in his retirement. 
 
I wonder if he keeps the balls. I think he should be allowed to.
 
I'm Max Foster. Thank you for joining me here on CNN NEWSROOM. CNN "THIS MORNING" is up next.
