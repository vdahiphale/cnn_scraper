LAILA HARRAK, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Hello and welcome to our viewers watching from around the world. I'm Laila Harrak. 
 
Ahead on CNN NEWSROOM, an incredible story of survival, four young children found alive in Colombia after more than a month wandering the Amazon jungle. 
 
Trump indicted, the former U.S. president facing more than three dozen felony counts related to his handling of classified documents.
 
Is relief on the way for Canada? Rain could help ease conditions in Eastern Canada as wildfires rage across the country.
 
ANNOUNCER: Live from CNN Center, this is CNN NEWSROOM with Laila Harrak. 
 
HARRAK: All right, we begin this hour with a remarkable testament of survival in the Amazon rainforest. That's how the president of Colombia describes the incredible rescue of four indigenous children who have been missing since the first of May. 
 
Within the past few minutes, they arrived in Bogota. This is video of the children being taken off an air ambulance and that transported them from the jungle to Bogota for further treatment. 
 
President Gustavo Petro says the children appeared weak when they were rescued and received medical treatment before they boarded the plane. 
 
The four siblings went missing when the small plane they were traveling on with their mother crashed in the jungle, while hundreds of military forces and indigenous scouts were involved in the week's long search and rescue operation. The children's grandfather was understandably overjoyed after learning that his grandchildren were safe. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
FIDENCIO VALENCIA, CHILDREN'S GRANDFATHER (through translator): This situation didn't let us sleep, didn't let us be happy, we couldn't talk. For us, the situation was like being in the dark. We walked for the sake of walking, living for the sake of living because the hope of finding them kept us alive.

HARRAK: Stefano Pozzebon is covering the story for us and has the latest now from Bogota.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
STEFANO POZZEBON, REPORTER: It was a rescue mission that was successful against all odds. The four children found alive after spending 14 days in the thick of the Amazon jungle in Calcutta in southeastern Colombia. The relatives you can imagine burst into tears when they received the news that their four children were coming home. 
 
And the president of Colombia Gustavo Petro also shared -- emotionally shared the news with reporters. Take a listen.
 
GUSTAVO PETRO, COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Together, the military forces and the indigenous communities that helped with the search effort found the children 40 days after the plane crashed. They were on their own. They themselves are an example of survival that will go down in history. 
 
Today, those children are the children of peace and the children of Colombia.
 
POZZEBON (voice over): The rescue on Friday night captured an all- around effort by hundreds of soldiers and indigenous scouts to try to locate the four children who had been missing since the small plane they were traveling on with their mother crashed in the thick of the forest on the first of May.
 
The body of the mother as well as two other adults that were traveling together on the small plane were recovered soon after the crash. But hope never faded to locate and rescue these four children. 
 
They Colombian military said they recovered scattered debris, relics and found footprints to keep the search going day after day until Friday. These photos emerged from the thick of the forest, they'll bring in the most unexpected and most pleasant news to their families but also to this entire nation. 
 
POZZEBON: For CNN, this is Stefano Pozzebon, Bogota.

HARRAK: Now to the latest on the 37 criminal charges against Donald Trump revealed a detailed federal indictment that's now public. The former U.S. president is accused of storing and hiding sensitive
 
 and highly classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago resorts and home, allegedly conspiring with an aide to defy a subpoena for the material. 
 
Prosecutors say Trump kept secret information in a bathroom, shower, bedroom and ballroom. The former commander-in-chief allegedly showed off classified materials on two occasions including a document that Trump is set to have described as a plan of attack.
 
Special Counsel Jack Smith says laws to protect America's national defense must be enforced as the indictment warns that Trump risked exposing military and nuclear secrets of the U.S. and its allies.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 <br>[02:05:14]
 
JACK SMITH, U.S. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SPECIAL COUNSEL: Our nation's commitment to the rule of law sets an example for the world. We have one set of laws in this country, and they apply to everyone.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK: More now from CNN's a Senior Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PAULA REID, CNN SENIOR LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: In this indictment, prosecutors lay out how former President Trump allegedly intentionally retained over 300 classified documents, including information about U.S. defense and weapons capabilities, as well as its nuclear programs and potential vulnerabilities to attack, as well as plans for possible retaliation in response to a foreign attack. 
 
Now, according to prosecutors, these documents were kept at various locations at Mar-a-Lago, including a ballroom, a bathroom, a shower and office space, his bedroom and even a storage closet. And the indictment even includes a photo where you can see documents, sensitive secrets meant only for a handful of our closest allies, strewn about the floor of a storage room. 
 
And prosecutors also say that on two occasions, the former President Trump shared classified information with people who did not have proper clearances. The first incident is actually something that was first reported by CNN, it was a meeting at his Bedminster, New Jersey Golf Club in 2021, where he showed people information that he said was highly secretive, and that he could not declassify it because he was no longer president. 
 
He also allegedly shared a classified map with a representative from his political action committee. The prosecutors also lay out how they allege he was trying to press his lawyer about possibly lying to the FBI after the government subpoenaed Trump to get his records back. 
 
They also lay out a series of damning incidents and conversations with one of his aides, Walt Nauta, what appears that he is pressuring Nauta to move boxes containing classified materials, not only to keep them from Trump's lawyers, but also to keep them for investigators. 
 
Now, we've heard from Jack Smith for the first time Friday, and he insisted that he wants this trial to move along as quickly as possible, likely mindful of an upcoming election next year.

HARRAK: Well, let's take a look now at the next steps in the process for Donald Trump. First will be his arraignment, so that's scheduled for Tuesday afternoon at the federal courthouse in Miami. 
 
After that comes the discovery process where attorneys for both sides exchange information about evidence and witnesses. 
 
Then, the legal teams can make motions, which could include asking that charges be dropped. 
 
The trial would come next. The Justice Department says it believes prosecutors will take about a month to present their case. If Trump is convicted, he would be sentenced and could appeal. 
 
Joining us from Los Angeles political analyst Michael Genovese is president of the Global Policy Institute at Loyola Marymount University. He's also the author of The Modern Presidency: Six Debates that Define the Institution. 
 
Michael, this feels monumental, what makes this so unique from a political perspective?
 
MICHAEL GENOVESE, PRESIDENT OF THE GLOBAL POLICY INSTITUTE, LOYOLA MARYMOUNT UNIVERSITY: You know, today was just jaw dropping, seismic. And we should of course preface it by saying that Donald Trump is innocent until proven guilty. But that indictment was powerful. Conspiracy, obstruction of justice, lying. 
 
To me, the most shocking element of it was the callous disregard for the protection of our national security. There were documents about our nuclear posture about what we would do in a retaliation of an attack about military capabilities. 
 
I disagreed with numerous presidents about policy, but I never thought a president in any way would intentionally jeopardize national security. That's exactly what happened here. 
 
And so, that is just -- that is the unprecedented thing. And it's just shocking to me.
 
HARRAK: What does the second indictment mean for the 2024 presidential race, the GOP primary and for Mr. Trump's chances to win back the office?
 
GENOVESE: Well, political scientists have long known that voters do not base their decisions or their votes on facts. They base them on perceptions. 
 
And so, they're very susceptible to shapers of perception and Donald Trump is a master salesman, and that's why he has been able to develop and keep a base in the Republican Party, the MAGA Republicans, he's their pied piper. He has the ability to weave a story that presents his enemies as their enemies, his fight as their fight, and they're engaged in a kind of war.
 <br>[02:10:08]
 
And so, Donald Trump is able to maintain his base, I don't think it's going to shake up one bit. I think he's still going to be the front runner in the Republican primaries.
 
HARRAK: Well, let's get the reaction from other GOP candidates. How have they reacted to this bombshell of the news and the GOP leadership in general?
 
GENOVESE: Most of the Republican candidates, most Republican officeholders are still definitely afraid of Donald Trump. They're afraid that he will say something about them. He will attack them, he'll get them primaried. And so, they all walk on eggshells around Donald Trump.
 
It's going to take one or two people with real courage. Christie has started that, a few others have hinted that they might be willing to frontally take on Trump. 
 
But until the Republican Party says that we're not going to be enablers, we're going to take you on, we're not going to accept this. Donald Trump will hold all the good cards because everyone in the Republican Party who's an officeholder seems to be afraid of the revenge of Donald Trump.
 
HARRAK: Michael, put this into historical context for us, a former president of the United States, who also happens to be running for president facing an indictment over the mishandling of the country's secrets.
 
GENOVESE: Everybody's used the word unprecedented. It's been overused. But it's not that uncommon in other countries. I mean, in other countries, they've run their leaders through the mill. 
 
In Israel, Netanyahu is being investigated. In France, Sarkozy was found guilty. In Italy, Moscone, and a number of countries have found that this facing -- a president facing legal decisions, and legal jeopardy is OK. 
 
In the United States, we have had past presidents who are corrupt. Richard Nixon comes to mind but no president in the past, all of history, and I wrote a book about this, has so soiled himself as Donald Trump.
 
When the history books are written in 20 years, what will they say about Donald Trump? The opening line we already know, Donald J. Trump 45th President of the United States, twice impeached, tried to overturn a democratic election come up, encourage the January 6 rioters to come and was indicted and you have to finish that sentence after this is over, unprecedented.
 
HARRAK: Michael Genovese, thank you for this conversation.
 
GENOVESE: Thank you so much.
 
HARRAK: While the indictment has been condemned by many Republicans, including those who are challenging Trump for president, Nikki Haley said, "This is not how justice should be pursued in our country. The American people are exhausted by the prosecutorial overreach, double standards and vendetta politics."
 
Meantime, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis called the move a weaponization of federal law enforcement.
 
And Trump's former Vice President Mike Pence said it was a troubling day for Americans that invites divisiveness.
 
But former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie had a different reaction.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE (R), U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Is this the type of conduct that we want from someone who wants to be president of the United States? To take national security documents involving warfare and our nuclear program, to keep them in their -- in their home when they're not allowed to do so, exposing them to potentially being seen by a number of people and then actually showing them to people, showing off? This is irresponsible conduct.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK: And we'll have much more coverage of former U.S. President Trump's indictments coming up a little later, including a look at the reactions from his fellow Republicans on Capitol Hill. 
 
A Ukrainian town survives within earshot of fighting and pins its hopes on a looming counter-offensive. That story ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:16:45]
 
HARRAK: Ukraine says the death toll from a catastrophic dam collapse has grown to at least five people with 13 still missing. The breach of the Nova Kakhovka dam caused massive flooding that inundated entire villages and forced thousands to evacuate. 
 
Officials now say much of the surrounding farmland could lose access to irrigation for years, which may drive farmers out of business while humanitarian workers are concerned about potential outbreaks of waterborne illness. 
 
And they say people in the affected areas now entirely depend on handouts for their drinking water. Military officials worried that mines dislodged by floodwaters could be pushed into the Black Sea and create new dangers there.
 
And while pieces of homes picked up by flooding are washing ashore as far as Odesa, which is more than two one kilometers away from the dam. 
 
While, meantime, Ukraine's military operations have been picking up along the frontlines in the Zaporizhzhia region, Russian President Vladimir Putin now says Ukraine's counter offensive has begun and says it's failing. 
 
Ukraine has said it will not officially announce the operation but a local Ukrainian commander says his forces are only testing Russian defenses for now. 
 
As Fred Pleitgen reports from one frontline town fighting is hard to ignore there.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Aid deliveries in one of the most dangerous places in Ukraine. We're with the Howard G. Buffett Foundation in Orikhiv, the frontline town where the Russians say Ukraine's military is trying to punch through their defenses. Constant artillery and mortar barrages driving residents underground.
 
PLEITGEN: Yes, so we have to go downstairs in the basement because there's been a distinct increase in shelling. And while you can't really see the counter offensive of the Ukrainians here, you can certainly hear it and feel it as well.
 
PLEITGEN (voice over): In the basement shelter, leader Valery Kubushka hands out aid boxes to the mostly elderly residents, many traumatized, but resilient.
 
It's very dangerous here, but I got used to it, 72-year-old Olga tells me. I can already distinguish rockets by their sound. I calm myself down. I ask 71-year-old Nina (PH) if she thinks the counter offensive can succeed.
 
Yes, I know about the counter offensive, she says. We will be closer to victory. Ours will push them back step by step until they drive them out, until there is a complete victory for Ukraine.
 
But for now, the going appears to be tough for the Ukrainians. While Kyiv hasn't acknowledged major offensive operations here, U.S. officials tell CNN the Ukrainian military is facing stiff Russian resistance. This Russian video purporting to show a column of Western donated armor struck by Moscow's forces. And the uptick in fighting has made it nearly impossible to get aid into Orikhiv, Valery tells me.
 
VALERY KUBUSHKA, HOWARD G. BUFFETT FOUNDATION: Orikhiv is one of the most dangerous, dangerous areas in Zaporizhzhia region. Orikhiv, Preobrazhenka it's 24 hours bumped, 24 hours. PLEITGEN (voice-over): But they have to get aid even to those too frail to make it to the distribution points. Grandma Polya (PH), as she's known here, can barely walk and refuses to be evacuated from her tiny house, even as shells keep raining down, her fate, she says is now in God's hands.
 <br>[02:20:13]
 
Will we survive or not, she asks, you're still young. May God give you health and help you to survive this war. It's very difficult for old people.

HARRAK: NATO is about to launch the largest Air Force drills in its 74-year history. Starting Monday about 10,000 service members from 25 nations will take part in the German lead air defender exercises. 
 
Using more than 200 military planes, they will train how to quickly deploy apply troops from Germany in the event of an attack. While officials say the 11-day drills are meant to deter threats to Europe's security and showcase the airpower of the Alliance. 
 
And the U.S. has announced a new security and aid package for Ukraine worth more than $2 billion. The Pentagon says it will include critical air defense capabilities such as missiles, artillery and additional ammunition. 
 
The announcement comes as Ukraine has been requesting further support from the west, primarily a pledge to join NATO and other security guarantees after the war. 
 
NATO's Secretary General has said Ukraine's future is in NATO, and that all nations agree.
 
However, President Zelenskyy says he wants the Alliance to give Kyiv what he calls a clear invitation at next month's summit in Lithuania. 
 
And we can talk more about all these issues with Fabrice Pothier, he is a former Director of Policy Planning at NATO and the CEO of the Rasmussen Global consultancy firm. And he joins me now from Spain. 
 
So, good to have you with us, please. 
 
FABRICE POTHIER, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, RASMUSSEN GLOBAL: Nice to see you.
 
HARRAK: Let's start with the President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, very outspoken obviously from the very get go about Ukraine joining NATO. 
 
Why is the Alliance still reluctant to agree to a timeline for Ukraine to join NATO? Why is it not extending an invitation to Ukraine to join them at the summit in Vilnius and what are some of the differences among members when it comes to this issue in Ukraine? POTHIER: Many questions, but quite central ones. I think you have different answers to that. First, they still -- I mean, there's the obvious notion that inviting a country like Ukraine to join NATO whilst war is raging on Ukraine's territory is obviously a very high risk move. And will pose immediately the question about does it mean NATO is de facto directly involved in a war against Russia. 
 
So, there is this reluctance. But I think on that, the Ukrainians are clear that, obviously, the NATO membership will be effective when major hostilities will cease, at least to an extent that you can have a clear definition of what is that NATO is protecting in terms of territory in Ukraine. 
 
However, this is the part that I think leaders in Washington are delaying, are more reluctant to officially talk about, there is still assumptions that somehow giving the NATO membership to Ukraine could be seen by Vladimir Putin as a provocation, and therefore, we should abstain from giving the membership because we don't want to further provoke Putin.
 
The paradox with that line of thinking is that Putin doesn't need more provocation to do what he's been doing, which is war of aggression, genocide, ecocide on a huge scale or the Ukrainian territory. 
 
And I think that thinking is what basically led us to where we are, which is a southern (PH) war of invasion against Ukraine by Russia. 
 
So, hopefully, by Vilnius in mid-July, the leaders Biden, Scholz will come together and realize that the old thinking no longer applies, that NATO and that Ukraine indeed has to have a place within the Alliance.
 
HARRAK: OK, let's talk about that meeting that's taking place on Monday with those leaders and also the Polish president in Paris to discuss what has been described as security guarantees for Ukraine. 
 
How aligned are these leaders when it comes to security guarantees? And how are security guarantees defined? I mean, you know, this message that security guarantees will be given to Ukraine. How has that been received by other NATO leaders? What are the implications?
 
POTHIER: Well, personally, I've been working on this question with President Zelenskyy's team for the past year, and we've created what we call the Kyiv Security Compact, which was presented by Anders Fogh Rasmussen and Andrii Yermak, the head of President Zelenskyy's office. 
 
And this is what's on the table right now, what is being discussed between the G7 leaders and some other countries like Poland, essentially security guarantees about saying two things. 
 
One, we are going to support Ukraine's right to self-defense under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter. And we're going to give Ukraine everything it needs to defend its territorial population, which is essentially what we've been doing for the past year, but somehow to codify the support in an open ended way. 
 <br>[02:25:18]
 
The second thing that security guarantee should be about is about being a bridge between now and NATO membership, the same thing that has been done with Finland and Sweden, where some countries, including the United States, gave some bilateral guarantees to those countries between the moment they were signaling their intention to join NATO and the moment they were effectively part of NATO and under the NATO umbrella.
 
HARRAK: In a few words, if you can, Fabrice, I mean, that begs the question, of course, are security guarantees a viable alternative to NATO membership? I mean, you know, can the Alliance protect Ukraine if it's not willing to fight for it?
 
POTHIER: It's a very good question. And, of course, Article 5, which is this collective defense clause is there is nothing better than that. But the question is, what's the next best thing? And we actually look at the U.S. Israel model where the U.S. has committed since 1979 to give a considerable amount of resources for Israel, to defend its territory and its interests, and it has proven to be pretty effective. 
 
So, obviously, Israel is different from Ukraine. But we think this is a good bridging solution, even though you're right that at the end, belonging to NATO is in the interest of Ukraine. It gives many more guarantees. But it's also gives us many more guarantees us NATO that Ukraine will be part of a broader framework. And it's actually -- and this is for Congress, this is actually cheaper for Ukraine to be part of NATO than us to have ad hoc security guarantees and keep up -- keep on sending weapons.
 
HARRAK: Fabrice Pothier talking to us from Spain, thank you so much.
 
POTHIER: Thank you very much.
 
HARRAK: Donald Trump is now facing serious federal charges in the Mar- a-Lago documents case and he's -- and he's repeated denials of any wrongdoing won't make them go away. 
 
Coming up, we'll tell you what some of his fellow Republicans are now saying.
 
Also ahead, relief is on the way, following a week that saw some of the worst air quality in decades. North America may be getting a break from the historic wildfires this weekend. Details up next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HARRAK: Four months we've had only a general idea of the potential criminal charges that might be pursued in the classified documents case against Donald Trump. 
 <br>[02:30:00]
 
Well, now we know and it's extremely serious. The federal indictment unsealed on Friday reveal some of the most serious charges the U.S. government can bring against a citizen. Of the 37 counts against Trump, 31 are related to the Espionage Act because of their potential threat to national security and the penalties if convicted can be severe. 
 
The indictment alleges Trump knew he wasn't supposed to have the materials that he stashed them carelessly throughout his Florida property and that he obstructed government efforts to get them back. 
 
Well, Trump continues to insist he has done nothing wrong and is only being prosecuted for political reasons. Many of his most loyal supporters in Congress are rallying to his defense but other Republicans are taking a wait and see attitude. 
 
Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski posted this on Twitter. Every American is innocent until proven guilty. Still, the charges in this case are quite serious and cannot be casually dismissed. 
 
Anyone found guilty whether an analyst, a former president or another elected or appointed official should face the same set of consequences. 
 
We get now more from CNN's Melanie Zanona in Washington.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MELANIE ZANONA, CNN CAPITOL HILL REPORTER: What Republicans have been racing to defend former President Donald Trump even before the indictment was unsealed. 
 
Speaker Kevin McCarthy on Thursday put out a statement calling the charges unconscionable, saying that this is a dark day for America. And vowing accountability for the Department of Justice, whether that's in the form of investigating the investigators or potentially targeting DOJ in upcoming spending bills.
 
But Kevin McCarthy still has yet to address the substance of the charges, including the fact that Donald Trump allegedly refused to turn over classified documents and obstructed justice. Take a listen to what else Kevin McCarthy told Fox News.
 
REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY, (R) HOUSE SPEAKER: This is a very dark day in America when you think about what they're trying to indict President Trump on, I think Jim Jordan is going to bring it out tonight. That when you learn of some of the things that he had said of how this investigation was carried out, you'll see then that this judgment is wrong by this DOJ, that they treated President Trump differently than they treat others. And it didn't have to be this way.
 
ZANONA: Now, what Kevin McCarthy was referring to there is a letter from the House Judiciary Committee to the Attorney General Merrick Garland, which was sent on Friday. 
 
And in the letter, Republicans are seeking new information about the search on Mar-a-Lago for classified documents. And they also revealed in the letter that Chairman Jordan conducted a transcribed interview with a former FBI official, which Jordan says raises new questions and concerns about that search on Mar-a-Lago.
 
So, this really is just the opening salvo in the House GOP's efforts to defend Donald Trump. But it is a slightly different story in the Senate. 
 
Over there, you have Mitch McConnell and John Thune, the number one and number two Senate Republicans, respectively, and they have been silent so far. 
 
Both men, of course, have not made any secret of their distaste for the former president. But this divide between House and Senate GOP leaders really speaks to the broader divide in the GOP about Donald Trump and whether he should be the presidential nominee. And that divide likely only to grow deeper in the weeks and months ahead.

HARRAK: Boris Johnson, the embattled former British Prime Minister says he's had enough of Parliament and is stepping down effective immediately. That of course triggers a by election for his seat.
 
While quitting is out of character for Johnson whose weathered countless political battles over his long and colorful career. But partygate ultimately proved to be too much. He has denied lying to Parliament about the illegal parties at Number 10 during lockdowns, but admits his explanations were misleading. 
 
In a blistering statement announcing his resignation, Johnson slammed the latest House of Commons investigation into the scandal, calling it a witch hunt to force him from Parliament.
 
Johnson claimed the not yet released report is riddled with inaccuracies but under their absurd and unjust process, I have no formal ability to challenge anything they say. 
 
A 24-hour ceasefire in Sudan is now underway brokered by the United States and Saudi Arabia. A statement from the Saudi foreign ministry says the two warring factions in the country agree to allow for the movement of humanitarian aid. The Sudanese Armed Forces emphasized their commitment to the ceasefire, while also saying that they reserve the right to respond to any rebel violation. 
 
Saudi Arabia and the U.S. have warned that mediation talks will be postponed if this latest pause in fighting is violated. The previous ceasefires have all failed to stem the violence. 
 
Tens -- in Serbia, tens of thousands of people gathered in front of the parliament building in Belgrade on Friday to protest against violence. 
 <br>[02:35:03]
 
Well, this is the sixth weekly protest since the beginning of May when the country was rocked by two mass shootings that left 18 people dead. Protesters blamed the deaths on a culture of violence. They're demanding that the interior minister and the intelligence agency director be dismissed. And they want the broadcasting licenses of television stations that promote violence to be revoked. 
 
Cuba has agreed to let China build a spying facility on the island that could allow Beijing to eavesdrop on some U.S. communications. That's according to a source familiar with the intelligence. But officials from both countries as well as the United States are pushing back on that report. As Patrick Oppmann tells us now from Havana.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: U.S., Cuban and Chinese officials are casting doubt or outright denying reports that Cuba and China have reached a secret deal that allowed China to set up a spy base on this island. 
 
Sources have told CNN and other media outlets so that a deal has been struck, that China has been very interested in putting some kind of facility or base in Cuba that would allow them to essentially collect data.
 
The signals intelligence has called from the United States allows China to spy on the U.S. from Cuban territory. 
 
The U.S. officials have -- U.S. officials have called this report inaccurate, China as well as cast out on them and Cuban officials on Thursday came out and in the news conference said that the reports were lies.
 
CARLOS FERNANDEZ DE COSSIO, DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER OF CUBA: Policies promoted with a malicious intention to justify the unprecedented reinforcement of the economic blockade, destabilization and the aggression against Cuba, and to deceive public opinion in the United States and around the world.
 
OPPMANN: Of course, throughout much of the Cold War, the Soviet Union did maintain a spy base just outside where I am in Havana. I've actually visited the ruins of that base, it is now abandoned, but during its heyday at the Lourdes a spy base, there were hundreds if not thousands of Soviet engineers and operated what really was like a small city that had the sole purpose of collecting any kind of data it could from the U.S. 
 
Of course, technology has changed and experts tell me that you would need a much smaller base or facility if China were interested in using Cuba as a base. 
 
At this point, though, Sources tell CNN there is no indications or evidence that China has set up a facility or base at least not yet.

HARRAK: The worst seems to be over for parts of the Northeastern U.S. which had been blanketed by heavy smoke from wildfires in Canada. 
 
At one point, it got so bad it could be seen from space. 
 
Earlier in the week, air pollution in New York was the worst it had been in generations. In Washington, even the monuments were obscured by the heavy haze. 
 
But weather patterns are now pushing the smoke into the Atlantic. Fires however are continuing to burn in other parts of Canada. 
 
Paula Newton reports now from Ottawa.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PAULA NEWTON, CNN ANCHOR: Canadian officials say that there are fewer fires burning now than there were earlier this week. 
 
Having said that, you have to keep in mind there are fires burning right across this country, from the west to the east. It is on track already to be the second worst fire season ever in this country, and it will likely be surpassed given the fact that this is still early in that wildfire season.
 
Now, having said all of this, what is going to help the most is some cooler, wetter weather moving through some critical regions like Quebec hopefully in the next few days. 
 
This will continue to be a problem, though, and I want you to see why. Have a look at this map. This is Canada. In fact, North America, that includes Alaska, the boreal zone. It includes millions of hectares of boreal forest. Those places have been susceptible to more wildfires given climate change. It's not a clear pattern. It is incredibly complex. But the fact remains that there have been more wildfires and they emit carbon of their own that also adds to the climate crisis.
 
Given what you see there, officials in the United States and Canada are trying to see if they can come up with some kind of joint fire management system that includes better ways to try and manage wildfires in the future. And also, obviously, trying to pool resources, trying to really not just prevent the fires, but when they see hotspots, get on top of it right away. 
 
Having said that, officials say to prepare for what unfortunately will be a very severe wildfire season in the months to come.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:44:17] HARRAK: A not guilty plea was entered in U.S. Federal Court on Friday for Joran van der Sloot, the Dutch national accused of alleged extortion of Natalee Holloway's mother. Holloway was an American teen who disappeared during a high school graduation trip to Aruba in 2005. 
 
Van der Sloot was one of the last people seen with her before she vanished. Jean Casarez has details now from courts in Alabama.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JEAN CASAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): 18 years after Natalee Holloway disappeared, the prime suspect, Joran van der Sloot, appears for the first time in a U.S. federal court. Handcuffed wearing jeans and a white t-shirt, the Dutch national faces a magistrate judge in Birmingham, Alabama, Holloway's hometown. Her parents, Beth and Dave, along with her brother Matt, staring at van der Sloot, watching him intensely supported by close friends.
 <br>[02:45:16]
 
CASAREZ: Why was it so important to be here today?
 
CAROL STANDIFER, CLOSE FRIEND OF BETH HOLLOWAY: Well, we just wanted to be here to support Beth, and we're just very happy to see Joran on Alabama soil, and it just gives us a bit of closure.
 
CASAREZ (voice-over): The judge telling van der Sloot there is a felony indictment pending against you with the charges of extortion and wire fraud. You have the right to remain silent. Do you understand? Yes, sir, the defendant replied. A not guilty plea was then entered on his behalf. 
 
Natalee Holloway disappeared in 2005 on her high school graduation trip to Aruba. She was last seen with van der Sloot and has since been declared legally dead.
 
CASAREZ: Are you hopeful that some truth may come out?
 
GEORGE PATRIOT SEYMORE, HOLLOWAY FAMILY SPOKESPERSON: We're hopeful. We're here. We never gave up hope that this day would be possible.
 
CASAREZ (voice-over): Yet, van der Sloot is charged not for killing Natalee Holloway, but for allegedly extorting tens of thousands of dollars from her mother. 
 
According to the indictment, van der Sloot claimed to reveal where her daughter's body was buried in exchange for a quarter million dollars. But after getting initial payments of 25,000, he fled to Peru and e- mailed saying he lied. 
 
I am confident that today was an important step toward accountability and hopefully justice, her father said in a statement. I am trusting that this prosecution will lead us to the truth about Natalee.
 
CASAREZ: Anything you want to say, Beth?
 
BETH HOLLOWAY, NATALEE'S MOTHER: Just thank you for your continued support. It's greatly appreciated.
 
CASAREZ (voice-over): After court, Natalee's mother Beth, said little publicly. Her spokesperson says she is nervous but strong.
 
SEYMORE: She's held up so firm over all of these years. The family, they're just excited that the process is underway.
 
CASAREZ (voice-over): Van der Sloot was convicted of killing another woman, Stephany Flores, shortly after arriving in Peru in 2010, and is serving a 28-year sentence there. 
 
Under an extradition treaty, van der Sloot was temporarily transferred to Alabama on an FBI plane to face the U.S. charges. Now represented by the area's chief federal public defender, van der Sloot will have to decide what happens next.
 
CRAIG MELVIN, NBC NEWS ANCHOR: Is there a universe in which we ever find Natalee Holloway's remains, her body?
 
JOHN Q. KELLY, BETH HOLLOWAY'S ATTORNEY: That universe is between van der Sloot's ears. He's the one that's going to have to decide at some point whether he wants to cooperate or not. Take a breath of fresh air outside of prison.
 
CASAREZ: When van der Sloot entered the courtroom, he was taller than anyone around him, very stocky, extremely muscular. He was so focused on walking to the defense table, the chair was pulled out. He angled himself so he could sit down. He never looked at the gallery. Natalee's mother Beth, was right in front of me. Her legs were crossed. Her hands were folded. She was watching his every move.
 
Now, originally, there was going to be a Dutch interpreter for Joran, but then he then just said to in court, my English is actually perfect. I really don't think it's necessary, the hearing proceeded. 
 
When I first got here to Birmingham, I went to Mountain Brook, which is the suburb that Natalee was born and raised in. The people there tell me they want justice for Natalee's family, and they believe that court here in Birmingham may be the first step.

HARRAK: An Idaho judge is set to make a decision at a later date about a gag order in place in the state's murder case against Bryan Kohberger. Kohberger is accused of stabbing four Idaho college students to death in November. A media coalition argued the gag order be removed as it is vague, overbroad, unduly restrictive and not narrowly drawn. 
 
In Friday hearing, both the defense attorneys and prosecutors had witnesses testifying on the potential harm of lifting the order. 
 
The judge didn't give a timeline on when he would make the decision.

HARRAK: In the day ahead, football history could be made at the Champions League final, Manchester City will try to win the competition for the first time and complete a rare treble. But standing in the way is three time European Champions League winners Inter Milan. 
 
CNN's Amanda Davies has a preview of the match with former champion Steven Gerrard.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
AMANDA DAVIES, CNN WORLD SPORT: I am getting tingles, standing here, thinking back about that night, but what does it feel to you?
 
STEVEN GERRARD, 2005 UEFA Champions League WINNER: Well, very similar. The hairs on me stood up when I first walked in the stadium, it feels extremely special to be back here. It's the first time I've been back since 2005. The best night in my life in terms of, you know, football and career.
 
So, to be here now, to enjoy again another special occasion, Man City and Inter Milan, I'm really looking forward to the game.
 
DAVIES: And so, that's a fair amount for the two sides tomorrow to live up to. I mean, what are you expecting from Man City against Inter Milan?
 
GERRARD: Well, I think Inter have got the same dream as we are as Liverpool, massive underdogs, less pressure, but huge opportunity to go and be champions of Europe. I think City will have learned the lessons from previous years. I think they're in the zone, the focus, they're in the form of the lives. They've got the best manager on the planet at the moment, form wise as well. 
 
So, I think it's there for City to go and deliver and take, but I don't think it'll be easy. I think they'll find a pragmatic opposition, a stubborn opposition who deserve respect as well. And it'll be a warm night in here, you know, I've experienced it. There won't be much air.
 
I don't think we'll get a three-three extra time of penalties. I hope -- I hope we get it for myself, yourself and the viewers, but I think we'll get a City win, but I think it'll be in difficult circumstances.
 
DAVIES: And the midfield is where you created so much of your magic as a player, very much being talked about as a key area tomorrow. What do Inter need to do to try and stop City?
 
GERRARD: I think team selection is important. With all due respect to Mkhitaryan, I think they'll go with Brozovic (PH). I think he needs to play. He's more controlled in terms of control and space. He's more aggressive out of possession. So, I think Inter will go more pragmatic. 
 
They have to get up and get close to Gundogan, to Rodri and de Bruyne, because them three players are the best midfield partnership in world football right now. They can hit you at any given moment. They complement each -- complement each other so well. If Inter don't get close and get tight and nullify space and nullify City threats. I think Inter could be in big trouble. 
 
DAVIES: So much talk, of course for City, it's not just about winning the Champions League for the first time, but winning that European treble.
 
GERRARD: Well, they deserve it. They deserve it. And I've obviously been a huge rival of City for many years, but out of respect, I think you have to pay compliments to the players individually, to the management, to the staff of the club, they've gone and delivered so far. This is the last piece and I expect them to do it because they're a fantastic team. 
 
And if they do it, they deserve every accolade, every bit of praise that's going to come their way. And if they are compared to the Ninety Nine team, the United and any other team on the planet, they deserve all an accolade.
 
DAVIES: And there's been such a debate, hasn't there, that you have to win this trophy, the Champions League, to be considered a great team?
 <br>[02:55:04]
 
GERRARD: People said that to me about the Premier League. Listen, the media and the outside opinion of you will always be like that, what you haven't got or you haven't done. People will always point fingers and accuse and that's football, that's the world we live in. 
 
This is a special team. Whatever happens to City, they will remember that being one of the best team that's ever been, best manager, world class players. That's the respect I've got for this City team. But if they don't tip this box, I'm not sure many fingers from a negative point of view can come their way.
