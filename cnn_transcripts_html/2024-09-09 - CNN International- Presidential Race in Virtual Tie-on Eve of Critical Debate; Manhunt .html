(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BECKY ANDERSON, CNN HOST, CONNECT THE WORLD: This is the scene on Capitol Hill where Republicans and Democrats are releasing dueling reports on the 
 
 Afghanistan withdrawal in 2021. It's 09:00 a.m. there in Washington, it's 05:00 p.m. here in Abu Dhabi. I'm Becky Anderson, you're watching, "Connect 
 
 the World" and you are most welcome. 
 
The great debate is now just a day away. What both candidates have to overcome to win the head-to-head matchup? The search for a man suspected of 
 
 shooting an interstate on an interstate in Kentucky stretches into its third day. We have the latest details on that investigation. And a wildfire 
 
 continues to rage in California, threatening thousands of structures, forcing evacuations and prompting a state of emergency.
 
And the stock market in New York will open about 30 minutes from now. It looks like a positive start according to the futures, at least of the week 
 
 after Friday's losses. Tech stocks in focus today, especially Apple, which is about to unveil its iPhone 16 more on those markets as they open at the 
 
 bottom of the hour. 
 
Well, exactly 36 hours from right now, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will face off in what is arguably the most consequential moment in a 
 
 presidential race full of unprecedented twists and turns. Their debate on Tuesday night will be their first ever face-to-face encounter, happening 
 
 just days before early voting starts in some states. Just how critical is it? 
 
Well, a new CNN Poll of Polls shows the Democratic Presidential Candidates locked in a statistical tie. And the debate is being held in Philadelphia, 
 
 which is the largest city in Pennsylvania, a battleground state that some analysts believe will ultimately decide the presidential winner in 
 
 November. You see here Pennsylvania, deadlocked in that latest polling.
 
As we count down the hours the candidate's activities leading into the debate offer a telling view into their drastically different campaign 
 
 styles. Harris has been spending the past few days in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania's second largest city, campaigning and practicing with her 
 
 staff. 
 
Trump, meanwhile, is still airing grievances over his 2020 loss to Joe Biden, and threatening on his Truth Social website to imprison any election 
 
 officials who, in his words, cheat in counting this year's results. Well, there's a lot to discuss here. 
 
Elaine Kamarck is a CNN Contributor and Senior Fellow at Brookings. Rina Shah is a Republican Strategist. Welcome to both of you. First of all, 
 
 let's hear from the candidates themselves.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We're run by stupid people. Stupid, stupid people. And we found that out at 
 
 the debate with Joe. How did that work out? And we're going to find it out again on Tuesday night. Is anybody going to be watching?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are you ready to face Donald Trump?
 
KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S., (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Yes, I am.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, they both seem ready to go. How have they been prepping? And how do you -- how do they look to you both? Rina, you first. 
 
RINA SHAH, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Becky, this is the Trump we know. And so far, what we've seen from him as we approach this really consequential 
 
 debate is his desire to come across angrier and more unbuttoned, because he realizes that's what gets him the adoration that he long has loved, and he 
 
 thrives off of that.
 
So going into such again, a time and a night that is going to determine the future of this race. He knows he has to really try everything, and the 
 
 everything means going back to his old ways while also peppering with something new. 
 
So, I'm not at all surprised to see his behavior recently, but I do know that he's going to have to inject a great deal more policy than he ever has 
 
 before in order to come across as looking far more presidential than he did in his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic back in the approach to 2020's 
 
 election. 
 
ANDERSON: Elaine, how is Harris looking to you at this point?
 <br>[09:05:00]
 
ELAINE KAMARCK, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Well, she's looking very confident. She has spent the weekend in Pittsburgh studying issues and trying to get her 
 
 lines ready for this debate. Debating Donald Trump is really hard, because you never know what on earth he's going to say?
 
And if he's going to bring something completely out of the blue, his behavior on the campaign trail is completely unhinged from time to time. He 
 
 talks about things that you have no idea why he's talking about them or even what he's referring to. 
 
So, I think Kamala Harris has two jobs. One is to present herself as capable of leading, and the second is to make sure that people understand 
 
 that Donald Trump's head isn't exactly screwed on straight.
 
ANDERSON: This is fascinating, isn't it? We are, of course, at a pivotal moment in the election itself, early voting will be underway soon, and 
 
 Donald Trump posted this weekend, vowing quote, when I win, those people that cheated will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law, those 
 
 involved will be caught and prosecuted at levels unfortunately never seen before in our country. 
 
Promising prosecution for voter fraud is fair, but there's no evidence, of course, that it happens in the United States. So, this sounds just like a 
 
 threat to election workers. How is that playing out in the United States Rina? 
 
SHAH: This authoritarian, unmasked business that Trump is engaged in, and has been engaged in, let's be clear, for four years, doesn't sit well with 
 
 so many centers right folks, folks who are moderate and still may consider themselves registered Republicans, but opposed to Trump and Trumpism. 
 
So, he's got to take that into consideration. But he again continues to double down with that rhetoric that he thinks resonates with folks who are 
 
 frustrated by what they believe is a Washington that doesn't reflect them. What they believe is a deep state that exists to get rid of folks like 
 
 Trump, and so he's speaking to them more than anything. 
 
But what I'm most concerned about, and I think most average Americans need to wake up to, is that Trump and his people for years have been working the 
 
 legal system, and they've been also working at the local grassroots level. In Georgia, for example, there are his loyalists embedded in commissions to 
 
 do his bidding. 
 
And so, I think if this race is close, this is something I've been saying privately for a long time to friends, if this race is close, my worry is 
 
 that this gets kicked to the court, and it gets determined in Trump's favor because of the many years that Trump has had to have his loyalists drilled 
 
 down into the system. And essentially what he believes is right for him and what he believes has been stolen from him.
 
ANDERSON: And this is so resonant and so important at the moment to both of you. Elaine, I'm going to get you to pick up here. "The New York Times" and 
 
 Sienna College have come out with a new poll, and we must always take polls with a grain of salt, of course, especially polls of total national voters. 
 
But this one just underscores what a knife's edge this race is on. But if you look at this specific number, 28 percent of voters say they need more 
 
 information on Harris, only 9 percent say they need more information on Trump. So, to the point that Rina was making earlier, and the fact that 
 
 this is the sort of comments that we've been hearing from Donald Trump. Will Harris be able to cut through the noise of tomorrow's debate? And you 
 
 pointed out that it's there, and reintroduce herself.
 
KAMARCK: Well, that's -- that is her challenge. She has to reintroduce herself because, after all, Donald Trump is a known quantity in among 
 
 politicos for many years now, there's been a debate on, what is Trump ceiling? You know, is it 45 percent is it 47 percent no one really thinks 
 
 it's 50 percent of the popular vote. 
 
But as Rina pointed out, this is a state-by-state election, and there are a lot of people in some of those states who are willing to go to bat for 
 
 Donald Trump, even if he loses. And that, of course, is going to be the issue here. Will Donald Trump be able to litigate his way out of a loss, 
 
 which is what he's preparing to do clearly, or will the courts ultimately be with him? 
 
Now I will remind everyone that in 2020 the Trump campaign filed 62 lawsuits, and they lost 61 lawsuits. So as this moves up through the legal 
 
 system, OK, Donald Trump has more and more trouble.
 <br>[09:10:00]
 
ANDERSON: Not before the election. Though, at this point, it seems. I do want our viewers to hear a new political ad from the Harris campaign. Both 
 
 of you have a listen to this. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: His National Security Adviser.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Donald Trump will cause a lot of damage. The only thing he cares about is Donald Trump.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And the nation's highest ranking military officer. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We don't take an oath to a king or a queen or a tyrant or a dictator, and we don't take an oath to a wannabe dictator. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Take it from the people who knew him best. Donald Trump is a danger to our troops and our democracy. We can't let him lead our 
 
 country again. 
 
HARRIS: I'm Kamala Harris, and I approve this message. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Rina, two of many former Trump allies there in that ad. I wonder, firstly to you, is this an effective argument against Donald Trump? Is it 
 
 pitched correctly and at the right audience?
 
SHAH: Well, the audience is correct, but the messaging, I think, could be a little bit broader. Look, I'm one of those people that's been fighting 
 
 against Trumpism for eight years now. And it's never been easy, because it's almost as if we're working with a moving target here. 
 
And I realize that sounds bizarre to some folks, but you know, there was a sense in political circles in Washington for the longest time that this man 
 
 has to be defeated simply on his face alone, he's not unappealing. But what we've realized, and what we ought to be clear about here is how much this 
 
 election is about a feeling, a feeling of where the country is going. 
 
And so, though you have great folks coming out and doing that brave act of saying, I worked for this man, he's a danger to the future of our republic, 
 
 it is helpful, but it's not enough. It has to be part of a multi-pronged strategy. So, I do commend the Harris campaign for trying it on for size 
 
 and promulgating this message. It's important. 
 
But look, at the end of the day we know she's running a very condensed campaign here. Our timeline is so short, so she's got to try it all. But I 
 
 will make this last point here, and I think it's been said before, but it bears repeating. There's a reason J.D. Vance is with Trump on this ticket, 
 
 and Mike Pence is not. Mike Pence would not run again with this man. And that should tell everybody everything they need to know about Donald J. 
 
 Trump.
 
KAMARCK: That's right. 
 
ANDERSON: Elaine, briefly effective. 
 
KAMARCK: Yes, look I think the most important thing, I'll say it very quickly, is that there's a handful of Republicans out there. They voted for 
 
 Nikki Haley. They didn't vote for Donald Trump. There's a handful of Republicans out there who I think Kamala Harris can get to vote for her.
 
So, ads like this, plus all the Republican endorsements over the weekend, like Liz Cheney and her father Dick Cheney, saying they would vote for 
 
 Harris, all of that is geared towards a very small number of people. But as you pointed out, on a race that's razor thin, that's all you need is a 
 
 small number. 
 
ANDERSON: Kamala Harris and Donald Trump head-to-head, 36 hours from now, and tune in for that special coverage of ABC News Presidential Debate 
 
 simulcast here on CNN. It will air this Tuesday at 09:00 p.m. Eastern Time, and we'll replay that debate on Wednesday at 02:00 a.m. Eastern that is 
 
 07:00 a.m. in London, and again, 02:00 p.m. Eastern, Wednesday, 07:00 p.m. London, 10:00 p.m. here in Abu Dhabi.
 
Well, a manhunt for a suspect accused of opening fire on an interstate highway in central Kentucky in the States, has entered a third day. Police 
 
 say Joseph Couch fired a semi-automatic rifle at 12 vehicles on Saturday, injuring five people near the town of London. 
 
Authorities say he was perched on a cliff along the side of the highway when he opened fire. Classes canceled for students across a swathe of 
 
 Central Kentucky, and residents are on high alert as officials desperately search the area. Well, CNN's Gloria Pazmino is following this for us, and 
 
 she joins us live. I mean, this is now hours in to what is a very frightening story and a live manhunt. What more can you tell us at this 
 
 point?
 
GLORIA PAZMINO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, Becky, we're on day three of this manhunt, and that means that this is a community in Kentucky that remains 
 
 on edge because they know there is a person out there who is armed and dangerous, who police have not been able to capture so far.
 
Police believe Joseph Couch is the man behind the shooting that took place on Saturday evening. You're seeing his picture there. He is 32-years-old. 
 
 He does have a military background. He served on the National Guard. 
 <br>[09:15:00]
 
And police have been focusing their attention in the area not far from where the shooting took place. Police say that couch opened fire onto the 
 
 highway, injuring five people.
 
People sustained critical injuries. Somehow, nobody was killed, which is a miracle, considering they believe he was using an AR 15 style weapon. That 
 
 weapon has also been recovered, along with a gun case that was inside the car. That's part of the reason police believe that this man is armed and 
 
 dangerous, and they are asking the community to stay vigilant.
 
Now the surge is entering its third day. And Becky, the reason for why this is taking so long is because the area that's being surged is a wooded, 
 
 rugged terrain, a lot of trees, a lot of cover, and that's making it very challenging for these law enforcement officers who are in there looking for 
 
 him.
 
It also means that when the sun comes down, they have to pull out of there because it is not safe for them. Take a listen to the Kentucky State Law 
 
 Enforcement Officers talking about what the community needs to be doing in this moment.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SCOTTIE PENNINGTON, KENTUCKY STATE POLICE SPOKESPERSON: You need to lock your doors. You need to -- if you have security cameras. Make sure you're 
 
 constantly watching them. Maybe keep your porch lights on. Have communication, have your cell phone and make sure your phones are charged 
 
 up, because you never know when you might have to contact somebody or law enforcement.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
PAZMINO: As you mentioned, Becky, the schools have been canceled across several districts this morning. So, the community still waiting for an 
 
 update to see if this man has been captured or if he can be found alive. Law enforcement have left the possibility open that perhaps Joseph Couch is 
 
 no longer alive.
 
Now important to remind people, just be aware of your surroundings. Law enforcement is out there several state and federal agencies working 
 
 together. They've been using a helicopter, drone technology, canines out in that wooded terrain to see if they can somehow locate him or determine if 
 
 he has left the area.
 
But it's going to be another day where officers are racing against the sun in the search for this suspect, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Good to have you with that roundup. Thank you. Israeli airstrikes killed at least 16 people in Central Syria on Sunday. According to Syria's 
 
 state-run news agency, dozens were injured in several explosions, and quote, air defense engagements in the -- countryside.
 
Meanwhile, Israel says it will open reopen a key border crossing into Jordan on Tuesday. Several crossings were closed after a Jordanian gunman 
 
 shot and killed three Israeli civilians at the Allenby crossing. On Sunday, the suspect's brothers, says he may have been motivated by anger over the 
 
 war in Gaza.
 
CNN's Matthew Chance joining us now from Tel Aviv in Israel. Let me start with what we know about the intended targets of those strikes in Syria. 
 
 Matthew.
 
MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, those strikes took place late last night local time, and we're talking about multiple 
 
 airstrikes on various locations. But according to eyewitnesses who spoke to CNN, one of the areas that was targeted was a military installation that 
 
 has previously been alleged to have been involved in chemical weapons production.
 
There's been no confirmation of that obviously, from the Syrians. And the Israelis are not commenting either on what exactly took place. But you 
 
 know, according to eyewitnesses, there were multiple strikes on -- throughout the evening on Sunday night local time. And you know, a number 
 
 of casualties have been reported as well.
 
At least 16 people dead and 36 injured, a number of them in critical condition. It's not clear how many of those people are civilians, how many 
 
 may have been military personnel, but certainly, the Syrian state news agency says it was military sites that were targeted in these apparently 
 
 Israeli airstrikes that took place in Syria again late last night local time, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Today is the third and final phase of the polio vaccination campaign in Gaza. Has that campaign been a success as far as the agencies 
 
 involved are concerned?
 
CHANCE: I think it has been, yes. I think despite the security problems you can imagine in the Gaza Strip with the sort of incessant Israeli attacks 
 
 that are taking place.
 <br>[09:20:00]
 
The Palestinian health authorities have been pretty effective in getting the polio vaccination out there, something like 450,000 children have so 
 
 far been vaccinated. But you have to remember that it's because of the poor health condition inside the Gaza strip that this was necessary in the first 
 
 place.
 
It was just last month that the first case of polio was found in Gaza, the first one for 25 years in a one-year-old baby that had been paralyzed by 
 
 the disease. And so yes, there has been some significant progress made by Palestinian health officials to get people, particularly children, 
 
 vaccinated. But obviously, the fact that that needed to be done at all is in itself, still pretty awful, pretty tragic.
 
ANDERSON: Good to have you there. Matthew Chance in Tel Aviv in Israel. Still to come folks, dueling reports by U.S. House Republicans and 
 
 Democrats on who is to blame for the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. We'll look at what stands out in each that after this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: Welcome back. You're watching "Connect the World" with me Becky Anderson. U.S. House Republicans and Democrats are releasing dueling 
 
 reports today on who is to blame for what was the deadly withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.
 
A time when the Taliban had taken over the Afghan capital, the Swift exit led to the deaths of 13 U.S. service members and left behind thousands of 
 
 Afghans who had helped the United States. The release comes during the final stretch of the U.S. presidential election. Of course, the Trump camp 
 
 looking to make the deadly withdrawal a key issue in the race.
 
Well, CNN has obtained copies of both reports. And Jennifer Hansler joins me now from Washington with more. So, what stands out, Jennifer?
 
JENNIFER HANSLER, CNN STATE DEPARTMENT REPORTER: Well, Becky, this more than 350-page report released by Republican Chairman Mike McCaul is really 
 
 blistering in its condemnations of the Biden Administration, they put the blame for that deadly withdrawal exclusively on the decisions made by the 
 
 President and his administration.
 
And they also aim to implicate Vice President Kamala Harris, saying that she worked in lockstep with the president on those final weeks on that 
 
 withdrawal plan. Of course, Harris is now the Democratic nominee for president. Now this report lays out 23 recommendations for what they say 
 
 needs to be accountability for that deadly withdrawal.
 
It is also making some pretty incendiary claims. It says that the Biden Administration misled or at times directly lied to the American people 
 
 about the withdrawal from the very beginning to what we saw at the end of August there and then the weeks following. Now, Becky, of course, the White 
 
 House has pushed back on those claims.
 
They say this report has cherry picked the facts and that this was sort of a predetermined thing because of what Trump agreed to.
 <br>[09:25:00]
 
They say the former president in starting this Doha agreement, making that deal with the Taliban put the Current U.S. President in an untenable 
 
 situation. Now, of course, Becky, this is not the first report to have been released on that withdrawal. We have seen a number of probes into those 
 
 final weeks of the U.S. Presidents after more than two decades on the ground there.
 
And what is notable here is the timing of it. This is coming, you know, in the heat of the U.S. presidential election season, just a day before that 
 
 presidential debate, as this issue has been thrust back into the forefront of the public eye here. McCaul said that timing was not intentional, that 
 
 he's looking for accountability, but the Democrats are saying this is absolutely tied to the U.S. presidential election, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Yeah, and you're right, and politics on both sides here. I just wonder very briefly whether Trump's attempt to make this a key issue in the 
 
 race somewhat backfired with what was the Arlington Cemetery fiasco recently.
 
HANSLER Yeah, absolutely, Becky, we did see a huge amount of blowback with that visit. We also saw sort of an unprecedented statement from the army, 
 
 sort of trying to show clarity on what happened there. There had been conflicting accounts of whether the Trump campaign sort of disregarded.
 
An Arlington official the army said that, in fact that had happened, there is a prohibition against political statements, political activities on 
 
 those hallowed grounds and the Trump campaign, they said did not listen there. They called that incident unfortunate. We have also seen outcry from 
 
 the military community, from veterans, saying that that was not OK for Trump to have undertaken that political campaign event there.
 
ANDERSON: Good to have you. Jennifer, always a pleasure. Thank you. And a quick up to speed for you, as it were, on some other stories that are on 
 
 our radar right now. And the mother of the suspected Apalachee high school shooter reportedly called to warm the school the day of the shooting.
 
According to family members, Marcee Gray made the call after receiving an alarming text from her son, Colt and then drove 200 miles to the school 
 
 herself. Pope Francis now on East Timor, the third stop of his 12-day tour of Southeast Asia. Pontiff was greeted earlier today by large crowds and 
 
 the country's president.
 
East Timor has steep ties the Catholic Church, about 97 percent of the population identify as Catholics. Still ahead. Firefighters struggle to get 
 
 wildfires in the Western United States under control, while thousands of people are forced out of their homes, one place so intense. It makes its 
 
 own weather.
 
And as this year's particularly eventful hurricane season rages on, a potential tropical storm building up in the Gulf of Mexico. More on that 
 
 after this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:30:00]
 
ANDERSON: Well, that's the sound of the opening bell as a new trading week is starting. It is 09:30 on the East Coast and in New York, of course. 
 
 Welcome back. I'm Becky Anderson in Abu Dhabi. You're watching "Connect the World" here on CNN. And let's see where those indices are headed on this 
 
 week full of tech news.
 
There's been a certain amount of correction amongst tech stocks, of course, after Nvidia took a tumble last week. Markets looking relatively healthy 
 
 out of the gate. Apple's highly anticipated annual hardware event kicks off later today. It's expected to introduce the first lineup of iPhones built 
 
 specifically for generative artificial intelligence.
 
The company unveiled its vision for its Apple intelligence AI system earlier this year, and it's looking to jumpstart sluggish iPhone sales. 
 
 Apple tease today's event with the cryptic motto, its glow time, but so far, has not said what it means. We are keeping an eye on a potential 
 
 tropical storm forming in the Gulf of Mexico, parts of Mexico and Southern Texas under tropical storm watch right now, with the disturbance expected 
 
 to turn into a fuller fledged storm in the coming days.
 
U.S. National Hurricane Center warns cities on the Coast of Louisiana and Texas could also see storm surge and hurricane watches as a result. Well, 
 
 perhaps understandably, the storm's potential impact could have an impact on oil prices because of those oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico that had 
 
 been putting pressure on oil prices.
 
Let's take a look now the potential for a hurricane to push crude futures slightly higher in earlier trading, and this comes after heavy losses in 
 
 crude prices last week, but those markets back down. WTI crude just around 68 on the barrel. Brent at 71 and change. Well record heat and strong winds 
 
 making a dangerous fire situation in the Western United States even worse.
 
More than a dozen wildfires burning California and Nevada. This blaze near Reno has forced several 1000 people to evacuate their homes, and most 
 
 schools have canceled classes for Monday, and the Line Fire, as it's known in Southern California, has now exploded in size over the past few days and 
 
 is threatening thousands of homes and businesses.
 
That's where we find our Camila Bernal, she is monitoring that l from San Bernardino in California. And we know this fire has gotten a lot more 
 
 intense and that it is as I understand it, creating its own clouds and weather. Just explain where things stand right now.
 
CAMILA BERNAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Becky, so this morning, we finally received some good news. There is some progress, 3 percent containment. 
 
 It's not too much, but we had been at 0 percent containment since this fire started on Thursday, and unfortunately, already about 20,000 acres of the 
 
 national forest here in San Bernardino look like what you see here behind me.
 
It's all gone. And so, officials saying there's a number of factors working against the firefighters. You mentioned the weather, it has been hot here 
 
 in Southern California. We've had three-digit temperatures, and then we've also had lows that are still very high. So, it's physically draining for 
 
 some of these firefighters.
 
And in addition to that, you have that weather that this fire is creating. And so, what that brought was thunderstorms. Those thunderstorms, yes, they 
 
 bring some water and some rain, but the problem there is that you also have lightning, so that starts new fires. And then the wind that comes with that 
 
 storm as well just moves the flames into areas that are essentially unpredictable for firefighters.
 
So, they do not know where to station the crews, because they don't know where the wind is going to blow the fire. It's also very steep terrain. You 
 
 see some of it here behind me, and so it's hard for firefighters to get to these areas. The problem is they either have to walk into these areas or 
 
 they have to be flown in. And they have had some problems getting aircraft in the air because of the conditions.
 
So, they were able to fly a bit over the weekend, and we'll have to wait and see what happens today. But in the meantime, you have thousands of 
 
 people that are under evacuation orders or under evacuation warnings that officials just telling people to be ready to go at a moment's notice. 
 
 Again, some of the schools in the area are closed, and so people being told just to be careful.
 <br>[09:35:00]
 
And so, in general, it has been difficult for these firefighters to make that progress. So, they declared a state of emergency, which means that 
 
 they were able to bring more resources into this area. That probably has a lot to do with that percentage increase. We now have about 1800 personnel 
 
 and firefighters that are on the ground, and they're hoping to make more progress today, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: It's good to have you. Thank you very much indeed. Apocalyptic scenes there. Well still to come, it was a simple traffic stop until this 
 
 Miami Dolphins star got handcuffed. Details after this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: Right with the "Connect the World" with me Becky Anderson. It is 37 minutes past 5 here in Abu Dhabi. Now fluctuations in the global oil 
 
 market and making the need for smarter energy solutions more pressing. Lead Dubai based companies working on sustainable additives to mix in with 
 
 fossil fuels to make them more efficient and cleaner. Have a look at this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice-over): What if the car you already own suddenly required less fuel. What if ships, planes and power generators around the 
 
 world polluted less. To many of us, this sounds like a dream. For entrepreneur Robert Mortimer, it's a day-to-day ambition.
 
ROBERT MORTIMER, FOUNDER &amp; CEO OF FUELRE4M: The Fuelre4m is a company that has an innovative new technology that optimizes fossil fuel and makes it 
 
 burn more efficiently, reducing fuel consumption and emissions.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice-over): Based in Dubai, the company says it uses vegetable oils to develop a mix that, when added to any liquid fossil fuel, 
 
 works on a molecular level, restructuring fuel particles. By reducing the size of fuel droplets, it allows them to burn more completely and 
 
 eliminates consumption emissions by at least 40 percent the company says.
 
MORTIMER: The one that's got performance in there, we're now going to agitate that, and you can see that it goes into millions and millions and 
 
 millions of smaller drops to allow them to atomize and finally find the oxygen to be able to combust more efficiently.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice-over): Fuelre4m claims that over 60 companies already using its technology in more than 5000 engines globally from 
 
 maritime.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So, what you can see here is all the vessels that are using Fuelre4m that --
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice-over): -- power production, this generator rental company has been using Fuelre4m's product to help power big events 
 
 for roughly a year.

VINCENT DAVIES, SERVICE MANAGER OF FLOW SOLUTIONS: We tried it out. We ran it on different base models of engines, our engines were running cooler. 
 
 The engine coolant temperature went down. We also saw that fuel emissions, it was decreased, and the fuel emissions --
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice-over): It's uncertain however, if this product will have the same consumer response as other solutions in the market, like 
 
 biofuels, which burn cleaner than petrol, or additives that boost performance.
 
KENNETH GILLINGHAM, PROFESSOR OF ENVIRONMENTAL &amp; ENERGY ECONOMICS AT YALE UNIVERSITY: Using an additive to improve the fuel economy. It goes back up 
 
 for many years now, and a big challenge is how to do it cost effectively.
 
For Robert, the ultimate goal is to mitigate emissions. While we progress towards greener sources.

ANDERSON: The part of our think big series. Well, SpaceX plans to start launching starships to Mars in two years. SpaceX Founder and CEO, Elon Musk 
 
 says the first ones will be crewless to test the safety of landing on Mars intact, if those go well. He says the first flights with a crew on board 
 
 will begin in four years from now.
 
Musk announced this timeline on X over the weekend. And more on that next hour here on "Connect the World". Well, a police officer who handcuffed 
 
 Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill, ahead of Sunday's game, is now on administrative leave. You can see Hill in this video lying on the ground 
 
 with police holding him down.
 
The team says he was pulled over for a traffic stop a block from the Dolphins stadium. So, what happened? What happened next? Amanda Davies with 
 
 us, Amanda.
 
AMANDA DAVIES, CNN WORLD SPORT: Yeah, Becky, you might remember, it was only four months ago in May, we were talking about golf Scottie Scheffler 
 
 being stopped on the way into the PGA Championship. A lot of similarities, a lot of differences being drawn in these two incidents and questions being 
 
 asked.
 
Questions being posed, particularly by how when we're talking about a minor traffic violation, as is being discussed here, somebody can end up face 
 
 down on the ground with a knee in their back, wearing handcuffs. Hill's teammates, some of them were driving past stopped, got involved Tyreek 
 
 Hill, asking what would have happened if I was not Tyreek Hill.
 
So, his agent has been speaking to us at CNN, legal options being considered, but remarkably, he took to the field, scored a touchdown, and 
 
 helped his side to victory just a short while afterwards. We've got all the all the questions, what happening next? Coming up in just a couple of 
 
 minutes on "World Sport".
 
ANDERSON: Wow! Yeah, the ultimate professional, my goodness. Amanda Davies, with "World Sport" up after this. We will be back with "Connect the World" 
 
 and our second hour following that, stay with us.
