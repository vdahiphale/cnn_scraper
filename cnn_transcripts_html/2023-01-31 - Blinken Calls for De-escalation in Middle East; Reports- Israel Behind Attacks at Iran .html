ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN ANCHOR:  Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us from all around the world. I'm Rosemary Church. Just ahead here on "CNN Newsroom," the strong relations in the Middle East. America's top diplomat urging calm and diplomacy in the final day of meetings with Israeli and Palestinian officials as tensions flare in the region.
 
Plus, scenes of devastation in Pakistan after a bomb ripped through a crowded mosque, leaving dozens of people dead. We will have a live report for Islamabad. 
 
And New Zealand braces for more thunderstorms and flooding as unprecedented rainfall continues to bring landslides and destruction.
 
UNKNOWN:  Live from CNN Center, this is "CNN Newsroom" with Rosemary Church.
 
CHURCH:  Thanks for being with us. In the coming hours, the U.S. secretary of state will meet with Palestinian authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, to try to help diffuse tensions between Israelis and Palestinians. This after Antony Blinken held talks with Israel's defense minister and its opposition leader just a short time ago. On Monday, he also met with the country's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.
 
At a joint news conference, Secretary Blinken reaffirmed Americas commitment to Israel as well as its support for a two-state solution with the Palestinians. He also called on both sides to de-escalate a wave of deadly violence in the region.
 
CNN's Nic Robertson has more on Secretary Blinken's visit.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR:  As soon as he got off the plane, one of the first things Secretary of State Antony Blinken did was to reassure the Israeli people that they have the ironclad security support and commitment from the United States. His mission, though, to reduce tensions with this ongoing spike in violence. He met first with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The pair discussing security but also discussing Iran. No mention of the overnight drone strike on an Iranian military factory. Israeli prime minister very clear on his views about Iran.
 
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAEL:  I can repeat again something that you've already said many times, our policy and my policy is to do everything within Israel's power to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them.
 
ROBERTSON:  And on the issue of improving relations with the Palestinians, the Israeli prime minister said that he believes the best way to do that was improving, enlarging the circle of peace, the Abraham Accords, Israel's growing and improving relations with Arab states in the region.
 
The secretary of state, however, saying that alone wasn't a substitute for actually direct engagement with the Palestinians, saying that the important and perhaps even a red line for the United States was the idea of keeping alive the possibility of a two-state solution. 
 
ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  We continue to believe that the best way to achieve it is through preserving and then realizing the vision of two states. As I said to the prime minister, anything that moves us away from that vision is, in our judgment, detrimental to Israel's long-term security and its long-term identity as a Jewish and democratic state.
 
ROBERTSON:  With that reference to Israel and democratic values, seemed to be the secretary of state hinting about his concerns about some of the decisions that Netanyahu's far-right government is taking at the moment, the possibility of expanding settlements, and the possibility of revoking Israeli citizenship rights for Palestinian families of Palestinian gunmen. That is an ongoing concern.
 
Tuesday, however, the secretary of state going to West Bank to visit with the Palestinian authority president, Mahmoud Abbas. Likely there, the message will be for the Palestinian authority to restart its security cooperation with Israel.
 
Nic Robertson, CNN, Jerusalem.

CHURCH:  Joining me now is Shibley Telhami, the Anwar Sadat Professor for Peace and Development at the University of Maryland. He's also a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Thank you, sir, for being with us.
 
SHIBLEY TELHAMI, ANWAR SADAT PROFESSOR FOR PEACE AND DEVELOPMENT, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND:  My pleasure. 
 
CHURCH:  So, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will meet with the Palestinian leadership in the coming hours. This after already meeting with Israel's prime minister, president, and foreign minister on Monday. [03:04:58]
 
CHURCH:  Now, he sent an urgent message to all sides to de-escalate the current spike in deadly violence. But when you look at this cycle of violence in the region, is that de-escalation achievable under the current circumstances?
 
TELHAMI:  Not only is it not achievable, but I think the focus on status quo and maintaining the status quo will only fuel the violence. And I think it mischaracterizes the reason for the violence. Of course, one reason is that you have a new Israeli government that is far-right that has made it clear how it would deal with the Palestinians in the West Bank under Israeli military control. And clearly, that is something that worries the administration in Washington.
 
CHURCH:  And during his first trip to the region, since Benjamin Netanyahu returned to power, Secretary Blinken emphasized that the most important thing is to keep alive the idea of a two-state solution. He added that any move away from that goal would show the world that Israel was losing some of its democratic values. How was that blunt message likely received by Mr. Netanyahu, do you think?
 
TELHAMI:  Well, of course, you know, for Mr. Netanyahu, that is not the issue. The question is, how it's going to be received on the ground? Because the Israeli government clearly has no intention of relinquishing control. They made that clear. The idea to keep the two- state solution open, most people don't think it's nowhere near possible in any foreseeable future.
 
And again, you know, you are talking about five and a half decades of military control, which by definition as violent. We only look at the violent actions that take place, that are visible, such as the horrible shootings that we see, Israeli actions in places like Jenin, and the horrible shooting in east Jerusalem.
 
All of these things, obviously, matter. The administration wants to maintain offset of escalation. I wouldn't say de-escalation because de-escalation means the end of violence. The Palestine is intrinsic to the structure of military control every single day. And so, the idea of just promising something that is not on the horizon, that is going to pacify people. I just don't think that works.
 
CHURCH:  Right. Of course, it is important to emphasize there is violence on both sides here. Secretary Blinken is calling for calm on all sides so that conditions are ripe to restore a sense of security to both Israelis and Palestinians. But what all do you expect he will actually achieve on this high-stakes visit to the Middle East? Is it just a first step in perhaps many?
 
TELHAMI:  Well, look, let us look at it in terms of from the point of view of administration. Obviously, the administration in some ways does not want anything to disrupt its other priorities.
 
First and foremost, of course, it is an effort in Ukraine. And anything that will disrupt that, especially through escalation, that might not only draw a wider conflict initially on the Palestinians, but also possibly spread into some parts of the Arab world. Obviously, they don't want that. Clearly, they want to try to find a way to keep the lid on that.
 
Number two, he obviously is worried about the proposed changes of Israeli legal system. That clearly would weaken the Israeli force and supreme court and give the Israeli government for more ability to act both -- under all the territories, including inside of Israel.
 
So, that worries a lot of Israelis. You see all the demonstrations by Israel. He is also worried about it. But also, minorities, Palestinians, citizens of Israel, as well as Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. Those are the sort of things that are on the secondary reason why, and I think that he's going to have a tough time with it.
 
CHURCH:  Shibley Telhami, thank you so much for joining us. Appreciate it.
 
TELHAMI:  My pleasure. 
 
CHURCH:  U.S. officials reportedly believe Israel is behind drone attacks on a military facility in Iran.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
(EXPLOSION)
 
CHURCH:  The reports came from "The Wall Street Journal" and "The New York Times," citing unnamed officials. A Pentagon spokesperson says the U.S. has not conducted strikes or operations inside Iran. The Tehran government displayed what it says are pieces of the drones.
 <br>[03:10:00]
 
CHURCH:  But the Israel defense forces have declined to comment.
 
More now from CNN's Salma Abdelaziz.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN REPORTER:  Questions and concerns after an attack over the weekend on a military facility in Iran. According to Iranian state media, on Saturday night, a military factory in the central Iranian city of Isfahan was attacked with three drones.
 
Again, according to the Iranian state media, one of those drones was shot down, the two others caught in the country's air defense systems and exploded.
 
Now, Iran has not accused any certain group or country of carrying out this attack. But a top official, the Iranian foreign minister, is calling it a cowardly act and saying it was part of efforts to incite insecurity in Iran. Now, separately, "The Wall Street Journal", "The New York Times" have spoken to U.S. officials, unnamed U.S. officials, that say Israel was behind the attack.
 
Now, in the past, Israel has been accused by Iran and others of carrying out these covert attacks against Iranian military sites in an effort to deter that country's nuclear program. To make clear, Israel has made no comment on this recent attack.
 
Now, separately, there was also a response from Ukraine. A top official, again, a Ukrainian presidential advisor in a tweet saying it was -- quote -- "an explosive night in Iran," going on to use the Ukrainian flag and saying, did warn you.
 
Now, it is important to note here that Ukraine has accused Iran and Ukraine's allies agree that Iran is providing drones to Russia, which are being used in Ukraine in Russia's invasion of that country and have caused, according to Ukrainian officials, again, civilian loss of life.
 
Now, all of this quite murky. Unclear who is behind the specific attack. But very much a part of a shadow war and a continuation of the increasing isolation of Iran. Over the course of the last few months, that country has been cracking down on a protest movement. The result of that has been that nuclear talks. Attempts to restart nuclear talks have all but faded away. No hope there.
 
More sanctions from the west. Iran increasingly turning to Moscow, helping to provide and replenish its arsenal for the war in Ukraine. And concerns and fears that the Middle East already in a very fragile place, that this could escalate tensions there.

CHURCH:  In Pakistan, the death toll is climbing after a deadly bombing in the north western city of Peshawar. Officials say at least 92 people were killed after a bomb ripped through a mosque located inside a police compound Monday.
 
It is still unclear who is behind the blast, but Pakistan's prime minister says terrorists wanted to create fear. Meanwhile, the United Nations is condemning the attack.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
STEPHANE DUJARRIC, U.N. SECRETARY GENERAL'S SPOKESPERSON:  It is particularly abhorrent that such an attack occurred at a place of worship. Freedom of religion, freedom of belief, and the ability to worship in peace is a fundamental human right.
 
Secretary general extends his heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims and wishes a prompt recovery to those injured, and he reiterates the solidarity of the United Nations and the government and people of Pakistan in their efforts to address terrorism and violent extremism.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH:  CNN's Ivan Watson has details of the attack.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Dazed worshippers pulling themselves up from the rubble. A deadly blast hit this mosque during afternoon prayers, partially collapsing the building. The suspected attack targeting a police compound in Pakistan's northwestern city of Peshawar. The victims likely mostly law enforcement, caught off guard in a place of worship. 
 
UNKNOWN (through translator):  We took out the injured and sent them to hospital. The dead bodies should all be inside the mosque buried under the rubble.
 
WATSON (voice-over):  Dozens are confirmed dead, Pakistani police say, with more than 150 injured. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned what he is calling a suicide blast, saying -- quote -- "The brutal killing of Muslims prostrating before Allah is against the teachings of the Quran. Terrorists want to create fear by targeting those who perform the duty of defending Pakistan."
 
Monday's blast was the worst the city has seen since March of last year when a suicide bombing that ISIS later claimed responsibility for killed at least 61 at a Shia mosque during Friday prayers.
 
Leaders of Pakistan's rival political parties condemned the latest mosque bombing. A country with a long history of deadly political violence now bracing for the threat of more possible suicide attacks.

CHURCH:  CNN Sophia Saifi joins us live from Islamabad now. Sophia, what more are you learning about this deadly blast?
 
SOPHIA SAIFI, CNN PRODUCER:  Rosemary, it has been a long night for the people of Peshawar. There have been funerals overnight because of this heavy death toll. There will be funerals throughout the day here in Pakistan in the city of Peshawar.
 
We've been getting conflicting claims from the Pakistani Taliban. There are certain factions, certain commanders within the Pakistani Taliban who have come out and claimed responsibility for this attack. But the proper whole organization, the official spokesperson of the TTP, the Tehrik-i- Taliban, which is the Pakistani Taliban, has denied responsibility behind this attack.
 
And this comes at a period of increased militancy over the past couple of weeks in Pakistan, not just in Peshawar, but across the north of this country, especially in the areas bordering Afghanistan. Pakistan has accused Afghan authorities, has accused the Afghan Taliban of harboring the Pakistani Taliban and providing them safe havens, for being able to be there and then come into Pakistani territory and commit these acts, according to Pakistani authorities.
 
Now, this increase in attacks has happened since November of last year when a cease-fire between the Pakistani Taliban and the Pakistani State (INAUDIBLE). We've also seen an increase in attacks since the summer of 2021 when the fall of (INAUDIBLE) happened. And an increase in attacks happened when the Pakistani Taliban regrouped.
 
Now, Pakistan has seen many, many years of militancy, of attacks like this on its soil. But over the past couple of years, there have been, since at least 2015, a period a relative calm. There have been operations by the military. That had been stopped and it had become a distant memory for many people, especially in the city of Peshawar where we have just seen many similar attacks.
 
But this high death toll is reminding people of this city and of this country that this is now back, the threat of terrorism is back again in Pakistan. We have to wait and see how the investigation by the Pakistani authorities unfolds. Rosemary?
 
CHURCH:  All right, Sophia Saifi, joining us live from Islamabad, many thanks.
 
Well, coming up next, as the fighting intensifies in eastern Ukraine, we will show you how drones are playing a critical role for Ukrainian troops on the front lines. Plus, the IMF issues a new forecast for the global economy. Why China could be responsible for a less gloomy outcome in 2023. Back with that and more in just a moment.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHURCH:  A Ukrainian commander did not mince words when describing the constant fierce fighting around the eastern city of Bakhmut, calling it a living hell.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
UNKNOWN: (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE).
 <br>[03:20:00]
 
CHURCH:  The commander told Ukrainian TV the country's troops are doing an incredible job as Russian forces try to take control of a key highway. He also said the Wagner mercenary group is almost completely destroyed and being replaced by Russian paratroopers who also suffer losses almost daily.
 
In the south, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was joined by the Danish prime minister during a visit to Mykolaiv region. Mr. Zelenskyy offered the stark assessment of what Russia wants now.
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translator):  I think Russia really wants its big revenge. I think it has already started.
 
CHURCH:  The Ukrainian president has been urging his western allies to supply Ukraine with fighter jets. But U.S. President Joe Biden made it clear where he stands on that issue.
 
UNKNOWN (voice-over):  Will the United States provide F-16s to Ukraine?
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  No.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHURCH:  Ukraine's defense minister says the country plans to spend about $545 million this year to purchase drones, which have played a key role on the battlefield.
 
CNN's Fred Pleitgen shows us how they are being used.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over):  Ukraine's entire eastern front is now heating up. This is Russian infantry in a massive fire fight in the forest near the town of Kreminna. Close by, we are creeping through the same force with the Ukrainian frontline drone unit Dnipro-1 and scouts out Russian positions and direct Ukrainian fire.
 
Drone operator (INAUDIBLE) says working in the forest is extremely dangerous.
 
UNKNOWN:  All time working attempts (ph), a lot of artillery from different directions, from east and from north.
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over):  But the team is often able to spot attempted Russian advances. Here, Russian infantry are moving through the thick woodland and this tank leaves cover and opens fire towards Ukrainian positions.
 
The Ukrainians liberated towns and villages in this area last autumn. But the scars of battle are visible everywhere.
 
(On camera):  This village, like many of the ones in this area, was heavily damaged when the Ukrainians moved in here in the fall. For a while, it was quiet. But now, all that is changing. The fighting is coming back and it's heavier than ever before.
 
(Voice-over):  The few people remaining, those two poorer or too old to flee. 
 
I asked Valentina if it's not too dangerous to stay here. Yes, it is dangerous, she says, but what can we do? Of course, it is dangerous. But we endure. Sometimes, we hide. But now, it's too cold in the basements.
 
The Russians have massively beefed up their forces around Kreminna. They believe that they have to prevent the Ukrainians breaking through here to sustain their own offensive against Bakhmut and are now also launching fresh attacks near Vuhledar further south.
 
This video near Vuhledar shows Russian armor getting hit by Ukraine's artillery. The soldiers run away. A wounded comrade tries to crawl to safety. In all of these places, drones are critical to detect and to destroy the enemy.
 
Dnipro-1 has its own drone workshop where NATO-issued grenades are literally sown and have to be carried on drones. Yuri (ph) can manufacture drone emissions in 20 minutes and they have proven very affective in the conflict. 
 
Drone operator is one of the most dangerous jobs, Devos (ph) says. As soon as they locate a drone operator, they use all kinds of weaponry, artillery, and tanks. We have a high rate of casualties among drone pilots.
 
In the forest, Ruslan's (ph) mission is now over. But he sees a long battle ahead in a contest of wits and brute force.
 
UNKNOWN:  Last month, our army (INAUDIBLE) two weeks maybe we stop and Russians making counterattack. 
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over):  And all the time drones will shape the way, this war changes.
 
Fred Pleitgen, CNN, (INAUDIBLE), Ukraine.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHURCH:  And CNN's Scott McLean is following developments for us. He joins us live from London. Good morning to you, Scott. So, what is the latest on fighting in and around Bakhmut?
 
SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  It is really interesting, Rosemary. Look, before the war, you would be hard-pressed to find just about anyone who would say that Bakhmut held any kind of strategic importance, and yet when it comes to war, that is exactly how both sides would likely describe it.
 
That is because it has been a brick wall essentially for the Russians who have tried for months and months to take this town in eastern Ukraine with really no success at all. Part of the reason why is because the Ukrainians have it so, so well fortified with their own defenses.
 <br>[03:25:02]
 
MCLEAN:  That is not the Ukrainian saying that, that is the head of the Wagner private mercenary group who said that a few weeks ago and said that the town also has lot natural defenses, sort of wooded areas, water, hills, valleys, things like that, that make it very difficult for the Russians to actually move in on.
 
And so, instead, it seems that they are resorting to very familiar tactics in this war and that is trying to encircle the town, making slow and steady process to the north and to the south. A Ukrainian commander in Bakhmut said that the Wagner private mercenary soldiers who have been used very much like cannon fodder in Bakhmut have been replaced by regular Russian paratroopers who are much more highly skilled, and even they are going all out, in his words, and that they are not even trying to take cover. So, the fighting here is extremely intense.
 
The routes that the Ukrainians still have in and out of the city are coming under fire from the Russians as of late. And so, there is no way for volunteers to get in and out and the civilians who are still there are essentially living in basements.
 
And quickly, Rosemary, we have been in touch with one Ukrainian soldier on the ground who said that the Ukrainian withdrawal from Bakhmut is likely to happen at some point. The question here is when. Another Ukrainian commander said that if the withdrawal actually does take place, it will be to preserve the lives of Ukrainian troops fighting there.
 
CHURCH:  And Scott, President Putin's former speechwriter says a military coup is becoming a real possibility in Russia. When more are you learning about this?
 
MCLEAN:  Yeah. So, this is a former speechwriter for President Putin. His name is Abbas Gallyamov. He now works as a political analyst outside of the country. He said that, look, if President Putin isn't having very much luck on the battlefield, that is going to cause problems for him at home.
 
He says that Putin is up for reelection in March of next year. As we get closer to that date, perhaps a year from now, if President Putin hasn't declared his candidacy for reelection, he may instead opt to cancel the elections altogether and declare some kind of martial law.
 
He also says that, look, if things aren't going well on the battlefield, if the economy is not going well, if more and more Russians are coming home in caskets rather than alive, then this might be something like the national psyche. Listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ABBAS GALLYAMOV, FORMER SPEECHWRITER OF VLADIMIR PUTIN:  Russians will be coming across more and more difficulties. And they will be trying to find explanation on why this is happening to us. And in these situations, they will be looking around into politics and to the political process. And they will be answering themselves. Well, this is because our country is governed by a tyrant, a dictator.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
PLEITGEN:  And at that point, Rosemary, that is when he says the possibility of a military coup or a coup of the Russian elites comes into play. It becomes a very real possibility. Of course, President Putin is well known for his strength. That is why Russian people have kept him around. But if he doesn't have that, then, frankly, the Russians don't need him anymore. Rosemary? CHURCH:  All right, Scott McLean with that report, joining us live from London, appreciate it.
 
New Zealand was already reeling from record rainfall and flooding. Now, residents are being told to brace for another storm. We will go live to Oakland, coming up.
 
Plus, a dire warning from the international Red Cross which says the world is dangerously unprepared for another pandemic.
 <br>[03:30:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHURCH:  Parts of New Zealand's North Island are reeling -- feeling, I should say, the impact of a new storm system. This, as the country tries to clean up from a record downpour last week. More thunder and rain are forecast through Wednesday. And as the new storm approaches, at least four people are reported dead after dangerous flooding and landslides.
 
Prime Minister Chris Hipkins calls this a one in 100-year weather event that he attributes to climate change.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHRIS HIPKINS, NEW ZEALAND PRIME MINISTER:  Climate change is real. It's with us. It's having an impact on our weather. We are seeing more o f these extreme weather events. We're going to have to deal with more extreme weather events in the near future. And we need to be prepared for that. And we need to do everything we can to combat the challenge of climate change.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH:  And for more on this story, I'm joined by Lucy Thomson in Auckland. She is a reporter for Newshub. Good to see you, Lucy. So, more heavy rain is expected on top of major flooding that's already saturated Auckland. What's the situation on the ground there right now? 
 
LUCY THOMSON, NEWSHUB REPORTER:  Yeah. Well, it just started raining here in Central Auckland again. It's been raining and off all day and there's a real sense of unease among people about what the next 24 hours is going to bring.
 
Of course, we've had record rainfall already. And frecasters predicting more heavy downfalls for Auckland and another parts of the upper north island over the coming days. So, a state of emergency is currently in place in Auckland and a state of emergency has also just been declared in Northland in anticipation of the weather, which is set to sit in in the next hour or so.
 
CHURCH:  So, Lucy, what damage has been done so far and how are people they're coping? THOMSON: Yeah. Well, experts say that we are going to be experiencing a lot more significant weather events like this. At the moment, Auckland just taking it day by day. Their main focus at the moment, as I say, is on this imminent weather system, which is heading our way as we speak. And of course, cleaning up the damage to homes that was caused by the significant event on Friday night. There's no doubt that the cost of the repair work is going to be in the millions. Roads are still cut off. Schools are still shut. And as I say, Rosemary, people are just taking it day by day.
 
CHURCH:  All right. Lucy Thompson, thanks for joining us live from Auckland. Appreciate it.
 
On this story, I'm joined by James Rencwick. He is a professor of physical geography at Victoria University of Wellington. Thank you, Professor, for joining us.
 
JAMES RENWICK, PROFESSOR OF PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY, VICTORIA UNIVERSITY OF WELLINGTON:  Hello and thank you for the invitation to speak.
 
CHURCH:  So, more heavy rain is forecasted and parts of New Zealand already dealing with major flooding and landslides after days of torrential rain. Prime Minister Hipkins says these floods are a result of climate change. Do you agree with this assessment? 
 
RENWICK: Well, I'm sure the intensity of the rainfall with floods is partly due to climate change. Climate change doesn't cause storms to hit and they've always have been going on. But a warmer climate has more moisture. So, you tend to het heavier rain when it falls.  So, in that sense, yes, climate change played a role for sure.
 
CHURCH:  And Prime Minister Hipkins also says that New Zealand needs to be prepared for more of these extreme weather events. You have written about this, saying one way to prepare is to adapt the country's stormwater drain system. What's the best way to do that? And should other nations be considering doing this too, do you think?
 
RENWICK:  Well, that is one part of the response. I think, if you don't have a big enough drains, then the water will run over the ground rather than be channeled away. But I think that there are other options as well. Just changing the nature of the landscape, I think this was seen -- I think it was in Houston or Dallas, with the big flooding there, those (inaudible) asphalt, the water couldn't have any way to go.
 <br>[03:35:07]
 
It was the same story in Auckland really. We don't have a lot of open space in the city. We could have exposed streams instead of streams in cohorts (ph). We could have wetlands, (inaudible) more trees planted, and it allows the rain when it falls on the ground to be soaked up more readily. And so, these all flows down the road.
 
So those kinds of urban planning responses are at least as important as the size of the drain. And I think we have to do all of these things because it's true that these heavier rains will only get heavier as the climate warms up. And we're going to see more of those kinds of grief (ph) and work (ph) around the country as time goes on.
 
CHURCH:  Yeah. It is an interesting concept, isn't it, because you talk about the fact that we should be preparing infrastructure for the next 50 years, and it needs to be working in with these extreme weather events.
 
RENWICK:  Well exactly. I think I see it that the storm water infrastructure that was built for the (inaudible) we had 50 years ago, we've already got a different climate and it will be different -- more different in 50 years from now.
 
So, yes, we need to be thinking about what the future will look like, and it's not going to look like in the past. So, if accounts or for instance, those digging up the drains for some reason, been putting in like a drain, it's a very sensible thing to do. And I know that some of the regional authorities are already doing this. We need to be consistent around the country and make sure that we are taking this kind of action when it makes sense and where it makes sense.
 
CHURCH:  And of course, as you have been speaking with, we have been looking at images from across Auckland, just extraordinary. Talk to us about the impact of these floods and landslides have had on New Zealand's largest city Auckland, and how people are dealing with this?
 
RENWICK:  Yeah, well, it was extraordinary. I mean, I was watching images on social media around Friday as this event unfolded, and I was amazed. I've never seen anything like it in any New Zealand city, I don't think. So, it was really remarkable.
 
And hundreds of houses were damaged, a lot of roads, infrastructure were damage, and I think this -- I don't know -- a few dozen the houses that are going to have to be pulled down and possibly rebuilt somewhere else. So, you know, even the international airport had to be closed because of water in the terminal and water on the runway or something. Again, I've never seen before. I've been through that airport many times, and it has never been a problem.
 
So, just the intensity of the rain really got on top of all the infrastructure. And it will be months, if not years, before some of the damages are repaired.
 
CHURCH:  And we're looking at people waving through this water. I mean, in some instances, it is up to people's shoulders. How long will it likely take for these waters to subside, to find another location? 
 
RENWICK:  Well, I'm not exactly sure, but I think a lot of the water has subsided, although as you say, there is another rain event happening in the Auckland region now and through tomorrow. So, there will be more water to drain away very soon. But I think it is just a question of time, and it has been a few days now since the big rainfall event last Friday. And I think a lot of the water has drained away. 
 
CHURCH:  All right. Professor James Renwich, in Wellington, many thanks for joining us, appreciate it.
 
RENWICK:  Sure.
 
CHURCH:  The global economy is looking slightly less gloomy this year than in previous forecasts, according to the International Monetary Fund. The IMF is now projecting nearly 3 percent growth in 2023, just a few percentage points higher than predicted last year. It's by no means a strong year of growth, but the new numbers show some promise.
 
The IMF says China's sudden reopening after scrapping its zero-COVID policies has paved the way for the rapid rebound, especially given the resilience of multiple countries in the second half of 2022. The IMF's director of research says a large demand for workers in some of the world's biggest economies is keeping numbers positive, no matter how small the growth may be.
 
CNN's Richard Quest asked him about the IMF's new forecast.

PIERRE-OLIVIER GOURINCHAS, ECONOMIC COUNSELOR AND DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH DEPARTMENT, IMF:  This year, 2023, and next year, we're going to have relatively low growth numbers to start with. So, this year in particular, 2.9 percent, this is not a super high number. But, you are right, that this has been revised upwards, and this is the first time in quite a while we've had sort of good news in that sense.
 <br>[03:39:54]
 
RICHARD QUEST, CNN HOST, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS:  Are you surprised that after so many interest rate hikes with such ferocity, and speed, that the economies are withstanding the shock of the monetary tightening? I mean, to have this level of tightening, and still be registering this sort of growth, is remarkable.
 
GOURINCHAS:  The economy has been very resilient, not just in the U.S., also in other parts of the world, including the European economies. Many of them have been quite resilient. And you are right. So, there has been this massive tightening. Now, why has it been so resilient?
 
Well, one point is, I've already mentioned, the labor market with coming out of the pandemic and the crisis of the last two years and there is an enormous demand for labor, and that some of that demand is not yet met in the U.S., for instance. We still have very elevated levels of vacancies. And then on top of that, households have accumulated a lot of savings through these last two years, thanks to policy and also thanks to, you know, precautionary behavior. And they are looking to spend some of that. So, that is supporting the economy.

CHURCH:  And you can see Richard Quest's full interview with the IMF's director of research later today on "Quest Means Business" at 8.00 p.m. in London, 3.00 p.m. in New York.
 
The White House says President Joe Biden plans to end the national and public health emergencies for COVID-19 on May 11th. Officials say the deadline is being extended one last time to give states, healthcare providers and patients enough time for an orderly transition.
 
The announcement came in response to a pair of bills from Republican lawmakers seeking to end the emergencies. They have given Americans access to free COVID tests, treatments, and vaccines as well as other benefits.
 
Well, meantime, the World Health Organization says COVID-19 is still a global health emergency. The group also admits the pandemic has reached a, quote, "transition point." The WHO's director general made the statement on Monday that a committee meeting about COVID-19, which will continue to be labeled a public health emergency of international concern. He says countries should continue to push vaccinations, and keep an eye on new infections as cases and COVID-related deaths continue to rise.

TEDROS ADHANOM GHEBREYESUS, DIRECTOR GENERAL, WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION:  The committee has advised me that in its view COVID-19 remains a
 
 global health emergency, and I agree. As we enter the fourth year of the pandemic, there is no doubt with in a far better situation now than we have -- we were a year ago.

CHURCH:  Now is the time for all countries to prepare for the next global pandemic, because the world isn't ready to face another one. That warning comes from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. It's calling for better preparedness at the community level, and urging countries to update their emergency plans by the end of the year.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JAGAN CHAPAGAIN, CEO AND SECRETARY GENERAL, IFRC: Most countries were unprepared for COVID-19. And today, many countries are still demand unprepared for any future outbreaks. There will be no excuse for the continued lack of preparedness after having gone through three terrible years. We know preparedness saves lives.

CHURCH:  Pope Francis has left the Vatican as he kicks off a trip to Africa. He is set to visit the Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan, two countries where Catholics make up nearly half of the population.
 
The pope used a cane and a wheelchair as he boarded a plane in Rome earlier. He's due in Kinchasa later today and his trip is set to last through Sunday.
 
Well, our next story contains graphic content that you may find disturbing. An Iranian man who was brutally beaten by security forces last year told CNN that he had asked them to take a calmer and more compromising stance towards demonstrators, and then they attacked him with a warning. The young boxer nearly died but has since become a hero to supporters of the protest movement.
 
He spoke exclusively to our Jomana Karadsheh about his ordeal.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  It was one of the most terrifying videos to emerge from Iran, a protester surrounded by armed regime forces trying to fend them off with a knife.
 
Shots are fired before he falls to his knees.
 
(VIDEO PLAYING)
 
Ashkan Morovati later appeared in an intensive care barely conscious with his parents by his side.
 
ASHKAN MOROVATI, KURDISH IRANIAN PROTESTED (through translator):  I had a severed artery in my leg. I had around 200 shotgun pellets in my body. I had serious wounds. Even after I surrendered and they arrested me, they beat me around 100 times in the head and the rest of my body with batons. When they were transporting me to the hospital, they shot me from a very close range with a shotgun. They thought I would be dead.
 
KARADSHEH (voice-over):  But Ashkan survived, and with him a tale of unimaginable horror.
 
MOROVATI (through translator):  I was the man who died and was brought back to life. As I am speaking with you, I still have 20 shotgun pellets still lodged in my body.
 
KARADSHEH (voice-over): He escaped Iran, now a wanted man in hiding, speaking exclusively to CNN. For his safety, he won't say where he is. 
 
MOROVATI (through translator):  I got out of the country through mountains and deserts while heavily bleeding and in very, very bad condition. I died so many times before I got out of the country. 
 
KARADSHEH (voice-over):  As he lay in hospital hanging onto life by a thread, he was charged with Moharave (ph),  waging war against God, a prime punishable by death in the Islamic Republic. Regime agents raided this hospital and drugged Ashkan to jail.
 
MOROVATI (through translator):  When somebody is taken from the ICU straight to prison, this is kind of a death sentence. In prison, I went through unbearable agony because all of my wounds were open. I used salt to try to disinfect my wounds just a little bit. They badly tormented me. They sent me to an army hospital that was not equipped to treat me. I was there in that condition with both of my hands and feet chained to the bed. 
 
KARADSHEH (voice-over):  People of this Kurdish town of Sonandosh (ph) protested for his release. His family paid all they have to bail him out for medical treatment. And with the help of France, he made out of Iran. 
 
MOROVATI (through translator):  I was a professional boxer, a fighter. I was so eager about my future and how to plan to proceed this part as a career. But because my leg and the rest of my body has not been severely injured, I can't do that anymore.
 
Being away from my family, and all the pressure that they've endured because of me, it's mentally tormenting me. I am not feeling okay physically or mentally. 
 
KARADSHEH (on-camera):  What do you want the world to know about what has happened inside of Iran right now? 
 
MOROVATI (through translator):  There are so many like me who sadly gave their life. But their voice did not reach outside.
 <br>[03:50:00]
 
There are so many brave girls and boys inside of Iran. Our only crime is that we demand freedom and democracy and want all women to be equal to our men. We shouted women, life, freedom, and the response to us is only bullet, only torturing, raping prisoners.
 
I saw many young people, 16, 17 year olds get killed. They killed so many. They blinded so many. I swear to God, I can't sleep at night thinking about those things.
 
KARADSHEH (voice-over):  Ashkan remains undeterred. Once he recovers he says, he says he is ready to go back and continue the fight for free Iran.
 
MOROVATI (through translator):  I have no regrets and I am proud of what I did. I will give my life for my people, for my Iran. Not one time, but 100,000 times. 
 
KARADSHEH (voice-over):  Jomana Karadsheh, CNN, Istanbul.

CHURCH:  The Iranian government did not respond to CNN's request for comment on Ashkam Morovati's case and the widespread allegations of protesters being mistreated, tortured and killed.
 
It is nearly 10.00 a.m. in France where a second round of nationwide strikes are now underway. Unions say that more than 100 schools (inaudible) are closed today with 60 percent of teachers skipping work. The Paris transport agency says that the metro service will be disrupted and only 20 percent of the regional trains will be operating. Workers are protesting the government's plans to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. More than 11,000 police officers are being deployed for the protests. 
 
Jair Bolsonaro is applying for a six-month tourist visa to stay here in the United States. The former Brazilian president arrived in the U.S. in December, reportedly on what is called an A1 one visa that's granted to heads of state and is only valid while they are in office. But dozens of House Democrats want Bolsonaro's visas revoked since he is now under investigation over the January 8th attacks in Brazil's capital when thousands of his supporters stormed key government buildings.
 
Coming up next, being banned from a venue because of what you do for a living. Why one of the world's best known arenas is using facial recognition to keep some ticketholders from taking their seats. Back with that in just a moment.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHURCH:  Can a company use technology to refuse to serve you because of what you do for a living? That's the debate playing out on camera both literally and figuratively in New York.
 
CNN's Omar Jimenez reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
UNKNOWN:  You've come up matching somebody on facial recognition.
 
OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): He was recognized on facial recognition cameras, then confronted.
 
UNKNOWN:  Are you Benjamin Norton (ph)?
 
UNKNOWN:  Yes.
 
JIMENEZ (voice-over):  This is how lawyer, Benjamin Norton, from one New York City law firm was greeted by Madison Square Garden staff or trying to attend an event in the fall.
 
UNKNOWN:  The ticket has been revoked, and you are not permitted.
 
JIMENEZ (voice-over):  It's because Norton works for a law firm representing ticket brokers in a lawsuit against Madison Square Garden Entertainment. All of the roughly 60 lawyers at his firm are also banned until the litigation is resolved.
 <br>[03:54:55]
 
JOE POLITO, COMMERCIAL LITIGATOR, DAVIDOFF HUTCHER &amp; CITRON: We received a letter from MSG stating that because of this litigation all attorneys in our firm, even attorneys who have nothing to do whatsoever with the litigation, would be barred for the duration of the litigation. JIMENEZ (voice-over):  The firm's co-founding partner has been a season ticket holder for 47 years. He believes here he's being retaliated against.
 
LARRY HUTCHER, CO-MANAGING PARTNER, DAVIDOFF HUTCHER &amp;CITRON:  The focus is to dissuade people from suing Madison Square Garden. If you have to think about, do I have a choice of being banned and representing somebody, somebody is going to say, I don't need that aggravation. I'm not going to take that thing.
 
JIMENEZ (VOICE-OVER):  Their firm is among dozens temporarily banned from MSG properties, including Radio City Music Hall, while they represent clients suing the Garden. New York Attorney General Letitia James believes they might be violating state and city laws, writing to them in part, forbidding entry to lawyers representing clients who've engaged in litigation against the company may dissuade such lawyers from taking on legitimate cases.
 
Days later, Madison Square Garden emphasized that it is a private business, and in compliance with all laws, writing in part, the attorneys we're prohibiting from attending include ambulance chasers and money grabbers whose business is motivated by self-promotion and who capitaled on the misfortune of others. This includes attorneys representing ticket scalpers, personal injury claims and class action litigations, but does not include claims related to sexual harassment or employment discrimination.
 
JAMES DOLAN, CEO, MADISON SQUARE GARDEN:  You get to say who you serve. And if it's somebody who is suing you and trying to put you out of business or take your money from you, right, et cetera, you have a right to be, yes, a little unhappy about it.
 
JIMENEZ (voice-over):  Some experts believe that it is a slippery slope and not just the discretionary power of who else could be flagged in the future but one method being used to enforce it even if it is legal.
 
DAVE MAASS, DIRECTOR OF INVESTIGATION, ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION: I've read their privacy policy. They explicitly saying that the biometrics they capture from you can be used for any purpose that would benefit their economic interest. 
 
JIMENEZ (voice-over):  Some don't believe that it should be used at all. 
 
ALBERT FOX CAHN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY OVERSIGHT PROJECT:  And I'm terrified of the day where we allow companies to use so many forms of tracking and surveillance that, you know, we end up in the middle of one of the largest cities on the planet without any place we can actually go while keeping our privacy safe. 
 
JIMENEZ (voice-over): Omar Jimenez, CNN, New York.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHURCH:  Madison Square Garden says that it has been using facial recognition since 2018 to help provide a safe and secure environment. But the New York attorney general still has questions about how the technology is being used by the company. Meanwhile, the law firm featured in Omar's piece went to court and won a temporary injunction to gained limited access to some events.
