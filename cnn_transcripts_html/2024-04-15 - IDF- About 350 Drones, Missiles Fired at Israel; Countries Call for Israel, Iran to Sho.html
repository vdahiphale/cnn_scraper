BECKY ANDERSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Well, hello and welcome. I'm Becky Anderson, coming to you live from Abu Dhabi.
 <br>[00:00:37]
 
A new day begins across the Middle East while the world waits anxiously to see how Israel will respond to Iran's unprecedented aerial assault. As the bombardment ended over the weekend, an all-out diplomatic push began, aiming to avoid further escalation.
 
The G-7 met virtually, and regional leaders spoke with their global counterparts. In an emergency session of the United Nations Security Council, the secretary general urged restraint.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANTONIO GUTERRES, U.N. SECRETARY-GENERAL: The Middle East is on the brink. The people of the region are confronting a real danger of a devastating full-scale conflict. Now is the time to diffuse and deescalate. Now is the time for maximum restraint.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, Israel says about 350 drones, missiles, and rockets were fired from Iran, Iraq, Yemen, and by Hezbollah in Lebanon. Nearly all were intercepted. 
 
The U.S. says it intercepted more than 80 drones and at least six missiles but insists it won't join any retaliatory strikes.
 
Well, Israel's war cabinet has not decided on a response. A source tells CNN, the council is divided, but a call from the U.S. president convinced Israel's prime minister to delay retaliation, at least for now.
 
CNN international diplomatic editor Nic Robertson joins us from Jerusalem. And Nic, we did hear from the Israeli president, speaking to CNN yesterday. What did he have to say? 
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Yes, he thanked the United States and congratulated, as well, the Israeli security forces, the military, the air force, the intelligence services, and all those who played a role in keeping the country safe and thanked coalition partners. 
 
But on this question of what Israel will do next, Isaac Herzog, the president, said the country would act responsibly.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ISAAC HERZOG, ISRAELI PRESIDENT: I think we're operating in a very focused way and a very responsible way. And I'm sure there will be a decision accordingly that will make sure that we protect and defend the people of Israel. And of course, serve the idea of this coalition that has emanated all of a sudden in front of our eyes, in opposing the aggressive acts and the -- and the operations of Iran in the region for so many years.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ROBERTSON: And what he says here about protecting the people of Israel, I think that reflects what we heard from other officials yesterday, which is that the likelihood is that Israel will respond militarily to Iran, that they're perhaps trying to build some consensus among partners and allies. 
 
The United States has been very clear it will not join Israel in any offensive action. But Israel will want to try to build a position where it's already calling for other countries, other partners to declare the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist organization and will try to build a consensus for the value and the need to take military action against Iran. 
 
But what -- the outcome of the war cabinet yesterday was that they decided that, after almost five hours of discussions, that they needed more time to figure out what their next action should be, when that action should be, and what the scope of that action should be. 
 
And in the meantime, they directed the IDF, the military, to come up with military options for the politicians to consider, Becky. 
 <br>[00:05:01]
 
ANDERSON: It's not if but how, I think, Israel will respond. And when, Nic, as you rightly point out. 
 
A piece in "The Financial Times" today analyzing the attack, 350 projectiles. This is no small assault, whether or not it was, you know, well-telegraphed or not. This is no small assault on Israel and its security.
 
And "The FT" writing today, Iran's assault in Israel was in effect, an attempt to re-establish the old rules of the game, as it were, this sort of shadow war, if you will that has been waged for so long. 
 
What do you make of Iran's position and its diplomatic reach out at this point to not just the region -- and that is important to Iran, having re-established its diplomatic ties, certainly around the Gulf. 
 
But it's a very vocal message to the international community and to the U.S., specifically. Do not get involved, because your bases are targets around this region, should you get involved. 
 
ROBERTSON: Yes, Iran very quickly moved on Saturday night before the missiles even started impacting here in the early hours of Sunday morning.
 
To say this is essentially one and done, we're not -- there won't be a follow-up. This is it for right now, as long as Israel doesn't respond.
 
And President Biden has told Israel, but the fact that their -- their defenses were so effective to consider this a win. And Iran would like to see this as a win. And they were -- there was one civilian casualty in -- in all of this.
 
Iran is -- was trying to, by its own accounting, telegraph what was coming, not -- not overstep, if you will, and trigger a red line, although inevitably in Israel's eyes, they -- they have been -- they have been seen to do that.
 
But Iran wanted a set -- turn the tables on Israel and say, Israel, you cannot act against our interests, our senior commanders in the IRGC. You cannot strike our diplomatic offices around the world with impunity. We are telling you this is our deterrent.
 
But Israel has always stood strong and convinced its enemies that it will use strong deterrence to deter them from acting again. 
 
So this -- so while Iran may be trying to sort of present this as it's done, there were no huge casualties, we've made our point, the point they've made is that Israel cannot or is now challenged to -- to re- establish its own deterrence. 
 
And Iran knows that that will put Israel potentially in bad standing with its allies. And it is not just -- what happened wasn't just a military event. It was a diplomatic event. It was a political event. It was a strategic event. 
 
And this tries to turn the tables on Israel militarily and -- and turn -- and put Israel in the corner with its allies, as we have seen with the United States. 
 
President Biden saying he will not join Israel in a strike back at Iran. Everyone's calling in this region for de-escalation, not just to Iran but Israel, as well. 
 
And this is a paradigm that -- that Israel won't countenance. You know, this government, perhaps, or any other Israeli government, won't countenance having countries in the region that will try to dictate the terms on the way that they can operate, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Good to have you, Nic.
 
A new day begins across the Middle East. What the Middle East does not want to see is a new dawn of spiraling conflict. Thank you. As Israel considers, then, how to respond to Iran's attack, other
 
 countries in the region calling for restraint, as Nic said, on both sides.
 
Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry spoke with his counterparts in Iran and Israel on Sunday, warning any further escalation could destabilize the Middle East even more. 
 
The Saudi foreign ministry issued a statement expressing concerns over -- and I quote here -- "any potential severe repercussions." In a social media post, the ministry called on the U.N. Security Council to step up and manage the situation, given the threat to international peace and security.
 
It's that international peace and security which, of course, sits at the heart of the U.N. Security Council's mandate. 
 
Officials here in the UAE responded, as well. The ministry of foreign affairs issued a statement in the wake of the attacks, saying it "called for resolving differences through dialogue and through diplomatic channels." 
 
To discuss this further I'm joined by Amjad Taha, author of "The Deception of the Arab Spring." He's a political -- political strategist and analyst, as well as CEO of the Euro Post Agency. 
 
Amjad, it's good to have you. This is a climate where, as far as the UAE is concerned, there needs to be a real ratcheting up of diplomatic efforts and dialogue to ensure that this thing doesn't spiral out of control. 
 
You are well-versed in -- in the UAE's perspective on what is going on here around the Middle East. Just explain the view from the UAE, if you will.
 
AMJAD TAHA, AUTHOR, "THE DECEPTION OF THE ARAB SPRING": Well, first of all, thank you for having me. 
 
I think the de-escalation is requested and is required. And the fact that, through dialogue and through diplomacy, there is a lot of challenges that can be overcome. 
 
That -- that is the pathology, and that is the path when it comes to UAE. 
 
But however, de-escalation, it's (ph) been understood that the United States of American need to get more involved in the Middle East. China is not the solution. India is not the solution. The United States of America has more solutions in -- to put on a table when it comes to the Middle East.
 
The fact that, at one point, the United States of America decided by Biden administration to be away from the Middle East. I think it wasn't the best choice. 
 
So we need to be more into the Middle East, keeping an eye on the Middle East and bring more solutions when it comes to radicalism, and bring even more solution when it comes to the Iranian regime.
 
I mean, the Iranian regime complaining about what happened between them and the Israelis when they -- when there was an attack next to their -- next to the embassy of Iran in Damascus. 
 
But then Iran also attacked the Saudi embassy. We all remember that. And Iran also attacked the Britain embassy. And we all understand -- and we didn't see Saudi declaring war, nor Britain declaring war on Iran. 
 
But the best solution here is that the United States America is the solution; one, to -- they can bring a lot on the table. The fact that they need to send a strong and firm message today, Iranian last night when they attacked Israel, we see in the Middle East almost they came together. 
 
And this -- the greatest message we heard, and it was very crystal clear. It was from Jordan, that our sovereignty is more important, that our nation is more important, that we've got to protect our nation. We've got to protect our borders. We've got to protect the right of defending ourselves. 
 
We -- there was a breach of international law when Iran launches its rockets from Iran, but it crosses all those countries. All those countries, they had to -- it was their aerospace. They had to stop their businesses and so on. And that is a war not on Israel, but in the whole Middle East. 
 
So what Iran wants to have a war on Israel, and when those rockets, they dropped in Jordan street, they dropped in Syria, they dropped in Iraq. All those countries were suffering from Iranian rockets, including a baby, a Bedouin Muslim Arab baby. As with a child seven years old, girl. 
 
And Israel, all the way there, she was targeted by a rocket. I don't think -- and I don't think anyone from our audience believed that baby had anything to do with any battlefield in the region. 
 
ANDERSON: Yes.
 
TAHA: And the question is that this. Iran is for Gaza or for their interests. That is -- that is a question that Iran --
 
ANDERSON: And yet, this is -- yes.
 
TAHA: Go ahead. 
 
ANDERSON: Let me -- let me put this to you. That -- you've got a very interesting perspective here. 
 
Talking about the importance of U.S. interest, if not military involvement in the Middle East. And as you rightly point out, at the beginning of this Biden administration, we saw what was perceived to be a waning of interests in this region, with a focus much more squarely on Asia and China and deterrence against China, both politically and economically. The Abraham Accords sit at the heart of the U.S. administration's Middle East pillar, the Abraham Accords designed by their architects to introduce and involve Israel in a wider Middle East for, as far as the architects of those accords are concerned, a more peaceful Middle East going forward. 
 
Now there have been charges that the Abraham Accords, certainly during this last six months, as we've seen the conflict in Gaza ratchet up, are the Abraham Accords really the vehicle to promote peace and stability and de-escalation around this region?
 <br>[00:15:19]
 
The UAE will very specifically say the answer to that is yes. These are strategic and long-term. And we see the interest by the Saudis, for example, of normalizing relations, as well, with Israel going forward, as long as there is a Palestinian horizon established.
 
Iran sees these Abraham Accords as introducing Israel into a region it doesn't want to see happen. 
 
What's your sense as to the longevity of these accords as a vehicle to promote peace going forward? Certainly, the Iranians don't want to see this increased involvement by Israel. Your sense? 
 
TAHA: Well, clearly, Iranians, they don't want to see that happening. Absolutely. 
 
But when it comes to the Abrahamic Accord, if it wasn't for the Abrahamic Accord, we would have not been able to send tons of food, tons of aid to there, to the people of the Gaza. 
 
So because we utilize the Abrahamic Accord, we were able to build that humanitarian corridor. Yes, with all the charts that is happening, but there still -- there is a hope in the darkness we can be the light. That's one side. 
 
When it came to the G-20. And this is -- was, I think it was the main important thing that changed everything. In G-20, Biden administration put on the table, and they say that corridor from India, the economic corridor or the train of economy, let's call it, in the best way of putting it. That starts from India, comes through the Gulf, Saudi, UAE, and it goes all the way to Israel, passing Palestinian states itself. In the future, that would have meant the oldest nation on a strong nation. And also that Iran can no longer use hormones or use the red -- the Red Sea to -- to provoke nations or stop nations from trading, as they are doing, using the Red Sea and the homeless right now.
 
That, to the Iranian, meant to put a stop for it. That's when the 7th of October happened. But the question is this. The fact that we went for the Abrahamic Accord, a lot of countries joined, and it was really hard. And, you know that. In the Middle East, for you to normalize with Israel is a really challenging thing to do. But we went and we did it, and it was a brave move from our leadership. The next step was from the United States of America, as Biden
 
 administration came into power, they didn't reward the Abrahamic Accord. In fact, they rewarded the Iranians, which is the other side, which is anti-Semite regime that does not support any peace. It was rewarded with 6 billion release of money that goes to the Iranian bank, in exchange for five American prisoners. 
 
And guess who took the wrong signal for that? Hamas. The thought, OK, we take 200 instead.
 
That signal is not the best, and it might send the wrong signal to the alliance of the United States of America that it's not very reliable. We know it is, but it sends the wrong message, even if you -- if the Biden administration meant something else. 
 
But one thing we know, one of the main solutions for de-escalation, one of the main solutions for peace is a strong America and a strong, present America in the Middle East, not anywhere else. 
 
ANDERSON: Amjad, it's good to have you. Thank you very much, indeed, for joining. A perspective there from Amjad Taha, political analyst, UAE-based. But today, stateside for you. Thank you. 
 
Coming up, Israel's war cabinet is determined to respond to Iran, but it's not clear what that response will be. We'll look at the options, calculations, coming up.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[00:22:48]
 
ANDERSON: Welcome back, 22 minutes past 8 in the morning in Abu Dhabi. This is CNN. I'm Becky Anderson from our Middle East programming hub. 
 
A senior U.S. administration official says Iran messaged the United States privately while the attack on Israel was underway on Saturday to say, quoting the U.S. official, that they were finished after this. 
 
Well, the barrage of more than 350 projectiles from Tehran had the potential to cause great destruction. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
(AIR RAID SIRENS)
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: But the vast majority of those strikes were intercepted by Israel and its partners in what was a multi-layered system that repelled this Iran attack.
 
And the U.S. has assessed that there was no significant damage within Israel itself. The IDF says only a few of these projectiles actually made it inside Israel.
 
Well, now Israel is promising to exact a price from Iran for the attack. As Israel's war cabinet weighs its response, its allies, including U.S. President Joe Biden, are urging restraint. 
 
Joining me now from Little Rock, Arkansas, retired U.S. General Wesley Clark. He's also the former NATO supreme allied commander and is the founder of Renew America Together.
 
So the interesting scenario here, the U.S. leaning very heavily on Netanyahu to message to his war cabinet, Wesley Clark, that this effectively should be it at this stage. 
 
Biden himself getting a lot of pressure from Republicans to do more in support of Israel. And Netanyahu, certainly from the right wing of his cabinet, being encouraged to crush Iran, as one of those cabinet members has tweeted.
 
What's your sense of what happens next?
 
GEN. WESLEY CLARK (RET.), FORMER NATO SUPREME ALLIED COMMANDER: Well, I think -- I think Israel has to strike back. 
 <br>[00:25:03]
 
I think the very pressures that are on a president of the United States indicate to Israel that they've got to -- they've got to be more self-reliant in terms of reestablishing their deterrent in the region.
 
You can't have a deterrent. If you can't dominate escalation. So if you stop right here, Iran says, Hey, we got you. Let's stop.
 
Israel has to show that it has a more powerful riposte than Iran could handle, in order to achieve security in the region. And if Israel doesn't do this, it's actually not in the interest of the United States. It puts us in a position that we're -- we become responsible for all of Israel's security. And we don't want that. Israel doesn't want it. 
 
So I think some kind of response is inevitable.
 
ANDERSON: Yes, from Iran's perspective, though, the supreme leader under enormous pressure, both domestically and with these proxies around the region to -- to a certain extent, do the same and establish or re-establish strategic deterrence. 
 
And it has been, you know, well-telegraphed from Tehran that any offensive position here, seen as retaliation or a response from Israel, will be dealt with severely. And that puts U.S. assets on bases around this region in play, Wesley. 
 
CLARK: Well, the United States pointedly didn't say we wouldn't support Israel if Iran retaliated against an Israeli strike. 
 
So Israel, essentially, has a get out of free -- out of jail free card. Israel has the support of the United States. Israel is going to do what it believes it must do. 
 
The real -- the real question here is, what's the status of Iran's nuclear program? Do they have nuclear weapons ready? Some people say they have one or two that may have been completed. Others say they're getting very close. 
 
But we're approaching the moment when everything could change, and Israel's very aware of this. So their safety in the region, their security for 70-plus years, has been a function of their ability to dominate an escalation ladder against any opponent. 
 
I don't think Israel is going to give that security feature up just yet. 
 
ANDERSON: Wesley Clark, good to have you, sir. Thank you. 
 
CLARK: Thank you.
 
ANDERSON: Our coverage continues after this quick break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[00:31:27]
 
ANDERSON: Welcome back. Just after half past 8 in the morning here in Abu Dhabi. I'm Becky Anderson from our Middle East programming hub here on CNN.
 
Israel trying to get back to normal, as it were, after being bombarded it with a wave of missiles late on Saturday that ramped up tensions in this region. 
 
Schools will reopen on Monday morning, and restrictions on large gatherings in Israel have been lifted. 
 
Officials say they are determined to respond to the attacks but are still figuring out the timing and scope of any action.
 
CNN analyst Barak Ravid says some ministers are pushing for immediate retaliation, while others are urging caution due to international pressure.
 
And world leaders are concerned all of this could spiral into a wider conflict. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
URSULA VON DER LEYEN, EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESIDENT: Such a direct Iranian attack against Israel is unprecedented. Today, we, the leaders of the G-7, condemn this in the strongest terms. We expressed our solidarity and support to the people of Israel and reaffirmed our unshakeable commitment towards its security. 
 
Iran's actions risk provoking an uncontrollable regional escalation. And this has to be avoided.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
ANDERSON: Well, in Washington, the speaker of the House promised to try once again to bring an Israeli aid deal to the floor, and he is aiming for this week. 
 
Mike Johnson, who stood shoulder to shoulder with Donald Trump on Friday, has been wrestling with aid packages for Israel and Ukraine, the latter being opposed by hardline Republicans. 
 
Johnson went on FOX News to say the details are still to be finalized. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): -- the White House, as well. The American people --
 
The House Republicans and the Republican Party understand the necessity of standing with Israel. We're going to try again this week, and the details of that package are being put together right now. We're looking at the options and all these supplemental issues.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer also spoke out saying, quote, "Given the events of tonight" -- this was Saturday night into Sunday -- "it is even clearer that the best way to help Israel is for the House to quickly pass the Senate's bipartisan national security supplemental next week."
 
And that bill includes funding for Israel, as well as Ukraine and Taiwan. 
 
Well, Pope Francis making an appeal after this weekend's violence in the Middle East. He is urging leaders in the region to work to avoid further escalation, asking them to choose peace.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
POPE FRANCIS, LEADER OF CATHOLIC CHURCH (through translator): How much suffering. Let's pray for peace. Enough war, enough attacks, enough violence. Let there be dialogue and let there be peace.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
ANDERSON: And he called for a pause in the fighting in Gaza. He said that would be to allow more humanitarian aid in and to help free the hostages held by Hamas. 
 
He also called for a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians. 
 
I'm Becky Anderson. I'll be back in about 30 minutes, live from Abu Dhabi. After the break. My colleague Paula Newton has the latest on Donald Trump's historic criminal trial, set to begin later today.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
PAULA NEWTON, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Hello, I'm Paula Newton in Atlanta. To our other top story now. We are just hours away from the start of Donald Trump's historic criminal trial in New York. Jury selection is set to get underway. This will be the first time a former U.S. president will go on trial for criminal charges. 
 
Trump is accused of falsifying business records to hide the reimbursement of hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels. 
 
The Republican Party's presumptive presidential nominee is facing 34 counts of falsifying business records. 
 
Now, law enforcement officials say they will deploy a sophisticated and multi-layered security plan. CNN's Polo Sandoval has our details.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, we all remember the security presence that was dedicated to former President Donald Trump during his civil fraud hearings and also during some previous appearances here in criminal court. Think of that as really the precursor to what we will begin to see here in Lower Manhattan starting on Monday, when his trial gets underway. 
 
This is a months-long planning situation that will involve many agencies.
 
I'll give you sort of a preview of what we can expect. For starters, the NYPD will be mainly in charge of securing the area around the courthouse, using some of these barricades to create what are called, like, these frozen zones to secure the area around the facility itself, especially as the former president arrives. And then, certainly, as he leaves.
 <br>[00:40:09]
 
Any potential Trump supporters or protesters, the NYPD will be really getting that presence to this park across the street, essentially creating a safety zone, or at least a bubble here, between members of the general public and what's going on inside. 
 
The Secret Service, their main responsibility will be protecting the former president. They will also be the ones to determine what motorcade route they take here from Trump Tower. That's about six miles away. 
 
A law enforcement official telling my colleague Mark Morales that they will likely -- that route will vary from day to day. 
 
And then finally, court officers, their responsibilities will be behind these walls. They'll be mainly in charge of the former president's movements, even dedicated a specific elevator that will be the one to actually take Donald Trump up to -- up to the courthouse where the proceedings are going to take place. 
 
Look, some good news here. These agencies, they're all used to doing this, working hand in hand before. What will certainly set this situation apart is that now, it's not just a former president facing trial. It's a former president that is currently running for president. 
 
Polo Sandoval, CNN, New York.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE) 
 
NEWTON: I'm Paul Newton. For our international viewers, WORLD SPORT is next. For viewers here in North America, I'll be back with more news after a quick break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 <br>[00:45:33]
 
NEWTON: Now is the time for maximum restraint. That was a call for de- escalation from the U.N. secretary-general during Sunday's emergency Security Council session after Iran's attack on Israel. 
 
Now, Israel and Iran condemned each other's actions during the emergency meeting. And the U.S. warning, in no uncertain terms, that Tehran, quote, "will be held responsible" if it takes any action against the U.S. or Israel. 
 
Now, while the focus, of course, has been on Iran's attacks, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continues to face pressure to bring home the more than 100 hostages still believed to be held in Gaza. 
 
I am joined now by Iris Haggai Liniado. She is, in fact, one of those family members. Her parents, Israeli Americans, were kidnapped and are now believed to have been killed by Hamas.
 
And Iris, it is good to see you again. Certainly, given the courage that you've shown the last few months. 
 
And now we get to the last 24 hours, right? Iris, I mean, how do you feel that you, your family, the other families Do you feel that you're being heard and that you're able to continue to fight on to give, certainly, some kind of freedom and hope to the hostages remaining, and for families like yours, trying to bring back the bodies of your parents? 
 
IRIS HAGGAI LINIADO, PARENTS KIDNAPPED BY HAMAS: Hi, Paula. Thank you for having me again. 
 
You know, during the attack, I was very fearful that, you know, the hostage situation will kind of be on hold and -- and was -- you know, I think we were all waiting to see what Israel's response is going to be. 
 
But I'm very thankful that Israel and all the allies are aware of what's at stake here, you know, what are the goals. 
 
Currently, you know -- Israel is currently in a war with Hamas, which is a very, very blunt extension of the IRGC, which is the Iranian regime. And Iran is a part of this war. It always has been. This is nothing new.
 
And I would hope that all countries in the world, especially the G-7 countries, would realize that this is a bigger issue. And, you know, fighting terror is a lot bigger than just Hamas. 
 
And, you know, demanding a ceasefire and everything, what we heard before the -- the attack on Israel by Iran without conditioning it with the immediate release of hostages, kind of strengthens the Iranian regime and terror groups. 
 
And I'm hoping that they realize now that, you know, this is not a small Middle Eastern situation. This is a global issue, a humanitarian issue. 
 
I mean, the Iranian regime is holding their own people, you know, in a hostile environment, with women's rights, with -- with just horrific things. And Hamas is an extension of that. Hezbollah is an extension of that. 
 
And as long as we fight that, I think it helps, you know, get my parents back to Israel, to a respectful burial, you know, and hopefully, all of the other 133 hostages, as well. 
 
NEWTON: Yes, and I can see what you're saying in terms of understand -- to have people around the world to understand that this is now on a larger platform, that there is a lot at stake, not just the lives of those hostages. 
 
I want you to listen now, though, to Admiral Daniel Hagari from the IDF. You know, he tried to put families at ease. Listen to him for a second.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
REAR ADMIRAL DANIEL HAGARI, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES SPOKESPERSON: Even while under attack from Iran, we have not lost sight, not for one moment, of our critical mission in Gaza to rescue our hostages from the hands of Iran's proxies, Hamas; of our moral duty to do everything in our power to bring 133 hostages back home.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
NEWTON: You know, despite what he said, Iris, he followed it up immediately by pointing out the hard truth that Hamas had rejected the latest proposal that was brokered to try and get that ceasefire and the hostages' release. 
 
So I ask you, are you a bit nervous, though, that given everything going on, that in fact, attention will pull away from the plight of the hostages?
 <br>[00:50:09]
 
LINIADO: I think it's up to us to not forget. I mean, this has been going on for way too long. There are 133 hostages currently in Gaza, you know, getting raped, getting tortured. And you know, let us remind ourselves, there are 133 hostages because
 
 Elad Katzir, who was a dear friend from my kibbutz, was murdered while in captivity. And that's why the number went down.
 
And the Israeli intelligence somehow found where he was, and they were very lucky -- and I say this with a very heavy heart -- to bring his body into the Israeli territory. And thankfully, his amazing family, who fought so hard for him, got to bury him.
 
But that's just another reminder how crucial and immediate this thing is. You know, it's not -- it's not saying that, you know, time is running out. There is no time. There's no time. I think we need to focus on what's immediate, which is human lives. Not only Israeli hostages were being tortured, but also, you know, people of Gaza. 
 
You know, we saw yesterday with the attack from Iran, we saw how much Israel values life. We saw the amazing, really -- this is really incredible -- the offense and the way that Israel protected its civilians. And we don't see that in Gaza.
 
If Israel didn't do that, Israel would probably be demolished by what happened, you know, with the attack from Iran, which is really amazing for Israel but so sad for the Palestinians, who are just -- they're hostages by their own government, who again, is the direct extension of the Iranian regime. 
 
And I think it's up to us to take responsibility, to remember our morals, to remember what's at stake here. It's not just 133 hostages. It's not just Gaza. It's everywhere worldwide. 
 
I just read that ISIS is getting stronger in the U.K. This is really scary. And I think the world needs to wake up. And you know, you know me. I'm never for violence of any kind. But there are terrorists, and we need to make sure that they don't accomplish their goals, which is to demolish the Western world. 
 
NEWTON: You know, Iris, I don't have a lot of time left, but I want to ask you. We have seen more divisions in Israeli society itself, a lot more protests. 
 
How do you think that will play into whether or not, you know, as you said, you are able to give your parents the burial that they deserved? Will that help your cause or perhaps hurt it? 
 
LINIADO: I think it's been 193 days, and I think we are just, all of us families, you know, left and right. And we're just going crazy. You know, it's just -- there's no other way to put it. I mean, I think it's our right to have something to say about our governments, about the world governments. And I think it's up to our governments and hopefully everybody -- and I have to say thank you to the American administration has been incredible. 
 
But it's really our responsibility to make sure that the hostages aren't forgotten and then, you know, I can bring my parents back to a respectful burial. And my kids can go somewhere on Memorial Day. And you know -- and we have to take responsibility and think twice
 
 before we have statements like, I demand a ceasefire, without even recognizing that there are 103 hostages who have to come out. 
 
I mean, I feel horrific for the people in Gaza, but at the same time, you know, we didn't ask for this war, and there are 133 innocent lives who are being tortured. My friend might be pregnant right now in Gaza. 
 
So it's -- it's -- you know, the families are just doing everything they can to make sure that this issue is -- is being dealt with. 
 
NEWTON: Iris, I know many of you continue to work to the point of emotional and physical exhaustion on all of this. We will continue to check in with you. Thanks so much. 
 
LINIADO: Thank you so much, Paula. Thank you. 
 
NEWTON: Now, leaders in Asia, meantime, are also condemning Iran's missile and drone attack on Israel this weekend. 
 
Japan's prime ministers says, quote, "It further aggravates the current situation in the Middle East." 
 
We want to bring in CNN's Kristie Lu Stout from Hong Kong, who's been following all of this reaction. And Kristie, I did notice that, depending on, you know, who you were looking at in the region, there was a lot of nuance to what they said. 
 
KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR/CORRESPONDENT: Very much so, Paula. China and other nations across the region are speaking out after Iran's retaliatory strike on Israel when you listen to Japan and South Korea, they both strongly condemned the strikes. Indonesia, Malaysia, they are urging restraint.
 <br>[00:55:03]
 
And China is expressing deep concern while calling for an immediate ceasefire. 
 
On Sunday, we heard from its ministry of foreign affairs, and said this. Let's bring it up for you. Quote, "The conflict must end now. China calls on the international community, especially countries with influence, to play a constructive role for the peace and stability of the region."
 
China wants to be a peace broker in the Middle East, a region where it sources a tremendous amount, growing amount of its energy. 
 
And analysts point out that, in the perspective of Beijing, the off- ramp here is not for China to restrain Iran but for the United States to restrain Israel. 
 
Now, also here in the region, we heard from India and Pakistan. They both expressed concern. According to India's Ministry of External Affairs, they said this: "We call for an immediate de-escalation, exercise of restraints, stepping back from violence, and return to the path of diplomacy."
 
From Pakistan, we heard this, quote, "For months, Pakistan has underlined the necessity of international efforts to prevent expansion of hostilities in the region and for a ceasefire in Gaza," unquote. 
 
Now close U.S. ally Australia has also -- has gone out of its way to condemn Iran for these attacks on Israel, saying this: quote, "Iran has ignored our call and those of many other countries not to proceed with these reckless attacks." Goes on to say, "Australia continues to support regional security, including that of Israel," unquote. 
 
Now Iran's attack has raised the threat of a wider conflict. And here in Asia, like much of the world, is very much on edge.
 
Back to you, Paula. 
 
NEWTON: Absolutely. Kristie Lu Stout for us in Hong Kong. Thank you. 
 
And I thank you. I'm Paula Newton in Atlanta. Our coverage continues with Becky Anderson in Abu Dhabi after a quick break.
