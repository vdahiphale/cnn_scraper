ISA SOARES, HOST, ISA SOARES TONIGHT:  A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, the two warring sides in Sudan agreed to 
 
 a 24-hour ceasefire, but will it hold after another day of violence? We have the very latest for you. Then Russia launches a barrage of airstrikes 
 
 at Ukraine as the battle in the east rages on.  
 
We are live for you on the ground. Plus, "Fox News" agrees a record settlement with Dominion. We'll look at what this means for the broadcaster 
 
 as it faces even more legal trouble. We start, though in Sudan, a powerful militia and the country's armed forces agreeing to another temporary 
 
 ceasefire that went into effect just in fact, two hours ago. 
 
A previous ceasefire brokered by Washington was called on Tuesday. The hope, of course, was to evacuate people living in Khartoum, the capital, 
 
 and foreigners who have found themselves trapped. But that ceasefire didn't hold. Well, gunfire explosions and fighter jets were heard across Khartoum 
 
 with reports of gunmen storming the homes of those working for the United Nations and other international organizations. 
 
Both sides then blaming each other for the failure of Tuesday's ceasefire, and dragging, of course, the country further into chaos. Our Larry Madowo 
 
 breaks it all down for you. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
 
LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Smoke billows and plummet- Khartoum sky as residents woke up to another day of heavy artillery and bombardment. In the wake of the escalating conflict, RSF leader Hemetti is, 
 
 according to multiple sources, commanding his forces from one of Khartoum's busiest residential areas, prompting the Sudanese army to accuse the RSF of 
 
 using civilians as human shields. 
 
What were once bustling with cars and people, since Saturday, Khartoum streets have been left deserted with some residents hiding in their homes 
 
 and fearing for their safety. Just like Hadeel Mohamed, who says since the fighting broke out, she's been housebound and thinks forces might break in 
 
 to steal supplies. 
 
HADEEL MOHAMED, SUDAN RESIDENT:  So once they run out of food and equipment, and what they have and what they need, they very easily will be 
 
 able to walk into houses and say, give me what you have, because they've got a bigger agenda and award to win. 
 
MADOWO:  Other residents took advantage of Tuesday's ceasefire announcement by queuing outside shops. Desperate not to be locked indoors with nothing 
 
 to eat. In the wake of a broken ceasefire, Kenya's President William Ruto warned that attacks against civilians are equal to crimes against humanity. 
 
WILLIAM RUTO, PRESIDENT, KENYA:  Attacks on diplomatic installations and personnel, as well as targeting of hospitals, hotels and other vital public 
 
 and social spaces are deliberate, systematic and tantamount to atrocities against humanity. 
 
MADOWO:  As the fighting rages on into a days-long struggle, it leaves residents to question when will there be an end to this war or if they will 
 
 even survive it? Larry Madowo, CNN. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE) 
 
SOARES:  Well, let's turn now to the World Health Organization's Sudan Representative, Dr. Nima Abid. Doctor, thank you very much for taking the 
 
 time to speak to us -- coming to us live from Khartoum. The ceasefire as you probably heard at the top of the show as we were reporting, now being 
 
 in place for what? Two hours, just over two hours. 
 
We saw, of course, a similar commitment yesterday and it collapsed almost immediately. From what you can tell in Khartoum, is the ceasefire holding, 
 
 doctor? OK, it seems that we have lost connection with the doctor. We are - - I keep losing connection, of course, given the circumstances on the ground, we will try to reconnect and bring back the doctor, it's important 
 
 to get his insight given as well what we have seen in the past two days that really people have been hunkered down. 
 <br>[14:05:00] 
 
People have been able to get into hospitals, lack of water, lack of medicine, very important we hear from the W.H.O., so we'll try and 
 
 reconnect as soon as we've got that line, of course, we shall bring it to you. I want to go, though, to Ukraine, in the meantime, because it says 
 
 whatever gains Russia is making in Bakhmut are upset by its human losses. The Ukrainian deputy Defense Minister saying Russia is losing several times 
 
 more troops in the fighting than Ukraine is. 
 
The battle for the devastated city shows no signs of stopping, and preparations for a Spring, a counteroffensive are underway, though, 
 
 Ukrainian officials say there's no way they will announce when it's coming. Russian commanders are preparing too in the occupied region of Kherson, 
 
 their commandeering civilian boats be used for the military, and they've launched dozens of airstrikes in the past day.
 
Our Ben Wedeman is joining me now from eastern Ukraine. And Ben, we have seen the rush is really increasing their use of air power, and particularly 
 
 in Bakhmut. Talk us through the airstrikes that we've seen in the past 24 hours here. 
 
BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, these airstrikes, according to a statement from the Ukrainian Defense Ministry 
 
 earlier in the day, they said that there are 60 airstrikes around in the Bakhmut area. And we were actually in the Bakhmut area yesterday, looking 
 
 at the air defenses in the area, and they are dealing with basically equipment from the 1970s.
 
So, they are very eager to get better weapons. In fact, today was announced that a German-supplied Patriot anti-missile battery had arrived in country. 
 
 This is something the Ukrainians have been asking for, for a very long time, now whether it will make a difference in the battle for Bakhmut, it's 
 
 not altogether clear. 
 
We don't know how much of that city the Ukrainians still control. But it does appear that they are trying to hold on to it as much as possible 
 
 because, as the deputy Defense Minister referred to, today, they claim, the Ukrainians claim that for every one dead Ukrainian, there are   several 
 
 dead Russians. 
 
However, neither side nor neither the Russians nor the Ukrainians ever published. casualty figures, so we'll just have to take her at her word. 
 
 But there's no question that the Russians are trying at this point as their Winter offensive comes to an end to achieve some sort of significant 
 
 victory, and that would be the capture of Bakhmut. But at the moment, it appears as much as they tried, they simply can't get that last bit yet. 
 
 Isa. 
 
SOARES:  Do we know, Ben, from contacting, of course, Ukrainian forces and what you're hearing on the ground, how much Russia actually controls in 
 
 terms of territory in Bakhmut. Do we have a sense of the size? 
 
WEDEMAN:  We were talking about perhaps 65 percent to 70 percent, perhaps more of the city they can control. I can tell you, I was there for much of 
 
 January, for instance, and many of the areas we were moving around freely in Bakhmut are now under Russian control. There's only one road that 
 
 Ukrainians can use to get in and out of Bakhmut, get supplies in and out, and the Russians are trying through a pincer movement from the north and to 
 
 the south of that road that heads east, trying to cut that road off. 
 
So clearly, I mean, what we've seen from video today coming out of Bakhmut from the Ukrainian army, they have some positions on the outskirts of town, 
 
 but the actual part of the city that they control is fairly small. 
 
SOARES:  And in the meantime, Ben, we have seen today or seeing today that Spain has shipped two Leopard tanks, I believe to Ukraine. We've also seen 
 
 Patriot defense systems arriving in the country. Does this suggest to you that a counteroffensive is -- counteroffensive is nearing even if they -- 
 
 Ukrainians say they won't announce when that Spring offensive is starting. 
 
WEDEMAN:  There's no question it's coming. It's -- the timing is up in the air. Certainly, it's purely, we're just guessing here, but I can tell you 
 
 it's been raining most of the day. The ground is very muddy, and muddy ground is not very good for heavy armor, they can get just stuck in the 
 
 muck.   
 
And therefore, they're going to have to have a period of relative dry. And of course, we've heard that these Spanish-supplied Leopard 2 tanks that are 
 
 just being put on a ship today are expected to reach the front sometime in the end of this month. There are still a lot of equipment in the pipeline 
 
 that has not arrived yet.
 <br>[14:10:00] 
 
And I think until the Ukrainians are confident that they've achieved a critical mass in terms of the amount of weaponry that it can use in this 
 
 offensive, it's not going to happen. So, the Ukrainians, as the deputy defense minister said, they're not going to be publishing a timeline, and 
 
 it could be anywhere between weeks or even longer months. 
 
SOARES:  Yes, and you make a good point -- 
 
WEDEMAN:  Isa? 
 
SOARES:  The logistics of kits, the logistics of this, it does take a long time. Ben Wedeman, thank you very much, Ben, appreciate it. Well, a new 
 
 investigation has found evidence that Russia is operating an apparent fleet of spy ships in Nordic waters. The public broadcaster of Sweden, Denmark, 
 
 Norway and Finland analyzed Intelligence sources, radio communications as well as other data. And they say that some 50 Russian vessels have been 
 
 carrying out spy operations over the past decade, seeking out sites for potential sabotage, such as underwater cables and wind farms. 
 
The Kremlin denies the accusations, calling them baseless. Well, talk about an 11th hour twist just before opening arguments in the defamation case 
 
 against "Fox News", they settled with Dominion Voting Systems for more than $787 million. It is the biggest publicly known defamation payout by a U.S. 
 
 media company in history. 
 
But now, the public won't get to hear, of course, the testimony from "Fox" executives as well as on-air personalities about their 2020 election 
 
 coverage, which, of course, was filled with lies about voter fraud. But it's not the end of "Fox's" new legal woes, and Dominion has other lawsuits 
 
 in the works too. CNN reporter Marshall Cohen joins me now from Wilmington, Delaware. 
 
And Marshall, this is of course, important point out is a significant sum for Dominion and in many ways an embarrassment for "Fox News", but you 
 
 know, it avoided a trial and doesn't have to make any thought, of course, of admission or apology on air. But how critically did they achieve this? 
 
 How was this clinched? Do you have some new information? 
 
MARSHALL COHEN, CNN REPORTER:  That's right, Isa, new details about the last minute push to get this historic settlement, the biggest known 
 
 defamation settlement by a media organization in American history. People familiar with the matter spoke to myself and our colleague Oliver Darcy and 
 
 broke down what happened behind the scenes. Last week, Dominion notified "Fox News" that some of its first witnesses on the stand were going to be 
 
 Rupert Murdoch; the owner of "Fox Corporation", and Tucker Carlson, one of the most prominent hosts on "Fox News". 
 
Those are huge names. After that, there were some talks among the lead trial attorneys over the weekend, but they were according to a source 
 
 incredibly far apart. The talks did not go anywhere. But late Sunday night, they did jointly agree to bring in a mediator, a professional arbitrator 
 
 who knows how to get deals like this done. They call this man Jeffrey Roscoe, he picked up from a cruise. 
 
He was literally on a river cruise from Bucharest to Budapest over in Europe. He got the call, he took the assignment, the group's notified the 
 
 judge, and the judge late Sunday night agreed to give a one day delay to the start of the trial. That was Monday. All day Monday. The people 
 
 familiar with this matter tell us that there were feverish talks back and forth phone calls, shuttle diplomacy, Zoom conferences to try to get an 
 
 agreement. 
 
But there was no deal going into Tuesday, which was yesterday, the start of opening statements expected in the end of jury selection. Everyone was 
 
 expecting this thing to go to trial. There was no deal in hand, Isa. They seated the jury, they swore in the jury and they went to lunch. And we are 
 
 told that during that lunch break yesterday, that's when things really intensified, the final details of the deal were agreed to, everything was 
 
 signed, the "I"s were dotted, the "T"s were crossed. 
 
SOARES:  Yes -- 
 
COHEN:  And in short order, the judge brought everyone back into court, announced the deal, and the case was over. Isa? 
 
SOARES:  Quite, this is very important information. Marshall Cohen, really appreciate it, a win for Dominion, but possibly a win for "Fox News", it 
 
 depends how you see it. Marshall, appreciate it, thank you. I want to turn now to our top story? Of course, we're trying, if you remember to reconnect 
 
 with the World Health Organization Sudan Representative, Dr. Nima Abid, who is in Khartoum. 
 
Doctor, thank you very much, I think we have your connection now. I'm not sure whether you heard my question, but as we reported at the top of the 
 
 hour, the ceasefire has been in place for just over 2 hours, 2 hours and 15 minutes. Just give us a sense of whether it is -- you can hear gunfire or 
 
 whether it's still -- it's still in place. 
 <br>[14:15:00] 
 
No, it seems we do not have unfortunately as you can imagine, the connection as been told, throughout the day, has been pretty unpredictable, 
 
 given of course, that the internet, the electricity keep -- the power keeps -- in and out, intermittent. So, of course -- of course, we'll try again. 
 
 If it doesn't work, we'll try him on the phone with no video. How about that? Still to come tonight, the U.S. Supreme Court is set to weigh in on a 
 
 proposed ban on abortion medication issued by a Texas judge, we'll have the details next. 
 
And Cuba's leader is up for re-election. Will Miguel Diaz-Canel return for a second term? We are heading to Havana, Cuba, when we return. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
SOARES:  Welcome back, everyone. Cuban lawmakers are expected to re-elect the island nation's current leader. The National Assembly is voting today, 
 
 and Miguel Diaz-Canel looks set to get a second term in office. This comes as Cubans face an increasingly bleak economy. Let's go to Havana, Cuba, 
 
 where Patrick Oppmann is standing by for us. Patrick, good to see you. 
 
So Diaz-Canel expected to win a second term, but the challenges, of course, are huge. So do Cubans believe he can deliver this time around, Patrick? 
 
PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, we are waiting for the vote to come back to the National Assembly, which is packed with 
 
 communist party loyalists, it has already voted, but there's really not a lot of suspense. There's only one candidate essentially on the ballot, 
 
 which is Miguel Diaz-Canel. He's already served one term as president. 
 
This would be his second and last term. And certainly, perhaps in any other country, he'll be facing a tough time -- tough time event, because his 
 
 first term, Isa, was anything but smooth. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
 
FIDEL CASTRO, FORMER LATE PRESIDENT OF CUBA:  (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) 
 
OPPMANN (voice-over):  For decades, it was a question that obsessed policymakers from Washington to Moscow, who would succeed the Castros, once 
 
 they left power in Cuba. Only in 2013 did Raul Castro ended speculation by announcing Miguel Diaz-Canel as first vice president and his heir apparent. 
 
"Comrade Diaz-Canel isn't an upstart or an improvisation", he says, "his trajectory has lasted nearly 30 years." An engineer by training and a long-
 
 time communist party bureaucrat is Canel, in 2018 became president of Cuba. The first head of state on the island since the revolution, not named 
 
 Castro. 
 <br>[14:20:00] 
 
But his tenure has been marked by nearly every calamity imaginable. A month after Diaz-Canel took office, Cuba suffered one of the island's worst 
 
 aviation disasters, when a plane operated by the state airline crashed, killing 112 people aboard. U.S. economic sanctions, many of which were 
 
 lifted under the Obama administration were renewed with a vengeance by then President Donald Trump. 
 
Generate shipments of oil from socialist ally, Venezuela, have waned as that country grapples with its own economic meltdown. The pandemic 
 
 shuttered Cuba's tourism industry for the worsening already-widespread shortages of food and medicines. Then on July 11th, 2021, thousands of 
 
 Cubans took to the streets in the largest anti-government demonstrations since the revolution. 
 
Within hours, Diaz-Canel went on state TV to order those still faithful to the government to attack the protesters. "The order to combat has been 
 
 given", he said. "The streets belong to the revolutionaries". The crackdown on protesters led to more economic sanctions from the Biden administration, 
 
 which may have only further unified the communist-run government. 
 
On Wednesday, Cuba's National Assembly will meet, and is widely-expected to approve a second five-year term as president for Diaz-Canel. 
 
CARLOS ALZUGARAY, FORMER CUBAN DIPLOMAT:  This is a city under siege. This is a country under siege. And there are many ways in which Americans would 
 
 look at this rally around the flag, circle the wagons. So the Cuban government is very good at doing that. 
 
OPPMANN:  Diaz-Canel has repeatedly promised that better times are close at hand. But as Cubans leave the island in record numbers, inflation makes 
 
 food increasingly unaffordable and a worsening energy crisis forces people to wait for days to fill up their cars. The question many people have here 
 
 is, when? 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
OPPMANN:  And Isa, as you mentioned, of course, Cubans are looking for some sign that Diaz-Canel has shown that he can certainly hue the line set by 
 
 the Castros if he can essentially modernize his economy, if he can try to reform  this economy as he's not done during the last five years, and if he 
 
 will signal who will replace him, because while it is a historic transition away from the Castros, under Cuban law, Diaz-Canel can at least, be 
 
 president twice, two consecutive terms. 
 
So this would -- we expect be his last term and certainly, as we've seen in the past, this will be about the time when he would begin to signal who 
 
 would succeed him, and it's not clear yet. This is a country where officials stay around for a very long time, who exactly that person would 
 
 be.   
 
They would have to be somebody, probably in their 50s or younger at this point. And it's just not clear who from that younger generation is going to 
 
 step up and assume the mantle. So essentially, many problems to fix before any of that happens. 
 
SOARES:  And when you say that, it makes me want to know already who those candidates -- potential candidates could be, any inkling that you're 
 
 hearing, Patrick, who that might be? 
 
OPPMANN:  You know, already today, you know, they've announced the candidate for the first vice president, and that's a current first vice 
 
 president who was accepted in January, a new long time official, so he'll be in his 80s one would assume by the end of his term, if he's approved, 
 
 that Salvador Velez-Mesa(ph). So we're not seeing a lot of turnover so far suggested, that may come with other positions, other rules. 
 
But Diaz-Canel has been really -- he's not shaken up Raul Castro's team as of yet, we'll see if he does that in his second term if he feels more free 
 
 to do so, certainly, that's going to have to take place sooner rather than later, though. 
 
SOARES:  Yes, full entry, that's for sure. Patrick Oppmann, always great to see you. Thanks, Patrick. While Japan plans to be dumping more than 1 
 
 million tons of treated radioactive waste water into the Pacific Ocean in the coming weeks. It was contaminated in the Fukushima nuclear plant 
 
 disaster more than 12 years ago. Officials insist the water is safe to release.   
 
But fishermen aren't so sure. CNN's Marc Stewart talked with them. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
 
MARC STEWART, CNN REPORTER (voice-over):  It's just after 9:00 in the morning. The crew of this ship is back in port at the Onahama fishing 
 
 village in Fukushima, Japan. Kenzaburo Shiga(ph) is a third generation fisherman, starting at elementary school, going on trips with his father. 
 
 He told me he's happy on the boat, but he faces challenges. His catch is tested for radiation. 
 
That's because the port is around 40 miles from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. In 2011, there was a meltdown here after a 
 
 catastrophic earthquake and tsunami. 
 <br>[14:25:00] 
 
For six years, he couldn't fish, told to stay off the water. When he heard he couldn't fish, he was sad, disappointed the ocean was off limits. 
 
(on camera):  Twelve years later, fishermen face yet another challenge. Treated wastewater that accumulated inside the plant will soon be released 
 
 into the ocean, a threat to their reputation and way of life.   
 
(voice-over):  He says the decision made his blood boil. He wonders why the government made the decision without the consent of the fishermen. At the 
 
 time, the prime minister said it had to be done to decommission the plant. We wanted to see the plant for ourselves, and we were allowed to after 
 
 agreeing to a strict safety protocol. 
 
(on camera):  This is as close as we can get to reactors one through four, the cleanup work here will take at least, 20 more years. 
 
(voice-over):  We also saw a lab where fish are tested. And lots of construction on the water treatment facility. 
 
(on camera):  Let me show you the tanks behind me row after row, enough to feel about 500 Olympic swimming pools. The treated water will be let go 
 
 gradually through a tunnel that will take it offshore and then eventually into the ocean.   
 
(voice-over):  According to the plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power Company, the water has been treated by taking out most of the radioactive 
 
 particles. It's then deluded with seawater, taking it to a level much lower than the World Health Organization's clean drinking water standard.   
 
An official from the utility told us, he recognizes there's distrust because of the past. But they're listening to concerns. He knows not 
 
 everyone will accept their plan, but points out the support they're getting from third parties such as the International Atomic Energy Agency. Still 
 
 neighboring countries have expressed concern.
 
(on camera):  Is there a public health risk by releasing this water? 
 
IAN FAIRLIE, RADIOACTIVE CONSULTANT:  Yes, there is a public health risk. It's relatively low, but the risks exists. I think that they should store 
 
 the water so that it decays naturally.
 
STEWART (voice-over):  Well, other options were considered. This was seen as the best plan as tanks near capacity. Japan's Pacific coast has been a 
 
 point of pride and promise for fishermen like Kenzaburo(ph). He says he doesn't know what will happen, but hopes leaders won't work against the 
 
 fishermen. 
 
The water release is expected to begin by this Summer, bringing with it more years of anxiety and uncertainty. Marc Stewart, CNN, Fukushima, Japan. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE) 
 
SOARES:  And still to come tonight, the clock is ticking. The U.S. Supreme Court has until midnight to rule on proposed restrictions on abortion 
 
 medication. We'll go to Washington D.C. next. Plus, opening the wrong car door and ringing the wrong doorbell. Those are two of the innocent mistakes 
 
 that have gotten an American shot in the last week. Updates on those cases just ahead. You are watching CNN.  
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 <br>[14:30:00]
 
(MUSIC PLAYING)
 
ISA SOARES, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT:  Welcome back, everyone. 
 
If you've been watching the last 30 minutes or so and I hope you have, you would have seen we were trying to connect with a doctor in Khartoum of the 
 
 World Health Organization. 
 
We struggled to contact to reach him, because we've been hearing now there are internet outages across Sudan amid, of course, the ongoing clashes 
 
 between the military and paramilitary forces. 
 
Explains, of course, why we haven't been able to connect. But we do have Dr. Nima Abid in Khartoum on the line. We have managed to get him on the 
 
 phone. 
 
Doctor, thank you very much for your patience and I'm glad we were able to connect with you. The ceasefire has been in place for now, 2.5 hours or so, 
 
 just give us a sense if it's still holding. 
 
DR. NIMA ABID, WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION:  Yes, I mean, now I am not hearing from (INAUDIBLE) tearing (ph) shooting. But it didn't hold actually 
 
 in the last three days. I mean, it never hold, the cease-fire. 
 
So now, the main, the key challenge for the -- in Sudan for the health system and responding to this large number of casualties, which until 
 
 yesterday midnight, it reached almost more than 3,000 injuries and close to 300 deaths and all affected the states in Sudan. 
 
Of course, 60 percent of these casualties from almost. The main challenge is access, whether to the healthcare workers, to go to the (INAUDIBLE) 
 
 facilities, access of the patient, evacuation of the patients and supplies. 
 
I mean, because, I mean, we managed to give supplies for special -- before state minister of health of (INAUDIBLE) and hospital, major hospitals and 
 
 in before, it's (INAUDIBLE) because we are -- we were anticipation, anticipating civil (INAUDIBLE). 
 
But all that assumes that, during the first day of this recent war, actually --
 
SOARES:  Yes.
 
ABID:  -- and now, most of the hospital asking for more supplies and the critical supplies, including the blood, the blood bags (ph) and the IV 
 
 fluid. So this is really, I mean, this is the key challenge that we are facing now is how to provide supply for the (INAUDIBLE) facilities and in 
 
 the (INAUDIBLE) of health and they are working 24 hours. 
 
But the impact is very much affected by the ongoing war. And also, we have the, I mean, quite a good number of health facilities. I mean, attacked 
 
 either by crossfire or intentionally targeted by, I mean, forced evacuation of the patient and using these facilities for military purposes. 
 
SOARES:  Yes. Doctor, let me just interrupt you for a second. I mean, I know that the WHO had joined Sudan's doctors in calling for medical 
 
 facilities to be protected. I want to clarify this. 
 
Are they being to protected? 
 
Are hospitals able to operate?
 
And what is that infrastructure look like?
 
Give us a sense of hospitals that are operational in Khartoum. 
 
ABID:  Yes, now actually, I mean, most of the hospital, I mean, large number are closed, I mean, not functional because of the attacks, of 
 
 security, because of no electricity, water, fuel. And really now we are struggling of getting fuel to at least two (ph) hospital --
 <br>[14:35:00]
 
ABID:  -- to ensure that they are running and operating and providing services to the patients. So, to me, protection of health facilities, 
 
 protection of health workers, giving the access to the ambulances (INAUDIBLE) access, unlimited (ph) access to the supply to health 
 
 facilities, these are extremely important. 
 
Of course, the ultimate solution is by immediate cessation of the -- of the hostilities but at least for now, there should be free access to the 
 
 hospital for the treatment of the injured patients, because now, with the current situation, even mild (INAUDIBLE) injuries will be rather 
 
 threatening because of lack of access to the health services. 
 
SOARES:  Yes, and this is something that we have been here in the last few days from our correspondents (INAUDIBLE) and how contacts on the ground 
 
 that the shortage of medical supplies, sources of clean water and so on. 
 
We have seen fierce clashes overnight in Khartoum and like you quite rightly said, the number of civilian casualties are rising. We heard 
 
 earlier on, and I wonder if you can verify this or clarify this for us, Doctor, that people were unable to bury the dead. 
 
What are you hearing?
 
Is there any truth to that?
 
ABID:  Yes, absolutely. And even before that, we had a problem here in the moors (ph)  and the -- and the burden of the -- of the forensic medicine in 
 
 Sudan. And we were really trying to increase the capacity of the morgues in Sudan.
 
So there is a problem. There is a problem not only in collecting all the dead bodies but also in dealing with them and the forensic medicine 
 
 departments and the major forensic medicine (INAUDIBLE). So there is a problem with that as well, too. 
 
SOARES:  Dr. Nima Abid, really appreciate you taking the time to us. Thank you. It -- speak to us and thank you, of course, for reconnecting with us. 
 
 Do stay safe. Thank you very much, Doctor. 
 
I want to go to United States. Now of course, all eyes are on the Supreme Court as any minute we could get a ruling on a proposed ban for abortion 
 
 medication. 
 
The court is deciding whether to let stand lower court rulings restricting access to a key medication abortion drug. Mifepristone was deemed safe and 
 
 effective by the Food and Drug Administration 23 years ago. CNN justice correspondent Jessica Schneider joins me now from Washington, D.C., to 
 
 explain the details of this case. 
 
So, Jessica, just talk us through the options here, what that could mean critically for women across the United States and of course, that the 
 
 access they could get to mifepristone.
 
JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, it's all up to the Supreme Court right now because the clock is ticking. A ruling is really 
 
 expected in just about the next 10 hours or so, before midnight here in Washington. 
 
So there are a number of options the Supreme Court could go with. But it's likely they'll go one of two ways. 
 
So first they could actually extend this hold that they put on the lower court ruling. And if they do, that means that it will be status quo. Women 
 
 will be able to obtain the abortion pill as usual. No restrictions will go into effect. And this appeals process will continue to play out. 
 
This is what DOJ and the FDA is pushing for here. However, if the Supreme Court does not extend the pause that they have already instituted, a number 
 
 of really impactful restrictions on the abortion pill would take effect. 
 
So first, only women up to seven weeks pregnant would be able to obtain the pill. It's currently up to 10 weeks pregnant. But if these restrictions 
 
 take hold, that time period would drop down to seven weeks. 
 
Second, women would have to see their doctors in person multiple times and then obtain the pill in person. That's different from the way things stand 
 
 now, where women can get a prescription, often via telehealth visit with their doctor, over the computer, over phone and then receive the pill via 
 
 mail. 
 
So now they have to do it all in person. So the FDA, in their court filings, they've really warned the court that there could be this mass 
 
 confusion and chaos if these restrictions are allowed to take effect, mostly because they'll have to completely rebrand the way that this pill is 
 
 marketed. It's something that can't be done overnight, they say. 
 
And production on the pill would really have to be delayed because of these requirements. So there is a lot from FDA, doctors, patients, all bracing 
 
 for the Supreme Court here. 
 
If they don't step in to extend this stay, it could be a lot of changes in the way this abortion pill is administered. And women would really have to 
 
 figure out, in a quick manner, overnight, how the changes will affect them. 
 
SOARES:  What are you hearing then in that case? 
 
I mean, you talk to your doctors, clinicians, the FDA, clearly all bracing for this decision. 
 
But how are they preparing?
 
Are they stockpiling?
 
SCHNEIDER:  Well, that's the problem. They're not quite sure how to prepare. 
 <br>[14:40:00]
 
SCHNEIDER:  We've heard from Democratic led states like New York, for example, stockpiling this drug. So presumably, it could still be available. 
 
 It could, if it's already in stores, if doctors already have it, it could be available. 
 
The issue comes, will doctors be afraid to prescribe it?
 
They fear that maybe they would get penalties from the FDA if they didn't strictly follow -- fall in line with these restrictions. 
 
How long will, the pills that are already out there, how long will they be available?
 
The FDA would have to do a complete overhaul the way this drug is produced and then sent out. So it's really going to create a lot of chaos in the 
 
 marketplace. It will probably be available initially. But then there could be some issues in the days and weeks ahead. 
 
But we'll see if the Supreme Court steps in, to put this -- continue to put this on hold. There won't be any changes. And that's what a lot of people 
 
 are hoping for right now. 
 
SOARES:  And then the appeals process will continue. We wouldn't know how long that would take right? 
 
SCHNEIDER:  Well, there, actually -- that's a good point. The appeals process is going to move forward on this. And the 5th Circuit is actually 
 
 moving very quickly on this. They have already set up this expedited schedule, where they're fast tracking it. 
 
And they would hear oral arguments in less than month on May 17th. So presumably, you know, this could get decided by the 5th Circuit and then it 
 
 could work its way up to the Supreme Court. 
 
However, the timeline here is that the Supreme Court actually probably wouldn't hear this case until next term, which starts in October. So 
 
 there's a little bit in flux, even though they're trying to move fast on the appeals process. 
 
SOARES:  Jessica Schneider, thanks very much for breaking it all down, appreciate it, Jessica. 
 
And we're back after this short break.

SOARES:  A cheerleader in the hospital and a suspect under arrest in Texas. It is the latest shooting that's resulted from an apparent innocent mistake 
 
 in the United States. Payton Washington was shot when one of her teammates accidentally got into a stranger's car that she had mistaken for her own. 
 
The person in that mistaken car, 25 year old Pedro Rodriguez, got out and started shooting at the cheerleaders, who were back in their original 
 
 vehicle. Rodriguez was arrested and charged with a third degree felony. 
 
A teammate involved in the incident spoke at a prayer vigil describing that situation. Have a listen.

HEATHER ROTH, SHOOTING VICTIM:  As we're backing up, I see the guy get out of the passenger door. And I rolled my window down and I was trying to 
 
 apologize to him. And then he -- I just halfway --
 <br>[14:45:00]
 
ROTH:  -- my window is down. He just threw his hands up and then he pulled out a gun and he just started shooting at all of us. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
SOARES:  Well, that was in Texas. To Missouri now. The man accused of shooting 16 year old Ralph Yarl is in court this hour; 84 year old Andrew 
 
 Lester is being arraigned on two felony counts for shooting Yarl after he - - after the teen mistakenly rang the wrong doorbell. 
 
Meanwhile a spokesman for the victim's family shared this new picture and called Ralph a walking miracle. The Instagram post says Yarl suffered 
 
 traumatic brain injury but he's healing well and expected to make a full recovery. 
 
In the last week, we have seen three separate cases of armed civilians in the United States, shooting first and then asking questions later. These 
 
 situations could come down to what some states call stand your ground laws, CNN's Josh Campbell explains. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The defendant is charged with armed criminal action.
 
JOSH CAMPBELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Eighty-four-year old Andrew Lester surrendering to authorities after allegedly shooting 16-year-old 
 
 Ralph Yarl, a Black teen shot by a white homeowner in Missouri, reviving the fierce debate over "Stand Your Ground" laws.
 
LEE MERRITT, ATTORNEY FOR YARL FAMILY:  He looked out of the door. He saw a Black boy and he feared for his life. And that's something that we've heard 
 
 a lot in American jurisprudence.
 
CAMPBELL (voice-over):  Yarl accidentally went to the wrong address to pick up his siblings. A probable cause document says Lester believed it was a 
 
 break-in, that he shot twice within a few seconds.
 
In Missouri, a person may use physical force if he or she, quote, "reasonably believes such force to be necessary in self-defense."
 
SHAN WU, CNN LEGAL ANALYST:  I think the problem for this defendant is the lack of any actions on the part of the victim who got shot that it would 
 
 appear to be threatening.
 
CAMPBELL (voice-over):  At least 28 states have some kind of "Stand Your Ground" law on the books, providing legal protections for those in danger. 
 
 Prosecutors across the nation have aggressively pursued charges against those they believe abused weapons without facing an immediate threat.
 
Saturday in New York, 20-year old Kaylan Gillis was fatally shot by a homeowner, after she and friends accidentally turned into the wrong 
 
 driveway.
 
SHERIFF JEFFREY MURPHY, WASHINGTON COUNTY, NEW YORK:  There's clearly no threat from anyone in the vehicles.
 
CAMPBELL (voice-over):  Kevin Monahan was taken into custody and is now charged with second degree murder but his attorney told CNN he was in fear 
 
 after seeing multiple vehicles speeding up his driveway.
 
Mark and Patricia McCloskey drew national attention in June 2020, claiming they were defending their Missouri mansion, brandishing guns and pointing 
 
 them at protesters demanding police reform. They pled guilty to misdemeanor charges. 
 
For Kyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year old who fatally shot two protesters in 2020, a fear for his own life was key to his defense.
 
KYLE RITTENHOUSE, DEFENDANT:  If I would have let Mr. Rosenbaum take my firearm for me, he would have used it and killed me with it and probably 
 
 killed more people.
 
CAMPBELL (voice-over):  Rittenhouse was ultimately acquitted. But perhaps most famously tested Florida's "Stand Your Ground" law, which like 
 
 Missouri, permits the use of deadly force to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm.
 
MARK O'MARA, DEFENSE LAWYER FOR GEORGE ZIMMERMAN:  That's a unique law because it says to a potential shooter, don't worry about, you know, 
 
 running or turning away or backing up. You can shoot.
 
CAMPBELL (voice-over):  In 2012 neighborhood watch Captain George Zimmerman shot and killed 17 year old Trayvon Martin, who had just left a local 
 
 convenience store. 
 
Zimmerman called 9-1-1 to report a, quote, "suspicious person," and ignored the dispatcher's warning not to approach the individual, ultimately getting 
 
 into a confrontation and shooting Martin in what Zimmerman described as self-defense.
 
GEORGE ZIMMERMAN, TRAYVON MARTIN KILLER:  Help me, help me. I felt his arm going down to my side and I grabbed it and I just grabbed my firearm for 
 
 sure.
 
CAMPBELL (voice-over):  He was tried and acquitted by a Florida jury.

SOARES:  And that was Josh Campbell reporting there. 
 
And still to come tonight, the backlash after a CEO tells a company staff to leave "Pity City." Anna Stewart joins me to explain.
 
(MUSIC PLAYING)
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:50:00]
 
(MUSIC PLAYING) 
 
SOARES:  Well, it is bonus season for a lot of employees around the world and staffers at MillerKnoll furniture company asked their boss how to stay 
 
 motivated if they don't receive one. Fair question. 
 
Their boss' pep talk might not have landed the way she'd hoped. Have a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDI OWEN, CEO, MILLERKNOLL:  Don't ask about what are we going to do if we don't get a bonus.
 
(INAUDIBLE) on $26 million. Spend your time and your effort thinking about the $26 million we need and not thinking about what you're going to do if 
 
 you don't get a bonus. 
 
I had an old boss who said to me one time, you can visit pity city but you can't live there. So people, leave pity city. Let's get it done. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SOARES:  Well, for context, CNN learned that she took home nearly $5 million in compensation last year. MillerKnoll says her comments were taken 
 
 out of context, saying it hasn't yet decided on bonus payments. Anna Stewart joins me now to discuss this further. 
 
And I think, I mean, we heard the whole -- the whole spiel, the whole thing and it was -- it started reasonably well. She started motivating her staff, 
 
 saying the right things. And then it deteriorated. 
 
What happened?
 
ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Let's give her some gee like tough love works sometimes. And this is a tricky environment for a company that makes 
 
 office furniture with so many people working from home. But this was a question about bonuses. 
 
And, yes, the answer to this started with stuff like the CEO saying, you need to focus on the things you can control, treat each other well --
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
STEWART:  -- respect --
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
STEWART:  --  this pivotal moment, where she suddenly changes just made you think might be funny. You can visit pity city. But don't stay there and 
 
 then actually, it ends with a mike drop. 
 
SOARES:  She actually does -- she actually did that on camera, which, to me, was very condescending. 
 
What is  -- what is the company saying about these comments that have now gone viral?
 
STEWART:  Yes, this isn't the way you want to get your company's name out there. It's a big list of companies that lots of people hadn't heard about 
 
 it until now. 
 
So first of all, we have no response from the CEO herself in terms of everyone wants to speak to her to find out more about these comments, no 
 
 interviews. But we do have the comment from the spokesperson, who says, the bit we have shown everyone is taken out of context. 
 
It comes in the midst of a sort of 70-minute town hall, that there were some positive things out there and also that bonuses haven't been decided 
 
 yet, either for the employees, who averagely earn around $45,000, or for the CEO, who earned more than $5 million last year, $1 million in base pay, 
 
 the rest on stock options and bonus payments. 
 
So I think everyone will be looking forward to see what happens with these bonus --
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
SOARES:  -- exactly whether she even gets a bonus this year after all this. But one, I'm not defending her here. There's a lot of pressure, of course, 
 
 to try and meet these targets. Or maybe she may have a contract already set in place with the bonus. We do not know that. I'm not defending her 
 
 comments. 
 
But I think it also speaks to the crisis that you report often on business shows, which is cost of living crisis, high inflation, somewhat tone deaf. 
 
STEWART:  Tone deaf. This is a time when people are struggling to meet their bills, with inflation really high, interest rates also really high. 
 
 So anyone with a mortgage or a bank loan or credit card debt is thinking very carefully about how they're going to afford the next few months. 
 <br>[14:55:00]
 
STEWART:  So something like a bonus, which you may have considered baked in for the next year, is really important. 
 
You know how office rumors go around. I'm sure everyone wants to know at this company, are we going to get our bonuses, given the company's perhaps 
 
 not performing as well as it should do. So it's a natural question. 
 
SOARES:  And what you want is something inspirational, not really telling you to leave pity city. Anna, appreciate it. Thanks very much. 
 
Now one pizza delivery guy is proving that not all heroes wear capes after an average day at work saw him serving up a slice of justice. 
 
This is the moment that Tyler Morrell, you can see there, found himself in the midst of a police chase as he was delivering a pizza. After the stolen 
 
 car went out of control, Tyler  sprung into action, tripping up the fleeing suspect, allowing officers to catch him. 
 
And the best part, he did it all without dropping the pizza. And asked about his heroic deed, Tyler said, "I was like, I can't do anything with my 
 
 hands because I'm holding the pizza so I just stuck my leg out." 
 
Give that man a great tip. That is really good motivation there. He doesn't have to go to pity city. That's for sure. 
 
And that does it for me. Thanks very much for staying with us. You stay right here. QUEST MEANS BUSINESS is next.
