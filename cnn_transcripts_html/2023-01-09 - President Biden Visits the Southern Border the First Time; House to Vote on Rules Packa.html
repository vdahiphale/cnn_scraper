(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN HOST:  Hello and welcome to our viewers here in the United States and all around the world. I'm Rosemary Church. Just ahead on "CNN Newsroom," President Biden at the border, yet he somehow managed not to meet any migrants. We will look at how he's dealing with an issue that is angering both the right and the left. 
 
Insurrection in Brazil, protesters stormed top government offices and scenes eerily similar to those on January 6 in Washington.
 
And tributes across the country to U.S. football's Damar Hamlin. We'll bring you highlights from a game that couldn't have been scripted any better for his Buffalo Bills as the fights to recover from cardiac arrest. 
 
Good to have you with us. Well, one of the most controversial issues he faces back home will be front and center when U.S. President Joe Biden attends a regional summit. Mr. Biden has arrived in Mexico City where he will meet with his counterparts from Mexico and Canada later today. They will cover a number of pressing topics including the recent surge in migration. 
 
The president addressed that issue on Sunday when he visited the U.S. border in El Paso, Texas. He spoke with workers at a migrant processing center, but notably he did not appear to meet with migrants themselves. A senior administration official told CNN that was completely coincidental that the center did not have any that day.
 
Mr. Biden also inspected the iron fence between Mexico and the U.S. and pledged more government support. It comes as he faces criticism for failing to address the spike in border crossings. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GREG ABBOTT, GOVERNOR OF TEXAS:  The president who caused the chaos in the border needed to be here. It just so happens is two years and about $20 billion too late. This is nothing but for show unless he begins to enforce the immigration laws already that exist in the United States of America, that are contained in a letter that was provided to the president today.

CHURCH:  Back in Washington, U.S. House Republicans face a new hurdle following last week's grueling fight to elect a new speaker. It's an important vote on the rules package which establishes the rules and committees for the 118th Congress and how Congress will govern over the next two years under Republican control. 
 
The rules package includes some of the concessions Kevin McCarthy made in order to win enough support from his fellow Republicans to secure the speakership. One major concession allows for any lawmaker to call for a vote to remove the speaker at any time. Some Republicans worry it will weaken McCarthy's hand.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. ANDY BARR (R-KY):  Certainly, it's going to be challenge to have a conference full of independent thinkers with a thin majority. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH:  Well, meantime, the new House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries says he's ready to work with Republicans in the wake of McCarthy's chaotic scramble to the speakership. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY):  We look forward to trying to find some reasonable Republicans who are willing to break from the extreme elements of the conference to do the business of the American people.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
CHURCH:  And joining me now from Los Angeles, CNN legal analyst and civil rights attorney Areva Martin and political commentator and radio show host Mo Kelly. Good to see you both. 
 
MO KELLY, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  Good evening. 
 
AREVA MARTIN, CNN LEGAL ANALYST:  Hi, Rosemary. 
 
CHURCH:  So, Mo Kelly, it took Kevin McCarthy 15 votes to eventually win the much-coveted post of House speaker. But he's (inaudible) not over yet with the House to vote today on a rules package to lay out how the Congress functions over the next two years. So, what can we expect from that vote, do you think? 
 
KELLY:  Well, I would expect more chaos. I mean, Dr. King said it best, that a genuine leader is a molder of consensus, not a searcher for consensus. I mean, right now, Kevin McCarthy doesn't even have unity within his own conference and I'm not sure they respect him or even like him. And if anything, he's made it what I would call a doubles grand bargain with his own conference of Freedom Caucus.
 
And I'm not so sure that they're even going to even stay within the bargains that they have, these concessions that he's made. So, I would expect more chaos than anything. 
 <br>[02:05:03]
 
CHURCH:  Interesting. And Areva, take us through the House rules vote process, and of course, the concessions made by McCarthy to that small band of extreme right-wing Republicans. Did he give away too much power rendering himself essentially a lame duck?
 
MARTIN:  Yeah, it seems that way, Rosemary. We don't know all of the particulars about what the deal is and I think Mo is right when he says that the deal that was made, basically with the devil. What we do know, however though, is that the extremists in the Republican Party now have more control than they've ever had. 
 
And they have vowed to use that power to do things such as make it very difficult for the government to raise the debt ceiling, which could cause incredible economic turmoil not only in the United States but across the world. They have vowed to make cuts to programs like social security and health care. And they've also vowed to engage in what we know would be these very baseless investigations. 
 
They call it investigating the weaponization of the FBI. They're going to not only try to investigate the FBI but also the Justice Department, and potentially those investigations that are going on in the Justice Department against Donald Trump will become the subject of the Republicans as they set out on this course to, you know, engage in these endless investigations. So, I think we have a lot more turmoil ahead of us. 
 
CHURCH:  And Mo, President Joe Biden visited the southern border Sunday, his first time there as president. Why did it take so long and what did his visit actually achieve, if anything, considering he didn't meet with any migrants? 
 
KELLY:  Well, let's be honest. The immigration issue is a losing issue for the Democrats. And I think to be fair, some of that is the Democrats fault. We can go back to former President Barack Obama who campaigned not once, but twice, two different terms on immigration reform, comprehensive immigration reform. He never attempted it in earnest, and he obviously never got it done. 
 
And now it falls to Joe Biden. And showing up at the border is acknowledging the problem, but without comprehensive immigration reform, it will not get better for him or the country more broadly. There's the issue of the migrants who are at the border right now. There is the issue of the undocumented people still within America from years past and there's the issue of the people who have yet to come to the border. And the Democrats don't seemingly have any answers or options right now. 
 
CHURCH:  And Areva, President Biden's trip to the border came as this humanitarian crisis is worsening, migrants sleeping on the cold streets of El Paso. But did Mr. Biden see the real crisis, given he didn't actually visit migrants, he didn't talk to migrants on the streets, but instead saw a much more sanitize version of the situation at the border, didn't he? 
 
MARTIN:  Yeah. Despite what may have happened on this one trip, no doubt Joe Biden has a very clear understanding about the gravity of the migrant crisis that the U.S. is facing, but I don't think it's fair to try to place all the blame on the Democrats with respect to the immigration issues that we currently face in the United States. 
 
The Republicans like to complain a lot, they like to make theater and drama with the immigration crisis, like sending immigrants to the vice president's house, sending them to Washington, sending to them to New York, sending them to other states, but they do very little. 
 
When they had control of the House, when they had Donald Trump in the White House, they took very little action to actually do anything with respect to the immigration crisis. So, I don't think we should blame the Democrats, without looking at the blame that should be placed on the Republicans as well. 
 
And given how fractured the Republican Party is at this point, we should not expect there to be any efforts on the part of the Republicans to address not only the immigration issues, but other issues such as the economy, voting suppression. There are so many issues that are important to the American people.
 
If they cannot elect a leader without 15 attempts, and without almost coming to blows on the floor of the U.S. Congress, I don't think we should expect anything from the Republican-led Congress.
 
CHURCH:  And Mo, next year the president goes to Mexico for a summit. He will meet with that country's leader and others to discuss migrants at the border as well as drug smuggling and improving security along the border. What do expect come out of that summit? 
 
KELLY:  Very little. I would expect a press conference and I want to acknowledge what Areva said. It is true. It's not just the problem of the Democrats. The Republicans did have an opportunity to address this and failed to do so. But to answer your question, Rosemary, directly, I don't think much will come out of it, because yes there is something that we can do possibly with our allies to make sure that fewer people may approach the border.
 
But we still have to deal with the issue inside of America because people are still going to come seeking asylum and more, and our laws have not changed and there's no reason for their behavior to change, as far as approaching America. 
 <br>[02:09:56]
 
CHURCH:  And Areva, what do you think is achievable at the border and is any political will to help the more desperate migrants, waiting anxiously at the border for some movement on Title 42. 
 
MARTIN:  Sadly, Rosemary, I don't think there's a will in this country to do anything. And as long as we remain as fractured as we are between Democrats and Republicans, and Republicans within their own party, I don't think we're going to see much movement as it relates to the immigrant crisis. 
 
Hopefully, they will continue to be humanitarian. Efforts to help people who are coming into this country and hopefully will stop at the hypocrisy. All of these attacks on immigrants, but yet no recognition of the tremendous role that they play in the building and the sustaining of so many industries in this country. 
 
CHURCH:  All right, Mo Kelly, Areva Martin, many thanks to you both for joining us. Appreciate it. 
 
KELLY:  Thank you.
 
CHURCH:  Well, Mr. Biden also reacted to protests in Brazil that are drawing comparisons to the January 6th riots at the U.S. capitol. A top Brazilian official says the riots in Brasilia are now over, hours after hundreds of supporters of former leader, Jair Bolsonaro, stormed key government buildings.
 
The tension and unrest filled into the night with police using tear gas to disperse the crowd. Earlier, the protesters breached security barriers and broke into Congress, the Presidential Palace, and the Supreme Court. One official says at least 400 people have been arrested. 
 
World leaders are condemning the violence and expressing their support for Brazil's newly elected president, Lula da Silva. President Biden called the situation an assault on democracy and on the peaceful transfer of power in Brazil. 
 
Brazil's Supreme Court has now ordered the armed forces to dismantle all camps belonging to Bolsonaro supporters across the country within 24 hours and is calling on police to arrest any protesters still left inside. CNN's Rafael Romo is tracking developments and has more now on the arrest in the capital. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
RAFAEL ROMO, CNN SENIOR LATIN AFFAIRS EDITOR (voice-over):  Brazil boiling over, supporters of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro stormed key buildings in the country's capital Sunday, breaching security barriers and temporarily occupying the country's Congress, Presidential Palace, and Supreme Court. 
 
Masses of protesters flooded the country's seat of power, many dressed in the colors of Brazil's flag, yellow and green, fueled by anger and distress over Bolsonaro's defeat in a runoff election last October where he lost by less than 2 percentage points to current president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. 
 
Protesters threw objects and scaled the roofs of buildings while clashing with police who responded with tear gas. At least one protester was seen sitting at the desk of Brazil's congress president. CNN Brazil reports the floor of the congress building was flooded after the sprinkler system activated when protesters attempted to set fire to the carpet. By evening, police began dispersing the rioters from buildings and
 
 arrested hundreds of people who were detained in buses before being taken to the police station. President Lula da Silva who was inaugurated just a week ago, described the events as barbaric and vow to punish the people responsible.
 
LUIZ INACIO LULA DA SILVA, PRESIDENT OF BRAZIL (through translation): Those people that we call fascists, we call them everything that's abominable in politics. They invade the government headquarters and they invaded the Congress like vandals, destroying everything in their path.
 
ROMO (voice-over):  President Lula da Silva also blamed his predecessor for the lack of security in the capital where Bolsonaro's supporters have been camped out for over a week. Bolsonaro who is currently in Florida, denounced what he called depredations and invasions of public buildings in a tweet, adding that peaceful and lawful demonstrations are part of democracy. 
 
But critics say Bolsonaro may have stirred up the crowds by repeatedly saying without evidence, that he questioned the integrity of the country's electronic voting system. 
 
(On camera):  The intensity of Sunday's protest shows that last year's presidential election is still unfinished business for some resilience and a sign of just how divided the country is. Rafael Romo, CNN, Atlanta.

CHURCH:  The NFL's Buffalo Bills treated fans to an absolute thriller in their first game since teammate, Damar Hamlin, suffered a cardiac arrest last week. They defeated their division rivals, the New England Patriots, 35 to 23 on Sunday and Hamlin got to see it all, watching the game from his hospital bed in Cincinnati while tweeting out his support. 
 
Hamlin was in the thoughts and prayers of NFL fans and players throughout the country as they each did their own tribute to Hamlin during the last week of the regular season. The highlights and details from the Bills' emotional victory, here's Coy Wire.
 
COY WIRE, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT:  This was no longer just a game against Division rivals, New England Patriots, with playoff implication. This was a celebration of life as Bills' head coach Sean McDermott described it. 
 <br>[02:15:03] Buffalo's first game since number three, Damar Hamlin, suffered cardiac arrest on the field earlier this week. As players ran out of the tunnel, the power of three was everywhere. Players holding flags, wearing patches. Fans holding handcrafted signs and it was quite the emotional moment when Damar's image popped up on the jumbotron. Also, a powerful moment, when the medical workers and training staff who (inaudible) with poise and precision to save Damar's life, were honored, getting an ovation as loud as I've ever heard. Then, on the opening play of the game, goosebumps. Here is what
 
 happened on the Bills' first play since that tragic injury, as told by Bills' play by play announcer, Chris Brown.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
CHRIS BROWN, BUFFALO BILLS PLAY BY PLAY ANNOUNCER:  He ended at the four by Hines, coming straight at the middle to the 20. Cuts it back in the 25. He's got an alley down the right sideline to the 40, 50, down to the 40, 35, 30, 20, 15, 10, five. Touchdown Nyheim Hines! 96 yards!
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WIRE:  It had been three years and three months since the Bills have last done that, taking a kickoff after a touchdown. Hamlin, watching from the hospital, tweeting, "God behind all this. No coincidences."   
 
But that wasn't all. Nyheim Hines would return another kick off for a touchdown, for a second of the game, something that hadn't been done since 2010 in, you guessed it, week number three. Bills would go on to win 35-23. Next stop playoffs. Here's Bill's star quarterback Josh Allen with his reaction to that movie script like touchdown on the opening play of the game. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOSH ALLEN, BUFFALO BILLS QUARTERBACK:  Well, the truth is spiritual, it really was. Bone-chilling like it is special. The whole way I think the nation came together in support of Damar and, you know, we've had a lot of talks that maybe we wouldn't have had without something like this happening. And I -- I was just told by Kevin Kearns (ph), it's been three years and three months since the last kickoff return. So, it's pretty cool.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
WIRE:  There is something pretty cool happening here in Buffalo. It's been an emotional rollercoaster for this team, for the city, from the tears of fear to start the week to the tears of joy and outpouring of support we see now. But one heart may have stopped, but made the whole world come together to beat as one for now. 
 
CHURCH:  So true. And meanwhile, the toy drive started by Damar Hamlin, continues to blow away expectations, has now topped $8.5 million dollars in donations. Keep in mind he was hoping to raise a mere $2,500 when he started that fundraiser for kids in May just over two years ago.
 
Well, more bad weather is heading to parts of California as people there try to recover from days of heavy rain, destructive winds, and power outages. We're back with that in just a moment. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:20:00] CHURCH:  Well, parts of California are gearing up for more bad weather with heavy rains and gusty winds again this week. Thousands of homes and businesses are without power after high winds knocked down trees and power lines last week. At least seven people were killed in the storm. And the threat is not over. 
 
Forecasters are warning of a relentless parade of cyclones until midweek, and flood watches remain in effect for over 15 million people. California's governor says he plans to request approval from the White House for a federal emergency declaration. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GAVIN NEWSOM, GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA:  We're anticipating some very intense weather coming in tomorrow, tomorrow evening in particular into the early hours of Tuesday morning. And that's the imperative that we're trying to express here, is the seriousness of purpose in terms of just being safe and being thoughtful.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
CHURCH:  Officials in San Francisco are concerned more rain could cause sinkholes and mudslides. CNN's Camila Bernal has that part of the story.
 
CAMILA BERNAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  This is the calm before the storm. The problem is less and less time between these storms. Officials here in San Francisco telling people to be ready for power outages and for possibly very dangerous driving conditions. The ground is already saturated, so when you add more rain to all of this, there's the possibility of mudslides and even sinkholes, two things that have already happened here in San Francisco. 
 
Officials also say that they're very concerned about communication and outages there. Here is the executive director of San Francisco's Department of Emergency Services. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MARY ELLEN CARROLL, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, SAN FRANCISCO DEPARTMENT OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT:  Many of the infrastructure for -- even communications, that's our cell and internet, is underground. And so, as we get more inundation from the rain, we're seeing more failure around those what we call lifeline systems. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BERNAL:  And last week, downtown San Francisco had the wettest 10-day period on record since 1871. We are expecting more rain over the next couple of days. Already, meteorologist saying that they saw about a foot of rain since December 1st. 
 
Now they're saying 3 to 5 more inches in the next five days. Many people here especially near the ocean already preparing with sandbags. But the reality is a lot of people in this area just don't know how to deal with this amount of rain. Camila Bernal, CNN, San Francisco. CHURCH:  Meantime, weather officials say the multiple storm systems
 
 have set the stage for what could become a high impact event. CNN meteorologist Derek Van Dam explains. 
 
DEREK VAN DAM, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  Yeah, that's right. Anytime you hear the National Weather Service office from San Francisco use terminology like high impact event, you know the storm means business. Just look at this water vapor imagery. Here's the state of California. It looks like mother nature is about to go bolling. It looks like she's about to throw a strike into the state of California with that bowling ball right there, with a little pressure, right?
 <br>[02:25:01] 
 
It's literally directing a plume of moisture into the central and northern portions of the state. And this will not be a 12-hour event. We're talking about 48 hours or more of relentless rain and snow as well as wind. Weather prediction center picking up on that. They have increased their area of coverage of a moderate risk. That's a level three of four for flash flooding from San Francisco southward into Los Angeles.
 
And by the way, that extends into Tuesday for southern California in and around L.A. About 30 million people impacted by this with flood alerts stretching from north all the way to south as this plume of moisture oscillates from the north to the south from Monday into the day on Tuesday. 
 
And then another round of precipitation sets up behind it. I'm showing you these rainfall totals over the past two weeks just to hammer it home to you that it has been extremely wet for California lately, right? We're approaching and exceeding 10 inches of rainfall in the past two weeks for downtown San Francisco.  
 
So, cumulatively, any additional rain will lead to, well, let's see, excessive runoff. Let's say high river flows, right? Well, that's in fact the forecast for these rain gauges. Anywhere you see that shading of purple, they're anticipating major flood stages for some of the rivers in and around central California. Rainfall totals here with this latest atmospheric river event, 4 to 6 inches right along the coast, and snowfall will be measured in feet. 
 
If you are traveling along Interstate 80 from Reno to Sacramento, for instance, find alternative plans because it'll be next to impossible. And by the way, those totals in (inaudible) mountain, those are not typos, over 90 inches, maybe 5 feet or more for those locations.  It's not only rain, not only snow. The vulnerable areas, the high altitudes of the Sierra Nevada Mountain range could see wind gusts in excess of 100 miles per hour that will make travel virtually impossible for those locations. Of course, this amount of rain has done quite a dent in our drought monitor. Last week we had 7 percent exceptional drought. That has all been erased. Back to you. 
 
CHURCH:  All right, thanks so much, Derek. Well, Brazil's most essential government buildings, are now secure after security forces arrested hundreds of protesters who violently stormed those buildings. We will have a live report from Sao Paulo right after the break. Do stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:30:43]
 
CHURCH: Welcome back, everyone. Well, more now on one of our biggest stories this hour, Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has visited the Presidential Palace and the Supreme Court, and he is vowing to punish hundreds of protesters hours after supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro reached security barriers and stormed into both of those buildings as well as congress.
 
Some smashed windows and use furniture as barricades against security forces. Police used tear gas to get things under control and have arrested at least 400 people. President Lula da Silva called the unrest barbaric and Bolsonaro also denounced what he called the invasions of public buildings. And now the country's supreme court has ordered all Bolsonaro supporters camps to be demolished and protesters there arrested within 24 hours.
 
So, let's get more now from CNN Brazil's Anne Barbosa who joins us live from Sao Paulo. So, Anne, parallels have been made between what happened in Brazil's capital Sunday and what played out here on the United States of the Capitol on January 6, 2021 with far-right supporters of former President Bolsonaro storming the capital protesting October's election results. And while the leadership style of Bolsonaro has often been compared to that of Donald Trump's.
 
Bolsonaro actually did condemn the violence. Is it fair to say that this was Brazil's January 6 or not?
 
ANNE BARBOSA, CNN REPORTER: The moment is different but definitely it's -- yes to say that is our January 6 there (INAUDIBLE) it's good to be talking with you, here the last information from Brazil. Actually, I dare to say that what we faced yesterday is even worse, what you have, like two years ago just because not just the National Congress was stormed, but also the Presidential Palace and the Supreme Court.
 
They involved like they get attacked and this three main building was invaded by these people in Brazil. Actually, it all starts like 3:00 p.m. on Sunday here and people that supports Jair Bolsonaro, they didn't accept to that he lost the election in last October. And then they invaded. There's three buildings that is located in Brasilia, the capital of Brazil. I think for those who don't know that place, this building are located at the same square in Brazilian capital in Brasilia.
 
We call in Portuguese is Tres Poderes Square. In English, it means three powers and people were there. Polish office tried to use gas tears at the beginning. They didn't -- they couldn't repeal the people they failed. And after a long day, policies could clear this building and President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. He wasn't at the capital. He was at the city Araraquara. It was in the counter side of the state in Sao Paulo. And he said actually who Lula decrease federal intervention after terrorist attacks. And for that reason, we have at least 300 people was arrested until now, but actually police are investigating to identify more people that we actually know that participated of this invaded in the -- in the -- in the capital of Brazil. These people they support Jair Bolsonaro. They were camping at the capital of Brazil like since last October when Jair Bolsonaro lost the election to the President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
 
CHURCH: All right. Anne Barbosa, many thanks for bringing us up to date on the situation there. Appreciate it.
 
Well, Ukraine is denying claims from Moscow that hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers were killed in a recent airstrike. That story and the latest from the frontline ahead it in a live report.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:38:12]
 
CHURCH: Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy is praising the resistance of two eastern cities despite their near total destruction. In his nightly address Sunday, Mr. Zelenskyy said Bakhmut and Soledar were holding out against Russian attacks, despite being among "the bloodiest places on the front line."
 
Also on Sunday, Ukraine and Russia exchange 100 prisoners of war, 50 from each side. This is the 36th such swap. Meantime Ukraine is dismissing Moscow's claims that a Russian striker killed hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers in Kramatorsk.
 
A CNN team saw no indication of massive casualties in the area. And CNN Correspondent Nina dos Santos joins us now live from London with more. Good morning to you, Nina. So, Ukraine says there's not evidence or no evidence I should say to back up Russia's claims that a large number of key soldiers were killed in a Russian attack. What more are you learning about this?
 
NINA DOS SANTOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, independent journalists chose me who have been to the scene and visited this supposed set of barracks that Russia claims that it hit. It also claims that 600 Soldiers of the Ukrainian army were killed in this particular strike. And independent journalists and various observers have said, well, there's no evidence that soldiers were actually sleeping there. And there's no evidence of casualty blood on the scenes.
 
And there's also no evidence that these particular missiles, rockets, if you like, actually hit the buildings at all. It seemed as though some of them actually missed their original target. So, this claim has now appeared to have been rubbished both by Ukraine that appears to have been confirmed by various supporters, including as you said there, CNN. The question is, why would Russia put forward these claims?
 <br>[02:40:01] Well, it might well be for their domestic political audience because remember just a week or so ago on New Year's Day Russia eventually had to admit that 89 of its soldiers had been killed after a strike by Ukraine on barracks where they were staying or an encampment if you like. Many of them were conscripts, if not most of them. And there was this embarrassing incident where Russia appeared to initially blame these particular soldiers for having been detected, saying that they had been using their cell phones in a manner that they weren't supposed to be doing.
 
And as such, their positions had been detected. That was swiftly rebuffed by Ukraine as well. So, there's a bit of a propaganda and disinformation game going on here. As of course, the west continues and Ukraine continues to be on high alert for a mobilization of Russian counter offensive now that this unilateral ceasefire has come and gone. Over the course of the Orthodox Christmas weekend.
 
One that was floated by Russia, rebuffed again, by Ukraine as a ploy to regroup and rearm by Moscow. And also, people looking further afield as the anniversary of this invasion gets going. Obviously, there's concerns that there should be some accountability for Russian troops for their actions there. And that is why we're now seeing talk of a big meeting of the International Criminal Court and various justice ministers set to take place in the U.K. in the next couple of months. Rosemary?
 
CHURCH: All right. Nina dos Santos, many thanks for that report. Appreciate it.
