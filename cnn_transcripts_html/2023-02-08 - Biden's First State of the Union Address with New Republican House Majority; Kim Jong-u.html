BIANCA NOBILO, CNN ANCHOR: ... It seemed like this was America first and the rest of the world a very much second. 
 
LESLIE VINJAMURI, HEAD OF U.S. AND AMERICAS PROGRAMME, CHATHAM HOUSE: It really was and it wasn't so much about, you know, America matters more than the rest the world, it was just a complete absence of talking about the rest of the world for so long. There was, you know, two thirds of the way and he turns to Russia and China. There's a word on global challenges. 
 
But so much of this was really about unifying America. Making sure that manufacturing comes back to America, about the dignity of work. And it was about a certain kind of America. And also, it was about middle class Americans, working Americans, ensuring that they capture the gains of their productivity, of their own work, that they are free. 
 
He has that moment where he says, you know, you need to be able to compete. You need to be able to cross the road if the person across the road offers you a better salary. So, we're taking away the restrictions that have made it harder for you to thrive or taxing corporations or taxing billionaires. So, it really was, as you said, it really wasn't about the rest the world. But there was some acknowledgements that America is going to really focus on itself and rebuild. In part, in order to contribute to those big global challenges. 
 
NOBILO: And that significant focus on domestic issues is consistent with somebody thinking ahead to reelection. It was also a particularly energized performance by President Biden standards. What else could we extrapolate from the State of the Union in terms of how he might approach reelection bid. 
 
VINJAMURI: Yes, I think you're absolutely right. He was signaling that he's an energize president. He knew what we then saw, right, was the attacks from Sara Huckabee on his age. He demonstrated high energy. He seemed really together and confident. And he was signaling, you know, let us get the job done, let me finish what I've done. So, he outlines all the things that he's done to invest in infrastructure, to invest in semiconductor chips, bringing that production back home, keeping America safe, keeping America competitive. But the job is not. 
 
And so, this is a president who wants the American people to come together to support him, to finish that job. Those bipartisan bills that many of which -- and it was amazing actually, given how divided America is to listen to that list of bipartisan legislation that has actually passed. Not something we think about. And then he also then turn to democracy. 
 
And he said, you know, democracy should not be a partisan issue, our democracy is not broken. Thinking back to January 6th, that's a big statement, in a very deeply divided and polarized United States. 
 
But really, it was a very positive speech also not just energized but very positive. And I think this is really critical for a president who wants to bring people on board, bringing working class Americans, bringing white working-class Americans as well as a racially diverse set of Americans on board. Very difficult things to do. In the Republican Party, as we, know has been very good about trying to peel off of some of those constituencies that have been core to the Democrats in the past and aren't anymore. So, this is a president that seeking to have a broad church follow him. 
 
NOBILO: Some of the things you just mentioned, you remind us of inherent tensions and democracy. You can have a robust democracy and all be behind that in terms of every member of the political establishment. But that you'll always have this push and pull and this robust exchange with the opposition. It was almost confused at points, because Biden did list these bipartisan achievements. But then there were a couple of digs, and Kevin McCarthy behind him looked uncomfortable, at points. How do you think it's gone down, what's the response been from certain slices of the Republican Party? 
 
VINJAMURI: Yes, I think that sort of Freedom Caucus, that sort of far- right part of the Republican Party is immediately taking this State of the Union address apart. They're claiming disinformation, that, you know, our borders are not secure. That there's violence, that far more people are dying of fentanyl overdoses then the president has let on. And we will undoubtedly see the division now come out. 
 
And I think, you know, you make a very interesting point, that really in a healthy robust democracy, you need contestation, you need it to be safe to disagree. And there's a sense in the United States that we've gone past that point. And so, this is a president that's really is trying to rein it back in. One idea that stands behind this nation in setting the American nation apart from all others -- I think there's a little bit of fiction there, but a very important point, and again, designed to bring everybody together and unify them, a very high bar today. 
 
NOBILO: Thank you so much, Leslie Vinjamuri, great to have you with us. 
 
VINJAMURI: Thank you.
 
NOBILO: North Korea's leader is marking a major military anniversary, with two members of his family. Kim Jong-un's wife and daughter accompanied him during a visit to military barracks, and then to a lavish banquet. 
 <br>[04:35:00]
 
It's believed that the girls, his second child, and her appearance is raising questions about whether she's being groomed, to someday takeover. This comes as the country celebrates 75 years of the Korean Peoples Army. 
 
CNN's Paula Hancocks is covering this live from Seoul. Paula, because we get so little information from Kim Jong-un and his regime, everyone is always analyzing any aspect of these public appearances that we see for what it says about him and what it says about possible succession in dynamics. What did you make of it? 
 
PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Bianca, there's always a speculation. I mean, to be fair, North Korea hasn't even confirmed her name at this point. This is what we have assessed could be her name from what we're hearing from intelligence agencies. And even from Dennis Rodman when he went to visit Kim Jong-un in North Korea. So, that's how little we know. 
 
We assume she's about nine, ten years old. This is the fourth public appearance that we've seen her at as far as we know. And so what this is doing is obviously putting the speculation into overdrive as to whether or not this is an official coming out, an official sign that she is going to be the successor. 
 
Now, we have heard some experts say that they believe that there was a good chance the fact that at such a young age, she is being brought out into such significant events, military events. I mean, the first time she was seen back in November of last year, was for the launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile. So, it was a significant event in itself. And of course now, we are seeing the 75th anniversary of the creation, the foundation of the Korea Peoples Army, the military in North Korea. And we've seen a couple of days of events like this where the military is front and center. 
 
So, we have been visiting the military barracks, which state-run media showed pictures of today -- this Wednesday. Just a day earlier, we understand from state run media that Kim Jong-un had had a meeting aboard the leaders, of the military leaders, saying that he wanted war readiness to be improved. He wanted more military drills. And that had to be increased. And potentially, in a matter of hours, we could see a significant military parade in Pyongyang itself. Now I say potentially, because until it happens, we simply don't know for sure. 
 
NOBILO: Paula Hancocks we know that you'll be keeping your eyes peeled monitoring that for us. Paula Hancocks in Seoul. 
 
Still ahead, governments across the world mobilize aid for Turkey and Syria following the devastating earthquake. We'll have a live update on that for you next. 
 
And later, the U.S. begins inspecting the downed Chinese balloon. But the longer they, keep it the more that tensions rise with Beijing. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BECKY ANDERSON, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT: Welcome back. I'm Becky Anderson here in Gaziantep in Turkey. As the numbers sadly continue to climb, as far as the death toll is concerned, and what was this massive earthquake some 50 odd hours ago. Tens of thousands injured, many of those are, you know, children, many kids have lost their lives in this. Thousands, injured and sadly died in this, according to UNICEF. 
 
There are pockets of hope, this is one of, them this is the scene that we've been outside now for some 24 hours. There's a family that the rescue workers here have heard knocking. Now they've been in touch with them. And certainly, know that they've been alive now for some time, what, 50 odd hours. And you can only imagine the condition this gentleman his two sons are in. But there is a sense that they're very close to extracting that family from this site here in Kahramanmaras. 
 
Part of what we are seeing across this region is an in pouring of support from the international community. More than 70 countries sending support. I came in with the UAE for example. They brought in heavy lifting gear, they brought in search and rescue personnel and a field hospital, which is being established about 100 kilometers from here, very, very close to the epicenter. And what happened, and where the greatest needs are. But countries around the world really throwing their weight behind both Turkey and Syria. Let's get more on that. And Nada Bashir is in London, and she joins me with the details -- Nada. 
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER: Absolutely, Becky. That outpouring of support has been immense. And it is wide reaching. And we've seen the commitments of aid by international partners across the globe. As you laid out, they're at least 70 nations, 14 international organizations pledging support for Turkey and Syria. 
 
At the stage, the support being offered to Turkey is somewhat more robust than that being offered to Syria. And there is concern of, of course prior to Monday's earthquake, Syria, and this particular region in the northwest of the country was already in such dire need. More than 4 million people they're dependent on humanitarian assistance. So, there is a real sense of urgency there as well. Particularly, of course, with the harsh weather conditions, as your team has been experiencing a Turkey. So, there is significant concern. 
 
But as you mentioned, we're seeing search and rescue teams arriving in Turkey from across the globe to support in that rescued effort. And of course, each and every minute counts here. 
 
We are also seeing humanitarian assistance in the form of financial aid, in the form of medical support, blankets, food, arriving from across the globe. But there is that significant concern still around the situation in northwestern Syria. We've learned now from the United Nation that the actual crossing from Turkey into Syria is moving difficult to get across, because of destruction caused by the earthquakes. So, there is concerns there. but talks are ongoing to create some sort of way for that aid to get to those most in need in Syria -- Becky. 
 
ANDERSON: Yes, and it couldn't come fast enough. And in some areas, it won't be fast enough at this stage. But that is the story. And effort is at least ongoing at this point. Look, you talked, Nada, about whether conditions. And I have to say, after report for the first time in the hours that we've been here, and it's actually warming up just slightly. It's been minus six through the night here. Those are the sorts of conditions that people experienced when they ran out of their houses if they can get out at 4:15 in the morning on Monday when the first earthquake struck. 
 
Remember, viewers, there was a second earthquake of nearly the same magnitude in the afternoon on Monday, 125 aftershocks from that initial quake. It's been absolutely traumatizing for an entire population across this region. Let's find out whether there is any prospect that conditions, at least, will improve anytime soon. Britley Ritz is at the Weather Center for you -- Britley. 
 
BRITLEY RITZ, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Becky, you just mentioned the 125 aftershocks. You can see where they lineup, right there along the east and the Ionian fault. And with that some of the coldest air really setting in now, that the fronts move through, that northerly wind kicking in. Aleppo at six degrees now, the sun has come up, and we're heading into the afternoon hours. So, we're peak heating at that point in time. But as the overnight hours really set in with the clear skies, that's why it was so cool this morning, all that heat escape right up into the atmosphere. 
 <br>[04:45:03]
 
And I'm showing you satellite simply for that reason. The purples, the oranges indicating that the moisture, with the area of low pressure. But as that low moves, out the high sets in with that northerly wind, that cool dry air, it takes away that moisture. Which is why our rain chances and our snow chances are slowly come to an end as the system pushes away. With clearing skies, that cooler air really sets in again once we move through the overnight hours. 
 
And low temperatures over the next three days, look at Aleppo, still saying below zero. And that's a few degrees below where we actually should be this time of year. And then we factor in that wind, five, ten kilometers per hour. And it feels like seven below in Aleppo on Thursday morning. Thankfully, the sun comes up and we try to warm back up. We are above zero at that point. But notice temperatures really still staying right above freezing, if not a little bit above, which again, is below normal -- Becky. 
 
ANDERSON: Sorry, just moving the camera a little bit. This is a big truck behind me. This truck will be picking up a lot of the debris that has been thrown off by search and rescue teams. I'm just being moved You see what you've got to do in a situation like this. 
 
And Bianca, search and rescue ongoing here. We are hoping for a good news story out of this. Heaven knows we need one, both across this part of Turkey and into northwest Syria. There are pockets of good news. But really, the overarching story, we're afraid to report, is really such a devastating, heartbreaking story -- Bianca. 
 
NOBILO: Becky Anderson, thank you so much.. We'll be checking in with you and hearing from you and your team throughout the day. 
 
Still to come, the case of the suspected spy balloon continues while the U.S. officials say the Chinese vessel is part of a bigger spy fleet. Beijing pushes back. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
NOBILO: U.S. intelligence officials say the suspected Chinese spy balloon shot down over the weekend is actually part of a much larger surveillance program run by China's military. Officials say that the balloon is part of a fleet that has carried out dozens of missions all around the world. Now that the U.S. has their hands on it, they plan to find out what it can do. CNN's Oren Liebermann has more from the Pentagon.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
 
OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Bit by tattered, bit salvage teams have pulled the remnants of the Chinese altitude balloon out of the Atlantic Ocean, learning its secrets now just a matter of time. The first covered parts already at Quantico for FBI analysis. 
 
CNN has reviewed parts of an Air Force report from last April that show the trajectory of one high altitude balloon that flew around the world in 2019 during the Trump administration. According to the report called People's Republic of China high altitude balloons, the balloon was launched and controlled by China as it drifted near Hawaii, and over southern Florida at 65,000 feet. 
 <br>[04:50:04]
 
But it's unclear when the U.S. first became aware of the 2019 balloon or its intent. The House Armed Services Committee hearing on the threat China poses to national security focused on this balloon.
 
REP. MIKE ROGERS (R-AL):  Make no mistake, that balloon was intentionally launches a calculated show of force. We have to stop being naive about the threat we face from China. 
 
LIEBERMANN (voice-over): The commander of northern command and NORAD Gen. Glenn VanHerck, acknowledged there was an awareness gap that allowed three balloons to overfly parts of the United States during the Trump administration. China's initial apology for this latest incident they claim was a weather balloon, has turned into indignation. China says the balloon doesn't belong to the U.S. and they want it back. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator)What I can say is this airship belongs to China, and not the United States. 
 
LIEBERMANN: Shortly after the U.S. down the Chinese balloon on Saturday afternoon, the Defense Department reach out to China to see if it was possible to set up a call between Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and his Chinese counterpart, minister of national security, Wei Fenghe. 
 
The Pentagon said on Tuesday that was rebuffed. China rejected an opportunity to have a call, a very high-level call between Austin and his counterpart. This is important for a number of regions. First, Austin, as well President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Anthony Blinken have called on the importance of diplomacy and communication, especially during a time of heightened tension with the competition between the U.S. and China. 
 
But it's also noteworthy because in China's first statement at the acknowledge responsibility for the balloon, they also called for diplomacy to handle the heightened tensions. Instead, now as this has evolved, China rejecting the opportunity of diplomacy, perhaps a-for- tat, since Blinken canceled his visit to Beijing. 
 
Oren Liebermann, CNN, in the Pentagon.

NOBILO: CNN's Kristie Lu Stout joins me from Hong Kong with more. Kristie, the real politic of this situation dictates it will be very difficult for China to say anything else about this balloon other than denying it was used for espionage purposes. But what can we learn about their reaction? 
 
KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well right now, we just got fresh reaction from the ministry of foreign affairs. Who said that China will not shy away from competition with the United States. This on, the back of U.S. President Joe Biden's State of the Union address. In that address, the U.S. president addressed China, saying the United States is seeking competition not conflict with China. He did not directly mention the balloon, but he did imply and mention the balloon in the following He said, quote, if China threatens our sovereignty we'd like to protect our country, and we did. 
 
Of, course the Chinese balloon prompted a political uproar in the United States and also China and the United States. It prompted America's chief diplomat to cancel his planned February visit to Beijing. And today, we heard from the ministry of foreign affairs a direct response to Mr. Biden speech. 
 
Let's bring it up for you from the ministry of foreign affairs spokeswoman, Mao Ning, who said, quote: We oppose the U.S. smearing China under the banner of competition and restricting China's legitimate rights to develop in so far to exacerbate the global supply chain. She goes on to say: China will handle Sino U.S. relations based on the principles of mutual respect, peaceful cooperation, and win-win cooperation, while resolutely defend our sovereignty, security, and development interests, unquote. 
 
Since the U.S. military shot down the Chinese balloon, we know that the rhetoric that we've heard from China has parted increasingly and China right here are holding the line that it was serving its own sovereignty. Back to you.
 
NOBILO: Kristie Lu Stout in Hong Kong, thank you. Now after 20 seasons and more than 1400 games, LeBron James has
 
 achieved basketball immortality by breaking a record many thought was unbreakable. Details ahead.
 <br>[04:55:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
NOBILO: LeBron James is now the NBA's all-time leading scorer. It took James 20 seasons and just more than 1400 games to pass the former record holder Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who scored 38,087 points in his career. The record-breaking basket happen during the third quarter of Tuesday's game against the Oklahoma City Thunder. King James spoke about getting emotional during that moment. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LEBRON JAMES, LOS ANGELES LAKERS FORWARD: If I can count on my hands how many times have cried in 20 years, neither in happiness nor defeat, you know, so that moment was a moment where I kind of teared up a bit. It wasn't I can't believe what is going on. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NOBILO: Omar Jimenez has more on that moment that James is talking about. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: People came to see history, and they witnessed it. LeBron James, now the all-time leading scorer in NBA history. And he would be the first to admit that he didn't think he would be the one to break what some thought was a previously unbreakable record. 
 
But when you look at everything LeBron has done over the course of his career, who else would it have been. And the moment came on a Tuesday night, and when that happened, when he hit a fadeaway off the left elbow almost nothing but net, he ran to center court, raised his arms, and triumph as an entire arena cheered him on likely many more watching from home. He came to the center court and was greeted by his family as a crowd chanted MVP. He was emotional, as Kareem Abdul- Jabbar the person whose record he now eclipsed, embraced him and greeted him along with the NBA commissioner. 
 
And when you look at LeBron James's legacy, the on the court of course will be respected and always remembered. But the reaction and the embraces he had, once he crossed that milestone are emblematic of who he is off the court. And for many, all of those come together in the legacy that is LeBron James. And when you talk about the historic milestone that was crossed tonight, it wasn't just a moment in NBA history, for those watching, and that have follow him all around the world, this was a moment in history.
