ROSA FLORES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  I want to take you to Lukeville, Arizona, because that area is a second epicenter also seeing more then 2,000 migrant apprehensions every single day. And the challenge there for Customs and Border Protection is that the cartels, the smugglers are dropping off migrants, Poppy, in very desolate, rugged areas which is creating a nightmare for transportation because then those migrants have to be transported to processing facilities. CBP having to use ATVs to transport some of those migrants. Poppy?
 
POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR:  Rosa, thank you very much for your reporting there at Eagle Pass, Texas. 
 
And in moments we will be joined by the Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to talk about the latest spike and migrant encounters and much more. 
 
PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN ANCHOR:  And CNN THIS MORNING continues right now. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST:  Under no circumstances you are promising America tonight, you would never abuse power as retribution against anybody? 
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  Except for day one. 
 
HANNITY:  Except for? 
 
TRUMP:  He's going crazy. Except for day one. 
 
HANNITY:  Meaning? 
 
TRUMP:  I want to close the border, and I want to drill, drill, drill. 
 
HANNITY:  That's -- 
 
TRUMP:  He says, you are not going to be a dictator, are you? I said no, no, no, other than day one. We are closing the border and we're drilling, drilling, drilling. After that, I am not a dictator, OK? 
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARLOW:  Good morning, everyone. I'm Poppy Harlow with Phil Mattingly in New York. And that was Donald Trump last night saying the quiet part out loud when he was put on the spot. 
 
MATTINGLY:  For Trump, increasingly violence and authoritarian rhetoric on the campaign trail has sparked a frenzy of headlines this week about what he might do if he becomes president again. While he danced around the question about abusing power, his ally Kash Patel is openly talking about punishing perceived enemies, including reporters, if there is a new Trump term. Keep in mind, this is a man who will almost certainly hold a senior role in Trump's administration if Trump wins. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KASH PATEL, FORMER TRUMP ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We will go out and find the conspirators not just in government but in the media, yes. We are going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens, who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections, we are going to come after you. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARLOW:  Meantime, President Biden has been sounding the alarm and says Trump is determined to destroy American democracy. He apparently, though, really surprised donors and some of his own campaign team at a fundraiser yesterday when he made this candid comment. Let me read you the quote in full. "Folks, this is a big deal. This election, we have got to get it done, not because of me, and I mean that. If Trump wasn't running, I am not sure I'd be running." It's that part. He went on to say, "But we cannot let him win for the sake of the country." 
 
MATTINGLY:  A candid assessment, one underscoring his view of the stakes. Reporters asked President Biden to contextualize that comment when he returned to the White House. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Would you be running for president if Trump wasn't running? 
 
JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I expect so. But look, he is running, and I have to run. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Would you drop out if Trump drops out?
 
BIDEN:  No, not now. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MATTINGLY:  So how will Trump's GOP rivals respond on the debate stage tonight to his dictator for one day? Talk to the frontrunner, well, he is skipping again. And the reality is none of them are remotely close in the polls. Right now, America is looking increasingly at a Trump- Biden rematch. Could be, of course, some major turn of events, we'll have to see. But that's where it stands in the polling. 
 
Jeff Zeleny is live for us in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, for tonight's final Republican presidential debate before those Iowa caucuses. Jeff, the biggest question of the four on stage is can Nikki Haley continue her momentum? 
 
JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Phil. That is a central question. Really, these debates have been a springboard for Nikki Haley. We have seen one debate after another, she has continued to rise in the polls and certainly has drawn more interest from voters in those early voting states, Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina. She has got be donors really paying attention to her and believing in her candidacy. 
 
Of course, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is also front and center, center stage. He has receded a bit from debate to debate to debate. But now is the moment for choosing. So this certainly is one of the big dynamics we are watching for tonight between Nikki Haley and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. 
 
But do not forget New Hampshire -- or former New Jersey governor Chris Christie, excuse me. He is also campaigning aggressively in New Hampshire. So is he a bit of a roadblock for Nikki Haley? What is their dynamic tonight? 
 
And of course, Vivek Ramaswamy, the entrepreneur from Ohio, has been a thorn in the side of Nikki Haley. He has been known to dust it up and really get in the middle of this. So look for these four to perhaps have one of their most contentious debates yet. 
 
But there is no doubt that Nikki Haley is going to try and use this moment to really make the case for her generational change argument she has been making. But the Florida governor also has everything on the line tonight. So that, of course, will be the biggest dynamic we are watching. 
 
But Phil, as you said, the biggest candidate, the one driving this race, Donald Trump, he is not here, but you know he'll still be front and center in the conversation. 
 <br>[08:05:04]
 
HARLOW:  You spoke with voters in Iowa. Again, last debate before the Iowa caucuses. I wonder what they told you. 
 
ZELENY:  Poppy, it's really interesting. Just 40 days from now the Iowa caucuses open the Republican voting. And December is often the month when undecided voters begin picking a side before the holidays. And that's what we found in our conversations. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ZELENY:  Sally Hofmann has been thinking and praying about the Republican presidential race. 
 
SALLY HOFMANN, IOWA VOTER:  I pray for the direction this country is going and I pray for the candidates. 
 
ZELENY:  As candidates have descended on Iowa, Hofmann has watched with an open mind. When we first met earlier this year, she had high praise for Donald Trump and curiosity for two of his rivals. 
 
HOFMANN:  I like what Trump has done. To me it's huge to have three U.S. Supreme Court justices during his term. And that -- I am a big pro-life proponent. 
 
I like what Nikki Haley is doing. I like DeSantis, too. So kind of in that range. 
 
ZELENY:  Now as Republican hopefuls scramble for support six weeks before the Iowa caucuses open the 2024 campaign, Hofmann is among those looking for a fresh start. 
 
HOFMANN:  I am thankful for what Trump did when he was in office, but I have been a little bit disappointed in Trump lately. I am just veering away from him and leaning towards DeSantis. He seems like a man who when he believes something he'll stand by it. And that's what I appreciate about him.
 
ZELENY:  As fall turns to winter in Iowa, its a season of choosing. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Are you guys Iowa or Illinois residents? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Iowa. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Perfect. Have you already filled out one of a commit to caucus cards? 
 
ZELENY:  And a critical moment for Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley to show that the Republican primary is still a contest, not a coronation. 
 
ROGER DVORAK, IOWA VOTER:  I am very impressed with Nikki Haley. And I just hope she gets the nomination. 
 
ZELENY:  Roger Dvorak voted for Trump but believes his criminal cases are a distraction. 
 
DVORAK:  Whether he is guilty or not, I don't know. We will have to wait and see. But I just don't think he can be effective as leader of the country. 
 
ZELENY:  There's little doubt Trump remains a driving force in the campaign. 
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  We are going to win the Iowa caucuses. 
 
ZELENY:  He is in Iowa again tonight, the second time in four days, to try to maintain his dominance. Yet exhaustion with the former president, once whispered, easily comes alive in conversations with Republicans like Karen Hanna, who also voted for Trump, but is now weighing an alternative. 
 
What is it that gives you pause about President Trump? 
 
KAREN HANNA, IOWA VOTER:  I think all this going on and I think Ron DeSantis is a little bit more solid and less drama, you know, just all the things that Trump's going through the courts. So unsure about that. But I like Ron DeSantis, what he stands for. 
 
ZELENY:  The question is how many Iowans are inclined to go against the grain of the Trump controlled GOP as they make their final decisions. 
 
ANNE WALFORD, IOWA VOTER:  I am looking to Nikki Haley and, of course, DeSantis, and Vivek, and Trump if -- 
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
ZELENY:  Anne Walford's laughter underscores the expressions of many Republicans, a reluctance to be with Trump now, but a pledge to be with him in the end. 
 
WALFORD:  If he is the nominee, I will vote for him. 
 
ZELENY:  That sentiment resonates on the Hofmann farm outside Cedar Rapids where Sally said she, too, will support Trump if he is the party's choice. But for now, he is not her choice, and she hopes Iowa can spark a new direction for the country. 
 
HOFMANN:  I think it's more of a wide open race. 
 
ZELENY:  More of a wide open race? 
 
HOFMANN:  Right. I think it won't surprise me if Trump gets in. It won't surprise me if he isn't the nominee. And I am just hoping that DeSantis might be the one. But I think it's more wide open. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ZELENY (on camera):  And these conversations are with people who voted for Trump in most cases twice before. But they are looking for an alternative. So there is no doubt that the former president is still front and center and driving these conversations. And he's also focusing a lot on Iowa. He was there again last night. That's where he made those dictator comments. 
 
And Iowa voters are paying attention to everything he is saying. So is that going to have an impact on the race? We shall see. So he is stealing the show in some respect, but he certainly has not cleared the field. A reminder that some voters are just tuning in. That's why he is there a lot, and those open minds certainly are something to keep an eye on. Poppy and Phil?
 
MATTINGLY:  Jeff Zeleny, notable alum of "The Des Moines Register," thanks, buddy. Appreciate it. 
 
HARLOW:  Great paper. Joining us now, former Democratic congressional candidate in New York Liz Whitmer Gereghty, CNN political commentator and former Trump campaign advisor David Urban, and back at the table, our chief national correspondent John King. 
 
Could we start there with what did -- he said it so well. Jeff Zeleny always says it better than I can. He is leading but the field is still open. I botched it. 
 <br>[08:10:06]
 
JOHN KING, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, one of the voters saying it's a wide-open race. I don't know that it's a wide-open race, but I do think it is an open race. Trump is around 42, 43 percent in Iowa. Trump is around 40 percent in New Hampshire. That means he can be beat. That means somewhere in the vicinity of six to ten percent of Republicans are looking around. And in my travels, and Jeff backs this up with his voters, there are a lot of Trump voters who here say I can for Trump. 
 
But back here, if he is shown to be vulnerable, the challenge is can somebody show him to be weak in Iowa, like Barack Obama did to Hillary Clinton? Then I think the doors open a little bit. Then there is a possibility. And New Hampshire loves being contrarian to Iowa. Then if it's Nikki Haley, she would go home to South Carolina. The basic dynamic of the race has yet to change, though. If you add up the Haley vote, the DeSantis vote, and the Ramaswamy vote, then you have a challenge to Trump. Throw in the Christie vote, then you can beat Trump. The question is, does it consolidate? Not yet, but there is an opening there. 
 
MATTINGLY:  To that point, this has always been the case. I think this the Nikki Haley kind of theory of the case, right. Something happens in New Hampshire, and you change the trajectory and all of a sudden people flood in who had been waiting for a permission structure to some degree. How likely do you think that is?
 
DAVID URBAN, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  I think the old adage, how you run the race, unopposed or scared, right. And you run scared, you've got to run scared. The Trump campaign is headed and run by people who are very serious and know this game. Susie Wiles, Kosas (ph) Feeda (ph), Jason Miller -- these are all veterans. They have done this before. They are going to spend a ton of time between now and January 15th in Iowa. They're going to pound their message. They're going to allow -- they're going to try to take the variables out so they can make it as firm as possible there. 
 
And then look, as John said, there is an opening. New Hampshire you have independents can vote, Democrats can vote. But then interestingly, we'll see, going to South Carolina, I think Trump beats Haley in South Carolina even if she has a nice showing in New Hampshire. But it could be, you know, you could come out of Iowa, New Hampshire, going to South Carolina with much more of a two-horse race than a six or seven-horse race right at that point. 
 
HARLOW:  Liz, how are you watching this as a democrat? Because we have seen some head-to-head hypothetical matchups where Nikki Haley is a bigger problem for President Biden than former President Trump is. 
 
LIZ WHITMER GEREGHTY, (D) FORMER NEW YORK CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE: Sure. But I think just as a voter and as an American, I think it would be great if we could wake up the day after an election without existential fear. It would be fantastic if we could have two candidates that people could feel good about. But thinking about the debate tonight, the four people on the stage, they all raised their hand when asked if they would support an eventual Trump nomination, with the exception of Chris Christie. 
 
HARLOW:  I don't think Christie did. 
 
GEREGHTY:  No, he didn't. And you saw DeSantis kind of look around and see what other people were doing before he raised his hand. The thing that really strikes me is that you have candidates who want to be the leader of the free world but they won't even take on the frontrunner in their current primary, and I think that's really concerning. 
 
It's also interesting, John, the contrast between that and the current president who views the stakes as enormous, the down sides of a Trump victory as catastrophic. I think he acknowledged what has been a through line of his entire last five or six years last night in a fundraiser, as he always does, speaking candidly behind closed doors, which drives me nuts. But in saying that he may not have run were it not for Trump. But Trump was there. And Trump was the reason he got in in 2019 and it's the reason he has done everything he's done in the last two-and-a-half years. 
 
KING:  So he said the quiet part out loud. Remember, he said he would be a transitional figure, a lot of people took that has he would serve one term. And then he decided -- but he views as Trump -- but when he came back to the White House he was asked -- because it was at a fundraiser, as you said. That annoys reporters. They want it on camera. He was asked -- they said would you get out? He said not now. Not now, that is the key part of that, not now, because the Democratic calendar is a little bit different. But 40 days to Iowa, then New Hampshire, then South Carolina. If Joe Biden were to step aside now, he thinks the chaos would be too much in the Democratic Party. 
 
But there are a lot of conversations when you travel with voters saying should Joe Biden be running? Should Donald Trump be running? Are they both too old, or are they both time for a change? Joe Biden should not be starting another one of those conversations. It's not helpful to him.
 
HARLOW:  How did you read the "not now"? Not now as in maybe later, or not now as in it's too late? 
 
KING:  Too late. 
 
HARLOW:  David, the dictator comments? 
 
URBAN:  Look, I mean -- 
 
HARLOW:  By Trump? URBAN:  Look, obviously, regrettable. If I had the president here, I
 
 would shake him and say what the hell are you doing. A little bit of this --
 
MATTINGLY:  And Sean Hannity actually almost did that on stage. 
 
URBAN:  He did that. And so I told John this kind off stage. Nothing Donald Trump hates more is to have his arm twisted, right, by Sean Hannity to say something to make -- so Sean Hannity is going to make Donald Trump say I made a mistake, right. He's not going to admit that, right. Donald Trump's not going to do that. It's not who he is. It's not in his DNA. 
 
MATTINGLY:  If he thinks he made a mistake. 
 
URBAN:  He did make a mistake. And I think, look, 2016, Salena Zito, my friend, had this -- she coined this phrase which was widely reported use throughout the Trump campaign.
 <br>[08:15:00]
 
Then Trump supporters take him seriously but not literally, right? And then his detractors take him literally, but not seriously. 
 
And I think what we're seeing here in this case is a little bit more of the same, but it's not helped by folks like Kash Patel and Steve Bannon who go out and who are far worse, right, and say things that are far --
 
HARLOW: Can you please talk about what Kash Patel said, I don't think it's getting enough attention, right? He had a big role. Former Counterterrorism Advisor on the National Security Council would likely have, don't you think, another in the Trump administration. 
 
If he wins, he says, "We will go out and find the conspirators not just in government, but in the media. We are going to come after the people in the media who lied about the American citizen." 
 
URBAN: And look, it's outrageous. It's outrageous to say those kinds of things, right? It's not helpful. It's outrageous. The only person that could beat Donald Trump in this race, is Donald Trump. And by saying those kinds of things, right? That may appeal to a certain segment of the primary electorate, but it's sure not going to help you win voters in Macomb County, Bucks County, or Montgomery. 
 
KING: It would take one sentence on Truth Social to quiet this, he does not speak for me, he does not speak for me. Have you seen that? 
 
LIZ WHITMER GEREGHTY, (D) FORMER NY CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE: Donald Trump saying to Sean Hannity last night saying that, "Yeah, on day one, I will be a dictator." And I think that you're right to be concerned about this. It's a very scary time, I really, genuinely worry that if people go to the voting booth in November, they cast their vote for Trump, that might be the last vote they cast. 
 
And attacks on the media, attacks on people who disagreed, and I think that we are in great danger. I am worried not only for this country because I think it was actually, I'm going to quote Ronald Reagan, but freedom is one generation away from extinction, and that is genuinely true. 
 
And when you think about attacks on the media and going after your enemies and trying to jail people who disagree with you, we could be in a very dark place. 
 
HARLOW: Sounds a lot like what Liz Cheney is saying coming from a Democrat. 
 
GEREGHTY: Another Liz. 
 
HARLOW: Yeah, there you go another Liz. Thank you all, we appreciate it. David, John, and Liz. 
 
MATTINGLY: Okay, President Biden sitting down with our own Anderson Cooper for a one-of-a-kind conversation on grief. Anderson's going to join us next with the latest episode of his "All There Is" podcast. 
 
HARLOW: Also, the FBI director with a stark warning about growing terror threats in the United States says he sees blinking red lights everywhere. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas joins us exclusively for an interview about what is done to keep Americans safe.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[08:20:00]
 
HARLOW: Welcome back, this morning, Arizona and Texas are seeing a spike in border crossings as the country faces a continuing and growing migrant surge. And the US Border Patrol releasing body camera video of a dramatic rescue of a migrant who was drowning in Texas. 
 
Agents observed a Guatemalan man, quote, "Struggling to stay afloat," in the Rio Grande River, an agent jumped in, pulled the man out. The agency says they tended to him, he did not need additional medical care, and he is okay. Thank goodness. 
 
But this comes as border security and immigration reform are at the center of a fight in Congress over funding wars overseas. Today, the Senate is set to hold a critical test, a test vote on President Biden's $100 billion  supplemental national security package, and that includes additional funds for both Israel and Ukraine. 
 
The White House warning that Ukraine funding is almost gone and that delaying it could hand a victory to Putin. Republican senators vowing to vote against it unless it includes big border policy changes, they say the aid package is an opportunity to force the Biden administration to deal with the border crisis. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEN. JOHN CORNYN (R-TX) This has been a point of contention for many years, but the Biden administration has been unwilling to do anything about it, and I think we now have an opportunity to hold their feet to the fire. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARLOW: Joining us now is Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Mr. Secretary, I'm so glad you're with us this morning. And let's begin with what John Cornyn just said there, why is this not the moment to deal with the crisis at the border? 
 
ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS, SECRETARY, U.S. HOMELAND SECURITY: Poppy, thanks so much for having me. Let me make this perfectly clear. The immigration system has been broken for decades, and our Department of Homeland Security has been underfunded for years and years. 
 
And President Biden has addressed both issues with strength from day one. On the first day of his administration, he presented Congress with legislation to fix our immigration system, and we have submitted to Congress a Supplemental Funding Bill that will resource our department, the heroic Border Patrol agents that you displayed just a few minutes ago to fund them as they need to address what is an unprecedented level of migration not only at our southern border, not only in the Western Hemisphere, but throughout the world. 
 
HARLOW: Secretary Mayorkas, address with strength is what you say the President and this administration are doing. But even his surrogate, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, does not feel that in Illinois listen to this from October. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOV. JB PRITZKER (D-IL): we were very clear in our communication with the White House that what we need is logistical support, that is, help deciding where these folks ought to go because they can't all go to Chicago. It seems like now is the moment to talk about Border Security and Immigration reform. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARLOW: And then he wrote this the federal government must stop abdicating responsibility once CBP releases migrants to the interior of the country. It sounds like even the president's, one of his biggest supporters, says we need help now from the Biden administration. 
 
MAYORKAS: Well, with respect to Governor Pritzker, with whom I communicate on a regular basis, we have provided him with tremendous assistance, not just financially through our Shelter and Services program, funding that the President achieved, but also in providing technical advice. 
 
But let's get to the root of what Governor Pritzker's challenge is, is that we have another governor in another state that is not cooperating and coordinating with either federal or other local authorities and is unilaterally sending migrants to cities in what I think is an abdication of governance responsibility. 
 
HARLOW: You're talking about Greg Abbott. MAYORKAS: I am indeed. 
 <br>[08:25:00]
 
HARLOW: This also, though, from Katie Hobbs, the Governor of Arizona, just this week, listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOV. KATIE HOBBS (D-AZ): We need the federal government to act and provide more resources. And we've been very clear about that consistently. This is a bad decision that impacts our border security. It hurts our economy because it's putting a damper on trade and tourism. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARLOW: She's a Democrat. Also, a letter to the White House from five Democratic Mayors of Denver, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston saying they need resources far beyond the 14 billion that the President, proposed in the supplemental. 
 
Will the President be going back to the border, the southern border, to see more of the crisis with his own eyes? 
 
MAYORKAS: Poppy, what these governors are speaking of is precisely what the President has sought to address and why we need Congress to act. We do indeed need additional resources, the Department of Homeland Security needs additional resources, the Department of Justice for additional Immigration Judges, the State Department for appropriate funding of our refugee programs and the efforts that we have in the international arena. 
 
So, we need Congress to act, we have sought additional funding, not just for the Federal Government, but for these cities to be able to deal with what is in an unprecedented situation, not just domestically, but internationally. 
 
HARLOW: And, Mr. Secretary, to the point of needing Congress to act, what Senate Republicans are pushing for, really right now is very similar to H.R.2, which passed the House to Secure the Border Act. 
 
And just to name a couple of things in it, restart construction on the border wall, increase the number of Border Patrol agents, limit asylum, narrow the President's parole powers. Why is that unpalatable to the administration? 
 
MAYORKAS: I would say two things. One, we've presented proposals that address the situation, that provide real, practical solutions, and also do not do violence to our fundamental values. We are a country of refuge, we do have asylum laws, we do have refugee laws. 
 
We abide by our international obligations that are long standing, and so that is my response to that. Some of the proposals are reasonable and worthy of discussion, others are frankly, not. HARLOW: Let's turn to this stark warning from FBI Director Christopher
 
 Wray yesterday. He warned that the Israel-Hamas War has raised the threat of a terror attack on the United States, to quote, "A whole other level," here's more of what he said to lawmakers. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHRISTOPHER WRAY, FBI DIRECTOR: I've never seen a time where all the threats or so many of the threats are all elevated, all at exactly the same time. That's what makes this environment that we're in now so fraught. 
 
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): Would you say that there's multiple blinking red lights out there? 
 
WRAY: I see blinking lights everywhere I turn. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARLOW: That's very scary, especially when you think back to 911. Is this threat level unprecedented Mr. Secretary? 
 
MAYORKAS: Poppy, we are in a heightened threat environment. We work very closely, hand in glove with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, with our federal partners throughout the administration, including the intelligence community, and very critically with state local law enforcement as well. 
 
We are definitely in a heightened threat environment, and we are proceeding with vigilance. 
 
HARLOW: Are you seeing blinking red lights everywhere you turn? Because to hear that from the FBI director is a big deal. 
 
MAYOKRAS: I am, and we have seen episodes of violence in this country that speak tragically to that reality. We are also doing something about it, we are sharing information with the private sector, with the general public. 
 
Just today, we are publishing guidelines for faith-based institutions and communities across this country that really describe practical steps that they can take to be alert to the threat environment and to respond with accessible protective measures. 
 
HARLOW: And Secretary Mayorkas, to that point, if you could speak more in detail about that, because we heard Director Wray talk about the troubling trend, his words of the increased anti-Semitic threats and attacks. Specifically, what will this initiative and this document that you're giving to churches, synagogues, mosques, other houses of worship, what is it telling them to do to help protect them? 
 
MAYORKAS: It's very, very practical, accessible advice. Develop security plan, put an individual or a committee in charge of security, understand one's surroundings.
