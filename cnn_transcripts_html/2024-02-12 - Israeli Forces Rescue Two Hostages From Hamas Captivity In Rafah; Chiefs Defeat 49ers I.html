ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN ANCHOR: Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us here in the United States, Canada and across the globe. I'm Rosemary Church. Just ahead. Israel's military rescues two Israeli hostages during a special operation in Gaza, 128 days after they're captured. 
 
Israel's Prime Minister and the U.S. president don't see eye to eye on plans to target Rafah, what the two leaders discussed in their latest phone call. 
 
Plus, the Kansas City Chiefs when again. We will take a look at the biggest moments of the Super Bowl thriller.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Live from Atlanta. This is CNN Newsroom with Rosemary Church.
 
CHURCH: Good to have you with us. And we begin with new developments out of Gaza where the Israel Defense Forces as two hostages have been rescued from the southern city of Rafah during a special operation overnight, but now at a medical facility in Israel where they are said to be in good condition. 
 
The IDF also says they conducted a series of strikes in one district in Rafah. The Palestine Red Crescent Society says there's more than 60 people have been killed in those strikes. This video obtained by CNN shows some of the aftermath. The Rafah municipality says at least one mosque was among the targets. 
 
And CNN's Nic Robertson joins us now from Tel Aviv with the very latest. So Nic, what are you learning about this special Israeli military operation that rescue two hostages in Rafah? NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Well, it is of course, huge news here in Israel. It's what everyone in Israel has been waiting for, for the release of more hostages. It's only the second time that the IDF has been able to go in in a military operation and free hostages. It was the end of October for the last one. 
 
This was a lightning covert operation, which had the special forces going in into the center of Rafah covertly at 1:49 in the morning, getting onto the second floor of the building, having a big firefight with Hamas there.
 
The two people, the two hostages, they were going into recover and extract were on the second floor. Within a minute of arriving there, the Air Force was conducting those supporting strikes that we now understand resulted in the death of or certainly appeared to have resulted in the death of 60 Palestinians according to the Palestinian Red Crescent.
 
The local hospital where many of the injured and victims were taken, say that they were over whelmed with that. 
 
But this operation, the special forces on the ground at 1:50 they got the call from the Air Force saying you need to get out of that building now. And they extracted. They took out the two hostages. Fernando Marman and Louis Har out of the building and led them away under fire to a safe place.
 
And front there, they were taken by helicopter to hospital on the outskirts of Tel Aviv. They're given a quick medical check in the battlefield. But this was a very, very fast military operation, with the special forces going into the building getting involved in that firefight, protecting the two hostages, freeing them and then extracting them out as the Air Force and other forces conducted what a military term should call suppressing fire on what the IDF said were Hamas elements in that area who would have been attacking them. 
 
Their family members have now met with them in the hospital. But the timeline there just gives you some sense of the speed this that whole operation the military part of the operation, apparently over in less than 15 minutes.
 
CHURCH: All right, our thanks to Nic Robertson joining us from Tel Aviv with all the latest details on that rescue operation. Well, it's really Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that he is committed to getting the hostages out and thinks enough are alive to warrant the efforts underway to secure their release.
 <br>[01:05:03]

BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER: I think enough to warrant the kind of efforts that we're doing, and we're going to try to do our best to get all those who are alive back and, frankly also the bodies of the dead. (END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: Those comments come after Netanyahu said the Israeli military would soon launch an operation into Rafah which he called the last bastion of Hamas. And Egypt is warning of dire consequences if Israel goes through with a ground offensive in Rafah joining a growing calls of international criticism. 
 
Egypt's foreign ministry called Rafah the last bastion of safety in Gaza and said targeting the southern city would contribute to the displacement and oppression of Palestinians. The United Nations, other aid organizations as well as several countries have spoken out against Israel's plan. Hamas has reportedly said that a ground offensive in Rafah would end any hostage negotiations.
 
Well, U.S. President Joe Biden voiced concern over a potential Israeli offensive in Rafah during a phone call with Prime Minister Netanyahu. They also discussed ongoing efforts to free the remaining hostages in Gaza. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez has details from Washington.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: President Biden in Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke over the phone on Sunday and what a senior administration official described as a call focused on the release of hostages who have been held in Gaza. 
 
Now this call came amid tensions between the two leaders and at a critical juncture for hostage negotiations. Now, according to the senior Administration official, this call lasts about 45 minutes, two- thirds of it focused specifically on the release of hostages. 
 
Now, U.S. officials have been working around the clock to hammer out a framework that would include the freeing of those hostages, as well as a humanitarian pause. Now there are significant gaps that remain, but it's unclear exactly what they are and what progress can be made in the days and weeks to come. 
 
The President Biden, according to the White House, read out emphasize the need to capitalize on the progress so far. This of course, following pushback from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who call Hama's recent proposals, quote, delusional. 
 
Now another important element of this phone call was about the military operation that Israel has suggested would happen in Rafah that is a city that has more than a million Palestinians, many of whom have been displaced and have nowhere else to go. 
 
Now, a senior administration official said that the U.S. has taken issue with this noting that under the current conditions that U.S. cannot see how this would happen. The U.S. being quite forceful on this point, as Israel says that they would help with the evacuation of these Palestinians. But what remains clear after the phone call on Sunday is that both President Biden and the Israel Prime Minister will remain in close contact. Priscilla Alvarez, CNN, the White House.

CHURCH: Let's bring in Malcolm Davis, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. Appreciate you joining us.
 
MALCOLM DAVIS, SENIOR ANALYST, AUSTRALIAN STRATEGIC POLICY INSTITUTE: Thanks, Rosemary.
 
CHURCH: So Israel's military says it rescue these two Israeli hostages during a special operation in Rafah, 128 days after their capture. How were they able to pull this off and what dangers would have been involved in doing this?
 
DAVIS: Look, I think this probably was in preparation for some time. This certainly wasn't something that was pulled off at the last moment. They would have had probably extensive intelligence, surveillance reconnaissance support from drones or even satellites. At the same time as they probably would have had special forces units moving forward undercover to identify not only the location of the hostages, but also the location of hostile forces Hamas forces. 
 
So this would have been a well-planned carefully executed operation. Everything that I've read about it suggests that that is the case rather than being some sort of opportunistic move to grab hostages off Hamas. And so, it's not necessarily certain that they can do this in the in the future. 
 
CHURCH: And this hostage rescue, of course offers relief for the two families involved, but more than 100 hostages still remain in captivity, and their families worried that the imminent ground offensive planned by Israel in refer could put their loved ones at risk. 
 
Could this special operation that release two hostages result in more rescues? Or could it put the remaining hostages in greater danger?
 
DAVIS: I think Hamas will be on their guard now, particularly with that IDF operation against them in Rafah. If Hamas still controlled as hostages if they haven't transferred them to other groups around the Middle East region, then they're likely to be in that southern area of Gaza around Rafah.
 <br>[01:10:04]
 
So the question for the Israelis is, how do they identify the location of these hostages and extract them, as opposed to Hamas moving them again, or even worse, basically executing them. 
 
I think that obviously the Israelis are going to go ahead with this big military operation against Rafah. I think that the Israelis are determined to defeat Hamas. But as they move forward, the risks are growing that ultimately the Hamas group could do harm to those hostages.
 
CHURCH: And before this planned Israeli military ground offensive can take place in Rafah, more than 1 million Palestinians currently sheltering in that city need to be evacuated. How can that be achieved? And how dangerous is an evacuation on that scale given Israeli nowhere to go and more than 60 Palestinians were just killed in Israeli strikes on Rafah while those hostage rescues were taking place.
 
DAVIS: I think you nailed it there. There is nowhere for them to go. That is the problem is you've got a large number of Palestinians in harm's way, with nowhere for them to be extracted from that danger. The Egyptians don't want them on their side of the border. The same with the Jordanians. The Israeli, the suggestion of moving them into Israel doesn't seem practical. There's been some talk of moving them into northern Gaza. But the Israeli Defense Force is still undertaking military operations, they are against Hamas units.
 
So there really is nowhere for these people to go. And they are very much in harm's way, either as a result of Hamas deliberately putting them in harm's way as human shields, which we all need to accept does happen. Or because the Israelis are undertaking military operations in densely urbanized built up areas, which is packed with civilians.
 
I think what the Israelis will may need to do is not repeat what they did today with that large scale airstrikes. They need to actually end those airstrikes and artillery strikes and simply going on the ground at greater risk to their forces, but it will also reduce the risk to Palestinian civilians.
 
CHURCH: So Malcolm, what will likely happen to those Palestinians unable to get out of Rafah, and of course, to the remaining hostages, if this is really ground offensive goes ahead, in the next few days, perhaps hours?
 
DAVIS: I think they shelter in place. They find somewhere to avoid being exposed as a target, if possible. They shelter in locations where there is some degree of humanitarian assistance, some degree of international oversight through groups like the United Nations, but it really is difficult to see how they can avoid risk at all. 
 
I think that as the Israeli Defense Force moves south, there is a greater risk that more civilians will be harmed. There is a greater risk, obviously for the hostages, that there'll be harmed. And at the same time, the Hamas group will try to exploit every single civilian that is harmed for their benefit. 
 
So this is a really difficult situation. I do think that it's time for the Israeli Defense Force to stop with these air attacks and these artillery attacks and start going on the ground with precision and with recognition that they have to follow the laws of armed conflict, which express proportionality discrimination and necessity and an international humanitarian law. They cannot go in and indiscriminately kill civilians on the ground.
 
CHURCH: Malcolm Davis, many thanks for your military analysis. Appreciate it. 
 
DAVIS: Thank you. 
 
CHURCH: Kansas City Chiefs are back to back Super Bowl champions. A live report from the stadium in Las Vegas next on CNN Newsroom.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[01:17:58]
 
CHURCH: A thrilling finish in the Super Bowl. The Kansas City Chiefs beat the San Francisco 40 Niners with a touchdown and overtime. The Chiefs have now won back to back Super Bowls. In Kansas City thousands of Chiefs fans came together outdoors in very cold temperatures to cheer for their team and the Chiefs most famous fan Taylor Swift was at the game to congratulate her boyfriend Travis Kelce with a kiss and CNN's Andy Scholes is live at the stadium. He joins us now. Great to see you Andy. 
 
So, Kansas City Chiefs defeat the San Francisco 40ers, 25 to 22 in overtime, break it all down for us.
 
ANDY SCHOLES, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: Well, rosemary, I'm standing in the famous endzone where Micole Hardman caught the touchdown to win Super Bowl 58. And what a crazy game this was, you know, it did not go well at the beginning for the Chiefs. It was an offensive struggle. They could not get anything going against that 40ers defense in the first half. 
 
But when that moment mattered the most in the crucial ending of this game, Patrick Mahomes once again does what he always do coming through let's take a look how it all went down. Taylor Swift getting here from Tokyo in plenty of time to watch her boyfriend, Travis Kelce play in Super Bowl 58. 
 
She even chugged her drink when she was shown on the Jumbotron in the middle of this game, but like I mentioned, not a lot of offense in his first half, it's picking up with the Chiefs down 10 to six and punting. This play really changing the game the ball is going to hit a Niners players foot, they could not feel that the Chiefs recovered. Totally swing the momentum in this game because the very next play Patrick Mahomes to Marquez Valdes scantling. 
 
Chiefs take their first lead in the game it was 13 to six at that point. Niners though they would come right back Brock Purdy to Jauan Jennings, Niners go back on top but Jake Moody's extra point was blocked and that was a huge moment in this game because the Chiefs they would kick a field goal in the closing seconds of the fourth quarter to send this game him to overtime, tied at 19.
 <br>[01:20:03]
 
Just a second overtime game in Super Bowl history, Niners will get a field goal and then Mahomes a chance to go 75 yards to win it all and he did just that fighting Micole Hardman for the three yard touchdown to win the Super Bowl chiefs beat the Niners, 25-22 is their third Super Bowl title in five years and Taylor Swift and coming on the field to join in on the celebration given Travis Kelce a big kiss.
 
Mahomes your MVP for the third time and he's already thinking about going for the threepeat. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
PATRICK MAHOMES, KANSAS CITY CHIEFS QUARTERBACK: And we'll celebrate tonight I'm going to celebrate the parade and I'm going to do whatever I can to be back in this game next year. I'm trying to go for that threepeat. So, it's a -- it's an ongoing thing in the NFL. I think Tom said it best is once you win that championship, and you have those parades and you get those rings, you're not the champion anymore. You have to come back with that same mentality. 
 
And I learned from guys like that they had been the greatest of all time at the top of the level. And so that's my mindset is I'm going ot celebrate with my guys because of how we done this. But then we're going to work our way to get back to this game next year.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SCHOLES: Yes, so Rosemary, Patrick Mahomes now three Super Bowl titles in just the last five years. He's the fifth quarterback ever to have three Super Bowl titles. And he's -- the Chiefs joining the Patriots for the first team to win back to back Super Bowls since New England did it back in 2005. 
 
What a game though, Rosemary. I mean, you know, a lot of people were talking early on today. This is not a good Super Bowl. Yes. But it ended one of the best things we've ever seen. And what you can't say anything more about Patrick Mahomes. We are watching a true legend operate right now in the NFL.
 
CHURCH: So let's look at that because the Chiefs win back to back Super Bowls. So where does that put them in the history books not only in this Super Bowl but the way all of the players performed?
 
SCHOLES: Well, they're you know, you got to consider this Kansas City Chiefs team a dynasty Rosemary, because the what they've been able to do you know this -- they've won three Super Bowls in five years, but they've been to four now in the past six years. 
 
And it just -- right now the Super Bowl or the NFL it goes through Kansas City. You know, Patrick Mahomes was an underdog in this game. The 49ers were actually two point favorites. But Mahomes just keeps proving time and time again. And he even said it again after they won the Super Bowl. 
 
They never consider themselves an underdog and when Patrick Mahomes is the underdog he has a record of 11 and three which is just incredible record. And Rosemary, I imagine, you're moving forward, people are going to be even extra cautious if they ever put Mahomes as an underdog in a game. 
 
CHURCH: Wow. Oh no, you had a lot of fun. Andy Scholes joining us live from Las Vegas. Many thanks for that. Appreciate it. 
 
Well, Taylor Swift it wasn't just a good luck charm for the Kansas City Chiefs in Las Vegas. Her impact was felt across the NFL this season. The singer attended the big game to support her boyfriend Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. 
 
The two recently announced they were dating after months of speculation but in that short time, Swift has dominated the headlines and brought her army of Swifties more to the sport, reportedly generating more than $300 million boosted to the Chiefs brand. 
 
So, female viewership of the NFL regular season last year was also up nearly 10 percent. That's according to Nielsen ratings. CNN -- Okay. All right. We're going to take a short break right now. Stay with this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[01:27:00]
 
CHURCH: Back now to our top story, the Israeli military says two hostages held in Gaza and are back in Israel after a covert operation overnight. The two men 60-year-old Fernando Simon Marman and 70-year- old Louis Har are said to be in good condition and are now in a Tel Aviv medical facility. 
 
Israeli forces also say they conducted a series of strikes in Rafah. The Palestine Red Crescent Society now says more than 100 people have been killed in those strikes. This video obtained by CNN shows some of the aftermath the Rafah municipality says at least one mosque was among the targets. 
 
The Senate has taken a step closer to passing a more than $95 billion foreign aid bill with crucial assistance for Ukraine and Israel. The Senate voted Sunday to advance the critical bill with 18 Republicans backing the package despite opposition from former U.S. President Donald Trump. 
 
It comes after Republicans blocked a wider bill that included a bipartisan border deal if the bill is eventually passed by the Senate, it's unclear whether House Speaker Mike Johnson would hold a vote on it. The bill is also expected to include humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza, the West Bank and Ukraine.
 
Former U.S. President Donald Trump's controversial comments on NATO are facing intense criticism from world leaders. The former U.S. president told his supporters at a campaign rally that he would tell Russia to do quote, whatever the hell they want to any NATO member that failed to spend enough on defense. 
 
NATO Chief Jens Stoltenberg says Trump's remarks puts soldiers at risk and U.S. President Joe Biden says Trump will quote abandon our NATO allies. CNN's Alayna Treene has details.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ALAYNA TREENE, CNN REPORTER: Former President Donald Trump on Saturday said he would encourage Russia to do quote, whatever the hell they want to any NATO member country that does not meet its spending obligations. Take a listen to how we put it to supporters in South Carolina yesterday. DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: One of the presidents of a big country stood up said, well, sir, if we don't pay, and we're attacked by Russia, will you protect us? I said you didn't pay your delinquent. He said yes. Let's say that happened. No, I would not protect you. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want. You got to pay.
 
TREENE: Now just a stunning admission from the former president who essentially said that he would not abide by the collective defense clause in that agreement. And look, Donald Trump has long criticized NATO and deemed it as being some a drain on American resources by what he calls freeloaders. 
 
And that's really led a lot of European countries to question whether Donald Trump's potential return to the White House could mean not just the abandonment of the war in Ukraine but a broader American retreat from the continent.
 <br>[01:30:09]
 
Now, I do think it's important to point out the context of these remarks. It comes as many Republicans have been pushing back against aid to Ukraine and also as some European countries have raised the alarm about Russian aggression.
 
Now the White House immediately criticized Trump's remarks. A spokesperson for the White House said, quote, "Encouraging invasions of our closest allies by murderous regimes is appalling and unhinged and it endangers American national security, global stability, and our economy at home.

ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN ANCHOR: Former U.S. president Donald Trump is facing a deadline to file an appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court regarding his presidential immunity claim in the election interference case. And he has until the end of Monday to do so.
 
Last week, a federal appeals court ruled Trump is not immune from prosecution for alleged crimes during his presidency to reverse the 2020 election results. 
 
If his stay request is accepted, the criminal trial will not move forward until the court decides how to rule on his request for a pause.
 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is speaking out about the special counsel report criticizing Joe Bidens age and memory. During an interview on Sunday, Netanyahu said Biden is very clear and very focused. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER: I've had more than a dozen phone conversations -- extended phone conversations with President Biden. He also came on a visit to Israel during wartime, which is a historic first. 
 
And I found him very clear and very focused the way he managed to agree on the war aims and on many things. Sometimes we had disagreements but they weren't born of a lack of understanding on his part or on my part. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: Biden fired back of the special counsel's report, either it came out last week saying, quote, "I know what the hell I'm doing." 
 
Larry Sabato is the director of the Center for Politics of the University of Virginia. He joins me now from Charlottesville. Always good to have you with us 
 
LARRY SABATO, DIRECTOR OF CENTER FOR POLITICS, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA: Always enjoy it Rosemary. Thank you. 
 
CHURCH: So concerns about President Joe Biden's age have been reignited in the wake of last week's release of special counsel Robert Hur's report citing Mr. Biden's alleged mental deterioration during a five-hour interview for an investigation into the president's mishandling of classified documents. How political was that report? 
 
SABATO: I think it was very political, at least the commentary around the decision which actually vindicates Joe Biden. That is, there were no charges filed and clearly, he hadn't done anything wrong, certainly compared to what Donald Trump did with classified documents. 
 
But the language that the special counsel used was laden with terms like "elderly" and "failing in memory", and it made Biden look terrible. And I think it has hurt his candidacy with certain groups. Certainly, those who are concerned about age, although Donald Trump is only three-and-a-half years younger. He's old too. 
 
CHURCH: Yes. And during his response to the damning Hur report, President Biden raised another issue calling Israel's military action in Gaza over the top. 
 
President Biden spoke with Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu on Sunday for the first time in weeks as Israel prepares to evacuate more than 1 million Palestinians sheltering in Gaza's southern city of Rafah and that comes ahead of a planned ground offensive. 
 
Now, we are seeing clear tensions between the two leaders. How much leverage does the U.S. have given its concern ahead of this military offensive and how critical is this issue for President Biden?
 
SABATO: Considering how much money, how many billions the United States has sent Israel, not just over many, many years, but specifically in the aftermath off the attack from Hamas on October 7, you would think that the United States would have some considerable influence. But not with Netanyahu he's going to do it his way. And I think
 
 increasingly he has been alienating the American public, not just American politicians or president. 
 
Now some of them won't say anything publicly. I think President Biden has been slow in putting distance between himself and some of the decisions made by Netanyahu. 
 <br>[01:34:47]
 
SABATO: But he seems to be awakening to the dangers here. He's lost a lot of ground with young people. He's lost a lot of ground with Arab Americans who are normally overwhelmingly Democratic. So we'll have to see. 
 
Finally, Biden is criticizing some things that Netanyahu and the Israeli government have done, but he's got to go a lot further at least if the Israeli offensive against Palestinians in Gaza continues.
 
CHURCH: And meantime, at a campaign rally Saturday night Republican front runner Donald Trump said he would not protect NATO members who don't pay their dues if Russia should ever decide to attack those U.S. allies and Trump added that he would even encourage Russia to do whatever the hell he wants, it wants. His words there.
 
How potentially dangerous is provocative language like this? 
 
SABATO: Oh, it's extremely dangerous. Even though everyone is used to Donald Trump having a disconnect between his mouth and his brain, this was unusually vicious and stupid. The NATO countries privately and publicly have been reacting very negatively. 
 
And again, they know Trump. And yet this goes a step or two or three further than he has gone before in criticizing NATO. You know, mistakes like this, and it is a terrible mistake, can have political consequences for Trump. But much more important, it can have serious geopolitical consequences for NATO. 
 
And it encourages Putin. It encourages Russia. So the fact that Donald Trump has done this, and frankly, there's not been much domestic resonance here. Where are the reactions? And we all know that Republican politicians won't say a word no matter what Donald Trump does. 
 
But you would still think that this would get a lot more attention than a few phrases in a 400-page special counsel reports suggesting what we already know; that Joe Biden, along with Donald Trump, is old.
 
CHURCH: And still on Trump, today is the deadline for his lawyers to decide whether to appeal his immunity case before the U.S. Supreme Court. What impact could that potentially have on the November election and all his other legal woes? 
 
SABATO: The only reason to appeal it is to stretch out the legal process which Trump and his lawyers have been doing since the very beginning of all of these charges and trials. He wants to get as much as possible past the Republican convention or
 
 even past the November 5th election so he's not held accountable by the electorate but for whatever the judges and juries may decide. 
 
But I think it's dangerous for Trump to do too much of that because it becomes perfectly obvious. And in this particular case, there is virtually no chance the Supreme Court will agree with his ridiculous suggestion that he, as president, is somehow invulnerable to any charges of illegality that he may have incurred during his presidential term forever. 
 
It doesn't matter whether he's an office or not, he can never be charged for anything he did. Frankly, that destroys the foundations of the American system. And even this Supreme Court, as conservative and Republican as it is, isn't going to go along with Trump on that. 
 
CHURCH: Larry Sabato, always great to get your political analysis. Many thanks. 
 
SABATO: Thank you, Rosemary.
 
CHURCH: Former Finnish prime minister Alexander Stubb of the National Coalition Party won the presidential run-off on Sunday. 
 
Stubb is the man in glasses being congratulated by everyone as the results are announced. He is pro-European and a strong supporter of Ukraine. Finland joined NATO last year, and the country closed its border with Russia to prevent illegal entry. Officials say the border will remain closed until mid-April.
