PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN HAVANA-BASED CORRESPONDENT: And they said, a shot of adrenaline in your arm. They were not kidding. I wouldn't admit to being afraid, but they were very impressive creatures.
 
(voice-over): Creatures that there are now more and more reasons to try and protect.

ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Hi there. Thanks for joining me. I am Alex Marquardt in today for Fredricka Whitfield. We begin this hour with millions of Americans on the move heading home from the Thanksgiving holiday this weekend and now facing some significant storms which could slow down travel both in the air and on the roads. Today the South is getting hit by heavy rain and the Midwest and Northeast could be their turn to get hit tomorrow.
 
Airports are preparing for a surge of passengers this weekend. Already more than 1600 flights canceled so far today. That number will be expected to rise.
 
Meteorologist Allison Chinchar is in the CNN Weather Center for us. Allison, these delays creeping up. Walk us through what we can expect today and later this weekend.
 
ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST (on camera): Yes. No, not exactly the thing you want to hear if you've got travel plans, whether it's today or tomorrow, because it's really going to impact people not only on the highways, but also the runways. The main concern for today is really going to be in the center portion of the country where we have not only the chance for heavy rain, but also the potential for some severe thunderstorms. Out to the west, we've got another system that's bringing snow showers to the intermountain west. And that's going to continue to fall on the heels of this very first system. So let's take a look. The main concerns in the air for today are going to be places like Kansas City, Memphis, Atlanta, New Orleans, but also out to the west where that other system is you've got possible delays in Salt Lake City, as well as Seattle.
 
Here's a look at what the radar is at the moment. You can see we've got some strong thunderstorms just off the Gulf Coast here of Louisiana, as that frontline of the storm continues to make its way east into Louisiana, Mississippi and eventually in towards Alabama. But also on the north side, you've got showers creeping into Oklahoma City, as well as little rock. This is a very slow moving system.
 
So flooding is going to be a concern not only for Louisiana, but also Mississippi, Alabama and that Western Panhandle portion of Florida. Severe thunderstorms also very likely in a lot of the same spots, damaging winds and isolated tornadoes will be the main threats for cities like Biloxi, Mobile, New Orleans, even over towards Pensacola. But this system is going to make its way off to the northeast in the coming hours, which means by tonight, early tomorrow morning, a lot of cities in the Midwest in the mid-Atlantic are now going to start to get their fair share of that heavy rain as well.
 
So places like Chicago, Cleveland, even the Northeast cities are likely going to see some delays tomorrow. So again, this is the focus for Sunday, Chicago, Cincinnati, Detroit, New York, Boston, D.C., Baltimore, all of these areas likely to have delays not only in the air, but keep in mind those roadways are also likely going to be more congested, and having some standing water on them at times.
 
Out to the West, a brand new system starting to make its way into the Pacific Northwest. So the concern there, Alex, is it's likely also going to cause some delays in cities like Seattle and Portland as well.
 
MARQUARDT: As we've been saying, pack your patience. Allison Chinchar, thanks very much. And with travel back at near pre-pandemic levels, the nation's airports are packed this weekend with millions of holiday travelers. And TSA officials are saying that tomorrow's numbers could be record breaking. Here's CNN Pete Muntean.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PETE MUNTEAN, CNN AVIATION CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): We are in a short lived air travel law but it's all about to come roaring back the Sunday after Thanksgiving when everybody begins coming home all at once. The TSA screened 1.4 million people at airports across the country on Thanksgiving Day. It's the lowest number we've seen since February. But look at the day before 2.4 6 million people screened by the TSA at airports nationwide.
 
That number only six percent off of the same day back in 2019 before the pandemic and just shy of a pandemic era air travel record. Now the question is, Will Sunday hit a pandemic error record and couldn't hit the all time air travel record when the TSA screen 2.8 million people at airports nationwide the Sunday after Thanksgiving back in 2019. I asked TSA Administrator David Pekoske if that's a real possibility this time around.
 
DAVID PEKOSKE, TSA ADMINISTRATOR: This holiday travel here will be the biggest holiday travel period we think since the pandemic So, pre- pandemic on the Sunday following Thanksgiving, almost three million passengers, will be pretty close to that the Sunday following this Thanksgiving.
 
MUNTEAN: These numbers are so important because of all the uncertainty that airlines and passengers faced over the summertime when they canceled 50,000 flights in total due in part to staffing shortages, and that was all compounded by bad weather. The weather this time around has been relatively good and airlines have been on a hiring blitz. In fact, United Airlines canceled no flights network wide on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving.

 <br>[13:05:03]
 
MARQUARDT: Our thanks to Pete Muntean for that story. 
 
Now the official start to the holiday shopping season got off to a strong start yesterday known as Black Friday. And despite inflation driving prices up, consumers were out in full force hunting, as they do for the best deals. The National Retail Federation expects more than 166 million Americans will shop this weekend. That's an increase of about eight million over 2021. CNN's Gloria Pazmino is at Herald Square in front of the Macy's in New York City. Gloria, what are you seeing? What are people telling you?
 
GLORIA PAZMINO, CNN NEWSOURCE NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Well, Alex, I don't know if you're anything like me. I wait until the very last minute to do my holiday shopping. But there are millions of Americans who are out in force this weekend. And they're getting that holiday shopping started this weekend after Thursday, Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Saturday, Sunday, all the way through Monday.
 
And we have been standing here in front of Macy's all morning. Macy's opened its doors around 10:00 a.m. And people were gathered out front waiting to get in. Now on Saturday alone, the National Retail Federation is estimated more than 66 -- 60 million people I should say, 60 million people will be out there shopping. And they're also noting an increase in the amount of people that will be shopping in store.
 
Obviously, post pandemic that is a significant difference both for big business and small business. Today is small business Saturday. 67 percent of shoppers expect to do their shopping in person. Another big increase from the previous year. And I've been speaking to people here and asking them about what you raised at the beginning, which is of course the economy very much in the back of people's minds as they're going through their shopping list, buying those gifts and looking for sales. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
AMY MANCINO, HOLIDAY SHOPPER: We're a little worried about inflation. That's where we're hoping to get some sales.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Everything's gone up this year. I mean, I think as we go out and look for gifts, we're really mindful of how much we -- even the Thanksgiving dinner, you know, was so much more expensive.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
PAZMINO: So people definitely thinking about it, definitely considering it as they make their way around the stores but also out here today hoping to score some of those big discounts and some of those big sales that we expect to see throughout this shopping season. Really, it's not just Black Friday anymore. It's more of a whole season that kicks off yesterday and goes on until the holidays. Alex?
 
MARQUARDT: Yes. A very busy weekend that will head into a very busy gift giving season. Gloria Pazmino on the streets of New York. Thank you very much.
 
Now we are learning new details about the youngest victim of the deadly mass shooting inside the Chesapeake, Virginia Wal-Mart. Officials say that 16-year-old Fernando Chavez-Barron and five other co workers were shot and killed Tuesday, when a manager opened fire Tuesday night in an employee break room. The 16-year-old reportedly used his first paycheck to buy his mother a gift before he was killed.
 
Meantime authorities say they found writings on the gunman's phone, titled Death Note, saying he felt his associates were laughing and mocking him. They also say he had no previous criminal history.
 
And then in Colorado, residents had been showing their support for one of the heroes in the Club Q mass shooting. Richard Fierro reopened his family brewery on Friday for the first time since the deadly attack on the LGBTQ club in Colorado Springs, and long lines quickly formed outside. People even traveling from across the state to rally around the community hero. The former army major is one of two people who police say took down the accused gunman in the nightclub shooting, preventing further harm to people inside the club. But five people were killed and more than a dozen were injured.
 
This afternoon Richard Fierro will join my colleague Jim Acosta at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time, so be sure to tune in for that.
 
China records a disturbing amount of new COVID cases and as the nation doubles down on its zero-COVID policy not all residents are on board getting very angry.
 
Plus, a remarkable rescue in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico. Details on who the passenger was who went overboard and how he spent hours in the ocean. That's coming up.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[13:18:34]
 
MARQUARDT: A cruise ship passenger is very lucky to be alive today after going overboard and then floating alone in the Gulf of Mexico for as many as 15 hours. This is the amazing moment that this man was spotted floating around in the ocean by rescue crews from the U.S. Coast Guard. The search began Thursday after the man sister reported him missing off of the Carnival Cruise Ship that they had been on. CNN's Nadia Romero joins us now. Nadia, what more are you learning about the rescue and how this man is doing?
 
NADIA ROMERO, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Well Alex, you would think after all of that time that he likely wouldn't survive. And so, this was something that one Coast Guard member called a Thanksgiving miracle to be able to not only find this man, but find him alive. And you can just see him kind of bobbing in and out of the water. They're hoping that someone will see him.
 
So let's back this up. This was supposed to be a family vacation on a Carnival Cruise to celebrate the Thanksgiving holiday. But it was Thanksgiving Day that the 28-year-old man's sister told crews authorities I haven't seen my brother in hours and so they started looking for him. Then they reached out to the Coast Guard it became this all hands on deck search with boats and helicopters and airplanes.
 
Finally, to find this man, I want you to hear from the Coast Guard who explains why we should never underestimate the will to live.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LT. SETH GROSS, SEARCH AND RESCUE MISSION COORDINATOR, U.S. COAST GUARD: I'll be honest with you, you know, 17-year career, this case is unlike anything I've been a part of. So, you, I think it kind of blows the norm -- the normalcy out of the water here. And really just shows the world to live is something that you need to account for in every search and rescue case.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ROMERO: So, so many unanswered questions. Like when did he fall overboard? Was it an accident? How long was he in the water exactly? How was he able to still be alive for all those hours? Did he lose hope at any time? I mean, just look at how much he was shifting and moving around in that water. And the Coast Guard says that they were covering about 7000 nautical miles looking for this man, which is about the size of the state of Massachusetts.
 
And when they were looking for him, they were hopeful. But wow, the moment when they found him, Alex, we're learning that he is in the hospital and stable condition. He's suffering from shock, dehydration, hypothermia, all of the above, but he is alive.
 
MARQUARDT: Wow, indeed. Can't wait to hear from him, hear his own story. Just remarkable. Nadia Romero, thank you so much for that report. And we have this quick programming note. What holiday movie do you like to watch every year? Settle with CNN for the stories behind everything that we love to watch at Christmas. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: America has just been through a long Depression and World War II. And many of Hollywood's famous actors went to war. And Jimmy Stewart was one of them.
 
JIMMY STEWART, AMERICAN ACTOR: I'm very proud to be here. And I'm going to do my best to be useful as a soldier in the United States Army.
 
BEN MANKIEWICZ, HOST, TURNER CLASSIC MOVIES: Jimmy Stewart is a pilot, delivered 20 bombing missions. Of course, he had PTSD. He risked his own life on those 20 missions and his men were at risk whenever he sent them up.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Stewart wondered if he could ever return to acting. Something that seemed frivolous. Frank Capra, who is a director of made films for the war effort, understood this about Jimmy Stewart. And he went to Stewart, and he said, this is the right role for you. The main character contemplates suicide. And apparently, that was it.
 
KEN BURNS, DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKER: The film reflects the darkness that the world has emerged from but it's also the optimism that comes from having seen the worst of human beings and understanding that good people triumphed and that good people could triumph.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MARQUARDT: Tis the Season, The Holidays On Screen. That premieres tomorrow night at 8:00. We'll be right back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[13:21:55]
 
MARQUARDT: More than six million households in Ukraine are still without power today following a barrage of Russian missile strikes on Ukraine's critical infrastructure. And we have new satellite images from NASA that shows the extent of the damage with Ukraine almost completely in the dark compared to the light that you can see from neighboring countries. And then as the war rages on, we're seeing Russia's open effort to adopt Ukrainian children and bring them up.
 
As Russian and A.P. investigation found thousands of children have been found in orphanages and basements of war-torn cities all across Ukraine. Randi Thompson is the CEO and cofounder of Kidsave. An organization that aims to protect and provide relief to orphans in crisis. Randy, thank you so much for joining us. And thank you for all that you do. What are your colleagues in Ukraine telling you about what Ukrainian children right now we're going through?
 
RANDI THOMPSON, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, KIDSAVE: Well, our colleagues are very busy trying to make sure that they're providing warmth to those Ukrainian children and families. It's been incredibly tough for kids and tough for all the Ukrainian people. But our goal is to keep children and families together so that they're able to feel safe. For the kids who are in orphanages, we've worked to take those kids out of harm's way.
 
Out of places like Mykolaiv and bring them to mountain areas where they can all stay together so that they are feeling safe. Obviously, Kidsave is a child welfare organization, we are champions for older kids in care. So we're working right now to keep them alive and safe. And then as the war ends, which I know it will, at some point, we're going to go back to really trying to get those kids into families.
 
So, children in Ukraine are suffering. But I'm amazed at the will of the people and how people are banding together to really keep up going.
 
MARQUARDT: And Randi, how does your staff operate as bombs are literally falling all across the country. Like no part of the country is spared?
 
THOMPSON: Yes. And my staff in Ukraine were -- they were child welfare people, and they stepped up and suddenly had become rescue and humanitarian aid folks. And they're going in two incredibly dangerous areas but they go -- they know the areas well which really helps there. They're going into to cover a night, sometimes they are getting bombed, thank goodness, we have not lost anyone.
 
But we're having to move our operations around we're having to move our warehouses around just so that we can keep one step ahead of the enemy
 
MARQUARDT: It's incredibly brave. This war now in its 10th month, how has the situation changed for Kidsave since Russia launched its invasion back in February?
 
THOMPSON: Sure, well, we were in Ukraine working to place children and families and it just happened that the Russian army attacked Mykolaiv and Kherson which was our -- were our two sites that we were really working heavily in as well as Kyiv.
 <br>[13:25:02]
 
And initially we were just trying to get our kids that we'd placed in families out but then we realized the there was this huge gap and started taking families and children out as quickly as we could. In the beginning, almost everyone wanted to leave. But now, more people are staying and in fact, some people are coming back. So our work has shifted from primarily rescue and evacuation to humanitarian aid.
 
And again, this winter bringing generators, bringing wood burning stoves, bringing Do It Yourself repair kits, so people can keep hope alive, stay warm, and stay alive. Big change, of course, is that it's no longer every day that we hear about Ukraine. And so public support for the war is waning some. So that's obviously a challenge for our people, but they're continuing to work. MARQUARDT: Just so many adverse conditions that people all across the country are facing. Randi, if people want to -- if parents -- prospective parents want to -- were interested in adopting a Ukrainian child, what would you advise them to do?
 
THOMPSON: Well, I would say you're going to need to wait because today, Ukraine is under martial law. There is no adoption of Ukrainian children during this war. So the key is to support the Ukrainian people. Let's get through this war. And hopefully, Ukrainian children will be able to stay in the country, but if not, we'll be there to help kids get families wherever they need to find them.
 
MARQUARDT: And it is National Adoption Month here in the United States, November of course. How can viewers who are watching this and listening to you help your efforts?
 
THOMPSON: Children, older children everywhere need families, that's what we're about. And for older kids, sometimes the prospect of finding a family is really daunting. Almost always. There's more than 117,000 kids in the United States right now that are waiting for families, and about 45 percent of them are over the age of 10. So, I would say if someone's thinking about the prospect of adoption, think about an older child.
 
Think about that MPC at your Thanksgiving table and maybe filling it with a child who really doesn't have anyone because a child who exits foster care or an orphanage alone has such a tough chance of making it. But one caring adult in their life can help. So contact your local child welfare authorities, you can contact Kidsave, we can help you to find opportunities to host mentor or adopt an older child.
 
MARQUARDT: Randi Thompson, thank you again for your time and thank you for everything you do. Appreciate it.
 
THOMPSON: Thanks so much for having me and happy Thanksgiving.
 
MARQUARDT: And to you. Still ahead, we have a CNN exclusive as protests rage on in Iran. New disturbing details on the brutality of Iran security forces are coming to light.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[13:32:02]
 
MARQUARDT: Frustration continues to boil over in China over the government's unrelenting zero-COVID policy. Protests have erupted in multiple cities across China demanding an end to strict government COVID restrictions. Chinese officials saying they're necessary to protect lives. 
 
CNN's Selina Wang has more. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SELINA WANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Anger is rising and tragedies are mounting but China showed no sign of budging on zero-COVID. Authorities are clamping down with more lockdowns, mass testing and quarantine, and people are getting more and more frustrated. 
 
Adding to the anger is a fire that broke out in the capital of China's far west Xinjiang region on Thursday night. Ten were killed and nine were injured at a fire in an apartment building. 
 
Most parts of Xinjiang have been in lockdown for more than 100 days. The deadly fire sparked nationwide outrage because widely circulated videos, now censored in China, showed COVID lockdown measures likely delayed firefighters from getting to the scene. 
 
State media claims that people in the compound were allowed to leave the building, that it was considered a low-risk COVID area. 
 
But video shows fire trucks unable to get close to the scene because the compound entrance was partially blocked. The video shows it was blocked with fences and tents and metal barriers that are normally used as part of COVID measures. 
 
The video also shows smoke and flames coming from a high floor of the building but the water failed to actually reach the fire. 
 
What adds to the tragedy is that those who died in the fire likely spent their last three months largely confined to that building if not entirely. 
 
The fire really struck a chord with the public here because we've seen scenes of tragedy and suffering play out over and over again since the start of the pandemic. 
 
Countless stories of people struggling to get enough food, daily necessities, and emergency care in lockdown.
 
Three years into these draconian policies, frustrations are more frequently turning into public protests, which are normally rare in authoritarian China. 
 
Last week, in the southern city of Guangzhou, some residents revolted by tearing down barriers and marching through the streets. There were violent clashes at the Foxconn factory this week.
 
But still there's no end in sight to zero-COVID. 
 
Selina Wang, CNN, Beijing. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
MARQUARDT: Our thanks to Selina Wang.
 
Let's bring in Susan Shirk. She is the former deputy assistant secretary of state for Pacific affairs, and the chair of the China Center at the University of California in San Diego. 
 
Susan, thank you so much for joining me. 
 
You're also the author of a new book called "Overreach: How China Derailed Its Peaceful Rise." We have seen people pushing back on COVID restrictions in China
 
 before, but these scenes are just remarkable. Do you feel that this is different somehow? 
 <br>[13:34:56]
 
SUSAN SHIRK, CHAIR, CHINA CENTER, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO &amp; FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE, BUREAU OF PACIFIC AFFAIRS: Well, it is different. It's clearly a nationwide crisis for the party leadership because demonstrations are breaking out not just in one area but in cities throughout China.
 
Including Beijing, which, of course, is right next door to where the leadership lives and works and is always the most-sensitive area. 
 
I've gotten some reports from people in China who feel that this definitely is a national political crisis. 
 
MARQUARDT: How rare is this kind of protest in China? 
 
SHIRK: Well, actually, protests occur all the time. They're usually very small and local. 
 
And these protests are, by and large, small and local, too. But they're happening simultaneously and around one key issue, which is the fact that people are being harmed or are suffering.
 
Including some people dying not from COVID but from the extreme zero- COVID policy, the lockdowns, the constant testing, which, of course, is dragging down the economy, but also now causing this public backlash. 
 
MARQUARDT: Despite the lockdowns and the constant testing, as you say, China is now facing more COVID cases than ever before. So, how did that happen? 
 
SHIRK: Well, it's a very contagious disease. And in many cases, I think people lined up for testing are spreading the disease to one another. 
 
What happened on November 4th is that the central government tried to make its policies more flexible so that they wouldn't clash so much with the economic issues related to -- you know to wouldn't drag down the economy so much and wouldn't lead to so much public discontent. 
 
But in the process of adjusting the policies, while at the same time claiming that they weren't changing the policy at all, but they were what they call 20 points now of how to make the policy more flexible, that was on November 4th. 
 
The consequence of that was that local officials are really in an impossible situation because they don't know which rules to follow. 
 
And it also makes people feel that there's a chance to push back against the extreme lockdowns and controls, citing these new 20 points as the justification. MARQUARDT: As we heard from Selina Wang at the end of her report, no
 
 end in sight to some of these more draconian measures. 
 
Susan Shirk, we have to leave it there. Thank you so much for your time today. Appreciate it. 
 
SHIRK: OK. Sure. 
 
MARQUARDT: In Iran, the situation continues to be volatile as the government intensifies its crackdown, particularly in the Kurdish parts of the country. 
 
A human rights group based in Norway tells CNN at least 13 people have been killed recently in Kurdish cities. 
 
Eyewitnesses tell CNN that sexual violence is also being used to suppress, to demoralize and, in some cases, blackmail protesters. 
 
CNN's Nima Elbagir has this exclusive report. 
 
We do have to warn you, however, that this story, this report contains details of sexual violence. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): Over these mountains is Iran, a regime that has succeeded in cutting many of its people off from the outside world.
 
But disturbing stories detailing the authorities' brutal retribution, systematic sexual violence against anti-regime protesters, have begun leaking out.
 
We've come here to the Kurdish region of Iraq to try and find out more. 
 
This is Hannah (ph), not her real name, a Kurdish Iranian woman recently smuggled out of Iran. She fears for her life.
 
After taking off and burning her head scarf on the streets, she was arrested and detained by Iranian intelligence officers.
 
HANNAH (ph), KURDISH IRANIAN SMUGGLED OUT OF IRAN (through translation): They choose the women who were pretty and suited their appetites. Then the officer would take one of them from the cell to a smaller, private room. They would sexually assault them there.
 
ELBAGIR: Hannah (ph) isn't only an eyewitness. She also was violated.
 
HANNAH (ph) (through translation): I feel shy talking about this. You can still see what the policeman did. Look here, on my neck. It's purplish. That is why I'm covering it. He forced himself on me. 
 <br>[13:40:09]
 
ELBAGIR: Then a fight broke out with another protester, drawing away Hannah (ph)'s attacker. Hannah (ph) and others could hear screams and they believe a woman was raped in an interrogation room.
 
Hannah (ph) sketched out the police station as she remembers it. She estimates 70 to 80 men and women were together in a main hall that accessed four private interrogation rooms.
 
It was in these interrogation rooms, she says, that she was assaulted and others were raped.
 
CNN was able to locate the police station through Hannah (ph)'s description, eyewitness corroboration, and geolocation, using key landmarks. It's in the Islamabad neighborhood of Irmir (ph).
 
Based on this testimony and speaking to a number of sources, a pattern of repression comes into focus.
 
Police centers used as filtration points, moving protesters from one location to another, often families left not knowing where their loved ones are held.
 
One Iraq-based Kurdish militant opposition party, PAK, identified over 240 people who they believe are missing within this maze of detention centers. 
 
Human rights organizations believe the number is higher, in the thousands.
 
Some of the victims as young as 14. Many are men supporting female protesters. Their punishment as severe as the women's.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translation): They brought four men over who had been beaten, screaming intensely in another cell. 
 
And one of the men who was tortured was sent to the waiting room where I was. I asked him what all that screaming was about. He said, "They are raping the men."
 
ELBAGIR: Based on witness testimony, CNN traced the location to an Iranian army intelligence headquarters. 
 
Voiced here by a translator, a 17-year-old boy sent CNN a voice note following his imprisonment. We are withholding his name and location for his safety.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translation): When a security guard heard me discussing the rape of the other inmates, he started torturing me all over again. They tortured, raped me from behind.
 
ELBAGIR: Even as authorities visited sexual violence on protesters, regime figures accused female protesters of prostitution, of quote, "wanting to be naked."
 
Of the incidents of sexual violence against protesters inside Iranian detention facilities, most occurred in the Kurdish majority areas to the West of Iran, home to a historically oppressed minority.
 
Disturbingly, in some cases, the rapes were filmed and used to blackmail protestors into silence.
 
There has been a real escalation, where female protesters are, as you can see here, being openly assaulted, often sexually.
 
But the violence against women, like the protests, are not confined to the Kurdish areas. They're often focused on locations where the protests are most intense, like here in the capital, Tehran.
 
ARMITA ABBASI, PROTESTOR: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
 
ELBAGIR: One of these stories is Armita Abbasi's, a typical 20-year- old on social media, sharing her love of animals.
 
ABBASI: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
 
ELBAGIR: In social media posts appearing under her name, Abbasi, like many young women in Iran, criticized the regime openly after the protests began. Unlike most, she did it without anonymity. 
 
It didn't take long for security forces to find and arrest her. Abbasi disappeared.
 
Soon after, whistleblowers began to post on various social media platforms, medics, sharing eyewitness accounts of what had been done to Abbasi.
 
"First of all," they say, "there were a few plain clothes men with her and they did not let her out of their sight. Even during a private medical examination, they were there."
 
"She was my patient. I went to her bedside. They had shaved her hair. She was scared and was trembling."
 
"When she first came in, they said it was rectal bleeding due to repeated rape. The plainclothesmen insisted that the doctor write that the rape was from prior to her arrest." 
 
"And then after this issue was becoming obvious to all, they changed the entire scenario altogether."
 
The details of these leaks were confirmed to CNN by an insider at Imam Ali (ph) Hospital, where Abbasi was brought to be examined. 
 
In a statement, the government said Abbasi was treated for "digestive problems." The medics who treated her said that was not true.
 
The Iranian regime denies the rape, accusing her of leading protests, an allegation which could see her face the death penalty.
 <br>[13:44:59]
 
At this usually busy border crossing between Iraq and Iran, it is deceptively quiet. Those who can cross tell us the noose is tightening on protesters.
 
Authorities have for decades used sexual torture against Iranians. And it appears once more a familiar pattern, sexual violence deployed to enforce an assertion of moral guardianship.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
MARQUARDT: Our thanks to Nima Elbagir for that hugely important report. 
 
CNN did reach out to the Iranian government for comment but have not heard back. 
 
We'll be right back.

MARQUARDT: And now to the major showdowns at the World Cup. The U.S. men's soccer team will play a must-win game against Iran on Tuesday in order to advance to the next stage of World Cup play.
 
In minutes, Argentina will kick off against Mexico following a shocking loss to Saudi Arabia earlier this week. 
 
CNN's Patrick Snell joins me now. 
 
Patrick, what is the latest from Doha? 
 
PATRICK SNELL, CNN ANCHOR, "WORLD SPORT": Hi, Alex. Yes, a busy, busy Saturday in progress. 
 
I want to get to this first because, within the last few minutes, the reigning world champions France are through to the last 16 of the tournament, beating Denmark by 2-1. 
 
Who gets both their goals? Only the Paris-Saint Germain Superstar Kylian Mbappe. He gets the win. The 23-year-old, a prolific talent. His third goal of the tournament. He now co-leads in the race for the coveted Golden Boot with Valencia of Ecuador. 
 
As you said, Alex, 10 minutes from now, it's all eyes on Argentina, Mexico. Argentina desperate to get back on track after that shock for the ages against Saudi Arabia in their opener. That has gone down as one of the biggest shocks in World Cup history. 
 
The team lineups are out. Superstar Lionel Messi confirmed in the starting lineup for Argentina. The 35-year-old already indicating this is most likely his last ever World Cup. 
 
Why does it matter so much to him? In 2014, he suffered the heartbreak and the heartache of being a losing finalist in Brazil eight years ago. 
 
Plot twist alert, though, Alex, Mexico are coached by an Argentine.
 
Back to you. 
 
MARQUARDT: And I understand there's a special moment during the Poland/Saudi game today? 
 
SNELL: This was really, really emotional to watch. Poland desperate for the win. They would get that win by two goals. 
 
It was extra special for revered Polish striker, the veteran Robert Lewandowsky, who finally gets his first ever World Cup goal. The 34- year-old, who is a ruthless predator in front of goal, when it comes to putting the ball in the back of the net, in domestic club competition. 
 
And now Barcelona. And the emotion so high on the face. You could see him fighting back the tears. Look at those images. His teammates, the whole squad piling on top of him because they knew exactly how much that meant to him. Lewandowsky, Alex, with his first ever FIFA World Cup goal. 
 
Back to you. 
 
MARQUARDT: What a moment. Another big, big day in Qatar. 
 
Patrick Snell, thank you very much. Appreciate it. 
 
Back here in the states, the other kind of football. It is a big rivalry weekend in college football. 
 
Ohio State and Michigan, the numbers two and three-ranked teams in the country, are squaring off in a big game that will have a major impact on the college football playoff picture. 
 
CNN's Carolyn Manno has more on what the governors of Michigan and Ohio have riding on this game. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
CAROLYN MANNO, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Alex, college football fans know how fierce this rivalry is, especially with Michigan and Ohio State coming into this game undefeated. 
 
But this is a friendly wager between the two governors. It's one that is in keeping with tradition. 
 
Michigan's Gretchen Whitmer inquired about running last year's wager back this year on Twitter. She put some skin in the game with some of Detroit's delicacies, including Buddy's Pizza and a case Vernor's ginger ale. 
 
Ohio's Mike DeWine offered up pizza, root bear and cream puffs from several well-known Ohio stops.
 
You'll notice there's no "M"s in the tweet. That is by design. You will not see any of those from Ohio States and their fan base before this game, especially with a chance to all but clinch a playoff spot on the line. 
 
Whoever wins, it's a virtual loss, the losers has to hope for a little bit of chaos in order to squeeze into the field. But maybe some comfort food for the governors will help, depending who comes out on top.

MARQUARDT: As the son as an Ohioian, go Buckeyes.
 
Carolyn Manno, thank you very much.

Next, a stunning new image of planet earth. And the photo credit goes to the unmanned spacecraft that is currently on a lunar mission. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[13:58:47]
 
MARQUARDT: This week, a stunning image to remind all of us of our place in this great big universe. This is one of the first photos from the uncrewed Orion spacecraft, a part of the NASA Artemis mission that launched earlier this month. 
 
That humbling blue dot in the center of the screen is our home, planet earth. You can't help but be reminded of the great astronomer, Carl Sagan, and his 1994 book "A Pale Blue Dot." 
 
And although his words were inspired by an image of earth taken by Voyager 1 in 1990, they still ring true. 
 
Sagan saying, in part, "Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it, everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you've ever heard of, every human being who ever was lived out their lives."  
 
He goes on, "There's perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known."  Carl Sagan. 
 
Thanks so much for joining me today. I'm Alex Marquardt.
