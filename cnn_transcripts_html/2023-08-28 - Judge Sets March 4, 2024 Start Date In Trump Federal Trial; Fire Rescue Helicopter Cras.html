BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN ANCHOR: Breaking news into CNN. A federal judge has just set the trial date for former President Donald Trump on charges that he tried to overturn the 2020 presidential election, March 4, 2024.
 
CNN's Evan Perez outside the federal courthouse in Washington, DC. He just sprinted out of the courtroom. Evan, take us there. How did this unfold?
 
EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Boris, this was a quite a heated hearing from the part of the former president's lawyers who were pushing for a much later court trial date. They said that the former president is not going to be able to get a fair trial if he is forced to go to trial in the next few months. In part, they say they're buried under millions and millions of pages of discovery from the prosecution.
 
Things that they say they have to go through. They noted that at least the lawyers don't even have their final security clearances yet to be able to review some of the classified information that they expect that they're going to be able to get.
 
The judge pushed back very, very strongly. She said that the public has a -- an interest or had a right in a prompt and efficient resolution of this -- of this matter. She set March four for the trial to get started.
 <br>[11:35:02]
 
Now, that's right before -- I believe, right before the Iowa caucuses -- or I'm sorry, right before the Super Tuesday. So, that obviously brings up the political question right for the former president because you're looking at a period where according to the prosecution is going to be four or five weeks of trial where he might have to spend his weekdays sitting here at the federal court while he goes on trial in this case.
 
The judge, Judge Tanya Chutkan, pushed back strongly when the former president's lawyers said that they just didn't have the time to prepare. She said, you know, I've seen defendants who've had maybe read -- not that -- not the resources to have their lawyers prepare for trial. She noted this is not the case.
 
John Lauro, one of the former president's attorneys, really made a strong push again, an impassioned plea for a much later date. He said, what the prosecution was trying to get was a show trial, not a speedy trial. So, you see there from the proceedings here today that this judge, you know, Judge Chutkan, she was not very patient with the idea of waiting until 2026.
 
I should note. She said that she had a conversation with a judge in New York where the former president and he's also facing a criminal trial related to the hush money payments there in New York, she said she talked to the judge there because she realized that it might overlap with that case there. Nonetheless, she said that she was setting this date on obviously, there's a lot of room between now and seven months from now, where the two sides are going to fight this out and try to push that date even further, at least on the part of the former president, Boris.
 
SANCHEZ: A major decision by Judge Chutkan, March 4, 2024. As you noted, Evan, one day before Super Tuesday on March 5. One of the biggest days on the primary calendar. Evan Perez, thanks so much for breaking that news to us. Rahel?
 
RAHEL SOLOMON, CNN BUSINESS ANCHOR: All right, Boris. Coming up. A terrifying moment in the skies over Florida ends in a fiery helicopter crash. What we're learning about who was on board? Plus, as we said, a trial date set for the day before Super Tuesday, how all of this is going to play out for the former president on the campaign trail? Coming up.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:41:40]
 
SOLOMON: Welcome back. Two major hearings this morning for former President Trump. One in DC and one in Fulton County, Georgia. And we are getting lots of details from inside those courtrooms.
 
SANCHEZ: Yes. Just moments ago, we learned that in the federal hearing in Washington, DC, the judge there setting a trial start date of March 4, 2024, just one day before one of the most important days on the primary calendar, Super Tuesday. We're joined now by Democratic strategist and former executive director for the New York State Democratic Party, Basil Smikle, and Republican strategist and former RNC communications director, Doug Heye.
 
Doug, I want to start with you because Donald Trump has a lot of momentum and he's maintained momentum as we've seen all of these legal processes play out. I have to imagine that with a trial start date of March 4, he's going to use that going into March 5.
 
DOUG HEYE, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Well, I think actually, by March 5, we'll know who the nominee is. Ultimately, I think this primary season comes down to the Iowa caucuses. Iowa typically -- and I've worked in Iowa running comps for the 2012 caucus. Iowa typically is what winnows the field out. You lose an Iowa you come in fourth place, fifth place, or worse, you drop out. But if Donald Trump wins Iowa, it's very clear then that he's going to have the momentum going into New Hampshire where he's also leading in the polls. And a Donald Trump who wins Iowa and New Hampshire is not going to be beaten in the Republican primary.
 
SOLOMON: So, Basil, let's say that that continues seeing the momentum that Trump still clearly has. I mean, is he the person that Biden and the Democrats want to face again in 2024? And I want to just show you this Quinnipiac University poll, which showed a hypothetical 2024 matchup, Biden and Trump pretty much neck and neck.
 
BASIL SMIKLE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, Biden-Trump 2.0, I'm not scared of that. I don't think the Democrats are scared of that. Frankly, if you think about and look at all of those issues that are still top of mind for voters, particularly reproductive rights, I think those have mobilizing issues, you know.
 
He's done well on the economy. He doesn't get the credit that he should and we get that. But he's been great on the economy in terms of playing defense if you will on those -- on those reproductive rights issues that are now in the States.
 
I think Democrats see that as a winning issue. And, frankly, when you look at the ways in which independents and disaffected Republicans came out with Democrats in 2022, I still think that's a winning coalition in 2024.
 
SOLOMON: But let's say the economy remains the primary issue. What would it take for him to get credit for the economy? Because you're right, he doesn't -- he doesn't need credit, at least with Americans on polling.
 
SMIKLE: I think continuing to still talk about it. I don't think he should be speaking a lot about you know, what's happening with Donald Trump. Maybe minimally.
 
He's the best surrogate for his own record on the economy. Continue to do that. Those are -- you know, for Democrats, a lot of what we're discussing is built in. For independents and Republicans that want to vote for Democrats, continue to talk about those economic issues.
 
I think they just keep hammering it away. They've got some really great media buys, particularly in the -- in swing states with voters of color. That all helps.
 
SANCHEZ: The White House has not gone directly after president -- former President Trump for his legal woes, and neither have a lot of Republicans, Doug. A lot of those folks on the debate stage last week raised their hand saying they would support Donald Trump, even if he was convicted. Does that change as we get closer to the primaries?
 <br>[11:45:05]
 
HEYE: Well, I would hope it would, but it probably doesn't. Everything that we've seen thus far suggests that it wouldn't. And it's not just that they're not criticizing or going after or attacking Donald Trump in a way that they would any other candidate for any other race.
 
The reality is, when Donald Trump gets indicted, not only does it sort of reinforce his core message that the system's rigged and there's two tiers of justice and all of that, but his own opponents reinforced that language. If you're running against Donald Trump but you back him up, you're strengthening him. You're not -- you're not weakening him. You're not helping your case to become president.
 
But I would say. I know that Democrats look at this race and think, well, we'll probably do pretty well against Donald Trump. But there's a real reality here of being careful what you wish for. That's exactly what Democrats thought in 2016.
 
They thought there was no way that Donald Trump could beat Hillary Clinton. And he did. And we saw what the results were from that. I tell Democrats. Be really careful of what you wish for on this.
 
SOLOMON: Doug -- 
 
SANCHEZ: Your rhetoric?
 
SMIKLE: No, it's a -- you know it's absolutely -- I mean, he's right. If there's -- it's a -- there's a good chance that Donald Trump can win. And so for Democrats, you can't take -- you can't be complacent at all. I think Hakeem Jeffries, and interestingly enough, I also think, Nancy Pelosi, they're in a great position to actually help make the Democrats' case down ballot.
 
If you think about reproductive rights, for example, in many ways, the Republicans are responding in the ways they did with the Affordable Care Act. They got power, they got what they wanted, and didn't have a solution at the other end. I think -- and you saw that play out on the GOP debate stage.
 
So, what that gives is an opportunity for Democrats to hit every Republican on the most draconian policies that are being put forth in states all the way down ballot. We do that. If we stick to the script, then I think we have an opportunity to get more seats back, particularly in New York and California, and I think gives President Biden a boost.
 
SOLOMON: Doug, as we learn more about these trial dates, and they're set, Ambassador Bolton made the point earlier when speaking to Boris that a conviction might change minds in a way that investigations and indictments happen. Do you see it that way?
 
HEYE: Potentially. So, look. All those candidates who raised their hand and said they'd support Donald Trump if he were convicted, that's being convicted in theory not convicted in practice. So certainly, you could see some people peel away from that. And you could certainly bet that those Republicans -- those voters, independent voters, soft Republicans who voted for Donald Trump in 2016, but then went to Joe Biden in 2020, indictment and certainly conviction, don't want to go in that -- in that direction. 1 It also highlights -- or what a -- what a lot of the conversation is going to be. Basil's telling us very specifically what Democrats want to be talking about, Donald Trump's personal and legal problems and the issue of abortion. Notice they're not talking about the economy. It's still very rocky ground for Joe Biden right now, looks to continue for a long time. This is not the terra firma that they want to be on.
 
SANCHEZ: Basil, quickly to you. Put you on the spot. You said you were comfortable with a Donald Trump-Joe Biden rematch. Who do the Democrats not want to face?
 
SMIKLE: Wow, that's a great question. I can't say that they don't want to face anyone. What I would say is that with anyone on the ballot, and that includes Donald Trump, there's a chance that Democrats don't win.
 
We saw that turnout in very key areas with key constituencies. Was lower than we wanted it to be in 2024. If those voters don't come out, if we can't make that case in 2024, it's going to be a problem. It doesn't matter who's on the ballot against him.
 
SOLOMON: So, it'll be an interesting matchup regardless of who it is. Basil Smikle, Doug Heye, thank you both. We appreciate it.
 
HEYE: Thank you.
 
SANCHEZ: We do have some incredible new videos out of Florida to share with you. A helicopter crashing onto the roof of a building. The latest details, just moments away.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:53:05]
 
SOLOMON: Welcome back. And developing at this hour. Two people were taken to a hospital after a fire rescue helicopter crash this morning. It happened in Pompano Beach, Florida. The crash happened just after 8:45 this morning, Eastern Time.
 
And take a look at this stunning video. So, you see the trail of smoke from the helicopter and then that sudden tailspin where it eventually crashes into the roof of the building. You'll see it happen here.
 
I want to bring in CNN's Pete Muntean. He is live for us at Dulles International Airport. Dulles -- Pete, what more can you tell us?
 
PETE MUNTEAN, CNN AVIATION CORRESPONDENT: Well, we're just into hearing this now from Pompano City -- Pompano Beach City spokesperson Sandra King. She said four people were taken to the hospital. Two crew members on board the helicopter. Two civilians on the ground.
 
This really tells an incredible story that the civilians on the ground actually tried to help the crew members of the helicopter out of the wreckage. And incredibly, none of those four people were taken to the hospital with critical injuries. Not much is known beyond that about their condition.
 
But it's incredible when you see that video so dramatic and disturbing of this Pompano -- sorry, this Broward County Police Department Fire Rescue Helicopter spinning out of control. You can see the side of the helicopter apparently on fire behind the engines in front of the tail rotor boom there. And then that fire is so intense that the tail rotor boom actually separates from the rest of the helicopter, causing it to spiral counterclockwise out of control. It is terribly hard to fly a helicopter without a tail rotor. You need it to go straight.
 
That helicopter came down on an apartment building in Pompano Beach there. You can see the crater. And there is some video surfacing online of folks -- actually, first responders putting up a ladder and the crew of the helicopter coming down on a ladder from the roof of that apartment building.
 <br>[11:55:06]
 
The flight track also tells a pretty interesting story here. That helicopter took off about 8:45 this morning from the Pompano Beach air park, lifted the West, didn't get very far away, only about a mile, got up to a low altitude, 650 feet and then tried to turn back. Clearly, they were trying to make it back with some sort of apparent problem but now investigators have their work cut out for them, Rahel.
 
SOLOMON: Just an incredible video. And, Pete, incredible description of what all happened. Thank you.
 
SANCHEZ: They're lucky to be OK. Rahel, this was fun. We should do it again tomorrow.
 
SOLOMON: Let's do it.
 
SANCHEZ: Yes.
 
SOLOMON: Same time.
 
SANCHEZ: Thanks so much for joining us today. This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL. "INSIDE POLITICS" is up next.
