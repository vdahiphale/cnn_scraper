LYNDA KINKADE, CNN ANCHOR:  It is 8:00 a.m. in Sydney, midnight in Paris, and 6:00 p.m. here in Atlanta. I'm Lynda Kinkade in for Julia Chatterley. 
 
 And wherever you are in the world, this is your "First Move."
 
A very warm welcome to "First Move." Here is today's need to know. Not political. France defends the arrest of Russian-born founder of the social 
 
 media app Telegram. Massive air attack. Ukraine targeted by 127 missiles and 109 drones in what was the biggest air attack since Russia's invasion. 
 
 More talks on Gaza. Negotiators meet in Cairo to discuss a ceasefire and hostage release deal. And out of office, out of reach. Australia gives 
 
 workers the right to disconnect. More details on that story coming up.
 
But we start in Ukraine, which is dealing with the aftermath of what officials are calling the most -- the massive air attack since the war 
 
 began. Ukrainian authorities say hundreds of Russian drones and missiles were fired overnight into Monday.
 
We have some video obtained by Reuters, which shows a projectile targeting a reservoir. The attacks have killed at least seven people and have damaged 
 
 the country's energy infrastructure. Ukraine's president has vowed to respond.
 
Meanwhile, Ukraine says its troops are now seizing more territory inside Russia in the Kursk region. Our Frederik Pleitgen reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A close call for these Ukrainian soldiers, filming a missile impacting in a 
 
 reservoir close by.
 
Part of the massive Russian rocket and drone blitz destroying Ukrainian energy infrastructure and leaving residents scrambling for safety. Some 
 
 inside the Kyiv subway.
 
These people singing, who else will stand up for our freedom today if not you, if not me?
 
Kyiv says Russia launched more than 120 missiles and more than 100 drones. While many were intercepted, others struck areas across Ukraine.
 
Putin sticks to his style, Ukraine's president says. He's a sick creature, and that's been obvious for a long time. But it's also clear that he could 
 
 only do what the world allows him to do, weakness, lack of decisions, fuel terror.
 
The strike's possible retaliation for Ukraine's incursion into the Kursk region in Russia. And Vladimir Putin's army still appears unable to stop 
 
 Ukrainian troops advancing there. Kyiv's saying their forces are making gains even three weeks into the operation.
 
And another possible blow for the Russian leader. After Putin visited Azerbaijan last week, the founder of the Telegram messaging app, Pavel 
 
 Durov, was arrested in France, revealing Durov was in Azerbaijan at the same time as Putin. The Kremlin quick to claim Putin didn't meet with Durov 
 
 in Baku.
 
DMITRY PESKOV, KREMLIN SPOKESMAN (through translator):  We don't know yet what exactly Durov is accused of. We haven't heard any official statements 
 
 on this matter yet. And before we say anything, we need to wait for the situation to become clearer. What exactly are they trying to incriminate 
 
 Durov with?
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over):  French media reports Durov's arrest warrant is related to Telegram's alleged failure to moderate content, reportedly 
 
 facilitating money laundering, drug trafficking, and the spread of pedophilic material on the platform. Telegram says Durov has nothing to 
 
 hide.
 
There have been questions about Pavel Durov's possible relations with the Kremlin. On Moscow's streets, support for the Russian social media mogul.
 
It's connected to the fact that the man sticks to his principles, this man says, and his main principle is freedom of speech.
 
Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Berlin.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
KINKADE:  Well, Colonel Cedric Leighton joins me now. He's a senior military analyst and retired U.S. Air Force officer. He's also a founding 
 
 member of CYFORIX, a global cybersecurity consulting firm. Good to have you with us.
 
COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  :  And good to be with you, Lynda.
 <br>[18:05:00]
 
KINKADE:  So, let's start with Russia's aerial attack, which has been described as a nightmare by a lawmaker in Ukraine. One of the largest 
 
 aerial attacks we've seen since the war began, lasting over eight hours. Moscow is clearly embarrassed by Ukraine's incursion inside of Russia. Is 
 
 this a direct response to that?
 
LEIGHTON:  I think it's part of a direct response, Lynda. I think what the Russians are doing is they're figuring out exactly how they want to handle 
 
 the Kursk incursion. One of the things that they might do is they might let the Ukrainian forces that have invaded that particular area, those about 
 
 488 square miles that they've taken, they might use that as basically a ploy to draw the Ukrainians further into Russia and then perhaps do 
 
 something else from a military perspective.
 
But as far as the missile strikes and rocket strikes are concerned that occurred overnight, those are, you know, clearly a Russian reaction. And 
 
 the idea there is to decimate as much of the Ukrainian infrastructure as possible. The volume of attacks, the targets that were used, some of them, 
 
 deliberate, some of them more indiscriminate, was clearly designed, in my mind, to really be a message to the Ukrainians not to go too far into any 
 
 other region in Russia, but also, to limit their activities. Plus, it's a warning that a large part of the Ukrainian infrastructure could be 
 
 destroyed by the Russians.
 
KINKADE:  Yes, exactly. And of course, an adviser to the Ukrainian president took to the messaging app Telegram to post, the desire to destroy 
 
 our energy will cost the Russians dearly their infrastructure.
 
And just speaking of that app, we know the Russian founder and CEO has been arrested. French prosecutors claiming that his platform is complicit in 
 
 aiding fraudsters, money launderers, drug traffickers. Given you're a member of -- a founding member of a global security consulting firm, what 
 
 can you tell us about Telegram and how much oversight is there?
 
LEIGHTON:  So, most people look at Telegram as being an encrypted app that allows them to communicate privately. The fact of the matter is that is not 
 
 precisely the case. There are aspects of Telegram that can be encrypted in an end-to-end encryption way. But what it really does is it facilitates a 
 
 lot of communications, some of them private, some of them more public.
 
And in fact, a lot of the group chats that -- or the equivalent of group chats that, Telegram can host, that provides a lot of groups in many 
 
 different countries. The option of communicating very cheaply and very directly. but those communications are by their very nature, not encrypted.
 
And what that means is that they are -- they can be intercepted by law enforcement or intelligence agencies. And that, of course, it makes it 
 
 difficult to claim that this app is one that is really there for the privacy of participants or customers.
 
KINKADE:  And of course, we know that the E.U. has been cracking down on social media platforms. But it's quite unprecedented for a CEO of a social 
 
 media company to be arrested in this way. Should other executives of other platforms be concerned?
 
LEIGHTON:  Well, I think they certainly should be because it -- what it shows is, as you mentioned, the E.U. is definitely cracking down on this, 
 
 and it's possible that legal authorities in the various E.U. member nations may decide to take action against other leaders of other social media 
 
 companies.
 
Of course, your defenders are going to say, well, you don't interrogate the head of a telephone company for having bad people working -- on using your 
 
 instrument to communicate, you know, various crimes or the planning of various crimes. However, social media efforts are, you know, definitely 
 
 different than social media platforms because of their ubiquitous nature have drawn a lot more criticism and a lot more legal scrutiny for the fact 
 
 that they do facilitate a lot of bad actors' actions, anything from drug trafficking to child pornography.
 
And, of course, these platforms, including Telegram, have been used by terrorist organizations, including ISIS. And that, of course, draws the 
 
 attention of intelligence agencies, and it draws the attention of the law enforcement agencies in various countries.
 
KINKADE:  Colonel Cedric Leighton, always great to have you on the show. Thanks so much for your time.
 
Well, after a weekend of intense cross-border attacks, Israel and Hezbollah appear to be stepping back from an all-out war. The Lebanese militants say 
 
 their retaliation for the killing of a senior leader last month is now complete, and Israeli authorities have lifted security restrictions in the 
 
 country's northernmost territory. But Iran's next move remains unclear, as it also swore retaliation after the killing of a Hamas leader in Tehran.
 <br>[18:10:00]
 
Well, meanwhile, negotiators are meeting in Cairo, where they'll continue to work towards a ceasefire in Gaza. Our Jim Sciutto is following all the 
 
 developments from Tel Aviv and joins us now live. Good to see you, Jim.
 
So, for weeks, we've been discussing the potential threat of retaliation from Hezbollah and Iran. Describe how this playing out, and can we expect 
 
 any more or will this be it?
 
JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF U.S. SECURITY ANALYST:  You know, this -- you get a sense of dodging a bullet, right? Because the attacks, while significant 
 
 yesterday, biggest exchange of fire in months in the north, Israel seemed to have gotten wind in advance, intelligence, including with the help of 
 
 the U.S., to carry out these preemptive strikes that took out many of these Hezbollah firing positions before they were able to fire.
 
Now, Hezbollah was still able to fire several hundred missiles and drones toward the north, but the vast majority of those were taken out by Israel's 
 
 air defenses. And now, you have Hezbollah claiming something of a success with this. So, perhaps for now, they have carried out their retaliation for 
 
 now, and following that, a relative sense of calm.
 
But I do think that people can forget that the northernmost part of Israel is and has remained evacuated since just after the October 7th attacks. Ten 
 
 months later, more than 60,000 Israelis forced to flee south for their safety. And that includes the schools. And we're coming up on the start of 
 
 another school year here. And we went to visit one of those schools. It was forced to build an entirely new campus 20 miles south of the Lebanese 
 
 border.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SCIUTTO (voice-over):  On Kibbutz Dafna, less than two miles from the Lebanese border, students at the Har VaGai school fled just after October 
 
 7th, quickly abandoning their lockers. Those mandatory evacuation orders came almost a year ago now, yet the threat remains more present than ever. 
 
 Last month, a rocket burst through the roof of the school's gym.
 
And just this past weekend, the most intense crossfire along the border this year.
 
RAVIT ROSENTAL, HEAD HAR VAGAI SCHOOL:  This the sign of our school. It's a written Har VaGai School. And those three buildings are ours.
 
SCIUTTO (voice-over):  Now, as a new school year begins, head of school, Ravit Rosenthal, has built an entirely new school, 20 miles south, for more 
 
 than 1,000 displaced students. Instead of a tree lined campus set around a babbling brook, classes will take place this year in once empty warehouses. 
 
 On September 1st, they hope, a new school year will begin here.
 
ROSENTAL:  A lot of students are depressed. Teachers are not in a very good situation. And they are waiting to come to school to see each other, 
 
 because they want to feel back our community in Har VaGai.
 
SCIUTTO:  The school is outside the evacuation zone in the north, but it's still within range of rockets and missiles and drones from Lebanon. So, it 
 
 has air raid shelters like this one. In fact, 18 of them surrounding the school. Like all these shelters, reinforced walls, reinforced doors like 
 
 this, and close enough to the classrooms so the students can get here very quickly in the event of incoming fire.
 
SCIUTTO (voice-over):  But the shelters cannot shield the students and teachers from the stress of war.
 
ROSENTAL:  We are afraid. I cannot say that I'm not afraid, but I know that me and my team will do the best to make good for the kids.
 
ZIV ZINGER, SENIOR HAR VAGAI HIGH SCHOOL:  A few days ago, I woke up at 8:00 a.m. from the rockets, and they were very close.
 
SCIUTTO (voice-over):  17-year-old Ziv Zinger is going into his final year of high school.
 
ZINGER:  You feel kind of cheated. You know, you feel very connected to the old school. You know, we had grass, and we had the river flowing through 
 
 the school, and it doesn't feel like home.
 
SCIUTTO (voice-over):  The goal, then, is some measure of stability. The same classmates, same teachers, same subjects, even without the same sense 
 
 of safety. Merav Atmor is sending her 12-year-old son.
 
MERAV ATMOR, MOTHER OF HAR VAGAI STUDENT:  This routine, it's something that keep them safe in their mentality. But you go to school every day, you 
 
 see your friends, you see your teachers. I think it's very important.
 
SCIUTTO (voice-over):  One promising sign of that routine, Maton (ph), just beginning seventh grade, tells us he's more nervous about his classes than 
 
 the rockets.
 
For Ravit, the school is her contribution to a way forward.
 
ROSENTAL:  Very angry about a lot of things that's going on in Israel. But I have a mission now, to take care of more than 1,000 students and 130 
 
 teachers. So, I must do the best now.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 <br>[18:15:00]
 
SCIUTTO (on camera):  You know, the construction of a school like this with the help of government funding tells you something, and that is that it's 
 
 not clear when these families, when these students, when these schools are going to be able to move back up to their homes up north, when it will be 
 
 safe enough for the evacuees to return. It's not something that's talked about as happening in the very near future.
 
And we're going to be a year, right? We're going to be a year into this October 7th anniversary. The October 7th anniversary approaches. And, 
 
 Lynda, the events this weekend where you had the largest exchange of fire at the northern border this year shows that threat continues.
 
It's really a low-grade war in the north. The fear being that it grows into something bigger, but the threat significant enough that it's just not safe 
 
 to move back up there now.
 
KINKADE:  Yes. It's incredible to think it's been almost a year since that Hamas terror attack. Thanks so much for your reporting. Jim Sciutto in Tel 
 
 Aviv. Thanks.
 
SCIUTTO:  Thanks.
 
KINKADE:  Well, still ahead, striking a work life balance. Australia is joining a growing list of countries giving workers the freedom to unplug 
 
 after hours. They call it disconnecting down under.
 
Plus, the debate over the debate. Why an argument over hot mics is a hot topic on the U.S. campaign trail. All that and much more, still ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
KINKADE:  Welcome back. A market milestone on Wall Street topping today's Money Move. U.S. stocks closing mostly lower in Monday's session. For the 
 
 Dow powered ahead to close at a fresh record heights of first all-time high in more than a month. Investors, however, facing two big tests later in the 
 
 week. Earnings from A.I. chip giant NVIDIA on Wednesday and a fresh look at the Fed's preferred measure on of inflation on Friday. And a mixed session 
 
 in Asia to begin the week with stocks in Hong Kong and Australia in the green.
 
Well, staying with Australia, and Monday was the first day of a new law that protects the right of people to be out of off out of office and 
 
 disconnected. That's right. Most workers now have legal protections. That should mean they're not bothered with work e-mails and unnecessary calls 
 
 after hours. Our Kristie Lu Stout has more on the law and the reaction.
 <br>[18:20:00]
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  For all of Australia's beauty and relaxed reputation, it might be hard to imagine that many people 
 
 here feel overworked. But according to some lawmakers, Australians are working an average of six weeks unpaid overtime every year, and so the 
 
 government has stepped in to protect people's right to disconnect. As of Monday, people won't have to answer out of hours calls, texts or e-mails.
 
RACHEL ABDELNOUR, ADVERTISING INDUSTRY WORKER:  I think it's actually really important that we have laws like this. We spend so much of our time 
 
 connected to our phones, connected to our e-mails all day. And I think that it's really hard to switch off as it is.
 
LU STOUT (voice-over):  Around the world, ill-defined job expectations and constant connectivity has allowed our jobs to encroach on our private 
 
 worlds. The gray areas remain. There may be times the boss still requires an answer, but workers can now defend their right to disconnect in court if 
 
 they want to.
 
DAVID BRENNAN, FINANCE WORKER:  We are professionals. We're well paid. We're expected to deliver. And we feel we have to deliver 24 hours a day if 
 
 you have to. So, the phone's always on, the computer's always on, and we're working.
 
LU STOUT (voice-over):  Australians likely won't forget work entirely after they leave the office. But more people may feel like they don't have to be 
 
 always on, meaning more time to enjoy what is already a fortunate place to be.
 
Kristie Lu Stout, CNN.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
KINKADE:  We're turning now to Alaska, where a landslide has claimed the life of one person and left three others injured. It happened in far 
 
 southeastern Alaska, near the border with British Columbia in Canada. Officials now telling residents to leave amid fears another one could 
 
 strike. Well, the landslide tore through multiple homes and businesses, and it followed heavy days -- of days of heavy rain.
 
Well, meanwhile, more than 80 million people were at risk for severe thunderstorms across the U.S. on Monday, with the Northern Plains and the 
 
 Northeast facing the biggest threats.
 
Well, for more on this, I'm joined by meteorologist Chad Myers. Chad, certainly a few things on your radar right now.
 
CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  And some hail on the radar too earlier today up in New England, an area here that is not very familiar with severe 
 
 weather. But now, their focus really has shifted toward the Midwest where we will see severe weather again tonight. Wind larger hail and also, 
 
 potential, maybe even for a tornado or two.
 
There goes most of the weather, though, across parts of New England. Out into the ocean, the orange area here is what we're concerned about for 
 
 tonight. These storms may even continue through the overnight hours. And, Lynda, after hours and after dark when people are sleeping, that's when the 
 
 storms are the most dangerous.
 
It's been very hot. That heat is firing the fuel to these storms. Even Chicago, tomorrow will still be 96, although, it cools down for the rest of 
 
 the week, it doesn't cool down in Cincinnati or Indianapolis, all the way down even toward the Southern Ohio Valley, it will remain hot there.
 
Something else that's hot is the water here south of Japan. This a typhoon. 110 miles per hour. So, over 170 kilometers per hour there. And as we move 
 
 this up toward Kyushu -- now, remember, last week we talked about this thing going straight north. It had no intention of doing that. It went 
 
 straight west. And now, it's turning back to the north where it was supposed to go in the first place.
 
Unfortunately, now, Kyushu, you are in the way where the areas to the north of there are in less danger because the storm will have lost some power. 
 
 But there will be wind gusts at 100 miles per hour, 160 kilometers per hour without a doubt on land. Kagoshima likely even could see 10 inches of 
 
 rainfall. So, somewhere in the ballpark of 250 millimeters of rain with that wind and with that storm surge.
 
This will be a fairly dangerous storm for Kyushu, right here, this big island right down here. Now, that's not up toward Honshu, not up toward 
 
 Tokyo, but there'll be wind in Tokyo probably later in the day on Thursday and Friday.
 
So, what we're doing right now is we're watching the storms in the upper Midwest. We'll watch for tornadoes as well. We'll certainly have some 
 
 pictures of some of that big hail that happened in New England earlier today, Lynda.
 
KINKADE:  Well, keep an eye out for that. It's interesting the way the trajectory of that typhoon really did change quite a bit. Incredible.
 
MYERS:  It really did. I watched it all weekend long going, where are you going?
 
KINKADE:  Chad Myers, good to see you. Thank you. Keep watching it for us. Well, I want to turn now to a flooding disaster still unfolding in 
 
 Bangladesh and Northeastern India. There is a desperate search underway for survivors after those torrential rains claim the lives of at least 44 
 
 people in the city of Feni in southeast Bangladesh, is one of the hardest hit areas. Our Anna Coren is there with the latest.
 <br>[18:25:00]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANNA COREN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Wading through the muddy waters, a handful of belongings clutched above their heads, the 
 
 residents of Feni make their way to higher ground. A district of one and a half million people underwater in the epicenter of one of Bangladesh's 
 
 worst floods in living memory.
 
RAJIB BAURA, VOLUNTEER:  This a very, very bad situation. In Bangladesh, people need help. We need help.
 
COREN (voice-over):  The military has been mobilized, along with an army of volunteers. But it's slow-going.
 
COREN:  The people who can walk out, no matter how deep the water, no matter their age. They are doing so, but there are countless numbers who 
 
 are trapped in surrounding areas. And emergency services are completely overwhelmed, which is why volunteers are stepping in.
 
COREN (voice-over):  As far as these people are concerned, this no natural disaster.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We hate you, India.
 
COREN (voice-over):  They believe India is squarely to blame for this catastrophe. India denies that but confirmed that one of its dams across 
 
 the border automatically released water, due to excessive levels.
 
But what really angers the Bangladeshis that India failed to issue any warning about the surge, citing a power outage and communication breakdown.
 
A diplomatic row has erupted between the two countries, a senior Bangladeshi adviser even accusing India of being inhumane.
 
Food and clean water are now in short supply. But for some, they have more pressing problems.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm feeling very heartbroken because I couldn't rescue my family. Actually, I don't know where they are right now.
 
COREN (voice-over):  This woman boards our boat in desperate search of her sister and one-month-old baby, who is sick. With all communication down, 
 
 she can't reach her.
 
I'm so worried the baby won't make it, she tells me.
 
As dusk falls, we pass houses packed with people calling out for assistance.
 
When we finally arrive at the school where her sister is thought to be sheltering, hundreds of faces appear. But she's not there.
 
We join another rescue, headed by a man who flew in from Qatar to save his stranded family.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I have no boat, no support, no rescue team.
 
COREN (voice-over):  They find them, exhausted but relieved.
 
COREN:  It's just gone 9:00 p.m., and while this has been a successful rescue, these boats will continue to operate up and down these floodwaters 
 
 throughout the night to bring other families to safety.
 
Anna Coren, CNN, Feni, Bangladesh.

KINKADE:  Our thanks to Anna for that report. We're going to take a quick break. More "First Move" in just a moment.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:30:00]
 
KINKADE:  Welcome back to "First Move." I'm Lynda Kinkade with a look at more international headlines this hour. And we start in Iceland where an 
 
 ice cave collapse has killed one U.S. tourist and injured another. The survivor was taken to hospital in Reykjavik. Her condition isn't yet known. 
 
 And more than 200 first responders had participated in that rescue effort. Iceland has been hard hit by climate change, causing its glaciers to melt.
 
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz paid his respects on Monday to the three people killed in a stabbing attack. Scholz said the incident was, quote, 
 
 terrorism against all. In response, he proposed to step up deportations and make weapon laws tighter. Police say a Syrian national confessed to that 
 
 stabbing on Sunday. Prosecutors accuse him of belonging to ISIS.
 
Well, several allies of Donald Trump will go on trial in almost a year and a half. That is the ruling from an Arizona judge on Monday. It's far later 
 
 than what prosecutors had asked for. The defendants include former Trump aides such as Rudy Giuliani and Mark Meadows. They're accused of engaging 
 
 in a conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election.
 
Well, Trump is campaigning today in the key battleground State of Michigan, where he addressed the National Guard Association Conference.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  It's an honor to be with all of you incredible patriots. Really an honor. A 
 
 great one. And I'm thrilled to be here in Detroit with the incredible men and women of our National Guard. Very special people.
 
I've had no greater honor in life than to serve as your commander-in-chief. And you are always ready and always there for us and for the president of 
 
 the United States. You are always there for me, I will tell you, and I'm always going to be there for you.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KINKADE:  Earlier in Virginia, Trump took part in a wreath laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery. It marked the third anniversary of the 
 
 attack at Kabul Airport that killed 13 U.S. service members during the withdrawal from Afghanistan. He also visited a Vietnamese shopping center 
 
 with Republican Senate nominee Hung Cao.
 
Well, meantime, Trump and his campaign have been casting doubt on whether a scheduled debate with Vice President Kamala Harris will take place amid a 
 
 dispute over the rules. Kristen Holmes is our U.S. national correspondent. She joins us now from Detroit. Good to see you.
 
So, to debate or not to debate? That is the question. There certainly is a great deal of sparring over the mighty details. Just explain what's 
 
 happening.
 
KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes. So, what we're hearing now from both sides is that they're essentially at an impasse over 
 
 whether or not the mics will be muted while the other candidate is talking.
 
So, just to go back in time a little bit, with that first debate with President Joe Biden when he was at the top of the ticket and Donald Trump, 
 
 the rules that they had both agreed to were that the mics would be muted at that interim period. Now, with Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket, 
 
 Harris' campaign is saying that they would like new rules that they don't think that the mics should be muted.
 
On the other side, Trump's team, who interestingly actually didn't originally like the muting of the mics, now is saying they agreed to 
 
 actually having those mics be muted. That they would want the original plan, those rules that they had during that CNN debate.
 <br>[18:35:00]
 
I do want to stress here, Lynda, a lot of this just posturing and trying to figure out what is best for their candidate. What's going to make their 
 
 candidate look better and how to make the other candidate look bad.
 
I mean, I just want to remind you, it was just a few weeks ago when Harris moved to the top of the ticket, that Trump's team pulled out of the debate 
 
 and it was Harris who was saying, well, you're not -- you agreed to this debate, even if it's Joe Biden or if it's us, you already agreed to it. 
 
 Now, it's the opposite. Harris saying, well, I'm at the top of the ticket now, so we want different rules. The rules are no muting of the mic. You 
 
 have Donald Trump, same thing. They were saying, we're pulling out because it's not the same ticket. Now, they're saying, we want the same rules that 
 
 we had originally agreed to.
 
Again, a lot of this just posturing as they try to figure out what's best for their candidate. Of course, the question is, ultimately, on September 
 
 10th, do they both end up on the debate stage, and that'll be a question, something we'll watch closely in the coming days.
 
KINKADE:  Yes, exactly. Of course, we know in the coming days that Trump is going to take some questions from voters. How unusual is that?
 
HOLMES:  Well, it's unusual in the sense that usually these kind of town halls are done through a media organization. For example, we believe on 
 
 September 4th, he's doing a town hall with Fox in Pennsylvania. That's how you usually see it done. However, the campaign is doing one just for the 
 
 campaign, and this going to be in Wisconsin.
 
So, just so you know what his week looks like, he's in Michigan today, as well as in Arlington. Then he's going back to Michigan on Thursday to 
 
 Wisconsin for this town hall, then Pennsylvania. All of these, of course, are swing states. Now, this town hall, the structure is going to be that he 
 
 gets up there and speaks for 15 to 20 minutes, and then he takes questions from voters in the audience. You know, we don't know what kind of voters, 
 
 are they all Trump supporters, probably. But it will be him interacting with voters, or at least that's what we're told by the campaign.
 
We certainly never seen him do one of these. Again, that wasn't structured through a Fox News or through CNN or one of these media organizations. So, 
 
 it'll be unclear how it'll work. But I think what is clear is that they are looking for different ways to go after Kamala Harris. They have tried to 
 
 find their footing with her in this new race, with her at the top of the ticket. And she has really been on a bounce. She -- we saw the bounce that 
 
 she had from becoming the top of the ticket. The enthusiasm around her, the boost in polling. Whether or not that lasts is anyone's guess.
 
The Trump campaign had hoped that it would be over by now. But regardless, Donald Trump himself has had a hard time hitting Harris, finding attack 
 
 lines that land and really trying to break through this bounce that Harris appears to still be on. So, we'll see if this town hall is one way to do 
 
 that and if it's something they're planning to do long-term or have several of these moving forward.
 
KINKADE:  Yes, it certainly seems pretty clear that momentum that Harris has got right now is quite frustrating to Trump and Vance. Kristen Holmes, 
 
 good to see you in Detroit, Michigan. Thanks so much.
 
Well, the classified documents case against Donald Trump is back in the headlines. The U.S. Justice Department is seeking to revive that criminal 
 
 case, which Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed last month, ruling that the Justice Department didn't have the ability to appoint or fund special 
 
 counsels like Jack Smith.
 
Now, Smith filed a brief with the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta Monday saying Cannon's decision was, quote, novel and lacked merit. 
 
 Our Justice Correspondent Jessica Schneider joins us now from Washington. So, Jessica, good to see you. This the first formal filing since that 
 
 criminal case was dismissed last month. What can you tell us about this appeal?
 
JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, this the first move by the special counsel since Aileen Cannon totally dismissed all of these 
 
 charges against Donald Trump and his co-defendants in mid-July. Jack Smith is basically saying that what she did was completely unprecedented here, it 
 
 was novel, it lacked merit. What she did on July 15th, she basically said, there is nothing that allows the attorney general to appoint a special 
 
 counsel like Jack Smith. And in addition, she said that his office was unlawfully funded under the constitution.
 
What Jack Smith is now arguing to the appeals court above her is that she got it completely wrong, saying that basically her decision flies in the 
 
 face of decades of precedent. In particular, a Supreme Court case from U.S. v. Nixon and -- from 1974 that -- where the Supreme Court specifically said 
 
 attorneys general have the ability to appoint these special counsels.
 
What Aileen Cannon did, she sort of dismissed that ruling from the Supreme Court, something that was extremely rare that other courts have not done. 
 
 So, now, Jack Smith is asking the 11th Circuit to step in to say what Aileen Cannon did was wrong and then, actually revive this case.
 
So, the way the special counsel is arguing it, they're saying that only is this unprecedented and not only does it fly in the face of other court 
 
 rulings, but they're pointing out this could really cause a ripple effect if this ruling is upheld.
 <br>[18:40:00]
 
Specifically saying this, if the Attorney General lacks the power to appoint inferior officers, that conclusion would invalidate the appointment 
 
 of every member of the Department who exercises significant authority and occupies a continuing office, other than the few that are specifically 
 
 identified by statute.
 
And then the special counsel goes on to point out that, again, if this ruling stood, it could also maybe invalidate the way that the State 
 
 Department is run or the Treasury. So, the question now is what happens next? We expect that the Trump's legal team will file a responding brief. 
 
 Obviously, they'll side with Judge Cannon, saying that she was right to completely dismiss these classified documents case against the president 
 
 and his co-defendants. But then the 11th Circuit is being asked to set a time for oral argument where the special counsel's team and Trump's team 
 
 could come before this panel of judges and make their case.
 
What's interesting here, Lynda, is that we are right up against the November election. So, it is very unlikely that the 11th Circuit will make 
 
 any sort of decision before the election. Who knows if they'll even hear the case before then. And then, of course, if Donald Trump were to be 
 
 elected, he could just get rid of this case as president. He could direct his Justice Department to wipe it out completely.
 
So, it's going to be interesting to see what happens in the next few weeks as we lead up to the election, if there'll be any action in this case as 
 
 the special counsel tries to revive it. Lynda.
 
KINKADE:  Yes. Timing is of the essence. It's interesting. Jessica Schneider, good to have you with us from Washington. Thank you.
 
SCHNEIDER:  Thanks.
 
KINKADE:  Well, still to come, the sports world is now mourning the loss of one of the most beloved figures in English football. The superstar manager, 
 
 Sven-Goran Eriksson. Stay with us for more on that.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
KINKADE:  Welcome back. Tributes are pouring in from across the sports world for Sven-Goran Eriksson, who died Monday at the age of 76. Many 
 
 consider Eriksson one of the greatest football managers of all time. He revealed earlier this year that he had terminal cancer.
 
Well, Don Riddell is with us now. Good to see you, Don. So, he was born in Sweden, but became the first foreign manager for England. And today, we saw 
 
 some beautiful tributes from well-known Brits, including Prince William and David Beckham.
 <br>[18:45:00]
 
DON RIDDELL, CNN WORLD SPORT:  Yes, David Beckham was the man that Eriksson made captain of the Three Lions team, and Beckham spoke quite movingly -- 
 
 or he wrote on social media quite movingly about their last time together and how they knew that it was goodbye.
 
As you say, Lynda, reaction pouring in just from everywhere for Sven-Goran Eriksson. His family say that he passed away peacefully at the age of 76. 
 
 Eriksson had revealed in January that he'd been diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer and given about a year to live.
 
He was most famous for becoming England's first foreign manager. That was such a huge deal at the time. And he led the Three Lions to the 
 
 quarterfinals of the 2002 and 2006 World Cup tournaments as a club manager with the likes of Gothenburg, Benfica, and Lazio. He won some 18 trophies.
 
Since going public with his illness, Eriksson was really warmly received at many of his former clubs. He bravely lived with his cancer, and he told CNN 
 
 earlier this year that he was grateful for all the love he was feeling.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SVEN-GORAN ERIKSSON, FORMER ENGLAND MANAGER:  That was fantastic. Very, very nice and beautiful, of course. And I'm a little bit lucky. They 
 
 telling me how good I was when I was still alive. Normally, it's after the funeral that you hear that.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
RIDDELL:  You know, in a recently broadcast documentary about his life, Eriksson spoke about what would be the end. He said, quote, I hope you will 
 
 remember me as a positive guy trying to do everything he could do. Don't be sorry. Smile. Take care of yourself and your life, and live it. Really, 
 
 really poignant words there from Sven-Goran Eriksso there, Lynda.
 
KINKADE:  Really a beloved character, Don. And after nearly 50 years of football management, he was able to fulfill a lifelong dream of sorts 
 
 earlier this year, right, Don?
 
RIDDELL:  Yes. So, this really speaks to just how popular he was and how the entire European, if not global, football community reached out to him 
 
 when he revealed his diagnosis earlier this year. And one of the offers he got was to come to Anfield, the home of the Liverpool Football Club, to 
 
 manage their legends team for the day.
 
He had said that he was a lifelong Liverpool fan. I think of all the jobs he had, this the one he would have wanted the most. And it really was just 
 
 such a fabulous day. Such a feel-good day. So, much emotion, so much support from the Liverpool fans. And many of the Liverpool legendary 
 
 players who were involved in that game. And that just really speaks to how Eriksson was regarded and revered within the football community.
 
KINKADE:  What an incredible career and life. Legendary soccer manager, Sven-Goran Eriksso, passing away. Don Riddell, thanks so much for bringing 
 
 us those tributes. Appreciate it.
 
Well, still to come on "First Move," a spacewalk for the record books. Four SpaceX astronauts are set for one of the boldest and riskiest private space 
 
 missions yet. We'll hear from a former NASA astronaut on what to expect when Polaris Dawn blasts off.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:50:00]
 
KINKADE:  Welcome back. I'm Lynda Kinkade. The historic SpaceX Polaris Dawn mission is set to launch Tuesday morning. It is funded by billionaire Jared 
 
 Isaacman. He's also a member of the private four-person crew. If all goes well, he and a crewmate will conduct the first ever commercial spacewalk 
 
 during the five-day mission. The vehicle that will reach an orbit that extends up to 870 miles, that's about 1,400 kilometers from Earth. And that 
 
 is the furthest any astronaut has been since the Apollo program.
 
Well, former NASA astronaut Garrett Reisman is here. He's also the former director of space operations at SpaceX. Good to see you.
 
GARRETT REISMAN, FORMER NASA ASTRONAUT:  Hi, Lynda. Great to be with you.
 
KINKADE:  So, about eight hours plus from now, these four private citizens are going to launch into space as part of this SpaceX Polaris mission and 
 
 they are trying to break new records. Just explain how both exciting and potentially daunting this could be.
 
REISMAN:  Yes, you know, Lynda, this pretty risky. It definitely involves more risk than a typical NASA mission, like the ones that I was a part of. 
 
 They're going really high, as you pointed out, about 1,400 kilometers, higher than anybody has been except for the Apollo astronauts that flew to 
 
 the moon. But that also puts them up into some pretty severe radiation environments in the Van Allen belts.
 
Then they're going to drop down and do the first spacewalk ever done by a commercial entity. And you know -- and they're also doing about 40 
 
 different science experiments. So, this mission is really loaded with a bunch of really bold things. And yes, it's -- I'm a little concerned.
 
KINKADE:  Me too. I mean, you're a consultant for SpaceX. These crew members are also going to be wearing spacesuits that have never been tested 
 
 in space, as I understand it. I mean, how big a risk is that?
 
REISMAN:  It is pretty risky. The -- I'm not so worried about the suits. They've been very thoroughly tested on the ground. We put them in vacuum 
 
 chambers that simulate the lack of pressure, the lack of air and they perform quite well. But we've never tried to go through the whole thing end 
 
 to end in space, in zero gravity. And there, it's about a two-hour timeline. And there, there's going to be some time pressure, you know, the 
 
 clock is running.
 
As soon as they let the air out of the cabin, then they only have so much air inside their oxygen tanks. And so, they have to get this done in an 
 
 expeditious manner. And if things start going wrong, they will have -- they could have some pretty challenging operational environments.
 
Now, I'm very confident in the SpaceX team. The ops team at SpaceX is really top notch. And I think that they'll carry themselves with great 
 
 aplomb through this whole thing. But yes, it's a bit of a nail biter. And two of the crew members are actually friends of mine. So, that's why I'm 
 
 kind of particularly on edge.
 
KINKADE:  You're a little bit nervous for them. And of course, Garrett, you have, yourself, done a spacewalk. Just explain what that was like. What 
 
 will the experience be like for these four crew members?
 
REISMAN:  No, it's amazing. There's got to be -- I don't think there's anything cooler that an astronaut gets to do than the spacewalk. When you 
 
 go out there -- and there's nothing between you and the entire planet and the cosmos except for this thin piece of glass, that's your helmet. What 
 
 you almost forget is there. It's an incredible experience. And I'm really happy for Jared and Sarah that they're going to get a chance to go outside 
 
 and have a look.
 
Now, all four of the astronauts are going to vacuum, you know, even the people -- the two crew members staying inside. So, I think it's really kind 
 
 of unfair that they don't get credit for doing a spacewalk because the only difference is they keep their seatbelt on. Otherwise, it's really the same. 
 
 I think they all should get credit.
 
KINKADE:  Oh, wow. That's an interesting point you make. There is another space story I have to ask you about, Garrett. The Boeing's first Starliner 
 
 crew test flight. Of course, we now know that the astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, won't be coming back to Earth anytime soon. But their 
 
 craft is going to return unmanned. Just explain why.
 
REISMAN:  Well, I think NASA made the right decision here. What really bothered them was the fact that they knew what was happening with the 
 
 thrusters, but they didn't know exactly why. And they thought they had an explanation for why it was all happening. But there was some uncertainty 
 
 about whether or not it was really the correct explanation.
 
So, not knowing exactly for sure what's going to happen. Look, I would put good money on Starliner undocking, coming home with nobody inside and 
 
 everything going just swimmingly. I think it'll be fine. I'm willing to bet my -- a lot of my money on it, but I wouldn't bet my life on it unless I 
 
 had to.
 <br>[18:55:00]
 
And the thing is, NASA doesn't have to. They could just wait a while. It's going to be tough for Suni and Butch and their families. Butch has two 
 
 teenage daughters. So, it's -- that's going to be difficult. But look, it's the safe thing to do. And I think NASA made the right call.
 
KINKADE:  Yes, always safety first, right? And they are -- they have trained for it. They are prepared for it. Always -- great to have you on, 
 
 Garrett Reisman. Good to have you on the program. Thanks so much.
 
REISMAN:  My pleasure. Anytime.
 
KINKADE:  Well, finally, on "First Move", Oasis says maybe to a possible reunion. The band, its lead singer, and its guitarist all posted the same 
 
 cryptic video on their social media accounts, teasing what appears to be an announcement set for early Tuesday morning.
 
The two brothers, Noel and Liam Gallagher, have feuded over the years, prompting Noel to leave the band, but now, they appear to have buried the 
 
 hatchet. Definitely. Maybe. I mean, that's one of their songs. We shall find out tomorrow.
 
That wraps up the show for today. I'm Lynda Kinkade. Thanks so much for joining us. I'll see you then.
