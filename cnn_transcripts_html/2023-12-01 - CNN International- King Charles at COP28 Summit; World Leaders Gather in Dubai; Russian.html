BIANCA NOBILO, CNN INT ANCHOR:  Britain's King Charles sends a powerful message at the U.N. Climate Conference in Dubai. Still ahead, his word about timelines as political leaders get ready to debate the next steps to fight climate change.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
NOBILO:  Welcome back to "CNN Newsroom." I'm Bianca Nobilo.
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN INT ANCHOR:  I'm Max Foster. If you're just joining us, let me bring you up to date with our top stories this hour. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says military operations in Gaza have resumed after Hamas broke the outline of the seven-day truce now, and negotiations over the hostages are continuing despite that renewed fighting.
 
And in just a few hours, the U.S. House of Representatives will decide if Congressman George Santos is not fit to serve. The Republican lawmaker from New York faces a vote for expulsion, but a two-thirds majority of the House is needed for that to happen.
 
FOSTER:  Tough negotiations are expected to get underway at the U.N. Climate Conference in Dubai. World leaders began their first full day of work less than two hours ago, hoping to decide on the next steps to tackle climate change. That's happening on the heels of a recent E.U. report that 2023 is on track to be the hottest year on record.
 <br>[04:35:00]
 
A long list of political leaders are expected to be at the conference, including U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of State Antony Blinken.
 
Earlier this morning, Britain's Prince Charles -- King Charles actually, of course, King Charles reminded everyone that the time for solutions is running out.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KING CHARLES III, UNITED KINGDOM:  The dangers are no longer distant risks. I have seen across the Commonwealth and beyond countless communities which are unable to withstand repeated shocks, whose lives and livelihoods are laid waste by climate change. Surely, real action is required to stem the growing toll of its most vulnerable victims.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER:  David McKenzie, monitoring all developments at COP28 for us. He joins us now live from Dubai.
 
And the king there speaking to one of the largest gatherings of world leaders in many months, if not this year. So, it's an opportunity to make some impact here.
 
DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, that's right, Max. And obviously the king has been a champion on environmental issues for many, many years. This is not new to him, but it is new to have an impassioned plea to such a large audience of world leaders.
 
As you say, this is a critically important COP. The climate meetings that set the agenda for how we are going to combat the climate crisis. The U.N. secretary-general spoke very directly about the need to reduce emissions to try and stop the ravages of climate change.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANTONIO GUTERRES, SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE UNITED NATIONS:  We cannot save a burning planet via fire holes of fossil fuels. We must accelerate just equitable transition to renewables. The science is clear. The 1.53 limit is only possible if we ultimately stop burning all fossil fuels, not reduce, not abate.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MCKENZIE:  Well, Max and Bianca, we looked at some of the key issues facing these climate meetings and what needs to be done to get the world on track to meet those targets.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MCKENZIE (voiceover):  If there was ever any doubt, the future is now. A year of disasters spanning the globe, made so much worse by the climate crisis.
 
GUTERRES:  The air is unbreathable, the heat is unbearable, and the level of fossil fuel profits and climate inaction is unacceptable. Leaders must lead.
 
MCKENZIE (voiceover):  These critical climate meetings, led by a major fossil fuel producer, were controversial before they even began.
 
Leaks released this week by the Center for Climate Reporting showing what appeared to be briefing papers for COP President Sultan Al Jaber, who is head of the state oil company, allegedly pitching fossil fuel deals for the UAE on the side.
 
The COP president calls the allegations false and incorrect.
 
SULTAN AL JABER, COP28 PRESIDENT:  Sometimes I am told you need to engage with governments and with oil and gas companies to put pressure. And sometimes I'm told you can't do that. So, we're damned if we do, we're damned if we don't.
 
MCKENZIE:  The UAE is saying that they are here because all countries, including oil producers, need to come up with solutions to the climate crisis.
 
ANN HARRISON, CLIMATE ADVISOR, AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL:  Yes. They need to be part of the negotiations, but what you can't have is somebody who is putting fossil fuel companies interests ahead of the negotiations and the outcome that we need.
 
MCKENZIE (voiceover):  The outcome that the U.N. and many others hope for, a concrete plan for a fossil fuel phase out. A recent U.N. report shows that the globe is wildly off track to meet emissions targets.
 
ANI DASGUPTA, CEO, WORLD RESOURCE INSTITUTE:  It's critical for countries to come together and agree to a systematic reduction, and a time bound reduction. I mean, this is a true moment for leadership. It's not about technology or technical things. It's commitment, leadership, that this is something we need to do. We need to come together. Rich countries have to help poor countries.
 
MCKENZIE (voiceover):  The harsh reality, countries that have the least responsibility for climate change will feel the most catastrophic impact.
 
KAISA KOSONEN, HEAD OF DELEGATION, GREENPEACE:  At this COP they need to have guarantees that there will be a fund with sufficient money in it to deal with the loss and damages. So, the impacts, they can no longer avoid and they just have to cope with.
 
MCKENZIE:  If that doesn't happen, what's the consequence of that?
 
KOSONEN:  The consequence is lost lives, you know, livelihood, futures.
 <br>[04:40:00]
 
MCKENZIE (voiceover):  And the consequence for all of us, if bold steps are not taken now, are too terrible to contemplate.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MCKENZIE (on camera):  Max and Bianca, there is some good news in the start of this conference that a loss and damage fund has been set up on the very first day and hundreds of million dollars -- of dollars have been pledged to that fund. So, that is something that's been worked on for many years and appears to be now a concrete solution. But it's just a drop in the ocean. The clear mandate, say, activists and nations that are dealing with climate change in such terrible ways is that there is a concrete timeline on when countries, including UAE and other oil rich nations, ease off their production and our use of fossil fuels. Max, Bianca.
 
FOSTER:  David McKenzie in Dubai. Thank you so much. Back with you regularly on this story.
 
Now, Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest exporter of crude oil, will extend a voluntary production cut of a million barrels of oil per day. That's according to the state-run Saudi press agency.
 
FOSTER:  The move comes after Kingdom officials met with other major oil producing nations in Vienna on Thursday to discuss further cuts to oil supply. CNN's Anna Stewart reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER:  While expectations were high heading into this meeting for OPEC Plus to announce deeper oil output cuts for next year, but the market was disappointed. Oil prices fell as the meeting closed with no official agreement on cuts. Instead, some members individually announced voluntary cuts.
 
Largest producer and de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, agreed to extend its voluntary cost of 1 million barrels a day until the end of the first quarter of next year, saying it was doing so with the coordination with the Some OPEC Plus participating countries.
 
All prices have slumped in recent months, a barrel of Brent costs more than $90 a barrel in September. But in the last month, it's been hovering around the $80 handle, largely on a weak global economic outlook heading into 2024.
 
Now, this OPEC Plus meeting took place on day one of COP28, where dignitaries are discussing ways to decrease reliance on fossil fuels. The OPEC secretary general was keen to defend OPEC's place in a world that's transitioning away from oil, saying in a statement, one such myth is that the oil and renewables industries are competitors locked in a zero-sum game that the success of one represents a mortal threat to the other. Instead, he said, petroleum products are integral to creating renewable energy products, and OPEC members also invest in cleaner energy. Some more than others. And that is an issue that will no doubt be discussed at length at COP28.

FOSTER:  In a landmark ruling, critics worry will put people in danger. Russia's highest court declares a ban on what it calls the extremist international LGBTQ community. Details of that coming up next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[04:45:00]
 
FOSTER:  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says his country will be strengthening its defenses by building up fortifications along the frontlines.
 
NOBILO:  During a trip to the Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia regions on Thursday, Mr. Zelenskyy met with local authorities to talk about defense efforts there and across the nation.
 
The visit came as rescue crews are working to free people trapped beneath the rubble in the Donetsk region following deadly missile strikes that killed at least two people. And this is what is left of an apartment building after missiles hit late Wednesday night.
 
FOSTER:  This video shows a six-month-old who was rescued and given urgent medical care after the Russian army simultaneously hit three towns late on Wednesday night.
 
In a move many fear will lead to the arrests and persecutions -- prosecutions, rather, of gay and transgender people, Russia's Supreme Court has declared a ban on what it calls the country's international LGBTQ movement, calling it an extremist organization.
 
NOBILO:  Under Russian law, people considered the leaders of such groups could face up to 10 years in prison. The United Nations says it deplores the ruling.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
RAVINA SHAMDASANI, SPOKESWOMAN, U.N. HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS:  We call on the Russian authorities to immediately repeal this law and other laws that infringe upon the rights of LGBT people or the rights of people who are advocating for human rights across the board.
 
We are worried that this law could effectively criminalize any advocacy relating to the rights of people of a different sexual orientation. And peaceful advocacy must never be criminalized.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER:  Homosexuality was decriminalized in Russia in 1993, but homophobia and discrimination are still rife across the country.
 
NOBILO:  Thursday's ruling is expected to further erode the rights of Russia's LGBTQ community, which has faced an intensified crackdown in recent years under President Vladimir Putin.
 
FOSTER:  Israel's military campaign in Gaza resuming following seven days of truce. The latest is just ahead after this short break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[04:50:00]
 
NOBILO:  Welcome back. If you're just joining us, Israel has resumed combat operations against Hamas in Gaza after a week-long pause in the fighting ended early on Friday.
 
FOSTER:  Israel says it's dropping leaflets in Southern Gaza, the City of Khan Younis specifically calling it a fighting zone and telling people to evacuate immediately.
 
NOBILO:  The Hamas controlled Gaza Health Ministry says at least 32 people have been killed in the latest Israeli strikes.
 
FOSTER:  Hamas released eight hostages on Thursday on what turned out to be the final day of the pause. Meanwhile, sources tell CNN the hostage negotiations continue despite the resumption of fighting.
 
Hospitals across Israel have been playing a key part in the road to recovery for so many of the freed hostages.
 
NOBILO:  CNN's Wolf Blitzer takes us inside a medical center near Tel Aviv, where a number of released captives have been treated.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR (voiceover):  For these women released from Hamas captivity, this hospital is a key stop on their road to recovery.
 
DR. ADAM LEE GOLDSTEIN, DIRECTOR OF TRAUMA SURGERY, WOLFSON MEDICAL CENTER:  The hospital -- you know, since the war began, every hospital turns into a "war hospital" where we're prepared for anything at any moment.
 
BLITZER (voiceover):  The team at Wolfson Medical Center has been gathering health records and talking to family members to anticipate any potential concerns.
 
BLITZER:  Thank you so much for all you're doing.
 
BLITZER (voiceover):  Dr. Adam Lee Goldstein is the head of trauma surgery and saw patients to confirm they didn't have any traumatic injuries.
 
DR. GOLDSTEIN:  Most importantly is for us to make sure they're OK health wise and to reunite them with their families, which is, you know, just as important as anything else.
 
BLITZER (voiceover):  Still, there's a long road ahead for those who spent weeks in Hamas captivity.
 
DR. GOLDSTEIN:  We've had a multidisciplinary team dealing with all the aspects from psychosocial to nutrition, surgical, infectious.
 
BLITZER (voiceover):  Those long-awaited family reunions, an incredible relief for loved ones in limbo.
 
DR. GOLDSTEIN:  Families were waiting in the private rooms. And, you know, the second that these women saw their families, nothing else mattered really. When you're dealing with life and death, they're just happy they're alive. BLITZER (voiceover):  But Dr. Goldstein fears for the fate of other hostages still in captivity.
 
DR. GOLDSTEIN:  We're trained to think about worst-case scenarios and how to, how to treat worst-case scenarios. I just want them to get home.
 
BLITZER (voiceover):  Despite the trauma, these survivors show incredible resilience.
 
DR. GOLDSTEIN:  When you have one of these women and the first thing she says to you is, I'm so sorry for making you work tonight, you know, after everything she's been through, you know, you never -- it's things you never expect and, you know, it just shows what type of people these are.
