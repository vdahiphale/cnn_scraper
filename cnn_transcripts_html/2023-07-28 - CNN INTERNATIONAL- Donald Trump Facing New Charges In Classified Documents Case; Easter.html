MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome back to CNN "Newsroom", I'm Max Foster. If you're just joining us, let me bring you up to date with our top stories this hour Donald Trump facing new charges in the classified documents case. The Special Counsel alleges that the Former U.S. President and aide and an employee attempted to delete Mar-a-Lago security footage, which is sought by the grand jury investigating the mishandling of government records.
 
In an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu refused to say if he would abide by any potential Supreme Court ruling striking down his controversial judicial reform law. The court is expected to hear appeals against the law in September.
 
The Eastern U.S. is bracing for what is expected to be a weekend of record breaking heat. Right now nearly 190 million people are under heat alerts from coast to coast. Here's CNN's Meteorologist Chad Myers.
 
CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST: It was a very hot day from Boston in New York, Philadelphia, D.C. and all the way down to the south. But Copernicus Climate Change Service today called July 2023, the warmest July on record. And when I read it, I said to myself, is it August?
 
How did this happen? Did I miss a week? But no, they said that it has been so hot. And July 2023 is so far above all the other July's that there's nothing that can change that could make this any cooler than 2022, 21, 20 and the like, because obviously that's where the heat spent.
 
Now the heat has been in the desert southwest. We've been talking about that for weeks. And Phoenix and Vegas, you already know that. But over the week, the heat has shifted a little bit to the east. And so now the big cities Along I-95 have really warmed up Chicago, obviously to all the way through St. Louis brutally hot today with the heat index.
 
But that's not saying that the heat really left Phoenix now 28 days in a row above 110 where we were 114 in the afternoon. Most of the heat has shifted into the Midwest and to the northeast, and even from New York City all the way down through Philadelphia and the like we will have the 6 excessive heat warning for Friday.
 
That's all part of the heat index. That's going to be 105. Now the good news is for most of the East Coast cities this is only a brief warm up, a short heat wave, not a big long heat wave like they've had out there in the West, but still 200 record highs will be set across the United States just from now to the end of the weekend.
 <br>[04:35:00]
 
Chicago, you have, one hotter day and then the cooler gets there. There could be some showers and storms around to when you start to break these temperatures from the 90s all the way down into the 70s St. Louis. You could get some thunder and lightning as this transition with the cooler air comes down from the north.
 
But -- like 102 on the thermometer, it's going to be warmer than that obviously adding the humidity or those are in the shade. Obviously you get the sunshine it'll be warm. 96 in D.C. for the next couple of days you're a little bit slower to get the cold front. But look at New York 94 on Friday and Friday morning low on Sunday morning 65. That's the cool air. We'll take it.
 
FOSTER: And we will Chad. Now, in some areas of Europe slightly cooler weather is giving firefighters a much needed break, as they work to extinguish wildfires made worse by the scorching heat but the relief may be short lived, with temperatures again expected to rise across much of the region in the coming days.
 
In Croatia firefighters are working to contain another wildfire along the Adriatic coast, the second one this week. And in Greece, fires are still burning in the hard to reach mountain areas around roads. Greek officials say 10 percent of the land on the heavily touristic Island has been destroyed by the recent fires, Nada Bashir, following all of this, for us from Rome, Nada?
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER: Well, Max, he mentioned that temperatures are beginning to subside somewhat, and that has provided some much needed respite here. In Italy, there are still some fires burning in the south. But at this stage, they are all contained according to the authorities and they are no longer classifying this as a fire emergency.
 
But of course, we are expecting temperatures to subside to either average or even below average levels over the coming days. But there is concern around those strong winds and the potential to rekindle fires in forested areas across the south of Italy. And as you mentioned, we are still seeing fires burning in cross Greece.
 
We have new authorities yesterday saying that 124 fires had been reported. But again, some positive indications for the first time in nearly two weeks. No large fires being reported that there is of course some positive indications there. But again, the country is still on high alert. And this is something that we're seeing across the Mediterranean real concern around the potential for further high temperatures later on in the month in August to lead further wildfires. Now we heard that warning yesterday from the U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres giving a stark message on the situation that this region is facing. Take a listen to what he had to say.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANTONIO GUTERRES, UNITED NATIONS SECRETARY-GENERAL: Climate change is here. It is terrifying. And it is just the beginning. The era of global warming has ended the area the heater of global boiling, as arrives.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
Global boiling has arrived. It is a deeply concerning prospect. And of course, we've been hearing those warnings repeatedly. Now yesterday that report released by the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service highlighting some really concerning assessments. I'll just pull out a few of those key points yesterday.
 
July again said to be the hottest month on the planet recorded every day since July 3 has been hotter than record set back in 2016. And almost every month this year has been in the top five hottest on record. There's some deeply concerning statistics there.
 
We've heard from EU officials saying they are trying to make the necessary preparations for what is expected to be further extreme heat events in the coming years. Experts say this is not only going to become more frequent, but these extreme heat events, these wildfires that we're seeing across the Mediterranean could also become more severe, Max.
 
FOSTER: OK, Nada in Rome, thank you. Typhoon Doksuri has made landfall in China's Fujian Province, bringing torrential rain and winds at almost 110 miles per hour. Storm whipped up huge waves sending them crashing onto shore. The typhoon is expected to continue to move north becoming a tropical storm in the next few hours.
 
Earlier, the typhoon caused major flooding in Taiwan. In the Philippines, at least 39 people were killed including dozens on an overcrowded boat that capsized in strong winds. The Primetime Emmy Awards have been postponed for the first time in more than 20 years as Hollywood is shut down amid ongoing strikes.
 
Variety reports vendors have been told the ceremony honoring televisions best will not air on Fox as scheduled on September the 18th. Fox declined to comment. Hollywood productions have been essentially halted as more than 170,000 actors and writers push for better contracts to reflect the changes and the challenges to their industries in the era of streaming and the growing use of artificial intelligence as well.
 
And still to come, a major celebration, in the North Korean capital with flags and weapons and some very important guests as well. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[04:40:00]
 
FOSTER: We're getting some new images from North Korea's latest spectacle the grand party in Pyongyang. It's the main square was filled with people in brightly colored outfits jumping and dancing and waving. Kim Jong-Un was front of the centers.
 
They celebrated the armistice agreement that ended the fighting on the Korean peninsula 70 years ago and anniversary that North Korea falsely calls Victory Day. During the military parade, North Korea's prize whiles some 18 intercontinental ballistic missile.
 
And other hardware were on full display the North putting on a show, a high level delegation from close allies Russia and China. CNN's Marc Stewart is tracking all of this live from Tokyo and for many this is being seen as effectively Russia endorsement of that arms program in North Korea.
 
MARC STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Russia, not certainly is making some remarks to suggest that in fact, we are learning that North Korea actually North Korean leadership was provided a speech by Vladimir Putin not clear if this was something written or if this was something that was through video.
 
But Putin basically made some remarks suggesting that North Korea's support for the war in Ukraine really has emboldened these two nations to deal with the West. In the past United States officials have accused Russia of receiving help from North Korea in the form of rockets and artillery.
 
So that is a new narrative that is gaining some attention during what is taking place right now in Pyongyang. Let me get into a few more specifics about that parade. You mentioned the Hwasong-18 that is significant. It is a scene as a long range missile.
 
That according to some analysts does have the ability to target the entire mainland, United States. Also interesting during this parade, according to North Korea media, drones were flying overhead.
 <br>[04:45:00]
 
Two types of drones, one poor reconnaissance and the other being described as a multi-purpose attack drone. So this is happening as tension in this area continues to be very strong tension being between the United States with North Korea, South Korea and Japan.
 
In fact, as we have seen in recent days an American submarine has been in some of the South Korean ports, a submarine with nuclear capability that has drawn a lot of condemnation from North Korea. Even before that Max, we saw a missile test a long range missile test a missile that was in the air for about 74 minutes that paralleled in accord with the recent NATO conference.
 
So what we are seeing is displays of strength by the West, and then displays of response if you will from North Korea.
 
FOSTER: OK, Marc Stewart thanks for joining us with that. Chaotic scenes in Niger as the country's military gives it support to the ongoing coup. And it appears they're not alone pro-military protesters set fires around the party headquarters of the ousted President on Thursday.
 
The military has suspended all activities of political parties is warning against foreign intervention. And it says it supports the queue in hopes of preventing bloodshed and maintaining people's well- being. CNN's Larry Madowo following developments are for us, a scary time for people in Niger.
 
LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Scary time indeed. And there's some division among the public over who to support here. When the reports first emerged Wednesday, our President Mohamed Bazoum, being held at the Presidential palace by the Presidential guard that those who came on to the streets to support him and demand the return to democracy.
 
On Thursday, we saw pro-military protesters come out on the streets go to the National Assembly. They set fire to the headquarters of the party of the President. And most notably, they set fire to the French flag. And they held up some Russian flag some of them said -- are done with Russia, among other statements in support of Russia.
 
Again, it's too early to tell here. But this is notable only because there's a lot of anti-French sentiment in the region in France and Central West Africa. There is some growing Russian influence in that region, especially in Mali and the Central African Republic, where the Wagner group, the mercenary group has been active.
 
Who has a so French, who has a so Russian flag in Burkina Faso after the coup. So there appears to be a trend here. And some of these protests that I want you to listen to one of them and what they say about this particular protest.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have uranium, we have diamonds, we have gold, we have oil, and we live like slaves. Why should we until when we can't accept it, the French base in Niger must leave. We don't need the French to keep us safe.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MADOWO: The French have about 2500 troops stationed in Niger and in neighboring Chad. And to U.S. officials tell CNN that the American there are about a 1000 American troops in Niger as part of the counterterrorism operations there. Their army command, which has supported the military man that took over the country say that there should be no foreign military intervention in this situation.
 
Otherwise, it risks having very serious disastrous and uncontrolled consequences. So we still don't know about the status of President Bazoum. Even though, Max, the French Foreign Minister has said he's still reachable. He's spoken with President Emmanuel Macron. And there's still a chance that he might be returned to power but so far, we've not seen him. So it's all up in the air.
 
FOSTER: OK, thank you, Larry for that update. Now ahead, a big rally in the Women's World Cup and a big match on the way right now.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[04:50:00]
 
FOSTER: Legendary rock band, The Eagles has announced the death of Founding Member Randy Meisner. He wrote the, sang lead on their 1975 hit, Take It to the Limit and co-wrote many more songs for the group. Meisner is a contributor to the album's Desperado on the border, one of those nights and Hotel California as well.
 
The Eagles were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988. -- says Meisner died due to complications from the breathing disorder COPD, he was 77. Right now England and Denmark are fighting for the top spots in Group D the Women's World Cup England's lionesses are favored to win and already have a one goal lead.
 
Early today a stunning comeback by Argentina, South Africa went into the half with a comfortable to goal lead but the blue and whites came roaring back drawing the match level in the 79th minute. Both teams walked away with one point each the first ever for South Africa and the Women's World Cup.
 
LeBron James the son Bronny is out of hospital and on the road to recovery. The 18 year old suffered a cardiac arrest during basketball practice on Monday. Doctors say his workup is ongoing but they're encouraged by his progress and resilience as well.
 
LeBron James is breaking his silence tweeting I want to thank the countless people sending my family love and prayers. We feel you and I'm so grateful everyone doing great. We have our family together safe and healthy and we feel your love.
 
Now to spotlights stories in the spotlights rather, Taylor Swift fans are taking things to a whole other level. After two nights of dancing and singing at Swift era's tour concert in Seattle, a seismologist says the Swift is actually stirred up some seismic activity last weekend.
 
An earthquake with a 2.3 magnitude, strength or the equivalent to it you can see your screen, on your screen both measurements are from the nights.
 <br>[04:55:00]
 
The seismologist tells CNN Taylor Swift Quake is being compared to the Beast Quake 12 years ago that's when Seattle Seahawks fans roared, following an impressive touchdown by running back Marshawn Beast Mode Lynch, the Swifties Quake was twice as strong.
 
Most of the people collect Barbie dolls, but women in Germany have the largest collection in the world or one woman has Bettina Dorfman have a whopping 18,000 Barbies.
