ABBY PHILLIP, CNN HOST:  Today, pushing into the future with a little help from the past. It's day two of the Democratic National Convention here in Chicago, and one of the party's best and most effective speakers will headline that stage tonight. That's former President Barack Obama. 
 
According to one of his senior advisers, Obama will give a -- quote -- "forceful affirmation of Vice President Kamala Harris as the right leader for this moment."
 
JIM ACOSTA, CNN HOST:  Yes, I thought you were going to say that former first lady Michelle Obama was the headliner tonight. 
 
PHILLIP:  Right, yes. 
 
ACOSTA:  She's also very popular in the... 
 
PHILLIP:  Maybe the biggest star of the Democratic Party.
 
ACOSTA:  She's probably the biggest -- I think she might be. She will also speak tonight, along with the second gentleman, Doug Emhoff, and Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker. 
 
PHILLIP:  So, welcome to a special edition of CNN NEWSROOM here in Chicago. I'm Abby Phillip. 
 
ACOSTA:  I'm Jim Acosta.
 
And it won't just be the Democrats speaking at the convention this week. We are now learning that prominent Republicans will take the stage. One will join me just ahead, former Illinois Congressman Adam Kinzinger, who served on the January 6 Committee, and Olivia Julianna. She will also be here in just a few moments. She's a reproductive rights activist and political influencer who will speak tomorrow. 
 
PHILLIP:  And I will be speaking with former Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot this hour as well. 
 
So, Jim, so much ahead. Last night was a late, late night.
 
ACOSTA:  It was. PHILLIP:  But I think what it really emphasized...
 
ACOSTA:  And you were here late. 
 
PHILLIP:  I was here super late. 
 
ACOSTA:  Yes. 
 
PHILLIP:  What it emphasized to me was the degree to which this is a Democratic Party that has actually a lot of stars. They have got a lot of past stars, a lot of future stars. And conventions are usually the place to showcase those things. 
 
It is a bit of a contrast from what we saw at the RNC, which was all about one man, and rightfully so, to a degree. 
 
ACOSTA:  Yes. 
 
PHILLIP:  But this is a party that has a deep bench that they're drawing from, but particularly tonight, when two of their most effective speakers are hitting the stage. 
 
ACOSTA:  Yes, I mean, last night, it was sort of like a look to the past, but also we want to show off our bench, show off the future. You had AOC on stage. You had Jasmine Crockett on stage. I have to think that Jasmine Crockett earned that place on that stage last night because of what -- some choice words she had for Marjorie Taylor Greene not too long ago. 
 
PHILLIP:  And that's the big deal. 
 
ACOSTA:  Yes. 
 
PHILLIP:  I mean, she's a freshman in the Congress.
 
ACOSTA:  She is.
 
PHILLIP:  And really the other part of that, I think, as this convention has shifted from Joe Biden to Kamala Harris, there's been a generational shift as well. 
 
ACOSTA:  There has.
 
PHILLIP:  And they're really making a concerted effort to try to talk to younger voters to show the electorate that they are interested in elevating the next generation. 
 
ACOSTA:  Yes, it was a vibe shift last night. 
 
PHILLIP:  Yes. Well, that's what they were aiming for.
 
ACOSTA:  And we will see that continue tonight. That's exactly right. 
 
But first this hour, and we have been talking about this in the previous hour, reproductive rights have been a central focus for Democrats since Roe v. Wade was overturned more than two years ago. They're hoping it will be a driving issue at the ballot box come November.
 
During night one of the DNC, lawmakers praised Kamala Harris and her plan to restore abortion protections nationwide. Take a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEN. RAPHAEL WARNOCK (D-GA):  ... on women's reproductive rights, because we believe that a patient's room is too small and cramp a space for a woman, her doctor and the United States government. That's too many people in the room. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ACOSTA:  And to help reach younger voters on these key issues, the DNC is opening its doors to more than 200 content creators.
 
And 21-year-old political influencer and reproductive rights activist Olivia Julianna is one of them. She will take the stage tomorrow night. She shared the announcement to her friends and followers over the weekend, saying she hopes she makes her home state of Texas proud. 
 
And Olivia Julianna joins us now. 
 
Olivia, great to see you, kind of in person. We haven't spoken before, although I see you're very active on social media. 
 
And I'm sure that is exactly what the Democrats have in mind and having you address the convention here. What would you say are the biggest issues for younger voters right now? And how big of a difference is Gen Z going to make in this race? 
 
I mean, one of the things that we have seen in the polls, Olivia, is how there has been a big shift in terms of support for Kamala Harris than we saw for the president just a few weeks ago. 
 <br>[11:05:11]
 
OLIVIA JULIANNA, GEN-Z FOR CHANGE:  I think the thing about young voters that a lot of people often get wrong is, they kind of see us as having these very focal issues, when the reality is, the issues that the majority, all generations of Americans care about are the same issues that young voters care about. 
 
And so, for us, a lot of that is the Dobbs decision, so Dobbs and democracy. It's about protecting our fundamental freedoms. It is about reclaiming what it means to be a patriotic American who cares for your fellow Americans. And so I think that those are the two issues that I would say are most important to young people, that and the economy. 
 
But when it comes to reinvigorating this Democratic Party, I think it's because Kamala Harris is representative of the American dream. She's representative of the future of what this country can hold. And I think that that's why so many young people are so excited and so energized to vote for her, is because she represents what is possible when you come to America, when you work hard and when you believe in this country. And I think that she's giving young people something to be hopeful
 
 for. 
 
ACOSTA:  Yes. 
 
JULIANNA:  And young people are an incredibly important electorate. It's not just smoke and mirrors. 
 
We have seen young people make the difference in the 2022 midterms. We saw them make the difference in 2020. Youth voter turnout is steadily increasing. And I think that, with Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket, it is going to surge. 
 
ACOSTA:  Yes. And what was that moment like when we saw President Biden step aside and put his weight behind Kamala Harris and the explosion that we saw on social media?
 
There was talk of coconut trees and vibe ships and brat summers and so on, a lot of references that just, frankly, go over the heads of a lot of the folks in my business who are of a certain age. But describe that moment. It was a big moment. 
 
JULIANNA:  It was surreal. 
 
And I think a big part of that is because, in the history of this country, we have seen men consistently prioritize their own power and position over the needs and the rights of women. And we are in a time right now where women's fundamental freedoms are under attack. 
 
And so for Joe Biden to so selflessly step out of the presidential race and to uplift Kamala Harris in such a strong way, I think that sent a very strong message to young people. And I think that that's why you see so much joy and enthusiasm, is because they realize that their elected officials are listening to them and that that gives them hope for what's possible for the future of this country...
 
ACOSTA:  Yes. 
 
JULIANNA:  ... and for them coming into adulthood and starting a life of their own. 
 
ACOSTA:  Yes, and, Olivia, I do want to play some of what Donald Trump has had to say about the issue of abortion. He is trying to obviously put this in the review mirror. He's saying it's no longer a big factor. Let's take a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (R) AND CURRENT U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  So I think the abortion issue has written very much tampered down. I think that abortion has become much less of an issue. 
 
It's a very small -- I think it's actually going to be a very small issue. I think the abortion issue has been taken down many notches. I don't think it's of -- I don't think it's a big factor anymore, really. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ACOSTA:  Yes, eight states are going to have abortion on the ballot this November. I mean, what's your response to former President Trump? I mean, he's trying to say it's no longer an issue, but it's going to be on the ballot in a lot of states.
 
That might make things very interesting on election night. 
 
JULIANNA:  I think that abortion is still an issue to women like Amanda Zurawski and Kate Cox from Texas, my fellow Texans who both faced medical repercussions because of how severe Texas' abortion ban is. 
 
And so many millions of women across America see themselves in these two selfless women who are willing to tell their story. And while we have ballot initiatives in several states across this country relating to abortion access, the reality is, abortion is on the top of the ticket in all 50 states, because Project 2025 outlines specifically how to ban abortion even if we don't have a Congress willing to do it. 
 
And so for Donald Trump to so foolishly claim that abortion doesn't matter after the electoral impact we have seen abortion make in the last two years not only shows that he has bad political instincts, but it also shows that he's trying to shift the narrative away from something that he knows as a loser, just like he is. 
 
ACOSTA:  All right, Olivia Julianna, a rising force, along with the rest of Gen Z, inside the Democratic Party. 
 
Thanks, Olivia, for joining us. Really appreciate it. 
 
JULIANNA:  Thank you. 
 
PHILLIP:  And still ahead for us, I'm going to speak with a senior adviser to President Biden. He's going to talk about that rousing and emotional speech from the president last night and how he's pushing forward to a future with Kamala Harris potentially in the White House. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 <br>[11:14:21]
 
PHILLIP:  Welcome back to a special edition of NEWSROOM. 
 
We are now just hours away from day two of the Democratic National Convention. Former President Obama will deliver the keynote address tonight. 
 
But I want to bring in Steve Benjamin. He's a senior adviser to President Biden and the director of the Office of Public Engagement. 
 
Last night, Steve, President Biden, he received a real rousing welcome in this hall. I wonder what it was like for you and for the people who work for him who've been through -- it's been a tough four to six weeks here for the whole Democratic Party. What was that like? 
 <br>[11:15:00]
 
STEVE BENJAMIN, SENIOR ADVISER AND ASSISTANT TO PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well I'd say -- I'd say that, while the last few weeks were rough for the party, I think we're in a really, really special place right now. 
 
And you look at the world through Joe Biden's eyes. He talked about his nearly 50 years of service and most importantly about when he decided to get back into the arena four years ago. The country is coming out of its -- or in the middle of its greatest pandemic since 1918, maybe the greatest economic disruption since 1929 and the greatest social unrest after the killing of George Floyd since 1968 all wrapped up in one. 
 
And he stepped in the arena. He fought the fight. And, as a result, the country is in a much better place. So I would say, I think, last night, we all looked at it through that lens, that this man who's dedicated his entire life to public service once again did something noble. 
 
He stepped aside in the spirit of George Washington, and he's passed on the torch to a new generation with Vice President Harris. So, as someone who's had the privilege of working with and for our president on behalf of the people of this country, representing that sacred trust that the Office of Public Engagement represents, it was humbling. 
 
It was exciting. I was getting calls and text messages from my two teenage girls who were loving and savoring the moment as well. So it was a special night. 
 
PHILLIP:  He spoke for about four -- 50 minutes. And it was a really forceful speech for him very late in the night. 
 
There are a lot of Republicans still questioning whether Biden can even serve out the rest of his term. What do you say to them? 
 
BENJAMIN:  That's foolishness. I mean, I stay on this side of the aisle. I don't engage in the politics of the day. 
 
But that level of vigor, that sharp mind of this man who literally -- people can say what they want. America is safe and respected abroad, with 16 million new jobs, over five million people who've seen over $170 billion in student debt forgiven, the less people crossing the southern border now than the previous president was in office, fighting every day to lower not only costs for people at the grocery store, but obviously some significant announcements, including this past week on lowering the cost of prescription drugs. 
 
The president is getting the job done. He's kicking butt and taking names. So, all the people who just want to engage in nattering nabobs of negativity, they can do what they want to do. This man is doing his job. 
 
PHILLIP:  Impressive alliteration there. (LAUGHTER)
 
BENJAMIN:  He's kicking butt and taking names.
 
PHILLIP:  So, last night, during the speech, folks at home may not have seen this, but I was sitting at our set that was right next to the section where there were some protesters who tried to unfurl a banner. 
 
That is an undercurrent of this convention is the degree to which there are people in the Democratic family who want to send a message to this president about Israel and Gaza. 
 
What message is President Biden sending to them right now? 
 
BENJAMIN:  The transparency and openness of Joe Biden, who made a pledge last night that he was going to get -- find peace in the Middle East before he left office. We're running through the tape. 
 
We're keeping our heads up and keeping our heads down, and an enduring peace that said -- I think, last night, he said, we're going to end this war. He's committed to it. I know he works every single day working to get hostages home and find an enduring peace in the Middle East.
 
And if anyone can do it, it's a man who's dedicated his life to not only serving people here domestically, but ensuring our relationships abroad. So he's committed to it.
 
And I will say this as well. He spoke directly to it in a way last night that was candid, that validated the voice of those who are protesting, because that -- this is America, where we're only free because all of us are free and people can share the voices and dissent in a way that doesn't get them shouted down and beaten up or what have you.
 
PHILLIP:  Well, someone did hit someone with a sign last night. 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
BENJAMIN:  Yes. I saw something online about that.
 
PHILLIP:  Yes.
 
BENJAMIN:  But that's not who we are. And the president spoke to that very clearly last night. We speak to our better angels. And he is committed to an enduring peace and protecting and preserving everyone's right to free speech. 
 
PHILLIP:  The big night tonight, the big speakers are the former President Barack Obama, former first lady Michelle Obama. 
 
What can we expect to hear from them? What message do they have to convey to the American people about the months ahead for Vice President Harris and for the country? 
 
BENJAMIN:  Well, they're both amazing, generational leaders.
 
I had a chance to be with President Obama and President Clinton in New York at the big event just several months ago, when they came to support President Biden. The way in which both of the former presidents, but particularly President Obama, articulates the successes of the last four years, in a very candid way, that Joe Biden's gotten so much done that more than anyone could ever expect, I think we will see an articulation of that, that wonderful partnership and friendship that they enjoy. 
 <br>[11:20:03]
 
But I expect -- there's a lot of -- we're in Chicago. This is their hometown. And there's a lot of 2008 energy in this space right now, and the parallels between his meteoric rise and the amazing rise that we have seen of our vice president and this historic moment before the country right now, obviously a blending of a very positive and beautiful genuflection to President Biden, but putting more wind in the sails of our vice president and the history that awaits her, her story that awaits her. 
 
PHILLIP:  And an earlier program, a faster program than last night?
 
BENJAMIN:  I'm not in charge of that. 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
BENJAMIN:  That -- I -- we will defer to Jaime Harrison and our amazing convention chair, Minyon Moore, on that. 
 
PHILLIP:  All right. All right. Well, we will be looking for that 2008 energy. 
 
Steve Benjamin, thank you very much for joining us. 
 
BENJAMIN:  Thank you. 
 
ACOSTA:  Yes, a lot of folks rubbing their eyes this morning here on day two of this convention. All right, guys, thank you. 
 
Still to come, we will go back in time 20 years ago. A state lawmaker from Illinois made his DNC debut. You might know him as Barack Obama. He is back in his political hometown and he's set to headline tonight's festivities. 
 
New reporting and what we know about his speech, that's next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:25:53]
 
PHILLIP:  Welcome back to special coverage of the Democratic National Convention live right here from the United Center in Chicago. 
 
In one word, Vice President Kamala Harris' central message is freedom. You couldn't miss it last night. ACOSTA:  Yes. 
 
PHILLIP:  Last night, she walked out to her new anthem, Beyonce's hit song "Freedom," and after speaker after speaker framed this November as a choice between freedom and fear. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D), FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  As a prosecutor, Kamala locked up murderers and drug traffickers. She will never rest in defense of our freedom and safety. 
 
REP. JAMES CLYBURN (D-SC):  But our resolve to remain a great country with freedom and justice for all will not falter. 
 
REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD):  Let's let freedom ring and let's let democracy work in America. 
 
GOV. ANDY BESHEAR (D-KY):  Elect Kamala Harris and Tim Walz and protect reproductive freedom. 
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Let me ask you, are you ready to vote for freedom? 
 
AUDIENCE:  Yes!
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ACOSTA:  I'm sensing a theme. Freedom may be a common, unifying American value, but in recent years, Republicans have tried to own the rhetoric around being a patriotic American. 
 
That has been changing, we just showed you a few moments ago, here at the DNC. And on Monday, chants of "USA" frequently broke out here in the convention hall as the raucous crowd wave signs like these. Contrast that with the "Mass Deportation Now" signs that we saw last month at the Republican National Convention. 
 
Let's discuss, something to talk about here, with CNN political commentators Ashley Allison and Scott Jennings. 
 
Are you feeling the freedom vibe, Ashley? And it was kind of everywhere last night. 
 
ASHLEY ALLISON, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  I'm feeling very free. 
 
ACOSTA:  Yes. 
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
ALLISON:  I'm leaning into the freedom. 
 
ACOSTA:  Yes.
 
ALLISON:  It seems like they have swapped the word democracy for freedom, which I think is really smart. In 2022, Democrats really ran on the theme of protecting our
 
 democracy. That was still very much in this moment. But when we talk about freedoms, it's not just talking about freedom to vote. It's talking about freedom for bodily autonomy, freedom to learn where you want, a freedom to love who you want. 
 
And so it really is an inclusive word that can -- whatever aspect of your life, it can really resonate with the voter for the thing that you feel like the opponent, Donald Trump, is trying to either take you away for or come into your life and determine how you can move and make decisions. 
 
So, last night was electric. I was sitting right over there beneath the vice president and Tim Walz and Doug Emhoff. And I just have to say, when Joe Biden was -- came out and was just getting a hero's welcome, I saw Doug, the second gentleman, wipe away tears. He was becoming overwhelmed. 
 
And I think It just reminds, like, even though we're working so hard, there really is a relationship between those two couples. And it was really beautiful to see. 
 
ACOSTA:  Yes. 
 
PHILLIP:  Tim Walz, I thought, also was very affected last night. 
 
ALLISON:  Yes.
 
PHILLIP:  But one of the things that we actually, probably we were not talking a lot about, they had Mallory McMorrow, the state legislator who kind of became a social media star, come out with a giant book that said "Project 2025" on it. 
 
And they're going to make that a theme every day of this convention. So there's a positive message of freedom, but they're also really trying to hang that giant book, Project 2025, around Donald Trump's neck. And they have a captive audience for it. 
 
SCOTT JENNINGS, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  Yes, and an audience willing to buy a bunch of lies. 
 
I mean, Donald Trump has disowned this. He has no part of it. He has his own agenda. Throughout all the speeches, there were attacks on Donald Trump that are not rooted in reality. 
 
But this convention wants to hear -- what was amazing to me about the whole night, and particularly Joe Biden's speech, is just what a fabricated reality he lives in and what a fabricated reality they want their base to live in, because the reality is, this is not Trump's agenda. They come out with this massive, cartoonish, oversized prop. 
 <br>[11:30:00]
 
But the whole point is to make a whole crowd of people believe something that's not true. 
 
ACOSTA:  But, Scott, we had it on video last week. 
 
JENNINGS:  So, if you're going to do that, I guess it's fine. 
 
ACOSTA:  We had it on video last week. We had the hidden camera footage last week.</pre>
