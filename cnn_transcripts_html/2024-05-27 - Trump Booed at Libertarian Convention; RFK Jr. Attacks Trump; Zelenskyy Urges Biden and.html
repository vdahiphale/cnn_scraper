MARIA CARDONA, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR AND DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: This is clearly the evidence of that.
 
JIM ACOSTA, CNN ANCHOR:  Yes, Ana, what did you make of this when you saw this?
 
ANA NAVARRO, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  You know, it was somewhat astounding, right? Because we are so used to seeing Donald Trump just in his little protected bubble of MAGA followers. But I also think that this is an acknowledgement by Trump and his campaign that MAGA followers are not going to get him into the White House. And that if he wants to get elected, he needs to go figure out how to appeal votes from other groups, that not may not be with him traditionally.
 
Now, it's a heck of a way to try to campaign and get somebody's vote by talking down to them and saying, yes, go ahead. Get your normal 3 percent, you bunch of losers. I mean, it was -- and he looked pained. He was grimacing during the entire time. He's obviously not used to being outside the mothership, outside his MAGA bubble.
 
ACOSTA:  Yes, that was definitely not the mothership. And, Maria, I mean, the other thing that took place we saw RFK Jr. also addressing this convention. He -- RFK Jr. going after Trump in these scathing criticisms on X.
 
We put -- if we have somewhere, we can put up on stream, but if not, he said Trump scammed American workers, let the Bush wing of the GOP run all his agencies and let the worst rioting and looting occur since the 1960s. You know, there's been a lot of discussion about, you know, who RFK Jr. is going to hurt more. This is kind of fascinating to see RFK Jr. really going after Trump like this.
 
CARDONA:  Yes, I thought that was interesting. I think that what has been surprising that there's been several polls that have shown that RFK Jr. may actually take more votes from Trump than he does Joe Biden. And look, I don't think that's something that the Trump campaign, up until now, has was prepared to face. I think that's one of the reasons why they went there.
 
ACOSTA:  Yes.
 
CARDONA:  And now, I think they're really seeing RFK Jr. as a real threat. And look, for President Biden, they have been on this from day one. They have not taken anything for granted. They have focused on RFK Jr., making sure that Americans understand what he's about, all of his conspiracy theories, his anti-vax positions, you know, his waffling on women's right to vote. All of the issues that we know are important to the vast majority of Americans and how RFK Jr.'s anathema to those positions, but it seems like the Trump campaign is just now catching up saying, oh, no, this guy could be a real threat to us.
 
ACOSTA:  Yes, the Biden team, they've stood up a whole wing of the campaign to go -- 
 
CARDONA:  Exactly.
 
ACOSTA:  -- to keep their eyes on RFK Jr.
 
CARDONA:  Smartly.
 
ACOSTA:  And, Ana, I did want to ask you -- get both your thoughts, if we've got time, what do you think is going to happen with this trial? I mean -- and how all of this might affect the campaign. I mean, there's a new poll -- relatively new poll Marquette Law saying that if Trump is found guilty, 43 percent of registered voters would choose Joe Biden. If he's found not guilty, the numbers flip.
 
I mean, I know the polls are all over the place. We don't know which polls are up and which polls are down these days. Ana, but what's your sense of it? Could it have that big of an impact?
 
NAVARRO:  You know, with Trump, you'll never know. I have given up thinking that there's anything that's going to make his supporters lose -- have any less support of Trump. We've seen time and time again that they simply don't care. And I think this is bacon into the cake.
 
I'm one who has thought that this trial process has actually, in some ways, helped Trump because it's taken him off the campaign trail and he is not on a daily basis saying the stupid things that he says when he is on the campaign trail. So, in a way -- and because there's no cameras in the courtroom. If there were cameras in the courtroom, and we had seen the Stormy testimony, if we had seen the Michael Cohen testimony, if we had seen all of the things that we would see in a courtroom when there's cameras in it, I think we would all be transfixed. We would all have been watching this 24/7.
 
But what we're getting from analyzing transcripts and third-hand knowledge of what's going in the courtroom is simply not having that kind of effect on the American public. Very few people who are not getting paid to pay attention to this trial are paying attention to this trial.
 
ACOSTA:  Yes. I mean, Maria, I mean, Trump was complaining that because of the trial, you can't get out on the campaign trail as well. Well, he got on the campaign trail, went to a Libertarian Convention. It did not -- 
 
CARDONA:  It didn't go so well.
 
ACOSTA:  It did not go so well.
 
CARDONA:  Yes.
 
ACOSTA:  So maybe -- I mean, Ana might be on to something here that perhaps it's not going to be the verdict, it's just going to be that trauma is going to be sprung loose to be out on the campaign trail and have these moments where he may have to come face to face with how the public feels about the way his four years in the White House went.
 
CARDONA:  Yes, I agree. And I think one of the important facets about that is that I think that many voters are going through amnesia. And so, the best person to remind Trump what Trump is about is Trump. Because he not only will do exactly what he did in the four years that he was in office, but he has made no secret that he would do that on steroids.
 <br>[10:35:00]
 
He would institute mass deportation. He would institute a family separation, rip children from the arms of their moms. He clearly has said that he would take away women's rights federally. He even talked about how he might want to regulate contraception.
 
So, I think Ana's right, the more that he is out there talking about the crazy stuff that he will do, the more it's going to remind people this is not somebody that is fit for office and certainly not somebody that I want making decisions for my family.
 
ACOSTA:  Yes, Ana, I mean, you know, that is -- that's something that the Biden campaign, they've been -- you know, they've been sort of criticized a little bit for maybe not doing enough. We saw a new ad from Biden campaign just in the last few days trying remind people, OK, this is what Donald Trump was about. It -- are the Biden folks doing that enough? Is the president doing that enough?
 
NAVARRO:  I think they've begun to do it. And I think that campaign ad that we saw come out last week was very effective. But they've got to do two things, right? They've got to walk and chew gum at the same time. They've got to, number one, remind people who Trump is and remind people of Maya Angelou's words, when somebody shows you who they are, believe them the first time. There is no need for a second term of Donald Trump to remind us of who Donald Trump is.
 
And the second thing the Biden campaign and Biden has to do is be future looking, right? Look towards tomorrow for people. It's not just about vote for me because I'm not Trump and he is awful, it's about vote for me because I am the future, because this is what I offer you, because this is what I see in America's tomorrow.
 
ACOSTA:  All right. Maria and Ana, looks like nice weather down in Palm Beach. Hope you're enjoying it, Ana. Good to see you.
 
CARDONA:  Thanks, Jim.
 
ACOSTA:  Thanks. Thanks, Maria.
 
NAVARRO:  Yes. But -- I wanted to see the dog. I wanted to -- ChaCha wanted to see Buddy.
 
CARDONA:  And me too.
 
ACOSTA:  I know. So did Duke. I know. They should just let us bring the dogs in. I mean -- 
 
CARDONA:  I totally agree.
 
ACOSTA:  -- I'm putting that in the suggestion box.
 
CARDONA:  I'll bring my two pups too.
 
ACOSTA:  There you go. All right. Very good. Ladies, thanks so much. Appreciate it.
 
CARDONA:  Thank you.
 
ACOSTA:  All right. Coming up. Getting aid to Ukraine. Scott Kelly joins me next to talk about his meeting with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. We'll talk about that in just a few moments. Stay with us.
 
And as we head to break, this is a live look at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial where this afternoon a ceremony will be held to remember and honor those who served and sacrificed all for our country. Please stay with us. We'll be right back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:40:00]
 
ACOSTA: Ukrainian President Zelenskyy is urging President Biden and China's President Xi Jinping to join 80 other nations in attending a Peace Summit next month in Switzerland. That appeals follows another deadly weekend in Ukraine as a Russian strike killed at least 17 people in a hardware store.
 
A video from inside the store, you can see it right here in the City of Kharkiv, shows the moment Russian guided bombs struck. Paint and other chemicals fueled an intense fire in the store. Ukrainian officials say there were no military targets anywhere in the area and a 12-year-old girl was among the dead.
 
Joining me now is Commander Scott Kelly, a retired U.S. astronaut. He just returned from Ukraine last week. He's been collaborating with the humanitarian non-profit group, Nova Ukraine. Scott, great to see you as always. Really appreciate it.
 
You know, we just showed the video of this attack on this hardware store a few moments ago. Obviously, the Russians are continuing this strategy of hitting the civilian targets very hard. You just returned from Ukraine just in the last several days. How are things there? What did you do? What can you tell us?
 
SCOTT KELLY, RETIRED NASA ASTRONAUT AND WORKING WITH UKRAINIAN AID GROUP:  So, we had a conference, Jim, just to talk about the successes we've had with United 24, $650 billion raised. And I want to thank all the donors for doing that. It's so very important. We've delivered over 200 ambulances, rebuild schools and bridges. Just so, so much great work.
 
I had been there -- the last time was November 2022. And just seeing the resilience of the Ukrainian people fighting against Russia and, you know, the horrors they just deliver to the Ukrainian people on a daily basis, it's just so, so hard to see.
 
AMANPOUR:  And how was President Zelenskyy? You met with him. What did he have to say? What was your sense of it?
 
KELLY:  You know, he's desperate for help. You know, this is a war that they are fighting and they're defending democracy and freedom around the world at the expense of their soldiers, at the expense of their civilians, their infrastructure, at the expense of their country. And it's just so sad.
 
I visited a rehab center and met with a bunch of Ukrainian soldiers. Most were amputees from, you know, one limb to three limbs. You know, they all had the same exact look on their faces. You could just tell they've seen the horror of war. And you know, we need to do everything we can to help them because they are fighting for us. They're fighting for freedom around the world.
 
ACOSTA:  And any mention of this massive new aid bill for Ukraine that just got through the Congress? Is that -- did the president talk about that and indicate whether or not, you know, this is going to help quickly or what was your sense of that part of the conversation?
 <br>[10:45:00]
 
KELLY:  Very, very thankful for everything that the American public has provided. You know, let me share an interesting story with you about that aid bill. I had a friend of mine at my house a few days before I went to Ukraine, an older woman from Texas. And when she realized I was going to Ukraine to help these people, the look of disgust on her face was just absolutely disgusting to me.
 
And she said, why are we sending all that money over there? And I had to explain to her of that $65 billion, I think $55 billion of that is spent in the United States, workers that are making weapons that are -- actually, those weapons, in some cases, they're not even sent to Ukraine. They're the replacements for the ones that are expiring that need to be used. So, we're sending them to Ukraine and we're replenishing our weapons with that aid money.
 
But, you know, when you live in this echo -- right-wing news echo chamber, I was like, where do you get your news from? Newsmax, Fox, Tucker Carlson, echoing Putin's talking points, I was absolutely disgusted. The fact that, you know, that money is spent here. You know, those weapons, in most cases, were going to expire anyway, and the Ukrainians need them, and they're using them to defend us against a potential future foe.
 
ACOSTA:  I mean, I guess that raises the question, Scott, is whether or not what you just said is being explained enough here at home.
 
KELLY:  I don't think it is. And that's why I brought it up. I mean, I think people need to realize that it's not like we're putting money in a truck and dumping it in Kyiv. It's mostly being spent in the United States. And those people support -- you know, with that money, they support their communities, they pay taxes.
 
It's kind of like the space program. You know, people used to say to me, why do we spend all this money in space? And I would say, you know, I was on that space station for a year. There's no money there. That money was all spent on the ground.
 
ACOSTA:  Yes. Well, and you mentioned space. I do want to ask you about this upcoming flight of the Boeing Starliner. The launch set to take place June 1st. Apparently, they're dealing with a helium leak right now. Currently, what's your read on that? Does that mean that we could be confident this is going to happen at the end of the week? Might there be more delays? What's your sense of it?
 
KELLY:  You know, after spending 20 years at NASA, I always say, you know, when people would ask me on my launch, you know, on the space shuttle, they say, well, you know, what's the odds you're going to launch? I'd say 50/50. We're either going to go or we're not. And we're going to go into ready, and we're not going to go if we're not ready. Hopefully, they'll be ready, maybe they won't. Space is hard.
 
ACOSTA:  Have you done launches where there have been little nuisances, leaks, or reported problems like that, and you work them out and then do the launch that day, or when you hear reports like this, does it make you think, OK, well they may have to delay this a day or two?
 
KELLY:  You know -- 
 
ACOSTA:  No rhyme or reason.
 
KELLY:  -- sometimes -- 
 
ACOSTA:  Yes.
 
KELLY:  You know, sometimes they could fix those things fast, sometimes you can just launch as is. You know, this is the first flight of this vehicle. So, they -- with people on it. So, they don't know, you know, a whole lot about his performance. So, I think it's important for them to take a very measured, safe, cautious approach.
 
ACOSTA:  All right. Scott Kelly, Commander Kelly, thank you so much. Always enjoy having you on, especially when you have the astronaut suit behind you. I notice it almost every time, but I have to say it again, one of the best backdrops out there. Thanks a lot, Scott Kelly. And thanks for the important work that you're doing over in Ukraine. Really appreciate that as well.
 
KELLY:  Happy Memorial Day.
 
ACOSTA:  Coming up -- and you as well. Coming up, a former "General Hospital" actor gunned down in Los Angeles. What police are saying about what happened as the search for the suspects continues.
 
And as we head to break, this is a live look at the World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C. as our nation honors and remembers service members who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. Stay with us. We'll be right back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:50:00]
 
ACOSTA:  All right. You are looking at live pictures right now of Arlington National Cemetery. President Biden, in just a few moments, we'll be laying a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Right now, you can see, I believe, the second gentleman making his way in. We're going to bring those remarks to you live in just a few moments. So, stay tuned for that.
 
In the meantime, I believe our Kevin Liptack is standing by. Kevin what can we expect from the president's remarks?
 
KEVIN LIPTAK, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE REPORTER:  Yes, certainly one of the most solemn days for any American president. Obviously, it's a reminder of the weight that rests on their shoulders every day. And I think for President Biden, this day takes on personal meaning. Of course, he does want to emphasize the sacrifice that generations of Americans who lost their lives fighting for this country. And certainly, this wreath laying at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is just the kickoff.
 
We did hear President Biden over the weekend speaking to cadets at West Point, talking about the importance of democracy and talking about the oath those cadets would take, saying that it wasn't an oath to a particular president, to a particular political party, but in oath to the constitution. And I think, certainly, in his remarks later today, the president could emphasize that as well.
 
And you see him there walking out to the tomb of the unknown soldier with the vice president, with the secretary of defense, certainly, a solemn moment for the president today on Memorial Day, Jim.
 
ACOSTA:  Absolutely. And as you said, a very personal day for the president as well as son, Beau Biden, of course, the dying after his service. And we're going to see this unfold here in just a few moments. Let's listen in and we'll talk about this on the other side, Kevin.
