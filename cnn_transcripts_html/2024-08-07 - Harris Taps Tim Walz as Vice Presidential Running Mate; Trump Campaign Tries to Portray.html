CHRISTINA MACFARLANE, CNN ANCHOR: Hi, welcome back to CNN NEWSROOM. Here are some of the top stories we're following today. 
 
A 5.2 magnitude earthquake shook a broad stretch of Southern California, including the Los Angeles area overnight. You can see the shaking was captured on the Santa Monica Pier cam. No injuries or damage has been reported so far. 
 
Elon Musk X-filing a lawsuit against a group of advertisers over an alleged boycott on the platform. The lawsuit claims a major ad group organized to collectively withhold billions of dollars in advertising. 
 
And the tough questions are expected to keep coming for Boeing in the hours ahead. It's the second day of hearings over the blowout of a Boeing 737 door plug in January. On Tuesday, interview transcripts revealed that Boeing employees had described a push by the company to do their work faster.
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR: Well, Kamala Harris' pick for vice president is a hit with Democratic donors. The campaign says it has raised more than $20 million since she announced that Tim Walz would be her running mate on Tuesday. He spoke to a fired up crowd in Philadelphia.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOV. TIM WALZ (D-MN), VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Some of us are old enough to remember when it was Republicans who were talking about freedom. It turns out now what they meant was the government should be free to invade your doctor's office.
 
(BOOING)
 
WALZ: In Minnesota, we respect our neighbors and their personal choices that they make.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
WALZ: Even if we wouldn't make the same choice for ourselves, there is a golden rule -- mind your own damn business.
 
(APPLAUSE) (END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: Walz is a popular two-term governor of Minnesota, but his time in office hasn't been without some controversy. CNN's Whitney Wilde has this profile.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
WHITNEY WILD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The national spotlight is shining on humble roots as Minnesota Governor Tim Walz becomes Kamala Harris's vice-presidential running mate.
 
WALZ: I couldn't be prouder to be on this ticket.
 
WILD (voice-over): Before running for office, Walz was a geography teacher in public schools and a football coach from rural Mankato.
 
WALZ: High school geography teachers don't usually think that. Look, it is -- it is humbling. It's a privilege. It's surreal.
 
WILD (voice-over): His resume also includes more than two decades in the Army National Guard, including a deployment overseas after the 9- 11 attacks.
 
WALZ: Want to thank the gentleman --
 
WILD (voice-over): The two-term governor previously served in Congress for 12 years, representing a rural district that voted for Trump twice.
 
In 2006, he won his first congressional race, ousting a six-term Republican incumbent.
 
WALZ: They liked me. They trusted me. They said, Tim, I think you're trying to do it right.
 
WILD (voice-over): His first term as governor saw some of the state's most turbulent times, when riots broke out after the murder of George Floyd.
 
As parts of the city burned, Republicans blasted Democratic leaders' response.
 
DONALD TRUMP, THEN U.S. PRESIDENT: In recent days, our nation has been gripped by professional anarchists, violent mobs, arsonists, looters, criminals, rioters, Antifa, and others. A number of state and local governments have failed to take necessary action to safeguard their residents.
 
WILD (voice-over): After days of riots, Walz called in the entire Minnesota National Guard.
 
WALZ: Let's be very clear: the situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd. It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear, and disrupting our great cities. WILD (voice-over): His record of progressive policies, such as codifying abortion rights, adding protections for transgender people, passing paid sick and family leave, and implementing free breakfast and lunch programs in schools, makes him appealing to some on the left and a target for Republican criticism, which he has begun to push back on.
 
WALZ: What a monster. Kids are eating, eating and having full bellies so they can go learn. And women are making their own healthcare decisions.
 
WILD (voice-over): Earlier this year, Harris visited a Minnesota abortion clinic with Walz, the visit marking a big impact on her decision, a source close to the governor told CNN.
 
KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S. (D) AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You've been a great friend and adviser to the president and me and thank you for all of that.
 <br>[04:35:00]
 
WILD (voice-over): Walz joins the ticket, having already made his mark on the race, coining a new line of attack against GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump and his Republican allies with a single word: "weird."
 
WALZ: We're not afraid of weird people.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No.
 
WALZ: We're a little bit creeped out, but we're not afraid.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
FOSTER: It's interesting. I mean, taking someone as your vice president who's very experienced is going to have some sort of -- you know, the payoff is that there's going to be something in his long career that the Republicans are going to be able to attack, but at the same time, she gets the experience that she's probably looking for.
 
MACFARLANE: Yes, it works both ways. Yes. And as I was saying before, I mean, he has no qualms about coming out of the gates fighting and taking the fight to Donald Trump, who now looks a little uncertain of his, you know, his platform in some ways.
 
So anyway, the Trump campaign isn't wasting any time after going off the Walz, painting him as a radical liberal. Here's the Republican vice president, JD Vance, what he had to say.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH), REPUBLICAN VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: This is clearly a ticket that is designed to increase inflation, to reduce law and order and to make it harder to build a business or just a life in the United States of America. And I think they've set up the contrast very nicely for us. And President Trump and I just have to make our argument to the American people.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: In a fundraising e-mail, Trump claims Walls would be the worst vice president in history, unleashing hell on earth. CNN's Kristen Holmes has a closer look at the Republican attacks.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Donald Trump's team wasted no time trying to define Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. They are looking at his progressive record as governor and really trying to double down on it to say that he is a radical liberal.
 
Remember, that has been a main talking point about Vice President Kamala Harris, that she has far left of President Joe Biden. And take a listen to this ad that they released just after Tim Walz announced.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Tim Walz will be a rubber stamp for Kamala's dangerously liberal agenda. Like allowing convicted felons to walk free, embracing anti-American green new deal policies, and giving up control of our southern border to criminal aliens and violent drug cartels.
 
HOLMES: So clearly they are doubling down on this narrative. We saw Donald Trump himself posting that the two of them were the most radical duo in American history. You're going to continue hearing that narrative.
 
But one thing that cannot be denied is what we saw in Philadelphia, which was a lot of energy, a lot of crowd cheering, a big crowd for the two of them, Harris and Walz as they took the stage.
 
That is going to be something that Donald Trump has to contend with. Remember, they had been planning on a race against President Joe Biden. And even though they said they were prepared for anything to happen, obviously, this has changed the dynamics moving forward.
 
They are looking at new talking points, new rhetoric as they move forward and head towards November.
 
Kristen Holmes, CNN, Philadelphia.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
FOSTER: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has issued an emergency ban of the common weed killer, DCPA, also known as Dacthal. Is that how you pronounce it?
 
MACFARLANE: I think so. It's often used on grass, artificial turf, fruit crops and vegetables such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbages and onions. The EPA says that Dacthal poses serious risks to unborn children.
 
It says exposure may be linked to low birth weight, impaired brain development and other health issues. This is the first time in 40 years that the EPA has used its emergency suspension authority. 
 
Now Disney streaming services are set to get more expensive. Beginning on October 17th, U.S. subscribers will have to pay $1 to $2 more per month for Disney Plus, Hulu and ESPN Plus.
 
FOSTER: Disney's steadily raised the prices of its streaming offerings since launching Disney Plus nearly five years ago. At launch, the ad- free service costs just $6.99 a month. That same ad-free plan will cost $15.99 after the latest price increase.
 
MACFARLANE: A lot more, isn't it? 
 
Now, a new Olympic event is underway right now in Paris. The Mixed Marathon Racewalk Relay made its debut today with teams of one man and one woman competing in a 50 kilometer race.
 
FOSTER: It's unbelievable how fast they go, isn't it? Day 12 is also set to feature the medal race of a new sailing event this year, the Mixed Dinghy. The men's park skateboarding final is also on the schedule.
 
MACFARLANE: You've been enjoying the skateboarding, haven't you?
 
FOSTER: I saw the women's yesterday and the commentators were brilliant in explaining exactly how they gathered the points. I mean I put a bit of a controversial point out there. My son's quite into skateboarding.
 
MACFARLANE: OK.
 
FOSTER: He sees it more as a freestyle thing. You go with the flow and it shouldn't be scored by people. But they've got to have a rules system, haven't they, if they're going to make it a sport?
 
But there was, you know, Japanese winner. I mean, I don't know that much about skateboarding, but it seemed perfect as they were talking through the commentary.
 
MACFARLANE: It's just getting so many, and this is the point, young people interested in the Olympics. 
 
FOSTER: Yes.
 
MACFARLANE: I mean, these -- I don't want to call them kids, these teenagers are the ones winning the Olympic medals and they are extraordinary.
 <br>[04:40:00]
 
FOSTER: I'll also make the point that people are saying it's a relatively new sport, which is why young women are winning it. At my age, we were skateboarding. I think there are people of all ages doing it. I just think they're exceptionally good.
 
MACFARLANE: I love the idea of you skateboarding.
 
FOSTER: Which is why young women are winning it. At my age, we were skateboarding. I think there are people of all ages doing it.
 
FOSTER: My brother was better at it, which still annoys me.
 
MACFARLANE: Let's go to -- stop chatting and go to Amanda Davies. She's standing by. Apologies, Amanda, to give us the highlights. Have you ever tried a bit of skateboarding, Amanda? I imagine you have.
 
AMANDA DAVIES, CNN WORLD SPORT: No, do you know what? My first skateboard I got from the supermarket from Tesco's when I was about nine. I don't think it would cut the mustard at an Olympic Games. But I have to say, Max, your trainer collection definitely would fit at the skate park.
 
I don't know what you're wearing today. Absolutely, of course.
 
The performance by Arisa Trew yesterday was spectacular. I have to say, that's a similar word you could use to describe the project that was six years in the making for Gabby Thomas, the 27-year-old from Atlanta who now lives in Austin, saying it is unbelievable, indescribable to claim Olympic gold. She beat St. Lucia's 100 meter champion Julien Alfred in the final of the 200 to claim victory, not only for Team USA, but to become the first, the only Harvard University graduate to win track and field gold at an Olympics.
 
She says it was watching Allyson Felix in London 2012 that inspired her. Felix won seven Olympic golds in her career, so still some way to go for Gabby. But she'll be hoping for more in the 4x100 relay, which is still to come.
 
But if Gabby Thomas went into her final as the favorite, then Cole Hocker's victory in the men's 1500 was an entirely different story. This one had been billed as a race for the ages, the Olympic champion up against the world champion, Jakob Ingebrigtsen, up against Josh Kerr. 
 
But 23-year-old Hocker, who finished sixth in Tokyo, had very different ideas. His was an epic run, storming from fifth place to last -- to first, I should say, over the last 300 meters, to set a new Olympic record on the way to taking gold. 
 
Ahead of Kerr in silver, with Team USA's Yared Nuguse in bronze, it's the first time in 112 years the two American men have medaled in the middle distance event. 
 
Elsewhere, the Emma Hayes era, well and truly in full swing with the U.S. women's national football team. She's only been in charge, you might remember, since the end of May, but has led them to what is set to be an epic Olympic football final against Brazil. They produced a really hard-fought extra-time victory over Germany. It was Sophia Smith's 95th-minute winner that made the difference, to book their place in the gold medal match as they look for their first Olympic title since 2012.
 
But also set to be the legendary Marta's last-ever game for Brazil. This, her sixth Olympic Games, she'll be desperate to lead her country to a first international crown. That final taking place on Saturday. But as you mentioned, loads to look forward to here on Day 12. Another day, a fab day on the agenda. USA's Katie Moon is the defending champion, heading into the women's pole vault.
 
We're expecting a great battle between the USA's Quincy Hall and Team GB's Matthew Hudson-Smith, the former roommate of Noah Lyles. That's the men's 400 meters. 
 
And the women's golf fit is underway at Le Golf National. Not a familiar course for many of the women's players, but it's Nelly Korda, who's the defending champion, France's Celine Boutier, carrying the hopes of the host. She's the top-ranked European.
 
MACFARLANE: Looking forward to that. Spectacular course, actually, Le Golf National. I've been there a few times.
 
FOSTER: Is it?
 
MACFARLANE: I have. Amanda, so much to look out for. Thank you so much.
 
FOSTER: Still to come, it's the fragrance for a man's best friend. A luxury brand unveils a designer perfume for your dog. Chrissy is going to like this.
 
MACFARLANE: More dog stories. Bring it on.
 <br>[04:45:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: A grim delivery to Gaza. On Monday Israel's military returned 89 bodies to the territory inside a shipping container. Israel didn't provide the identities of the dead or information about when or how they died.
 
MACFARLANE: Palestinian officials and grieving families are seeking answers. Jomana Karadsheh has the story and a warning viewers may find images in her report disturbing.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Gazans gather around this shipping container but it's not aid or food that's arrived from Israel. It's dead bodies. The decomposing remains of 89 of their dead handed back by the Israeli military on Monday. Who they are how they died where or when no one knows. 
 
We were surprised to find that 13 bodies in the form of bones were placed in one bag, Dr. Hamad Al-Maghir (ph) says. Some of the bodies in this container were killed three, four or five months ago and others more recently he says. 
 
Through the stench of death and with the little they have forensic teams do what they can to try to identify them but most are unrecognizable. Still they try to document whatever they find. This new mass grave is dug for the unidentified in a cemetery where the displaced living and the dead exist side by side.
 
By concealing information from the families this is a new crime by the Israeli occupation this local official says. We don't know if they were exhumed from graves or if they came from the occupation's prisons. 
 
The Israeli military has not commented on the transfer nor did it respond to CNN's request for comment but it had previously admitted exhuming bodies from Gaza cemeteries. It said it returns them after checking they're not Israeli hostages. 
 
As news of the arrival spread crowds converged on this graveyard in Khan Younus. There were those who were there to document possible war crimes and those desperately hoping to find their loved ones here. The living and the dead who vanished throughout this war. 
 
Al-Mohammed (ph) has been searching everywhere for her two boys who disappeared 25 days ago. She approaches the truck describing what they were wearing.
 
One of them was wearing a big watch. They tell her they found one matching that description. It's her sons she says. They tell her she can look through photos of the remains tomorrow. But all she wants is to see the body to find her boys and lay them to rest. She tries before disappearing into the chaos.
 <br>[04:50:00]
 
Ibrahim is here looking for his parents. Their graves were dug up a few months ago and their bodies went missing. He searched every hospital and morgue to bury them once again.
 
He believes he's found his mother's body with the same blanket he wrapped her in, he says. I think God loves me because I'll be able to bury my mother for a second time, Ibrahim says. There are people who have not been able to retrieve the bodies of their children from under the rubble.
 
Smoke billows in the distance from yet another strike. In this seemingly endless war that has taken so much from so many. A war that has even stripped the dead of their dignity.
 
Jomana Karadsheh, CNN, London.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
MACFARLANE: Now, it is no secret that Kamala Harris as presidential campaign is a big hit with the social media generation. And her pick for vice president is fitting right in. 
 <br>[04:55:00]
 
FOSTER: Sure is, here is Minnesota Governor Tim Walz posting about his visit to the state fair with his daughter, Hope. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HOPE WALZ, TIM WALZ DAUGHTER: I think were going to go do this sling shot. 
 
T. WALZ: Which I don't know what it is, and they're keeping it from me. But then were going to go get some food. Corn dog?
 
H. WALZ: I'm vegetarian. 
 
T. WALZ: Turkey then.
 
H. WALZ: Turkey's meat.
 
T. WALZ: Not a Minnesota, turkey special. And we will go do some of those things and report back.
 
H. WALZ: Oh my!
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MACFARLANE: Oh, I love that so much. Like every dad comments ever, isn't it? I love it.
 
FOSTER: I've done a few versions of that myself.
 
Walz also avowed fan of pop star Taylor Swift, and that's how some speculating about a possible endorsement or looking for one at least. The governor posted a photo on X back in 2022 of his cap with the caption --
 
MACFARLANE: Afton.
 
FOSTER: Afton after being online all day and not getting Taylor Swift tickets. 
 
MACFARLANE: Come on Taylor Swift, you got to hear from you. Swift endorsed Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, you'll remember on Twitter in October of 2020. 
 
Too soon to know whether shell do the same, I guess for the Harris- Walz ticket. 
 
FOSTER: Well, she got that backlash from Trump last time, didn't she? So she's probably going to try --
 
MACFARLANE: There's still time. All right.
 
FOSTER: Yes, go for it.
 
MACFARLANE: My story. Move over, Coco Chanel. There's a new canine clone on the markets.
 
Dolce &amp; Gabbana has now released a designer fragrance just for dogs. That's right, a blend of mist, of Lang Lang, musk and sandalwood.
 
FOSTER: Such detail coming from you, Chrissie.
 
MACFARLANE: What's it called? Fepe. Fepe. So chic.
 
FOSTER: It's said to be inspired by Domenico Dolce's unconditional love for his dog.
 
MACFARLANE: Well, I know you have three dogs, Max.
 
FOSTER: I do have a Pomapoo as well. I've got a Poodle.
 
MACFARLANE: I'll be getting you for your next birthday.
 
FOSTER: I can only sort of imagine Poodles wearing cologne.
 
MACFARLANE: Oh, hang on a minute. The price tag, however, just over $100 for 3.4 ounces. Forget it, you're not getting that for your birthday.
 
FOSTER: What cost of living prices?
 
MACFARLANE: That's one pretty pooch, that, isn't it?
 
FOSTER: People pretty into their dogs.
 
MACFARLANE: Perfume. Perfume for the pooch in your life. 
 
Thank you for joining us here on CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Christina Macfarlane. He's Max Foster. And CNN "THIS MORNING" --
 
FOSTER: Stinky jokes.
 
MACFARLANE: -- is up next.
