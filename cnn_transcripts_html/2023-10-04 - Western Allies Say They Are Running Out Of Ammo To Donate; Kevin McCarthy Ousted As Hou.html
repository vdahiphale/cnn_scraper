JOHN VAUSE, CNN ANCHOR: Ahead this hour on CNN Newsroom, ammunition mass. With Ukraine firing ammunition faster than the U.S. and allies can make it, NATO officials warn their stockpiles are running low. 
 
So now what? With no plan and no replacement, hard right Republicans out the speaker of the U.S. House it throwing Congress into chaos.
 
And tragedy in Venice, 21 dead after a passenger bus plunges from a bridge. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Live from CNN Center. This is CNN Newsroom with John Vause. 
 
VAUSE: Wherever you are around the world, thanks for joining us here on CNN Newsroom. We begin this hour with a major new commitment from the European Union, which has approved more than $52 billion to support Ukraine's recovery from the war. 
 
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen says E.U. support for Ukraine is unwavering. The financial aid will be spread out over four years and is separate from any military assistance. In the U.S. though with Congress in turmoil and future Ukraine funding on hold, the Pentagon is urging lawmakers to act soon to ensure an uninterrupted supply of weapons for Ukrainian forces.

SABRINA SINGH, DEPUTY PENTAGON PRESS SECRETARY: We know that their priorities are air defense and artillery and also mine clearing equipment, so that's what our focus is on. So that, of course, is what we're inevitably going to be refilling as well. But you have to remember, in the beginning of the war, were also sending Javelins, stingers, other things like that. So those also are being replenished, but we've done so over time. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: One defining feature of the war in Ukraine has been the incredible amount of ammunition fired by both sides. One expert put Ukraine's artillery fire at 7,000 rounds a day. For context, one of the main munitions producers in the U.S. can produce 11,000 rounds in a month. 
 
And now, after more than a year and a half, NATO's top military official is warning that Western allies are running low on their own ammunition stockpiles. Admiral Rob Bauer, though, says, quote, the bottom of the barrel is now visible and the industry needs to step up production. 
 
Senior UK defense official James Heapy echoed the warning during the same panel discussion which was held at the annual Warsaw Security Conference. He says Western allies cannot stop supplying the Ukrainians just because their stockpiles are running low. 
 
On the positive side, Ukrainian soldiers say recently arrived Western tanks are making a major difference on the battlefield. CNN's Fred Pleitgen reports. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Ukrainian troops trying to push forward on the southern front. Leading the charge, a German made Leopard two main battle tank, showing the Ukrainians say that they've gotten much better at using Western armor. 
 
PLEITGEN (on camera): But in general, it's more of a fast assault type way of using a tank, I assume. 
 
RUSTAN, UKRAINIAN ARMED FORCES: Yes, if it use it on assault. But not on the minefield. 
 
PLEITGEN (voiceover): It was a major issue when Ukraine first started using tanks like these in its large scale counter-offensive in late June. Expected to be an immediate game changer. The Ukrainians now acknowledge losing both Leopards and American made Bradleys in the vast minefields the Russians had planted. 
 
But a tank unit that uses the Leopard 2 tells us, they've vastly improved their skills. We realize what we need to know with this tank, he says. The more you work, the more you understand, and you start working automatically. 
 
That soldier, whom we can only identify as Bars, even briefed Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the Leopard 2, saying it easily withstood an explosion from a Russian kamikaze drone. It's a good tank, he says. It withstood the hits. 
 
The crew says western tanks like this also have better guns, better range finding and night vision capabilities than Russian tanks, major assets both on the southern and eastern front lines. 
 
PLEITGEN (on camera): The Ukrainians say they've always known that these tanks have exceptional capabilities, but now they say they're increasingly getting used to using them effectively for assault. PLEITGEN (voiceover): The southern front remains the main thrust of
 
 Ukraine's counter-offensive. Kyiv releasing this video purporting to show Russian vehicles hit near the town Tokmak leading to massive explosions. Even though Russia's defense minister claims the Ukrainians haven't managed to break through Moscow's defenses there. 
 
Through active actions, our troops significantly weakened the enemy's combat potential and inflicted serious damage to him, he says. 
 <br>[01:05:05]
 
But the Ukrainians say they are the ones with the momentum, also thanks to their improved use of tanks they've received from NATO countries. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, in eastern Ukraine.

VAUSE: Well, it took just eight Republicans in the U.S. Congress to oust Kevin McCarthy, a move without president, of leaving the chamber without a leader, no obvious replacement, and throwing the business of government into chaos. McCarthy was House Speaker for just 269 days, the shortest of more than 140 years, and he has no plans to be speaker again. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KEVIN MCCARTHY, U.S. HOUSE REPUBLICAN: I don't regret standing up for choosing governance over grievance. It is my responsibility. It is my job. I do not regret negotiating. Our government is designed to find compromise. 
 
I don't regret my efforts to build coalitions and find solutions. I was raised to solve problems, not create them. So I may have lost a vote today, but as I walk out of this chamber, I feel fortunate to have served the American people. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: McCarthy was the victim of growing infighting within the Republican Party. Just days earlier, he struck a last minute deal with Democrats to avoid a government shutdown. That concession, though, seemed unforgivable for far right Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz, who led the revolt against McCarthy. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MATT GAETZ, U.S. HOUSE REPUBLICAN: Kevin McCarthy is a feature of the swamp. He has risen to power by collecting special interest money and redistributing that money in exchange for favors. We are breaking the fever now, and we should elect the speaker who's better.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: U.S. House will likely be out of session for the rest of the week, which means no progress on a deal to fund the government, and future Ukrainian funding is left in limbo. Candidates for the next speaker, possibly one of the worst jobs in Washington, could be considered next Tuesday. A number of names already being tossed around, as CNN's Manu Raju reports now from Washington. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Republicans struggling to figure out their way forward after today's historic vote kicking out Kevin McCarthy, the first time ever a sitting speaker of the House ejected from his seat by his own colleagues. 
 
This vote coming after eight Republicans sided with all Democrats to kick him out. Kevin McCarthy could only afford to lose four Republicans, so he was unable to convince some of those members on the hard right in particular, who were unhappy about some of his deal making. Really only two deals in particular. 
 
One, to raise the national debt limit to avoid a debt default, he had to get a deal with the White House and Senate Democrats in order to get that through. Also the other one, to avoid a government shutdown. That's something that he had cut over the weekend and allowed Democrats to help push that through to avoid a potentially disastrous government shutdown and just to keep the government open for another 45 days. 
 
That was enough to lead the Matt Gaetz, the Congressman from Florida, to lead the charge to seek Kevin McCarthy's ouster. He got the support of seven other Republican colleagues, enough to kick out McCarthy in a startling move that really caught many of his own colleagues by surprise, announcing that he would not be a candidate for speaker again.
 
Kevin McCarthy said that he would step aside. He told me that he could potentially name a get behind a successor, but he said wouldn't disclose who because he didn't know who would possibly run. Now this all comes as tension is growing among those McCarthy allies, going after some of those critics who pushed out Kevin McCarthy, questioning whether they are true conservatives. 
 
AUSTIN SCOTT, U.S. HOUSE REPUBLICAN: I think Kevin recognizes that nobody can meet their demands, and the conference is going to have to figure out how we deal with, you know, eight people that are here that candidly aren't interested in governing. They're more interested in grifting. 
 
DERRIC VAN ORDEN, U.S. HOUSE REPUBLICAN: Republicans who have been claiming to be fiscal conservatives just voted with every single Democrat in the House of Representatives. That would be the equivalent of every Republican voting for Nancy Pelosi. That's what they did. 
 
RAJU: Mr. Jordan, how disappointed are you with what happened here? 
 
JIM JORDAN, U.S. HOUSE REPUBLICAN: And speak on a card. I thought it was unfair to Kevin. Kevin, I think, has done a fine job, and he and I came in together. He's a good man, and he didn't deserve this, in my judgment. RAJU: Will you run for speaker? 
 
JORDAN: That's a decision for the conference. 
 
RAJU: Are you open to it? 
 
That last comment could be significant. Jim Jordan, who's House Judiciary Committee Chairman, pointedly declined to say whether he would rule out running for speaker. He had typically in the past ruled out running for speaker. This is the first time he has indicated that he, in fact, is not ruling out the possibility of running for speaker, saying that it is a conference decision. So we'll see what he ultimately decides. 
 
But he could have a race. Kevin Hern, who's the chairman of the Republican Study Committee, the largest group of conservatives, is open to the idea of running. He's floating his name, according to sources that we have spoken to. Also, we'll see what Tom Emmer, the Republican whip, decides to do, or he gets behind Steve Scalise, who's the current number two, the House Majority Leader, whether he decides to run for speaker. 
 <br>[01:10:07]
 
So a lot of questions in this tumultuous moment for the GOP. Can they pick up the pieces? Can they get their agenda going? Can they avoid a government shutdown? All huge questions after Kevin McCarthy becomes the first speaker to meet his fate on the fall of the House. Manu Raju, CNN, Capitol Hill. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
VAUSE: Ron Browstein is CNN senior political analyst and a senior editor for The Atlantic. He joins us now from Los Angeles. Good to see you, Ron. 
 
RON BROWNSTEIN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Hi, John. 
 
VAUSE: OK, so at this point in time, with the federal government about a month or so away from another funding crisis, the House decided that this was a good take, an unprecedented move of ousting the speaker with no one in line waiting to replace him. What happens now? 
 
BROWNSTEIN: Yes. Well, you know, first of mean, how many nights have we been here and said, this is a day we've never seen in American history. This is a day we have literally never seen in American history. The only other time there was a motion to vacate, it was instigated by the speaker himself, Joe Cannon, considered by some of the most powerful speaker ever. And he won that vote after losing some preliminary votes that weakened his power.
 
So, yes, I mean, you know, the lesson here is that there is a portion of the Republican conference that feels that it has to be seen always taking every confrontation to the max and that any form of collaboration or cooperation or compromise with Democrats really is another word capitulation. And you know, this decapitation of the House leadership is going to
 
 loom over whoever replaces McCarthy and how they approach this next government shutdown. Because it is pretty ironic that Kevin McCarthy is taken down on the grounds that he was insufficiently committed to confronting and combating Democrats. 
 
I mean, if you look at his record, there are a lot of things you can accuse Kevin McCarthy of, but the idea that he was some sort of rampant deal maker with the two big exceptions is pretty far-fetched. 
 
VAUSE: Well, Kevin McCarthy knows who is to blame for all of this. Here he is. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MCCARTHY: I think today was a political decision by the Democrats and I think the things they have done in the past hurt the institution. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: So as the Democrats. Well, what about that Republican Congressman from Florida, Matt Gaetz, Trump supporter, bomb thrower, who formally introduced the motion to vacate? Again here's Kevin McCarthy. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MCCARTHY: You all know Matt Gaetz. You know, it was personal. It had nothing to do about spending. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: So what, the Democrats are to blame because they didn't defend the Republican Speaker from fellow Republicans? It's all their fault. You know, explain the politics here and how this all erupted with basically the far right siding with the Democrats to get Kevin out of the job. 
 
BROWNSTEIN: Yes, look, I mean, as I said, there has been for a long time a portion of the Republican Conference whose principal goal is to cause maximum disruption in Washington. They are reflections of the same impulse that has allowed Donald Trump to emerge as leader of the Republican Party. There is a big portion of the Republican base that is so alienated from what America is becoming and the way it is changing that they believe any means necessary are not only justified, but required to fight the Democratic agenda. 
 
And anything short of essentially total war is, you know, is ground, is kind of viewed as treasonous. This was the charges that John Boehner faced when he was speaker and he quit the job kind of one step ahead of the mob ready to push him out. Paul Ryan came in, faced the exact same dynamic. Even Newt Gingrich, whose career began by accusing his own error as leadership in the being too cooperative with Democrats. He faced a rebellion on the right and ultimately left. 
 
This is a long standing dynamic in the Republican Party. It has been turbocharged by the emergence of Donald Trump and, you know, the question will be McCarthy, by and large, acceded to these demands. I mean, he launched an impeachment inquiry without any hard evidence against Joe Biden. He censured Adam Schiff. He mainstreamed Marjorie Taylor Greene. He voted to overturn the 2020 election. 
 
But twice when he, you know, faced the risk of destabilizing the global economy, he would not jump into that abyss on the debt ceiling or the government shutdown. And that was too much for this band of Republicans. And it really does make you wonder, whoever takes the job, can they maneuver in any way to avoid kind of economic calamity or just really to keep the lights on, do the bare minimum of what government needs to do? 
 
VAUSE: Well, the divers cast things back in January. It took 50 rounds of voting, whatever, a couple of days before McCarthy was actually elected speaker. 
 <br>[01:15:04]
 
Here he is speaking then why that was actually a good thing. 
 
BROWNSTEIN: Yes.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How do you expect to govern this way if it has been taking this long to get the conference united? 
 
MCCARTHY: See, this is the great part, because it took this long, now we learned how to govern. So now we'll be able to get the job done. Thank you all very much. See you later. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: Did he learn how to govern? I mean, that amendment to the rules, which basically give a one vote as a motion to vacate, which is what Gaetz used to get rid of him. Does that make this job just a poison cellice (ph) that no one actually wants because they're now talking about Donald Trump taking it? 
 
BROWNSTEIN: Yes. Yes. I mean, look, McCarthy was clearly one of the weakest speakers of certainly the 20th since the beginning of the 20th century. Some people describe him as speaker in name only, and he took the job under circumstances that really made it impossible to do the job. 
 
You do wonder if whoever takes the job next will demand a change in that provision to get to at least some reasonable number, because in the end, McCarthy did hold the vast majority of his caucus with him and it was only eight that were needed to take him down. 
 
And the idea that Democrats would protect McCarthy after the comments you saw before of him blaming them? Or him blaming them for the shutdown over the weekend? Or him launching an impeachment inquiry on his own dime after saying that he was going to bring it to a vote or him voting to overturn the 2020 election. It was kind of absurd that he now cast himself as some kind of paragon
 
 of institutional responsibility. And you know, knocking him out is kind of threatening the pillars of the house itself. He was a deeply partisan and polarizing speaker whose general strategy was to give the right almost everything it wanted and expect that the members from more competitive districts will ultimately go along. The almost was the rub. 
 
And you know, twice he would not take the risk with the global economy. And you do wonder if kind of the Wall Street wing of the Republican Party, you know, was saying to him, in effect, OK, this is just too far. We are not going to countenance going to this direction. And that ultimately set him, you know, in collision with the hardline MAGA forces in the coalition. 
 
VAUSE: That line from Batman that Alfred said, sometimes people just want to watch the world burn. Ron.
 
BROWNSTEIN: Absolutely.
 
VAUSE: Good to see you. Thank you, sir. 
 
BROWNSTEIN: Thank you, John. 
 
VAUSE: In northern Italy, at least 21 people were killed and 18 others hurt when a passenger bus creamed off an overpass near Venice. Two of the victims were children. For now, there's no word on what caused the bus to crash through what appeared to be a safety barrier erupting into flames as it hit the street below. Officials say the bus driver is among those killed. A crane was then used to remove the wreckage.

VAUSE: It took Azerbaijan's military little more than a day to take control of the breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh. But a crisis response leader for the Red Cross tells CNN the main city there is nearly completely deserted. Only those unable to travel or with no family stayed behind. Details now from CNN Scott McLean. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): The view from the ground shows road after road of abandoned shops and homes. From above what was once a bustling city just two weeks ago, now all but cleared out. The town square, a desolate ghost town filled only with belongings left behind. On the road to Armenia, broken down vehicles have been ditched, one
 
 still with a trunk full of clothing. A U.N. mission reported estimates of between only 50 and 1,000 ethnic Armenians still inside Nagorno- Karabakh. Everyone else was either afraid or unwilling to live under Azerbaijani rule. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): My nine-year-old son says let's go back to Stepanikurt and live in a brocade without any sweets or any food, but at least in our home. 
 
MCLEAN: The Red Cross is now going around the empty city of what Armenians call Stepanakert, looking for the tiny number of people still left.
 
MARCO SUCCI, INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE OF THE RED CROSS: Elderly who cannot move, bedridden patients who were left with food (INAUDIBLE), and water just close to the bed in order to be fed and fine for a few days. It's really heartbreaking to see how difficult has been for those living, but also how difficult is for those who remain here. 
 
MCLEAN: All told, well over 100,000 people have fled to Armenia. 
 
MCLEAN (on camera): Is that the desired outcome? 
 
HIKMET HAJIYEV, ADVISER TO AZERBAIJANI PRESIDENT: Actually, no, in no way that's in a desired outcome, because Azerbaijan on multiple occasions and through different channels, and also publicly stated that we are providing rights and security of Armenian residences in Karabakh. After the post conflict situation, there are elements of the panic. Unfortunately, it also happens and also what we see there was an element of manipulation by the illegal regime as they tried also to spread in a panic among the civilian population. 
 
MCLEAN (voiceover): Hajiyev would not unequivocally say that all ethnic Armenians would be entitled to keep or sell their homes in the Nagorno-Karabakh. But Azerbaijan has promised and delivered freedom of movement to allow people to leave, even for those who took up arms. 
 
Though there are some high profile exceptions. Like the former state minister Ruben Vardanyan arrested on the border. His children have pleaded for international help securing his release. Meanwhile, the president of the former separatist government, Samvel Shakhramanyan, is still in the region. 
 
MCLEAN (on camera): He has not been arrested. 
 
HAJIYEV: He's not under the arrest, and he continues his interaction with appropriate Azerbaijan authorities. 
 
MCLEAN: Is it possible that he will be arrested? 
 
HAJIYEV: I don't know. I don't have answer to that question because it's a legal question and therefore there should be legal answer for that. 
 
MCLEAN (voiceover): Meanwhile, in Armenia, the parliament voted to join the International Criminal Court. The hope is to get justice for alleged crimes across the border in Azerbaijan on a piece of land that very few Armenians still live on. Scott McLean, CNN, London.

VAUSE: Serbia's police has detained a top Kosovo Serb politician days after he admitted to taking part in a recent gun battle which escalated regional tensions. Milan Radoicic was detained by police after he searched his apartment. He was later taken to prosecutors in Belgrade accused of manufacturing and trafficking firearms to Kosovo. 
 
Kosovo police released drone footage which they say Radoicic is with a group of armed men sitting there with the armed men outside a Serbian Orthodox monastery in the village where the gun battle took place. One Kosovo police officer was killed in the incident. 
 
Meantime, the U.S. says it has seen some withdrawal forces and material (ph) by Serbia along the Kosovo border. The State Department said Tuesday it expects Belgrade to continue these deescalatory steps. Washington's confirmation comes a day after Serbia's president said his country has reduced the number of troops along the border. However, Kosovo's president tells CNN's Christiane Amanpour her country is under attack.

VJOSA OSMANI, KOSOVO PRESIDENT (through translator): Kosovo is facing unprecedented challenges, secure 30 challenges that are stemming from Serbia's act of aggression that took place on the 24 September. 
 <br>[01:25:05]
 
It was a clear act of aggression ordered by the decision maker, by the state apparatus of Serbia, carried out by terrorist and paramilitary groups. But this act of aggression did not happen just at once. It was well planned, well-structured and prepared with the sole purpose of a Crimea style annexation of the north of Kosovo. Thankfully, the Kosovo police, with the support of international partners, stopped this plan from being exercised.

VAUSE: CNN has reached out to the Serbian presidency about the claims from Kosovo's president. 
 
In Bangkok, authorities say a 14-year-old boy shot and killed at least two people and wounded five others at a busy shopping mall. Officials say the suspect has mental health issues and it's still not known how he actually got hold of the gun. CNN's Paula Hancocks has details. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): The Bangkok shopping mall where the shooting took place was very busy at the time. We're hearing this from the police chief who's given a briefing just outside the Siam Paragon Mall in central Bangkok. And he said that it was raining outside and a lot of people were inside when gunfire was heard. 
 
Now, we have seen images of many of those people rushing for the exits to get away from the gunfire. Now, the details we have from the police chief at this point is that a 14-year-old boy has been arrested. He said that he was taken to a police station for interrogation with juvenile experts. 
 
Now, he has pointed out there are certain things that he cannot disclose because the suspect is a juvenile, a 14-year-old. Now, he does say that he has mental health issues. He had been treated at a hospital, also pointing out that he had stopped taking his medicine and was told to cheat people. 
 
Now, these are details that are coming to us at this point from the national police chief. He also pointed out that the suspect had said that he likes playing video games. Now, what he hasn't told us at this point is how this individual was able to get hold of a gun. 
 
Now, gun ownership is fairly high in Thailand, certainly when you compare it to other countries in Asia. But there are checks and balances. You have to be at least 20 years old. There are background checks that are routinely done. So the question has to be how did a 14-year-old with mental issues manage to get hold of a gun? 
 
Now, one other thing that the national police chief did say was that he wanted to commend the police and also those in the mall for their quick action, saying that this situation could have been a lot worse given the fact that the suspect had more ammunition when he was apprehended.

Morgan State, is a small, historically black university. The campus went on lockdown, but the shelter in place order has now been lifted. 
 
More details on the story as we get them. Former U.S. President Donald Trump says he will be back in court on
 
 Wednesday for day three of his civil fraud trial in New York. What remains uncertain is will he continue to publicly vilify the judge, his clerk, and other court officials because if he does, he could face some very serious consequences.

KARA SCANNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Day two in court for former President Donald Trump and a gag order from Judge Arthur Engeron after Trump attacked the judge's clerk in a Truth Social post claiming without evidence that she was Senator majority Chuck Schumer's girlfriend. 
 
The judge saying quote, "Personal attacks on members of my court staff are unacceptable, inappropriate, and I will not tolerate them under any circumstance."
 
The judge ordering all parties not to speak publicly about members of his court staff under the threat of serious sanctions. The post has since been deleted, but yesterday Trump attacked the clerk outside the courtroom. 
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This rogue judge, a Trump hater, the only one that hates Trump more is his associate up there, this person that works with him, she's screaming into his ear on almost every time we ask a question. It's a disgrace. If you want to know the truth, it's a disgrace.
 
SCANNELL: The second day of the civil trial to determine the future of Trump's business starting with further attacks from Trump on New York attorney general Letitia James. 
 
TRUMP: This case should be dismissed. This is not a case. And she should probably be dismissed also because she is terrible and grossly incompetent. 
 
SCANNELL: As he defends the valuation of his properties and the Trump organization. 
 
TRUMP: She said it was $18 million, it's $1.5 billion. Likewise, we just recently sold two properties for many times what they were worth, many times what they were worth. 
 
SCANNELL: Trump's former accountant Donald Bender continued to testify, as Kevin Wallace, a lawyer for the attorney general, methodically reviewed accounting engagement letters for 2012 through 2020, making the point that it was up to the Trump Organization to provide accurate data to accounting firm Lazar (ph) for its annual financial statements. 
 
Bender testified that he later learned the Trump Organization withheld appraisals from his firm. Had he known that at the time, he said, they would not have compiled the financial statements. Entering a break, Trump confirmed that he plans to testify in his own
 
 defense. His name had been on the trial's witness list. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mr. Trump, will you be testifying? 
 
TRUMP: Yes, I will at the appropriate time.

Well, in Haiti, there is a feeling of cautious hope a day after then U.N. Security Council authorized an armed multinational security force to try and restore order. 
 
But as CNN's Patrick Oppmann reports it will face some daunting challenges including widespread gangs, poverty, and deep mistrust.

OPPMANN: Following months of increasing violence on Monday, the United Nations Security Council voted to authorize a Multinational Security Support or MSS force to try to halt the gangs' assault on Haiti that has displaced more than 200,000 people. 
 
DANESE: The resolution makes clear the MSS mission will operating in strict compliance with international law, and include dedicated expertise in anti-gang operations, community-oriented policing, children and women's protection and preventing and responding to sexual and gender-based violence. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In our struggles - 
 
OPPMANN: Kenyan troops are expected to lead the force with 1,000 police officers on the ground for the mission that the U.N. authorized to last for 12 months. Antigua and Barbuda, Jamaica and the Bahamas are also expected to provide personnel. The U.S. State Department has promised over $100 million in aid for the effort. 
 
But foreign interventions and U.S. peacekeeping missions to Haiti have a troubled past. In 2010, U.N. peacekeepers working in Haiti accidentally reintroduced cholera, killing nearly 10,000 Haitians and infecting an additional 800,000 people. 
 
And a report found that U.N. peacekeepers fathered hundreds of children with Haitian women and then abandoned them. 
 
The U.N. Secretary General told CNN it was up to the peacekeepers' home countries to make them provide for their children. 
 
ANTONIO GUTERRES, UNITED NATIONS SECRETARY GENERAL: But it has been very tough to make things move, very tough. There's a lot of reluctance. And my appeal to member states is to really make sure that those that have children recognize them and do the best they can to assume their responsibilities as fathers. 
 
OPPMANN: And the aftermath of natural disasters, the assassination in 2021 of the Haitian president, and now out of control gang warfare, Haiti's barely functioning government was forced to plead for the return of a U.N.-led armed force.
 
JEAN VICTOR GENEUS, HAITIAN FOREIGN MINISTER: Deploying the force as a first stage is essential to create a security environment that is conducive to the normal functioning of institutions. But it's not enough. 
 
Socioeconomic development must also be taken into account to once and for all address extreme poverty, which is the source of all of our problems. 
 
OPPMANN: Any international police force that arrives in 80 will likely find WELL armed gangs prepare to fight back. Widespread official corruption and a local population that is skeptical of their mission. 
 
Help may finally be arriving for Haiti, but it remains unclear if it has come in time.

VAUSE: Well, it wasn't remarkable for what it was, but rather where it happened. A small group of visiting Israeli officials, including Israel's communications minister, held a prayer service to celebrate the Jewish holiday of Sukkot.
 
But this took place in Riyadh in Saudi Arabia and under Saudi law, Islam is the only religion which can be practiced in public in the kingdom. 
 
Notably though, Israeli and Saudi leaders are working to normalize relations. 
 
Joining us now is Steven Cook, senior fellow for Middle East Studies on the Council on Foreign Relations. Good to see you again. 
 
STEVEN COOK, COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS; Great to be with you. 
 
VAUSE: So this kind of was an amazing a moment in and of itself, a prayer service for the Jewish holiday of Sukkot taking place in Saudi Arabia, in Riyadh. And clearly, both sides are sending a message here. Because these images were made public. What is their message? 
 
COOK: Yes. It's something rather extraordinary. Something I never thought I would see in my lifetime. Jewish prayer happening in Riyadh, and that it be broadcast to the world. 
 
I think it is yet another signal from the Saudis that they are interested in normalizing relations with Israel, and importantly -- importantly normalizing Judaism in their society. 
 
It was not long ago that official Saudi media sources referred to Jews as the descendants of pigs and apes. So this signals a major change in the direction of Saudi Arabia, but also Judaism as a religion. 
 
VAUSE: I want you to listen to the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaking last month at the U.N. General Assembly. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER: There is no question, the Abraham Accords heralded the dawn of a new age of peace. But I believe that we are at the cusp of an even more dramatic breakthrough. A historic peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VAUSE: So is the biggest challenge to that peace deal - is that coming from within Netanyahu's own, far-right coalition government and those members who are opposing any concessions to the Palestinians? 
 
COOK: Yes, absolutely. That really is the problem. The Saudis have been very clear that it's not a question of if, but a question of when. 
 <br>[01:39:49]
 
COOK: But Netanyahu has a problem within his coalition and that he does have a variety of very far-right members of his governing coalition who, if you ask them whether they prefer normalization with Saudi Arabia, or annexation of the West Bank in changing the status of the holy sites in the old city of Jerusalem, they would pick annexation and change in the status of the holy sites. 
 
Until he resolves that political problem, I think the Saudis will take the kinds of steps that we have seen, without there being that kind of big agreement that Prime Minister Netanyahu is hinting at, at the U.N. VAUSE: Also throw into the mix here, five years ago, Jamal Khashoggi
 
 the writer for the "Washington Post", a Saudi dissident was murdered on the orders of the Saudi Crown Prince. How much of this diplomatic deal is outreach with Israel is being driven by, you know, the kingdom's desire to improve relations that have been frayed by the murder of Khashoggi, and you know, trying to improve its image, if you like? 
 
COOK: I think in an indirect way, it is. I think the broadcast of the prayer service, the very public visits of two Israeli ministers in a row are an effort to demonstrate to the U.S. Congress in particular, that there are benefits to normalization. 
 
Because Israel remains so popular among members of Congress this will rebound to the benefit of the Saudis. It is not a bad bet for the Saudis to make, but there are for some members of Congress, the Saudis remain beyond the pale. 
 
VAUSE: Well, also beyond the pale, it seems for Iran's supreme leader a warning that any Muslim country considering normalizing relations with Israel, quote, "The definitive stance of the Islamic Republic is that the government which prioritize the gamble of normalization with the Zionist regime will incur losses. As the Europeans say, they are betting on a losing horse."
 
He then went on to predict that Israel would be destroyed. 
 
Is this all getting a bit complicated for Iran? It has recently reestablished diplomatic ties with the Saudis. 
 
COOK: Yes. The Supreme Leader was particularly active on Twitter today, with his threats to Israel and warnings to those countries that would normalize relations with Israel. 
 
I think it suggests that the Iranians are quite nervous about this normalization but not just the normalization of Israel but a major defense pact that may be part of any normalization deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia will come with a defense pact between the United States and Saudi Arabia. 
 
The Iranians would like to push the United States out of the Gulf region, a defense pact would mean that the United States is there on a more permanent basis. 
 
VAUSE: Steven, as always, great to have you with us. Thank you. 
 
COOK: Great to be with you. 
 
VAUSE: Well, Riyadh and Tehran have recently reestablished diplomatic ties. It seems tensions clearly remain. 
 
On Monday, a Saudi football team made a last-minute withdrawal from a match being played in Iran protesting over that statue there of Qassam Soleimani (ph), the former commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard's Quds force. He was killed in a U.S. strike in 2020. Saudi Arabia considers him a terrorist; Iran, a martyr. The Saudi team refused to take the field unless the statue was
 
 removed. The Iranian team says it's been there for two years. And was there when the Saudi team practiced the night before. The statue stayed, the Saudis left. 
 
Parents, teachers, coaches and other analysts listen up, experts say shouting, and verbally threatening children can damage them just as much as sexual and physical abuse. 
 
When we come back, we'll talk to the lead author of the new study which will explain why. 
 <br>[01:43:20]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
VAUSE: In the U.S., many parents with young children say it has been difficult to get a hold of the latest COVID-19 vaccine. Just a few weeks ago there was a recommendation that everyone six months and older receive an updated shot. 
 
But parents say barriers cut off at pharmacies, scheduling issues, confusion over whether different vaccine brands can be mixed and matched in the younger children. 
 
Those under 5 are at the highest risk of hospitalization from the coronavirus. Also possible remissions for those younger than 18 have risen five-fold from June to September. 
 
Well, when adults shout and yell at children, it's not only harmful to their development as sexual or physical abuse. According to a new study published in the Journal, child abuse and neglect which is easy (INAUDIBLE) over 100 city area studies. 
 
The study found childhood emotional abuse has increased, while physical and sexual abuse has declined. It also found that verbal abuse can have a lasting effect can often lead to substance abuse, depression anxiety and other mental health issues as children grow older. 
 
Joining us now is the lead author of the study, Professor Shanta Dube who has spent 25 years researching childhood traumatic stress and the long-term impact on mental health and substance abuse. 
 
Thank you for being with us. 
 
SHANTA DUBE, WINGATE UNIVERSITY, MASTER OF PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAM: Thank you, John. it's great to be here. 
 
VAUSE: So right now there are four categories of child abuse -- physical, sexual, neglect, and emotional. Verbal abuse is a sub category of emotional abuse which also includes the silent treatment, withholding affection, gaslighting, criticizing. 
 
But from your research what you found is that verbal abuse can be just as damaging to kids as physical and sexual abuse and should be treated as its own, individual category. So why is that? And what have you found that has made just so powerful the impact that it has on kids? 
 
DUBE: Well, thank you for the question. I -- the study basically has shown that verbal abuse has been a hidden problem. And although it is part of the definition for emotional abuse, it itself is not on the radar, the term childhood verbal abuse. 
 
And so because it's not on the radar, it's not a subtitle of maltreatment, we're missing it. We are not able to prevent it. And what the data is showing is that while physical and sexual abuse still occur amongst children. The prevalence, or if you well, the percent of individuals with the experiencing those forms has declined over time. Whereas emotional abuse, which has increased over time, and has that definition of verbal abuse is on the rise. 
 
VAUSE: Kids say means stuff to kids all the time. It's one thing though to be called stupid, lazy, you're worthless at school or, you know, out on the playground. When it happens at home, the place which is meant to be safe, it can be devastating in that moment and also have long term consequences. 
 
So explain why, you know, kids can say mean things, but when it's a parent or caregiver, it's so much more devastating. 
 
DUBE: Well, it is adult to child. You know, the adult caregiver is that caregiver. Be it a teacher, or a parent, and the child is looking up to that individual, that adult for that safety and nurture. 
 
So when the words and the speech behaviors are dissonant and violent or aggressive and abusive, it can really have a devastating impact on the child immediately. The child feels unloved, abandoned, and then long term into adulthood, we have seen that the impacts can lead to suicidality, depression, anxiety, and even physical health effects such as obesity and high blood pressure. 
 
VAUSE: When it comes to disciplining a child, how important is it to differentiate the act, something that they did wrong, as opposed to categorizing a child. You know, throwing your laptop into the pool was a really stupid thing to do, as opposed to you are really stupid child? 
 <br>[01:49:45]
 
DUBE: Yes. That is a very important distinction, labeling -- so remember, children when they are developing, they're concrete in their thinking. It is black or white. So when we label them as bad or stupid, or call them bad or stupid -- concretely I'm bad, I'm stupid. 
 
So an important -- an important thing to keep in mind is also how children are developing, how they're processing, and how they internalize some of the words that are said to them. 
 
VAUSE: And you touched on this, this does seem to be very prevalent these days, this research from the U.K. based (INAUDIBLE) which came up with the number of 2 in 5 or 41 percent of 11 to 17-yearolds reported childhood verbal abuse. That's a high number. And there was a time when spanking a child was perfectly acceptable,
 
 child abuse was rationalized away as just strong discipline. Those days are pretty much in the rearview mirror for most of us anyway. But does that mean that parenting are now taken out their anger, their frustration on the children not verbally but physically? And there's also been all these changes after the pandemic a lot more time at home, a lot more crowded, a lot more sort of you know, frustration, if you like. 
 
DUBE: It is possible, we need more research on this but it is possible that perhaps the reason we are seeing increases in verbal abuse is because that is, if you will, it's taking the place of physical abuse. 
 
So we are seeing more of that type of behavior from adults towards kids, as compared to a physical abuse. 
 
I just want to state though it's not that physical abuse and sexual abuse don't occur. They still do and we still need to prevent those forms of abuse but what we really need to bring to light is that childhood verbal abuse is on the rise. It's not been on the radar. It's not its own independent maltreatment type and it needs to be recognized because it is a largely hidden problem. 
 
VAUSE: Professor Shanta Dube, thanks so much for being with us. It's a very interesting study, it's a very good point there for every parent and everyone who wants to be a parent. Thanks for being with us. 
 
DUBE: Thank you. 
 
VAUSE: We'll take a short break. When we come back, the unexpected star of Paris Fashion Week. Fake fur. How the (INAUDIBLE) moving around the unique ensemble. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
VAUSE: Back in France, there is debate over how best to deal with an outbreak of bedbugs, it's made it all the way to parliament. 
 
Translation please? 
 
The prime minister came under fire from opposition lawmakers over a rising number of bedbugs, a surge in bedbugs. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: six years on, your action is largely responsible for this explosive situation. The longer you wait, the more out of control the situation becomes. When will you finally ban ineffective chemical products when 90 percent of bedbugs have developed resistance? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So, (INAUDIBLE), why are you exaggerating once again? Why don't you say that a year and a half ago, in March 2022, the inter-ministerial plan to combat bedbugs supported by the ministries ecological transition, housing and health marked the government's attention to this phenomenon and provided the first responses. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[01:55:02]
 
VAUSE: One of those issues which is hard to scratch, the French health minister said there is no reason for widespread panic, and there has been no invasion of bedbugs. 
 
The level of infestation though across France is worse than previous years, but they say it is (INAUDIBLE). 
 
Christian Cowan is in the headlines for a viral moment during Paris Fashion week. But not for the reason you might think, or maybe it is.
 
CNN's Jeanne Moos has the outfit which stole the show.

JEANNE MOOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It gives a whole new meaning to the term ball gown. A star is born at Fashion Week in Paris. Dubbed the Furball. And underneath the furball - 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I had a harness, and it took about 7 people to help me stand up. 
 
MOOS: Getting dress was the easy part that designer Christian Cowan show. Once out on the runway the furball bumped into singer, Sam Smith, who happens to be the designer's boyfriend. 
 
Smith had to nudge the furball away, she proceeded down the runway. 
 
Then bumped into front row spectators. The fake furball had eyeholes, but what could you see? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I could truly only see like shadows of things. 
 
MOOSE: Just before reaching the end of a runway, model Marjan fell over and had to be lifted up. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I had lost my balance because I had carried it for so long. 
 
MOOS: Designer Christian Cowan, wrote on Instagram. She came into Paris Fashion Week like up wrecking ball, quoting Miley Cyrus, the designer had stressed. 
 
So those who call the furball a stunt, the designer's rep says. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Christian enjoys a sense of chaos. 
 
MOOS: And knows how to create buzz. The design house says the furball already has at least one customer wanting to buy it. "How big was the cat that coughed that up," joked a commenter. 
 
At least this ball gown is one size fits most. Jeanne moos, CNN -- New York.
