RYLEE MCNAMARA, BITTEN BY RACOON: It really hurt. 
 
LOGAN MCNAMARA, RYLEE'S MOTHER: I think I just kind of panicked at first. I was more scared than anything.

FREDRICKA WHITFIELD, CNN HOST: Oh, my God. But she was incredibly composed. 
 
So we do want to note that the little girl and her mother will of course need additional rabies shots over the next two weeks. We're glad they're okay for now. 
 
I'm Fredricka Whitfield. Thanks so much for being with me this weekend. 
 
CNN NEWSROOM continues right now with Jim Acosta. 
 <br>[15:00:24] 
 
JIM ACOSTA, CNN HOST: You're live in the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington, and you're looking live right now at the Mauna Loa eruption in Hawaii. Lava is currently spewing into the air. It is a bit more active than what we've been seeing up until this point. 
 
The lava is about two miles from a major highway. It's the world's largest active volcano and it is now becoming Hawaii's newest tourist attraction. Look at these incredible pictures right now. 
 
You can see that from the US Geological Survey, that volcano just spewing lava into the air as we speak. 
 
And joining me now on the phone is the administrator for the Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency, Talmadge Magno. 
 
Talmadge, a lot of people are in awe of this volcano right now, especially since this is the first eruption in nearly 40 years. There were some feelings yesterday, we talked to the Governor of Hawaii about this, that maybe things were simmering down a bit, but this does appear to be a bit more activity than what we've been seeing, I guess, over the last 24 hours. 
 
TALMADGE MAGNO, HAWAII COUNTY CIVIL DEFENSE AGENCY (via phone): Well, as you stated, you know, it has been a spectacle for the residents and the visitors alike. We joke that Hawaii volcanoes are ones that people usually run towards, instead of running away from, but you know, it seems like the effusion rate, the output is pretty constant at the high level and that is always indicative of Mauna Loa. 
 
So, that's why we continue to have our eyes on it, working with USGS 24 hours a day, monitoring what the volcano  is doing, it seems like this fissure three is stabilizing more, that it might become the dominant one less threat than the other fissures would open up. But nevertheless, you know, it is still an active volcano, as you said, the largest in the world, that puts out a lot of lava and we have to monitor it. 
 
ACOSTA: And Has your agency noticed any major changes in this activity in the last few hours? How would you describe the situation? 
 
MAGNO: Well, right now, it is somewhat stable, if you can believe you can have a stable live active eruption. 
 
ACOSTA: Right. 
 
MAGNO: So we are monitoring it. You know, you stated that it's just over two miles from a roadway. It puts it into a position where it is getting a little bit more accessible. 
 
People -- so you know, we have safety issues that we need to be concerned about, for, you know, people going out there, as well as in the impacts to infrastructure such as that highway. 
 
So we know the effusion rate is high. You know, if it picked up any -- to the point where the flow would start to accelerate, you know, then we will have to take some appropriate actions. 
 
ACOSTA: And we know the lava is getting closer to this major highway, which is extremely important. We were talking to Senator Mazie Hirono about this very important highway on the Big Island yesterday. What are the plans if the lava gets too close? 
 
MAGNO: So the State Department of Transportation and Highways folks, they need -- they have period of about six hours to shut down the highway to effect their operations. USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory says that they can give us 48 to 24 hours' notice, so anytime with that. 
 
But as far as mitigation to the use of that highway, we do have two other routes, which serviced the island long before the Daniel K. Inouye Highway was improved. And so those were the main routes around the islands. 
 
So, you know, folks would have to resort back to that. They are State Highways, federally funded highways. So they're adequate for all the traffic that needs to go around the island. 
 
ACOSTA: Right. But as we know, if that major highway is shut down, and you have to use those older routes, it can take a lot longer to get around that island, but in terms of safety, what's the biggest concern right now? 
 
MAGNO: As I said earlier, you know, as it gets closer, more people are inclined to access the active area and so my concern is that there are hazards out. Definitely, the usual chips and falls, the rough terrain. 
 <br>[15:05:08] 
 
MAGNO: The volcanic lava is, you know, over 50 percent silica, so it cuts you like glass, so you've got to fall hazards. Plus, you have the flow front, which ranges from up to 30 feet, I believe. And you know, that continuously moves. So if you're not prepared, you could become inundated by that, possibly burn. There are also gas hazards. 
 
There are other materials that is in the air that could affect your vision, irritation to the skin and stuff. So, there are a lot of hazards that people have to be aware of and be prepared for. 
 
ACOSTA: And I know residents in Hawaii are somewhat accustomed to dealing with this type of thing from time to time. What about residents? Do residents need to, I guess, keep a lookout for this, stay on top of this? 
 
MAGNO: You know, definitely if they're visiting, I mean, going out to the site, everything I just discussed. And we ask -- we've asked them, and we've been doing this public outreach in September, just make sure they are receiving our messages, our daily messages, updates. Go to our website with links, the USGS, HBO, all their products, all their information that they put out specifically for Manau Loa, all of that information is on there. 
 
So receive our burst messages, look at our daily messages and become familiar with the products that USGS puts out on Mauna Loa. 
 
ACOSTA: All right, very good. Talmadge Magno, thank you very much for your time. 
 
Just showing our viewers one more time this remarkable live look right now at Mauna Loa as it is erupting in that volcano, just shooting lava into the air right now. Just a stunning sight. We're going to stay on top of that. If anything develops, we will get more to you. 
 
Now to Georgia, where it is the final countdown to the final election of the 2022 Midterms. Both Senator Raphael Warnock and Herschel Walker are crisscrossing the State of Georgia today before voters head to the polls for the Senate runoff election in that State, although the control of the Senate has already decided, the outcome of Tuesday's election will have a key impact on party representation on committees, and the early numbers show voters are still locked into this race. 
 
CNN's Dianne Gallagher is following the latest from Loganville, Georgia. And I guess, Dianne, you know, I suppose one might have thought that because Democrats are going to have a control of the Senate that Republicans might be lulled into thinking, well, why should I go out and vote, but it sounds as though from what we're hearing, both sides are very motivated to get out there and vote in this contest. DIANNE GALLAGHER, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: That is the truth there,
 
 Jim. 
 
Look, both campaigns are trying to leverage that idea that maybe this isn't coming down to the control of the Senate, but explaining it is still important. Democrats talking about what they could do with 51 senators and Republicans focusing on things like committees and other types of equal representation when it is a 50/50 split. 
 
Now you can hear the Herschel Walker rally behind me just beginning. They are trying to get the people who are attending here in Loganville amped for the candidate. He also has South Carolina Senator Tim Scott and Louisiana Senator John Kennedy coming to try and get the crowd excited. 
 
There are 1.85 million people have already voted here in the State of Georgia, but there are still millions more who have not, and those are the people who both campaigns are focused on this weekend. 
 
At both Warnock events and Walker events, the candidates have been telling the attendees, look, I know you may have already voted or you have a plan to vote, but I need you to call your friends, call your family, call people who might even owe you money and tell them I need you to go and vote. 
 
They've been trying to make as many jokes about it. Herschel Walker often says if you don't have any friends, make some and then make them go vote with you. Knowing that as much as it's a cliche, it might come down to turnout here. 
 
Now, both candidates have sort of determined what their closing message is here. Warnock talking about character issues with his opponent, Herschel Walker, but also talking about the senator's own record in the Senate and what he has accomplished. 
 
Meanwhile, Herschel Walker has been talking about how Warnock and Joe Biden are aligned and trying to make that connection there for voters to inspire them to go out. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
HERSCHEL WALKER (R), GEORGIA SENATE CANDIDATE: He has voted with Joe Biden 96 percent of the time, which he didn't know he has voted with it or he loves that man. 
 
SEN. RAPHAEL WARNOCK (D-GA): He was an amazing running back and he will he those skills because come Tuesday, we're going to send him running back to Texas. We're going to send him running back to where he received his homestead tax exemption. 
 <br>[15:10:09] 
 
GALLAGHER: So Senator Warnock today in Gainesville and Athens, Georgia campaigning. He has maintained this kind of aggressive campaign schedule throughout the runoff. This here at Loganville is Herschel Walker's only public event today.
 
 But tomorrow, Jim, we see the Walker campaign really amp up their campaign schedule with five different events around the State, just showing how crucial those final days really are. 
 
ACOSTA: They are very crucial. All right, Dianne Gallagher, thank you very much. 
 
And joining me now CNN political analyst and White House correspondent for TheGrio, April Ryan; and CNN political commentator, Republican strategist, Alice Stewart. 
 
Alice, how worried are Republicans about this Tuesday? 
 
ALICE STEWART, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: They are concerned, that's why it is really all-hands on deck from now through Tuesday. 
 
We have Senators Tim Scott and also John Kennedy from Louisiana going in there, and they are making the case more about the impetus on this. Of course, Democrats will have control over the Senate, but making this a 50/50 Senate as opposed to a 51/49 Senate, and we have seen Brian Kemp, the very popular Governor making that case that this is crucial for, as Dianne said, making sure we have strong committee assignments as we move forward. 
 
And we're seeing in Herschel Walker's final push, which I think is the right way to go about doing this, making this about policies, making this about the fact that Raphael Warnock is a rubber stamp for Joe Biden, as opposed to what the Warnock campaign is doing, more personal attacks against Herschel Walker. 
 
Look, this is going to be down to the wire and Republicans are cautiously optimistic. This boils down a lot to as we have heard from the very beginning candidate quality. 
 
ACOSTA: Yes. 
 
STEWART: Herschel Walker wasn't the number one choice for many Republicans, but he is the person we have, and I do encourage all of my fellow Georgians and the Georgia Bulldog fans to get out there and support him based on the politics -- 
 
ACOSTA: I see you in the Georgia Bulldog colors there. 
 
STEWART: I am rooting for my Bulldogs, yes, and make this more about the policies as opposed to the personal attacks on the candidate. 
 
ACOSTA: And April, Georgia election official, Gabriel Sterling told CNN, we may not know who won the runoff on Election Day, not that anybody wants to hear that right now, but let's listen to what he had to say. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
GABRIEL STERLING, CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, GEORGIA  SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE: We're preparing for you know, it being a very tight race. I anticipate we may not know on Tuesday night, it just -- it really depends because it's up to the voters, and they are showing up in droves. 
 
One million eight hundred and fifty two thousand is a ridiculous number that no consultant I've talked to, Republican or Democrat or election official thought we'd see that many of this early. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
ACOSTA: April, if the results take a while, could we see another, you know, breeding ground for election deniers and conspiracy theories? What do you think? 
 
APRIL RYAN, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Most definitely, most definitely and they are already there. But you have to remember 1.8 million already in early voting. He said that was a ridiculous number. It's an extraordinary number for several reasons. 
 
The fact that people are fired up, just like Alice said, but when you talk about early elections, about early voting, it tends to be Democrats, but Republicans are prepared to go on election day. 
 
At the end of the day, it may take days, it may take hours, it may take minutes, we don't know. But we do know for sure, people are fired up, not just Georgia, but the nation because of the impact that Georgia has on everything in the Senate. 
 
And not only that, I talked, Jim, to some people in the Civil Rights community, and they said, when it comes to Georgia, they said look, if Herschel Walker gets it, Civil Rights will not be -- it is relevant, they believe as it could be, if Warnock would make it. 
 
They feel that Civil Rights, equity, and inclusion will be a problem for Herschel Walker than it would be for Warnock. 
 
ACOSTA: Gotcha. And Alice, let's turn to some other political news. 
 
Former President Trump -- I'm sure you saw this one on Truth Social -- called for the termination of the Constitution to facilitate either a new election against Joe Biden or an immediate return to office as the "rightful winner." Of course, we all know this is not going to happen, but here are some reactions from Republican members of Congress. So, let's watch. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
REP. DAVID JOYCE (R-OH): Whoever the Republicans tend to pick have fallen behind because that's -- 
 
GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC NEWS: Even if it's Donald Trump, as he has called for suspending the Constitution? 
 
JOYCE: Well, again, I think it's going to be a big field. I don't think Donald Trump is going to clear out the field like he did in '16. 
 
STEPHANOPOULOS: But that's not what I'm asking. I'm asking you if he is the nominee, will you support him? 
 
JOYCE: I will support whoever the Republican nominee is, and I just don't think that at this point, he will be able to get there because I think there's a lot of other good quality candidates out there. 
 
MARGARET BRENNAN, CBS NEWS: All elected leaders swear to uphold the Constitution does. Calling for its suspension -- is that disqualifying for a presidential candidate? 
 
REP. MICHAEL TURNER (R-OH): It is certainly not consistent -- 
 
BRENNAN: You know I am asking a question. 
 
TURNER: I do. It's certainly not consistent with the oath that we all take. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 <br>[15:15:01] 
 
ACOSTA: Now, let me read you how Liz Cheney reacted to all of this: "Donald Trump believes we should terminate all rules, regulations, and articles even those found in the Constitution to overturn the 2020 election. That was his view on January 6, it remains his view today. No honest person can now deny that Trump is an enemy of the Constitution." 
 
Alice, are we really going to see the party get twisted into a pretzel by Trump once again on these kinds of questions. I mean, what do you think? 
 
STEWART: What we are seeing now, there's a choice. You know, back in the "Access Hollywood," Donald Trump was the nominee and crisis after crisis and not smart statement on Trump's behalf, he has been the only choice. Now, we have other choices. Now, he is going against a big field of Republicans in 2024 that are consistent conservatives, they are rational conservatives, they are commonsense conservatives, and they are not as divisive as him. 
 
And I hate to inform the former President, the Constitution does not like a spouse. You can't just get rid of it when it no longer suits your purposes. 
 
The Constitution is here to protect the rights of all Americans. It is not there to change the past election of a self-serving American and he is wrong on this. This is absolutely ludicrous, and I guarantee you Jim, the more you ask conservatives and Republicans about this statement, they will say this is not right, and they are going to separate themselves from these kinds of statements. 
 
ACOSTA: Yes, Alice, the Constitution is not like the buffet at Mar-a- Lago, you can't skip past the items that you don't like. No, I'm sorry, April. 
 
April, let me ask you that. The Constitution is not like the MAR a Lago buffet. You can't just get past the items you don't like, what do you think April? 
 
April, can you hear me? Uh-oh. It looks like we might have lost April's audio there. 
 
But Alice, I mean, this is going to be a problem for the House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy. It's not clear yet whether or not he is going to have the votes to become the next Speaker of the House. He has said he plans to read the entire Constitution from the House floor on the first day of the new Congress, but yet McCarthy has yet to condemn Trump for you know, calling to terminate the Constitution. This is a problem. 
 
STEWART: It is. And look, a lot of people are not going to be proactive and come out and denounce this ludicrous statement, but if asked, I guarantee you, Jim, they are going to make it clear that there is no space in American politics for this. 
 
Kevin McCarthy is in a very tough battle, maybe the battle of his life in terms of trying to get the votes necessary for him to be Speaker, and he is going against other Republicans who are very pro-Trump. So, he has to really thread that needle in terms of standing up for the Constitution and for the American people without poking the bear and poking against the people that are speaking out against him as Speaker. 
 
So I guarantee, if he was asked he would denounce this statement, but he is trying to do what he can to maintain his attempt to get the necessary votes to be Speaker. 
 
ACOSTA: Yes. April, I think we've got you back. Your link is back, I think now. 
 
Trump calling for the termination of the Constitution. I mean, it is extraordinary. I know that he does this from time to time, you know, to try to gin up press coverage for what appears to be a faltering run for the presidency one more time. 
 
But at the same time, you can't ignore what is essentially a threat to the Constitution that he is expressing. 
 
RYAN: Jim, you and I covered the former President of the United States. He factually is known to have broken the rule of law while in office. He is now being investigated by the State of Georgia, State of New York, January 6th and others because he has broken the rule of law. 
 
He is going into this attempt to be the President of the United States again, and his 2024 efforts as a weakened candidate, because of the past, because of all of these investigations. 
 
This is not a surprise. This President is going again to try to win by any means necessary, any way he can. I mean, look at what he did. Once again, let's talk about Georgia. He tried to have the numbers changed in Georgia when it came to the final count of how many people voted. 
 
This is not a surprise. It's just yet again, another news story about Donald Trump trying to win the Oval Office by any means necessary. 
 
Alice is right. You know, there are a lot of Republicans who do not have the stomach for this again, to include Karl Rove who I talked to, Kingmaker for George W. Bush, who said it's time to move on. 
 
ACOSTA: All right, April Ryan, Alice Stewart, thank you very much. April, glad we got you back there. Appreciate it. Thanks so much. 
 
RYAN: Yes, you too. Thanks. 
 
ACOSTA: All right, and be sure to tune in on Tuesday for CNN's Special Coverage of the Georgia runoff between Senator Raphael Warnock and Herschel Walker. That starts Tuesday afternoon at four right here on CNN. 
 <br>[15:20:02] 
 
ACOSTA: Coming up, a massive power outage in North Carolina now being investigated as a criminal occurrence. What the Sheriff there is saying about finding evidence of intentional vandalism at multiple substations. You're live in the CNN NEWSROOM. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
ACOSTA: A massive power outage is still impacting residents in North Carolina after what investigators call an "act of violence." 
 
Our Gloria Pazmino was tracking developments joins me now. Gloria, what's going on? 
 
GLORIA PAZMINO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Jim, a really sort of stunning and even bizarre turn of events here is what we have been learning about this power outage in North Carolina. It is affecting about 40,000 people in Moore County, that is about 90 miles East of a Charlotte and we have been trying to get to the bottom of exactly what happened here. 
 
Outages began to be reported last night around 7:00 PM and we just heard from the local Congressman, Congressman Hudson who posted on Twitter that individuals vandalized at least two substations in Moore County with, "criminal intent" according to the Congressman. 
 <br>[15:25:14] 
 
PAZMINO: Now, we have also heard from the local Sheriff who posted on Facebook saying, that "... once utility companies began investigating the power outages, they found evidence and discovered the evidence indicated intentional vandalism had occurred at multiple sites." 
 
Now, we also got a hold of the local Fire Chief in the area who confirmed to us that those substations that have been damaged did in fact sustain some sort of gunfire damage, that there was some shell casings that were being recovered at the site. 
 
Although the motive behind all of this remains under investigation and remains unclear, local officials confirming to us that it was indeed gunfire, apparently shot at these substations that caused the damage that have now left more than 40,000 customers without power. 
 
The local Fire official also confirming to us that they have seen an increase in emergency calls, and that because the power is out, traffic lights in the area are also failing and that has already led to some car accidents, people who rely on medical equipment such as oxygen have also placed emergency calls. 
 
Local Fire and Police officials trying to provide a local station so that people can charge their devices and their medical equipment. All of this going to be part of a of an investigation. The power unlikely to come back today, Jim. They tell us that the equipment that was damaged is difficult to replace, and this could go on at least until Monday -- Jim. 
 
ACOSTA: All right, Gloria Pazmino, I hope they can get that power restored as quickly as possible. Thank you very much. 
 
Up next, why a Police Chief has now been placed on administrative leave after she was pulled over while riding in a golf cart. We will explain that next. 
 
You are live in the CNN NEWSROOM. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 <br>[15:31:40] 
 
ACOSTA: Tampa's top cop has been placed on administrative leave after she flashed her badge apparently using her status as Police Chief to get out of a traffic stop. She was riding in a golf cart with her husband when this happened. 
 
CNN's Leyla Santiago is following this for us and joins us now. 
 
Leyla, this was all captured on body camera. What did we find out? 
 
LEYLA SANTIAGO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, listen, this entire exchange was pretty short, under two minutes to be exact, but that is what led to Mary O'Connor being placed on administrative leave after this bodycam footage revealed that she was being pulled over, she told the Deputy that she was the Tampa Police Chief and that she was hoping he would let it go. 
 
So in the bodycam footage, you see that a golf cart is being pulled over. O'Connor is in the passenger seat, her husband is driving, and after the Deputy proceeds to explain to them why they were being pulled over, which by the way was because they were driving a golf cart on a public road without the appropriate tags, this happened. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
MARY O'CONNOR, TAMPA POLICE CHIEF: Is your camera on? 
 
POLICE OFFICER: It is. 
 
O'CONNOR: I am the Police Chief in Tampa. POLICE OFFICER: Oh, how are you doing? 
 
O'CONNOR: I'm doing good. 
 
POLICE OFFICER: Okay. 
 
O'CONNOR: I'm hoping that you'll just let us go tonight. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
SANTIAGO: So, she shows her badge. She later gives him her business card and says, "If you ever need anything, give me a call. I'm serious." She has since said that she apologize for having that golf cart on the road without the appropriate tags and says she understands why some folks may think that she handled it in an inappropriate way, but points out that she knew she was being recorded. That's why she asked is if the video was on according to her. 
 
And also says she has called the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office to offer to pay any sort of potential citation related to that traffic stop. But now you have the Mayor chiming in and the Mayor is saying and I quote, let's read this statement together: "We hold everyone accountable no matter their position and this behavior was unacceptable. Chief O'Connor will go through the due process and face appropriate discipline." 
 
There is an investigation that is now ongoing according to the Mayor and in the meantime, O'Connor is on administrative leave -- Jim. 
 
ACOSTA: All right, Leyla, Santiago. Those bodycams, they reveal all sorts of things nowadays. 
 
All right, Leyla, thank you very much. 
 
In Wisconsin, the Waukesha community is gathering for its Annual Christmas Parade today, and there are mixed emotions after last year's tragic event. Six people were killed when a man intentionally drove his SUV into the parade route, 62 people were injured. 
 
This year's event will honor the victims as part of a Peace on Earth theme. 
 
Among those killed were three dancers from a beloved group known as the Milwaukee Dancing Grannies. Two dancing grannies spoke to CNN earlier about the emotional return to the parade. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
JAN KWIATKOWSKI, CO-LEADER, MILWAUKEE DANCING GRANNIES: We have four grannies that survived that are still dancing with the group. A couple have retired and one hasn't returned yet due to injury, so they will actually be leading the parade today, or our lineup today, all four of them will be in front, and then the three of us who are members of the Grannies, but weren't there that day, we will be bringing up the rear with all of our new grannies in between. 
 <br>[15:35:15] 
 
JEAN KRUTSON, CO-LEADER, MILWAUKEE DANCING GRANNIES: It's going to be an emotional day, but it's going to be a much needed day, another day of healing. And, you know, we're going to have sadness, remembrance. We're going to have a lot of joy and a lot of happiness. 
 
Today is our day. It is Waukesha's day to show strength, resilience, courage, healing as we all come together, showing the Waukesha community, the State of Wisconsin, the country and worldwide, that we own the streets of Waukesha.

ACOSTA: All right, and coming up: Is France on its way back-to-back to back World Cup championships? The French, a very strong team, now one step closer to that dream with a decisive win over Poland. The latest on the World Cup next. 
 
You're in live in the CNN NEWSROOM. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 <br>[15:40:16] 
 
ACOSTA: France is now onto the Quarterfinal, one step closer to being back-to-back World Cup champions with a strong three to one win over Poland. The French and their star striker, Kylian Mbappe will face the winner of the England-Senegal game, which is happening right now. 
 
CNN's Patrick Snell joins me now. 
 
Patrick, France, I mean they look like maybe a real contender, a frontrunner here in all of this. They might just repeat. 
 
PATRICK SNELL, CNN WORLD SPORT ANCHOR: They might well do, "alle le bleu," as they say, my best friends, Jim, and France trying to do what only Brazil and Italy have done before them in the history of the World Cup and that is successfully defend their title. So some potential history on the line if France can go on and get the job done and win back-to-back titles. 
 
But they certainly look really good against Poland earlier on Sunday winning by three goals to one to get through to the last state. Special moment here, history in the making for 36-year-old Olivier Giroud, who opened the scoring for the French, his 52nd goal for his country. 
 
Why do we care? Because that puts the AC Milan man now out in front. He is France's all-time leading goal scorer surpassing Thierry Henry. 
 
Now, I do have to talk about the prolific Kylian Mbappe, you mentioned it, Jim, Mbappe, not yet 24 years of age, scoring not once here, but twice in this game. He now has a tournament high five goals in the race for the coveted Golden Boot and with nine-career World Cup goals so far, Mbappe now passing even the great Pele for the most goals scored by a men's player at the World Cup before that age of 24. France through to the last state, and I'll tell you what, Jim, Mbappe
 
 is one huge reason why. 
 
ACOSTA: Yes, he is a force. I mean, when you watch him out on the field, I mean, he is just at another level in this World Cup. 
 
SNELL: Yes, he is so quick. He is so quick as well. 
 
ACOSTA: Yeah, and England taking on Senegal. What's the latest there? 
 
SNELL: Yes, that is looking very, very good. I will be not apologetic here. It is the country, my homeland, my birth country, England looking really good in their quest to try and be crowned World Champions, Jim, for the first time. You have to go all the way back to 1966. They currently lead Senegal, the reigning champions of Africa three nil at this point. 
 
They are well into the second half in that game. Goals so far from Jordan Henderson, Harry Kane. Kane with his first goal of this World Cup and Bukayo Saka a short while ago. England in total control. 
 
And as it stands, Jim, they will have a mouth-watering clash with the French next. 
 
ACOSTA: And in the entire world of sports, I mean, it has been keeping its eye on Pele, the soccer legend. You know, just beloved around the world. How is he doing? What's the latest? 
 
SNELL: Yes, it looked really sort of very discouraging early on Saturday, but then it ended with a message of real hope, I can tell you. 
 
Later on Saturday, those messages of support and encouragement coming in throughout the weekend of the late iconic, sorry -- the 82-year-old icon, late Saturday, those tributes were coming in, and the 82-year- old icon of the sports. This was the encouraging part, Jim, in his statement from late Saturday saying that he is strong, and he has a lot of hope as he continues his treatment for colon cancer. 
 
So great news to get that message of encouragement from Pele, but that update coming after initial reporting in his homeland indicating Pele's health had actually worsened. 
 
Pele, a three-time World Cup winner and considered one of the greatest players of all time adding, "I have a lot of faith in God. And every message of love I receive from you all over the world keeps me full of energy and watch Brazil in the World Cup, too," he added. 
 
Now speaking of Brazil, they play South Korea on Monday and speaking ahead of that match, Brazil's head coach Tite speaking so emotionally with Pele uppermost in everyone's prayers and thoughts at this time.

TITE, BRAZIL'S HEAD COACH (through translator): This is possibly the only person who I actually was shaking when I greeted him. I'm speaking from the bottom of my heart, a very emotional moment for me. I stopped and I started shaking. My hands were sweating. 
 
My heartbeats increased. It was like, "Wow. I'm going to have the opportunity to greet Pele." He is the person who represents the human representation of someone of health -- health. That's all I can give you. It's something that all of us feel as it's a difficult moment. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
SNELL: Yes, really emotional and powerful words there, Jim, from Tite and of course we are wishing Pele all the very best thinking of him and wishing him on root, all being well, a really speedy and powerful recovery. Thinking of his family, too. 
 
Jim, back to you. 
 
ACOSTA: We all are. 
 
All right, Patrick Snell, thank you very much. 
 
Coming up: Lisa Ling shines a spotlight on the abuse and exploitation of big cats in a post Tiger King America. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The cubs are taken from their mothers, sometimes hours after they are born, and these are cubs whose immune systems aren't fully developed.

ACOSTA: In Russia, 2,500 dead endangered seals have washed up on the Caspian Coast. Officials say the seals died from natural causes likely about two weeks ago, but it is unclear what exactly caused their deaths. 
 
Caspian seals had been on the endangered list since 2008. They are the only mammals found in the Caspian Sea. 
 <br>[15:20:10] 
 
ACOSTA: And tonight, Lisa Ling explores the heart of post Tiger King America, where the abuse and exploitation of big cats continues. But a group of passionate female activists or  , as they're called, are working to shut it down. Here's a preview of "This is Life." 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
LISA LING, CNN HOST, "THIS IS LIFE": What's wrong with having baby tiger cubs? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The way that nature works is that tiger cubs should stay with their mothers for up to two years. Well, what we see in the tiger cub encounter industry is the cubs are taken from their mothers, sometimes hours after they are born, and these are cubs whose immune systems aren't fully developed. 
 
LING: It's unhealthy for the cubs and awful for the mothers. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: In the wild, one tiger would maybe give birth six times. But we're seeing tigers in the captive industry bred dozens of times, which is physically exhausting and it is traumatic for them every time their babies are taken from them.

ACOSTA: Joining us ours the host of "This is Life," Lisa Ling. 
 
Hi, Lisa. Tell us more about the so called Tiger Queens. 
 
LING: Well, Jim, as you said in the intro, the "Tiger Kings" series was probably one of the more popular series in the last few years, and it followed a bunch of men behaving badly and abusing horrifically so many animals. 
 
What weren't featured though were the animals themselves, the tigers themselves, and it has been left in many cases to groups of women who have taken on some of these tigers that were rescued from some of these Tiger King facilities, and they are nursing them back to health and providing them with places where they can live out the rest of their lives safely. 
 
Now, there is a school of thought here in America because almost every tiger in this country was born in captivity, that so many tigers species are becoming extinct in the wild, why not produce them in captivity? But I would ask you to think about babies. Right? If a baby were born in a cage or in a prison, one might say, well, at least they're being born. 
 
But think about that baby living out their entire life inside of a cage, never getting to experience what it is like to live in the wild, and this is the issue that is at hand here in America. 
 
ACOSTA: All right, and let us take another look at the show. Let's look at another clip.

LING: Who's this guy up ahead? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is a liliger, it is a made-up species. 
 
LING: What is a liliger? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: His mother would have been a liger and his father would have been a lion. So, some of these animals, they are made up by these breeders that were trying to get around the law, you know. 
 
LING: His breeders thought they could avoid prosecution under the Endangered Species Act by making up a new species. 
 
Oh my gosh, yeah, he definitely doesn't look like an animal I've ever seen before. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No. Thankfully, a few years ago, there was a case and it set precedent. And now all forms of tigers and lions are protected under the Endangered Species Act. So, they're not above the law anymore. 
 
LING: It's just like playing God with animals. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
ACOSTA: So, Lisa, we're talking about creating a new species to evade the law. 
 
LING: Absolutely. And as I just said, yes, it is yet another example of man playing god with animals. I mean, this liliger and even though it had an adorable face, I mean, liligers do not exist in nature. This particular animal had a lion and tiger as the mother and a lion as a father and some sick breeder decided to breed this animal and that was the result. 
 
And again, even though it had a very sweet face, this is not, you know, this is yet another example of man just exercising this dominion over animals. 
 
ACOSTA: Gosh, and just very sad. I can't imagine what that must have been like to be there in person and witnessing all of this. 
 
Thank you very much, Lisa Ling -- shedding a light as always on some very important topics in society. Lisa Ling, thanks so much. 
 
And make sure you watch a brand new back-to-back episode, "This is Life" with Lisa Ling. It's airing tonight at nine and 10 right here on CNN. 
 
We'll be right back. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 <br>[15:59:29] 
 
ACOSTA: Now, to some shocking video of a coyote attacking a toddler in Los Angeles and it was captured on a RING camera, but we want to warn you, this is disturbing video. We should note the child did survive. Watch. 
 
[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS] 
 
ACOSTA: The two-year-old had just gotten home from daycare and was walking from the car when the coyote grabs her. You can see it in this video, and begins dragging her away. Her father quickly reacted after hearing his child screaming. He throws a water bottle at the coyote and the coyote runs away. 
 
The child had blood on her pants and was rushed to the hospital where she received multiple rabies shots. She is now recovering and authorities are working to catch that coyote. Terrifying stuff.
