JIM ACOSTA, CNN HOST: You are live in the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington. 
 
We begin this hour with the rising death toll from the tornado outbreak that has ripped across much of the south and Midwest. Just minutes ago, officials in Illinois confirmed that four more storm- related deaths, the overall death toll over the last 24 hours now jumps to 21 lives lost. 
 
More than 50 tornadoes have been reported in seven states. In the south and the Midwest the state of emergency now blankets much of Arkansas and the National Guard is rolling into devastated communities. There are reports of at least a dozen tornadoes touching down in the state. 
 
These images are of the hard-hit town of Wynne, Arkansas, and that's where we find CNN's Derek Van Dam. 
 
DEREK VAN DAM, AMS METEOROLOGIST: Jim, I was just talking to my crew a moment ago, and the scene behind us reminds us of being on the set of a major blockbuster movie. I mean, just look at what we have with this destruction coming out of Wynne, Arkansas, that is a church steeple that was blown off by this tornado. 
 
Look at the incredible damage in front of that building. Just in front of us here we have electrical poles, light poles, trees completely snapped off. Behind us we've got the Wynne High School. I managed to capture a very powerful moment when a gentleman was walking through the parking lot with an American flag draped over his shoulders, and he told me that he had found it several 100 yards behind this structure, the high school, and it had been blown off of the flagpoles there. 
 
So he wanted to hoist it back up in a sign of unity and in a sign of determination that Wynne, Arkansas, will rebuild. They will stand tall through this devastation. Look at this building behind me, a business. You can see the X's
 
 there. That is from the first responders going to door to door to confirm that there are no people trapped inside and we've got the familiar sounds of a disaster zone. The sounds of chainsaws, the sounds of sirens coming from the ambulances that continue to race by. We have utility trucks that have been moving throughout this area. 
 
You can see the bobcats here. There was larger construction vehicles pushing some of this debris out of the way. This is the scene in Wynne, Arkansas, where the devastating tornado came through this area Friday evening, terrifying residents. It was over before a few moments, but it left this amount of damage in its path. 
 
Jim, back to you. 
 
ACOSTA: All right, Derek Van Dam, thanks for that. 
 
In Little Rock, Arkansas. in the meantime, this is the massive tornado that tore through the city. At least 30 people have been hospitalized with injuries and more than 2,000 homes have been damaged. 
 
And joining us over the phone right now is the mayor of Little Rock, Frank Scott. Jr. 
 
Mayor, thank you very much for joining us. We appreciate it. How is your community doing this afternoon? 
 
MAYOR FRANK SCOTT JR., LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS (via phone): We are still experiencing the devastation of this tornado that went across the western portion of Arkansas state capital city. We think right now close to 2600 structures have been impacted. We have about 50 residents that were transported to the hospital. It's probably a grace of God nobody in Little Rock was killed. All of our efforts right now are focused on rebuilding and recovery. 
 
ACOSTA: And how are the recovery efforts going so far? 
 
SCOTT: I couldn't be more proud of the men and women of Little Rock Police Department, Fire Department, Public Works, our National Guards, Arkansas State Police, countless numbers of churches and non-profit organizations, all on one accord today as we pick up the pieces and rebuild for the future. 
 
ACOSTA: And what was it like being in the middle of this tornado for your community? Have you talked to people? Have they described what it was like? Did you have any observations? 
 
SCOTT: It's unbelievable. Yes. 
 
ACOSTA: Yes. 
 
SCOTT: Definitely it's unbelievable anytime that you see literally vehicles flying across on the air, structures being flattened, rather be neighborhoods, commercial areas, and again just for this happening in the exact time that it did where many people were not at their homes. If they were it would have been a massacre. [16:05:05]
 
ACOSTA: And any idea how many people are displaced at this point, not able to go back to their homes? We're seeing a lot of homes just smashed to pieces. Are there enough shelters? 
 
SCOTT: We have enough shelters. Very prepared. As we said the targeted area within Little Rock, the western portion, many folks are either going to our displacement areas or they're reconnecting with their families. We don't have that exact number right now. But we do know the pathway of the tornado impacted about 2600 structures were residents and workers were living. 
 
ACOSTA: And what are the greatest needs right now for the community? 
 
SCOTT: Right now is one that we stressed had patience as we're working to get power restored across the 30,000 residents. We're focusing on gas leaks to make sure that we maintain the public health and welfare of residents, and as we move through this, we know it's going to have some tough days ahead. But if we continue to stick together, we'll move forward together. 
 
ACOSTA: And, Mayor, I know from covering these kinds of storms the other thing you don't really need right now is for folks to be sort of touring these areas that have been hard hit getting in the way of first responders and emergency crews and construction crews and that kind of thing, right? That's one thing you don't need at this point. 
 
SCOTT: No, absolutely. We definitely shared with residents, the areas that are locked down only allowing the actual resident to live most particular areas to get in, but they're working with our PD because we're making certain, number one, no one does any illegal activity within those homes. Two, make it certain the resident gets a chance to get the things that they need, but we don't need anyone idly standing by taking photos while we're trying to get the work done. 
 
ACOSTA: And there is a lot of work to get done. 
 
Mayor Frank Scott, Jr., thank you very much for your time. All the best to your community. Hope you pull through this quickly. Thanks so much for your time. 
 
SCOTT: Thank you so much. 
 
ACOSTA: All right. We appreciate it. 
 
One of the storm-related deaths came during a crowded concert last night when the roof of the Apollo Theater collapsed in Belvedere, Illinois. One person was killed and 28 others were rushed to the hospital with injuries. 260 people were inside the venue when the roof came crashing down. Just unbelievable destruction there in Illinois. 
 
Former President Donald Trump is expected to make history on Tuesday as he voluntarily surrenders to New York authorities after becoming the first current or former president to be criminally indicted. Trump advisers and his allies say there's no way the former president and longtime New York resident can possibly get a fair trial, that's what they're saying, in the mostly Democratic borough of Manhattan. 
 
CNN's Kristen Holmes joins me from outside Trump's Florida state Mar- a-Lago. 
 
Kristen, what should we expect to hear from Trump's lawyers? Are they going to push for a change of venue here? What do you think? 
 
KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Jim, my colleague Paula Reid and I are hearing that that's not a consideration right now from Trump's legal team. They are waiting to see this indictment, which they are expected to do, when Trump is arraigned on Tuesday. But this is something we do expect to hear from a number of Trump's allies as they continue to talk about how unfair this is to the former president. 
 
And as of course we have noted here for the last two weeks, the former president has painted this as a political witch hunt. He has attacked Alvin Bragg, saying that he is a Democrat, linking him to Joe Biden. He's even gone after the judge who he is expected to appear in front of on Tuesday. He said that that judge, quote, "hates him." 
 
So clearly a narrative that they are spinning and it's not just the former president. It's not even just the former president's team, but this is something we are repeatedly hearing from Republicans. So one thing to keep an eye on is whether or not these allies start picking up on this talking point that it would be unfair for Trump to have a trial, excuse me, in New York. 
 
ACOSTA: All right. Kristen Holmes, thank you very much. We appreciate it. 
 
So what can we expect to see when Donald Trump surrenders to authorities on Tuesday? His first court appearance will certainly be different than that of the average accused criminal and authorities are stepping up security around the Manhattan criminal courthouse. 
 
Our Polo Sandoval is outside the court. 
 
Polo, what are things like where you are right now? And what are we learning? 
 
POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Jim, if anything, we have seen security slowly increase ahead of Tuesday. I mean, take the entrance of 100 Center here in downtown Manhattan, a place that will house the proceedings in a couple of days. You see the officer stationed out front. Walk around the corner you see more officers. 
 
This building has certainly been in a constant state of vigilance to ensure that everything is ready to go for Tuesday when the former president travels here to New York City, makes this way here to downtown Manhattan, and then officially faces those charges. 
 
In terms of security we mentioned the increased police presence. There's also cameras and temporary lights that have been established around the perimeter, not to mention what's happening behind the scenes at the intelligence community is scouring online, making sure that there aren't any potential threats, which we should say. 
 <br>[16:10:03]
 
The mayor of New York and his office saying that at this point, the NYPD has not identified any actual credible threats. But that does not mean that they're going to let their guard down. So those are the security considerations in terms of the major logistics. 
 
What we understand, based on reporting from our colleague John Miller, is that the booking process will certainly be modified because of the nature of the situation here. We expect Donald Trump to come here on Tuesday, surrender to the Manhattan district attorney. He'll be let upstairs the detective squad, will be fingerprinted, go before a magistrate or a judge, and then according to sources, very likely going to be released on appeal bond. 
 
It is a process, Jim, that is very sort of run-of-the-mill, very business as usual for officials here, but given the nature that -- of the proceedings here, and the fact that the defendant is the former president the process will certainly not be normal come Monday. Come Tuesday we'll certainly expect crowds, certainly expect the cameras here -- Jim. 
 
ACOSTA: It will not be normal. That's correct. Polo Sandoval thank you very much. 
 
Joining me now, CNN law enforcement analyst Jonathan Wackrow. 
 
Jonathan, great to see you. You know, we've been saying this over and over again. The arrest of a former U.S. president is unprecedented. And a lot is unprecedented with Donald Trump, of course, and that's an understatement in many ways. But this is going to be something that the American people just haven't seen before, and the Secret Service will be on hand Tuesday, expected to be on hand Tuesday to ensure his safety. 
 
How do you think they're preparing for what will be, you know, a pretty wild day down at the criminal courthouse in Manhattan? 
 
JONATHAN WACKROW, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST: Yes, no, listen, while this hopefully what will not happen, it will be very interesting, but we hope that the crowds -- that there's peaceful protests and nothing gets out of control. But from the Secret Service standpoint, you know, sources have told me, you know, for now a few weeks as they prepared for, you know, Tuesday's event is that, you know, they really want this to be administrative from the point of view of the Secret Service, right? 
 
They want to remain in their primary remit, which is the protection of the former president. And to that point what the Secret Service has not done is they have not asked for any special accommodations within the court in terms of their standard processing. Why? Because the Secret Service is not taking a full coordinating role in the security plan on Tuesday, and I think that's a really important role. 
 
What they want to do is they want to just actually focus on the primary responsibility of getting the former president to the courthouse. Let him do his business before the court and from the courthouse safely, and not have, you know, any incident. They are heavily relying upon the NYPD to provide the primary security coordinating role around the courthouse, and the New York state court officers will be inside and they'll be maintaining in escorting the former president throughout the entire booking and appearance process until they go. 
 
So this is really unique for the Secret Service. Typically, Jim, you've been around them for years. You see them taking the primary role, whether it's an NSSC special, you know, your political events. They control every aspect of the security plan. Here they are not. They are informed by the security plan, but they are not dictating it. They are not leading it, so it really is going to be an interesting day on Tuesday for the Secret Service, and really everyone that's involved to ensure the safety, not only the former president, but the city at large. 
 
ACOSTA: Yes. It's going to be a lot of different jurisdictions and I guess law enforcement organizations banging into one another. Probably not literally, but maybe figuratively on Tuesday. 
 
And, Jonathan, there were reports this week that the district attorney, Alvin Bragg, wanted Trump to surrender himself on Friday. But that the Secret Service said they needed more time to work out the details. You said that that's simply not right. Why do you suppose it is that we're waiting until Tuesday for this to happen? 
 
WACKROW: Well listen, I don't know what the D.A.'s office, what level of planning that they need to prepare. However from the Secret Service standpoint, I mean, you know, trying to push blame upon the Secret Service for any type of delay is really nonsensical. The Secret Service can take any protectee to any place in the world at any moment in time. Provide the level of security. Why? Because that is what they do every single day. 
 
They'd show up every day in that protective mode. They do it. They don't need time to prepare. So the coordination was most likely between the D.A.'s office and the NYPD. Ideally you wouldn't want an arraignment on a Friday, you know, should there be large crowds, you know, that made transcend into any type of civil unrest. You don't want that bleeding into the weekend. 
 <br>[16:15:01]
 
You want to be able to be prepared earlier in the week. You have a law enforcement -- all the law enforcement stakeholders coordinated and able to address any type of issue that rises. 
 
Now to that point, NYPD is focused around the courthouse, but they have a remit citywide and you know, there could be incidents that happened outside of Trump Tower on, you know, Monday evening. There could be things that happen, you know, after the former president departs. So they have the remit of the entire city so they want to make sure that they are prepared. 
 
But to your question again, the Secret Service did not ask for any type of delay. That's just not true. 
 
ACOSTA: And, Jonathan, let me ask you this. If the case moves on to trial, I suppose you'll have a situation where the Secret Service is going to have to be there moving him in and out of the courtroom as this trial progresses. How is that going to be handled by the Secret Service? I mean, they're just going to have to deal with it, I guess. 
 
WACKROW: Yes, well, listen, Jimmy, we're in uncharted territory here, right? We've never had a Secret Service protectee be charged with, you know, a crime like this, so -- but if you take a step back and think about what is the remit of the Secret Service, it's to provide protection of that protectee. And that is not going to change. Their protective methodology, you know, for the former president doesn't change whatsoever. 
 
The way that they have to work out logistics, work with, you know, other law enforcement stakeholders, court officers, court appearances, you know, that's a logistical issue. But from the primary responsibility of protection, it's just another day in their job. I mean, they'll do it, they'll execute it flawlessly. 
 
ACOSTA: All right, Jonathan Wackrow, and I suppose this will be kind of a training run for other potential cases that might go to trial for the former president. 
 
Jonathan Wackrow, thanks so much. We appreciate it. 
 
WACKROW: Thanks, Jim. 
 
ACOSTA: All right, and former President Trump must navigate difficult legal waters ahead. We'll talk about it with January 6th Committee member, Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren. That's next. Plus two victims of the Nashville school shooting are buried today. What needs to change for America to see meaningful gun reform? I'll talk to a familiar survivor. You'll recognize him of the Parkland school shooting. 
 
And later "Wall Street" reporter Evan Gershkovich remains under arrest in Russia, the first American journalist accused of spying since the Cold War. What is being done to help him get released. 
 
You're live in the CNN NEWSROOM. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[16:21:39]
 
ACOSTA: As former President Donald Trump prepares to surrender to authorities in Manhattan next week, a growing chorus of support from prominent Republicans, including Trump's 2016 rival, Jeb Bush, who tweeted that Manhattan D.A. Alvin Bragg's cases is very political, not a matter of justice. Also today, Trump's potential 2024 competitor, Governor Ron DeSantis offered his own blistering take on Bragg at a leadership conference in Pennsylvania. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R), FLORIDA: Now he turns around purely for political purposes and indicts a former president on misdemeanor offenses that they're straining to try to convert into felonies. That is when you know that the law has been weaponized for political purposes. That is when you know that the left is using that to target their political opponents. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ACOSTA: Joining us now with more, Democratic Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren. She was a member of the January 6th Select Committee. 
 
Congresswoman, thanks so much again for being with us. We always appreciate it. What's your reaction to what Governor DeSantis is saying, others are saying in the GOP that this is politically motivated and being weaponized? What's your response to that? 
 
REP. ZOE LOFGREN (D-CA): Well, none of us know what the charges are. I mean, he doesn't know. I don't know. And you don't know. The indictment is sealed until Tuesday. So how they can assert so confidently that there's something defective is kind of a mystery. 
 
You know, we live in a country where we're blessed with a system of laws. Prosecutors are charged with evaluating facts and law and bringing actions without fear or favor in their work, so I think there's a lot of commentary based on no evidence yet. 
 
ACOSTA: And one of the things you saw during your work on the January 6th Committee is a number of prominent Republicans being very critical of former President Trump right after January 6th and then sort of falling in line behind the former president. And I think you're seeing some of that now. 
 
What do you make of so many Republican leaders rallying to Trump's defense right now? Even Jeb Bush, for example. 
 
LOFGREN: Well I think, you know, thinking back, Kevin McCarthy, who is in the majority leader, correctly pointed out that Trump was completely responsible for the riot and attack on the Capitol, as did some other Republicans. Shortly thereafter they started to defend the president. You'd have to ask them why, but it looks to me that it's political obsequiousness. It's catering to his most hardcore -- Mr. Trump's hardcore supporters who are almost unable to come to grips with actual facts when it comes to the ex-president. 
 
I don't know why people are saying what they're doing. All I do know is they have no idea what they're talking about, and I think everybody in the country would be better off if we just stayed calm, take a look at what the indictments actually are. We have a process in this country where if you're charged with a crime, you're entitled to due process. 
 <br>[16:25:04]
 
You're entitled to a presumption of innocence unless you are convicted. And the former president will I hope and believe be entitled to all of those constitutional protections. You know, if this is not a strong case, then he'll win in court. If it is a strong case, I think the people who are suggesting that it's improper will be very embarrassed. 
 
ACOSTA: Do you wish that a January 6th criminal case were going first, as opposed to this case? 
 
LOFGREN: Well, the committee, after examining the facts for a little shy of two years, came to the conclusion that the ex-president, along with many others, had committed criminal offenses. And we referred that matter to the Department of Justice. I don't know where they are in the investigation. Obviously they need to have the facts themselves and be convinced that there's probable cause to indict and in this case is so high profile. 
 
I'm sure they're also looking at whether they have adequate evidence to convict beyond a reasonable doubt. That's the standard. I wish that this had gone quicker over them. I think the country is sort of waiting to see what the decision is. And so -- but on the other hand, their job is not the same as the committee's job. They have to go through their processes. I do think the country would be better off sooner they're able to reach a conclusion. 
 
ACOSTA: And one of your colleagues in the House, Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene is trying to mobilize Trump supporters to demonstrate with her in New York during Tuesday's arraignment. Trump himself warned of death and destruction if he's charged. 
 
Do you worry that this is going to turn ugly on Tuesday? I mean, you've investigated him. Is that what Trump wants? 
 
LOFGREN: Well, you'd have to ask him, of course, but the kind of rhetoric he's using is similar actually even more blatant than what he used in the run-up to January 6th. It's very clear that he left with no other possibility. He resorted to the mob on January 6th. I would hope that that would not occur. I mean, my colleague Miss Greene was one of the members who went to the D.C. jail, claiming that individuals, rioters who pled guilty to felonious assault on police officers, were somehow patriots. So I think we need to put her activities in perspective. 
 
ACOSTA: All right, Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren, thanks as always. We appreciate it. 
 
LOFGREN: Thank you. 
 
ACOSTA: All right. A somber day in Nashville today as families and friends said their final farewells to two of the victims of this week's school shooting. We'll take you there live and take a closer look at the struggle for gun reform in America. 
 
You're live in the CNN NEWSROOM. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[16:32:19]
 
ACOSTA: In Nashville, funeral services are wrapping up for two of the victims killed in this week's mass shooting at a private elementary school. 
 
And 61-year-old Cynthia Peak was a substitute teacher at the school. And the family of 9-year-old Halle Scruggs says she had a love for life and an active spirit. 
 
CNN's Dianne Gallagher is live in Nashville. 
 
Dianne, this is just, just heartbreaking. It's just totally heartbreaking. How is the community remembering these victims? 
 
DIANNE GALLAGHER, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Heartbreaking is the right word there, Jim. Right now, the funeral of Halle Scruggs, just 9-years-old, killed in her school, is wrapping up.
 
Now we've been asked. Of course, it is a private funeral for the Covenant Presbyterian Church, the Covenant school family and Halle Scruggs family. Her father is the pastor of Covenant Presbyterian Church. 
 
That school is in the same place where she died, at the church for her funeral is being held today. 
 
The funeral for Cynthia was held earlier - Cynthia Peak was held earlier today. Her friends called her Cindy. 
 
She was close friends with the first lady of Tennessee, Maria Lee, and the governor himself. She was actually supposed to have dinner with the governor and his wife that night. 
 
A state representative from Louisiana said that Cindy was his childhood friend, that she was a good friend. 
 
And her entire hometown of Leesville, Louisiana, is currently in mourning. She was a substitute teacher at the school that day. 
 
Jim, the funerals for the remaining three victims will continue into the middle of next week. 
 
Of course, 9-year-old Evelyn Dickhouse (ph) had her funeral yesterday, the first of the six victims. 
 
They asked mourners to wear spring colors for that 9-year-old's funeral as they mourned her. 
 
ACOSTA: All right. Diane Gallagher, thank you very much. 
 
While families and friends are saying their final farewells to three 9-year-olds and three staff members after the Nashville school's mass shooting, many House Republicans are repeating some familiar claims: 
 
Gun laws don't work. They say there's nothing we can do to stop mass shootings, they've been saying. And they continue pushing to keep assault style weapons legal. Some Republican House members wore these pins earlier this year, handed out by Georgia Republican Congressman Andrew Clyde. 
 
In this tweet, you can see Clyde holding one of the pins. Clyde owns a gun store that sells A.R.-15s and weapons like that. 
 
There have been 131, mass shooting so far this year, and it's only April. And get this - since the Parkland school shooting five years ago, there have been 2,800 mass shootings. 
 
Parkland survivor and gun reform advocate, David Hogg, joins us now. 
 
David, I know we've spoken several times before. These numbers don't get any less astonishing. 
 <br>[16:35:03]
 
If those numbers won't move the lawmakers to do something, what will, do you think? 
 
DAVID HOGG, PARKLAND SHOOTING SURVIVOR &amp; GUN REFORM ADVOCATE: We have to. We have to move the lawmakers to do something. 
 
Look, as Americans, we all agree that our kids should be able to be safe at school and in their communities on a daily basis. 
 
The problem is that lawmakers like the ones that you just mentioned are getting in the way. 
 
They want us to believe that we can't solve this problem. Because they know that, if we did, if Americans stood up together against gun violence, against these small group of oligarchs essentially that are the merchants of death, that are stopping us from being able to address this issue, that gun sales would plummet.
 
Because Americans would choose to fight together against this violence and fight each other. 
 
We would also know that those people couldn't remain in power anymore. Parents had no tolerance for politicians that say that we can't do anything to address this. 
 
Screw that. We can do something to address this. And if they don't change gun laws, we need to change using government. 
 
So this is a call to all Americans to unite against gun violence. 
 
We are going to keep being in this cycle until we start turning out and voting and demanding that every single state implement Massachusetts-style state gun laws. 
 
If every state had the same gun death rate at Massachusetts, we could cut gun deaths by 70 percent Jim. This is not theoretical. This is a reality. And that's why, this Tuesday, at Harvard, and, hopefully, college
 
 campuses across the country, students are rallying on this Tuesday, to demand stronger gun laws to demand action on this, to change those that are in power, through our votes. 
 
ACOSTA: OK. But - and, David, to the point you were just making, I'm sure you saw this. Tennessee Republican Congressman Tim Burchett. He had this to say in response to the Nashville shooting. Let's watch it and I'll get your reaction. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
REP. TIM BURCHETT (R-TN): Do you think Washington is going to fix this problem? You're wrong. They're not going to fix this problem. They are the problem. The laws don't work. Until people change their hearts, we're not going to see a change. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
ACOSTA: What did you think when you saw that? 
 
HOGG: That we need to get these people out of office right now. We need to get out and voting. And we need to run people against them. 
 
And on top of that, there is a kernel of truth in what he said. This is not going to change in Congress in the first place. This is going to have to come from our state legislatures.
 
Young people, old people, people all ages need to show up every single year. Not just after a Parkland, not just after Nashville or Uvalde. But show up before the next Parkland or Nashville at your state legislature every single year.
 
And be just as angry as the gun extremists are. That's the birth of the majority will of the American people that say that we want our kids to be protected and safe at schools.
 
Because when we don't show up, those people do show up, and they win. We need to keep showing up for our kids. 
 
We need every state to implement Massachusetts state gun lies. And we need to keep fighting until every child has to live in fear of gun violence. 
 
So if you're a college student or anybody of any age, rally with us this Tuesday. If you're around Boston, we're doing it in Harvey Gardens. And if you're a college student, you can launch your own at your own school. 
 
This is not going to change until we make the people in power uncomfortable.
 
After Parkland, my last point, is that people said that we couldn't change gun laws because we're just a group of teenagers and its Republican state legislature. Guess what? They did change gun laws. The laws that we've used that have been changed since Parkland, help
 
 stop me from having to bury my very own mother. Somebody sent a death threat to my mom that said - I can't say it's on TV - but blank with the NRA and you will be DOA. 
 
We used a law that we passed after Parkland to disarm that individual. That same law has been used more than 9,000 times in Florida.
 
So screw anybody that says these gun laws don't work. They do. 
 
We need people to join us. Rally on your college campuses around the country, registered voters. And we need people, all ages, students, professors and others to show up and demand action on this issue. 
 
You can text Join 95495. Once again, that's Join 954954 to get mobilized with us and be notified with what's going on in your community. We have to act now and keep acting every single year. 
 
ACOSTA: Yes. Yes, indeed. 
 
But, David, what can you do in terms of countering the messaging that you're seeing from some Republican lawmakers, who seemed to flaunt this fascination with guns, especially high-powered rifles? You see them posting posing with them on social media. 
 
The Republican congressman who represents Nashville, where this week school shooting happened, tweeted this image of his family holding rifles as a Christmas card in 2021. 
 
He's not the only Republican sending out photos like this. Republican Congressman Thomas Massey of Kentucky did the same thing. 
 
I guess - and the other question that I have, David, is, how is some of this imagery received by people who have either survived mass shootings or the loved ones of victims who did not? 
 
I have to think that you've spoken with fellow survivors or family members of victims who see these kinds of Christmas cards and, you know, politicians putting out videos of them firing these kinds of weapons and that sort of thing, showing them off. 
 
It must have an effect on some of these families. 
 <br>[16:39:59]
 
It does. And you know, one thing that didn't make it in the news is, just this past week, I was in D.C. with Joaquin Oliver's father and mom. 
 
Representative Maxwell Frost, former member and national organizing director, Mark Burlight (ph), of March for Our Lives, was introducing his first piece of gun violence prevention legislation. 
 
Manny was going, watching his dad. Manuel Oliver was going around Congress and giving the same type of pin to different members of Congress. But that had an "X" through it considered that they supported the assault weapons. 
 
Then we have over 200 co-sponsors in the assault weapons ban in the House right now.
 
And I want to remind you that, last year, Congress, specifically the House of Representatives and Democrats, voted to ban assault weapons. The thing that stopped us from going through the Senate was 10 Republicans in the first place that stopped that from happening. 
 
They are acting on this issue. And young people are turning out and making a difference on this. 
 
It's awful to see these politicians practicing unsafe, you know, practices with their guns. 
 
You know, I grew up around guns. That my dad was an FBI agent. The only time as a child that we ever had guns out in our House was either when you are going to the range or they were being cleaned. 
 
We never, ever, ever understand as a photo op. Because we know that these are not toys. These are tools that are made to kill. 
 
And you don't take them out unless your life is in danger, or you're going to the range or cleaning it. That's it. It's ridiculous and unsafe. 
 
And we need to realize that they don't speak for the majority of Donald that are responsible that don't use guns for photo ops that used them for things like hunting and going to the range. 
 
But ultimately, that's not going to change until we start demanding the same way that a lot of these people are demanding to protect their guns that we protect our kids. 
 
We need to show up every single year. And I need people to join us on college campuses, especially if we got called students around the country, and people of those alumni have those colleges and professors and people of all ages to join us together to demand for gun laws on the campuses, to register voters. 
 
This upcoming Tuesday, we could completely start to change this issue and the narrative that there is nothing that we can do. Because there is something that we can do. 
 
And you know why? Because every other high-income country does not have school shootings like yes. And we don't have to be that way. We can do something about this. 
 
You can't let the NRA Republicans tell us that we can't. Let's show them. And let's turn out the vote in the Demand Act. 
 
ACOSTA: All right, David Hogg, good to see you as always. Thanks so much. Good luck with your efforts. We appreciate it. 
 
We'll be right back. 
 
HOGG: Thank you.

ACOSTA: Donald Trump says being indicted by a grand jury in New York will actually help him in the presidential race. But what do the polls show? 
 
CNN senior data reporter, Harry Enten, joins us now to run the numbers. 
 
Harry, is that right? Let's start with what people think about the allegations against the former president. What are you seeing? 
 
HARRY ENTEN, CNN SENIOR DATA REPORTER: Yes, so you know when it comes to New York and the, you know, obviously the allegations and now indictment, we have a poll that was taken just before the indictment. 
 
And what does it show? Among Republicans, 78 percent say the allegations are not at all not too serious. And the vast majority look at that. And 93 percent say the case is mainly motivated by politics. 
 
So I'm not thinking, at least in the initial run, that at least the case in New York is going to have much of an impact on his standing among Republicans. 
 
ACOSTA: And there are other potential cases, as we know, against Trump revolving around his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. What are you seeing with that polling? 
 
ENTEN: Yes, so, you know, obviously, there are other potential cases that are out there regarding the president's 2020 election. 
 
What do we see? We see that just 7 percent of Republicans believe he committed a crime trying to overturn the election and more than that they believe he was righteous in his efforts to try and overturn the election. 
 
Because - get this - 55 percent say he only lost due to voter fraud. So you know, when you combine that New York case with those potential other cases, I don't see how it really hurts him among Republicans. It may in fact, help him. 
 
ACOSTA: Let's talk about that. We've been talking about Republicans. How big of a divider we're seeing between Republicans and the general electorate when it comes to these investigations into Trump? How about Independents? What do we think? 
 
ENTEN: Yes. Yes. I mean, there's just a huge divide, right? You know, Maris had this great question, do you believe that these investigations are fair or are they witch hunt? 
 
Look at that, among all voters, 55 percent say their fair. Just 43 percent say that they believe they're a witch hunt. Look among Republican voters, on the other hand, 18 percent say their fair, 80 percent say that they are a witch hunt. The vast majority believed there are witch hunt.
 
And I just want to go forward and look at the polling in terms of the elections, right? The primary and the general election because I think you see that vast divide there as well. 
 
Look at that. Among Republicans and the GOP primary, Trump is leading Ron DeSantis by 16 points. So it works for him in the primary. But look in the general election. Joe Biden's up by three points. 
 
So what may work among the primary electorate doesn't necessarily work among the general electorate. These charges against Trump may work for him in the primary. But among the general electorate, there's a far more skeptical crowd. 
 
And I think Democrats, for this particular reason, say, bring on these indictments are this particular indictment. Because I think it probably doesn't hurt, does not help Trump at least in terms of the general electorate - Jim? 
 
ACOSTA: Right, That's the questionm who voted against Trump the last time around, who's going to vote for him because of these cases? I mean, that - that is one of the big questions hanging over him. 
 
As always, Harry Enten, thanks so much. We appreciate it.
 
ENTEN: Thank you.

ACOSTA: As March gives way to April, the men's basketball tournament reaches the game's biggest stage yet. The Final Four fans have been waiting for tonight's games in Houston all year long. 
 
And so has our very own Coy Wire. 
 
Coy, I know the atmosphere has to be electric where you are right now. And the tip off is just a little while from now. What can you tell us? 
 
COY WIRE, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR: Yes, they're getting ready for the buzzer beaters and the high-flying drama. We're here at the tip off tailgate, Jim. Wish you were here with me. 
 
We're just outside of NRG Stadium. That's where the NFL's Houston Texans play their game. But that's how big March Madness is. They have to put a basketball court on a football field.
 
Now one of the best things about Final Four are the fans. And we're getting to meet some of them here. You're going to have Yukon, they're the only team that's ever been in
 
 the Final Four before. The other three teams, first time ever. And Florida Atlantic, San Diego State will be the first ones to tip off tonight. 
 
We caught up with some of the Owls and Aztecs fans just a bit ago. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 <br>[16:54:55]
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: March Madness is so special. FBU has never made it this far. We believe in our school. And it's our moment, baby. 
 
(SHOUTING)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Pretty much went from San Diego to Houston, an 18- hour drive, but you know, long drive. We do have the SEC as such. Let's go. Tex, baby. 
 
(CHEERING)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Florida, FAU, FAU, FAU, FAU.
 
WIRE: All right, how about those Texas Texans? 
 
(CHEERING)
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WIRE: Fandomnium Pandemonium, Jim. A nearly 1,500-mile drive all the way from San Diego State for some of those Aztecs fans.
 
(CHEERING)
 
WIRE: - to get here, more of them. They're everywhere. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's a really special moment. Lifetime opportunity, lifetime opportunity for most of the student athletes. Huge moment for the players and universities. 
 
Millions of people tuning in. There were thousands of fans just in the practice yesterday, Jim. 
 
It may be the wildest men's Final Four ever. But for the first time, there is not a one, two or three seeds in the men's national semifinal.
 
After tonight, we'll find out who will be dancing their way into the final - Jim? 
 
ACOSTA: Coy, my bracket is a shambles. I don't even want to put - I don't even want to tell the American people where I had these teams in the Final Four, whose teams I had in the Final Four because it's just embarrassing. 
 
But, Coy, I'm sure I'm not alone in that category. 
 
Thanks so much. We look forward to tonight. Appreciate it. 
 
Severe weather is slamming several states this afternoon. The latest on what's happening now. And on the recovery from last night's powerful storms. That's coming up.
