RICHARD QUEST, CNN ANCHOR: From London, this is the CNN NEWSROOM, I'm Richard Quest, and these are the stories that you need to know. 
 
The suspect in the deadly car attack at a Christmas market in Germany had a history of troubling social media posts. A 50-year-old from Saudi Arabia earlier this year made threats against Germany and the German people, posting about renouncing his Islamic faith and accusing Germany of promoting the Islamization of the country.
 
Police in New York have arrested a suspect accused of killing a female subway passenger by setting her on fire. Authorities do not believe the two knew each other and say they didn't interact before the attack. 
 
At a speech to conservative activists in Arizona, President-elect Trump has pushed back on attacks from Democrats who have referred to Elon Musk as President Musk.
 
Donald Trump said he would consider retaking control of the Panama Canal. Panama's presidents responded, saying the independence of his country is not negotiable. 
 
Donald Trump's pick for border czar also fired up the crowd at that same conservative conference. He pushed for an aggressive crackdown on immigration. Now, it appears Tom Homan's plans is to go into sanctuary cities and prosecute anyone hiding undocumented migrants from law enforcement. He says illegal immigrants who have committed crimes will be the priority, but they won't be the only ones that the agents are looking to arrest.

TOM HOMAN, DONALD TRUMP'S PICK FOR BORDER CZAR: So I'll send a whole bunch of agents into your community and we'll find the bad guy. And when we find the bad guy, he's probably going to be with others, others that aren't a priority apprehension. But guess what? They're getting arrested, too. So you'll get exactly what you don't want, more arrests in your communities. 
 
I don't want to do that. I'd much rather be safe with the agents arrest the guy in the county jail, but they don't let us in. Fine. You're not going to stop us. We'll go to the community and we will find him. You're not going to stop us. Put all the roadblocks up, roadblocks you want. It's not going to work. We're going to do this.

QUEST: Now, Mr. Trump's former pick for the U.S. Attorney General, Matt Gaetz, claims that his bid for the job was thwarted by anti-Trump forces in the Senate. And now, sources are saying a House Ethics Committee report on Gaetz's conduct is expected to be released in the coming hours. CNN's Brian Abel has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BRIAN ABEL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It was earlier this week when we learned that the House Ethics Committee had a secret vote to release its report into the conduct of former Rep. Matt Gaetz. And now we know when, multiple sources telling CNN the report will be released Monday. The release is a stark reversal by the committee, which just last month voted to shelve the report after Gaetz resigned from Congress once he became president-elect Donald Trump's pick for Attorney General.
 
Gaetz withdrew himself from consideration of that role after Trump called him to say Gaetz didn't have the votes in the Senate to get confirmed. This report concludes a years-long probe by the Ethics Committee into numerous allegations against Gaetz, including whether he engaged in sexual misconduct with a minor, whether he paid for sex, used illicit drugs, shared inappropriate images or videos on the House floor, and more. 
 
Gaetz has strongly denied all of the allegations and has said the committee's investigation is a witch hunt, saying this on X after reports of the committee's decision to release this report.
 
He said, quote, The Biden-Garland DOJ spent years reviewing allegations that I committed various crimes. I was charged with nothing, fully exonerated. 
 
The Post went on to say, It's embarrassing, though not criminal, that I probably partied, womanized, drank and smoked more than I should have earlier in life. I live a different life now. 
 
We should note that it is rare for an ethics report to be released after a member has left Congress, though it has happened on a couple of occasions in the past.
 
Gaetz has said he has no plans of returning to the House next year. As a result, House Speaker Mike Johnson called the report a moot point and advocated for it to not be released. But here's what Gaetz said Sunday at a conservative conference.
 
MATT GAETZ, DONALD TRUMP'S FORMER PICK FOR U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: And some of you throughout this conference have even given me a few suggestions. My fellow Floridians have asked me to eye the governor's mansion in Tallahassee. Maybe special counsel to go after the insider trading for my former colleagues in Congress. It seems I may not have had enough support in the United States Senate. Maybe I'll just run for Marco Rubio's vacant seat in the United States Senate and join some of those folks.
 
ABEL: Rubio's seat is vacant after being picked to be Trump's secretary of state. And the exact timing of when this ethics report will be released Monday is still unknown.

QUEST: Several members of the same family have been killed in an Israeli airstrike in central Gaza on Saturday, according to the hospital, who says at least 11 people died when the house was targeted. We've reached out for comment from Israel's military. 
 
Now, overall, Gaza's health ministry is saying more than 45,000 Palestinians have been killed since Israel's offensive started last year. We can't independently confirm that number. 
 
The humanitarian crisis across Gaza is worsening, with food prices rising dramatically. These are the video of the chaos at an NGO facility in central Gaza. People are pushing their way just to get a meal. One woman said she was there to get food for her children. She said the situation would be unbearable without such assistance.
 
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is speaking out after Houthi rebels fired a missile at Tel Aviv this weekend. According to Israeli military, several attempts to shoot it down failed. The prime minister says Israeli forces will continue to target Houthis in Yemen in the same way they've dealt with other Iranian proxies.
 
The U.S. has launched a series of strikes against Houthis, part of an ongoing effort to shut them down and their military operations in the region.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): As we acted forcefully against the terror arms of Iran's evil axis, so we will act against the Houthis. Only in this case we are not acting alone. The U.S. and other countries see the Houthis as a threat not only to international shipping, but to the international order.
 
Therefore, we will act forcefully with determination and sophistication. I tell you, even if it takes time, the result will be the same result as against the other terror arms.

QUEST: Jordan's foreign minister is in Damascus, where he's conducting extensive negotiations and discussions with the country's de facto leader. This is according to reporting by Jordanian state television. Ahmad al-Sharaa, also known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, led the group of rebels that ousted the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, earlier this month.
 
He held a news conference with Turkey's foreign minister in Damascus on Sunday. Apparently, they said all weapons in the country will now be controlled by the state.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
AHMAD AL-SHARAA, SYRIAN DE FACTO LEADER (through translator): We will not by any means allow for arms outside the control of the state, whether from revolutionary factions or factions in the SDF areas. We need to close this chapter as quickly as possible, because the presence of rogue arms in the country is what leads to chaos and unstable security.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
QUEST: President-elect Trump has said the U.S. should not get involved in the situation in Syria. He wrote, when it all happened: This is not our fight, let it play out. 
 
But what does that mean? After all, I spoke to Jasmine El-Gamal, a former Middle East advisor at the Pentagon, and she says it won't be that easy for Donald Trump to just ignore what's unfolding there.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JASMINE EL-GAMAL, FORMER PENTAGON MIDDLE EAST ADVISER: This is one of the things that we've seen time and again with U.S. administrations saying this is not our fight, we need to get out of the Middle East, the Middle East is quiet, and yet time and again they end up being dragged back in, because actually what happens in the Middle East does affect U.S. interests, and it does affect U.S. allies. 
 
So Donald Trump may very well want to stay out of this, but the fact is, at the very least, at a bare minimum, we have 40,000 ISIS fighters, women, and children who are in Syria. There's a U.S. counter-ISIS mission in the northeast of the country, and they're going to be looking at that situation and trying to figure out how do you make it so that these ISIS fighters don't pose a threat to U.S. interests and allies, and that's just at a bare minimum.
 
QUEST: Right, but you see, this is the difficulty. That is the lowest thread, if you like, the lowest bar, ensure that things don't get worse. But is there an opportunity here?
 
Because it seems as if the leaders are saying, look, we want an Islamic sort of state, but nothing like Afghanistan. We want to be accepted by you. Give us a bit of room to breathe, and we can all get on.
 
Or am I just being naive?
 
EL-GAMAL: No, you're not being naive at all. I mean, absolutely, the leader of HTS, which is now the de facto ruler, basically the transitional government, if you will, in Damascus, they have been saying all the right things, all the things that international actors, European countries, the U.S., regional countries have been wanting to hear from them. 
 
They're talking about respect for minorities. They're talking about not wanting to fight with their neighbors. They're talking about Syrians rebuilding Syria for Syrians. 
 <br>[04:40:00] 
 
We've seen a long list of foreign dignitaries going into Damascus, having meetings with Ahmad al-Sharaa, as you said, who was formerly known by his nom de guerre, Abu al-Golani.
 
And so you're seeing -- what you're seeing is something that analysts, that foreign actors have long wanted to see out of the Middle East, which is someone actually saying pragmatic things that are in line with what the international community wants.

QUEST (on camera): As the Catholic Church prepares for Christmas, along with the rest of us, by the way, we're going to take you inside St. Peter's Basilica, where you will see how everything is getting ready, not only for Christmas, but also for the mass influx of Jubilee pilgrims, which takes place next year.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
QUEST: Christmas is just around the corner. I'm sorry. Whether you're ready or not, it's coming. And 119 million Americans are expected to travel throughout the holidays. The flights across the U.S. are on time at the moment. Minimal delays.
 
Though some weather systems are likely to complicate travel heading into Monday. There are two storms to tell you about forming off the West Coast. They're threatening to dump rain across the Pacific Northwest and parts of California. Some areas of the Sierras and southern Cascades could get more than two feet of snow. 
 
And the clipper storm moving across the Great Lakes is forecast to carry heavy snowfall into the mountains across New England as well. Add in thunderstorms over eastern Texas. They're likely to worsen into Tuesday. 
 
A problem with the Colorado ski lift left 174 people stranded on Saturday. It was the gondola lift at the Winter Park. It stopped automatically when it detected a crack in the seat of the lift. That's just what you want to hear, isn't it? 
 <br>[04:45:00]
 
You can see in this video how people got back onto the ground.
 
Members of the ski patrol spent five hours using ropes to bring people down safely. State regulators and the lift's manufacturers are investigating what caused the crack. 
 
Every 25 years, the Catholic Church celebrates a jubilee. The next one begins on Tuesday, Christmas Eve. As part of the event, the Vatican's taking special steps to greet pilgrims. CNN's Christopher Lamb takes us inside St. Peter's Basilica with an exclusive look.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHRISTOPHER LAMB, CNN VATICAN CORRESPONDENT: I'm here at St. Peter's Basilica, the home of the Pope, the site of the tomb of St. Peter and one of the Catholic Church's holiest sites. A huge amount of work has been going on to prepare for an influx of millions of visitors expected to be in Rome during the jubilee year. 
 
Now, we've been granted special access to go inside the basilica and show you what's been going on.
 
FATHER ENZO FORTUNATO, DIRECTOR OF COMMUNICATION, ST. PETER'S BASILICA: Hello. Hello Christopher. Welcome to Rome.
 
LAMB: Oh, thank you very much. 
 
FORTUNATO: To the Vatican, in this case. 
 
LAMB: Wow.
 
FORTUNATO: Yes, it's wonderful. The biggest church in the world. Now we are near the holy door.
 
LAMB (voice-over): The opening of this holy door by the pope on Christmas Eve will mark the beginning of the jubilee, a time of celebration and pilgrimage that usually occurs every 25 years. With its cement seal removed and keys retrieved, the door is now ready to be opened for 2025, which will allow pilgrims to pass through and receive forgiveness for their sins, known as an indulgence.
 
FORTUNATO: After this moment, the pilgrim encounter the Mother of God, the Masterpiece of Michelangelo.
 
LAMB (voice-over): The Pieta, which was attacked in 1972, has had its protective glass upgraded for the jubilee.
 
FORTUNATO: And this is the walk of the pilgrim. 
 
LAMB: OK, the pilgrim's path here. 
 
FORTUNATO: Yes.
 
LAMB: Wow.
 
FORTUNATO: In front of us, the Bar the King of Bernini. This altar is the center of the Eucharistic celebration, but also it's very important because there is the tomb of St. Peter. 
 
LAMB: Can we see that now?
 
FORTUNATO: Yes.
 
LAMB (voice-over): Access to the tomb of St Peter, the church's first pope, is usually only possible with special permission. But as part of Jubilee plans to boost engagement, it and the Holy Door will be viewable via webcam live streams. 
 
FORTUNATO: This is the devotion of every pilgrim.
 
LAMB (voice-over): St. Peter's has also launched a new magazine and even partnered with Microsoft to create an AI-generated digital twin of the basilica that allows pilgrims who can't be there in person and others to explore every detail. Which could be useful, as the work to maintain St. Peter's is ongoing. A special structure has been set up to restore its ceiling using techniques from the Renaissance period.
 
FORTUNATO: Now we are in front of the monument of Bernini. Inside there is the oldest chair of St. Peter. That symbolizes the Holy Spirit in the church. The Holy Spirit leads the church.
 
LAMB: Yes, it's not just a museum church, it's a living church. 
 
FORTUNATO: No, no, yes, yes. 
 
LAMB (voice-over): A living church that's now ready to welcome pilgrims from around the world in person and remotely for the Jubilee.

QUEST: Now, staying in Rome, and get the coins ready, the AP says Rome's Trevi Fountain has reopened after a deep cleaning that took more than two months to complete. It was drained, removed dirt and residue ahead of that Vatican Jubilee. 32 million people expected next year, and now you can throw your coins into the real fountain again instead of a temporary pool.
 
You know the old rule, they're saying if you toss a coin into a fountain, you're guaranteed to return to Rome, which is certainly true. I've tossed many a coin into a fountain over the years. You just toss them in, and I'm having a go at one of them.
 
And by the way, also under the new Trevi Fountain rules, there will be a limit on the number of people -- 400 people an hour. That was a picture I took some years ago showing how the overcrowding exists.
 
400 people an hour on a ticketed basis. You'll buy your ticket, and it's said to be a much more pleasant experience than that. 
 
Two golfing legends are proud poppers after their sons accomplished the same remarkable feat in a moment.
 <br>[04:50:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) QUEST: The NFL, it was a primetime matchup with the playoff implications on Sunday night football. The Dallas Cowboys fought off the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' comeback bid in a close win at home, 26-24. With the Tampa Bay's loss, the Atlanta Falcons are now in first place in the NFC's South Division after a victory earlier in the day. But the Bucs remain in playoff contention. 
 
Two golf superstars, Tiger Woods and Padraig Harrington, have had incredible moments in their careers, though nothing will have been more special than seeing their sons both hit holes-in-one at the same event on Sunday. Patrick Snell reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PATRICK SNELL, CNN WORLD SPORT: Now, in the sport of golf, the chances of making a hole-in-one are about 1 in 12,500, would you believe. Now, for pro golfers, that number dropping to about 3,000 to 1, this according to the PGA of America. But the odds of not one but two pro golfers' sons making aces within less than 10 minutes of each other, unimaginable.
 
But that's what actually happened Sunday in the final round of the PNC Championship in Orlando, a two-person family team event. Tiger Woods and son Charlie were leading at this point. Fifteen-year-old Charlie with this, 178 yards, the par three, fourth, and a first career ace.
 
Tiger with just the happiest look and the hug there for his son. Wonderful to see. 
 <br>[04:55:00]
 
But wait, less than 10 minutes later, star Padraig Harrington and his 21-year-old son Paddy with a six iron from 185 yards, rolling it straight in, his first career ace as well. Just what are the odds?
 
Well, the tournament itself going to a playoff as Team Woods face defending champs Team Lange. Charlie Woods with a chance to take the lead on the second playoff hole, but no, it just slips out. 
 
So Bernard Lange learning from his son Jason's first putt in this scramble format, and the German legend did not miss. The pair going on to defend their title. In fact, it's the fourth title for Team Lange, for these two in particular. Bernard adding two more as well with older son Stefan.
 
BERNARD LANGER, TWO-TIME MAJOR CHAMPION: Well, I've said a long time ago, this is the fifth major for me because I love this tournament. I just love playing with my kids and have family supporting us. And when Charlie made that hole-in-one, I've never seen Tiger happier than when his son made his first hole-in-one. It was a fantastic moment.
 
SNELL: And they call this time of year the silly season for golf. And now we know why. One of the most memorable days in the sports calendar year.
 
Right back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)
 
QUEST: Before I leave you, let me bring you some breaking news and perhaps some desperately needed good news this holiday season. Several Israeli families of hostages say they've received signs of life from their loved ones being held captive by Hamas in Gaza. This is according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.
 
Now, they wouldn't disclose how any families received these signs of life, nor when it took place. Israeli negotiators and U.S. officials have said in the past week they've seen real progress towards reaching a hostage and ceasefire deal in Gaza. Israeli officials are cautioning there are gaps that must be sorted through.
