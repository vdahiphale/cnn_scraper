UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is CNN Breaking News.
 
ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN ANCHOR: Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us here in the United States, around the world and streaming us on CNN Max. I'm Rosemary Church in Atlanta. 
 
BECKY ANDERSON, CNN ANCHOR: And I'm Becky Anderson in Tel Aviv. It is 8:00 a.m. here in Israel and in Lebanon, where Israeli troops are now conducting what they describe as a limited ground operation. 
 
Well that is the sound of artillery fire along the Israeli-Lebanese border overnight, where the Israeli military says it's conducting targeted raids on villages that pose immediate threats to communities in Northern Israel, although Israeli officials say there will be no long term occupation of southern Lebanon.
 
The Israeli army released this video that it says shows preparations for the ground operation. The U.S. says Israel informed it of a number of operations, including the ground incursion. And a National Security Council spokesperson tells CNN that the mission can be a risk and the White House will keep discussing that with the Israelis. 
 
Meanwhile, there have been new airstrikes in Beirut's southern suburbs. You can see smoke rising into the air in this video from CNN crews in the city. Well, CNN's Paula Hancocks live in Abu Dhabi with more. 
 
And Paula, this invasion was announced just before 02:00 a.m. Local time. At this stage, what further details do we have? 
 
PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Becky, this started just a couple of hours after the national security cabinet approved the next phase in Israel's fight against Hezbollah. It's now clear what that next phase is. Now we understand from our teams on the ground at the border that you
 
 can hear artillery fire. You can also see flashes in the sky as we now know that Israeli troops are inside southern Lebanon. Now, the IDF issued a statement and they have called this a targeted and limited ground operation. They have said that they're going to specifically be in the area of a number of small villages along the border where they say Hezbollah has been hiding weapons caches, where they say that Hezbollah operatives are based. And that is what they say at this point. 
 
As you mentioned, though, an Israeli official did tell CNN that there is going to be no long term occupation and they are just following immediate threats from Hezbollah so that they can allow tens of thousands of Israeli residents to move back to northern Israel. 
 
Now, of course, that does sound very different on the Lebanese side of the border. They will certainly be concerned about what this limited operation could look like, especially when you consider that back in 1980 Israel said it would have a limited operation and that followed then occupation until the year 2000. 
 
And more recently, Becky, just look back at Israel saying it would have a limited offensive in Rafah in the south of Gaza to counter international opposition. And parts -- large parts of that city are now unrecognizable. So there is concern within Lebanon itself. 
 
Now, when it comes to the U.S. side, we -- this also comes just a few hours after the U.S. President Joe Biden said that we should have a ceasefire now, just underlining the limited impact that the Biden administration has on countering what Israel is doing at this point. 
 
But we also heard from the defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, effectively approving what Israel is doing. He said in a tweet, quote, we agreed on the necessity of dismantling attack infrastructure along the border to ensure that Lebanese Hezbollah cannot conduct October 11 style attacks on Israel's northern communities. I reaffirmed that a diplomatic resolution is required to ensure that civilians can return safely to their homes on both sides of the border. 
 <br>[01:05:10]
 
Now this is what we have been hearing consistently from Israeli officials, that there is a concern that what Hamas managed to carry out on October 7 on Israeli communities Hezbollah could carry out as well. And that is a big part of why Israel decided to go into Lebanon, they say. Becky. 
 
ANDERSON: Paula Hancocks in Abu Dhabi with the very latest. Well, Ayman Mhanna is the executive director of the Samir Kassir Foundation. He joins us live from Beirut. Official confirmation now that Israeli troops have invaded in the south, albeit, in what they describe as an operation limited in scope and further strikes on Beirut this morning. Your assessment of where things stand at this point. 
 
AYMAN MHANNA, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, SAMIR KASSIR FOUNDATION: Good morning. Please before I answer your question, let's spare a moment to think about all the thousands of displaced people who are now under heavy downpour rainfall, heavy rainfall in Lebanon. 
 
Their situation epitomizes everything that we as Lebanese people are enduring. Israeli strikes over our homes, over our neighborhood, also enduring the Lebanese government's lack of proper preparedness, despite months of Israeli warnings relayed by our international partners, and also enduring Hezbollah's miscalculation that dragged Lebanon into this war. Miscalculating Israeli reaction and miscalculating their own allies lack of support. 
 
So the situation today is grim in Lebanon with a limited, quote, unquote, incursion or operation. This is coded language for renewed invasion, renewed occupation, without any guarantee what a short term operation would mean, destruction across the border, I mean, across the Lebanese southern border. 
 
ANDERSON: What has been the official response, if any, from Lebanese authorities this morning? 
 
MHANNA: The Lebanese authorities very often remain silent. They're trying to focus on some kind of emergency shelter plan for the refugees, but they are way -- the preparedness is way below what was required. And this is what is really sad in Lebanon. We know the level and intensity of the Israeli attacks. We've seen it in Gaza. We know that very often what the Israelis are conducting are war crimes. 
 
But the real question is what we as Lebanese should have done. We as government, in terms of preparedness, in terms of knowing where people from area A should go to area B in case of attacks or Israeli warnings, knowing what type of preparedness for the medical sector should be prepared rather than just being left on their own. And also level of -- and also knowing why the Israeli government is conducting such attacks. 
 
The fact that Hezbollah completely miscalculated what the Israeli response would be thinking that it could actually maintain a level of operations that is relatively limited, that would prevent Israeli attacks, thinking that the international community will prevent Israel from attacking and thinking that Iran will support it more effectively are miscalculations that are as lethal to the Lebanese people as the Israeli criminal attacks and aggression over us. 
 
So this is why we're in a situation of despair, where even those who pretend to be allies are now responsible, exactly as much as the Israelis, for the plight we are all enduring as Lebanese people. 
 
ANDERSON: What's the risk to Lebanon? Not, I mean, we are talking about the displacement and death at this point, which is, of course, horrific. The wider story here is the potential of complete collapse, and that risks, you know, a wider conflict around this region. How do you assess the risk going forward to Lebanon, its society and its economy? 
 
MHANNA: The risks for Lebanon are existential. And I'm -- it's even a, you know, I'm being pragmatic and I'm being almost at the same time optimistic when I say that the risks are existential. In addition to the terrible economic collapse that Hubec has been covering so precisely since 2019, with a currency that has lost 95 percent of its value, with 80 percent of the Lebanese people living in, under poverty line, with a government that is even refusing reform plans put forward by the IMF. 
 
So basically, refusing international aid by a Lebanese government that is abandoning its sovereignty to Hezbollah, with the consequences that it knows in terms of ability to attract foreign aid. 
 <br>[01:10:10]
 
With a population that is extremely divided over Hezbollah's role, despite a very noble sense of solidarity towards the displaced. Now we found ourselves before a risk of complete Israeli destruction of what remains of our infrastructure and also prolonged displacement with no prospect of return, because to return, people need money to rebuild. 
 
This money in 2006 came from allies of Lebanon who are no longer ready to support us because of our political position. And it came from Hezbollah. Today, Hezbollah is no longer in a position to distribute cash to people from south Lebanon. 
 
So if they stay where they are today, disappointed by the lack of Hezbollah protection and deterrence and at the same time with communities that have never supported Hezbollah, there is a real risk for bottom up violence, for bottom up clashes between people, for tension, communal tensions in Lebanon that could actually be truly destructive for the social fabric of our country. 
 
This is why the need for very strong diplomacy today by the Lebanese government and our allies and also stopping the double language of the U.S. when it says that, I mean, Joe Biden said that he opposed ground invasion a couple of hours before it actually happened, and the White House changed its position on the matter. This double language is so harmful for the credibility of the U.S. administration or for whatever is left of that credibility. 
 
And at the same time, the only people paying the price are the Lebanese people and are, you know, and it's Lebanon as a structure, as a social fabric and a social contract. 
 
ANDERSON: Ayman Mhanna, the voice of concern, live out of Beirut this morning. And just a reminder that while the White House has said it sees the Israeli move overnight as in line with Israel's right to defend itself against threats from terror groups, it is warning mission creep is a real risk at this point. 
 
Well, Syria says Israeli strikes in Damascus a short time ago have killed a three people. The Syrian defense ministry says Israeli planes and drones targeted the city in the early morning hours. Video posted to social media shows an explosion next to Syria's telecom building. 
 
Syrian state media says a well-known television anchor and two others were killed. When asked about the strikes, the Israeli military said it doesn't comment on reports in foreign media. And I'll be back with more news. But for now, let's hand it over to Rosemary Church in Atlanta for the
 
 very latest on the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. Rosemary? 
 
CHURCH: All right. Thanks so much, Becky. We'll be back with you very soon. The death toll from Hurricane Helene in the southeastern U.S. has risen to at least 128 as the recovery begins and search and rescue efforts continue. 
 
The U.S. presidential contenders addressed the damage from the storm on Monday. Residents attempt to pick up the pieces. Vice President Kamala Harris cut short her campaigning on the west coast to fly back to Washington for a briefing on the federal response to Helene. Speaking with relief workers, she shared a message of support for Americans dealing with the disaster. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: I plan to be on the ground as soon as possible, but as soon as possible without disrupting any emergency response operations because that must be the highest priority in the first order of business. 
 
To everyone who has been impacted by this storm, President Biden and I and all of the folks behind me are with you. We will continue to do everything we can to help you recover and to help you rebuild, no matter how long it takes. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: Meanwhile, Donald Trump was in South Georgia, where helped to distribute aid in some of the hard hit areas. His visit, though, turned political as he falsely claimed the Biden administration isn't answering calls from state leaders asking for help. President Biden responded to those remarks, calling them, quote, irresponsible and simply not true. 
 
Well, President Biden is set to visit North Carolina on Wednesday. The state has reported the most deaths from Helene, with 56, as well as entire towns cut off from access to aid. North Carolina's attorney general says it will take weeks, months and years to recover from this storm. CNN's Rafael Romo spoke with residents there. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Put some coffee in here. 
 
RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Surrounded by destruction, without electricity, this freshly brewed cup of coffee is a small luxury for Sarah Timko. 
 
DAVE TIMKO, STORM VICTIM'S FATHER: I asked my daughter, are you OK? I just texted her and she sent me back these horrifying pictures. I mean, it looked like Armageddon. 
 
ROMO (voice-over): That's when Dave Timko decided to travel hundreds of miles to come to the rescue of his daughter and her family, bringing food, water, gas and supplies. 
 
TIMKO: Buildings down, houses washed away. I'm like, oh, my God. My daughter's in the middle of this, and she's seven and a half months pregnant. 
 
SARAH TIMKO, ASHEVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA RESIDENT: The baby's going to be here in about eight weeks, and it's my first, so it's exciting. I also don't want him to come early because we are not prepared. 
 
ROMO (voice-over): The Asheville, North Carolina, resident and her family were among the hundreds of thousands of people left without power here in devastated western North Carolina. With major disaster declarations in 25 counties, emergency crews say they are overwhelmed not only by the amount of people in need of help, but also because they're unable to reach many of them. 
 
ROMO: Cut off communities, destroy roads and broken bridges like this one here in Swannanoa, are making the job of first responders and search and rescue teams very difficult here in western North Carolina. 
 
JULIAN TORRES HARWOOD, ASHEVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA RESIDENT: I didn't really know my neighbors that well, actually, until like two days ago. 
 
ROMO (voice-over): In this Asheville neighborhood, people decided they couldn't wait for help to arrive. 
 
HARDWOOD: They've given us water, fuel, food. 
 
ROMO (voice-over): They organized themselves to clear their street that was covered in mud and debris. 
 
HARWOOD: And we've all chipped in. We've all worked together. It's been really special. 
 
ROMO (voice-over): Most people in the areas devastated by the storm have no power, water or cell service as residents line up for necessities. FEMA is using helicopters to deliver supplies. Sarah Timko says she was not prepared for this kind of unexpected disaster. 
 
ROMO (voice-over): What was your reaction when he said, honey, I'm going your way and I'm bringing supplies? 
 
TIMKO: I was like, that's my dad. That's him. He's always there for me. 
 
D. TIMKO: This is my first grandchild, her first child. You know, that's a very delicate time, right? 
 
ROMO (voice-over): In the worst of times, the best in people is making a big difference. Rafael Romo, CNN, Asheville, North Carolina. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHUCH: Jessica Thompson is the CEO of the nonprofit All Hands and Hearts. She joins us now from Charlotte in North Carolina. Thank you so much for talking to us at this difficult time. With hundreds still missing, 128 confirmed dead, and millions of
 
 residents without power, water and cellphone coverage in parts of North Carolina, how desperate is the situation there and what is the biggest need right now? 
 
JESSICA THOMPSON, CEO, ALL HANDS AND HEARTS: Thanks for having us and firstly, our hearts go out to everybody who's been affected by this terrible hurricane. I would say that we are still really in the critical emergency phase of this disaster. And the communities that we have visited today do not have power, do not have drinking water, do not have cell service, and there are long lines at the gas pump. 
 
So we need to give emergency services and emergency management personnel the time and space to be able to bring those things back online for these communities in advance even of any of the cleanup and recovery efforts that will come later. 
 
CHURCH: And more than 20 acute care hospitals in North Carolina are now back on the power grid after being on generator power. What is the overall situation with hospitals and other care healthcare situations there across the state? 
 
THOMPSON: A lot of the infrastructure is still damaged and is going to take a long, long time to fix. As a volunteer organization, we focus on private homes, but we can only bring in our staff and volunteers to work on those community projects once it is safe and appropriate to do so. 
 
And as I just explained, with the geography in this area, the impacts are really severe. And so we will base our teams closer to Charlotte at this point and then bee working into the affected area as those services come back online. 
 
CHURCH: Hard hit towns in North Carolina, of course, are still waiting for help after widespread damage and blocked roads there. Why is that help taking so long? And why can't supplies of clean water and food be airdropped into those desperate for help right now? 
 
THOMPSON: I think that the mountainous geography is really working against these communities. We've seen a lot of landslides blocking the roads, and so obviously that's the easy, easiest way for those kinds of supplies to be able to get in. The damage that we're seeing, the concentration, the severity, it is on par with other major disasters that we have seen over the last 20 years, like Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Katrina. 
 <br>[01:20:06]
 
These communities really are impassable at the moment. And I will say that in my 15 years in the sector, I have never seen so many helicopters. So I think people are trying to get those supplies in any way they can. 
 
CHURCH: That's good to know. And, of course, as we mentioned earlier, around 600 people or so remain missing after this catastrophic storm in the southeast. What is being done to find and those who remain missing? 
 
THOMPSON: Emergency service personnel are still in that acute phase of this disaster. They are asking people to please not self-deploy, please do not travel to this area. It is a safety concern for yourself and for others while they undertake these search and rescue operations. 
 
And clearly, you don't want to be a burden on these communities or to take those critical resources away from the people that they are meant for, especially when it's so difficult for them to get in. 
 
CHURCH: Jessica Thompson, thank you so much for talking with us, and, of course, for all the great work you were doing there. Appreciate it. 
 
THOMPSON: Thank you. 
 
CHURCH: The U.S. vice presidential nominees will hold their first, and so far only scheduled debate Tuesday night. Their face off comes just five weeks before the election, and it could be the final debate of the campaign season. 
 
Democratic nominee Tim Walz has told people he's nervous about doing debates, but says he hopes voters will know that he and his running mate Kamala Harris are, quote, just doing our best for folks. Republican nominee J.D. Vance and his wife arrived in New York Monday, where the debate will be held. 
 
As for his strategy, the senator from Ohio has said he'll use the debate to, quote, prosecute the case against Kamala Harris. And CNN will have special coverage of the vice presidential debate. Jake Tapper and Erin Burnett will get things started Tuesday at 7:00 p.m. in New York. That is 7:00 a.m. Wednesday. in Hong Kong.
 
Workers at 14 us ports have made good on their word to go out on strike at midnight. Ahead, why the American economy isn't the only one that could face fallout. We'll explain. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[01:26:46]
 
CHURCH: A check on our top story this hour. The Israeli military says it's begun a limited ground operation against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, marking a new phase in their war. A CNN team near the border witnessed explosions, plumes of smoke and artillery fire overnight. It's unclear how long the operation is expected to last, but Israel says it has no plans for a long term occupation. 
 
The White House says it supports Israel's right to defend itself against Hezbollah, but warns the mission remains a risk. 
 
Nearly 50,000 dock workers at several key us ports are now on strike. Members of the Longshoremen Union are walking picket lines to demand higher wages, this after workers rejected an offer by the alliance representing ports. CNN's Brian Todd explains. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Longshoremen at the port of Baltimore holding their ground and possibly losing money doing it. 
 
ALONZO KEY, LONGSHOREMAN, PORT OF BALTIMORE: Once we exhaust our savings, I mean, we don't know what the next move is going to be. 
 
TODD (voice-over): A potentially damaging port strike in the U.S. has just begun. Thousands of port workers in Baltimore and at about three dozen other facilities along the east coast and Gulf coast have walked off the job. 
 
KATHY HOCHUL, NEW YORK GOVERNOR: The stakes are very high. The potential for disruption is significant. 
 
TODD (voice-over): This strike, the first at those ports in almost 50 years, could disrupt the flow of almost half the goods that come into the US. That could lead to shortages, then higher prices. 
 
TODD: What's going to be in short supply? 
 
MATTHEW SHAY, CEO AND PRESIDENT, NATIONAL RETAIL FEDERATION: Perishables. Obviously we can't bring those in advance. So anything that's in the produce categories that comes in. Bananas have been talked about a lot. Cherries and other fruits that come in from South America and other places that will be impacted right away with any stoppage. 
 
TODD (voice-over): European beer, wine, liquor could be affected as we head into the holidays, furniture, household goods, clothing, cars and auto parts could also be in shorter supply and then get more expensive. But officials and retail analysts say we should not rush to stores and stockpile goods like many did during the COVID pandemic. 
 
SHAY: We don't want to panic. The retailers and their partners in the shipping business and other importers have done everything they can to mitigate any disruption. So they've tried to bring things in. They've got inventory already here on the east coast and near the population centers. They've got inventory rerouted to the west coast that'll come over by rail. 
 
TODD (voice-over): The workers from the International Longshoremen's Association feel like they've fallen way behind other sectors in wages. 
 
PROF. HARRY KATZ, CORNELL SCHOOL OF INDUSTRY AND LABOR RELATIONS: The workers are asking for more wages and also are concerned about the introduction of new technology, which may replace some of them. 
 
TODD (voice-over): The industry, led by the United States Maritime Alliance, says it's offered a fair wage increase and accuses the port workers union of negotiating in bad faith. President Biden has the power to force workers to stay on the job, but has said he won't use it. 
 
ALL: Corporate green has got to go. TODD (voice-over): This stoppage comes on the heels of successful
 
 strikes by the United Auto Workers Union and UPS employees. Workers at Boeing have been on strike for more than two weeks. 
 
KATZ: It's a mixed picture overall. Workers are doing and unions are doing better because the economy is better, but they're not always winning. 
 <br>[01:29:50] 
 
TODD: What sectors won't be damaged by a port strike? Passenger ships won't be affected and oil tankers and other ships carrying liquefied natural gas usually go to other facilities that won't be affected by a strike. 
 
Brian Todd, CNN -- Washington.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN ANCHOR: The effect this port workers strike will have on the U.S. economy could be significant, especially heading into the holiday season. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARLEY SHAIKEN, PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF CALFORNIA, BERKELEY: It will have a very damaging effect on the U.S. economy to be sure, but it will tangle global supply lines.
 
One major qualification to that. If it's a short strike, the damage is real but far less severe than if the strike goes beyond a week or two. 
 
The estimates are that the U.S. economy will lose $3.8 billion to $5 billion a day. That's real money. 
 
And half the container traffic coming into the United States well be halted.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: All right. Time for a short break. 
 
We will get you up to speed on our breaking news out of Lebanon where the Israeli military has launched a limited ground operation against Hezbollah. 
 
Back with that in just a moment.
 <br>[01:31:26]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BECKY ANDERSON, CNN ANCHOR: Well, it's just after 8:30 here in Israel. I'm Becky Anderson.
 
Let's get you up to date on our breaking news this hour. Israel's military says it has launched a limited ground operation
 
 against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. The IDF says the terrorist group poses a real and immediate danger to Israeli settlements on the northern border. It stressed there will be no long-term occupation.
 
The White House is warning that mission creep can be a real risk and discussions they say with the Israelis will go on. 
 
A CNN team close to the border heard the sounds of ongoing artillery fire of drones and helicopters. And in Beirut, explosions lit up the night sky followed by plumes of thick black smoke. Lebanese officials report at least 95 people were killed there within a 24-hour period.
 
Meanwhile, Syria blaming Israel for an airstrike on Damascus, the state news agency says a prominent TV host and two others were killed. Israel says it doesn't comment on reports in the foreign media. 
 
Well, Miri Eisin is a retired Israel Defense Forces colonel and a senior fellow at the International Institute for Counter-Terrorism at Reichman University and joins me live from here in Tel Aviv.
 
And it is good to have you this morning. 
 
Your initial assessment of what we are seeing on the ground, Miri, if you will.
 
MIRI EISIN, SENIOR FELLOW, INTERNATIONAL ISNTITUTE FOR COUNTER- TERRORISM: The IDF spokesperson has said that it is the 98th Division, which is made up out of paratroopers and commando units. 
 
That is at least one of the forces participating in this limited assault. What we're talking about is a kind of Special Forces advent. 
 
We're going into an area which similar to what Hamas built in the Gaza strip, Hezbollah, the Radwan forces have built inside the different cities, towns, and villages of southern Lebanon. Both subterranean, underground and above ground, booby trap locations, and enormous arsenals of weapons. 
 
As we speak also, Becky, they're still firing rockets into Israel. As you were describing the noises and the different aspects add into it but up north you also had sirens from the incoming. 
 
Only Israel built defense systems and tells us to go into bomb shelters so that we're safer than those other people because that was built by us. 
 
So that's where we are right now. It's going to be small all located special forces, not a stroll in the park, very challenging.
 
Becky: Yes. And we've had word at CNN, paratroopers, commandos, special forces working on the border here now in northern Israel for weeks in preparation of what we are seeing.
 
The prime minister's office has released some statistics this morning, 9,300 Hezbollah launches into Israel since October the 8th, nearly a year now and more than 60,000 of course, displaced in northern Israel. 
 
The goal of this war stated by the prime minister is to return those people to their communities safely and securely. 
 
Of course, we have to remember 120,000 odd or more displaced, of course, from southern Lebanon at this point as well.
 
The White House supports Israel's right to defend itself. It is also concerned about mission creep at this point. How do you respond to that term, "mission creep"?
 <br>[01:39:43]
 
Becky: After all, there have been invasions of the past that have been described as limited in scope. Of course 1982 which ended up with Israeli forces not withdrawing for some three years. 
 
What's different this time, if anything?
 
EISIN: So Becky, I was a young officer in 1982 and I've just finished officers' course when what was called then "Operation Peace for Galilee" started and I just want to remind here, because it's in the history lesson that when Israel went in, it was because at that stage, southern Lebanon -- Lebanon itself in a civil war, was dotted with the different Palestinian terror organizations that since then certainly when we're talking about the (INAUDIBLE) party and what went on changed a tune. It doesn't make it any better.
 
I definitely hope that the Israeli, both the military aspect of it, is to go in and directly attack the Radwan Hezbollah forces. Those are the trained commando forces that have fought in Lebanon. That have fought in Syria, that have been trained and armed by Iran that have lots of different weapons. That were preparing to do what they called "Operation Liberation of the Galilee".
 
So in that sense, when I listen to that it's listening to the United States and its understanding that Israel in its own way, and I know this isn't a popular way to look at it, Israel has been very restrained over the last 11 months because of both U.S. involvement, because of diplomacy, trying to go step up with (INAUDIBLE) with the possibility of diplomacy. And I say sadly for all of the diplomats, that I don't know any diplomat that's going to dislodge the Radwan forces.
 
Becky: Benjamin Netanyahu was warned that the long arm of the Israeli military will extend to wherever Israel's enemy is based. 
 
And Miri, there is no doubt that the assassinations of key figures in Hezbollah, including the longtime head Hassan Nasrallah, are strategically significant. 
 
As we close this, I wonder that's changed to your mind in terms of Israeli intelligence to secure those successes?
 
EISIN: The first is that when Israel went on the initiative and all of the world now in that sense, but especially the Middle East, see what we do when we are effective and capable and on the initiative and this does not erase the colossal failure on the Israeli part of October 7th, but it shows what you do. 
 
Israel was focused on that northern arena the northern arena in general also has to do with deterrence. It's not just against Hezbollah, and the Hezbollah capabilities in Lebanon. 
 
And I'll remind you also in Syria, Hezbollah is deployed also in Syria. This is also about the benefactor and the backer of Iran. It's about deterrence. 
 
So when you look that step further, when you don't just talk and you take action that has an impact in the Middle East, that action itself has to be effective. The action itself has to be targeted against those terrorists.
 
Hezbollah is going to say lots of things. They put out little clips and little posters, every single thing that they do, they're very proud of what they do. 
 
They're not going to put out now of what we're doing in that sense, they're going to show it from their perspective. 
 
And I think that what Israel needs to do is not only impact their military capability, but also impact the way that we look at the threats in this area because at the end, it's about regional deterrence. 
 
It's not about destroying the other side. It's about achieving a type of deterrence where we're not the underdog, we're not the one under attack you.
 
Becky: Miri Eisin and you and I have spoken a number of times over the past months. It's always good to have your insight and analysis. It's extremely important to us there. Thank you. 
 
EISIN: Thank you.
 
Becky: We'll be back with more news after this. You're watching CNN. Stay with us.
 <br>[01:43:45]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHURCH: Welcome back, everyone. 
 
Well, China is celebrating a major anniversary. The People's Republic was founded 75 years ago on October 1st, 1949. And all sorts of events have been getting underway in Beijing. Despite China's persistent economic downturn, President Xi Jinping said the country is moving forward. And he used the week-long national holiday to bring up the tense topic of Taiwan.
 
Let's turn to CNN's Marc Stewart who's covering this live from the Chinese capital. Good to see you, Marc. So in the midst of these festivities, President Xi Jinping is
 
 repeating calls for China and Taiwan to reunite. That's the latest on this? And of course reaction to those calls.
 
MARC STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Good to see you, Rosemary. 
 
Look these calls for reunification with Taiwan are not necessarily a surprise as China looks at the past, and it also looks forward on the 75th anniversary. 
 
This is very much a time of celebration, a chance for Xi Jinping to talk about China's accomplishments, almost a pat on the back, if you will.
 
We have some video from earlier today. There was a flag-raising ceremony just down the way at Tiananmen Square. There's also a balloon release.
 
If we look at some of the coverage though from Chinese state media, we are hearing a lot of themes about national achievements, about pushing for humanity, about pushing for modernization as China looks to the future. 
 
Now, this was not necessarily a political speech that we heard from Xi Jinping or focus on policy. But he did bring up this Taiwan question and the importance of almost reuniting with the motherland.

STEWART: Let's take a listen to some of his remarks.

XI JINPING, CHINESE PRESIDENT (through translator): Taiwan is China's sacred territory. People on both sides of the strait are related by blood and blood is thicker than water.

STEWART: He went on to call this an example of not stopping the march of history. 
 
China is in a bit of a challenging time. Yes, the stock market has been doing well thanks to some new stimulus. But there are some looming economic issues that China will have to confront in its history, including high youth unemployment as well as white-collar workers just not knowing what the future will hold.
 
A speech like this, Rosemary is a way to re-energize the Communist Party, re-energize the citizens and look ahead to the future.
 
CHURCH: All right. Our thanks to Marc Stewart joining us there live from Beijing. Appreciate it. 
 
Well, lawmakers in Japan are voting in a new prime minister. Shigeru Ishiba is a former defense minister and longtime member of parliament. He was voted to leave the ruling Liberal Democratic Party last week
 
 after Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's decision to step down. Ishiba will have a lot on his plate on day one, unveiling a new cabinet, and getting his party ready for snap elections later this month.
 
And CNNs Hanako Montgomery joins me now, live from Tokyo. Good to see you, Hanako. 
 
So how tight was this race and what problems does Ishiba inherit from the previous administration?
 
HANAKO MONTGOMERY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hi Rosemary, it's good to see you.
 
Now this was again, as you described, a very hotly contested and tight race. On Friday during the Liberal Democratic Party's election for their new party president, we saw Shigeru Ishiba up against eight candidates, but really two other front-runners.
 
The first Sanae Takaichi (ph), who is more of a hardline conservative and someone who prides herself in being a former Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe's protege. And now if she were elected, she would have been Japan's first woman prime minister.
 
Ishiba was also up against Shinjiro Koizumi, who comes from a political dynasty in Japan and someone who positioned himself as more of a reformer. And now, if he were elected, he would have been Japan's youngest prime minister ever.
 
But as we saw on Friday, the party and party-registered voters chose Shigeru Ishiba to be the new president of the Liberal Democratic Party. And also the new Japanese prime minister.
 
Now Shigeru Ishiba is known as a former defense minister and someone who's done a lot of work in rural revitalization. Of course, that is a very big problem in Japan because of the demographic crisis that it faces. And he's actually quite well liked by the general public because of this. 
 
But within his own party, he actually struggles with a lot of unpopularity. He's seen as more of a harsh critic and someone who once betrayed his own party when the LDP lost power very briefly. 
 
Now, Ishiba, of course, despite these issues was able to secure enough votes to become the president of the LDP. Clearly, lawmakers saw him as the best choice to lead the party in the general elections, which will be held in October.
 
Now, Ishiba, as you mentioned Rosemary, does inherit a couple of very large problems from now, the former Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida. 
 
The first is a lackluster economy and a very high cost of living for many people in Japan. 
 
And the second is very big and significant political scandals. And that's actually why we saw from the Fumio Kishida having to step down because he was unable to address these political scandals properly. That's what led to his approval rating drop so significantly among the general public. 
 
So Ishiba will now be tasked with actually regaining the public's trust, showing the public that the Liberal Democratic Party is the party that will unify the country and actually introduce a lot of policies and laws that will benefit all people, Rosemary.
 
CHURCH: All right. Our thanks to Hanako Montgomery joining us live there from Tokyo. Appreciate it. 
 
Well Mexico is preparing for Tuesday's inauguration of the country's first female president. Leaders from Latin America and the Caribbean have been arriving for the swearing in ceremony for President-Elect Claudia Sheinbaum, who will officially take office in the coming hours in Mexico City.
 
U.S. First Lady Jill Biden, is leading her country's delegation for the event.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JILL BIDEN, FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES: There's something special in the air this evening besides the rain. 
 
And I felt it as soon as I landed. A crackle of excitement to see the inauguration of the first woman president of Mexico. 
 <br>[01:54:52]
 
BIDEN: As President-Elect Dr. Sheinbaum has noted, she didn't arrive to this historic moment alone. She said, quote, "We all arrived with our heroines who gave us our homeland, with our ancestors, our mothers, our daughters, and our granddaughters. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: Sheinbaum won Mexico's election by a landslide back in June, promising to protect the country's social safety net and to be a champion for the poor like her predecessor.
 
I want to thank you so much for joining us this hour. I'm Rosemary Church.
