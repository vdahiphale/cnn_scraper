MEG TIRRELL, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: But that of course requires a certain circumstances where that's appropriate. More contact with your doctor. So that's more labor intensive. You could also get the oral formulations they say, the tablets and crush those up or put them in liquid and -- or applesauce. Then there are, of course, other antibiotics that can be swapped in. But you know, doctors really try not to do that if they don't have to, because you don't want to promote antibiotic resistance.
 
So, this has been a problem that's been going on for a while. Unfortunately, it's not unique to just this one drug. There are more than 300 drugs on the FDA's shortages list right now. The highest number that we've seen in almost a decade. So, this affects antibiotics, chemotherapy drugs, all kinds of medicines that are crucial to people's health. It's something that U.S. is paying attention to but it's certainly not something we're seeing getting solved immediately.
 
FREDRICKA WHITFIELD, CNN ANCHOR: Meg Tirrell, thank you so much for that.
 
All right. Hello again, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me. I'm Fredricka Whitfield. And let's begin on storm watch as Tropical Storm Ophelia brings torrential rain and fierce winds up and down the East Coast. Coastal flooding is among the biggest concerns as rain bands stretch hundreds of miles north from the storm center, which made landfall in North Carolina this morning.
 
The sights and sounds of powerlines exploding there in North Carolina. Allison Chinchar is tracking Ophelia from the CNN Weather Center for us. Polo Sandoval is the New Jersey coast and Brian Todd is in Alexandria, Virginia. Let's begin with you, Allison. So, what's the latest on the storm and its potential?
 
ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Right. So, the big concern here is just how widespread the storm is in terms of impacts. When you look at the main center of the storm, it's still located over North Carolina. But these outer bands stretch well into the northeast. You're talking rain in New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, even portions of Massachusetts. Now the main portion of the system is Central Park.
 
We still have sustained winds of 50 miles per hour slightly higher gusts than that. Here's a look at all of those rain bands, though. Again, you can see some of those rain bands occasionally making their way into Connecticut, Massachusetts. We're starting to get some heavier bands into areas of New Jersey and Delaware. Now the heaviest rain is really still focused over portions of Virginia, as well as North Carolina.
 
We've even had a couple of tornado warnings off and on throughout the day in North Carolina. You've got flood watches and even several flash flood warnings including the city of Raleigh and then several counties out to the east. That concern for these communities if they've already had two and even three inches of rainfall. Now you're looking at an additional one to two inches on top of what they've already had.
 
So again, that's going to be a big concern there. But the system is going to spread farther north. By tonight the focus is really over the mid-Atlantic and then by Sunday morning, the focus really takes shape over the portions of the Northeast.
 
WHITFIELD: OK. People already started to feel it. Thank you so much, Allison. How about Brian Todd, where you are in Alexandria, last hour was a little windy, just a little bit of rain. Now what?
 
BRIAN TODD, CNN CORESPONDENT: Right, Fredricka. But the dangers already started to kind of build here. What I can show you is a live rescue going on. If you see that fire boat behind me on the Potomac River. We were told that they had to go and pull a windsurfer off of the Potomac River. So, he's just moving up river right now after rescuing a windsurfer as the tides and the -- and the waters get a little choppy here on the Potomac.
 
So, again, some of the treachery, some of the danger here starting to build a little bit here. You know, we haven't had too much of an impact so far here in Alexandria, Virginia, but they know it's coming here. We just talked to a city official who is advising people to -- with the wind picking up later on to make sure that everything in your patio, your balcony is secured or taken inside because they do expect the winds to pick up.
 
Here in Alexandria, here's part of what we're up against here. You've got drainage areas here that fill up the sewers or kind of antiquated here. So, when the flooding starts and this street, Prince Street is expected to be flooded later. When it starts, this entire area is expected to be flooded. I'm joined here by Bennett Moore. He is the manager of Big Wheel Bikes here in Alexandria.
 
Bennett, you told me you're not too concerned about the impact now. Are you concerned about what may be coming later?
 
BENNETTE MOORE, MANAGER, BIG WHEEL BIKES: Today? No, if it's high tides at 3:00, if it's only up as a puddle right now, it's not really a concern. I mean, 2003, Isabel, that was a concern. TODD: But maybe talk about -- this area does have drainage problems and you do get flooding here. What's that like when it -- when it does happen?
 
MOORE: Well, they'll block the streets, they'll tow the cars. The city would normally be out by now putting out the barriers to keep cars and they would start telling the cars. Right now, I mean, maybe that's going to happen in an hour. I'm not seeing anything happening really here. 
 
TODD: One of the other business owners told me that she's more worried about high tide tomorrow morning at about 7:00 a.m. Why is that?
 
MOORE: I guess the river is going to swell. It's going to rain all night. So, when it swells up high tide that's going to backup. So yes, we'll probably get it to the door. I don't think it's going to go inside. We're raised about four feet for that here in this corner.
 <br>[13:05:06]
 
TODD: So, you're a little protected. Will you guys put down sandbags or anything?
 
MOORE: I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to worry about it. You know, we're elevated, and it ramps up on the other entrance there, so we're not going to get water inside.
 
TODD: Bennette, thank you very much for talking to us. Good luck riding this thing out. Again, you know, Fredricka, what we're told is this area here is very vulnerable to flooding in Old Town, Alexandria. The river is right there. It's going to start rising in about two hours with high tide. And again, as Bennett mentioned, high tide at about 7:00 a.m. tomorrow morning is another thing that they are concerned about.
 
Drainage here is a real issue. And that's why this area gets very flooded during storms like this. So, we're going to keep an eye on that in the hours ahead.
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Brian, Todd, thank you so much and best to Bennette and his business and all of his neighbors.
 
All right. Polo Sandoval is on the Jersey Shore. What's going on there?
 
POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: You know, on a Saturday in September, this boardwalk would typically be pretty busy. Today, you obviously have a few folks that are taking in the sights here. But today, though, for the most part, you won't find a lot of folks except for some of these individuals behind me. That's mainly because a lot of these businesses, Fred, they are closed for today because of the weather.
 
That carnival you see off in the distance, or at least those rides are definitely not working today. And the gates to the beach here on the Jersey Shore are closed up. So, there is some obviously warnings there for folks not to make it to the other side of this. So, there's a lady there that you'll see often the distance. We'll try to talk to her a little later. But really, when you look off of the coast, you see just the coast and not just the -- and also the water.
 
There was one gentleman that walked by here that told me that this is something that you don't see every day. So, really speaks to the bulk of the concern here which is really offshore, those dangerous rip currents. That's why officials have closed off beach access for the most part here in Seaside Heights. It seems that we have pretty much a break from the rain. It's more of the flooding concern, especially as we get closer to high tide, and most importantly, just off shore with those dangerous rip currents. At least here in Jersey, Fred.
 
WHITFIELD: All right. A widespread flooding concerns along the east coast. Thank you so much. Polo Sandoval, Brian Todd and Allison Chinchar. We'll check back with all of you.
 
All right. Now to Capitol Hill, where budget talks in Congress are at a standstill as a federal government shutdown looms next weekend potentially. Moments ago, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy addressed reporters admitting he still lacks support from a handful of Republican hardliners but added quote, quoting now, "I think now some members are feeling the pressure of the timeline coming up."
 
Preparations are being made to halt non-essential functions ahead of the September 30th deadline including details on how many people will face a furlough and which employees will be deemed essential and asked to work without pay.
 
CNN's Priscilla Alvarez joining us now from the White House. Priscilla, what is the Biden administration doing to prepare or perhaps even head off a government shutdown?
 
PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: Well, they're essentially telling the agencies to dust off their plans in preparation of a potential shutdown. So, what that looks like is the Office of Management and Budget formally initiated a process on Friday that would help prepare these agencies for a shutdown. That includes a number of things. And each of these plans, including how many people get furloughed.
 
What -- who was considered essential and would have to work without pay. And then to what comes to a halt. Now, there are of course, certain services that the government provides that are going to continue. Border protection, federal law enforcement, air traffic control, all of that can continue. But it continues without pay. And that is the concern, as well as any disruption to other services that Americans use on a daily basis.
 
Now hear from the White House podium, we heard from the White House press secretary this week who said Republicans just have to get their act together. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Republicans shutdown does not have to happen. They can do their -- they can do their job, and keep these vital programs continuing, keeping the government open, the message is, this should not be happening. We should not be putting American families lives in turmoil.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WHITFIELD: Now the House Rules Committee is trying to move individual bills, leaner bills through to try to avoid any of this from happening. But there is still the question of whether there are even enough GOP votes for those bills. And if there were, it would still be dead on arrival in the Senate. And therefore, it would all point to a shutdown. So, the question remains as to where we're going to be a week from now when we hit that deadline. Fred?
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Priscilla Alvarez, thank you so much. Keep us posted from the White House.
 
So, as the clock ticks on Capitol Hill toward a potential government shutdown, child care in America is also facing a similar crisis. At the end of this month, a $24 billion set aside during the pandemic era to help fund the nation's childcare industry is set to run out. 
 <br>[13:10:03]
 
An estimate by the century foundation says the loss of money could mean as many as 70,000 childcare centers across the country having to close. Affecting about 3.2 million children. With me now to discuss this is Catherine Creighton. She is the Director for Cornell's School of Industrial and Labor Relations Buffalo Co-Lab. And she has been studying the impact of the additional funding and what kind of impact it has had on childcare providers.
 
Cathy, so great to see you. So, how concerned are you about the impact, the end of this funding and childcare in America?
 
CATHERINE CREIGHTON, DIRECTOR FOR CORNELL'S SCHOOL OF INDUSTRIAL AND LABOR RELATIONS BUFFALO CO-LAB: We're extremely concerned about what's happening in childcare. Our office has been studying the childcare issue, and particularly in the childcare nexus between how childcare works and provides a way for parents to go back to work to after they have children or when they have children and how that affects the business community.
 
And so, what we saw from the mid-2000s until right before the pandemic was that childcare providers were increasing in numbers and childcare workers were increasing in numbers. And then during the pandemic, of course, we had this terrible catastrophe in childcare where many people exited the childcare workforce. The -- what happened then was that the ARPA funding -- excuse me. ARPA funding.
 
WHITFIELD: It happens. Somebody has come to visit.
 
CREIGHTON: The ARPA funding really propped up. It provided stabilization grants for -- so that childcare providers could stay in business and childcare providers could keep working. And that meant that parents could return to the workplace and that businesses had enough sufficient number of workers. That money is going to run out. The way that that money, the ARPA money was funneled down to the states. And so, that state money isn't going to be there to help parents or children.
 
WHITFIELD: So then, do you see that as many as 70,000 childcare centers could, you know, face closing down without this kind of funding?
 
CREIGHTON: Absolutely, yes. The way that the childcare system runs currently is really a broken market. It relies upon a -- it takes a public good which is that our children should be cared for and educated very early on in their -- in their early years. And it makes parents paid solely for that cost. So, we already have a system that's really not sustainable. And so, the federal government and the state governments have been adding assistance on to that.
 
And of course, with that money gone, we're going to have a domino effect where childcare providers will not be in business. Parents won't have places to send their children and then parents won't return to the workforce, the workforce will have employee shortages, et cetera.
 
WHITFIELD: A huge ripple effect. Cathy Creighton, thank you so much. Really, you answered that door?
 
CREIGHTON: Yes. 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
WHITFIELD: No, you don't have to apologize. This is the -- this is the beauty of the technology that allows you to join us and you don't even have to leave your home. So, it means we've got to take all the comforts that come with it. We appreciate you.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
CREIGHTON: Good job. Kudos.
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Thank you so much.
 
CREIGHTON: All right. You're welcome.
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Still to come. The Homeland Security Secretary visiting the U.S.-Mexico border today as a new surge of migrants is placing renewed pressure on federal resources and President Biden's policies.
 
And in Europe, Pope Francis is calling on leaders for openness in welcoming migrants as the Mediterranean region faces a surge of new arrivals. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[13:18:12]
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Now to the ongoing response to this week surge of migrants at the southern border. U.S. Customs and Border Protection has resumed operations at the International Railway Crossing Bridge in Eagle Pass, Texas after the agency shut it down. Meanwhile, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Majorkas is set to visit the Rio Grande Valley in Southeast Texas today and will tour McAllen, Texas with the president of Honduras.
 
CNN Correspondent Rafael Romo is here with me. So, what is happening at the border? I mean, sounds like a lot right now, especially with these meetings.
 
RAFAEL ROMO, CNN SENIOR LATIN AMERICAN AFFAIRS EDITOR: Yes. And especially with the numbers of migrants that we've seen arriving over the last week or so. That number has decreased slightly over the last 24 hours. And governor -- Texas Governor Greg Abbott has been railing against the Biden administration, saying that the federal government is not doing enough to contain the wave of migrants coming to the border.
 
Let me read to you, Fred, what the governor said. He said, until President Biden upholds his constitutional duty to secure America's southern border, Texas will continue to deploy as many buses as needed to relieve the strain caused by the surge of illegal crossings. Of course, he is talking about the decision by his government to again, bus migrants from two cities in particular. Eagle Pass and El Paso to other cities around the country that are mainly run by Democrats.
 
I'm talking about places like New York, our nation's capital, places where we've seen these buses from Texas going there. There are thousands of migrants being bussed there since last year. We have nearly 12,000 in Washington, D.C. from last year, more than 14000 in New York and other places around the country.
 <br>[13:20:03]
 
So, the governor says we're doing this and we're going to continue to do this -- for as long as there's the situation of the border.
 
Now, you mentioned it before they're going to meet -- Mayorkas is going to meet the president of Honduras Xiomara Castro. A meeting that is about to take place in the next few hours.
 
WHITFIELD: And what could happen from that meeting? What would be the goal?
 
ROMO: The goal is to work together to try to stem the flow of so many migrants. But the reality is that they've tried in the past and they have failed. And there are factors that are much bigger than any government that are pushing these migrants to come to the north. Now, Xiomara Castro has been the president of Honduras since January last year and she is considered a leftist. But she's been working with the -- with the U.S. government.
 
And just to give you an idea how unstable the situation has been in the country, the former president of Honduras, her predecessor, Orlando Hernandez is in jail. He was extradited last year to the United States on charges of drug trafficking. Juan Orlando Hernandez I should say, and he's currently in jail. So, for this recent and others, the security situation and addresses is very, very dire.
 
WHITFIELD: Yes. All right. Rafael Romo, thanks so much.
 
ROMO: Thank you.
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Parts of Europe are also struggling with an escalating migrant crisis. Tens of thousands of migrants are fleeing parts of Africa and looking for refuge.
 
Earlier today, during his trip to France, Pope Francis called for more openness in welcoming migrants and met with French President Emmanuel Macron to discuss the crisis. CNN's Ben Wedeman has more from an Italian island dealing with the situation firsthand.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): From today, Lampedusa says enough shouts a resident of this small Italian island closer to Tunisia than the European mainland. This year, Lampedusa has been the destination of a dramatic influx of mostly Sub- Saharan migrants crossing the Mediterranean from Tunisia. Prompting European Commission President Ursula van der Leyen to fly there with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni to show Europe's support.
 
URSULA VON DER LEYEN, EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESIDENT: But we will decide who comes to the European Union and under what circumstances. And not the smugglers and traffickers.
 
WEDEMAN (voiceover): The number of migrants reaching Italy so far this year is twice as many as arrived by this time in 2022. In July, the E.U. and Tunisia signed a Memorandum of Understanding whereby the Europeans promised nearly bankrupt Tunisia financial support, and Tunisia promised to do more to stop unregulated migration. But Europe has yet to hand over the money and the migrants keep coming.
 
Italian politicians particularly those on the right have seized on the flood of migrants reaching the tiny island of 6000 souls. But the politicians need to keep it all in perspective, says Flavio Di Giacomo of the International Organization for Migration.
 
FLAVIO DI GIACOMO, SPOKESPERSON, INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR MIGRATION: I would say this is an emergency for Lampedusa, but definitely non-emergency -- not an emergency for Italy nor for Europe.
 
WEDEMAN (voiceover): WEDEMAN: The migrants are quickly sent to reception centers on the Italian mainland, and the crisis eases. With its plummeting-burgeoning (ph), Europe desperately needs new blood says di Giacomo.
 
DI GIACOMO: For demographic reasons Europe will need migrants. It's needing migrants now. So, the most important thing is to manage these phenomena with long-term policies, not with short-sighted policies.
 
WEDEMAN (voiceover): An idea shared by Italian president Sergio Mattarella, who recently said immigrants can constitute a great potential for our country. An important point lost perhaps on politicians focused on the next election and not the future.
 
Ben Wedeman, CNN, Rome.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
WHITFIELD: Coming up. The United Auto Workers Union strike against the three biggest U.S. automakers is expanding across 20 states, but the union says negotiations with Ford are advancing. We'll have all the details.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[13:28:45]
 
WHITFIELD: This week, President Biden will travel to Michigan and walk the picket line with members of the United Auto Workers Union. It has now been nine days since the auto workers began a massive strike against Ford, General Motors and Stellantis. But as negotiations with Ford show signs of progress. The strike is heading -- is spreading rather to more G.M. and still Stellantis facilities. Here is CNN Correspondent Vanessa Yurkevich.
 
VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS AND POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: So today, you now have over 18,000 UAW members on the picket line after President Fain of the UAW announced that he would be targeting 38 more facilities at G.M.  and Stellantis across 20 states sending an additional 5600 members out to the picket lines. And this is because President Fain said that G.M. and Stellantis needed a strong push to come with a better offer.
 
However, if you notice Ford was not noted in those additional targeted strikes. President Fain saying that real progress was made with Ford. And here's some details. According to the Union Ford's latest offer reinstated cost of living adjustments which was something that many of these workers gave up in 2009.
 <br>[13:30:06]
 
They're now offering more profit sharing and temporary workers can now become full time workers in 90 days. And there's additional job security, which essentially means that if a foreign employee is laid off, they will receive two years of income and benefits. But notably missing from the announcement on Friday was where things stood with wages. We know that the union has been asking for a 40 percent wage increase over four years. The last public offer from the three companies was around 20 percent.
 
Ford and the UAW saying that while they have come to terms with some of these other demands, there's still a big gap on the wage issue. And these new targeted strikes will certainly have an economic impact. This is going to impact dealerships, because dealerships will not be able to get parts from specifically GM and Stellantis. And this will then trickle down to the consumer who is looking to bring their car in for a repair, potentially those parts will not be available. We have some recent economic reporting from Anderson Economic Group that says just in the first eight days of this strike with just the three plants we have seen a $1.6 billion economic impact with these new 38 facilities that are now being targeted by the union.
 
That number, Omar and Victor is expected to grow.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
WHITFIELD: All right, Vanessa Yurkevich thank you so much.
 
All right. Still to come, a North Carolina family suing Google after the father drove off a collapsed bridge. Why the family says the company's maps led him to his death. We'll discuss.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[13:36:00]
 
WHITFIELD: A North Carolina woman is suing Google for the death of her husband claiming the company's maps application led him to drive off a collapsed bridge and drown. Last September, Philip Paxson was following Google Maps directions while driving home late at night in Hickory, North Carolina when the navigation system directed him to go over an unmarked and unbarricaded bridge that had collapsed years prior. Paxson then drove off the edge of the bridge and drown.
 
According to the lawsuit, neighbors had expressed concerns that Google Maps had led other drivers over the bridge, which allegedly has not been repaired since its partial collapse back in 2013. And in a statement to CNN, Google said, we have the deepest sympathies for the Paxon family. Our goal is to provide accurate routing information in maps and we're reviewing this lawsuit.
 
Defense Attorney, Misty Marris joining me now from New York. And Misty, great to see you. So, I mean, this is very sad situation, sad case. Your initial thoughts on this case?
 
MISTY MARRIS, DEFENSE ATTORNEY: What a tragic case absolutely. And Fred, you said it, this bridge had collapsed back in 2013. So, we're talking about 10 years later, without any signage, barricades, or anything to warn that this bridge was in disrepair. So, there's several different issues here, because there's multiple defendants. One, of course, is Google, and why these directions were given knowing that this bridge was collapsed, they acknowledged that they have received a complaint about it back in 2020, and then others who are responsible for the property.
 
So multiple parties here, as this lawsuit proceeds and some unique legal arguments with respect to each one.
 
WHITFIELD: And if the family or attorneys are able to prove that there is precedent on other drivers being misdirected on this road, and the complaints were documented. This, in your view, would this establish a case of negligence as well? MARRIS: So, it's interesting, because that's going to be critical. Negligence is always based on whether or not there was a notice of a dangerous condition. So that has to be established in order for the lawsuit to be successful. But we're in North Carolina here, and it's important to understand the laws of the jurisdiction. North Carolina is one of four states that has what's called no comparative negligence, which means that if the driver in this case is even found to be 1 percent, responsible for the accident, they recover nothing. So, it is a very, very big legal hurdle, which can be established.
 
My thought is that because of the timeframe, it's not impossible, but it's certainly a tougher case in this jurisdiction than it would be in other jurisdictions like New York. So, it's going to be something that needs to be established. And they not only have to prove negligence, they have to prove a willful and wanton disregard for human life. So, a higher legal standard.
 
But Fred, I got to tell you, I'm a trial lawyer, you do not want this poor widow and her children on the stand before a jury because that sympathy factor, this is a tragic case. That's going to go too far. So, my prediction, I think we see a settlement at some point down the road.
 
WHITFIELD: OK. You see a settlement involving all of these defendants, whether it's Google whether, you know, it is that the jurisdictions that would be charged with taking care of this road, whether it was in disrepair, collapsed or otherwise.
 
MARRIS: Correct. I think you see a pool being put together from these defendants, you have multiple defendants, which means there's more resources to put together a settlement here. And in a case like this, a wrongful death case, the damages largely relate to the financial so this gentleman was 47 years old. He has at least 20 years left of working, what were those financials, was their pain and suffering. And of course, for the loss of consortium and services claim that relates to the loss of having this individual in the lives of his wife and his children.
 <br>[13:40:08]
 
So, it's a hefty package.
 
WHITFIELD: Yes.
 
MARRIS: But I did I think, as a trial lawyer, you got to settle this case. It's just the sympathy factor is too high.
 
WHITFIELD: And even along the way, perhaps even before that juncture of settlement or, you know, otherwise, how is it established? What roads are viable? Where's the risk? You know, when and where does the responsibility lie as to whether, you know, if you're Google Maps or any other navigation system to be so updated to know, or have communications with various jurisdictions to know about, you know, the wellness of a road bridge, you know, or transit location?
 
MARRIS: Absolutely, that is a great point. And it goes back to what we were speaking about that notice factor. So, whether or not Google Maps became aware of this dangerous condition, that's the key. That's the critical factor.
 
And Fred, think about it. Every time you're driving in your car, and you're on Waze, there's, there's a mechanism to hit a button and say, there's a barricade here, there's a blockade here. And in this particular case, it's been reported that this dangerous condition was notified to Google Maps. And at that point, there's an obligation to at least conduct an investigation as to whether or not there is a hazard and then update that map.
 
So that's where that obligation comes in. And it's all about what they knew and when.
 
WHITFIELD: Yes. Fascinating. All right, Misty Marris, thanks so much. Great to see you.
 
MARRIS: Thank you.
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Coming up next, we get an exclusive look at a new high speed rail line in Florida from Orlando to Miami. We'll look at the impact it could have for the rest of the country.
 
Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[13:46:11]
 
WHITFIELD: All right, Florida unveils a new high-speed train. Passengers can now travel 125 miles an hour between Orlando and Miami.
 
CNN's Pete Muntean got an exclusive inside look into these trains and how the company behind them plans to expand.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PETE MUNTEAN, CNN TRANSPORTATION CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The trains are polished, the stations are ready and for the first-time passengers are seeing this 125-mile per hour view. The latest extension of Florida's Brightline is now open linking Orlando International Airport to West Palm Beach in two hours, then unto existing service in Miami. Our cameras were the first on board for the final preps before the grand opening.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Welcome to Brightline.
 
MIKE REININGER, CEO, BRIGHTLINE: It's super exciting.
 
MUNTEAN (voice-over): Brightline CEO Mike Reininger tells me this 10- year long effort is only the start. These trains are fast, but Brightline's next project promises even faster speeds above 200 miles per hour. Brightline West would run along Interstate 15 in California from Los Angeles to Las Vegas cutting drive time in half.
 
REININGER: We internally talk about this as version 1.0. Brightline West will be the first true high speed rail system built in America ever.
 
MUNTEAN (voice-over): Plans put Brightline west on par with high-speed trains in Italy and close to the top speed of Shanghai's Maglev. In Japan, bullet trains are clocking speeds of more than 370 miles per hour.
 
RAY LAHOOD, FMR TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY: High speed rail is coming to America.
 
MUNTEAN (voice-over): Ray LaHood served as Transportation Secretary during the Obama administration.
 
LAHOOD: This is not a pipe dream. This is reality.
 
MUNTEAN (voice-over): The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law has devoted $66 billion to rail projects. Brightline once a $3.75 billion grant to break ground on its new project soon. But as a different high speed rail project in California is stalling and costs are soaring. Not everyone is on board.
 
REP. TROY NEHLS (R-TX): This gives high speed rail a bad look.
 
REP. JOHN DUARTE (R-CA): This Mr. Secretary is a useless project.
 
MUNTEAN (voice-over): As it opens in Florida, Brightline is offering two classes of service, $79 one way and its main cars, $149 one way in its premium cars. There are power outlets in every seat, and the bathrooms are way bigger than the airlines.
 
JIM MATTHEWS, CEO, RAIL PASSENGERS ASSOCIATION: A lot of people are going to go to Florida. And maybe they ride that train and they start to say, this is what trains can be like.
 
MUNTEAN (voice-over): The current American Standard Amtrak's Acela can reach 150 miles per hour, but only in a few small segments of the Northeast corridor. For travelers who have already embraced rail, higher speeds can't come soon enough.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We definitely need it.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: High-speed rail would obviously be amazing.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It'd be nice if, if I can get here in half the amount of time. That would be great.
 
MUNTEAN (on-camera): Clearly the hope is this is not the end of the line for high-speed rail. Brightline West is planning to open by the L.A. Olympics in 2028. And I asked Brightline CEO, where else we could see projects like it. He said city pairs that are too short to fly and too long to drive. Think Houston to Dallas or Seattle to Vancouver. A lot of possibilities.

Here's, CNN's Jeanne Moos.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JEANNE MOOS, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): What's a guest to do when you want to check in at the inn, but everybody's out.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We were, you know, saying, hello, good morning. Anybody there?
 
MOOS (voice-over): A merry trio of three best friends.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hello.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hello.
 
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKERS (in unison): Hello.
 
MOOS (voice-over): Tried to check into rooms reserved at the Nashville Airport La Quinta in 5:00 a.m.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Good morning.
 
MOOS (voice-over): They ended up manning the phones and dealing with irate guests.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We have this lady in the lobby screaming about the fact that her charge -- her card was charged $600.
 
MOOS (voice-over): Since all three worked in the service industry dealing with gas came naturally.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And we're like we're so sorry. You know.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're apologizing and we don't even work there.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh God, not the phone again.
 
MOOS (voice-over): Kinsey Brooks found the general manager's phone number and call, but the GM said she was at a convention in California. By 6:00 a.m., it was time for breakfast. So, they served it.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Everybody was filling up in the lobby saying, you know, where's the food?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I found the keys and open up the kitchen. Oh, the cereal bar. They would love that.
 
MOOS (on-camera): So, breakfast went pretty well, right?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, very well. Yes, they were very happy.
 
MOOS (voice-over): A regular employee arrived around 8:00 a.m. But before he could check them in -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He is going to have the audacity to say, OK, well
 
 it's going to be a $25 resort fee.
 
MOOS (voice-over): Finally, the manager of a nearby Holiday Inn showed up, thank the exhausted trio and gave them a room, they opened the door -- 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And there's a naked woman inside.
 
MOOS (voice-over): The parent company Wyndham Resorts told CNN, this incident occurred due to a staff member prematurely leaving an overnight shift not notifying management. The employee was fired.
 
To thank the three, they were given several nights free stay at the Wyndham Resort of their choice. They choose Las Vegas. Maybe they can call the front desk rather than take calls from in front of it.
 
Jeanne Moos, CNN.
 
(on-camera): Did anyone tip you?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No.
 
MOOS (voice-over): New York.

C. ANDRES (on-camera): A croissant?
 
J. ANDRES (on-camera): Oh, what? No.
 
(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
 
ANDRES (on-camera): This is like this amazing dough that is fried, filled with cream.

Tropical Storm Ophelia is bringing heavy rain and powerful winds all across the eastern seaboard as people seal this storm from the Carolinas all the way to New England.
 
Those are power lines exploding in North Carolina where the storm made landfall this morning. And it's also made for some pretty scary situations, like what you're watching right now. The Coast Guard rescue a group of five including three kids from an anchored sailboat Friday evening after the conditions got to be too dangerous for them to stay aboard.
 
Allison Chinchar is tracking Ophelia from the CNN Weather Center, Polo Sandoval is on the New Jersey coast, and Brian Todd is in Alexandria Virginia.
