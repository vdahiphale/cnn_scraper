JIM ACOSTA, CNN ANCHOR:  Good morning. You are live in the CNN Newsroom. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.
 
We do begin the hour with breaking news as yet another powerful hurricane barrels toward Florida. There it is. Milton is now a Category 4 and it's getting stronger quickly. It's aiming directly at the Tampa Bay area and could become a Category 5 storm at some point. Officials are warning of life threatening storm surge and damaging winds to communities still picking up the pieces from Helene. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis gave this warning just moments ago.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL):  We need as much of this debris picked up as possible. This creates a safety hazard and it also will increase the damage that Milton could do with flying debris.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ACOSTA:  Yes, CNN's Derek Van Dam joins us now. I mean, Derek, the governor said it right there. You could have another powerful hurricane come in and slam the coast and lift up this debris and, you know, fly it in a hundred different directions. That does sound like a situation for the residents there.
 
DEREK VAN DAM, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  Yes. Jim, I mean, state is now facing its second major hurricane strike in less than two weeks. That's just incredible. We were on the ground for Hurricane Helene when it came ashore, and we saw the damage that's left over that they are still busy cleaning up, as one would imagine. And now we're facing this real threat which has rapidly intensified now into a major Category 4 hurricane already still in the Bay of Campeche. And it's got a long way to go before it reaches Florida. We'll try to dissect all the information here.
 
But the beauty of the information, the time that we live in is that we get these minute by minute updates really from the National Hurricane Center and the hurricane hunter who fly solely into the eye of the storm to determine just how strong it is getting, and they had in all caps locks and some of their most recent updates. They're experiencing extreme turbulence in the southwest quadrant of the storm and large hail as well.
 
Now, that only happens in some of the most intense -- rapidly intensifying storms. I've flown with the hurricane hunters before, experienced it, when a storm levels off in strength, it doesn't have those properties. So, to put it into context, we're talking nearly 100 miles an hour increase in speed. That's the sustained winds in roughly 30 hours. That is phenomenal, doubling the criteria that we have laid out for rapid intensification.
 
So, where does it go from here? Well, the latest update overnight from the National Hurricane Center has this brushing the Northern Yucatan Peninsula potentially as a low end Category 5. That's still to be determined at the rate that this thing's going. But what's also important about this is that it has slowed down in its forward speed. So, we're anticipating now a later arrival landfalling time late Wednesday into early Thursday, somewhere along the central western gulf coast of the Florida Peninsula.
 
So, when we look at the hazards here, we know catastrophic wind and storm surge are a real threat. But here is Pinellas County. Here is Sarasota. Here is Lee County. Remember what happened with Fort Myers Beach in Hurricane Ian in September 2022? And I got to just squeeze this in here, 8 to 12 feet of storm surge, that's the initial forecast, that's going to eclipse what happened with the storm Hurricane Helene two weeks ago as it moved offshore from Tampa Bay. So, this is going to be significantly more concerning.
 
ACOSTA:  Yes, Derek, it's a very scary situation. We know you're going to be on top of it. Derek Van Dam, thank you very much.
 
Hurricane Milton could make landfall just 12 days after Hurricane Helene ripped through the southeast. And joining me now to talk about this is Keith Turi with FEMA's Office of Response and Recovery. Keith, good morning. Thanks for being with us.
 
What's the agency's plan for dealing with Milton? I mean, you're still dealing with the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. Do you have the resources to deal with both?
 
KEITH TURI, ACTING ASSOCIATE ADMINISTRATOR FOR RESPONSE AND RECOVERY, FEMA:  Yes, we absolutely have the resources to deal with both. I think hurricane response is a team effort, right? We bring in resources from across the entire federal government. We work closely with the state of Florida and the local officials, and we have the resources that we need. There are a number of resources that are still in Florida obviously responding to Helene and then also responding from previous disasters.
 <br>[10:05:04]
 
And so we are in the process right now of pre-staging additional search and rescue teams, additional medical assistance teams, additional ambulances, additional resources that are going to come into the area to make sure that we're ready to support. ACOSTA:  And what about that message from Governor DeSantis a few moments ago? There are these concerns about debris off of the ground after Hurricane Helene. How much of a concern is that going to be if Milton and picking up that debris and throwing it in all sorts of places?
 
TURI:  Yes, it's absolutely an additional consideration. I know the state and the local governments are doing everything they can to get that debris picked up as quickly as they can. We're providing any assistance that we can offer.
 
But storms like this offer a range of hazards. There's going to be storm surge, there's going to be wind there's going to be rain and potential tornadoes. Even without that debris, it's an extremely dangerous storm.
 
And one thing we just really want to stress that storm surge area and those evacuation orders, it's critically important that people follow those evacuation orders. Unfortunately, Hurricane Ian just a few years ago, Hurricane Helene just a few weeks ago, we have seen loss of life in these storms and people need to follow that direction and evacuate if directed to do so.
 
ACOSTA:  And, Keith, I have to ask you, Secretary Mayorkas, the Department of Homeland Security, said last week that your agency does not have enough funding to get through the hurricane season. I know your department has made it clear, your agency has made it clear, you have funding to deal with Helene. But do you h to get through another storm of this magnitude that Milton comes ashore and does the same kind of damage?
 
TURI:  Yes. We have the resources we need for both Helene and Milton. Obviously, big disasters like this create longer term needs and across the federal family. We'll work on those at a later point. But for Helene and for Milton, we have the resources we need. We're executing against that. We're bringing in all the partners and resources that are required. And so that's not a concern.
 
But, again, the message for today, our concern, we know limited time to make sure that people take those life-saving actions. And so that's what we're fully focused on now, making sure we're ready when it hits and making sure we get the message out to take action now to protect yourself and make sure you're ready.
 
ACOSTA:  And just to follow up on Helene, it's been ten days since Hurricane Helene caused all that damage in Western North Carolina and other surrounding areas there in the southeast. We're seeing it could be weeks before people have things like water could be six, seven, we're hearing, in places like Asheville, North Carolina. Can you give us an update on how your agency is dealing with the long-term recovery from Helene?
 
TURI:  Yes. The recovery for Helene, particularly in Western North Carolina, has been very challenging, obviously, from a logistical perspective, the level of flooding that we saw, the impacts to infrastructure, the impacts of transportation have been extraordinary. As you know, our administrator has been on the ground in North Carolina to be able to help oversee those efforts.
 
What we have right now is we have food, water, other commodities that are being brought to people. We have partners of the Department of Defense that are helping go in for get commodities from those locations to people where they may be. And we're working very aggressively with the state and local government to help get those utilities back up and running.
 
In the meantime, we're providing disaster assistance directly to people who need it, and that includes financial assistance or the ability to relocate 1,700 individuals that are in hotels that we've been able to provide them an opportunity to get somewhere safe.
 
So, it's a challenge, but we are fully focused on that with all of our partners and working to get things as stable as possible, as quickly as possible.
 
ACOSTA:  And there's been a lot of misinformation about the storm response. A lot of disinformation, let's be honest, a lot of it coming from former President Donald Trump. How is your agency responding to that disinformation, those lies that have been coming out about the storm response?
 
TURI:  Yes, it's really unfortunate. Obviously, we need folks to want to register with us. We need them to understand what resources are available to them, and when there's misinformation out there or inaccurate information, it really hampers those response and recovery efforts.
 
We're working hard. We have a rumor response page up on our website. We're working with local officials, with state officials, to try to make sure that accurate information gets out there, that you can register for assistance with FEMA, and there is assistance that is available to you.
 
You know, the men and women of FEMA they dedicate their lives and their careers to helping others. That's what they're here to do. And that's what we're going to do for everyone in Helene regardless of any misinformation that's out there.
 
ACOSTA:  All right. We're going to have more on that misinformation and disinformation later on in this program, but in the meantime, Keith Turi, thank you very much for your time, best of luck and all the response efforts in the coming days.
 
TURI:  Thank you.
 
ACOSTA:  All right. And coming up at 11:00 A.M. Tampa Mayor Jane Castor will speak with my colleague, Pamela Brown, about how her city is preparing for Milton as it still is dealing with the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. That's in the next hour. Stay tuned for that.
 
In the meantime, coming up a somber emotional day in Israel, that nation marking one day since the Hamas attacks.
 <br>[10:10:01] (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The process is not something that you can finish in one day, but we're strong. We have each other.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ACOSTA:  We are live in Israel as people are mourning those who were killed and demanding that all the hostages be returned. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ACOSTA:  Today in Israel, remembering a day of infamy and anguish. One year after the October 7th attacks by Hamas terrorists, the pain is still very real for the victims and their families. 1,200 people were killed in the deadliest day for Jewish people since the Holocaust.
 <br>[10:15:01]
 
250 people were taken hostage. 97 are still being held in Gaza.
 
This morning, a siren marked the moment terrorists poured across the border into Gaza at 6:39, excuse me, into Israel, 6:39 A.M. local time. Meanwhile, outside the Jerusalem home of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, families lifted images of loved ones who are still being held.
 
Palestinian families are evacuating after Israel warned of a new ground operation. Some 41,000 people have died in Gaza over this past year. And Israel's fight against Hamas and other Iran-backed groups is escalating.
 
We've got full coverage of today's remembrances. CNN's Jeremy Diamond joins us from where the hostages -- excuse me, the Hostages Square, as it's called, in Tel Aviv, and Arlette Saenz is at the White House.
 
Jeremy, tell us about this commemoration that's happening there today.
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Jim, today has been an opportunity for so many in Israel to commemorate the atrocities that happened on October 7th, to commemorate the lives that were lost. And, of course, to continue to advocate for the 97 hostages who were taken on October 7th, who remain in Gaza today.
 
And not only is it an opportunity for so many Israelis to try and remind the world about the massacre that happened on October 7th that killed about 1,200 people, the majority of whom were civilians, but inside Israel, so many are also seeing this as an opportunity to once again raise the pleas of the hostages being held in Gaza.
 
I just spoke with Aviva Siegel, a former hostage herself, whose husband, Keith, is an American citizen still being held hostage in Gaza, and she told me that there were moments where she thought that she just wanted to die when she was being held hostage, and that was just 51 days. Her husband, Keith, has been held hostage for a year now. And she simply does not know what more she can do to get the leaders of the world, to get the Israeli government to prioritize a hostage deal, to get her husband, Keith, out of Gaza.
 
And so this is -- as this is a country in mourning, it is also one that is continuing to try and advocate and also a country that is very much still at war. And we have been reminded of that time and time again today, as we have heard alert sirens, air raid sirens going off in Southern Israel near the Gaza border as Hamas has fired rockets there, as well as here in Tel Aviv, and, of course, in Northern Israel, where Hezbollah has continued to fire rockets.
 
The Israeli government also continues currently deliberating on a potential response to that ballistic missile barrage from Iran. And so even as this is a country in mourning, a country commemorating a very sad event, it is also one that is still at war and still facing a very, very tense region that does not appear to be stabilizing on year after Israel in response to that October 7th massacre launched its war in Gaza. Jim?
 
ACOSTA:  And, Arlette, how is President Biden marking one year since the attacks?
 
ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Jim, President Biden is commemorating the one year anniversary of those Hamas attacks against Israel, condemning the brutality that took place that day and mourning the loss of civilian lives during that time.
 
Now, President Biden in the coming hour with the first lady will be joined here at the White House with by a rabbi. They will participate in a yard site candle lighting ceremony. That is a tradition in the Jewish faith to really observe the anniversary of a loved one's death.
 
And President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are barking this in their own ways. Harris will be planting a tree with her husband, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, at the Vice President's residence a bit later this afternoon. They will plant a pomegranate tree, which is a symbol of hope and righteousness in Judaism now.
 
President Biden and Vice President Harris and statements this morning renewed their calls for a ceasefire in Gaza to try to return the hostages home and secure an end to this war. President Biden wrote in that statement, quote, we will not stop working to achieve a ceasefire deal in Gaza that brings the hostages home, allows for a surge in humanitarian aid to ease the suffering on the ground, assures Israel security and ends this war. Israelis and Palestinians alike are deserve to live in security, dignity and peace.
 
But so far, there's really been little to no traction in those talks to try to secure a deal. And as Jeremy noted, Israel is now confronting this conflict on multiple fronts. As they battle Hezbollah in Lebanon, as they try to ward off attacks from Iran, President Biden and Harris and their statements both said that they continue to support Israel's right to defend itself in the face of a of attacks from Iran specifically.
 
But President Biden at this moment is trying to commemorate the loss of lives and continue to offer his support to the Israeli people. ACOSTA:  All right. And I'll be talking with one of the families of the hostages coming up in just a few moments from now. Jeremy Diamond and Arlette Saenz, thank you both very much.
 
Let's continue this conversation with Democratic Congressman Jared Moskowitz of Florida.
 <br>[10:20:00]
 
He serves on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
 
Congressman, let's just jump right into this. Do you believe the prime minister is doing enough to secure the release of the remaining hostages? And what are your reflections on this day?
 
REP. JARED MOSKOWITZ (D-FL):  Yes, Jim, thanks for having me. Obviously, you know, one year since October 7th, you know, it reminds me, you know, a little bit of the one year after 9/11, because for Israelis, that's what October 7th was for them. But it's also still not over because you still have hostages being held in Gaza, families still waiting to find out what's happening to their loved ones and the Middle East in turmoil because of what Hamas did on October 7th.
 
You know, as far as the prime minister is concerned, I mean, you know, Israel has had to make the difficult decision about no longer appeasing the situation. They can no longer allow terrorist organizations to be on their border, whether it be Hamas or Hezbollah. With tens of thousands of missiles launching them into Israel whenever they want, making people -- that tens of thousands of people flee their home in the North with Hezbollah, Israel's decided to go and try to degrade those capabilities on their border.
 
I'm for a ceasefire deal in Gaza, but we need to be clear, we're still waiting for Sinwar to accept the deal. Sinwar is the Osama bin Laden of October 7th. And it is Sinwar who has put everyone in Gaza in terrible danger. And it is Sinwar who is refusing to release those hostages because he's worried that he will not survive once he lets those hostages go.
 
And so I hope we can get a deal. Everyone needs a deal. The hostage families need a deal. The innocent civilians in Gaza need a deal. But it is Sinwar, the architect of October 7th, who is holding up that deal.
 
ACOSTA:  And as you know, Congressman, the president has been pretty clear, he's frustrated with the Israeli prime minister and Netanyahu is escalating the fight against these three Iran-backed proxies, Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis. He's vowing to retaliate against Iran for its missile barrage last week. Can anything really be done diplomatically, do you think, in your view at this point, or is this something that militarily is just going to have to play itself out, your sense of it?
 
MOSKOWITZ:  So, I think, militarily, it's going to have to play itself out, but that doesn't mean you can't contain the military action so that you don't have a wider spread war. I think that's where we're at the moment.
 
Obviously, in Israel's position, you can't allow any country to allow 180 ballistic missiles to be launched your way and not retaliate. Obviously, if that happened in a European country, we would expect that European ally to retaliate.
 
And so right now, the whole idea is to make sure that this doesn't spill over and become a regional war. But right now, yes, Israel is going to degrade the military capabilities of Iran and their proxies on their border. That's probably going to go on for another several weeks before we regroup and figure out if there could be some sort of deal to be had.
 
ACOSTA:  And, Congressman, I mean, let's talk about Hurricane Milton because, I mean, we were just talking about Helene last week, and now there's this other powerful hurricane Category 4 churning in the gulf.
 
You served as the director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management. How catastrophic might this be? Are you concerned? I mean, how concerned are you about another powerful storm slamming into your state?
 
MOSKOWITZ:  Well, there are two things that really concern me. One is that what if this does come into the Tampa Bay region -- this is something we haven't seen in a hundred years. You're going to have storm surge. That's going to be something that we haven't seen in 100 years. And there's been a lot of building there in the last a hundred years, a lot of people. 
 
And so I'm deeply concerned about people. They need to leave. They need to evacuate. If they're under evacuation orders, if they live in what you would say Zone A or in mobile homes, and they're being directed by their local emergency manager to evacuate, they should leave. And they don't need to go far. They just need to go inland, away from the coast. So, I'm deeply concerned about this very powerful storm coming into the Tampa Bay region, Pinellas County, all of that.
 
The second thing I'm really concerned about, Jim, is this is not happening in a vacuum. There are five other states that have emergencies going on from Hurricane Helene, North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, and obviously the cleanup that's still going on in Florida. There's going to be a resource issue. There is absolutely going to be a resource issue. We saw it when we had Harvey, Irma and Maria. We had a resource issue to respond, and we're going to see that same resource issue. And we're going to need resources to come all the way from the West Coast to help these communities respond, recover and rebuild. But right now, I'm really worried about loss of life.
 
ACOSTA:  Absolutely. It does look like a powerful storm that's heading towards Tampa Bay. You're absolutely right. And that is a densely populated area, something we're all going to have to keep our eyes on.
 <br>[10:25:00]
 
Congressman Jared Moskowitz, thanks very much for your time. We appreciate it. MOSKOWITZ:  Thank you, Jim.
 
ACOSTA:  All right. Coming up, peddling lies when people need help the most. We're fact-checking two of Donald Trump's biggest lies on FEMA's response to Hurricane Helene. That's coming up.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ACOSTA:  We're following breaking news this morning. Hurricane Milton is now a Category 4 storm and taking aim at the Tampa Bay area. Federal officials are already on the ground across the southeast, helping devastated communities recover and rebuild from crisis Hurricane Helene. But former President Donald Trump continues to push a whirlwind of lies, doubling down on debunked claims about the Biden administration's response.
 <br>[10:30:04]
 
And here's just one example.</pre>
                  </body>
                </html>
