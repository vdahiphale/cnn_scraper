THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:33:13]
 
BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: We just learned that Minnesota Governor Tim Walz's motorcade was involved in a car accident while on the way to a campaign event in Milwaukee. We're told that Walz vehicle, though, was not a part of an apparent pile up. But there were several press vans that were.
 
PAMELA BROWN, CNN HOST: Pool reporters say that some staffers are being treated by medical personnel. And the pool says those staffers were, quote, "violently thrown forward" as one van slammed into another before being hit from behind. At least one staffer appears to have an injury to their arm.
 
KEILAR: All right. San Francisco 49ers rookie, Ricky Pearsall, is out of the hospital recovering at home after being shot during an attempted robbery. 
 
BROWN: He is very lucky to be alive. San Francisco police say Pearsall was shot in the chest by a teenager in broad daylight on Saturday. 
 
CNN's Camila Bernal is here with us for more on this. 
 
Wow, it is extraordinary that he is survived this, Camila. What are the details? 
 
CAMILA BERNAL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. And even his mom saying that he's lucky to be alive. And saying that it was God who protected him.
 
In a Facebook post, she said that bullet went in through his chest and out of his back but missed vital organs. 
 
So here's what happened. It was 3:30 p.m. on Saturday in Union Square in San Francisco. And he's walking alone and a 17-year-old approaches him to try to rob him that gunpoint. 
 
So there's a scuffle, there's an altercation, that gun goes off and it hits both of them. The 17-year-old tries to run away and he is quickly arrested by San Francisco police.
 
The D.A. da in San Francisco saying that the charging decision will either come tomorrow or Wednesday, but it will be in juvenile court because he is 17-years-old.
 
Now, this incident, though, highlights the crime in San Francisco. And in that area, in particular, there have been many break-ins in terms of cars and also in terms of shoplifting in that area. 
 <br>[14:35:04]
 
And so the mayor of San Francisco saying that this is a step back in terms of the work that she's doing. 
 
Take a listen to what she said.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MAYOR LONDON BREED (D-SAN FRANCISO): We are glad that the victim will be OK. But this incident does set us back from all the hard work that we've done in order to make significant changes in public safety in San Francisco.
 
We still have the lowest violent crime rate of any major city. We are on track to have record low numbers of gun violence, in particular, in the city.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BERNAL: And I do want to point some of those numbers that she mentioned because she says that the city numbers indicate that 32 percent the crime has gone down, property crime gone down 32 percent, violent crime gone down 14 percent, gun violence down 38 percent. 
 
And the chief of police saying that this was not targeted because of his football player status, but instead because it was a robbery. 
 
So the person running against her for mayor in the upcoming election saying enough is enough, and saying there needs to be some change in San Francisco because of these high-profile crimes that we've seen in that city.
 
KEILAR: All right, Camila, thank you for that. Camila Bernal, we appreciate the report.
 
And still ahead, just in time for football season, Disney leveraging sports fans as it yanks ABC, ESPN, and other top channels from DirecTV.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:41:00]
 
BROWN: For sports fans with DirecTV, you could call this their black screen of death, right here. It's a message to the company's 11 million subscribers amid a standoff with Disney. And it came as many of them we're trying to watch college football or the U.S. Open yesterday.
 
And it's not just sports channels like ESPN. It is everything under the Disney umbrella, from "National Geographic" to the ABC affiliates where a lot of people get their local news. The channels are all blocked out because of a distribution dispute.
 
CNN media correspondent, Hadas Gold, has all the details -- Hadas? 
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN MEDIA CORRESPONDENT: Pam, if you're a college football fan, if you we're hoping to watch the U.S. Open and you happen to have DirecTV, then you are out of luck on Sunday because it went on a blackout.
 
And that's because of a distribution disagreement between DirecTV and Disney and all of the Disney-owned channels. That includes Disney, but it also includes ESPN, some of the local ABC channels, as well as channels like FX. 
 
This is all because of a disagreement over how much DirecTV has to pay Disney in their contract in order to be able to air Disney channels. 
 
Now DirecTV is saying, listen, the way we watch TV is changing. People are cord cutting. They're creating their own bundles. We want to offer more flexible, cheaper bundles for our customers, so they don't have to pay for channels they don't necessarily want.
 
Disney is saying we are willing to work with you a little bit on that, but they're saying that, listen, it's expensive to have the sports rights, it's expensive for these production costs. So you need to pay the fair price. 
 
Now, DirecTV, in a statement, is saying, "Disney's only magic is forcing prices to go up while simultaneously making its content disappear." 
 
Disney is saying, "While we're open to offering DirecTV flexibility and terms which we've extended to other distributors, we will not enter into an agreement that undervalues our portfolio of television channels and programs." 
 
But the clock is ticking because there are major sports events coming up. Next Monday is the return of "Monday Night Football" on ESPN, which is a Disney-owned channel. 
 
And it's the return of Aaron Rodgers to football after being injured last season. So I'm sure there's a lot of DirecTV subscribers who want to be able to watch that game. 
 
Now, these contract disputes, they always tend to expire right around these sort of big sports moments. That's part of a way to sort of force the issue.
 
Last year, there was a similar feud between Charter and Disney that got worked out literally at the last second. 
 
So there's a good chance that this will get worked out for those sports fans before next Sunday.
 
BROWN: So then how can people watch college football today or tennis or their favorite Disney favorite programming? 
 
GOLD: Well, first of all, Pam, DirecTV says it is offering credits to its customers that are affected by this blackout. 
 
But there are other ways that you can watch things like a sports game. If you're an ESPN fan, there is ESPN-Plus streaming. There's also other sort of streaming cable options, things like Sling and YouTube TV. 
 
But that's a problem for DirecTV, that they could be losing customers by the day as these customers say, well, I can't watch it on DirecTV, so I'm going to sign up for one of these other streaming platforms. And hey, you know, I I'm going -- I'm going to stay there instead. 
 
So there is a big incentive for DirecTV and for Disney to work this out. Because even though more and more people are cutting the cord, these distribution deals still make up the major bulk of revenue and profits for these companies -- Pam?
 
BROWN: Important context about this. 
 
Thank you so much.
 
Brianna? 
 
KEILAR: Now to some of the other headlines that we're watching this hour.
 
The victims killed in a deadly bus crash in Mississippi have now been identified. All we're Mexican nationals and the youngest was just 8- years-old. 
 
Officials say the bus was headed from Atlanta to Mexico when it experienced tire failure causing it to roll over on the interstate. Multiple passengers were ejected and the NTSB is investigating.
 
Also, a new study finds a combination of common blood tests could give women a clearer picture of their heart disease risk decades earlier than current risk assessment calculators. 
 
The study's authors says the blood tests are already widely available and are relatively cheap. We're talking just $10 to $12 per test. And when evaluated together, the tests could predict a woman's chance of having a heart attack or stroke later in life.
 <br>[14:45:02]
 
And see her while you can. Singer, Adele, revealing she plans to take a lengthy break after her Las Vegas residency is up. 
 
In new video from her show, she can be heard telling the crowd, quote, "I have spent the last seven years building a new to life for myself and I want to live it." Adele's Las Vegas residency ends in November.
 
Still ahead, her very real take on the pressures to volunteer in her kids' school is dividing the Internet. The viral Venmo mom joins us next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BROWN: Well, school has started and that means the pressure is on. And I'm not talking about on the kids. We're talking about on the parents, too. 
 <br>[14:50:05]
 
You know what I'm talking about, if you're a parent with kids in school right now, join the PTO, volunteer in the classroom, help with the fundraisers. It seems never ending. 
 
KEILAR: It is never-ending. That's why it seems that way.
 
And one mom's take on the pressure to be involved is now dividing the Internet. Can you imagine? That almost never happens? 
 
And it all started with this. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CASEY NEAL, VENMO MOM WITH 4 CHILDREN: I don't know about anyone else out there, but meet the teacher is super stressful because I do not want to be involved at all. 
 
I don't want to do all that extra (EXPLETIVE DELETED). I don't want to come in. I don't want to set up. If the room needs money for everyone to participate, fine. I'll donate money right over. 
 
I even told one of the coaches today that I am a Venmo mom, so. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BROWN: Thumbs up.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
BROWN: And the self-proclaimed Venmo mom is here. Casey Neal, joining us now. 
 
So, Casey, we went through and we looked at some of the responses. Here's one of them. "Ma'am, I'm a teacher and don't want to be involved in "Meet the Teacher." 
 
Another one, "I'll literally pay for the entire event. Just don't make me actually go."
 
And it's important context here. The surgeon general just issued this new advisory saying parents are stressed out.
 
You have four kids. I don't know how you do it. You work full-time.
 
NEAL: Yes.
 
What was that moment that sort of triggered this? Like, I'm going to get on my phone to talk about this and post it.
 
NEAL: Well, I honestly didn't think that it would go viral. But we just moved to a new county. And I was getting really stressed.
 
Because now that my kid -- my oldest kid is in another school. It was three meets the teachers that day. It was cheer practice after all of that. Then I had baseball practice.
 
And I just was starting to feel super overwhelmed. I've been a parent for 11 years now, and I just -- I'm tired. And I feel like I just kept stretching myself so thin to be there for every single tiny thing.
 
And I was like, when it comes to the PTO and the PTA and the room mom and the team mom, I'm not doing it anymore. I'm not. I don't want to do it. 
 
I appreciate the moms that do want to do it, but I'm personally stretched too thin as it is. I'm not doing it anymore.
 
KEILAR: And it's stressing you out. I mean, that's really -- your schedule makes me tired just sort of thinking about it. 
 
What do you think when you've seen the reaction? Because, on one hand, the reason that it has, I think, divided the Internet is because it's resonated with a lot of people. 
 
Then you've got a lot of people judging you, too. What's it been like? 
 
NEAL: So 90 percent of the feedback s been very positive. It's teachers that are like, listen, some teachers don't even want a room mom. They're like -- they're like they don't want the extra help and they've got it. 
 
I have other moms that are like I'm right there with you. Likem I will send the money and drop off the snacks.
 
And then I have the parents that call me a trash parent or tell me that my kids are missing out and that they're deprived of me not being in the classroom and that I don't care. And those are the farthest things from the truth.
 
BROWN: You're doing the best job you can as a mom of four and working full time. We were just talking about our moms growing up working full-time. 
 
KEILAR: They work full time. And can you see they didn't volunteer in the classroom because --
 
BROWN: Yes.
 
KEILAR: -- they couldn't.
 
BROWN: They couldn't.
 
And also, I wonder if there are more demands now on parents to be like -- NEAL: There is a lot. I'm like I just sent my kids in the last year or two -- like my son just went to kindergarten last year. 
 
And I was like, oh, my god, all these emails after emails after emails about different things and events and class parties, every little thing. And Valentine's Day, that's the worst one. 
 
KEILAR: It does seem like, Casey --
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
KEILAR: -- there are just a lot of demands there. 
 
NEAL: There -- I personally feel like it depends on the county. We're in a new county and I feel like they ask for a lot more than my previous county. I get email after email.
 
And it might just be because I do have four kids. So I get four kids' emails for all the classrooms and it just adds up. 
 
But I do feel like it is a lot. I don't mind donating cash or school supplies, anything that is needed for the teacher or the room mom. I just personally don't want to do it. I'm not a planner.
 
BROWN: So then how do you sort of balance the need to Venmo, which is absolutely right. And there is a need for that. 
 
But also, you know, helping your child and feeling how your child feel like you're showing up, you're there, you're there for them important moments. And what is your advice on setting those boundaries? 
 
NEAL: I mean, honestly, it's just realistically doing what you can do. I don't -- I felt like as a parent I was starting to get burned out because I have three of my kids play sports. 
 
Now. I do attend baseball practices, all the games, the cheer competitions, which happened to be out of state for the most part. I am very active in the after-school activities.
 <br>[14:55:09]
 
It's just the PTO in the PTA. Someone came at me, saying, well, you don't know what's going on in the school. I have a very open line of communication with each of my kids' teachers. 
 
If they need something, they know that I will be the first one to send in whatever they need. Or if they just want me to Venmo them or if it's a room on, like, hey, we need X, Y and Z for a party. And I don't have time to grab it, I'll just get it and be like, here.
 
BROWN: Yes. Right. And my view is no judgement, right? We're all trying to survive. 
 
KEILAR: That's right.
 
BROWN: And as parents -- (CROSSTALK)
 
NEAL: -- be a team effort for sure. 
 
KEILAR: Yes. 
 
BROWN: Yes, absolutely. We should support each other. And we shouldn't feel guilty if we can't make it, to show up. And you know, what if you want to have been (INAUDIBLE) the right to Venmo.
 
Casey Neal, it's great to hear your perspective. 
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
BROWN: I think you channeled a lot of what parents are feeling.
 
KEILAR: Yes, and listen, I'm a room parent, but I'll tell you --
 
BROWN: I do that, honestly. 
 
KEILAR: I just pick my lane. 
 
BROWN: Thank you.
 
KEILAR: But I've gone to the meeting for the room parents and it's like 2 percent men. So before a judge Venmo mom, I'm going to be saying, dads, why don't you join the room parent ranks?
 
BROWN: Wow.
 
KEILAR: And I appreciate those ones who do. Amen to you, sirs, say.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
KEILAR: Casey, thank you so much. 
 
We'll be right back.
