LAILA HARRAK, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome to all of our viewers watching from around the world. I'm Laila Harrak. Head on CNN Newsroom. Drone strikes reported in Moscow, the Kremlin accusing Ukraine of targeting several buildings in the Russian capital. 
 
A race to escape in Greece officials undertake the largest evacuation in Greek history after wildfires ripping across the island of Rhodes forced thousands to flee. Plus, scan cricket crack the United States. We'll talk to the tournament director of Major League Cricket about selling a global sport to American fans.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Live from CNN Center. This is CNN Newsroom with Laila Harrak.
 
HARRAK: Well, we begin this hour in Moscow, where Russia is claiming to have forwarded a Ukrainian drone attack in the early hours of Monday. This video geo located by CNN appears to show one of those drones flying above the city. But defense ministry says it intercepted two of them and that they subsequently crashed in the Russian capital. 
 
Moscow's mayor says no one was hurt but two non-residential buildings were hit. CNN's Clare Sebastian is tracking all the latest developments for you from London. What more have you learned Clare?
 
CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, good morning, Laila. This appears to be the fourth we believe incident of drones being launched in Moscow since early May since we saw that attack on the Kremlin. This like an incident earlier in July, the Russian Ministry of Defense saying that they have actually managed to basically thwart to jam essentially using electronic warfare both of these drones.
 
But we're talking about two locations according to state media one in the center of Moscow. There are road closures reported there apparently debris was found and one towards the south of the city where actually residents are starting to talk about their experience. You can see some damage to a building there. Take a listen to one resident and what she had to say.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
POLINA, MOSCOW RESIDENT (through translator): I was asleep and was woken up by an explosion. Everything started to shake. It felt like the whole building had come down. I looked out of the window. I live in the neighboring building on the side where there's less damage, and it felt strange. The damage was so minor. Well, OK, not minor. Any explosion is scary. 
 
But it sounded worse than it looked as it seemed like the whole mall had exploded. After that, I looked online and saw the amount of damage from this side. And we came in had a look from here.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEBASTINA: So a small amount of Russians that seems experiencing a level of fear in their home city. The Russian Ministry of Defense is overtly blaming Ukraine, saying this was an attempt by the Kyiv regime to launch a terrorist attack. 
 
Now this, of course comes after a week of Russian drone and missile strikes targeting the Black Sea port in particular of Odesa. And that continued overnight, according to Ukraine's Southern Command, with more drone attacks, targeting infrastructure. 
 
Ukraine has not said anything as of yet, Laila, about these drones launched towards Moscow. But President Zelenskyy overnight did say that Ukraine would be responding to those attacks on Odesa.
 
HARRAK: Clare Sebastian reporting on the latest developments. Thank you so much, Clare, as always. 
 
Well, the newly formed NATO-Ukraine Council is expected to meet this Wednesday to discuss security in the Black Sea. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced the dates of the meeting hours after Russia's missile barrage on Odesa over the weekend, which left at least one person dead and 19 wounded. 
 
Officials say the strikes also damaged several more cultural landmarks in the port city, including a historic church and a message to Western allies President Zelenskyy said his country needs stronger air defense systems to protect civilians from Russia's aggression.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOLOYDMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): The target of all these missiles is not just cities, villages are people. Their target is humanity and the foundations of our entire European culture. All this is a global threat. The destruction of cities, the destruction of culture, the destruction of ports that are fundamental to the world's food security. There has never been a terrorist capable of overcoming the world and these Kremlin madmen will not succeed either.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) HARRAK: Well, CNN's Alex Marquardt has more now on the Odesa attack and Ukraine's message to the west.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Odesa is reeling from this fifth wave of attacks by Russia in just the past week. Most of the destruction on Sunday in the early hours was in this historic city center, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A local military official says that some 25 different architectural monuments have been damaged including the Church of the Transfiguration which is a historic cathedral.
 <br>[01:05:06]
 
It was destroyed in 1936 during the Stalin regime and was rebuilt once Ukraine got independence, at least one person was killed. It was a security guard. President Zelenskyy in the wake of this fifth wave of attacks, saying that Ukraine needs a full-fledged sky shield more air defenses from its Western allies, which he says are the only way to defeat Russian terror. 
 
The call for more air defenses is something that we have heard from a number of Ukrainian officials, including the defense minister Oleksii Reznikov, who we spoke to this weekend in an exclusive TV interview. We spoke to him about a wide ranging number of subjects, including the recent NATO Summit in Vilnius, the Ukrainian frustration about not getting a concrete timeline for when they might join NATO. But he also told us that he does have a date in mind for when Ukraine might become a NATO member, take a listen.
 
OLEKSII REZNIKOV, UKRAINIAN DEFENSE MINISTER: It's absolutely understandable that it will be political decision. After then we will win this war, because during this war, we have no options to have unanimous voting, because article number five, and some countries will be reluctant. 
 
But after the victory, after then we will this war, it will be in the interest of NATO. Because we became a real Eastern shield of NATO or Eastern shield of Europe. Ukrainians proved that we have a real combat experience how to deter Russians to defeat them, to beat them, and win using NATO standard weaponry. 
 
So how many arguments they need more?
 
MARQUARDT: Why do you think the United States is not saying the day after this war is over Ukraine will be a member of NATO?
 
REZNIKOV: I think that's not necessary. So what we'll continue providing our reforms during this war time also, but we will continue our reforms. So it means that it will be after one day or two weeks, but my perception next year will be Summit in Washington, DC, 75 years history of this alliance. Who knows maybe it will be very important day for Ukraine.
 
MARQUARDT: You might expect to join NATO in a year's -- REZNIKOV: It just my forecast. 
 
MARQUARDT: Do you think the war will be won by next summer? 
 
REZNIKOV: Yeah. And we will win this war. 
 
MARQUARDT: To win the war, Reznikov tells us Ukraine does need those U.S. made F-16 fighter jets. He says that training for Ukrainian pilots will start next month and it will be in Denmark and the Netherlands possibly the United Kingdom and Poland as well. Not just pilots, but technicians and engineers as well. 
 
That training expected to take at least six months meaning he believes that fighter jets will be in Ukraine by early next year. He thinks those F-16 could be in the skies above the battlefield by next spring. Alex Marquardt, CNN in Kyiv.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HARRAK: Well, after attacking Odesa and quitting a deal that allowed Ukrainian grain to be exported from the city, Russia's president is now offering to replace Ukraine's wheat supplies to Africa. In an article addressed to the continents, Vladimir Putin wrote that his country can provide both commercial and free of charge shipments. 
 
He claimed that the previous Ukrainian New Grain Deal did not offer enough support to nations in need, calling it meaningless for his part. Ukraine says Russia's actions are an attempt to weaponize hunger and destabilize the global food markets. 
 
Well, earlier Ukraine's president spoke with CNN's Fareed Zakaria about his Grain Deal that Russia abandoned. Here's what he said when asked if he's found any way to get shipments out of his country after Moscow's withdrawal.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ZELENSKYY (through translator): We have to look for ways we talked to the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres. Right before this meeting with you, I had a talk with President Erdogan to discuss the crisis, we do see certain ways of going out of it. If we succeed, if Erdogan succeeds, if he is even stronger, I think everything will check OK. 
 
Anyway, everyone has to remember the Black Sea is the sea of all the nations of ours. This is not the sea of the Russian Federation, there is Ukraine, Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria and we are talking to all the countries in the Black Sea region, and we have very substantial pragmatic relations humane and legal relations.
 <br>[01:10:05]
 
And by the way, this is very important. We have legal relations with everyone, but Russia because they think that this is their own sea.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) HARRAK: While the presidents of Russia and Belarus have met in St. Petersburg for talks on several pressing matters, including the war in Ukraine and the short lived mercenary rebellion in Russia. 
 
Well during the meeting, Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko said the Wagner mercenaries, who are now in his country want to go west on a quote, excursion to Poland. It's unclear if he was serious about his comments, but it comes as Poland has been moving extra troops towards the border with Belarus in response to the arrival of the mercenaries. 
 
Meantime, Russian military blogger and ultra nationalist Igor Girkin has been transferred to one of Russia's most notorious prisons. Girkin is facing charges of inciting extremism after blog posts severely criticizing President Vladimir Putin and how Russia is conducting its war on Ukraine. 
 
Gerkin is an ardent supporter of the war but after the Wagner militia leaders a short lived mutiny, the Kremlin and the Russian military are cracking down on dissent from the right. While authority say Girkin is now in a double sell in Moscow's Lefortovo prison awaiting his trial. It's the same prison where Russia is holding Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich.
 
Wildfires are forcing thousands of people to flee from the Greek island of Rhodes. Officials say it's the largest evacuation efforts in the country's history. More than 90,000 tourists and residents have left their homes or hotels on the island some running on foot from the flames while the fires have been burning in the central and southern part of Rhodes since Tuesday. 
 
And a heat wave is making it worse. This is the view now from a Turkish plane, one of several international teams that have come to help Greek fire crews. Officials have set up shelters in hotels schools conference centers on parts of the island where it's still safe. 
 
Well, one tourists told Sky News she and her family were urged to leave her hotel immediately. Or her family would not make it. Another shared her story of survival. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
FAY MORTIMER, BRITISH TOURIST: -- just absolutely. I've never been so scared my entire life. I mean, especially when we went walking down to the beach. One of the locals who was there basically told us that we needed to get away from the corner the situation and obviously when our path goes, as she told us that we were all you know, we're all going to be doomed.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK: Well, Greece's foreign ministry says it will set up a dedicated Help Desk to assist tourists trying to return home and escape has been difficult.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CIP) HELEN PICKERING, BRITISH TOURIST: Was literally crowded full of people as soon as they said there's buses to the airport. We were right. That's it. You know, it was chaos. Absolutely. The surge is towards the two or three buses that arrived and everyone screaming and shouting and crying because people that couldn't even get on their flights yesterday and we're desperate to get home.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK: Our Barbie Nadeau tells us now more about the Greek islands massive evacuation and a warning. This report shows images of dead wildlife.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BARBIE LATZA NADEAU, CNN REPORTER (on camera): We are hearing harrowing stories of survival and escape from the Greek island of Rhodes. Now this is a picture perfect getaway Island normally turquoise sea blue skies. This year it's an entirely different hellish situation for so many tours. 
 
19,000 people so far evacuated between Saturday and Sunday. And these fires now burning since last Tuesday, burning out of control. Some of the stories we've been hearing from survivors. One family with an 11- year-old described running down a dark road a late at night or on two in the morning until trying to reach safety. They said they could actually feel the heat of the fire behind them worried at a certain point that they weren't going to make it.
 
Another family describing how they're the ones that had to tell the hotel that they had to evacuate as the -- as the smoke became so thick they escaped too. Now, these people most of them are making it to the beach area being evacuated by the Greek Coast Guard, by Greek military officials, by private boat, people going there now to try to take people off the island especially this part that's so dangerous.
 
On the other side of the island, it's not affected by the fires yet anyway. We're seeing flights going in, you know, charter flights going in empty just to take people out. What happens to them once they get off the island, many of them are trying to get to the mainland trying to find another place to finish their holidays. 
 
We've got a lot of countries now working to try to get their nationals home. You know, a lot of people had maybe planned a two week vacation now cut short have to, you know, find new tickets find new ways home.
 <br>[01:15:02]
 
All the while the heat continues. The fires burning out of control and it's been a terrible, terrible holiday for a number of people. Barbie Latza Nadeau, Rome.

HARRAK: And to Canada next where the search continues in Nova Scotia for at least four missing flood victims, including two children. Officials say rushing waters swept all four away from the vehicles. Rescuers had to be lowered by chopper to save several other people stranded by the flooding on Saturday. Roads and homes have been damaged as well as a major rail line. It's believed to be the heaviest rainfall in the Halifax region in more than 50 years. 
 
The city's mayor called it biblical proportions of rain three months worth in just 24 hours. There's a state of emergency in effect until August fifth. 
 
And in Afghanistan, dozens of people have been killed and many more injured due to flash floods over the weekend. That's according to the Taliban. While heavy seasonal rains in seven Afghan provinces have damaged or destroyed more than 600 homes and hundreds of acres of farmland. 
 
The Taliban say Afghan families impacted by natural disasters have been receiving food and cash assistance.
 
In northeast China, 10 people have died after the roof of a middle school gym collapsed on Sunday, according to Chinese state media. Rescue efforts are underway with one person reportedly still trapped inside. Authorities say a preliminary investigation reveals construction material on the roof gained weight after being soaked in the rain leading to the collapse. State media reports those in charge of the construction are now in police custody. 
 
Still to come, anger continues on the streets of Israel as lawmakers debate a contentious judicial reform bill. We'll have the latest for you just ahead. 
 
And later, a battle between the U.S. Justice Department and Texas over the state's use of floating border barriers. Look at where things stand right now.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HARRAK: In Israel, thousands continue to protest as the government presses ahead with its controversial judicial overhaul plan. Right now here's a live look. Lawmakers are debating a bill that would curb some of the powers of the Israeli Supreme Court and a vote is expected in the coming hours. 
 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he will attend that key votes. He's been recovering at the hospital after being fitted with a pace maker over the weekend. Well, meantime, the demonstrators who have converged on Jerusalem to oppose the bill say it threatens Israel's democracy.
 <br>[01:20:00]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TZIVIA GUGGENHEIM, PROTESTER: I think if this law passes it's just part of a bigger story of the judicial coup and we're going to be here to fight it, step by step. We're not going home. We're not going anywhere. We're going to be on the streets. We're going to stay on the streets. We were here for half again, we'll be here as long as it takes.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK: CNN's Hadas Gold has more now on what other protesters are saying about the legislation.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Thousands of protesters are once again here in Jerusalem just outside of the Israeli Supreme Court and across the country, both against this judicial overhaul legislation that is currently being debated in the Israeli parliament. 
 
There is a protest in Tel Aviv. That is for the judicial overhaul. These protesters are saying this reform, as they're calling it is sorely needed. But for many of these protesters here in Jerusalem today, they are terrified of what this legislation could mean for the independence of the Israeli judiciary and for what it could mean for the power of the Israeli government because the legislation being debated right now in the Israeli parliament, would strip the ability of the Israeli Supreme Court to declare government actions unreasonable saying that they just wouldn't be able to say that a government action should not be able to take place.
 
Now, the coalition government led by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, they want to take that ability away. And this is just one part of this massive judicial overhaul package that the Israeli government is trying to push through that would completely reshape the Israeli judiciary. And that's why you have these protesters that have been out for six months now on the streets, but their protests are really ramped up in recent days because this legislation is now officially on the table. 
 
If this legislation passes will be the first part of this overhaul package that will finally and officially pass and could potentially turn into law. The protests here in Jerusalem have been ongoing for days they even marched from Tel Aviv into Jerusalem. And then they actually also set up a tent city in one of the largest parks in Jerusalem where they say that they will camp out until for as long as necessary until this legislation is off the table. 
 
But the governing coalition led by Benjamin Netanyahu are showing no signs of backing down saying that the vote will take place this despite the pleas not only from these protesters, but pressure from the US. The Israeli President Isaac Hertzog just returning from the United States and going actually straight to the hospital, where Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is hospitalized because he's being fitted with a pacemaker. All of this happening of course, at the same time, in the middle of the night, on Saturday night.
 
The Prime Minister's Office announcing that Benjamin Netanyahu was being fitted with a pacemaker for a heart problem. But that doesn't stop politics here. And the Israeli President driving straight to the hospital to have an emergency meeting with the Prime Minister to try and convince him to slow down the legislation to come to some sort of compromise. 
 
But all signs are pointing that this vote will take place on Monday, and it could be the beginning of the complete reshaping of the Israeli judiciary. This of course, also happening while thousands of Israeli military reservists are threatening not to serve if this legislation passes that could have major implications for Israel's military readiness, a lot happening in politics and as of right now, all at the same time. Hadas Gold, CNN, Jerusalem.

HARRAK: Authorities in Mexico say five migrants from Colombia and Peru have been rescued from a mountain pass near the U.S. border after they were abandoned by their guide. Mexico's National Institutes of migration says a 15 hour operation was launched last week after one of the migrants phoned authorities for help, saying they had no food or water. One minor was among the group. They were taken to a shelter in Tijuana after their rescue.
 
Texas Governor Greg Abbott says his state has the sovereign authority to defend its border as it faces a Monday deadline to commit to removing floating barriers on the Rio Grande. That's deadline was set by the U.S. Justice Department which has warned the state could face legal action. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez has details from the White House.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER (on camera): The Justice Department has given Texas Governor Greg Abbott until Monday afternoon to tell the administration whether he is going to remove the floating barriers along the Rio Grande, it's the latest escalation in the feud between President Joe Biden and Texas Governor Greg Abbott, over the handling of the U.S.-Mexico border. 
 
In a letter on Thursday, the Justice Department said that Texas did not have authorization to set up the floating barriers this month, citing a clause in the law to that effect. They also went on to say quote the state of Texas actions violate federal law, raise humanitarian concerns, presents serious risks to public safety and the environment and may interfere with the federal government's ability to carry out its official duties. 
 
Now officials have been talking for months within the administration as to what actions of any could be taken by the Justice Department as they watched with concern the actions the Texas governor was taking along the Texas-Mexico border. Those floating barriers had for example pose a potential drowning risk to migrants who are caught are crossing.
 <br>[01:25:04]
 
Now, the Texas governor in a tweet said that it is the sovereign authority to defend our border. So he is standing firm on his position to keep those barriers. But again, he can reply by Monday afternoon as to whether or not he will take them down. If not, the Justice Department says in their letter, they're ready to take the Texas governor to court.

HARRAK: Spain is almost done counting votes from its snap election but who will lead the country is still very unclear. A look at where things could go next ahead on CNN Newsroom.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HARRAK: Welcome back to our viewers all around the world. I'm Laila Harrak. And this is CNN Newsroom. With more than 99 percent of the vote count it there is no clear winner in Spain snap elections. The center right People's Party is set to come in first winning 136 seats in parliament. But in order to govern a party or coalition must have a working majority of 176 seats in the 350 seat legislature. 
 
And because no single party won enough seats to form a government on their own, the tough task of trying to build a coalition must now begin. Well, that process could be more complicated than it seemed before the votes, and Pau Mosquera has more now from Madrid.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PAU MOSQUERA, CNNE SPAIN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): As predicted by previous polls conservative Popular Party won the general elections in Spain by securing 136 seats in the parliament. Nevertheless, this result won't allow their leader Alberto Nunez Feijoo to rule alone. So negotiating it's going to be key as to form a new government. 
 
One of the most probable alliances is the one with far right Vox Party. But again, having the results of the come would neither make possible and now right majority. Santiago Abascal party got a total of 33 seats in Parliament, which may keep them seven seats away from an absolute majority. 
 
On the other hand, the Socialist Party is celebrated their second position and these elections not because they had a good result but because they will somehow block Popular Party and Vox from rolling together with 122 seats. 
 
They may try to get support from meaner and regional parties as to get Pedro Sanchez back in office. 
 
 [01:30:00] 
 
Left-wing platform Sumar would be one of those allies with their 31 seats. Though more support would be needed. 
 
In summary, as none of the main political parties in Spain got enough seats in the parliament, negotiating and getting the support of other parties is going to be key and mandatory as to clear the path for a new government. 
 
Pau Mosquera, CNN -- Madrid. (END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HARRAK: Aitor Hernandez-Morales is the Iberian affairs correspondent for Politico. And he joins me now from the Spanish capital, Madrid. So good to have you back with us, Aitor. Good morning. 
 
What message are voters in Spain sending with this result? 
 
AITOR HERNANDEZ-MORALES, IBERIAN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT, POLITICO: It is really remarkable turnaround. What we're seeing here is an unbelievable comeback for Sanchez who is basically, everyone had accepted that he would be out, that he would be leaving the head of government in Spain by the end of this year. But instead what we are finding is a situation where the Spanish public has come out and said pretty clearly that one, they want to continue this new era for Spain which is one of a more fractious parliament, one where they demand that deals be made between parties of many different colors of ideologies. 
 
But more importantly, they seem to have come up clearly against having a right-wing government with far right members. And that, as your correspondent was explaining before is why we're looking at a parliament where it's virtually impossible for the center right Popular Party, the party that won the most votes to be able to form a government. 
 
Basically, its one option would've been with the far right Vox party. But because they don't reach that governing majority and because the rest of the parties in the parliament refused to support a government with far-right members, they're basically out of options. 
 
HARRAK: Well, what's the plan going forward? It's a bit of an unfair question to pose that to you. But what are the challenges ahead and opportunities potentially for the two largest parties to maybe work together and generate unity?
 
HERNANDEZ-MORALES: That's virtually impossible. Spain has no history of forming grand coalitions. And I don't expect that that will be changing any time soon. The country is extremely polarized right now. We're talking about levels that are very similar to the U.S. 
 
So it would be inconceivable for the Popular Party and the Socialists to come to some sort of agreement that would facilitate government in that way. 
 
What is more likely is that Sanchez will form a left wing coalition government with the left wing Sumar Party and then seek support from smaller regional parties in the parliament to govern. 
 
Now, it's a bit of a risk against time. The parliament reconvenes on August 17th, by August 21st Sanchez will have to meet with the Spanish king and make a bid to be the next prime minister. 
 
And in order to do that he will have to prove that he has enough support to at least take that bid to the parliament. In the parliament he will have to get more yes than no votes. And it's a key to remember here that MPs in the Spanish parliament can abstain. 
 
So he has a shot but he's going to probably need outright support from some Basque (ph) and Catalan separatist groups. And most importantly, he's going to have to convince one Catalan group to abstain. That group is led by a former Catalan politician who had to flee the country after the 2017 independence referendum. 
 
So Sanchez will have to move quickly and be extremely diplomatic if he wants to continue being prime minister in the longer term. 
 
HARRAK: So did it pay off for Mr. Sanchez to call these elections early? Or is it too early to tell? 
 
HERNANDEZ-MORALES: I would say so Because one way or another we're looking at a scenario where Pedro Sanchez is going to remain Spain's prime minister at least to the end of the year. It's -- as we mentioned before -- impossible for the Popular Party to form any government that we can think of. 
 
So right now Pedro Sanchez is at least (INAUDIBLE) key to remain as caretaker prime minister whilst Spain tries to form a new government. 
 
Realistically speaking if he fails at that mission Spain would go to new elections at the end of this year beginning of 2024. And in the meanwhile, he remains in his position. 
 
If he can manage to gather enough support and win the second investiture vote in the parliament, which would take place at some point in September, Sanchez is looking at another four years in office. 
 
So his gamble has paid off. 
 
HARRAK: And if that doesn't come to pass, do you expect voters to head back to the polls and do this all over again? 
 
HERNANDEZ-MORALES: Indeed. So the timeline right now is that if everything fails and there's no way to form a government voters will go back to the polls at the end of 2023, beginning of 2024. 
 <br>[01:34:53]
 
HERNANDEZ-MORALES: And there we could realistically see a possibility where the Popular Party would make a bid to get an outright majority on its own. And it's very possible that a lot of voters that have voted for the far-right Vox Party would decide then to switch their vote to the Popular Party to guarantee that it's in power. 
 
One important thing to note here is that the worries were that Spain was going to end up with a government with far-right members. What we've seen, however, is that they have -- the far-right has not managed to get into governor and more importantly its numbers are dwindling. 
 
In the last parliament they had 52 seats and now -- 52 seats, now they are down to 33. So that's a pretty significant drop. And it does signal that things may be changing in Spain. 
 
HARRAK: Final thoughts from you, Aitor. What does this all mean for the European Union and, of course you know, Spain is a very significant country within the block. 
 
HERNANDEZ-MORALES: Well, Brussels is probably sighing with relief this morning considering that there were a lot of concerns about the possibility of having to deal with that sort of right wing government with far-right members. Vox is explicitly Euro skeptic party and one of the things that it had said was that it would seek to challenge the privacy of the E.U.'s courts which right now has the final say over Spanish law. 
 
So I would expect that the European Union's leaders are delighted with this outcome. 
 
HARRAK: And Spain is holding the presidency at the moment. So it's a win-win I guess. 
 
HERNANDEZ-MORALES: Indeed, yes.
 
So there will be a bit more stability, at least. 
 
HARRAK: All right. Aitor Hernandez-Morales, thank you so much for coming back on. Greatly appreciate it, thank you. 
 
HERNANDEZ-MORALES: Happy to do it.
 
HARRAK: Now we head to Asia. In Cambodia prime minister -- the prime minister there of the country's ruling party has declared a landslide victory in the general election. The party spokesperson said on Sunday, that they have won but can't calculate the number of seats yet. 
 
The contest was effectively a one-horse race with the prime minister's party facing no opponents after a ruthless years-long crackdown on its rival. 
 
The only opponent with any real clout was disqualified from running. Critics have dismissed the election as a sham aimed at cementing the party's rule before an expected transfer of power to the prime minister's son. 
 
While hundreds of demonstrators gathered in Thailand Sunday in support of the leader of the Move Forward Party. The protests come as conservative opponents foiled his latest attempt to become prime minister. 
 
Move Forward won the main election but parliament has twice stopped the party's leader from becoming the country's prime minister. 
 
Under the country's constitution, the prime minister must earn more than half the votes in the legislature, which includes 249 members appointed in 2014 by the military junta. 
 
Another vote on the premiership is scheduled for Thursday. A senior U.S. general in South Korea is set to offer new information
 
 in the coming hours on the U.S. army private who suddenly ran into North Korea. 
 
Travis King's whereabouts and condition inside of North Korea are still unknown nearly a week after he bolted across the border from the Truce Village at the DMZ. 
 
Well King had been facing transfer back to the United States after being convicted of assault in South Korea. Military officials say it's not clear why he willfully crossed into the North without any authorization to do so. 
 
Travis King is far from the only American held by North Korea over the years. Experts are looking at how Pyongyang treated earlier American prisoners to try and figure out how they might be handling King. 
 
CNN's Brian Todd has that part of the story from Washington. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Travis King joins a sobering list of Americans who've been held by the oppressive Kim regime in North Korea. One of the best known among them, college student Otto Warmbier, arrested in 2016 while on a tour of North Korea, for trying to steal a propaganda poster from his hotel in Pyongyang. 
 
GREG SCARLATOIU, COMMITTEE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN NORTH KOREA: He was arrested, and imprisoned for something that, if true, would barely amount to a college frat prank anywhere in the half-decent world. 
 
TODD: Warmbier was sentenced to hard labor, shortly after his sentencing, he went into a coma. He was hurriedly released by the North Koreans after 17 months in captivity and died at age 22, just a few days after being returned home to Ohio. 
 
One of the Americans held longest inside the Hermit Kingdom? Missionary Kenneth Bae, detained for just over two years. He told CNN after he was released about his years of hard labor in a camp. 
 
KENNETH BAE, FORMER DETAINEE IN NORTH KOREA: We're working on the field, doing the farming, labor and carrying rocks and shoveling coal.
 
TODD: American journalists, Euna Lee and Laura Ling were arrested in North Korea in 2009. It took a high-profile mission by former president, Bill Clinton to North Korea to get them out. 
 <br>[01:39:58]
 
LAURA LING, FORMER DETAINEE IN NORTH KOREA: We fear that, at any moment, we could be sent to a hard labor camp. 
 
TODD: Analysts say if these cases are any guide, Travis King could be interrogated, possibly tortured, placed in hard labor. Or -- 
 
AMBASSADOR JOSEPH DETRANI, FORMER U.S. SPECIAL ENVOY TO NORTH KOREA: I think they're going to look at the credibility of the individual. Can they use them as a propaganda tool. 
 
TODD: It's happened before.  
 
American soldier, James Dresnok, defected to North Korea in 1962. Dresnok and his son, now adult, who still have never left North Korea acted in North Korean propaganda movies, playing the evil American. 
 
SCARLATOIU: Do I see Travis King as a new James Dresnok? Not really.
 
TODD: Why?
 
SCARLATOIU: These are different times. This is a young man who is used to being on his phone, being on his Internet, probably playing video games. 
 
TODD: Human rights monitor Greg Scarlatoiu advises Travis King's family to use the same tactics that the families of Otto Warmbier, Kenneth Bae and other Americans who were detained in North Korea used. To keep their story in the media. Don't let the public forget about him. 
 
Scarlatoiu says it's possible that another high level American could be sent to North Korea to get Travis King out but he says that all depends on whether King actually wants to leave.

HARRAK: Up next, a look at Sunday's action in the Women's World Cup as another day of matches are set to kick off soon. 
 
Plus Major League Cricket attempts to stake its claim in the United States. How the league is trying to take the sport mainstream in America, when we return. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HARRAK: We are just minutes away from the start of the next Women's World Cup match, as Italy and Argentina are set to take the field. Well, this after a dramatic day of play in the tournament on Sunday. 
 
CNN's Don Riddell has the highlights. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DON RIDDELL, CNN WORLD SPORT ANCHOR: Just 8 teams now of the 32 competing at the Women's World Cup are still waiting to play their opening matches. And so far the games that we've seen have been pretty close. 
 
Is that a sign that there is not more parity in a game that has been rapidly expanding across the globe or perhaps nerves have been playing a factor in the early action. 
 
On Sunday in Wellington, South Africa are going for their ever first cup result and they cam pretty close against Sweden who are the world's third rank team.
 
Hildah Magaia opened the scoring for South Africa, early in the second half. But Sweden responded by pouring more players into their attack. And they were rewarded when Frida Ostberg's (ph) the effort was deflected in their own goal. 
 
South Africa had lost all three of their previous World Cup matches. They would've settled for a point here, but it wasn't to be. As Amanda Ilestedt scored a last minute winner. The Swedes just edged it, going top in Group G. 
 
In Group E, the 2017 European champions the Netherlands shaded the World Cup debutantes Portugal by (INAUDIBLE). Stefanie Van Der Gragt first half header turned out to be the winner. 
 <br>[01:45:00]
 
RIDDELL: Portugal only had one short on goals throughout the entire match. The Dutch will play the U.S.A., the defending champions next. That is a repeat of the 2019 final. 
 
Also on Sunday, a massive result for the Reggae Girlz of Jamaica who went toe to toe with one of the best teams in the world, the fifth rank France. Jamaica's players really struggled to get into this tournament. They had to start a GoFundMe page in order to make all the ends meet and make the trip to Australia and New Zealand. And they repaid everyone who believed in them with their first World Cup point. 
 
The French team have made it to the quarterfinal (INAUDIBLE) to last World Cups but they are expected to go deeper this time. But this really was a frustrating experience for them. 
 
(INAUDIBLE) peppered the goal with a couple of headers, and she also hit the frame of the goal later (ph) on. But they couldn't break down the Jamaica team who celebrated wildly, at the final whistle, celebrating a monumental performance and the massive result. 
 
Their manager put into perspective just how significant an achievement this was. 
 
LORNE DONALDSON, JAMAICA COACH: I would say it's the number one result that we have had so far because you know, I mean, you know, you're playing a team like France who are just fantastic. And you know, you know, it's -- to be, to answer, I think it's the number one result I have seen, men or women. So I would put it there. 
 
RIDDELL: We'll, of course, keep you posted with all the latest highlights and results from the Women's World Cup. But for now, it's back to you.

HARRAK: Our thanks to Don Riddell.
 
A new professional cricket league is attempting to bring the sport to a wider audience in the U.S. Major League Cricket has set up shop in Texas where six teams have been playing in matches in July, fighting for recognition amidst the season's most popular sport, baseball. 
 
And despite the heat, fans are turning out to support their favorite teams. The league's first ever championship final is set for this coming Sunday. 
 
Joining me now, Justin Geale is the tournament director for Major League Cricket. 
 
So good to have you with us Justin. How is it going so far? America's new Cricket League underway, did you get off to a good start? Are people coming to watch the games. Can you tell us how much interest games are attracting right now? 
 
JUSTIN GEALE, TOURNAMENT DIRECTOR, MAJOR LEAGUE CRICKET: Yes, we've been playing a lot, actually. I mean you plan and plan these things on paper and you hope it will work and it turns out it did. 
 
So we are wrapped. We've just finishing the matches 12 and 13 today, and I think in North Carolina, and they were (INAUDIBLE). It's a small venue, but we've had 3,000 screaming fans waving flags and cheering on their heroes and getting autographs and, yes, the traction we have had not just in America but around the world has been amazing to be honest. 
 
HARRAK: Now, let's focus in terms on how you are planning on going about convincing Americans to embrace cricket. Getting them so excited about what is a global game, obviously. What is your pitch to a potential untapped fan base here in America? 
 
GEALE: Yes, I've been working on it for a while. I married an American last year, so I have a bit of practice. 
 
We're the second largest sport in the world, and obviously to America's the largest sporting media market in the world. So we think the synergy is there. 
 
It is an exciting game and I love baseball, don't get me wrong. But I think it's a lot more high scoring and it's sort of 360 baseball, 120 pitches in a game. There is probably maybe 20, 25 home run equivalence in the game. 
 
So I think the American sports consumer is a very sophisticated one, and it takes a little time to explain the nuance, but once they get in, we think they're really going to love it. 
 
HARRAK: Now, you know, as you point out, I mean this is such a sports mad nation. And this is not the first time that cricket has been promoted in the U.S., but previous attempts unfortunately failed to gain traction. What makes this time different? 
 
GEALE: Yes, I think the plans are aligned. The biggest challenge we have is infrastructure. We need a big bit of space to play cricket, and it turns out building stadiums are expensive and the places you want to do it to try and find that space is hard. 
 
So no one has gotten this far. We launched a stadium in Dallas and we took the Minor League Baseball stadium and cut out the foul ball lines, and we put in a big oval. So we've actually got somewhere to play now that represents the game. So I think that is probably the key to where we are now. 
 
I think, you know, MLS has taken 20 years to be an overnight success. I think we can get there a bit quicker only because of the quality of players we can attract. We have some of the best players in the world here now playing in North Carolina, in a public park. 
 
So I think we are giving ourselves the best chance to showcase the best product we possibly can, and when people see it, you know, they love it. 
 <br>[01:49:59]
 
HARRAK: And in terms of, I mean you mentioned of course, MLS, it took them 20 years and they are still working on it. How do you measure success in the short term? 
 
GEALE: Yes. We get that question a lot. I think, you know, if we can showcase the quality product, we can do quality production, which we managed to do. We could put those pictures out domestically to America and the world, just to show this is going to work. And the crowds have been phenomenal. 
 
You know, we've been selling out Dallas, which is 7,000. And we've been selling out pretty easily. And people are coming, and they're coming back because they are having such a good time. 
 
Sol I think the proof of concept is there. Now we just need to find the venues across the country where we can take the game to local markets, really. 
 
HARRAK: And, Justin, how can people now watch a game? What kind of access do people have? 
 
GEALE: Yes, for sure. Obviously we are pushing out pretty heavily through socials in the U.S. We go through Willow, which is a consumer -- direct to consumer sort of cable channel for cricket. We also have got three games live on CBS tomorrow night, CBS Sports across the country is showing, Monday night cricket, which we are excited about. 
 
I think we are probably in about 30 countries worldwide, to be honest. And the global numbers are phenomenal, which is great. 
 
But honestly, we want to grow the game here in America, that is why we are playing in American time slot. We have a lot of connections around the world, particularly India and the sub continent and you know, colonial places like Australia and England, but we really want to grow the game here. 
 
HARRAK: Before I let you go, I mean are there days where you think, it is just so daunting the challenges? 
 
GEALE: I would like to say I had before I started. It is hard, but (INAUDIBLE) is hard but it is so rewarding. And just today, the number of people who have come up to me that have traveled from Virginia, from Washington, from New York here on the East Coast to come and see a game is so heartening. 
 
And you know, I think this craze you mentioned just might work. 
 
HARRAK: All right. Justin Geale, thank you so much for the conversation and we wish you all the best. 
 
GEALE: Thanks Laila. I'll see you later. 
 
HARRAK: Still to come, temperatures soar across the Middle East, forcing people to get creative to keep themselves and their animals cool now. How they are beating the heat, when we return. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HARRAK: Residents throughout the Middle East and northern Africa are finding it hard to cool off amid a scorching heat wave sweeping through the region. Well, some have figured out ways to lessen the impact of the soaring temperatures, but many are finding the heat too much to bear.
 
CNN's Michael Holmes reports. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: On any given day, hauling sacks of wheat in Syria is backbreaking work. But some workers say the oppressive heat makes the loads feel that much heavier. 
 
MOHAMMAD AL-AHMED, SYRIAN WORKER (through translator): we're suffering from the high temperatures, but we're force d to be here. We have to feed our families. We cannot survive if we don't work. 
 
HOLMES: Getting enough drinking water in this town, in the northeast of the country, is also hard work. 
 
Even before the heat wave, aid agencies reported that many households had insufficient access to water. These women lineup to fill their containers from a local tank, they too complain that it is just too hot. 
 <br>[01:55:01]
 
HAYAT HAMOUD, HASAKAH, SYRIA RESIDENT (through translator): the temperature's exceeding 42 degrees Celsius. We are dying from the heat. Moreover, we are transporting water in the heat at 60 years old. 
 
HOLMES: Across the Middle East, July and August are normally the hottest months of the calendar. Some countries enduring long stretches of extreme temperatures. But this year not even halfway through the summer peak period, forecasters say they are already seeing red flags. 
 
According to the National Weather Service, one airport in Iran recorded a heat index of nearly 68 degrees Celsius on Sunday, or 154 degrees Fahrenheit. Experts say that is so high, it would be difficult for human bodies to properly function. 
 
For years, Iraq has been paralyzed by high summer temperatures, the sizzling heat striking again in Baghdad, temperatures hovering near or above 47 degrees Celsius over the last few days.
 
Air conditioners and misting fans help to cool people down, but power cuts in the city make it hard to run them around the clock without a generator. 
 
The heat wave extending to Egypt, too, with temperatures in Cairo expected to top 40 degrees Celsius through mid week. City trains and metro lines are operating at reduced speeds to avoid any problems from the high heat. 
 
There have been power cuts here too, though some residents have found simpler ways to chill out. 
 
AHMED HASSAN, CAIRO EGYPT RESIDENT (through translator): The heat wave this year is stronger than any other year. We tried to stay in the shade more, drink more water, and eat more iced food, drinks, and ice cream. 
 
HOLMES: Many people preferring to stray off the streets in other cities. In Doha, this delivery driver, one of the few to brave the heat. He says that he is grateful his company allows him to use a car during the hottest parts of the day. 
 
Qatar banned the use of motorcycles for deliveries last year during certain hours to protect drivers from the torrid (ph) temperatures. 
 
In nearby Dubai, some beaches have opened at night, so people can take a dip when it is cool enough to enjoy it. A welcome break from the sun's glare that in so many places right now, is just too hot to handle.
