DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, I think the main thing here to say about the cease-fire, is that it's a cease- fire in name the only. And we could talk about what the generals are saying on the paramilitary forces and the armed forces of Sudan. But in reality, there is no cease fire. There's been repeated clashes in Khartoum overnight and in the morning according to eyewitnesses we have been speaking to. 
 
And you're right, the health system in Sudan, Bianca, is often shaky. In Khartoum, they you have some world class hospitals but more than two-thirds of the hospitals are shut by the fighting. And doctors are dealing with awful conditions, running out of everything and they are just trying their best to save lives. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MCKENZIE (voice over): A brave Sudanese doctor takes us inside a frontline hospital in Khartoum, filming over several days.
 
Dr. Howida AlHassan and her team are barely coping at Alban Gadid Hospital. They talk about ceasefire, but there is no ceasefire. The wounded keep coming in, she narrates. The same staff have been here for 11 days. They're facing a deluge of civilian victims, many with multiple gunshot wounds, wiping away the blood because the casualties never stop.
 
My son was wounded, says this man. I had come because many hospitals aren't working.
 
DR. HOWIDA ALHASSAN, ALBAN GADID HOSPITAL (through translator): I'm astonished how we're able to continue. We don't sleep. I wouldn't call what we do sleeping. I would call it fainting. We faint, then we wake up again. I'm surprised how we are managing.
 
MCKENZIE (voice-over): Doctor Howida says everything is running out. They're giving smaller doses of medicine to ration their supply.
 
We use the equipment and the instruments more than once, she says. We can't sterilize properly. There are just too many wounded. ALHASSAN (through translator): Soon we'll have no bandages, no medication, no anesthetic drugs and no oxygen. The situation is bad, with all the meanings of the word.
 
MCKENZIE (voice-over): Bad and it will get worse, unless help comes soon or the fighting stops.
 
Sudan's doctors' union says that more than two thirds of hospitals are shut in the capital. Eyewitnesses and doctors' groups say hospitals are being targeted with heavy weapons by both sides, which they deny.
 
As foreign governments spirit their diplomats and nationals out of Sudan, Dr. Howida says her conscience compels her to stay.
 
ALHASSAN (through translator): I believe the number of casualties and wounded will increase after the foreigners are evacuated. God knows if we will be alive or dead.
 
MCKENZIE (voice-over): Sudanese blood is one blood, she told us. I beg you to silence the sound of the rifles.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
MCKENZIE (on camera): Well, we spoke to Dr. Howida just this morning. She says that they've run out of oxygen at that hospital. They're running out of supplies. The international Red Cross say they tried to get supplies into some hospitals. They were stopped by armed men. And I think this is an issue facing many different hospitals across the country and especially in the capital. 
 
And if you consider that they've had to bring in youths from the neighborhood in that eastern part of Khartoum just to protect the hospital from looting. And they say that other parts of that capital, there are armed men inside of hospitals. It's just a total breakdown of the capital and if it drags on for several more days -- and, frankly, there is no sign that a cease-fire will be holding any time soon, at least for now, you're going to see almost a worst-case scenario for those in that hospital and in that city -- Bianca, Max. 
 
NOBILO: David McKenzie in Johannesburg, thank you. 
 
China's President Xi Jinping has spoken by phone with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy for the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine. 
 
FOSTER: Mr. Zelenskyy called it a meaningful conversation and agreed to exchange ambassadors with Beijing. But the Chinese government readout never even mentioned Russia and refer to the war as the Ukraine crisis. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Today, I had a long and mostly reasonable conversation with the leader of China. Typically, these types of talks are seen as a chance to create new opportunities. Right now, there is an opportunity to give new energy to the relations between Ukraine and China.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
FOSTER: Military experts are wondering what Russia is up to after looking at satellite images of a key military base in northern Crimea. This picture was taken in February showing dozens of tanks and other military vehicles there. 
 
NOBILO: But in this imagine from late March, all of that equipment is gone. 
 <br>[04:35:00]
 
It's unclear whether the vehicles were moved to or why, but local pro- Russian officials suggest a expected Ukrainian counteroffensive that could target that area. 
 
FOSTER: Let's bring in CNN's Beijing bureau chief Steven Jiang and also here in London Nada Bashir. First of all, to you Steven. And this call between Zelenskyy and Xi, it's highly significant, isn't it? And says a lot about Xi's, you know, position on the world stage currently. 
 
STEVEN JIANG, CNN BEIJING BUREAU CHIEF: Yes, Max, it's symbolically very significant. Remember, this had been rumored for a long time. Especially after Xi came back from Moscow after he visited with Putin last month. And especially after that flurry of diplomatic visits to Beijing by European leaders. You have Macron and von der Leyen. 
 
On top of that, you have this growing desire by China to be seen as a global peace maker following that deal, they brokered between the Saudi's and Iranians. So, it's in this broader context that we finally saw this highly anticipated call take place. That's also why some analysts see this call as a reward from Beijing to Europe's willingness to engage with China on this issue. 
 
But let's not forget what just happened in the past few days. The Chinese ambassador to France causing an uproar across Europe when he requested on live French television the legality of the sovereignty of former Soviet states. Even though Beijing has since said, disowned those remarks but damage has been done. So, the need for damage control may have finally tipped the scales in favor of this rather modest gesture, according to some analysts. That's why we finally saw this call on Wednesday. 
 
Now, of course, Xi reiterated a lot of China's longstanding talking points but he did pledge for the first time to send a special envoy to Ukraine and other regional countries to discuss, quote, unquote, a political settlement. 
 
But even state media here has acknowledged nothing is likely to change and in the short-term given the chasm between Ukraine and Russia on their positions. And adverse states going to take a lot more than a phone call to convince China skeptics and critics in Europe about that it's now serious to play an unbiased role despite that no limit partnership with Russia. And -- but one thing this call does indicate, of course, is China is
 
 now willing, at least, to engage with Ukraine more regularly and it's definitely trying to show Europe that it wants to play a more active and constructive role in ending this war. And Europe, of course, is increasingly a battlefield in the strategic rivalry between China and the United States -- Max and Bianca. 
 
FOSTER: OK, Steven, thank you. 
 
NOBILO: And CNN's Nada Bashir is here covering the latest developments for us in Ukraine. Nada, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said at the beginning of the year that 2023 would mark Ukraine's victory against Russia. Is what we are seeing on the battlefield suggest that that's a possibility? 
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER: Well look, the war is certainly still grinding on and we have seen an intensification of those attacks just overnight, in fact. We've seen the Mykolaiv Region come under attack by the Russian Armed Forces. At least one person confirmed to have been killed by the Ukrainian authorities after the Russian armed forces launched four missiles from the Black Sea. 
 
We've heard from the Ukrainian authorities say they believe high precision weapons were used in that attack. Meaning that those civilians and civilian infrastructure were targeted deliberately as we have seen over the past few months of this grinding war. 
 
And yet, President Zelenskyy has maintained that the Ukrainian armed forces will be victorious. He spoke yesterday addressing this and this is yet another crime against humanity that they will be held accountable. But we are also seeing further attacks in the Zaporizhzhia Region. More than 80 attacks, drone attacks, missile attacks, artillery attacks according to local military official there. Killing at least two people. So, this is still ongoing and it is grinding on. 
 
We heard yesterday from a U.S. military official assessing the situation on the ground. This is the U.S. general for Europe, Christopher Cavoli, he warned that the Russian's ground forces are larger at this point now than they were at the beginning of the war. This is despite the significant losses that we know that the Russian armed forces have sustained. And he actually said the Russian armed forces still has plenty of options on the table. 
 
So, this will be a significant concern for Ukraine and of course, for NATO and Ukraine's other international allies. But that said, Christopher Cavoli also said that the Ukrainians are in a good position when it comes to that potential for a counteroffensive and that the U.S. is still keeping that support for the Ukrainian armed forces ongoing. 
 
NOBILO: And to that point, Nada, we know that Russia has made it much more difficult for people to escape conscription by digitalizing the process. So, I wonder if that is also having an impact. Thank you so much for joining us. FOSTER: There's a new point of contention in the political tensions
 
 between the U.S. and China. This time it's about this giant panda. We'll explain after the break. 
 <br>[04:40:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: Carry-on.
 
NOBILO: A giant panda is finally back home after spending two decades at a zoo in the U.S. 
 
FOSTER: Chinese state media said Ya Ya the panda landed in Shanghai just a short while ago. She was sent home to live out her golden years as the U.S. China loan agreement expired. As Selina Wang reports, Ya Ya has also become ammunition for the growing anti-U.S. sentiment in China. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
 
SELINA WANG, CNN REPORTER (voice-over): Once a symbol of Beijing's goodwill, now the center of angry debate in China. This panda in Memphis, Tennessee has become the latest victim in worsening U.S.- China tensions.
 
Ya Ya arrived in America with her playmate Le Le two decades ago, as an emblem of growing bilateral friendship. But recent videos show the once fluffy panda, now looking skinny, with scraggly fur, has sparked outrage in China. Many Chinese people and some animal advocates accusing the zoo of mistreatment. Videos on Chinese social media claim that pandas are being abused, quickly went viral against the backdrop of growing anti-American sentiment. The rumors, often fanned by state propaganda.
 
And meanwhile, Chinese social media users are praising these viral videos of this panda in Russia, Ru Yi, claiming videos of the active and playful panda prove Russia is taking excellent care of the Chinese bear. State TV saying the pandas are helping the Russia-China relationship.
 
Chinese and American scientists launched a joint investigation, concluding that Ya Ya has a genetic fur and skin condition that does not impact her quality of life, and has received excellent care. But that message is not getting through. Outside the panda exhibit at the Beijing Zoo, I asked people if they've heard of Ya Ya, the panda. This man said, yes, she is abused in America. 
 <br>[04:45:03]
 
An 11-year-old boy tells me, I heard the U.S. is treating the panda poorly. This man says, isn't Russia taking good care of pandas? Pandas are happy over there, not like in the U.S. And this man, with his granddaughter, tells me, pandas in Russia are very happy. Why? Russians and Chinese are friends. At least Russia is not sanctioning China. WANG: Ya Ya will soon settle in this Beijing Zoo. Now, China has long used its pandas as a diplomatic tool. Currently, its pandas are on loan to about 20 countries. And the United States has not received one since Ya Ya and Le Le, 20 years ago. Now, these pandas are normally loaned on these tenure leases, and they cost a million dollars annually.
 
WANG (voice-over): The Memphis Zoo had already planned to send Ya Ya and Le Le back to Beijing this spring, because their lease is expiring. But Le Le died of heart disease two months ago, at the age of 24. The average lifespan for pandas is usually under 30 years.
 
Yet, that didn't stop rampant speculation and led to an explosion of accusations about Ya Ya's treatment too. Accelerating calls to bring Ya Ya back to China. The message even featured on billboards from New York City to major cities across China.
 
In 1972, during U.S. President Richard Nixon's historic trip to China, his wife visited pandas in Beijing.
 
PAT NIXON, WIFE OF FORMER PRESIDENT RICHARD NIXON: On behalf of the people of the United States, I am pleased to be here and accept the precious gift. 
 
WANG (voice-over): Months later, China sent a pair of pandas to the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. Now decades later, this panda's return from the U.S. to China symbolic, not a growing friendship, but grow animosity between two global superpowers. 
 
Selina Wang, CNN, Beijing.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
NOBILO: Panda diplomacy is a fickle business. 
 
FOSTER: Yes, I didn't know it had blown up so much in China. 
 
NOBILO: China's Foreign Ministry cleared up some of the controversy on Wednesday, saying that Ya Ya was treated just fine. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MAO NING, SPOKESPERSON, CHINESE FOREIGN AFFAIRS MINISTRY (through translator): The Memphis Zoo has a relatively sound management system and operation procedures and Ya Ya has been under good care throughout her stay at the Memphis Zoo. She is deeply loved by the American people. The cooperative research on giant pandas has facilitated the protection of the animal. Public education and people-to-people exchanges, China is willing to continue working with other partners, the U.S. side included, to make contributions to the conservation of endangered species. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: Bianca has been using her time wisely. 
 
NOBILO: I've more panda facts. 
 
FOSTER: Yes.
 
NOBILO: But we're in a tease now. So, I think people just have to wait. 
 
FOSTER: I tell you what is happening. The deal is done. Aaron Rodgers is officially a member of the New York Jets. Coming up, what he's saying about the move to his new team. 
 <br>[04:50:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: Aaron Rodgers has officially been introduced as the New York Jets new quarterback. Speaking to the media for the first time since the trade was announced, Rodgers said he's looking forward to the challenges ahead. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
AARON RODGERS, NEW YORK JETS QUARTERBACK: Right now, I'm just going to focus on the season. And, you know, I'm excited about being here. I expect to be here for the duration of the off-season. You know, I'm excited to get to know my new teammates and the coaching staff and the organization. And obviously, I have a background with coach Hackett in an offense, but I'm excited about just diving in and being a part of this group and getting to know some of the names of my teammates. And also, I'm excited about working with all of you guys. I've heard a lot about the New York media and excited to see what that is all about.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
FOSTER: NOBILO: The full-time NFL MVP heads to New York after 18 seasons in Green Bay. The deal will involve the team's swap multiple draft picks. 
 
FOSTER: And over the in the English Premier League, it was a very good day for Manchester City. They walloped first place Arsenal with a 4-1 goal fest. 
 
NOBILO: You are an Arsenal fan, are you? 
 
FOSTER: Well, my son is. And we were listening on the radio because you couldn't get it on the TV. And they were absolutely walloped.
 
More importantly, the defending champs gained a key advantage in the title race. They are now just two points behind the gunners and have two games in hand. Arsenal has to hope that City screw up at some point before the ends of the season. 
 
FOSTER: That implies you're not an Arsenal fan. 
 
NOBILO: I mean, I'm glad that you got anything from my information. I'm not a fan of any football team. 
 
FOSTER: Man City on fire. I think that's the message. 
 
A high school senior in Louisiana has set himself up for success. Receiving a staggering amount of college acceptance letters. Dennis Maliq Barnes has been accepted into 175 colleges and universities -- would you believe. 
 
NOBILO: The 16-year-old from New Orleans has also been offered a total of more than $9 million in scholarships. That's believed to have been more than any other college-bound student in U.S. history. Barnes is quite accomplished. 
 
FOSTER: Really? 
 
NOBILO: He, I mean, shockingly, he finished high school two years early and has already been receiving college credits. He's basically got a perfect GPA and he is deciding which school to attend next week. 
 
FOSTER: What a superstar. Does that mean he applied to all of those colleges? Besides a lot of applications around his stellar schoolwork.
 
NOBILO: He sounds like an overachiever. He's more than capable of that. 
 
FOSTER: He reminds me of me. Not really. 
 
There was a royal reveal for this year's Eurovision song contest. You didn't respond at all this there. 
 
NOBILO: I did facially. You'll see it when we play it back. 
 
FOSTER: As King Charles III and Queen Camilla switched on the lights of the Liverpool arena on Wednesday, revealing this year's Eurovision stage for the first time. Bianca is very excited about this.

CROWD CHANTS: 9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1!

 <br>[04:55:00]
 
NOBILO: The U.K. has taken over hosting duties for the 67th year of Eurovision since the winners of last year's contest, Ukraine, are still fighting a brutal war with Russia. 
 
And King Charles or at least his statue will be wearing a fresh new outfit, while Queen Camilla will be shown as a brand-new wax figure at Madame Tussauds in London. 
 
FOSTER: And the display by the famous museum comes more than a week before the royal duo are crowned as the British monarchs. Or the monarch consult to technically ranked. The figure of Camilla in a dark blue gown will stand alongside that of her husband as well as the Prince and Princess of Wales, late Queen Elizabeth and her husband Philip -- but not Prince Harry. Separated even at Madame Tussauds. But it is incredible, I think, that wax works. I mean, I'll put my
 
 neck out and say it's the best one. 
 
NOBILO: I once babysit for a family that had wax works in their house that used to frighten me. It was quite eerie. 
 
FOSTER: Very procession as well as the news coming to CNN. And before we go, the White House state dinner for the visiting South Korean president was treated to unexpected entertainment on Wednesday night from President Yoon himself. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
YOON SUK YEOL, SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT: Long, long time ago, I can still remember How that music used to make me smile ...
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NOBILO: President Yoon sang "American Pie" at the dinner. 
 
FOSTER: (INAUDIBLE) you know.
 
NOBILO: Which he would because he's very strong rendition. The U.S. president goaded Mr. Yoon to sing before presenting him with a guitar signed by the artist. The South Korean president received a standing ovation for that rendition. 
 
FOSTER: Now he's got the image here at least, doesn't he? 
 
NOBILO: Absolutely, one of my favorite things in life is to watch political leaders sing and dance. Gorbachev is particularly good.
 
FOSTER: Yes, I remember that. And Yeltsin.
