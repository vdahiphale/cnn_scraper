UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is CNN Breaking News. 
 
BECKY ANDERSON, CNN ANCHOR: Well, hello, and welcome to our viewers in the U.S. and around the world. I'm Becky Anderson live from Doha in Qatar for you. 
 
A four-day truce between Israel and Hamas does appear to be taking effect with plans for the first hostages to be released by the militant group later on today. 
 
A CNN crew near the border with Gaza reports what sounded like artillery fire in the early moments of this truce, but that has since subsided. Also the IDF reports air raid sirens in southern Israel warning of potential rocket attacks, it's not clear if there were any impacts or interceptions. 
 
Well, these are live pictures for you from that border looking across the Gaza. 
 
Meanwhile, Qatar where I am, which helped broker the deal, says the first 13 hostages are expected to be released at 4:00 p.m. local time, about eight hours from now. And Israel has agreed to free 39 Palestinians held in Israeli jails today and dozens more over the next four days. 
 
Well, first aid shipments under the agreement hundreds of thousands of, sorry, let me put that (INAUDIBLE). Hundreds of trucks packed with food, fuel and medical supplies are expected to cross into Gaza today as part of this deal. 
 
It starts with CNN's Jeremy Diamond who is live this hour in Sderot in Israel. And you and I spoke at the top of the last hour the official start of this truce. And at the time, you reported hearing explosions behind you the sounds of warfare. What are you witnessing and hearing now?
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Becky, it now appears that that truce that was slated to start at 7:00 a.m. but certainly did not appears to be taking effect. We have not heard any loud booms coming from the direction of the Gaza Strip since about 7:18 a.m. local time, about 15, 20 minutes after that we did hear some small arms fire coming from inside Gaza. But we haven't heard the sounds of any heavy weaponry since about 7:18 am. 
 
Since then, it has been relatively quiet here as we are on our position overlooking the Gaza Strip. You can still see some of the smoke in the distance from some of those previous strikes that appear to have taken place. 
 
But for now, at least calm appears to have been restored. For the first time since the beginning of this conflict really, this has been, you know, 47 days of war between Israel and Hamas. And now we are seeing perhaps a new calm being installed inside of Gaza. 
 
And if it holds, Becky, that presents enormous promise, enormous opportunity for the families of those hostages, who are still being held inside of Gaza if everything goes according to plan at 4:00 pm. Today, local time, we could see some of the first Israeli hostages who have been held since the beginning of this war enter Israel. That is the hope 13 hostages could be released at around 4:00 p.m. local time. Women and children expected to be among that group. 
 
And if this continues, of course, we could see four days of releases perhaps more after that if Hamas decides to release more hostages. Israel will exchange an additional day of ceasefire for another 10 hostages as well as of course, that three to one ratio of Palestinian prisoners being released for every one Israeli hostage.
 
ANDERSON: Let's be quite clear, this was an extremely harder and pause intense and very, very difficult negotiations on the part of the mediators here in Qatar, of course Hamas and Israel have absolutely no trust in each other, nor are they indirect communication. All of this has been done through the categories supported by Egypt and the U.S. is the most significant diplomatic effort, diplomatic success, diplomatic breakthrough since this war began, this conflict began as you say 47 days ago.
 
What would breach, sorry, what would constitute Jeremy, a breach in this deal as far as hostilities are concerned?
 <br>[01:05:04]
 
Have the negotiators made that clear? Does the deal make this clear?
 
DIAMOND: It doesn't seem clear to me back exactly what would amount to a full breach of the agreement or what would cause one side or the other, to walk away effectively. I mean, again, we have heard breaches of this agreement already in its first minutes. 
 
In addition to those heavy booms that we heard inside of Gaza, around 15 minutes after the top of the last hour, we also received rocket sirens in two communities -- Israeli communities are bordering the Gaza Strip. So there have clearly been violations already of this truce. What would cause the parties to walk away isn't entirely clear to me yet.
 
ANDERSON: Jeremy is on the border. Jeremy's good to have you. Jeremy Diamond is in Sderot in Israel Thank you. 
 
Well, the United Nations anticipates that trucks carrying desperately needed humanitarian aid and that is an understatement when I say desperately needed, these trucks have to get into Gaza and they are expected to move into Gaza immediately once this truce gets underway. 
 
So, we would expect there for that an hour in we are seeing some movement dozens of trucks were lined up on the Egyptian side of the border as you can see here, at Rafah on Thursday. Ahead of that expected truce. The UN sending food, water fuel, everyday items that are needed prior to this outbreak about of the war -- about 455 trucks like these entered Gaza daily with aid supplies. 
 
Remember, many, many people in Gaza, the majority of people in Gaza need aid, use aid on a regular basis outside of a conflict. Things have got so much worse described as almost catastrophic, on the verge of catastrophe by so many agency groups. 
 
Since October the 21st, aid deliveries have averaged just 45 trucks per day, 10 percent of what is needed. Residents in Gaza say the news of a truce was a much needed relief.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): We hope for a truce. We are tired. The people of Gaza are tired. We will no longer hear the sound of aircraft and of bombardment. We will be able to sit in safety.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): A truce will be a good beginning and the fear in us will go away. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): If there is a truth we will be mentally relieved. The truth is a mental comfort.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: The physical and mental fatigue of what has been these 47 days. Live now to Ramallah in the West Bank and to Hiba Tibi. Hiba, it's good to have you. You're the Country Director for CARE in the West Bank and in Gaza. 
 
Just explain for our viewers how important what is scheduled to start today and we hope is now underway in our in this humanitarian cause, how important is it?
 
HIBA TIBI, CARE COUNTRY DIRECTOR, WEST BANK AND GAZA: Thank you. That is important. The level of importance I could not put it in a better way than what you have put it just before the (INAUDIBLE) Gaza. There is a need in a huge, huge demand and needs on this. It's all required for basic daily life for any human being. And this includes water, food, and shelter items. Because many of the people are continuously, continued getting moved from the north to the south. And they are sleeping outdoor. The winter is on -- is arrived -- has arrived in Gaza, and the access to medical supplies and medical services, all of these we look at these four very precious days as the chance to rebuild the possibilities of saving lives and more dignity, bringing more dignity to people, to kids, to children, to newborn, to woman, to elderly who were not able to access the basic, basic services over the last days. 
 
Rumors say that these are or announcements say that these are going to be 200. This is 50 percent of the daily demand before war. But at least these are bigger numbers compared to the last days. 
 <br>[01:10:00]
 
And the safe environment will allow the humanitarian actors also to pull themselves together and then to be able to distribute this humanitarian assistance in a more sustained, and more organized manner, compared to distributing it under constant bombing or airstrikes, or clashes. 
 
So this is why we look at these four days as a big opportunity and huge opportunity with big hope of at least continue, and in a more systemic and organized way to save lives of the people in the South.
 
ANDERSON: Unless you've been in a war zone, I don't think that, you know, it's possible to explain what the sense of a pause in the guns will bring to the people of Gaza. It's so many who have been forcibly displaced into the south, of course, the Israeli army remain on the ground in northern Gaza, having moved in some weeks ago, and conducting raids there. They are now, you know, they've stopped their activities, and that is part of the deal. 
 
But just for the sake of our viewers, we heard some Palestinians and some residents of Gaza talking about just how important this lull in the fighting will be. Hiba, how do you -- how would you explain the importance of this, the psychological importance, the relief that people will feel just knowing that they won't have that kind of reverberation of war around them?
 
TIBI: Again, an amazing question, Becky. I was on phone with the colleagues just before I come into this interview. Everyone was extremely devastated yesterday with that choose not going in practice or was put on hold. 
 
Today, everyone is expecting it. They have mixed feelings, lots of issues that they want to look at to at least resume their sort of normal life. Again, we even if it's for four days is very important. As you have mentioned, the striking was constant sense 47 days. It's constantly happening. They are expecting some of them, they said my colleagues, I'm giving you testimonies from my colleagues, some of them said finally, I might be able to sleep for one night in the coming four days. Some of them were very hopeful to go back to their houses, all of them, they evacuated to the south, they were hopeful to go back to the north. 
 
But of course, this is not possible. To check on their houses to check on their on to get more stuff for their -- for daily usage, people left their homes with minimal stuff with them, because they did not expect that it's going to be for that long. But of course, this is not possible. 
 
They want also to contribute to two things, first of all secured what is missing for themselves, like my colleagues, for their families. You know, it was very difficult over the last tensely, last days to get food, to get bread, to secure cooking gas. They are so hopeful that these basic requirements will be secured. This is one thing.
 
And secondly, to contribute to the distribution of aid that we are entering into Gaza or we are bringing from within Gaza. Of course for us as an organization, we don't know if our office is still existing or -- and we will not be able to check on it. It's in the north. We don't know about our warehouses if they are still existing, if -- or if they were affected. 
 
But what at least these days are looked at as a very hopeful moment for people to secure their needs to contribute to helping other for some it's very harsh moment because as you know, there are thousands of people who are missing, thousands of people who are under the rubble. They were hoping to go to the north they will not be able to do that to at least look for those who are missing. But for those who are in the south, for instance, they can go back to Khan Younis dig for the unfortunately bodies under the rubble, decently bury them, secured maybe as an access to hospital medical services, priority was given to saving lives and for the wounds. 
 
Now one of my colleagues, he was waiting for the moment where he can take his kids who has skin disease because of lack of water just to see by to get him checked by the doctors and this is how important it is for the people in Gaza.
 
ANDERSON: Hibi, you've just laid out the scope of the importance, the scope of things that need to get done that the wishes and needs of the people of Gaza.
 <br>[01:15:02]
 
And what they may be able to achieve, or certainly what they hope to achieve in this window of opportunity, as the guns fall silent in this conflict, as the hostilities are expected to be stopped on both sides, it is an obligation of both parties and they understand their obligations had been made very clear by the mediation team. They've signed up to them. The obligations are clear and in secession, the complete cessation of hostilities is one of those obligations. 
 
Hiba, thank you for joining us. Hiba Tibi, who I've spoken to numerous times over the past seven weeks of work that Hiba does is remarkable, as is the work of so many of her colleagues and friends across the world of agency relief. It's been remarkable. Thank you. 
 
Well, the Israel Defense Forces say they detained the director of the Al-Shifa Hospital in northern Gaza. The IDF says he was transferred to the Israeli security agency the Shin Bet for questioning. Israel says it has evidence that the hospital did serve as cover for a Hamas command and control center and wants to ask the director what he knew about that. 
 
Well, Israeli official say the Hamas tunnel network under the hospital use power and resources taken from the hospital says that Hamas store weapons inside and on the hospital grounds. 
 
Meantime, the Hamas controlled Health Ministry has suspended cooperation with the World Health Organization, the W.H.O., because the director was detained while traveling in a convoy coordinated by that agency. We'll take a very quick break. Back after this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[01:20:47]
 
ANDERSON: Welcome back, I'm Becky Anderson in Qatar. We are monitoring events here in the Middle East, where a four-day truce between Israel and Hamas does appear to be taking effect. May get you a look at the Israel-Gaza border right now. 
 
Our correspondent in the area reported hearing what sounded like Israeli artillery fire continuing after the truce was due to begin, that was about an hour and 20 minutes ago, although that does now appear to be winding down. 
 
According to Qatar, which, of course, was a key broke up in this deal. Hostages held by Hamas will be released to the Red Cross in the coming hours, and Israel will free Palestinian prisoners to the West Bank. 
 
Once this truce is over, and it's four days plus the possibility of an extension for a number of days. Israel's defense minister has said that the military campaign against Hamas could continue and I quote him, forcefully for at least two more months. 
 
But for now, the question is whether this pause in hostilities can last for four days. I asked Qatar's foreign ministry spokesman about that on Thursday, have a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: What would constitute a break in this truce a breaking of this truce? We're talking about a truce on the ground? And as I understand it, in the air, so can you just describe what will be seen as a breakdown in that?
 
MAJED AL-ANSARI, QATARI FOREIGN AFFFAIRS MINISTERY SPOKESPERSON: So I don't think I can get into the technicalities, you know, technically on the ground. Of course, this has to be handled by the people who are there on the ground. But what I can tell you is that the agreement is about full secession of hostilities within the fourth day. So obviously, any resumption of hostilities of any kind would be a breach. 
 
And I think it's very important that lines of communication remain open. So that any possible breach, however it is defined, is communicated immediately to both sides and there is a way to walk back from it and make sure that we continue with you. (END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: With only a fraction of the hostages held by Hamas all set for release on day one, of course leaving many families in anguish. In fact, you know, at this stage, the plan is 50 hostages over this four- day period, which is only 20 percent of those who we know are being held in Gaza. 
 
Well, earlier CNN's Kaitlan Collins spokes with Ahal Besorai, his teenage niece and nephew were kidnapped by a mass from Kibbutz Be'eri on October the seventh along with their father. And they are not -- they are not amongst those who are set for release. Here is part of that conversation.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
AHAL BESORAI, NIECE AND NEPHEW KIDNAPPED BY HAMAS: So we learned that they are not in the group, you know, we got a phone call from the IDF to inform us that they won't be in this group. And that the situation, you know, it's very difficult. 
 
And you know, and even if they are released, the dead will be stayed behind. The mom, my sister was murdered by Hamas terrorists on October 7. So, even when they are released and hopefully they will be released as part of this 50 hostages mothers and children that are going to be released, but obviously they will be coming back, you know, without the dad and the mom has been was murdered. You know, so very difficult.
 
KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN ANCHOR: Yes, so even if they are released, it's still something, I mean, there's still so much trauma there. What's your concern about whether or not that they could be split up if some of them are released, but maybe not with your brother in law?
 <br>[01:25:00]
 
BESORAI: You know, it's a very difficult situation. I know that will be split, you know, because they announced that it's only children and mothers. So obviously my brother in law is just, you know, 50-year-old Israeli citizen. And obviously, because he's a male, and because he's Israeli will not be released. So it's very, very sad state of affairs, you know. 
 
But, you know, I'm not surprised, to be honest, you know, because we deal with such a sadistic and evil, a terrorist organization on the other hand, Hamas, you know, that killed and murdered my sister. So you don't -- you're not surprised that this is the way this ended, you know, they just manipulate and try to play with us Israelis and parents of the hospitals in this sort of way. 
 
This is something that we have to take and hopefully, you know, that they will all released and Hamas keeps to its agreement, you know, with Qatar, with Egypt, you know, overseen by the U.S., you know, that they will proceed with this sort of agreement and release them all.
 
At the end of the day, maybe even 20 more because, you know, they will want to extend this ceasefire over and above this for days. And this is why I'm sure they keep like few other hostages. They will then release later in return for maybe one or two more days of ceasefire.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSONI: That was seen as Kaitlan Collins speaking with Ahal Besorai, whose niece, nephew and brother in law were kidnapped by Hamas on October the 7th.
 
With short break right now, before we go to that, let me just update you there is 130,000 liters of fuel sitting on the Egypt side of the Rafah border, diesel massively important that that gets into Gaza. And that is the idea through this humanitarian truce which started just shy of an hour and a half ago.
 
When we come back, we'll take you live to southern Israel, just across the border from Gaza to see how this pause is holding.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[01:30:40] 
 
BECKY ANDERSON, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome back. I'm Becky Anderson live from Doha in Qatar. 
 
It does appear that the four-day truce between Israel and Hamas which started an hour and a half ago is taking hold. Reports of artillery and rockets have subsided over the past hour or so. If the truce holds, we are expecting the first group of hostages from Israel being held by Hamas to be released later today, followed by Israel releasing a group of Palestinian prisoners. 
 
A spokesman for the Israeli military said troops will remain on the move during the pause, but won't initiate combat. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LT. CO. JONATHAN CONRICUS, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES SPOKESPERSON: What we are going to do is remain in our positions, our estimated positions as we are now. But of course, we will not be static. So you won't see any significant maneuvers by the IDF but you would also and it may be reported that there will be troop movement because to be static on the battlefield is a very bad thing to do, unwise. And therefore we are not going to be static.
 
We will be moving but you will not see any significant combat activity, not on our behalf, unless we are attacked, of course. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Some detail for you there.
 
Well, meanwhile we are expecting to see a convoy of aid trucks begin making their way into Gaza from Egypt sometime today as part of the truce agreement. And important there is 130,000 liters of diesel fuel on the Egypt side
 
 of the border, queueing as part of that humanitarian convoy to get in. And that is absolutely crucial for the humanitarian infrastructure that supports hundreds of thousands, millions really, nigh on 2 million people in the Gaza Strip. 
 
Let's get you to CNN's Jeremy Diamond. He's on the Israel side of the border at this hour. 
 
And let's start with what you're seeing, hearing. Is this to your eyes at least, from your vantage point a truce that is holding at this point? 
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well Becky, certainly in the first 15 minutes of this truce, it was not holding. We were hearing the sounds of war. We were hearing explosions coming from inside the Gaza strip a lot of small arms fire as well.
 
But now for over an hour it has been relatively quiet. We have heard some sporadic small arms fire but really not much. And certainly no heavy weaponry being fired in over an hour -- about an hour and 15 minutes now. 
 
And so it appears that this truce between Israel Hamas that was scheduled to start at 7:00 a.m. local time appears to now be taking hold. And that is obviously a welcome sign for the families of the hostages who are depending on that truce holding in order to finally see their loved ones. 
 
At 4:00 p.m. today is when we are expecting that initial release of hostages to begin, around 4:00 p.m. local time. 13 hostages, women and children, expected to be part of that first batch of hostages who will finally be able to return and see their loved ones later today. 
 
We don't know in what condition they will be in. The Israeli military and Israeli officials are currently prepared for a wide range of scenarios. They're prepared to take people directly to a nearby hospital. They are prepared to have them meet their family members depending on the condition in which they come out in. 
 
We also know of course, that the families of those 13 hostages were notified last night that their loved ones were expected to come out today. The families of the other nearly 240 hostages were also notified that their family members were not among this initial list. 
 
So we will see if this tentative truce between Israel and Hamas holds and whether or not at 4:00 p.m. today, we see some of those Israeli hostages emerge from Gaza for the first time. 
 <br>[01:34:44]
 
ANDERSON: Yes. The Qatar mediation team and the spokesman for the ministry of foreign affairs warning that although that is a scheduled time for the release of hostages, 4:00 p.m. local time, of course, he said, you know, this is a war zone and this has been a really hard- earned deal. And time can slip, of course, with Jeremy pointing out that is the idea, the schedule at this point. 
 
Jeremy Diamond is in Sderot in Israel, thank you. 
 
Well, I will be back later in the hour. But after this short break my colleague Paula has today's other news the very latest on clashes between police and protesters in Ireland, sparked by the stabbing of five people including three children. 
 
Back after this. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
PAULA NEWTON, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome back. I'm Paula Newton in New York. 
 
We will return to the truce now underway in the Middle East. We'll return to that in a few minutes but first a look at some of the other stories we are following. 
 
In Ireland, police say the streets of Dublin are mainly calm after violent clashes broke out between police and protesters. It happened after five people including three children were stabbed in the central part of the city. Video from Reuters shows a bus on fire and other videos posted on social media that show a group of men clashing with officers and setting a police car on fire. 
 
Some protestors were heard chanting anti-immigrant slogans. The police commissioner had strong words for those taking part in the clashes. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DREW HARRIS, NATIONAL POLICE COMMISSIONER: Well, I think it's disgraceful in terms of a major investigation, the maintenance of the scene, the gathering of evidence and we have a complete lunatic hooligan faction, driven by far-right ideology and also this disruptive tendency here engaged in and serious violence. 
 
We are drafting in resources to deal with that and that will be dealt with properly. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[01:39:57]
 
NEWTON: Police say a man in his 50s has now been detained as a suspect in the knife attack. And a reminder, as we are saying, three children and two adults were injured. 
 
Ukraine says one person was killed and another wounded in a barrage of Russian strikes on the Kherson Region. Ukrainian officials say Russian forces launched 65 attacks on Thursday using mortars, artillery, rockets and drones, among other weapons. Attacks reportedly hit residential areas as well as businesses and a medical facility. 
 
Ukraine plans to build what it calls an army of drones to help fight Russia's aggression but many of those drones are not coming off large assembly lines instead they're actually made by civilians volunteers who adopted a do-it-yourself, DIY approach to drone making. 
 
Anna Coren has our story. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANNA COREN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: On the outskirts of Kyiv, a soldier puts on a pair of goggles. She is part of the unit testing the latest batch of drones that have just arrived. 
 
Some work. 
 
Some don't. 
 
But this is the place to find out before they're deliver to Ukrainian troops on the eastern and southern fronts. 
 
Some of these drones are from civilians. Produced in homes on kitchen tables, they can be used for reconnaissance or assault missions. 
 
Drones have become a critical component of this war, and absolutely essential to every single Ukrainian unit on the front line. And while civilians are working with private companies and the military to produce as many drones as possible, these soldiers say they are not nearly enough. 
 
As Russia's full-scale invasion approaches a second year, there is now a critical shortage of drones. China's decision to shut down exports of parts citing national security concerns is part of the problem. 
 
However, the biggest issue is Russian electronic warfare. A Ukrainian official tells CNN the military uses roughly 30,000 to 40,000 drones per month. They are cheap and expendable, but soldiers on the ground say they need at least ten times more. 
 
A grassroots army of civilians are heeding the call including Vera (ph) and Oleksandr (ph) encouraging others to do the same. Their operation has taken over their one-bedroom apartment. He makes drone parts with his 3D printer, while she creates camouflage dressings for soldiers' helmets. 
 
Their work acknowledged by grateful troops in Bakhmut, who sent them Ukraine's coat of arms made of bullets. 
 
OLEKSANDR SIERKOV, CIVILIAN DRONE MAKER: Instead of getting married and having a wedding, we spent that money to start making drones. Now we are happy without gold rings, but with the drones. 
 
COREN: Companies like Victory Drones are training up civilians online to help build these little birds to then distribute to the military. 
 
HENNADIY, VOLUNTEER, VICTORY DRONES: If you attach the payload to the bottom, if you attach the battery on top, you have a perfect shell, which is a guided missile. 
 
COREN: Volunteer and soldier Hennadiy, says to compete with Russia's industrial output, Ukraine must innovate or there will be no future. 
 
He's already lost his best friend, seen here in this video, singing lullabies to their children. He knows too well the painful price of this war. 
 
HENNADIY: You know, when I am seeing a way to die, I see the eyes of people from my unit I lost already. And obviously, we have to win this war, because otherwise, the sacrifice was fruitless. 
 
COREN: Even the next generation is getting involved. The military has begun training school kids, some as young as first graders. 
 
SOPHIA: My name is Sophia. I'm six years old. I like flying drones, and protecting the country. 
 
COREN: And there are even plans to make this part of the nation's education system. 
 
Anna Coren, CNN -- Kyiv.

NEWTON: The rapper Sean "Diddy" Combs has been served with a second lawsuit after an earlier suit was settled. A different woman is now accusing Combs of intentionally drugging and sexually assaulting her. She also says he filmed the act and showed it to others. 
 
The alleged incident happened back in 1991. The woman was a college student at the time who had appeared in music videos with the rapper. 
 
A spokesperson for Combs says the latest allegations are quote "made up and not credible, and purely a money grab". 
 <br>[01:44:57]
 
NEWTON: Actor Jamie Foxx is responding to accusations of sexual assault and battery filed against him in New York Monday. In the lawsuit a woman identified as Jane Doe claims Foxx intentionally touched her without her consent in a restaurant in 2015 while he seemed to be intoxicated. 
 
A spokesperson for Foxx says the alleged incident never happened, and claims the same person filed a nearly identical lawsuit in Brooklyn in 2020 and that case was dismissed. 
 
Ok. We will get back to Becky Anderson in Qatar for. That will be just ahead. And we'll take a look back at the terrifying first days of the Israel-Hamas conflict and the unimaginable destruction we have seen over the past six weeks. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: Welcome back.
 
Our top story this hour a four-day truce between Israel and Hamas does appear to have gone into effect in the last hour. [01:49:46]
 
ANDERSON: Here is a live look at the Israel-Gaza border, as we speak. Our correspondent in the area reported hearing what sounded like Israeli artillery fire continuing for a few minutes after the truce was due to begin. Now that does appear to have stopped now. 
 
In the coming hours 13 Israeli hostages held by Hamas should be released to the Red Cross, according to the terms of the deal. And Israel has agreed to free 39 Palestinians held in Israeli jails today and dozens more over the coming days if Hamas keeps freeing these hostages that it holds. 
 
CNN's Nic Robertson has witnessed the Israel Hamas war since it began. Now six weeks later, he describes the destruction in Gaza as apocalyptic and in southern Israel he says the horrors of October 7th still hang in the air, where so many innocent people died. 
 
And a word of caution, some images in Nic's report are graphic. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Minutes after leaving the plane in Tel Aviv.
 
The sirens have gone off. People are taking cover. We got off the bus. People are taking cover. And you can hear the intercept missiles banging in the air. 
 
It's October 7th, 14 hours since Hamas' attack began. No one knew what to expect.
 
A few hours later, three and a half miles from Gaza -- 
 
There's the Iron Dome being fired up all around us right now. It's illuminating the sky here. The bangs of the Iron Dome intercepting the rockets that are being fired from Gaza just a couple of miles away.
 
The coming days reveal Hamas' horrors, more than 1,200 dead.
 
Look at all these shell casings that are scattered around on the ground here. This gives you an indication of the intensity of the firefight.
 
More than 300 at the Nova Music Festival, a rocket shelter there, where some were mercilessly killed in cold blood, had the biggest impact.
 
Six weeks later, we happened to be passing, as Israel's recovery specialists clean it out.
 
This is bringing back a lot of painful and difficult memories. The last time I was here, six weeks ago, it was still full of human flesh and remains. 
 
And I'm looking inside, and it seems, I don't know, worse. The grenade splatter, the gunshots that are in the wall here, they're bigger, they're worse. I'm just looking at it. 
 
That night I was really emotionally beaten by what I saw here.
 
I don't know. It's clean but I don't think I'll ever forget it and that feeling.
 
Equally unforgettable, the scale of suffering and death inside Gaza, an average of 2,000 people a week killed, two-thirds of them women, children and the elderly. The worst I have ever witnessed while covering a war.
 
My only access to Gaza with the IDF revealing an apocalyptic landscape, where every building appears crushed, collapsed, shot up, burnt or blown apart, nothing untouched by the war. Destruction on a scale I've never encountered before.
 
More rockets coming out, more rockets coming out. Guys, more rockets coming out.
 
For weeks from a balcony a mile from Gaza, witnessing the destruction, explosion by explosion, day after day as the IDF followed political orders to destroy Hamas.
 
And Hamas emerging to fire rockets back.
 
Through these long weeks, talking too with families of hostages, hearing their pain.
 
JONATHAN DEKEL-CHAN, FATHER OF HOSTAGE: It's excruciating. We don't know if he's healthy or wounded. We know nothing.
 
ROBERTSON: And sharing difficult moments -- 
 
Guys, siren.
 
With victims returning to where Hamas attacked them.
 
ALIZA SAMUEL, OCTOBER 7TH SURVIVOR: They were lined up and they were -- I saw one of my friends, she was begging for her life.
 
ROBERTSON: So, what next? Ceasefire, hostage release -- maybe. But it won't be all hostages and the hold in fighting is unlikely to last.
 <br>[01:54:50]
 
ROBERTSON: Israel fears Hamas will exploit the pause to regroup. Hamas will do whatever it takes to survive, including not handing over all the hostages.
 
Israel vows to completely destroy Hamas and release the hostages, tactics show fighting Hamas is a priority and is far from finished.
 
The implication judged watching the past six weeks. For some hostage families, more days and more weeks of agonizing wait for Gaza's besieged civilians continuing misery. Gaza is still cut off from the world. The vast majority of its 2.2 million citizens displaced, crowded in the southern end of the enclave. Humanitarian access, on a scale to match the scope of their need, is absent.
 
Israel vows to rout Hamas there, too. Most of Gaza's hospitals are out of action. International pressure on Israel is mounting.
 
ANTONIO GUTERRES, UNITED NATIONS SECRETARY-GENERAL: We are witnessing a killing of civilians that is unparalleled and unprecedented in any conflict since I am secretary-general.
 
ROBERTSON: The only concrete certainties today, in Gaza rebuilding what is destroyed will take years. And in Israel, that no one will feel safe until Hamas is gone.
 
Nic Robertson, CNN -- Sderot, Israel.
