COOPER: Yes.
 
BLACK: Look how their eyes lit out.
 
COHEN: Yes.
 
COOPER: Yes.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
COHEN: I love her. I love her.

COHEN: Amber, who is yours?
 
RUFFIN: Mine is Kendrick Lamar.
 
COHEN: Oh. Wow. 
 
RUFFIN: Because I love to hold a grudge, baby.
 
COHEN: Yes. What weird news story were y'all completely obsessed with this year?
 
WOOD JR.: Oh, for me, this one was very obscure, but Edward Dwight. Edward Dwight was the first black man cleared by NASA to be an astronaut. He was passed over in the 60s because it was black in the 60s, and he finally went to space this year courtesy of a private company. It was a 9 minute flight. I'm completely happy. 
 
They held him down so long that the space shuttle came and gone, and he still hadn't gone to space. So I'm happy for that brother Edward Dwight.
 
RUFFIN: That's nice. I feel like mine is a news story I don't have the details of, but it was that one zoo -- we talked about on the show that was painting dogs.
 <br>[21:05:00]
 
BLACK: They looked like pandas.
 
RUFFIN: It has the animals -- 
 
WOOD JR.: They had panda dogs.
 
RUFFIN: Yeah. That's awesome. 
 
COHEN: Nice.
 
RUFFIN: That's awesome.
 
COOPER: I like the place where the zookeepers dressed like pandas for the pandas. I think it's China. That's an --
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
COHEN: What could go wrong?
 
COOPER: Yes.
 
BLACK: Mine was also animal related. They're eating the dogs. They're eating the cats. 
 
COHEN: Yes.
 
BLACK: That is my favorite weird new story of the year.
 
WOOD JR.: That was like two years ago.
 
COHEN: It really does. It really does.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
COOPER: Is there a newsmaker from 2024 you want to interview on the show?
 
WOOD JR.: Oh, we talked about this. Who do we want on the show? We said Ted Cruz.
 
BLACK: Ted Cruz would be great. I'd love to have George Santos on.
 
WOOD JR.: Oh.
 
COHEN: I mean always a good interview.
 
BLACK: Yeah.
 
RUFFIN: I'm sorry. I agree. I agree.

COHEN: Nice.
 
WOOD JR.: With "Have I Got News For You."

WOOD JR.: I'm doing a stand up.
 
COHEN: OK. NYC, you can see them tonight.
 
BLACK: What are you doing?
 
RUFFIN: My 2 little nieces are in town. Oh. And I asked them, do they want to stay and watch the ball drop? And they say yes until it started to rain. So we are heading home.
 
COHEN: Yes.
 
BLACK: I think I'm going to go back to my hotel and rub one out (ph).
 
COHEN: Nice.

COHEN: That is the -- you know what? That's great. Last orgasm of 2024.

COHEN: I know. You don't come to our production meetings. This is what I hatched up. Anymore, Mr. Quest?
 
QUEST: Oh, yes. And you, Mr. Cohen, have much to answer for with this one. Because when the question is asked, who chose the representatives of each of you? I think we all know who the guilty party is.

COOPER: I wish you could say because at the stroke of midnight, it's incredible. There's people at the confetti. It is remarkable. FIENNES: I can imagine. Yeah. I can imagine.
 
COHEN: Ralph, there's been so much Oscar buzz for Conclave and you specifically, what's been your reaction to all the attention that the movie has gotten?
 
FIENNES: You know, movies are so hard to make, and so you're just thrilled that it's getting -- it's got the response it's got. And they stayed in the cinemas for more longer than anyone expected.
 
COHEN: Yes.
 
FIENNES: That's great. Just keeping the cinema audience coming, getting out -- getting out of their homes, going -- buying a ticket to see a movie.
 
COOPER: Yeah.
 
FIENNES: I've seen 2 films since I got here.
 <br>[21:30:00]
 
COHEN: Yeah.
 
FIENNES: And I -- as being in a cinema was so. The fact that Conclave played so long in cinemas was great.
 
COOPER: Do you know when you're making a film, like, day to day, do you feel like, this is really good?
 
FIENNES: You have no idea.
 
COOPER: Really?
 
COHEN: No idea.
 
FIENNES: You have no idea. I mean, you have a -- no, you have a feeling that it's good. But you know experience teaches you. You just don't know how it's going to turn out.
 
COHEN: Where did you -- I mean, it looked like you were in the Vatican.
 
COOPER: Yeah.
 
FIENNES: It was create -- we couldn't shoot in the Vatican.
 
COOPER: Yeah, of course.
 
FIENNES: We shot the Sistine Chapel in Cinecitta, which is the big famous Italian film studios outside Rome. Fellini shot there.
 
COOPER: Right.
 
FIENNES: All the great history of Italian cinemas --
 
COOPER: Yeah. It's a legendary film set.
 
FIENNES: -- is in the bones of Cinecitta.
 
COOPER: That's cool.
 
FIENNES: And they have a Sistine Chapel. All right. There isn't --
 
COOPER: No. Really?
 
FIENNES: But we had a great, production designer who created all our -- Susie Davis, all our locations from composites of places.
 
COOPER: Oh, wow.
 
FIENNES: To give an impression of the Vatican.
 
COOPER: It was incredible.
 
COHEN: You know, it's so funny. I described the film as a thriller. And when you hear it having not seen the movie, it's -- you almost can't imagine that a movie about the selection of a pope is a thriller.
 
COOPER: Yeah.
 
COHEN: Talk to me about why you think that resonates as a thriller?
 
FIENNES: Well, it's who's going to get the gig and who's going to win.
 
COHEN: Yeah. Yes.
 
FIENNES: I mean, it can apply to any setup, I think.
 
COHEN: Yeah.
 
FIENNES: I think people are kind of curious because it's cardinals.
 
COHEN: Yes.
 
FIENNES: It's men of God.
 
COHEN: Yes.
 
FIENNES: Who are competing for the top job.
 
COHEN: Yeah.
 
FIENNES: And, of course, they all are meant to be humble men of the cloth. But it's a political situation.
 
COOPER: And it's also people locked in a room, essentially. I mean, it's people -- they're not allowed access to the outside world.
 
FIENNES: No. They're sequestered. They have no contact with the outside world. And -- but it is real. I mean, there will be, I'm sure, in our lifetimes, another conclave. COOPER: Yeah. Yeah.
 
COHEN: It's much like our costume --
 
COOPER: But it's also -- I've covered several of them. And from the outside and so to see an inside like this was it was just great.
 
COHEN: By the way, you know, you are such a lothario on screen. Do you have a favorite love scene in your entire oeuvre that has been -- that you think resonates the best or that was the most fun to shoot?
 
FIENNES: There was a love scene in The English Patient --
 
COHEN: Yeah.
 
FIENNES: -- with Kristen. But it wasn't -- it wasn't about -- it was -- it wasn't about sex. It was about the intimacy of 2 people. And I don't know the atmosphere that I remember with being created in that felt. It felt very genuine.
 
COOPER: Such a good man.
 
COHEN: By the way, you are playing, Odysseus in "The Return" right now.
 
FIENNES: Yeah.
 
COHEN: And, you are naked as a Jaybird (ph).
 
FIENNES: Very briefly.
 
COHEN: Very briefly.
 
FIENNES: Blink and you miss it.
 
COHEN: Well, I paused. You look damn good, dude. 
 
FIENNES: OK.
 
COHEN: You look really good. Anyway, just shout out to that. Shout out to that. That was a big reunion for you.
 
FIENNES: It was a Juliette Binoche. Yeah. Yeah. Who's one of my -- she's a great friend. She's a extraordinary artist and a great woman. And, it was -- it just -- it we -- our connection after so many years playing Odysseus, Penelope felt extraordinary. I think she's just a genius actor.
 
COOPER: How do you prepare for something like playing Odysseus?
 
FIENNES: Well, it's scary because there's all this baggage.
 
COOPER: Yes.
 
FIENNES: It's like playing well it's -- I can say it's like playing Hamlet. But it's bigger than that even. It's mythic. COOPER: Yeah. Of course.
 
FIENNES: And it's impossible. But I think our director, Alberti Pasolini, had this very strong reduced, quite stark approach. No guards, no special effects, very, very minimal.
 
COOPER: Interesting.
 
FIENNES: And there was the minimalism of this approach that I really liked.
 
COHEN: You are famous -- you're such a great orator. You're such a great actor on watch "What Happens Live" earlier this year. I convinced you to perform a monologue from your --
 
FIENNES: You're always convincing me to do --
 
COHEN: Yes. I am.
 
FIENNES: -- monologues.
 
COHEN: You did a monologue from the "Housewives of Salt Lake City." It was so brilliant. I'm wondering if you could perform for us one of the biggest, I think, Internet moments from this year. And it's the very demure, very mindful, Jools Lebron, moment. And I showed you the video yesterday.
 
FIENNES: Yeah.
 
COHEN: Can you perform this for us, Ralph?
 
FIENNES: I can try giving my version of it.
 
COHEN: That would be wonderful.
 
COOPER: You'd never seen it before until yesterday.
 
FIENNES: No, I didn't see it.
 
COOPER: OK.
 
COHEN: Even Anderson had seen it.
 
COOPER: I had seen it. 
 
COHEN: Amazing.
 
FIENNES: Well, look. This is how I do my makeup for work. Very demure. Very mindful. I don't come to work with a green cut crease. I don't look like a clown when I go to work. I don't do too much. I'm mindful at work. See how I look? Very presentable. The way I came to the interview is the way I go to the job.
 <br>[21:35:00]
 
A lot of you girls go to the interview looking like Marge Simpson, looking like you're going to look like Patty and Selma, not demure. Not demure. But I am very modest. See my shirt. Only a little cheat here. Not my cho cho. Be mindful of why they hired you. Here's a reality check, Diva. What's the name you want me to make it out to?
 
COHEN: Ladies and gentlemen, Ralph Fiennes multiple Oscar nominees, up for a Golden Globe for Conclave. Did you like that, Anderson?
 
COOPER: I liked that very much.
 
COHEN: Thank you for performing that for us. That was one of kind of the biggest monologues --
 
FIENNES: I didn't know.
 
COHEN: I know.
 
COOPER: I promise that was amazing.
 
COHEN: You're incredible. Everyone go see Conclave. Do yourself a favor.
 
FIENNES: Thank you.
 
COHEN: Ralph, congratulations on the Golden Globe. Congratulations on everything. 
 
FIENNES: Thanks, man.
 
COHEN: Come by for a spot of tea tomorrow.
 
FIENNES: Happy New Year. 
 
COHEN: All right? Happy New Year. We love you.
 
COOPER: Yeah, great. That was incredible. Thank you so much.
 
COHEN: We're going to be back in a moment with the incredible Sasheer Zamata up first.
 
FIENNES: And don't show any cho cho.
 
COOPER: No. cho cho.
 
COHEN: No. choc cho. We're not patting ourselves.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[21:40:00]
 
COOPER: And welcome back New York Times Square. Joining us now, the incredibly talented Sasheer Zamata -- excuse me -- 
 
SASHEER ZAMATA, AMERICAN ACTRESS: I can tell you you're already drunk. 
 
COHEN: You're drunk. You're drunk.
 
ZAMATA: Yeah.
 
COOPER: I'm not. I'm not.
 
COHEN: Well, let's see if you can protect me with the umbrella.
 
COOPER: Oh, sweetie. Yes.
 
COHEN: Yes.
 
COOPER: OK.
 
COHEN: How are you?
 
ZAMATA: I'm so good. How are you?
 
COHEN: I'm great. We were just talking during the break. What's your reaction to all of this? 
 
COOPER: You've never you've never been in Times Square on new year's eve.
 
ZAMATA: No. I lived New York, and I usually avoid Times Square as much as I can because it's too much. So I definitely haven't been here for New Year's, but it's really exciting.
 
COHEN: It's wild.
 
ZAMATA: It's wild.
 
COHEN: Congratulations, "Agatha All Along" --
 
ZAMATA: Yeah.
 
COHEN: -- was a massive hit this year. What's your reaction to the response?
 
ZAMATA: I mean, it was truly a dream come true to be a part of the Marvel Universe and to be a witch and to do all the things that I've always wanted to do. And, yeah, I'm just so glad that the fans like it and hope that they want to see more.
 
COHEN: What's the best perk of being a part of the Marvel Universe? 
 
ZAMATA: Oh, I would say the fandom, definitely. Being able to fly sometimes and, like, be a little magic y and witchy. Yeah. I just like being able to live out your superhero dreams. It's the best.
 
COHEN: Do we know what's in store for Jennifer?
 
ZAMATA: I really don't. I wish I -- I wish I did.
 
COHEN: Yes. Yes.
 
ZAMATA: I love playing Jen so much. I'm still wearing Jennifer Kale pink. I can't get out of it.
 
COHEN: As you should.
 
ZAMATA: As I should.
 
COHEN: It suits you.
 
ZAMATA: Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
 
COHEN: 2025, one of the big events coming up in 2025 is the 50th anniversary of SNL. You spent time on SNL. Do you have a favorite sketch or character that you were a part of on the show?
 
ZAMATA: Yeah. I had a character where I was, like, a teen girl who was doing these YouTube dances, and we did it a couple times. And Taraji P. Henson was my mom, and Chris Rock was my dad. It was just, like, such a dream come true to be able to play a character like that.
 
COOPER: Yeah. I mean, that must have been, like, a pinch me moment too. Right? ZAMATA: Yes. There are so many pinch me moments at that show. I mean, like, the any kind of anniversary, I was actually on the show during the 40th anniversary, and being in that room during that party is, like, so crazy because you're watching, like, Miley Cyrus talk to Wayne Gretzky. Oh my goodness. So exciting.
 
COHEN: Yeah. That? That was thunder.
 
COOPER: Is that an actual thunder clap?
 
COHEN: That was thunder.
 
COOPER: That was actual thunder.
 
COHEN: That was very exciting and crowd cheering. Good. It woke this freaking crowd up.
 
COOPER: I mean, your first comedy special --
 
ZAMATA: Yes.
 
COOPER: -- is on right now on Hulu.
 
ZAMATA: On Hulu. It's called "The First Woman," and it's also pretty witchy and magicy. And I love being able to do stand up and have people enjoy it and, yeah, watch it on Hulu.
 
COOPER: Do you -- like, how long you've been doing stand up for?
 
ZAMATA: Oh, gosh. I started in 2009.
 
COOPER: Wow.
 
ZAMATA: And I'm bad at math. So whatever that --
 
COOPER: And do you have to constantly keep doing it to, like, keep the --
 
ZAMATA: Yeah, it's like a muscle. You have to keep working. And I love doing improv and, like, playing with the crowd and getting their feedback on it. And it's just very fun, and I want to do more of it.
 
COHEN: What's the best thing about being a woman right now?
 
ZAMATA: Being a woman?
 
COHEN: Yeah.
 
ZAMATA: Interesting. The best thing about being a woman --
 
COOPER: That's a very Larry King question. I feel like.
 
COHEN: I much respect her. 
 
COOPER: I do too. ZAMATA: I would say our resiliency, and I believe that no matter what comes at us, we're able to, like, fight through it and rise above. So I'm looking forward to many women rising above all the things that are coming our way.
 
COOPER: You know, it's interesting having kids because I have 2 boys. And see -- and, like, we have a lot of play dates in my house with all the kids and their friends. Girls are so much smarter than little boys.
 
COHEN: Yes. 
 
COOPER: I mean, it's just -- I mean, I love -- my boys are smart. I love the everything. 
 
ZAMATA: Pretty smart. Yeah.
 
COOPER: But they're -- yeah. It's so clear early on.
 
ZAMATA: Yeah. 
 
COHEN: Did you just figured that out?
 
COOPER: No. But, I mean, I hadn't had a lot of experience with little children, and it's just so obvious from, like, the get go.
 
ZAMATA: Yeah. Yeah.
 
COOPER: Sweetie, what is going on with you?
 
COHEN: Just can I -- 
 
COOPER: What is going on? You take the umbrella.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
ZAMATA: Come over here. Do you want to share mine?
 
COHEN: Yeah. I'm just going to share her. It's a control thing.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
COOPER: It's just control thing.
 
COHEN: Oh, OK. Take control. In honor of your role in "Agatha All Along," I want to play a game called have they seen a ghost? OK.
 
ZAMATA: I love this game. Y'all are going to guess whether celebrities have reported seeing ghosts. OK? Has Ariana Grande ever seen a ghost?
 
COOPER: I would say yes.
 
ZAMATA: I'm going to say no. I feel like she's, like, in her zone and probably doesn't have time for ghosts.
 
COHEN: She -- yes, she did. ZAMATA: Oh.
 
COHEN: She took a picture and stole cemetery.
 
ZAMATA: Oh my 1 of the 7 gates to hell on earth and saw 3 distinct faces in the photo.
 <br>[21:45:00]
 
COHEN: Oh, wow. Has Sabrina Carpenter seen a ghost?
 
ZAMATA: Yes.
 
COHEN: No.
 
ZAMATA: No? She's been ghosted but hasn't seen a ghost.
 
COHEN: Yes. What about Jenna Bush Hager? Has she seen a ghost?
 
COOPER: I don't think so.
 
ZAMATA: I'm a say yes.
 
COHEN: She said she heard ghost singing opera in the White House out of a fireplace.
 
ZAMATA: Wow.
 
COOPER: We should have asked Hoda when we were playing with her.
 
COHEN: Yes. What about Katy Perry?
 
ZAMATA: I feel like Katy Perry probably has seen a ghost. She's seen a lot of wild stuff.
 
COHEN: She saw a mustache man staring back at her in the mirror once.
 
ZAMATA: Terrifying.
 
COHEN: What about Angelina Jolie?
 
ZAMATA: I feel like Angelina probably conjured a ghost.
 
COHEN: You would think so, but it's not been reported. What about Blake Lively? Has she seen a ghost?
 
ZAMATA: I would say no.
 
COHEN: Anderson? 
 
COOPER: I don't know.
 
COHEN: No.
 
ZAMATA: No.
 
COHEN: What about Kesha?
 
COOPER: I'm annoyed about the umbrella.
 
ZAMATA: Kesha has probably seen a ghost.
 
COHEN: Yeah. She's seen so many ghosts. I don't have time. Mick Jagger --
 
COOPER: Andrew Lloyd Webber?
 
COHEN: Mick Jagger, has he seen a ghost?
 
ZAMATA: No.
 
COOPER: Yes.
 
COHEN: No.
 
ZAMATA: No.
 
COHEN: What about Andrew Lloyd Webber?
 
COOPER: Yes.
 
ZAMATA: Yes. Definitely. The theater?
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
COOPER: -- opera. Of course.
 
COHEN: He had a priest do an exorcism in one of his homes for a pesky poltergeist. What about former Beverly Hills housewife, Lisa Rinna? Did she see a ghost?
 
ZAMATA: Yes.
 
COHEN: She saw a ghost watching over her daughter's crib once.
 
COOPER: Oh my god. Yes.
 
COHEN: Yes. True.
 
COOPER: That's just disturbing.
 
COHEN: Wow. You know what else is disturbing? It is raining.
 
ZAMATA: It is raining.
 
COHEN: So hard.
 
ZAMATA: Really.
 
COHEN: I have to tell you something. Your beat is so good.
 
COOPER: I know.
 
COHEN: And you look so fresh.
 
COOPER: Yes.
 
ZAMATA: Thank you.
 
COHEN: I want -- you look --
 
ZAMATA: I would be very happy.
 
COHEN: -- pristine. Yes.
 
COOPER: Yes. And I know I just feel, like, wet and ugly look like, standing next to you. You're like, you're so beautiful.

COHEN: Screw it.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
MICKEY GUYTON, AMERICAN MUSICAL ARTIST: -- to be had.

COHEN: You had a new album this year.
 
GUYTON: Yes.
 
COHEN: You're going to be performing "Imagine" soon.
 
GUYTON: Yes.

COOPER: Is it hard performing in Times Square?
 
GUYTON: Yes. I mean, obviously, I had a different vision for myself.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
COHEN: Yes, yes. 
 
GUYTON: I feel like it might have been a lot easier, but it's been amazing, like, truly.
 
COHEN: What's been the best part for you about the release of "House on Fire?"
 
GUYTON: Well, first of all, going on to your show, that was definitely one of the highlights of my life. And just releasing new music about love, you know, I've lit released a lot of heavy music, and this music is all about my love and my relationship. And so it's been really awesome to release that.
 
COOPER: Did you always I mean, did you sing from the time you were little?
 
GUYTON: Yes. I grew up singing in the church, Mount Olive Baptist Church. I know all y'all are watching at home.
 
COHEN: Wow.
 
GUYTON: But, yeah, that was where it all started for me.
 
COHEN: You've had a huge year.
 
GUYTON: Yes.
 
COHEN: I mean, like, huge.
 
GUYTON: This was probably one of my highlights for sure.
 
COHEN: This this?
 
GUYTON: Absolutely.
 
COHEN: Wow.
 
GUYTON: Even in the rain.
 
COHEN: Do you have any resolutions for next year?
 
GUYTON: You know, I'm letting go of negativity.
 
COHEN: Good.
 
GUYTON: I'm starting to give love to myself.
 
COHEN: Nice.
 
GUYTON: And releasing anything that does not serve me.
 
COHEN: Wow.
 
COOPER: Wow. That's good. It's a hard thing to do.
 
GUYTON: I -- we just have to, like, let go of things. Like, I just have to look at what's in front of me, and there's so much beauty. And there's so -- people are really, really good. And if I just put my phone down -- was that lightning?
 
COHEN: Oh, everything's good.
 
GUYTON: Was that thundering?
 
COHEN: No. No. No. No. That's not. They're making noise here.
 
GUYTON: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
 
COHEN: They're making noise. I want to talk to you about the year in music a little bit. OK? I want to hear what your kind of, playlist of the year has been. What song is currently stuck in your head?
 
GUYTON: Oh, man. You know, "Million Dollar Baby" is definitely, like, a song of mine. I love Vincent Boone's "Beautiful Things" Sabrina Carpenter, that whole album.

COHEN: Britney, if you're watching, and I know you are --
 
GUYTON: I love you.
 
COHEN: We want more music from you.
 
GUYTON: Yes. We do. Come on, girl.
 
COHEN: What is your favorite song to play to get everybody, on the dance floor on New Year's Eve?

COHEN: Do you have a -- who's your favorite country artist of all time?
 
GUYTON: Dolly Parton, hands down is my favorite country artist of all time.
