BECKY ANDERSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: One day after supporters of Jair Bolsonaro stormed government buildings in Brazil the armed forces have 
 
 restored peace.
 
China reopens its borders giving residents the chance to explore the world once again.
 
And Prince Harry accuses Queen Consort Camilla of leaking royal stories to the media in an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper. Harry's autobiography 
 
 out tomorrow.
 
Hello there. I'm Becky Anderson. Welcome to CONNECT THE WORLD. The time here in Abu Dhabi is 7:00 p.m.
 
Protesters are clearing out of Brazil's capital this hour after Sunday savage coup attempt. This is Brasilia right now, a sharp contrast to what 
 
 it looked like just 24 hours ago.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
By supporters of the former president Jair Bolsonaro is smashed windows and ransacked offices. The mob saying the election Bolsonaro lost last year was 
 
 rigged.
 
Well, from Chile to China world leaders are expressing outrage two years after an insurrection over his own election. U.S. President Joe Biden 
 
 called the riots an assault on democracy. CNN's Rafael Romo has been watching this unfold from Atlanta. Rafael, give us the big picture here. It 
 
 does appear to be a page out of the Trump supporter's playbook. Are we seeing a trend?
 
RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: There are definitely some eerie similarities, Becky. How are you? The situation is finally under control. 
 
 But it looks like a warzone. Some parts of Brasilia, the capital of Brazil do. And allow me to paint a picture of what transpired in the last 24 
 
 hours. Imagine for a moment that the January 6 mob here in the United States had not only breached the Capitol but also the White House and the 
 
 Supreme Court building.
 
That's exactly what happened in Brazil Sunday. An insurrection that ended with the arrest of at least 400 people left the main public buildings in 
 
 the country inoperable and deepened a political crisis that has been brewing for months.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ROMO (voice over): Brazil boiling over. Supporters of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro storm key buildings in the country's Capitol 
 
 Sunday breaching security barriers and temporarily occupying the country's congress, presidential palace and Supreme Court.
 
Masses of protesters flooded the country seat of power. Many dressed in the colors of Brazil's flag yellow and green, fueled by anger and distrust over 
 
 Bolsonaro's defeat in a runoff election last October where he lost by less than two percentage points to current President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
 
Protesters threw objects and scaled the roofs of buildings while clashing with police who responded with tear gas. At least one protester was seeing 
 
 sitting at the desk of Brazil's congress president. CNN Brazil reports the floor of the congress building was flooded after the sprinkler system 
 
 activated when protesters attempted to set fire to the carpet.
 
By evening police began dispersing the rioters from buildings and arrested hundreds of people who were detained in buses before being taken to the 
 
 police station. President Lula da Silva, who was inaugurated just a week ago describe the events as barbaric and vowed to punish the people 
 
 responsible.
 
LUIZ INACIO LULA DA SILVA, PRESIDENT OF BRAZIL (through translator): Those people that we call facets, we call them everything that's abominable in 
 
 politics.
 
They invaded the government headquarters. Then they invaded the congress like vandals destroying everything in their path.
 
ROMO: President Lula da Silva also blamed his predecessor for the lack of security in the capitol where Bolsonaro supporters have been camped out for 
 
 over a week. Bolsonaro, who is currently in Florida, denounce what he called the depredations and invasions of public buildings in a tweet, 
 
 adding that peaceful and lawful demonstrations are part of democracy.
 <br>[10:05:00]
 
But critics say Bolsonaro may have stirred up the crowds by repeatedly saying without evidence that he questioned the integrity of the country's 
 
 electronic voting system.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ROMO: And more details have emerged overnight about how violent some of the pro-Bolsonaro protesters became, Becky. At least 12 journalists were 
 
 attacked, robbed or had their equipment destroyed. A top local official in Brasilia said earlier this morning, that the situation is now under 
 
 control. Now back to you.
 
ANDERSON: So, we've heard in your report the response of Jair Bolsonaro. President Lula da Silva himself promising to crack down with the full force 
 
 of the law, and I quote him there. What happens to those protesters who have been arrested at this point?
 
ROMO: It's a very good question, Becky. And we're dealing with an unprecedented situation here. Let's remind our viewers that Brazil lived 
 
 for a while during a military dictatorship. But ever since the return to democracy, Brazil had never seen anything like that as we have seen in 
 
 previous images, some of those protesters were transported by buses. The treatment that they received was lenient, in many respects.
 
But the reality is that this is not only about the capital, Brasilia. It's also about protests that have surfaced over the last few weeks in places 
 
 like Sao Paulo, like Rio de Janeiro and remains to be seen what authorities are going to do in those instances. In the meantime, authorities say that 
 
 all of the camps that have been set up in places like the Capitol are to be dismantled within the next 24 hours, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Fascinating. Rafael, thank you. Well, Iran has sentenced three more protesters to death on charges of waging war against God. They were 
 
 convicted of killing three security officers during protests in November. Now this comes just days after Iran executed two men, also accused of 
 
 killing a member of the security forces. That brings the total number of people known to have been executed in connection with the protests to fall.
 
I want you to consider another number. 5s5. That is the average number of days between arrest and execution of those four people.
 
Meantime, in London.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON (voice over): Thousands of people braved, heavy rains on Sunday to protest the Iranian government. Let's bring in CNN's Jomana Karadsheh. 
 
 She's in Istanbul. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: She's been following this story closely from the outset back in September. We are seeing protests and we've just seen some in London. We -- 
 
 there were big calls for protests internationally. We are also seeing the continued it seems drip feed of announcements of executions for these 
 
 protesters. So, Jomana, how do you read the current situation?
 
JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Look, Becky. I mean, the activists have been for weeks warning that we are going to be seeing more 
 
 executions, a wave of executions of people protesters who have been arrested during the ongoing crackdown as fears that the regime appears to 
 
 be using the death penalty as a tool of political repression to try and crush dissent and to try and suppress these ongoing protests.
 
And this appears to be happening these latest this -- the latest executions of these two young men over the weekend, Becky, Mohammad Mehdi Karami, a 
 
 21-year-old Kurdish-Iranian karate champion and Seyed Mohammad Hosseini, a young man who dedicated his time to volunteering and coaching children for free. The regime accused 
 
 them of killing a member of the Basij paramilitary force during a protest near to run back in November.
 
But, Becky, as we are seeing with all these ongoing cases against protesters, we are hearing human rights organizations saying that they are 
 
 not receiving fair trials. Something that's not unusual, something that the regime has been accused of for decades. In the case of these two young men, 
 
 Amnesty International saying that this was a fast tracked, unfair sham group trial that bore no resemblance to judicial proceedings.
 
The United Nations saying that they were convicted based on forced confessions. And there's a lot of concern, Becky, that we are going to be 
 
 seeing more in the coming hours, in the coming days. I mean, a lot of concern raised in the past 24 hours over the fate of two young men who are 
 
 facing possible execution.
 <br>[10:10:00]
 
Their sentences were upheld last week. 19-year-old Mohammad Boroughani and 22-year-old Mohammad Ghobadlou. And after news came out last night reports 
 
 that are unconfirmed that they could possibly be facing execution that it was imminent. There was this remarkable scene outside the prison where 
 
 they're being held in Karaj outside of Iran where crowds gathered outside chanting against the regime.
 
The family members, the mother of one of these young men outside the prison trying to save these two from execution. And activists are saying, look, 
 
 the international community can do more now than just condemn and release the statements of outrage and condemnation that it should be putting more 
 
 pressure on the Iranian regime to try and stop these executions and save many more who are on death row, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Pope Francis slamming the use of the death penalty by the Iranian regime. I just want our viewers to hear what he said. The death penalty 
 
 cannot be employed for a purported state justice since it does not constitute a deterrent nor render justice to victims but only fuels a 
 
 threat for vengeance, he stressed. More on this of course, as we get it, Jomana, into a new year.
 
The second week of this new year still reporting on this story of protests in Iran, and now the aftermath of the protests and the Iranian state's 
 
 response to them. Jomana, thank you.
 
Well, to the war in Ukraine now. Kyiv is dismissing Moscow's claim that hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers were killed in a recent attack in 
 
 Kramatorsk. One Ukrainian commander called the report nonsense.
 
A CNN team on the ground and see no indication of mass casualties in the area.
 
In other developments, Ukraine and Russia exchanged 100 prisoners of war. 50 from each side. This is the 36th such swap.
 
Well, Pope Francis calling once again for an end to the conflict. He likened the war to crimes against God and humanity.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
POPE FRANCIS, HEAD OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH (through translator): Today, the third world war is taking place in a globalized world where conflicts 
 
 involve only certain areas of the planet directly, but in fact, involve them all. The closest and most recent example is certainly the war in 
 
 Ukraine, where it's the wake of death and destruction. With its attacks on civil infrastructures that caused lives to be lost.
 
Today, I feel bound to renew my appeal for an immediate end to the senseless conflict, whose effects are felt in entire regions, also outside 
 
 of Europe.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: CNN's Ben Wedeman joining us now live from Kramatorsk in Eastern Ukraine. Pope Francis appealing for an immediate end to what he calls this 
 
 senseless conflict. And Ben, is that likely?
 
BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: No, it's not. Certainly, what we're seeing in this part of Ukraine is, if anything, an 
 
 intensification of the fighting over the weekend, Kramatorsk was hit by seven Russian missiles just eight minutes after the expiration of the 
 
 unilateral Russian ceasefire. Now the Russians claimed 600 Ukrainian soldiers were killed. We went to the locations of those strikes just a few 
 
 hours later, saw no evidence of that.
 
We were back there today yet again, nothing that would indicate any veracity and the Russian claims. But what we are hearing is a very dramatic 
 
 intensification of the fighting in the town of the city of Bakhmut and the neighboring town of Soledar where we are hearing that the fighting has 
 
 reached the center of Soledar and the Ukrainian hold on that town now seems tenuous. Becky?
 
ANDERSON: Ukrainian President Zelenskyy praising the resistance of two eastern cities saying Bakhmut and Soledar were holding out against Russian 
 
 attacks. Ben?
 
WEDEMAN; Well, we were in Bakhmut over the weekend to report on the celebrations if you can call them that, of Orthodox Christmas. What we saw 
 
 is that indeed in Bakhmut, they are holding out but by the very tips of their fingers, the civilians, the few that are left there are trying to 
 
 mark this holiday but it was a very somber Christmas.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
WEDEMAN (voice over): There was no peace no silence in Bakhmut on the eve of Orthodox Christmas.
 <br>[10:15:02]
 
The unilateral Russian ceasefire never materialized. The guns didn't go silent. At one of the city's shelters, residents gather around a table laid 
 
 with food and tokens of the holiday.
 
Tatiana (ph), volunteer tries to raise spirits.
 
We wish you good health, peace, prosperity and all the best, she tells them. She knows it's important to put on a brave face.
 
Even though it's raining and snowing outside, I'm smiling, says Tatiana. I wish people a merry Christmas. I tried to show them it comes from my soul.
 
She did manage to bring a smile to the only child in the shelter, nine- year-old Volodymyr (ph). A And his wish on this day. I want this war to end and all my friends to return he says.  For the adults, the gift under this 
 
 tree is electricity to charge mobile phones and a wireless router connected to a satellite link up allowing for a tenuous connection to loved ones. To 
 
 reassure them however they can that they're still alive. Not well.
 
And here there's warmth in a city where public utilities were knocked out months ago. Yet it's hard to feel the holiday spirit, says Andre (ph).
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So sad day.
 
WEDEMAN: As the day progresses snow begins to fall, shelling continues. Christmas Eve dinner is a subdued affair in this basement, home for now to 
 
 a few doctors still left in Bakhmut. God blessed us with strength, patience and endurance is Dr. Elena Murchanova's (ph) dosed, but here strength has 
 
 its limits.
 
I feel pain she says, because I can't be with my family. I can't sit at the same table with my mother and daughter.
 
Christmas morning and no lead up into shelling.
 
WEDEMAN (on camera): For months Russian forces have tried to take this city but so far have failed. But in the process, according to one local 
 
 official, more than 60 percent of Bakhmut has been destroyed.
 
WEDEMAN (voice over): At the Church of All Saints, priests hold mass elite relative safety of the crypt. Candles provide the only light and warmth in 
 
 this the darkest of times.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
WEDEMAN: And those times may get darker with the fighting going on there. Today, in fact, in the morning, we saw Russian jets flying over the area of 
 
 Bakhmut and Soledar. Something we don't see very often. Ukrainian air defenses were trying to take them down. But they didn't seem to be able to 
 
 do that. And we continue to hear throughout the day. The thought of distance, artillery and rockets coming from that area. Becky?
 
ANDERSON: Ben Wedeman is on the ground. Ben, thank you.
 
Well, just ahead. Prince Harry calling Queen Consort Camilla dangerous. Find out why as Harry reveals more about his family.
 
Plus, despite rising COVID infections in some parts of China, the country has lifted a major COVID policy enticing thousands, if not hundreds of 
 
 thousands of people to flock to its borders.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:20:56]
 
ANDERSON: Welcome back. You're with CONNECT THE WORLD. I'm Becky Anderson for you. Now, Prince Harry adding to his allegations about the inner 
 
 workings of the British Royals ahead of Tuesday's release of his memoir spare. In two interviews with British and U.S. networks the Duke of Sussex 
 
 is also revealing more about his relationship with his closest family members.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
PRINCE HARRY, DUKE OF SUSSEX: None of anything that I've written anything I've included is ever intended to hurt my family. But it does give a full 
 
 picture of the situation as we were growing up. And also, squashes this idea that somehow my wife was the one that destroyed the relationship 
 
 between these two brothers.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, the prince admits he has changed since he met his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex but says he's happy he did. Well, CNN's Royal 
 
 Correspondent Max foster brings as more of Harry's latest revelations. Have a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
PRINCE HARRY: I love my father, I love my brother, I love my family, I always will always do.  Nothing of what I've done in this book or otherwise 
 
 has ever been any intention to harm them or hurt them.
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN ROYAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Prince Harry justifying his bombshell expose a of the royal family. The latest revelation that 
 
 Camilla, the Queen Consort, leaked stories in a campaign to be queen.
 
PRINCE HARRY: With a family built on hierarchy and with her on the way to being Queen Consort, there was going to be people or bodies left in the 
 
 street because of that.
 
FOSTER: Then there was the family's distrust of Meghan.
 
PRINCE HARRY: She's changed. She must be a witch.
 
FOSTER: Prince William and Kate didn't get on with Meghan, from the get go, he says.
 
PRINCE HARRY: Some of the things that my brother and sister know some of the way that they were acting or behaving definitely felt to me as though 
 
 unfortunately that stereotyping was causing a bit of a barrier to them really sort of introducing or welcoming her.
 
FOSTER (on camera): What do you mean specifically?
 
PRINCE HARRY: Well, American actress divorce, biracial, there's all different parts to that and what that can mean but if you are, like a lot 
 
 of my family do, if you are reading the press, the British tabloids at the same time as living the life, then there is a tendency where you can 
 
 actually end up living in the tabloid bubble rather than the actual reality.
 
FOSTER (voice over): He said he never accused the family of being racist when he and Meghan previously said someone had commented on their son's 
 
 skin color. He also admits to being naive about the way his family would be treated.
 
PRINCE HARRY: What Meghan had to go through was similar in some part to what can -- what Camilla went through. Very different circumstances. But 
 
 then you add in the race element, which was what the press -- British press jumped on straightaway. I went into this incredibly naA_ve. I had no idea 
 
 that British press was so bigoted. How I was probably bigoted.
 
FOSTER (on camera): You?
 
PRINCE HARRY: Before the relationship with Meghan.
 
FOSTER (voice over): The Duke of Sussex says his relationship did alter him, but for the better.
 
PRINCE HARRY: Yes. I did change. I'm really glad I changed because rather than getting drunk falling out of clubs taking drugs, I have now found the 
 
 love of my life.
 
FOSTER: Harry says he doesn't speak to his father or brother anymore. He was denied a seat on the plane to Scotland with them when Queen Elizabeth 
 
 died. So, has he burnt bridges with the rest of the family completely after sharing even more secrets?
 
PRINCE HARRY: Well, they've shown absolutely no willingness to reconcile up to this point. And I'm not sure how honest is burning bridges. Silence only 
 
 allows the abuser to abuse, right? So, I don't know how staying silent is ever going to make things better.
 
FOSTER: Max Foster, CNN, London.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON: And a quick programming note for you.  Tune in later for a special report on Prince Harry's accusations against Britain's Royal Family 
 
 and other details from his book. That especially includes Anderson Cooper's conversation with the prince which was recorded for Sunday's edition of 60 
 
 Minutes on CBS. CNN's A.C. 360 special.
 <br>[10:25:06]
 
The Harry interview which airs at 8:00 p.m. Monday on the U.S. East Coast. If you're watching here in Abu Dhabi, that would be 5:00 a.m. Tuesday 
 
 morning right here on CNN.
 
Well, after three years of strict COVID rules, China has reopened borders that have been shuttered to travelers despite nearly 89 percent of China's 
 
 Hainan province being infected with COVID-19. For example, thousands of people flowed into the country on Sunday on its first day of quarantine 
 
 free travel since the pandemic began in 2020. A move that comes after it experienced historic protests over its zero-COVID policy.
 
CNN's Kristie Lu Stout spoke with a few travelers who are excited to be reunited with loved ones.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN ANCHCOR: I'm at Lok Ma Chau station located in Hong Kong's New Territories right across the border from Shenzen, the Chinese 
 
 tech capital. And this is the freshly reopened rail crossing between Hong Kong and mainland China. It had been closed since February of 2020, due to 
 
 the COVID-19 pandemic and it was opened on Sunday and we've been witnessing a steady stream of travelers coming through.
 
Now quarantine is no longer a requirement. But a number of pandemic restrictions are in place. For example, the mask mandate remains out in 
 
 force. In addition to that, travelers must show proof of a negative COVID- 19 PCR tests before their journey. And this is going to be a phased reopening, you know, up to 60,000 travelers can travel each day from 
 
 mainland China to Hong Kong and vice versa from seven different checkpoints.
 
Including this one where I'm standing from and the demand has been absolutely huge. In fact, as of Sunday evening, over 440,000 Hong Kong 
 
 residents have signed up for a chance to make the journey. And earlier today, we spoke to a couple of them.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): I'm really very happy about the reopening. I'm going to Shenzen first and then we'll fly to Chongqing for a 
 
 few days. I feel like we are going back to pre-COVID times three years ago. I will be much happier and life will turn out for the better.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEFMALE (through translator): We are going home. We'll see grandpa and grandma. Very happy.
 
LU STOUT: The return across border travel has raised hopes of rebooting Hong Kong's economy which was hammered hard due to the pandemic and the 
 
 fact that Hong Kong was isolated for nearly three years. But according to the chairman of the Hong Kong tourism board may take one or two years 
 
 before tourism here returns to pre-pandemic levels.
 
Kristie Lu Stout, CNN at the Hong Kong-Shenzen border.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
COHEN: Well, let's get you up to speed on some of the other stories that are on our radar right now here on CONNECT THE WORLD. And protests in 
 
 Chongqing in China have been clashing with police over a massive layoff from a factory that produces rapid antigen COVID tests. 
 
Employees say their managers told them to go on holiday early effectively terminating their jobs. The demand for COVID antigen testing as you will 
 
 understand is decreased since China loosened its zero-COVID policy.
 
Well, German authorities aren't investigating whether two Iranian nationals planned a terrorist attack in Germany. A 32-year-old Iranian man and his 
 
 25-year-old brother were arrested. Prosecutors believe they prepared an Islamist motivated attacked by procuring cyanide and ricin.
 
Well, shipping traffic in the Suez Canal is back to normal after tugs towed a cargo vessel that had broken down during its passage through the 
 
 waterway. In 2021, you'll remember a massive container ship the Ever Given became stuck in the canal. It blocked traffic for six days before it was 
 
 dislodged, disrupting global supply chains.
 
Well, up next on CONNECT THE WORLD. A long time coming. Joe Biden becomes the first U.S. president to visit Mexico since 2014. We'll tell you what he 
 
 will be doing on that visit in just a moment.
 
Plus, the spotlight will be on Southwestern England in several hours as the country gears up for its first rocket launch. What this means for the 
 
 U.K.'s big ambition in space.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:32:03]
 
ANDERSON: Welcome back. I'm Becky Anderson in Abu Dhabi. You're watching CONNECT THE WORLD. Let's get you the latest on our top story. Chaos 
 
 subsiding in Brazil's capital as protesters there do appear to be clearing out their brazen demonstrations in support of former President Jair 
 
 Bolsonaro came to a head yesterday with this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON (voice over): Well, they stormed three main government buildings causing an incredible amount of damage and drawing comparisons to the U.S. 
 
 Capitol insurrection two years ago.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: U.S. President Joe Biden watching the situation in Brazil from another Latin American country at least he arrived in Mexico City on Sunday 
 
 for a two-day summit with the leaders of Canada and Mexico. Their agenda is full of talks about immigration, trade and other issues. It's the first 
 
 visit by a U.S. president to neighboring Mexico since 2014. While on his way to Mexico City, Mr. Biden stopped in El Paso, Texas, U.S. side of the 
 
 border to get a firsthand look at the migrant crisis that has been brewing there.
 
But reporters say they didn't see the president interact with any migrants during that visit. Well, CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is in Mexico City. It's 
 
 been almost nine years since a U.S. president visited Mexico, which does beg the question why has it taken so long?
 
PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: Well, and there's no doubt that it is a critical time for the presidents to be meeting. I just want to 
 
 note that moments ago a joint statement from President Biden, the Mexican president, Canadian Prime Minister, addressing those attacks in Brazil, 
 
 saying they condemned the attacks on Brazil's democracy. They stand with Brazil and they look forward to working with President Lula.
 
So, that all is looming over this summit here in Mexico City, in addition to what you laid out on migration. This is an issue that the U.S. and 
 
 Mexico have historically worked very closely on, and is very significant now as there is unprecedented mass movement of people in the Western 
 
 Hemisphere. It's an issue that has become a political liability for President Biden domestically, and one that he is working to address both 
 
 with members of Congress but also here in Mexico in trying to seek that assistance.
 
And it is important because oftentimes, as the U.S. rolls out policies to try to stem the flow of migration to the U.S. southern border. They require 
 
 agreement from Mexico that became clear when the president announced last week, a new program for migrants from Nicaragua, Haiti, Cuba and Venezuela 
 
 to apply to come to the United States. And if they didn't do so they could be turned back under COVID-era restriction and turn back to Mexico.
 
So again, it is a program in which the two countries have to work together.
 <br>[10:35:02]
 
So that is something that we will likely hear more about during this summit as well as on issues like economic development, climate change and security 
 
 in particular on fentanyl. So again, this is a relationship that has at times been tense between President Biden and Mexican president Lopez 
 
 Obrador. Recall that last year, the Mexican president snubbed a summit in Los Angeles on migration, though there was representation from the country.
 
So, we'll see that play out here in Mexico over the next day and tomorrow. And again, the three leaders coming out against those attacks in Brazil, 
 
 which is going to now be an issue in addition to all the other agenda items. Becky?
 
ANDERSON: It is remarkable, isn't it? You can see the significance of the opioid crisis in the U.S. when fentanyl is on the agenda alongside issues 
 
 like climate crisis, trade deals, and the like. Important stuff. We will keep an eye on what is going on there. Priscilla, thank you very much 
 
 indeed.
 
Coming up. The U.K. trying to forge a new path into the global space race. See our preparations are going for the country's first ever orbital launch, 
 
 which will happen later today.
 
And the Buffalo Bills were back in action as signs of support for player Damar Hamlin continue to pour in from everywhere. More details in our 
 
 sports update is after this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: Well, the first ever orbital rocket launch on British soil is set to take place in the coming hours. This modified jumbo jet called Cosmic 
 
 Girl is part of Virgin Orbit's start me up mission as it's known. It's scheduled to take off from Cornwall in southwest England to deploy a rocket 
 
 which would put nine satellites into orbit.
 
Now, if successful, this will be a major milestone for the U.K.'s growing space industry. CNN Correspondent Tom Foreman joining us live from 
 
 Washington, D.C. Tell us more about what is -- it as we said an historic mission certainly for the U.K., Tom.
 
TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Oh, it's an historic mission not just for the U.K. but for the world really because one of the goals from the 
 
 beginning from Virgin orbit was to make space launches open to many, many nations that otherwise might not be in the game. The U.K. would be the 11th 
 
 nation to really be into the space game in terms of launching their own material. A lot of countries make satellites. A lot of countries need 
 
 things done in space.
 
By doing this from an airplane. The advantages are, this one, you fly the airplane through some of the densest parts of the atmosphere. That save 
 
 them the thrust you need to begin with. You angle the plane up as you get toward launch time.
 <br>[10:40:02]
 
They release this, it falls for about four seconds then launcher which about 70 feet long, accelerates to roughly 8000 miles an hour. And it's 
 
 going to put these satellites into what's called heliocentric orbit or heliosynchronous orbit, which means it'll fly around the north and south 
 
 pole. And that puts the satellite roughly over the same spot each time each day. So, if you're trying to get great images of London to show the effects 
 
 of atmosphere, or pollution, or anything else, you get the same picture each day that gives you a way of measuring that.
 
The technology is remarkable. And doing this could open space to many other nations in a way that generally land-based launches are a little bit more 
 
 limited. This is a very flexible system. That's the purpose of it.
 
ANDERSON: This is fascinating. And, you know, you are I know, not just a brilliant reporter of fabulous facts that we need around a story like this. 
 
 But you have an added layer on this story in that, as I understand it, your daughter, who is an aerospace engineer, actually worked on the design or 
 
 construction of this -- of this rocket. So, you have a real insight into what is going on here.
 
And when you talk to her, how big a deal is this? Because I know she's imbued in this industry.
 
FOREMAN: She is -- she knows a tremendous amount about this industry. She does not work for Virgin orbit anymore. She's moved on to other space 
 
 companies, but she's -- but what's unusual about this, every spaceflight is unusual. This is really unusual. We're talking about small satellites here, 
 
 not giant launches. But we're talking about tremendous flexibility. That's one of their goals from the beginning.
 
Not only to be able to go to different nations and launch, but to be able to launch quickly. So, let's say you had a natural disaster and you had 
 
 reason to say we want some specific satellites launched quickly over this area to help monitor what's going here. This is the kind of system you 
 
 might more likely rely on. This is a very unusual system. What they're doing is challenging. They've had six launches, five of which were 
 
 successful.
 
They'd like to have a whole lot more but I will tell you this, probably most people in the U.K. if they look up at the right time tonight in the 
 
 clouds aren't there, they may be actually able to see this happen. Pretty remarkable.
 
ANDERSON: This is absolutely fascinating, isn't it? I mean, it's so -- it's such an interesting time for the space industry as a whole. When I live 
 
 here in the UAE, there's an enormous burgeoning not just appetite for an interest in space here but industry in and of itself which has been built 
 
 up p over the last decade or so. Another country that's sort of new to this game, relatively new to this game. It's fascinating to see the U.K. getting 
 
 involved as well in this space launches.
 
Tom, it's always good to have you. Particularly good to have you on this story and send your daughter our best.

ANDERSON: It's been an emotional 24 hours for one NFL player who suffered a cardiac arrest last week. Let me bring in the -- my colleague Amanda 
 
 Davies. Because from his hospital bed, the Buffalo Bills safety routed for his teammates as they played against the New England Patriots. Amanda, we 
 
 know what happened. How is he and what happens next?
 
AMANDA DAVIES, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR: I think back it's very difficult not to smile, seeing those pictures of Damar Hamlin sitting up in his hospital bed 
 
 with the heart sign which so many of his friends, his teammates, fans from around the world have been sending for the love of three because three is 
 
 the number he plays with on his jersey for the Bills. And you say it's been an emotional 24 hours. It has been an incredibly emotional seven days.
 
It was just seven days ago that he collapsed on the field for the Bills. They were in action for their first match since that moment on Sunday 
 
 night. It was wonderful to see him being able to react, live tweet on social media to all the tributes, the love being paid in his direction. And 
 
 we didn't know what impact these last seven days would have on his teammates as they took to the fields against the New England Patriots.
 
In their first match. I can tell you, it was pretty special. And we've got news of that coming up in just a couple of minutes.
 
ANDERSON: Can't wait. It's good to see you. And we will look forward to World Sport coming up after this short break. We're back with CONNECT THE 
 
 WORLD after that. So, please stay with us.
