<br>[15:30:00] 
 
DEREK VAN DAM, CNN METEOROLOGIST: ...and the constellations. Right now, it is out of phase by six months. Normally, it is the sun that totally washes them out in this sky, and right now, you guys, this is happening.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I love you. Will you marry me? 
 
VAN DAM: An engagement during a total solar eclipse. OK, this is a supernatural moment as the sun comes back.
 
True love story cemented in the darkness of a total solar eclipse now written in history. I would like to know how you guys timed this so perfectly. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't know but we did.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: She had no idea this was happening, and I didn't know what to do. That's how. 
 
VAN DAM: This is a spectacular moment, and congratulations, and the entire world has just seen you become engaged couples. How do you feel? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, her mother got what she wanted.
 
VAN DAM: Congratulations. That is an amazing moment. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you so much. 
 
VAN DAM: I wish you guys the best of your marriage. Really incredible. 
 
I was speaking to them. Oh, these guys getting excited. I was talking. 
 
What are you feeling right now? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE)
 
VAN DAM: We've seen an engagement. We heard the roars, the screams. It's no longer safe to look at the sun because it's emitting that energy, but we have seen the parhelic arc that is the ice crystals in the cirrus clouds high up in the atmosphere that is taking and reflecting the sun's light that has now entered back into this highest peak in Vermont and created that circle. 
 
Another rare event. You guys just experienced something that is a once-in-a-lifetime moment. Did you know that it is every 375 years for a total solar eclipse to occur on any one point in the planet? What do you think about that? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's unbelievable.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I did not know that. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're unbelievably lucky to have an experience like that. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So lucky.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm so lucky to do it young, too. It's amazing. 
 
VAN DAM: So will you go and travel to see another? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, absolutely. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't care where it is in the world. I will go and see it. That was the coolest thing I've ever done.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Dude, absolutely. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hell, we'll go and bring the hats the next time. You got to meet us. You got to meet us again. 
 
VAN DAM: I will travel with you because we are all ombrophiles, which means that we love shadow and we chase solar eclipses. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Absolutely.
 
VAN DAM: And I've done it before. I will do it again. This experience is just out of this world.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's unbelievable. We're so unbelievably lucky. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Like I knew what was going to happen, but still, when I saw it, like that just completely took my ability to speak away.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Being able to take your glasses off and then like seeing it for the first time was shocking. I let down my spine. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I had tingles in my spine. 
 
VAN DAM: I had a tear because as a meteorologist -- 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You dream for these days, man. 
 
VAN DAM: I dream for these days. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You dream for these days.
 
VAN DAM: And to have this occur on a snow-capped mountain, on the tallest mountain in Vermont, during this incredible, incredible, you know, celestial dance, we call it. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You can't beat it. 
 
VAN DAM: You can't beat it. 
 
You guys, we witnessed everything. Brianna, Boris, I'm flabbergasted. I'm speechless. I saw something that I have dreamt of for --
 
Thank you.
 
That I've dreamt of for years. We've seen this coming for years, and now we just witnessed it. You heard the enthusiasm of the crowd.
 
As a meteorologist, I'm dumbfounded. It was spectacular, and I want to do it again. It was so wonderful.
 
BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: I'm thinking Iceland, group trip. How about that, Derek? We'll just all go a couple of years. We just have to follow it around the world. That's what we're going to do, I think. But how about that proposal? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Only if of all -- that was amazing. I can't believe it. And what shocked me the most about it is that he timed it as the total solar eclipse was ending. So the sun was coming back over this snow-capped mountaintop, and it illuminated -- it almost felt like it illuminated the couple as they were getting engaged. I mean, you can't make that stuff up. It was perfect, and now it's cemented in history forever. What a magical moment. 
 
KEILAR: What does he do for the anniversary? 
 
BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN HOST: That's going to be tough.
 
KEILAR: What do they do for the wedding? It's going to be tough to top that, yes. Maybe they go up in history forever. 
 
VAN DAM: What a magical moment.
 
KEILAR: What does he do for the anniversary? That's going to be tough. What do they do for the wedding? 
 
SANCHEZ: It's going to be tough to top that, yes. 
 
HILL: Maybe they go up in history forever.
 
VAN DAM: How do you top that? Well, that's a great question. You guys, one of the most amazing things for me was watching the moon's shadow. That was incredible.
 
SANCHEZ: Derek Van Dam for us. KEILAR: It really was. It totally is an amazing phenomenon. All of the
 
 different parts of it. Look at this. It's so stunning. All right, we are keeping an eye on this.
 
This is now moving through Maine and then it will continue into Canada. We're going to get in a quick break. We'll be right back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
SANCHEZ: We're getting some live pictures now as we watch the eclipse across America. This is from Holton, Maine. One of the last places in the United States that is going to experience today's total eclipse.
 
We've watched it through the entire path of totality and it has been awe-inspiring. Millions of Americans today soaking up this spectacular view. 
 
KEILAR: After this, there's not much through Canada it's going to go through New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland, and then that's it. That's really the end of this. Scientists have had a very unique opportunity in this to get a glimpse of the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere.
 
So joining us now to talk a little bit about that is Janet Ivey, who is the CEO and founder of Janet's Planet. Janet, tell us what scientists can learn from today. Actually, you know what? Can you just start off by telling us -- I feel like I asked the scientists the science question and then they go immediately to their like emotional reactions because it is incredibly emotional. So what was your reaction to seeing this? 
 
JANET IVEY, CEO AND FOUNDER, JANET'S PLANET: It was just incredible. It's like I'm with a group of people that saw it back in 2017 in Nashville. I'm in Goreville, Illinois today with some of those same people.
 
And again, it's just -- it's one of those moments. It's like we've seen everybody along the path go, oh my gosh, this is just a spiritual experience nearly. And I cried. I cried watching the couple get engaged. Do you know what I mean? 
 
I think what is so lovely before we get into the science is just the fact that think about this. As a nation, we are all looking up. We are all having a shared experience. And how I wish that we could take this all, this inspiration, this united thing that we're all experiencing today and wrap that into some unity in our own country. 
 
But the thing that scientists are gathering and many people participated in citizen science, they wanted to see what the animals were doing.
 
You talked about the birds flying around crazily. Back in Nashville in 2017, the giraffes like loped around, like going, what's happening? The flamingos went and covered their babies. So we can learn a lot about what animals do or don't do in these times. [15:40:00]
 
We can also kind of like, did you guys see that beautiful prominence, that solar flare that was happening at about 6 p.m.? We're never able to see that with our human eyes unless we have totality. And so again, there's still so much to understand.
 
Why is our corona hotter than the surface of the sun? Why in solar maximum, you know, why does that happen and affect space weather so much? And again, we're going to get more reports about temperature and how that, when we don't have the radiative power of the sun, temperature drops. Cloud cover. For many people that cross their fingers, it's like they saw clouds dissipate today.
 
So that interplay of heat and light and cooling and clouds, it's just, it's like the list is very long, but I think most importantly, to share this as a shared experience with tons and tons of millions of people, getting to do that today is quite incredible. 
 
SANCHEZ: And Janet, I know that part of today has special significance for you in your work, because we saw so many families out here today and young kids experiencing this celestial moment. It's quite possible that what we witnessed today inspires the next generation of astronauts and scientists and kids that have this attraction to the stars.
 
IVEY: That is what you hope. It's like, I've been touring most of this spring talking about the solar system and this upcoming solar eclipse. And even here today with little ones, I was showing them how they could view like the kind of like, you know, progression of the eclipse through a Ritz cracker with our sun to the back.
 
So what you hope is, is that this is that introduction, that inciting moment, almost of their hero's journey to science. And hopefully that did spur some young people to go, wow, science is magical and cool. It's magic, but it's science. And I can be part of this amazing thing. 
 
We heard from Kelly Korek at NASA, who's the, you know, astrophysicist there. And she's talking about all the things they're studying. So hopefully through the eyes of astronauts and NASA folks and just regular, regular people and many of the meteorologists who have also been in awe, maybe there've been a few meteorologists who have been birthed today as well. 
 
KEILAR: Yes, no, exactly right. Why is NASA, was NASA shooting rockets up during the solar eclipse? Tell us the things that can only be learned during a solar eclipse.
 
IVEY: Yes, I mean, the thing is, it's like you want to get above kind of like that cloud line. And so they can see, and it's like light up things in different ways and see again, it's like peer a little more deeply into the chromosphere, peer a little more deeply into that sun's corona. And again, a lot of times the different colors through a process called spectroscopy, we can tell a lot about the chemical makeup, the things that are going on. And again, it's like this, they will collect the data, all the citizen science data will come flooding in. And then soon there will be a great report. And I think it will be -- I think it'll be quite incredible to like read what they've discovered in this time of solar maximum.
 
And another year we'll go back to a time of solar minimum with the sun. So it won't be as active as it was today. I'm pretty sure they were also trying to make sure they were getting any images of that crazy, you know, Comet Pons Brooks and to see if it did any off gassing.
 
It's like where I am, we did see Venus and Jupiter. We did not get a good glimpse of that comet. But again, scientists are looking for, again, is there any, you know, way that we can understand the sun and its weather and the kind of like a solar wind and all that's happening.
 
So I'm just excited that everybody had a chance to look up today. And I hope that everybody was all inspired. 
 
SANCHEZ: To say the least, it was an incredible experience. Janet Ivey, we appreciate you sharing what you enjoyed most about the eclipse. Thanks for being with us. 
 
IVEY: All right, bye guys. Thank you. 
 
SANCHEZ: So from Mexico to Vermont, of course, from Mexico to Vermont, we've taken you across North America, bringing you just some of the breathtaking moments as millions of people experience the total solar eclipse. But we are not done yet.
 
We're tracking where it is right now after this. 
 <br>[15:45:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
SANCHEZ: Welcome back to CNN special coverage, ECLIPSE ACROSS AMERICA. It has been a jam-packed, busy, emotional day. We're live at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway where around 40,000 people just got a show unlike any other.
 
KEILAR: You don't really know how you're going to react. 
 
SANCHEZ: Of course not. 
 
KEILAR: It's a very amazing thing to witness, and we've already seen totality now across most of North America. 
 <br>[15:50:02]
 
In fact, it just concluded a few minutes ago. There are still areas that are getting to experience totality. That includes parts of Canada. So who has the very best view right now? We have CNN's Chad Myers, who has been tracking the path of the eclipse all day. Chad, tell us what you're seeing. 
 
CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST: You would have to be on a boat off the coast of Newfoundland right now because the totality has just moved offshore, literally like 45 seconds ago.
 
Has moved offshore, and now it's back over the Atlantic Ocean. But what a show. I had the pleasure of watching the entire thing and how I was -- the hair was standing up on the back of my neck and I had goosebumps in Mazatlan with the first eclipse there with people just cheering, and I wasn't expecting that. And then all of a sudden you're back over Mexico. 
 
Some clouds over Kerrville, yes, but then the animals with Ted's -- you know, the shot there at the zoo across Dallas, Texas was amazing. 
 
We're getting 350 people married here in parts of Arkansas, and then finally up toward you into Indianapolis where we talked to the space shuttle astronauts that have just about seen anything you can possibly see from space, and they were amazed.
 
And then of course, Harry Enten, who had the clouds over my hometown in Buffalo and Niagara Falls, and awesome stuff from our Derek Van Dam across parts of Vermont with the couple getting married. 
 
So yes, it's over, but I'll tell you what, we could have had a lot worse weather here. The clouds could have been a lot thicker and they weren't. That's the good news. Now we do have a tornado watch that was just posted as we expected across parts of East Texas. Those going home have to watch out for that.
 
SANCHEZ: A lot to still keep an eye on. Chad Myers, thanks for walking us through that. 
 
Still more to come on the special coverage of ECLIPSE ACROSS AMERICA.
 
If you missed any of the special events today, we're going to wrap them up as soon as we come back. 
 <br>[15:55:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
KEILAR: In case you missed the total solar eclipse across North America, we have put together some spectacular moments from today's rare event. Here they are.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KEILAR: The moon will be going in front of the sun. Bora Sanchez in this point.
 
SANCHEZ: We're witnessing a moment unlike any other. This doesn't happen, as far as we know, just about anywhere else in the universe. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Very clean light that is coming through.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And as you can see, now the darkness is really starting to settle in. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I feel the emotion from people up. And there's the sound saying, it's time to put your glasses back on.
 
Oh, wow, that's amazing. It looks like something out of a sci-fi movie. Oh, wow, wow, that is absolutely stellar.
 
Romantic interlude, if you will, since I'm here in Arkansas, where everyone else has just gotten married down here. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: God was it glorious. Dad, what did you think? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Amazing.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are watching Bailey's Beads. Right now, you guys, this is happening. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I love you. Will you marry me? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes! 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
KEILAR: Thank God she said yes. 
 
SANCHEZ: Yes, that would have been quite awkward. Such an amazing show that the universe put on.
 
The next opportunity to see a solar eclipse in the United States won't be until 2044. We hope you'll tune in to CNN NEWS CENTRAL special coverage of that eclipse when it happens. 
 
Brianna, as we were standing out there, I realize you were emotional, as I was, but at one point, it overwhelmed you. Talk to us about that. 
 
KEILAR: Oh my goodness, as it was starting, I just was like a ball baby. I was sobbing, and I don't know, I just was sort of struck by the moment. It was really -- I was sort of thinking about who was not here with me, if I'm being honest, and that made me sad. 
 <br>[16:00:00]
 
And then I was thinking about who I wanted to be here with me in the future, and so I would like to see another one, and until then, I'll have to save this T-shirt. 
 
SANCHEZ: The eclipse.
 
KEILAR: You'll have to save that one, Boris Sanchez. 
 
SANCHEZ: This very fine shirt that Brianna produce for us. It's been so emotional watching the path of totality across North America. It's been such a treat to join you. Thank you so much for being with us this afternoon.
 
KEILAR: And "THE LEAD with" Jake Tapper starts right now.
