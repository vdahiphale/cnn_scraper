JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR:  You can follow the show on X, @TheLeadCNN. If you ever miss an episode of the lead, you can listen to the show whence you get 
 
 your podcasts. The news continues on CNN with Wolf Blitzer right next door in a place I like to call The Situation Room. I will see you tomorrow from 
 
 the great City of Philadelphia.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN ANCHOR, FIRST MOVE:  It's 5:00 a.m. in Hanoi, 11:00 p.m. in London, and 6:00 p.m. here in New York. I'm Julia Chatterley. And 
 
 wherever you are in the world, this is your "First Move."
 
A warm welcome to "First Move," as always. And here's today's need to know. Legendary actor James Earl Jones has passed away. He was 93 years old. 
 
 Debate day. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump prepare for the presidential face off with just over 24 hours to go. Royal relief. Catherine, Princess 
 
 of Wales, finishing months of chemotherapy and will now gradually return to public life. And the Sweet 16 for Apple. The tech giant unveiling a new 
 
 A.I. driven iPhone. But what does that actually mean in practice? That conversation and plenty more coming up.
 
But first, sad news today, James Earl Jones, the legendary actor of stage and screen, has died at the age of 93. He was the voice of "Star Wars" 
 
 villain Darth Vader and Mufasa in "The Lion King." He played larger than life roles, including in "Field of Dreams," and with gravitas, he lent his 
 
 voice to this network, delivering the iconic tagline, this is CNN. Richard Roth looks back at his incredible life.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
RICHARD ROTH, CNN SENIOR UN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  James Earl Jones was a physically imposing actor.
 
JAMES EARL JONES, ACTOR:  I take it back, you're not in trouble. You're dead where you stand.
 
Join me.
 
ROTH (voice-over):  But it will be Jones' voice that audiences will long remember. Luke Skywalker learned that in the "Star Wars series."
 
JONES:  No. I am your father.
 
It became a big mystery. Who is that? Who is that inside the mask?
 
ROTH (voice-over):  A different actor played Vader, but director George Lucas realized he needed a villain with a more sinister voice.
 
JONES:  Call me and said, you want to do a day's work? And I said, yes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  A day's work?
 
JONES:  Two and a half hours. Yes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That's all?  All the Darth Vader languages in two and a half hours?
 
JONES:  Yes. A few thousand dollars. I went home.
 
A city destroyed.
 
The key to Darth Vader is a narrow band of expression. No inflections. He's not human.
 
Father and son.
 
ROTH (voice-over):  Jones returned to the role of the Imperial villain throughout his career, even at age 91 in the Disney Plus series, "Obi Wan 
 
 Kenobi."
 
JONES:  You will suffer.
 
ROTH (voice-over):  In another memorable voice only role, Jones said just three words.
 
JONES:  This is CNN.
 
What happened was that I did the goodwill games. They said, well, now can we do a CNN logo? And I came back from a separate session. It was so short. 
 
 I mean, it took five minutes, right? And I forgot it.
 
ROTH (voice-over):  What is unforgettable is that this powerful actor with the deep, authoritative voice had a speaking disability.
 
JONES:  Stuttering was so embarrassing and really painful. I went mute from the age of eight to 14.
 
ROTH (voice-over):  Jones said a great teacher in high school who loved poetry helped him.
 
JONES:  He discovered I wrote poetry and he got me to read my poetry in front of the class. And when I did, it didn't stutter.
 
ROTH (voice-over):  As a teenager, Jones wanted to be a military officer. He eventually ended up in an American nuclear bomber in his first movie 
 
 role. The instructions, attack the Soviet Union in "Dr. Strangelove."
 
JONES:  Bomb door circuits. Negative function.
 
ROTH (voice-over):  A long list of screen roles would follow, including "Roots."
 
JONES:  Avanil Kunta Kinte (ph).
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The guests are waiting, Your Majesty.
 
JONES:  Let them wait.
 
ROTH (voice-over):  "Coming to America."
 
JONES:  It'll be as if they dip themselves in magic waters.
 
ROTH (voice-over):  "Field of Dreams." "The Hunt for Red October."
 
JONES:  Mother of God. We know he's escaped.
 
ROTH (voice-over):  "Patriot Games.
 
JONES:  The sun will set on my time here.
 
ROTH (voice-over):  And "The Lion King." The stage, though, was his first love. Jones won a Tony Award in 1969 for "The Great White Hope."
 
JONES:  This is your wish coming true, huh?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Never this. Never this.
 
ROTH (voice-over):  Nominated, too, for an Oscar in the movie version. Jones was part of an elite acting group. He won an Oscar, a Grammy, three 
 
 Emmys, and three Tonys, including a Lifetime Achievement Award in 2017. Had he done it all in life?
 
JONES:  I'm not sure if I want to do it all because, you know, I -- death is OK. It is something that happens to all of us, and that's kind of 
 
 glorious, isn't it?
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 <br>[18:05:00]
 
CHATTERLEY:  The resonance in that voice. The actor James Earl Jones, who died today. Now, in just over 24 hours' time, the first and perhaps only 
 
 presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and Former President Donald Trump will take place in the crucial battleground State of 
 
 Pennsylvania.
 
The highly consequential face off couldn't come at a more pivotal time, with new CNN poll of polls showing the race for the White House is a dead 
 
 heat. 49 percent for Harris to Trump's 48 percent. It also comes as the latest New York Times/Siena College poll shows 28 percent of voters still 
 
 want more information about Harris compared with just 9 percent saying they need to know more about Trump.
 
The Trump campaign on Monday previewed some of the perhaps lines of attack their candidate could use during the debate saying, Harris', quote, "owns 
 
 everything" from the Biden administration, and that includes the illegal immigration crisis and the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan.
 
And in a radio interview with the vice president released Monday, that also gives some insight into her thinking too.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE:  He plays from this really old and tired playbook, right? Where 
 
 he -- there's no floor for him in terms of How low he will go, and we should be prepared for that, we should be prepared for the fact that he is 
 
 not burdened by telling the truth.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHATTERLEY:  Stephen Collinson joins us now. Stephen, good to have you with us. For all the enthusiasm, the breathless coverage of the Democrats switch 
 
 to Harris, the millions of dollars in campaign donations, they're still neck-and-neck.
 
Does that say more, perhaps, about the polls and how much we should trust them or the candidates and their policies? Because if it's the latter, it 
 
 makes this debate really pivotal?
 
STEPHEN COLLINSON, CNN POLITICS SENIOR REPORTER:  Yes, I think it tells us a lot about where the country is. I really do think this is a hugely 
 
 difficult test for the Vice President. She is coming into this debate against one of the most menacing political figures in modern history. He's 
 
 had repeated experience in debates. She is set on the very difficult task of trying to turn around an election that the Democrats thought they were 
 
 losing.
 
She said -- she had, as you suggested, a very good convention. She had a surge of momentum when she took over the ticket from President Joe Biden. 
 
 But so far, she's not been able to ride that surge to a clear path to 270 electoral votes that are needed to win the presidency. In fact, if the 
 
 election were held today, I think it's more likely that Trump would win than Harris would.
 
So, this debate is critical for her to build a platform that she can then use to go after that 28 percent of voters who want to know more about her 
 
 in the eight weeks before the election.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes, something you said there resonated -- or lots of it, but one something in particular, the transport secretary, Pete Buttigieg, told 
 
 CNN this weekend, and I'm going to quote, "It will take almost superhuman focus and discipline to deal with Donald Trump in a debate."
 
And to your point, we know what Donald Trump's like, and he's done this many times before. This is her first. What can we expect from Kamala Harris 
 
 in this kind of debate?
 
COLLINSON:  The challenge for her, I think, and I'm sure this is something that they've been practicing as she's holed up in Pittsburgh with her team, 
 
 is how to parry and push back against some of Trump's attacks and frankly, falsehoods that he's bound to spout during his answers while still getting 
 
 across her message that she understands the pain a lot of Americans are facing from high grocery prices, the impact of high interest rates to fight 
 
 inflation, the difficulty getting on the housing ladder, high rents, that she understands all of that, and she has a plan to affect it and to make it 
 
 better.
 
At the same time, she's creating this overarching narrative that Americans don't have to go through all that chaos and bitterness that Trump 
 
 represented in his first term and which he may manifest on stage on Tuesday night. They can choose something different. So, it's all about the 
 
 credibility of her character, her political skills and her policies as to whether those voters who want to know more about her, perceive her as a 
 
 potentially effective president.
 
CHATTERLEY:  And that's huge. I mean, I mentioned those poll numbers, 28 percent of likely voters need to know more about Harris. It's 9 percent for 
 
 the former president. Again, he's a known quantity. So, in many respects, the challenge really is on her to announce, let the nation know who she is 
 
 and really what she represents versus him, that I think what you see is what you get, and you know what you're going to get. We've seen it.
 
COLLINSON:  Yes, there is room for growth for her, obviously, in that number. You know, it seems strange that she's been the vice president for 
 
 four years and many people don't know very much about her. But I think it's fair to say she didn't have a high-profile vice presidency in comparison to 
 
 some recent presidents like Dick Cheney, for example, and even Joe Biden in the Obama administration.
 <br>[18:10:00]
 
So, I think there is a lot that people want to know about her. The difficulty she's going to have is, even as she says that she has the 
 
 policies to make everyone's life better, Trump is going to argue that things like high inflation you know, high gas prices, et cetera, et cetera, 
 
 she actually bears responsibility because she was part of the administration under which they occurred. That's going to be a very 
 
 difficult trick for her to turn. To be a member of an unpopular presidential administration, a senior member of that administration, and 
 
 yet, posing as the candidate of change.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes, and assuming he sticks to the script, of course.
 
COLLINSON:  Right.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Because he struggles to use the ammunition that does exist. We shall see. Stephen Collinson, thank you so much for that.
 
COLLINSON:  Thanks.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Now, to a big health update from the British royal family Catherine, Princess of Wales, has announced she's completed her 
 
 chemotherapy treatment and will begin returning to public life over the coming months. Catherine, who released this video with her family, says 
 
 she's doing what she can to protect her health and remain free from cancer.
 
Her diagnosis in February stunned the United Kingdom and the world, coming just weeks after King Charles announced his own cancer battle. According to 
 
 a royal source, King Charles and Queen Camilla say they're extending their love and support to the Princess of Wales and called it wonderful news. Max 
 
 Foster has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN ROYAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  After months of uncertainty, Catherine, the Princess of Wales, at last shared a feeling of 
 
 relief whilst announcing that she has completed her chemotherapy.
 
CATHERINE, PRINCESS OF WALES:  As the summer comes to an end, I cannot tell you what a relief it is to have finally completed my chemotherapy 
 
 treatment. The last nine months have been incredibly tough for us as a family. Life as you know it can change in an instant. And we've had to find 
 
 a way to navigate the stormy waters and road unknown.
 
FOSTER (voice-over):  In a heartfelt video released by Kensington Palace, Catherine said she was entering a new phase of recovery and will gradually 
 
 return to public duties over the coming months. But she noted that the road to full recovery is still a long one.
 
CATHERINE:  The cancer journey is complex, scary, and unpredictable for everyone, especially those closest to you. With humility, it also brings 
 
 you face to face with your own vulnerabilities in a way you've never considered before. And with that, a new perspective on everything. Doing 
 
 what I can to stay cancer free is now my focus.
 
FOSTER (voice-over):  In March, Catherine announced that she had an unspecified form of cancer and had started preventative chemotherapy.
 
CATHERINE:  And I'm now in the early stages of that treatment.
 
FOSTER (voice-over):  The news came after widespread speculation over her extended absence from public events. Since then, updates on the princess' 
 
 condition have been sparse. She's largely avoided the spotlight, making only two public appearances, joining her family on the balcony of 
 
 Buckingham Palace for the Trooping of Colour ceremony in June. And in the following month, accompanied by her daughter to the men's singles final at 
 
 Wimbledon, where she received a standing ovation.
 
Catherine expressed profound gratitude for the love and support that she felt whilst receiving treatment from both her family and the public.
 
CATHERINE:  This time, has above all, reminded William and me to reflect and be grateful for the simple yet important things in life, which so many 
 
 of us often take for granted, are simply loving and being loved.
 
FOSTER (voice-over):  As she moves forward with her recovery, Catherine has declared her desire to be a beacon of hope and light for those facing their 
 
 own battle with the disease.
 
Max Foster, CNN, London.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHATTERLEY:  Venezuelan opposition leader Edmundo Gonzalez, the man many consider to be the winner of July's disputed presidential election, has 
 
 fled the country. He's seeking asylum in Spain after being accused of terrorism and conspiracy, among other charges. Though the Venezuelan 
 
 attorney general now says he's dropping the case after Gonzalez's departure. The government still insists President Nicolas Maduro won the 
 
 election. However, Venezuela hasn't released complete poll data. The United States, E.U. and several Latin American nations have refused to recognize a 
 
 Maduro victory.
 
For more on this, we're joined by Stefano Pozzebon in Colombia. Stefano, good to have you with us. We asked you last week where he was and now, we 
 
 know, now he's in Spain. What does he hope to achieve from there?
 <br>[18:15:00]
 
STEFANO POZZEBON, JOURNALIST:  Yes, Julia. Well, we now know that when you and I talked last week, he was already hiding in the Dutch embassy in 
 
 Caracas and then moved to the Spanish embassy and then took this dramatic decision to leave the country and claim political asylum in Spain.
 
And he said -- Edmundo Gonzalez said this morning in a statement released to the media that he put -- he made this decision, putting his family and 
 
 the Venezuelan families first. But it's clear that these decision and the dramatic developments over the last 48 hours mark a clear distance from the 
 
 other opposition leader, Maria Corina Machado, who, remember, won the primary to be the opposition candidate, was barred from running, and then 
 
 selected Edmundo Gonzalez as her surrogate to compete against Maduro. Well, now the two leaders seem to be taking two very separate paths. Take a 
 
 listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MARIA CORINA MACHADO, VENEZUELAN OPPOSITION LEADER (voice-over):  If Edmundo leaving would make my situation more dangerous, I don't know. 
 
 Regardless, I've decided to remain in Venezuela and to continue my fight from within while he does so from abroad.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
POZZEBON:  Well, that was a statement from Maria Corina Machado earlier today, earlier on Monday, where she claimed that she will continue her 
 
 fight while Edmundo will continue the same fight, but abroad, perhaps rallying the support that Venezuelan opposition calls has received in the 
 
 last few weeks, and perhaps using more of his skills, given his previous life as an ambassador, as a diplomat, as a back -- some of their 
 
 backbencher who would negotiate the deals between different parties.
 
Now, leaders of the Venezuelan opposition who left Venezuela in the past have almost become unknown. They've lost all of their political capital. It 
 
 remains to be seen whether the strategy of having a double fight, one abroad and one led by Mario Corina Machado inside Venezuela could bring 
 
 some results, because after more than a month since that election, the government is yet to release the data that everybody has been calling for, 
 
 and Maduro is very much in charge and happy in his presidential palace in Caracas. Julia.
 
CHATTERLEY:  We'll continue to watch it closely. Stefano Pozzebon there in Colombia for us. Thank you.
 
Now, in Southeast Asia, Typhoon Yagi has left a path of destruction. At least 59 people have been killed in Vietnam after the storm made landfall 
 
 there over the weekend. Yagi is one of the world's most powerful storms so far this year. Some communities have begun to rebuild, but it's unclear 
 
 when or if life will return to normal. Kristie Lu Stout has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  After battering the Philippines and Southern China, Deadly Typhoon Yagi had lost none of its 
 
 fury when it hurtled into Vietnam over the weekend. In hard hit Haiphong, survivors felt the world had been destroyed.
 
BUI VAN THUY, HAI PHONG RESIDENT:  It may take three to four years for this place to look the same again because the damage is so terrible. The 
 
 surroundings look like apocalypse day. Never before has a storm dealt this much damage to us.
 
STOUT (voice-over):  Yagi was the equivalent of a Category 4 hurricane when it made landfall in northern Vietnam on Saturday afternoon. One of the 
 
 strongest storms to ever hit the country and one of the most powerful anywhere on earth this year.
 
Now, that the typhoon has passed, fallen power lines and flooded streets threaten the cleanup.
 
DANG VAN SANG, HANOI RESIDENT (through translator):  It's a powerful storm that uprooted many trees, blew off roofs. Many residents have been 
 
 impacted, causing damages and deaths.
 
STOUT (voice-over):  Yagi's trajectory gave Vietnam some time to prepare. Thousands were evacuated from the coastline as the country watched the 
 
 storm hit Hong Kong and sweep across China's holiday island of Hainan, killing at least four people.
 
As of Monday, tens of thousands of people remain in typhoon shelters in the Philippines almost a week after Yagi killed at least 20.
 
ELENITA CERVANTES, RIZAL PROVING RESIDENT (through translator):  Life is really hard, but there's nobody to blame since it was caused by calamity. 
 
 There's not much we can do but pray.
 
STOUT (voice-over):  Now, as Typhoon Yagi moves inland weakens, its trail of destruction remains across these parts of Southeast Asia.
 
Kristie Lu Stout, CNN, Hong Kong.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHATTERLEY:  And for more on this, we're joined by Chad Myers. Chad, an enormous cleanup operation taking place there. But as Kristie was saying 
 
 there, it's moving inland. What more's left to come in this?
 
CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  Well, we still have a small part of the circulation, but that's all the way out toward Myanmar. We're now seeing 
 
 more convection develop along the coast, where the people are trying to clean up here in Vietnam.
 <br>[18:20:00]
 
So, very heavy rainfall in those towns that were hit so hard. More day after day. Now, it's hard to tell what is monsoon and what might be left of 
 
 a tropical spin. But there's still going to be an awful lot of rainfall. In fact, over toward Myanmar, I have one little spot there, maybe just a 
 
 little bit offshore, that was somewhere in the 500-millimeter still to come range.
 
Something in the Gulf of Mexico for the U.S. to deal with over the next couple of days, new -- brand-new storm, Tropical Storm Francine. It is now 
 
 with a name 65 miles per hour, about a hundred kilometers per hour, if you're keeping score that way. But the storm will be in very warm water.
 
In fact, Fahrenheit, we're talking about somewhere in the lower 90s. There's the storm, there's the warm water. This is five degrees Fahrenheit 
 
 warmer than it should be this time of year, completely to blame for the rest of the world being so hot. And we know why.
 
There is tropical storm warnings. The red hurricane warnings were just posted at 5:00 local time, and they are for the state of Louisiana, 
 
 especially right along the coast, where the storm is likely to be a 100- mile per hour storm somewhere around 160 KPH. This is going to be a storm that could intensify even more than that because of the warm water. The 
 
 models are taking it very to the east there. Just very, very close to Houston, but into Louisiana proper. Houston, you've had enough problems 
 
 this year and last year as well.
 
But storm surge will be certainly with it somewhere in the neighborhood of five to 10 feet, two to three meters of salt water surge into those marshes 
 
 and bayou of Southern Louisiana.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Wow. Speaking as a British person and our water is always absolutely freezing, those water temperatures are just astonishing to me.
 
MYERS:  Yes.
 
CHATTERLEY:  OK. Chad Myers, thank you, as always. All right. Straight ahead. I spy Apple's generative A.I. The tech giant officially unveiling 
 
 the iPhone 16 with built-in artificial intelligence features. But can it live up to all the hype? We'll discuss.
 
Plus, the company apparently in the know for everything H2O. Tech Unicorn Gradient working with the world's largest firms to clean up wastewater, 
 
 extract and destroy so-called forever chemicals, and help preserve one of our most precious resources. We'll hear from the company's CEO next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:25:00]
 
CHATTERLEY:  Welcome back to "First Move." And Monday momentum on Wall Street topping today's Money Move. U.S. stocks bouncing back after last 
 
 week's losses. The worst week on Wall Street, in fact, so far this year. All the major averages rising well over 1 percent. Tech the driving force. 
 
 Boeing rallied more than 3 percent too on word that it's reached a contract deal with its machinists union, and that should take a threatened strike 
 
 for them later this week off the table.
 
But shares of Gucci parent company, Kering, fell to a seven-year low on new fears about slowing demand from China. And speaking of China's stocks there 
 
 fell too as new data fueled disinflation fears. Japan's GDP growth was revised lower too, perhaps complicating the central bank's push to raise 
 
 interest rates further.
 
And Apple's artificial intelligence future came further into focus on Monday with the unveiling of its new iPhone 16. The phone, which goes on 
 
 sale later this month, is built with a brand-new chip to help power Apple's new A.I. features, which were announced earlier this year. The features 
 
 include personalized emojis and images and ways to use A.I. to search for pictures and other information on your phone. It will also help proofread 
 
 documents and beef up Siri, among other things.
 
Apple's hoping that its new A.I. offering will help jumpstart an upgrade cycle and boost slowing iPhone sales, especially in China. But while Apple 
 
 confirmed that English versions of Apple Intelligence will launch next month, Apple Intelligence in other languages won't be available until next 
 
 year.
 
Scott Stein is editor-at-large at CNET. And he joins us now. Scott, fantastic to have you with us. I sort of was watching this and I was a 
 
 little deflated. I don't get the sense that either A.I. capabilities are good to go as soon as you buy this phone. It just feels like it's going to 
 
 take some time and I'm not sure this would encourage me necessarily to get an upgrade. How do you feel?
 
SCOTT STEIN, EDITOR-AT-LARGE, CNET:  I felt the same way in that, you know, a lot of it feels very similar. Of course, better camera tech, slightly 
 
 larger screen on the nicer models, promises of some better battery life, which does matter to some people, but very similar proposition, but Apple's 
 
 doubling down a little more on some of the camera features with that dedicated camera button. And they're promising a lot with generative A.I., 
 
 even though, like you said, that's coming later this year, and it's not even available globally. It'll be in sort of a beta status in the U.S.
 
CHATTERLEY:  So, my biggest issue with my phone in general, we won't talk about the type, is battery. I just want the battery to last longer and that 
 
 will keep me happy. I know you did a recent survey where you were speaking to iPhone owners just to understand what they actually want and A.I. ranked 
 
 pretty low actually in terms of features demanded.
 
STEIN:  Yes, it did. And a number of our readers were skeptical about A.I. with good reason, and we're not sure about subscription features. Apple 
 
 didn't talk about any subscription A.I. features, but battery, you know, at about 60 percent top the list. Apple does promise more battery life on the 
 
 pro phones. You're also going to have to pay up for those. It's kind of similar to what they did with the Apple Watch Ultra last year, where they 
 
 finally gave more battery life to the Apple Watch, but at a premium. So, that's pretty frustrating to me, because that's -- that is one of the main 
 
 things I look for.
 
I'm curious about the camera button, but that really feels like something you'd have to test out and use, and it's kind of -- feels to me like a 
 
 doorway to visual A.I. on your phone. And I feel like that's something that maybe in the future could come to glasses.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Now, that makes sense. When I read that with the camera on the side of the phone and then the sliding zoom, I was like, that's the license 
 
 to drop the phone while you're in progress. But yes, we'll wait and see on that. Your point about visual intelligence though, I think it's very 
 
 interesting. Perhaps it's taking a snapshot of something, a camera or an image of something and it giving you information about it, for example, the 
 
 breed of a dog, I think it's a great example.
 
Can we talk about wellness and health though? Because there were two things that caught my attention. One, the watch, the latest watch will have sleep 
 
 apnea detection and then the ear pods, which will function as a hearing aid. That's interesting.
 
STEIN:  Yes, both of them are really interesting. Apple has been making pushes in health tech for years. These were two of the biggest 
 
 announcements at the event. But what's interesting is that these are announcements for products that already exist. The sleep apnea feature is 
 
 also going to be available for last year's Apple Watch models. The hearing aid feature is for the existing AirPods Pro II. Maybe that's because Apple 
 
 had to test these over a period of time to make sure they would be ready for FDA clearance.
 
But, you know, the watch one for apnea, Samsung's done that too recently, and it's something that I'm looking for blood pressure eventually to make 
 
 it onto watches. Apnea is useful. I have sleep apnea, I have a CPAP. You know, a lot of people don't get that diagnosed but you have to sleep with 
 
 the watch, and the battery life on the Apple Watch is not any better really, and I wonder how many people are going to wear it to bed, something 
 
 that I don't necessarily do.
 <br>[18:30:00]
 
The hearing aid is very fascinating because, you know, they're really going to put this to market as an over the counter, you know, FDA cleared, when 
 
 it passes clearance, hearing aid device with a hearing test. And I'm actually terrified to know what mine would be. But -- you know, and then 
 
 you'd possibly have either a pair of these air pods lying around or buy them in lieu of another hearing aid.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes, and I think the point about wearing the watch at night is important, too. But I like the fact that they're talking about that 
 
 charging, at least in most part, in 30 minutes now in some of these newer ones. So, at least you can perhaps charge it before bed and then still wear 
 
 it. Scott, great to get your insights on that. Scott Stein there, editor- at-large at CNET. Great to chat to you, sir.

CHATTERLEY:  After two and a half years of war with Russia, Ukraine's grinding fight is increasingly plagued by low morale and desertions. Well, 
 
 now, the country is turning to a new kind of freedom fighter, convicts. Fred Pleitgen reports on the soldiers who went from behind bars to the 
 
 battlefield.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over):  Ukrainian troops sweeping into a village on the eastern front, but these 
 
 aren't career soldiers, they're ex-convicts who volunteered from prison, got some basic training, and were thrust into battle. Vitali, 41 years old, 
 
 10 years in jail for theft and violent assault now assaulting Vladimir Putin's army.
 
VITALI, EX-CONVICT, SHKVAL COMPANY, 59TH BRIGADE (through translator):  We have a goal. We have a task and we must do it. We're never confused, always 
 
 focused. You need to be very quick there.
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over):  The ex-convicts are part of Ukraine's 59th Brigade. They're camped near the frontline rudimentary, but a lot better than jail. 
 
 Our conversations remain basic about survival or death.
 <br>[18:35:00]
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  He who has a strong spirit wins. He how has a weak spirit dies.
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over):  Many are dying here on both sides. The 59th Brigade gave us this video showing Russians fleeing a burning house as the ex-
 
 convicts attack. But Vitali admits they are suffering casualties as well.
 
VITALI (through translator):  We were moving into a position and my buddy was blown apart as soon as we went to the field. He was dismantled. It's 
 
 hard to watch, but what can you do? You can't help.
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over):  Their deal is simple, fight, survive, and become free men.
 
VITALI (through translator):  I need to turn the page of my life. I have five children after all. I need to think about my kid a little bit and 
 
 about myself. My life was a mess.
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over):  Company Commander Oleksandr says his men performed some of the most dangerous assaults around here. Oleksandr was a jail 
 
 warden and many of those here, his inmates. He recruited them and says the traits that put them in jail now keep them alive.
 
OLEKSANDR (through translator):  The convict subculture is used to surviving. They survive in very harsh conditions. And they will make every 
 
 effort to survive.
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over):  This unit is part of Ukraine's force defending the key logistic hub, Pokrovsk.
 
PLEITGEN:  Pokrovsk is now one of the main front line towns in the war in Ukraine. As you can see, the streets here are virtually deserted. At the 
 
 same time, the Russians are hitting this place with really heavy munitions, everything from artillery shells to large rockets.
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over):  After major advances, the Russians are knocking on the door here. Shells and rockets constantly impacting, especially in the 
 
 evenings. And that's when the medics from the 68th Mountaineer Brigade start receiving most of the heavy casualties.
 
They show us this video of a U.S. supplied MaxxPro armored vehicle hit by a Russian drone. Two killed, four severely injured. Casualties Ukraine's 
 
 military, already badly outmanned, cannot afford, the medic who goes by the callsign Barbarian tells me.
 
BARBARIAN, MEDIC, 68TH BRIGADE (through translator):  There are fewer of us. One of us matches 20 Russians. But we lack training. The training 
 
 period is very short. We lack equipment. They took the initiative in the sky. I mean drone.
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over):  And Russian drones are also lethal at night. So, we leave Pokrovsk as darkness falls, Ukrainian troops heading towards the 
 
 front, hoping to keep Putin's army away from this key city.
 
Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Pokrovsk, Ukraine.

CHATTERLEY:  Welcome back to "First Move." Abu Dhabi's new airport is using an ambitious A.I. strategy to make traveling faster, easier and safer. 
 
 Veronica Miracle got a look at the massive security apparatus that makes it all possible.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
VERONICA MIRACLE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Artificial intelligence is transforming every aspect of our lives, often in ways we don't even 
 
 realize. Like here at the new Zayed International Airport in Abu Dhabi. A.I. is making my journey faster, easier, and safer.
 
ANDREW MURPHY, CIO, ABU DHABI AIRPORTS:  This is a great process to watch. And if you have a passenger, I know everything's ready for them to go, they 
 
 just go straight through in sort of 10 or 12 seconds.
 
MIRACLE (voice-over):  Andrew Murphy moved here in 2022 to help launch this $3 billion facility. With two decades in the aviation industry and a track 
 
 record of helping lead eight airports across four countries, he's been tasked with building an airport that meets the demands of the future. 
 
 Boasting state of the art biometric stations using facial recognition.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Please look towards the camera.
 
MIRACLE (voice-over):  The technology here even made it to the silver screen in Tom Cruise's latest "Mission Impossible" movie.
 
TOM CRUISE, ACTOR, "MISSION IMPOSSIBLE":  Reggie, get me on that flight to Venice.
 
SIMON PEGG, ACTOR, "MISSION IMPOSSIBLE":  Yes, Flight 1031 to Venice. Standby.
 
MIRACLE (voice-over):  While the movie may be fiction, Murphy says the technology here is very real.
 
MIRACLE:  This is remarkable. I've never been on the interior of an airport, only passing through. So, it's incredible to see. Can you explain 
 
 what we're looking at?
 
MURPHY:  Absolutely. Well, this is the airport management center, and this is the nerve center of the operation.
 
MIRACLE (voice-over):  Murphy is helping lead an ambitious A.I. strategy, which aims to enhance efficiency and safety across all operations. The team 
 
 is developing what they call ITAM, an Artificial Intelligent Airport Management System.
 
MURPHY:  We have some 90,000 passengers going over 400 flights every single day. When you think about the number of processes that sit behind it and 
 
 the opportunity for A.I. to really optimize that, you know, the opportunity is endless.

CHATTERLEY:  Welcome back to "First Move." With a look at more of the international headlines this hour. A new congressional report blames the 
 
 Biden administration for the chaotic exit from Afghanistan. It was put out by the Republican led House Foreign Affairs Committee and it accuses Joe 
 
 Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris of focusing on political optics rather than security. It comes as Donald Trump's campaign looks to make 
 
 Harris' role in that exit a key campaign issue.
 
Pope Francis has arrived in East Timor marking the penultimate stop on his Asia Pacific tour. The small Southeast Asian nation is a Catholic 
 
 stronghold. The pope is set to address recent allegations of abuse within the East Timor clergy and celebrate to open-air mass with nearly half the 
 
 nation's population.
 
Vatican correspondent Christopher Lamb has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHRISTOPHER LAMB, CNN VATICAN CORRESPONDENT:  Huge crowds turned out to greet Pope Francis on Monday as he arrived in East Timor for the third leg 
 
 of his Southeast Asia and Pacific tour. CNN is traveling with Francis and we saw crowds, sometimes 10 rows deep, who turned out to greet the pope as 
 
 he traveled through the capital of East Timor, Dili, on the Popemobile.
 
Now, East Timor is the second most Catholic nation after the Vatican City State. 97 percent of people identify as Catholics and the church plays a 
 
 huge role in the country. It played a critical role in its struggle for independence.
 
Nevertheless, the scourge of clerical sexual abuse hangs over this trip. Bishop Carlos Belo, a leading figure in the church, a Nobel Peace Prize 
 
 winner, was accused of sexually abusing minors and was sanctioned by the Vatican. Now, Pope Francis, when he met with leaders of East Timor, here in 
 
 Dili, addressed abuse, saying that the leaders must do everything they can to prevent it happening.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
POPE FRANCIS (through translator):  We shall not forget those children and adolescents that have their dignity violated. This phenomenon is happening 
 
 across the world. In response, we are all called to do everything possible to prevent every kind of abuse and guarantee a peaceful growth for all 
 
 young people.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
LAMB:  On Tuesday, Francis will celebrate an open-air mass here in the capital of East Timor. It's estimated that more than 700,000 people will 
 
 attend this event. That's more than half the population of the entire country.
 
This visit by Pope Francis to East Timor, a huge moment in the life of this young nation.
 
Christopher Lamb, CNN, Dili, East Timor.

CHATTERLEY:  Now, an international manhunt is underway after a baby in Australia suffered burns after a man threw scolding coffee on him. 
 
 Queensland police have released video of a suspect identified as a 33-year- old foreign national who fled the country four days after the attack. The nine-month-old victim, known only as Luca, suffered serious burns to his 
 
 face, arm, and legs.
 
Now, meanwhile, California's governor, Gavin Newsom, has stepped in to help a community near L.A. with another problem. Landslides are ripping homes 
 
 apart, buckling roads, and leaving hundreds without power. Officials say the area has experienced slow land movements now for decades. Stephanie 
 
 Elam has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
STEPHANIE ELAM, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  It's as if the earth is wiping away what's been built upon it.
 
TIM STEWART, RESIDENT:  I'm no geologist, but when you see the road turning into a roller coaster, you know something's wrong.
 
ELAM (voice-over):  Here in Rancho Palos Verdes, an affluent community coveted for its expansive Pacific Ocean vistas, the land is sliding 
 
 dangerously.
 
BARBARA FERRARO, RANCHO PALOS VERDES CITY COUNCIL:  This is unprecedented. No one knows really in a way what to do.
 
ELAM (voice-over):  While the land has always slowly shifted here, local leaders say it's accelerated tremendously.
 
GREG MONTGOMERY, RESIDENT:  Unbelievable, in the last four months, it's constant. I mean, it's just -- what do you do? We're sitting here on a keg 
 
 of dynamite and we can't go repair anything because the ground continues to move.
 
ELAM (voice-over):  So, much so, some residents had their natural gas service discontinued in July, with more shutoffs recently added. Then, in 
 
 the last week, more than 200 homes had their power cut indefinitely as the shifting ground threatens utility lines.
 
LARRY CHUNG, SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON:  On August 29th, the fire that occurred near Narcissa Drive, the land movement caused a power line to fall 
 
 to the ground and ignite a small fire.
 
ELAM (voice-over):  That fire was quickly extinguished, officials say, but the incident exposed the threat posed to basic infrastructure, including 
 
 water and sewer lines.
 
MICHAEL CHEE, PIO FOR LA COUNTY SANITATION DISTRICTS:  We are dealing with incomprehensible amounts of earth with unimaginable movement, pulling our 
 
 infrastructure in ways that it is not designed or intended to move or resist this level of dynamic activity.
 <br>[18:50:00]
 
ELAM (voice-over):  Allowing officials to funnel resources toward the emergency response, Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in 
 
 the city this week, noting the land movement accelerated significantly following the 2023 and '24 severe storm events, with the land now sliding 
 
 at an average of nine to 12 inches per week.
 
JANICE HAHN, LOS ANGELES COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:  I think we're all learning that there is no playbook for an emergency like this one. We don't 
 
 have a step-by-step guide to follow. But what we do know is that many families are struggling, are suffering, are feeling great anxiety about 
 
 what is happening. They are watching their homes. They're watching their streets crumble around them.
 
ELAM (voice-over):  And for some residents, the only option is to remain in their damaged homes.
 
CRAIG CADWALLADER, RESIDENT:  Everybody must assume that people who live in Rancho Palos Verdes are infinitely wealthy. That's not the case, especially 
 
 for me. And so, I literally don't know where I'm going.
 
MONTGOMERY:  We've lost our ability to live normal lives. I mean, we have plans to go places, and we can't go. We have to stay here.
 
ELAM:  For some of the residents in these neighborhoods, it's not just their homes that are being impacted, but also their livelihoods as well, 
 
 which is making the situation even more dire for them. Back to you.

CHATTERLEY:  Now, making a "First Move" for his nation at the U.S. Open men's final, world number one Jannik Sinner has become the first Italian 
 
 man to win the singles title after beating U.S. star Taylor Fritz. It's now Sinner's second Grand Slam title. The 23-year-old won the Australian Open 
 
 back in January.
 
Don Riddell has more on what was an incredibly busy weekend for tennis fans. So, close yet so far for the Americans, I think, in this tournament, 
 
 but Sinner deserved it in the end.
 
DON RIDDELL, CNN WORLD SPORT:  Yes. I mean, it was a big deal for the American players and the American fans because there was an American player 
 
 in the women's and the men's final, but they came up short on both occasions.
 
But you're absolutely right, Julia. Sinner was terrific in the final. He was terrific throughout the tournament. Frankly, he's been brilliant this 
 
 season. This has been his breakout year. He is the new world number one, and he was just absolutely fantastic. And this does now confirm what we 
 
 think is a brand-new era in men's tennis, because, get this, for the first time now in 21 years, none of the big three, which is Federer, Nadal, and 
 
 Djokovic, won any of the majors. And for many of those 21 years, those guys just swept them all.
 
But this year, we had Jannik Sinner winning the two hardcourt majors. We had Carlos Alcaraz winning the other two. And so, these are now the bright 
 
 new megastars in men's tennis. And we asked Sinner about that afterwards. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JANNIK SINNER, 2024 U.S. OPEN MEN'S CHAMPION:  I think it's nice for tennis to see some new champions, some new favorites of tournaments. And yes, so 
 
 I'm happy to be part of this, at least this year. So, let's see what's coming next year. Obviously, it's -- they're all big, big challenges coming 
 
 up, but, you know, I'm just looking forward to improve as a player and then, we'll see what I can do.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
RIDDELL:  Yes. He's had a fantastic year. Jannik Sinner there, Julia.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Yes. Timing, as they say, is everything, and it is an age thing with the previous superstars. Can we talk about the women as well? 
 
 Because I love that picture of Sabalenka when she was literally hugging that trophy.
 
RIDDELL:  Yes, yes, yes. I mean, so, this one was so important to her for so many reasons. She's also had a brilliant year. And Sabalenka's fans, 
 
 will remember what happened to her in the U.S. Open final 12 months previously, where she ran into another American. She was once set up 
 
 against Coco Gauff and ended up losing that match. So, I think it really was the scene of her biggest disappointment and for her to come back to the 
 
 U.S. Open final and this time win it, convincingly explains the joy that you are seeing on the face of Aryna Sabalenka right now.
 
And I don't think there's any question anymore who is the best player on the hardcourt surfaces, it is the player that you are looking at on your 
 
 screen. When you look at the last four major tournaments played on the hardcourt, which is Australian Open and U.S. Open, he's been in all four 
 
 finals and she's won three of them. And of course, the next major is going to be the Australian Open again, started next year in Melbourne.
 
I can't see that anybody else is going to be the favorite for that tournament. Sabalenka is going to be trying to make it three in a row.
 
CHATTERLEY:  I'm just watching the video, Don. That is a killer dress. So, she's posing off a storm. Good for her. Don, great to chat to you.
 
RIDDELL:  All right.
 
CHATTERLEY:  Thank you. Don Riddell there.
 <br>[18:55:00]
 
CHATTERLEY:  And finally, on "First Move," he's the ghost with the most and the box office receipts to prove it.

CHATTERLEY:  Winona Ryder and Michael Keaton, they're reprising their iconic roles in the long-awaited sequel to Tim Burton's 1988 classic, 
 
 "Beetlejuice." " Beetlejuice Beetlejuice," as it's known, has just raked in a spine tingling $110 million in U.S. ticket sales over its opening 
 
 weekend. It's the second highest opening weekend ever. But a September movie in the United States topped only by the equally spooky, "It." 
 
 "Beetlejuice Beetlejuice" is distributed by Warner Brothers, which is part of CNN's parent company, Warner Brothers Discovery.
