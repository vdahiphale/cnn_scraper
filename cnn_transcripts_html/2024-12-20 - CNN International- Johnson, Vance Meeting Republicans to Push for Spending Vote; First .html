(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ERICA HILL, CNN HOST, CONNECT THE WORLD: Live picture there of Washington - - as the clock ticking in the Nation's Capital after a second failed attempt by the U.S. House to keep the government open. It is 09:00 a.m. on 
 
 the East Coast. I'm Erica Hill, joining you from New York in for Becky Anderson, today. This is "Connect the World".
 
Ahead this hour, the U.N. says 100,000 Syrians have returned home since the Assad Regime collapsed as U.S. delegation arrives in Damascus. New federal 
 
 charges for the suspect in the murder of the Healthcare CEO and Apple really feeling the heat after its new AI news feature, back fired, 
 
 generating false information. 
 
The stock market here in New York set to open in just about 30 minutes. And so far, if we take a look at the futures, whole lot of red there on a 
 
 Friday morning, maybe not all that promising. They've been hit, of course, perhaps, by fears of this looming government shutdown. So, there you have a 
 
 future that's a sea of red. We'll see how that goes throughout the trading day.
 
Meantime, at this hour in Washington, crucial meetings underway, yet another government shutdown looming. U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson and 
 
 Vice President-Elect J. D. Vance meeting with Republican lawmakers. Johnson says he does expect a vote on the House floor for what would at this point 
 
 be a Plan C bill to keep the government running after midnight tonight. This third attempt comes after the House, of course, rejected that Plan B 
 
 bill just last night.
 
That reaction there after Republican Congressman Mark Molinaro, who you saw smashing the gavel, appearing to break the gavel as he tried to bring order 
 
 to the chamber, after a fierce debate. That failed Plan B bill, of course, came to the floor Thursday night after President-Elect Donald Trump and 
 
 Elon Musk had worked in tandem to tank a bipartisan bill that would have funded the government into next March. Their moves sparking outrage and 
 
 also a new nickname for Musk from Democrats.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY): The Musk Johnson proposal is not serious.
 
REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD): Everybody agreed, and then it was blown up by Elon Musk, who apparently has become the fourth branch of government.
 
REP. ROSA DELAURO (D-CT): President Musk said, don't do it. Don't do it. Shut the government down.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HILL: Donald Trump also calling to shut the government down this morning, and that focus on Elon Musk continuing with Democrats just this morning. 
 
 Take a listen to New York Representative Gregory Meeks earlier on CNN.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. GREGORY MEEKS (D-NY): I think that the Republicans have to get their act together. It seems as though the Republican members of the House have 
 
 conceded their responsibilities to the co-presidents Trump and Musk, and we don't have a separate legislative branch. There was an agreement that was 
 
 made, and that's what the American people wanted. 
 
They wanted Democrats and Republicans to sit down and work this thing out. We did just that. We hammered it out for a long period of time and came up 
 
 to an agreement, only to have at the last moment, co-president Musk start tweeting, then follow thereafter the president-elect, I guess he is 
 
 following Musk now saying that killed the deal.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HILL: Last hour on CNN, Fredricka Whitfield spoke with Annie Grayer about just this last-ditch effort from the House Speaker for another funding 
 
 bill, the effort to get that onto the House floor.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANNIE GRAYER, CNN REPORTER: Vance is kind of acting as the conduit between the Trump transition team and lawmakers on Capitol Hill. And Speaker Mike 
 
 Johnson told us this morning that they have a new plan. He's expecting there to be votes later today. We have not gotten official notice of that.
 
But the meeting that's happening ongoing is really an opportunity for Republicans to try and get on the same page, because, as we saw last night, 
 
 they are not unified by a plan that was endorsed by Trump and crafted largely by the Speaker, so they're going to try again today. 
 
But what was also clear yesterday is they did not have Democratic support to lean on, so whatever they pass, at least at this point, from what offers 
 
 are on the table, they're going to have to do it just among Republicans. We'll see if they make any changes to try and bring more Democrats on 
 
 board. But it's going to be a lot of chasing lawmakers trying to get answers today, because there's really just so much concern and a lot up in 
 
 the air.
 
FREDRICKA WHITFIELD, CNN HOST: And then talk to us about the whole Elon Musk factor. I mean, he will -- well, now he's already acting as an 
 
 advisor, but that will be his official -- you know role once Trump is inaugurated. But already he seems to have a lot of influence on the entire 
 
 party, not just on Donald Trump.
 <br>[09:05:00]
 
GRAYER: His influence cannot be overstated. I mean, he started posting on social media and calling on his millions of followers to call lawmakers 
 
 directly and pressure them not to support the original deal. But there was already grumblings that Republicans were very upset with the package 
 
 because they felt very left out of the process. They felt surprised by a lot of the things that were included in there. 
 
So, Musk really just took ramp up that pressure to another level and made it untenable. And you know, we're already seeing he's come to Capitol Hill 
 
 once already to talk about his new effort about cutting government spending across the board, so we're seeing him play a larger and larger role, and 
 
 this is just the latest example.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HILL: Joining me now, Catherine Rampell, CNN Economics and Political Commentator, and, of course Opinion Columnist at "The Washington Post". So, 
 
 Catherine, when we look at all of this, we have these very distinct messaging camps as well that we're seeing yesterday the Democrats labelling 
 
 Elon Musk. 
 
But what we're hearing very clearly from Republicans, so from Senator J.D. Vance, the Vice President-Elect, saying very clearly, it's Democrats who 
 
 voted to shut down the government. Donald Trump just posting a short time ago on social media on his Truth Social he wants the government to shut 
 
 down. 
 
He was very clear under Biden, saying this would be a Biden problem. It's on him. This is on him to solve. There's all this back and forth, and yet, 
 
 here we are, and there's still no bill that it seems like is going to pass.
 
CATHERINE RAMPELL, WASHINGTON POST OPINION COLUMNIST: There was a deal. There was a bipartisan deal that, in fact, Republican Speaker of the House, 
 
 Mike Johnson, negotiated with -- you know support from Democrats to keep the lights on and to -- you know basically have a stop gap standing bill to 
 
 prevent this pre-Christmas, unforced crisis.
 
And Elon Musk inserted himself and decided to blow it up without really having an objective for why he was blowing it up as far as I can tell. I 
 
 think that's part of the frustration here. It seems like there was just this grenade thrown in at the 11th hour with -- you know demanding some 
 
 sort of concession, but it wasn't really clear what the concession was, which feels very part of the deal to me, in a way.
 
This is like a traditional Donald Trump trick that once you have a settled deal at the 11th hour --you know blow it up in service of usually having 
 
 some sort of valuable concession that your counter party might not otherwise be willing to make. 
 
But in this case, they don't really know what the concession is. If it's, in fact, raising the debt limit. Republicans don't want to do that, so it's 
 
 not clear what the strategy was here. And I'm loads to say that -- you know -- oh, who's to be -- who's to judge, like, maybe it's the Democrats, maybe 
 
 it's the Republicans. No, there was a deal and Elon Musk blew it up.
 
HILL: Yeah.
 
RAMPELL: I think it's very clear, very clear, who's to blame in this particular scenario.
 
HILL: In terms of what the concessions to be. What I mean, it's also important to point out there were 30 -- to your point about many 
 
 Republicans not wanting to raise the debt ceiling. 38 voted against this Plan B bill that came to the floor last night. When you look at what is 
 
 happening, though, especially looking at what is happening in Washington, and what we heard from Donald Trump this morning in that post, is the goal 
 
 here just to sow chaos in the waning days of the Biden Administration?
 
RAMPELL: It may be, but I don't really know what purpose that serves. Because if, in fact, there is a shutdown today, and it isn't resolved until 
 
 after Trump comes into office, which Elon Musk himself has suggested would be an ideal scenario, that no legislation should pass until Trump is 
 
 actually sworn in. That's going to hurt the Trump Presidency too, right? 
 
We've seen before that the government shutdowns are costly for taxpayers. They're costly for the U.S. economy. When there was a five-week partial 
 
 shutdown in 2018, 2019, sort of straddling the end of the year there, the Congressional Budget Office found that it cost the U.S. economy about $3 
 
 billion permanently, even after everything had reopened.
 
Not to mention the fact that we have an inauguration coming up, and its untested waters about what -- you know what portion of that pageantry can 
 
 still continue during a government shutdown. A government enduring a government shutdown, some portion of government services that are deemed 
 
 essential are required to still continue, often meaning that, like people at TSA, for example, have to show up for work. 
 
They're not being paid in real time. They have to hope that they'll get paid afterward. Historically, they can. But this is unprecedented. 
 <br>[09:10:00]
 
What happens during -- during this -- you know traditional, peaceful transfer of power that is the presidential inauguration?
 
HILL: Yeah.
 
RAMPELL: What portion of it is allowed to continue? And presumably that matters a lot to Trump too. So, I just -- I think that they're sort of 
 
 retro, actively trying to justify the chaos that they are sewing, but it's hard to see how it serves anyone.
 
HILL: Yeah, it's true. It is hard to see how it does. And yet, here we are again wondering what the heck is going to happen and whether anything will 
 
 get done before midnight? We will see. Catherine, good to see as always thanks. 
 
RAMPELL: Thank you. 
 
HILL: A U.S. delegation is in Syria meeting with its interim leaders for the first time since the fall of the Assad Regime. Those talks just getting 
 
 underway in Damascus, a top to State Department Official Barbara Leaf speaking with Ahmed Al Sharaa, the HTS Leader, who, of course, was most 
 
 recently known as Abu Mohammad Al Jolani. 
 
We are also learning from the Defense Department it turns out the U.S. has around 2000 troops in Syria right now. That is more than double what was 
 
 previously disclosed. My colleague, Fredricka Whitfield, spoke with Alex Marquardt in Washington about these developments in just last hour.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The U.S. cut off diplomatic ties with the Assad Regime back in 2012 and now we 
 
 are in this incredible transitional moment in Syria. And so, you have these top U.S. officials who have traveled to Damascus to meet with this, this 
 
 umbrella militant group that overthrew Bashar Al Assad some two weeks ago, Hayat Tahrir Al Sham. 
 
We believe that this group of American diplomats has met with its leader, Ahmed Al Sharaa, the group and its leader are considered terrorists by the 
 
 United States. Sharaa has a ten million bounty on his head. So, this is really quite remarkable, and we believe that they will have spoken about 
 
 the future of Syria. 
 
The U.S.'s desire to see an inclusive government, a representative government, one that does not allow terrorists to be harbored inside Syria. 
 
 Of course, HTS and Sharaa will be pushing for sanctions to be lifted on Syria, for them to -- for them to be redesignated, for those terrorist 
 
 designations to be lifted.
 
And then Fred certainly, a central focus of that conversation will be the location of Austin Tice, the Journalist who was detained and disappeared 
 
 some 12 years ago. And in addition, Talif, who is expected to speak any moment now, you have Roger Carstens who is the top U.S. Official on Hostage 
 
 Affairs, who is also there.
 
And then, notably, the U.S. has also named a new senior adviser for Syria for this moment Daniel Rubenstein of Former Ambassador, Former Special 
 
 Envoy to Syria under President Obama. He's going to be leading the State Department's efforts to engage with this nascent transitional Syrian 
 
 government for the remaining weeks of the Biden Administration, Fred.
 
WHITFIELD: OK. And then you mentioned, you know, Austin Tice, what kind of energy you know, is going to be put into searching for any clues, any 
 
 people that may have had contact with him as it pertains to this U.S. delegation?
 
MARQUARDT: Well, the U.S. has been frantically looking for Tice for years, but especially since the Assad Regime fell, following any tips, any leads 
 
 that they came across Carstens who I just mentioned, he's been perched on the borders of Syria in both Lebanon and Jordan according efforts inside 
 
 Syria.
 
We know the U.S. government has been in direct contact with that group, HTS for -- to try to look out for Austin, as all of these prisons have been 
 
 opened up. The Tice family understandably desperate for any news about their son. Some two weeks ago, they said they believed that he was still 
 
 alive, that he had been treated well. 
 
We know that Debra Tice's mother had sent a letter to President Vladimir Putin of Russia, because President Assad of Syria is now in Russia, and he 
 
 told reporters yesterday that he would speak to Assad about Tice try to learn what he could. And we did hear in that letter, Debra Tice saying that 
 
 she was ready to go to Moscow or to anywhere to wrap her arms around our precious Austin and bring him safely home a truly desperate family looking 
 
 for their son, Fredricka.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HILL: I want to bring you now Syrian Columnist, Haid Haid, who is a Consulting Fellow at Chatham House in London. You also have family, as I 
 
 know, living in Aleppo. It's good to have you here today. As we look at where things stand in Syria this morning, the fact that this U.S. 
 
 delegation is in Damascus, the first time in more than a decade. 
 
And we're also learning from officials, they say they want to engage directly with the Syrian people. What do you expect to come of these 
 
 meetings? And just put in perspective for the importance of this happening after more than a decade.
 
HAID HAID, CONSULTING FELLOW, CHATHAM HOUSE: First of all, thank you for having me. I think it's this is important for different factors. 
 <br>[09:15:00]
 
One of them is that, as you mentioned, has been over a decade that there has not been a direct contact with the sort of authorities in Damascus. 
 
 Second, now that -- this issue could potentially, or this engagement could potentially shed some light on how to engage with Hayat Tahrir Al Sham and 
 
 its leader Jolani as they are sanctioned as or designated as terrorist groups and leader.
 
And then the third one is related to, I think, making sure that there is clear sort of understanding for what should come next and regarding what 
 
 might come out of it. At this stage, I think it's difficult to really expect any concrete sort of agreement or results that the statement or the 
 
 discussion most likely will focus on just ensuring that -- on that the transition in Syria will be inclusive, and highlighting some of the key 
 
 issues related to fighting ISIS and dealing with key fires, like the chemical weapons fire.
 
HILL: There is all that. There's also this, you know, refrain, I think that we've heard from a number of world leaders over concerns about HTS right? 
 
 And being in charge, and the importance of this being an inclusive government, and certainly moving forward a democratic effort, and that they 
 
 essentially walk the walk, not just talk the talk in terms of promises. Where do you see the best pressure campaign coming from to make that 
 
 happen?
 
HAID: I think it will be -- the best one will be if you have a unified, not only messaging, but also coordinated efforts to make sure that all the 
 
 discussions are happening jointly. And in direct coordination among each other, vis-a-vis the group and its leader.
 
Right now, if you look at the different sort of delegations that visited Damascus over the past week or so, you will see that each country is going 
 
 there, sending some diplomas to go and talk to the group individually. I think, while engaging with the group and its leader is useful at this 
 
 stage, and will be important making sure that there is a unified position.
 
And that message and that position is directly communicated with the group is essential. Because there is one sort of side of things that is related 
 
 to the narrative and positive messages that the group is sending. However, when it comes to the implementation of those sort of promises. It's the 
 
 situation is slightly different. 
 
When you look at the current transitional body that is appointed by the group, it's mostly, if not all. All of it is basically managed by 
 
 individuals either who are part of the group or directly linked to the group, which makes, gives the group an extensive sort of control and 
 
 influence over what's happening right now in Syria.
 
And unfortunately, when we see all the delegations going there and acting as if now, they're talking to the de facto leader of Syria, that does not 
 
 help pushing forward a process that will lead to an inclusive and democratic sort of change.
 
HILL: Yeah, it's an important point. Haid Haid I really appreciate joining us this morning. Thank you. Still ahead here, the man accused of killing a 
 
 Healthcare CEO in New York City back here now to face a slew of new charges, including new federal charges. We have those developments for you. 
 
 Plus, what we're learning about the California man? This man who police say was plotting a mass shooting with the teen suspect in a school shooting 
 
 that happened in Wisconsin earlier this week.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:20:00]
 
HILL: New details are emerging in the case against Luigi Mangione, the man who officials say gun down United Healthcare's CEO, Brian Thompson on a 
 
 Manhattan side walk earlier this month. The charges come as, sorry, this comes as Mangione is facing a slew of new federal charges, including murder 
 
 through the use of a firearm. CNN's Kara Scannell has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KARA SCANNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Accused killer Luigi Mangione back in New York and behind bars. New video showing him handcuffed 
 
 and in an orange jump suit, stepping off a helicopter and being escorted toward a transport van by scores of armed officers.
 
Mangione is now also facing federal charges in the fatal shooting of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson outside a Manhattan Hotel.
 
SCANNELL: Karen, do you have any comment on these charges today?
 
KAREN FRIEDMAN AGNIFILO, LUIGI MANGIONE'S LAWYER: Not at this time. Thank you so much.
 
SCANNELL (voice-over): Mangione's high profile defense team not saying much about the new charges before and after their client's first appearance in 
 
 federal court. Inside, Mangione traded the jumpsuit for street clothes as he entered the courtroom flanked by marshals with his ankles shackled.
 
His federal charges are a firearms offense, two stalking charges and murder through the use of a firearm, which carries a potential maximum sentence of 
 
 the death penalty or life in prison. Mangione did not enter a plea, and his defense team did not seek bail. The new federal criminal complaint also 
 
 revealing new details about the notebook found on Mangione during his arrest at an Altoona, Pennsylvania McDonald's.
 
According to the complaint, the notebook contains several hand written pages that expressed hostility toward the health insurance industry. And 
 
 one entry dated October 22, 2024 less than two months before the murder of Thompson, describes an intent to, quote, whack one of the CEOs at an 
 
 insurance industry conference. The federal charges are added to the long list of state charges he's already facing.
 
ALVIN BRAGG, NEW YORK DISTRICT ATTORNEY: We charged him here in Manhattan earlier this week with murder in the first degree, among additional 
 
 charges, which carry the maximum sentence of life without parole. We've had state prosecutions and federal prosecutions proceed as parallel matters, 
 
 and we're in conversations with our law enforcement counter parts.
 
SCANNELL (voice-over): Mangione began his day in a Pennsylvania court room where he had two back-to-back hearings, first on the firearm and forgery 
 
 charges brought against him in Pennsylvania. Second, to waive his extradition to New York.
 
PETE WEEKS, BLAIR COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA DISTRICT ATTORNEY: He committed crimes in Blair County. There are allegations at this point, but we're not 
 
 in the practice of just dismissing charges simply because someone has more serious charges somewhere else.
 
SCANNELL (voice-over): Mangione won't face the charges in Pennsylvania until after he is tried in New York.
 
SCANNELL (on camera): Karen Friedman Agnifilo said that Mangione appreciates the support. She called the federal charges a pile on and 
 
 federal prosecutors today saying that they expect the state case will move forward and go to trial first. However, at this point, it is unclear when 
 
 Mangione will appear in state court and be arraigned on those 11 felony counts. Kara Scannell, CNN, New York.

HILL: Turning to the latest now on the investigation into Monday's deadly school shooting in Wisconsin. Court documents show a 20-year-old California 
 
 man admitted. He plotted with the alleged shooter, 15-year-old Natalie Rupnow to carry out a separate mass shooting. Here's Whitney Wild with that 
 
 story.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
WHITNEY WILD, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The 15-year- old girl police say shot and killed two people and wounded six more at Abundant Life Christian School in Wisconsin appears to have been in contact 
 
 with a 20-year-old man in California that according to court records obtained by CNN.
 <br>[09:25:00]
 
Alexander Paffendorf of Carlsbad, California, was plotting a mass shooting with the teen and told FBI agents during an interview, that he would arm 
 
 himself with explosives and a gun and that he would target a government building.
 
ALEX GALLEGOS, ALEXANDER PAFFENDORF'S NEIGHBOR: I've only seen him a few times. He's really quiet. I'm just glad that the cops and everybody FBI, 
 
 whoever was on top of it and is getting to the bottom of it before anything bad happened.
 
WILD (voice-over): A California judge has issued a gun violence emergency protective order under the state's Red Flag Law against Paffendorf. 
 
 According to the order FBI agents saw the messages between him and the teen. It also demands Paffendorf give up his guns in any ammunition within 
 
 48 hours, unless police take them sooner.
 
GALLEGOS: A couple hours into it, towards the end, they're carrying out a big black box looked like a gun case of some sort.
 
WILD (voice-over): It's still not clear if he's in custody or if he will face charges. The FBI is not commenting. CNN has also reached out to 
 
 Paffendorf, but hasn't heard back. In Wisconsin, new details emerging about the shooting. Police now say two guns were recovered at the school, but 
 
 won't say who owns them or how she got them.
 
Meanwhile, four people injured in the shooting are now home, while two other students are still fighting for their lives in the hospital. A local 
 
 pastor saying that one of them needs a miracle.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The students, the families --
 
WILD (voice-over): As the community and the police search for answers. We're learning more about those killed. 14-year-old Rubi Vergara was an 
 
 avid reader, a talented artist and singer, according to an obituary written far too soon. 42-year-old Erin West was the substitute coordinator and in-
 
 house substitute teacher, sophomore Mackynzie Wilson says she was beloved.
 
MACKYNZIE WILSON, SOPHOMORE AT ABUNDANT LIFE CHRISTIAN SCHOOL: She was a really good person. She really loved her kids, and she really, really loved 
 
 everyone at our school, and she would have done anything for them.
 
WILD (voice-over): Her mom, Linsay O'Connor, a former student here, says their legacies will live on.
 
LINSAY O'CONNOR, FORMER STUDENT AT ABUNDANT LIFE CHRISTIAN SCHOOL: They're integrated into our lives, and they will be forever remembered.
 
WILD (on camera): We've reached out for more details on the condition of the two children who remain in the hospital. We've received no further 
 
 details. Whitney Wild, CNN, Madison, Wisconsin.

HILL: Thousands of U.S. Starbucks workers set to join picket lines. Their union says the walk out will take place in Los Angeles, Chicago and 
 
 Seattle; other cities could be added through Christmas Eve. The union says it is striking over unfair labor practices and stall negotiations.
 
The union has struck Starbucks several times in the past has gone on strike several times in the past, a number of stores, though, did remain open 
 
 because managers and workers from non-union stores came in to work. Still ahead here a new Apple AI feature under scrutiny after sending out false 
 
 headlines from the BBC and an attempt to summarize news stories.
 
Stay with us. Plus, GLP-1 drugs, things like Ozempic, Wegovy they have been prescribed to millions of Americans hoping to lose weight, but now 
 
 thousands of users are suing the drug companies, why?
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:30:00]
 
HILL: Half past the hour now on "Connect the World". I'm Erica Hill, joining you from New York today at the top of the hour, looking at the 
 
 futures, fair amount of red there, and it looks like that has continued now since the opening bell rang just about a minute ago. Lot of concern there 
 
 about what is actually happening or not happening this hour in Washington as we wait to see whether the U.S. government will, in fact, shut down.
 
Apple really under fire for its new AI feature, which is supposed to summarize the news for you, but instead, in at least one can sent out a 
 
 false headline from the BBC. This new artificial intelligence feature, as I noted, was supposed to summarize news stories, which it did falsely last 
 
 week, in that moment, claiming that Luigi Mangione, the suspect behind the killing of the United Healthcare CEO, had in fact shot himself.
 
Reporters Without Borders is now urging Apple to remove the feature. CNN Media Correspondent Hadas Gold is covering these developments for us. So, a 
 
 fair amount of that is just outrage, but frankly, justified concern about this feature, Hadas.
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN MEDIA CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, justified concern. Because what's most worrying about this is that this AI feature was summarizing 
 
 news stories. So, we presented to you, you know, one of those few lines saying a few different news stories at once, but presenting it as though it 
 
 was coming directly from the news outlets themselves.
 
And that's what's most worrying, because people were thinking they were reading something directly from the BBC, and actually, there was another 
 
 case for the New York Times. So, some of these headlines that were published by Apple include Luigi Mangione shoots himself.
 
Made it seem directly coming from the BBC, and then actually a second one last month, this was pointed out by a pro-publican reporter that Netanyahu, 
 
 the Prime Minister of Israel, had been arrested. Now, what seems to have happened here is that the AI, this Apple intelligence, got confused, 
 
 because for the Netanyahu case, the International Criminal Court had issued an arrest warrant.
 
But Netanyahu himself had not been arrested with Luigi Mangione case, it's possible they may have gotten confused with maybe the school shooter in 
 
 Wisconsin. But no matter how or why, it got confused when it was presented to the user on their Apple iPhone, it made it seem as though had the BBC 
 
 logo, had "The New York Times" logo.
 
It made it seem that was the actual story itself. Now the BBC has complained, and they have asked Apple to fix this. Apple so far is not 
 
 commenting, and the publishers I should note they have no control over this summary. It's not like they can input what they think the summary should 
 
 be.
 
It's the AI that's taking this itself. Now if you haven't noticed this on your phone, that's because this Apple intelligence is only in the newest 
 
 iPhones and computers and on the newest operating system, but we should expect Apple intelligence will be on all of our Apple phones sometime soon.
 
Now why is this dangerous? Other than just, you know, people getting fake news is because what if, instead of another news story, it was saying 
 
 something like, there's an active shooter in New York City, where we are right now, that could instill panic. People could react to that news.
 
And that's why you're seeing places like Reporters Without Borders trying to urge Apple to just get rid of this feature itself. They said in part, 
 
 that it's a blow to the outlets' credibility, the outlets who are being cited by Apple intelligence, and a danger to the public's right to reliable 
 
 information on current affairs, Erica.
 
HILL: Yeah, it is in fact, a really big deal. Hadas really appreciated. Thank you. Let's get you up to speed on some of the other stories on our 
 
 radar right now. Ukraine says at least one person is dead, 12 others wounded after an intense Russian missile strike on Kyiv today, the attack 
 
 starting fires across the capital city.
 
Local Authorities say infrastructure and heating systems were damaged. In Southwest Nigeria, at least 35 children killed, 6 others critically injured 
 
 during a crowd crush. This happened at a fun fair at a school on Wednesday. Police say the case has now been transferred to the homicide section of the 
 
 state's Criminal Investigation Department.
 
French President Emmanuel Macron paying tribute to Gisele Pelicot, the survivor, of course, at the center of a mass rape case that has shocked the

HILL: Weight loss drugs like Ozempic have been hailed as miracle workers, transforming the lives for millions of users, but as those drugs rise in 
 
 popularity, there are also a number of people experiencing unwanted side effects. CNN's Nick Watt has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PATRICIA, FORMER OZEMPIC USER: I'm always going to the bathroom. I had to prepare myself for this, and I don't know how long I could sit.
 
NICK WATT, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Patricia is one of the 15 million or so Americans who've taken Ozempic or one of the other so called 
 
 GLP-1 drugs. She is diabetic.
 
WATT: What did you kind of hope it would achieve for you.
 
PATRICIA: Lower my A1C and help me to lose weight.
 
WATT (voice-over): She's a veteran.
 
PATRICIA: This is my battalion. I was there. Can you pick me out?
 
WATT: There. Am I right?
 
PATRICIA: Yeah.
 
WATT: Yes.
 
WATT (voice-over): She did lose weight. Her A1C did fall. Then she says her doctor double the dose as suggested by the manufacturer, and within two 
 
 weeks.
 
PATRICIA: I was gone so often it began. I began to bleed. When it became bright red blood, I knew it was hospital time.
 
WATT (voice-over): She saw a doctor in the ER.
 
PATRICIA: He said, you have a lower GI rectal infection and you're hemorrhaging.
 
WATT (voice-over): More than 1300 people have already filed suit against the makers of these drugs over side effects, they say they suffered and 
 
 inadequate warnings. Patricia plans to file soon.
 
WATT: And how many clients do you have now on this?
 
ANDREW VAN ARSDALE, PATRICIA'S ATTORNEY: We have over 6000 clients.
 
PATRICIA: It doesn't say it on the pamphlet that you're going to be hemorrhaging.
 
WATT: And if it had said that on --
 
PATRICIA: I wouldn't have taken it.
 
WATT (voice-over): The label does warn of diarrhea, but not hemorrhaging.
 
ARSDALE: I do think we'll find evidence that they were aware that some of these reports were coming in, and maybe they didn't do enough about it.
 
WATT (voice-over): The maker of Ozempic, declined an interview, but gave us a statement that reads in part, Novo Nordisk believes that the allegations 
 
 in these lawsuits are without merit, and we intend to vigorously defend against these claims, the known risks and benefits are described in their 
 
 FDA approved labeling.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You may have seen photos of celebrities and others showing off dramatic weight loss.
 
WATT (voice-over): These drugs are now ingrained in the zeitgeist.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Party time, guys.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: South Park, SNL.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Since my doctor prescribed Ozempic for Ramadan. I've never gotten more work done.
 
WATT (voice-over): And so many commercials in between.
 
WATT: I can hum the tune from the commercial.
 
ARSDALE: There's a reason you can hum the tune. There's a reason everybody knows about this because of the amount of money they're putting into the 
 
 marketing of these products.
 <br>[09:40:00]
 
PATRICIA: I heard about Ozempic on the TV.
 
WATT (voice-over): Patricia has now stopped taking it, but she says is still suffering.
 
PATRICIA: Uncontrollable diarrhea.
 
WATT: Which makes life quite hard to live.
 
PATRICIA: Right. So, I stay pretty much close to the house. I still have the effects of uncontrollable going to the bathroom.
 
WATT (on camera): There are, of course, many, many people taking these drugs very happily and getting great benefit from them. Patricia and her 
 
 lawyer are not saying these drugs should be banned. They're just saying that the manufacturers, the pharmaceutical companies, should spend a lot 
 
 more time and effort looking into potential side effects, and should make the warnings around those potential side effects much more explicit.
 
There is, of course, a long and complicated legal road ahead. Nick Watt, CNN, Los Angeles.

HILL: Los Angeles Lakers Star LeBron James setting a new NBA record in his 22nd season as a professional basketball player. Turns out he's now spent 
 
 more time on the court during the regular season than any other player in the league's history. Carolyn Manno, joining me now with more on this.
 
That is quite a milestone. Probably going to be tough to beat. So, I think he's going to hold that record for maybe a little bit.
 
CAROLYN MANNO, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: It is, you know, and he's done so many things every time we turn around, he's writing a new chapter in the 
 
 record books. But I think being the regular season minutes leader is particularly meaningful for him because he trains so hard.
 
I mean, he has been so committed to the sport for so many years, and he's still at the top of his game. So, to eclipse Kareem Abdul Jabbar, I think 
 
 he's especially meaningful for the man who's already the all-time points leader. But we'll talk a lot more about that and everything else going on 
 
 in the day in "World Sport" up ahead, Erica.
 
HILL: Looking forward to it.
