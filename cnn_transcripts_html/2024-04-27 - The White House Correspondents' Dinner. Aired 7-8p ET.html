JULIAN LIGHTFOOT, TRUMP SUPPORTER: No, sir, they're not. Read, R-E-A- D, the constitution. Read it out loud to yourself so that you hear what the words of the constitution say.
 
DONIE O'DONNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: God isn't mentioned in the Constitution. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Sir.

JESSICA DEAN, CNN ANCHOR: The all-new episode of "THE WHOLE STORY WITH ANDERSON COOPER" airs tomorrow night at 8:00 p.m. Eastern. 
 
Thank you so much for joining me this evening. I'm Jessica Dean. Our special coverage of the White House Correspondents' Dinner starts next. Have a great night.

COLIN JOST, HOST, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS' DINNER: Well, just hours ago, President Biden won the South Carolina Democratic primary, barely edging out his closest rival, time. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOHN BERMAN, CNN HOST: Good evening from the nation's capital. I'm John Berman with Sara Sidner. You might know us as most of the stars of CNN NEWS CENTRAL. 
 
Tonight's special live coverage of the White House Correspondents' Dinner where celebrities, politicians, and the invited media gather to celebrate the First Amendment. Now I say invited media because, once again, I was not invited. 
 
SARA SIDNER, CNN HOST: Oh, my goodness. I'm so sorry. I was invited but you know what, John, because you're here, I'm sacrificing fun and frivolous small talk to be with you. 
 
President Biden is expected to arrive very soon as he gets ready to tell jokes and roast the media and Washington along with "Saturday Night Live" star Colin Jost. BERMAN: So what we can promise you tonight, celebrities, dogs, goats
 
 and mayhem. Not to mention Scarlett Johansson. Now we want to kick off things live on the red carpet. That's where we find CNN's Harry Enten and Laura Coates standing by with a special guest. 
 
Good evening to you both. 
 
LAURA COATES, CNN ANCHOR AND CHIEF LEGAL ANALYST: We're so happy you guys are here and I am so happy, we both are. 
 
HARRY ENTEN, CNN SENIOR DATA CORRESPONDENT: Yes. 
 
COATES: To have Da'Vine Joy Randolph. Oh, my goodness, how are you? 
 
DA'VINE JOY RANDOLPH, ACTRESS: I am doing something so wonderful. I am so happy to be here and be here with you guys truly. 
 
COATES: We are so proud of this Oscar winner who was not crying when she won. So proud of you. 
 
RANDOLPH: Thank you. 
 
COATES: I mean, you were incredible and here you are. You know, red carpet so well. 
 
RANDOLPH: Yes. 
 
COATES: You look phenomenal. 
 
RANDOLPH: Thank you. 
 
COATES: You want to have some fun tonight? 
 
RANDOLPH: I do. I'm actually looking forward to it. I was saying, because I did "TIME 100" a couple of days ago, this is actually a new kind of fun for me because it's not so in our industry, and I love that it's global, I'm around so many other people. And I get to learn about other people and the amazing things that they've done. I'm so honored to be here tonight. 
 
COATES: There's going to be a beeline made for her, you know that, right? Like everyone is going to be around you, getting selfies. You're a legend. 
 
RANDOLPH: Thank you so much. I really feel honored. It's such a blessing in how all this turned out and it just continues to be a blessing, and I'm just so excited for what's next. It really feels like a beginning. So it's an honor to be here. 
 
ENTEN: Can I just say? You're such a pleasure because you came out here, you saw Laura, you gave her a hug, you saw me lonely off on the side. 
 
RANDOLPH: I thought he's a sweetheart. 
 
ENTEN: And you came in and you gave me a hug me and you made me offer a ride at home? 
 
RANDOLPH: Love all around. 
 
ENTEN: Let me just ask you one question. You know, you were mentioning this sort of being the intersection, everything going on. What are you making of this red carpet? It feels a little short to me? 
 
RANDOLPH: It is a little short. I'm used to longer but it's fun. Because at the end of the day it's that photo op because that's the moment. So you just stand, plant yourself, and that's it. 
 
COATES: Well, in D.C. the red carpets are short, but the bureaucracy is long and everything else about it, right, is how you do it. Listen, we're so proud to have you here. I can't wait to laugh, and looking forward to hearing Colin Jost roast everyone. 
 
RANDOLPH: He's so talented. He's so talented. I cannot wait and I know he has a million stuff for us in store. 
 
COATES: But do we know if he's here, who's doing "Weekend Updates" for "SNL"? 
 
ENTEN: You know, maybe I can try my hand on it next time around. 
 
COATES: I knew he would do that. 
 
RANDOLPH: You'd be great. 
 
COATES: When's your next project? 
 
RANDOLPH: I'm currently filming Pharrell's new musical, with Universal. 
 
COATES: Are you? 
 
RANDOLPH: Yes. About his life and inspired by his life. So Virginia, we're right over in Richmond. 
 
COATES: OK, well, the friend and I now lives even closer. I'm so glad you're here. Thank you for stopping by. 
 
RANDOLPH: Thank you. Truly an honor. 
 
COATES: Have fun. 
 
RANDOLPH: Thank you so much. 
 
COATES: Oh, she's the sweetest. Guys, she's wonderful and very gracious. 
 
ENTEN: Hold on, hold on. Don't leave me. 
 
RANDOLPH: I'm going to get you. 
 
ENTEN: There we go. 
 
COATES: Harry, we're making a Da'Vine Joy sandwich. Thank you. 
 
RANDOLPH: So lovely to meet you. 
 
COATES: Go have fun. 
 
RANDOLPH: Thank you. 
 
COATES: Good luck navigating this carpet. Everyone wants to meet you. I'm so proud. 
 
I got to meet Da'Vine. Da'Vine Joy. 
 
ENTEN: Dreams do come true, Laura. 
 
COATES: Dreams come true. I'm glad we held over. 
 
BERMAN: Very nice. 
 
COATES: Uh-oh. I'm on her dress. 
 
ENTEN: Oh, no. 
 
COATES: I was on her -- I didn't want you to go. I didn't want you to go. 
 
ENTEN: It's OK. Everything is OK. 
 
COATES: Oh, no. I made a faux pas. 
 
ENTEN: No. 
 
COATES: I landed on her dress, Harry. 
 
ENTEN: It's going to be a nice long evening. 
 
COATES: Are they going to throw me out of the place now? 
 
ENTEN: They're not going to throw you out. You have many chances to make amends for your faux pas right there. 
 
COATES: OK. Well, I'll try. I'll try to do that. I'm sorry. I failed already. I was going to say, Sara, John, what should we do next? 
 <br>[19:05:00]
 
SIDNER: Laura, look, no wardrobe malfunction please. Please, we went through that at the Super Bowl. It's not OK. 
 
BERMAN: It looks really fun. It must be really nice to be there. 
 
SIDNER: Yes. 
 
BERMAN: It looks really fun to be there. You guys are having so much fun there. 
 
COATES: Well, with Harry, it's so much fun. ENTEN: The only thing that's missing is you two, but we'll get --
 
 thank you very much. 
 
COATES: I got my blush on him. Sorry. 
 
ENTEN: And you know what, there have been far worse things that I've -- far worse things have gone to my shirt before. Chicken wing sauce, pasta sauce, cream soda, so a little blush from you ain't nothing too bad. 
 
COATES: I guess I'm in the category of chicken wing sauce. 
 
ENTEN: You're both delicious. 
 
COATES: Well, I mean, I didn't know how to put it. 
 
BERMAN: I know how much condiments matter to Harry so that comes with high praise. Listen, we're going to come back to you in a little bit. Enjoy yourselves there at the party. We'll hold it down here. 
 
SIDNER: We'll try. 
 
BERMAN: Joining us now is a comedic genius, the co-creator of "Everybody Loves Raymond" and the current star of "Somebody Feed Phil" on Netflix, Phil Rosenthal. 
 
It's so great to have you here with us tonight. You do have a history which we'll get to with the White House Correspondents' Dinner in a second. But let me just ask, you know, what are you most looking forward to watching tonight? 
 
PHIL ROSENTHAL, COMEDIAN: What a night? I love that Colin Jost is doing this. His jokes are always fantastic on "SNL" and I think President Biden is going to be fantastic. I love a president who has a sense of humor. 
 
SIDNER: Don't we all? Isn't that so helpful? I do have a question for you. Do you have any tips for his speech writers and for the president as to, you know, what he should say, like what the jokes should be like? 
 
ROSENTHAL: The jokes I know are going to be good. As you know, I've worked on a couple of these and I find that if you're a little bit self-deprecating and you can make fun of yourself, that always makes all the other jokes go down easier. 
 
BERMAN: Look, ain't that true in life? I mean, there's no better humor than self-deprecating humor. Some of us have more of an opportunity for it than others. You worked on, if I remember correctly, the one I remember is Bill Clinton's last video, right? 
 
ROSENTHAL: That's exactly right. 
 
BERMAN: I mean, what's it like to work with a president on comedy? Are they totally psyched to be told what to do? ROSENTHAL: Yes, in that case this was -- I wrote jokes for him for all
 
 eight years of the White House Correspondents' Dinner. My friend Mark Katz was their go-to humor person at the White House, and he brought me in as I was running "Raymond" and I always wanted to do a funny "SNL" type of video with the president. And they said that he doesn't have time to make one of these videos. He's the president. Until his last year. And then he had time. 
 
And so the video was all about President Clinton having too much free time in his last year, and if you want to see this, it's on YouTube, it's called "President Clinton the Final Days." And he is fantastic in it. He was really funny. 
 
SIDNER: All right. Let's listen to -- there it is. It's on the screen right there. Do we have sound of this? Can we listen in? No, it's just video. All right. 
 
Back in the day, you will remember that if you were as old as John and I. 
 
BERMAN: I vividly remember that. 
 
ROSENTHAL: But they brought me in, they brought me in to direct the president. That was crazy. 
 
SIDNER: OK, that's cool. That's pretty cool. 
 
ROSENTHAL: I -- you know, if you tell the most powerful man in the world what to do and he does it, doesn't that make you the most powerful man in the world? 
 
SIDNER: Good point. 
 
ROSENTHAL: And when I told my wife that, she said, pick up yourself. 
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
BERMAN: The man who directs the leader of the free world. 
 
SIDNER: The president. 
 
BERMAN: Listen, just very quickly, Phil. Anything you have to be careful of if you're the comedian doing the roast, anything you shouldn't joke about, any, you know, third rail? 
 
ROSENTHAL: You know, good taste is always good, but I think politics are fair game, right? And of course there's going to be the requisite jokes that we all expect. The bravest act of comedy I think I ever saw in my life of any kind was Stephen Colbert at the George W. Correspondents' Dinner. 
 
BERMAN: Well, that was tough. He was tough on him and that was remembered for being tough and again, it can go all those different directions. 
 
ROSENTHAL: Yes. BERMAN: Listen, Phil, it's great to see you in person. Love your work.
 
 A big fan of everything you do. And it's even better that I know how powerful you are now. Thanks so much. Have a great night. 
 
ROSENTHAL: Yes, thank you. 
 
SIDNER: They'll be calling you up first in line, by the way. We need some one-liners. We didn't think of it. But now that we can get in touch with you, we're going to call you back. Appreciate you. 
 
ROSENTHAL: Happy to help. All right. 
 
SIDNER: Let's get back to the red carpet right now. Harry and Laura there, standing with two of the most fabulous, wonderful people that we know, other than yourselves. 
 
COATES: Do you know these women? Do you guys know these women? 
 <br>[19:10:01]
 
I mean Dana Bash and Abby Phillip. 
 
ABBY PHILLIP, ANCHOR, CNN NEWSNIGHT: Hello, hello. 
 
COATES: They don't have ear pieces. They don't know we're saying all these lovely things about them. What was that funny joke about them? Oh, yes. 
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
PHILLIP: I'm having a great time. It's weird to be on the other side of the microphone, Laura. 
 
DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: I can't hear the control room. 
 
ENTEN: That's a good thing. I think you're far better off. 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
ENTEN: Just go on. 
 
COATES: Do you guys feel calm all of a sudden, and you're like, oh, I'm going to enjoy my night. 
 
BASH: No voice into my ear. 
 
COATES: What are you looking forward to? 
 
BASH: I am looking forward to Colin Jost. I am looking forward to, honestly, Kelly O'Donnell, who is our good friend, my very good friend, very longtime friend, colleague and competitor, but really colleague and dear friend from NBC News, who I've covered campaigns with since before you were born. 
 
COATES: Thank you for that. Thank you so much. She left before I was born. 
 
ENTEN: Before both of us were born. 
 
COATES: Am I different than -- 
 
ENTEN: I'm not going to -- look it up on Wikipedia, people. 
 
COATES: This is live competition. 
 
ENTEN: Look it up at on Wikipedia. I'm just going to say. 
 
COATES: Yes, trust Wikipedia. Go back. 
 
ENTEN: Has my wrong birthday. 
 
BASH: Before all of you were born. And she's the president of the White House Correspondents Association and she did all this. And she's done such a good job and I'm really proud of her. So. 
 
COATES: Yes, I'm excited to have her roasting. 
 
PHILLIP: Yes. And you know what? I think that an "SNL" comedian is like the absolute perfect choice for this dinner because they know how to tell, especially someone who's done "Weekend Update," it's like slightly political but funny. It's just the right mix of things that I think -- I don't want to jinx him honestly. 
 
ENTEN: Don't go do that. Be flexibly surprise, right? 
 
PHILLIP: I think it could be good. 
 
BASH: It's a tough room. 
 
PHILLIP: This is the hardest room. I've talked to the comedians who have done this before. It is one of the hardest rooms, period, in all of comedy. 
 
COATES: Why is that? 
 
PHILLIP: It's our fault. It's because we -- 
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
BASH: We don't have a very good sense of humor. 
 
PHILLIP: We as journalists -- 
 
ENTEN: Speak for yourself. 
 
BASH: I do. You do. You do. 
 
PHILLIP: If it were just a room full of Harrys it would be a different story. 
 
COATES: Life will begin with a room full of Harrys. That'd be nice. ENTEN: That would honestly be one of the scariest things. I was
 
 getting return of my own voice earlier and I want to rip my ear off. So the idea of a room full of Harrys is probably the greatest nightmare that could ever be inflicted upon the American public. 
 
COATES: OK. But you're a whole television full of Harry right now, we love that. 
 
ENTEN: One last thing, you are eyeing matzo before. 
 
PHILLIP: Oh, yes, I want some. 
 
BASH: I want the other ones, please. 
 
ENTEN: You want some? 
 
BASH: This is like the Oscars where they all feed you until the end. 
 
COATES: I know. 
 
BASH: This isn't even open. 
 
ENTEN: It's not open. 
 
COATES: If this is a swag bag, I'm going to leave. 
 
ENTEN: It's a swag bag. 
 
BASH: Are you afraid that -- 
 
PHILLIP: This right here is my -- 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
ENTEN: I kept it the close for you. 
 
BASH: For real? Is this really for me? 
 
ENTEN: I kept it for you. It's for you. See I gift people here on the red carpet. 
 
BASH: This is amazing. I mean, I really thought you would never give me a gift like this, Harry. 
 
ENTEN: Well, let me tell you. I've been admiring you for years. And there we go. 
 
BASH: Thank you. Well, thank you. 
 
COATES: You want her to carry this in the White House Correspondents Dinner, a box of -- 
 
ENTEN: It's better than the food upstairs. 
 
COATES: OK. Well, good luck. It's a new thing. PHILLIP: And before I go, similarly to our excitement to see Kelly,
 
 I'm also excited to see after this dinner the ascension of Eugene Daniels as the next president of the White House Correspondents' Dinner, which makes a huge amount of history. He's the first black and LGBTQ president ever, period. There have only been, like, a handful of black members on the board in general, so it's a big moment, it's a big night for everyone. We're excited. 
 
COATES: A really important point. 
 
PHILLIP: And you guys look great. 
 
BASH: And you know what, you made it through the entire hit with this straight for you. 
 
PHILLIP: Yes, pretty straight. 
 
ENTEN: Pretty straight. 
 
COATES: Time for fun. 
 
ENTEN: Vera Wang, guys. Back to you in the studio. 
 
COATES: Vera Wang and matzo. 
 
BERMAN: And for those wanting to know what makes this correspondents' dinner different than all others, tonight we reclined at the White House Correspondents' Dinner. There's a joke for a very specific slice in the audience, right there. 
 
SIDNER: All right. We're going to go back to the red carpet in just a bit. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOST: There was a report that President Biden's campaign ended its January fundraising with $56 million in the bank. Now if he can only remember his ATM code. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[19:18:17]
 
BERMAN: Welcome back to CNN's special live coverage of the White House Correspondents' Dinner. You're looking at live pictures of the red carpet there. Fabulously dressed people getting their pictures taken. Maybe having the time of their lives. 
 
This is the annual event. I would say it is the event of the year in Washington, D.C. where the media and celebrities and politicians and very important people all get together. They dress up and they tell jokes. 
 
SIDNER: Yes, I was sitting next to -- when I went that one time when I got invited. 
 
BERMAN: You got invited last year. 
 
SIDNER: Yes. I was sitting next to Queen Searcy from "Game of Thrones," which I have never seen so that was a little awkward, and Governor Sununu, so the combination of people that are at the table you can find them. 
 
BERMAN: Did you confuse them? Did you make like "Game of Thrones" jokes to Governor Sununu? 
 
SIDNER: I did. I did, an inappropriate "Game of Thrones" jokes because I don't know what I'm talking about. So -- but she was absolutely lovely. Lena Headey was wonderful. 
 
BERMAN: Again, and you're looking at pictures of people at the red carpet right there. We're going to be with you for the entire night. Colin Jost from "Saturday Night Live" is going to be delivering the famed comedian speech, promising to be very funny. President Biden will be speaking. Reporters will be doing things they'll regret at some point as they pose for pictures on the red carpet. 
 
Let's get to our very own Laura Coates and Harry Enten who our standing by with some special guests, friends. 
 
COATES: We have a very special guest, two in fact. We have Senator John Fetterman and his love wife Gisele. 
 
How are you tonight? 
 
SEN. JOHN FETTERMAN (D-PA): I'm fantastic. It's great to be here with Gisele. 
 
GISELE FETTERMAN, WIFE OF SENATOR JOHN FETTERMAN: I'm happy to be here. 
 
COATES: Well, I was just telling the senator that I will be jealous of your outfit soon once I'm tired of wearing this. 
 
J. FETTERMAN: Absolutely. I would be happy to. Yes. She didn't -- I wasn't sure she wanted to be seen with -- 
 
G. FETTERMAN: No. I wouldn't take a photo with him on the red carpet. 
 <br>[19:20:00]
 
COATES: Oh, no. Now everyone is seeing you're on the red carpet. 
 
G. FETTERMAN: I don't know him. 
 
J. FETTERMAN: It's glorious. I put this look together for hours. 
 
G. FETTERMAN: I mean, he's committed to comfort and I guess there's something to say about that. 
 
J. FETTERMAN: Yes. COATES: Well, let me tell you. I want to honor it. You've got a rose,
 
 a lapel. You've got a bow tie, you've got almost a cummerbund-esque sort of thing going on. It's comfortable.
 
J. FETTERMAN: Yes. And I'll have to find you after and I'd be happy to donate it over. 
 
COATES: I would appreciate this because what -- but your wife can tell you what women want at the end of the night are flat shoes, am I right? 
 
G. FETTERMAN: Yes. But we also don't want to look like this. 
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
COATES: You know what, I love an honest relationship, Harry. 
 
ENTEN: You know, that is a relationship. You guys are relationship goal for me, because, you know, I've been dating a girl now for two years, and now how long have you two been married for or together for? 
 
G. FETTERMAN: Too long. 
 
COATES: Two years? Too long. 
 
J. FETTERMAN: Girl, it's CNN. You can't say that? 
 
G. FETTERMAN: Sixteen years. 
 
ENTEN: Wow. 
 
J. FETTERMAN: Look, I'm tired of being the arm candy. I'm tired about -- 
 
COATES: Well, he is the arm candy he says. I told him his better side of course is his wife. But I love because she loves to tell you like it is. 
 
J. FETTERMAN: Yes. Well, we like to say -- 
 
G. FETTERMAN: I think I've said a lot. 
 
COATES: Well, we love honesty in Washington, D.C. and of course your husband often brings that. So obviously I see it's a trait that happens at home as well. 
 
J. FETTERMAN: Well, we have three great kids at home and we're delighted to be here tonight. 
 
COATES: What are you most looking forward to about the jokes that are going to be told? Because you now in D.C., people take themselves too seriously. 
 
G. FETTERMAN: They do. I'm looking forward to like reality TV stars, like "The Valley" and "Vanderpump." That's what I'm here for. J. FETTERMAN: Well, I can't wait to see that my president, you know,
 
 Joe, you know, it's always great to see him again. And it's just having a great time here. So, yes. 
 
COATES: Well, I tell you Joe will be coming. And Brittany and Jacks are already here, so you will have a little of mixture of reality. And of course, Washington, D.C. 
 
Senator, thank you so much. 
 
G. FETTERMAN: Thank you. 
 
J. FETTERMAN: Thank you. 
 
COATES: Well, look, I love it. Look, I've been married a long time. 
 
BERMAN: Can we get a look -- 
 
COATES: And I get to see my husband the same way. 
 
BERMAN: If you can get the senator? 
 
COATES: A good look? 
 
BERMAN: I don't think we really fully -- 
 
SIDNER: We need to see his full outfit. We want to see his whole outfit. We want to see his whole outfit to be -- 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
ENTEN: You know, he's coming back. He's coming back. 
 
BERMAN: Can you just pull out so we can get a full -- 
 
ENTEN: He's wearing shorts. 
 
COATES: Get back. He's got shorts. Get back. There we go. 
 
ENTEN: Back out a little bit, you'll see shorts. 
 
COATES: Everything. 
 
ENTEN: You know, I went to Men's Warehouse, but I should have gone to Fetterman' warehouse because this, my friends, is fashion to the nth degree. 
 
COATES: And notice his wife has left the actual screen. 
 
ENTEN: Yes. 
 
COATES: She's decided I'm out of it, I was OK with the sweatshirt top but now I'm back. I love it. You look good. I'm jealous. 
 
ENTEN: Women can only take so much. 
 
J. FETTERMAN: I've always had a problem with dress codes and -- but I still shirt up. 
 
COATES: Thank you. 
 
ENTEN: Thanks, Senator. 
 
COATES: You know what, I love somebody goes by beat of their own drum. 
 
ENTEN: You know what, as somebody who does that, I respect game. 
 
COATES: Yes. 
 
ENTEN: I respect game. Senator Fetterman can only be, I can only be me. 
 
Sarah and John, you can only be you. 
 
BERMAN: That -- I have to say -- 
 
SIDNER: That is so poignant so -- 
 
BERMAN: To be there for that moment, for that moment in that relationship, to witness I think the love, but also the actual real tension over, you know, disagreement over what one should be wearing. That was wonderful. 
 
Harry, Laura, we will talk to you again very, very shortly. That was fantastic. 
 
SIDNER: And we have somebody here who can judge outfits really, really, really well, who's on the who's-who list tonight. "Glamour" editor-in-chief Samantha Barry is joining us now. 
 
First, I just have to ask you, first of all, about Fetterman. I mean, where would you put that in the ranking of things to wear to a gala? 
 
SAMANTHA BARRY, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, GLAMOUR: That is a couple that have gone to two very different events. They got dressed for two very different events there, and it was very enjoyable. I mean, obviously comfort was top of his list, maybe. Maybe not making my best dressed of the night so far I would say. 
 
SIDNER: OK. 
 
BARRY: But he leaned into his choice. 
 
BERMAN: I didn't even know he was wearing -- I should have assumed he was wearing shorts. But, you know, the sweatshirt was one thing and then when we saw the shorts, I think I understood maybe where she was coming from. 
 
BARRY: Yes. I know I totally do. It's almost like, you know, it gave me that sense of -- did you ever see Haley Bieber and Justin, her husband, when they go to an event, they look like they're two very different events? 
 
SIDNER: Yes. One has got a hoodie on. BARRY: Yes. And the other -- 
 
SIDNER: Totally glam dress. 
 
BARRY: Yes, glam. 
 
SIDNER: But he is who he is, as Harry said. 
 
BERMAN: Yes, he is. 
 
SIDNER: And he's been criticized, you know, in Congress for this. But you know what, he doesn't give a dang. 
 
BERMAN: So let's talk about the people who maybe made a different type of efforts. I don't want to judge here. What have you seen so far? What are you most looking forward to? 
 
BARRY: Well, I just think it's such an interesting night. It's a night where you have reality stairs rubbing shoulders with Republican lobbyists. You've got the Hollywood elite sit next to the headline writers and I think the fashion often does make a statement, right? 
 <br>[19:25:02]
 
While people are showing up, and I've seen some great, I hope it's already -- Molly Ringwald is in a beautiful yellow dress from a Vietnamese designer. I know that Colin Jost and his wife Scarlet Johansson are going to be arriving in Armani. Armani is dressing for both of them. And then there's people that may be very conscious on the decision that they make, right? For example, I know that the press secretary is in Bode again for the second year in a row, and that's very consciously because she wanted to support an independent New York designer who's kind of -- as opposed to American fashion dream, right? 
 
Emily Bode started in men's wear, won the CAFTA and is now in women's wear. And I think people, what they choose to wear on the carpet often can say something about who they are and what they want to show up like. 
 
SIDNER: Truly, speaking of which, Sophia Bush is coming, or there or have probably already come (INAUDIBLE). 
 
BARRY: They've arrived. Yes. As a couple. Sophia Bush who's "Glamour" cover style this week. 
 
SIDNER: We were talking earlier, and this was a blockbuster, putting her on the cover, how many people are looking at this and why. What is -- I'm going to read it now. "Sophia Bush, I finally feel like I can breathe," and she wrote the article. 
 
BARRY: This was her byline. It was like a million minutes in the first day, which is like a record-breaking cover for us. And I think a couple of things. She was coming out as queer. It was in her own words, she is dating Ashlyn Harris, who's now -- who is the U.S. soccer star there on the red carpet as a couple tonight. And I think that that personal story came across a lot for Sophia. And this is one of the big events that they've come together. They're
 
 wearing -- both wearing Hobson Studio couture. Again, a young black designer that they've decided to go to in terms of to dress them for tonight. But yes, couples on the carpet is definitely my favorite thing. 
 
BERMAN: Couples on the carpet. 
 
SIDNER: Yes. 
 
BARRY: Couple on the carpet. 
 
SIDNER: That should be a segment. 
 
BERMAN: Yes. If you see us looking down, we were glancing down at the monitor here to see the people walking in and out. So when you see our eyes go down, that's what we're doing as we pay attention here. 
 
It's funny, you know, I come from an era of journalism where most of us wore ill-fitting suits. I mean, comfortable shoes. So it's always funny when I tune it here and see people that I was like on the campaign trail with reporters I was with, you know, and again, who mostly wore things that don't fit and certainly don't match, try to dress up like this. 
 
BARRY: They're scrubbing up pretty well, like I think you're seeing a lot and then you've got obviously the peoples are so used to the red carpet. We saw Rachel Brosnahan had arrived, who's a guest at CNN tonight from "Marvelous Mrs. Maisel." She arrived in Bos, which is the big trend on the catwalk this year. Kerry Russell who's in "The Diplomat" also arrived in black. 
 
I'm also really interested in what the men showed up in the red carpet. Quest Love came in tonight, I think that was spectacular earlier today. And I think you're seeing more men, including anchors and male broadcasters, maybe taking a bit more of a chance in what they wear. 
 
BERMAN: You know. 
 
SIDNER: I mean, Fetterman took a chance. 
 
BARRY: Yes, yes. That's it. 
 
SIDNER: You know? He really made a statement with that, and I know people are going to be talking about that for a while to come. Certainly we will. 
 
BERMAN: You know, some people will take a chance, some people wear white sole shoes on TV, and you know. 
 
SIDNER: Or tennis shoes. 
 
BERMAN: Yes, and they're told they can't do it anymore. I'm just saying sometimes there are different rules for different moments. 
 
Samantha Barry, it's great to see you. 
 
BARRY: You too. 
 
BERMAN: Thank you so much for coming here. Enjoy. 
 
We're going to have much more from the red carpet. You've been watching the people coming in and out, it really has been a wonderful thing to see all the smiles there. 
 
This is CNN's special live coverage of the White House Correspondents' Dinner. Do not tune away. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[19:32:19]
 
BERMAN: All right, welcome back. This is CNN's special coverage of the WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS' DINNER. You're looking at the red carpet there, a little bit of it, as people get ready to go inside and hear Colin Jost deliver jokes, President Biden deliver jokes, and most importantly, and I say this and I mean it, it is a celebration of the First Amendment. We are thrilled you are watching along with us.
 
SIDNER: And John Berman making jokes, you've already started in, which is fine, which is good. I appreciate it.
 
BERMAN: Well, it is not a joke. I wasn't invited. That's not a joke. It is actually real.
 
SIDNER: What is this? Like the fifth year in a row, you weren't invited?
 
BERMAN: I am rarely invited to the White House Correspondents' Dinner.
 
SIDNER: I am sorry, you know, I am just going to give you my invitation. You can go have a good time.
 
But first I think we are going to Laura Coates who is out on the red carpet with Harry Enten, oh, and two other people that I know.
 
ENTEN: Thank God, Sara.
 
SIDNER: Oh, my gosh.
 
BERMAN: Oh, look at that.
 
COATES: Oh, four other people.
 
SIDNER: Four.
 
COATES: Are you seeing this? Look at this.
 
I'll be Harry Enten's Vanna White.
 
ENTEN: I wanted to be your Vanna White. You took it away from me.
 
COATES: Well, I'll be Vanna Black.
 
ENTEN: She said it, I didn't And we're done.
 
COATES: Oh, I am sorry. Colin Jost is inside. My bad. Okay, here we go.
 
How are you?
 
MANU RAJU, CNN SENIOR CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hi. Doing great.
 
COATES: Manu Raju is not in the hills of Capitol Hill right now. He is here with me.
 
KASIE HUNT, CNN ANCHOR AND CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: He is going to grab that microphone from you and put in your face.
 
RAJU: Yes. Well, and there are also members of Congress here, so it is still possible. We could chase the members down. So there is time. There is still time.
 
COATES: And Kasie Hunt, it is not the crack of dawn and we see you wide-awake.
 
HUNT: I should be in bed actually. I usually am, but you know, it is fun, it is great.
 
COATES: You look good.
 
ENTEN: And hold on. I am going to hang -- I am going to interrupt you right here and get my half of the circle.
 
You get that half --
 
COATES: Okay, you go get the half.
 
ENTEN: And I will take my half. I am going to go to Oliver Darcy, of course, runs "Reliable Sources."
 
Oliver, my question to you, as a media critic --
 
OLIVER DARCY, CNN SENIOR MEDIA REPORTER: Oh my goodness.
 
ENTEN: Are we actually doing a good job this evening so far?
 
DARCY: I think you're doing a stellar job, a tremendous job, really.
 
PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN ANCHOR: How much have you watched?
 
DARCY: I watched -- I've been -- I am watching you guys right now, let's just say that.
 
COATES: We don't trust him. In an hour, we are going to hold news about how awful we are.
 
ENTEN: And that's exactly right, Oliver --
 
HUNT: They have been letting you guys have drinks.
 
COATES: I don't know, what do you notice?
 
ENTEN: A Diet A&amp;W cream soda, that's what they are --
 
COATES: Cream soda.
 
ENTEN: Cream soda. Yes.
 
COATES: Okay, yes. Cream soda. Cream soda. That's water.
 
HUNT: What year were you born?
 
ENTEN: Oh, we don't tell people what year I am on born and I --
 
COATES: 1955?
 
ENTEN: Actually, my soul was born in 1927.
 
HUNT: 1927, okay. That seems right.
 
ENTEN: Yes, it seems right. Hold on. Phil Mattingly, who has managed to keep quiet so much so far, except for maybe a little --
 
MATTINGLY: It's actually -- that's strategic.
 
ENTEN: It's strategic, but we know that --
 
MATTINGLY: I am thinking about my career.
 
ENTEN: You're thinking about your career or --
 
COATES: Don't stop over here.
 
ENTEN: You should be over there.
 
RAJU: This is not your mic drop moment.
 
MATTINGLY: Can I turn this on you for a second?
 
ENTEN: Yes.
 
MATTINGLY: And ask you a question?
 <br>[19:35:08]
 
ENTEN: Yes.
 
MATTINGLY: You guys did an interview? 
 
ENTEN: Yes.
 
MATTINGLY: About tonight, and Laura, per usual is like glamorous and amazing and I am like, I want to like be her friend.
 
ENTEN: Yes. MATTINGLY: And you said you didn't own a tuxedo.
 
ENTEN: I don't own a tuxedo.
 
MATTINGLY: I want to know the story behind how you got the tuxedo.
 
ENTEN: Okay. So --
 
RAJU: And also, who are you wearing first?
 
ENTEN: Right question. So two weeks ago in Northern New Jersey, I went out to the Men's Warehouse and I tried on a tuxedo because I know there was a Men's Warehouse in Washington and I didn't want to have to travel with the tuxedo and I ended up getting to answer Manu's question, Vera Wang, this is a Vera Wang tuxedo.
 
I think it looks very stylish, but I have been told that Vera Wang is not known for her menswear. Is that correct?
 
MATTINGLY: Not the guy really that you should be asking. But do you like the way you look?
 
ENTEN: I guarantee it.
 
COATES: Did they guarantee?
 
RAJU: He acts like he doesn't know. I think he knows it. I think he knows it.
 
COATES: Okay, now, we will ask Oliver again, how are we doing?
 
ENTEN: Oliver?
 
DARCY: You guys are -- I don't want to get in trouble, so you're doing everything, you could do better.
 
ENTEN: I have been fixing here.
 
DARCY: Laura is doing outstanding, but you know, Harry --
 
COATES:  I am a lawyer though, that's why he has to say that.
 
ENTEN: So he is afraid of getting sued in court.
 
COATES: He is afraid of a lawsuit. I don't blame him.
 
MATTINGLY: Besides the four of us, who is the coolest person you've talked to so far?
 
COATES: Da'Vine Joy Randolph.
 
ENTEN: A hundred percent, the nicest person.
 
COATES: An Oscar winner.
 
ENTEN: Fran Drescher. Fran Drescher was also lovely to me. I saw her over there.
 
COATES: Well, I wasn't invited for the Fran Drescher. I would have sung the whole nanny song.
 
ENTEN: I am sorry. She is mine. Guys --
 
BERMAN: Oh, so noted by the way that Sara Sidner nor John Berman were listed as the coolest people you've spoken to so far tonight, but we appreciate. We appreciate you are there with --
 
COATES: Oh, shoot. I mean, wait, wait. Sara Sidner and John Berman.
 
ENTEN: Oh, yes, yes.
 
SIDNER: Don't try to do it now.
 
COATES: We are going to get fired.
 
ENTEN: And we were fired ago.
 
SIDNER: It's too late.
 
COATES: Oh, we were fired.
 
ENTEN: Yes.
 
COATES: Never mind.
 
SIDNER: I am sure that Vera Wang is watching and wonders if that might be a knockoff, but that is just me.
 
I am just saying. Don't sue me, but like -- we are going to be right back. We have much, much, much more for you from the red carpet and also, we have a wonderful panel of guests from all over this country and all different kinds of backgrounds.
 
BERMAN: There they are.
 
SIDNER: This is going to be fun. Oh, there they are in all the different shades of the world. I love it.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
[19:41:28 ]
 
BERMAN: All right, welcome back. This is CNN's special live coverage of the White House Correspondents' Dinner.
 
And this is our first look inside the banquet hall itself. This is -- oh, and there it was.
 
SIDNER: Two seconds.
 
BERMAN: There it was. I was going to described in vivid detail what we were seeing -- oh, there it is again.
 
SIDNER: Can you actually see it now to describe it vivid detail.
 
BERMAN: This is the magic of television. It is very far away. I am pretty sure, it is a ballroom inside the Washington Hilton Hotel.
 
Up there is the, I believe we call it a dais with a lectern upfront there. It is from there that we will hear Colin Jost from "Saturday Night Live" speak in a little bit and of course, President Biden will be speaking as well, and it will be interesting to hear what President Biden has to say, what he has to talk about, maybe who he will be speaking about or is it whom?
 
He gave us a preview over the last 24 hours. Listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HOWARD STERN, RADIO SHOW HOST: I don't know if you're going to debate your opponent.
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I am, somewhere, I don't know when I am happy to debate him.
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I just want to say that I've invited Biden to a debate. He can do it anytime he wants including tonight. We are ready where we are. I invite him into the courthouse.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SIDNER: All right, our esteemed panel for the evening, Scott Jennings, Van Jones, SE Cupp, Van Lathan, and Cari Champion.
 
All right, they were talking about the debate.
 
Scott, I know you have something to say about what else was said on that little back-and-forth with Howard Stern. Do you think it is going to happen, SE? You're to my left, to the left, to the left, that is where I am going today.
 
S.E. CUPP, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  Oh, Beyonce. I am feeling it, yes.
 
SIDNER: Do you think this is going to happen? Because Biden now says, he is ready.
 
CUPP: Listen, Trump has outplayed Biden a little bit on this. Trump has been saying, I'm ready, I'm ready to go. Let's do it. Biden finally said, yes, I'll do it. Now, Trump is saying, well, I am ready to go tonight. Let's do it tonight. Let's do it Monday.
 
Biden is probably going to say, I think I will wait until after the conventions when they are scheduled and Trump is going to say, oh, he is not ready, he needs time to prepare. I could go tonight.
 
And I think Trump knows it is going to be better for him because he will look very energetic, he will look robust. He doesn't have to stick to like facts. He doesn't have to talk about policies. His team doesn't care about that.
 
Biden will want to speak in facts, right and talk about policies so it will be interesting. I think it will happen, but -- I do, but I think Trump is playing a pretty good game right now.
 
BERMAN: Since you went to SE, let me go to the other host of "CNN's Crossfire," who is here with us.
 
CUPP: There you go.
 
VAN JONES, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Figuring your way back.
 
CUPP: Don't forget it.
 
BERMAN: Deep cut. Deep cut. Van Jones, so President Biden will be speaking tonight. How much do you think he can focus on Donald Trump and in what way? There are times when he speaks, he will not say Trump's name.
 
JONES: I think tonight, the funniest topic on Planet Earth is Donald Trump. Donald Trump has given comedians stuff to work with for decades. Biden will, he will do this thing.
 
But look, for me, I am excited about everything, but the Biden of it all. I am excited about Colin Jost. I think a lot -- if you're not a "Saturday Night Live" person, you don't know how funny this guy is.
 
CUPP: Yes.'
 
JONES: This guy is --
 
CUPP: And smart.
 
JONES: And smart as hell.
 
CUPP: Yes.
 
JONES: So to me, that is -- I am looking for him. I am waiting for him.
 
SIDNER: Scott Jennings.
 
SCOTT JENNINGS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Yes.
 
SIDNER: Do you think that there is a way to entice voters when you take this podium? A lot of people do watch this, is there something that you could say that they are like, you know what? He is really funny. You know what? I like him.
 
BERMAN: Are you talking about Colin Jost?
 
SIDNER: No, not Colin Jost. He is a good one possibly.
 
BERMAN: We are switching places. We are switching places.
 <br>[19:45:04] SIDNER: But for the President?
 
JENNINGS: I don't know. I mean, if you snap off a funny joke or two, it will be replayed and people will see it.
 
I am expecting him to scold the press. I mean, that's what he said he was going to do. He told Howard Stern that and there has been reporting this week that he is bothered about "The New York Times" in a way they treat him.
 
SIDNER: Bothered.
 
JENNINGS: And so --
 
JONES: It's a Friday night. It's a Friday night.
 
SIDNER: Is it a Friday night?
 
JENNINGS: But he does not --
 
SIDNER: He is already there.
 
JENNINGS: He does not believe the media is sufficiently supportive of him and the Democrats, if you can believe it. He doesn't believe that.
 
So I don't know if he is going to be funny or if he is going to stand up there and scold all of these reporters for not doing their job, which is helping him win a second term.
 
SIDNER: He might do it in a truth in jest situation. He was really funny last year.
 
JENNINGS: Yes, there is no joke -- every joke, there is truth in every joke.
 
SIDNER: There is always truth in jest.
 
JENNINGS: We will see what he does.
 
CUPP: But Scott, who are you wearing? More importantly.
 
JENNINGS: Actually, he has got Vera Wang. I've got Orangutang. That's what I have. And I took a lesser known designer, but Louisville, it is huge.
 
BERMAN: Oh my God.
 
SIDNER: You wear it well. You wear it well, Scott
 
BERMAN: Scott Jennings, bringing it.
 
All right, Van Jones is here also, Van Lathan, Van Morrison waiting in the wings for us there. Almost all the Vans we can book at one time here tonight.
 
CUPP: Almost. BERMAN: Just tell us what --
 
CUPP: Who is your hat, bud? No, I am kidding.
 
VAN LATHAN, HOST, "THE HIGHER LEARNING PODCAST" ON RINGER: All right, it's Stetson, baby. Look, it used to be that this was kind of like the all-star weekend of politics. You know, everybody was -- but now it is fairly high leverage, right?
 
Joe Biden doesn't have to get up there and prove his platform or his vision. He has to show proof of life and that is like every time he talks -- every time he talks, people want to know if he has the energy and the stamina, if he is with it enough.
 
So this actually an opportunity for him to like, in my opinion, it is not -- he has to prove something to voters anytime he is in front of a mic. So I think, it is a big deal for him. I do.
 
CARI CHAMPION, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Sara, to his point, you started off asking about are we ready for this debate? Will it finally happen?
 
SIDNER: Yes.
 
CHAMPION: I reference another sports reference to Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather. Remember everybody?
 
BERMAN: Yes.
 
SIDNER: All the way, they are fire. Yes.
 
CHAMPION: They wanted that fight, and it was prolonged for so long and then when it finally happened, it really was much ado about nothing, but there was a lot of dancing and I didn't see a real winner, if I am honest, my take.
 
You could say Floyd is the best ever, people will say that they can argue with me back-and-forth, but were talking about, was there a pure knockout? No, there wasn't. That's what I would think would happen if that were to ever happen.
 
SIDNER: The debate.
 
CHAMPION: Yes.
 
CUPP: Yes.
 
CHAMPION: And to your point, he does need to prove that he is smart and quick and that pause was just an accident by the way. By the way, I've read the prompter and also said pause , too.
 
I've read the words. I've read every word.
 
We've all been there.
 
SIDNER: We've all been there. CHAMPION: And I am not taking side, we are like, wait, stop, Good -- good morning. Is that for me? Like it happens often. I am not excusing said behavior, but I agree. Tonight, we are going to see what he has. Are we paying attention? Can he be funny? Will we be entertained? And that's what I think most people will be looking for.
 
SIDNER: I think that was a very good comment. And as my sports sister over there.
 
CHAMPION: Yes.
 
SIDNER: You brought sports into this. I am proud.
 
CHAMPION: Yes, we've got to bring that up.
 
BERMAN: Now, I understand it. Thank you for putting it into terms that I can understand.
 
CHAMPION:  I'll give you all the things you need.
 
SIDNER: Thank you, Cari.
 
All right, stick around. Our panel is going to be here with us all night long. We will have more from the red carpet right after this.
 
You're watching CNN's special coverage of the WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS' DINNER.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[19:52:21]
 
BERMAN: All right, welcome back to CNN's special live coverage of the WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS' DINNER.
 
We just got word that a short time ago, President Biden did arrive at the Washington Hilton, so all the big guests are there. Let's get right back to the red carpet.
 
Harry Enten is there with this kind of his special crush, who also happens to be a nanny.
 
ENTEN: I don't know if you remember me from last year. I commented on your accent and how I loved her accent, you're the only one that has a thicker accent than I have.
 
FRAN DRESCHER, PRESIDENT, SAG AFTRA: I do remember you. How can I forget a cute guy?
 
ENTEN: Oh my gosh. I feel pretty. Fran Fine loves me.
 
Now, I have to say I was going to the supermarket earlier. I knew that you might come so I brought some treats.
 
Gluten-free matzo.
 
DRESCHER: Yes.
 
ENTEN: And I have regular matzo.
 
DRESCHER: I like lightly salted. The gluten free doesn't taste real to me, it is a nice light cracker, but not the traditional matzo that I am used to. However, I don't really follow any rules.
 
ENTEN: Okay.
 
DRESCHER: You know, over holidays, I use all holidays as an excuse to get together with loved ones and be in gratitude for our blessings.
 
ENTEN: Oh my God. Fran Drescher, not only a hilarious woman, but also one who is profound.
 
DRESCHER: Oh, well, I don't know about that, but I like everything -- I like to turn everything get into a holiday where we can just be together in love and in gratitude.
 
ENTEN: Well, you know what? Fran Drescher, we are together here and every single time I am with you, it is my own special holiday.
 
DRESCHER: And we are in love.
 
ENTEN: Oh my God. This is the greatest thing. My cousin, Dara, I hope you're watching this. This would be amazing. Any event, thank you so much for showing up. Is there anything you want to add?
 
DRESCHER: No, I just -- happy to be here and we will see how they evening goes well.
 
ENTEN: I hope it goes well, too. It is already going well because I once again, got to speak with Fran Drescher. Thank you so much.
 
SIDNER: That was Harry Enten living his absolute best life. He now says he doesn't have to do anything else, he has just met his favorite star.
 
BERMAN: No, and cousin Dara will be so happy.
 
SIDNER: On the other side of the red carpet, Laura Coates standing by with some music royalty, Jermaine Dupri -- Laura.
 
COATES: Oh, my goodness. Look who I have with me everyone. Can you believe, I've got Jermaine Dupri and of course, Dallas Austin, A-Town came represent -- how you guys doing tonight?
 
JERMAINE DUPRI, RAPPER AND SINGER: Good, good, good.
 
DALLAS AUSTIN, RECORD PRODUCER: Amazing.
 
DUPRI: Excited to be here.
 
COATES: It this your first time coming to the White House correspondents' Dinner.
 
AUSTIN: Yes, our very first one.
 <br>[19:55:04]
 
COATES: Well, I hope it is a lot of fun. There are a lot of things going on outside, but what are you looking forward to?
 
DUPRI: I just -- I just want to just absorb the whole moment. I mean, walking in was pretty exciting, so I can imagine what is going to happen in here.
 
COATES: We don't know what's going to happen inside today, and actually when the comedians start talking, but you know, you're going to have the president of the United States, some of the people here, what are you most looking forward to hearing?
 
AUSTIN: I am mostly looking forward to the roasting we always -- 
 
(AUDIO GAP)
 
COATES: I have to clown and you CNN for this moment, I am literally talking to Jermaine Dupri and Dallas Austin and the microphone drops. No, they make the mics drop. This hasn't actually happened. Come closer to me, fellas.
 
Oh my goodness. Okay CNN, look professional. It's CNN.
 
All right, looking forward to the roast.
 
AUSTIN: Looking forward to the roast. I've always seen it on TV, but I've never been able to like be a part of its, so I am looking forward to the entertainment of it all.
 
COATES: I am too, I am looking forward to -- are you dropping more hits soon? What's going on?
 
DUPRI: Of course. I've got the number one record in the country right now, "Money Long" made for me. And you know, me and Dallas, we are working on documentaries and I just dropped the Freaknik documentary.
 
COATES: And I do Uncle Luke. Uncle Luke was great.
 
AUSTIN: That's what I was saying. I am going to say the documentary, you know, we are the agency obviously. We represent Atlanta, which we are really proud about this, we are proud about the documentary and you know, we are here to represent the A for the first time.
 
COATES: I am so happy to have both of you guys here. Have a lot of fun.
 
DUPRI: Thank you.
 
COATES: I can't believe to see them here. Have a great night, gentlemen.
 
DUPRI: Thank you. Thank you.
 
COATES: All right, you take care. Thank you.
 
BERMAN: All right, this is CNN's special live coverage with audio of the White House Correspondents' Dinner.
 
In moments, the president enters the room and the jokes begins. Stay with us.
