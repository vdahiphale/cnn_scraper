BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: Former President Trump just spoke from Capitol Hill, not the capital nearby. Right?
 
BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN HOST: Yes.
 
KEILAR: It's the first time that he's been there since the insurrection on January 6th, back in 2021. 
 
He was visiting locations blocks away from the capital. Rallying House and Senate Republicans to his presumed nomination for president. 
 
SANCHEZ: CNN national correspondent, Kristen Holmes, is following the former president. 
 
He was just at the headquarters of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. He didn't speak for very long, Kristen, but he got a warm reception, applause from these Senators. 
 
KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Boris and Brianna, not only did not speak for long, but he also didn't take questions, even though he was looking directly at us reporters shouting at him.
 
But he clearly had a message he wanted to put out there, which was that the party was unified behind him. And just given the indication of what we saw with the Senators on that warm welcome, the party is rallying behind the former president as the presumptive nominee. 
 
Now, with all that talk about unity, we heard a very different tenor from Donald Trump, or at least according to our sources, earlier this morning when he met with House Republicans.
 
They described him as bouncing around from topic to topic, at times, airing his grievances, talking about the justice system, insulting some of the congressional Republicans who had impeached him and saying that he was happy that many of those would impeach him were no longer in office. This was a very different Donald Trump. And according to Senators who
 
 were talking to our reporters up on the Hill, they said, even in the meeting, it was a different tone, that he was positive, that he was talking about unity. 
 
And I will remind you that Republicans on both sides, Senate and House, had hoped that this kind of message of unity would be something that Donald Trump could deliver. 
 
Just a reminder here, Donald Trump himself is not somebody who gets rid of grudges. But according to the Senators, he was saying it was time to move on. 
 
Now one thing that's notable, he did talk to Mitch McConnell. McConnell has endorsed him. But the two still hadn't spoken since that election was certified for Biden. McConnell, obviously, had blamed him, in part, for that insurrection on January 6th.
 
One other notable part about that, despite the fact that they talked, despite the fact that McConnell said that it was positive, there is a whole slew of Republican Senators who stood behind Donald Trump when he spoke just now, McConnell was not one of them. 
 
Now the question I would have asked, I was trying to ask, had he actually taken it, was what they talked about and if he would be willing to work with them. But unclear now from Donald Trump's side what that would look like.
 
KEILAR: All right. Kristen, we know you had a question for him. We're sorry that you didn't get to ask it or that he didn't answer it, I should say.
 
Kristen Holmes, on the Hill, thank you for that. 
 <br>[14:34:39]
 
President Biden to speak alongside Ukraine's leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy any minute now. We're going to bring you the president's remarks live once they begin.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
KEILAR: At any moment now, we expect to see President Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy shoulder to shoulder on the sidelines of the G-7 summit in Italy.
 
The two leaders are set to announce a 10-years security agreement aimed at reaffirming American resolve to support Kyiv in face -- in the face of Russia's invasion.
 
Earlier, the group of seven leaders agreed to lend tens of billions of dollars to Ukraine. Its money backed by the profits from frozen Russian assets. 
 
This is a win for President Biden, who has been urging allies to seal this deal. And it's all fueling comparisons to post World War II tensions between
 
 the United States and the Soviet Union. 
 <br>[14:40:02]
 
The Cold War brought the threat of a nuclear attack to the forefront of citizens minds, not only in the U.S., but across the world. 
 
And during that time, world leaders worked to mitigate the tensions on the global stage, while various spies were working in in the shadows.
 
With tensions still high, the lessons learned from the Cold War and the stories of these secret agents are still extremely relevant.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SUSAN EISENHOWER, INTERNATIONAL SECURITY EXPERT: I think Gorbachev had a sense that he had an opportunity here to open this dialogue because he was of a different generation. And it was Gorbachev, himself, who began to change the dialogue.
 
Well, I think this is an important letter. And it's dated June 10, 1985. This is a letter Gorbachev wrote to Reagan. 
 
"That is the Soviet Union that is surrounded by American military basis, stuffed also by nuclear weapons, rather than the U.S. by Soviet bases. Try to look at the situation through our eyes."
 
KEN ABELMAN, DIRECTOR OF ARMS CONTROL, PRESIDENT REAGAN ADMINISTRATION: "Try to look at the situation through our eyes." It's a powerful line because, when you're negotiating with somebody, one of your main obligations is to see how they see the issue.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KEILAR: All right, joining us now to discuss, we have former secretary of defense and CIA director, Leon Panetta.
 
Always great to have you. 
 
I wonder, how did the spy network during the Cold War pave the way for modern-day agents? 
 
LEON PANETTA, FORMER DEFENSE SECRETARY &amp; FORMER CIA DIRECTOR: Well, I think it's fair to say that what happened during the Cold War and, frankly, what's happening today, is that there is no question that both countries have engaged in probably one of the most dangerous and risky and consequential spy games in history. 
 
In the Cold War, we had the Rosenbergs. We had Ames, who was another spy. Plus who worked for the CIA, high-level spy for the Russians. Robert Hansen, who was an FBI agent, who was a spy for the Russians. 
 
The United States, we had a high-level spy named Oleg Penkovsky, who gave us very important missile information in the Cuban Missile Crisis. We also had Gary Powers shot down, U-2 flight over Russia. And that -- that continues today. When I was director of the CIA, the
 
 Russians tried to place 10 spies in the United States in an effort to try to move them into sensitive positions. We were able, from our own sources, to be able to stop it. But it is continuing today. 
 
KEILAR: I want to ask you about -- as you see continuing today, I want to ask you about what we're seeing today, Russian ships and submarines, armed with hypersonic missiles, not nuclear weapons. They say they left those at home. That's what they say. 
 
You know, whenever you see something like that in port in Cuba, I think people -- they -- they sort of see shades of the Cuban Missile Crisis. 
 
And I wonder if you do or if you think that comparison is not apt. 
 
PANETTA: You know, I think -- I think we have to be very vigilant. Putin is going to try to punch us back because he's taking a hit with the weapons that we're providing to Ukraine, the flexibility we're giving the Ukrainians to be able to go after targets in Russia.
 
And he's angry at that. So he's going to try to punch back. And I think his sending those vessels into Cuba is kind of a signal that -- that he is not pleased with what the United States is doing. And he's going to try to get back at us.
 
I think we have to be cool here. We have to look at the situation. We have to make sure that nothing on those vessels involves anything that could be a threat to our national security.
 
KEILAR: And we are watching right now, were expecting the president to begin his comments shoulder to shoulder with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy here at any moment.
 
I wonder how you see this moment in the war with Ukraine, in the U.S.'s fight against Russia, even if it doesn't have boots on the ground. 
 
How do you see this moment, especially with the uncertainty of the election in November hanging over all of this?
 <br>[14:45:03] 
 
PANETTA: I think it's a very important moment for the United States and our allies, our G-7 allies, our NATO allies, to be able to make very clear that the United States and our allies are going to continue to provide the necessary weapons to Ukraine so that they can be successful in stopping the Russians. 
 
A 10-year commitment here is very important in terms of the weapons systems that can be provided to Ukraine. 
 
Does the fact that, you know, the election could impact on things, is that is that a threat here? Of course, it is a threat. 
 
But the issue then becomes whether a new president is going to be serious about protecting our national security when it comes to dealing with the Russians. 
 
That's a test that will face whoever is elected president in the United States. 
 
KEILAR: Let's say it is Trump. And this 10-year security deal coming out of today is something he reneges on. What would that mean? 
 
PANETTA: Well, you know, he was on the Hill today talking to the Majority (sic) Leader Mitch McConnell and talking to other Republicans. 
 
There -- there are a majority of Republicans Senators who's strongly support our assistance to Ukraine. They're the ones that are going to have to step up and make sure that Trump stands by our commitment to -- provide the weapons necessary in order for Ukraine to defend itself.
 
So, yes, it -- it's going to be shaky. Trump can be very chaotic in the way he deals with national security. 
 
But like all presidents, he's got to know that -- that his basic support in the Congress, both in the House and the Senate, is one that supports providing military aid to the Ukrainians. And stopping Putin from his aggression in Ukraine. 
 
KEILAR: When you think of what is at stake here in the months ahead and how this is approached, whoever is -- and actually -- pardon me, Secretary and Director. 
 
Let's listen in as President Zelenskyy and President Biden are going to be walking up to this signing area where they are going --
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: -- between the United States and Ukraine.
 
KEILAR: They'll be signing the security agreement. We just heard them make that announcement there on the stage here on the sidelines of the G-7 summit. 
 
This is an agreement that follows months of negotiations between the U.S. and Ukraine and is expected to commit the U.S. for 10-years to continue training of Ukrainian armed forces, to more cooperation in the production in weapons and military equipment.
 
Which is happening all over the U.S. in many, many states. And to the continued provision of military assistance and greater intelligence sharing. 
 
Let's listen in. 
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: -- the NATO summit in Lithuania. The United States brought together, I remember, the G-7 to sign a joint declaration of support for Ukraine. Twenty-five additional countries joined us quickly. Each agreed to forge a long- term bilateral commitment with Ukraine.
 
President Zelenskyy and I have just now signed that agreement between the United States and Ukraine.
 
Our goal is to strengthen Ukraine's credible defense and deterrence capabilities for the long term. A lasting peace for Ukraine must be underwritten by Ukraine's own ability to defend itself now and to deter future aggression anytime in the future. 
 
The United States is going to help ensure that Ukraine can do both, not by sending American troops to fight in Ukraine, but by providing weapons and ammunition, expanding intelligence-sharing, continuing to train brave Ukrainian troops at bases in Europe and the United States, enhancing interoperability between our militaries in line with NATO standards.
 
Investing in Ukraine's defense industrial base so, in time, in time, they can supply their own weapons and ammunition, working with Ukraine's partners to build a future for us that is strong, sustainable and resilient.
 
And supporting Ukraine's economic recovery as well as its energy recovery after Russia has repeatedly targeted Ukraine's energy grid with massive attacks in the futile attempt to break the will of the Ukrainian people. 
 <br>[14:50:06] 
 
All these lines of efforts and others are laid out in this agreement.
 
Additionally, the G-7 achieved a significant outcome this week on the matter of Russia's frozen assets in Europe and other places outside of -- outside of Russia.
 
Back in 2022, two days after Russia's invasion, members of the G-7 and the European Union worked together to freeze $280 billion in Russian central bank funds outside of Russia. 
 
I'm very pleased to share that, this week, this week, the G-7 signed a plan to finalize and unlock $50 billion on the proceeds of those frozen assets and put that money to work for Ukraine. 
 
Another reminder to Putin we're not backing down. In fact, were standing together against this illegal aggression. 
 
The agreement that President Zelenskyy and I just signed also lays out our shared vision for a just peace, a peace rooted in the U.N. charter and the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity. 
 
A piece with a broad base of support around the world that holds Russia accountable for the damage that it has done in this war. We will see this vision strongly affirmed at the historic peace conference happening in Switzerland this weekend where Vice President Harris will represent the United States. 
 
Finally, this agreement accelerates Ukraine's integration into the European Atlantic -- Transatlantic communities. It includes major commitments from Ukraine to impact and -- excuse me, diplomat -- democratic, economic and security reform in line with the European Union's accession goals and NATO's programs of reform. 
 
While we take this step, the United States is also intensifying pressure on Russia. Yesterday, the U.S. Treasury Department made clear any bank anywhere in the world that deals with sanctioned Russian banks, companies or individuals, risk being sanctioned themselves.
 
And we announced roughly 300 new sanctions on individuals and companies that are helping Russia with war efforts. That includes key parts of Russia's financial centers.
 
(ENGINE NOISE)
 
BIDEN: I'll wait until it goes over.
 
(ENGINE NOISE)
 
BIDEN: As well as individual and entities that supply Russia with items critical to its defense production, like microeconomic -- like micro -- microelectronics, machine tools, and industrial materials. 
 
We also -- we also sanctioned more Russian future energy projects, that Russia's natural gas oil projects that are under construction and are not yet fully operating.
 
Putin is counting on revenues from these projects. Our sanctions will disrupt those plans. 
 
Plus, at the G-7, we discussed our shared concern about countries like China who are resourcing -- supplying Russia with materials they need for their war machine. And we agree that taking collective action to push back against that activity. 
 
Let me close with this. We've taken three major steps at the G-7 that collectively show Putin we cannot -- he cannot wait us out. He cannot divide us. And we'll be with Ukraine until they prevail in this war. 
 
First is a bilateral security agreement just signed. Second, a historic agreement to provide $50 billion in value from Russian sovereign assets to Ukraine. And third, an agreement to ensure our sanctions efforts disrupt third countries that are supplying Russia's war efforts. That will increase pressure on the Russian economy. 
 
Collectively, this is a powerful set of actions. And will create a stronger foundation for Ukraine's success.
 
Two-and-a-half years ago, Putin unleashed a brutal war in Ukraine and it's been a horrifying ordeal for the Ukrainian people, who are so brave and incredible.
 
It's also been a test for the world. Would we stand with Ukraine? Would we stand for sovereignty, freedom and against tyranny? The United States, the G-7 and countries around the world have consistently answered the question by saying, yes, we will. 
 
We will say it again. Yes, again and again and again. We're going to stand with Ukraine. And thank you. And I now yield to my friend from Ukraine.
 
Mr. President?
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT: Thanks so much, Mr. President Biden, your presidency, dear journalists here, Ukrainians here, Americans.
 
And thanks so much. Thanks to Georgia for invitation.
 
Dear, Friends, today is truly a historic day. And we have signed the strongest agreement within Ukraine and U.S. since our independence. And this is an agreement on security and, thus, on the protection of human life. 
 <br>[14:55:00]
 
This is an agreement on cooperation and, thus, on how our nations will become stronger. This is an agreement on steps to guarantee sustainable peace and, therefore, it benefits everyone in the world because the Russian war against Ukraine is a real, real global threat.
 
I thank you very much, Mr. President, for your leadership, which is reflected, in particular, in this agreement. And in your years of support for Ukraine.
 
I think our teams, both teams. Thanks very much for making sure that the details of the agreement are really good. 
 
And of course, I want to thank every -- every Ukrainian soldier, all our people whose courage made this level of allies between Ukraine and the United States possible.
 
And I'm proud of our people and what Ukraine can do. 
 
And I'm very grateful to all Americans, to everyone in America, who strengthens American leadership.
 
So under the points of the agreement, the agreement contains a very detailed, legally binding part, and this means that credibility of American support for our Ukrainian independence. 
 
Secondly, security commitments from the United States are based among other things, on their sustainability of security and defense support. Not only for the duration of this war, but also, also for the period of peace after the war. And we will definitely ensure peace. 
 
Third, it clearly states that America's war grants efforts to win this war. 
 
Fourth, the agreement has good provisions on weapons for our defense, whereas specifically on their petrol systems were specifically on the supply of fighter squadrons to Ukraine. That's right, plural squadrons, including, but not limited to have F-16s. We have worked for a long time for these. The agreement is also very specific about the supply of the necessary
 
 weapons, joint production, and strengthening of the defense industries of our countries through our cooperation.
 
And this is something that will not only provide security, but also new good jobs for Ukrainians and Americans. 
 
The agreement also outlines what is needed in terms of intelligence information. The agreement contains key aspects of protecting the lives of our people.
 
Fifths (sic), it is very important that the agreement also addresses the issue of Russia's just responsibility for this war and its attempts to destroy Ukrainians.
 
America supports both the compensation for the damage caused by Russian strikes and working out ways to ensure that frozen Russian assets are used to protect and rebuild Ukraine. 
 
The agreement also includes sanctions and export controls that will make Russia feel the pain for what it is doing. Again, the freedom of peoples.
 
And two more things. I'm grateful that the philosophy of our security agreement is, in fact, that philosophy of the allies. And that is why the issue of NATO is covered through the text of the agreement. 
 
It states that America supports Ukraine's future, future membership in NATO and recognizes that our security agreement is a bridge to Ukraine's member -- membership in NATO.
 
It is very important for all Ukrainians and for all Europeans to know that there will be no security deficit in Europe, which tempts the aggressor to war and makes the future uncertain. 
 
Now, we are clearly defining everything. We will cooperate -- cooperate for the sake of victory, make peace guarantees effective, and provide the necessary security for our people. 
 
And thank you. Mr. President, for your leadership in the G-7 decision on $50 billion loan for Ukraine. It's a vital step forward in providing sustainable support for Ukraine in winning this war. 
 <br>[14:59:58]
 
Russia's monetary assets should be used for defending lives of Ukrainians from Russian terror and for repairing the damage.</pre>
