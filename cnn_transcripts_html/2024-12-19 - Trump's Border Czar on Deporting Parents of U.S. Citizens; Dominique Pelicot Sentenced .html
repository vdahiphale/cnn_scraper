MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome back to CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Max Foster. If you're just joining us here are today's top stories.
 
The U.S. Congress now has just two days to avert the government shutdown. That's after President-elect Donald Trump followed the lead of Elon Musk and told his Republican allies in Congress to reject a bipartisan funding bill just unveiled on Tuesday. 
 
In southern France, Dominique Pelicot has been found guilty on all charges in the mass rape of his ex-wife Gisele and has been sentenced to 20 years in prison.
 
Sentences are expected soon for the dozens of other defendants in the case. Prosecutors said Gisele Pelicot was drugged and sexually abused by more than 50 men over nearly a decade. 
 
French President Emmanuel Macron now in Mayotte. Just days after cyclone devastated the French territory, at least 31 people are confirmed dead so far, but local officials fear the death toll could eventually be in the thousands. The cyclone flattened neighborhoods, knocked out electrical grids and destroyed hospitals too. 
 
Now the British teen charged in the deadly knife attack on a dance class in England has pleaded not guilty to murder and other crimes. The 18-year-old is charged with killing three girls and wounding ten other people in a stabbing attack at a children's dance class in July. The attack sparked rioting across England and Northern Ireland, fueled by far-right activists. The violence injured more than 300 police officers and led to the attacks on hotels, housing migrants after the suspect was falsely identified as an asylum seeker. The trial is expected to begin on January the 20th. 
 
President Elect Donald Trump's pick for border czar says the incoming administration is ready to implement mass deportations, but he told CNN that they'll need major funding from Congress and a minimum of a hundred thousand beds for detention centers. Tom Homan explained to CNN why Trump wants to deport undocumented immigrants.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 <br>[04:35:00] TOM HOMAN, TRUMP'S CHOSEN BORDER CZAR: If you're in the country illegally and you got an order to be deported, we're going to arrest you, we're going to detain you, we're going to remove you. If they have a U.S. citizen child, if they chose after they come to the country illegally and chose after they've been ordered removed to have a U.S. citizen child and think, OK, the court order doesn't mean anything anymore, the removal order doesn't mean anything anymore, then what kind of message do we send to the whole world? Go ahead and cross the border illegally, which is a crime, ignore a judge's order of deportation, but have a baby and you're fine.
 
If we do that, then shut down the Immigration Court because the orders don't mean anything anymore and take the border patrol off the border. We can't send a message to the whole world that you can violate the laws of this country and not leave as required by a judge and have a U.S. citizen child, you're OK. That child can stay, they can stay with a relative, they can stay with the other parent or they can take them with them.
 
We don't deport U.S. citizens, but they put themselves in the position. We didn't. This operation isn't going to stop.
 
We've got four years to do this operation and we'll continue our focus on those who are public safety threats, national security threats, then fugitives, then the rest of the people who are not off the table. If you're in the country illegally, you've got a problem.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
FOSTER: Meanwhile, U.S. border guards used tear gas and dust clouds to deter dozens of migrants in Mexico's -- in a region of Mexico, where they'd been approached -- they'd approached the barbed wire. It was near Texas. The migrants had reportedly been misled by rumors that the U.S. would open the border on Wednesday, which was International Migrants Day. Many have expressed growing fear over policy changes when Donald Trump returns to the White House. 
 
Russian President Vladimir Putin holding his annual press conference in Moscow, still ahead, we'll have a live report to analyze what he's been telling the world.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: Well, we've just had the breaking news that Dominique Pelico has been sentenced to 20 years for organizing the mass rape of his wife for a period of 10 years. 
 <br>[04:40:05]
 
An extraordinary case. It's absolutely gripped the world.
 
We're joined now by Sarah McGrath. She's chief executive of Women for Women France. I just want to get your initial reaction to the 20 years. I mean, I can't see anyone on social media that seems to agree with it. SARAH MCGRATH, CEO, WOMEN FOR WOMEN FRANCE: Well, look, it's the maximum sentence. So I'm just learning with you about the sentence. And if you had caught me a couple of minutes earlier, you would have seen my eyes red with tears.
 
I was very -- so basically, they got what they asked for. So in France, 20 years is the maximum sentence that can be passed down for this kind of crime. France is quite notorious for having really quite lax sentencing.
 
You know, we often see cases of really horrific crimes against children of the sexual nature and women and we see sentences like six months and one year and three years. And so France is notorious for that. But I think given how extraordinary this case and the fact that it is attracting global attention, yes, we're seeing penalties that are usually a little bit harsher than they usually are.
 
FOSTER: Obviously, in no circumstances is rape ever acceptable. But what they've effectively done, haven't they, is say, you know, you can get sentenced 20 years for one rape. This was multiple hundreds of rapes. So those two cases wouldn't be comparable. And yet they are because of the nature of the French law. Do you think there'll be a lot of pressure for them to change it?
 
MCGRATH: You know, that's where the cultural difference comes into play. I mean, I'm Australian, I live in France and have done for a long time. I know Americans have a similar expectation as Australians.
 
I think this is considered quite normal in the French culture. So there isn't calls for harsher penalties, but there are calls for legal changes and justice system reform. We have a really problematic justice system when it comes to trying cases of this nature.
 
Women in France simply don't trust the French justice system. Only 10 percent of victims of rape even report the rape to the justice system. Of those reports, only 1 to 4 percent end up with a conviction. So when victims say they don't trust the justice system, I completely am with them on that. 
 
And so also, even when we do have good judges and great evidence, you know, some of our laws are really outdated. So for instance, when it comes to domestic abuse, we don't even have very specific domestic abuse laws. We've just got the same laws that we use to prosecute violence in the general public that we use to then prosecute complex domestic abuse cases. 
 
So I think there will be a lot of call for legal reform. I think there'll be a lot of call for justice system reform and also more resourcing of the justice system because a lot of victims wait for five years longer waiting for a court date and they can't rebuild until they've had been heard by a judge and had had justice handed down. So yes, there will be calls in that regard.
 
FOSTER: Isn't this one of the great contributions that Gisele has given to France and the world because she waived her anonymity, which allowed us to report on the case and the detail in a way that must have been absolutely horrific for her, but, you know, also shed a light on the justice system that you're describing.
 
MCGRATH: Exactly. You know, we have to remind ourselves that she wasn't -- it was a choice to make it public. And she's done that in service of other women.
 
You know, it's absolutely horrific what she's been going through. She's so brave. But before I heard that when the when the verdicts were handed down, she looked at each perpetrator in the eye. And I just think this woman is incredibly strong. 
 
But shining a light on these, these French justice system problems and just societal attitudes as well. I think quite often internationally, France can have a really sort of reputation of being really progressive when it comes to women's rights.
 
And that is the case, we've just had, you know, the right to an abortion put into the Constitution, which is a great move forward. However, when it comes to sexist and sexual violence, we really do lag behind our other European neighbors.
 
FOSTER: One of the other really shocking moments of the trial was the defense of some of the other men that were recruited by Dominique Pelicot and their defense. So some have obviously pleaded guilty, those who pleading not guilty, have said in their defense that they thought it was a consensual sex game, despite the fact that she was clearly completely unconscious. 
 
And, you know, do you think those men really believe that? And if they did, I mean, there's a massive problem, isn't there, within that community?
 <br>[04:45:05]
 
MCGRATH: Yes. Do I believe them if they're sincere? Look, to be honest, I just simply don't know.
 
Some of the comments really stood out to me from some of the perpetrators. One man said, I didn't think it was rape, given I didn't force her. One man said, I'm the real victim in this situation, because I didn't know I was being filmed.
 
So this man who made that comment, he obviously understands the nature of consent, because he said, well, I wasn't I didn't give my consent to be filmed. But he didn't get consent from Gisele. So he obviously understands the notion.
 
But I do think, more widely, the notion of consent is something that hasn't really -- in French society, it's only just starting to get a bit of visibility. France was the country that blocked, at a European level, the idea of consent being across the board in European laws, that that would be the notion of rape. And so I think in French society, yes, there needs to be a lot of education, starting in schools, about what consent is.
 
And then obviously, there is a debate open at the moment around putting consent into the French Penal Code. FOSTER: Sarah McGrath, thank you so much for bringing us your thoughts on that breaking story. 
 
And as you were speaking, we saw that, you know, some of the defendants there, completely covered up, protecting their own anonymity, which again, just speaks to the bravery, doesn't it, of the real hero here, which was Gisele. Thank you.
 
Right now, Russian President Vladimir Putin holding his annual press conference in Moscow. The event includes a public phone in session where both journalists and ordinary Russians can ask questions directly to the President. A few moments ago, Putin talked about the Russian economy, interest rates, inflation, because the economy is under pressure there.
 
He was also asked about the special military operation in Ukraine, as they call it, and if Russia was any closer to victory. What are you making of it, Clare? You've got a few hours to go, right?
 
CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I mean, traditionally, it's about four hours or so that he talks. And it took a little bit of time, 20 minutes or so to even get to the subject of what Russia still calls its special military operation, the war in Ukraine. But Putin has been talking up Russia's success.
 
Obviously, this has been a year where it's not a stalemate anymore. Russia has the initiative on the front line, it has been inching forward, especially in the east. And Putin said, the situation is changing dramatically. He said, we're not talking about advancing by, you know, a couple of hundred meters. He said, we're taking back territory by square kilometers every day. So really trying to talk up that success.
 
There was just an interesting question from the Kursk region, which is, of course, where Ukraine launched that incursion in August. People wanting to know, you know, when their housing will be restored, when the situation will be brought under control there. Putin trying to reassure them that, of course, it will be, the Ukrainians will be pushed out. We know there's an offensive happening right now with the help of North Korean troops to do that. 
 
And another interesting question about how one person asking why soldiers fighting in Kursk are paid so much less than those who are considered participants in the special military operation. Putin saying that he didn't know that and that that will all be fixed.
 
So I think clearly it's interesting to see Putin. He looks very confident. He's been speaking very sort of colloquially, cracking jokes, talking up the economy and Russia's successes.
 
But this is a country that has been invaded for the first time since the Second World War since that incursion into Kursk. And it's interesting that so soon after the beginning of this event, is he getting questions about that? But obviously, we're going to watch as this unfolds for any more details on Russia's strategy in this war. Obviously, the push towards peace talks that we're hearing potentially from the incoming Trump administration and his view and how that could be evolving on the U.S. president-elect himself.
 
FOSTER: He's not going to be so relaxed when he gets questions about the assassination of a Russian general just a few miles from the Kremlin.
 
SEBASTIAN: Well, I think that's the other reason why, you know, it is interesting to see him looking so confident, right? This has been a year where Russia has seen internal security breaches, not just the incursion into Kursk. We saw the Crocus City Hall terror attacks, the worst in years in Russia back in March.
 
And then there have been a number of assassination attempts, the most recent, obviously, being that general in Moscow. He hasn't spoken about that yet. It's possible he could get a question.
 
This whole event is sort of carried out as a very choreographed show of openness. So the questions are vetted, but that doesn't mean it won't happen. So it'll be interesting to hear what he has to say about that.
 
Traditionally, you know, he waits to talk about these things.
 
FOSTER: Journalists take part in it, so it is remarkably transparent, actually.
 
SEBASTIAN: I mean, it is. The questions are usually vetted and obviously come from different regions of Russia. They're talking out this year how they're using AI to sort of collate the questions and the topic.
 <br>[04:50:00]
 
An interesting way that the Kremlin tries to show that, one, he's sort of in command of all these disparate issues, and two, that he's willing to get out there and talk about them. It is, of course, highly choreographed.
 
FOSTER: OK, Clare, thank you so much. We'll be back in a moment.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: Paul McCartney returning to the stage in London on Wednesday night. 
 <br>[04:55:00]
 
Sir Paul and his band kicked off the first of two nights at London's O2 Arena with the Beatles classic Money Can't Buy Me Love before playing a three-hour set. To think he has to actually pay for the royalties every time he sings those songs.
 
The music icon is wrapping up an international tour with shows in England. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
PAUL MCCARTNEY, SINGER AND MUSICIAN: Well, hello, London. Here we are. OK.
 
Well, we've been all over South America and France and Madrid and even Manchester. And here we are back home in London.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: McCartney is back at London's O2 Arena for a second night tonight, the last scheduled performance of the year. 
 
It's less than two weeks to go until the world rings in the New Year. And in New York, they're getting ready for the big countdown.

FOSTER: Bit early, but that's the official 2025 sign that'll appear in Times Square on New Year's Eve. The LED-powered numbers will stay on the ground until Monday. Then the sign will be put up on One Times Square where it'll light up when the clock strikes midnight to welcome in 2025. Not long now.
