JASON CARROLL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The State Department, once again, in constant contact with their Haitian counterparts. But once again, for security reasons, not many details being put out about what efforts are being made behind the scenes. 
 
No details about who is holding her and her daughter and why -- Brianna? 
 
BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: All right, Jason, we'll be following this closely. 
 
Jason Carroll, live for us from New Hampshire. 
 
Jim? 
 
JIM SCIUTTO, CNN HOST: Police in Tennessee believe that a potential mass shooting at a Jewish school was thwarted. Investigators say an armed man fired rounds outside the school in Memphis after he was unable to get inside. 
 
Ahead here, new police dispatch audio at the very moment the alleged gunman tried to enter the school. 
 
And the Colorado River is said to have lost a staggering 10 trillion gallons of water, all of it due to warming temperatures. We're going to show you what the loss means for nearly 40 million Americans living out west.

SCIUTTO: New details now on what police say was a potential mass shooting averted in Memphis. A gunman allegedly tried to enter a Jewish school there, but when he could not get in, he opened fire outside the building. The suspect later shot by police. 
 
CNN's Ryan Young has been following this for us. 
 
Ryan, goodness. A close call. So how exactly was the shooter averted? RYAN YOUNG, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Right. The details to this are
 
 quite scary, Jim, as you understand. So many kids going back to school in the near future all across this country. So this really puts this in the forefront. 
 
Apparently, the gunman showed up to the school and tried to gain entry. And because of safety protocols that they have at that school they were able to stop him from getting on the inside. 
 
During that time, though, the surveillance cameras at that school were able to take pictures of the man, and they were able to put the pictures to police so they could get an accurate description of the suspect. 
 
At some point, he got so frustrated about the idea that he couldn't get in, he started shooting. 
 
Listen to the 911 released tape that we got just today about this 911 call when the shooter showed up. 
 
(BEGIN AUDIO FEED)
 
911 OPERATOR: An armed party 390 South Y Station, the Hebrew Academy. He originally called advising there's a male in a lime green shirt on the property armed with a gun. Now advised the suspect left the scene. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER: We need officers to go to every Jewish facility in the city of Memphis with that broadcast and description in case he tries another facility. 
 
(END AUDIO FEED)
 
YOUNG: You understand the seriousness behind this. The FBI, the TBI, the Memphis Police Department all working on this case right now. 
 
We are told that student, a former student apparently, was pulled over at some point, and when he exited his truck, he had a weapon. The officer opened fire. Now he's in critical condition. 
 
Jim, we should say they believe he's a former student, who's also Jewish, who arrived at that school yesterday with that gun with whoever knows what intent. 
 
But this just highlights the reason why schools have to have these protocols to be able to avert situations like this. This was a close call, obviously, yesterday, but all the security protocols worked.
 
And now we have to start waiting for the TBI, the FBI to dig into this person's background to figure out exactly what the motivation was. 
 
SCIUTTO: You said security protocols. Was it as simple, for instance, as a locked door? 
 
YOUNG: Well, they haven't exposed everything to us just yet because, apparently, there are certain layers at that school. 
 
SCIUTTO: Yes.
 
YOUNG: But one of the things they talked about was there may have been some sort of double-locked door situation at that school that stopped someone from just buzzing right on in. 
 
But of course, that would be more for the investigators to kind of figure out and lay out as we start looking into this. 
 
SCIUTTO: Relief. A close call.
 
Ryan Young, thanks so much for following. 
 
Brianna? 
 
KEILAR: Job openings in the U.S. fall to their lowest level in more than two years. What this means for the Fed and the economy. 
 
Plus, survive and advance. The U.S. women narrowly avoid being knocked out of the World Cup as their struggles do continue still. Is it time to panic or are these just growing pains? 
 
We'll have much more when CNN NEWS CENTRAL returns. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[13:43:03]
 
KEILAR: Now to some of the other headlines that we are watching this hour. 
 
Police in North Carolina say they have arrested the driver who hit six migrant workers outside of a Walmart. The 68-year-old man turned himself in to police yesterday. 
 
But authorities now say they don't think he intentionally hit them. They say he told investigators that he simply panicked and left the scene. 
 
Also the western U.S. is seeing a surge of wildfires. At least 64 have scorched more than 300,000 acres across nine states. A dozen new large fires were reported this weekend. Five in Arizona alone. The threat for more remains moderate across much of the west. 
 
And a key report released today on the labor market. The number of available jobs has fallen to its lowest level in more than two years. The Fed will be keeping a close eye, of course, on these numbers. It sees the strong labor market as one cause of rising inflation. 
 
Jim? 
 
SCIUTTO: Well, much of the runoff from the heavy snow and rain across the Rocky Mountain west this past year is actually disappearing into thin air. And this loss has been going on for years. 
 
According to researchers at UCLA, rising temperatures have sucked up more than 10 trillion gallons of water from the Colorado River basin from 2000 to 2021. 
 
And this is critical because that river supplies drinking and irrigation water to seven western states with some 40 million people. 
 
CNN's Lucy Kafanov joins us from Denver. 
 
Lucy, this is interesting because folks have taken some comfort seeing the big snowfall, for instance, in the past season to help address the many issues we're seeing from rising global temperatures. 
 
But here you see a lot of that's just disappearing. That's a problem. 
 
LUCY KAFANOV, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. I mean, it ain't magic. It's climate change. And what's most concerning, Jim, is it's specifically the human-caused climate crisis that is resulting in these devastating water flow reductions. 
 <br>[13:45:00]
 
Ten trillion gallons, if you think about it, is enough to fill Lake Mead. This is a massive amount of water that's being lost, evaporated, lost because of these rising temperatures. 
 
And this new study that you mentioned from researchers at UCLA shows that the Colorado River's first ever water shortage that was declared a few years ago would not have been declared if it wasn't for anthropogenic warming.
 
Which is warming caused by us humans, from things like burning fossil fuels, from cutting down trees, farming and livestock. 
 
Now, these researchers found this 10 percent reduction in flow remained consistent even in wetter years. And this is, of course, counterintuitive. 
 
That's what you're talking about. We've seen more rain, we've seen water levels rise, and still counterintuitively they are getting lower and lower. There's less water to go round. 
 
Interestingly, there was another study down by scientists at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, which projected a 11.7 decrease in the annual stream flow. Also because of climate change. Different methodology. They came to the same conclusion. 
 
And this is, of course, having some very real-life impacts on people who live out west, especially because of those mandatory water cuts to the amount of water that farmers, for example, are allowed to use. 
 
I spoke to one such farmer in Arizona. Take a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FARMER: I'm very worried about the future because if we keep losing water, we can't pump groundwater forever, and then where's food coming from, where's our cotton coming from? You can't just move and pick and hope everything works out. You've got
 
 to plan for the future. 
 
And just kicking the can down the road and hoping for the best is what everyone seems to be doing. I don't think it's a path for success. So I'm very worried about it. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KAFANOV: And it is worrying because, even though we've had this incredibly wet winter here in Colorado, I mean, it's rained almost every evening, it's incredibly wet, that has helped Lake Mead's levels inch up this summer. 
 
But these researchers are telling CNN that basically, unless greenhouse gases are significantly curbed, we will have less and less water available as temperatures continue to rise. 
 
This is a long-term problem. One good winter is not going to create a solution -- Jim? 
 
SCIUTTO: Well, listen, every day, we see more evidence of the very real-world effects of the warming temperatures. 
 
Lucy Kafanov, thanks so much. 
 
Brianna? 
 
KEILAR: Happening now, a federal grand jury is investigating Donald Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 election. They are meeting right now in Washington as we are awaiting news on a possible indictment today. We are live outside the courthouse. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[13:52:14]
 
KEILAR: Saved by the goal post. Yea. But it's also a wake-up call for Team USA as they were inches from being bounced from the World Cup. 
 
Team USA advanced to the knockout round of 16. It was not pretty, however. The two-time defending champions barely got past Portugal. 
 
CNN's Coy Wire is with us now. 
 
OK, is it panic time? Do they need to get their stuff together? They need to get their heads on straight? What's going on, Coy? 
 
COY WIRE, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT: Yes, yes, and yes. And, Brianna, good to see you. 
 
I first saw Team USA play in person at the 2015 World Cup in Vancouver. And this current team seems to be struggling to find that same chemistry and passion we've seen from them. 
 
They needed to tie or win in order to advance against Portugal here. They were this close, Brianna, to being sent back home to the U.S. 
 
Check this out. Hardly any time left, in the 91st minute of the match and Portugal lets loose a rocket that barely catches the post here and ricochets away from the net. 
 
Team USA, they had six shots on goal. They were unable to score though, Brianna. This is just the sixth time ever the U.S. didn't score in a World Cup match. And you can see, it so nearly cost them everything. 
 
But the nil-nil draw was good enough to advance to the knockout round. Megan Rapinoe, Alex Morgan and the two-time defending champs are celebrating the narrow win by dancing afterwards. Others were taking selfies and smiling with fans.
 
And that didn't set well with two-time World Cup champ U.S. soccer legend, Carli Lloyd, who blasted the team after the match. Listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CARLI LLOYD, TWO-TIME WORLD CUP SOCCER CHAMP: Today was just simply uninspiring, disappointing. They don't look fit. They're playing as individuals. It's OK to be confident but you never want to cross the line of being arrogant. And this is exactly what can come and bite you. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WIRE: Now the head coach said that questioning the team's mentality and willingness to compete is insane, Brianna. Those were his words. 
 
But take a look at Lloyd's former teammate, Kelley O'Hara. She's also a member of the last two World Cup championship squads. And she's laying into the team after the match. 
 
This team is young. Remember, 14 of the 23 players on this squad are playing in their first World Cup ever. They were the favorite to win it all coming in, looking to become the first nation to three-peat as World Cup champs. Maybe this was the exact wake-up call this team needed. 
 
Next up will be a familiar foe, most likely a match against Sweden, 5:00 a.m. Sunday. They were in the same group in the last five World Cups and Sweden beat them in the last two Olympics. 
 
So, yes, they better get their heads on straight, they better bring it this next match coming up. 
 
KEILAR: Sometimes a little tough love is just what you need and that's what they're getting there. 
 
Coy Wire, thank you for that. 
 
Jim? 
 
WIRE: Thanks. [13:55:01]
 
SCIUTTO: Wow. That was close. 
 
Well, any moment now, the suspect in the Gilgo Beach murders is expected in court. The man, accused of three murders, making his second appearance as his wife's attorney talks to CNN about the police search of the family home. We could soon hear from prosecutors who are now building their case. 
 
That is next on CNN NEWS CENTRAL.

SCIUTTO: Happening at any moment, the alleged Gilgo Beach serial killer is appearing in a Long Island court.</pre>
