ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Hello, and welcome to our viewers joining us from all around the world and everyone streaming us on CNN Max. I'm Rosemary Church. Just ahead.
 
An assassination attempts send shockwaves around the world. Slovakia's Prime Minister shot five times in broad daylight. The most serious attack on a European leader in years.
 
As Russian troops advanced along Ukraine's frontlines, Vladimir Putin arrives in China and looking to deepen Moscow's ties with Beijing. And.
 
We'll talk to the band that played alongside U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken drawing his recent visit to Kyiv.
 
ANNOUNCER: Live from Atlanta, this is CNN NEWSROOM with Rosemarie Church.
 
CHURCH: Thanks for joining us. Slovakia's prime minister has been fighting for his life after being shot five times in an attempted assassination. Robert Fico is expected to survive according to the Slovak deputy prime minister who said his condition is no longer life threatening, but he remains in hospital. The controversial leader who is 59 had been holding a government meeting in a central Slovak town prior to the attack, which does appear to be politically motivated.
 
The gunman was arrested at the scene and no one else was hurt. The shooting has caused tremendous outrage both inside and outside of Slovakia which has been dealing with a deep political divide. Fico is a known Kremlin sympathizer who made sure Slovakia stopped sending weapons to Ukraine.
 
CNN's Clare Sebastian is following all of these developments. She joins us live from London.  Good morning to you, Clare. So, what more are you learning about the Prime Minister's condition and how all this unfolded? CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Good morning, Rosemary. I can only resume I think the most important thing as you say is that the surgery -- the hours long surgery that he underwent on Wednesday seems to have gone well, according to the country's deputy prime minister. And looks like his medical situation has been somewhat stabilized after he was said to be fighting for his life at one point on Wednesday.
 
He was shot according to Deputy Prime Minister multiple times, once through the stomach and other time through the joints in their words. But again, that surgery seems to have gone well. In terms of how this unfolded, well, it was -- you can see here in the video in broad daylight. He was at a government offsite meeting in the town of Handlova which is a couple of hours drive to the east of the capital Bratislava.
 
He was then meeting and greeting people outside this meeting when these shots rang out, of course, the security detail bundled him in -- into their car. You can see from the images, that he was already struggling to sort of move independently. And he was taken first to a hospital in that town and then eventually airlifted to another nearby hospital with a trauma center. So that is how all this unfolded in terms of the suspect where there was a person immediately detained by police.
 
We don't have a lot more details on that person at this moment. But then in a press conference by the country's defense and interior ministers, they immediately came out with a motive calling this a political assault really making the point that they felt that this was a political assassination attempt. So, we expect to get more today from police. And we'll watch as these details unfold, and especially, of course, about the Prime Minister's condition post-surgery.
 
CHURCH: And Clare, what has been the overall reaction to this attempted assassination in the country and outside?
 
SEBASTIAN: Well, I mean, internationally a very unified response, despite of course, this being a very divisive figure from his allies and those less aligned with his way of thinking brother Biden coming out and saying that this was a horrific act of violence. The NATO Secretary General of course (INAUDIBLE) NATO members calling this a appall -- he was shocked and appalled, said Jens Stoltenberg.
 
Now President Zelenskyy of Ukraine, which of course borders Slovakia and has obviously not been particularly aligned with the comments of Robert Fico who has suggested in the past that it was Ukrainian Nazis in his word that that forced President Putin to go to war with Ukraine. Parroting of course the Kremlin rhetoric on that. And President Zelenskyy coming out with a tweet on Wednesday saying that we strongly condemn this act of violence and that every effort to be made -- should be made to ensure that violence does not become the norm in any country form or sphere.
 <br>[02:05:09]
 
Now on the other side, we saw President Putin despite its being in the middle of preparations for his trip to China send a telegram to Slovakia's president in which he called this a monstrous crime and praised Robert Fico as a courageous and strong-willed man. Now inside Slovakia with these accusations from government ministers that this is a political assassination we then saw the country's president calling for calm.
 
The hope is I think this will unify people rather than exacerbating the existing polarization in the country. Take a listen to her.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ZUZANA CAPUTOVA, PRESIDENT OF SLOVAKIA (through translator): I am shocked. We are all shocked by the terrible and malicious attack on Prime Minister Robert Fico. Something serious has happened that we can't even realize yet. A physical attack on the Prime Minister is primarily an attack on a person, but it is also an attack on democracy.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEBASTIAN: She continues to warn people. She says please don't make quick judgments. I think that reflects a concern not only that violence could spread in the wake of this, but also disinformation in this very polarized political scene. Rosemary?
 
CHURCH: All right. Thanks to Clare Sebastian joining us live from London. I want to bring in Juraj Majcin now from Brussels who's a policy analyst for the European Policy Center. Appreciate you being with us.
 
JURAJ MAJCIN, POLICY ANALYST, EUROPEAN POLICY CENTER: Thank you for having me.
 
CHURCH: So, Slovakia is Prime Minister has been hospitalized after being shot multiple times in this assassination attempt that appears to have failed. What led up to this extreme level of political violence in the country and what's at the center of the heightened political polarization in the nation?
 
MAJCIN: So, I think it's important to -- as you said this in a certain context. And it's true that what happened yesterday is shocking and unprecedented. It never happened in the history of our country. And, of course, it's the result of polarization of society where on the one hand, you have supporters of the governing coalition, led by Prime Minister Fico and very radical supporters of that coalition that support their illiberal ways.
 
But on the other hand, you have also supporters of frustrated supporters of the opposition, that are even more frustrated after the presidential election was won by the -- by the coalition candidate. So, it's a highly polarized society right now. And on top of that, you have a politician stirring up, emotions stirring up stirring up hate yesterday, even though president and a number of politicians of course called for calm and for appeasing the tensions.
 
The problem is that a number of coalition leaders accused media, journalists and the opposition of causing this. So -- and we already see attempts at different disinformation outlets to put the blame on the side of the opposition in media. So, I would definitely say what led to this is a polarization. And the -- really the great divide between the two camps.
 
CHURCH: So, you mentioned the coalition blaming the opposition and mainstream media for what happened. What might they do in response to the assassination attempt in terms of cracking down on the media and anyone deemed a threat to the government?
 
MAJCIN: Yes. That's the question because, of course, the backlash might come and what is the one of the leaders of the -- of the coalition parties set was now the war started and we will take in our gloves off, if I could put it like that. So, even though the opposition called for a joint press conference, they refused that, and they did -- and they then pursued they -- their own -- with their own statement.
 
And this attack is in the series of threats and -- of addressed to journalists. Last two years ago, we had a terrorist attack against a queer club in Bratislava. Also, a politically motivated 2018, we had two journalists murdered. So, the tensions are really increasing and I don't see politicians at least from the -- from the -- from the government sides to piece that.
 
CHURCH: So, what is the situation in the country in terms of disinformation? And is that at the root of the political polarization in Slovakia?
 
MAJCIN: Well, definitely, I'm in Slovakia, if you look at different polls is the one of the greatest victims of especially Russia's disinformation. And for many reasons. And if you look at different opinion polls, disinformation combined with the -- with the hatred stirred by different political leaders leads to decrease intolerance of minorities. There is also decreasing charges of mainstream media and our populations with the vulnerable to that.
 
And we can't rule out and we already see that it happened and that attack against Prime Minister Fico will be also used to -- for political purposes and then also to spread different conspiracy theories.
 
CHURCH: So, how concerned are you about the current situation in the country? And what may happen in response to this assassination attempt, even as the government pleads against further violence?
 
MAJCIN: Of course, I mean (INAUDIBLE) immediate steps and the immediate steps, of course, increasing protection of high-level officials of government buildings. So, this is the technical side. But currently, just to give you an example, there is a law debated in select parliament that wants to transform the public broadcaster to basically state television. So, they -- and they promised to continue in that.
 
Also, there's a law and the parliament proposed on labeling different NGOs that receive money from abroad as agents with foreign support organizations with foreign support. So, I think this will increase appetite to move to move further and to use this attack as a -- as a sign -- as a reason, as an excuse to crack down on celebrities and free media and journalists.
 
CHURCH: Juraj Majcin, many thanks for joining us. Appreciate it.
 
MAJCIN: Thank you.
 
CHURCH: Russian President Vladimir Putin is in Beijing for a two-day state visit. He was greeted by Chinese leader Xi Jinping just a short time ago. And the two have already entered their first talks. They're hoping to show the world that China and Russia are very close and are only growing closer.
 
Our Kristie Lu Stout joins us now live from Hong Kong. Good to see you, Kristie. So, their no limits alliance is back in focus with Putin returning to China. What's he seeking? And what's China willing to deliver do you think?
 
KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Putin is seeking friendship, especially in the face of strong Western pressure. And he's getting that he's getting that display of friendship and unity in China. He is back in China for this red carpet stay visit. And today, Putin and Xi already held talks in the Great Hall of the People. They spoke about regional issues, Ukraine and the Middle East.
 
And right now, I believe they're looking at live pictures on your screen a signing ceremony is underway in Beijing with Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin signing documents. Later today, there will be a state reception, and there will also be a gala concert to mark some 75 years of diplomatic ties. And when they had talks earlier today, again, the great hall the people in Beijing, Xi Jinping hailed the relationship.
 
This is what he said. The Chinese leader is saying that the China- Russia relationship today is hard earned, and the two sides need to cherish and nurture it. He says China is willing to jointly achieve the development and rejuvenation of our respective countries." And Xi Jinping also added this that he personally met with Vladimir Putin more than 40 times like underscoring their close relationship as you're looking at those live pictures coming in from Beijing.
 
Putin also hailed the relationship. He gave an interview with Xinhua, Chinese state media before he touched down in Beijing today. And he said that the China-Russia relationship reached "the highest level ever" and it's true relations have grown very strong, especially as the U.S. and its allies impose sanctions against both these countries, especially Russia after invaded Ukraine. Trade is also very strong.
 
I want to quickly show you this graphic here of showing you just how far trade between these two nations have surged at reached an all-time high last year with some $240 billion as Russia bought up Chinese commodities like vehicles, like vehicle parts, like chips, and China bought up Russian fields, especially crude oil. But China has been coming under rising pressure from the U.S., from Europe as well to make sure that its exports are not dual use. That they're not supporting Russia's war in Ukraine. In fact, recently the U.S. Secretary of State and Antony Blinken warned China that the United States and other countries would act if Beijing doesn't move to curb this flow of goods. And there are signs that China may be doing that, you know, we learned from Chinese customers data that China's monthly exports to Russia fell in recent months.
 
They fell in both March and April compared to last year. And so, keep in mind, you know, as we're looking at the scenes of this friendship between Russia and China, China is also working hard on arguably its number one priority, its economic recovery. And it does not want to rock the boat on that with more sanctions. So, despite this no limits relationship, this sign of unity in Beijing, China may ultimately, Rosemary, put its own interests first. Back to you.
 <br>[02:15:03]
 
CHURCH: All right. Thanks to Kristie Lu Stout joining us live from Hong Kong.
 
Well, earlier I spoke with CNN political and national security analyst David Sanger. And I asked him about the new and strengthening relationship between Russia and China and what it means for the rest of the world.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DAVID SANGER, CNN POLITICAL AND NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: I think in many ways, the most interesting and perhaps most consequential geopolitical relationship that we're going to be confronting in the next few years. Most Americans first heard about it just before the Olympics in Beijing. You'll remember that's when Vladimir Putin showed up, visited Xi Jinping was the first time both of them were sort of out of COVID isolation.
 
And they announced the partnership without limits. We now know and have lots of limits. We know that President Putin told President Xi that while he was going to do this little incursion into Ukraine and it only took a few weeks, and everything would be over quickly. She's got to be a little suspicious of that. President Putin himself doesn't like being the inferior member of these two.
 
I mean, remember when also the union met the Chinese and the 50s and 60s and 70s, there was no question that the Soviets were the bigger power. And going forward, their interests don't completely align. But they do have one major interest together and that is trying to isolate the United States.
 
CHURCH: And David, many critics in the West suggest that this alliance between Putin and Xi is an aberration and shallow compared to Russia's historic links to Europe and the U.S. What do you say to that?
 
SANGER: Well, first of all, I wouldn't call it our alliances. It's a partnership. It's more than a partnership of convenience. I don't blame people for having a hard time trying to understand it, because inside the Biden administration, I learned as I was working on New Cold War's there's a division of opinion about how seriously to go take this. But certainly, everybody takes it more seriously than they did before.
 
And that's because the trade between Russia and China has soared, as the oil and gas that would have been sold to Europe is going to China. And as the Chinese supply more dual use parts to Russia to help get around American sanctions. The Chinese have not supplied arms so far. For the Ukraine war, they've technically stayed neutral. They have supplied a lot of the parts that the Russians need to produce their own arms.

CHURCH: And join me next hour for the rest of my conversation with David Sanger.
 
Ukraine's president says the country's defense forces have partially stabilized the situation in the Kharkiv region against an ongoing Russian offensive.
 
This was the scene in Ukraine's northeast on Wednesday as troops fired at Russian positions outside Kharkiv. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has canceled all of his upcoming international travels to deal with this Russian offensive. Heavy fighting had gripped the area near the border for days after Russia launched a surprise cross border assault on Friday.
 
Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken wrapped up his visit to Kyiv. He announced the US will provide an additional $2 billion in military financing for Ukraine saying weapons are being moved quickly to the battlefield.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANTONY BLINKEN, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE: We're rushing ammunition, armored vehicles, missiles, air defenses, rushing them to get to the front lines to protect soldiers to protect civilians.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: CNN's Nick Paton Walsh is in harder cave Ukraine with the latest on the fighting.
 
NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: It really is perhaps some of the darkest days for Ukrainian military since the early moments of the invasion over two years ago. Now we have seen a sustained five days of Russian military operations and advances north of where I'm standing here in the second city of Kharkiv. Behind me startlingly blacked out as we occasionally hear blasts in the night.
 
The city itself it seems intermittently targeted to buy a missile in the last hours as well, but it's to the border towns to its north where Russia appears to be seeing progress. Ukraine's military saying they had indeed chosen more favorable positions in the key town of Vovchans'k. That's probably a euphemism for a tactical withdrawal up there. A local police chief saying they can now hear gunfire, street battles inside that town.
 <br>[02:20:02]
 
Essentially assign the Russian military has moved in. A local we saw evacuated this afternoon said that she'd been in her basement as the town burned around her for the past days. But Russian troops were indeed in the street next to her. So key progress clearly there. The Russian Ministry of Defense said that extends to nearly double digits worth of villages in that area, but ultimately, they seem to be wanting to push further down to get their military artillery guns in range of this huge population center.
 
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy canceling his forthcoming travel abroad. Remember, part of his job is going to allies asking for better weaponry faster. He also used his speeches data reassure Ukrainians that the intense Russian activity that having to try and counter to them north isn't going to necessarily leave them weaker in other areas of the front line where we have also seen significant losses by Ukraine and Russia moving forwards in the past weeks. 
 
It's been difficult for them in the east too and there are also suggestions in the south and maybe some elements of Russian progress too. All of this coming as Moscow ceases really to make the best use militarily of a window now before U.S. military aid begins to arrive in the hands of Ukrainian soldiers. It's been the absence of that munition, of that equipment that has enabled them to get to this position and lose territories of Russia already.
 
And so, acutely dark moment for Kyiv certainly one which Russia has matched with extraordinary levels of firepower and manpower across the front lines. Making good it seems on Ukraine's moment of weakness here. Nick Paton Walsh, CNN, Kharkiv, Ukraine.
 
CHURCH: Still to come. Another day of unrest in New Caledonia with dozens arrested amid deadly anti-government protests in the French territory. How the French government is cracking down on the violence. We'll have that and more on the other side of the break. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHURCH: Tensions are high In the French territory of New Caledonia where nearly 200 people have been arrested amid anti-government protests. Violence broke out on Monday after the French government proposed changes to New Caledonia's constitution which would give more French residents living in the territory the right to vote. Pro- independence groups feel it's an attempt by France to consolidate power over the Pacific Island chain.
 
At least four people have been killed in the protest's violence. France has declared a state of emergency in the territory, sending an additional 500 police officers to assist the new nearly 2000 police and military officers already stationed there.
 
CNN's Ivan Watson has more on the history of the territory and the cause of the unrest.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 <br>[02:25:10]
 
IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): An island paradise in turmoil. In the South Pacific the French territory of New Caledonia, erupting in violence for the third straight day Wednesday. Pro-independence protesters clashed with security forces leaving shops, cars, homes burned. Mostly young demonstrators are protesting against a vote held over 10,000 miles away.
 
In Paris on Tuesday, France's National Assembly has changes to voting laws in New Caledonia. The aim of the legislation to open up voter lists to French residents who've been in New Caledonia for 10 years. Local independence activists believe new voters want the Pacific archipelago to stay with France, which has ruled the islands since the 19th century.
 
DENISE FISHER, FORMER AUSTRALIAN CONSUL-GENERAL, NOUMEA NEW CALEDONIA: The kind of people are objecting to that, not just because it's been decided in Paris without them, but also they feel that they wanted to be part of a negotiation, a whole negotiation, which would include another self-determination vote.
 
WATSON: The French government wants more talks with the independence leaders before the voting rules are formally changed.
 
GABRIEL ATTAL, PRIME MINISTER OF FRANCE (through translator): Our priority is to find a global political agreement. The broadest possible political agreement with the separatists and the non- separatists which will allow us to move forward and right the future of New Caledonia. 
 
WATSON (voice-over): Leaders of the independence movement are calling for an end to the violence, which has turned deadly. For the first time deaths reported by the president's office as gunfire erupted between writers and security forces.
 
FISHER: The last two days we've seen violence of a scale we haven't seen for 30 years in New Caledonia. It is kind of marking the end of 30 years of peace in New Caledonia.
 
WATSON (voice-over): New Caledonia has had the chance to vote for independence. Three recent referendums all resulted in the decision to remain with France. That's done little to defuse tension between some residents of New Caledonia and the government in Paris.

CHURCH: Rafah is beginning to look like a ghost town as tens of thousands of Palestinians flee the fighting. Details of Israel's intensifying military operations in the city just ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:30:28]
 
CHURCH: Israel is ramping up military operations in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, despite U.S. warnings to hold off to avoid mass civilian casualties. The Israel Defense Forces say they targeted a Hamas training compound in the eastern part of the city. According to the U.N., about 600,000 Palestinians, a quarter of Gaza's population, have fled Rafah after the Israeli military ordered them to evacuate the city last week.
 
The IDF says they're also engaged in intense battles in parts of northern Gaza, including the Jabalya Camp and Gaza City, where it had previously claimed to have dismantled Hamas. The renewed fighting in northern Gaza is raising questions about Israel's long-term strategy in Gaza. Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant is voicing his frustration at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's failure to address the issue of a post-war plan for the enclave and warns that he opposes Israeli rule there.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
YOAV GALLANT, ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER (through translator): I call on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to make a decision and declare that Israel will not have a civilian rule over the Gaza Strip, that there will be no Israeli military administration in the Gaza Strip, and that a governing alternative to Hamas in the Gaza Strip will be promoted immediately.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: Gallant says the day after Hamas can only be achieved with Palestinian entities taking control of Gaza and establishing a governing alternative to Hamas. But, Netanyahu says it is essential to eliminate Hamas first.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli Prime Minister (through translator): Until it is clear that Hamas does not control Gaza militarily, nobody will be prepared to take upon himself the civil management of Gaza out of fear for their lives. Therefore, all the talk about the day after while Hamas remains intact will remain mere words, devoid of content.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh is rejecting any suggestion the group could be excluded from post-war decisions on Gaza. He is also blaming Israel for the current deadlock and the hostage-ceasefire negotiations, saying Israel responded to it by starting military operations in Rafah and refusing to end the war in the enclave.
 
The European Union says Georgia will face extra hurdles in joining the bloc if lawmakers do not withdraw their controversial Foreign Agents Bill. NATO also warns that the draft law is a mistake, saying it draws Georgia further away from Europe and closer to Moscow. That's exactly why tens of thousands of protesters are rallying against the bill. They gathered in Tbilisi, the latest in a weeks-long series of demonstrations.
 
Parliament has approved the bill, but while Georgia's president can veto the legislation, lawmakers can override such a decision. On Wednesday, protesters were joined by the foreign ministers of Estonia, Lithuania and Iceland, and they explained why.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GABRIELIUS LANDSBERGIS, LITHUANIAN FOREIGN AFFAIRS MINISTER: We are here supporting Georgia's people's aspirations to be bought of EU, to be part of NATO. And it is important to send this message that we stand with them, that they are not alone. That their worries are heard and they are supported.

CHURCH: The U.S. Secretary of State hit the stage during his trip to Kyiv, but not for a political speech. He rocked out a legendary Neil Young tune as he joined a Ukrainian band on stage. Next, we talk to the musicians who played with the top U.S. diplomat. Back to that in just a moment.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:36:30]
 
CHURCH: The U.S. Secretary of State didn't miss a beat as he sent a message about freedom in Ukraine. Antony Blinken joined the Ukrainian band called '19.99' to perform the Neil Young classic "Rockin' in the Free World." It happened during his visit to Kyiv on Tuesday. Blinken described himself on social media as a very amateur guitarist. So let's go to Kyiv now to speak with three musicians who shared the stage with Secretary Blinken. They are the lead singer, the drummer and the guitarist of the band '19.99.' Great to have you with us.
 
ARSEN GORBACH, GUITARIST, 19.99: Hi, great see you.
 
DMITRY TEMNYI, LEAD SINGER, 19.99: Hello.
 
MYKYTA KOVTUNENKO, DRUMMER, 19.99: Hello.
 
CHURCH: Wonderful. So Dmitry, let's start with you. What was it like to share the stage and play music with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken?
 
TEMNYI: It was like very thrill (ph) because all of us were deeply convinced that we will play with Neil Young.
 
(LAUGH)
 
TEMNYI: But then, Antony Blinken joined us and it is like a fairy tale. He is a very good guitarists and awesome musician. Yes.
 
CHURCH: That's great. I mean, it was just extraordinary to see, of course, from a viewer's perspective, all of you playing together. And Mykyta, what did you think of Secretary Blinken's message and the importance of the song you all played together?
 
KOVTUNENKO: For me and for Ukraine, I think it is very important message for support in these hard times. And it was very inspirational for our group and for people who are on concert, and then other people who watch this on TVs and in internet. And it was very powerful and important for us. So yes.
 
TEMNYI: You know, it is just everyday struggle for our country and our culture. Every day, thousands of Ukrainian soldiers (inaudible) and it is very hard.
 
CHURCH: Yeah.
 
TEMNYI: And first (ph), you need to keep going on, keep moving, keep do something to support our own family, our own peoples (ph).
 
CHURCH: Yeah. Totally understand that. And Arsen, what sort of practice and preparation did you have to go through to be ready for this big moment because, as you pointed out, you weren't told who you'd be playing with and that's because of security reasons clearly. But, as you mentioned, you thought it would be Neil Young. Hopefully, you weren't disappointed when Antony Blinken turned up?
 
(LAUGH)
 
GORBACH: We met with guys on evening, Monday, and we were preparing on rehearsal with Neil Young's song. And in this evening, guys from fusion community who invited us texted us a message that there won't be a Neil Young. There would be one VIP guest, and we like, wow, interesting, who? And they texted us about Antony Blinken and we were like, what a surrealistic situation, and we after that, we went home and were preparing like mentally to this performance in Tuesday.
 <br>[02:40:00]
 
TEMNYI: You know, it is not hard much because all of us growing up with Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Nirvana, lots of groups they exists (ph) and we also hear jazz background because all of us (inaudible) --
 
KOVTUNENKO: In Kyiv.
 
TEMNYI: In Kyiv. And it is not like hard for us. We make it like --
 
KOVTUNENKO: We just played --
 
TEMNYI: In my rehearsal --
 
GORBACH: (inaudible) was especially hard.
 
CHURCH: And on a more somber note, I am curious to hear from all of you about how difficult it's been for your country and people enduring more than two years of war and how important it is for your role as musicians to lift people up and of course, raise awareness and funds to help fight Russia.
 
GORBACH: Ukrainians have polar thoughts about that. Many of those are negative because most of people in Ukraine say like, why he is singing songs on stage and not helping us. But we think this performance, this concert was important and it worked in that way, like it must. It helped and make -- it focused our partners to the situation. We think it's (inaudible) in the right way we think.
 
CHURCH: Well, thank you to all of you for joining us was an incredible moment, I think, for the world to see and very uniting force. And we appreciate you being with us. Thank you.
 
GORBACH: Thank you.
 
TEMNYI: Thank you too.
 
KOVTUNENKO: Thank you.
 
CHURCH: And I want to thank you for joining us. I am Rosemary Church. "World Sport" is coming up next. Then, I'll be back in about 15 minutes with more "CNN Newsroom." Do stick around.
