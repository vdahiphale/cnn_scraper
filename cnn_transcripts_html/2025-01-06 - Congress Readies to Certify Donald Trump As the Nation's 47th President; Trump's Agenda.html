KASIE HUNT, ANCHOR, CNN THIS MORNING:  It's Monday, January 6th, right now on CNN THIS MORNING.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Four years ago, January 6th, this Capitol was attacked. I'm determined to do everything in my power to respect the peaceful transfer of power.  
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
HUNT:  Four years later today, Congress readies to certify Donald Trump as the nation's 47th President. Plus -- 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA):  I think at the end of the day, President Trump is going to prefer, as he likes to say, one big, beautiful bill. And we're going to be dismantling the deep state all along the way.  
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
HUNT:  Setting the stage after securing the speaker's gavel, Mike Johnson gets the ball rolling on plans to usher in Trump's ambitious agenda. And a Wintry blast. The brutal storm traveling across states from the west to the east that could bury millions of Americans with blizzard conditions.   
 
Five A.M. here on the east coast, a live look at St. Louis, Missouri on this wintry morning. Good morning everyone, I'm Kasie Hunt, it's wonderful to have you with us. A brutal Winter storm impacting much of the country this morning. More than 55 million people under Winter weather alerts from the central U.S. to the east coast. 
 
More than 1,200 flights already canceled this morning, including hundreds of flights in and out of Washington D.C. as this region prepares for up to 16 inches of snow possible in some parts. Our city's mayor already declaring a snow emergency. Federal offices in D.C. are closed because of the snow. 
 
The closures not set to impact Congress, which is getting ready to certify the 2024 election results later today. Further west, conditions knocked out power for more than 200,000 customers from Missouri to Kentucky.  
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BEN GARDNER, TECHNICAL TROOPER, KANSAS HIGHWAY PATROL:  There are some really bad conditions out here. There's a lot of snow, significant amount of snow. You can see that about 2 to 3 inches right now, and it's rapidly coming down getting worse. I'm glad to see there's not many vehicles out here. 
 
I hope that stays the trend because you don't want to be out in this time. It's not good. It's better to stay home, allow road workers, KDOT people to get the roadways as clear as we can, and let first responders hand those critical calls.  
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
HUNT:  All right, so, everyone should be careful out there. We're trying to track down our meteorologist Derek Van Dam, who's been inundated with some tech gremlins, I don't know if they're weather- related or not, but hopefully, we'll have him for you in just a couple of minutes. But in the meantime, let's talk politics. 
 
Sweeping tax cuts, border security, raising the debt limit. Just a few of President-elect Donald Trump's priorities to begin his second term. He wants Republicans to put everything in what he calls, quote, "one big, beautiful bill", end quote. He'd like to see it passed by Memorial Day. This is, of course, going to be quite the tall order for Republicans who have a razor-thin majority in the House.  
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOHNSON:  There's a lot of merit to that, because we can put it all together, one big up or down vote, which can save the country quite literally, because there are so many elements to it. And it will give us a little bit more time to negotiate that and get it right.  
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
HUNT:  Speaker Mike Johnson trying to make it sound easy, but Senate Majority Leader John Thune knows that this demand is going to be quite a heavy lift.  
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEN. JOHN THUNE (R-SD):  We have the same set of objectives. We want to get to the same destination. But I think at times there will be differences in how we get there, and understanding the unique aspects of how the Senate operates is something that I'm going to have to be able to share and convey to the President and help him understand.
 
I think what the -- you know, what the contours are of what we can accomplish here in the Senate less(ph) realistic.  
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) HUNT:  All right, joining us now, Sophia Cai, she's political reporter
 
 for "Axios". Sophia, good morning, thank you so much for being here. 
 
SOPHIA CAI, POLITICAL REPORTER, AXIOS:  Thanks, Kasie.   
 
HUNT:  So, this of course, it's down in the procedural weeds. One bill, two bills, but the politics around it are actually pretty significant. It's very unlikely that if they try to split Donald Trump's agenda into pieces, it could actually pass the House of Representatives in those pieces because of just how small a window the House Speaker has to thread here with a majority that he has. 
 <br>[05:05:00]
 
What is step one in this process? And how likely is it do you think that Donald Trump's agenda can actually become law?  
 
CAI:  You know, I think it is fairly likely because it is everything that he has promised on the campaign trail. I mean, he said drill, baby, drill, tax cuts, and he wants to do the deportations. And what he's going to be doing now is asking Congress for the money to do it. I think that how it happens will take a while and Speaker Johnson has acknowledged that it may take until April or May to get all of this done. 
 
But he's got to write the bill first, and there's going to be a lot of negotiations. And he has acknowledged that he wants everybody to be heard and to be seen in some of that process, and then they'll have to go to the Senate where, you know, there's going to be a majority for that to pass. 
 
But even there, because, you know, there's just less room for people with objections to really make themselves feel heard. And so, you know, it might be a quicker process, and Trump will want to get his campaign promises fulfilled, but it will really take everyone to come into an agreement.  
 
HUNT:  Yes, and I mean, I think it's important to underscore part of why we're talking about it this way is that, this is designed to get around the filibuster in the Senate, right? They can -- they can -- if it's a tax bill, basically, they are able to pass it through with 50, you know, with a majority with 50 votes. 
 
What do you think is the impact of John Thune in particular, having a less -- not quite as deep of a relationship with Donald Trump as, say, the House Speaker, Mike Johnson, has started to build?  
 
CAI:  I think it means that he has fewer cards to play, and that I think, you know, everything will start with the House and Johnson. You know, it's Johnson who went to Mar-a-Lago to do a presser with Trump. You know, it's Johnson who was invited to the football games. And so, it will be with Johnson first that Trump says this is how I want it done, and it kind of leaves the Senate to sort of be in the second step of the process.
 
HUNT:  For Johnson himself, let's watch -- this was what Jim Banks had to say over the weekend. Let's take a look.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  
 
SEN. JIM BANKS (R-IN):  House Republicans are unified behind Donald Trump, the Trump agenda. If it's one reconciliation bill, if it's two, if it's ten, we've got to -- we've got to get it done. I think -- I think this week proved that we can do that.  
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
HUNT:  So, of course, a reference to the vote for House Speaker, where of course, Johnson did manage to do it on, on the first ballot. But again, especially with the timing here, Republicans are going to be so short in the House because a couple of them are likely to leave, to take posts in the Trump administration.  
 
CAI:  Yes, I think that's true. And, you know, one of the big things is that in the House, I think Johnson will have to give, you know, some bones to the Republicans who almost did not vote for him, and that they really want to be cutting spending.  
 
HUNT:  Yes, all right, Sofia Cai for us this morning, thank you so much for joining us, I appreciate it -- 
 
CAI:  Thanks, Kasie. 
 
HUNT:  All right, straight ahead here on CNN THIS MORNING, Elon Musk shifts his focus to the global stage, weighing in on the U.K.'s political landscape, calling for the replacement of a Trump ally. Plus, the device the New Orleans terror suspect used to map out his deadly Bourbon Street rampage. 
 
And just ten days before the inauguration, Donald Trump set to be sentenced in his New York hush money cover up case.  
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEN. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA):  I think New York has demonstrated, frankly, how the justice system ought to operate, no one should be above the law.  
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 <br>[05:10:00]
 
HUNT:  All right, welcome back. After weighing in on the U.S. election to get Donald Trump into office, Elon Musk is now apparently turning his sights to U.K. politics. In recent days, the world's richest man using his social media platform X to go after British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Starmer leads the more liberal Labor Party in the British government, of course.
 
Musk has posted more than 50 times since the new year, calling for Starmer's removal from office, even arguing that he should be put in prison. Musk is alleging that Starmer failed to prosecute child sex abuse cases in the country. Musk has also been apparently alienating right-wing allies over his calls to free a far-right activist in Britain. It's putting reform U.K. party leader and Trump ally Nigel Farage at odds with Musk.  
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
NIGEL FARAGE, REFORM U.K. PARTY LEADER:  The fact that he supports me politically and supports reform doesn't mean I have to agree with every single statement he makes on X. And I think you're getting bogged down in this. You know -- you know, I will at the inauguration have a conversation with him on a variety of things, this will no doubt be one of them.
 
I think I've made it perfectly clear that I don't agree with everything he stands for. But I do believe in free speech. I think he's a hero.  
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
HUNT:  So, Farage's hero doesn't seem to view him quite the same way. After that "BBC" interview aired, Musk posted this saying, quote, "the Reform Party needs a new leader. Farage doesn't have what it takes." Joining us now for more is CNN's Max Foster live for us in London. Max, good morning. Can you explain to us what exactly is going on here? Why Musk is so agitated about Keir Starmer and how Nigel Farage fits into it?  
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT:  Well, we have to try and figure a lot of it out. I mean, there's certainly a lot that Elon Musk has done to unsettle European governments. I mean, others are Italy and Germany. He's getting very involved in their internal affairs and even accusations that he's interfering in elections, for example. 
 
Here in the U.K., his issue -- he's had a longstanding issue with Keir Starmer, who he says didn't act on child exploitation back in the days when he was head of public prosecutions, and he wants Starmer to go. Starmer, you know, has to tread carefully here because obviously Elon Musk has emerged as a gatekeeper to Donald Trump, who is crucial to Starmer's success, really, in terms of any sort of foreign policy. 
 <br>[05:15:00] 
 
So, he's trying to juggle that. I think this Farage spat is particularly interesting because, you know, the beef here is over. Tommy Robinson, who is a far-right activist currently in a British prison and Musk wants him released. Farage is not a fan of this far- right leader many people see him as, and they've fallen out over it in a quite an extraordinary way. 
 
I mean, Musk is calling for Farage to go now and to lose his job. And then Musk simply -- I mean, Farage just isn't standing down. He's really standing up to Musk, which is pretty extraordinary. He's saying I'm not going anywhere, it's a point of principle for me. I don't agree with Tommy Robinson, I don't want to have anything to do with the Reform. So, he's basically -- Musk is basically falling out with leaders across the board here in the U.K.  
 
HUNT:  Yes, well, and Max, isn't this kind of remarkable in no small part because there were conversations or at least discussions that Musk might donate some large sum of money somehow through his British branch of the X platform or there was somebody floating something about him becoming a U.K. citizen so he could donate in U.K. elections to Farage. I mean, this seems like a very abrupt-about face.  
 
FOSTER:  Absolutely. I mean, Farage and Musk obviously very close to Donald Trump. And here in the U.K., Farage is seen as a  big link to Donald Trump for the U.K. So, that relationship is really important. And, you know, they -- Musk and Farage appear to be getting on really well. You know, they were meeting up, and there was all this talk that Musk was about to throw millions of dollars at Farage's Reform Party. 
 
So, it appeared to be going that way. I mean, Westminster was full of, you know, reports of this money coming towards Reform, which would give it huge power in the U.K. election in a few years time, and everyone's talking about Farage becoming the next Prime Minister. That was linked to the fact that Musk was throwing his support behind Farage. 
 
But suddenly, you know, in one tweet, Musk has thrown that all out. I don't know what he's trying to achieve from this, because obviously, Farage was a big supporter of Musk as well. He continues to be. He says he's still a fan, but he just won't compromise on this Robinson issue.  
 
HUNT:  Yes, it's very interesting, and of course, I'm curious what Donald Trump -- if Elon Musk is talking to Donald Trump about all this and what impact that might have on all of it. Max Foster for us -- 
 
FOSTER:  Yes -- 
 
HUNT:  This morning. Max, always grateful to have you, thank you so much. 
 
FOSTER:  Thanks, Kasie.
 
HUNT:  All right, coming up next here on CNN THIS MORNING, President Biden heads to New Orleans tonight. The President and the first lady will honor the victims lost in the tragic new year's day attack on Bourbon Street. Plus, as D.C. grapples with significant snowfall, Congress set to convene in just hours to certify Donald Trump's election victory, four years after the violent January 6th Capitol attack.  
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[05:20:00]
 
HUNT:  All right, 21 minutes past the hour. Here's your morning roundup. Hamas has approved an Israeli list of 34 hostages to be exchanged in a possible ceasefire deal according to "Reuters". Israel denies receiving such a list. As of last month, Hamas was still holding 100 hostages in Gaza. Today, President Joe Biden will travel to New Orleans to attend a vigil for the victims of the new year's day car-ramming.  
 
The President expected to speak at the ceremony, 14 people were killed in the ISIS-inspired terror attack. Tens of millions of Americans bracing for the significant wintry weather conditions sweeping across the nation. More than 200,000 customers from Missouri to Kentucky now have no power.  
 
Let's get to our meteorologist Derek Van Dam with the latest. Derek, this is, of course, the story of the morning here in our little studio. Everybody trying to figure out how to get in here without sliding off --
 
DEREK VAN DAM, METEOROLOGIST:  Yes -- 
 
HUNT:  The roads. What's the latest? 
 
VAN DAM:  Yes, right, somewhere on this live cam, this is actually the Lincoln Memorial in the background. This is of course, D.C., but shrouded in cloud and heavy snow as we speak. This is a storm we've been tracking all weekend long. It continues into the first parts of this work week. Lots of people heading back to work, schools are canceled. 
 
There are cars that have slid off the roadways and including this 18- wheeler that jack-knifed on the highway in Kansas City, Missouri. This is part of the ice storm in this very dynamic Winter storm that's unfolding across the country right now. We still have up to a quarter- inch of ice that could accumulate on the roadways here across Virginia into West Virginia. 
 
This is an expansive storm that spans several states over 850 miles. The radar lighting up like a Christmas tree, even though we're past the holidays now, rain to the south in Atlanta, but snow stretching from St. Louis all the way to the nation's capital, temperatures are below freezing, so, we will support snowfall in and around D.C., and it's going to get messy if you haven't noticed that already. 
 
The i-70 and Interstate-95 is going to be hit hard with several inches of snow up to 6 to locally-higher amounts possible within the area. And that ice storm has brought down power lines causing over 200,000 power outages with customers across the Midwest and into the Ohio River Valley. Here's the storm system departing through the course of the day, but again, not before leaving its mark. 
 
It is a dynamic Winter storm that's got ice, snow, wind and some of the coldest air of the season wrapping in behind it. Kasie, we'll have updates all morning.  
 
HUNT:  Yes, I have to say, you know, when you're -- my son has been home for two weeks for the holidays, and while I would normally love a snow day, I think everyone would be very happy if he could have gone back to school today --   
 
VAN DAM:  More babysitters -- 
 
HUNT:  Or less -- (LAUGHTER)
 
HUNT:  Derek Van Dam for us this morning, we'll see you later on in the show. Thank you very much --
 
VAN DAM:  All right --
 
HUNT:  All right, still coming up here after the break, a New York judge upholding Donald Trump's conviction in his hush money cover-up trial, setting him on the path to become the first convicted felon to become President. 
 <br>[05:25:00]
 
Plus, today, Congress defying the snowy weather, they're planning to convene at the Capitol to certify the 2024 election results. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BIDEN:  It's a day that most of our history we took for granted on the 6th, but I hope we never take it for granted again.      
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
HUNT:  All right, it's 5:29 a.m. here on the east coast. This is a live look at the U.S. Capitol dome. It is, in fact, still snowing here in Washington D.C., there were several inches already on the ground when I was leaving my house around 3:00 a.m. this morning. But Congress still planning to convene to certify the election later on today. 
 
Good morning, everyone, I'm Kasie Hunt. It's wonderful to have you with us. In just a matter of hours, Congress.</pre>
