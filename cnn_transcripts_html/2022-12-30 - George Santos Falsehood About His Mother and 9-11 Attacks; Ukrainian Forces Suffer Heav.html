BIANCA NOBILO, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome back to CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Bianca Nobilo. And if you are just joining us, let me bring you up to date with our top story this hour. 
 
Americans will finally get to see what's in former President Trump's tax returns. After a year's long legal battle a House committee is set to release the documents in coming hours. 
 
Plus, new revelations from another round of witness transcripts released from the January 6th Committee. Witnesses described a key Trump's request to find dead voters in efforts to overturn the 2020 election and he spoke of distrust within Trump's inner circle. 
 
U.S. Congressman-elect George Santos is facing new scrutiny over his claims that his mother was inside the World Trade Center on 9/11 and that the terror attacks played a role in her death. The New York Republican has spent the last week trying to explain a number of falsehoods including a story that his grandparents survived the Holocaust. He says he embellished his resume when he claimed he attended an elite college and worked on Wall Street. CNN's Melanie Zanona has the latest. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MELANIE ZANONA, CNN CAPITOL HILL REPORTER: Well, the legal scrutiny surrounding Rep-elect George Santos is intensifying. There are now investigations both at the local level and the federal level looking into some of Santos's lies as well as whether any potential financial crimes were committed. 
 
That includes the Nassau County district attorney's office which said in a statement that his fabrications are, quote, nothing short of stunning. 
 
And meanwhile, his web of lies continues to unravel. The latest claims that are coming under scrutiny, is that his mother was in the World Trade Center on 9/11 and that she died on 9/11 or that it played some role in her death. Santos said in a tweet that 9/11, quote, claimed his mother's life. But on his website, he says his mother actually died a few years later from a battle with cancer. And there's also an obituary that says his mother died on December 23rd, 2016, so more than 15 years after the 9/11 terror attacks. 
 <br>[04:35:02]
 
Our K-file team has also uncovered some additional falsehoods including a claim that Santos said he went to an elite private school in New York and was forced to drop out after his family fell on hard times. However, the school says there is no evidence that he actually ever went to the school. Santos has also claimed that his mother had a historically Jewish last name. But genealogists say there's no evidence of that name in his family tree. In fact, they say there's no evidence that he had Ukrainian or Jewish heritage at all in his family tree. And so, just remarkable stuff here on George Santos. But so far, the GOP leaders remaining silent.

NOBILO: Ukrainian officials say Russian forces continue to bombard the Kherson region shelling the city and surrounding areas dozens of times in the past 24 hours. Earlier a presidential adviser said Ukraine's forces experienced heavy losses in the east, namely around the towns of Bakhmut and Soledar. Although the advisors said  that Russia has lost more. This comes a day after Ukraine's military warned that Russia diverted resources from other areas to the battle for Bakhmut. 
 
Meanwhile, damage assessments are underway across Ukraine after what Kyiv describes as one of Russia's largest missile barrages since the war began more than 10 months ago. 
 
And as the war rages Russian President Vladimir Putin says his country intends to strengthen military operations with China. He spoke with Chinese leader Xi Jinping a short time ago. During their opening remarks Mr. Putin invited Mr. Xi to Moscow in the coming months. The Russian leader said relations with China were quote, the best in history. 
 
Joining me now in the studio to discuss is CNN's Nada Bashir. And, Nada, we're hearing in Kyiv -- I think there was an alert issued on Telegram telling residents to take shelter. And also, the governor, Oleksiy Kuleba, said that there have been more drone attacks today. What are we learning about what's been happening? 
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER: Well look, as you described and as you've heard from Ukrainian military officials, one of the largest barrages of Russian missile attacks and the drone attacks that we have seen over the last 10 months. And this was of course targeting Ukraine across its territory from Kyiv to those eastern front lines to also Lviv in the west. 
 
Now what we've heard from the Ukrainian officials, that this was largely targeting as we have seen in the past, Ukraine's energy infrastructure. But, in fact, there were significant civilian infrastructure damage in this attack. And of course, we have seen the civilian lives lost as well. Now we did hear from the Ukrainian military officials yesterday saying
 
 that they were able to actually intercept successfully a majority of those missiles, cruise missiles that have been launched by the Russian armed forces. But of course, we are seeing a doubling down of the attack by the Russian Armed Forces across Ukraine much as the officials in Ukraine had anticipated around the New Year. And we heard from President Zelenskyy speaking yesterday. He said that this was further evidence that Russia is, in his words, engaging in terrorist activity in Ukraine. Take a listen.

VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): With every rocket attack Russia is getting into that dead end. Russia has less rockets but the status of the biggest terrorists in the world will have a deeper impact for a long time for Russia and its citizens. Every missile will -- only will show that the tribunal will be right at the end of this.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
BASHIR: Now several power entities were hit in this attack on Thursday leaving some regions with a limited power supply. Ukrainian officials say they're now assessing potential next steps for the Russian Armed Forces that you touched on there a little earlier. We are hearing that Russia is now rediverting its resources, focusing on that battle for the city of Bakhmut. So, concerned certainly focused around that. 
 
NOBILO: And this phone call or this virtual meeting between Mr. Putin and Mr. Xi is hugely significant. Do we have a readout or any details on that? Because obviously, it's very important for Putin to try and demonstrate to the world that he's got China's backing. 
 
BASHIR: Absolutely, and I think ahead of this there had been some questions as to whether or not we might see China softening before it has become isolated somewhat in offering its the long standing support for Russia over the course of this invasion. It has so far refused to condemn this invasion of Ukraine and has taken the side of Russia when it comes to laying the blame on the United States and NATO. 
 
We have now seen those opening remarks from President Putin speaking to President Xi just a little while ago. He said that the relations between the two countries were the best that they had ever been. That they would withstand all tests. But crucially, he focused on the potential for further cooperation between the two nations. So, he described that cooperation as being a stabilizing factor, and his words, on the backdrop of increasingly geopolitical tensions in the world. 
 
But he also spoke about deepening those relation when is it comes to military cooperations. And that will be key. 
 <br>[04:40:00]
 
Of course, we are still waiting to hear from the rest of those talks between the two leaders. And of course, crucially from President Xi but that deepening of military cooperation really sets the tone for what we are expecting from the rest of the call. 
 
NOBILO: And will cause alarm, I'm sure, from the U.S. and among NATO allies. Nada Bashir, thank you so much for joining us.
 
The death toll from a huge fire that gutted a casino in Cambodia has grown to at least 24 people. But officials are concerned the number could still increase as emergency crews search for more victims. 70 people were injured in the fire that tore through the building near the Thai border, which also includes a hotel. Officials say some of the victims were trapped in their hotel rooms as the flames raged through the structure. A Cambodian official says the government will investigate the cause of the fire. 
 
Another country is set to require negative COVID tests for travelers from China. But Europe is rolling out the welcome mat. We'll also have the details just ahead for you.
 
Plus, former Pope Benedict is said to be in serious but stable condition right now. We'll check in with a live report from the Vatican just ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
NOBILO: South Korea is joining a short list of countries requiring a negative COVID test for visitors arriving from China. India and Japan are imposing similar restrictions. Beginning next week all passengers traveling to the U.S. from China must provide a negative result 48 hours before boarding a plane. 
 
Earlier this week in Italy nearly half the passengers on a flight from China to Milan tested positive. The Italian Prime Minister wants the European Union to test all passengers from China. While the block as a whole has not impose that condition, we learned this just minutes ago. Spain's health minister says passengers arriving from China as Spanish airports will be required to show a negative test for COVID-19, or proof of full vaccination. 
 <br>[04:45:00]
 
Let's bring in CNN contributor Barbie Nadeau like this hour in Rome. Barbie, obviously if Italy is imposing restrictions or even Spain, it does risk inefficacy if the rest of the EU is not imposing any restrictions. So, what are we hearing and what are the leaders of those countries urging the EU to do? 
 
BARBIE NADEAU, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Well, certainly here in Italy, these restrictions, the testing is fundamental. Italy of course was the first epicenter outside of China, the first round of the pandemic nearly three years ago. Italy's new Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni will be so pleased to find out that Spain has also joined restrictions. But she wants the rest of Europe to do the same to try to avoid any further outbreaks. Let's listen to what she had to say. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GIORGIA MELONI, ITALIAN PRIME MINISTER (through translator): This measure risks not being completely effective if it's not taken at the European level. Because we know that we can do it for flights arriving directly from China but not, for example, from those arriving via stopovers. So, I asked Health Minister Schillaci, who immediately reacted in this sense to write to the European commissioner responsible for this matter and asked the European Union to take measures in this sense.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
NADEAU: And so, you know, you've got that urgency here in Italy. And you see an effort here like in Rome, it's sort of a fine oiled machine. They didn't stop testing people that long ago. It was one of the last countries to lift restrictions as the pandemic started to get better around the world. So, you've got flights in Milan. You've got a higher percentage of people ending up positive in Milan. But here in Rome they're testing every single person on every direct flight from China and they will do so until at least the end of January -- Bianca. 
 
NOBILO: Barbie Nadeau, in Rome, thank you so much. 
 
A special mass will be held in Rome today for Pope Emeritus Benedict who is reported to be very sick. CNN correspondents have been closely watching the Vatican for any changes in his health since Pope Francis broke the news on Wednesday. On Thursday the Vatican reported that the 95-year-old Benedict is stable but that his condition does remain serious. 
 
Let's bring in CNN's Delia Gallagher for more on this. Delia, as expected with a 95-year-old man, it does look like there are ups and downs in this and different levels of alarm from when we initially heard that he was in more trouble with his health. What are you hearing today? 
 
DELIA GALLAGHER, CNN VATICAN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Bianca, it's now Friday morning. The last update we had from the Vatican was from yesterday. Let's just have a read of that one, which is the latest that we have. 
 
The Vatican said: He is absolutely lucid and vigilant and today while his condition remains serious, the situation at the moment is stable. 
 
That's relatively reassuring news considering the alarm on Wednesday but we are hoping for another update today. As you mentioned, Bianca, we are talking about the declining health of a 95-year-old. The Vatican said on Wednesday that the deterioration of his health is due to old age. And so, we are in a sort of waiting situation day by day because I think at this point it's even difficult for doctors to predict exactly what the time line might be. As you say, there can be ups and downs in these situations with elderly people. 
 
We are hoping, as I say, for another update. There will be a special mass being held in Rome today. As I imagine, mass is being said all around the world responding to Pope Francis's request for prayers for the Pope Emeritus -- Bianca. NOBILO: Delia Gallagher in Rome, thank you. 
 
The deposed former leader of Myanmar Aung San Suu Kyi has been sentenced to 7 more years in prison after she was found guilty of five counts of corruption. The 77-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner now has to serve a total prison time of 33 years, including three years of hard labor. The sentence could mean that she'll spend the rest of her life behind bars. She was previously convicted of charges ranging from graft to election violations. Suu Kyi has always denied the charges brought against her. Friday's verdict was the last of several rulings handed down against her by the military regime.
 
The U.S. military is accusing a Chinese pilot of an unsafe maneuver during a close call over the South China Sea. Officials say a Chinese fighter jet came within 20 feet from the U.S. reconnaissance plane last week. Forcing the U.S. pilot to make an evasive move. The U.S. military says its plane was in international air space at the time. 
 
South Korea is preparing for possible drone attacks. The military held drills this week after five North Korean drones crossed into its air space on Monday. One of them flew for three hours before returning to North Korea and it's not clear what happened to the other ones. 
 
Still, I had on the program, the Dallas Cowboys have already clinched a spot in the NFL playoffs, but now they're shooting for the home field advantage. 
 <br>[04:50:00]
 
Highlights from their clash for the title next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
NOBILO: The NFL playoffs are just a few weeks away and the Dallas Cowboys are heating up at just the right time. Running back Ezekiel Elliott opened the scoring in the match-up on Thursday night with the Tennessee Titans. It's his ninth straight game with a touchdown. Tennessee was playing without the first string quarterback and running back. The loss to Dallas is their sixth in a row. But they could still make the playoffs. Final score in this one, Dallas 27, Tennessee 13. 
 
Now we turn to basketball where there's no one more hotter than Luca Doncic. The Slovenian superstar scored 35 points with 12 rebounds and 13 assists to lead the Dallas Mavericks to their fifth straight win. Jaylen Green led Houston with 23 points but it wasn't enough to keep the Rockets from their seventh loss in eight games. Final score Dallas 129, Houston 114. 
 <br>[04:55:00]
 
With just two days left in 2022 we wanted to bid a fond food farewell to some treats that left us this year. Choco Taco, a sort of ice cream sandwich is out of here after 40 years. But Klondike said there could be a comeback. So, watch this space. 
 
But McDonald's McRib is gone nationally, at least for a while, despite being a cult favorite. 
 
Chile's original chicken tenders took an exit to simplify the change menu. Burger King's Ch'King got canned because workers found it hard to assemble. It does look a little difficult. 
 
And Coca-Cola got real about Honest Tea ending up -- actually canning it to free up investment resource. Well, I spent a lot of time in the U.S. and I actually haven't eaten many of those so I'll be fine. The sorry if you were a big fan of any of those foods.
