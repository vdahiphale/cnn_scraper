(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BECKY ANDERSON, CNN HOST, CONNECT THE WORLD: You're watching "Connect the World". I'm Becky Anderson in Abu Dhabi, where it is 5 pm in the evening. 
 
 Coming up this hour Israel convenes its war cabinet as it readies itself for Iran to retaliate. Donald Trump is preparing for an unprecedented 
 
 criminal trial after multiple failed attempts to have it delayed.
 
And CNN gets an exclusive look at the Mexican government's efforts to stop illegal immigration into the United States. We begin this hour with this 
 
 region once again facing the threat of war, this time between Iran and Israel. Now most of our regular viewers of this show will know that these 
 
 two countries have been at one another for decades through covert assassinations, proxy strikes and cyber warfare.
 
Right now this hour, we are talking about the possibility of Iranian retaliation against Israel possibly inside Israel in response to last 
 
 week's deadly strike by Israel in Damascus or allegedly so. And that threat is why foreign ministers from London to Riyadh to Canberra have been 
 
 reaching out to Tehran to try to bring the temperature down.
 
Let's join our Nic Robertson who is live for us in Jerusalem. And Nic, the top U.S. Commander for the Middle East Erik Kurilla is in Israel right now 
 
 as we speak. What do you understand to be the thinking?
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: The thinking was to get him here quicker than was originally planned. He was planned to be visiting 
 
 the region. But the decision to bring him here sooner was because of this potential imminent threat posed by Iran saying that it will respond to 
 
 Israel strike on their conduit killing senior IRGC officials on the first of April a little over a week ago now.
 
So the understanding here is and the way that it's being interpreted by the IDF is that this is the United States showing very visibly, the ironclad 
 
 support for Israel in defense of any possible counter move by Iran to that strike in Damascus. Of course, people here are jittery for two reasons.
 
They're concerned about how Iran might strike back and could it be on Israel? And if it were on Israel, how would that be? How big would it be? 
 
 The IDF here says that if Iran struck back in Israel that would show that they were willing to escalate the situation. And of course, there's a 
 
 concern here as well, that Prime Minister Netanyahu has a deepening and growing rift with President Biden.
 
And that puts in people's minds here the question of how much and how deep can Israel be rely on the United States? How much of a response could they 
 
 have? So those are the concerns, and those will be the conversations that are being had? And the question, really on most people's minds is how will 
 
 Iran respond direct into Israel through proxy and to Israel, direct to other of Israel's interests in the region or outside the region or through 
 
 proxy at Israel's interests in the region?
 
None of that is clear. And we hear from different sources, different analysis, but I think the fact that the Prime Minister is calling an 
 
 emergency war cabinet this afternoon to discuss the preparedness and the readiness for the threat from Iran speaks volumes. This comes just right on 
 
 the eve of course, Shabbat calling this very important meeting to test the readiness.
 
ANDERSON: Stay on it Nic, we will be back with you next hour. Thank you. Well for months, Donald Trump's legal team has filed motion after motion 
 
 seeking to delay or dismiss charges in the four criminal cases that he is facing, that strategy finally hitting the wall in New York where the hush 
 
 money trial against the former president begins on Monday.
 
Well, the judge who Trump has repeatedly and publicly bashed says it is expected to last six to eight weeks now ahead of that hearing this 
 
 afternoon in the classified documents case in Florida.
 <br>[09:05:00]
 
The judge in that case who Trump appointed and has praised will consider motions to dismiss obstruction charges against two of Trump's co-
 
 defendants. Katelyn Polantz connecting us from Washington, so let's start with his classified documents case, today Trump's attorney has left his 
 
 legal team. What do we know about his departure? And what are we expecting at the hearing today?
 
KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE REPORTER: The hearing isn't going to be talking about that attorney in particular, his name is Evan 
 
 Corcoran and he was a lead attorney for Donald Trump for much of the investigation before Trump was charged. Eventually, the Justice Department 
 
 forced him to turn over notes and audio recordings he made of himself memorializing what had happened with Donald Trump, as the federal 
 
 government was trying to get national security records back.
 
And this lawyer Evan Corcoran didn't find them all because Trump didn't let him allegedly, find them all hid some from him when he was turning them 
 
 back over. That is important because Evan Corcoran, this lawyer for Donald Trump is going to be very likely a key witness in this case, unless Trump's 
 
 team finds a way to have parts of the obstruction case against Donald Trump cut out of the charges.
 
That is the issue that's going to be talked about today at 2 pm. So it's not necessarily about Evan Corcoran himself, though, he's a key piece of 
 
 the obstruction case. What this 2 pm hearing is about is these co- defendants the man who moved boxes at Donald Trump's alleged direction to try and hide those classified records from his lawyer Evan Corcoran and 
 
 from the federal government.
 
So there's going to be legal arguments around what these two men knew and if how they're charged in the case, if that's enough for them to face these 
 
 criminal charges alongside Donald Trump.
 
ANDERSON: Katelyn, Trump's first criminal trial, of course, is set to begin on Monday and his attempts to delay have ultimately failed. So how is his 
 
 team now preparing for the weeks ahead?
 
POLANTZ: Well, they're a trial team. So every single day, we're going to see them scrapping through this trial, however they can whatever openings 
 
 opportunities they can find for the former president. We're going to see them in court. But what begins on Monday is not the bulk of the trial, like 
 
 you would see on TV, what begins on Monday is jury selection.
 
It's when jurors whose names are going to remain anonymous from public disclosure. We're not going to know who these jurors are, potentially, many 
 
 dozens of potential jurors are going to come to court, they're going to answer questions that the court asked them about how strongly their 
 
 political biases are?
 
Not necessarily how they feel or if they even voted for Donald Trump in the past. That doesn't mean that someone's going to be removed from the jury, 
 
 but they are going to start feeling out if people can set aside their preconceived notions there biases and look at facts and evidence in the 
 
 case.
 
And some of the things people are going to be asked are how engaged they've been in political rallies in fringe political movements in the U.S. both 
 
 right wing and left wing in the past and what their feelings are about Donald Trump being treated in a way where he is now on criminal trial.
 
So all of that process may take days before 12 jurors plus some alternates are seated, but that begins Monday with Donald Trump, a criminal defendant 
 
 seated in court before this jury at the kickoff to the trial.
 
ANDERSON: Important stuff always good to have you. Thank you. Well, embattled U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson set to make an appearance at 
 
 Donald Trump's estate in Florida later today. The visit comes at what is a precarious time for Johnson as he seeks job security within his own 
 
 Republican Party.
 
Now, the pair expected to hold a news conference at Mar-a-Lago. Joining us now from Florida is CNN reporter, Steve Contomo. Steve, what are we 
 
 expecting to hear today?
 
STEVE CONTOMO, CNN REPORTER: Well, on paper Becky, this meeting is supposed to be about election interference and security, which is obviously one of 
 
 Donald Trump's pet infatuations. They are going to produce legislation they say are we believe that is going to combat what they say is a problem of 
 
 illegal immigrants voting in elections.
 
I should point out there's zero evidence of that as a widespread issue. It's already illegal in the United States, however. But Mike Johnson is 
 
 also going there to sort of do what a lot of other Republicans have had to do over the years, which is kiss the ring, get the photo op and prove that 
 
 you are aligned with the former president. And obviously this is coming at a precarious moment in his speakership, as you said.
 <br>[09:10:00]
 
And a lot of the heat is coming from Donald Trump's allies in Congress people like Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene are the ones who are 
 
 giving him so much trouble. And so this is an opportunity for him to show, look, I am aligned with Donald Trump, you should be behind me.
 
Of course, his predecessor Kevin McCarthy was also someone who at times had a very cordial relationship with Donald Trump was aligned with him. And yet 
 
 it was another Trump ally, Matt Gaetz in Congress, who ultimately took down that speaker.
 
ANDERSON: Well, also learning Steve firm, that Trump is pushing for an early debate with President Biden, and apparently he wants to see more 
 
 debates added to the schedule. I mean, Trump's legal schedule is packed. But it does appear that the former president is feeling bullish. What's the 
 
 sense from the Biden side? When should we expect to see these two men go head to head?
 
CONTOMO: Well, the first scheduled debate is about 50 days before the election, and that's actually earlier than they have been in past this is 
 
 set by a Commission on Presidential Debates. It's a bipartisan, non- partisan organization that sets the debate schedule, and they have recognized that voting in the United States, there's a lot of states that 
 
 vote early, a lot of states that vote by mail.
 
And so therefore, they've actually moved some of these debates up. Donald Trump is saying he wants those debates moved up even further. That's what 
 
 his campaign is arguing for. Lately, he's been showing up at some of his rallies with an empty podium, suggesting that he would debate Joe Biden 
 
 anytime, anyplace, anywhere.
 
The Biden campaign isn't getting involved in this. This is something that they said that they will allow the commission to determine and they're not 
 
 going to engage with Trump's posturing on this debate.
 
ANDERSON: Good to have you, sir. Thank you. CNN's exclusive look now at our Mexico is trying to stop illegal immigration into the United States. 
 
 Mexican officials say they have successfully deterred migration by what they say is 10 percent since December, in part, they say because they've 
 
 established new checkpoints and inspection camps at some of the busiest entry points along the border. CNN's David Culver joins us now from 
 
 Tijuana, in Mexico, David.
 
DAVID CULVER, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hey there, Becky. Yeah, we're on the Mexican side of things. And this is where you can kind of see 
 
 the normal Friday morning commute, if you will. These are folks who will go over into the U.S. side using the pedestrian bridge, and then later come 
 
 back in the day.
 
One of the things though, that folks who are the Mexican side have been trying to stress. Officials in particular is that this is also a location 
 
 where they do the CBP one app, so people can register migrants in particular, so that they can then have an appointment with U.S. asylum 
 
 officers and determine whether or not they can enter illegally.
 
Of course, that's the orderly, more secure way to enter. Let me show you the scenes that we saw yesterday that are still playing out, you have large 
 
 groups and this we saw as we were actually with an embed as part of a Mexican migration official campaign to show us around different parts of 
 
 the wall.
 
And you can see large groups that still make their way onto the U.S. side, sometimes there'll be with smugglers and this is increasingly common, who 
 
 will cut portions of the border wall so that they can then enter, that can happen as quickly as a minute, 20 seconds for a large group that will also 
 
 scale using ladders, and they'll still then get to the point where they can be processed.
 
But to your point, Becky, deterring some of this illegal crossing that we have seen over the past several months and more than a year now, it has 
 
 become a focus for Mexican officials in particular, to crack down. And you may be surprised as we were in going around here that some of the toughest, 
 
 I would say patrolling of the border wall is happening on the southern side of the border on the Mexico side.
 
And you'll even see some of the communities and I want to show you this is one neighborhood at private suburban community that now has members of the 
 
 National Guard from the Mexico side patrolling inside the neighborhood. And that's because communities like this similar to on the U.S. side, are 
 
 increasingly frustrated.
 
They're having smugglers come at all hours drop off large groups who will then go through their yard, to their patios, and then crossing to the U.S. 
 
 So now you've got neighborhoods who have petitioned their local officials to say we need help. And that again, is happening on this side of things.
 
The question, Becky, is going to be how long does all this sustained because politics at the highest levels, and both countries who are dealing 
 
 with presidential elections this year are often changing and the dynamic then can change how many resources are poured in to stop some of these 
 
 illegal crossings? As of now the numbers seem to point to this all being rather effective.
 <br>[09:15:00]
 
But should there be shifts in policy at the U.S. side in particular this is where Mexico is often very frustrated then that can change how many 
 
 resources are added to the side. And it's significant, Becky, because as we're going to be showing later in the day two, we were taken to some of 
 
 the more remote parts of the border wall.
 
And these are places that we were at four or five months ago. And we would see large groups at all hours, we even set up cameras through the night 
 
 crossing into the U.S. seemingly without any issue. Well, now what we have seen and this is part of our reporting that we'll be able to roll out over 
 
 the next day or so.
 
Is that Mexican officials have literally deployed to the border? They have built base camps on the parts of the border, where they're really seen as 
 
 more vulnerable, because the infrastructure is not there, either the border wall ends, or it's just an opening that makes it easier for people to walk 
 
 across.
 
And these are in areas that are in rugged and rocky roads that are very difficult to get to yet smugglers have been using those for months, if not 
 
 years, as their way to get people across. Now, Becky, you've got a presence that is incredibly significant. That shows that Mexican officials are not 
 
 only keeping watching patrols, but also in some places they're there 24/7.
 
ANDERSON: Yeah, there's real intent at this point. I mean, it's like you say, I mean, this is such a political issue, both, of course in the U.S. 
 
 where it couldn't be more important in this presidential year and of course, in Mexico itself. It's good to have you, David, it was good to have 
 
 you.
 
And we look forward to that content. And David's reporting, as he said, rolled out here on CNN as we move through the working day today. So look 
 
 out for that, David, thank you. Well, the president and the billionaire can Elon Musk help lift Argentina out of its economic crisis? We'll have a live 
 
 report on Musk's meeting with the Argentine leader coming up, plus.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
STEPHANIE BUSARI, CNN SENIOR EDITOR OF AFRICA (voice-over): Do you believe in your heart that she's alive?
 
YANA GALANG, KIDNAPPED CHIBOK SCHOOLGIRL'S MOTHER: Yes. I believe she's alive. She's my blood and I believe she's alive.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, look back at the mass kidnapping that shocked the world. Revisiting Nigeria's Chibok girls 10 years after so many lives were changed 
 
 forever. That is up next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: You're watching "Connect the World". I'm Becky Anderson for you. 90 minutes past 5 here in the UAE, 90 minutes past 9 on the East Coast of 
 
 America and wherever you are watching you're more than welcome. Fast melting snow and ice cores one of Europe's longest rivers to burst its 
 
 banks triggering catastrophic flooding in parts of Russia and Kazakhstan.
 <br>[09:20:00]
 
Flooding is forced more than 100,000 people to leave their homes and the waters there are still rising. Joining me now is CNN Meteorologist Derek 
 
 Van Dam. How's it looking going forward because these images are, are very concerning?
 
DEREK VAN DAM, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Yeah, they're astounding. In fact, Becky, we're just getting word from authorities on the ground in Orenburg, Russia, 
 
 that the peak flooding is occurring right now. The Ural River actually in Orenburg topped off at 11.37 meters or roughly 37 feet today.
 
And is expected to stay steady over the next coming days and then start to slowly recede as the water moves further and further downstream towards the 
 
 Caspian Sea. Let's give you a little bit of a geographical reference point. Here's Kazakhstan and Russia to the north. And here's your Ural River.
 
It's the Ural Mountains that were the problem. We had a flip of the switch and seasons we went from winter and almost instantaneously to a very warm 
 
 spring where temperatures topped 17, 18 degrees Celsius. And of course, when you get that type of warmth and that type of speed of warming, we get 
 
 a rapid snow melt and that snow melt trickles down into the surrounding rivers streams and estuaries as well eventually overwhelming some of the 
 
 local dams as well.
 
This is a look at Orenburg, Russia, just look at the communities that have been completely inundated by water further downstream across Kazakhstan 
 
 impacted by this flooding as well. But what a stark difference between some of these communities just lining the coastal areas in extreme Southern 
 
 Russia and we just talk about how warm has actually been.
 
These are more like late spring temperatures for this region. So to see them pop up this quickly is very concerning. And we don't see any real 
 
 cooling trend in this forecast to help slow the snow melt anytime soon, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Good to have you. Thank you.
 
DAM: Ok.
 
ANDERSON: Let's get you up to speed on some of the other stories that are on our radar right now. And Russian drone attacks in Southern Ukraine 
 
 overnight. Damaged energy facility there although Ukraine says it shot down nearly all the drones official say debris from one of them started a fire 
 
 at the facility there in the region.
 
No casualties or injuries have been reported. And a coup and a civil war have translated into dire economic consequences for the people of Myanmar. 
 
 That is the finding of a new U.N. report, which says the nation's middle class is quote, literally disappearing, with millions dragged into poverty 
 
 in the past few years.
 
So this happening in an economy that was seen as one of the most promising in Southeast Asia less than 10 years ago. Well, it's been nearly 10 years 
 
 since a mass school kidnapping stung the world in April of 2014. Boko Haram militants stormed a school in Chibok in Nigeria snatching nearly 300 
 
 students and sparking a global cry to bring back our girls.
 
My colleague Stephanie Busari and CNN, As Equals team make the journey to Chibok to meet some who managed to escape and the families of those who are 
 
 still missing.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
STEPHANIE BUSARI, CNN SENIOR EDITOR OF AFRICA (voice-over): The road to Chibok North Eastern Nigeria, 10 years on from the kidnapping of nearly 300 
 
 schoolgirls. We've come to meet some of the girls who were taken that night in April 2014. And see how the threat of abduction still shapes children's 
 
 lives here.
 
HAUWA ISHAYA, FORMER CHIBOK SCHOOLGIRL KIDNAPPED BY BOKO HARAM: They came from this way.
 
BUSARI: And they will many cards many --
 
ISHAYA: Yes, they had plenty and --
 
BUSARI (voice-over): Hauwa was just 16 when she was snatched from her boarding school late at night by Boko Haram militants.
 
ISHAYA: They burned the hall for writing exams.
 
BUSARI: So they burned the hall where you were supposed to write your exams.
 
ISHAYA: Yeah.
 
BUSARI: They were really against education that much.
 
BUSARI (voice-over): The Islamist group took more than 270 girls into the vast Sambisa Forest booth some managed to escape. Amina now 27 was also 
 
 abducted that night, told by Boko Haram leaders that marriage was the only way to avoid repeated abuse by fighters in the camp. 
 
AMINA ALI, FORMER CHIBOK SCHOOLGIRL KIDNAPPED BY BOKO HARAM (ph): They just say they will take us as a slave, and then any time he wants to sleep with 
 
 you, he will sleep with you. And then when he is tired of you, he will hand over to someone else. And so, I just think, I better agree to get married 
 
 to the one person.
 
BUSARI (voice-over): She was the first of the Chibok girls to escape after being held in a forest. Immersion with her Boko Haram husband also fled the 
 
 group and the young baby after two years. Now eight years old Amina's daughter has faced stigma for being the child of a Boko Haram fighter.
 <br>[09:25:00]
 
School kidnappings a shadow that hanging over the education system in Northern Nigeria with an estimated 1700 children abducted from school in 
 
 the past decade, according to Amnesty International, just last month, more than 100 students, some as young as eight were taken by armed men who 
 
 stormed their school in Kuriga, Kaduna province.
 
In recent years, criminal gangs have created a kidnapping for ransom industry, spanning across the northwest of the country, which successive 
 
 governments have struggled to grapple with.
 
OBY EZEKWESILI, CO-FOUNDER OF BRING BACK OUR GIRLS: The failure of governance around the Chibok girls issue led to an industry of abduction in 
 
 society that has scant regard for human life.
 
BUSARI (voice-over): Many Nigerian mothers are now too scared to send them to school.
 
EZEKWESILI: Guess what Chibok girls tragedy did? It made the mothers feel guilty, in their mind that what they did by arguing for education for their 
 
 daughter was to say, pay with your life in order to be educated.
 
BUSARI (voice-over): Fewer than 50 percent of Nigerian girls attend school at a basic education level, according to a UNICEF report, in a country with 
 
 5 percent of the world's children by 2013. The United Nations has said quote, what happens to children in Nigeria matters significantly to 
 
 regional and global development.
 
Back in Chibok for many mothers, the pain continues a decade on, Yana's daughter Rifkatu who was among the Chibok girls stolen from school and 
 
 remains missing along with 81 others.
 
BUSARI: Do you believe in your heart that she's alive?
 
GALANG: Yes. I believe she's alive. She's my blood and I believe she's alive.
 
BUSARI (voice-over): She's kept her daughter's clothes ready for when she returns.
 
GALANG: This is how we keep it. We always wash the cloths, fold it and then keep it for almost 10 years now.
 
BUSARI (voice-over): Never given up hope. Despite the agony she and so many parents in Nigeria have to endure. Stephanie Busari CNN, Chibok, Nigeria.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON: And that report is part of CNN's ongoing As Equals series on gender inequality, head to our website to find more of their reporting. 
 
 Well coming up the Argentine President's U.S. tour what Javier Milei's hoping to accomplish for his country and what is a big meeting going on 
 
 today? More on that is after this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:30:00]
 
ANDERSON: Well, they are out of the gate in New York. That is the opening of the trading day on Wall Street. I'm Becky Anderson. You're watching 
 
 "Connect the World". 9:30 in the morning there and not exactly a happy Friday for Wall Street. U.S. banks have kicked off the corporate earnings 
 
 parade and JP Morgan Chase, saying its key net interest income could be a little short of what Wall Street's analysts are expecting in 2024.
 
Well, that is the beginning of the trading day in the U.S. This is Europe and stocks having a bit more of a mixed day in Europe. UK shares looking 
 
 especially upbeat as Middle East tensions push commodity prices higher and that boosts miners and oil groups who are listed in the FTSE Index. Well, 
 
 if your government needs money why not turn to one of the biggest, richest people in the world? 
 
Right now Argentina's President is scheduled to be meeting with Elon Musk at Tesla Headquarters in Texas. Javier Milei is said to be on a mission to 
 
 find new investments as his government tries to turn around its struggling economy? 
 
Well, the two have reportedly spoken on the phone and exchanged pleasantries in social media but this is their first time meeting in 
 
 purpose. CNN's Rafael Romo following Mr. Milei's visit and he joins us now. 
 
These two men have developed -- develop quite the bromance over their Well, let's call it anti-establishment views. Both men have a lot to gain though 
 
 from this relationship. Let's be quite clear about this. Let's start with Milei who is facing of course a lot of unrest at home. What's he got to 
 
 gain out of this?
 
RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, they both have a lot to gain Becky, especially because Argentina. As we have been reporting its economy is in 
 
 really bad shape. And on the other hand, at least two of the companies of Musk, Elon Musk have a lot to gain because of Argentinian lithium. 
 
And also because they just got a license to be able to operate Starlink one of Musk companies and as you describe it, it's been a bromance for a while 
 
 now going on and Argentinian President Javier Milei and Tesla Mogul Elon Musk have been saying nice thing is about each other on social media for 
 
 months. 
 
Just to give you an idea Becky, back in November, the very same day that the libertarian relay won the second round of his country's presidential 
 
 election Musk wrote on his very own X platform that quote, prosperity is ahead for Argentina. Then on December 5th, just five days before being 
 
 sworn in Milei wrote a message to Musk again on X saying -- Elon, we need to talk.
 
This was in response to Elon Musk posting a video X of a speech by Milei where he talks about how he opposes the idea of giving priority to equality 
 
 over liberty? Both leaders are libertarian often favor right wing ideas and are against an overreaching government.
 
This bromance goes beyond having those things in common as we discussed at the beginning in February, the government of Argentina granted access to 
 
 SpaceX to offer Starlink satellite internet services after President Milei got rid of regulations that would have prevented Musk's aerospace company 
 
 to do so. 
 
And according to global data, Argentina is the world's third largest producer of lithium, a crucial metal as you know for the production of 
 
 rechargeable batteries like the ones used in cars made by Elon Musk's Tesla, more than half of the lithium imported to the United States comes 
 
 from Argentina, according to a report by the U.S. government.
 
And Milei's communications team told CNN in Espanol that liberty advances this is the president's political coalition values and is grateful for Musk 
 
 kindness and the reality is that as we were discussing Becky Milei needs a lot of help and as many friends as he can get to rebuild his country's 
 
 battered economy and has made stamping out hyperinflation his top priority.
 
Listen to this Becky year on year inflation in Argentina topped 211 percent in December, the highest level in more than three decades. So again, this 
 
 meeting today very important for both men Becky back to you.
 <br>[09:35:00]
 
ANDERSON: That's fascinating, isn't it? This battered economy which could just be somewhat rescued by that critical element that goes in to batteries 
 
 that power this EV sort of era this electric vehicle ear. You can understand why it is in your reporting there. Why it is that these two men 
 
 want to talk thank you. Well another business use Taylor Swift back on TikTok.
 
Superstar's music back on the social media platform a week before the release of her new album, Universal Music Group called Various Artists 
 
 Songs from TikTok in January over a royalties dispute now is not clear what led to the return of Swift music but other artists at Universal are still 
 
 not listed on the platform. 
 
Swift's 11th album -- tortured poets department will be released on April the 19th. I want to get you some sports news just ahead. It is barely 
 
 played competitive golf this year but Tiger Woods is on the course at the Masters for what is an extra-long day. Why we will explain up next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: I'm Becky Anderson. You're watching "Connect the World" here on CNN. It is a risk -- we saw that it is a rescue mission. That sounds like 
 
 it's straight out of a movie. Three fishermen were left with very few options when their boat sank, leaving them stranded on a tiny remote island 
 
 in the Pacific Ocean with no way home and a radio that run out of battery. 
 
How did they attract attention after surviving more than a week on coconuts and fresh well water? Well, they used palm fronds to spell out the world 
 
 would help on the white sand beach. A coast guard plane spotted the sign and plot twist. 
 
One of the rescuers turned out to be a relative of the castaways now it's an inside look at the most powerful telescope ever built. The next 
 
 installment of CNN's the whole story explores the James Webb telescope and how it is helping shape what we know about the universe. 
 
Remember this image showing the Carina Nebula located in the Carina Sagittarius arm of the Milky Way Galaxy. It would take Keats or Wordsworth 
 
 to do justice to his watch beauty with CNN's Kristen Fisher is asking good questions about how NASA's Webb telescope is unlocking?
 <br>[09:40:00]
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KRISTEN FISHER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): James Webb Space Telescope, unprecedented in science and scale.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is effectively the best time machine that we've ever created.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: James Webb is revealing the cosmic story.

Well, the weather has cleared and round two of the Masters is now underway at Augusta National Golf Club in Georgia. But not before some of the 
 
 players who start got pushed back yesterday had to finish the opening round. And that included Tiger Woods. Amanda Davies joins me now with more. 
 
 Amanda?
 
AMANDA DAVIES, CNN WORL SPORT: We have to feel for Tiger Woods Becky he had been talking in the run up to this Masters about the pain he feels with 
 
 basically every shot once he's got past the tee shots on the course. And what the delay on the opening day meant is that today Friday, which should 
 
 be second round day he will have to play 23 holes. To put that into context he's only played 24 competitive holes in the entirety of the start of this 
 
 year.
 
ANDERSON: Wow.
 
DAVIES: He has just finished the remainder of his first rounds that he picked up on the 13th. And I can tell you he posted a one over par rounds 
 
 of 73. So he's eight shots off the pace as things stand but has only got half an hour before he is back out on the course for the start of round 
 
 two. It is Bryson DeChambeau leading the way as things stand. We're heading live to Augusta to get all the latest in just a couple of minutes in "World 
 
 Sports".
 
ANDERSON: There's so much drama there, good stuff. Thank you and that is "World Sports" and we are back top of the hour.
