LAILA HARRAK, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome to all of our viewers watching from around the world. I'm Laila Harrak. Ahead on CNN Newsroom. Ukraine is bracing for what could be a long cold winter if Russia continues to target its energy system. Residents in one city are handling the cold temperatures with limited power.
 
Plus, lava from the world's largest active volcano is inching closer to a main highway. We'll speak live with Hawaii's governor on the latest.
 
And, England fans are ecstatic after the three lions topple Senegal, setting up a showdown in the quarterfinals with the defending World Cup champs France.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Live from CNN Center. This is CNN Newsroom with Laila Harrak.
 
HARRAK: We begin in Ukraine where authorities say the eastern city of Bakhmut has become the number one target of Russian forces. As part of the Donetsk region, the area has been the focus of escalating attacks. A spokesperson for Ukraine's eastern forces says the city's defense is holding Russian forces back from other important strongholds.
 
Meanwhile, Ukrainian official says shelling in Kherson region killed at least one person over the weekend. Police say the area is littered with mines, trip wires and other dangerous objects left by Russian troops.
 
The Ukrainian say they found more than 4,000 explosive devices. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says no matter how many weapons Russia has Ukraine's motivation to win the war is stronger.

VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Russia still has missiles and an advantage in artillery. Yes, but we have something that the occupier does not have and will not have. We defend our home. And that gives us the strongest motivation possible. We fight for freedom, and that always multiplies any force.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK: Well, during his nightly address, President Zelenskyy called on Ukrainians to come together to endure the winter months, no matter how hard they may be. He said Russian forces will use winter as a weapon. CNN's Will Ripley reports now from Bucha. And how a city terrorized by Russia is preparing to survive the cold.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)
 
WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): In Ukraine, winter is coming. In the capital Kyiv, the foreign minister warns snow won't be the only thing falling from the skies.
 
DMYTRO KULEBA, MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF UKRAINE: We are anticipating another massive missile attack by Russia. And the goal of this attack is to bring total destruction to our energy system.
 
RIPLEY: Crews are racing to restore power. These tents set up by the government a badly needed break from the bitter cold. At this fast food place, braving below zero temperatures at the outdoor grill keeps the doors open when the lights are off.
 
Some customers said they only want to come when there's no power because the food tastes so much better. We're just Ukrainians, she says, that's our secret ingredient.
 
Another secret for surviving dark times, candles, a good cry, and prayer.
 
RIPLEY (on camera): When you come here, what do you pray for?
 
RIPLEY (voiceover): Should we pray for peace, for the war to be over, she says, describing the hardship of life without electricity. But then I come here and remember how much time we spent hiding in basements.
 
Hiding from Russian soldiers who occupied and terrorize their town. Bucha, the site of what Ukraine calls unspeakable war crimes.
 
RIPLEY (on camera): If you didn't know what happened here, this could be any church and any quiet keeps suburb until you look closer. And notice the bullet holes and this cross marking a mass grave for more than 100 men, women and two children. 
 <br>[01:05:01]
 
Like five of Vira Goychuck's neighbors.
 
VIRA GOYCHUK, BUCHA DISTRICT RESIDENT: It was the cluster bomb.
 
RIPLEY: A cluster bomb.
 
GOYCHUK: A cluster bomb. RIPLEY (voiceover): Bullet holes in her children's bedroom windows. After living through the hell of the Russian occupation, she can handle living without power.
 
GOYCHUK: And what is the real problem is where it's not electricity. We don't have any connection. So I have kids and if something wrong, I cannot even call to the hospital and call emergency.
 
RIPLEY: She tells me when the power goes out, she loses cell phone service and internet. But then --
 
GOYCHUK: Oh my god, this miracle.
 
RIPLEY: Is that the lights coming on?
 
GOYCHUK: Yes. Yes.
 
RIPLEY: The first place she goes the kitchen.
 
RIPLEY (on camera): Coffee. That's your number one priority.
 
GOYCHUK: Yes. My number one.
 
RIPLEY (voiceover): She's grateful for the little things in life.
 
GOYCHUK: It's a moment of happiness.
 
RIPLEY: Grateful just to be alive.
 
GOYCHUK: That's it.
 
RIPLEY: Will Ripley, CNN, Bucha, Ukraine.

HARRAK: U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken also believes Russia's President plans to use winter to his advantage. Speaking with CNN on Sunday, he mentioned alternative measures the U.S. is exploring to disrupt the Russian agenda.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: What he's doing is trying to weaponize winter, turn out the lights, turn off the heat. Put the Ukrainian people into darkness and cold just as they head into the winter months. This is indeed barbaric. We're working with Congress right now on legislation that would help us get around some of the challenges of using the state sponsor of terrorism designation, which as you said, has some unintended consequences. We're finding -- we're working with Congress on a way forward to get to the same place.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK: But despite Russia's brazen invasion, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz says dialogue with Russian President Vladimir Putin must continue. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
OLAF SCHOLZ, GERMAN CHANCELLOR (through translator): I have spoken to him repeatedly since then, because I'm firmly convinced that it is a grave mistake if despite all the differences, and this is after all, a small world for huge differences we no longer talk to each other at all.
 
However, we do so without any illusions because they are always long conversations because all the public statements we hear to justify this war are repeated there. The point has to always be made very clearly, and it has to be addressed with terrible destruction the Russian missiles caused to the energy infrastructure in Ukraine as a whole.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK: Over the weekend, more than 300,000 tons of agricultural products have left ports in Odesa, Ukraine. This according to Ukrainian officials who say they were bound for countries in Europe, Asia and Africa.
 
Earlier this year, multiple countries dependent on Ukrainian grain experienced extreme food shortages, as Russian forces prevented international shipments. But through the grain from Ukraine program, officials say more than 13 million tons of Ukrainian food have been distributed.
 
The European Union's ban on Russian oil imports shipped by sea is now coming into effect as Western nations tried to deprive the Kremlin of revenue, and that the war in Ukraine. Also taking effect on Monday, a price cap on Russian oil.
 
The EU G7 nations and Australia agreed Friday to impose a price cap of $60 a barrel on oil shipped to other countries that have not adopted an embargo. It's another step to put pressure on Russia without adding stress on the global economy by further reducing the supply of energy.
 
Russia is reacting with its deputy prime minister saying the country will not export oil to countries that impose price caps. We're also hearing from Ukraine's president who called the oil price cap a weak position that won't do enough to hurt the Russian economy.
 
For more I want to bring in Charles Lichfield, the deputy director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomic Center, and he joins me now from Washington, DC.
 
Good day, sir. A price cap on Russian oil now goes into effect on Monday. There's been a lot of disagreement about where to set that cap is $60 low enough to hurt Russia economically without hurting oil consumers.
 
CHARLES LICHFIELD, DEPUTY DIRECTOR, ATLANTIC COUNCIL'S GEOECONOMICS CENTER: Well, it's not as low as some of the countries that are tend to be more hawkish on Russia hoped it would be. But I think the point is that Russia is already selling at a discount. And this price cap, if it works, will lock in that discount. Let's imagine that price all prices globally go up. Russia is selling at a 20 percent or $20 discount to global prices. But if prices were to go up, Russia will be selling for more. If this price cap works, it will stay at 60.
 
HARRAK: Now also on Monday there is the US partial embargo banning the import of Russian oil entering through tankers, not pipelines. So how significant will the impact that'd be on Russia and on Europe?
 <br>[01:10:03]
 
LICHFIELD: Well, Europe has already been looking for alternative sources of supply. And it's done slightly better than people thought it would. And some of the tension we saw in the market earlier this year is no longer there.
 
For Russia, it means looking for new buyers. And those buyers are driving a hard bargain. They mainly India is the partner of Russia's, that has increased his purchases the most. And is not particularly interested in criticism from Western governments and say that India shouldn't do this. But that doesn't mean that it isn't driving a hard bargain.
 
So just to put it in, from a Russian perspective, they are in deficit this year. They won't take in as much money as they will be spending despite record export income. And next year, the outlook is much more gloomy than that.
 
HARRAK: What impact will all these measures have on the global oil markets and the global economy?
 
LICHFIELD: So on global oil markets, there was a fear that this price cap would be extremely complicated and add a sort of extra layer of complexity to transactions. For the moment, markets seem to be in reassured the guidance has been clear enough. We'll see. Demand for oil, I think remaining at similar levels.
 
And so the impact on sort of inflation will probably level off over the next coming this year. That's what most people think. But we do have quite a high -- quite a high level in the market. And that's difficult for consumers in the US and the EU.
 
HARRAK: Could we see disruptions?
 
LICHFIELD: I don't think so. So the disruptions that we are hearing about or the fear disruptions in the EU, in France, there's talk of even two-hour blackouts, that's more to do with the overall picture. And powering energy, powering electricity into homes. It's not really just to do with oil.
 
But the outlook, I think for this winter isn't as bad as people said this summer, that you will remember the big spikes in forward prices this summer. They're no longer really there. Because people have reduced consumption, governments have played some role in incentivizing people to do that. So while prices are extremely high, and we do have an inflationary crisis, I don't think we're looking at blackouts this winter. HARRAK: And on top of all of these developments, OPEC has now decided to maintain the reduced output levels that they set two months ago, and move as you can recall that that absolutely incensed the Biden administration at the time, they're sticking with it. What's the objective here? What's the thinking?
 
LICHFIELD: Well, I'm not a specialist of OPEC. And I think it's quite difficult to interpret what they want to do, but they do want to lock in a price that works for them. And they're not particularly interested in as I was saying earlier. The Indians aren't interested when Western governments tell them they should sort of get with a plan and help them -- help them help Ukraine win. This sort of criticism doesn't really work very well in OPEC. They want to the price levels be at a level that suits them, not one that suits the objectives of the United States government.
 
HARRAK: Just want to have a final thought from you. The Kremlin has weaponized energy. Europe, as you pointed out, is bracing for a couple of very difficult winter months, many are pointing to the month of February as your stress test. From an energy perspective, does Europe have sufficient energy supplies? And can it withstand this level of pressure in the long term?
 
LICHFIELD: So far, the winter has been much warmer than it could have been. So Europe has high levels of gas supplies, emergency supplies. There is still an issue with power generation depends on the country. But for instance, in France, a lot of the nuclear fleet is offline. And that's making things quite difficult.
 
But I think the outlook the consensus is that it won't be blackouts. It will simply be more expensive for consumers. And even more expensive for governments, governments have stepped in to put a ceiling on price increases, but that means more deficit spending for many European governments. I don't think there'll be blackouts.
 
HARRAK: Charles Lichfield, thank you so much for joining us. Greatly appreciate it.
 
An estimated 150 pro-Russia demonstrators took to the streets of the German city of Cologne, demanding an end to arms exports to Ukraine and a ban of NATO. They were met with fierce opposition from counter protesters.
 
The protests happened two days after German Chancellor Olaf Scholz urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to find a solution to the Ukraine conflict. A police spokesman said the protest was organized by a private individual.
 
Now nearly three months into the protests that have rocked Iran, a pro-reform outlet says an Iranian official has announced a review of the hijab law that requires women to cover their heads.
 <br>[01:15:01]
 
The announcement likely aimed at quieting anti-government demonstrations that have swept Iran since the death of Mahsa Amini in mid-September. The reform group quotes the Attorney General, saying Iran's parliament and judiciary are reviewing the law which came into effect after the Islamic Revolution in 1979. He's also quoted as saying Iran has abolished its so called morality police tasked with enforcing the dress code. However, Iranian state media insists the Interior Ministry controls that force, not the judiciary.
 
Well, even if the attorney general's remarks are confirmed, it's unclear what might change and there are no guarantees that protests would stop.
 
Earlier I spoke to journalists Negar Mortazavi about these reports of abolishing Iran's morality police and reviewing the hijab law. She has been covering Iranian affairs for over a decade and explains the complex dynamics at play.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
NEGAR MORTAZAVI, JOURNALIST: What one lawyer was saying is that the morale police has become so notorious and so a such a bad name that no official is willing to take responsibility for it essentially this official claiming that it has been disbanded.
 
But what's important is that the law of the mandatory hijab, which goes back to early 1980s, on paper has not changed, and that the enforcement of this law has continued even over the past three months in some shape or form. But yet, women and these protesters on the street have been able to push back the limits that have already been pushed back in the past four decades. And we see a lot of images, photos, videos of women in public places walking around without the hit job much more than what we'd seen before September of this year.
 
So in a way, there has been a big leap with this push by the protesters in the society but how sustainable that's going to be long term. It's still unclear because it goes back to how this enforcement of this law that's still on paper going to be stopped or change or is it just going to come back under a different brand or a different name or in different methods.

HARRAK: Iranian American journalist at Negar Mortazavi speaking with me earlier. Still ahead, Hawaii's Mauna Loa volcano is putting on a nonstop show. I'll speak to the governor of the states and discuss the challenges his government faces due to this historic eruption. Plus, people in Indonesia are getting away from an erupting volcano any way they can. We'll have the latest.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HARRAK: The world's largest active volcano continues to put on a show on Hawaii's Big Island. The U.S. Geological Survey said on Sunday the lava from Mauna Loa is about two miles away from the islands main highway and getting closer each day.
 <br>[01:20:07] Visitors are flocking to the island to watch the magnificent view. Mauna Loa last erupted in 1984. Officials say they can't say how long this latest eruption will last.
 
And joining me now to discuss the challenges posed by this historic eruption is Hawaii Governor David Ige. Sir, thank you very much for joining us at this busy time, I imagine for you watching the largest active volcano in the world erupting for the first time in nearly four decades.
 
I mean, just look at the images. It is stunning to look at, but I imagine somewhat terrifying as well. What are you most concerned about right now?
 
DAVID IGE, HAWAII GOVERNOR: Certainly, we are concerned about the lava and about visitors and residents really getting too close to be safe. So, we continue to encourage residents and visitors to stay tuned to Hawaii County Civil Defense, they have set up a viewing area. And certainly if for those who want to see the volcano, we are encouraging them to listen to instructions and cooperate with everyone.
 
HARRAK: So in terms of what do you you're telling residents and those in the area that are there for the sightseeing? Should everyone be prepared for potentially unpredictable changes?
 
IGE: Certainly, the eruption could stop at any time, you know, it could stop as we speak. It is in a very slow moving at this point, it's moving -- the front is moving out about 40 to 50 feet per hour. So it can start up again really quickly or it can stop.
 
And what we encourage everyone is just to stay tuned Hawaii to -- Hawaii County Civil Defense, they have a map that shows exactly which flows are active. And for those who have respiratory challenges, we continue to tell them that wearing a mask will be helpful. Sometimes the harmful gases are not and -- cannot be seen. But certainly that's a challenge for those who have respiratory illnesses.
 
HARRAK: Now, Mr. Governor, as you point out, lava is slowly moving closer to the Big Island's main highway. Will you try to stop it? Is it possible to redirect flows? Would that be something that you're actively considering with your team?
 
IGE: You know, we have considered that in the past. And all of the best recommendations we follow is that it is impossible to predict exactly where the flow will go. And there hasn't been a whole lot of success with trying to divert a lava flow.
 
You know, Mother Nature is powerful, and it will be going where it chooses. And so we just monitor where the lava flow is and continue to keep in communications with the residents and visitors.
 
HARRAK: And Mr. Governor, what would the fallout be if lava from Mauna Loa slides across this key road and blocks passage?
 
IGE: You know, we are working on contingency plans as we speak. You know, we are monitoring the direction of the lava flow. We are identifying potential bypass routes that could be used if the lava should inundate Daniel K. Inouye highway.
 
In the past, we have done bypass roads to allow traffic to clearly it would have tremendous impact on just the volume of traffic that can safely travel in that area. But we do we know that we need to be prepared. And it is such a major highway that we know that we'll come up with some way to provide at least some connectivity unless the pace of the lava and the pace of the flow really picks up.
 
HARRAK: And I wanted to ask you as well, I mean, it's a very, very delicate balancing act that you have to strike there. I mean, how do you balance tensions between public hazard and those who are still coming to see something so compelling and so extraordinary?
 
IGE: You know, we encouraged to ask everyone to tune in to Hawaii Civil Defense and the USGS site. They are posting updates multiple times a day and that's the best information we have.
 <br>[01:25:01]
 
We do have air quality monitoring sites all around Hawaii Island. And certainly if someone is interested in going to the viewing, we would encourage them to look at those monitors. They continue to be green. And we haven't tested any high levels of very dangerous gases. But things can change very quickly. And so we encourage people to stay connected.
 
HARRAK: And my final question to you, Mr. Governor, what are you able to draw from experience the island has had some harrowing volcanic events, and especially thinking of the 2018 eruption that applies to this event, if at all.
 
IGE: You know, we continue to be prepared. I've issued an emergency proclamation and we are activating the National Guard here in the islands to help with planning for bypass roads and other activities that would be necessary. Should the lava flow covered Daniel K. Inouye highway. We also are activating guard to help with traffic and crowd control. You know, we want to be pretty prepared and proactive so that we can keep our community and the visitors safe.
 
HARRAK: Governor David Ige of Hawaii, sir, thank you very much for your time and all the best.
 
IGE: Thank you.
 
HARRAK: And for the latest on the eruption, let's go to CNN meteorologist Britley Ritz. Britley, good to see you. I mean, these images behind you. They're so mesmerizing,
 
BRITLEY RITZ, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Aren't they just beautiful, Laila. And the problem is it's not beautiful. It's extremely dangerous, not just what's happening on the ground. But what's about to happen in the air. And what's already happening.
 
Air quality going to suffer here in the upcoming days, especially as the winds start to switch direction, which is looking at yes, very beautiful images, but dangerous, as you see the vog or the volcanic smog getting pushed up into the air. And with that they're very small particles of that sulfur dioxide mixing in with oxygen.
 
So these are so small, it's smaller than a tip of human hair, we're talking about 2.5 microns. And when that gets sucked up into our noses, and right up into our lungs. Right now we have the trade winds taking place more of that easterly flow due to high pressure. But as soon as the next front comes into play, which it will hear in the upcoming day or two, our winds start to switch direction.
 
So you'll see that high pushing that east wind onto the main island. But we're watching the front slide down toward us with that brings rain. So yes, it will kind of lower the threat for those particles. But the problem now is the winds shift. So we'll get more of that southerly flow as the front starts to pass. And with that will come more of these green dots turning yellow and orange, so moderate to sensitive groups and into more of a heavily populated area.
 
So we'll have to watch that for respiratory problems such as asthma. So those of us who are a little bit older or even younger, for that sense, we'll have to wear the masks, just as the governor or the mayor was saying, and we need to make sure that we're taking care of ourselves if we can just kind of stay indoors.
 
Not only that, but we're watching the fissures and these streams of lava flow start to take place and spread out. We were talking about how it's coming close to one of the main highways, folks that's just 2.4 miles from the main highway. So we'll have to watch these very closely as they start to spread out. Of course we'll have to figure out what to do when it comes down to that main interstate or highway. Laila.
 
HARRAK: Britley Ritz, thank you so much. Another erupting volcano this one in Indonesia has forced nearly 2,000 people to evacuate. CNN's Allison Chinchar has more on the desperate flight to safety in East Java.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)
 
ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST (voiceover): ash fills the skies in Indonesia, forming a thick caustic cloud over Mount Semeru on the island of Java. Video from the country's Ministry of Environment and Forestry captured the explosive eruption on Saturday. A burst of ash shooting 15 kilometers into the sky.
 
A sign for people living in the volcano shadow it's time to go.
 
This man escaping on the motorbike. The ash taking on his face. He says he doesn't know where he's going just somewhere out of the volcanoes reach. Authority say nearly 2,000 people have been evacuated from the slopes of the volcano, which is located about 800 kilometers south east of Jakarta.
 
The roads in the area packed with vehicles rushing to outrun the volcanic ash that is still raining down. Emergency workers are directing people out of the danger zone handing out masks and urging them to go to shelters. INDAH AMPERAWATI MASDAR, LUMAJANG DISTRICT DEPUTY (through translator): We have readied some nearby schools and village halls. We will prepare them until the observatory post declares it's safe.
 <br>[01:29:50] 
 
CHINCHAR: The damage already done to some areas. Rooftops are singed and the ground is covered with smoldering soot. Authorities are telling people to stay at least 8 kilometers away from the eruption center. But there are fears the hot ash could drift further. 
 
So far, many people are heeding the warnings. A lesson learned last year when more than 50 people were killed in a previous eruption and thousands were forced from their homes.

HARRAK: Cities in China are easing some COVID restrictions, but zero COVID is not going away just yet. The latest from Beijing ahead on CNN NEWSROOM.
 
And Sunday's matches in the round of 16 put two powerhouses on a collision course at the FIFA World Cup. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HARRAK: Welcome back to all of our viewers around the world. I'm Laila Harrak and you're watching CNN NEWSROOM. 
 
Poland is out of the World Cup, following a 3 to 1 loss to defending champions France. 
 
And you can see the French team celebrating in the locker room after another dominating performance. But the party did not stop there. 
 
Back in London, England fans were thrilled by their biggest victory of the knockout round since 2002. As England defeated Senegal 3-0. 
 
Well for a recap of Sunday's World Cup drama, "CNN WORLD SPORT's" Patrick Snell has the highlights. 
 
PATRICK SNELL, CNN WORLD SPORT ANCHOR: Only two countries ever in World Cup history have successfully defended their title. Italy in 1938 and Brazil in 1962. Will France in 2022 become the third? If the reigning world champs are to have any chance to do so, they'll have to get by England first in the quarterfinals. 
 
The Three Lions overcoming a shaky start on Sunday against African champion Senegal to take the lead shortly before half time. So Jordan Henderson in the last 16 battle after he was superbly set up by the outstanding young talent that is (INAUDIBLE) Dortmund's Jude Bellingham. 
 <br>[01:34:55] SNELL: And it was not too long before England's skipper Harry Kane finally opened his account at this World Cup with a crisp finish for 2-0. Kane now just one behind Wayne Rooney's (ph) all-time record mark of 53 England goals. 
 
Then just shy of the hour mark, the English making the game safe. It is Bukayo Saka making no mistake for this country's third, Edward Mundy well beaten. England comfortable 3-0 winners in the end. 
 
Early on Sunday, defending champs France booking their place in the last eight after beating Poland 3-1. They blew ahead as 36-year-old Olivier Giroud breaks the deadlock for the French just before the halftime break. That was his 52nd goal for his country. 
 
And the AC Milan man now becoming France's all-time leading goal scorer, surpassing the great Gerry Henry. 
 
Then just past the 70 minute mark. It is the prolific Kylian Mbappe making the game safe when they blew a fourth of the tournament for the PST (ph0 superstar. At that point he also scored in the 2018 final in Russia against Croatia. 
 
And then before the end, how about this? Moments of brilliance for his fifth now, a tournament high fifth. 3-1 the final. 
 
Robert Lewandowski tucking away a penalty for the poles right at the end. France get the job done though. They advance to the quarterfinals, they face England next. 
 
As far as the race for the coveted Golden Boot is concerned. Mbappe himself during a power of good by taking his tally to five for this World Cup. That is too clear of his challenges with plenty of players on three including his French teammate Giroud and a certain Lionel Messi as well. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KYLIAN MBAPPE, FRENCH NATIONAL SOCCER TEAM: The only objective for me is to win the World Cup. Now to win the next game quarterfinals is the most important thing. 
 
And that is what I dream. The only thing I dream is this and for that I came here. I came to win this World Cup. I did not come here to win the Golden Ball, the Golden Boot. If I win it, of course I'm going to be happy. 
 
But that is not why I'm here. I'm here to win and I'm here to help the French national team. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SNELL: A mouthwatering (INAUDIBLE) as Mbappe and Kane go head to head in the quarterfinals next weekend. But have a look ahead to the last 16 action in the World Cup on Monday as well. 
 
We've got five-time champs Brazil taking on South Korea with Neymar back and available for selection. The 30-year-old apparently having recovered from the ankle injury he suffered in Brazil's opening match. 
 
But for now I'm going to send it right back to you. 
 
HARRAK: And one more quick look at what is on tap today in Qatar. First, Japan takes on 2018 runner-up Croatia and later, number one ranked B Brazil faces South Korea. 
 
The angry protests against China's harsh zero COVID policies appear to be getting results. Multiple cities eased some restrictions over the weekend. Residents of Shanghai no longer need a negative test to enter outdoor venues including parks and scenic attractions. Shanghai and other cities also no longer require a negative test to ride public transportation. But many restrictions still remain including at malls and office buildings in Beijing.
 
CNN's Steven Jiang joins me now live from Beijing. Steven, zero COVID is not going away just yet.
 
STEVEN JIANG, CNN BEIJING BUREAU CHIEF: That is right, Laila. And remember, most school campuses are still closed in this country which is one big reason I'm working from home today for some childcare duties. 
 
So I think that would be the ultimate litmus test for a lot of parents around this country. But as you mentioned, over the weekend, across this country, local authorities have announced a series of changes in their local COVID protocols. 
 
And the biggest of which is getting rid of that requirement to show a negative test result within 48 hours to take public transportation. But also to getting to hospitals and many outdoor public venues. 
 
And one -- another rule change we have seen is people no longer having to register their names to buy common medicines like fever medications, as well as antibiotics. 
 
And in some provinces like one in the Guangdong (ph), (INAUDIBLE) in the east and also Chongqing to the west, authorities are now telling residents not to do COVID tests unless necessary. 
 
That's obviously quite a sharp contrast to what they have been doing for months, which is ordering these mandatory mass testing often citywide. 
 
But the problem here is contradiction between new and existing rules because for many places, including here in Beijing, you still need a COVID test result to get into most indoor public venues, including office buildings and shopping malls. 
 
And obviously, going to work and doing grocery shopping among the most, you know, basic daily activities for most people. Not to mention in many locations, authorities have suddenly removed or closed testing kiosks really forcing people to line up for hours in many cases remaining locations, often in inclement weather, like in heavy rain or even in snow storms. So, that is really increasingly the new complaint from many people. [01:39:51]
 
JIANG: And then of course, there is this lack of clarity and consistency across the country, because there are still many holdouts in this vast country, with one town in the southwestern province (INAUDIBLE) for example already telling its residents working out of town not to come home for the upcoming Lunar New Year holiday.
 
That is not until late January. So I think right now, what you are seeing is really this phenomenon of a lot of local officials trying to wait to hear from the top leadership especially President Xi Jinping who has not addressed this issue publicly. Even though we've heard that rather surprising revelation that he told the visiting European Council president last week that the recent protests were mainly students and the young people who are frustrated after three years of COVID, Laila. 
 
HARRAK: Steven Jiang live in Beijing, thank you very much. 
 
Some pro-democracy Chinese exiles say they don't feel safe in the west. They say the communist government is secretly trying to intimidate them into returning home. 
 
CNN's Nina Dos Santos has the story from London. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NINA DOS SANTOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: For three years, Simon Cheng (ph) has called London home after fleeing a brutal clampdown on democracy in his native Hong Kong, he sought sanctuary in the U.K.
 
But even here he says, Beijing's tentacles are never far away. 
 
SIMON CHENG, HONG KONG DISSIDENT: Sometimes I received some threatening letters. 
 
DOS SANTOS: He says there's an email he received last year with a warning. 
 
CHENG: It said the Chinese agents would come find you and take you back. It's just a matter of time. 
 
DOS SANTOS: Then pictures of people he says have been following him. 
 
Like this man in Westminster. And this car he spotted in multiple locations. 
 
Last year, Cheng says someone offered around $12,000 on WeChat to get hold of his address. 
 
Do you feel safe in the U.K. at the moment? 
 
CHENG: I do not feel safe in the U.K. Actually happening -- the persecution happening on British soil. And if you do not protected, it only shows to the British public that even the government here don't try to protect the judicial sovereignty and dignity. DOS SANTOS: Last year, U.K. opened up a pathway for more and more
 
 Hongkongers to gain citizenship on the U.K. soil. And as more people continue to arrive here, seeking shelter the pressure is on for authorities to make sure that the Hongkongers rights are protected. 
 
That issue came to a head last month. After a Hong Kong pro-democracy protester was assaulted on the grounds of the Chinese consulate in Manchester. After that, this warning to Great Britain. 
 
YANG ZIAOGUANG, CHINESE EMBASSY SPOKEPERSON: Protecting shelter to the Hong Kong independent element will only in the end bring disaster to Britain.
 
DOS SANTOS: Now, this NGO report says the Chinese police have been operating covertly from three addresses across the U.K. and elsewhere around the world, in part, to pressure people to return home. 
 
China says these centers help nationals with admin, like renewing drivers licenses and it's staffed by volunteers. They say to suggest otherwise would be quote, "a smear". 
 
Either way, lawmakers are demanding urgent action. 
 
IAN DUNCAN SMITH, BRITISH CONSERVATIVE MP: People have fled to the U.K. because we believe in human rights, the rule of law and democracy so they can have free speech. Hongkongers, students, came over the (INAUDIBLE) what do they find when they come here? Chinese unofficial police stations. 
 
That is shocking and under anybody's rulebook it should have been sorted out by now. 
 
DOS SANTOS: CNN was not able to independently verify Simon Cheng's allegations. But we have heard multiple similar stories from other Hongkongers in the U.K. 
 
What do you think the objective of Chinese authorities is? 
 
CHENG: They tried to silence us with fear. If we succumb to fear, the Chinese Communist Party will win. 
 
DOS SANTOS: Nina Dos Santos, CNN -- London.

HARRAK: A sad and shocking sight on the coast of the Caspian Sea. Russian news agency says the bodies of at least 2,500 Caspian Seals have washed ashore in the Russian Republic of Dagestan. 
 
Environmental officials say the seals died of natural factors and there were no signs of being attacked or getting caught in fishing nets.
 
Specialists are collecting samples of the seals to try and determine what killed them. The animals are already classified as endangered because of overhunting, climate change and habitat loss. In the coming hours, jurors in Los Angeles will resume deliberations
 
 in Harvey Weinstein's sexual assault trial. A report on what is at stake for the former movie mogul. After the break. 
 <br>[01:44:54]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HARRAK: Incoming Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is pushing for Donald Trump to condemn Kanye West's anti-Semitic remarks. In an interview with NBC, Mr. Netanyahu called the former president's recent meeting at Mar-a-Lago with West and white nationalist and Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes unacceptable. Take a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER: President Trump did great things for Israel. He recognized Jerusalem as our capital long overdue since King David proclaimed it as such 3,000 years ago. 
 
He moved the American embassy there. He recognized our sovereignty in the Golan Heights. We've done all these great things. And I appreciate it. And I remain appreciative.
 
On this matter, on Kanye West and that other unacceptable guest, I think it is not merely unacceptable, it's wrong. And I hope that he sees his way to staying out of it and condemning it. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK: Mr. Trump has tried to downplay last month's meeting at Mar-a- Lago. But he is facing backlash from both sides of the aisle including from some top republicans. Critics say the meeting shows poor judgment critics say the media shows poor judgments and the question why Mr. Trump has not offered to rebuke his guests' anti-Semitic remarks. 
 
A Los Angeles jury will resume deliberations just a few hours from now in the sexual assault trial of Harvey Weinstein. The former movie producer is charged with multiple counts of forcible rape and sexual assault. 
 
Prosecutors say Mr. Weinstein used his power and influence to lure women into private meetings where he assaulted them. 
 
CNN's Camila Bernal has more. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CAMILA BERNAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I will start by explaining why the trial here in Los Angeles is important. Yes, Harvey Weinstein is already serving a 23 year sentence for his conviction in New York but he is appealing. 
 
Also, the trial here in Los Angeles is much larger. You have more accusers, more charges. In total, he is facing seven different charges. Two counts of rape, five counts of sexual assault. If convicted, he could face 60 years to life in prison, plus five
 
 years. He is already 70 years old. So this could mean spending the rest of his life behind bars. 
 
Harvey Weinstein maintains his innocence. He has pleaded not guilty to all of the seven charges. And his defense attorneys arguing that the accusations and the relationships were either consensual or fabricated. 
 
On the other hand, you have the prosecution arguing that Harvey Weinstein used his power in Hollywood to assault women. They also said that there is a pattern of rape here. Using the words rapist, rape. 
 <br>[01:49:51]
 
BERNAL: The jury here has heard from many, many -- witnesses about 50 in total. This has been a long trial that started in late October. And they've heard from all four of these accusers including the first lady of California, Jennifer Siebel Newsom who is also a filmmaker. She says that Harvey Weinstein raped her. 
 
On the other hand, you have the defense attorneys saying that this was a consensual relationship. They specifically said regret is not the same as rape. 
 
So you have this back and forth. And now we will have to wait for the jury to see exactly who they believe. Those deliberations will continue Monday morning.
