BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN HOST: Try to wrap your head around this. Elon Musk just announced the first successful surgical brain microchip implant on a human performed by his startup known as Neuralink. The operation apparently took place on Sunday, and the patient, according to Musk, is doing well. The goal of this implanted chip, Musk says, is to return motor functions to people who've lost use of their limbs.
 
Joining us now, the president of the British Neuroscience Association, Tara Spires-Jones. Tara, thank you so much for being with us.
 
We're told that this new chip implant will be called Telepathy. What's your reaction to this announcement?
 
TARA SPIRES-JONES, PRESIDENT, BRITISH NEUROSCIENCE ASSOCIATION: Well, this is very interesting. So, as a neuroscientist, in a way, it's great to hear about new and exciting neuroscience research, but this isn't the first time. This has been done. There have been brain computer interfaces in the past.
 <br>[14:35:00]
 
So, several companies and several academic centers around the world have implanted brain computer interfaces. One of them last year was amazing. A person who was paralyzed because of a neck injury had an BCI or brain-computer interface, installed in his brain. A computer on his back that had A.I. in it to read the signals, and then another stimulator in his spine. And now, he can walk. So, these technologies are amazing.
 
SANCHEZ: Yes, it's fascinating. I do want to ask you about how Musk described the patient. He said "initial results show promising neuron spike detection." Now, I don't know what that means. I'm hoping you do.
 
SPIRES-JONES: Absolutely. So, neuron spike detection, your neurons in your brain. So, they're the brain cells that are linked up and form your network. They actually send electrical signals. And every time a neuron sends a signal down a wire to another neuron, we call it a spike. It's actually electrically detectable.
 
So, those electrodes that they've implanted in this person's brain can detect every time a neuron nearby sends a signal to another neuron called spike.
 
SANCHEZ: So, that's a really good sign. Now, Neuralink has faced some scrutiny in the past. There was a monkey that died after it was implanted with a chip back in 2022. Some employees have argued that the company is rushing this to the market. Do you have any concerns about this technology, whether with Neuralink or anyone else?
 
SPIRES-JONES: It's hard to say specifically for Neuralink, because we haven't seen as scientists any published data that we can look at to scrutinize as scientists.
 
In general terms, there will always be a concern with a brain surgery, right? I'm not a brain surgeon, I'm a neuroscientist, but you can imagine anytime you have your head opened, there's a chance of infection. So, that's one risk.
 
There are some more risks that could be longer-term, but they would be very far beyond what we are now. So, I think short-term, we would worry just about the dangers of the surgery.
 
SANCHEZ: So, the focus here is to help folks regain the use of limbs. Musk says that he sees a future where we can communicate with technology seamlessly, just with our thoughts. How likely do you think this -- and the other big moments that you mentioned, how likely are they a step toward those kinds of broader implications? Like, where do you see this going?
 
SPIRES-JONES: As a sci-fi fan, I love thinking about these things. For now, we are a long way from what I would call telepathy. But it is clear that in some of these systems that are published, and I can read the data, even without implanting chips, just reading the brain waves from the surface of your head, you can already interpret what language people are thinking about.
 
So, some of the applications of this technology will be people who can't speak can think the words and then it will be spoken through a computer. And we're not very far at all from people being able to think and move a cursor. That's one of the things that Neuralink says they can do on their videos. And that's really achievable if you can interpret those brain spikes with artificial intelligence or machine learning. So, you know what the person is thinking. You can move a cursor, or use your phone.
 
So, that kind of thing is possible. It'll be a long time before we could have telepathy person to person or have your Duolingo implanted into your brain, for example. But it's a step in that direction, certainly.
 
SANCHEZ: Yes, it is really fascinating. Tera Spires-Jones, we got to leave the conversation there. But we appreciate you joining us this afternoon.
 
SPIRES-JONES: Thank you.
 
SANCHEZ: Of course. We want to take you quickly to the Pentagon. Because right now, they're giving an update on the attack at a base in Jordan that claimed the lives of three U.S. soldiers. Let's listen in.
 
MAJ. GEN. PAT RYDER, PENTAGON PRESS SECRETARY: Jennifer, Central Command is still assessing, but again, we are confident that this attack was sponsored by Iranian-backed proxies.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So Kata'ib Hezbollah has just put out a message on Telegram suggesting that -- telling its fighters not to attack U.S. bases in Iraq and Syria, suggesting that they will support the fight in Gaza in other ways and suggesting that, even if the U.S. strikes them, not to respond. What is your response to that?
 
RYDER: Yes, we've seen those reports. I don't have a specific comment to provide, other than actions speak louder than words. Thanks. Lara?
 
LARA: Thank you. A couple questions. First of all, can you speak a little bit about the drones that are based at Tower 22 in Al-Tanf? We saw some -- we had some reporting yesterday that the -- there was some confusion over whether the drone coming into the base was friendly or -- was friend or foe. And I know that these -- most of these drones should have IFF software enabling them to distinguish between the two. So, I'm just wondering if you could tell me whether those drones do have that software?
 
RYDER: Yes, thanks, Lara. So, no, I'm not going to get into the specifics on the kind of capabilities as it relates to intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance capabilities that we have.
 <br>[14:40:00]
 
In terms of the reasons behind how this one-way attack drone was able to penetrate the facility's air defenses, that's something that Central Command is looking at now. And I'm just not going to be able to get into the specifics of that.
 
LARA: The second question then, actually on a different topic, but there was a -- another report today saying that the U.S. is open to reopening discussions with Turkey to let them buy F-35s. I was wondering if you can speak on that from the DOD's perspective? Are you aware of those discussions?
 
RYDER: I've seen the comments by our State Department colleagues on that. I'd refer you to State to discuss. As you know, right now, with Turkey maintaining the S-400, that is currently not something that is on the table, but I'd refer you to State. Let me go to Missy.
 
MISSY: Just a couple questions, Pat. Thank you. I -- is there any update on whether Secretary Austin will come and talk to us sometime soon? First question.
 
RYDER: Again, I don't have a date to announce. Certainly, aware of the request and we'll keep you updated.
 
MISSY: OK. And on Jordan, can you just clarify is -- are -- the troops in Jordan at Tower 22 and other bases, are they under OIR authority or are they -- they're under some other authority? Can you specify that? And is it right that there are about 3,000 troops in Jordan?
 
RYDER: Missy, I'll have to come back to you on the total number of U.S. forces deployed to Jordan. So, we'll take that question.
 
The forces that were -- you know, that -- the three soldiers that were killed, again, as we've highlighted, they were there in support of Operation Inherent Resolve, supporting the defeat ISIS mission.
 
MISSY: That means that they're under OIR authority at Tower 22?
 
RYDER: Operating in support of OIR.
 
MISSY: OK. So, does that mean they report to the Commander of OIR?
 
RYDER: It -- I mean -- and I'm not -- don't want to get into the chain of command process here, but if they're there supporting OIR, then certainly OIR Commander can request assistance from those forces. So -- 
 
MISSY: OK. And then the last question -- and I think we asked Sabrina this yesterday, and I think it was maybe something that you guys were still looking at. Just wanted to ask if there had been any new information about any steps that may be taken to protect American forces in the region, like in terms of air defense or new steps to make sure that something like this doesn't happen again?
 
RYDER: Yes. So, you know, for operation security reasons, I'm not going to be able to go into specifics, other than to say that U.S. Central Command, of course, is taking this very seriously and that we will take necessary measures and steps to ensure that our forces are protected, recognizing as well that this is a dangerous neighborhood. But again -- yes, to answer your question, we will take steps to ensure that our forces are protected.
 
Let me go to Will.
 
WILL: Two questions. First, Qatar's Prime Minister expressed some concerns yesterday that the U.S. response to the Jordan attack could potentially affect the negotiations over a new hostage deal. Is that part of the Pentagon's calculus in determining a U.S. response to this?
 
RYDER: So, Will, I don't have anything specifically on that, other than to say again, you know, as part of any decision-making process. We take a wide range of considerations into account -- again -- to include what our broader regional goals are, which from the very beginning has been to prevent the situation in Israel and Gaza from, you know, expanding into a broader conflict. I'll just leave it there.
 
WILL: Second, it's been two days since the attack in Jordan. Is there a concern that this -- that delay in -- in a -- in responding could give these groups time to prepare to, you know, disperse from likely targets, et cetera?
 
RYDER: So, Will, what I -- you know, again, I'm not going to get into any details of what -- about what a potential future operation could look like. You've heard both the president and Secretary Austin say that we will respond in a time and a manner of our choosing.
 
Three U.S. service members were killed, over 40 wounded. Oh, by the way, these service members were deployed into the region to contribute to regional security and stability, in support of the international coalition to ensure the lasting defeat of ISIS. So, there will be consequences, and I'll just leave it at that.
 
SANCHEZ: We've been listening to Major General Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, speaking in response to the deaths of three American service members killed over the weekend in Jordan.
 
You just heard him say there will be consequences for those actions. Ryder was asked for any specifics on exactly how this attack drone was able to penetrate U.S. air defenses, ostensibly coming from a militia group backed by Iran in the region. He did not give very many specifics.
 
We heard from President Biden, speaking to reporters earlier in the day, that he has decided on a course of action in response to this attack, though no details, no word yet on exactly what that entails.
 
I will, of course, continue to monitor these remarks from the Pentagon and bring you the very latest as we get it.
 <br>[14:45:00]
 
But from this situation in the Middle East, we want to take you to the frontlines of the war in Ukraine, because in just moments, we're going to take you where Ukrainian troops are fighting for survival, facing intense resistance and harsh elements as they fight off Russian firepower.
 
We'll be right back in just moments.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: CNN goes to the frontlines of the war in Ukraine, where huge firefights are underway in forest trenches.
 
Ukrainian soldiers managing to hold the line against Russian forces, despite critical shortages of equipment and ammunition. And no help coming from the U.S. as Congress fights over funding for the war. CNN's Fred Pleitgen is in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. Fred, you're just back from the frontlines. Tell us what the situation is.
 <br>[14:50:00]
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, it certainly is one that's very difficult for the Ukrainians, but by and large, they say that they're still managing to hang on. But you're absolutely right, Brianna. The biggest issue they say they face are those ammunition shortages, especially as right now, the Russians really trying to push hard many sectors on the frontline, but especially in one where we were very close to.
 
It's a forest fight that's going on there. There's direct assaults going on by the Russians also using tanks. The Ukrainians say that those assaults are very harsh. They're trying to hold on there, but it is an extremely difficult battle. Here's we're learning.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over): All-out warfare in unforgiving terrain. Forest battles in Eastern Ukraine mean facing a near-constant Russian onslaught. Vladimir Putin's army trying to break through Ukrainian defenses.
 
Dmytro is one of those holding them up.
 
The situation is very active and very tense, he says, because the enemy has much more equipment and manpower. Basically, every day they try to storm the positions.
 
A dead Russian soldier and a destroyed tank show just how close the Russians have come. It's a fight for survival and against the elements. The trench cold, wet, and soggy, the only heat coming from candles the soldiers cower around, gathering strength to face overwhelming Russian firepower.
 
They shoot direct fire. Planes are flying. Basically, they have it all, he says. But probably, the worst are tanks. When they fire, you don't even hear it. You hear an airplane when it comes over. With a tank, you're in God's hands.
 
Artillery fire another threat here as we found out when we came under fire trying to make it to the area.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Go.
 
PLEITGEN: This is, unfortunately, something that when we work here in the east of the country happens all too often. We were getting ready to film here and then all of a sudden, we heard what appeared to be outgoing artillery, but then a shell came in.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE) vehicles (INAUDIBLE).
 
PLEITGEN: One hundred meters. Got you.
 
We're now trying to make our way out of here as safe as possible. That means we have to keep distance between our cars, but we also, of course, have to keep moving the entire time to make sure that we can get out of here, hopefully, safely.
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over): We believe a Russian drone spotted us and directed the artillery fire, but two can play that game. Nazarly is a Ukrainian drone pilot. He guides Kyiv's artillery guns targeting Russian infantry but also armored assault formations, including main battle tanks. He says ammo shortages mean he has to be extremely precise.
 
It's no secret we're starved of artillery shells, he says. We try to work as efficiently and accurately as possible to hit the enemy's firepower.
 
Trying to fight back any way they can on one of the toughest battlefields of this war.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
PLEITGEN (on camera): Certainly, is really tough out there, Brianna. But the Ukrainians are saying that they are having some success actually against the Russians there. They say that in the span of just a couple of days, they managed to take out more than 40 Russian tanks and armored vehicles, yet the Russians keep on coming because they have so many weapons at their disposal.
 
And again, as the ammo depletes for the Ukrainians, it becomes more difficult for them by the day to hang on, Brianna.
 
KEILAR: Yes. What a scene to behold. Thank you, Fred, for showing us that. We certainly appreciate it.
 
We'll be right back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:55:05]
 
SANCHEZ: Two years after the 2022 Olympic Winter Games in Beijing, the U.S. figure skating team will be awarded the gold medal instead of silver. This announcement comes after Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva, who was part of the Russian team that year, was disqualified for doping.
 
Let's bring in CNN, World Sport Anchor Don Riddell. So, Don, what happens now? Is Russia going to appeal this?
 
DON RIDDELL, CNN HOST, WORLD SPORT: Well, there's still so much that needs to be figured out. We don't know for sure what the Russians are going to do. We have reached out to them for comment, but have not heard back. But they have described this as a politicized decision by the Court of Arbitration for Sport to ban Valieva for four years. So, we'll see what their next move is.
 
The United States team is celebrating the fact that they are now gold medalists. The head of the USOPC, Sarah Hirshland, says she cannot see a scenario in which they won't be the gold medalists. And, of course, this is a cause for celebration because these athletes left Beijing with empty boxes. There was no medal ceremony. They weren't given a medal of any color, no silver, no gold, nothing. So, the American athletes believe they will be getting a gold medal, but it is still far from a satisfactory situation. This is what one of the American skaters, Nathan Chen, told on CNN earlier today.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
NATHAN CHEN, OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST: Without clean sport, you know, the integrity of the sport is diminished. Of course, there's nuances to the situation. And this decision is certainly a win for clean sport. However, the fact that this happened at all is a win for no one.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
RIDDELL: Yes. I mean, this whole situation has been an absolute fiasco. But at least for these American athletes, there is some kind of light now at the end of the tunnel.
 
SANCHEZ: And, Don, I'm kind of confused by this because Canada is now disappointed. There was a decision made by the International Skating Union to keep them in fourth place. Is this likely to get reversed?
 
RIDDELL: We'll see. Understate -- disappointed would be quite the understatement, I think. Yes, it's a little bit complicated. But essentially, they stripped Russia of a number of points. And so, effectively, dropped them, I think, from 74 down to 54. But that still left Canada in fourth place and it gave the Russians a bronze instead of nothing at all.
 
So, the Canadians feel as though they have a very, very strong case. They are considering their options. But I certainly would expect them to appeal this decision. And their athletes are hoping that they can end up with something at the end of all of this. But clearly, just when we thought it was all over, there's still so much more to be figured out and argued over.
 
SANCHEZ: I wish we could do this in other sports and retroactively take away championships that weren't deserved. Maybe the Dolphins would have a few more rings. Don Riddell, thank you so much. Appreciate the update.
 
Still ahead, President Biden says he has decided how the United States is going to respond to the drone strike in Jordan that killed three U.S. soldiers. We're following the latest developments on this story.
