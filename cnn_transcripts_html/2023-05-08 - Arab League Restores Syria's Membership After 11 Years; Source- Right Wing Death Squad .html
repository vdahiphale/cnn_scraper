BECKY ANDERSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: I'm Becky Anderson live from Abu Dhabi. This is CONNECT THE WORLD.
 
Coming up this hour. Russia launches a wave of drone attacks and missile strikes across Ukraine.
 
Texas mourns the eight people killed in a mass shooting at a shopping mall.
 
The Arab League readmit Syria after an 11-year absence.
 
And F1's Max Verstappen claims victory at the Miami from Prix.
 
Well, evil has returned and will be defeated. Words from Ukraine's President comparing Russia to Nazi Germany while marking the end of World 
 
 War II. The evidence of that evil one may argue look no further than here. A punishing wave of Russian strikes fired across the country overnight. 
 
 Ukraine says it shut down all 35 drones launched at the Capitol but the debris left a ragged trail of destruction.
 
Meanwhile, Russian-controlled areas of Zaporizhzhia are said to be under fire from Ukraine. Some 1600 people had been evacuated from towns along the 
 
 front lines. One of the big flashpoints of this wall is Eastern Ukraine and the city of Bakhmut. The Russian Wagner group was supposed to be in its 
 
 final days of fighting there. But instead, its leader is now claiming new gains.
 
CNN's Nick Payton Walsh explains.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: From fundamentally here, it's only really him that's been making statements 
 
 about withdrawing and now saying he's got what he wants, and therefore he'll stay. Remember, he appeared in front of a collection of his own dead 
 
 mercenaries behind him saying that they have died because of a lack of ammunition shell.
 
So, he's sort of been having this public conversation almost with himself, with the exception of a brief comment by the Kremlin spokesperson saying 
 
 that he was aware of media reports about it. But it's been a startling moment, frankly, of dissent inside the Kremlin ranks very rare indeed. And 
 
 at a very important time to ahead of tomorrow's Victory Day parades inside of Moscow, where Russia talks about his victory over the Nazis. 
 
They had indeed almost vowed to take the key city of Bakhmut where Prigozhin is based by that day. That's not going to happen. And instead, 
 
 we've had this remarkable statement where he unilaterally said we're leaving because we haven't got what we want. Quite what led him to change 
 
 his mind here. We will probably never know. But it added to that general sense in the last week or so that there were increasing members of Russia's 
 
 elite, making very vocal comments about how badly the war is going.
 
This just ahead of Ukraine's counter offensive showing signs of being underway at this point. A bad message to Russian troops in the ranks. 
 
 Already experiencing low munition, low morale. Certainly, overnight though, we've seen some -- again evidence of how Russia is likely to respond to 
 
 when Ukrainian advances. 35 drones launched at the Capitol Kyiv. All of them taken out but five people injured from the debris falling from the sky 
 
 and separately eight missiles attacking the port city of Odesa where one nightwatchman in a warehouse that was struck was killed.
 
So, Russia continuing to lash out, sending these messy signals about dissent and its own ranks and Ukraine staying relatively quiet on its 
 
 military maneuvers. But showing signs that it's counter offensive is underway.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, as Nick Payton Walsh was just saying there, Russian attacks today hitting across Ukraine. Let's get you to our international diplomatic 
 
 editor Nic Robertson who is in eastern Ukraine. Forgive my voice, Nic. There are rumors that Ukraine is set to launch its long-anticipated counter 
 
 offensive. We've just heard Nick Paton Walsh suggesting there is evidence that we are about to see that.
 
What is that evidence, Nic? Tell us what's going on on the ground.
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Well, there restrictions that reporters like us are put under in Ukraine that do not 
 
 permit us to talk about troop movements we see or locations or numbers of troops. We've been around the Eastern Front today and you can certainly 
 
 hear a lot of artillery fire along the Eastern Front. But we've also been - - we've also been -- sorry, that's the air raid alarm just being cleared around here which goes on and off quite a lot.
 <br>[10:05:04]
 
But I think generally speaking, when we speak to Ukrainian commanders, the perception that they want to give us is that the counter offensive is not 
 
 about to happen just yet. It will. But they say part of the psychology of the counter offensive and having the Russians believe that it's coming, and 
 
 that it's been imminent for some time as drawn a large number of Russian troops into Ukraine.
 
The Ukrainian say, while the Russians are at the frontlines, it's hard to - - harder for the Russian forces to get them everything that they need. The resupply, the food, the ammunition, all of that, that it takes to sustain 
 
 an army in high readiness. And it also creates poor morale they say among the Russians who are fearing where is the counter offensive going to come? 
 
 There are no indications being given by Ukrainian officials about where it might come or when it might come.
 
I think the hints that we see on the ground here are that the preparations are there. But the information that's been provided suggests that it may 
 
 not just be -- just yet, but of course, this is psychological warfare. So, it's hard to discern that the accurate, most accurate narrative.
 
ANDERSON: And whenever that counter offensive is, Zelenskyy has said, and I quote him here, "evil has returned and will be defeated." Whenever this 
 
 counter offensive starts, this is crucial. Many say that this is sort of -- this will be the big battle. Is that what it feels like on the ground?
 
ROBERTSON: It does. We're here and we're out in the field. And we do get to talk to a lot of senior Ukrainian military officials. And these 
 
 conversations are often off the record or on -- our own background. But what everyone will agree on is that Russia has a huge military force in the 
 
 country. Last estimate from the Defense Intelligence here was 369,000 troops, Russian troops inside Ukraine.
 
That's triple the number at the time of the invasion. The defenses are very heavily well dug in. This will be for the Ukrainians, a tough offensive, 
 
 but it's one that they must win. And it's one that they must use the psychological warfare, the strategy of trying to deceive the enemy in one 
 
 area and attack them in another. But the vital fact that they all understand a no to be true, is that they must break through, that they must 
 
 show that they can get a strong and fast advance to put pressure on Russia and create chaos in the Russian ranks.
 
And show their political and military allies in the West that the investment of money and equipment and support has been worthwhile. They're 
 
 aware that Western backing for Ukraine is potentially at stake or the level of backing. If they can't convince that they can -- that they can take 
 
 territory back this year, they're worried that a stalemate could develop and political sustainability among their allies maybe harder to maintain 
 
 this level of support.
 
ANDERSON: Nic's on the ground, folks. Thank you, Nic.
 
Well, even as Russia prepares to parade its military might through Moscow, it is celebrating Victory Day. Its army is turning to the relics of its 
 
 past to reequip its beleaguered forces in Ukraine victory. Of course, celebrating the end of World War I -- II and the defeat of Nazism, tanks 
 
 not used since the Cold War are being pressed back into service. A sign of just how desperate Russia is becoming.
 
CNN's Clare Sebastian has a story.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JOHN DELANEY, SENIOR CURATOR, IMPERIAL WAR MUSEUM: What a missile will do is it'll fly over the tank then down and in 90 degrees straight into the 
 
 top of the turret which is less well defended.
 
CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This scenario has played out hundreds of times over the past 14 months. Ukraine 
 
 using Western weapons to devastating effect. Russia, according to one recent estimate has lost up to half its operational tank fleet in this war. 
 
 Now Western officials say Russia's dusting off much older models to replace them. 
 
DELANEY: This gun was used on the Su-100 tank destroyer in 1944. So, it's a second world war gun.
 
SEBASTIAN: Including the T-55. First built in the 1940s. This one now housed at the Imperial War Museum outside Cambridge.
 
Satellite imagery for a storage facility in Russia's Far East showing dozens of tanks have been removed in the last year. This image showing the 
 
 T-55 at that same facility.
 <br>[10:10:00]
 
A video that first surfaced in March also showing a train load on the move reportedly somewhere in Russia. The Russian Ministry of Defense hasn't 
 
 confirmed their deployment. But in recent weeks, well connected Russian bloggers have begun showing T-55s in Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine.
 
DELANEY: There are so many of these were manufactured over 100,000 altogether and the parts -- the basic mechanical parts are all 
 
 interchangeable. So, there will be vast stockpiles of these.
 
SEBASTIAN: The T-55 was a central piece of the Soviet Union's Cold War arsenal, helping crushed democratic uprisings in Eastern Europe, Hungary in 
 
 1956, the Prague Spring 12 years later. But by the time Iraq used them in the Gulf War in the early 90s.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We took out all told 14 T-55 tanks.
 
SEBASTIAN: They were already outclassed by U.S. M1 Abrams in British challengers. Earlier versions of the tanks NATO countries are now supplying 
 
 to Ukraine.
 
TREVOR TAYLOR, PROFESSORIAL FELLOW IN DEFENSE, RUCI: I think face with Western weapons. The Russians must expect very heavy casualties if they 
 
 expect to move forward using that type of system.
 
SEBASTIAN: Experts say behind the official propaganda Russia cannot build new weapons quick enough.
 
SEBASTIAN (on camera): Western sanctions primarily targeting Russia's access to higher tech parts for weapons have made it much harder for them 
 
 to manufacture more modern equipment. Older simpler tanks like this, thousands of them just sitting in storage provide an alternative. 
 
But this against say a Leopard 2 or a Challenger, what happens?
 
DELANEY: If it's a one-on-one tank engagement over a reasonable distance this will lose every time but in wooded or closer built environments, this 
 
 is adequate.
 
SEBASTIAN: It's also simpler to maintain and train on the newer systems and advantage for rushes mobilized troops.
 
DELANEY: Bigger pit, seated sit, the tank in the pit so you can only see the turret. And then that can be used to defend the front line against the 
 
 counter attack.
 
SEBASTIAN: Russia is now digging in with everything it has but Ukraine gets ready for what maybe its biggest counter offensive yet.
 
Clare Sebastian, CNN, Duxford, England.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON: It does seem remarkable, doesn't it? Well, Russia and the United States are giving opposing reactions to serious readmission to the Arab 
 
 League. Moscow welcoming the move, Washington saying it's too soon and the sanctions on Damascus it says will remain in effect. Well, the Arab League 
 
 officially readmitting Syria on Sunday, some 11 years after it was suspended in the early months of the country's civil war.
 
Secretary General saying the decision applies to the block but not to individual countries. Have a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
AHMED ABOUL GHEIT, ARAB LEAGUE SECRETARY GENERAL (through translator): The return of Syria is the beginning of a movement, not an end. The direction 
 
 of the resolution to the crisis in Syria will take time for procedures to be implemented and it will be gradual. The task of this committee is to 
 
 follow up on those procedures. Also, it is not a decision to resume relationships between Arab states and Syria.
 
This is a sovereign decision left for every country to take on its own. In this decision, we are talking about holding the membership and the 
 
 formation of a committee to communicate with the Syrian government and regime.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, Nada Bashir connecting us from London. Just how significant is this decision? 
 
 Explain.
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN INTERNATIONAL REPORTER: Well, yes. Definitely, the Secretary General of the Arab League. The hope now is that by admitting 
 
 Syria back into the Arab League, this could lead -- lay the pathway for some sort of political solution to be reached amongst the Arab League 
 
 member states. And of course, over the last more than a decade now we have seen Syria completely decimated by President Bashar al-Assad's brutal civil 
 
 war and his violent crackdown on protesters and rebel groups.
 
Now, the hope is this may be a position really for the Arab League to push forward with communication with the Syrian regime. And of course, over the 
 
 last few years and indeed months, we have seen President Assad solidifying his control of territory in Syria. And we've seen the normalization of ties 
 
 between some regional players, including Iran, of course, who has been a staunch backer of Syria throughout the Civil War.
 
We saw that key visit by Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi to President Bashar al-Assad in Damascus. The first Iranian Head of State to visit the 
 
 country in some 13 years. And of course, in April, we saw Saudi Arabia's foreign minister and a similar visit to Damascus. So, we are seeing that 
 
 progress there, the normalization of ties. This is hugely important, significant for the region. It could really mark a shift in the political 
 
 landscape in the Middle East.
 <br>[10:15:04]
 
CHURCH: And this is an example of regional solutions to regional conflicts. And this is the region telling Washington, you asked us to sort out our 
 
 problems. We are doing that. We expect you to follow. They're not getting that message, though, from Washington or the European capitals, and it is 
 
 U.S. and European sanctions that are still crippling that Syrian regime. What about normal Syrians? What are people on the ground say about this 
 
 decision?
 
BASHIR: Well, Becky, when we look at the impact of President Bashar al- Assad's war, we're talking about an estimated 350,000 Syrians killed as a result of his regime's brutality. An estimated 14 million people at least 
 
 made refugees by the Civil War. That's according to U.N. figures. And of course, everyone will be familiar with the disturbing reports of countless 
 
 deaths suffered by Syrian refugees, attempting to risk everything crossing the Mediterranean to reach safety.
 
So, you can imagine for many Syrian people, for many Arab people who feel solidarity with the Syrians, this is seen as a betrayal. Take a listen to 
 
 what some Syrians and Idlib have had to say about this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
RASHAD AL-DEEK, DISPLACED SYRIAN (through translator): We didn't benefit from the fact that the regime was not in the Arab League. So, what will 
 
 happen if it's part of it? This means nothing to us because we are displaced and forced to leave our towns. They are just like him. This is 
 
 why they took him back. They are all useless.
 
ABDUL SALAM YOUSEF, DISPLACED SYRIAN: It came as a big unfortunate shock for us Syrians living in camps in the north, instead of Arab leaders 
 
 helping us and getting us out of those camps where we suffer and live in pain. They whitewash the criminal and killer's hands from our blood.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BASHIR: And of course, Becky, for millions now living as refugees for the millions afraid of what they will face if they are made to return home or 
 
 if they ever do choose to return home. Real question now is how and when will the international community, will the Arab League be able to seek 
 
 accountability for the crimes committed by President Bashar al-Assad's regime. Becky?
 
ANDERSON: Nada is on the story out of London for you. Thank you, Nada. Apologies for my voice, viewers. I hope you can keep up with what we're 
 
 doing tonight.
 
Authorities are searching for the motive in the mass shooting that left eight people dead and seven others wounded at a shopping mall in Texas. A 
 
 law enforcement source says the gunman he was killed by an officer on the scene may have been driven by right-wing extremism. While many are paying 
 
 tribute to the victims of Saturday shooting placing flowers on this makeshift memorial near the mall.
 
And we're just starting to learn the identities of some of those killed. Among them, very well-liked mall security guard. CNN's Josh Campbell is in 
 
 Allen in Texas. What are you hearing there on the ground?
 
JOSH CAMPELL, CNN SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, Becky, we're learning more about this suspect. The person who's accused of coming here to this mall in 
 
 North Texas and opening fire. We're told he is a 33-year-old man who was from the Dallas area. Previously a security guard. He had been living in 
 
 some type of temporary lodging in and around this area. Now I'm told by authorities and law enforcement sources familiar with this investigation 
 
 that their investigation of the motive is starting to narrow down to possible right-wing extremism being at play here. 
 
And that is because after the suspect was shot and killed by a police officer, as this mass shooting was occurring, authorities found on the 
 
 gunman and insignia that read RDWS which authorities believe stands for Right-Wing Death Squad. It's the same type of insignia that we've seen 
 
 extremists here in the United States were at various protests over the past few years. And I'm also told that authorities have been digging through the 
 
 suspect's social media he had an extensive online presence.
 
I'm told -- the authorities believed that he made several posts pertaining to white supremacy and neo-Nazis. And so again, authorities they don't yet 
 
 know the full specific motive but they are starting to narrow that down based on the suspects past communications. And then finally we're getting 
 
 word not, you know, not just from authorities. But what it was like here inside this mall as the shooting was taking place, we're learning stories 
 
 of heroism including from one man who spoke to CNN.
 
He received a call from his son saying that there was a shooting happening here. The man rushes to the scene immediately encounters victims. He starts 
 
 rendering aid, doing CPR, trying to save lives. All while his own son is inside the building doing the same. Have a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
STEVEN SPAINHOUER, FIRST RESPONDER TO THE MASS SHOOTING AT ALLEN, TEXAS, OUTLET MALL: He was in the break when we (INAUDIBLE) in the window that was 
 
 shut out by the gunman, I wouldn't be here. He got his staff and his employees into the break room. They took one of the victims shot outside 
 
 into the store and took care of that victim while they were waiting to be extricated by the SWAT teams.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[10:20:08]
 
CAMPBELL: Now, this is a live look here of a makeshift memorial that has been set up honoring those victims. Obviously, members of the community 
 
 coming out to pay their respects. We've seen on the other side various flowers and teddy bears that have been set up. Of course, we know that some 
 
 of the victims in this incident were children. Obviously, we're focusing on the investigation.
 
We're focusing on the shooter and that motive but we're not losing sight of the impact this has had on the communities here. In addition to the eight 
 
 people that were killed, Becky, there are still numerous others who are recovering from gunshot wounds at this hour.
 
ANDERSON: Very tragic. Thank you. Well, Texas also on the front lines of improving border crisis in the United States. In just three days, Title 42 
 
 will expire. That's the pandemic era policy that allowed migrants to be turned away at the border quickly and towns along the border with Mexico 
 
 are already overwhelmed. You're looking at long lines in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico where thousands of people are camping out and waiting to cross as 
 
 soon as Title 42 expires.
 
Here's the governor of Texas.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOV. GREG ABBOTT (R-TX): Right now, as we're speaking, the Texas National Guard is loading Blackhawk helicopters and C-130s. Deploying specially 
 
 trained National Guard members for the Texas Tactical Border Force. They will be deployed to hotspots along the border to intercept, to repel and to 
 
 turn back migrants who are trying to enter Texas illegally.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, on Sunday in Brownsville, Texas and SUV plowed into a crowd of people outside of homeless shelter. Housing migrants, eight people were 
 
 killed. The terrifying moment was caught in surveillance video. You can see just how fast the car was going before it hit those people.
 
CNN's Gustavo Valdez is just south of Texas with a look at how migrants are coping. What's the view there? What's the perspective there?
 
GUSTAVO VALDES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Becky. Well, you can see we are about 100 meters from the Rio Grande border with the United States. This is 
 
 one of few camps that have been set up in Ciudad Juarez by migrants. Most of them tell me they have already been deported. They tried to go in, 
 
 surrender to authorities and they were quickly sent back to the Mexican side.
 
And now they're hoping that after Title 42 ends, they get another chance to cross and get an opportunity to present their case. The incident in 
 
 Brownsville is very much in the mind of these migrants. They've been sharing those images you just showed because they fear now what could 
 
 happen to them on the U.S. side. They fear the incident in Brownsville is another case of violence against migrants because of the rhetoric against 
 
 them.
 
And they feel that they could also be in danger. However, it's safer in the American side than it is in Mexico. Many of them are already setting camp 
 
 on the U.S. side of the border on -- let's call it, no man's land even though it's already U.S. territory. But there is a section of land before 
 
 between the river and the border wall where yesterday we witnessed hundreds of migrants already waiting to be the first in line and have an opportunity 
 
 to turn themselves in.
 
Their conditions there are also critical. They tell me they've been -- they spent days without water and food and yesterday we still have a couple of 
 
 women collapse with no medical attention or help from either side of the border coming anytime. So, the situation is severe. The authorities here in 
 
 Chihuahua, Ciudad Juarez, they expect about 20 to 30,000 migrants to come out of the shadows in the next few days.
 
This same situation is going coast to coast from Tijuana to Matamoros.
 
ANDERSON: Gustavo, appreciate it. Thank you.
 
Still to come. Britain comes together for coronation weekend after days of pageantry and picnics. Why today is all about doing one's bit.

ANDERSON: Well, the stars came out to celebrate the coronation of King Charles III. Lionel Richie there. Global ambassador for the Prince's Trust 
 
 among the performers Sunday's concert at Windsor Castle. The event even saw the monarch himself getting down with the music. Many observers say Prince 
 
 William stole the show with a touching tribute to his dad.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
WILLIAM, PRINCE OF WALES: For all these celebrations, our magnificence at the heart of the pageantry is a simple message. Service. My father's first 
 
 words on entering Westminster Abbey yesterday were a pledge of service. It was a pledge to continue to serve because for over 50 years, in every 
 
 corner of the U.K., across the Commonwealth and around the world, he has dedicated himself to serve others. Pa, we are all so proud of you.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: From pop music to pageantry and to picnics. Coronation weekend, the chance for Britain to come together and celebrate. And it isn't over 
 
 yet. Today, it's all about doing one's bit as people across the U.K. are being invited to volunteer in the big help out as it's known like the 
 
 Prince and Princess of Wales here. Helping to renovate a scout hut with their young son.
 
This day of pitching in is also a chance to work off all those big lunch Sunday Street parties. CNN's Anna Stewart went in search of cake and this 
 
 is what she found.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER (voice-over): Tea, scones are right royal knees up. On Sunday, tens of thousands came together at street parties across the 
 
 U.K. What better way to celebrate the glittering coronation of King Charles. Braving the British weather in honor of a new monarch. The Prince 
 
 and Princess of Wales mingled among the crowds outside Windsor Castle. Street parties have become a mainstay of royal events, particularly during 
 
 the reign of Elizabeth II.
 
According to the new king and queen, Sundays so called big lunch is an attempt to keep that spirit alive. An opportunity to spend time and 
 
 celebrate with friends, families and communities. 
 
CATHERINE, PRINCESS OF WALES: You have fun time. Yes. Enjoy your afternoon.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: People just want to come together as a community and celebrate.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I came to celebrate. I thought it was -- saw it was a nice picnic and thought come with my friends, meet some new people.
 
STEWART: With Monday, declared a public holiday, party goers can let loose without worrying about the hangover. No stranger to parties. Downing Street 
 
 held a street party of its own hosted by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. The guest list included community volunteers, Ukrainian refugees and First Lady 
 
 Jill Biden.

ANDERSON: That's the story in the U.K. for you.
 
Ethnic clashes in northeastern India have forced thousands of people to flee their homes. We'll get you to the region for a look at what is behind 
 
 what is the deadly violence. That is coming up.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:32:27]
 
CHURCH: Welcome back. I'm Becky Anderson in Abu Dhabi. You're watching CONNECT THE WORLD. Time here is just after half past 6:00. Your headlines 
 
 this hour. China says its relationship with the U.S. is "on ice." Beijing is urging Washington to stop condoning what it calls Taiwan's separatist 
 
 forces. China's Foreign Minister sat down earlier with the U.S. ambassador in Beijing.
 
French police banned protests in parts of Paris and Lyon ahead of President Emmanuel Macron's attendance at World War II Victory Day event. The wreath 
 
 at Arc de Triomphe in Paris earlier. Protesters have disrupted appearances by other government officials in recent weeks over France's controversial 
 
 pension reform.
 
For the first time, the two sides fighting for control of Sudan are holding talks aimed at bringing the conflict to an end. Representatives from each 
 
 side met over the weekend in Saudi Arabia. Pre-negotiation talks started Saturday, but there's been no update on their progress since then. 
 
Well, at least 58 people have been killed and hundreds more have been hospitalized amid ethnic violence in the Indian state of Manipur. Well, 
 
 authorities says as many as 23,000 people have fled their homes since violence broke out last week. The Indian Army has been deployed to the 
 
 region to contain the violence. CNN's Vedika Sud is following the developments from New Delhi.
 
For many who will be unaware of where this region is. And the makeup as it were, the profile of this region, just explain some context to where we are 
 
 at here.
 
VEDIKA SUD, CNN REPORTER: Of course, Becky. So, Manipur is a northeastern state in India. It shares a border with Myanmar and I'm going to come back 
 
 to the significance of sharing that border with Myanmar in a moment from now. But ever since the clashes last week, it's actually left behind a 
 
 whole trail of destruction and fear. The fear of reprisal and of course, you've seen buildings being torched, cars being torched, arson and loot 
 
 that followed post the clashes.
 
It took the center to send the Indian Army in Central Security Forces in to bring the situation under control which now the state government claims it 
 
 is -- it's limping back to normalcy, according to the Chief Minister of Manipur. Very quickly, let me just tell you about these two groups that 
 
 clash. One is a tribal group. It's an ethnic group and the other is a non- tribal ethnic group which constitutes of Hindus.
 <br>[10:35:02]
 
And they make up about 50 percent of Manipur's three million population. Now this group, the majority group, this community wants the status of a 
 
 tribal group which would mean that they would get some benefits by having these seats in the government in educational institutions. Basically, these 
 
 seats will be reserved for them since they belong to this group. Now, the smaller group, the Kukis who are objecting against this are -- basically 
 
 objecting because they feel that they will lose out to the majority community which is known as the Meiteis.
 
Here's what really happened over the whole of last week. And here's where the situation stands in Manipur as I speak to you.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SUD (voice-over): Inferno in the hillsides of northeast India. Churches under fire and angry armed mobs on the streets. Thousands of residents 
 
 forced to flee their homes as ethnic violence breaks out on India's Manipur estate. Located on the Indian-Myanmar border, it has for decades struggled 
 
 with insurgencies and violence between Christian and Hindu ethnic groups.
 
Tensions boiled over last week when thousands of people from the Christian hill tribes protested against the majority Hindu ethnic group potentially 
 
 gaining official tribe status. 
 
Dozens of people have been killed and several hundred hospitalized. The government has shut down internet access and security forces have been 
 
 deployed to end the violence. But sporadic fighting continues. Forcing more than 20,000 people to flee their homes with little more than clothes on the 
 
 back and the children into (INAUDIBLE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): The Kuki militants attacked after surrounding our village in Pokaw (ph). They began firing at us with their 
 
 guns. We panicked and abandoned all our belongings and fled for our lives.
 
SUD: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the campaign trail this weekend has so far remained silent on the issue. But on Monday, his home minister Amit 
 
 Shah to a local media that the tribe decision will be discussed with all stakeholders.
 
Displaced residents from the hill tribe said they have no home to return to. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Every one of us here, we are nervous. We are afraid of death.
 
SUD: Many of the displaced villagers belong to the Christian Kuki and Naga people who reside in the hills along the Burmese border. There is history 
 
 of conflict between them and the Hindu Meiteis who make up more than half of the population and dominate state government. Their push to be 
 
 recognized as an official tribe to get better access to health care, education and government jobs has caused concern among the Christian groups 
 
 who believe they will be at a disadvantage.
 
While most of the fighting has now subsided, the problems at the core of this conflict remain far from resolved.

SUD: The situation, Becky, was only made worse when the coup in Myanmar took place two years ago. People fled to Manipur from Myanmar and they 
 
 belong to the smaller communities, the hill tribes that are now fighting against the Hindu community, the Meiteis. So, that has led to further 
 
 clashes, further issues between the two communities over the last two years. As of now, there's a fragile calm in Manipur. We're hoping it last. 
 
 Becky?
 
ANDERSON: Vedika Sud is on the story. Thank you.
 
Still to come tonight on CONNECT THE WORLD with me Becky Anderson. The most dominant driver on the F1 circuit back in action on Sunday. A rundown of 
 
 how he did is up next.

ANDERSON: All right. CNN World Sport is straight ahead. And the show, we'll be having a look at a driver whose victory has become so inevitable. Some 
 
 fans, Patrick Snell, even booed. What's the story here?
 
PATRICK SNELL, CNN WORLD SPORT ANCHOR: Hi, Becky. Yes. I guess when you're a serial winner, like Max Verstappen everyone wants a piece of you, right? 
 
 And I think Formula One fans, they're very partisan. You know, they want their guy to win. They want their team to win. And Verstappen is just doing 
 
 what he does best. And I think that actually is a source of motivation to him as third victory of the season. He's won back-to-back Miami Grand Prix 
 
 now. 
 
There's only ever been two at the Miami Grand Prix. He's going for a third consecutive drivers title as well. I will say his Red Bull teammates Sergio 
 
 Perez is making a real challenge as best he can. He's already had victories to his name this season. It's a long season ahead though, Becky, and I 
 
 think it's going to be a very compelling one indeed. But that's the key line here. Verstappen looking for a third straight driver's title.
 
And by the way, three races, three Grand Prix is in the U.S. this year as well. Austin and Las Vegas to come. Back to you.
 
ANDERSON: Yes. Amazing stuff. And of course, we are close out the season here in Abu Dhabi. Good. "WORLD SPORT" is up next. You're watching CNN.
