ANNA COREN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Welcome to all of you watching around the world. I'm Anna Coren live from Hong Kong.
 
Ahead on "CNN Newsroom". For six months of war in Gaza and calls are growing for the ouster of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Details of the latest protests and whether more aid could soon reach the people of Gaza.
 
Meanwhile, survivors of the October 7th massacre in Israel are reuniting and revisiting their shared experience. What they say about their healing journey and what lies ahead.
 
And the U.S. is on high alert, anticipating an attack on U.S. or Israeli assets. The latest threat from Iran's top general after a deadly strike in Syria.
 
The Israeli military says, it recovered the body of hostage Elad Katzir in Gaza and returned it to his family. Katzir's family says he was alive and seen in photos after he was kidnapped. Now, they're demanding that Israel do more to bring home all of the hostages, so too are the families of a number of other hostages.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SHARON KALDERON, SISTER-IN-LAW OF ISRAEL HOSTAGE OFER KALDERON: Today, we got a very bad message about Elad Katzir. He was in -- he was hostage for three months. He could handle three months, and then they killed him. We don't know what about all the rest. This is the time, not a day more, this is the time to bring them back. All of them as soon as possible. We have to bring them back home.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COREN:  On Saturday, protesters were in the streets of Tel Aviv condemning Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, calling for new elections and for Hamas to release all of the hostages it's holding. In Northern Gaza, one hospital says, it's received badly needed supplies. It's now the main hospital there after the destruction of Al-Shifa Hospital.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DR. HUSSAM ABU SAFIYA, HEAD OF KAMAL ADWAN HOSPITAL (through translator):  After Al-Shifa Hospital stopped functioning, many patients arrived at Kamal Adwan Hospital which is a small hospital and we lacked medicine and supplies. We called on international organizations, including the World Health Organization, and thank God, today we received some supplies and medicine which are needed in Kamal Adwan Hospital.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COREN:  In the coming hours, Israel could open the Erez border crossing to allow more aid into Northern Gaza. You're currently looking at the Rafah Crossing into Gaza. These are live pictures. So far, most aid has gone through the Rafah crossing there in Southern Gaza.
 
Well, CNN Senior International Correspondent Ben Wedeman joins us live from Beirut. Ben, any word on that aid going through and how much should be delivered today?
 
BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  No, that's not at all clear at this point, Anna. Yesterday, the Israeli cabinet did approve the shipment of aid via the Port of Ashdod through the Erez Crossing into Northern Gaza. But keep in mind that that area of Northern Gaza has been severely impacted by Israeli shelling. It's not clear if the roads are even passable at this point.
 
And yesterday there was a CNN crew near the Erez Crossing, able to see the area very well. And they tell me they saw no effort, whatsoever, to try to make the road possible. So, when -- we don't know when that aid is going through. Certainly, the Israelis have expressed a willingness to allow it to happen, but that -- there's a large difference between an expression of willingness and actually making it happen.
 
Now, we understand through the U.N. that the Israelis have agreed to double the number of trucks going from Jordan to Gaza from 25 to 50 every day. They have also given approval for the reopening of 20 bakeries in Northern Gaza and opening up a water pipeline into Northern Gaza as well. But there again, because of the damage to the infrastructure called -- caused by Israeli bombardment, it's not even clear if that -- the water system will work.
 <br>[04:05:00]
 
So, there -- it's not at all clear whether there is going to be an immediate change in the desperate humanitarian situation in Gaza at the moment despite the American pressure on Israel, and particularly Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to make movement in that regard, to make progress in that regard. Anna.
 
COREN:  Ben, as we know, talks should resume in Egypt today for the release of hostages and a ceasefire. There certainly seems to be more pressure on Netanyahu and on Israel to do a deal following the killing of the World Central Kitchen aid workers, that very tense phone call with President Biden, and the fact that this conflict has now reached the six-month mark.
 
WEDEMAN:  Yes, what we're seeing is mounting pressure on Israel from President Biden, but also pressure from President Biden on Egypt and Qatar to get Hamas to, sort of, be willing to compromise. At the moment, Hamas is demanding a permanent ceasefire, an Israeli withdrawal from the entirety of Gaza, and a serious exchange of Palestinian prisoners and detainees in Israeli jails for the hostages.
 
So, the pressure is renewed. It does appear that there's a chance for some sort of progress, but of course, the devil is in the details. Now, we've seen, as you mentioned at the top of the show, there is mounting pressure on the Israeli prime minister from the Israeli public to make progress on a hostage deal. Keeping in -- in the position of the government of Prime Minister Netanyahu until now has been that basically military pressure will make Hamas give up the hostages.
 
But clearly as a tactic, that has not worked. The only time a significant amount of hostages in Gaza have been released is as a result of negotiations. So, perhaps I think with the world community's patience quickly running out with Israel's campaign in Gaza that perhaps this pressure will result in some sort of progress. Anna.
 
COREN:  We can only hope so. Ben Wedeman in Beirut, always good to see you. Thank you.
 
And we're getting clearer views of the massive destruction inside Gaza. This is what's left of the Al-Shifa Hospital, once Gaza's largest. It was destroyed in a two-week raid by Israeli forces. On Friday, a World Health Organization team managed to reach the medical facility. They say they encountered a wasteland, seeing at least five dead bodies, some of them exposed to the elements and the burning sun.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DR. AYADIL SAPARBEKOV, TEAM LEAD FOR HEALTH EMERGENCIES, W.H.O.:  This is what used to be the emergency department, and as you can see it's totally destroyed. You can see the total destruction everywhere. And the most important, there is a smell of sewage and of the rotten bodies around me.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COREN:  In Israel this weekend, protests condemning Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, calling for new elections and for Hamas to release all of the hostages it is holding. Well, this was the scene in Tel Aviv. Jeremy Diamond has more on the demonstrations and the police situation in Israel.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, on the eve of the six-month anniversary of the October 7th attacks, thousands of Israelis have come here to Tel Aviv to protest the government, to call for new elections. Trying to trigger Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, trying to trigger his ouster.
 
These Israelis who we've been talking to tonight, have been voicing discontent with the prime minister with his handling of the war in some instances. Others have been protesting against him and his right- wing government since before the war, going back to those judicial reform protests that took place for months right here in central Tel Aviv.
 
Now, the question is, what will all of this pressure actually lead to? The polls show that if elections were held today, Netanyahu's party would lose significant support. But there's nothing that would actually trigger immediate elections that seems to be on the immediate horizon. We have heard growing calls for elections, including from Benny Gantz, a member of the war cabinet, who is also Netanyahu's chief political rival. But it's not clear that there's anything that would trigger those elections immediately.
 
And so, for now thousands of people here today raising their voices, voicing that discontent and hoping that something will happen to trigger those new elections, and to give them a chance to see a new prime minister in office.
 
Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Tel Aviv.

 <br>[04:10:00]
 
COREN:  A top Iranian general says his country will decide how and when to respond to the Israeli strike on its embassy compound in Syria that killed seven officials, including officials from its Revolutionary Guard Corps. The chief of staff of the Iranian Armed Forces spoke at the funeral of a top commander killed in the strike. He called Monday's attack, "A suicide committed by Israel that won't remain unanswered."
 
He also issued a warning to the United States, saying the main responsibility for the Damascus attack lies with Washington. The warning comes as U.S. officials say they are bracing for a significant attack on U.S. or Israeli assets in the Middle East, perhaps as soon as this week. Well, joining me now to discuss this is Sanam Vakil, Director of the Middle East and North Africa Programme at Chatham House in London. Sanam, great to see you. There has been this long-standing shadow war between Israel and Iran, but this latest strike certainly feels like a definitive escalation, considering everything else that is happening in the region. How do you expect Iran to respond?
 
SANAM VAKIL, DIRECTOR, MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA PROGRAMME, CHATHAM HOUSE:  Good to see you, and thank you for having me. This latest strike is indeed a very brazen escalation. Since October 7th, Israel is waging an open war against Hamas on Gaza, but behind the scenes, it has been trying to push back and degrade Iran's support for the Axis of Resistance in Lebanon, in Iraq, and in Syria. These groups sit on Israel's border and pose really existential long-term security threat.
 
The attack on the embassy in Damascus a few days ago which saw high level IRGC commanders killed is the latest in a series of escalations, looking to take out Iran's operational capacity and support for these groups across the region. I fully expect Iran to respond, but it's important to note that since October 7th, Iran has been very consistent in saying that it doesn't want to be part of a broader regional war. So, this response will be very targeted.
 
COREN:  Iranian leaders certainly vowed retribution. As we said, the commander in chief of its armed forces said Iran would determine the time, place and method of the operation designed to inflict, "Maximum damage" on the enemy to make it regret its action. I mean, it certainly sounds incredibly ominous. What are Iran's options?
 
VAKIL:  Well, Iran is actually in quite a difficult position because it needs to respond in order to show that it still has deterrent capability. In fact, over the past six months, there has been criticism or surprise that Iran hasn't come to the defense of Hamas or the Axis of Resistance more broadly.
 
But in this case, with such high-level figures being killed, Iran has to show that it still got skin in the game and it can still protect its interest. It has to be very careful though because if it directly responds, it risks an Israeli counterresponse, if not an American one. And Iran is looking to make sure that we don't get into a broader regional war. Iran's goals are longer. And it is fully anticipating that Israeli-Iranian tensions will continue to escalate even after the war in Gaza comes to an end.
 
COREN:  I mean, do you fear that with a potential miscalculation, this could lead to a broader conflict, you know, worst case scenario, a full-blown war?
 
VAKIL:  Certainly, this is the most dangerous moment for a broader regional war. And I think that's why Iran is trying to message behind the scenes, using contacts across the Gulf to make it clear to Washington and Israel what it intends to do.
 
Iran is using rhetorical language to try to build up anticipation and pressure on Israel, if not also the United States. But I think that Iran, itself, cannot directly be militarily involved and it will rely on the Axis of Resistance, be it Hezbollah, groups in Iraq and Syria, to make targeted attacks rather than be directly involved itself.
 
COREN:  So now, let me ask you this. I mean, how would the U.S. respond to an attack on Israel or its forces in the region by Iran?
 
VAKIL:  Well, again, it depends on where, when and how Iran launches the attack or its proxies launch the attack. I -- if a barrage of attacks come on to Israel, and there's significant loss of life, this could be the domino effect that we're all deeply worried about and that could lead to then a counterresponse, and then we're sort of, already in the regional war.
 <br>[04:15:00]
 
In January of 2020, The United States killed Iran's senior Quds force commander of the IRGC Qasem Soleimani, and that was a very tense moment. And Iran responded to that attack by launching the biggest barrage of rocket -- missiles, sorry, on an American air base in Iraq. But it did give advance warning and nobody was miraculously killed in that attack. So, it just depends on how careful and calibrated and targeted the attack will be.
 
Iran can also respond using cyber-attacks, as well as escalate its nuclear program, which is also unchecked and a point of tension between Israel and the United States. But I think that the access of resistance is the area where Iran will respond because that will show that the axis is still operational and still has capabilities, and it will try to embarrass Israel by using the Axis of Resistance in a meaningful way.
 
COREN:  Sanam Vakil, great to get your insights. Thanks so much for joining us.
 
VAKIL:  Thank you.
 
COREN:  Well still to come, tensions dramatically escalate between Ecuador and Mexico following a raid on Mexico's embassy. How world leaders are reacting.
 
Plus, Russian missiles rained down on multiple cities in Ukraine, leaving behind a trail of death and destruction.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
COREN:  There's growing condemnation following a raid on Mexico's embassy in Ecuador to arrest a former Ecuadorian vice president. The United Nations Secretary General says, he's alarmed. While leaders from Latin American countries condemned the raid, expressing solidarity with Mexico.
 
Nicaragua said it would break all diplomatic ties with Ecuador. Ecuadorian police entered Mexico's embassy Friday to arrest Jorge Glas. He had been sheltering there since December and was granted political asylum on Friday. Glas has been convicted twice on corruption charges, which he says are politically motivated. Mexico has denounced the raid, calling it barbaric and an outrage against international law. Ecuador says, the raid was carried out because there was a real risk that Glas could have escaped.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GABRIELA SOMMERFELD, ECUADORIAN FOREIGN MINISTER (through translator): A decision of the President of the Republic was taken in the face of a real risk of imminent escape of the citizen wanted by justice. The Mexican Embassy by receiving Mr. Glas Espinel contributed to the failure to comply with the obligation to appear weekly before the judicial authority, thus affecting Ecuador's democratic institutions.
 <br>[04:20:00]
 
Clearly, contravening the fundamental principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other states.

COREN:  On Sunday night, Mexico's presidential hopefuls will hold their first debate ahead of general elections in June. It's sure to be a remarkable election. The two leading candidates are women, so it's likely that Mexico will soon have its first female president. They will be making their cases to voters about how they see the future of the country and the future of Mexico's relationship with the U.S.
 
CNN's Gustavo Valdes has the details.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CLAUDIA SHEINBAUM, MEXICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  (Speaking in a foreign language).
 
GUSTAVO VALDES, CNN REPORTER (voiceover):  Claudia Sheinbaum wants to make history as Mexico's first female president.
 
SHEINBAUM:  (Speaking in a foreign language).
 
VALDES (voice-over):  She has a comfortable lead in the polls running as the candidate of the ruling party, Morena.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (Speaking in a foreign language).
 
VALDES (voice-over):  Her main challenger is Xochitl Galvez, who represents a coalition of opposition parties. Jorge Alvarez Maynez, a former congressman, is in a distant third place. Whoever wins the June election will shape the future of the Mexico-U.S. relationship.
 
DUNCAN WOOD, MEXICAN INSTITUTE, WILSON CENTER:  There is no bilateral relationship in the world that matters more to the lives of Americans than the relationship with Mexico.
 
VALDES (voice-over):  Duncan Wood is senior advisor of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center in Washington. He says it's not surprising that border-related issues, like, trade and drug trafficking are key, with migration being top of the list.
 
WOOD:  Making sure that Mexico continues to be a good partner on migration will be very, very important and absolute priority.
 
SHEINBAUM:  (Speaking in a foreign language).
 
VALDES (voice-over):  Claudia Sheinbaum makes no secret that she would continue the leftist, nationalist, populist policies of current President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.
 
SHEINBAUM:  (Speaking in a foreign language).
 
VALDES (voice-over):  Favoring coordination over subordination. But Wood says Mexico's cooperation with the United States has not been the best in recent years.
 
WOOD:  U.S. government officials feel as though there has been an under-investment in the relationship by the Mexican government over the past six years.
 
Andres Manuel. I have the impression that I blackmailed the government.
 
XOCHITL GALVEZ, MEXICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  (Speaking in a foreign language).
 
VALDES (voice-over):  Xochitl Galvez believed that the Mexican president has used migration to blackmail the United States, threatening to facilitate the transit of migrants who wants to get to the States whenever American officials say or do something he doesn't like. She vows to engage in meaningful negotiations with the White House.
 
WOOD:  We're looking at a much more open approach to bilateral relations, a return to a more institutional approach.
 
VALDES:  Also in play, the future relationship of Mexico with China as Beijing continues to increase its investments in Latin America.
 
WOOD:  And it offers an opportunity for Mexico, perhaps, to diversify a little bit away from the United States. It presents a risk, perhaps, to Washington as well, and it's being observed very closely here.
 
VALDES (voice-over):  But Mexican voters are not the only ones who will decide the future of the binational relationship. Whoever wins the November elections in the United States and his personal relationship with the next Mexican president will be also a big factor.
 
Jorge Martinez, professor of economics at Monterrey Technical Institute says that one thing is perception and another reality. He says, perception is that Trump would have a more adversary relationship with Mexico given his rhetoric, but he managed to negotiate a new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada. In the end, the tone of the binational relationship might be defined by the personalities of the next presidents.

COREN:  U.S. President Joe Biden raised more than $90 million in March for his re-election campaign, significantly more than his Republican rival, Donald Trump. Mr. Biden's campaign says, he now has a whopping $192 million in cash on hand. The campaign says, that makes it, "The highest total amassed by any Democratic candidate in history at this point in the election cycle."
 
Trump's campaign, meanwhile, raised more than 65 million last month and had 93 million in cash on hand. But his campaign says, Trump raised a staggering 50 million on Saturday alone at a fundraiser in Florida. They say that was a record for a single fundraising event.
 
Slovakia's pro-Russian Prime Minister will soon have an ally in the presidential office. Ukraine-skeptic Peter Pellegrini won Saturday's presidential election, getting about 53 percent of the vote. He beat his pro-Western opponent, Ivan Korcok. Pellegrini's party is included in a coalition led by Prime Minister Robert Fico.
 <br>[04:25:00]
 
The Prime Minister stopped supplying weapons to Ukraine since taking power last October, and he raised concerns about the rule of law with his proposed reforms of the media and criminal justice system. But for Mr. Fico, Pellegrini's victory is a stamp of approval.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ROBERT FICO, SLOVAKIAN PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  Today, the people of Slovakia have demonstrated their awareness of the threats posed to our country by liberal media, activists, non- governmental organizations, and professionals. The presence of these individuals was not coincidental. Rather, it stemmed from genuine concern about the direction our country might take if such entities were to wield power.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COREN:  Well, Ukraine is reeling from a barrage of Russian strikes that hit at least three cities. Officials say, Kharkiv was struck Saturday afternoon on the heels of a similar attack just hours earlier. At least seven people were killed in those strikes and 14 others injured. The city of Odessa took missile fire as well on Saturday, which left one person dead.
 
Well, Russian missiles also took aim at Zaporizhzhia for a second straight day but didn't cause any casualties this time. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is calling for Ukraine's allies to help it strengthen air defenses around Kharkiv.
 
In the last hour, I spoke with Mick Ryan, a retired major general of the Australian army who was in Ukraine this week. I asked him to describe the mood in the country now that Russia is turning up the military pressure.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAJ. GEN. MICK RYAN, AUSTRALIAN ARMY (RET.):  I would describe the mood as one of concern. They are very worried about Russia's potential mobilization, building additional forces for ground combat. But in particular, this campaign of enhanced strikes against Ukrainian cities, which is designed primarily to terrorize the Ukrainian population and force further dislocations of their lives and force the Ukrainian population to move further west.
 
COREN:  We just mentioned those strikes on Kharkiv. Russia has also been pounding Ukraine's infrastructure in recent weeks. And there is this strong sense that Russia is gearing up for a big new offensive. I mean, how will Ukraine withstand this push by Russia if that $61 billion U.S. aid package isn't passed through Congress?
 
RYAN:  Well, we -- it will be very difficult. The Ukrainians believe they can hold this year, but the Russians have a significant advantage in them at the moment. They're able to recruit around 30,000 people per month at the moment, according to British intelligence. It's possible they will undertake another mobilization of around 300,000 people. This will set them up for some form of large-scale offensive in the back half of the year, which will comprise a real danger time for the Ukrainians.
 
COREN:  Ukraine, as we know, desperately needs weapons, munitions, air defense systems. Russia is reportedly firing at least five times as many artillery rounds as Ukraine. Knowing this and the recent losses on the battlefield, what is Ukraine hoping to achieve in the months ahead? Is it, you know, holding ground or is there a Ukrainian counteroffensive in the works?
 
RYAN:  Well, Ukraine at the moment is planning on getting through 2024 whilst reconstituting its military. The president, when he appointed General Syrskyi as the new commander in chief, not only directed a military strategy for this year, but also a transformation of the Ukrainian forces capacity to fight and building the ability to go on the offensive in 2025. So, really this is about getting through 2024, sustaining Western support, getting this big package of aid through the U.S. Congress and build the ability to go on the offensive next year.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COREN:  That was Major General Mick Ryan speaking to me last hour.
 
Well, Sunday marks six months since the Hamas attack that killed more than 1,000 people. Some of these survivors are sharing their stories with CNN's Anderson Cooper. That's next on "CNN Newsroom".
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[04:30:00]
 
COREN:  Welcome back to our viewers around the world. I'm Anna Coren in Hong Kong. This is "CNN Newsroom".
 
We're watching to see if aid to Gaza comes through the Erez Crossing from Israel. That's the route in Northern Gaza that Israel said it plans to open. So far, most supplies have gone through the Rafah Crossing in Southern Gaza. But aid groups say it's nowhere near enough as a famine looms in the region.
 
In Tel Aviv on Saturday, protesters condemned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and called for new elections. They also demanded that Hamas release all of the hostages it is holding. The IDF says, it recovered the body of hostage Elad Katzir in Gaza. His family says, he was seen alive in photos after he was kidnapped.
 
On October 7th, Hamas militants killed an estimated 364 people at the Nova Music Festival. 40 were taken hostage. Over the last six months of trauma and war, we have reported extensively on the suffering and the lives lost in Gaza and Israel, but we don't often talk about those who escaped.
 
Well, recently, a group of those who survived the massacre at the Nova Music Festival went to the U.S. for a healing retreat. CNN's Anderson Cooper shows us how they're coping.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  In California's Ojai Valley, for the next week, this Jewish sleepaway camp is home to many survivors of the Nova Music Festival massacre. 120 in all. It's the first time a group this size has gathered since October 7th.
 
DANIELLE SASI, NOVA MUSIC FESTIVAL SURVIVOR:  Every day I ask myself, why am I alive? What's the purpose?
 
COOPER (voice-over):  While most are from Israel, Danielle Sasi and Lee Sasi are from California. The cousins were visiting family and went to the festival with eight relatives, including Danielle's 65- year-old father Avi. This video was shot moments before rockets began falling. They raced to one of the fortified bus stops that serve as bomb shelters along the road by the festival.
 
D. SASI:  A blonde kid comes in, he's shot up in the leg, full of blood. He just walks in and sits in the corner. And at that very moment, I knew, my dad said, if I want to get home to my son, to stand in this corner. My dad yelled, all the guys up to the front. We won't let the terrorists in. And then it all started. It was a million bullets. Everyone was screaming, no, no, no.
 
And then in Hebrew we hear, rimon. Rimon is a grenade. When it exploded, you just feel like you are flying away from the impact of the bomb. And then they threw another grenade, and it was again. And then they walked in and started shooting everyone, and they shot me in the leg.
 <br>[04:35:00]
 
LEE SASI, NOVA MUSIC FESTIVAL SURVIVOR:  They threw a Molotov cocktail in the bomb shelter. And because there was so many bodies, dead and alive, inside there was no floor for it to land on the ground and shatter. So, they basically threw it and it created a lot of dark suffocating smoke that choked you to death.
 
D. SASI:  My husband was -- he just kept screaming that they're going to kill us and I just kind of shook him. I kissed him. I told him to go look for my dad and to put bodies on top of me. He went to my dad. He marked with his hands like a heart sign saying that he's gone, and then I went numb.
 
COOPER (voice-over):  Out of their group of eight, only four survived.
 
D. SASI:  My dad died a hero, for sure. And he promised me that I'll make it home to my son, so I kept his word.
 
COOPER (voice-over):  Everyone here carries with them the terror of that day.
 
INOR KAGANO (PH), NOVA MUSIC FESTIVAL SURVIVOR:  When you see death, it stays within your eyes. You can see it. You can see people that suffered.
 
COOPER (voice-over):  Inor Kagano (ph) was a photographer at the festival. This is him moments after the attack began.
 
KAGANO (PH):  Welcome to effing Israel. We party freedom and we have terror.
 
From the gunshots, I could recognize this is terrorist, because -- 
 
COOPER (voice-over):  He initially also drove to a bomb shelter by the road.
 
KAGANO (PH):  I remember getting inside the shelter. I can see like 50 people like standing like that. I make the decision that probably saved my life. I took my car and went away. I took with me, I think, five or six more people inside the car.
 
COOPER (voice-over):  He ended up at a kibbutz where hundreds of others had fled.
 
KAGANO (PH):  So, the citizens have arms of the kibbutz, have like shifts. So, your kind of doing patrols. So, it was civilians with arms serving us in front of the terrorists on the border of the kibbutz. Not the IDF of soldiers because they needed a lot of hours to come.
 
COOPER (voice-over):  After eight hours, he was able to escape.
 
KAGANO (PH):  There's a Greek quote that said, "Every man has two lives. The second ones begin when he understands he have only one." And we all understand that on the 7th of October. So, we kind of have a new life.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  There's going to be a poem (ph) drum circle thing that's happening today.
 
COOPER (voice-over):  Organizers hope this retreat will help people begin that new life. There's equine therapy. A therapy dog named Shani with his sidekick Juni. And there's time and space to talk with each other about what happened.
 
(MUSIC PLAYING)
 
D. SASI:  Everyone has PTSD, and it's real. So, it's just nice to be around them, knowing that you're not alone in it. I was the happiest person, I think, in the world before. Just waiting for some sunny days.
 
COOPER (voice-over):  The next day, afternoon storms create a rainbow on the horizon.
 
KARIN HEPNER, CO-CHAIR, OROT HEALING RETREAT, OROT-HEALING.ORG:  They have been through unimaginable, tragic, horrible things. I feel like they forgot what it feels like to feel safe. But if they can be reminded that who they were before, if one of these people can come here and reclaim that dream, then we've succeeded.
 
COOPER (voice-over):  As the week goes on, they do confidence building exercises. They sing.
 
(MUSIC PLAYING)
 
COOPER (voice-over):  And once again, the survivors of the Nova Music Festival join together and dance.

COREN:  And a reminder, you can catch more on the anniversary of the October 7th attack later tonight. That's when CNN sits down with family members of those taken captive and speaks directly with some of the released hostages on what they experienced.

Rwanda is marking 30 years since the 1994 genocide when an estimated 800,000 members of the Tutsi ethnic minority were slaughtered. Wreaths have been laid at the mass graves by dignitaries. Among the other events, the lighting of a flame of remembrance in the capital, Kigali, a national commemoration ceremony and a vigil.
 
Former U.S. President Bill Clinton is leading the American delegation. He was in office during the 100-day spree of murders, beheadings, and rapes by members of the Hutu ethnic majority that horrified people everywhere and led to allegations the world failed to act as the carnage unfolded.
 
Well, earlier, Rwandan Tutsi survivor Emmanuel Turaturanye told CNN of his experience. He was just 16 years old when the massacre happened. He would soon see his home attacked and nearly everyone in his family killed.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) EMMANUEL TURATURANYE, RWANDA GENOCIDE SURVIVOR:  It was 11:00, I remember just cooking food for my family with my little sister and just playing next to me. And while I was cooking, I began hearing marching and singing in the distance, and I saw a crowd of people carrying machetes, guns, clubs, and other weapons. And when they started approaching us, I scooped to my little sister and ran to save our lives.
 
The danger of this happening in my country, it was even being reported in different media outlet worldwide, and nobody did a thing. And instead of helping people, they just ran. At this moment sometime, I don't even understand.
 
It was, you know, uncles, fathers, neighbors. Just to see all those things happen, it really made me have really some negative impacts, especially on -- in my heart. When the genocide happened, the whole nation was completely destroyed. But for whatever reason, our country decides to move forward and one of the ways to move forward was to bring unity and reconciliation. Where people to come and repair and confess what they did, and also offer forgiveness.
 
So, it's not an easy thing. But I would say, not imagine if someone offends you. When you go to bed, that person is next to your pillow. And that's not a healthy way of living. So, I chose forgiveness because I wanted to amend myself and also have peace in my heart. Not always cutting grudges and resentment towards everyone.

COREN:  U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is in Beijing, holding talks on contentious trade issues between the U.S. and China. She paid a visit to one of the city's universities a short time ago. Yellen also met with China's premier on overcapacity in the world's second largest economy. That's a concern that China could flood the market with cheap products and make it impossible for other countries to compete in emerging industries like battery production. Chinese state media say, Beijing responded to her concerns and pushed back against U.S. economic and trade restrictions.
 
Well, climate activist Greta Thunberg was arrested twice Saturday during a protest in The Hague.

Here's what Thunberg told journalists while demonstrating.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GRETA THUNBERG, CLIMATE ACTIVIST:  We are here because we are facing an existential crisis. We are in a planetary emergency. And we are not going to stand by and let people lose their lives and livelihood and be forced to become climate refugees when we can do something.

COREN:  Police in Vermont are asking the public to help identify a suspect wanted in connection with a fire at the office of Senator Bernie Sanders. It happened early Friday morning in the town of Burlington. Police say, the man sprayed an accelerant on the door to the office, lit it, and then took off.
 
CNN's Polo Sandoval has the details.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, police in Burlington, Vermont are still working to track down who they believe is their arson suspect. In fact, they released a fairly clear picture, hoping to generate some leads. Police say that their suspect entered the Burlington, Vermont building on Friday morning. They say that he allegedly sprayed some sort of accelerant at the entrance to Senator Sanders' office and then lit the fire with staffers inside.
 
Now, fortunately, the building's fire suppression system, mainly the sprinklers, were able to kick in and extinguished most of those flames. Fortunately, no injuries reported. Damage reportedly fairly minimal. And also, Senator Sanders was not in the office at the time. The senator's office is actually located a multi-story, multi-office building.
 
The Burlington Fire Department battalion chief telling my colleague Maria Campanelli (ph) that they're still unsure how the suspect was actually able to access that space. The battalion chief adding that the building is supposed to be secured, not generally open to the public. So, there's still some questions about that.
 
The United States Capitol Police along with the Senate sergeant at arms working with local authorities as they investigate, though they still have not been able to determine a motive. It's important to point out that the U.S. Capitol Police investigated more than 8,000 threats against lawmakers in 2023, and that is a figure that is up from the previous year. So, no threats against lawmakers are certainly not new. It is certainly an alarming incident.

COREN:  A bar fight just outside of Miami, Florida turned deadly on Saturday, when a gunman opened fire during a late-night altercation, killing the security guard who tried to intervene. Nine people, including a police officer and the bar's owner, suffered gunshot wounds. Of the six bystanders shot, two are in critical condition. The other four are in stable condition. The injured officer is expected to be OK, that's according to the police chief.
 
Well, the son of rapper, producer and businessman Sean "Diddy" Combs is facing sexual assault allegations in a new lawsuit that names both men. The lawsuit cites an audio recording on a yacht where the alleged assault began. CNN's Camila Bernal has the details.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CAMILA BERNAL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  In this audio, which CNN has listened to, you can hear the accuser who says she was being forced to take a tequila shot. Now, she believes this shot was laced with drugs. And in the audio, you can hear her asking if she's being drugged. She's asking Christian Combs, and his answer is, take the shot.
 
She claims that shortly after that she was physically abused. She says she was cornered in a room and says, the abuse became aggressive. He grabbed her by the arm and then attempted to force himself on her.
 <br>[04:50:00]
 
Now, the accuser was a crew member on the yacht. And so, another crew member, according to this lawsuit, came in and stopped the abuse at some point.
 
Here is what the attorney is saying, Defendant Sean Combs turned what was sold as a wholesome family excursion into a hedonistic environment. It resulted in an unexpected increase in workload for her and for her colleagues, as well as unwanted exposure to unlawful drug use, sex work, and general chaos.
 
Now, it is important to make clear that "Diddy" is not accused of sexual assault. He's accused of liability and aiding and abetting. An attorney for both men released a statement saying this, this complaint is filed with manufactured lies and irrelevant facts. Then they went on to say, we will be filing a motion to dismiss these outrageous claims.
 
These are allegations that, of course, both men are denying. So, we'll have to wait and see what happens in court if it gets to that point. Camila Bernal, CNN, Los Angeles.

COREN:  The total solar eclipse is almost here. Although Monday's forecast is less than ideal for many cities along the Path of Totality across North America, it's not stopping the millions of tourists making their way in hopes of catching a glimpse of what could be a once-in-a-lifetime event.
 
Our Harry Enten reports from Niagara Falls.

HARRY ENTEN, CNN SENIOR DATE REPORTER:  The eclipse is getting closer and closer to hitting western New York. But the big question ahead of Monday's solar eclipse is whether or not when visitors use these glasses or those like them to look up at the sun, whether they will be seeing a mostly sunny, partly sunny or mostly cloudy sky.
 
Now, I put on my weatherman cap and the truth is I don't have an answer for you. You're just going to have to wait and stay tuned. But there's one thing we're sure about, and that is many people are visiting the area. We know that from speaking with a bunch of folks, including this family from New Jersey.
 
LAUREN BODNER, TRAVELED FROM NEW JERSEY TO SEE ECLIPSE:  We're here to check out the falls today and the solar eclipse on Monday.
 
ENTEN:  What drew you to the falls or the eclipse? Why the falls or the eclipse?
 
RYAN BODNER, TRAVELED FROM NEW JERSEY TO SEE ECLIPSE:  She's a science teacher, 8th grade, so -- 
 
L. BODNER:  The falls is right in the Path of Totality. So, we had to come and check out the falls.
 
R. BODNER:  And -- well, you also didn't mention that we're going to go see all the national parks. So, like we're really like outdoor enthusiasts. We brought up our R.V. So -- like we couldn't miss this up. We already put the sticker already on the R.V. So, like we're not going to miss this event, so.
 
ENTEN:  And as a science teacher, what do you teach in science? Is it anywhere related to the fact that we're in the Path of Totality?
 
L. BODNER:  Absolutely. I teach earth and space science.
 
ENTEN:  Oh, my God. This is right down your alley.
 
L. BODNER:  Absolutely. We just started the unit of astronomy last week.
 
ENTEN:  Oh, come on. That's -- it's almost like a gift from God, and now you have to get these kids so interested.
 
L. BODNER:  Yes, and they are. They were so interested to hear that they're going to actually be seeing this in real life on Monday, because then -- in New Jersey, we still get 90 percent.
 
ENTEN:  Yes.
 
L. BODNER:  So, they're really excited.
 
ENTEN:  What about the eclipse is most exciting to you?
 
L. BODNER:  Just that it's such a rare event. It's almost a once-in-a- lifetime event. [04:55:00]
 
ENTEN:  That's what we're hearing a lot from folks here around Niagara Falls. That this is a once-in-a-lifetime event that folks simply put, don't want to miss.

And who better to throw an eclipse party than the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?
 
The storied institution says, they will be deejaying all day Monday. And for those who can't make it to Cleveland, not to fear, they have put together an eight-hour Spotify playlist to serve as a soundtrack to your eclipse celebration wherever you may be.
 
We're waiting to see if anyone has won the huge $1.3 billion Powerball jackpot in the U.S. Last night's drawing was delayed for several hours over a technical issue. The winning numbers are now in, but officials are still checking to see if any winning tickets were sold. The jackpot is the fourth largest in the Powerball history, and eighth largest among U.S. lottery jackpots. And that $1.3 billion total, that's before taxes.
 
We are hours away from the NCAA women's basketball tournament final between Iowa and South Carolina. Iowa superstar Caitlin Clark says, winning that title would be the cherry on the top for her celebrated college career. But for now, the Iowa guard is focused on the task at hand as her team prepares to take on the Gamecocks.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CAITLIN CLARK, IOWA HAWKEYES:  We've had a couple tough losses and I think that's what's made us ready for these types of moments. And then, you know, I think this matchup is, you know, you can't ask for anything better. I think it speaks to the way women's basketball has just been tremendous on all levels all throughout the year. And, you know, we know we have our hands full. Everybody around the country knows South Carolina has been the team all year. But, you know, this is -- we have five people on our team that, you know, this is the last time you're going to put on your college uniform. So, I don't think you need much more motivation than that.
