(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BECKY ANDERSON, CNN HOST, CONNECT THE WORLD: Well, this is CNN Jeddah, where regional foreign ministers are meeting. It is 04:00 p.m. there in 
 
 Saudi it's 02:00 p.m. in London, where I am. I'm Becky Anderson. This is "Connect World". Also, over the next two hours, Governor Tim Walz has made 
 
 his debut as Kamala Harris's VP pick as Donald Trump goes on the attack. 
 
The UK braces for another day of violence and protests. And Boeing's top quality control executives facing a second day in front of the National 
 
 Transportation Safety Board in the United States about a door plug blow out.
 
And the stock market in New York will open in about 30 minutes from now. We are midway through the trading week, and what a week it has been? That is 
 
 what the futures markets are indicating on the opening back there half an hour from now, at 09:30 New York Time. 
 
Well, the prospect of a wider war in the Middle East is front and center today as regional foreign ministers meet in Saudi Arabia. Today's 
 
 extraordinary meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation called at the request of Iran, which has vowed retaliation against Israel for the 
 
 assassination of the Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh a week ago in Tehran. Iran is presumably seeking backing for a response, even as 
 
 diplomats worked furiously to de-escalate tensions. 
 
Well, an added complication Hamas naming Yahya Sinwar, one of the masterminds of the October 7th massacre in Israel, as the new head of its 
 
 political bureau. We've got a lot to unpack here. CNN's Nic Robertson on the ground in Jeddah, at the site of that OIC meeting. Ben Wedeman is in 
 
 Lebanon, where the Hezbollah leader is also vowing retaliation against Israel. Nic, let's start with you. Just explain the significance of the 
 
 meeting where you are today, in Jeddah, and what could come out of this?
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Yeah, it's significant because the Organization of Islamic Cooperation 57 different states, 40 -- 
 
 48 of them Muslim majority countries. They represent, if you will, the sort of bulk of nations that have the issues and the cares, if you will, of the 
 
 Muslim population around the world.
 
At heart and what Iran is proposing here at this emergency meeting, where we understand there are more than 50 foreign ministers attending and just 
 
 watching through the window there, and some of them are still arriving here. We're expecting an opening statement when they arrive. But what Iran 
 
 is trying to -- what Iran is hoping to do here --
 
ANDERSON: Let me stop you just for a moment. Your audio isn't very good, and I want your technical guys just to try and make that better, because 
 
 what you're talking about is so significant here. So, let's just give you a couple of minutes to see if you can sort out that audio. 
 
I want to bring in Ben. I know Ben, having talked to sources that what is being taken into this meeting, and I know Nic will talk more on this when 
 
 we get him back, is at the heart of everything that is going on in the Middle East today.
 
The continuation of the conflict in Gaza, and much of the discussion around that table in Jeddah is going to be about how the international community 
 
 can try and affect a cease fire in Gaza as soon as possible, which has been the sort of -- you know -- the at the crux of so everything else that we've 
 
 been seeing of late?
 
Hezbollah's leader has spoken to the importance of finding a cease fire in Gaza as well. He has also indicated that an attack on Israel is coming in 
 
 retaliation for not only the murder, the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, of course, a week or so ago, but very specifically, the 
 
 assassination of a senior Hezbollah leader in Beirut over the past week or so. What are you hearing there?
 
BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, what we heard from Hassan Nasrallah yesterday in his speech, which was, of course, 
 
 preceded by six breakings of the sound barrier by Israeli war planes over Beirut itself, was that the response from Hezbollah and Iran is coming.
 <br>[09:05:00]
 
He sorts of left a lot of things open for interpretation. He said that perhaps it's going to be in coordination involving Hezbollah Iran, perhaps 
 
 the Houthis, perhaps each one of them will respond by themselves. But he made the point that the fact that Hezbollah and Iran are holding off for 
 
 the moment is in itself forcing the Israelis to live on edge.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HASSAN NASRALLAH, HEZBOLLAH LEADER: A week long wait for Israel is part of the punishment, part of the response, part of the battle, because the 
 
 battle is a psychological and moral one that requires nerves.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WEDEMAN: And of course, this is what Hezbollah often does. They just let the Israelis kind of stew in their very nervous juices before they finally 
 
 actually decide to respond. Now during his speech, he also stressed that Hezbollah's goal at this point is not the destruction of Israel. It's to 
 
 prevent an Israeli victory in Gaza. 
 
And he warned basically the entire Arab World that if Israel is allowed to be triumphant in Gaza, that it will be a problem for the entire Arab and 
 
 perhaps Muslim World as a result. He also brushed off the American attempts to bring about some sort of end to the fighting in Gaza. 
 
He said it's sheer hypocrisy that, on the one hand, the United States talks about trying to bring about a cease fire in Gaza and perhaps even 
 
 reconstructing Gaza at the same time that the United States has steadily supplied Israel with the means to conduct that war and certainly, that is 
 
 something that is not just the opinion of Hassan Nasrallah.
 
But across the Middle East, there is a feeling that the United States is being very hypocritical, that you see Secretary Blinken going across the 
 
 region, meeting with everybody, calling for restraint. But at the same time that flow of weapons continues.
 
Beyond that, the situation here in Lebanon continues to be quite tense. At about one o'clock local time this afternoon, four hours ago, twice, we 
 
 heard the sound barrier being broken, not over Beirut itself, but close enough to be heard quite distinctly. As far as the situation on the border 
 
 goes. Yesterday, it was quite intense. 
 
Six Hezbollah fighters were killed in Israeli strikes. And of course, as I was telling you yesterday, Hezbollah managed to fly drones all the way to 
 
 Nahariya, which is about 10 kilometers south of the border. It appears to be completely unimpeded. 
 
Now, there are conflicting reports, but it seems that perhaps the Israelis fired some sort of anti-drone weapon at one of those drones, and possibly 
 
 it actually hit a road that anti-drone projectile causing about 19 injuries. The situation is tense, but Nasralla's speech yesterday didn't 
 
 necessarily signal a desire for an immediate escalation, an immediate escalation Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Yeah. Ben, the question is, is the Middle East region in the crosshairs of a significant escalation? Iran has threatened attacks on 
 
 Israel. Its proxy in Lebanon, as you say, doing the same, although not suggesting that that is an immediate retaliation. And all of this as the 
 
 war in Gaza, at the heart of this continues with no sign of a cease fire. It's good to have you on. 
 
Let's bring Nic back from Jeddah, where the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the OIC, has called an extraordinary meeting. At the behest 
 
 Nic of Iran as it considers what it does next, and we all consider whether we are or should be expecting a serious escalation. You and I were talking 
 
 about what might come out of this meeting and its significance Nic?
 
ROBERTSON: Yeah, significant Becky, because I think if there is going to be a diplomatic off ramp that can be found for Iran. Because, as you were 
 
 saying before, Iran has said that it will respond for Israel attacking and killing Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. That is our accusation of course, Israel 
 
 has never accepted responsibility for that attack.
 <br>[09:10:00]
 
But so, in a way, Iran has painted itself into a diplomatic corner. Here you have the Organization of Islamic Cooperation 57 different nations, 48 
 
 of the Muslim majority nations. Of course, they're very concerned about the plight of Palestinians in Gaza, and that's one of the reasons that Iran has 
 
 called for this meeting. But the other reason is specifically that the killing of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.
 
Now everyone gathered around the table here knows what the stakes are. You have the Foreign Minister of Jordan. Here. You have the Saudi Foreign 
 
 Minister hosting along with the OIC Chairman. Of course, you have the Lebanese Foreign Minister. You have foreign ministers from Iraq and Iran. 
 
 The Acting Foreign Minister, Ali Bagheri, arrived here just a couple of hours ago, along with quite a big delegation, I have to say.
 
So, the stakes are really high, and it's not quite clear how that off ramp can be found or what specifically Iran is looking for? It knows it can 
 
 count on support from this organization to -- you know to tell Israel to better protect the Palestinians in Gaza. But not all these nations here are 
 
 aligned behind Iran. 
 
Iran has fired missiles across Saudi Arabia and Jordan before, when it was attacking Israel back in April. So not all these countries are aligned 
 
 where they can coalesce, and how that might bring an off ramp. At the moment, is anyone's guess. The delegations are still arriving. We're 
 
 expecting a statement soon. But it could be in a few hours we begin to learn details that may indicate, may indicate a path to a slightly de-
 
 escalation of the tensions.
 
ANDERSON: Yeah. At a minimum, these countries have coalesced around the idea, and they've been saying this since the outset of the Gaza conflict. 
 
 They've coalesced around the idea of a cease fire being absolutely imperative here, and one assumes that there will be much discussion about 
 
 how they get to that point if they believe they can as quickly as possible. 
 
But you right to say, you know that is -- that's the minimum, isn't it? That's where they sort of meet in the middle. But they are coming from 
 
 very, very different quarters as to their support or not, for Iran and its malign behavior as it's seen by many around the region in the past and 
 
 going forward. It's good to have you there Nic, extremely significant meeting, and incredibly important that we learn what comes out of that and 
 
 what happens next?
 
And in the next hour -- thank you Nic -- of Connect the World, I'll talk to the Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi in Jeddah for that emergency 
 
 meeting. He recently completed a trip to Tehran, the first such trip by a Jordanian Foreign Minister in years. Stay with us for that. 
 
Well, the discussions that we are following, of course, could have a real impact on people inside Gaza. So here on "Connect the World" we want to 
 
 take this moment to show you what is happening there right now, while the diplomats do their work.
 
This week Israel's military returned 89 bodies of Palestinians killed during the war in Khan Yunis inside a shipping container. Grieving families 
 
 left wondering if their families, their loved ones, are among the dead. Jomana Karadsheh has the story, and I have to warn you, her report contains 
 
 images that you may find disturbing.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Gazans gather around this shipping container, but it's not aid or food that's arrived from Israel. 
 
 It's dead bodies. The decomposing remains of 89 of their dead handed back by the Israeli military on Monday. Who they are? How they died, where or 
 
 when, no one knows. 
 
We were surprised to find that 13 bodies in the form of bones were placed in one bag Dr. Mohammed (ph) says some of the bodies in this container were 
 
 killed three, four or five months ago, and others more recently he says. Through the stench of death and with the little they have, forensic teams 
 
 do what they can to try to identify them, but most are unrecognizable. Still, they try to document whatever they find.
 
This new mass grave is dug for the unidentified in a cemetery where the displaced living and the dead exist side by side. By concealing information 
 
 from the families this is a new crime by the Israeli occupation this local official says. We don't know if they were exhumed from graves or if they 
 
 came from the occupations prison.
 <br>[09:15:00]
 
The Israeli military has not commented on the transfer, nor did it respond to CNN's request for comment, but it had previously admitted exhuming 
 
 bodies from Gaza cemeteries. It said it returns them after checking they're not Israeli hostages. 
 
As news of the arrival spread, crowds converged on this graveyard of Khan Yunis. There were those who were there to document possible war crimes and 
 
 those desperately hoping to find their loved ones here, the living and the dead who vanished throughout this war. 
 
Homan Mohammed (ph) has been searching everywhere for her two boys who disappeared 25 days ago. She approaches the truck describing what they were 
 
 wearing. One of them was wearing a big watch. They tell her they found one matching that description. 
 
It's her sons, she says. They tell her she can look through photos of the remains tomorrow, but all she wants is to see the body, to find her boys 
 
 and lay them to rest. She tries, before disappearing into the chaos. 
 
Ibrahim (ph) is here looking for his parents. Their graves were dug up a few months ago and their bodies went missing. He searched every hospital 
 
 and morgue to bury them once again. He believes he's found his mother's body with the same blanket he wrapped her in he says.
 
I think God loves me because I'll be able to bury my mother for a second time Ibrahim says. There are people who have not been able to retrieve the 
 
 bodies of their children from under the rubble. Smoke billows in the distance from yet another strike in this seemingly endless war that has 
 
 taken so much from so many, a war that has even stripped the dead of their dignity Jomana Karadsheh, CNN London.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON: With just 90 days to go until the U.S. election, Kamala Harris's whirlwind 2024 race for the White House kicks into high gear today with her 
 
 newly announced running mate, Tim Walz.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The new Vice President, God bless America.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, this newly energized Democratic ticket of Harris and Walz continue their campaign blitz today in the key battle ground states of 
 
 Wisconsin and Michigan. They will make fresh appeals to potential voters as they campaign against Former President Donald Trump and his running mate 
 
 J.D. Vance.
 
Let's bring in CNN's Eva McKend and Alyana Treene is in Claire, Wisconsin, where Harris and Walz will campaign at an event later today. Alayna joins 
 
 us from Washington. Good to have you both Eva. Harris and Walz head to Wisconsin, where you are, and then they travel to Michigan for campaign 
 
 events today, given what we heard last night in Philadelphia, what have we learned about their strategy at this point? What can we expect?
 
EVA MCKEND, CNN U.S. NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: Becky, they are eager to highlight the choice facing blue wall voters. So those are voters here 
 
 in Wisconsin as well as Michigan and Pennsylvania. And the governor, as a child of Midwest, expected to tell his fellow Midwesterners that the 
 
 Republican ticket, they are not like us, that they would undermine unions, that they would pursue policies that ultimately would give tax breaks to 
 
 the rich.
 
And that a Harris administration would not only work to pursue policies that would make sure Americans can get by, but really can get ahead. And 
 
 they'll maintain that they have the infrastructure in place in these states to really achieve this. So, 400 staff, 100 field offices across the region. 
 
And lastly, Becky it's really instructive to look at the policies that the Governor pursued in Minnesota, things like a generous child tax credit, 
 
 things like free college for families making under $80,000 a year. He has been able to make these policies palatable for swing voters. 
 
You know, many times Republicans might say that these policies are too costly and make them seem scary. Well, he is able to basically sell that in 
 
 his home state. Now he's going to sell these popular democratic policies on a national level, and that's how he plans to support the vice president in 
 
 this very difficult effort, with only about 90 days to go Becky.
 <br>[09:20:00]
 
ANDERSON: At least, he's going to try, of course. Eva apologies for mispronouncing your name. Thank you for that. Alayna let me bring you in 
 
 because many Americans have never heard of Tim Walz. So now the first order of business is to define him, and Republicans certainly trying to help out 
 
 with that.
 
They are painting him as dangerously liberal radical, a liberal extremist. These are some of the terms that they are using. From the Republicans 
 
 perspective, I wonder what they genuinely believe Walz actually brings to the table for Harris? 
 
And apart from that language, which I've just described, how do you expect Republicans in the first instance, and very specifically, the Trump 
 
 campaign, to go about trying to untangle any benefit Tim Walz brings to that Harris ticket?
 
ALAYNA TREENE, CNN REPORTER: I will start with the first part of your question, Becky. And what they really think. You know, they have been 
 
 struggling over the last several weeks with how to define Vice President Kamala Harris? And so, they were very eager to try and jump out and get 
 
 ahead of any sort of messaging on Walz, because they want to define him in the minds of Americans before Americans can make up their minds about him 
 
 themselves.
 
And that's how we're seeing them paint him. But I think you know in my conversations with Donald Trump's advisers, and what they'll tell me 
 
 privately is that they recognize his appeal, that he is -- you know he's from a Midwestern state. He was in Congress more of a moderate Democrat, 
 
 or, yeah, a moderate Democrat, I should say. 
 
He voted with Republicans to strengthen the border. He pushed for deficit reductions in trillions of dollars. He once had the backing of the NRA, 
 
 even though the Trump campaign is now trying to paint him as someone who is anti-gun and anti-cop. I should note that the NRA ultimately later pulled 
 
 their support of him when he became Governor.
 
But they recognize that they -- that Walz could help her with the blue wall states. The states like Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, the ones that 
 
 both campaigns believe that are vital to winning if they're going to be successful in November. 
 
However, they also believe that Walz has a lot of weaknesses. And they think that they have a lot of opposition research, which I know they have 
 
 been compiling on him for several days now, that they can use to really needle him and criticize him on. And some of those things are focusing, I'm 
 
 told, specifically on the last four years. 
 
He's been a Governor in Minnesota since 2019 but ever since he became Governor, he became more progressive. He signed one bill enshrining 
 
 abortion rights into law. He's protected gender affirming care and gender protections and rights overall. He signed a bill to expand universal gun 
 
 background checks, all things that they think they can point to.
 
And again, this is how they're going to frame him. They want to make both Harris and Walz look like radical Democrats that they're far more liberal 
 
 than the kind of presidency we saw President Joe Biden kind of rain over. And that's their overall message. 
 
Of course, they're really trying to figure out right now what is sticking with voters, particularly the more independent, conservative, leading 
 
 Republicans. That is where we're going to see a lot of these tax unfold in the coming days Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Good to have you both. Thank you very much indeed. It is going to be fascinating to watch that next 90 day run to the presidency, and we will 
 
 do it with you and our colleagues. Thank you. Well, next an un-United Kingdom, England facing a new day of division, disorder and destruction as 
 
 the far right prepares to take to the streets. And we have breaking news on the war in Ukraine that's coming up after this. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:25:00]
 
ANDERSON: We'll get you some breaking news here on CNN on the war in Ukraine Russia accusing Ukrainian troops of crossing the border into the 
 
 Kursk region in what it is calling a massive attack. Ukrainian officials aren't commenting. The acting head of the region says several 1000 people 
 
 have left the area over the past day. 
 
If confirmed, the attack would be a major development in the conflict, even if its immediate impact is limited, and we will get you a lot more on this 
 
 story in the next hour of "Connect the World" this news just coming into CNN, and we are working our sources on that.
 
Let's connect you to the United Kingdom, where I am today, which is bracing for another day of violence, with far-right groups set to turn out across 
 
 the country. Police say 6000 riot offices are on standby as they monitor dozens of potential gatherings. Now the targets are reported to be 
 
 immigration centers and law offices, with multiple rallies expected in London, something we've not yet seen during this unrest. 
 
And the Mayor of London gave an update on social media in the past few hours. He says far right groups will face the full force of the law. Nada 
 
 Bashir is in Sheffield, which is in the North of England, the scene of recent violence and clearly a strong police presence where you are Nada? 
 
 What are authorities telling you about protests expected today?
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well look, Becky, you're absolutely right. There is a high police presence. You can see around me, there is a 
 
 significant presence of riot police officers. Just over here, we've seen police officers taking one of those rioters away. 
 
The riot hasn't actually begun yet. These are small protests, if you like, happening at this stage, but there are concerns that these could evolve and 
 
 turn into riots later this evening. We have been speaking to some of those who are supportive of these more far right sentiments earlier today. They 
 
 are small in number here in the Sheffield City Center at this current point in time.
 
But if you take a look over there, there is a significant protest rally taking place in support of immigration. These are refugees' welcome 
 
 protesters taking a stand against these racist, violent, far right riots that we've been seeing, not only in the north of England, but as you 
 
 mentioned, Becky, across the country.
 
Now there is a significant police presence. They are preparing for what is anticipated to be further riots later tonight. There are riots that have 
 
 been called for across the United Kingdom, including in the capital, where you are. And because of that, there has been clear messaging from the 
 
 British government.
 
They are stepping up law enforcement across the country and across the key flashpoints where they are expecting potential riots and violence to take 
 
 place. So far, at this stage, according to authority, at least 400 people have been arrested in connection with the violence that we've been seeing 
 
 over the past days sweeping through the country. 
 
Around 100 have already been charged, some already appearing in court, even on Monday morning. So, there is real pressure now on the government to step 
 
 up, to take up action. We're certainly feeling that here, where there is that significant police presence. 
 
But as you can imagine, there is a sense of unease and among some, even fear amongst the minority and ethnic communities across the country. We 
 
 were speaking to members of the community yesterday, including members of the Muslim community. We've seen mosques across the country being targeted.
 
Some told us that they were too afraid to leave their homes. And there is a real sense of unease here in Sheffield today and across the country. There 
 
 have been some instances where workplaces have told their staff members to go home, where schools and educational facilities, including Islamic 
 
 schools, which are open over the summer holidays, have told their students not to come in today. 
 <br>[09:30:00]
 
So real concern, as you can imagine, at this stage, no real violence, but again, they are anticipated that there could be later this evening.
 
ANDERSON: Good to have you, Nada. Nada is in Sheffield. Well, as the global markets fight bounce back our fears of a U.S. recession behind this week's 
 
 turmoil, just that, more than that, unnecessary, we are going to talk to one Nobel Prize Winning Economist who thinks other factors are ultimately 
 
 to blame more on that after this. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: Welcome back. I'm Becky Anderson in London. You are watching "Connect the World". Time here just after 02:30 just after 09:30 in the 
 
 morning in New York. The markets are out of the gate in New York and reacting still to what was Monday's real significant sell off.
 
Right now, the DOW does seem to be holding steady. Global markets also on the upswing, and we are seeing a bit more of a positive feel in both the 
 
 NASDAQ and the S&amp;P 500 today. The global sell off on Monday sparked fears around the world that the world's largest economy could be headed for a 
 
 recession. 
 
But was that all that sparked the sell off? Was Monday's plunge led by recession concerns, by tech stocks or by concerning data from central 
 
 banks? Some like my next guest, have suggested that Monday's panic was one that fed on itself. 
 
Nobel Prize Winning Economist Paul Krugman poses an important question in his "The New York Times" Op-Ed, did recession fears set off this market 
 
 plunge? The more you look at the facts, in particular, which prices plunge, the less sense this story makes. 
 
And Paul here joining us today, and thank you for making the time. You also write so maybe this isn't about recession fears after all, it's about fears 
 
 that AI is another Dot.com bubble, that Nvidia is becoming the next pet Dot.com. 
 <br>[09:35:00]
 
You need to be old enough to think back to the Dot.com boom and buzz of the early 2000s of course, to get what you mean by that. The market has long 
 
 been a -- you know favoring AI. What do you genuinely, in the first instance, believe triggered the market meltdown Monday? And we've seen 
 
 these markets come back somewhat. And two what do you -- what do you genuinely believe is the appetite, the real appetite needs for AI, at this 
 
 point?
 
PAUL KRUGMAN, COLUMNIST, THE NEW YORK TIMES: OK, so the fundamental point is that I don't know what caused the market sell off, but neither do you, 
 
 neither does anybody else. The lesson from past sell offs is that often there's no particular cause or something trivial, sets it in motion, and 
 
 then people start selling because they see prices falling. 
 
That's what we saw in 1987 which this bears a lot of resemblance to, Black Monday, 1987. If you try to look at what things fell the most, well, it 
 
 would have been some tech stocks like Nvidia, Bitcoin and Japan. I'm not quite sure what the connecting thread is there.
 
But it's it -- though, if you actually look at the numbers, they look much more like people losing some of their faith in AI than they do like people 
 
 worried about a U.S. recession, which is a real concern, but that doesn't seem to be what's driving. What went on this past couple of days. Oh, any 
 
 question about AI? Yeah, sorry. 
 
ANDERSON: Go ahead. 
 
KRUGMAN: Go ahead.
 
ANDERSON: No, let me just stop you there before we go into AI in fact. Because you know you've got -- you've got central banks around the world, 
 
 but very specifically, the U.S. Fed who are trying to manage a soft landing for this U.S. economy, ensure that there is evidence of growth, while at 
 
 the same time ensuring that they can keep inflation in check. 
 
And -- you know soft land an economy in order for it to take off. You know, slowly again, once again. Do you genuinely look at the Fed and markets 
 
 around the world and central banks around the world, which of times take a lead from the U.S. central bank, and say -- and believe that they are one 
 
 doing a decent job in trying to soft land this economy and two equip with the right tools. 
 
Are we working -- you know the right tools, through monetary policy, to ensure that this, the world's largest economy, still is in good shape now 
 
 and going forward?
 
KRUGMAN: Well, we really have soft landed. If you look at measures of underlying inflation now, they're very close to the Fed's target of 2 
 
 percent. There's really nothing more to be done. Inflation is basically a victory. We beat inflation. If we look at and unemployment is still pretty 
 
 low by historical standards. The concern now is that the Fed and maybe other central banks are behind the curve. 
 
They've kept interest rates -- they haven't done any interest rate cuts for a long stretch, even as inflation has come way, way down. And you're not 
 
 supposed to wait until you're all the way there before you're supposed to skate to where the puck is going to be, not to where it is. 
 
And so, it really looks as if they've -- gotten behind the curve again. And not -- we're not in recession territory yet, but it really is a very, very 
 
 strong case that they probably should have started cutting rates a couple of months ago, and definitely should be cutting rates now.
 
ANDERSON: Question is, will they hold an emergency meeting? Will they take a steer from what's going on in these markets? Will they be forced into a 
 
 meeting ahead of the next scheduled meeting, which is six weeks from now? And is that going to be sufficient to provide some stability for these 
 
 markets, which are -- you know coming back. It has to be said. Back in July --
 
KRUGMAN: Yeah.
 
ANDERSON: -- you wrote about the role of the big tech CEOs in catapulting J.D. Vance to VP, saying that Vance is not quote here an avatar of tech 
 
 bros or bros. Many of them supporting a Trump Vance ticket due to possible cryptocurrency policies. 
 
And we've heard Donald Trump talk about Crypto and Bitcoin going forward, and his support for that. Do you believe Vance's tech backing will hurt him 
 
 in the election that could end up focused on the economy?
 
KRUGMAN: Well, the thing about the tech bros is that -- they're -- they have terrible political judgment. I mean, there's the people who, a year 
 
 ago, were all -- with Robert F Kennedy Jr.
