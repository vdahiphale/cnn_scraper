LAILA HARRAK, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Welcome to all of our viewers watching from around the world. I'm Laila Harrak.

Ahead on CNN NEWSROOM, seeking to reassure allies. The U.S. president says aid to Ukraine will keep flowing, but time is running out. I'll speak to a member of the Ukrainian Parliament. 
 
And China's travel rush. Hundreds of millions of people on the move without restrictions for the first time since the COVID pandemic. We're live in Hong Kong. 
 
And France hopes to end a pesky problem before it plays host to the Olympics. 
 
ANNOUNCER: This is CNN NEWSROOM with Laila Harrak. 
 
HARRAK: After narrowly passing a short-term spending bill to keep the government open, the U.S. now has a month and a half to come up with a new plan to fund its agencies and provide aid to Ukraine. 
 
Well, Saturday's stopgap measure did not include additional money for Kyiv, but many U.S. lawmakers say they will vote for a separate bill which would continue to support Ukraine's fight against Russia. 
 
On Sunday, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy promised victory for his country, as it honored its fallen war heroes.

HARRAK: This was the scene in Kyiv during the Defenders Day holiday. People left flowers and flags to remember those who died defending Ukraine. The E.U.'s foreign policy chief attended one of those ceremonies. He
 
 promised more help for Ukraine, after it was omitted in the latest U.S. spending bill. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOSEP BORRELL, E.U. FOREIGN POLICY CHIEF: To tell the truth, we were surprised by the fact that the last-minute agreement has taken a decision that we have to regret, deeply. I have hoped that this will not be a definitive decision, and Ukraine will continue having the support of the U.S.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
HARRAK: A hardline Republican who opposed the U.S. spending bill says he will try to oust House Speaker Kevin McCarthy after he worked with Democrats to pass the measure. Matt Gaetz told CNN that he will soon force a vote on whether to remove McCarthy, saying the Republican leader can't be trusted. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): I do intend to file a motion to vacate against Speaker McCarthy this week. I think we need to --
 
JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR: This week?
 
GAETZ: -- rip off the Band-Aid. I think we need to move on with new leadership that can be trustworthy. Look, the one thing everybody has in common is that nobody trusts Kevin McCarthy. 
 
The only way Kevin McCarthy is Speaker the House at the end of this coming week is if Democrats bail him out. 
 
REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): Yes, I'll survive. You know, this is personal with Matt. Matt voted against the most conservative ability to protect our border, secure our border. He's more interested in securing TV interviews than doing something. 
 
He wanted to push us into a shutdown, even threatening his own district, with all the military people there who would not be paid, only because he wants to take this motion. 
 
So be it. Bring it on. Let's get over with it, and let's start governing. If he's upset because he tried to push us in a shutdown, and I made sure government didn't shut down, then let's have that fight. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HARRAK: U.S. President Joe Biden has urged Republicans to pass a yearlong budget deal and authorize more aid for Ukraine immediately, saying lawmakers should stop waiting until the last minute to get things done. 
 
CNN's Arlette Saenz reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: President Biden said it's good news a government shutdown was averted.
 
SAENZ (voice-over): But he's urging lawmakers to get to work, as the next government funding deadline is about 45 days away. 
 
The president is pushing Congress and lawmakers to avoid these last- minute, down-to-the-wire negotiations as played out over the weekend. 
 
SAENZ: And what the pleasant wants to see is House Republicans stick to that budget agreement that House Speaker Kevin McCarthy had arranged with the White House last spring during the debt ceiling fight. 
 
SAENZ (voice-over): The president also lamented the brinkmanship that is occurring up on Capitol Hill and said that this down-to-the-wire talks was a, quote, "manufactured crisis" by Republicans. Take a listen. 
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I'm sick and tired of the brinkmanship, and so are the American people. There's no excuse for another crisis. Consequently, I strongly urge my Republican friends in Congress not to wait. Don't waste time as you did all summer. Pass a yearlong budget agreement. Honor the deal we made a few months ago. 
 <br>[00:05:05]
 
SAENZ (voice-over): One big question for President Biden is whether he'll be able to secure additional aid for Ukraine. The president asked for about $24 billion in funding for the war-torn country, but that was dropped from this deal that was struck over the weekend -- 
 
SAENZ: -- as there was opposition among some hardline Republicans in the House. The president is urging lawmakers to stop playing games and get this aid passed.
 
The president and House Democratic leadership have suggested that House Speaker Kevin McCarthy will be putting forward a separate vote on Ukraine aid in the coming weeks. But so far, McCarthy's office has not detailed any plan for when or how to do that, leaving many questions, and the fate of that Ukraine aid, up in the air. 
 
Arlette Saenz, CNN, the White House. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HARRAK: Well, Ukrainian officials say they're confident that overall U.S. support for their country is still strong. But they're carefully watching what happens in Washington and how it could affect future aid from other countries. 
 
CNN's Fred Pleitgen reports. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Ukrainians certainly are concerned about some of the things that have been going on in the U.S., especially in Congress there. 
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over): And certainly, they do rely very heavily on U.S. security assistance. And we've seen it on the battlefield here, in the East of the country and in the South, as well. Pretty much in all facets.
 
It starts with rifles. It starts with bullets. But then you also have larger cannons, ammunition, and all the way to surface-to-air missile systems. So the U.S. is, by far, the largest provider of arms to the Ukrainians that they then use on the battlefield.
 
So that's very important to them. 
 
PLEITGEN: But there's a second facet to this, as well, and that is the possible chilling effect that any sort of cut in U.S. security assistance could have on the U.S.'s partners, who are also giving weapons to Ukraine.
 
There's two big examples. For instance, the Germans gave multiple rocket-launching symptoms to the Ukrainians but only did so after the U.S. also gave MLRS to the Ukrainians. 
 
And also main battle tanks. The Germans allowing other countries to give Leopard 2 main battle tanks to Ukraine, doing the same, as well. But again, only after a deal --
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over): -- was reached with the Biden administration for the Biden administration to provide Abrams main battle tanks to the Ukrainians. 
 
So certainly, it could be a huge deal if the U.S. decides to curtail their security assistance for Ukraine or stop it altogether.
 
Again, the Ukrainians very much aware of that. It's quite interesting, because a spokesman for Ukraine's foreign ministry came out today --
 
PLEITGEN: -- kind of put a good face on things, saying, Look, in the end, he hopes that they will be able to work with the Biden administration to make sure that any future budget will be beneficial for Ukraine. 
 
Fred Pleitgen, CNN, in Eastern Ukraine. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HARRAK: Let's get the view now from Kyiv. Inna Sovsun, a Ukrainian Parliament member, joins me now. So good to have you with us. 
 
So a lot of people in Ukraine downplaying this setback, but is their frustration over the U.S. agreeing to a deal that dropped Ukraine funding, albeit temporarily, it seems? How much of a setback is it? Are people alarmed? INNA SOVSUN, UKRAINIAN PARLIAMENT MEMBER: Well, of course, we are
 
 alarmed, because for us, this war is literally a daily reality. I will tell you this. It's 7 in the morning here in Ukraine. We here in Kyiv woke up at 4 in the morning because of yet another air raid alert. 
 
And me and my son, who actually has a birthday day, had to relocate to the -- well, to the bathroom, so that we are not near the windows, in case there is yet another missile attack here in Kyiv. 
 
And this happens almost daily in our lives. And we are here, quite far away from the front line. 
 
The reality for those who are out on the front line is even much worse. And unfortunately, our daily life consists of news from our friends, from relatives who are learning about yet another friend of ours being killed or wounded in the war. 
 
And this is, of course, very, very scary reality for all of us. And we understand that the only way to fight back is to coordinate with -- with our partners, with our friends, who share the same principles that we do, that believe in democracy and human rights. 
 
So of course, we are concerned with -- with the lack of additional funding and the situation in the U.S. right now. 
 
HARRAK: So do you feel that there is a disconnect between, you know, those harrowing experiences that you just shared with us, and what's happening, you know, an ocean away in Washington? 
 
Because President Zelenskyy was in Washington just barely two weeks ago to make the case for continued support, of a need for U.S. support. Why do you think his pleas have fallen on deaf ears? 
 
SOVSUN: Well, on the one hand, I do understand that it is very -- that it is very far away for -- for the United States. I understand that it is a very distant war. 
 
Yet it is a very close war to the U.S., as well. Because it is the war against the country that hates the United States. And I do believe that this strategic thinking should be part of the decision-making in Washington, D.C., right now. 
 <br>[00:10:08]
 
Russia hates United States. It hates everything that the U.S. is standing for. And Ukraine and Ukrainian armies, they're the only ones fighting against -- against this army which is hostile to the U.S., which is hostile to everything that the U.S. represents. 
 
I understand there is weariness of war. I wish I could say the same for us. We don't really have a choice. 
 
I understand that the U.S. has its own political reality. It has upcoming elections. And it has become part of the -- part of the political process there. 
 
I just want the U.S. to remember that there is a human cost to all of that. And that all those delays, they come at the cost of life. 
 
I actually, yesterday, before going to bed, I was reading the biography of the great American General Marshall, and when he was asked whether general separations (ph) would shorten the war, he said and I quote here, "We certainly will not shorten it by delays." That was then -- in the U.S. administration in the early 1940s. That we understand today, as well. 
 
HARRAK: Are you seeing a shift in support? Because, in another potentially ominous sign that aid for Ukraine is increasingly being politicized, Slovakia, a small country but still a member of NATO, seems to have voted in a pro-Russian politician. 
 
Do you and your fellow lawmakers feel that Ukraine's Western allies, you know, still have the willpower to stick with your country in this -- you know, in this war that is taking longer than expected? 
 
SOVSUN: Well, I think it really depends on the countries, and the context in different countries in the E.U. is, of course, different. 
 
Because for instance Germany, which has been very slow in providing support in the very beginning of the war, it is now in a very steady path in providing military aid to Ukraine. It's now the second biggest donor of military aid to Ukraine. 
 
And from what I know from German politics, it is on the right path. And the general agreement, among all political parties across the
 
 spectrum, both from the far-right and far-left, which are largely funded by Russians, of course, is supported towards Ukraine. 
 
But then, of course, in some other countries, particularly in Eastern Europe, Russians are trying to play politics and to put the people who support them in positions of power. And so we previously had Hungary which was a huge problem for us, in terms of providing not just military aid but they're also blocking sanctions against Russia, on the E.U. level.
 
Yes, Slovakia is an unfortunate development to that matter, as well. But I don't think it is -- it is yet a sign of big change coming on the level (ph) so far. But we will have to wait and see. 
 
HARRAK: Have to wait and see. I mean, President Biden, it has to be said, has said that the U.S. cannot allow support for Ukraine to be interrupted. 
 
You know, this is a very vulnerable time for your country, and you know, if Ukraine does not get the military assistance it is counting on -- and it seems there are no guarantees, really -- how does that efforts to repel Russian troops? And is there a risk that Ukraine, you know, might have to go this alone in the future? 
 
SOVSUN: Well, certainly hope it will not be the case. Because that will actually mean that Putin will win. Not necessarily on the frontline, but he will win by splitting the Western alliance. 
 
And the only thing that he is truly afraid of is this split -- the only thing that he is afraid of is unity among Western countries. So he's doing everything in his power to -- to make sure that Western parties are not united on the issue of Ukraine's war. 
 
So any decision by the Western powers not to continue funding Ukrainian war effort will actually be a victory for Putin, in itself. 
 
It will not mean that we will give up fighting, but it will be a geopolitical victory for Putin. And that is something that decision- makers in Washington should remember. 
 
He is fighting to prove that he can change the politics, the policies of Western nations, particularly the United States. And it's critically important not to allow him to do this, not to change the decisions made by -- the strategic decisions made in Washington, D.C. Because that is what Putin is pushing towards. 
 
HARRAK: Inna Sovsun, thank you so much for joining us. 
 
SOVSUN: Thank you. 
 
HARRAK: Well, the new chair of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee says he will block the release of military aid for Egypt if the country doesn't improve human rights. 
 
Senator Ben Cardin has also threatened to withhold future arms sales, saying, quote, "The government of Egypt's record on a range of critical human rights issues, good governance and the rule of law must improve if our bilateral relationship is to be sustained." 
 
Well, the announcement comes after the committee's previous chairman, Bob Menendez, was indicted on corruption charges over claims he accepted bribes to help Egypt obtain military aid. 
 <br>[00:15:11]
 
Poland is looking ahead to an election that gives voters two starkly different choices when it comes to governing the country. 
 
Massive crowds gathered in Poland's capital Sunday for a rally, while the liberal opposition is hoping the Million Hearts March can build momentum before the October 15th vote. 
 
They are framing the election as a national referendum on the conservative Law and Justice Party, which has controlled Poland since 2015, while the opposition says the ruling party is looking to leave the European Union. The Law and Justice Party denies those claims. 
 
Meanwhile, voters in neighboring Slovakia are waiting to see who will lead their next government. 
 
The party of former prime minister Robert Fico got the highest percentage of votes in Parliamentary election over the weekend. He says as prime minister, he would do everything he could to kick-start peace talks between Russian and Ukraine. 
 
He also pledged to end military aid to Ukraine and also said Slovakia has bigger problems than Ukraine. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ROBERT FICO, FORMER SLOVAK PRIME MINISTER (through translator): We think Ukraine is a huge tragedy for all, and if Smer form the cabinet, whether it has the prime minister not, we will do our best, even in the E.U., to get peace talks underway as soon as possible. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK: However, Fico's party has not secured enough votes to govern on its own and will have to form a coalition government. CNN's Scott McLean has more now on the crucial vote.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
 
SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, the man who blames Ukrainian Nazis and fascists for provoking Russia into war, has won Slovakia's election. 
 
MCLEAN (voice-over): On the campaign train, Robert Fico had pledged to cut off military aid to Ukraine if he won. Slovakia has been one of Ukraine's staunchest allies since the outset of the war, sending helicopters, artillery, and air defense systems. 
 
But Fico's basic argument is that sending weapons and ammunition only prolongs a war in which Russia will never accept defeat. And that is an appealing message in a country that is struggling with inflation, and the cost of hosting more than 100,000 Ukrainian refugees. 
 
Fico's party won by a more comfortable margin than some polls had predicted. But he will still need a governing partner in order to govern the country. 
 
And he had not ruled out pairing up with a far-right party that broadly shares his view on Russia and Ukraine, but that party didn't quite make the 5 percent threshold needed in order to take seats in Parliament. 
 
So it is more likely that he will now aim to work with the Halas (ph) Party, which has been more vague about Ukraine; on the one hand, arguing that Slovakia has given all it can afford to give; on the other hand, it says that Slovakia should continue to manufacture ammunition for Ukraine, which is ultimately good for the economy. 
 
So Fico's policy toward Ukraine and Russia is likely to be moderated out of political necessity. 
 
MCLEAN: And he has been prime minister twice before, so he has a track record of being pragmatic in order to govern. 
 
Voter turnout, by the way, the highest that it's been in 20 years. But it will likely take weeks before Slovaks ultimately find out who will be part of that coalition government. 
 
Scott McLean, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HARRAK: And to Spain now, where at least 13 people have died and several others have been injured in the country's deadliest nightclub fire in decades. 
 
The cause of the blaze, which broke out early Sunday in the Southeastern city of Murcia, is not yet you known. But officials fear the death toll could rise as search operations continue. 
 
Survivors of the fire, along with friends and family, gathered outside the club as fire crews continued their work. And Spanish prime minister Pedro Sanchez has sent his condolences to the victims' families. 
 
Turkey says it has destroyed 20 targets in Northern Iraq belonging to the PKK, just hours after the Kurdish militant group claimed responsibility for a bombing outside the Turkish Interior Ministry in Ankara. 
 
The ministry says two attackers killed a civilian and stole his vehicle. Two police officers were able to stop the attackers but were injured in the process. 
 
PKK is designated as a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States, and Europe. It has been waging an insurgency against Ankara for four decades. 
 
Still to come, fireworks light up the night sky over Victoria Harbour. We'll get a live report from Hong Kong on the tourism boom expected for China's Golden Week holiday. 
 
And in Argentina, presidential candidates take the stage for the country's first debate before this month's general election.
 <br>[00:20:00]
 
Now, one political outsider, who campaigned waving a chainsaw, is promising to shake up business as usual. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HARRAK: Candidates in Argentina squared off in the country's first presidential debate before the general election later this month. 
 
The debate is mandatory before ballots are cast three weeks from now. And if no one wins at least 45 percent of the vote, a runoff will be held next month. 
 
And recent polls show a tight race among three of the top contenders. 
 
Journalist Stefano Pozzebon joins us now with more on this. So food to have you with us, Stefano. What stood out for you with this presidential debate, and what else should we know about this race? 
 
STEFANO POZZEBON, JOURNALIST: Well, Laila, this debate was all about the economy, which is not surprising, considering the dire straits that Argentina currently finds itself into.
 
Just to think that, in August, the yearly inflation rate was over 120 percent. It was 12 percent from a previous -- from the previous month, meaning the prices were growing up considerably week after week. 
 
So the five leading contendants [SIC] -- and this is really a race between the three leading contendants [SIC], one of them, Patricia Bullrich, who is from the conservative side; Sergio Massa from the government side; and an outsider, Javier Milei. 
 
Those three traded barbs over the economy. And it was Milei that came with -- with the -- posed an interesting proposition, which is to completely dollarize the Argentinian economy. That's his pitch to voters. And to shake up the status quo would mean to completely abandon the Argentinian pesos, and take on the U.S. dollar. It's something that has never been tried. It's never been tested in a country as big as Argentina. 
 
Now Laila, Milei is famous, or notorious, infamous for appearing at political rallies brandishing a chainsaw. You can -- you can see that. The chain saw, he says, it's the symbol of the cuts that he intends to apply to public spending, and also of his intention to, as he said, shake up the status quo. 
 
Argentina has been largely dominated by the same two traditional political groups from the large parts of the 20th Century. We have a conservative bloc, which in this case, is as I was saying, led by Patricia Bullrich. And one left-wing Peronist bloc, led by the economic minister, Sergio Massa. 
 
In this year, it's new because Milei was able to wedge himself into these two contendants [SIC] with his proposal to dollarize the economy, his proposal to completely give up the Argentinian pesos in order to stop inflation and hyperinflation, which is a chronic illness for Argentina. 
 <br>[00:25:05]
 
And also, his a style of government, really seems that Argentina is also falling into the season of populism, and far-right populism that we've already seen in North America; in Brazil for example, here in Latin America; and elsewhere in Europe -- Laila. 
 
HARRAK: Stefano Pozzebon reporting. Thank you so much, Stefano. 
 
At least seven people have been killed in Northeastern Mexico after the roof of a church collapsed. Officials believe around 100 people were at the church on Sunday when it happened. 
 
At least ten were injured and taken to hospitals, about about 30 others were believed to be trapped under the rubble. 
 
Mexican National Guard units and Red Cross volunteers are on the scene to help with the search and rescue. And the week of festivities continues in China as the country marks
 
 the 74th anniversary of the People's Republic, as well as the mid- autumn festival. 
 
Hong Kong held its first National Day fireworks show in five years, with police estimating more than 400,000 locals and tourists attended. And officials say they expect nearly 900 million trips throughout the country during the eight-day holiday period. 
 
CNN's Kristie Lu Stout joins me now with more from Hong Kong. I hope that wasn't a typo.
 
But China's big holiday weekend, Kristie, is here. Will it deliver that bid economic boost for the country?
 
KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT/ANCHOR: That was not a typo, Laila. These are superlative numbers that we're talking about. 
 
China's mid-autumn Golden Week holiday is underway. This is, you know, one of the first holiday periods since the COVID-19 pandemic during which people can actually travel, now without restrictions. 
 
Nearly 900 million trips are expected to take place during this time. According to China's Ministry of Tourism and Culture, some 896 million domestic tourists will be traveling, an increase of 86 percent from the year before.
 
And revenue from domestic tourism is set to reach some $107 billion. 
 
Trains are busier than ever. In railway stations across China, you see scenes like this, scenes of a surge in domestic travel, especially railway travel. According to China Railways, some 190 million railway trips will be made during this travel rush. Around 20 million passenger trips were, in fact, made over the first day of the holiday.
 
But despite the surge in domestic travel numbers, China's overall outbound travel market is still quite low compared to pre-pandemic levels. 
 
China's outbound international flight capacity is down around 50 percent. That's much lower than other countries. And the price of the tickets, international flight fares are still much higher compared to 2019. 
 
Now, China's economy is struggling to recover after the pandemic, after zero-COVID. So many Chinese consumers are still reluctant to splash out on pricey overseas holidays. 
 
And so Chinese who are going abroad, they're opting for more cheaper Asian destinations, destinations like Thailand, which has, in fact, become a leading choice after it recently introduced a visa-free policy for Chinese tourists. 
 
In fact, according to Trip.com, hotel bookings to Thailand surged -- and this is not a typo -- surged over 6,000 percent, Laila. Over 6,000 percent compared to the previous year after this policy was announced. Back to you.
 
HARRAK: These numbers are hard to wrap your head around. Kristie Lu Stout in Hong Kong, thanks so much for breaking it all down. Thank you.
 
STOUT: Thank you.
 
HARRAK: Now, in the hours -- in the coming hours, rather, former U.S. President Donald Trump will appear in person for the start of his civil fraud trial in New York. 
 
Well, Trump made that announcement just hours ago on social media. Here's a live look at Trump Tower.
 
Well, earlier, sources said he planned to spend the night at Trump Tower before heading to court for the trial Monday morning.
 
Well, New York Attorney General Letitia James brought the lawsuit alleging the former president, his eldest sons, and his company engaged in fraud. Just last week the judge overseeing the case ruled that Trump is liable for fraud, in that he overvalued his properties on financial statements for a decade. 
 
Sources tell CNN the California governor, Gavin Newsom, will appoint Laphonza Butler, to the open Senate seat formerly held by the late Senator Dianne Feinstein. 
 
Butler is currently the president of Emily's List, a group that, quote, "works to elect Democratic pro-choice women up and down the ballot," according to their website. 
 
Feinstein passed away last week at the age of 90, and she was the longest serving female senator in U.S. history. 
 
Just ahead, from the White House to his hometown church in Georgia, tributes poured in for former President Jimmy Carter's 99th birthday. 
 <br>[00:30:02]
 
Those messages and what his grandson shared with us about this milestone, when we come back.

U.S. President Joe Biden also delivered his birthday message. Take a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BIDEN: Mister President, happy birthday, pal. I've known a lot of presidents, as you have. But I've admired you, because you have such incredible integrity, character, and determination. 
 
One of the smartest things I ever did. I remember, I was the first senator that ever endorsed you, because I knew who you were. You haven't changed a bit. It never stopped. And I consider it a great honor to know you and to have worked with you. And I just hope I can be one half the president you've been. God love you. Happy birthday, pal.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
HARRAK: CNN's Jake Tapper spoke with President Carter's grandson about how his grandparents are celebrating the special milestone. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JASON CARTER, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER'S GRANDSON: They're going to be, like they always are, at home in Plains and with each other, in love, at peace, excited about -- about spending some time with family today. 
 
So we're all thrilled that we made it here. And we're, frankly, surprised at this point. But nothing that they do surprises us anymore. 
 
TAPPER: So obviously, President Carter has overcome some intense health scares before. He survived seemingly incurable brain cancer in 2015, brain surgery in 2019. It has now been more than seven months since he entered hospice care. How is he doing now? 
 
CARTER: He's doing OK. I mean, he is coming to the end, as we know. But we all believed when he first went into hospice that we had a few days. And it's turned out to be this great blessing of several months. 
 
And so he's doing OK. But still, of course, very physically limited. But he's alert. He's excited. And he's gotten to witness this remarkable outpouring of support and respect over these last seven months, which is a real blessing. 
 
TAPPER: How is he approaching this -- these final days, this last chapter? Is he at peace? Is his faith playing a role in navigating these last few days, weeks, months? 
 <br>[00:35:05]
 
CARTER: As you know, Jake, I mean, that faith story for him has been a fundamental part of who he is throughout his life. And these last chapter, as you called it, there's parts of the faith story that you only get to live at the very end.
 
And I think he is cherishing that aspect of it. He certainly is confronting these moments with the knowledge that you don't get more from a life than what they got. 
 
And he's together with his wife. He's at peace. He knows where he has been. He knows where he's going, and this last few days and this last chapter is going to be, in that way, the most that you could possibly expect. 
 
TAPPER: Your grandparents have one of the great love stories in American history. Married an incredible 77 years. President Carter told me a few years ago in an interview that the key to his marriage was simply taking the time to enjoy the family life. 
 
And I know your grandmother, Rosalynn, is struggling with dementia. But how have the two of them been spending this time together? 
 
CARTER: You know, like the song says, they're the flagship of the fleet. Their relationship is unparalleled in so many ways. And the love story impacts all that they've done together. 
 
These last days, they are together. They're in love in a way that is -- is truly just amazing to watch. And yes, she is -- we are the ones that are struggling with the dementia. Right? She is in a joyous place, and he is worried about her. She's worried about him. 
 
But they're living out these days the way they have lived everything else, which is in this incredible partnership. And both with the security and this understanding that they are -- that they have been with each other, which has been so fundamental in who they are and all that they've accomplished forever, and it remains that way today.

HARRAK: Still to come, Paris is preparing to welcome tons of visitors for next year's Summer Olympics. But first, France is working hard to get rid of one pesky problem. Details ahead. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HARRAK: France is sounding the alarm as a widespread bedbug outbreak sweeps through Paris. The pests have been spotted at places like movie theaters, and even on public transportation. 
 
And it comes just as the French capital is preparing to host next year's Summer Olympics. 
 
CNN's Melissa Bell reports. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MELISSA BELL, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A nasty commute. And not just for the passengers you can see. French officials say that bedbugs have infested Paris's transport networks and the wider city. 
 
The race is now on to exterminate the bugs with less than a year to go until the Olympics. 
 
From metros to high-speed trains, videos have shown them taking over some cinemas and even Charles de Gaulle Airport, which is making for an itchy situation, as France prepares to host the rest of the world next summer.

French officials are preparing to take measures to contain the scourge, with transport operators gathering this week to try to find ways of getting rid of the pests. 
 
But that's not enough for some, who say the thought of sitting on a bus or a train next to the uninvited seatmates makes their skin crawl.
 
LAURA MMADI, TRAIN PASSENGER (through translator): That really traumatized me. I'll keep my luggage closed to prevent them from getting to my home. Also, I'm not from here, so once I get home, I'll have to wash all my clothes. 
 
LUC VILLETTE, TRAIN PASSENGER: I mean, the fact that we can actually see them means there are a lot of them. And in addition, they're being seen in the day when they usually come out at night, so there is a big problem somewhere. 
 
BELL (voice-over): Paris deputy mayor Emmanuel Gregoire says that no one is safe from the problem, because the bugs can be picked up anywhere.
 
A recent government report estimated that about one in 10 French households had had bedbug infestations between 2017 and last year. There's some fumigation companies say business is higher than usual, and more urgent. 
 
SACHA KRIEF, PEST CONTROL STORE MANAGER: We've had customers calling us up crying, desperate for a solution. And it's very, very costly, when you have to throw away all of your bedding, when you have to undergo works in your apartment. And so, you get into a sort of a paranoia. 
 
BELL (voice-over): And whilst bedbugs may be a growing nuisance in Paris, health experts say that they're not considered dangerous, causing merely itching and rashes. 
 
And their numbers are increasing, not just in the French capital but around the world, as people travel more, and the bugs become more resistant to pesticides. 
 
An irritating problem, but not one, say French officials, that should pose a threat to the upcoming Olympics. Their plan: to stop the bedbugs biting as soon as they can.
