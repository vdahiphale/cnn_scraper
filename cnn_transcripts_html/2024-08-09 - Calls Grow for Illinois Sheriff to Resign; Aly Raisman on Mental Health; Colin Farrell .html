MAYOR MISTY BUSCHER (D-SPRINGFIELD, IL):  No, I think that as an elected official, we have a responsibility to the people that we serve, not just the community, but the employees we represent. And I take his stance of not wanting to resign based on not abandoning the department. And I even asked my police chief, because we've had some strong discussions about this together, who would want to pick up those pieces and try to put that back together again.
 
So, part of me thinks that the reason he doesn't want to resign is to try to -- the sheriff's department still has to function and still has calls to make and citizens to respond to. So, I feel like his concern is that -- what I would do as an elected official is, A, answering the hiring process questions, the training process questions and then, B, say, I've been working with my team and this person can step in if I need to go away. because we don't want to leave the ship sinking.
 
JIM ACOSTA, CNN ANCHOR:  Yes, I guess. But, Mayor, I mean, wouldn't some of your residents and some of the people in that area say, how do you restore confidence in this law enforcement agency if the sheriff who was there when this deputy was, you know, doing his thing and not performing his duties the way a deputy should, obviously, that that sheriff is still there. Isn't that a problem?
 
BUSCHER:  It definitely can be a problem and it's definitely put a wedge in our community because we as stakeholders at the city level have been meeting with Black Lives Matter, NAACP, Faith Coalition for the Common Good, the groups in our community that represent our minority community. And those groups do feel that the sheriff should resign. And as a community leader, he does need to listen to them.
 
He has not picked up the phone and called me and asked my personal opinion. We haven't had a conversation about this. When the chief and I spoke about this, if this was my chief or myself, we both said we would want to do what would be best to heal the community. And sometimes saying, OK, it's not me that needs to be in this position. And what needs -- is what needs to heal the community. But -- 
 
ACOSTA:  Have you spoken to Sonya's family? I mean -- 
 
BUSCHER:  Absolutely, yes. I've been in constant contact with her father, James Wilburn, and her family is -- her mother's side as well.
 
ACOSTA:  And what does the family want to see?
 
BUSCHER:  James Wilburn, her father actually has a background in a law enforcement type. He was -- worked for the federal government. So, he's very familiar with all of these situations that are going on and he does want Sheriff Campbell to resign. And I don't blame Mr. Wilburn or -- and I would feel the same way. I have a child who doesn't live in the city, a daughter -- 
 
ACOSTA:  It sounds like a lot of folks want to see the sheriff resign. I mean, you know, you've listed a lot of people who want to see him go, but you don't.
 
BUSCHER:  Yes. But he does have supporters. As the governor pointed out, there are people in the community that have signs in their yards that say support Sheriff Jeff Campbell. So, it is a community divided issue. I just think that's where I point out as a community leader, we need to look at what we can do to heal the community as a leader.
 
So, that's where I -- if the sheriff were to call me and ask me what I think he should do, I would say, what do you think is going to heal the community the best? Because that's what we are to do as leaders.
 
ACOSTA:  Well, having covered a lot of these, I can tell you, Mayor, a lot of times healing begins with accountability. It doesn't sound like you're quite getting there just yet. But, Mayor Misty Buscher, thanks very much for your time. We appreciate it.
 
BUSCHER:  Yes. And I do just encourage the sheriff's office to share their herring process and the training processes so the community can learn about that.
 
ACOSTA:  All right. We'll follow up on that. Appreciate it. Thanks a lot.
 
BUSCHER:  Thank you.
 
ACOSTA:  We'll be right back.

ACOSTA:  The Olympics are entering their final weekend, say it ain't so, and it's time to check in on where the medal count stands. The U.S. is dominating in overall medals with 103, but we are right behind China in gold medals, check that out, with 30. So, the race is on.
 
One of Team USA's golds came when Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone smashed her own world record in the 400-meter hurdles. I don't know how she does this. She became the first woman to ever win Olympic gold twice in that event. After the race, she ran around the stadium with a flag draped around her shoulders and a crown on her head. It couldn't have come at a better time. She celebrated her 25th birthday just a day before she made history.
 
Meanwhile, the fastest man in the world, Noah Lyles, confirmed he tested positive for COVID earlier this week and ran in last night's 200-meter race anyway. He plays third in what is known as his signature event. Lyles later posted that he believes his 2024 Olympics are done, but he's leaving with so much joy in his heart.
 
And it was a thrilling come from behind victory. I was watching this on the sofa with Duke yesterday for the U.S. men's basketball team and their semifinal against Serbia. This was just a classic for the ages. Steph Curry, LeBron James helped erase a double digit fourth quarter deficit to win 95 to 91. Curry finished with a game high 36 points. He was lights out. Team USA will take on host nation France in the gold medal final tomorrow. Don't get too confident guys You've got one more game to go.
 
Our next guest is no stranger to Olympic competition. She's a three- time Olympic gold medalist and mental health advocate and author of the book "Fierce: How Competing for Myself Changed Everything." Aly Raisman, thank you very much for joining us.
 
Aly, it's a real honor to be with you. And I'm just wondering when you're watching these Olympics this time, it's been an amazing Olympics. I don't know what everybody else thinks, but this one is just going to go down as one of my favorites. No question about it. But when the U.S. Women's gymnastics team took the gold, you posted this photo of your parents saying they were more relaxed this time around. They went viral back in 2016 for squirming in their seats whenever you competed. What was it like watching it this time around?
 <br>[10:40:00]
 
ALY RAISMAN, THREE-TIME OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST AND MENTAL HEALTH ADVOCATE:  Yes. Well, first of all, thank you so much for having me on. It was so special to be able to watch the Olympic Games. This was the first time I got to go when I wasn't competing and I got to experience it with my parents. And while we're competing, we don't have time to go to other sporting events. So, it was just really wonderful to be able to share that with my parents.
 
We watched the gymnastics in person together and it was a really special moment. But then also being able to go to different sporting events like track and field and beach volleyball and basketball. It was just -- it's just incredible. And I agree, it's such a special Olympics and I'm just feel so lucky that I was able to witness it in person.
 
ACOSTA:  Yes. I was loving watching Simone Biles last night. She was watching some of the track and field. events. And that was just fun to see them enjoying the moment too. And I want to talk about this viral moment when Simone and Jordan Chiles bowed down to Brazil's Rebeca Andrade after she won gold on the floor. It's now become this iconic image showing an all-black Olympic gymnastics podium. What was your thought watching all of that? It was a cool moment.
 
RAISMAN:  It is such a special moment. I think something that we'll all remember for the rest of our lives and we'll go down in history. It's just such a beautiful moment. I felt like the sportsmanship at this Olympic Games was extra special, especially at the gymnastics, seeing the way that the gymnasts support each other. They hugged each other. They were cheering for each other, even though they were competing against each other. It just felt special really amazing and something I'll never forget.
 
I just love the way that Simone is so supportive of Rebeca. And although Simone wanted to win the gold on floor, she just -- her and Jordan were so supportive and spoke so highly of Rebeca. And I just -- I think that's so beautiful. And I'm just so proud of both of them.
 
ACOSTA:  Yes, I saw that moment and I thought it all class, just a classy moment. And one of the things I love about the Olympics and moments like that is it teaches sportsmanship to young people who are watching, like that is such an important part of all of this. And one of the breakout stars of this Olympics is the Olympic gymnast Stephen Nedoroscik, better known is the pommel horse guy. People have also compared him to Clark Kent. He's the guy with the glasses and so on. What were your thoughts watching him competing this time around?
 
RAISMAN:  It's just so wonderful to see. I'm so happy to see Stephen getting so much attention. I absolutely love it. It makes me so happy. I also am so happy to see men's gymnastics getting a lot of attention. The men's gymnastics team, they worked so hard. They did so well. I'm so happy for them. They got the bronze medal. But I'm happy to finally see them getting some well-deserved attention. So, it makes me so happy.
 
And I love how, now with social media, it allows so many more athletes to be out there and to be known. And we get so much more access to the athletes. And it's so funny to see all the different memes and everything. But I just am so happy for Steve who bronze and the team. And then -- I mean, sorry, and the team and then in the pommel horse, it's just so wonderful.
 
ACOSTA:  Yes. I mean, the memes have been tremendous this time around. No question about it. And I do want to ask you about something serious, Aly, because you have been a big advocate for mental health awareness. I talked a little bit about what Simone Biles has gone through, what Noah Lyles has gone through. Talk about -- if you can talk about how healthy a development is to have star athletes like this, people who are in ads, who are role models, who are talking about this openly. It's so different. I'm not going to date myself too much, but I mean, we just didn't talk about this with the superstars of the '80s and the '90s in the 2000s.
 
RAISMAN:  Yes, it's so important. And I'm so supportive of all the athletes speaking up about their mental health. It's not an easy thing to talk about, but their vulnerability is so impactful. And, you know, they're not going to meet all the people's lives that they're going to save and they're going to help, but they are definitely out there. And just normalizing those conversations is so important and so crucial.
 
And I think, you know, people tune into the Olympics, you know, usually once every four years, but people don't realize that Olympic athletes, we're all human. We have good days. We have bad days. We struggle. And I also think, you know, the thing about the Olympics that's so magical is that for a lot of athletes, or maybe very few, their dreams come true, but for the rest, when they don't do as well as they want to, you know, maybe they get sick, maybe they get injured, or maybe they just don't perform as well as they wanted to, it can be really devastating and really heartbreaking, and a lot of athletes define their worth and their success by how they do at the Olympic Games.
 
And I think the fact that this is becoming more normalized and we're talking about it more can help athletes know that no matter how they do, whether they achieve what they wanted to, or they don't do as well as they wanted to, it doesn't define who they are. And if they're struggling, it's OK to talk about. In fact, it's important.
 <br>[10:45:00]
 
So, I love how this younger generation right now is going to grow up to know that their favorite athletes in the world, no matter how good they are, no matter how many followers they have, they are human, just like them. And everyone has good and bad days. And it's important to talk about if someone's struggling.
 
ACOSTA:  Yes, that is such an important message. And you mentioned social media. That's a huge part of this. And I'm sure a lot of aspiring athletes look at social media. They want to achieve what these superstars have achieved. And the mental health component is so important to all of this. You're a great messenger for it. Aly Raisman, such a privilege to talk to you. Thank you so much. We really appreciate it.
 
RAISMAN:  Thank you so much for having me.
 
ACOSTA:  All right. Good to talk to you. All right. Go Team USA. We appreciate it. All right. In the meantime, still ahead, from Hollywood, bad boy to advocate, Colin Farrell is opening up about his son's disability and his push for resources and support.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
COLIN FARRELL, ACTOR AND SON JAMES HAS ANGELMAN SYNDROME:  My God, James' first steps. I'll never forget James' first steps. Two weeks short of his fourth birthday. She had him -- she let him go. It was very -- it was -- I mean, it was so profound. I mean, yes, it was magic.

 <br>[10:50:00]
 
ACOSTA:  This morning shedding light on a rare disability in a new interview. Colin Farrell is opening up about his son's diagnosis with Angelman syndrome, a genetic disorder. And the first time his son took his first steps.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
FARRELL:  I'll never forget James' first steps. Two weeks short of his fourth birthday. Two weeks short of his fourth birthday. I knew that they were working on walking and she came upstairs and she said, James has something to show you. And she said, go over there. And I stood over there and she had him, and she let him go. He just came. It was very -- it was -- I mean, it was so profound. I mean, it was -- yes, it was magic. I mean, I'll just -- I'll never forget. And just the face of determination on him as he just, walked towards me, you know, and he took like six steps and I burst into tears. It was amazing

ACOSTA:  The actor has now started a foundation to support other families with adult children suffering from intellectual disabilities. And joining us now as Amanda Moore She's the CEO of the Angelman syndrome foundation another organization that helps families Navigate this situation and Amanda's nine-year-old son Jackson was also a Diagnosed with Angelman syndrome.
 
Amanda, forgive me for just confessing this off -- I did not even know this existed. I suppose I may not be alone in saying that most people have never heard of this before. What should they know about it?
 
AMANDA MOORE, CEO, ANGELMAN SYNDROME FOUNDATION AND NINE-YEAR-OLD SON JACKSON HAS ANGELMAN SYNDROME:  Yes, you're definitely not the only one. And obviously, the last couple of days have been quite remarkable for our very little rare disease to be able to get the exposure that we are getting.
 
And to put it simply, Angelman syndrome is a rare neurogenetic disorder that occurs in about one in 15,000 people worldwide. And it's caused by a loss of the function of the UBE3A gene, which is in the 15th chromosomes. So, that's to put it simply.
 
ACOSTA:  And what does it mean to have someone like Colin Farrell talking about this this syndrome?
 
MOORE:  Well, it's amazing. Just like you saw in the clip, I think a lot of our families have experienced are yearning to experience that moment of those -- you know, those first steps. I know that when Jackson took his first steps, it was the same emotion. You see that determination. You see that that drive and that resilience in their eyes and the things that some of us -- it's so easy for us to, you know, take steps for them. They work really, really hard. And some of our families are still really working hard.
 
So, to have that exposure is unbelievable, especially for what the foundation's really going to be focusing on. It's an issue, not only for those affected by Angelman syndrome, but so many more, you know, there's 7,000 rare diseases in the world, many people struggling with the services, and to have Colin and the foundation to come out as a voice and come along with other organizations working on this is remarkable.
 
ACOSTA:  Yes. And when we were showing that footage a few moments ago of Colin Farrell's son trying to take those steps, I mean, you do see this light in his eyes where he is trying so, so hard. And I guess you see that, you know that. MOORE:  Yes. You know, those living with Angelman syndrome are -- you know, they experience a severe developmental delays, debilitating seizures, a lack of sleep. Most of them are nonverbal. So, they communicate through, you know, augmentative communication. So, you know, the things that they are challenged with on a day-to-day basis and the way that they come out of that and the resilience that they show is remarkable.
 
And I know as a parent, the things that I learned from Jackson every single day, for the easy things that are -- you know, that come very easy for his twin brother who doesn't have Angelman syndrome and how hard he works to accomplish those, it just teaches you something about life and about, you know, taking the little joys in life and being very thankful for those and just the amount of resiliency that they teach us is just unbelievable.
 
ACOSTA:  Well, Jackson is a beautiful kid. I mean, you can just see it in these photographs here. Just a beautiful, beautiful kid. And where are the gaps in resources for people who have been diagnosed with this? What more can be done?
 <br>[10:55:00]
 
MOORE:  Well, I think there's a few things. I think that the -- you know, one thing is helping even like the clinical -- the health care system understand how to treat Angelman. A lot of times us as families are going to the doctors and we're instructing the doctors on the standards of care of Angelman because it is so rare and so unknown. So, I think really understanding all the rare diseases. There's a lot, and I know that's hard for the health care system, but really being able to go to the doctor and be a mom and not a doctor would be ideal.
 
But when it comes to the work that Colin and their foundation is doing, this is something that our families think about from day one of diagnosis. When Jackson was diagnosed, the fear of long-term care, long-term support, it resonates. And then, the people who are experiencing it now, it's heartbreaking to know, you know, after they transition out of maybe the educational system, there's little to no services left for these individuals. And the long-term opportunities of care are not there.
 
So, it's things that we've been raising awareness and advocating for for years, and we will continue to do so. But to have his voice on such a high platform, we're so hopeful of what that's going to bring for our community, especially our older individuals.
 
ACOSTA:  Well, Amanda Moore, you're an amazing advocate for your son, for this issue, so is Colin Farrell. Thank you so much for your time. We really appreciate it.
 
MOORE:  Thank you so much -- 
 
ACOSTA:  And thanks to all of you for joining us.
 
MOORE:  -- for having us. ACOSTA:  Yes, thank you. We really appreciate it. Wonderful spokesperson. And thanks to everybody out there for joining us this morning. I'm Jim Acosta. Our next hour of Newsroom with Wolf Blitzer starts right after a quick break. Have a great weekend.
