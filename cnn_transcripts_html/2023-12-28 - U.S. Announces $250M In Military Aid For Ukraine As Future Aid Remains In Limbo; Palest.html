THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
<br>[14:30:00]
 
MAJOR MIKE LYONS, U.S. ARMY, RETIRED: Well, what's missing are any offensive weapons. If Ukraine is to change the game here, they have to show that they could go on the offense. 
 
Unfortunately, this past year, their counteroffensive has not worked. Started back in June-July timeframe. It was not the kind of tactics. 
 
And given the fact they never had the air support they really needed to perform the kind of counter offensive in order to feed Russia, Russia digs in with defensive belts on their side in the occupied areas that they have. 
 
There is no long-range missiles, ATACMs in particular. That is something that would bring Russia to the negotiating table. That would be important right now.
 
If Ukraine can show they can actually take some of the land back that Russia has, then perhaps Russia decides to negotiate. 
 
BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN HOST: So, big picture, what does this chapter of the war mean long term? Is it a further stalemate? Do you see a path towards the kind of negotiation that you were just alluding to? 
 
LYONS: Well, this year has not been successful for either side. Either side is going to decide what they want to do going forward. 
 
If Ukraine does not get the support from NATO and the United States, I'm afraid they are in for another tough year. Russia can re-arm itself and can re-constitute its military machine. 
 
If the United States decides to send $60 billion an aid, as the Senate should pass, as well as $50 billion coming from the European Union, that sends a signal to Russia that the West is not going to allow it to take over. 
 
I think that is what's got to happen here early in the year. Ukraine has to get that level of support from the United States in order to show Russia that it will have the capability to go on the offense and change the game. 
 
Maybe perhaps, that brings pressure to the negotiation table. BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: I know it's, Mike, really perplexing to the
 
 military community about why there is this kind of what would be unconventional Russian Republican opposition to finding Ukraine. 
 
Put it into context to you what is really at stake in this war. 
 
LYONS: Brianna, you're right on. I don't get it. This is what NATO was created for. NATO was created to stop Russian aggression and advancement. 
 
Maybe not allowing Ukraine into NATO, I understand that. I recognize that putting them in right now draws the West into a large conflict in Europe. 
 
But providing the support that we could provide them, with the offensive weapons, more airplanes, more tanks, more overall long-range rocket fire systems that actually threaten Russia.
 
Force Russia to do more mobilization because we don't see them on their side -- this hasn't affected their economy as well. 
 
Use the levers of soft American power. We haven't done that, as well we haven't got other countries mobilized here. 
 
Again, I don't get it. I think this is a literally no-brainer for the United States to continue support with what Ukraine is trying to do here to stop Russian aggression here and what is NATO's backyard. 
 
KEILAR: Retired U.S. Army Major Mike Lyons, thank you as always for taking us through that. 
 
LYONS: Thanks. 
 
KEILAR: Now, to the latest in the Middle East. Egyptian officials say 15 U.S. citizens were among the more than 700 foreign nationals who left Gaza today and crossed into Egypt. 
 
Earlier this month, a Palestinian poet and writer was able to flee Gaza with his family after being detained by the Israeli military in November. He says the Israeli soldiers mistreated and terrorized him. 
 
He spoke with CNN's Phil Mattingly on "CNN THIS MORNING." Here he is describing what happened after being separated from his family and detained with a group of other Palestinian men.

MOSAB ABU TOHA, PALESTINIAN POET &amp; WRITER: We are surprised that they were asking us to strip off all of our clothes. So we had nothing to do but to take off our boxer shorts. 
 
And then when I was naked for the first time in my life in front of strangers, I was asked to turn around. So, I did what they asked for. Then I was handcuffed and I was blindfolded,
 
And then I was taken to a very close area and I was interrogated. You have any evidence any proof that I am a Hamas activists or photograph, video satellite image showing anything? 
 
He slapped me across the face. He said, you give me a proof. I was wondering, how could I give you proof that I am not Hamas? 
 
Then I was taken, I was beaten, I was violently treated along with other young people like me. 
 
Later, I was interrogated by an Israeli captain. I told him about myself everything. It was not a tough day for me but for other people it was tough.
 
And then he said, OK, we are going to verify the information you gave us. Two hours later, an Israeli soldier said, we are sorry about the mistake, you are going home. 
 
Then I said, are you serious about that? I mean, I'm going to be with my family and kids? He said, I'm serious. 
 <br>[14:35:00]
 
I later thought to myself, how many mistakes has the Israeli army committed against other Palestinians?

KEILAR: The Israel Defense Forces acknowledge that Mosab was mistakenly identified and says that individuals detained are, quote, "treated in accordance with international law." 
 
It is a vital medication for the tens of millions of Americans who have asthma. Now it is set to change. So, what you need to know to avoid any potential confusion in the new year, next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
KEILAR: There's one thing that anyone with asthma knows that is that you don't go anywhere without your inhaler. That could get a lot harder starting next month. 
 
The manufacturer of Flovent says it will discontinue that brand in favor of a generic version starting on Monday. 
 
SANCHEZ: The problem is that that version may not be covered as widely by insurers. That could force patients to get new prescriptions and then figure out coverage options right at the height of the winter virus season. 
 
Let's get some analysis with CNN medical analyst, Dr. Jonathan Reiner.
 
Dr. Reiner, thanks so much for sharing part of your afternoon with us. 
 
How big of a concern is this? 
 <br>[14:40:00]
 
DR. JONATHAN REINER, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST: Well, it's a big deal, because it is probably the most popular anti-inflammatory inhaled corticosteroids used in patients with asthma. 
 
As you said at the open, there are millions of Americans, probably about 25 million Americans have asthma, about five million kids. 
 
This is -- Flovent is an inhaled corticosteroid, which reduces inflammation, helps to open some of the small airways. It is used as a chronic medicine to prevent flare-ups of asthma. 
 
There are other alternatives. The problem with the abrupt change in the manufacturer of this drug is that many of the pharmacy benefit plans have not yet included the alternative generic in their list of drugs. 
 
In those that already have, the generic, the new generic produced by GlaxoSmithKline is not yet one of their preferred drugs. 
 
The list price of this medication is not cheap. It's almost $200 a month. So this can create significant hardships, not just in terms of acquisition but in terms of affordability for millions of Americans. 
 
KEILAR: Tell us about this new generic version. Is it truly just the same thing? 
 
REINER: Yes, it's actually the same drug. 
 
What happened was a change in the law two years ago, from the American Recovery Act, it actually changed how much money drug manufacturers might be at risk if the price of their medication has been raised at a level higher than the rate of inflation. 
 
Flovent, over the last nine years, has gone up about 50 percent. The rate of inflation in that period of time has been about 23 percent. GSK did the math and realized that they might be liable for higher rebates than the price they actually charged for the drug.
 
Which is why they've created this generic, which has never been sold and has no price history, and therefore, won't be potentially liable for the inflation rebates that Medicaid demands. So, this is basically just a cost decision. 
 
Flovent it's a 20-year-old drug, incredibly successful, very popular drug. There is no other reason to discontinue it other than this potential financial downfall for the manufacturer. 
 
SANCHEZ: As with so many things in life, the answer comes down to money. 
 
Doctor, what is your advice to patients who might be worried about getting that new inhaler? 
 
REINER: So, in the short term, pharmacies will have stock of this drug for a period of time. The company is going to cease manufacturing it, essentially this weekend. 
 
I would say, if it's time to renew your drug, go ahead and do that now. Then talk to your insurance company about whether the new generic formulation of Flovent will be covered by your insurance. 
 
But get that it now, before you need to renew your medicine. 
 
If you get pushback from your pharmaceutical insurance benefit plan about whether they'll cover this drug, talk to your doctor or provider about alternatives.
 
There are other inhaled corticosteroids that can be appropriate for you but not necessarily interchangeable. 
 
The time to discuss this with your physician is not when you are basically using the last of a severe drug. Do it now, sort it out now. And then maybe bring in a supply that will cover you for the next month or two until all of that is straightened out. 
 
SANCHEZ: Dr. Jonathan Reiner, appreciate the advice. Thank you so much. 
 
REINER: My pleasure. 
 
SANCHEZ: We're learning more about that stunning rescue story out of Indiana. Two fishermen discovering a driver trapped in his pickup truck nearly a week after he crashed off a bridge. 
 
CNN has now obtained audio of the 911 call that the fishermen made just moments after realizing the driver was still trapped inside. 
 
Listen to this. 
 
(BEGIN AUDIO FEED)
 
NAVARDO DELATORRE, FISHERMAN: There is the car, it's been here since Wednesday. And there is a person inside of it. He's still alive, too. 
 
They're on the way, buddy! They're on the way!
 
I'm surprised nobody also seen him. There's guys fishing down here. 
 
I just walked up and I seen the truck underneath the bridge. I thought it was kind of weird. 
 
911 OPERATOR: Yes, that's -- that's definitely good you managed to see him. 
 
(END AUDIO FEED)
 
SANCHEZ: Definitely good. 
 
Police say the driver was tightly pinned in his seat for six days after he careened off the highway and into that creek. He apparently survived by drinking rainwater.
