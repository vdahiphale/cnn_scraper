CHRISTINA MACFARLANE, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome back to CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Christina Macfarlane. If you are just joining us, let me bring you up to date with our top stories this hour. 
 
For the fourth consecutive night, Russia launched air attacks on the southern port city of Odesa, Ukraine. Grain warehouses were hit by the strikes and a hundred tons of peas were destroyed in the attack.
 
And apparent deadline has passed for Donald Trump to respond to the special counsel's target letter on whether he will testify before a grand jury in the January 6 insurrection. The former president faces potential indictment in the probe. 
 
And now to the American soldier who dashed in to North Korea. The Pentagon says private Travis King is officially AWOL or absent without leave. Adding that it doesn't think he would have any intelligence that North Korea would find valuable. The Pentagon also says there was no indication King's crossing was planned in coordination with the North. King had faced assault charges and was due to be removed from the Army. The Army says he had returned to the U.S. -- had he returned to the U.S. he absolutely would have faced additional consequences. We heard from his mother earlier.

CLAUDINE GATES, MOTHER: I just want my son back. I just want my son back. Get my son home. Get my son home. And pray. Pray that he comes back.

MACFARLANE: Well meanwhile, the State Department says it relayed messages to North Korea saying King crossed on his own without any help from the U.S. but wouldn't reveal whether the North has responded. CNN's Will Ripley reports from near the DMZ.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
 
WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The Korean DMZ, the demilitarized zone is one of the most heavily fortified border areas in the world. That's the reason why you have barricades and spike strips and all of these military checkpoints to try to prevent people from being able go in or come out. 
 
There's a reason why this road has tank traps. Basically, if the tanks would come rolling down, they would blow up to stop an invasion from the North to the South. And the North is similar booby-trap set up as well. So obviously, it's a highly secured area. 
 
How did this U.S. Army private just run across? Well, we're learning that on, Monday at Inchon airport, about a 90-minute drive from where we're standing. He was supposed to get on an American Airlines flight to Dallas. But he told -- after going through all of the procedures, all the security right at the gate to the plane he claimed that he had lost his passport and was escorted back outside of the airport. 
 
Somehow made his way here on Tuesday, where he was able to board -- get on a tour. He had booked a tour. It was apparently the passenger manifest was approved by the United Nations command and he and along with about 40 other people took a bus down this road over this Unification Bridge. And less than five miles that way is the joint security area where he was able to basically -- according to others who were on the tour with -- him run across, ignoring the calls of guards and get into a North Korean van where he was whisked away.
 
Now where he is now, after being in North Korean custody for Wednesday and now Thursday, still an open question. Because the North Koreans have not released any information publicly. And it may be quite some time before we officially know anything about this soldier's whereabouts or when he might have a chance of getting back to the U.S.

MACFARLANE: Well U.S. officials have confirmed to CNN that China based hackers recently broke into the email of U.S. Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns. Burns is just the latest named official to fall victim to a sophisticated hacking operation that began in May but wasn't discovered until a month later. Microsoft eventually determined the hackers were based in China. Even though the hacked government accounts were not classified, administration officials suspect that they gave Beijing valuable insights into U.S. thinking ahead of last month's visit by the U.S. Secretary of State. 
 
Our British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has suffered defeat in two parliamentary bielections. Both seats were recently vacated by conservative MPs but they were instead won by Labour and a Liberal Democrat. Prime Minister Sunak has struggled to reverse his party's plummeting fortunes in the nine months since he's held office. Conservatives just managed to hold onto the third seat once held by former Prime Minister Boris Johnson. 
 <br>[04:35:00]
 
He quit Parliament last month in anger over a report that found that he lied to lawmakers. 
 
Now to widespread condemnation over the desecration of the Quran in Sweden for the second time in just weeks. An Iraqi nationalist is behind both of the stunts that damaged the Muslim holy book. But most of the anger seems to be directed at Sweden for allowing this latest public gathering to take place. Iraqi Protestors stormed the Swedish Embassy in Baghdad Thursday and Iraq has threatened to sever diplomatic ties. 
 
CNN's Salma Abdelaziz has been closely monitoring all of this for us. And Salma, it's hard to believe that all of this is the result of the actions of one man really. The protest that was planned yesterday, the burning of the Quran, did not actually take place, but the fallout from that is continuing to be felt. We heard that the Swedish ambassador yesterday had been expelled from the country. 
 
SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, essentially a one-man demo that lasted about 45 minutes, was live streamed outside of the Iraqi Embassy in Stockholm. But even before this tiny event took place, there was demonstrations in Baghdad. Hundreds of protestors stormed the Swedish Embassy, set part of the building alite. Many of them followers of the Shiite cleric Moqtada al Sadr, as the event was taking place. 
 
Again this man and his translator, tiny event was taking place. Iraq recalled its charge d'affaires from Sweden. It expelled Sweden's ambassador. It threatened to sever diplomatic ties. But compared to what happened last month when this same individual carried out a burning of the Quran, actually burned pages of the Quran at the time and there was wider condemnation, this is much more contained. 
 
But you still of course, have those issues -- those structural issues that remain in the Muslim world. Many countries have blasphemy laws that prevent this kind of thing from taking place. Whereas of course, in the West, it is freedom of speech that is prioritized. So you can only imagine it will be a matter of time before -- 
 
MACFARLANE: And that is the inherent conflict that we're seeing play out. What is the likelihood that this individual will do it again? 
 
ABDELAZIZ: It's the inherent conflict. But beyond the religious element, I think it's important to remember that there is also a political element here as well. So for example, last month when this took place, Salwan Momika burned those pages of the Quran on the Eid- al-Adha holiday. A very poignant and inflammatory image there. And Turkey was considering the bid for Sweden to join NATO at the time. And so that became central to that argument. It became -- Turkey was considering at the time withdrawing or risking that bid. 
 
And in this case just yesterday, it was Moqtada al Sadr, a very prominent Shiite cleric that became a voice of anger and discontent with this. 
 
So you have to remember how these moments, one single man, one single action, can be galvanized by political forces in the Middle East and how that translates and can turn in on something so much bigger, so much more inflammatory. 
 
MACFARLANE: Yes, it's worth saying all in that. Salma, thanks for breaking it down. 
 
Now Israeli lawmakers are expected to vote Monday on the first part of a controversial judicial reform plan and hundreds of protesters marching from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem plan to be there. They say the move would strip the Supreme Court of most of its power. But supporters, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claim it's necessary to restore balance to the branches of government.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Even in these moments I would like to tell you that efforts are being made to reach an agreement on the reasonableness bill. I sincerely hope that these efforts will be successful, but even if not, the coalition's door will always remain open.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
FOSTER: Polls show the judicial reform plan is widely unpopular in Israel. Hundreds of military reservists are vowing to refuse voluntary service if it passes. 
 
Now Kenya is bracing for a third day of planned anti-government demonstrations called by the opposition. At least three people were killed in clashes with security forces this week. And the latest round of protests are the tax hikes and the cost of living. Larry Madowo has the latest from Nairobi. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
LARRY MADOWO, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: This show of force is how the Kenyan security forces have been responding to these planned three days of anti-government protests.
 
That's why you're getting criticism from the other nations, from the opposition, from some civil society voters about how the Kenyan government is cracking down violently on mostly peaceful protesters. That is the language here.
 
The Kenyan opposition is specifically crying foul. They're accusing the government of heavy-handed policing tactics and using some language which is not accidental. The Kenyan opposition has called some of the reported deaths and beatings and police brutality as crimes against humanity. 
 <br>[04:40:00]
 
They're calling them specifically a genocide in the making. And that choice of language is deliberate. Because after the 2007 election, President William Ruto was accused of crimes against humanity. He was tried at the International Criminal Court. But those cases collapsed for lack of evidence. So they're using that language here in an attempt to try and paint these in a much larger context by the Kenyan opposition. What you see here for instance, an armored water cannon that we have seen and used in some neighborhoods. Often in people's homes where children live. And it's had some major impacts on them. These are some of the policing tactics that have been criticized in these three days of protests. 
 
They began as a fight against the legitimacy of the government of President William Ruto. Then conveniently, these very unpopular tax hikes came in, and the opposition has hitched their wagon on that. And now, they've fully become anti-government protests that have plunged this East African nation into this major crisis.

MACFARLANE: Now protestors take to the streets after shocking video emerges showing two women being sexually assaulted in India. The latest on the investigation, just ahead. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
MACFARLANE: In India, a shocking graphic video has emerged showing two women being sexually assaulted. CNN has seen the video but isn't showing it out of respect for the survivors of the brutal attack. An indigenous group says the assault happened in early May in a northeastern state of Manipur. The video shows the terrified women being forced to walk naked through a crowd of fully clothed men. The group says they were then taken to a field and gang raped, an allegation that is under investigation. 
 
And CNN reporter Vedika Sud joins me now from New Delhi. 
 <br>[04:45:00]
 
And Vedika, this horrific incident we understand actually took place in May but only really came to light after this video was circulated on social media. So what has been the nationwide reaction there? How are the government responding to this? 
 
VEDIKA SUD, CNN REPORTER: That's the irony, Christina, that it's taken 2 1/2 months for the nation to know that such a horrifying incident, terrifying, brutal, deeply disturbing incident took place in the northeastern state of Manipur. 
 
We believe this incident took place on the 4th of May. Two women who were forced to walk on a street in Manipur absolutely naked. And there was a mob that surrounded them, that sexually assaulted -- allegedly sexually assaulted them. But the video shows it. A video that we've seen and we've been deeply disturbed by. 
 
They were then taken to a field and we believe they where allegedly gang raped there. They were screaming. They were crying. They were asking for help. They were covering parts of their body, but these men just kept brutalizing them. 
 
And now we do know that it's been 2 1/2 months since action was taken. And that's the question that lot of activists here in India, the opposition party leaders here in India, are asking the government both in the state as well as the center. Both in this case ruled by the party, the Janata Party, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party. And in Parliament today we saw that. We saw the opposition lawmakers asking questions. They were demanding answers from the Indian Prime Minister on the situation and the rest of the state of Manipur. 
 
It's the first time he's actually spoken, and that was yesterday. But he did speak about the video, per se, not about the violence at large that has been going on for months now, over two months in Manipur. Here is what the Indian Prime Minister had to say about this video. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
NARENDRA MODI, INDIAN PRIME MINISTER (through translator): And I want to assure the countrymen that no culprit will be spared. The law with all its might and strictness will take steps one by one. Whatever has happened with the daughters of Manipur will never be forgiven.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SUD: Protests have also been seen and witnessed over the last 24 hours in the streets of Delhi. The opposition party, the Congress Party, members of that party had been on the streets demanding justice for these two women. Activists, people on social media, everyone absolutely horrified by this video. 
 
But the question remains, Christina, why has it taken 2 1/2 months since this incident for action to be taken on the ground. According to the chief minister of Manipur, four arrests have been made so far and there's a massive -- according to the Manipur him' police that's been launched to find the culprits, the perpetrators of this heinous crime. But there are more than two dozen of them and only four arrests in more than 70 days. And that is shocking in itself. 
 
It's taken a video, Christina, and just to summarize this horrific incident, one video to go online, to be published online, to go viral, for action to be taken by the authorities and the people to be brought to book. And just four arrests. And I want to repeat that, four arrests out of more than two dozen men who brutalized those two women crying out for help and no help coming their way. Back to you.
 
MACFARLANE: As you say, Vedika, just four arrests in itself is quite shocking. We really hope this clamor for action does result in justice for these women. Vedika Sud there, thanks very much. And we'll be right back after this short break.
 <br>[04:50:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
MACFARLANE: And the Women's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, both host countries got off to a strong start with wins in their opening matches. In the coming hours, the game to watch will be USA defending champions against Vietnam -- which is making his debut at the tournament. And that match will be played in Auckland, New Zealand. CNN's Angus Watson is joining us live this hour from Sydney, Australia. And Angus, I believe you were the lucky man to be watching Matildas in their opens game just yesterday. It was great to see both the co-hosts get off to a winning start. But I think particularly from New Zealand who had never won a World Cup match before. And what a moment to it. 
 
ANGUS WATSON, CNN PRODUCER: That's right, Christina. New Zealand something of a fairytale opening to the World Cup as hosts. They were up against one of the more heavily favored teams of the tournament, the European giant, Norway. Winners of 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup, 1- nil on the night to New Zealand. Wonderful goal there, wonderful sweeping move from the New Zealanders to get that victory on the board in their first match. 
 
Where I was Stadium Australia, over 75,000 screaming Matildas fans. Egging on the team as they played a very brave Republic of Ireland. The Matildas were playing without their talisman Sam Kerr. Her injury, her calf injury, was announced just moments before the man as fans were born into the stadium. Their concern on their faces turned to relieve right after as they notched up that 1-nil victory against the Republic of Ireland. 
 
In that group today Canada drawing nil-nil with Nigeria. And Switzerland beating the Philippines 2-nil. Right now a great game going on in Auckland, Spain verse Costa Rica, goals are raining in. It was already 3-nil to Spain at the break. Now the penalty saved by the Costa Ricans who are digging in -- Christina.
 
MACFARLANE: And Angus, no doubt in the hours to come, the one to watch will be U.S. women's national team going for a third consecutive crown. And no doubt wanting to I think this year give a good sendoff to their star Megan Rapinoe who of course this will be the last World Cup she'll be playing in. 
 
WATSON: Absolutely, it's something of a changing of the guard and we could say in team USA. They have such a strong squad. It's really extraordinary. But they have some real young guns. Primarily Sophia Smith and Trinity Rodman playing up front, will be really ones to watch as the tournament progresses. Megan Rapinoe, a real star that as I've said, there's nothing like the women's national team for its depth. They could field two teams I'm sure, Christine, and both of them would do extremely well. 
 <br>[04:55:00]
 
MACFARLANE: Yes, well either way, an intimidating prospect for Vietnam, I'm sure. Angus Watson, enjoy the games, thanks for joining us from Sydney. 
 
WATSON: Thank you.
 
MACFARLANE: Now German police say that they'll try again today to find out what could be a lioness on the loose after Thursday night search proved unsuccessful. This video posted on Twitter appears to show the runaway roaming the outskirts of Berlin. Eyewitnesses have reported seeing a large cat chasing a wild boar. Authorities use drones, helicopters and infrared cameras to track her down. They checked with the zoos and animal parks but still can't say where the animal came from. Worrying.
 
Now former U.S. President Barack Obama is playing deejay this summer with a play list that covers just about everything from country to hip hop.

BANGLES: Walk like an Egyptian ... 
 
MACFARLANE: That of course was the Bangles and their hit "Walk Like an Egyptian." Anyone who watched MTV in the 1980s will remember both the song and the video. Obama said his playlist is a mix of old and new and reflects his eclectic musical taste, from classic oldies, to newly released Indy tracks. Continues to be the coolest president of all- time.
