ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Hello, and welcome to our viewers joining us from all around the world. I'm Rosemary Church. Just a head on CNN NEWSROOM. Idalia wrath of the pummeling Florida with wind, rain and storm surge she is now soaking the Carolinas.
 
The wave of coups in West Africa continues this time in Gabon where the military ousted the president and celebrated in the streets.
 
Plus, from the pandemic to Russia's war. Four years of education disruption have left Ukrainian children struggling to learn.
 
ANNOUNCER: Live from CNN Center. This is CNN NEWSROOM with Rosemary Church.
 
CHURCH: And we begin with terrifying moments in Johannesburg, South Africa where at least 52 people have died in a building fire. The death toll shooting up dramatically in just the past half hour. More than 40 others are injured. This happened at a five-storey building in the city's central business district. Firefighters are working to put out the flames. No word yet on what caused the fire. We will of course bring you more information as it comes into us.
 
Well, a major cleanup operation is in store for the West Coast and Big Bend area of Florida after the strongest storm to hit the region in at least 125 years. Idalia is now a tropical storm moving north east along the Carolina Coast. It's losing strength but still bringing a lot of rain, flooding and the threat of tornadoes. Water levels are Charleston Harbor in South Carolina rising to near record levels.
 
Residents are being asked to stay inside and avoid downed power lines. Video from Goose Creek South Carolina shows a weak tornado tossing a car around like a toy. Only minor injuries there though. But there are reports of one death each in Georgia and Florida. Hundreds of thousands of people are without electricity across the southeast. And a home in Hudson, Florida surrounded by flood water and engulfed in flames. A neighbor described it as a gas fire. So, we want to bring in meteorologist Karen Maginnis now who's at the
 
 CNN Weather Center. So, Karen, where's the storm right now and what impact is it having?
 
KAREN MAGINNIS, CNN METEOROLOGIST: The National Hurricane Center just updated us and we fully expected that this would have lost some strength. But Idalia as we well know has lots of strengths still left with it. It is pulling away from the mid-Atlantic coastline mostly from North Carolina. But that's where the biggest impacts are right now. There you can see a lot of deep convection over the Piedmont and the coastal region here.
 
The bulk of that very heavy precipitation has moved away from South Carolina. But not before drenching the Low Country region from Edisto Island to Hilton Head to Charleston, South Carolina. Well, all low- lying areas. So, doesn't take a lot of precipitation. But also, we had the high tides made higher by the full moon. Right now with Idalia the wizard at 60 miles per hour. We watched Idalia as it was just swirling around the Yucatan Peninsula through the Yucatan Strait.
 
And then it moved into the Gulf of Mexico, traveled to the north before making landfall just before 8:00 Eastern time. And that was this morning. But it was very powerful. A category three. Right now, it's at tropical storm intensity, but it is going to move off the coast but in its weight we still have the potential for at least a minor storm surge about a foot. But still for Wilmington residents in North Carolina, that could spell some localized flooding along those areas.
 
And we could see some beach erosion associated with that as well. So, the flash flood threat where you see this orange shaded area across coastal sections of North Carolina extending into the region right along the border with South Carolina. There is a level three out of four for that potential. An additional three to six inches of rainfall is possible. But Idalia is moving along very quickly, about 21 miles per hour.
 
So, the faster it moves, the less rainfall accumulation we'll see there. We'll keep you updated. Rosemary?
 <br>[02:05:01]
 
CHURCH: And we appreciate that. Karen Maginnis joining us there.
 
Well, residents along Florida's Gulf Coast have begun the cleanup after Idalia sparked widespread flooding. CNN's Gloria Pazmino joins us now from the city of Crystal River. So Gloria, what is the situation on the ground this hour and what's the extent of the damage done where you are?
 
GLORIA PAZMINO, CNN NEWSOURCE NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Rosemary, it is going to be a critical for cleanup which you just mentioned tomorrow morning at first light here in Crystal River where we are. There is now a curfew in place here in town because officials want people out of the way as they try and get to people who may still potentially be in need of some help. So, curfew in place until 6:00 tomorrow. 6:00 a.m. in the morning, tomorrow, local time. That's when people will be allowed back in and the process of cleanup and recovering can begin. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
PAZMINO (voiceover): Hurricane Idalia pummeled Florida's Gulf Coast, bringing winds of up to 125 miles per hour. The gusts strong enough to topple trees by this house in Perry, Florida.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No.
 
PAZMINO (voiceover): The powerful category three hurricane making landfall Wednesday and unleashing heavy rains and triggering record breaking storm surge.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We just knew that storm surge was going to be coming in mix with that high tide. That was the scariest part.
 
PAZMINO (voiceover): Streets along the coast swallowed by water.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: These are all little old school Florida villas, and they were just picked up and carried into the Gulf. So that was heartbreaking to see.
 
PAZMINO (voiceover): Hundreds of thousands of homes are without power in Georgia and Florida. And the widespread flooding forcing major highways like U.S. 19 and Citrus County to close.
 
SHERIFF MIKE PRENDERGAST, CITRUS COUNTY, FLORIDA: This road is shut down and major portions of my county right now due to the storm surge that we're seeing.
 
PAZMINO (voiceover): Several thousand homes along the coast in Pasco County now underwater.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have water at least 18 inches or higher that have gone into these homes.
 
PAZMINO (voiceover): Idalia turn northeast to Georgia as a category one hurricane and then a tropical storm, unleashing heavy rains and strong winds. All of Georgia is now under a state of emergency.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's a dangerous storm people need to prepare.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
PAZMINO: Now, Rosemary, I just want to give you an idea of what we were looking at here all day. I've been standing at the same intersection for most of the day. And earlier on, this was very hard to navigate. In fact, most cars could not get across. Much of the water has receded. That is very good news. And it's heading back out in that direction. That is where the Gulf of Mexico meets the river.
 
And when those two bodies of water merge during the storm, a lot of the water came flooding in. City hall here in Crystal River. The mayor told us the building took about eight feet of water when the storm surge came in. So that gives you an idea of just how much damage was done. How much cleanup is going to have to happen tomorrow morning when people start to get back and try to assess the damage.
 
But for the most part, all good news. There's been a reported -- no fatalities reported here in this area. And 76 people in total were rescued here in this county. So, for the most part, it looks like people heeded the warnings to get out when they did and tomorrow morning they'll have a chance to come back home start the recovery process as the worst of the storm is finally over.  Rosemary?
 
CHURCH: All right. Gloria Pazmino in Crystal River, Florida. Many thanks for that report.
 
Well, meantime, Cuba is trying to dry out from Idalia. The western tip of the island got doused and hundreds of thousands lost power. CNN's Patrick Oppmann shows us the damage.
 
PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Idalia brought so much rain to this part of Western Cuba that if I had been here during the height of the storm, residents say I would have been completely underwater. Those floodwaters are now receding. But you can see behind me that there's still some homes in the distance there that have been cut off by the heavy, heavy rain that Idalia brought to this rural part of Cuba.
 
Residents say that officials had to come in the middle of the storm and rescue. A lot of people from these homes, dozens of people they say who are up on the roofs are in danger of being swept away by floodwaters. Miraculously, they say no one was injured. No one lost their life. Although, obviously there is damage to people's homes, to people's property, that's always very tough to see particularly in a part of Cuba.
 
People appear to have so little. There is something of a silver lining, though, to the storm for Cuba. And that is residents telling me that they had been experiencing a severe drought this summer. And so, the heavy rain will actually help with that. Idalia did not hit this part of Cuba as strongly as it is hitting Florida. It came in as a tropical storm then gained strength, left as a category one storm.
 <br>[16:10:07]
 
And that's why we don't see as much damage here. For the most part, trees have not being not knocked down, powerlines in some places, power is being restored. Hundreds of thousands of people were without power, that is slowly being restored. All the same though, people in this part of Cuba are used to hurricanes, it's part of life here. And they say that with months -- with months left to go in this hurricane season. They're not letting down their guard just yet.
 
Patrick Oppmann, CNN, the town of Isabel Rubio, Cuba.
 
CHURCH: Two major storms are also bearing down on China's. Super Typhoon Saola is expected to approach Hong Kong late Friday. Right now, it's southwest of Taiwan with sustained winds of 250 kilometers per hour. The equivalent of a strong category four hurricane. Meantime Tropical Storm Haikui is forecast to strengthen to a typhoon over the next 24 to 36 hours as it passes south of Okinawa, Japan.
 
It's currently projected to make landfall on Sunday morning in eastern China as the equivalent of a category one or two.
 
Russia is getting a reminder that the war in Ukraine is too close for comfort even in areas far from the border. Officials say air defenses shot down a drone headed towards Moscow Thursday morning which came on the heels of the biggest wave of drone attacks Russia has seen since the war began. Six Russian regions came under attack Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, but across the border.
 
Ukrainian officials say Kyiv also came under attack the most powerful assault in months. But Ukraine says it shot down dozens of drones and missiles near Kyiv and across the country.
 
And for more, CNN Investigative Reporter Katie Polglase joins us now live from London. Good to see you, Katie. So, what more are you learning about what appears to be the biggest drone assault on Russian territory since Moscow launched its war on Ukraine?
 
KATIE POLGLASE, CNN INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER: While Rosemarie it's clear that drone and drone warfare is an increasing part of this war both, as you say in the Russian side and also, on the Ukrainian side. We saw another reported attack on Moscow this morning. According to the Moscow mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, that was intercepted, there's no reported damage or casualties yet.
 
And this as you say comes in a week of intense drone assaults on the Russian territories. This is the biggest since the war began. And it covers a wide range of regions from Skov in the north, far beyond Moscow, far away from the Ukrainian frontline. That targeted an airport. Apparently, it seemed to target military and civilian aircrafts or at the aircraft but for were damaged, four military aircrafts.
 
Also, it targeted a region in Bryansk. That is bordering with Ukraine. There they seem to be targeting a T.V. tower according to the Bryansk governor there. And this is really showing the way the war is moving here because it's notable that these drones if they are coming from Ukraine and Ukraine has not claimed credit for these attacks yet, notably, but they are widely suspected to be behind them. 
 
If they are using these drones. It may be that these are Ukrainian- made drones because under agreements with their Western allies, Ukraine cannot use drones inside Russian territory. And so, if they are using them, this can show the capability, the manufacturing capability developing at home in Ukraine. And the tactic here is clear. With that although they have not said they are behind it. It is clear the tactic is to bring the war home to Russia.
 
And we heard yesterday from Ukraine's special adviser to the president Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The advising has positively said that it's clear from these drone attacks that the war is moving to Russia's territory and it cannot be stopped. That is the intention here to make the war be felt at home here by the Russian people as it is being felt clearly by the Ukrainian people. Because at the same time that these drone attacks were happening, there were also drone attacks, other missile attacks, other forms of aerial bombardment across Ukraine, in particular on Kyiv.
 
So some of the most intense shelling of missile attacks and drones Tuesday into Wednesday night with two dead as a result. So, it shows that this drone attack, these types of drone attacks will only continue. Rosemary?
 
CHURCH: Katie Polglase, many thanks for that report. Appreciate it.
 
Well, Christiane Amanpour anchors her show from Ukraine all week. Tune in at 6:00 p.m. in London for special reporting and coverage.
 
North Korea reportedly fired two ballistic missiles late Wednesday describing it as a tactical nuclear strike drill.
 <br>[02:15:01]
 
Pyongyang says the launches are a response to the U.S. deploying "strategic assets" as part of this month's joint U.S. and South Korean military drills. The missiles came down in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan. This latest provocation from the North happened hours after South Korea says the U.S. flew a B-1B strategic bomber over the Yellow Sea in connection with the joint military exercises.
 
A Ukrainian city hopes to keep its students in class despite a near constant threat of Russian strikes. Still to come. A plan to keep children's education on track by going underground.
 
Plus. Celebrations in the streets of Gabon after the military stages a coup in the Central African country and arrests the President. We'll have details after the break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHURCH: It's not your typical subway station the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv has set up 60 Underground classrooms in the subway ahead of the new school year. The city is regularly attacked by Russian shelling and missile strikes and subway stations have been the main places to shelter. The new classrooms will accommodate about a thousand students with plans to set up even more rooms.
 
It's part of an effort for safe in-person learning several days a week despite Russia's war on Ukraine.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): I support that the children will study in the subway. The lack of socializing. The children will be able to socialize with each other find a common language, communicate. The classes or twice a week, three hours every time. It is not every day. I absolutely support this. (END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: A new report from UNICEF says there is widespread learning loss among Ukraine's children due to the war and the COVID-19 pandemic. Continued attacks inside Ukraine and low enrollment for refugee students in host countries have left millions of children and teenagers struggling to learn. The U.N. agencies says there are signs of deteriorating abilities in language, reading and mathematics.
 
And without a consistent education, students are struggling to retain what they learn. Well, joining me now is James Elder. The spokesperson for UNICEF. Appreciate you joining us.
 
JAMES ELDER, SPOKESPERSON, UNICEF: Hi there. Good morning, Rosemary.
 
CHURCH: UNICEF has released this report on education in Ukraine revealing shocking statistics of nearly seven million children experiencing this widespread learning loss within the war-torn nation and low-level school enrollment in host nations. What needs to be done about this critical issue and what's your organization's message to the world about this?
 <br>[02:20:09]
 
ELDER: You're right, it is shocking and it's quite heartbreaking. I think you just showed some of the things UNICEF is doing that I've not seen elsewhere in crises. We are building bunkers, reinforcing basements, making sure they've got water and power or a small generator. Training tens of thousands of teachers in things like mental health, because there's so many roles now for teachers beyond the traditional teaching.
 
So there's a huge amount there's online learning for children that, Rosemary, as you said that the indiscriminate attacks on schools are a week by week proposition for boys and girls. And what it means is that as this war began, 18 months ago, 18 long months ago, now, boys and girls had to learn what an air raid siren meant, and that men get out of your bed and get to a basement.
 
Now they're learning about these merciless things underground called landmines. Meanwhile, Rosemary, as you said, they're learning in maths and in languages, that is -- that is declining. But their mental health is spiking those struggles. It's a -- it's a sinister combination. And it is because this is a war on children.
 
CHURCH: Yeah. And UNICEF also recently launched a program that allows nurses to visit hard to reach families in their homes and help with babies and toddlers. So, how is that program progressing and what more needs to be done to help these families and of course, these very young children?
 
ELDER: Yes, it's a really critical one. As we've seen so many thousands of hospitals and clinics, and Ukraine's Medical Systems has been a really strong one for the people there, but so many thousands have been damaged or destroyed. And so, it's so critical that we have these nurses and UNICEF, again, does this very, very important training so that they have additional skills, and they will go to new months.
 
And they'll go at least 10 times over three years. And they'll talk to them about any leads their child may have. Any issues maybe from breastfeeding or it may be again, the mental health struggles they're going with or that they're on the move or that they can't get to a clinic. So UNICEF now has these nurses ensuring that they get to the frontlines, they get to where families need them.
 
And I think that's one of the things that UNICEF has done so frequently. Whether it's rebuilding water points or mental health or education in a classroom or in a bunker. It's trying to adapt, knowing that this war still is ongoing, still is coming to real civilian areas. It's trying to adapt to that and to get some semblance of reality for boys and girls because it's the reality that -- of war that they just keep enduring.
 
CHURCH: And James, you did mention mine safety as another big problem in Ukraine. Talk to us about how UNICEF is helping to improve safety when it comes to the dangers posed by what is now an increasing number of these mines. And the flooding of the dam made that even worse, doesn't it?
 
ELDER: Yes, spot on. I mean, it's probably the coolest part of war, Rosemary, because when the guns finally will fall silent as they always do, landmines mean that the war continues. It means that families can't return. It means that growing crops becomes a life- threatening task. It means over summer, this of course, has been summer in Ukraine. And boys and girls are, you know, naturally adventurous.
 
So those places they go to a river, as you rightly say, or an abandoned building, these places can become lethal. So again, UNICEF has trained thousands of teachers, mine-risk education for boys and girls for -- two and three, four-year-olds and little fun interactions to teenagers is now mandatory in Ukraine. It's become one of the most mined countries on the planet. And again, this is what we struggle with because, you know, these boys and girls are going to be an economic powerhouse for Ukraine.
 
That is, you know, skills and education really are that they're a bridge, not just to dreams but for prosperity, Rosemary for communities. But at the moment we keep seeing from the Russian Federation these bridge -- bridges figure tree -- figuratively rather and literally being destroyed.
 
CHURCH: James Elder, many thanks for joining us. And of course, for the great work that you do. Appreciate it.
 
Well, Russia is proposing a new Black Sea Grain Deal but not for Ukraine. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and his Turkish counterpart is set to meet in Moscow over the next couple of days to discuss the proposal. Russia says it will sell Turkey millions of tons of grain at a discount with the financial support of Qatar which Turkey would process and ship to countries in need.
 
The original Black Sea deal enabled Ukraine to safely export their grain but Russia pulled out of the agreement last month.
 <br>[02:25:04]
 
CHURCH: Well, meantime, a new report says Russia's war on Ukraine has caused one of the most disruptive periods in decades for the global food supply. The report from America's top spy agencies says the war drove up the cost of grain, increasing the risk of food insecurity and nations in the Middle East and North Africa. While that problem has somewhat abated this year, the report says the future of global food prices depends on the Black Sea initiative which enabled Ukraine to export its grain.
 
Russia ended that deal as we mentioned in July. Before the war, Russia and Ukraine were among the world's largest exporters of grain and other agricultural products.
 
Well, the U.K. has joined France, the U.S. the United Nations and the African Union's Peace and Security Council in condemning Wednesday's military coup in the Central African nation of Gabon. President Ali Bongo whose family has ruled Gabon for more than 50 years was placed under house arrest by the military leaders. More details now from CNN'S David McKenzie.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ALI BONGO ONDIMBA, PRESIDENT OF GABON: I'm Ali Bongo Ondimba, president of Gabon. And I'm to send a message to all the friends that we have all over the world to tell them to make noise, to make noise.
 
DAVE MCKENZIE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): It's an extraordinary appeal in English. Just hours ago, Ali Bongo seemed untouchable. Now he's under house arrest.
 
Because of this. In this season of coups. A group of army officers making an all-familiar announcement.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): I have decided to defend the peace by putting an end to the current regime. The general elections on August 26, 2023, as well as truncated results are canceled.
 
MCKENZIE (voiceover): On the streets of Libreville celebrations, shouts of liberation from some, and as seen replayed over and over in recent months. The coup leaders say that the just concluded polls were not transparent and said Bongo's leadership threatened "chaos." International observers weren't allowed in and the internet was curtailed. From former columnist France a well-practiced response.
 
OLIVIER VERAN, FRENCH GOVERNMENT SPOKESPERSON (through translator): France condemns the military coup that is underway in Gabon and France is closely monitoring the evolution of the situation on the ground and reiterates its desire to see the results of the election respected once it's known.
 
MCKENZIE (voiceover): Gabon, the latest in a cascade of coups on the African continent, if solidified, it will be the eighth in central and West Africa since just 2020. Most of them former French colonies, but each of them a different cocktail of power plays and discontent. 
 
In Gabon, the citizens have lived under a dynastic regime for more than 50 years. Omar Bongo ruled for more than four decades, much of that time spent in France, a critical ally. The elder Bongo, members of his family and confidants were accused of eyewatering corruption. Often linked to OPEC member Gabon's significant oil wealth. Ali Bongo took over from his father in 2009.
 
He has been praised for conserving Gabon's vast forests and taking innovative steps to develop carbon credits to combat climate change. But he's faced growing discontent from many, with violence breaking out after disputed polls in 2016 and an attempted coup three years later. But these scenes have wider consequences. Many fear that Gabon is not the last domino to fall, African Union and international actors have failed to effectively counter recent military takeovers and Bongo's fate in house arrest remains tenuous.
 
ONDIMBA: I'm calling you to make noise, to make noise, to make noise --
 
MCKENZIE (voiceover): David McKenzie, CNN, Johannesburg.

CHURCH: A shooting in the West Bank leaves one Palestinian dead. It is the first time this year that Palestinian authorities security forces have killed another Palestinian. That story just ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:32:38]
 
CHURCH: New details on our top story, the deadly fire that tore through a building in Johannesburg. Authorities now say, at least 58 people have been killed. The death toll, more than doubling in the past hour. 43 others are injured. 
 
The fire broke out around 1:30 am, local time, at a five story building in the city's central business district. Firefighters are still trying to contain the flames. No word yet on what caused the fire. We will of course bring you updates on the story as they become available. 
 
In Jerusalem, a man was shot and killed after allegedly stabbing another man at a Jerusalem train station in what Israeli police are labeling a terror attack. Israeli police accrediting an alert officer, for, quote, "neutralizing" the man with a knife on Wednesday evening. 
 
Police say the stabbing was witnessed by the border patrol officer who was on a train. He then got off the train, and fired on the suspect, killing him. The suspect is identified as being from east Jerusalem. 
 
The 25-year-old stabbing victim was taken to the hospital and is said to be in moderate condition. In the meantime, in the West Bank, Palestinian authority security forces and militant fighters reportedly got into a brief gun battle last week with at least one Palestinian man killed. CNN's Hadas Gold has details.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT: This was a rare clash between Palestinian authority security forces and militants in the west bank. And it resulted in the first Palestinian to be killed by Palestinian authority security forces this year. 
 
And the reaction from the militant groups has also been harsh, it highlights the widening gap between the official Palestinian institutions and the militant groups which hold increasing sway and power especially in the northern part of the West Bank where this happened. 
 
Now violence has been surging across the occupied West Bank over the past year and a half with the Israeli government saying the Palestinian authority's lack of action compels the Israeli military, they say, to conduct regular raids across the West Bank to tamp down militant activity. 
 
So what happened was that a gun battle erupted in the town of Tulkarm after Palestinian authority security forces say that their forces entered the refugee camp there to remove what they called hazardous materials and barriers, including some that were near a school.
 <br>[02:35:03]
 
And that they then came under fire from armed youths in the area. A local journalist told CNN that the forces entered the camp to remove unarmed IEDs that were put in place to target Israeli forces if and when they were to enter a refugee camp. 
 
Now, security forces say that they took, quite, "necessary measures to control the situation." Now, the man killed is identified as a 22- year-old, Abdel Qader Zaqdah. His brother told CNN that he was an electrician and claimed that he was not associated with any militant groups. 
 
But the militant groups have called this, like Hamas said, a crime against our people. And the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigade, which is associated with the Fatah party, the dominant party in the Palestinian authority accused the Palestinian authority forces of assisting the Israelis and announced that official security forces from the Palestine authority were now, quote, "prohibited from entering the Tulkarm refugee camp". 
 
The militants also warned that the Palestinian security forces will be treated, quote, "like the occupation", meaning the Israeli forces if they came into the camp. Hadas Gold, CNN, Jerusalem.

Back in the United States amid hurricane Idalia's powerful winds,
 
 heavy rain, lightning, thunder and tornadoes, one more rare weather event, St. Elmo's fire.  Take a look at this from the cockpit of a military plane evacuating the Macdill Air Force Base in Florida before Idalia's arrival. It looks like purple lightning, but actually it's luminous plasma, created as a result of friction inside a storm cloud. Sailors have reported seeing it for hundreds of years, so it's named after St. Elmo, the patron saint of sailors. 
 
It's not dangerous on its own, but it often signals lightning is coming. Finally tonight, crowded airports, with delayed flights are the last place many of us want to be. But for some people they symbolize adventure or long-awaited reunions with loved ones. For one couple, the Auckland Airport became that and more.
