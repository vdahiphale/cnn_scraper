BIANCA NOBILO, CNN ANCHOR: The Vatican says that the Pope Francis's health is improving and that he could in fact leave the hospital within the next few days. Sources tell us that the pontiff has spent a second restful night at Rome's Camilli Hospital. He's been there since Wednesday after complaining of breathing problems. And Barbie Nadeau is live from Rome. Barbie, this is all sounding very encouraging. 
 
BARBIE NADEAU, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: That's right. The Vatican issued a statement last night saying he was responding to the antibiotics for his respiratory infection. And he tweeted from his Twitter account, Pontifex. 
 
I am touched by the many messages received in these hours and I express my gratitude for the closeness and prayer. 
 
And you know people around him say that he is doing a little bit of work. He's reading the newspaper. He's having breakfast, things like that. 
 
You know, this is a very important week coming up, and it might take some sort of divine intervention to get him, you know, to celebrate the Palm Sunday mass this coming weekend. But everyone around the world, Catholics and non-Catholics alike are hoping that he can in some way be well enough to participate in the Easter week festivities a week from now, Bianca. 
 
NOBILO: Barbie Nadeau in Rome, thank you. 
 
In a few days Donald Trump is expected to leave his Florida home and surrender in New York on numerous charges of business fraud. Just ahead, we'll hear what some of his strongest supporters have to say about the former president's indictment.

NOBILO: Welcome back to CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Bianca Nobilo. And here are some of today's top stories for you. Donald Trump is indicted by a grand jury in New York. Sources tell CNN
 
 that the former U.S. president faces more than 30 counts related to business fraud. He's expected to appear in a Manhattan courtroom on Tuesday. 
 
Evan Gershkovich, an American reporter for the "Wall Street Journal," is detained in Russia on suspicion of espionage. The "Wall Street Journal" categorically rejects the allegations. 
 
And the Vatican says that Pope Francis' health is improving, and he could be released in the next few days. The 86-year-old pontiff is receiving antibiotics for a bronchitis infection. 
 
Former U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to surrender next Tuesday in New York City after he was indicted on what sources say are more than 30 counts related to business fraud. A few dozen supporters gathered outside Trump's Florida home after the news broke late Thursday. Details of the charges remain sealed. For the latest. Here's CNN's Alayna Treene in Washington. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ALAYNA TREENE, CNN REPORTER: So, Trump's team is scrambling. They were totally caught off guard on Thursday, even though they had been expecting a potential indictment for some time, they didn't think it was going to come this soon. Now one of Trump's advisers told me shortly after the indictment that they were, quote, blindsided by the timing. They believed, like much of the media have been reporting on Wednesday, that the grand jury would be breaking for the religious holidays and potential indictment wouldn't come until mid April. 
 
But in recent days, I would argue that the Trump team had increasingly began to question whether the Manhattan district attorney's case was falling apart. We saw Donald Trump himself right on Truth Social just hours before the indictment, that he is, quote, gained such respect for the New York grand jury and believed that they were perhaps reconsidering an indictment, which obviously was not the case. 
 
And just to take a step back, as much as we've seen Donald Trump lean into his own defense and try to project confidence that he'll come out on top at the end of this, including in the statement that he released shortly after learning of the indictment. This is really a jarring moment for him. He now has to go through the process of getting arrested and getting fingerprinted. 
 
And while Trump himself and his team believe that indictment will ultimately help him politically, he doesn't want to be indicted. This is a point that his advisers have acknowledged to me over the past several weeks over and over again. 
 
It also reminds me of reporting I did on Donald Trump during impeachment. He did not want to have impeached president on his resume, regardless of how much it may have routed his face behind him, and regardless of whether his advisors and others thought that it would benefit him politically in the long run. Now what he's facing, though, is not an impeachment. It's a criminal
 
 indictment, and he's virtually no control over how this legal process will play out.

NOBILO: For more legal analysis, I'm joined now by Bernarda Villalona, a criminal defense attorney and former prosecutor in New York. It's great to have you on the program. Thanks so much for joining us. 
 
BERNARDA VILLALONA, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Thank you for having me Bianca. 
 
NOBILO: So, let's begin with a simple question. What is next now in this legal process? 
 
VILLALONA: Well, the next step in this legal process for Donald Trump is that he's going to have to surrender, meaning that he will have to come from whether it's Florida or wherever he situation -- situated to New York. 
 
And when he comes to New York he's going to be presented in front of a judge. But before he's even presented in front of a judge, he has to go to the arrest process. Which means that he has to be fingerprinted and a photograph known as a mug shot has to be taken from him. 
 
Also he will be given a New York State identification number, because now he is a person has gone through the arrest process. Once he goes before a judge, a judge would notify him of what his charges are. The official indictment will be unsealed. So, he will know whether he's facing just misdemeanor charges or misdemeanor and felony charges. 
 
The charges will be read out loud to him if he chooses to, and from there, he has an opportunity to either plead guilty or not guilty. And then the judge has the ultimate determination of whether to release him on his own recognizance, which is probably highly likely because it's a crime that is non-violent. 
 
So after that, we'll get another court date. Actually a few court days to determine whether they'll be hearings and motions. But this is the first step in a long, drawn-out legal process, criminal legal process for the former president. 
 
NOBILO: And what else would we expect to see at the arraignment reportedly next Tuesday? Who will be presiding? Might there be cameras? What more can you tell us? 
 
VILLALONA: So, well, New York is not automatic that cameras are allowed in the courtroom. The judge has to make the determination whether he will allow cameras in the courtroom to photograph or videotape or do one or the other because it's not automatic. It maybe possible that he may just allow one photographer and one videographer. 
 <br>[04:40:00] But it's all going to be to the discretion of the judge. Because, of course, Donald Trump's camp and the defense attorneys need to preserve the record and say that the unnecessary publicity may be able to determine in terms of make it highly unlikely that he'll get a fair trial in New York. But the reality is that he is the former president, so it's going to be highly unlikely that anyone will be able to sit on a jury and have not heard about this case. 
 
But aside from that, it's going to be a quick proceeding, normal than five or 10 minutes. It is very quite common. Hundreds of arrangements take place in New York on a daily basis. 
 
NOBILO: And Bernarda, for the benefit of our international viewers, constitutionally there would be nothing to prohibit Donald Trump for continuing to run for president facing these charges. 
 
VILLALONA: That is correct. At this point he is presumed innocent and what he has is open charges. He hasn't been convicted of anything so he can still run for president with an open indictment. 
 
NOBILO: But if convicted, the former president would be facing jail time. 
 
VILLALONA: That is correct. So, if former President Donald Trump is convicted of a misdemeanor, the most he can face is one year incarceration. If he is convicted of a felony, the most he can faces four years incarceration. But I'll have to say, based on my experience of having been a prosecutor here in New York for 13 years and a criminal defense attorney, that is highly unlikely that any judge on these charges that we presume of falsifying business records that he will be sentenced to any period of incarceration on these charges that we think he's going to be facing. 
 
NOBILO: Bernarda Villalona, thank you so much for joining us today. That was an incredibly helpful and insightful breakdown. Really appreciate it. 
 
VILLALONA: Thank you.

SUAREZ (voice-over): Hale took six lives on Monday. three nine-year- old children, a substitute teacher, a custodian, and the head of the Covenant School, Katherine Koonce, who may have died trying to protect the children.

VERONICA MIRACLE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Gwyneth Paltrow was stoic when she found out that she had won her case and that the jury was awarding her that symbolic $1 in damages that she was seeking.
 
The jury deliberated for less than three hours. And they found that the man who accused Paltrow of crashing into him and causing him a lasting brain injury was actually at fault. This case was really a he said she said situation. Both sides completely argued two different stories.
 
The plaintiff, Terry Sanderson, said Paltrow skied into him, causing lasting injuries, including brain damage and broken ribs and then skied off. He was suing her for $3.2 million in damages. Paltrow claimed Sanderson skied into her. She countersued for a symbolic $1 in damages and won.

 Her attorney said she is very happy with the outcome.
 
STEVE OWENS, GWYNETH PALTROW'S ATTORNEY: We're pleased with this outcome and appreciate the judge and jury's thoughtful handling of this case.
