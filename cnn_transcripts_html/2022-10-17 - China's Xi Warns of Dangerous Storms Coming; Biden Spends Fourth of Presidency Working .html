ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN ANCHOR: Satellite internet service that has been used by both civilians and troops on the front line in Ukraine, that they wanted the Pentagon to start picking up most of the tab. 
 
Now, what I think most people didn't realize is that this was an international consortium. There were a lot of different groups and countries behind the payments for Starlink in Ukraine. But SpaceX was out there and Elon Musk was out there taking a lot of credit, literally saying verbatim, you're welcome, Ukraine. 
 
BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN ANCHOR: This was a - this was a PR coup for him. I mean I think that's the thing, you reported this great reporting on Thursday, and it was just a report on what was going on, which you broke, and it looked really bad for Elon Musk because here he is getting all of this credit at the beginning of the war when all eyes are on Ukraine, it looked great for him. And then as people maybe are paying a little less attention, he's like, hey, this is costing a lot of money.
 
MARQUARDT: Right.
 
KEILAR: I'm not going to foot the bill. My DOD needs to foot the bill. I guess my question is, if DOD ends up footing the bill, I mean if that's a possibility, then what happens? Does he say, na, no thanks, I'll go ahead and pick up the tab? 
 
MARQUARDT: Well, that's the big question is whether SpaceX and Elon Musk now go to the Pentagon and say, you know what, we're rescinding our request. And that request was for the Pentagon to start paying for all the services of the existing Starlink terminals in Ukraine and all the on - the new requests to the tune of $124 million for the rest of the year, a rate that could be around $400 million for the next 12 months. 
 
So, the big question for us today is, and we will be asking the Pentagon this, is - is SpaceX rescinding that? Is - is the Pentagon going to be paying for Starlink Ukraine, which is now - which is completely justifiable. SpaceX I not a charity. It - you know, defense contractors like Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, they are paid. But the point is that Elon Musk and SpaceX were out there saying we're doing this great service for Ukraine. There were others who were involved in paying for it and they themselves were going to the Pentagon asking them to pay for it. 
 
KEILAR: Well, now we all know again that they have been paying for Starlink. Maybe that's a PR win in itself. We'll see. 
 
MARQUARDT: It's - it's - it'll be -- it'll be amazing to see what - what actually happens -
 
KEILAR: Yes.
 
MARQUARDT: Because to some extent they are speaking out of both sides of their mouths. 
 
KEILAR: Yes. 
 
MARQUARDT: Well, Chinese Leader Xi Jinping is putting the world on notice, while kicking off the communist party congress in Beijing, where he is poised to secure a norm-breaking third term in power. Xi warned against any interference in Taiwan, which is a self-governing democracy that Beijing claims, of course, as its own territory. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
PRESIDENT XI JINPING, CHINA (through translator): We will continue to strive for peaceful reunification with the greatest of sincerity and the utmost effort, but we will never promise to renounce the use of force and we reserve the option of taking all measures necessary. This is directed solely at interference by outside forces and a few separatists seeking Taiwan independence. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MARQUARDT: Joining us now to discuss is CNN global economic analyst Rana Foroohar. She is the author of a new book out tomorrow titled "Homecoming: The Path to Prosperity in a Post Global World."
 
Rana, congratulations on your new book. 
 
I want to ask you what this would mean if Xi Jinping were to - you know, as he's expected to extend his rule, possibly for life, what would that mean for economic relations between the U.S. and China in the coming years? 
 
KEILAR: All we're -
 
MARQUARDT: All right.
 
KEILAR: I thought maybe it was just us who couldn't hear Rana, but apparently it's a technical difficulty. 
 
MARQUARDT: We'll get her back. 
 
KEILAR: We're going to get her back. We'll take a quick break and we'll see Rana then. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[06:37:34]
 
MARQUARDT: And CNN global economic analyst Rana Foroohar is back with us. 
 
Now, Rana, I think your - your microphone's working now. 
 
RANA FOROOHAR, CNN GLOBAL ECONOMIC ANALYST: Yes.
 
MARQUARDT: We were asking about Xi Jinping and the prospect of him becoming a leader for the foreseeable future in China, leader for life some are saying. What impact is that going to have on economic relations between the U.S. and China in the near future? 
 
FOROOHAR: Well, so, as we all know, relations have been strained for years now. You know, trade wars started under the Trump administration. The Biden administration has really recently put on the strictest set of tariffs and limits on high-tech equipment coming in from China and out to China. There are now limits on the highest end chips. 
 
And this is something I talk about in my new book "Homecoming" that we are really headed for a bipolar world when it comes to U.S./Chinese economic relations. There are going to be two entirely different ecosystems with technology. I expect that supply chains are going to shift dramatically. That's something that's been coming for a long time. 
 
I mean, if you think about it, the idea that we ever thought it was smart to put 92 percent of all high-end chips in Taiwan, which is, you know, probably next to Ukraine the most geopolitically contentious part of the world, just not a good idea. And so I think war in Ukraine, the pandemic, a lot of things have been like a scrim (ph) that have been pulled up on a lot of folks saying, you know, this relationship is troubled and there needs to be some separation. So, I expect that that's going to continue. 
 
But de-couplings happen for a lot of reasons. You know, it's not just geopolitics, it's the environment. Companies are thinking, do they want to spend a lot of energy and emissions toting products through the South China Seas. There are new technologies that allow us to make more at home. So, I think that there's just going to be a lot of changes in the way companies and countries do business in the future, particularly between the U.S. and China. 
 
KEILAR: Yes, and that adjustment that you're talking about, and you talk about this in your book, comes from, obviously, lessons learned from globalization. What do you think some of the biggest ones are? 
 
FOROOHAR: You know, there was this assumption for the last 40 years that money, goods, people were going to be able to travel wherever they wanted to most freely and that they were going to land where it was most productive. And while that created a lot of global growth, it also created tremendous in country inequality. So, you saw the hollowing out of the rust belt, of parts of the south. This is true in many countries. So, I think a lot of people just felt like, gosh, the global economy
 
 has gotten so far ahead of national politics and are our domestic concerns being looked at closely enough? 
 <br>[06:40:09]
 
And so I think now you're starting to see a rebalancing between local and global and people saying, you know what, the economy needs to work for me here at home. It needs to work for my community. I don't want just cheaper and cheaper goods in Walmart. I want a good job. I want a job that pays a middle class living that I can afford health care, housing, education for my children. So that's really what this new localism is about. And I talk about a lot of the ways in my book that it's playing out in agriculture and retail and technology. 
 
MARQUARDT: How do you see that equalization playing out? How much of a shift needs to happen, in your opinion, from globalization to a more localized economy? 
 
FOROOHAR: Well, I think it's happening in lots of different ways. Let me start with the technological shifts that are happening that are - that are just really incredible. One of the things I look at in my book is 3D printing, additive (ph) manufacturing. This idea that you can just make parts, you can literally spray paint parts, things as big as a car or a house even. I've seen entire $250,000 houses going up in six days, being spray painted locally in Austin, Texas. You know, this is incredible. You don't need to spend tons of money and energy and emissions toting things from Asia to make products anymore. 
 
And that's true all over the world, right? So, I think that there's a -- there's just a massive shift going on in how manufacturing works. It's going to bring jobs closer to home. It's going to mean that production and consumption, buyers and sellers get hubbed (ph) more closely. And I think that that's good for the economy. It means we're going to have a more balanced economy. 
 
MARQUARDT: Yes, major shifts on the horizon.
 
Rana Foroohar, sounds fascinating. Congratulations on your new book. 
 
FOROOHAR: Thank you. 
 
MARQUARDT: And best of luck. 
 
FOROOHAR: Thank you so much. 
 
KEILAR: This morning, new CNN reporting says President Biden has spent more than a fourth of his presidency working from his home state of Delaware. His time away from the White House is now outpacing former President Trump's time away. 
 
CNN's Kate Bennett joins us now on this. 
 
So, how many days has he spent away from the White House? 
 
KATE BENNETT, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Days away from the White House, very many - well, a lot of days. But days in Delaware is what we counted. He's up to about 174, if you count today, which he's coming back to the White House today. So, clearly, you know, he's never, you know, been a guy to say, I don't go to Delaware. When he was a senator he would go almost every day, every weekend, all the time. 
 
But this is a significant number because he is outpacing most of his predecessors, including Donald Trump, who was at about 135 days at his homes during his presidency at this tenure. 
 
And I, you know, I will say -- people will say, you know, but he's the president. He can work from anywhere. He's allowed to go home. And shout-out to my Twitter friends who are going to say that to me later on.
 
It is true, of course, a president can do his job from anywhere. And I think that that's really important to think about, especially as our norms of work from home have changed post-pandemic. So, certainly, you know, it's not necessarily a condemnation of this, but it is a significant amount. He leaves the White House in Washington just about every Friday, takes the pets with him, typically the first lady goes, and it becomes a place where he's, you know, working and getting things done and being productive, but it's not Washington. It's not the White House. 
 
KEILAR: Look, the fact is, if something big happens, a president, any president, comes back. So that tells you there are some things they cannot do. There are also something to be said for getting away. I think everyone knows that, especially - I mean not everyone knows what it's like to be in that cage of the White House, which is how many presidents relate to it. 
 
BENNETT: Yes. Yes.
 
KEILAR: Also, I wanted to ask you, Jill Biden was at the Eagles game last night? 
 
BENNETT: She was. She was there to attend a cancer awareness event with the NFL. And she came out to do the coin toss. And there was some booing. Not this clip but, you know, there were people in the crowd who really booed her. Now, this is significant. Eagles fans are Eagles fans. Again, don't -- 
 
KEILAR: They would boo their mother, Kate.
 
BENNETT: Don't -- don't tweet at me. 
 
KEILAR: Eagles fans would boo their own mothers. 
 
BENNETT: I know, but this is Jill from Philly. I mean no one makes a bigger deal about being a Philly girl than the president and the first lady herself. She is a Phillies baseball fan. She was watching them the other night. She tweeted a picture of herself on her plane watching the Phillies game.
 
And then last night she was at the Eagles game. So, it's a little bit of a, you know,  it must sting a little bit more to be booed in your own place. But, you know, this is -- this is the political culture and this is people expressing themselves at a football game. And she moved on and waved and, you know, watched the game, as she does. 
 
KEILAR: Yes.
 
BENNETT: But, yes.
 
KEILAR: What I mean is they would boo their mother if they supported the candidate that they did not support. 
 
BENNETT: Your mother.
 
KEILAR: And this goes for both sides. I think that is something that's very true. 
 
BENNETT: Agreed. Agreed. Take into account.
 
KEILAR: Kate, thank you soi much for that. 
 
BENNETT: Thank you.
 
KEILAR: A game changer for millions of Americans who cannot afford hearing aids. Now they are available over the counter for so much less. 
 
MARQUARDT: And, high profile trials with jurors behaving badly. What they did to get themselves removed from their cases. 
 <br>[06:45:01]
 
We'll be right back. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
MARQUARDT: Starting today, millions of Americans can now buy over the counter hearing aids in stores and online without a prescription. That's a huge change that is going to help keep more money in your pocket. 
 
Joining me now is CNN health reporter Jacqueline Howard. 
 
Jacqueline, who exactly are these over the counter hearing aids meant for? 
 
JACQUELINE HOWARD, CNN HEALTH REPORTER: Alex, this is exciting news for adults with mild to moderate hearing loss. That's the group that these over the counter hearing aids will be available for. 
 
And when you look at the numbers, that means this is going to change the lives of about 28.8 million adults who could benefit from hearing aids. And so far when you look at how many of those adults have actually used hearing aids, among those 70 and older, fewer than 30 percent who could benefit from hearing aids actually used them. And among adults 20 to 69, only 16 percent who could benefit from hearing aids have used them. So, the goal here is to make hearing aids more accessible, more affordable for those who could benefit the most.
 
And these over the counter devices will be available at retail stores and pharmacies like Walmart, Walgreens, Best Buy. Those are just some of the stores that we know will have some of these devices available in the coming days. And again, Alex, Hy-Vee is also on the list, as you see there.
 <br>[06:50:00]
 
But this is just exciting news. A game changer for those who can really benefit. 
 
Alex. 
 
MARQUARDT: All right, Jacqueline Howard, thank you so much. Very exciting for those 30 million people who you say could really benefit from this. 
 
HOWARD: Exactly.
 
MARQUARDT: Appreciate it.

KEILAR: The Buffalo Bills exacting a little bit of revenge against the Kansas City Chiefs in a much anticipated rematch from last year's playoffs. 
 
Carolyn Manno has this morning's "Bleacher Report." Well, that was something, Carolyn. 
 
CAROLYN MANNO, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: It was. Good morning. 
 
I mean this one really met the hype. There are so many sports fans who remember exactly what you just said, Brianna, that overtime divisional round breakdown by Buffalo back in January. I'll tell you what, the Bills remembered it too. And it was top of mind heading into this contest. I mean Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen picking up right where they left off on Sunday afternoon. This is down three late in the fourth quarter and Allen going airborne, hurdling over a defender to earn a hard-fought first down. This move is something that he's become known for, by the way. But his arm was on full display as well in the biggest play of the game, a dime to Dawson Knox in the end zone to give Buffalo the lead. 
 
Patrick Mahomes would get the ball back with plenty of time left. Bills fans, the team's secondary, everybody desperate to avoid another crushing loss in this stadium. But now this time. An interception with just 51 seconds remaining sealing the four point win as the Bills improve to 5-1 on the season, make a statement atop the AFC standings. 
 
In playoffs baseball now it is winner take all tonight between the Yankees and the Guardians. Harrison Bader coming up huge for the Bombers on Sunday to avoid elimination. The trade deadline pickup slamming his third home run of the series to give New York the early lead. 
 
Garrett Cole did the rest. He struck out eight over seven innings to get his second win of the series. So, the Yankees win 4-2 to force a decisive fifth game. 
 
The teams are back at Yankee Stadium tonight at 7:00 Eastern on TBS. The National League championship series opening up tomorrow night in San Diego as well. The Padres hosting the Phillies. It was just a phenomenal weekend of sports, Brianna. We've got a great game to look forward to in the Bronx. I know there's going to be 50,000 crazy people screaming for a game five win for the Yankees. And football was just good top to bottom, college, NFL, everything. It was amazing.
 
KEILAR: Always good to see.
 
Carolyn, thank you so much.
 
Of course, we need to get more here, Carolyn, from our senior Buffalo Bills correspondent. 
 
Can we chyron him as such? Tell me we are. Harry Enten here to react to his Bills, his Bills. 
 
What did you think, Harry? 
 
HARRY ENTEN, CNN SENIOR DATA REPORTER: Oh - oh, my God, I was so stressed. I feel like it was the one chance I had of a cardiac event in my young life so far. But when Josh Allen connected with Dawson Knox, I was so  happy. But I really got to give a shout out to that defense. Von Miller, who, of course, signed with the Bills this off season, paid a ton of money, worth every single dime of that money, forcing that pressure on Patrick Mahomes, on the interception, forcing him to come out, throw an ill-advised interception to Taron Johnson. It was beautiful. 
 
This is the Bills team. This is finally our year. The sadness of last year is out the window, but we've got to prove it in the post-season. And this year I feel like that playoff game against the Chiefs, if there is one, is going to go right through upstate western New York. I love it. 
 
MANNO: I was going to grab a coffee and get out of here. Is that OK? We're going to have - we'll have Harry take it over.
 
You're right about Von Miller. 
 
MARQUARDT: Harry - Harry in our -
 
MANNO: I was this close to putting a play in from Von because, mean, he has just been phenomenal. What a statement game for him. Well done, Harry. Well done.
 
ENTEN: It was - it was just exactly what I wanted. What a way to start off the week. I may be tired right now, but I'm also quite excited and my energy is through the roof. 
 
KEILAR: So you - though I feel like as a Bills fan, Harry, I see you, you get your hopes so up, so up, but that's -- 
 
MARQUARDT: And then they - and then they get dashed. 
 
KEILAR: Sometimes they're dashed. It seems like --
 
ENTEN: You know, I would just say, they have been dashed in years past but this team is different. Josh Allen has brought the energy. The team they've surrounded him with, you know, it's not just Allen, it's Stefon Diggs, it's Dawson Knox, it's Gabriel Davis, it's the defense, right? We saw that yesterday. Patrick Mahomes being kept to just 20 points. That is the difference. Defense wins championships. And we saw it on the field yesterday. 
 
But, you know, look, it's just one game. Still a long way to go. We're going to take this victory and enjoy it. We'll enjoy the bye week next week. But the truth of the matter is, this may be the team that finally makes people in western New York truly happy. And me in downstate New York happy as well. 
 
KEILAR: I love Harry's enthusiasm. It makes me a Bills fan as well. 
 
MARQUARDT: But I feel like he's going to have to fight it out with Wolf Blitzer for the title of senior chief Bills correspondent.
 
KEILAR: The more the marrier. Harry - Harry, Carolyn, thank you so much to both of you.
 
And NEW DAY continues right now. MARQUARDT: Russia launching a deadly attack on Kyiv with a wave of kamikaze drones. 
 
Good morning to our viewers here in the United States and all around the world. I'm Alex Marquardt, in today with Brianna Keilar. Thank you so much for having me. 
 
KEILAR: Great to have you in. 
 
MARQUARDT: We begin this morning with explosions across the Ukrainian capital as Russia pummels the capitol of Ukraine with drone attacks, putting civilians and infrastructure at risk.
