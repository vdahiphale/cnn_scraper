AMARA WALKER, CNN ANCHOR: Hello, everyone. Good morning. It is Saturday, September 30th. I'm Amara Walker. 
 
OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN ANCHOR: And I'm Omar Jimenez. You're in the CNN Newsroom. 
 
The government is barreling towards a shutdown with no solution in sight. Today is the last day for Congress to pass a funding bill to keep the government open. You see the count down. Now the clock is ticking. Right now House Republicans are in a closed door meeting to try and come up with a last minute solution. 
 
WALKER: But just last night House Speaker Kevin McCarthy once again failed to pass a stopgap bill in his chamber, and now he is warning that the Senate bill won't pass either, calling their bipartisan bill dead on arrival. But Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell says there is only one path forward. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER: The choice facing Congress is pretty straightforward. We can take the standard approach and fund the government for six weeks at the current rate of operations, or we can shut the government down in exchange for zero meaningful progress on policy. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
Our team is on the ground in D.C. to bring us the latest developments. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is at the White House. She is keeping an eye on how President Biden and his team is preparing for a potential shutdown. But first let's go to CNN congressional correspondent Lauren Fox on the Hill. Lauren, what is the latest right now? What options does McCarthy have? 
 
LAUREN FOX, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, House Republicans are night now meeting behind closed doors as a conference. This is their fourth conference meeting in about a week's time, Amara, and that just gives you a sense of the immediacy, the crisis that senators and Republican Democrats in the House are trying to figure out at the moment. 
 
And one thing that I will walk through is at the moment it is not clear what House Republicans could do to avoid a shutdown. McConnell has made it clear that he thinks the option is to work across the aisle with Democrats to accept whatever the Senate sends over. But last night House Speaker Kevin McCarthy made it clear that the Senate bill was dead on arrival because of Ukraine funding that was included in that legislation. 
 
We also know that behind closed doors this morning leadership gave their members a clear picture that there was not enough Republican support for a short-term C.R. for two weeks, 30 day, 45 days, that there remains a number of hard liners who are never going to be yes on those proposals. So that leaves McCarthy certainly facing the prospect that a shutdown is imminent. Now, again, he could potentially put something on the floor to change that calculus and to get some Democratic support. But doing so, working across the aisle with Democrats could potentially mean the end of his speakership, Amara. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. RALPH NORMAN, (R-SC): But I'm not going to vote for them. For a clean C.R., that's what we were fighting against all the time. Border, nothing in it for the border. So, no, I won't be doing it. I won't be voting for it. We'll see how it goes. 
 
REP. NANCY MACE, (R-SC): We're supposed to have a budget in 12 separate appropriations bills. We don't in this place because they want to screw with the laws and have one massive spending bill that doesn't get vetted, doesn't get amendments put on it, and you don't get time to read it. And I'm not going to participate in what Washington has always done. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOX: And you see there a number of those hardliners pledging they're not going to vote for a short-term Republican solution. That means that in the next several hours it's possible that House Republicans won't have an option to avoid the shutdown. And it if that occurs, it really does build some momentum for the Senate. If they send over a package even though McCarthy has said it's dead on arrival, you can expect that that leverage point that House Republicans might have had in this negotiation really goes out the window. Amara? 
 
JIMENEZ: A lot of calculations on Capitol Hill today. We're going to see what happens. 
 
I want to bring in Priscilla Alvarez at the White House for this conversation. How is the administration preparing? We're a little less than 14 hours left on the clock before a shutdown goes into effect. What are they preparing? PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN REPORTER: There's a lot of contingency planning
 
 that's happening at the White House and across federal agencies. But over the course of the day, the president is going to be briefed on these ongoing negotiations by his staff. 
 <br>[10:05:00]
 
And up until now White House officials have said that it's largely Republicans who are going to be blamed for this if there is a shutdown, and have accused House Speaker Kevin McCarthy of going back on a spending deal that the two, McCarthy and the president, had made earlier this year. But in addition to all of them, the White House has spent the last several days listing the ways that a shutdown would impact Americans, and that includes, for example, the Small Business Administration not being able to provide small business loans as well as disaster recovery projects being put on hold, and millions of children and women potentially going without food assistance, and of course millions of federal workers and active duty troops not getting paid. 
 
Now, again, what federal agencies are doing now is looking at their contingency plans, and over the course of the week they sent notice to the workforce notifying them they may be temporarily furloughed as well as notifying those employees who would be considered essential and therefore having to work without pay. 
 
We should also note that administration officials tell us that the president is expected to hold a cabinet meeting early next week in the event of a government shutdown, again, to talk about continuity of government if this were to happen. So the bottom line here is as all of this unfolds on the hill, the White House and federal agencies are preparing for what a shutdown will mean for the government. Omar, Amara? 
 
JIMENEZ: And a shutdown that could be a reality in less than 24 hours. Lauren Fox, Priscilla Alvarez, thank you so much. 
 
WALKER: So if the government does indeed shut down, the impact will be felt in almost every aspect of our lives. 
 
JIMENEZ: Yes, from travel to disaster funding and childcare, CNN's Brian Todd explains how you could be affected. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This Wisconsin food pantry is bracing for a surge of needy families if the federal government shuts down this weekend.
 
MICHELLE OGILIVE, THE RIVER FOOD PANTRY VOLUNTEER: A lot of people might come through and be like this is my first time here. How does this work?
 
TODD (voice-over): Two reasons for more hardship -- federal workers won't get paychecks, and families who rely on food assistance could lose it.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They don't get those benefits, they might come here every week instead of only once a month.
 
TODD (voice-over): First to feel the pinch, almost all of the country's more than 3.5 million federal workers going without pay.
 
EVERETT KELLEY, AMERICAN FEDERATION OF GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES: They're living from paycheck to paycheck. When they don't get a paycheck it could be devastating. As a matter of fact, it could be disaster.
 
TODD (voice-over): Over a million our active duty military.
 
SABRINA SINGH, DEPUTY PENTAGON PRESS SECRETARY: These service members have rent to pay mortgages, childcare, so those bills are going to mount up. It's an incredibly stressful time.
 
TODD (voice-over): Some workers will still have to work without pay, those deemed essential. For example, soldiers, Border Patrol, and air traffic controllers.
 
PETE BUTTIGIEG, U.S. TRANSPORT SECRETARY: It certainly doesn't help with that safety critical job for them to come to work with the stress of not getting paid.
 
TODD (voice-over): Among the many services at risk, food and water safety inspections, services at National Parks, disaster funding for places like Hawaii and Florida, passport processing. We can expect airport delays with many unpaid TSA screeners likely to be absent, and thousands of preschool kids could be shut out of the Head Start Program.
 
MARISOL GARCIA, ARIZONA EDUCATION ASSOCIATION: We're talking about kids that are living in extreme poverty. Not having this system up and running would really, really impact the kids and the communities that need it the most.
 
TODD (voice-over): Other impacts, immigration court cases put off and no new government aid to help states cope with migrants.
 
KATHY HOCHUL, NEW YORK GOVERNOR: New federal funds will not be available to help states like New York deal with the asylum seekers crisis.
 
TODD (voice-over): Social Security and Medicare payments will continue uninterrupted. But service --
 
KELLEY: A person come and want to apply for a new claim, that won't happen. A person having an issue with their benefits, you know, they have no one to call, no one to talk to.
 
TODD (voice-over): The broader economy would take a hit experts say, because things like permitting for construction projects and loan approvals for farms and small businesses could be paused.
 
CATHERINE RAMPELL, CNN ECONOMICS &amp; POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: A government shutdown is just yet another drag on the economy because it ends up disrupting lots of supply chains and lots of services that people and businesses rely on to keep other parts of the economy running.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
JIMENEZ: Brian Todd, thank you. 
 
Joining me now is CNN political analyst Laura Barron-Lopez. Good to see you on this potential shutdown eve, Laura. We will see. But look, that's my question here. With House members being behind closed doors, how likely is it that lawmakers will pass a bill in time to avoid a shutdown by tonight? 
 
LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: It's looking highly unlikely, Omar, because of the fact that House Republicans don't appear to be able to come to an agreement on any type of short-term spending bill. They continue to disagree about the length of it, about what should be included in it, whether it's Ukraine aid or disaster relief aid. And McCarthy has a choice. He could very well put on the floor a bill that is passed by -- that is likely to be passed by the Senate, a short-term C.R. that includes funding for disaster relief. 
 <br>[10:10:09]
 
But he doesn't want to put that on the floor because he -- his speakership would very likely be threatened, even though that bill from the Senate, it would likely have more than -- more than the votes needed because it would have Democrats voting for it as well as a number of moderate House Republicans. But McCarthy doesn't want to do that. 
 
JIMENEZ: And that's the fight within the fight here. Of course, they're trying to piece together legislation, but also it's politics. There's a faction of the House GOP that has threatened to oust, or at least spark up a vote to oust Speaker Kevin McCarthy if they don't go with their demands. 
 
How does McCarthy balance essentially what is his job versus what is the responsibility of his job to get something that the Senate might be able to pass? 
 
BARRON-LOPEZ: Well, so far to date all of the things that Speaker McCarthy has said and all of the things that Speaker McCarthy has shown that he chooses to side with the hard right Republicans, that he -- even when he became speaker he ended up striking an agreement with them, which was not necessarily made public but which they say he hasn't held to. And every time he has been faced with a choice to either do something that could potentially be more favorable to his moderate Republicans, the very Republicans that made his majority, those 18 House Republicans that are in Biden-won districts and are facing very tough reelections, or doing something that the hard right Republicans really want, he ends up going with what that hard right faction wants.
 
And we're seeing that happen again right now because he could very well put a bill on the floor that would have overwhelming Democratic support, and he would just need a handful or a few dozen Republicans to go over and vote for it to keep the government open, and he's choosing not to do that. 
 
JIMENEZ: And to be clear, there is a growing faction of the Republican party on the House GOP side that is upset with the Matt Gaetz of the world and others who have been pushing a more hardline approach and have threatened McCarthy's speakership. 
 
Now, on the Democratic side, one of the big dividing issues, I guess for both sides, is the funding for Ukraine. Do you think it's realistic that Democrats will be able to pass a stopgap bill without any money going to Ukraine to avoid a shutdown and appease some on the Republican side? 
 
BARRON-LOPEZ: It's looking more and more difficult for the White House, for Democrats, and, mind you, Senate Republican leadership. Mitch McConnell that Ukraine funding attached to a C.R. He wants it something on something that is ultimately passed to keep the government open. But it's looking as though that is becoming increasingly difficult because of the House Republicans that appear to be growing in opposition to any type of aid to Ukraine as well as some consternation among Senate Republican who don't necessarily want that to be attached to any government funding resolution. So opposition appears to be growing to that despite the fact there are a number of Senate Republicans including leadership who wants to see U.S. support for Ukraine continue well into next year, and it's only going to get harder. 
 
JIMENEZ: And of course even if they are able to, on the Democratic side, get past some of those disagreements, we've got disagreements between the Senate and House GOP. The Senate has said any single subject spending bill is dead on arrival in the Senate, and so you sort of end up back in a similar cycle here. 
 
Obviously, this is not happening in a vacuum. We are going to the 2024 election. We are very much in a campaign season for a lot of people that are running for reelection or for new offices in cases. What sort of ramifications do you think this is going to have here? 
 
BARRON-LOPEZ: The government shutdown, Omar? Or --
 
JIMENEZ: Yes, the government shutdown. Sorry. Yes.
 
BARRON-LOPEZ: No, the government shutdown is not beneficial to the lawmakers that are involved. And right now, it appears as though the American public has their eyes on House Republicans because of the fact that -- that House Republicans have decided to not go along with the deal that Kevin McCarthy struck with Joe Biden in May on spending levels. That's something that Senate Republicans are willing to go along with. Kevin McCarthy and House Republicans weren't. And so it's not politically beneficial, a shutdown never is. And right now voters, of course, are very concerned about the economy, and this impacts their ability to have food assistance and other necessary paychecks. 
 
JIMENEZ: Well, we'll see what happens. Laura Barron-Lopez, thank you so much. Amara? [10:15:02]
 
WALKER: All right, this just in to CNN. We are learning new details about a potential House vote that is supposed to take place this afternoon. Let's go now to CNN's Lauren Fox on the Hill. Tell us more about this vote that we're hoping will take place, but it's not to avert a shutdown, is that correct? 
 
FOX: Yes, Amara. Let me take you inside the Republican Conference meeting that is still ongoing at the moment. Basically, the Republican whip walked members through what he believes the reality, that there are not enough Republican votes to pass short term spending bills to keep the government funded, to have this sort of prolonged negotiation with the United States Senate. And so what was presented to members is they are trying to basically soften the blow of a potential shutdown by putting legislation on the floor that would extend FAA authorization, would also deal with some flood insurance issues, and would pay American troops while a shutdown was ongoing. 
 
Now, this is very fluid at the moment. And I just want to be very clear that this is a sign potentially that we are headed into a shutdown, but it also has been changing by the minute, so we want to be very careful and clear that these things are moving quickly, and the House speaker has been sort of all over the map in terms of what he's been eyeing. And so obviously, if there's a vote today on these measures, it is an opportunity for Republicans to try to put Democrats in a hard spot, force them to have to decide if they think America's troops should be paid during a shutdown. But none of the bills they are talking about or entertaining would prevent a government shutdown at this point. And as we've noted, we are now just hours from that reality. Amara? 
 
WALKER: All right, we'll be watching this with you as this vote is set to take place this afternoon. Lauren Fox, thank you so much for that update. 
 
JIMENEZ: Much more still ahead as this shutdown could just be hours away. And it's still unclear for now how a shutdown could be averted. One thing that is clear, though, if no deal is reached, the impact will be felt far and wide. Up next, we'll discuss the effects it could have on food safety. 
 
WALKER: Plus, a state of emergency in New York City. Look at that, rain flooding the city, wreaking havoc on the subway system. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:21:26] 
 
WALKER: All right, welcome back. We are less than 14 hours away from the U.S. government's first shutdown since 2019. And as you mentioned earlier, if that deadline comes and goes, the effects will be significant. The looming shutdown could also put Americans food at risk as inspectors would be off the job. Food safety executive Frank Yiannas is here to give us some perspective. Frank, appreciate you joining us this morning. You also used to be the deputy commissioner of food policy and response with the FDA. Tell us what kind of impacts you're expecting especially when you have the White House warning that the FDA could be forced to delay food inspections -- food safety inspections. To what extent would we see that? 
 
FRANK YIANNAS, FOOD SAFETY EXECUTIVE: There aren't too many topics in my mind that are more important than the government's ability to ensure its citizens have access to safe and available food. And I can speak on this issue with authority. I was a deputy commissioner during the last shutdown, which was pretty lengthy in time. And what happens in those instances, the FDA, which regulates about 80 percent of our U.S. food system, has to furlough employees. And we're only allowed to do work on what's considered imminent human health hazard, or something that will affect human life. So, in the last shutdown we were basically limited to only responding to problems once they occurred, and responding to what's referred to as class one recalls, recalls of foods that are of an urgent health issue to a consumer. So all the work that the FDA is expected to do, that Congress expect it to do, that the American people expect it to do in terms of prevention, preventing outbreak from happening in the first place, comes to a stall. 
 
WALKER: Wow. OK, so that's concerning. So you can only respond. You cannot be proactive as you experienced in the last shutdown when it comes to protecting Americans from foodborne illnesses. What is typically done to ensure that our raw meats and things of that nature are free of these foodborne illnesses? 
 
YIANNAS: Sure. Again, FDA, the agency that I work for, regulates the majority of the food system except for meat and poultry. But for the food that the FDA regulates, high risk food products, whether they're seafood, whether they're fresh produce items, infant formula is another good example, if the agency has an inability to do what they call routine surveillance inspections, they can't go into these facilities and wee what are the operating condition and whether there any health concerns that might allow them to take action or instruct a company to take action to prevent an outbreak or crisis from happening in the first place. And so those types of routine surrounding, what I call proactive inspections, are prohibited when there's a shutdown because there's not preparations to fund that type of work. 
 
WALKER: So then how worried should we be about the safety of our food if indeed we go into a shutdown mode? 
 
YIANNAS: I think all Americans want fiscal responsibility, but I can tell you with certainty they expect our government to work together to figure out a way to continue to do this type of work. The industry has the primary responsibility to produce safe food. But industry wants regulators on the job. They want them to provide that level of oversight insurance. Oftentimes industry has to consult with regulators whether they're developing new products or they have questions about processes. 
 
[10:25:3]
 
And so we should be concerned that an important layer of protection for the nation is completely missing. We often refer to this, Amara, as a battle against foodborne disease. And in a government shutdown, what we're basically doing is tying both hands of the FDA's hands behind its back, asking them to try to win this battle. 
 
WALKER: What's commonsense advice to Americans, then, who are hearing this, they're stunned that this layer of safety for our food may not be there or may be delayed if the government shuts down. What can we do then when we go to grocery stores? Should we avoid certain products, salads, things of that nature? Or if we do buy them, should we be washing them more thoroughly? What's the advice here? 
 
YIANNAS: Yes, I think the advice is same advice that we generally give to consumers. If anything, just redouble your efforts. Try to buy products or goods from approved suppliers or reputable vendors that you've done business with before, continue to follow your good home handling procedures, whether it's keeping cold foods cold, hot foods hot, making sure that you cook them thoroughly. And then if you're so inclined, reach out to your congressional representatives and tell them you expect them to keep FDA on the job. 
 
WALKER: Frank Yiannas, appreciate your expertise, thank you so much. 
 
JIMENEZ: Another aspect that could be affected, cybersecurity officials are on high alert as the government heads towards a potential shutdown. CNN's Sean Lyngaas explains how the government is already preparing to make sure protections are in place even if most of their workforce stays home. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)
 
SEAN LYNGAAS, CNN CYBERSECURITY REPORTER: U.S. officials are wary of the potential impact that a government shutdown could have on their ability to defend against cyberattacks from criminals and state actors alike. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, one of the main agencies for cyber defense, is set to furlough up to 80 percent of its employees. 
 
Now, that could have an impact on the agency's ability to test the networks of hospitals and schools and other critical infrastructure they help to defend. U.S. officials tell me they have contingency plans in place in which they're using the skeleton staff that they have to help try to defend networks. However, they are very concerned about the long-term and medium term effect this could have on their ability to recruit new talent to their agencies in a field that is sorely lacking in qualified personnel. 
 
I'm Sean Lyngaas in Washington.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
JIMENEZ: Sean Lyngaas, thank you so much. 
 
Coming up for us, flash floods and subway chaos. We'll show you how record-breaking rainfall drenched New York City. And you're looking at live pictures from Capitol Hill where House members in just a few moments you see right there -- House members are meeting just 13 hours or so before the government officially shuts down. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:32:07]
 
JIMENEZ: New York's governor says the MTA is operating with full weekend service following historic flooding across New York City, Long Island, and the Hudson Valley. Record breaking rainfall drenched the area yesterday, causing widespread flooding, road closures, and disruptions to public transportation. 
 
WALKER: In response, Governor Kathy Hochul and Mayor Eric Adams declared a state of emergency. CNN's Polo Sandoval is live in New York. Hey, Polo, how are people handling this deluge, and what's it's looking like out there? 
 
POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: And by the way, Amara, that state of emergency that you mentioned, that is still in place at least for another six days according to New York's governor, which basically allows him more flexibility in the aftermath of yesterday's storm. And Omar, you and I take the system often, and you know what can happen if some of these lines, service on some of these lines is suspended. So it really is remarkable how less than 24 hours later, weekend service, as you mentioned, is back 100 percent. So that is certainly a sign of progress after yesterday's storm here. 
 
We also heard from New York City officials and state officials a little while ago that said that fortunately no injuries or worse to report, and that they did have a couple of -- at least two dozen rescues that took place. So there really is a moment of relief and to some extent even pride in the way that the city responded, but also some serious questions what can be done to prevent this from happening in the future. Governor Hochul recognizing that something similar took place just two years ago with Ida, and as a result people lost their lives. And so what we heard today was officials to basically call on increased funding to better improve infrastructure. But for now, that rain is still falling occasionally but far from what we saw yesterday as the situation continues to improve in New York after yesterday's historic rain. Amara, Omar?
 
WALKER: All about that positive trajectory. Keep getting better, please. Polo Sandoval, thank you very much. So the weather is expected to clear as the storm system moves further east. 
 
JIMENEZ: CNN's meteorologist Allison Chinchar joins us with the latest. OK, so what are we looking at? 
 
ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Unfortunately, we are still looking at more rain. The good news is it's nowhere near as heavy as yesterday. So we're not expecting another five, six, or even seven inches on top of what we had. But we do have some moderate rain bands sliding in from time to time across numerous states here in the northeast. You've got some heavier bands starting to push in across Nantucket, also some moderate rain bands across JFK in the last 30 to 40 minutes or so. But for the most part all of this rain is very light. Total accumulation for the rest of the day today likely between a
 
 half-an-inch, up to one inch at max, and that may not sound like much, but when it's on top of four, five, even inches of rain, it can still do some damage. You've got several flood warnings still in effect. Most of these still last for several more hours. It's not necessarily for the additional rain we're expecting today but rather all that rain yesterday, because it takes time for that water to recede, especially when you're talking such high amounts. 
 
[10:35:5]
 
JFK airport set an all-time rainfall record yesterday, getting over eight inches, Valley Stream, New York picking up over nine inches of rain. And several other spots, not just New York but also Connecticut and New Jersey picking up six, even seven inches of rain total. So again, a significant amount of rain. We are still getting more today but nowhere near those totals. 
 
Here you can see a few more bands expected through the first half of the day, but really as we transition into the afternoon, a lot of those rain bands really start to recede very quickly. And then finally tomorrow, Sunday, sunshine from start to finish. It will be a nice day to allow things to dry back out. 
 
However, as that system is exiting, you're still getting spin from that storm, and that's going to push a lot of that water in. So you do still have potential for some coastal flooding, not just New York but also New Jersey and even Delaware. So you've got that coastal inundation up to one point possible today. 
 
JIMENEZ: Allison Chinchar, thank you so much. 
 
Coming up, an arrest 27 years in the making. We'll explain how police finally made an arrest in connection to the shooting death of hip hop icon Tupac Shakur. That's next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:40:18]
 
JIMENEZ: Let's take a look at some headlines we are following this morning. United Auto Workers are expanding their strike again against two of the big three at the Ford assembly plant in Chicago and GM's plant in Lansing, Michigan, but not against Stellantis, which the union says some progress is being made at the bargaining table. Total walk offs now stand at 25,000. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SHAWN FAIN, UNITED AUTO WORKERS PRESIDENT: The sad reality in all this is they could double our wages right now and double our benefits, and they would still -- and not raise the price of vehicles, and they would still make billions in profit. That's the big lie that's going on right now. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) JIMENEZ: Fain also fired back at Ford executives, saying their comments about significant progress in talks was overly optimistic. 
 
WALKER: A grand jury has indicted a 60-year-old man in the 1996 murder of rapper Tupac Shakur. Police say Duane Keith Davis admitted his role in the murder back in 2009 but couldn't be charged because of an earlier agreement that prohibited any statements from being used against him. Officials describe Davis as the ringmaster of the plot to kill Tupac, but it was his public bragging about the incident that provided evidence leading to his arrest on Friday. Police say he's the only living suspect linked to Tupac's murder. Three other suspects are deceased. 
 
JIMENEZ: Now over in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, a deputy police chief and three other officers are facing criminal charges after allegedly hitting and tasing a suspect during an arrest in 2020, then covering it up. That's according to the police chief. 
 
WALKER: These charges coincide with other investigations into the so- called "Brave Cave" where officers of a now disbanded street crime unit have been accused of misconduct, and a lawsuit is pending. CNN's Ryan Young takes a closer look at these cases. 
 
RYAN YOUNG, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Amara and Omar, there's a lot of fallout from the Brave Cave, and all the conversations that's being had in Baton Rouge about the investigations that are ongoing. There's an FBI investigation, and there's also at least three current investigations outside of that. 
 
But the police chief told us something on different on Friday. There's nine administrative investigations in total, and four officers have been arrested. That's actually connected to another case. In September of 2020, a man was arrested and brought to a police department building, and when officers wanted to conduct a strip-search because they believed he had some drugs, the man was struggling. Those officers brought out their tasers, they started to tase the man several times. But they didn't realize it activated their body cameras. 
 
Later on, a supervisor became aware of how this went down. They watched what happened through an app and tried to have the body camera destroyed according to the chief. That way the video wouldn't be logged into a server. Now those four officers face charges for this. This goes deep into this community. The Baton Rouge mayor is speaking out. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MAYOR SHARON WESTON BROOME, BATON ROUGE LOUISIANA: To put it in terms that you can relate to, this is not a time for just annual checkup. This is time for a full body MRI to diagnose and reveal any dysfunctions or wrongdoings. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
YOUNG: Yet Omar and Amara, in another incident a man claims he was beaten by officers, grandmother says she was forced into a body cavity search at the Brave Cave. This is now all in an area where people are concerned with what's going on with this police department. The police department for its part says, look, homicides have gone down over the last two years. The chief already said that he's stepping down. But this investigation continues as people look into what exactly happened with these officers over the last few years. 
 
WALKER: All right, Ryan Young, thank you for that. 
 
And a final salute to a pillar of America's military. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff got all praises as he turned over his command. 
 
JIMENEZ: Yes, Milley advised two presidents, Donald Trump and Joe Biden, through tests both foreign and domestic -- COVID, the murder of George Floyd, January 6th, the Afghanistan withdrawal, Russia's war in Ukraine, just to name a few. Milley delivered a passionate speech in which he seemingly criticized former President Donald Trump, asserting the U.S. military does not pledge allegiance to someone aspiring to be a dictator.

GEN. MARK MILLEY, CHAIRMAN, JOINT CHIEFS: We don't take an oath to a country. We don't take an oath to a tribe. We don't take an oath to a religion. We don't take an oath to a king or a queen or a tyrant or a dictator. And we don't take an oath to a wannabe dictator. We don't take an oath to an individual. We take an oath to the Constitution.

WALKER: Milley also used the ceremony meant to honor him to honor his brothers and sisters in arms and their sacrifice. 
 
JIMENEZ: Now, look, we've been following any potential developments around a potential government shutdown, and we are getting new details about lawmakers efforts to try to get a deal passed before the government shuts down at midnight. We're learning House Republicans are planning to vote on bills this afternoon that would minimize the impact of a government shutdown instead of trying to avoid one. 
 
Now, of course these things could change, but we are following these developments minute by minute as they come. Republicans are considering votes to pay troops, Border Patrol agents, FAA employees, and fund the national flood insurance program. 
 
WALKER: There also has been some talk about passing a so-called clean C.R., a clean continuing resolution, which would basically simply extend government funding, but of course not include any of those provisions that they've been talking about, including funding for Ukraine and border security, which the House Republicans have been adamant about. But all of this has an uncertain future. 
 
We want to let you listen now to Tennessee Congressman Tim Burchett moments ago what he said about a clean C.R. possibility.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If the leader puts a clean C.R. on the floor, do you think there should be consequences for leader? 
 
REP. TIM BURCHETT, (R-TN): I just depends on -- I might see the details of that. When you say clean C.R., I don't know what they've added or taken away. But no more money for Ukraine. And it's just a shame that our State Department is going to funnel money to the Ukraine, and then our folks are going to do without. I mean, that shows the priorities. I mean, that's the reality of this whole thing is just a show to hurt people to keep the majority, or the minority, or whatever.

WALKER: OK, so it looks like Republicans still putting the foot down there in the House. We, of course, have a team of reporters on Capitol Hill and the White House. We will bring you updates as we get them in. But for now, potentially there may be a vote in the House this afternoon to soften the blow if there is, indeed, a government shutdown. So it looks like signs of a compromise or signs of a last minute deal doesn't look so bright at this time. 
 
Still ahead, a government shutdown won't stop the celebration for President Jimmy Carter's 99th birthday. We're going to talk about the changes being made to make sure his party goes on.

JIMENEZ: As the football season moves along, injuries can start to pile up. A group of former Duke football players are moving from the locker room to the lab to help improve player safety.

I always loved football. I was an walk-on at Duke, and by the time I was a senior I was doing more engineering than I was playing. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I was definitely doing more classwork than football. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: As we continued our engineering curriculum, we discovered more and more things that could advance the sports medicine industry and the rehab process. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're talking about 3-D printing and what it would look like to 3-D model braces and casts. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My name is Kevin Gehsmann, the cofounder and CEO of PROTECT3D. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My name is Tim Skapek. I'm one of the cofounders of PROTECT3D. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They were able to make a pad for one of our players who fractured his clavicle. I was blown away. They're anatomically correct. So to each player they fit them perfectly. They have full range of motion. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The athletic trainer on staff uses an iPhone app to take a 3-D scan of the anatomy that's injured or they're trying to protect. That 3-D scan gets uploaded to us. We use a variety of medical grade 3-D printing materials to fabricate these devices. It ultimately gets set to the 3-D printer. We work with many college and professional teams at the college level. It could be used for any sport. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I play with more confidence. I play with less doubt. You barely notice the pads out there from how well it fits. It's one less thing woo worry about. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're getting a reduction of injuries because they're wearing preventive pads. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ten years from now I think PROTECT3D is going to be bringing best in class medical devices to every person around the globe who could benefit from them.

JIMENEZ: Former President Jimmy Carter's 99th birthday tomorrow, October 1st, will now be celebrated today as we face a potential government shutdown. The Carter Center said festivities were set for Sunday, but that midnight shutdown could affect their library as well. 
 
WALKER: Carter, a lifelong Democrat, served as president from 1977 to 1981. Let's bring in CNN's Isabel Rosales who is live at the Carter Center in Atlanta. Isabel, tell us more about the plans for today and how the government shutdown is impacting celebrations that were set for tomorrow, right? 
 
ISABEL ROSALES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Amara, Omar, good morning to you. Yes, unless there is a sudden breakthrough in negotiations, government funding is set to expire tonight at midnight just before Jimmy Carter's 99th birthday. So the Jimmy Carter Presidential Museum and Library moved up celebrations to make sure that folks have a chance to honor America's oldest living president. 
 
The Carter Center, in fact, they're asking folks from all over the world to send in tributes, memories, and pictures. And boy, they've received thousands of them in this digital mosaic forming Jimmy Carter right here. And it's not just regular folks either. It's also celebrities and public figures on social media. 
 <br>[10:55:02]
 
The Carter Center retweeting several of them including from Willie Nelson, Jane Fonda, and the Indigo Girls, all of them giving a very happy birthday to Jimmy Carter. Now, if the shutdown does happen, which we're expecting, some of the
 
 nation's most beloved museums, national parks and museums, and presidential libraries, they would be closed. That includes the Carter Presidential Library, which would be closed. Also, all Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo. But in a press release obtained by CNN, they would remain open at least through Saturday. Back to you.
 
WALKER: All right, Isabel Rosales, thank you very much. And thank you for being with us on this very busy morning. 
 
JIMENEZ: Stay with CNN throughout the day for the latest developments as we get closer to a potential government shutdown. The next hour of CNN Newsroom is up next.
