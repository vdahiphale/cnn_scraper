JIM ACOSTA, CNN ANCHOR:  Passing the torch and running with momentum. It's day one of the Democratic National Convention here in Chicago. This is where it'll all happen, United Center, home of the city's beloved Bulls and Blackhawks. There it is right there, a majestic Chicago skyline on this beautiful Monday morning.
 
And just hours from now, Democratic delegates and political heavyweights will fill this room that you're looking at right now. The goal, energize and unify the party around Vice President Kamala Harris with 78 days, just 78 days until Election Day.
 
Today's theme is for the people. The party will highlight the stark differences between where Democrats want to take the country versus former President Donald Trump.
 
President Biden will deliver the keynote address tonight. He will talk about his 50 years of public service and argue the Harris-Walz ticket is the natural successor to carry his legacy forward. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, Jill Biden, the First Lady, Hillary Clinton, former first lady, and Senator, Secretary of State, she will also take the stage tonight.
 
Democrats are hoping to turn vibes into votes. For the first time, two major national polls show Harris beating Trump in a head to head matchup, but she says there is still a lot of work to do.

REPORTER:  CBS News has a new poll, shows that you're three points up nationally. What's your response to this? Do you still consider yourself the underdog here?
 
KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I very much consider us the underdog. We have a lot of work to do to earn the vote of the American people. That's why we're on this bus tour today and we're going to be traveling this country, as we've been, and talking with folks, listening to folks, and hopefully earning their votes over the next 79 days.

ACOSTA:  Good morning, everybody, and welcome to a very special edition of CNN Newsroom. I'm Jim Acosta in Chicago at the Democratic National Convention. This morning, we will have full coverage of the DNC, the Democrats' message, and the protesters, of course, that we've seen hoping to disrupt the party unity here in Chicago.
 
In moments from now, California Congressman Eric Swalwell will join me, also Jesse Jackson's son, Representative Jonathan Jackson, will be here live in Chicago. We'll talk about his father's legacy and how important he is to this great city. I'll also speak with Congressman Brendan Boyle from the key battleground state of Pennsylvania, that's coming up. And a little later on from Wonder Woman to Harris supporter, Actress Lynda Carter, yes, Wonder Woman herself will join me live.
 
But we begin this hour with Democratic Congressman Eric Swalwell of California. Congressman, thank you very much for joining us. I understand you're on your way to Chicago. I hope you eventually make it here. Yes, that's right.
 
You know, tonight, as you know, the president will take the stage a lot earlier than he anticipated a few short weeks ago. You've said he belongs on Democratic Mount Rushmore. What does this historic passing of the torch mean for the country, the Democratic Party and for Joe Biden's legacy tonight?
 
REP. ERIC SWALWELL (D-CA):  Well, it's deep gratitude that we're all going to show because under Joe Biden's leadership, our children will feed their families with jobs he created. They'll drive on roads that he built. They'll power their devices with chips that he manufactured. And also it's not just the jobs that he created. It's also the job that he left for Kamala Harris, a job that she's going to finish as she takes on inflation with an economy that's going to work for working people.
 
And, by the way, tonight, it's so fitting that night one, the theme is for the people. I was an Alameda County prosecutor. That's where I got my start in my legal career. It's the same place that Kamala Harris got her start. And every time you appeared in court, the first thing you did is you would say your name appearing for the people. And that was a representation to the court and the judge that you're there for justice. She's going to be there tonight and through the week for economic justice for, you know, justice for all families in America.
 <br>[10:05:07]
 
And so it's just so fitting that's the theme that we're kicking off tonight.
 
ACOSTA:  And, Congressman, you've made some waves in the last several days. You're part of this future forum caucus. You've teamed up with Hollywood producers to craft meme friendly political ads on TikTok and Instagram, obviously very important to this campaign and election. Let's look at your latest.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I love you. Have a great day at school.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Dictator on day one. There will have to be some form of punishment for women. Roe versus Wade was terminated. Fire, fury, bloodbath, now get in.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You know what, honey? I'm going to drive you today. Besides, can convicted felons even drive school buses?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  If you wouldn't trust him with your kid, why would you trust him with your country?
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ACOSTA:  All right, a lot of eyeballs on that ad, Congressman. How important is social media outreach to young voters on places like TikTok and Instagram? How much is that fueling the Harris campaign right now?
 
SWALWELL:  We have to be everywhere and the Harris campaign is everywhere. It's back to school month in America right now. And so like every parent, you know, you're thinking about your kids and their future. And I thought this ad showed that if we're not going to let our kids on a bus with that very unstable genius driving it, we probably shouldn't let him have the nuclear codes.
 
And so it's really about our message not winning a Harvard Law School moot court competition but just winning a gut check at every bus stop in America, and it's working.
 
ACOSTA:  And I want to ask you about something that Donald Trump said about the vice president this weekend. Let's take a listen to that.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: They said, no, her biggest advantage is that she's a beautiful woman. I'm going, I never thought of that. I'm better looking than she is.
 
I say that I am much better looking than her. I think I'm much better, much better. I'm a better looking person than Kamala.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ACOSTA:  Now, Trump is also trying to paint Kamala Harris as a communist, posting this fake A.I.-generated image on his social media account. We can show that to our viewers as well. Congressman, I mean, obviously you have a potent social media, you know, arsenal at your disposal, but so does Donald Trump. How much of this is going to just be going toe to toe? I guess the old days of when we go low -- or when they go low, we go high. I guess those are out the window. Is that it?
 
SWALWELL:  Yes. And what an unfocused weirdo he looks like there. You know, I may have a potent social media account. Kamala Harris certainly has a more potent social media account. I'll tell you who has probably one of the most potent networks, Swifties. And this genius over the weekend decided to poke the eyes of Swifties and suggested that Taylor Swift is endorsing him. And I can just make a prediction right now. They are going to have a marvelous time ruining everything for Donald Trump over the next 78 days.
 
ACOSTA:  All right. Congressman Eric Swalwell, we will see you here in Chicago very soon. Thanks very much for your time this morning. I appreciate it.
 
All right, coming up, it's the issue dividing Democrats and it's on full display here in Chicago, a handful of undecided delegates holding out their vote due to Israel's war in Gaza. CNN's Donie O'Sullivan joins me live. And what do they need to hear from Kamala Harris, Donnie?
 
DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Jim. Yes, the war in Gaza really front and center here in Chicago this week. We're expecting tens of thousands of demonstrators outside the arena and inside here on the convention floor as some uncommitted delegates who we spoke to and we'll be meeting right after the break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:10:00]
 
ACOSTA:  All right. Welcome back to a special edition of CNN Newsroom live from Chicago and the DNC as Democrats prepare to nominate the first woman of color to lead a presidential ticket. The party plans to honor Reverend Jesse Jackson's trailblazing legacy here in Chicago and across the country that could help lead Kamala Harris back to the White House as president.
 
Tonight, Jackson will be honored on stage here in the United Center marking 40 years since his first presidential campaign, a historic one, back in 1984, alongside him will be his son and fellow delegate. Democratic Congressman Jonathan Jackson, he joins me here live. Congressman, thank you so much for being here.
 
And we were just talking about this during the break. Your father gave this historic speech, just lifted the roof off of the building in Atlanta at the DNC, giving his rousing keep hope alive message in Atlanta all those years ago. Let's listen to part of that. Talk about it on the other side.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REV. JESSE JACKSON, FORMER DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Suffering breeds character. Character breeds faith. In the end, faith will not disappoint. You must not surrender. You may or may not get there, but just know that you are qualified when you hold on and hold out. You must never surrender. America will get better and better. Keep hope alive. Keep hope alive.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) ACOSTA:  Just a powerful moment. Congressman, what's that going to be like tonight when your father takes the stage here? It's going to be such a big moment. And I have to think that that message, keep hope alive, is resonating with the party even today.
 
REP. JONATHAN JACKSON (D-IL):  Well, I would say that my father's run, it was foundational, that the rules changed as a consequence of his run, that there was proportionality for the delegates.
 <br>[10:15:00]
 
It used to be winner-take-all under that foundation and that change of rules. President Barack Obama had his votes counted. We had the opportunity to see Ron Brown to take over the leadership of the DNC. Mrs. Minyon Moore, who is now the chair of the DNC convention, came out of our organization, and Donna Brazile went on to chair Al Gore's convention. So, so many fruits came out of that campaign. So, I'm so glad that he can see the fruits of his living legacy, of having opened the doors for participation.
 
I think what comes out tonight is Mrs. Harris has a glow. She's winning. She's effervescent. She has a spirit. Mr. Trump has a cloud over him. He seems more bitter. He's more castigated. He's more angry. And he's lashing out. He probably needs a level of intervention. Now, the other day, he has the nerve to say that he is more attractive, he's more beautiful.
 
ACOSTA:  Yes, what'd you think of that?
 
JONATHAN JACKSON:  Well, I thought it was bizarre. I mean, you talk about weird, but he's also bizarre, and he's also lost his mind. I mean, even a dog wouldn't agree with that. I mean, have you ever seen the guy smile? When does he laugh? He's angry all the time, and he's more and more bitter. So, he's going to lash out, he's going to say more caustic things, and he has that as a reputation and a character. And let us not forget, this is a convicted man that's been guilty of assaulting a woman.
 
And so I hope that somebody talks to him and the people that are backing him reign to men because he's setting an example for future generations. Our children are watching this and they have to know this behavior has to stop.
 
ACOSTA:  And how should the Harris campaign respond to all of this? Do you like the approach that she's taking? She's sort of been trying to, I think, stay above it, stay above the fray, stay above the personal attacks. Is that the right approach?
 
JONATHAN JACKSON:  Absolutely, she should. And her smile, it draws people's in. Her spirit is absolutely magnificent. She's done a loyal job of number two, which is the job of vice president to support your president. She's broken the Senate tire over 31 times. She's been a part of passing this legislative, this historic legislation to fully fund EPA. The first district of Illinois has some of the highest amount of lead service lines in any district in the nation. That money is now fully funded for that. I'm very grateful what President Biden said he was going to do. He's done it. He said he would nominate and put an African-American female on the Supreme Court. He's done that. And now he's also put an African-American female on the ticket as vice president. She served him and now he's serving her as supporting her to be the president. So he's an honorable man and history will be his best friend.
 
ACOSTA:  And, Congressman, I do want to ask you because last night we saw some of the protests get started against the war in Gaza. There's been a lot of discussion about whether or not that's going to be a major disruption for this Democratic Convention. How is the city handling it? And do you think it could potentially be a big distraction for the Democrats this week?
 
JONATHAN JACKSON:  I don't think it'll be a big distraction. I think Mayor Brandon Johnson comes out of the activist community. He is meeting with them regularly, so there's a dialogue. There's not an isolation. There's been a route that's been proposed. Of course, it's going to grow. And I like to hear the young people having dissent that shows that our democracy is alive and well. We all don't have to do the same thing. We can all sing together get on the same page.
 
And the question is we are now being able to nominate a prosecutor, a person that's upheld the law. The Republicans have to deal with a criminal, a person that's broken the law. I think there's going to be a stark divergent. For those that are protesting, I encourage them, raise your voice. It's a right that we have. And I've been all along seeking reconciliation so we can bring an end to this war and their right to raise their voices.
 
And so let us keep that. But unlike our group, we're not going to storm the Capitol. That's what Donald Trump has done. They had Officer Sicknick killed, and they won't even mention Officer Sicknick at their Democratic Convention. I know it was an unfortunate attempt on his life, and they had a ceremony regarding that, but they also talk about Officer Sicknick.
 
We cannot act like January 6th did not occur when the president of the United States could not come out onto the mall and address all of the American people. That was a dark day in American history.
 
ACOSTA:  Well, Congressman, we're going to be watching you, your father and this convention unfold tonight.
 
It's going to be just a powerful moment, I think, when we see Reverend Jackson out there, a lot of affection for your father all around this country. Thank you, Congressman, very much for your time.
 
JONATHAN JACKSON:  Welcome back to Chicago.
 
ACOSTA:  I appreciate it. Thank you. Great being back. I was a local reporter. I won't say how many years ago, but it's always great to be back here in Chicago. Thanks so much.
 
JONATHAN JACKSON:  See you, man.
 
ACOSTA:  Thank you.
 
All right, coming up with Democrats here divided over the war in Gaza, Secretary of State Tony Blinken meets with. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and the clock is ticking on reaching a ceasefire deal. CNN's Jim Sciutto is live for us in Tel Aviv, coming up.
 
JIM SCIUTTO, CNN ANCHOR AND CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST:  Israelis describing that meeting with Blinken as constructive, but there are fears here following an attempted suicide attack in Tel Aviv last night.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:20:00]
 
ACOSTA:  Welcome back to this special edition of CNN Newsroom from the Democratic National Convention here in Chicago. As delegates gather, one of the hottest issues is the ever growing crisis in the Middle East. Just a short time ago, Secretary of State Tony Blinken wrapped up a critical meeting with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. A source calling the meeting constructive, Blinken warning, this moment may be the last best chance to reach a deal for a ceasefire in Gaza and get the hostages home.
 
CNN Chief National Security Analyst Jim Sciutto is live for us in Tel Aviv. Jim, you know, we've been through this, you know, before thinking that perhaps these talks might lead somewhere and both sides have been accusing the other of undermining the talks.
 <br>[10:25:07]
 
What can you tell us?
 
SCIUTTO:   You know, I think Secretary Blinken, his comments were revealing to say that this is the last best chance. He's out here for the ninth time, right? And he's been trying to get a deal across the finish line, really not just for days, but weeks and months. And you did hear from Israeli officials a short time ago that the meeting between Blinken and Netanyahu was constructive. Yes, but that's the U.S. and Israel, right? When you get to Hamas and Israel, the language, the rhetoric is quite different.
 
And last night, just as Blinken was arriving in this country, Hamas released a statement accusing Israel of introducing new conditions, putting up new obstacles to an agreement. And then in the midst of that, you had an attempted suicide bombing here in Tel Aviv, not far from where we're standing right here, right now, and then Hamas' military wing claimed responsibility for that.
 
Only the bomber was killed. It could have been much worse. But this region, though fears of an immediate expansion of the war have dissipated somewhat, it's a tinderbox. And all it takes is a spark, right? And an attempted suicide bombing could be such a spark. There was an Israeli soldier killed on the northern border today. That could be a spark. That's the situation here. Those diplomatic efforts continue, though. Blinken's going to travel from here to Cairo to meet with other parties involved. And then you have a bigger group getting together on Thursday. But, Jim, it would take some progress, frankly, from both sides, right, to get this across the finish line. If we don't see that today, it doesn't mean the hope has disappeared. But the rest of the region is waiting, and I would say in quite a nervous state, Jim.
 
ACOSTA:  Yes. And from a domestic political standpoint, I'm sure the president and vice president would love to see some kind of agreement, at least the framework of an agreement emerged during this Democratic convention here in Chicago.
 
Jim Sciutto, we'll, of course, get back to you. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it.
 
Some of the thousands of delegates say they are remaining uncommitted as a protest over U.S. support for Israel.
 
CNN's Donie O'Sullivan is here with me. Donie, you've been speaking to some of these delegates. I was talking to Congressman Jackson about this earlier on in this program, whether or not it's going to, you know, present a major disruption for the Democrats here in Chicago. What are you hearing?
 
O'SULLIVAN:  Hey, Jim. Yes, I mean there's going to be probably tens of thousands of protesters expected outside the arena. But when it comes to here on the convention floor, I mean, obviously the Democrats want to tell a story of remarkable unity and the party getting behind Harris.
 
But for pro-Palestinian activists and demonstrators, they also want to bring that point up here on the convention floor and they want answers from Harris on Gaza. And we spoke to some of them yesterday.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ABBAS ALAWIEH, MICHIGAN UNCOMMITED DELEGATE:  We've got 30 uncommitted delegates that are representing over 740,000 uncommitted voters nationwide who voted uncommitted as a pro-peace, anti-war vote in the Democratic primary.
 
O'SULLIVAN:  This is a meeting of uncommitted Democratic delegates here in Chicago on the eve of the Democratic National Convention.
 
ALAWIEH:  But it's not sustainable for our own government to fund the mass killing of civilians.
 
JEREMIAH ELLISON, MINNESOTA UNCOMMITTED DELEGATE:  Folks become delegates at their state party, and then they come to the national convention and they're either committed to the candidate to one of the candidates or not. In our case, we're not committed because we haven't heard what we've wanted to hear, looking for a ceasefire. We're looking for a strong commitment on a ceasefire. We're looking for an arms embargo for us to stop sending weapons that are contributing to the genocide there. ALAWIEH:  I represent some of the over 101,000 voters in Michigan who voted uncommitted as a pro-peace, anti-war vote.
 
LEXIS ZELDAN, CO-CHAIR, UNCOMMITTED NATIONAL MOVEMENT:  Nobody wants to see Trump in November. We are a very anti-fascist movement. We are actually doing what we can to save the Democratic Party by saying, listen, V.P. Harris, there is a key base of over 730, 000 anti-war voters who are telling you that we want to see you turn the page on Gaza policy and save Palestinian lives.
 
O'SULLIVAN:  What do you want to hear from Harris in Chicago this week?
 
ALAWIEH:  I want to hear from Vice President Harris how it is that she's going to turn a new page on Gaza policy next week from the destructive and disastrous policy of the last ten months to one that saves lives.
 
O'SULLIVAN:  You got to meet Harris briefly in Michigan.
 
LAYLA ELABED, CO-CHAIR, UNCOMMITTED NATIONAL MOVEMENT:  We wanted to be able to speak to her directly. And the fact that Michigan voters would want to support her in the November election, but we can't do that right now while our family members, our friends, our loved ones, are being killed with U.S.-funded bombs.
 
I told her that we need a policy shift. that will save lives in Gaza. My community is telling me that they're losing tens and hundreds of their family members. And she said, it's horrific.
 
She's been incredibly empathetic. I do have to say that. We have seen more empathy and compassion from Vice President Harris, but that is not enough. Palestinian children can't eat words.
 
O'SULLIVAN:  Is there more hope in this movement right now with Harris at the top of the ticket than there was when Biden was there?
 <br>[10:30:02]
 
YAZAN KADER, WASHINGTON UNCOMMITTED DELEGATE:  I think that, in general, we would all say we're cautiously optimistic. There is a little bit more wiggle room, we feel like.</pre>
