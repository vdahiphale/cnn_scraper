BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN HOST: What are we anticipating? He's going to say in this speech? 
 
KAYLA TAUSCHE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, we expect a very familiar message from President Biden in Philadelphia talking about Bidenomics. Because even though there are wars raging overseas, their political battle still to fight here at home. There's a campaign underway and Americans are viewing the economy poorly. And his advisers believe that his message on the economy can and will break through. 
 
We do expect him to lead his remarks by talking about an emotional conversation that he convened this morning virtually with the families of Americans who are believed to be held hostage in the region. That is something that the White House has told us to expect. 
 
But it just shows you the juxtaposition of President Biden's week. On one hand, you have these routine events, like today's speech on the economy, at Rose Garden events talking about junk fees. And these very forceful and poignant messages that he's delivered to the American people and to the country of Israel as the U.S. issues this forceful response. 
 
But there are also various conversations happening about how best to help Israel. Several top lawmakers at the White House today to talk about potential funding packages for Israel, Ukraine, Taiwan, and the U.S. Mexico border. Though the U.S. -- the White House might have to take matters into its own hands by unlocking about $12 billion in existing aid, if there's no speaker of the House that can approve such a package. But -- 
 
BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: Kayla, I'm sorry to interrupt you. Let's listen to President Biden there in Philadelphia. 
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: ... here OK. And by the way, I'm a big Pennsylvania guy, but you have an advantage in Philly. One, I married a Philly girl. Two, you're between Scranton and Wilmington. You know, Scranton. You guys have no sense of humor, man. 
 
Look, Brian, thanks for the introduction. I really mean it. And before I get started, I want to acknowledge two brave police officers in a serious note were shot last night. One was killed at the Philadelphia airport. I talked to the chief and the mayor about this. They put their lives on the line to protect this community. We owe them a debt of gratitude and we're praying for them and for their families today. 
 
I also want to say a word about the situation in Israel. The more we learned about the attack, the more horrifying it becomes. More than 1,000, 1,000 innocent lives lost, including at least 27 Americans. These guys make -- they make Al Qaeda look pure. They're pure evil. But I they said from the beginning, the United States make no mistake about it, stands with Israel. The United States stands with Israel. 
 
Secretary of State Blinken was in Israel yesterday, and Secretary of Defense Austin is there today. We're making sure Israel has what it needs to defend itself and respond to these attacks. It's also priority for me to urgently address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. At my direction, our teams are working in the region, including communicating directly with the governments of Israel, Egypt, Jordan and other Arab nations, and the United Nations to surge support and humanitarian consequences for Hamas attack to help Israel. 
 
You know we have to -- we can't lose sight of the fact that the overwhelming majority of Palestinians had nothing to do with Hamas and Hamas's appalling attacks and their suffering as a result as well. 
 
This morning I spoke with the family members of all those Americans who are still unaccounted for on a zoom call for about an hour and 10, 15 minutes. They're going through agony not knowing what the status of their sons, daughters, husbands, wives, children are. You know, it's gut wrenching. I assured them my personal commitment to do everything possible, everything possible to return, every missing American to their families. We're working around the clock to secure the release of Americans held by Hamas in close cooperation with Israel and our partners around the region. We're not going to stop till we bring them home. 
 
Folks, now for the reason to be here. Secretary Granholm, no one's more enthusiastic about building our clean energy future than you are. And we also I've got so many friends here today. Pennsylvania delegation Josh Shapiro, governor, Mayor Kennedy is an old friend. One of my closest friends in the Senate and in politics, Bobby Casey, Representative Brendan Boyle is always there. And I have the governor, John Carney, from Delaware and Tom Carper, two of the best people I've ever worked with. And New Jersey delegation Donald Norcross. I kid Donald -- 
 <br>[15:35:00]
 
KEILAR: All right, so you're listening there to Joe Biden with an economic message in Philadelphia, but starting there with comments about what we saw in Israel and also addressing the humanitarian crisis that's unfolding in Gaza. He said that they are talking to Egypt and also Israel, of course, and Jordan as their trying to really get together the resources of the region to address the problem. 
 
SANCHEZ: Yes, to applause, the President again reiterating his message, the United States stands with Israel. Notably, he talked about communicating with the families of people being held hostage in Gaza. The President saying that he spoke with him for about an hour and 15 minutes, saying that the U.S. and its partners are working around the clock to secure the release. Saying we will not stop until we bring them home. 
 
We're going to keep monitoring the president's remarks and anything else he might say regarding the situation in Israel. We'll be right back with our special coverage in just moments.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (voice-over): I'm telling you, it's only the beginning. I'm not going to give you additional details. But it's only the beginning. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST: It was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu moments ago saying it is only the beginning. After a week of strikes on Gaza, we're watching a number of fast moving developments. Right now, Israel's Defense Forces say troops have raided Gaza over the past 24 hours, look for hostages taken by Hamas. Large scale strikes also continue in Gaza, and Israeli tanks are on the move near the border ahead of what is likely to be some form of ground incursion. 
 
The Israeli military has also ordered more than a million people out of the northern Gaza for their safety, suggesting people move to the south. The United Nations calls that impossible -- and that's their word. Jonathan Conricus from the IDF joins me now. Jonathan, appreciate you being with us. First of all, the raids that have taken place in Gaza, what more can you say about it? 
 
JONATHAN CONRICUS, INTERNATIONAL SPOKESMAN, IDF: Yes, hi. Thank you for having me. We're trying to solve a 1,300 piece puzzle and to get -- collect information and understand and account for each and every Israeli. So far we have been able to match most of the bodies of dead Israelis with their identities and to understand who is dead, who is missing and who we presume is being held hostage. 
 
The operations that you refer to those raids were aimed at collecting intelligence and understanding and shedding more light on where our people are. And I'm happy to say that we, indeed, did find some useful intelligence to disambiguate the situation a little bit. I can also say that it is a massive focus of effort of intelligence officers from all over Israel in order to locate where our hostages are and to find a way to get them out. 
 
COOPER: Hamas has made a claim that 13 Israeli hostages have been killed in airstrikes. Have you been able to confirm that claim at all? 
 
CONRICUS: No, I have not. Hamas is a lying, despicable terrorist organization and I think that their credibility is nonexistent. So I would take anything Hamas says with extreme caution. Hamas also said a few days ago -- and I think you and I spoke about it -- that they threaten to execute hostages if we don't stop bombing military targets in Gaza. So I am not aware of any confirmation and I am definitely aware of the fact that Hamas would likely try to place responsibility on anybody else but themselves. Let's be clear, Hamas is responsible for the safety of those hostages and ultimately they will pay the price for what they've done. 
 
COOPER: The Israeli government has warned residents in Gaza to move south, wanting more than a million to move south of the next 24 four hours. There's a number of humanitarian organizations that say that's impossible. Hamas has told people not to move. What -- to you, what does that say about Hamas and why they want people there? 
 
CONRICUS: First of all, I think that the people who claim that it's impossible will be proven wrong. I think that history teaches us that whenever a person is fighting for his life and is in a mortal danger, then usually people are able to accomplish quite significant things. And I think that Palestinians in Gaza understand that if they stay in Gaza City in the north, they are endangering themselves much more than necessary and it is within their interest of self preservation to move south of the Gaza River. 
 
It comes as no surprise to us that Hamas, which has a long and documented track record of war crimes and of using their own civilians as human shields, using civilian infrastructure for their military activities and firing from schools, mosques, hospitals, infirmaries and near to journalists. It comes to know as no surprise that they are now telling their civilians, don't heed the warnings of the Israelis. 
 <br>[15:45:00]
 
Don't go south. It makes no sense. I -- the only sense it makes is that Hamas wants to exasperate the humanitarian situation and apply pressure on Israel at the jeopardy of the lives of its own civilians. 
 
COOPER: The presence of the hostages, how much does it compromise or impact the military operations that Israel is planning? 
 
CONRICUS: Yes, this is by far the most complex and I think unprecedented challenge that we have faced. I mean, we have had many hostage situations in our history fighting terrorists, but nothing like this. The sheer scope and the complexity, the amount of people and the fact that they are held in a hostile area that is inaccessible as of now for us. And in something that was likely prepared in advance and that Hamas was prepared for this, makes it very, very challenging. To answer the question, I would say that the aim of our operation is to dismantle the military capabilities of Hamas. That is what we are doing now, and that is what we will continue to do until it is achieved. 
 
Jonathan Conricus, thank you for your time. 
 
We're going to take a short break.
 
CONRICUS: Thank you. 
 
COOPER: Our coverage continues in a moment. 
 <br>[15:50:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
KEILAR: We are tracking some breaking news off of Capitol Hill. The vote to select the GOP's nominee for House Speaker underway right now.
 
Let's take you live to Capitol Hill with CNN's Manu Raju. So, Manu, set the scene for us. 
 
MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, this is a secret ballot election in which Jim Jordan, the House Judiciary Committee chairman, is expected -- the favorite in this close -- in this election to nominate the next Speaker of the House. He is facing against a congressman named Austin Scott from Georgia, someone who has been frankly concerned about all of the events of these last week, the historic and unprecedented nature of the events by ousting the then speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy, on the floor. First time that's ever happened in history. 
 
Since then, this badly divided party has tried to figure out a way forward. Trying to decide whether or not to get behind any candidate for the speaker. But there's a problem. No one so far has been able to secure the votes in order to become speaker of the House. 
 
This vote will be very, very important, because even if Jim Jordan does win the nomination, that doesn't mean he has the votes to be elected speaker of the House. The key thing to watch here is the number of votes against him or the number of votes for Austin Scott. Assuming Jordan wins here, the majority of the 221 members, how close is he to that 217 vote threshold? If he is far below that number, then there'll be pressure on him to step aside and see if there's another candidate who could emerge. 
 
But if he's closer to that number, perhaps he'll try to push ahead and try to get more votes on his side. He has indicated for some time that he wants to have 217 votes behind him before going to the House floor. But has he changed his approach in any way? I've tried to ask that question to him several times today. He has not said one way or the other, other than the fact that he said we are going to try. We're going to push to get 217 votes. But if Jordan falters because he cannot get members to his side, then other candidates may jump into this race in this incredibly chaotic situation caused by Republican infighting that led to the speakers ouster and the paralysis in the House. And of course, guys that nothing can get done in this House until they are elect a new speaker which is adding such a sense of urgency to this moment as they try to select a new candidate who could potentially bring this House out of paralysis. 
 
KEILAR: Manu, it was interesting earlier you asked former Speaker Kevin McCarthy if he was worried that this chaotic process was going to cost Republicans the majority. Do they have a sense of how this looks not just to voters, but to people around the world, whether it's allies or foes of the U.S.? RAJU: Yes, they almost universally believe they look terrible. Almost
 
 every single member that you talked to realizes and recognizes that. But even they -- even though they recognize that they still cannot find consensus just because of how narrowly divided this conference is in the handful of members that scuttle their plans going forward, as we've seen. And that's what's happened all of this whole -- this whole time. So will it happen again? That's the key question. 
 
KEILAR: All right, Manu Raju covering what is even by Republicans own admission, quite a mess there on Capitol Hill. Thank you for that report. 
 
And up next, law enforcement agencies in the U.S. and also all around the world, they are on high alert as many are taking to the streets. Major cities here in the U.S. taking extra precautions. Stay with us for that story.
 <br>[15:55:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
SANCHEZ: Right now there is a coast to coast U.S. security challenge as demonstrators rally following Hamas attacks on Israel. 
 
KEILAR: CNN Shimon Prokuepecz is joining us now from a pro-Palestinian rally in New York's Times Square. Shimon tell us what you're seeing there. 
 
SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, thousands of people have come out here at this rally here in Times Square. We're just South of Time Square. But I want you guys to just take a look at the crowds as they stretch for about two blocks or so here just south of Times Square. And we've been talking to people in the crowd here who say, you know, both on the Israeli side and the Palestinian side, all are saying that this is not about Hamas. This is for those who are pro-Palestinian. Saying this is about freeing Palestine. And this is what we keep hearing from the chants here in the crowd saying free, free Palestine. 
 
We've spoke to one Palestinian who said, look, we understand the concerns over Hamas, that we are not in favor of Hamas. But they are facing a humanitarian crisis and this is why the thousands and thousands of them have come out here to voice their support for the Palestinian people. 
 
And it's also a very diverse crowd, I should note. You know, some of these folks are just here because they are anti-war. You know, they've done other protests like this across New York City. But overall, the concern here so far from folks, it has been the humanitarian crisis that could develop. And they're out here now voicing their support for the Palestinian people and that's why we're seeing the thousands and thousands. You know, there have been other rallies like this here in New York City, but this by far now the largest one since here the war began. 
 <br>[16:00:04] SANCHEZ: Shimon Prokuepecz reporting live from a rally in New York City. Thanks so much, Shimon. 
 
KEILAR: Obviously, a lot of news that we have been following today and hearing from the President as well, who spoke to the families of Americans who are still hostage. They believe to be held hostage in Gaza and promising American help. So many things developing when it comes to this story today. 
 
SANCHEZ: Yes, the president making clear that the United States would not would stop at nothing to get those hostages back. 
 
KEILAR: That's right. "THE LEAD" with Jake Tapper starting right now.
