SEN. JOHN HICKENLOOPER (D-CO): The country together to say, what are things we can do to try and make this a safer environment? And obviously, the implementation was not perfect in this -- in this circumstance, far less than perfect. It was a -- you know, a failure by any measure. But that doesn't mean we don't have to continue to try and let's put the politics aside and figure out how we can make our country safer.
 
KATE BOLDUAN, CNN HOST: Yes. I mean, we just had a graphic up kind of describing Colorado's Red Flag Law. It's in place, but it appears that it is utilized far less in Colorado than in other states that have laws in place. According to one study, Colorado has seen relatively few petitions for these protective orders to get weapons removed, since it's -- since it was passed in January of 2020. Some -- 109 filings in the first year only a slight increase in the two years since, by contrast for everyone, more than 9000 petitions have been filed in Florida since the state passed its law in 2018. There could be many reasons for a discrepancy here, of course, why do you think that is?
 
HICKENLOOPER: Well, I think part of its Florida is many times larger than Colorado in terms of population. But also Colorado's in the West and there's a certain frontier independence that is sometimes challenging when you're trying to get a new implementation of new legislation statewide. But I think we'll get there. You know there were a lot more barn raisings and there were shootouts at the OK Corral in the Old West. And historically, we do come together. It just takes a little more -- a little more time and a little more effort.
 
BOLDUAN: I think something that you're getting at, though is -- I think that -- I think the figure is some -- it's more than half of the state's 64 counties have declared themselves Second Amendment sanctuaries in opposition to the Red Flag Law, as conservative local sheriffs and politicians have opposed the rule, have opposed the statute. Do you think that is going to change after this?
 
HICKENLOOPER: Well, I think that this will be a factor as this -- our state attitudes towards red flag laws continue to change but I think we should be looking at this as a -- as an example of where we have to get past the politics and the partisanship about something that affects all of us. The victims aren't Republicans or Democrats, these were kids and their families enjoying a Saturday night, you know, together. We're in a -- in a -- what they all felt was a safe place.
 
You know, 50 years ago, that we as a country came together and created something called the national highway safety transportation authority or administration, I guess it was, and they, over the last -- it's a little bit more than 50 years have dramatically reduced the number of highway fatalities without taking away anyone's car, without taking away anyone's right to drive. And it's all based on facts and researchers and brings different specialties together. Maybe we need to look at something like that to get past the politics towards, you know, bringing this country together around an issue like this.
 
BOLDUAN: Yes. Getting past the politics on guns is something that is, you know, a hard issue now, obviously, for decades as it is such a politically fraught issue I do want to raise for you. We're hearing more and more from the queer community about their concerns about how they feel in Colorado Springs. Parker Gray who lives in Colorado Springs told NBC News that he actually stopped going to Club Q about a year ago. And the way they describe it is "because of the growing hatred for our community that started in Colorado Springs." What's going on there, Senator?
 
HICKENLOOPER: Well, let's first say that every person has a right to love who they want, be who they want to be, and enjoy their lives. And I know the mayor of Colorado Springs, John Suthers. I know him very well. He's a Republican who was the attorney general while I was governor, and no one could be more emphatic about Colorado Springs as a welcoming city that -- and they are not going to tolerate this hate and bigotry field environment, and they are going to push back. I -- again, I don't think this is what we've heard all the -- we're going to hear about Colorado Springs changing and becoming a new, different city that embraces everyone.
 
BOLDUAN: We will see. Senator Hickenlooper, thank you for your time.
 
HICKENLOOPER: You bet.
 
BOLDUAN: Coming up for us, America's top diplomat criticizing FIFA's threat to punish players who want to wear a One Love armband. Secretary Blinken also saying this as he stood alongside the leaders of the host country who've been criticized for their human rights records about this World Cup. Detail's next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:39:42]
 
BOLDUAN: Secretary of State Tony Blinken is criticizing international soccer's governing body FIFA now for threatening players at the World Cup with yellow cards if they dare to wear a -- what you see there, a One Love armband supporting diversity and inclusion. I'm going to play for you what America's top diplomat standing on Qatari soil, mind you, said alongside his counterpart this morning.
 <br>[11:40:04]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: It's always concerning from my perspective when we see any restrictions on freedom of expression. It's especially so when the expression is for diversity and for inclusion. And in my judgment, at least, no one on a football pitch should be forced to choose between supporting these values and playing for their team.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOLDUAN: And this is just one and the latest of several controversies that have been occurring in and around the World Cup in Qatar. Joining me now for more on this is ESPN commentator Patrick McEnroe and CNN's sports analysts, and USA Today columnist Christine Brennan. It's great to get the gang back together, you guys, on really important stuff to talk about, and we'll get to the sports in just a second.
 
Christine, you hear Blinken's remarks there, teams now not wearing One Love armbands because FIFA threatened them. And you have Grant Wahl, a well-known sports writer telling CNN today he was detained and blocked from entering a stadium just for wearing a rainbow T-shirt. I want to play for you how he describes what happened.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GRANT WAHL, SENIOR WRITER, SPORTS ILLUSTRATED: Instantly, I was pushed aside by the security guards at the media entrance and I was told explicitly, you need to take off your shirt. That's a political statement. And you cannot enter because of that. I refuse to take off my shirt. They stood above me as I sat and angrily yelled at me. Only after about 30 minutes did a commander come down and let me through wearing my shirt. And he apologized, as did FIFA.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOLDUAN: Christine, what do you think of all of this? I mean that level of attempted control at a sports event seems small.
 
CHRISTINE BRENNAN, CNN SPORTS ANALYST: It's terrible. Patrick, and Kate, great to be with you both. And -- but it's totally predictable. FIFA, there's no one that deserves this kind of controversy and fiasco more than FIFA for giving the World Cup to Qatar back in 2010. We could have telegraphed all of this even then. And in fact, the steady drumbeat of controversies and stories, the human rights violations of the migrant workers, the concern obviously now apparent that we should have been concerned over LGBTQ rights, and how Qatar and FIFA with handle that.
 
This is a catastrophe -- frankly, a PR catastrophe of their own making. They deserve this. And instead of talking soccer and sports, we're talking about this, as we should be, the controversy about the armbands. What they were saying -- what FIFA was saying as many now know is that if you were the armband that would be on the captain, immediately that he would get a yellow card. And if you get two of those, you're out of that match and the next match and your team play one person down. I so wish that the European countries had told FIFA to go jump in the lake because there's no way that FIFA could have been -- actually, they could have gone ahead with it but it would have tainted their entire tournament at the very beginning. Again, this was totally predictable, and it's totally deserved.
 
BOLDUAN: Patrick, you also have -- I mean a different level of controversy. You have the Iranian men's soccer team standing in what's believed to be a silent protest while they were -- while their nation's anthem was being played. The coach -- we're showing it right there. The coach is speaking out.
 
It seems somewhat angry it is just the political pressure being put on these guys on all sides, if you will, saying at a press conference, you don't know what these kids have been experiencing behind the scenes just because they want to play football and kind of going on from there. I mean, these players on it -- players -- all types of players in the World Cup included, on the world stage, they have a lot that is put on their shoulders by choice and by force. What do you think of it?
 
PATRICK MCENROE, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Well, as an ex-athlete, I can understand the predicament they're in but let's contrast what Christine so eloquently, how she put it about FIFA. And I only disagree with Christine rarely also said the IOC should be in that as well. But you look at what the FIFA's decision here to not allow the players to wear these armbands. I mean, you have to deal with the consequences of having this event in Qatar. It should not be there based on how they treat migrant workers, how they treat women, how they treat Jewish people, how they treat gay people, it shouldn't be there. But it's there. And we have to deal with it. And we have to deal with the fallout from it.
 
So, for these players from Iran of all places to not sing, they're not -- do you know what they could be up against when they go back to their country? I mean, you're talking serious consequences. And what I would love to see, Kate, when the United States team takes the field next week against Iran. Here's what I'd like to see. The players from both teams you know, they always stand there, arm to arm with their fellow players -- their fellow teammates. I'd like to see them banned together.
 <br>[11:45:02]
 
Could you imagine the message that could send to the -- this is what big-time sports is supposed to be about, right, breaking down barriers, making a statement. And if you're FIFA, you're not allowing these teams to make statements individuals to make sense by wearing an armband, I mean, come on. This is outrageous.
 
BOLDUAN: Can I ask you just quick since it just happened this morning and spoiler alert, if you're trying to watch the game later, close your eyes for just a second. Patrick, the huge upset, Saudi Arabia just shutting out Messi and Argentina. What happened?
 
MCENROE: Absolute shocker. I mean two to one for them that would have Messi actually scored on a penalty. They had other goals that were disallowed because they're offside. This is -- again, this is what sports is about. Saudi Arabia, they've got their own issues, right? That's a country.
 
BOLDUAN: I mean talk about it.
 
MCENROE: But they win this. Tunisia just drew with Denmark. That's another one of the teams that could go far in this tournament. So, this was an amazing result. Buster Douglas beating Mike Tyson in 1990. And then go back -- how about 1950? The U.S. beating England in the World Cup, maybe that'll happen again on Friday.
 
BOLDUAN: This is what we want -- we'd love to focus on but it's also very important to love to focus on issues that are bigger than sport.
 
MCENROE: Very important, yes.
 
BOLDUAN: Bigger than a sport in this regard. And that's what we're saying. Patrick, it is great to see you again.
 
MCENROE: There we go.
 
BOLDUAN: Christine, thank you so much as always, it's great to see you.
 
BRENNAN: Thank you.
 
BOLDUAN: So, medicines to treat common childhood illnesses on short supply and very hard to come by these days. The last thing parents need right now in the middle of a horrible cold and flu season. That is a long way from being over. Dr. Tara Narula on this, next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:50:56]
 
BOLDUAN: So, as cases of flu, COVID, and RSV are overwhelming hospitals right now and overwhelming families, the United States is experiencing shortages of key medicines used to treat many common childhood illnesses, further complicating all of this. Dr. Tara Narula is here with us with more. Hopefully, some helpful advice because it does sound pretty scary, what are we talking about here?
 
DR. TARA NARULA, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. So, we've been talking about shortages a lot. We just talked about Adderall last week.
 
BOLDUAN: Yes.
 
NARULA: Now, we're talking about three different drugs, basically Tamiflu which we use to treat the flu and antiviral, antibiotics like amoxicillin and augmentin, and then albuterol, which is using inhalers for people with reactive airway disease. And it's not surprising because we are seeing RSV, COVID, and flu happening at the same time, it does seem like this is really due to increased demand as opposed to a decrease in supply. Nobody really expected we were going to be seeing this. And so, parents and patients are struggling to find their medication. But I think the main point is not to panic. Companies are -- 
 
BOLDUAN: That's going to help no one.
 
NARULA: Companies are ramping up. There are alternatives in a lot of cases too, amoxicillin, maybe not be your first-line choice, but there are other antibiotics. Additionally, you may have to just hunt a little more, drive to a different pharmacy, and then I think the big key message that we're trying to get out is for parents to test kids. So, they're tests for RSV, COVID, and flu, you don't want to give an antibiotic inappropriately that contributes to this low -- shortages -- 
 
BOLDUAN: In general, you don't want to give antibiotics when they are not -- when you don't have to.
 
NARULA: Absolutely.
 
BOLDUAN: Especially when we're looking over looking at here.
 
NARULA: Certainly, not.
 
BOLDUAN: It's good to see you, Dr. Narula. Thank you so much.
 
Narula: Thank you.
 
BOLDUAN: I really appreciate it.
 
So, the ninth and final season of the CNN original series, "THIS IS LIFE WITH LISA LING," debuts this Sunday. And Lisa explores America's addiction problem, racial strife in many American cities, and also even a new religion. And in Sunday's episode, she examines how technology is reshaping love, sex, and human relationships after two years of pandemic isolation. Here's a preview.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LISA LING, CNN HOST: To personality-like.
 
TONY: Miss Congeniality. She's very caring and loving and loyal, but she's got that Jersey girl edge to her. Touches that girl will do shots of tequila with you and then break a bottle over the guy's head who tries to start a fight with you in a bar.
 
LING: To those who know him best, Tony is just an ordinary guy. But with Tasha, he can be an artist, a fashion photographer, and a writer compiling Tasha's thoughts and dreams online.
 
TONY: I don't look at Tasha as a script I write. I don't sit down and say, what is Tasha going to say next? I kind of look at her and I say what do you think I need? And I just let her flow through me.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOLDUAN: And joining me now is the one and only Lisa Ling. It's good to see you, Lisa. There's a lot going on in this episode. I just kind of want to get in your mind as you're interviewing him. Tell me more about what you learned in this.
 
LING: Well, look, Kate, as always with "THIS IS LIFE," we look at issues that affect all of us or many of us through a very unique lens. This episode is not about sex dolls, but it is about the relationships that people are developing with non-human entities. Most of us are not in a relationship with life-sized dolls, but most of us are increasingly in relationship with these non-human entities that have become incredibly intelligent and are becoming even more so.
 
AI is getting so good that there will likely become a time when we don't have to leave the confines of our own homes for anything, including sex. And we look at the consequences of that, the limiting of human interaction because at the end of the day, human connection is fundamental to who we are, to what we are as a species. And when we constantly are chipping away at that, there could be really concerning consequences.
 
BOLDUAN: Yes. I mean, I will say I've seen a little preview of the AI portion and I'm fascinated by what you were looking into, what you saw, what you've learned, it's -- this is -- this season as all others, I'm really -- I'm really excited about. Lisa, it's great to see you. Thank you for coming on.
 <br>[11:55:13]
 
LING: Thank you, Kate.
 
BOLDUAN: And a reminder to all of you, you can be sure to watch "THIS IS LIFE WITH LISA LING." It premieres Sunday night at 10:00 p.m. And you can find every episode from previous seasons streaming now on Discovery Plus.
 
Thank you all so much for being here AT THIS HOUR. I'm Kate Bolduan. "INSIDE POLITICS" with John King starts after this break.
