PAMELA BROWN, CNN HOST: Get ready for 2025. We are just hours away from the New Year and celebrations are already underway around the world as we say goodbye to 2024.
 
And the nation is celebrating the life of Jimmy Carter and preparing to say a final farewell. What his grandson told us about what kept him going so long.
 
And college football players and coaches dreaming about getting one step closer to this, the College Football Playoff National Championship Trophy. The quarterfinals begin tonight.
 
I'm Pamela Brown in Washington. All of this and more ahead on a special New Year's Eve edition of CNN News Central.
 
Several cities around the world have already bid farewell to 2024 and are celebrating a new year.
 
Shouts of Happy New Year rang out in Hong Kong's Victoria Harbour just a few hours ago as a dazzling fireworks show lit up the skies at the stroke of midnight.
 
And an hour later, it was Thailand's turn. Crowds in Bangkok kicked off the New Year with a spectacular seven minute fireworks display.
 
Take a look at Sydney, Australia. The city welcomed 2025 with its biggest fireworks show ever. It featured a golden waterfall effect cascading from the iconic Sydney Harbor Bridge. Organizers say more than nine tons of fireworks were used for the big event.
 
And back here in the U.S. we are still hours away from one of the largest and most famous New Year's Eve celebrations in the world in New York City's Times Square. And the NYPD is making sure it's prepared for anything when the ball drops tonight.
 
CNN's Brynn Gingras joins us now. Brynn, you've been out all morning, all day. Bring us up to speed on how it is.
 
BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yeah. Pam, listen, I got really tired of being bold by myself in Times Square, decided to walk an avenue west and I found everybody who's ready to party. Look at all these people. So I basically found that everybody was just, you know, an avenue away, waiting in line for hours trying to get into Times Square.
 
We have a birthday girl. We've got the girls that are glammed up. And the award for the person that traveled furthest to get to New York City is this guy, coming from South Korea. Tell me, how did you -- why did you have to be here for New York City?
 
MAN #1: Fold the board drop. Definitely.
 
GINGRAS: Yeah. Are you excited to see it?
 
MAN #1: Yeah.
 
GINGRAS: And you don't care if it's going to be raining all night long?
 
MAN #1: Yeah.
 
GINGRAS: Are you dressed for the rain? Are we dressed for the rain?
 
MAN #1: Oh, I have a raincoat over here.
 
GINGRAS: Okay, so you guys are all set. What is the most exciting part? Where are we from? 
 
WOMAN #1: From Germany.
 
GINGRAS: Germany. That's another one. I love meeting people from all over the world coming to this amazing celebration. Why did you guys have to be here?
 
WOMAN #1: Because of my son, because he lives here.
 
GINGRAS: Oh, he lives here -- 
 
MAN #2: Yeah, it's a one in lifetime experience.
 
GINGRAS: It is.
 
MAN #2: So we have to be here.
 
GINGRAS: It is.
 
WOMAN #1: Of course, we must be here.
 
GINGRAS: What are we most excited about? The confetti? The actual ball? The music acts? What are we most excited for?
 
MAN #3: From Naples, Italy.
 
GINGRAS: Oh, you're from Naples. Okay. All right. What are we excited for?
 
MAN #4: I'm from the Philippines.
 
GINGRAS: Oh, from the Philippines. Okay. We're just shouting out where everybody's from, which is so exciting. That's the best part about all of this, is that there are people from all over the world, all over New York, all over the U.S. coming here together to ring in 2025.
 
A million people expected to pack Times Square, which is a block away, an avenue away, very shortly. They will be let in with the most secure area, the NYPD says, because they take every measure to make sure it is -- this year, 2025 is rolling in in a safe way. And you know what, Pam? We got a lot of excited people ready to party tonight.
 
P. BROWN: Yeah, from the far corners of the world, right there with you, Times Square, New York, for them once -- as the one person said, once in a lifetime experience. 
 <br>[14:05:07]
 
Brynn Gingras, thanks for bringing the energy and fun on this New Year's Eve.
 
And let's take a look now at some of the New Year's Eve festivities happening around the world. CNN's Eleni Giokos joins us from Athens, Greece. And Victoria Rubadiri in Nairobi, Kenya. So, Eleni, you first tell us how people in Athens are preparing to ring in the New York -- New Year. 
 
ELENI GIOKOS, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT: Well, happy New Year from Athens, Greece. I'm at the Stavros Niarchos Cultural Center. This is one of three mega parties that are happening in the city right now. Last year, over 20,000 people came. Here, look, you're going to have music. There's going to be a DJ in true Greek style playing music until the sun comes up. I mean, Greek people, if you've ever been to Greece, you know, they do not sleep.
 
Now, many people had gotten their presence over New Year -- over Christmas Eve. That's the big sort of tradition, I think globally. But for Greeks, it's all about New Year's Eve. And actually we have someone called Ayo Vasili, which is St. Basile. He brings gifts tonight. It is super special. And it's part of sort of this cultural experience that we have.
 
And then also what we wait for on New Year's Eve is this, Pamela. This is called a vasilopita. And it might just seem like a normal bread or cake, but actually inside there's a coin that's hidden. And then you cut this up. And whoever gets the coin has the best luck for the year ahead. And honestly, that sort of sets the tone for the rest of the year. People and families are sitting at home doing this ritual right now.
 
And we -- look, we've got three hours to go. Things are starting to get heated. You've got some people on the ice rink. You've got people starting to come around. It is pretty chilly, but I'm telling you, the vibe is here and you're just feeling the energy. It's so much fun.
 
P. BROWN: It looks like it. And I love all of your sparkles, Eleni. GIOKOS: Yeah.
 
P. BROWN: So perfect for New Year's Eve.
 
GIOKOS: Thank you. Once in a lifetime experience that I can wear sparkles on CNN.
 
P. BROWN: There you go. I mean, what better day than New Year's Eve? So, Victoria, you're in Kenya right now. What's going on there? How are folks in Kenya planning to ring in the New Year?
 
VICTORIA RUBADIRI, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, we're planning to bring in the New Year in style, as you can tell. I'm at RahaFest, it's one of the major music festivals here in Kenya. Trying to set Kenya and Nairobi up as a destination spot for international artists from across Africa. We have some from the Caribbean who will be performing a bit later on tonight.
 
But what we are waiting for is the spectacle of the firework display at midnight. Less than two hours to go. But a fun fact about the venue that we are at, it's called Uhuru Gardens. Now, Uhuru in Swahili means freedom. It's one of the places that our founding fathers picked as the place to celebrate our first Independence Day. This was back in 1963.
 
So this literally was the birthplace of a new Kenya. Very fitting to bring in 2025, certainly the hope for many, many Kenyans considering the uniquely challenging year that we had in 2024. So of course, we'll be back with that huge firework display as Kenyans bring in 2025.
 
P. BROWN: All right. Well, happy New Year's to both of you. Eleni, Victoria, thank you so much. 
 
And a reminder, the boys are back for the biggest party of the year. Join Anderson Cooper and Andy Cohen for New Year's Eve live.
 
A New Year's Eve blackout in Puerto Rico. What caused nearly 90% of the island to lose electricity as people were preparing to celebrate the New Year?
 
And the plans have been finalized to honor the life and legacy of former President Jimmy Carter. We have details on his motorcades path and the state funeral.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:13:25]
 
P. BROWN: The nation is preparing to say its final farewell to Jimmy Carter. The 39th President's state funeral has been set for January 9th at Washington's National Cathedral, and one of the eulogies will be delivered by his grandson, Jason Carter. Last hour I spoke with Jason about his grandfather's life and legacy.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JASON CARTER, GRANDSON OF PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER: The thing he taught me about politics that sometimes gets lost is you can be a person like him who doesn't change, who stays who they are, who stays true to their principles and their beliefs despite all of the temptations of politics.
 
For us in the family, of course, he was a rock for us. But we all know that because of the extent to which he shared himself with the rest of the world, a lot of people in this world are out there carrying on his legacies.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
P. BROWN: And before Jimmy Carter returns to Washington, his fellow Georgians will get their chance to say goodbye first. CNN's Eva McKend is in Carter's hometown of Plains with more details.
 
EVA MCKEND, CNN NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: Barricades going up as preparations are underway for the many celebrations of life to come in the days ahead for former President Jimmy Carter. And those that knew him best say that they hope that these tributes are defined by the small town values that Carter held so dear.
 
PHIL WISE, CARTER FAMILY FRIEND: I think the simplistic values that he had that he tried to follow were the most important parts of his legacy. Again, whether it was in a small town or a larger city or the state level or national level or internationally, recognizing that everyone's an individual and that there's a reason to have respect and dignity for every life and every person, and to keep that in mind whenever you're making policies or decisions.
 <br>[14:15:19]
 
MCKEND: On Saturday morning, there will be a funeral service in nearby Americas, Georgia. Then the motorcade will proceed here through Plains Carter's hometown, where people will have the opportunity to line the streets to pay their respects. Eva McKend, CNN, Plains, Georgia.
 
P. BROWN: Thank you, Eva. And we have some other sad news to pass along to you. Former CNN anchor and renowned journalist Aaron Brown has died at the age of 76. Brown helped shape CNN's journalism over the years, rising to prominence with his coverage of major events such as 9/11. CNN's Nick Watt has a look at a remarkable career.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NICK WATT, CNN REPORTER: Calm, human, clear.
 
AARON BROWN, CNN ANCHOR: And there, as you can see, perhaps the second tower, the front tower, the top portion of which is collapsing. Good Lord. There are no words.
 
WATT: Aaron Brown talked millions of people through the most shocking event of the television age. Planes hitting the World Trade Center on 9/11. A. BROWN: This was the biggest moment in my lifetime, in every sense in the history of my country, in the history of my business, in my personal, professional life. I just wanted to get it right.
 
Just look at that. That is about as frightening a scene as you will ever see.
 
WATT: Brown reported for 17 hours straight. A producer told him in his ear, just think, whoever did this is probably watching you right now. And a colleague told me Brown rose to that solemn occasion.
 
A. BROWN: I was way too busy to be afraid of anything. When it ended at one, something in the morning and I -- I sat down in the corner of the roof. Then a lot of things happened, a lot of emotions happened.
 
WATT: Born outside of Minneapolis in 1948, Brown's TV news career began with a string of gigs in Seattle, where he became a much loved fixture and met his wife of over 40 years, Charlotte Raynor. Brown went on to gain nationwide renown reporting and anchoring at PBS and ABC News, where his quirky style built a following.
 
A. BROWN: We had this idea that the program should take the news seriously, but not itself seriously.
 
WATT: And most notably here at CNN, the real deal. An anchor and a writer. Brown reported on war.
 
A. BROWN: Across the region, whether it is Kuwait or Baghdad these air raid sirens, warning sirens and all clear sirens have been going on and off and on and off all day.
 
WATT: Seismic politics.
 
A. BROWN: We're all looking for that one race that says that's the one the Democrats had to have.
 
WATT: Disasters close to home.
 
A. BROWN: It became clear today that the Gulf Coast is facing the type of crisis we expect to see in a developing country, not the richest country in the world.
 
WATT: And those far away.
 
A. BROWN: This is a place of great sorrow.
 
WATT: After a tsunami killed a quarter million people in 2004, Brown anchored his show 14 days straight in brutal conditions from the hardest hit island.
 
A. BROWN: This is a place where four months from now, they'll still be picking up the dead.
 
WATT: Both tough and a joy to work with, one colleague from that trip told me. Thoughtful, funny, diligent, unique, said Anderson Cooper from the generation that followed Brown. A quintessential newsman, Brown's former producer Molly Levinson said of him, he accepted nothing less than excellence and he gave nothing less than endless loyalty in return. There's no one like him and he will be deeply missed.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
P. BROWN: And CNN has received a statement from Aaron Brown's wife, Charlotte Raynor, saying, Aaron got to do the work that he loved and he felt lucky to do that work as part of a community of people who were dedicated to good journalism and who became good friends. Over the course of his career, Aaron worked morning shifts, night shifts and of course, the Overnight, a program he absolutely loved working on, but he always found a way to make both ordinary and special times with our daughter Gabby and me. These last few years when we have all been able to live in the same city, have been the sweetest time for Aaron and me.
 
Former CNN Anchor Aaron Brown was 76.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:24:42]
 
P. BROWN: We are just days away from the swearing in of a new Congress and House Speaker Mike Johnson is bracing for a rocky start to the New Year as looks to lock down enough votes to keep his gavel in 2025. Now, Johnson got a boost from President Elect Trump yesterday, who endorsed the speaker on Truth Social.
 
But Johnson's fate is still up in the air. 
 <br>[14:25:00]
 
He must navigate a historically tight Congress and can only afford to lose a single Republican vote. For more on this, Alayna Treene joins us now. Alayna, how much will Trump's endorsement make a difference? That's the big question, right? 
 
ALAYNA TREENE, CNN REPORTER: It is. I think there's no question that Donald Trump's endorsement of him is going to help Mike Johnson. The question is whether or not it will be enough to really sway a lot of the conservatives who have said that they are skeptical of him. And as you mentioned, he can only afford to lose one Republican vote. And already Rep. Thomas Massie has said that he is planning to vote against him.
 
Now, I do want to read for you what Donald Trump wrote with just days to go before this leadership election, he said, quote, "Let's not blow this great opportunity which we have been given. The American people need immediate relief from all of the destructive policies of the last administration. Speaker Mike Johnson is a good, hardworking, religious man. He will do the right thing and we will continue to win. Mike has my complete and total endorsement."
 
Now, the thing that was very interesting about this, Pamela, is that it was unclear if Donald Trump was going to weigh in. When I talked to Donald Trump's advisers and those working on the transition, they said it wasn't very clear until he actually pressed send on this True Social post, especially after we saw him kind of go head to head with Mike Johnson in the week leading up to the holiday recess when lawmakers returned home for the holidays.
 
Now, Mike Johnson, for his part, I will say, said that he was honored and humbled to have Donald Trump's support. I want you to take a listen to how he responded.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KELLYANE CONWAY, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Do you have the votes?
 
REP. MIKE JOHNSON, (R) HOUSE SPEAKER: I think we do, Kellyanne. I'm really humbled and honored to have President Trump's endorsement for speaker again. He and I work so well together, so closely together, and we have a lot of big things to do. He recognizes that what we need right now, I think my colleagues recognize this as well. This could be the most consequential presidency and Congress of the modern era.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TREENE: Now, Pamela, I will also say that in talking to my sources close to Donald Trump, they argued that part of the reason Donald Trump came out and endorsed him is because he really wants a speaker who is going to be loyal to him. And Donald Trump does believe that Mike Johnson will carry out his agenda, especially after seeing him really work for months now to show Donald Trump that he is in his corner.
 
And now I just want to add as well, given that it is New Year's Eve today, I want to share with you what Donald Trump is planning to do. He is going to be hosting his annual New Year's Eve party at Mar-a- Lago. We are told that he is expected to walk the red carpet and likely take questions from reporters as he enters. But this is really kind of the last hurrah for Donald Trump before he goes back to Washington.
 
I know that many of Donald Trump's family members are going to be there as well as many celebrities. We know in the past, people like Tiger Woods and Martha Stewart, Serena Williams, just a few names to mention have been in attendance at this big party. So stay tuned for that tonight and what Donald Trump says as he enters. Pamela.
 
P. BROWN: All right. Alayna Treene, thank you so much.
 
Well, right now in Puerto Rico, a massive power outage has left nearly 90% of the island without electricity on this New Year's Eve. A critical failure of the energy grid is being blamed for this outage. Puerto Rico's energy company says it will likely take more than two days to fully restore power.
 
And today, warning from health officials as COVID cases surge across the U.S. The CDC is reporting a rise in coronavirus infections this month. The latest data shows cases in the U.S. Tripled last week compared to early December. New cases are spiking across the country, especially in the Midwest where COVID-19 levels are nearly twice as high as they are in other parts of the U.S.
 
Superstars Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have settled their divorce and ending a contentious eight-year legal battle that included a custody trial over their six children. In 2022, an FBI report billed -- Jolie had accused Pitt of assaulting her and their kids on a private jet in 2016. Now, Jolie filed for -- Jolie filed for divorce soon after that incident. Pitt was never arrested or charged with any crimes. Jolie's lawyer says the actress is relieved the divorce is now settled. CNN has reached out to representatives for Pitt for comment.
 
And still ahead, as we count down to midnight in the U.S., we're also taking you around the world to show you how other countries are ringing in 2025.
 
And for many, New Year's Day means college football. Are you one of those people? Well, we take a look at the teams hitting the field tomorrow with an eye on a chance to reach the championship.
