KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR:  OK, because this gets to the thing that I'm harping on and don't have an answer to. I lean to you to help me. The timing question is confusing for me. It's at the same time and the same moment, it's too late to do anything about changing candidates and getting more money and finding a candidate and fixing it and moving on. But we're also in a perpetual state of the next 24, 48, 72 hours are critical. I'm seeing quotes upon quotes of the next 96, 94, I mean, pick you number of hours. So I don't know what to do. 
 
ALYSSA FARAH GRIFFIN, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  I think we're going to see the dam start to break on Capitol Hill. If I were advising Democrats --  
 
BOLDUAN:  People have been saying that for a week, Alyssa.
 
GRIFFIN:  Wait for more to come. If I were advising Democrats, honestly, the smartest thing they could do is take all the oxygen out of the RNC, next week, saying we're entertaining an open convention. Biden is passing the baton. We're going to have our best party leadership come together. And every eyeball in America would say, oh, wait, the six in ten Americans who didn't want Biden or Trump, I can't wait to see what the other option is. That's what they should do and use the next three-and-a-half months to boost that person and try to win. 
 
BOLDUAN:  Still, you have Chris Coons just on co-chair saying he is running, but he has decide -- no, you're not going to get the last word. I get the last word. We're moving on. 
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
BOLDUAN:  It's great to see you. 
 
A new hour of CNN NEWS CENTRAL starts right now. 
 
All righty, friends, the press conference and the fallout, new reporting this morning on how President Biden's campaign is feeling after last night, and also what former President Obama and Nancy Pelosi are saying, not publicly, privately. 
 
This also -- Biden is heading to Michigan today. What are voters in that battleground state saying about his campaign right now? CNN watched the press conference with some of those voters.
 
And intelligence officials are warning of the impact deepfakes could have on the 2024 election, even putting out examples to show how sophisticated they have become.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It was created with both the consent and cooperation of the real Secretary Fontes, which, again, is not me. I'm an A.I. impersonation of him.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOLDUAN:  Yikes. I'm Kate Bolduan with Sara Sidner. John Berman is out today. This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL.
 
SARA SIDNER, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Happening today, he's ignoring all the haters. President Biden is heading straight to a crucial battleground state. This hot off the press, the heels of that press conference that by all accounts so far has not, though, silenced the Democratic doubts surrounding his reelection run. 
 
Shortly after the presser, three more Democratic lawmakers, including the top Democrat on the House Intel Committee, Representative Jim Himes, called for him to step aside. This mean now a total of 17 lawmakers publicly feel this way, and Congressman Himes gave this warning to those who are still standing by him.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. JIM HIMES, (D-CT):  Imagine that three months from now we get another performance like there was in the debate right before the election. Do you want to take that risk? I don't.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SIDNER:  CNN senior White House correspondent Kayla Tausche is leading us off again this morning. Kayla, first, how is the Biden team looking at what happened, these new defections, right after a press conference that you reported they're quite proud of? 
 
KAYLA TAUSCHE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  They were quite proud of the performance at the president put on last night. They said that he hit the marks that they expected him to. He had a little humor, a little retail politicking, some substance on foreign policy, and he prosecuted the case against Donald Trump in their view. But they are still bracing for more defections. And even though they saw this as a little bit of progress after two weeks of setbacks, they did not expect that it would end all of the questions, the conjectures, and, yes, the defections by some members of the president's own party, which they expect to continue, especially for members who are up for reelection in swing districts or in swing states, those so-called frontliners. 
 
But even so, last night President Biden was unapologetic in his decision to run for president again in the first place, and to continue running despite his performance in the debate. Here's what he said.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  And I think I'm the most qualified person to run for president. I beat him once, and I will beat him again. 
 
I'm not in this for my legacy. I'm in this to complete the job I started.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAUSCHE:  Saying he's the most qualified person to run for president. But when asked directly about the qualifications of his vice president, Kamala Harris, he took an opportunity to praise her and say that she would be ready to be president on day one, and that's why he selected her as vice as president. 
 
And then when he was asked about the polling for Harris, specifically, and whether she could beat Trump, here is how Biden responded.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  If your team came back and showed you data that she would fare better against former president Donald Trump, would you reconsider your decision to stay in the race? 
 <br>[08:05:05]
 
JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  No, unless they came back and said, there's no way you can win. Me. No one is saying that. No poll says that. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAUSCHE:  He also employed a similar response when asked whether his campaign would allow delegates at the convention to cast a vote for another person in the party, and he said yes, of course, they're free to do whatever they choose. But he again whispered and said, no one is going to do that. So clearly dismissive of any potential alternative outcome taking place, at least in this stage of the race, even though he acknowledged that there are others who could beat Trump, not just him. 
 
SIDNER:  All right, Kayla Tausche, thank you so much, live there from the White House for us. Kate? 
 
BOLDUAN:  Also this morning, exclusive CNN reporting on former President Barack Obama and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi privately expressing concerns about how much harder they think it has become for President Biden to beat Donald Trump now. CNN's Jeff Zeleny joins me right now. Where does that private conversation lead, do you think, Jeff? 
 
JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey Kate, good morning. Well, it is still a private conversation, but one thing that's clear, many Democrats on Capitol Hill and really across the party sort of looking to some party elders and leaders for guidance, or a way out of this crisis that's been really consuming the party for more than two weeks now. So naturally, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and former President Barack Obama come to mind as many Democrats are looking for sort of a way out, if you will. 
 
And we are learning that they've had a conversation this week trying to allay those concerns from some Democrats, not necessarily tipping their hands on the scale just yet. But we do know that Speaker Pelosi, of course, said earlier this week that the president still has time to make a decision. Of course, he said again last night, his decision is clear.
 
So we do believe there will be more conversations with Pelosi and President Biden, perhaps as early as sometimes this afternoon or over the weekend. And this could give us more of a sense of their conversations. But their private conversations, all their aides say they remain private. They do not read those out. 
 
But what we do know is that they both have expressed concern to a variety of Democrats about President Biden's ability to win in November. So this is the moment of the party where time is running out. There is no doubt the Democrats are expecting more defections, as Kayla was just reporting. But again, will these party elders, as well as Senator Schumer, perhaps Jim Clyburn and others, have a conversation with President Biden, or that's fraught as well. This is his decision to make, of course. But there are still these conversations going on behind the scenes, Kate.
 
BOLDUAN:  I was just looking down, sorry, Jeff, because I was just looking at Jim Clyburn who was on "The Today Show" this morning and asked about his -- he's clearly critical. He saved Biden's primary in 20. He's a huge -- his opinion matters. He was asked about what the fallout is and the impact, and I'm seeing some of the quotes from it. Essentially he was asked, should the conversation about the president getting out of this race, should that conversation continue? Jim Clyburn says no, it shouldn't. And it's up to -- saying he's earned the right, and I am going to give him that respect. If he decides to change his mind later on, we will respond to that. We have until the 19th of August to open our convention. 
 
Jim Clyburn basically says the conversation should be over, whereas other people continue to say the dam could still be breaking. What do you think -- what do you think the impact of Jim Clyburn's words will have now? 
 
ZELENY:  It's interesting. I was watching that interview as well, actually, this morning, Kate, and I was struck by how he said we have until August 19th. That, of course, is the Democratic Convention in Chicago. But most Democrats think they do not have that much time at all should there be a need to replace the president. So yes, I was not surprised that he is standing with President Biden,
 
 but if you parse some of his interview language as well, he said it is still his decision to make. Yes, he is standing with him. He thinks he should be given respect. Really, the bottom line to all of this sort of translating so many of our conversations is that they're trying to give the president space to change his mind should he want to. And we heard President Biden for the first time last night say that if he's presented with the polling data saying that he would lose, that is something that could force a reconsideration. 
 
What we didn't see last night from President Biden was not as defiant, not as combative, more that he is listening to these concerns. And as he travels to Michigan today, they're trying to reframe this conversation, not about Joe Biden, but about Donald Trump. Of course, that is what his campaign, in his view, is about. Michigan, very important without question. 
 <br>[08:10:00]
 
It's one of those battleground states, now it's leaning Republican in our map. But President Biden trying to refocus the conversation. The question is, are Democrats ready to move on? We will see today more. Kate? 
 
BOLDUAN:  Yes. I mean, look, Michigan was critical in 20, even more critical in 24. And it's even more of a question of which way it's going to go this time. Welcome to battleground Michigan. Its good to see you, Jeff. Sara?
 
SIDNER:  All right, the world is watching President Biden's high- stakes news conference at the close of that NATO summit. In just a moment, we will speak with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg to get his reaction. Kate will be talking to him in just a bit. 
 
And a driver with a learner's permit accidentally turned a restaurant into a drive-through. What a mess. We'll talk about that coming up.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[08:15:17]  
 
BOLDUAN: Some of the big headlines from a week some of world leaders gathering in Washington. NATO allies affirming Ukraine's future is in NATO and its path irreversible, pledging long-term support for Kyiv, though falling short of the targets that Zelenskyy has been begging for and taking on Russia and China in a whole new way. Listen.  
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  
 
JENS STOLTENBERG, NATO SECRETARY-GENERAL: China has become a decisive enabler of Russia's war against Ukraine and China's support increases the threat Russia poses to Euro-Atlantic security.  
 
China provides dual use equipment, microelectronics, a lot of other tools which are enabling Russia to build the missiles, to build the bombs, to build the aircraft, to build the weapons they are using to attack Ukraine.  
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)  
 
BOLDUAN: And helping to lead it all is that man, the outgoing Secretary General of NATO Jens Stoltenberg. He is closing out a pivotal decade at the helm at NATO, the term ending as NATO faces down an unfolding land war in Europe, of course, very critical times.  
 
The Secretary General joins me now. Thanks for being here.  
 
The declaration also says this in part about China, and I wanted to read it for everyone to remind them what it says that China cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation, which implies that China will pay a cost, Secretary General for continued and growing support of Russia.  
 
But what is that cost? What is the threat here?  
 
STOLTENBERG: First of all, I think it is important to understand that the fact that 32 NATO allies, representing 50 percent of the world economy so clearly states the responsibility of China in enabling the brutal war of aggression conducted by Russia against Ukraine. We have never had anything being like that before in our agreed and negotiated policy documents and that puts the responsibility where it belongs in Beijing, in China and that is a clear message in itself and China has reacted and I think that's a proof that they have understood the message.  
 
Second, it is not for NATO to impose sanctions. That's for the European Union, for the United States, for different member allies, but the fact that we saw clearly state what we do, because we know that China is propping up the Russian war economy, delivering the equipment they need to build the weapons that in itself is a very strong warning to China.  
 
BOLDUAN: "The New York Times" is reporting this week on the target set for member nations to put two percent of their national economies toward their Armed Forces, that now 23 of the 32 meet that threshold now, yet "The Times" is reporting that there is a view amongst officials that that two percent is not going to be enough in the coming years. Do you think that's true? If so, what is going to be enough?  
 
STOLTENBERG: That's absolutely true. Two percent is not enough, but the good news is that we agreed two percent as a guideline 10 years ago and at that time, only three allies met the guideline of spending two percent of GDP on defense. Now, it is 23 and those allies that are not yet at two percent, they have clear plans in place to be there soon.  
 
But then, we have also now agreed that we have adjusted the guidelines. It is not two percent, that is a crime of ceiling we should strive towards, which was the language 10 years ago. Now, we have a good at two percent is the minimum and more and more allies exceeds the two percent quite significantly.  Several allies are now spending a larger proportion of their GDP on
 
 defense than the United States -- Poland, the Baltic countries, and others and therefore, we welcome the increase beyond two percent. We also agreed in NATO what we call capability targets, specific weapon systems readiness that different allies should deliver.  
 
And for most allies, it will cost more than two percent of GDP to deliver agreed capability targets that each and every ally has.  
 
BOLDUAN: You have been with President Biden for several days now in Washington, you also were with him just -- you've been with them many times, actually, in recent months, you were with him just before the CNN debate that sparked all of the recent concerns over his age and abilities.  
 
What do you see in President Biden? Do you see him faltering? Do you see him slowing down? What do you see?  
 
STOLTENBERG: NATO is the most successful alliance in history, because we have stayed out of domestic politics, because we have stayed out of partisan discussions.  
 <br>[08:20:10]  
 
Because we have different leaders, we have different elections going on across the lines all the time and therefore, I will just make sure that I and NATO, we are not part of this domestic US debate.  
 
But what I can say is that US leadership in this alliance has enabled NATO to make very important decisions at this Summit on the terms and events, on fair burden-sharing within the alliance, on a substantial package for Ukraine within the NATO command for Ukraine for a long- term financial pledge for Ukraine, and also to step up our cooperation with our Asia Pacific partners, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, and Australia, and now to at least address the challenges that China is now posing to our security.  
 
These are the things that matters for NATO, and we have been able to make these decisions over the last couple of days here in Washington.  
 
BOLDUAN: You talk about cooperation, which obviously is critical to NATO.  
 
POLITICO is reporting that Donald Trump is considering a reduction in cooperation, a reduction in intelligence sharing with members of NATO again, if he would win the elections as Trump advisers have told allied countries that reduced intel-sharing would be part of a broader plan to scale back US support and cooperation with the 32-nation alliance according to three European officials and senior NATO officials. What would that do if that happens?  
 
STOLTENBERG: I expect the United States to remain a strong and committed NATO ally also in the future, because it is in the United States' security interest to have a strong NATO. In NATO, the US has something, Russia and China doesn't have at all and that is more than 30 friends and allies.  The US is big. Europe is 25 percent of the world economy, but together
 
 with NATO allies, we are 50 percent, twice as much of the world economy and 50 percent of the military might. So it is good for NATO -- for the United States to have a strong NATO.  
 
Second, there is strong bipartisan support for NATO in the US Congress, in the US public. We have just seen new opinion polls confirming that.  
 
And thirdly, the main criticism from former President Trump has been about -- has actually not been against NATO. It has been against NATO allies not spending enough on NATO, and that has changed. The criticism has been valid and European allies have reacted by significantly investing more in defense.  
 
So I am confident that you US will remain a strong ally because it is in the interest of the United States.  
 
BOLDUAN: Secretary General, it is always great to have you. I know your term is up in October. Hopefully, we will have a chance to speak before then, but if not, thank you so much.  
 
STOLTENBERG: Thank you so much for having me.  
 
BOLDUAN: Thank you.  
 
Coming up for us, deep fakes are getting way too believable. A chilling new warning coming out of the threat of artificial intelligence and its potential influence on this election, the upcoming election and future.  
 
And talk about a communications breakdown. The growing tension between the Biden administration and the White House press corps.  
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  
 
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Guys, hold on a second. There is no reason to get back -- and go back and forth with me in this aggressive way.  
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)  
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  
 <br>[08:27:30]  
 
SARA SIDNER, CNN ANCHOR: US intelligence officials are sharing fears of bad actors who could try to influence the election results. One of their main tools this election year, AI, and it is only getting more convincing.  
 
Here is an example. Our own Kaitlan Collins spoke with the Arizona Secretary of State, Adrian Fontes last month. That you're seeing there is the real Adrian Fontes.  
 
But look at this --  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  
 
AI ADRIAN FONTES: Hello. This is a public service advisory featuring an AI version of Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes.  
 
It was created with both the consent and cooperation of the real Secretary Fontes, which again is not me. I am an AI impersonation of him.  
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)  
 
SIDNER: That is freaky.  
 
With us now is Chris Krebs, chief public policy officer with SentinelOne and former senior official with the Department of Homeland Security.  
 
You know, we've always said this thing is like, oh, I'll believe it when I see it. You can't believe your eyes. How much do you think this AI is going to play a role, not just in this election, but in elections to come?  
 
CHRISTOPHER KREBS, FORMER UNITED STATES DIRECTOR OF THE CYBERSECURITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY AGENCY: Well, this is not a theoretical just as you saw with the video from Secretary Fontes.  
 
Earlier, this week, the Department of Justice announced that they had disrupted an AI botnet, which is a massive network of AI-powered new sites controlled by RT, Russia Today, a state controlled media outlet. Over 968 accounts on X, formerly Twitter were a part of this network. So this is real, this is happening today.  
 
We've also seen it in Moldova, Slovakia, Bangladesh. AI is a risk to elections and we need election officials to continue to prepare for these and other risks.  
 
SIDNER: It is interesting because it used to be that you know, the sort of spies would try to fool other spies, but the general public was left out of it to some degree.  
 
Now with the internet and now with AI, we are in a whole new world. Is there anything that the public can do to try to keep themselves from being duped or is this really on for example, the social media companies, which is where a lot of this stuff gets shared to warn the public on each of the post what is real and what is not?  
 
KREBS: Well, its cliche, but this is a whole of society effort to push back, counter, and not be taken up and duped by these AI threats.  
 
As a part of a recent exercise that the state of Arizona and the Brennan Center led, they discovered that its critical to have rapid communications capabilities, strategic communications, and relationships with the media between election officials and those media folks. So you can get out and say, hey, this is real, this is not real.  But from an average user perspective, I think it goes back to
 
 everything we've been saying for years and years is don't believe everything you read on the internet. Take a breath. Go look to the authoritative sources of information with elections. That's your local election official. That's your state election official.  
 
It is not some random dude on social media.
