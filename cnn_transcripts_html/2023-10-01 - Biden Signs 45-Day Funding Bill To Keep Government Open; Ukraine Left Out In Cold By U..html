UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Live from CNN Center. This is CNN NEWSROOM with Michael Holmes. 
 
MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: And welcome to our viewers here in the United States and all around the world. I'm Michael Holmes at the CNN Center in Atlanta, appreciate your company. Now with just hours to spare the U.S. Senate late on Saturday averted a government shutdown by a vote of 88 to nine senators passed the House bill that will keep money flowing for another 45 days.
 
The White House sent out a photograph. You see it there President Biden signing the short term measure into law shortly before the midnight deadline. 
 
Now the deal came together with surprising speed in the end with U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy abruptly changing course and asking Democrats for help. The result was a resounding bipartisan passage of a short term bill. 
 
But many lawmakers on both sides are very unhappy that the final bill did not contain additional U.S. aid for Ukraine, especially at such a critical moment in the war. Still, Senate leaders were relieved to have brought this showdown to an end for now.

CHUCK SCHUMER, U.S. SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: It's been a day full of twists and turns, but the American people can breathe a sigh of relief, there will be no government shutdown. Democrats have said from the start that the only solution for avoiding a shutdown is bipartisanship. And we're glad that Speaker McCarthy has finally heated our message. In the end, more Democrats supported this bill in the House than Republicans proving bipartisanship was the best answer all along.
 
MITCH MCCONNELL, U.S. SENATE MINORITY LEADER: Passing this measure. keeping the lights on will allow us to return our country to making headway on full year appropriations our colleagues have been working on literally for months, and it will give us the flexibility to meet urgent supplemental priorities both at home and abroad. Therefore, I would urge our colleagues to join me in supporting this important step in the right direction.

HOLMES: CNN's Manu Raju takes a look now at how the last minute deal unfolded.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): So after a chaotic day and feeders have shut down, gripped Washington for weeks, Congress gave final approval on a bill to keep the government open for 45 more days. This after speaker McCarthy change plans reversed course and relied on Democratic votes to get this bill out of the U.S. House.
 
For some time the Speaker McCarthy had wanted to just pass a bill along Republican lines, just get Republicans on board, but he struggled amid opposition from a handful of conservative hardliners who refuse to give him the votes. 
 
Also, those same hardliners warned that if he decided to work with Democrats that could cost him his job as speaker. At the end of the day, after a meeting on Saturday with his conference, McCarthy decided to roll the dice, go take on these hardliners directly and tried to keep the government open with Democratic support, that happened they passed a bill out of the House that had overwhelming support bipartisan support, half of -- more than half of the House Republican Conference voted for it. All but one Democratic House member voted for it as well.
 
Now, that I moved over to the United States Senate where the Senate approved it overwhelmingly 88 to nine vote, nine Republican senators voted against it. But didn't come without some controversy, namely, the decision by Speaker McCarthy to not include Ukraine aid in this final package. 
 
The White House had pushed for $24 billion in Ukraine aid to be approved this year. But the Senate was trying to approve as part of the bill to keep the government open $6.2 billion of that package. McCarthy had a different idea of because of opposition within the conservative ranks of his conference and divisions within the House GOP. 
 
McCarthy decided to not include Ukraine aid as part of this package, leaving open the question, can Congress get behind and give approval to Ukraine at this critical time in its war against Russia? It is unclear if that will happen. But that will be a major point of contention when Congress resumes and deals with this funding issue again in 45 days.
 <br>[02:05:00]
 
This all comes as there is still a threat to McCarthy speakership A number of members expressed their dissatisfaction with his handling of the talks.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think it's shameful in many, many ways. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We cannot continue to kick this can down the road.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm disappointed. I wish would fall. We just didn't fight.
 
LAUREN BOEBERT, U.S. HOUSE REPUBLICAN: We should have forced them to come to the negotiating table and come to conference and hash out our differences.
 
RAJU: Now, none of those members though, said that they would actually vote to oust Speaker McCarthy. I asked every single one of them if they're ready to do that they would not go there, raising questions about whether the effort to push them out will succeed. Matt Gaetz, the ringleader of that effort, has not said explicitly, he will file a vote to push McCarthy out of the speakership. But this is a threat that has been over the speaker for some time. And when I asked the speaker about this earlier today, he said, bring it on. Mana Raju, CNN, Capitol Hill.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HOLMES: Joining me now from Avalon, New Jersey is Charlie Dent former Republican representative from Pennsylvania. Good to see you, sir. What do you make of how the day unfolded? And where did the events were the last week or so leave Kevin McCarthy in terms of job security?
 
CHARLIE DENT, FORMER U.S. HOUSE REPUBLICAN: Well, it seems to me that this ended pretty much how I thought it would, specifically that there would there would be a bipartisan bill leans continuing resolution or stopgap measure this and disaster funding, they kicked the can on Ukraine funding. 
 
But there will be a bipartisan outcome. And I always felt that if they had a bill like this, they get 300 votes in the House to get 335. And the Senate pretty much accepted it as is. So I'm not surprised this happened. Obviously McCarthy was under tremendous pressure. He was under tremendous pressure from his right flank not to engage in a bipartisan solution. But he did the right thing here. 
 
And I think that the, you know, Hakeem Jeffries was there as expected to provide a lot of votes and support. And so this is a good outcome. Now, that said, they're going to have to deal with Ukraine funding sometime between now and November the 15th or 17th, whenever this, this, this resolution expires, and they're going to have to negotiate the full appropriations bills all 12 of them for the for the next fiscal year. They're going to have to do all that. So we're not done with this problem yet. But at least this by some time.
 
HOLMES: And when you talk about, you know, that right flank. I mean, how has McCarthy's deal with the devil though those MAGA Republicans, I mean to just get the job of speaker. How has that impacted and how beholden is he to them? And how is it impacting how the business of running the government is going?
 
DENT: Well, his -- it seems that the speaker's modus operandi up to this point has been to appease that element, which has empowered them and embolden them. And I think what he has discovered, once again, that the more he gives them, the less he seems to get from them. 
 
So he gave them seats on the House Rules Committee, on the House Appropriations Committee, gave them an impeachment inquiry. And it didn't really translate into any help with these matters of governance, like funding the government or passing the debt ceiling. 
 
So he has to. So McCarthy needs to resort to bipartisanship, I think he has to marginalize those members that whatever that number is five to -- five to 15 or so of those hardliners, he's going to have to marginalize them. And the way he does that is by engaging in bipartisan deals with Hakeem Jeffries. That's the way out. 
 
Appeasement doesn't work, obviously. And I think the Speaker discovered this rather belatedly. And then, of course, he did the right thing by putting that bill on the floor earlier today.
 
HOLMES: And one of the one of the impacts of that right wing is that they're obviously determined to keep that funding for Ukraine out of the debate. You know, and that's despite most Republicans, not all but a clear majority being in favor of continued support for Ukraine in its war with Russia.
 
What are the risks of that minority getting its way on the issue of Russia? But you know, more generally, as well, I mean, Putin would be delighted by how they've been behaving on Ukraine.
 
DENT: Well, sure. And again, I think you're correct. There are strong bipartisan majorities in both chambers to support Ukrainian war effort. And you know, where I come from, we used to have votes on matters like this. We, you know, let them let the majority prevail here. 
 
If, you know, it's absurd that a small minority thinks it can dictate its own policy demands on the overwhelming majority of the Congress. Well, have the vote. You know, run them over politically on this and they're not going to win. 
 <br>[02:10:00]
 
So I think right now it's up to McCarthy to, you know, just allow the House and the whole Congress really to work its will on that issue. And if left to their own devices, it seems that Congress will indeed fund the Ukrainian war effort further.
 
HOLMES: They the historian, Timothy Snyder, he's been tweeting a lot about this. And he knows a lot about this, too. I'll just read one of his tweets. He said supporting Ukraine is a once in a generation chance to make the world safer ending that support is recklessness, for which we will all suffer in all the conflicts that the Ukrainians are preventing or making less likely. Let us help those who help us. A fair comment and how does it look to the rest of the world? I mean, Putin obviously loves it if there's arguments over funding Ukraine, but it doesn't make the U.S. look good on the international stage, doesn't it?
 
DENT: No, it doesn't. And clearly, investing in Ukraine's defense is good for the West. It's good for democracies throughout Europe. The Ukrainians are doing a magnificent job degrading Russia's military capacities, also making it much less likely that Russia could somehow enter into a NATO country, say in the Baltic states, or Poland. 
 
So Ukrainians are doing a tremendous service that to mankind and certainly to democracies and doing an enormous amount of damage to the Russian military. And by the way, Russia under Putin, their foreign policy objective seems to be to undermine American power and influence wherever they can. Well, OK, well, right back at him. 
 
And the Ukrainians, you know, again, no Americans are dying in Ukraine. I mean, Ukrainians are motivated. They're taking up this fight in their own this is a very good investment, in my view, very good investment of American tax dollars, to help us make this world a better and safer place. 
 
HOLMES: I really appreciate you staying up late to talk about all of this with us, Charlie Dent. Thank you so much. 
 
DENT: Thank you. 
 
HOLMES: As we were discussing Ukraine did get the short end of the stick in the congressional compromise bill. The Senate was originally considering more than $6 billion in new aid for Kyiv but in the end, the money for Ukraine was entirely left out of the stopgap measure mainly because of that opposition from that small group of conservatives on the right. 
 
The move reflected a political reality though in the U.S. were according to a CNN poll in July 55 percent of voters said they oppose sending more aid to Ukraine. But Senate Democrats say they will still keep pushing for more aid. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer says when it comes to Ukraine, the two top Senate leaders are on the same page.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SCHUMER: Leader McConnell and I have agreed to continue fighting for more economic and security aid for Ukraine. We support Ukraine's efforts to defend its sovereignty against Putin's aggression. So thank you. Thank you, to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their excellent work. The bipartisanship here in the Senate, set the tone for today's result, and I hope it sets the tone for the future.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HOLMES: One Ukrainian lawmaker says she wants to hold us Congress members like Schumer to their word. Parliament Member Kira Rudik spoke to CNN just a short time ago.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KIRA RUDIK, UKRAINIAN PARLIAMENT MEMBER: I would like to concentrate on the good thing. And it is that there are so much more voices that say we will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes. We will continue to support Ukraine for as much as needed. And we know that this is our mutual fight, fight for democratic values. 
 
We know that we value bipartisan support, and we have so many friends in U.S. Congress that are standing with us and that are fighting for our cause in the way that they can. 
 
You know, today in the morning, I read the news and then use that Ukrainian newsmakers are showing is how many people are showing the support for Ukraine, including President Biden, that in his statement after the shutdown was admitted, said that support for Ukraine cannot go uninterrupted.
 
In statements of Kevin McCarthy and so many other people who said yes, we have this short term solution right now. But what it means is that the current support for Ukraine will continue because there will be people to operate it and we will work on making sure there would be another budget another delivery. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HOLMES: That is Kira Rudik, a member of the Ukrainian parliament speaking with us earlier. 
 
Now while Ukraine missed out on some additional U.S. aid, for now it plans to put more of its own money into weapons production.
 <br>[02:15:06]
 
Kyiv says its spending on arms mate making will increase seven fold next year. Ukraine also hosted an international forum on Saturday to pitch itself as a future hub for manufacturing. But as CNN's Fred Pleitgen now report through U.S. support remains crucial for Ukraine's war effort.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Well, the Ukrainians certainly are aware of some of the skepticism in the United States about funding for Ukraine, especially as far as weapons are concerned. But also, of course, as far as money is concerned, as well among congressional Republicans, and also, of course, among the U.S. public. 
 
Now, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the president of the country was of course recently in the United States, and he was asking for more weapons because the Ukrainians understand that if they're going to stay in the fight against the Russians and make headway against the Russians, they are going to need a lot more weapons. 
 
Now, there's some items that the Ukrainians have said in the future will be absolutely key to them. Like for instance, attacking missiles is definitely something that they want. And of course, in the future, also F-16 is to essentially rebuild their air force, according to NATO standard. They also think those jets are a lot more capable than the ones that they're flying right now. 
 
But in the short term, Ukrainian say, it really is ammunition that they need, and they certainly need a lot of and one of the interesting things that Volodymyr Zelenskyy made a point of doing is saying, look, there has been some talk about possible corruption within the defense ministry here in Ukraine. He said nothing had to do that, had to do with weapons that were provided by the United States. 
 
And one of the things, of course, that he also did is he replaced his defense minister pretty much right before coming to the U.S. and took that new defense minister to the United States to reassure the U.S. that if it gives weapons and when it gives weapons to Ukraine, that would be a transparent process. 
 
The Ukrainians fully understand that without further weapons from the United States, and also its partners, they're going to have a very difficult time sustaining some of the high level operations that they're conducting right now. Fred Pleitgen, CNN in eastern Ukraine.

HOLMES: Still to come on the program, a pro-Kremlin leader is heading for a win in Slovakia's crucial parliamentary elections. What does that mean for the war in Ukraine? We'll have a report coming up. Also much more on the new U.S. pending bill why funding for Ukraine was left out of it and what some lawmakers are planning to do about that.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HOLMES: The U.S. has averted a government shutdown for at least the next 45 days. Congress passing a stopgap measure on Saturday night with just hours to spare the bill will keep federal agencies running through mid-November. It will include natural disaster aid but not additional support for Ukraine. 
 
Hard right conservatives have been leery about continuing to fund gives war as it fights off Russian invaders.
 <br>[02:20:02]
 
But many U.S. lawmakers say they will try to approve another funding bill for Ukraine at a later date because the stakes are so high.
 
In Slovakia, a party headed by a pro Kremlin leader is headed for a win in Saturday's parliamentary election. Preliminary results so former Prime Minister Robert Fico's party has won more than 23 percent of the vote, while a significant number -- while a significant number Fico will need a coalition partner to form the government. 
 
For more let's go to CNN Scott McLean. Live in London. Was interesting, Scott, two vastly different candidates polar opposite to be neck and neck for a while a progressive candidate, and one who wants to cut off aid to Ukraine and it's not looking good for Ukraine is it?
 
SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: No, it sure is not Robert Fico is a man who has blamed Ukrainian Nazis and fascists in his words for provoking Russia into war. And under the current government, I guess, soon to be previous government. Slovakia has been a very strong supporter of Ukraine, sending helicopters, artillery systems, air defense systems, you name it. Under Robert Fico, well it is likely that it won't go away right away, because as you pointed out, he will need a coalition government. 
 
If you look at the results that we have so far, the vast majority of the polls now reporting Fico's government has or Fico's party one just over 23 percent of the vote. So nowhere close to getting the majority that he would need to govern on his own. He will need to pair up with another party. 
 
He has not ruled out despite his party being a left wing party. He has not ruled out pairing up with the Republic Party. But you can see there -- them there at the bottom with 4.8 percent. They actually missed out on the threshold of 5 percent to get seats in parliament. 
 
The Republic Party shares his view on Ukraine and Russia. So that's no longer an option. The other parties have much more moderate views. His most likely coalition partner is the third one you see there, the Hlas Party, that's actually an offshoot of his own SMER Party. They've been more vague on the Ukraine issue. What the leader has said, is that on one hand, Slovakia has given all that it can afford to give Ukraine at this point. 
 
On the other hand, Slovakia is a ammunition manufacturer. And so from a practical standpoint, they think that they should continue to supply Ukraine with ammunition because at the end of the day, it's good for the economy. 
 
So Fico will need another moderating force in order to govern and he actually has a track record of being flexible, being pragmatic, in order to govern So, as I said, likely that aid to Ukraine not going to be cut off cold turkey. 
 
You also have to understand Michael, where some of this attitude or where some of these views or why these views are resonating in Slovakia right now. Fico has framed this as more of a peace initiative saying that sending weapons to Ukraine just prolongs a war that the Ukrainians can't actually win. 
 
The Slovakia is also dealing with rising costs of living inflation like much of Europe. They're also hosting some 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, all of this straining the public curse (ph). And so this message of getting this war over with sooner rather than later is undoubtedly an appealing one. In terms of what happens next, it'll likely take weeks for the negotiations on a coalition to take place before the dust finally settles. Michael.
 
HOLMES: Yes, it's interesting what you say about Slovak so the research has been showing that only about, I think it's 40 percent of Slovak think that Russia is responsible for the war in Ukraine which is pretty incredible given the evidence to the contrary. Where does that come from that pro-Russian sentiment?
 
MCLEAN: Yes. So it's perhaps a combination of things. Of course, there are some sort of Pan-Slovak solidarity at play here. You also have to understand that Slovakia also has a soft spot historically for Russia because it was actually the Russians in World War II that liberated Slovakia from the Nazis and so there is that.
 
You've also had political chaos in Slovakia over the last few years. You've had in fighting corruption scandals you name it, which is really weaken trust in government. So all of this makes for some fertile ground for the Russian viewpoint, Russian propaganda misinformation, perhaps disinformation to really take hold in this country. 
 
And what is especially interesting here is that Robert Fico himself was actually forced out of office by scandal back in 2018, how quickly people forget about that. This time around, he's branded his party. In fact, one of his campaign slogans is stability, order and social security. So a man who was forced out by scandal, some five years ago, now has managed to successfully rehabilitate his image and pitch himself as the stability candidate here, Michael.
 
HOLMES: Scott McLean there. Thanks for that. Scott McLean in London. Appreciate it.
 <br>[02:25:00]
 
Now, thousands of Israeli celebrated the start of the Sukkot holiday in the streets in massive protest against the government's plan judicial overhaul. Demonstrators carrying flags and a massive banner saying you shall not divide us. It is the 39th straight week of demonstrations against the far-right's legislative plans. 
 
In July, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition passed a law that strips the Supreme Court's right to block government decisions deemed unreasonable. Critics say the law disrupts the balance of power and is dangerous for Israel's democracy. 
 
Well, it took some wrangling but the U.S. House Speaker found enough support to pass a spending bill. We'll have a look at some of the compromises he made when we come back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:30:29]
 
HOLMES: Welcome back, you're watching CNN Newsroom with me Michael Holmes. A collective sigh of relief right now after Congress narrowly averted a government shutdown, which many were expecting until just a few hours ago. The breakthrough came earlier on Saturday when U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy gave up trying to appease the far right members of his caucus, instead turning to Democrats for help passing a stopgap measure. Here's what the Speaker had to say afterwards about the small group of Republicans who have given him so many headaches.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MCCARTHY: Do you have members in your conference that won't let you vote for appropriation bills, doesn't want an omnibus and won't vote for a stopgap measure, so the only answer is to shut down and not pay our troops? I don't want to be a part of that team. I want to be a part of a conservative group that wants to get things done.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HOLMES: Republican Congressman came back admits that 45 days isn't very long to pass the remaining spending bills, but he says it's doable. Have a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. KEN BUCK (R-CO): I don't think it's a bad thing to have bipartisan votes on some issues. I think the Democrats are going to join with moderate Republicans anytime we're talking about spending a huge amount of money. I think the Kevin McCarthy's problem, really is his lack of passing 12 bills on time, and then getting jammed at the last minute with this. 
 
We're going to see at least four appropriations bills in the next two weeks. Hopefully those pass at that point we'll have eight or nine of the 12 bills passed and that would be a real relief to a lot of us. This 45 days will come a lot quicker than people anticipate, and we'll be faced with another crisis.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HOLMES: Well, the White House might rest a little easier tonight avoiding that shutdown, a potential crisis averted at least for a little while. But CNN senior White House correspondent M.J. Lee tells us there are still questions that need addressing.
 
M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Just hours ahead of a midnight deadline for a government shutdown, President Biden signing into law a government funding bill that would fund the government for 45 days. The White House had made a deliberate decision some time ago to take a hands-off approach as the process unfolded on Capitol Hill. 
 
The messaging that we have been hearing from the White House over the last few days has really been this is the House Republicans problem to solve. They made a political calculation that if the government were to shut down at midnight, that House Republicans would end up shouldering much of that political blame.
 
Of course, there is a sigh of relief tonight here at the White House that a government shutdown has been averted. But there are two very big outstanding questions. First is how the government is going to potentially secure more funding for Ukraine. That has been a big priority for many Democrats and White House officials as well. 
 
And it's also just not clear whether or not a situation like this is again going to unfold exactly 45 days from now. But again, there is a huge sigh of relief that a government shutdown that the White House had been bracing for and had been preparing for has now been averted. CNN, M.J. Lee, the White House.
 
HOLMES: All right, let's get some more on what some of the longer term repercussions might be. Michael Genovese is a political analyst and author and president of the Global Policy Institute at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. Always good to see you, sir. So the Speaker relying on Democrats to get this crisis averted for now. What price might he pay with the so called MAGA wing of the party, less than happy that he got those Democrats involved?
 
MICHAEL GENOVESE, POLITICAL ANALYST &amp; AUTHOR: That's right. The deal will come at a cost. I think the cost is just around the corner. He had to deal with the Democrats, bring them into the tent and make a deal. The hostage taking that was so obvious and so powerful by the far right wing and Republican Party, holding McCarthy and Republican Party's hostage to their demands. Finally, just there's too much and McCarthy finally had to buckle in and cave in and get into the Democrats and make a deal with them.
 
He was forced to abandon his own right wing party, but I don't think he broke their back. I think that Children's Crusade is going to go on and they may seek the revenge very quickly and the revenge would be in the process I think of challenging him for the speakership so that would be I think the next and most immediate phase of this soap opera.
 <br>[02:35:13]
 
HOLMES: You know, it's interesting when you look at the implication and how the rest of the world looks in at the chaos, really, that has overtaken government in many ways. I mean, there was nearly a default on the debt recently, the whole, you know, shutting down the government seems to happen every few months. Moody's is the last major ratings agency to rate the government, AAA with a stable outlook. 
 
But it said that, if there had been a shutdown, it would hurt that credit rating, then you got features already downgraded the U.S. to AA plus after the last flirtation with the shutdown? What are what is the real world cost to America's reputation in the global economy of this happening, not as this time, but over and over again?
 
GENOVESE: Yes. Is this any way for the world's superpower to behave?
 
HOLMES: Yes.
 
GENOVESE: It sends a very bad message, we've always had kind of dysfunctional process where budgeting is concerned. And then normal politics, we have a lot of deadlock and a lot of compromises required. But we're seeing real dysfunction. We're seeing the hyper partisanship, getting uglier and uglier. And you saw the name calling. 
 
The funnier part is that the name calling was really done by a lot of the moderate Republicans against the right wing Republicans. But it sends a terrible message to the world at a time when democracy is being challenged across the globe. And China is rising when Russia is asserting itself. We need to with the Europeans, be strong on democracy and show that it can work. This doesn't send that message. HOLMES: Yes, yes. Well put. And speaking of Russia, when it comes to Ukraine and funding to support Ukraine being stripped away to get this over the line, why do you think there is growing disdain for supporting Ukraine on the right flank of the Republican Party, when not supporting Ukraine is not only a threat to Europe that plays directly into, you know, Vladimir Putin's hands?
 
GENOVESE: Well, I think there are a couple of reasons. One, money. Two, there are a number of Republicans on the far right, who admire Putin and find him to be the kind of leader they admire Putin and leaders of Hungary and Poland, who are strong men, illiberal leaders, they like that, and so they want to support that and Ukraine is standing in the way.
 
On the other hand, it is absolutely essential for the West to support Ukraine. The West has to come together a lot of Americans though, say it's too much money, we don't want to go that far. We've already spent enough. You don't, you can never spend enough on security, period.
 
HOLMES: Yes, yes. And then, you know, if you stopped spending, what's going to be the result of that. We've seen -- going back to the sort of MAGA wing, we've seen the power of that small bit extreme group dictating what's happened in the house telling McCarthy what to do. In the Senate, you've got a situation where one senator can gum up the works, as we have seen. What needs to change to grease the wheels of governance for, you know, heaven forbid, the good of the people?
 
GENOVESE: Well, we could go to a two year budget instead of a one year budget. That would mean that we would prolong the process, give you a little bit of more time. And I think two years, you could do a good budget in two years. But I think it goes much deeper than those kinds of quick fixes. 
 
And you know, that's more of a political comb over. What we really need is to have a society that has a consensus that reaches an agreement that believes in the old American ideals. We are now a very divided country where a number of people don't support American democracy, a number of people within the political party and the right. 
 
And so we need to get a consensus around what democracy is, what the cost of democracy are and what the benefits are. We need to have that national debate. Joe Biden started it a bit. But I think that's a nationwide debate that has to go on and that's what's going to help us.
 
HOLMES: Great analysis as always. Michael Genovese always good to see you. Thank you so much.
 
GENOVESE: Thank you, Michael.
 
HOLMES: All right quick break here on the program. When we come back, the New York City and surrounding areas drying out after record flooding we'll have more on the day after and why New York's governor says her state is bracing for more of this.
 <br>[02:39:29]
 
Also the U.S. hasn't seen the last of extreme heat for the year we'll go to the CNN weather center for a look at the week ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HOLMES: Welcome back. President Joe Biden has signed into law a short term spending bill to keep the U.S. government running for another 45 days. Congress passing the measure Saturday night just hours before federal agencies were set to shut down. In the House, 90 Republicans voted against it and so did a single Democrat Mike Quigley. Earlier he spoke with CNN about the lack of unity in Congress.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. MIKE QUIGLEY (D-IL): I saw people patting each other on the back and clapping and saying this was a bipartisan victory. Let's look at the record recently. We came within an inch of defaulting on our debt. We just now came within inches of a shutdown. This is not how the most important democracy in the world should function. Our dysfunction, our inability to govern is a national security threat beyond all the other reasons we shouldn't shutdown. It's a scary time.

HOLMES: Now the stopgap spending bill includes more aid for natural disasters but not for Ukraine. Lawmakers say they will try to approve a separate funding bill to help give at a later date.
 
Now, a day after historic flooding in New York City, the region is beginning to dry out. Friday storm dropped the most rain ever recorded at JFK Airport. A state of emergency is still in effect will be for the next six days. And some flood warnings still in effect as well. New York Governor Kathy Hochul says that unfortunately extreme weather events like this will be happening more and more.

GOV. KATHY HOCHUL (D-NY): And of course, we know this is a result of climate change. This is unfortunately what we have to expect as the new normal. It makes us be more prepared than ever before. And it requires us to focus on resiliency to head off the horrific impacts that could be there for not ready for the next storm. 
 
This was the kind of rain that was once unimaginable to call them once in a century storms. But as the third time since I was sworn in two years ago, I've had a once in a century storm. This includes the historic flooding we had in the Hudson Valley this summer, which was deemed a 1,000 year flooding event.

HOLMES: Governor Hochul says no deaths have been reported from this latest storm. Well, the calendar may say October now but parts of the U.S. will see record high temperatures until at least midweek. As meteorologist Allison Chinchar shows us there is a change coming after that.
 
ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST: In total, more than 30 potential records could be tied or broken starting Sunday, all the way through Wednesday of this week. And you'll notice it's several different regions of the U.S. that are looking at those potential records. Now for some portions of the central U.S. those records actually began on Saturday including the area around Brownsville, Texas, which means they could end up breaking records three or even four days in a row before we finally start to see those temperatures dropping back down towards normal.
 
Take for example Sioux Falls, going from a high on Sunday of 93 degrees back down to only 76 on Tuesday. Keeping in mind however that that 76 is still actually above normal for this time of year just not quite as extreme as the high temperature will be on Sunday. Another location looking at that big drop, St. Louis going from a high of 91 on Sunday down to the low 80s Thursday before dropping back below average into the low to mid 70s once we finish out the rest of this week.
 
Farther down to the South Dallas also looking at several more hot days looking at highs in the mid-90s once all the way through Tuesday of the upcoming week before finally dropping back into the 80s by the end of the week and possibly down even into the low 70s once we get some rain back into the forecast next weekend.
 
Now this heat is going to stick around it's just going to start to shift as we head into the latter portion of the upcoming week. So you'll notice it starts to recede from the central U.S. really starting to focus more across the Northeast in the mid-Atlantic as cooler air begins to push into the central U.S. by Wednesday and Thursday of this week. 
 
That means into the Northeast. Those temperatures are actually going to be warming looking at already going from 78 on Sunday back into the mid-80s by Tuesday. Similar scenario for Boston going from 73 on Sunday up to the 80s once we get to the middle portion of this week.
 
HOLMES: Allison Chinchar there for us.
 
Now people are being allowed to return home in Illinois after a deadly crash involving a vehicle carrying thousands of gallons of ammonia. Five people were killed when the semi-truck crashed into a village a couple of 100 miles south of Chicago. Hundreds of residents were forced to flee. The fire department says testing indicates the danger now from the ammonia has dissipated.
 
Still to come, it is down to the final round in Rome for golf's Ryder Cup. We'll have the latest on that. The Americans rallied on Saturday against the Europeans but it will take an enormous effort for the U.S. to keep the trophy.
 <br>[02:49:32] Plus, wherever you are in the world, you might want to pop over to the U.S. this weekend or this week. No winner in the Powerball drawing here. What's the new jackpot? Be prepared to be stunned. We'll have that after the break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HOLMES: U.S. lawmakers have avoided a government shutdown at least for another 45 days as we've been reporting. Just hours ago the Senate passing a stopgap spending bill to keep the government's doors open until November 17. For now millions of government employees and active military members will continue getting paid. President Biden Swain signing the bill into law pretty quickly after it was passed. 
 
He blames the near shutdown squarely on hardline congressional Republicans saying they created a manufactured crisis by walking away from an earlier budget agreement that they'd signed on to and demanding drastic cuts that were not agreed to in that deal.
 
Now, Rory McIlroy and other members of team Europe confronted an American caddy as tempers flared on the greens of the Ryder Cup in Rome on Saturday. At this point, it's going to take a historic comeback for the Americans to retain the coveted golf trophy as the tournament heads into its final day. Here's Patrick Snell with a look at Saturday's action.
 
PATRICK SNELL, CNN WORLD SPORT ANCHOR: Well, America's golfers really have the proverbial mountain to climb, if they have any chance at all of holding on to their title. Europe now just four appoints away from winning back one of the most prestigious titles there is when it comes to international team sports. And all of this, amid plenty of drama and rising tensions too, between the two sides late in the day on Saturday.
 
Europe also winning three of the four morning alternate shot foursomes, as Viktor Hovland and the Swedish rookie Ludvig Aberg powering their way to a record Ryder Cup victory, one that left the world number one player, Scottie Scheffler, literally in tears afterwards. Afterwards Scheffler and Brooks Koepka beaten nine and seven.
 
But in the afternoon, better format, the Americans at least starting to make a fight of it and a real statement victory from Sam Burns and Collin Morikawa who were both in superb form to record an empathic four and three victory against Hovland and Aberg who get a taste of their own medicine. 
 
And Burns dishing it out to the crowd as well. But in the last match of the day, partner with Wyndham Clark, U.S. star Patrick Cantlay not wearing a cap he says simply because it doesn't fit, making the 350- footer on 18 to win it for the Americans against Rory McIlroy and Matt Fitzpatrick.
 
But as the U.S. celebrated a really important point, McIlroy apparently incensed by the actions of Cantlay's caddie, Joe LaCava who was very slow to clear the green, McIlroy at one point confronting LaCava, other European players as well like Justin Rose and Shane Lowry also confronting the caddie. And then with play over for the day, McIlroy with frustrations again boiling over involved in another incident, this one in the car park. The Northern Irishman eventually being ushered away by Lowry.
 
While Europe have a 10.5 to 5.5 points lead and no team has ever come back from five back to win it in the competition's near 100-year history. Twice over the years, teams have come back from four points, famously in 1999, the USA say emerging victorious at Brookline. Then in 2012, we witnessed the miracle at Medinah when Europe triumphed just outside of Chicago.
 <br>[02:55:09]
 
Well, as I mentioned earlier, Patrick Cantlay, the only one of the 24 players not wearing a team cap. Social media went wild with talk of USA disunity, which skipper Zach Johnson vehemently dismissed and that Cantlay was protesting because Ryder Cup players are not paid. That, too, completely dismissed by the player himself.
 
PATRICK CANTLAY, U.S. RYDER CUP TEAM MEMBER: Not at all. I mean, I -- this is first I've heard of it right when I got off the green. I mean, that's the furthest thing from the truth.
 
SNELL: Patrick Cantlay speaking out there. And with that, it is right back to you.
 
HOLMES: Patrick Snell, thank you so much.
 
And finally, the Powerball jackpot in the U.S. has soared after no winner in Saturday night's drawing. The lotteries website now says that the prize is going to be a stunning $1.4 billion seems a bit excessive, doesn't it. Those opting to take that jackpot in a lump sum as I would get 470 million in cash but then that's before taxes, so it's hardly worth it is it?
 
It's the second largest jackpot of the year. Although no one's scored the top prize Saturday, there were more than 2 million winning tickets at lesser values. The next drawing is Monday. So hurry up, get over here and buy one. Not worth it after tax.
