MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR: I'll take you to Berlin, live images. U.S. President Joe Biden arriving to meet Germany's President and Chancellor and to receive one of Germany's top honors too as he leaves the White House soon.
 
Later they'll be joined by the French and British leaders. The agenda expected to feature discussions on the path to a ceasefire in Lebanon, a resolution to the of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza as well, particularly after the death of the leader of Hamas. 
 
The leaders are also expected to discuss how to put Kyiv in the strongest position possible, going into the Ukraine Defense Contact Group.
 
Officials getting ahead of things there. That's a gathering of 57 countries supporting Ukraine's military efforts that meets every few months. We'll bring you any headlines that come out of the meeting but we are currently awaiting the President to leave the car. You can see they're lined up there but the German President will need to be there to greet him as well. So they'll be getting into position as well and then the U.S. President. 
 
But as I say there are key meetings later on today particularly between Germany, France, U.K. and the U.S. who are allied with their efforts in relation to Ukraine and the Middle East.
 
Now officials and experts are now analyzing what may come next of Hamas after the death of its leader Yahya Sinwar. Senior Israeli officials say Sinwar's brother, if he survived this week, could continue the group's hardline negotiating contacts -- tactics rather. U.S. officials are optimistic that President Joe Biden and Israel's Prime Minister are more closely aligned on a diplomatic resolution after Sinwar's death.
 
And more now from CNN's Nic Robertson.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over): Once dubbed by the IDF a dead man walking, the IDF says these are Yahya Sinwar's final moments recorded by a drone in the Gaza house where he died. According to the IDF he was discovered during a routine patrol, the building hit by tank fire, his body spotted in the rubble.
 
YOAV GALLANT, ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER (through translator):Sinwar died while being persecuted and on the run. He didn't die as a commander but as someone who only cared for himself.
 
ROBERTSON (voice-over): In life Sinwar had cultivated a tough image, feared and fetid at home in Gaza, universally reviled by Israelis, vilified for his leading role in Hamas's brutal October 7th slaughter of at least 1,200 people in Israel. Journalist Ehud Yaari was one of the few Israelis who met him.
 
EHUD YAARI, ISRAELI JOURNALIST: When I was talking to him, he always insisted that we speak Hebrew and not Arabic.
 
ROBERTSON (voice-over): Yaari interviewed Sinwar four times while the terror leader was in jail, convicted of playing a role in the killing of two Israelis and four suspected Palestinian informers.
 
YAARI: He was ruthless, he used to send people to kill those prisoners whom he suspected of passing information to the intelligence of the prison service.
 <br>[04:35:00]
 
ROBERTSON (voice-over): Born in a Gaza refugee camp to parents who fled their home in what is now Israel in 1948, following the Jewish state's creation, Sinwar's cause was to reverse those land losses. 
 
Hamas was the vehicle to do it. He rose through its ranks as an enforcer, becoming Gaza leader in 2017, his message uncompromising.
 
During fighting in 2021, the IDF bombed his house. A week later at a rare press conference, he goaded the IDF to take a second shot, saying he would walk home, his luck finally running out now. 
 
In Israel, people are celebrating, the prime minister warning them it may be premature, the fight with Hamas not done, offering them survival or be chased down like Sinwar.
 
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAEL PRIME MINISTER (through translator): I call on everyone who holds our hostages, whoever lays down his weapon and returns our hostages, we will allow him to go out and live.
 
ROBERTSON (voice-over): Hostage families again, calling for Netanyahu to get their loved ones home at any price. 
 
Sinwar may be dead, but the politics of both sides hasn't changed. It's far from clear Hamas will listen to Netanyahu, and far from clear Netanyahu will see to U.S. wishes, make this the moment to end the Gaza war. 
 
Nic Robinson, CNN, London.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE) FOSTER: Hezbollah is announcing what it calls a new and escalating phase in its war with Israel, the Iran-backed militant group in Lebanon says the change will happen in the coming days. Hezbollah's statement does not mention Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, or its own leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed last month in an Israeli airstrike. 
 
But it raises the question of how Sinwar's death will impact the growing crisis in the Middle East. In Gaza, where an Israeli airstrike on a shelter in Gaza killed at least 28 Palestinians and wounded dozens of others, some say it won't change much.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Assassinating Sinwar will not end the war, and Israel continues its approach of assassinations and killing since we came into this world. It has been assassinating the Palestinian leadership since this day, and it continues its agenda of assassination, destruction and displacement, and assassinating Sinwar will not end the war.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: Well, it's estimated at least 1,700 people have been killed in Lebanon since Israel stepped up its military operations against Hezbollah, with more than 9,000 others wounded. Joining me now from Paris is Maha Yahya, director of the Carnegie Middle East Center. Thank you so much for joining us.
 
So we are hearing from Hezbollah. They have a new and escalating phase, but they've been so debilitated, haven't they, by the Israeli operation. I'm wondering what resources and leadership they've got in place to be able to do that.
 
MAHA YAHYA, DIRECTOR, CARNEGIE MIDDLE EAST CENTER: Good morning, Max. Thank you for having me. 
 
Look, they seem to still be operating. I think they have a level of decentralization on the battlefield. So they've continued to carry out operations, from what we can tell. It's very clear that the Iranians have stepped in directly to support the whatever is left of the leadership in Beirut on the ground.
 
But they do still have the resources, and they are continuing to carry out military operations, as well as, in Lebanon, trying to also care for those displaced within their own constituency.
 
FOSTER: In terms of how Sinwar's death plays into Hezbollah's thinking, does that motivate them or demotivate them?
 
YAHYA: I don't think either. I mean, Hassan Nasrallah, the secretary general's death, Hassan Nasrallah, was far more significant for Hezbollah than the killing of yesterday, last night, of Sinwar. So the more significant, if you want, loss is in the figure of their own secretary general. So I think they'll wait and see what's going to happen in Gaza. We heard the head of the parliament, the Iranian parliament, coming out today and saying, we're happy to negotiate a ceasefire on behalf of Lebanon. And the prime minister has responded saying, no, thank you.
 
But the bottom line is, it's going to be Iran that's going to be sitting around the table, negotiating something, both in Gaza, or having an influence on what happens in Gaza, as well as in Lebanon.
 <br>[04:40:00]
 
FOSTER: Meetings ongoing, as we understand it, in Israel about possible retaliation against Iran. Obviously, they're not going to give anything away. But what do you think is the most likely plan with that?
 
YAHYA: Well, I suspect they're going to go after the military installations, mainly probably drone manufacturing and other kinds of military installations. Most likely, going after the nuclear facilities is not something they would be doing at this particular moment because of the repercussions, including the fact that Iran will then double down. It may go underground with its nuclear program. I mean, the ramifications are far too big. We're on the eve of an American election. 
 
The other target could be the oil installations. But again, the global repercussions, the economic global repercussions of that are far too big. So I think they are much more likely to go after the military installations.
 
FOSTER: OK. Maha, thank you so much for joining us from Paris with your insights on, you know, that very worrying picture that we're getting, obviously, of the Middle East. 
 
We want to take you to Berlin now, though, where the Middle East, of course, will come up as a topic.
 
U.S. President Joe Biden has just arrived there. You can see him there with the German president, the two heads of state. He's going to receive a particular honor. We'll talk about that a bit later on. President Biden, as he starts to leave office, but he's getting a full military guard there and the red carpet is out. This is a ceremonial welcome.
 
And we are if we listen in, listening to the national anthem, I believe.
 
(U.S. NATIONAL ANTHEM PLAYS)
 
FOSTER: The U.S.. National anthem playing there for this official visit by the U.S. president. He's going to receive a big honor. There'll also be meetings with the French and British leaders and the chancellor of Germany, of course. You saw the president there. And big topics on the agenda, of course, the death yesterday of the Hamas leader, the wider concern of a conflict in the Middle East and also, crucially, Ukraine, as well, and what support they can offer them. We'll be back in just a moment.
 <br>[04:45:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: Emotions remain raw for people around the world who are mourning the late British singer Liam Payne. Fans of the former member of the boy band One Direction are holding a vigil with his songs Candles and Tears outside the hotel where he fell to his death. It's not clear exactly what happened to cause this tragedy.
 
But investigations in Argentina are sharing what they've learned so far. CNN's Elizabeth Wagmeister reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ELIZABETH WAGMEISTER, CNN ENTERTAINMENT CORRESPONDENT: New details are coming in as authorities investigate Liam Payne's sudden death after the former One Direction member fell to his death at a hotel in Buenos Aires on Wednesday. A preliminary autopsy report reveals that Payne died from multiple injuries, including external and internal hemorrhages after falling from what authorities in Argentina said was the third floor balcony in his hotel room. 
 
When police announced Payne's death, they said they were directed to the hotel after a 9-1-1 call where they were informed about an aggressive man who could be under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
 
CNN's affiliate in Argentina has obtained that 9-1-1 call. Take a listen.
 
HOTEL RECEPTIONIST (through translator): Well, we have a guest who is overwhelmed with drugs and alcohol, and well, even when he's aware, he breaks things up. He's tearing the whole room apart. And, well, we need someone to be sent, please.
 
911 OPERATOR (through translator): That is under the influence of alcohol and drugs, yes?
 
HOTEL RECEPTIONIST (through translator): Yes, that's right. And we need someone to be sent to us urgently because, well, I don't know if the guest's life is at risk. He's in a room that has a balcony and well, we're a little afraid that he'll do something that puts him ...
 
WAGMEISTER: Photos that were provided to the media by authorities show a smashed television in Payne's hotel room and what appears to be drug paraphernalia, which CNN will not be showing to our viewers. 
 
The exact circumstances surrounding Payne's death are still unclear. But on Wednesday, Buenos Aires police told the Associated Press that Payne had jumped from the balcony of his room.
 
When I contacted a spokesperson with the Buenos Aires police, he declined to clarify those details, instead referring me to the prosecutor's office in Argentina. The prosecutor's office said that Payne's fall could have been
 
 accidental due to the position in which the body was found and from the injuries of the fall. Prosecutors say he may have fallen in a state of semi or total unconsciousness.
 
Payne's tragic death has sent shockwaves through the world as millions of fans mourn. To a younger generation, One Direction was like the Beatles. 
 <br>[04:50:00]
 
For many young fans, this is the first celebrity death that they have ever experienced, like other generations who were gutted over the sudden deaths of stars like Heath Ledger or Kurt Cobain. That is what a big deal Liam Payne was. His family said in a statement that they are heartbroken.
 
The members of One Direction released a statement saying, quote: We are completely devastated. In time and when everyone is able to, there will be more to say, but for now, we will take some time to grieve and process the loss of our brother who we love dearly. 
 
Memorials have been planned by fans, including one at Hyde Park in London this Sunday at 2 p.m. 
 
A tragic ending to a life lost too soon and certainly one that will spark a conversation about mental health, substance abuse and the pressures faced by so many young stars in the spotlight. Back to you.

FOSTER: Well, we are getting new economic numbers. Meanwhile, from China, they're showing weaknesses that are slowing things down. Third quarter growth was 4.6 percent and that may mean Beijing won't reach its overall 5 percent growth target for the year. Marc Stewart following this for us and it matters to the world. We're all connected.
 
MARC STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT: No question, Max. And I can tell you, as someone who lives here in China, the slow growing economy is very evident. At one point this year, we saw McDonald's, a global brand, offer meal deals that we've seen in other parts of the world to encourage people to come in and spend money. So it really is a global concern, considering China is the world's second largest economy. 
 
Here's what's at play. One, people aren't spending, but two, there's been a lot of issues with the housing market. There has been a crisis in the housing market, to put it bluntly. And that is a big deal because many Chinese families, in fact, some estimates up to 70 percent of Chinese families have their wealth in housing. So that has a direct impact on how people spend money.
 
The Chinese government would like to see growth. They've set a growth target, Max, as you mentioned, of 5 percent for this year. Some economists may see that as lofty. It is important to remember the Chinese economy is growing. It's just slow growing. Max, you're not seeing the big gains that were celebrated many years ago. So China is having to deal with this adjustment.
 
FOSTER: In terms of how the government is responding to this, how is it messaging it to the nation?
 
STEWART: Well, it's addressing it to the nation, but it's also addressing it to the globe, at least here in mainland China. Some stimulus measures have been taking place, but they've been very bank focused, very fiscal focused, interest rate focused. For us to expect for Chinese citizens to be given cash to spend, to encourage spending, that's not something that we will likely see.
 
But there is big global pressure for the Chinese government to do something more. We saw some housing incentives that were released earlier in the week. And it all goes back to the fact that when we have an economy this big, an economy of more than a billion people, there are so many stakeholders from around the world, such as McDonald's, as I mentioned, such as Apple.
 
So the Chinese government is seeing pressure to do some very aggressive actions by so many different fronts -- Max.
 
FOSTER: OK, Marc Stewart in Beijing, thank you. 
 
The October supermoon has been lighting up the sky. This time-lapse video of the celestial event in New York, also called the Hunter's Moon, was pretty impressive. It's the biggest, brightest supermoon of the year, named for early hunters who gathered food for the long winter ahead. Views of the lunar spectacle worldwide have been breathtaking. This is what people in New Delhi saw when they looked up.
 
A supermoon isn't really supersized, it just looks that way because the moon is close to Earth and normal, thanks to its orbit. That makes it bigger and brighter, like this view from Hong Kong. The moon is now beginning to wane though, but the show will still be worth watching tomorrow night if you missed it.
