LAILA HARRAK, CNN ANCHOR: Hello, and welcome to our viewers joining us all around the world. I'm Laila Harrak, and this is CNN Newsroom. Ukrainian claims gains on the battlefield recapturing villages in the South. Another sign that their long awaited counteroffensive could be underway. 
 
At parents prayers answered for the first time we're hearing from the father of the Colombian children who spent more than a month wandering the Amazon jungle. 
 
Plus, Donald Trump sets up here in court this week, becoming the first ever for U.S. president to face federal charges. But for his supporters, that doesn't change a thing.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Live from CNN Center. This is CNN Newsroom with Laila Harrak.
 
HARRAK: We begin in Ukraine where we're seeing the war enter a new stage. On Sunday, Ukrainian forces liberated three villages in Donetsk region, according to the country's Deputy Defense Ministry. You can see here fighters hanging the Ukrainian flag from a newly recaptured frontline village. Ukrainian also says it's making some counterattacks around the embattled city of Bakhmut.
 
Russia says it's putting pressure on Ukrainian forces destroying its quote, manpower and equipment. Defense Ministry says one of its ships was attacked by six unmanned Ukrainian drone boats and the Black Sea. Moscow released this video claiming to show the drone boats being destroyed. CNN can't confirm its authenticity.
 
Fred Pleitgen brings us now the latest from Ukraine.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Well, it certainly seems as though Ukraine's offensive operations are gaining steam the Ukrainians on Sunday saying that they took back several villages from the Russians, most of that happening on the sort of south eastern part of the very long front line here in this country. And that of course also comes after things seemed to get off to a rocky start at the end of last week with the Russians posting a couple of videos claiming to have destroyed a lot of armor, a lot of Western armor in what they said were failed operations by the Ukrainians to try and gain territory in the southern part of Ukraine.
 
Now, the Ukrainians are still not calling this their big counter offensive. There were some indications by the Ukrainian president this weekend saying that the Ukrainians had now gone to defensive counteroffensive operations. 
 
However, then on Sunday, the head of Ukraine's military intelligence he came out and he posted a video of himself just sitting in his chair and being silent. At the end of it the Ukrainian said, plans love silence, obviously once again, saying that they don't want to talk about the big counteroffensive indeed is already underway. 
 
But one of the things that is clear is that right now, in this country, the Ukrainian certainly have the initiative there is no place where the Russians seem to be making gains but a lot of places where the Ukrainian certainly are trying to make gains. 
 
One of those places is Bakhmut where on Sunday, the Ukrainians once again said that they had won back territory and this comes after several days of gains which the Ukrainian say have been significant. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HARRAK: Meanwhile, we're getting a fuller look at the impact of the destroyed dam in Ukraine's Kherson region. Ukrainian officials say at least 14 people have died in the flooding and nearly 3,000 evacuated including scores of children as they tried to escape Russia's deadly attacks continue. 
 
Ukrainian officials say three people were killed after Russian forces shelled and evacuation votes. Ukraine's president says the International Criminal Courts representatives have visited the collapse dam and begun investigating the disaster.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): The occupiers created this disaster by blowing up a dam leaving people to their fate in flooded towns and villages, and then shelling the boats that are trying to take people away. Even animals are more moral than you the Russian state.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP
 
HARRAK: Well, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is at risk as well. The chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency is planning to visit the plant as it receives cooling water critical for safety from the reservoir adjacent to the breached them. 
 
Let's get more insight now from retired U.S. Air Force colonel and CNN military analyst Cedric Leighton and he joins me now from Washington. Cedric, a very good day. I realize it's too early now to tell how things will play out and what these first military engagements mean for the situation on the ground.
 <br>[01:05:05]
 
But as this war seems to be entering a new stage, what are some of your thoughts?
 
COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITAYR ANALYST: Well, Laila, I think one of the key things to note here is that as things start to roll out in terms of this Ukrainian counteroffensive, we're going to see some areas, especially in the southeast and the east, and possibly in the south, that where the Ukrainians are going to make some progress. 
 
Now, we also have to expect that the Ukrainians are going to be stopped at some of these points, because of the Russians' efforts to shore up their defenses, the tank traps, the types of things that they've put out over the last few months. 
 
So it's been pretty clear that the Russians have had a chance to shore up these defenses. But, the key thing is, are those going to be these defenses? Are they going to be enough to stop the Ukrainians? And it seems to be the case that at least in the southeast, the answer is no. And that's possibly also the answer around Bakhmut as well.
 
HARRAK: As we see military activity being stepped up there continues to be infighting among Russian Armed Forces. What kind of questions does that raise?
 
LEIGHTON: Well, for one thing, Laila, the key issue, I think, for the Russians is unity of command. And one of the things that they have failed to establish even without the issues surrounding the Wagner group is that unity of command, they've had a really terrible time, setting up one chain of command for all of their forces, that one efforts that you know, was able to be able to prosecute a war in Ukraine. So that's one side of it. 
 
The other part of it is including the Wagner group and other paramilitary organizations, mercenary organizations, and the tension between the mercenary organizations and the Russian Ministry of Defense and the regular Armed Forces is really exceptionally notable. And what that does is it cuts the Russian war effort makes it very hard for them to coordinate their operations, and really lends a hand to the Ukrainians in a few would have expected a few months ago.
 
HARRAK: Now, as you pointed out earlier, the Ukrainian army's focus seems to be the southern Zaporizhzhia region where the nuclear power plant is also located. Russia has targeted critical infrastructure during this war numerous times, especially in the beginning. 
 
Is the Russian controlled nuclear plant a potential target, would you say? Could it be used as blackmail by Russian forces? And what is the likelihood of, for instance, the Russian leader resorting to some type of scorched earth strategy do something to the plants that would be catastrophic? Is that at all a consideration at this point?
 
LEIGHTON: I think it has to be a consideration. You know, as an intelligence person, I always looked at the worst case scenarios. And I think the Ukrainians are also doing that they're taking a look and seeing what could possibly go wrong types of things with the Russians do that would indicate a scorched earth policy with a -- we saw that with the Nova Kakhovka dam, the ability of presumably the Russians to deliberately take this down out, and make it collapse. 
 
Those are the kinds of things that we could see in other areas. We've had multiple reports of other dams being a being breached. The same thing could happen in a different way with the nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia. And if that did occur, that of course, would be the ultimate form of military and civilian blackmail in this case. 
 
So I think it's something that the Ukrainians have to expect, and they have to hope that it doesn't happen.
 
HARRAK: But do you think it could stymie the counteroffensive?
 
LEIGHTON: It could, it could certainly impact the counteroffensive, Laila. I think what could happen here is that it, you know, the threat of doing something like that could impact the ability of the Ukrainians to move in that southeastern sector, particularly in the Zaporizhzhia region could also affect efforts in the Donetsk region in that area, so that -- those things would possibly hinder the Iranian drive to the Sea of Azov, which I think is their main goal. And that is something that the Russians will seek to prevent. And they may very well used your power plan to do that.
 
HARRAK: Cedric Leighton thank you as always.
 
LEIGHTON: You bet, Laila.
 
HARRAK: Russia and Ukraine exchange nearly 200 prisoners of war on Sunday, according to statements from Moscow and Kyiv. 95 Ukrainian POWs were returned. Some had been captured on Snake Island, and the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol while others had been helped by the Wagner group. They were swapped for 94 Russian servicemen who will be taken to medical facilities in Russia before being allowed to return to their families. 
 
Now more than a day after U.S. citizen Travis Leake was detained in Moscow on drug charges. His mother says she has yet to hear from anyone in the U.S. government about his current status. 
 <br>[01:10:06]
 
CNN's Jennifer Hansler has the story.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JENNIFER HANSLER, CNN STATE DEPARTMENT PRODUCER (on camera): A court in Moscow has accused U.S. citizen Travis Leake of drug dealing or in their words engaging in the narcotics business through attracting young people and has said he will remain detained there in Russia until at least early August. 
 
Now the State Department on Sunday confirmed Travis's arrest and they said that there were officials from the U.S. Embassy in Moscow they're at his arraignment hearing yesterday. Now Travis's mother said she has not heard from the State Department as of Sunday, and she is concerned about the welfare of her son being imprisoned there in Russia. She is concerned about his well-being and his health and she said she would reach out to the U.S. government because she had still not heard from them if she did not hear from them by Monday. 
 
Now this arrest, of course, comes at a time of very heightened tensions between the United States and Russia. We have seen them detain numerous Americans, two of those Americans. Evan Gershkovich and Paul Whelan have been deemed wrongfully detained by the U.S. State Department. And last year Brittney Griner, the WNBA star who was freed in a prisoner swap was also arrested on drug charges. 
 
Now, one thing viewers should know is that Travis had been living in Moscow reportedly since 2010. And about a decade ago, he spoke with the late Anthony Bourdain, about the state of repression in Russia. He cited an incident that happened with MTV and his band and the Russian government. Take a listen to what he said about that.
 
TRAVIS LEAKE, U.S. CITIZEN DETAINED IN RUSSIA: This was a documentary series about musicians standing up and risking their lives in some cases, stand up against government abuse of power, government corruption, and yet a foreign government was able to editorially control what American viewers see on their TV screens. That to me is a scandal of epic proportions.
 
HANSLER: And we will be continuing to follow this case. We will be watching to see what the U.S. government has to say about Travis's arrest for now the State Department officials that they will continue to monitor the case closely. Jennifer Hansler, CNN, Washington.

HARRAK: Fighting has resumed in Sudan shortly after the expiration of a 24-hour ceasefire. And there are reports of battles in the capital of Khartoum and West Darfur four states. Saudi Arabia and the U.S. have been trying to broker a peace. 
 
In a tweet the Saudi foreign ministry said that during the ceasefire, both the Sudanese Armed Forces and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces had reduced fighting throughout the country. Saudi Arabia is now calling for an end to the hostilities.
 
And we're getting new images of the team that rescued those four children who had been missing in Colombia's rainforest for weeks. This video aired in -- aired on a public television stations showing local indigenous scouts and Colombian soldiers feeding the children in the dense jungle. The four siblings had been lost since May 1st, after surviving a plane crash that killed their mother and two other adults. On Saturday, the children were airlifted to a military hospital in Bogota, where doctors say they will continue to recover for two to three weeks. 
 
And now for the first time we're hearing from the father of those four siblings. He says his children were able to survive in the rainforest because of their upbringing and their connection with nature. Stefano Pozzebon reports now from Bogota.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
STEFANO POZZEBON, JOURNALIST (on camera): On Sunday, the father of the four Colombian indigenous children who were rescued last week after spending 40 days in the Colombian Amazon rainforest, traveled to Bogota and spoke with reporters outside the hospital where his children as receiving medical treatment, Manuel Ranoque actually joined the search and rescue operations in the last five weeks and was in the jungle up until Friday when his children were finally rescued. He said that he never lost hope, not even when the stakes against the hem, where seemed so daunting.
 
MANUEL RANOQUE, FATHER OF RESCUED INDIGENOUS CHILDREN (through translator): We are indigenous people, I believe in the jungle, which is our mother. And that's why I've always kept the faith and would say that both the jungle and nature have never betrayed me.
 
POZZEBON: Ranoque also said that his children were very weak when he visited them in hospital. We can only imagine how affected they are both mentally and physically by surviving these experience. The doctors are saying that they expect the children to stay under medical observation between two and three weeks. They're also receiving psychological support at the Central Military Hospital here in Bogota. 
 
Ranoque concluded by urging the Colombian President Gustavo Petro to invest more into transportation in the Amazon.
 <br>[01:15:00]
 
And also said that he wants to provide his children a good education in the future with just a reminder that mother of the four children died in that fatal crash on my first when these ordeal began. For CNN, this is Stefano Pozzebon, Bogota.

HARRAK: Former Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has reportedly been released without charges after she was arrested Sunday in connection with a probe into the Scottish National Party's finances. Police are investigating funds specifically earmarked for a second Scottish independence referendum campaign. CNN's Scott McLean explains the investigation.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Nicola Sturgeon's arrest has dominated headlines across the UK but it didn't come entirely out of the blue. Sturgeon's husband Peter Murell, who was the longtime chief executive of the Scottish National Party was arrested back in April, questioned by police for more than 11 hours and then released without charge. 
 
At that time, Sturgeon and Murrell's home in Glasgow was searched by police they even put up a tent in front of the house. The party's then treasurer was also arrested, questioned and released without charge, and the party headquarters in Edinburgh was also raided by police. 
 
All of this in relation to an investigation into the funding and finances of the Scottish National Party and specifically, what happened to 600,000 pounds that was earmarked for Scottish independence campaigning according to the British Press Association. 
 
Now, Sturgeon's arrest is part of that same investigation and follows a similar pattern. She was arrested Sunday morning held for more than seven hours of questioning, and then released without charge pending further investigation, according to police. 
 
Now, a spokesperson for sturgeon initially said that she went voluntarily and will cooperate with the investigation. We've now also heard from Sturgeon herself, who said in part to find myself in the situation I did today, when I'm certain I have committed no offense is both a shock and deeply distressing. Innocence is not just a presumption, I am entitled to in law, I know beyond doubt that I am in fact innocent of any wrongdoing. 
 
Now, she went on to say that she will continue to sit as a member of the Scottish Parliament. She stepped down as party leader in February citing the brutality of frontline politics. And at that time, it came as a pretty big shock to British politics because she had been one of the most successful and effective political leaders in the U.K. over the past eight years. 
 
Now, interestingly enough, Nicola Sturgeon actually began her weekend posting the results of a test she took to get a driver's license. She passed that test with flying colors but now has an entirely new one in front of her as a suspect in a police investigation. Scott McLean, CNN, London.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HARRAK: Still to come, a suspect is in custody after a deadly bus crash in Australia. Details on the tragic incidents ahead. Plus, thousands quickly evacuated as a volcano in the Philippines spews costs gases and lava. We'll have an update from the region.

 <br>[01:20:30]
 
HARRAK: Australian authorities have arrested the bus driver involved in a deadly crash in New South Wales. Initial reports indicate at least 10 people were killed and 25 others injured in the crash. The bus was returning from a wedding Sunday night when it flipped on its side while turning at a roundabout. The 58-year old male bus driver was initially taken to hospital under
 
 police guard for mandatory testing and assessment. 
 
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has extended his deepest sympathies for those killed in the horrific bus tragedy. While rescuers are searching for three British tourists who are gone -- who have gone missing after a fire broke out on a boat in the Egyptian Red Sea. 
 
12 other tourists were rescued and video shows one person jumping into the water as the boat is engulfed in flames. The survivors along with a boat's crew were taken to a nearby diving resort or the Red Sea state governor office says the fire was caused by an electrical short circuit onboard. Witnesses say the fire grew quickly.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ABDULRAHMAN ALSARHEED, KUWAITI TOURIST (through translator): During the briefing, one of the people saw smoke coming out of the boat in front of us. It was close to us around 50 meters away. One of the people on the blue boat said there was light smoke, and in one or two minutes the smoke became white and heavy. And then it turned black and the fire broke out so fast because it was windy in the morning.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK: Well, the UK's foreign office says it's supporting the British nationals involved. 
 
Officials in the U.S. State of Pennsylvania say it could take months to repair a section of a highway that collapsed on Sunday. Or this is the I-95 in Philadelphia which was heavily damaged when a fuel tanker truck caught on fire. The city's mayor says no injuries or deaths have been reported so far and local and federal investigators are now trying to find out what started the destructive fire. CNN's Danny Freeman has now more for Philadelphia.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DANNY FREEMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): The big questions that we don't have an answer to yet are still why and how did this fire and this collapse happened? The Governor and the city were not giving answers during a press conference Sunday evening. 
 
But I will tell you what we do know about how all this went down. Basically just before 6:30 Sunday morning there was a tanker truck that was sitting underneath I-95, that tanker truck then caught fire. And that fire is what ultimately led to the collapse of the northbound lanes on I-95. And the Governor told us on Sunday that the southbound lanes also are not safe at this moment. 
 
Now currently, the truck is still trapped underneath that wreckage we've been hearing all throughout the day, jackhammering and heavy machinery working through the day to sift through that rubble. And while there have been no reported injuries, the governor said they are still working to see if anyone was actually alive in that truck when this collapse happened. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation said that there are 500
 
 tons of concrete mess now sitting on the ground. That's what officials have to sit through -- sift through, take a listen to what Governor Shapiro said when he laid eyes on this incident first.
 
GOV. JOSH SHAPIRO (D-PA): Remarkable devastation. And I found myself you know, thanking the Lord that no motorists who were on 95 -- on I- 95 were injured or died. Just a remarkably devastating site. One that our first responders, law enforcement and others contained very quickly, they got people out of harm's way. And now under the leadership of Secretary Carroll and others, the hard work of clearing the site and rebuilding it will be underway and we're going to move as quickly as possible.
 
FREEMAN: Now, Governor Josh Shapiro said that this cleanup could take quite some number of months and just for some perspective, this is going to be a traffic nightmare. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation said that this stretch of I-95 carries about 160,000 vehicles every single day. It's likely the busiest in the state of Pennsylvania. Danny Freeman, CNN, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

HARRAK: Nearly 13,000 people have been evacuated from their homes in the Philippines, after one of the country's most active volcanoes started to erupt. Officials say Mount Mayon has been spewing itself America gas and lava on the south eastern part of Luzon, the nation's largest island.
 <br>[01:25:05]
 
Let's get you more on this developing story CNN's Kristie Lu Stout is tracking developments for you. Kristie, good to see. What's the latest on the volcano and the evacuation efforts of residents who are in the danger zone?
 
KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONENT: Well, Laila the lava is starting to flow from the mine volcano in the Philippines and nearly 13,000 residents have been evacuated and we have video of the evacuation that took place. 13,000 people evacuated already and take into some 18 evacuation centers. 
 
And authorities say at least already 88 percent of the local population have already been evacuated and they're working to move the rest of the population to safety. Mount Mayon has been spewing dangerous sulfur gas and lava in the past 24 hours.
 
And I'm going to show you this video from Sunday evening where you can see this glowing volcano the crater of the volcano glow that hot lava, the molten rock flowing down the mountain. Alert level three has been raised that indicates the possibility of a dangerous or explosive activity. And that means any entry into a six-kilometer radius of the volcano has been prohibited. 
 
Now there are no major industries around the volcano, but there is some subsistence farming, so in addition to the 13,000 residents who have been evacuated, local officials have evacuated some 10,000 farm animals as well. 
 
And let's show you the map to show you where this volcano is located. It's in Albay province, in the Philippines. It's located in the southeastern part of Luzon Island, and the Philippines is of course, part of the Ring of Fire in that is where, you know, volcanic activity. Earthquakes are very, very common.
 
But all eyes now on Mayon. And let's show you some video of what this world famous volcano looks like. It is one of the most active of the 24 volcanoes in the Philippines. It's famous for that near perfect conical shape that cone which is inspired myths, legends and artworks and it is absolutely awesome to behold for its beauty, but also for its destructive power.
 
Now, Mayon, this volcano has erupted more than 50 times in the last 400 years. And given what's happening right now. Its current level of activity of unrest volcanologist in the Philippines say that a hazardous eruption is possible within weeks, or even days. Back to you, Laila.
 
HARRAK: Kristie Lu Stout reporting. Thank you, as always.
 
LU STOUT: Thank you.
 
HARRAK: Still to come, Donald Trump set to meet with his attorneys in the day ahead as he prepares for a historic appearance in Federal Court to face criminal charges We'll have the latest on his legal troubles.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[01:30:17] 
 
LAILA HARRAK, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome back to our viewers all around the world. I'm Laila Harrak. And you are watching CNN NEWSROOM. 
 
Former U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to head to Miami in the coming hours to huddle with his legal team ahead of Tuesday's historic court appearance. That is when he will face a total of 37 federal criminal charges relating to his handling of classified documents after he left office. 
 
Mr. Trump has denied any wrongdoing, and railed against the charges in comments over the weekend. Sources say he is expected to make remarks again, this time on Tuesday night at his Bedminster, New Jersey golf club where he will be hosting a fund-raiser. 
 
CNN's Katelyn Polantz is following developments and has more details now from Miami. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE REPORTER: The level of detail and evidence that the Justice Department has collected in this case has begun to sink in. And Donald Trump's own attorney general, Bill Barr, one of his top people in his own administration who had gone to bat for him multiple times saying that investigations around Donald Trump should not have been taking place previously, was condemning the actions of the former president after he left the White House because this indictment is so explicit in the evidence that it has, because of the photos of documents in a bathroom at Mar-a-Lago, photos of boxes of documents spilled in a storage room, and then those 31 charges, each representing a document that Donald Trump is accused of willfully retaining outside of the protected area of the federal government. Top secret documents, classified documents, national security information. 
 
Here is more of what Bill Barr had to say on Sunday on Fox News. 
 
WILLIAM BAR, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: If even half of it is true than he is toast. I mean it's a pretty -- it's a very detailed indictment, and it is very, very damning. 
 
And this idea of presenting Trump as a victim here, a victim of a witch hunt, is ridiculous. He is not a victim here. He was totally wrong that he had the right to have those documents. Those documents are among the most sensitive secrets the country has. They have to be in the custody of the archivist. He had no right to maintain them and retain them. And he kept them in a way at Mar-a-Lago that anyone who really cares about national security, their stomach churn at it.
 
POLANTZ: Now with this indictment approved by the grand jury here in Florida, a process will kick off in the federal court system at this courthouse in Miami. So Donald Trump currently is going to be traveling because he needs to get here and face his charges in person. 
 
So he's going to be traveling to Miami on Monday, along with his body man Walt Nauta, a man also charged in this case as part of the alleged obstruction part of this investigation.
 
And then they will stay at a resort, at his resort near Miami, and then huddle with lawyers. So they're going to be having to talk to the lawyers about what's going to be expected on Tuesday in federal court. 
 
And then Trump will come to court on Tuesday, but he's going to have a lot of Secret Service protection around him. It's very possible that there will be no live pictures of him, or even photographs of him coming into the building to face these charges for his initial appearance. 
 
There's no photos in federal court. There's no video inside the building either. And so he'll have that proceeding, be read his charger, and we expect him to enter a plea of not guilty at this time. 
 
Afterwards, he's going to turn political again. The legal part of the day will be done, and Trump is already announcing he was flying back to Bedminster, New Jersey where he has another resort and he will be giving a speech. 
 
Katelyn Polantz, CNN -- Miami. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE) HARRAK: Douglas London is a retired senior CIA operations officer. He is also an adjunct associate professor at Georgetown University and the author of "The Recruiter: Spying and the Lost Art of American Intelligence". 
 
Douglas, so good to have you with us. As a retired CIA operations officer, you know, seeing these allegedly classified documents strewn on the floor, unsecured. What was your initial reaction when you saw that? 
 
DOUGLAS LONDON, RETIRED SENIOR CIA OPERATIONS OFFICER: Well, my initial reaction was shock and surprise and concern, but my reaction obviously took even a bolder turn after seeing the indictment, you know. 
 <br>[01:34:57]
 
LONDON: We are aware that the former president might have had as many as 300 plus documents and we see 31 specifically mentioned in the indictments, presumably those which the Justice Department believes it can prosecute as evidence. 
 
So my concern is going to be focused on the damage and the threat, what we don't know about what the former president might have also taken, and with whom he might have discussed these documents and others. 
 
HARRAK: Will it be easy to determine what sensitive information will have been compromised? And what are some of the potential damage control measures that the intelligence community, you think, would now have to consider? 
 
LONDON: Well, the complications are that we don't really know what the former president's intent was. For two cases specified in the indictment where we know he showed documents or spoke of the contents of those documents with individuals, civilians, writers I understand from the indictment, and also a member of political action group. 
 
But we don't know how many other documents he might have discussed, what he might have taken out of secure spaces, and with whom he might've shared these contents. 
 
So the challenge if you don't have someone cooperating in this case of the former president is can you determined through revelations from your adversaries, intelligence you can collect from a counter intelligence source that might reveal what they have acquired? What they know? And their actions and reactions to the knowledge? 
 
It's going to be fairly difficult, so a lot of it is going to be assuming the worst in some of these cases of what might be potentially at risk. 
 
HARRAK: So do you think the intelligence community might want to ask the special counsel to implement some special procedures to limit damage of potentially exposing more sensitive material? And what might that look like? LONDON: There is always going to be a conversation, a dialogue in
 
 terms of what's going to be allowable for discovery. It is clearly kind of conscious decision on what documents have been included in the indictment, some of them seem to be among the most sensitive one can imagine the president having, in terms of our nuclear capabilities, our war plans which you have to remember, those plans, those charts and maps are all based on the intelligence we have on our adversaries, on countries that might pose a threat to us. So there is the extent of what the president might have done beyond that, which is listed in the indictment, and try to determine the full extent of the damages as I said is going to also include the use of sources and methods which you do not want to expose in a trial, which is why I think that there are certain parameters and lanes that the Justice Department is going to use so they don't, in turn, do even further damage to our intelligence sources and methods in the process of prosecuting the former president. 
 
HARRAK: Let's look at the fall out in terms of how America's international allies might be looking at this going forward. What do you think the impact will be of this case? 
 
LONDON: Well, having stood before our international partners when circumstances are somewhat embarrassing, that there is a leak in the press or there's a spy case, now you have, you know, the former president who is the commander-in-chief, who knows all in terms of the nation's greatest secrets, many of which come from our partners. There is obviously going to be an inclination on their part to do their own damage control, to consider well, what do we share with the United States government? Particularly if the former president is reelected and becomes president again. 
 
And beyond our partners you have to think of the people out there, the men and the women who risked their life as agents for the Central Intelligence Agency and other U.S. intelligence community agencies. We have to think, you know, can I have confidence, can I have faith in sharing these secrets? 
 
So there is going to be implications among our friends, among our agents, and among our enemies as well who might think, are there even more opportunities there given what might still be out there in the public domain considering all the people who might have been exposed to this information who aren't under any controls, who talk on the phones, who write emails to discuss things that they might be able to target in a far easier way than coming after a U.S. official. 
 
HARRAK: Can you think of a precedent? 
 
LONDON: I can't, actually. I'm vexed to think of any similar situation before where the U.S. government hasn't suffered from leaks, but where you have someone who is at the top of the food chain in terms of national security information who would willingly use this information for his own agenda in a way that damages the sources and methods on which it is based. 
 
HARRAK: Douglas London, thank you so much for this conversation. 
 
LONDON: Thank you, Laila. 
 
HARRAK: The mayor of Miami says the city will hold a news conference in the hours ahead focused on safety and security precautions at the courthouse ahead of Donald Trump's appearance on Tuesday.

MAYOR FRANCIS SUAREZ -- MIAMI, FLORIDA: I can tell you that in Miami we're going to have a press conference on Monday to talk about safety and security. We want to make sure that all of our citizens know that they are going to be able to express their first amendment rights. And at the same time, we are going to keep them safe and we're going to make sure that there is no disorder.

HARRAK: And as that court date nears, law enforcement sources tell CNN FBI special agents assigned to domestic terrorism squads across the country are actively working to identify any possible threats. 
 
Well this, as some Trump supporters have been ramping up their charged and sometimes violent rhetoric. Sources say the FBI is aware that various groups such as the Proud Boys have been discussing traveling to south Florida to show support for Trump. 
 
And others like Republican Kari Lake, who ran for governor of Arizona and lost last year, are still denying that Trump lost the 2020 election. At a Republican event in Georgia on Friday, Lake said quote, "If you want to get to President Trump, you are going to have to go through me and 75 million Americans just like me." And she added, "Most of us are card-carrying members of the NRA. That's not a threat. That's a public service announcement."
 
CNN's Donie O'Sullivan has more now from Orlando, Florida on potential threats. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: We are seeing a lot of chatter online. Right now no specific or credible threats of violence according -- that's according to law enforcement officials that we have spoken to and also experts who monitor this kind of stuff online. 
 
We are certainly not seeing, you know, anything like the lead off to January 6th, 2021 where, you know, there was a mass mobilization effort on Facebook and elsewhere to get people to come to Washington, D.C., as part of the Stop the Steal movement. 
 
But look, a lot of, you know -- because of January 6th, and because of the prosecution stemming from that, a lot of this organizing has moved into private channels which law enforcement officials tell us, of course, that is a lot harder to penetrate. And there could be organizing happening, you know, in the darker corners of the Internet.

HARRAK: And that was CNN's Donie O'Sullivan reporting. 
 
Well, Donald Trump says the case against him is a joke and a political hit job. And in his first public remarks since the indictment, Trump railed against the special counsel telling the crowd at the Georgia Republican convention that Jack Smith is quote, "deranged". Trump fans outside Saturday's convention seemed equally unshaken by the indictment. 
 
CNN's Isabel Rosales filed this report. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ISABEL ROSALES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Former president Donald Trump unapologetic and on the attack. 
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Jack Smith -- sounds so innocent. He is deranged. 
 
This is a political hit job. 
 
ROSALES: Georgia's GOP convention marking Trump's first public appearance after becoming the first former president to face federal charges. 
 
JACK SMITH, SPECIAL COUNSEL: We have one set of laws in this country and we apply to everyone. 
 
ROSALES: Special counsel Jack Smith announcing 37 criminal counts against Trump, the majority for violations of the Espionage Act. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Doesn't matter to me. Not at all. 
 
ROSALES: Outside the state convention, his supporters are unfazed. 
 
DARYL NEAL, TRUMP SUPPORTER: I think it's a bunch of bull (EXPLETIVE DELETED). Trump hasn't done nothing wrong. The only thing Trump done is save this country. 
 
JILL WILCOX, TRUMP SUPPORTER: We are not going to let it stop. They can't stand the fact that he's running for president. And I'm a Donald Trump fan. 
 
GARY GRIESHEIM, TRUMP SUPPORTER: It is probably altered. But it's typical, typical liberal propaganda. 
 
ROSALES: None of the Republican voters CNN spoke with had read the indictment. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, I wouldn't waste my time on a phony indictment. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't care about the indictment. You can indict a baloney sandwich. ROSALES: These loyalists share a deep sense of distrust against
 
 perceived opponents of Trump, including the Department of Justice, the FBI, and the press. 
 
Supporters routinely brought up President Joe Biden, former vice president Mike Pence, and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton -- all had sensitive materials in their possession while out of public office. 
 
One big difference, Trump and his aide Walt Nauta, face nearly a half dozen charges related to obstruction and concealment of documents including for allegedly suggesting to his lawyers to not cooperate with the grand jury subpoena. 
 
TRUMP: And this whole fake indictment, they don't even once mention the Presidential Records Act. 
 
ROSALES: The indictment outlines two different occasions Trump allegedly showed classified documents to unauthorized people. And in 2021, Trump admitted on tape to having secret documents that he hadn't declassified, according to the indictment. 
 
"As president, I could have declassified, but now I can't", Trump said, according to a transcript of the audio obtained by CNN. 
 
There's an audio recording of him doing so. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: But we know that that can be changed. We know that that can be altered. 
 <br>[01:44:50]
 
ROSALES: Within the 49-page indictment, pictures showing boxes of classified documents stacked high in a Mar-a-Lago bathroom, ballroom, office space, and elsewhere. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What he did is incorrect, absolutely incorrect. But the system allowed it to happen. The system is broken. It needs to be fixed. 
 
ROSALES: The convention also drew a handful of anti-Trump protesters, co-opting one of his most popular catchphrases in this quick moment of tension. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Lock him up. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Lock you up. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He hadn't done nothing wrong.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. You support Hillary Clinton, she's done a lot of wrong. Oh you're an idiot. 
 
ROSALES: Ultimately, these Trump supporters could not point to any piece of evidence that would cause their support to waver. 
 
SHARON WILDER, TRUMP SUPPORTER: I think Trump is the best president we've ever had, and I'm all about getting him reelected. 
 
ROSALES: In a press conference this past week, Special Counsel Jack Smith encouraged people to read that full indictment, 49 pages, to get a grasp of the body of evidence. 
 
It was clear in my conversations with these Trump supporters that they did not have any sort of interest in doing that. 
 
Meanwhile, Trump has denied any wrongdoing and an attorney for Nauta has declined to comment.

BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Pope Francis is recovering normally, according to a statement from the Vatican press office. This after undergoing three hours of abdominal surgery last Wednesday.
 
Now, normally on a Sunday, the Pope would be at noon, conducting Angelus prayers from a balcony overlooking St. Peter's Square. But on this Sunday from hospital, according to the Vatican, he watched holy mass on television, received the eucharist, and then held Angelus prayers in private. 
 
Doctors are recommending that he keep his movements to a minimum, nonetheless, e did lunch with hospital staff and others looking after him. The Pope is expected to spend at least the next week here at Rome's Gemelli Hospital under close medical supervision.

HARRAK: Canadian officials say the number of out-of-control wildfires in Quebec Province has dropped from 72 to 44 as firefighters appear to be making progress in some areas. But other parts of the country are not in the clear yet. The Canadian
 
 Inter Agency Fire Center says there are now 431 active fires nationwide. That is up five from Saturday. 
 
And as Canada experiences its worst ever spring fire season, help is now coming from around the world. By Monday, about 1,200 firefighters, including over 100 from France, are expected to be battling the flames in Quebec.
 
Stanford University researchers are tracking the movement of some very poisonous South American frogs by putting them in pants. 
 
As CNN's Lynda Kinkade shows us, they are studying how the frogs navigate and the stylish look is clearly a bonus. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
LYNDA KINKADE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Why would scientists put pants on a frog? It turns out it's a good way to track where they are going. These poisonous frogs in South America are some of the most brightly- colored frogs in the world, but they are dangerous to touch. 
 
Measuring a mere 2 to 4 centimeters in length, their skin secretes toxins that can paralyze or kill a predator. Stanford University biologists wanted to learn more about how male and female poison frogs navigate. So they track to the tropical rain forests of Ecuador and French Guiana to study three different species. 
 
ANDRIUS PASUKONIS, BEHAVIORAL BIOLOGIST: To study any behavior in the field, first you need the ability to find the animal, observe it, and follow it around. So we have these tiny tags that we attach with the little silicone waistbands, little harnesses, handmade. It's a lot of little sewing exercises to fit these frogs. 
 
When we need to observe the behavior and know where they are as they move. We have the signal from the antenna, and we can find them and then we can record their location, we record their behavior. 
 
KINKADE: The team wanted to explore the role sex plays in navigation, something that has been studied in rodents, but never in frogs. 
 
PASUKONIS: What is interesting for us they have very complex parental behaviors. So males or females, depending on the species, transport their tadpoles on the back. Tadpoles are first (ph) on the land, and then they need to move them to water. 
 
So one of the parents will pick up the tadpoles and they navigate through the forest pretty far distances. In our study, we have one species where females do the job and run around more, and we have two species were males run around and move more. 
 
KINKADE: In the end, the team got a mixed bag depending on the species. In some cases, the female frogs navigated more quickly and accurately than their males. The male frogs from all three species tended to explore more. And if you are hoping to catch a glimpse of the fashionable frogs,
 
 you'd be out of luck. The researchers removed the pants from the frogs and released them when the study was over.

HARRAK: Just ahead, now that the hard work is done for Manchester City, the fun can officially begin. We'll tell you how they plan to celebrate their historic season. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[01:54:53]
 
HARRAK: And that was Manchester City singing along to the Oasis classic Wonderwall, after winning the Champions League final. Well, the club plans to continue the celebrations on Monday with a hometown parade. 
 
They will ride in an open top bus through the streets of the Manchester City center, celebrating with all three trophies from this year's historic Treble season -- the Premier League, the FA cup, and the Champions League.
 
Now in Kenya, some leaders of the semi-nomadic Maasai community are hoping that tourists who come for the safari will stay for the culture, and the historic traditions featured in the Maasai festival. Take a look. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
HARRAK: A jumping dance by Maasai warriors. It's just one of the traditions practiced by one of east Africa's most famous indigenous communities. This Maasai cultural festival in Kenya aims to preserve.
 
Held near the Maasai Mara Game Reserve, a popular tourist destination known for its wildlife in Kenya. Organizers say the gathering celebrates the rituals and customs passed down by generations of Maasai. But also importantly looks to the community's future by trying to boost tourism in the area. 
 
MICHAEL MARCO, TOUR GUIDE: We used to get tourists from all over, we will get tales from our grandmothers, and today we are seeing the culture that we have been used to be told. 
 
We see if this continues, and if this event goes well, we will be hosting many and many Maasai tribal days, for us and our generations to come. 
 
HARRAK: Dressed mainly in vibrant reds and adorned with beads, this is the iconic image of the Maasai. But they're historically semi-nomadic way of life raising cattle, sheep, and goats in parts of east Africa is under threat in recent years. There are frequent droughts and some Maasai in Tanzania, they have
 
 been forcibly removed from their land for hunting, investment and conservation reasons. 
 
Organizers hope the festival in Kenya is a reminder to younger generations to embrace their past, and a chance for the people visiting the country to learn that Africa's safari animals aren't its only treasure. 
 
JOSHUA OLE KAPUTA, MAASAI FESTIVAL ORGANIZER: When you come into this country and you don't see a Maasai, then you have not visited Kenya. So I'm saying Kenya is Maasai, and Maasai is Kenya. Yes.
