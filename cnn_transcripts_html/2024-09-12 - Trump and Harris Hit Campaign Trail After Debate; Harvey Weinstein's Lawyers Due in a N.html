REP. DEBBIE DINGELL (D-MI):  I don't understand at times what people see in Donald Trump. They know what will happen to this country if he's president again. But they believe strongly, and it's just closer than people realize.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
JOHN BERMAN, CO-ANCHOR, CNN NEWS CENTRAL:  All right, with us now, CNN senior political commentator Ana Navarro, a former White House spokesperson under the George W. Bush administration, Pete Seat. And Ana, what Debbie Dingell said this morning, and she's always a sobering voice I think for Democrats to say don't go too far here, made me think of a line that I read in "The Washington Post" overnight, which that some Harris advisors have long been concerned that she faces an uphill challenge of reaching critical voters, given historically brief campaign. 
 
The idea that she's got these ads, she did a convention she's proud of, she did a debate that she's now proud of, but it's not getting to the swing voters. The question is why?  
 
ANA NAVARRO, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  Look, I think nothing -- I don't think you should look at anything in a vacuum, right? A debate is not going to change people's minds, an endorsement is not going to change people's minds, but I think this steady drumbeat is going to help. 
 
And I'm glad that they are concerned. I am glad they are jittery, because nobody should take anything for granted, And I'm glad they are running as underdogs. I ran into Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention -- 
 
BERMAN:  As one does -- 
 
NAVARRO:  As one does, and she told me that one of the things that had happened to her was in 2016, a lot of people came up to her the day after the election and for the next four years to apologize to her for not having shown up because they thought she didn't need them. She had it won. 
 
She had it in the bag, and you know what happened? She lost. So, I am glad that there is this sense of urgency and need for people to show up and to register and to be active and be engaged. This is no time to lay on your laurels.
 
BERMAN:  Professor Seat, let me ask you if there are in fact swing voters out there who are not being reached, perhaps by either campaign, what is it that you think they are hungry to see that they're not seeing? 
 
PETE SEAT, VICE PRESIDENT, BOSE PUBLIC AFFAIRS GROUP:  Well, I'm skeptical that there are swing voters. I think they're as pre-historic as dinosaurs in major museums these days. People might think they're swing voters or like to pretend that they are, but this polarized environment forces voters to pick a side. 
 
And I think this is about persuasion though. This campaign is about persuasion, it's not about persuading voters to pick one candidate or the other. It's about persuading them to show up to the polls. What really stands between one candidate or the other winning truly is a couple of voters and a handful of states coming down with the sniffles and staying home to cling to their Kleenex rather than voting, that will seal America's fate. 
 
That's how close this is. And so, these campaigns need to find folks who are already with them, the low propensity voters who don't always show up, who are inclined to go to the ballot box, get them to vote early, get them to vote absentee, seal in, lock it up, that's how you win.  
 
NAVARRO:  I disagree with that. I think there are undecided voters still. I think there are swing voters, I know this because I have them in my family, and I keep asking them what are you waiting for, a sign from God? You know, a lightning bolt? What in the hell are you waiting for at this point? And I think -- I think they're kind of like in that state of waiting. 
 
Seeing if something different happens between now and, you know, in the next 50-some days. I mean -- and to their -- you know, in defense of them, a lot happened in three weeks, right? 
 
BERMAN:  Yes -- 
 
NAVARRO:  A lot of things change -- 
 
BERMAN:  Sometimes a lot of stuff happens. 
 
NAVARRO:  So, sometimes a lot of things happen, all of a sudden -- 
 
BERMAN:  See 2024 Summer -- 
 
NAVARRO:  Exactly. So, they exist not many of them, that part is very true. But Georgia was decided by 11,000 votes -- 
 
BERMAN:  Right -- NAVARRO:  In 2020, Florida was decided by 537 votes. 
 
BERMAN:  So, I am curious then, Pete, how things like Laura Loomer play maybe with these swing voters? Laura Loomer is a conservative activist, someone who has leaned into conspiracy theories that 9/11 was an inside job among others, traveling with Donald Trump to New York for 9/11, you know, traveling with him around the debates and what not. 
 
And Marjorie Taylor Greene -- what Laura Loomer has said recently online is so extreme that Marjorie Taylor Greene is speaking out. Let me read you some of this tweet thread here. Marjorie Taylor Greene writes, "this is appalling and extremely racist. It does not represent who we are as Republicans or MAGA.
 
This does not represent President Trump. This type of behavior should not be tolerated ever. Laura Loomer should take this down." What is she talking about? Well, Laura Loomer put out a tweet, I'm not going to read out the whole thing because it's racist, fully-on racist. But she says, "if Kamala Harris wins, the White House will smell like curry among other things."
 <br>[09:35:00] 
 
Pete, so, if Marjorie Taylor Greene is speaking out against you, what does that tell you? Who -- about the person you're taking on your plane in the case of Donald Trump and Laura Loomer. 
 
SEAT:  Well, you are kind in your description of Laura Loomer, she's a lunatic, and I don't think anyone should pay attention to anything she says. And it's troubling, it is troubling that the Republican nominee and a former President of the United States and potentially the next President holds her in such high regard. 
 
And the reason is because he feeds or she feeds his worst impulses. That's what he wants. He feeds off of that type of rhetoric, and those types of conspiracy theories, and she is going to just keep giving him the red meat that he wants, and she'll remain in that inner circle, which is a problem.
 
It's a troubling development, but I would just encourage folks to not pay attention to her because 99.9 percent of what comes out of her mouth is completely insane.  
 
BERMAN:  She's getting a seat on Trump's plane, Ana. 
 
NAVARRO:  Right, his wife isn't on the plane, his daughter isn't on the plane, but this cook is on the plane, and I think it should be incredibly concerning that potentially, the next President of the United States is surrounded by racist conspiracy theorist. Listen, when Marjorie Taylor Greene is all of a sudden the voice of reason, we've got to like -- you know, call it a wake-up moment. 
 
And I do think we need to pay attention to it because I like to know what role she's going to have in a future Trump administration. I'd like to know what kind of access she would have to the future, possibly President of the United States. And by the way, I will tell Laura Loomer, I've been in Kamala Harris' house, and you know what it smells like? It smells like power.
 
It smells like patriotism. It smells like equality. It smells like a woman who's broken glass ceilings. Racist. 
 
BERMAN:  Ana Navarro, Pete Seat, appreciate you being with us this morning. Thank you very much. A quick programming note, comedians Roy Wood Jr. and Amber Ruffin and Michael Ian Black, they will be talking about the headlines in a new comedy quiz show on CNN, "HAVE I GOT NEWS FOR YOU?" It premieres this Saturday night at 9 O'clock. Sara?  
 
SARA SIDNER, CO-ANCHOR, CNN NEWS CENTRAL:  John, you'd win that every single time. I noted, because I know you tend to win quiz shows. 
 
BERMAN:  I cheat -- 
 
SIDNER:  Judging from the past, you do not -- 
 
(LAUGHTER) 
 
SIDNER:  You do not. All right, next hour, attorneys for Harvey Weinstein due in court over a potential new indictment just days after the convicted rapist was rushed to the hospital. And wildfires across California continue to wreak havoc on local communities there. We are live on the ground with this dangerous fire that is 0 percent contained. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 <br>[09:40:00]
 
KATE BOLDUAN, CNN NEWS CENTRAL:  Right now, there are multiple major fires burning across California, three of them in Los Angeles. The National Weather Service there has issued a red flag warning because of one of these fires called the Bridge Fire this morning. Warning that gusty winds will make it difficult to fight that fire for another day. 
 
It's already destroyed homes and now more communities are under threat. Let's get to CNN's Stephanie Elam who's standing by in California, right in the frontlines of it. What's going on, Stephanie? 
 
STEPHANIE ELAM, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Kate, as you can see, this is part of the area in the Bridge Fire that just was incinerated. One fire official I spoke to said it was like an inferno when this happened. This blaze actually started on Sunday, about 4,000 acres and within a 24-hour period exploded to more than 30,000 acres.
 
It's now burned close to 50,000 acres. And this look that you see here is pretty much what it looks like, most of the vegetation is down, wire, the power lines, those are burnt down to as far as like the poles that are holding them up. All of this here, as well as homes that were lost in this area is just indicative of what we're seeing throughout the region. As you mentioned, there are three fires that are burning. This one is
 
 in L.A. and San Bernardino County. You also have the Line Fire that's in San Bernardino County, and you have the Airport Fire that's in Riverside and Orange Counties that is burning. These are really taxing the system as far as how they are attacking these blazes in southern California so much so, normally, they would fight from the sky and they would assign aircraft to these blazes. They can't do that. 
 
They're using them and flying them to different incidents as they need to, to drop fire retardant, to drop water. But overall, Kate, when you look at what's happening over 100,000 acres are burned right now and continue to burn as they are battling these major blazes. 
 
BOLDUAN:  And yes, there is fire season, but the way you describe how it exploded so fast in just a matter of hours is absolutely terrifying for everyone. It's great to see you, thank you so much for being there. Sara?
 
SIDNER:  All right, next hour, we can learn whether new rape charges will be filed against disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein after a judge threw out a previous conviction against him. CNN's Jean Casarez is following this and it's outside the court. Jean, what might this new indictment look like?
 
JEAN CASAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, at this point, any indictment would be sealed. But we do know a little bit more than I think you normally would, because the defense had filed paperwork saying we know that a grand jury is convened right now. And Harvey Weinstein wants to testify before that grand jury. 
 
And under New York law, a defendant actually can appear before the grand jury to testify, so, the defense needed some information. Well, CNN was able to get a transcript that was not sealed of a hearing several weeks ago, right in this courthouse between the two parties, prosecutors and defense. 
 <br>[09:45:00] 
 
And the defense said we need information on who these accusers are. Well, here's what we know because of that transcript, three accusers from 2005 to 2016, 2005, 2006 Winter in that time period, Lower Manhattan, this is one of the first accuser, Lower Manhattan beneath 14th Street, the Tribeca area in a residential building. 
 
The next one, number two, Tribeca Grand Hotel 2006, and the third one in a hotel in the Tribeca area, unnamed hotel In 2016. Now, we do not know if an indictment includes those three, but that's -- though, that's what was listed in the document. Now, Harvey Weinstein wants to be at this hearing today because that indictment could be unsealed, it would be an arraignment.  
 
However, he had surgery on Monday at Bellevue Hospital in New York City, and I confirmed last night with his representatives, he is in stable condition in the cardiac unit. I was told he still wants to be here, but the hospital would determine this morning if he was medically able to come. I spoke with his representatives this morning, he most likely will not
 
 be in that courtroom this morning. So, the question is, the prosecution may still want to put on the record that there is an indictment, that would be a confirmation, right there. And remember, there's a re-trial from the overturned conviction. A re-trial of two charges set for this November. Sara? 
 
SIDNER:  I know you will be in court to see what happens in court and whether that indictment is mentioned by the prosecutors. Jean Casarez, thank you so much for your reporting for us this morning. 
 
BERMAN:  All right, a historic moments, hundreds of miles above earth and you saw it right here live on CNN NEWS CENTRAL. We stage it for you, the first commercial spacewalk ever.  
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Back at home we all have a wild work to do, but from here, well, it's terrible, it looks like a perfect world.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 <br>[09:50:00] 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Administration(ph), give you more in space export, invest time. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
SIDNER:  The first-ever commercial spacewalk concluded and they have success. The tech billionaire and engineer were the first non- astronauts, well, not official astronauts anyway to go outside of spacecrafts. So much history made in this journey, including some groundbreaking space suits. 
 
Let's get to retired Colonel Chris Hadfield, he is a former astronaut and commander of the International Space Station. All right, so, you see this picture. Can we -- can we really call it a spacewalk? Am I going to -- 
 
BERMAN:  Space peak -- 
 
SIDNER:  Space -- 
 
(LAUGHTER) 
 
BOLDUAN:  Oh, yes -- 
 
SIDNER:  They're popping out of the capsule there. I don't -- I'm not sure they're walking, but why is this so significant?  
 
CHRIS HADFIELD, FORMER ASTRONAUT &amp; INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION COMMANDER:  Right, it's significant for two big reasons. One is no one has ever used this space suit out in space before. So, it opens up a whole new capability. We haven't had a new space suit in over 40 years. 
 
So, all the latest technology since then integrated into new tech suit. The other is the SpaceX capsule has never gone down to the zero pressure vacuum of space before testing the hatches and all the equipment inside that everything worked. So, too huge thresholds today, opening up capability for what we're going to be able to do in the future.  
 
BOLDUAN:  You have conducted spacewalks yourself. What does it feel like?
 
HADFIELD:  You know, the coolest moment in my life, and I've been really lucky I was a combat fighter pilot and a test pilot and flew in space three times. The coolest moment in my life was when I was trusted to be inside the ship, open up the big heavy hatch, get it out of the way, and then you grab on with two hands, and it's almost like giving birth to yourself, holding yourself from this little place into the rest of the universe, where the world is this giant, bulging, shape and color, and you are now separate from the Earth, out in the infinity of the universe as one of the very first human beings to experience as we step away from the world. 
 
It's an amazing human moment, big technological moment. But boy, from a personal point of view, I still marvel that I had a chance to do that. 
 
BERMAN:  Giving birth to yourself, I just pulled a -- I just pulled a muscle -- 
 
BOLDUAN:  Describing for us -- 
 
BERMAN:  Thinking about it. 
 
(LAUGHTER) 
 
BOLDUAN:  I want to go to space, I don't want to give birth to myself. Just get sick --    
 
BERMAN:  So, colonel, this is a stepping stone now to what, do you think?   
 
HADFIELD:  Yes, it's very much a stepping stone. I mean, it was -- it wasn't a huge long spacewalk, but they needed to test all the equipment. But now that suit will get advances, you know, like they're going to unplug the umbilical and build a backpack that goes along with it. 
 
There will be the child or the grandchild of the -- suit will be using to walk on the moon -- the Chinese are going there, and so, we need an updated suit to do all that work. So, this was like a little successful glimpse of the future that we're building for ourselves. 
 <br>[09:55:00] SIDNER:  Why is it so hard to maneuver? Because when I think of space, and I'm no astronaut, not even close, I can't even count to ten, but why is it so difficult to maneuver this outfit? It looks painfully difficult as they're trying to just do simple tasks. 
 
HADFIELD:  You know, the people that make balloon animals at parties, you know, you just take a typical balloon, but as soon as you twist the balloon, you know how hard it gets and how stiff the balloon gets. And that's not nearly the level of pressure that you need inside a suit to keep you alive. 
 
So, the suit is -- it just wants to hold a fixed position, and every single move you do is fighting that balloon animal of a suit. So, it's sort of like being on the bench press machine, the whole time you're in a suit, in order to get anything done. And you've got blinders on, you can't really see, and you're being kept alive by a lot of machinery. 
 
So, there's all that psychological pressure, not an easy place to work, but the best place to work in the universe.  
 
SIDNER:  It's so cool. I so want to do it. I desperately need to do it --   
 
BOLDUAN:  I love how Chris explains this stuff, it's so -- 
 
SIDNER:  It's perfect, that's why he got to do it, and I am not getting to do it. That's what I am saying. Thank you so much Colonel Hadfield for explaining all that to us and just bringing us to space. We appreciate your time.
 
BOLDUAN:  In the moment, thank you so much for joining us, this is CNN NEWS CENTRAL -- John is still thinking about giving birth to himself. "CNN NEWSROOM" is up next.
