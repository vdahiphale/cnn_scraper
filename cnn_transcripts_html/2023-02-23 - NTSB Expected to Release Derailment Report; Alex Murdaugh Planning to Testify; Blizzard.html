JIM SCIUTTO, CNN ANCHOR: A very good Thursday morning to you. I'm Jim Sciutto.
 
KRISTIN FISHER, CNN ANCHOR: And I'm Kristin Fisher. 
 
Happening right now, the people of East Palestine, Ohio, eagerly awaiting that NTSB report on what led up to that devastating toxic train derailment earlier this month. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg on the ground there this morning as residents voice their anger and frustration in that CNN town hall last night. 
 
SCIUTTO: Yes.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR: If you do not feel safe living in East Palestine raise your hand. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't know what the future holds for my town. This has the potential to really decimate a small town like us.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm 65 years old. A diabetic. A-fib heart -- heart disease. Everything. Now, did you shorten my life now? I want to retire and enjoy it. How are we going to enjoy it. You - you burned me. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SCIUTTO: Well, other story we're following this morning, disgraced South Carolina attorney, Alex Murdaugh, seen there, on trial for murdering his wife and his youngest son. Now a source tells CNN he is expected to take the stand to testify in his own defense. We're going to take you to that courtroom live in just a moment. 
 
And hundreds of thousands of people are without power this morning, this as a massive cross country winter storm rips across several states. Ahead, the warning for New England and the East Coast, where we are. 
 
But we begin this morning in East Palestine with CNN's Jason Carroll. 
 
Jason, those emotions running high last night. We saw their genuine frustration, their fears, with the Norfolk Southern CEO. 
 
Tell us what's happening there today and are folks getting answers, are they getting the help they need? 
 
JASON CARROLL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, and we were there last night, as you know, Jim, hearing some of the emotions from the residents. And we'll see as the transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg, is here on the ground, if he will hear from residents as well. 
 
Right now he's receiving a tour of the site. He's being shown that trench that was dug out next to the train tracks there where the material was burned off. Also being shown how the water is being pumped out of the site.
 
All of this happening as we are awaiting that preliminary report from the NTSB. That is due out sometime this morning. Already Ohio's lieutenant governor has spoken out about that report, saying, quote, once we get the report from the safety board, that information could be the basis for a criminal referral. I would encourage our Ohio team to take a look at that as soon as we get a chance. 
 
Also, the lieutenant governor saying that the rail company, Norfolk Southern, needs to do more from the residents here in East Palestine. And if that means temporarily relocating some of the residents here, so be it. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LT. GOV. JON HUSTED (R-OH): Look, Norfolk Southern should temporarily relocate people if they feel unsafe living in their homes. I think that the railroad should consider buying property of people who may not feel safe or would want to relocate as a result of the spill. This is the railroad's responsibility. And it's up to the government officials at the federal, state and local levels to hold them accountable and do right by the citizens of East Palestine. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CARROLL: And so, once again, Jim, as we wait for that NTSB preliminary report to come out, the transportation secretary here on the ground. He's received some criticism, as you know, for taking this long to get here, but he is here today. We'll see if he has an opportunity to hear from residents. 
 
Jim.
 
FISHER: Yes. And he's expressed some regret about not speaking out about it sooner. 
 
Jason Carroll, we await that NTSB report due in about one hour from now. Thank you so much. 
 
SCIUTTO: Also new this morning, a source tells CNN that Alex Murdaugh, the disbarred attorney, on trial now for the murders of his wife and son, is planning to testify in his own defense, and that will happen today. We first learned Murdaugh might take the stand in his defense yesterday when his team asked the judge to limit the scope of Murdaugh's cross examination. We should note the judge denied that request. 
 
FISHER: And CNN's Randi Kaye is live outside the courthouse this morning. 
 
So, Randi, I mean this has been the big question for days now, will Murdaugh testify? Now we know that he likely will. Will he be the first to testify today? What can we expect to see? 
 
RANDI KAYE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: At this point - this point it's still unclear exactly when he would take the stand, if he does take the stand. 
 <br>[09:05:01]
 
Of course we're told it is likely, CNN has learned that, that he is planning to take the stand, but anything can change. 
 
We understand that this was a decision -- from a source telling me that this was a decision that Alex Murdaugh made on his own. His lawyers, of course, could recommend one way or the other, but they were leaving it up to his client. And there is nothing certain, I'm told by my source, until his hand goes right on that Bible to take the oath before he would testify. 
 
So, we are waiting here to see if he does testify. Of course, the big question in this testimony is this problem for the defense. As we know, at least nine witnesses have placed Alex Murdaugh basically at the murder scene around the time of the murders by identifying his voice on this recording that was on his son's cell phone at 8:44 p.m., around the time of the murders. Alex Murdaugh has told investigators and others that he was not at the kennels around those time - around that time. So, it would be very interesting to hear how he explains that on the witness stand. 
 
But yesterday one of his long-time friends, a fellow lawyer, Mark Ball, testified about Alex Murdaugh. He testified for the defense, but he sounded a lot like a state witness, actually, in - in when he was speaking about that kennel video and other moments from the night of the murders. 
 
Listen to what he told the jury. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And any doubt in your mind that Alex Murdaugh, Maggie, and Paul were on that kennel video at 8:44 p.m. on June 7, 2021? 
 
MARK BALL, ALEX MURDAUGH'S FRIEND AND FORMER LAW PARTNER: None. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No doubt in your mind? 
 
BALL: No doubt. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He deny ever going down to those kennels to his
 
 buddy and law partner of 34 years? 
 
BALL: He said that he ate dinner, laid down on the couch, took a nap and then left to check on him. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And now you know that's not true from seeing the kennel video, right? 
 
BALL: I do. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And that wasn't the only time he told you that, is it? 
 
BALL: No, I -- at least three times. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KAYE: Again, how will Alex Murdaugh, if he takes the stand, explain his voice apparently being on that kennel video, at least according to nine witnesses? 
 
And Mark Ball also - just one other note, said that there was another discrepancy. He said that - inconsistency, I should say, where Alex Murdaugh told him that first he checked Maggie when he got to the scene, then he checked Paul. At another time he told him that he checked Paul when he got to the scene and then he checked Maggie. So, there are a few things that he may have to explain if indeed he does take the stand today. 
 
Jim. Kristin.
 
SCIUTTO: Quite a moment in that courtroom. Randi Kaye, thanks so much. So, we will take you to that testimony live when it happens. 
 
All right, you may have noticed, if you were in the path, a blizzard, high winds, ice, a winter storm sweeping across much of the country is now taking aim at New England. The powerful weather system moved from California to the Midwest on Wednesday, leaving more than 850,000 people without power, dumping up to 40 inches of snow in some area. 
 
FISHER: And already today more than 700 flights have been canceled. The airport in Green Bay, Wisconsin, had to close yesterday because of that extreme weather there. 
 
CNN's Adrienne Broaddus joins us live from Bloomington, Minnesota. 
 
Adrienne, this is not over yet but how are the conditions where you are? I saw you earlier, and who needs mascara when you can have a coating of snow on your eyelashes. 
 
ADRIENNE BROADDUS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that's the new fashion trend. I thought they told you guys. But I'm just letting all our viewers know right now, snow on your eye classes, it's cool. As long as you have fun and stay safe. 
 
But right now I'm standing on this bi mountain of snow. You might as well call Minnesota min-a-snow-ta, s-n-o-w-t-a. 
 
I really just want to slide down this and have fun, but the snow that they remove has to go somewhere. 
 
We're going to swing around and show you what the streets look like. First of all, this is normally a sidewalk. If you noticed, when I was up there, I was pretty much almost even with the crosswalk sign. No one's going to be walking along this sidewalk. And if they do, it won't be a walk in the park. 
 
The roads, people are taking the advice here in the twin cities. They've been pretty clear. But under this coat of snow, there is a thin layer of ice. So that's something to be mindful of. 
 
We saw heavy snowfall overnight into the early morning. Visibility was reduced. It's starting to improve. I can see the billboard across the street. I could not see that in the last few hours. 
 
But the National Weather Service, I will point out, they have scaled back the snow totals. Initially they were saying at least 20 inches. They've scaled back to about 15. Perhaps some parts of the state may see 20 inches. But again, it's happening right now, the wind is picking up. It's hard to talk. When the snow hits the side of my face, it hurts. It almost feels like a needle. It's about 16 degrees but it feels more like 2. 
 
I'm going to send it back to you guys now. If you do say something on the other side of this report, I cannot hear you. Unfortunately, my earpiece got wet because of all of this snow. 
 <br>[09:10:01]
 
I'm just keeping it real. 
 
SCIUTTO: Goodness, looks like it's measured in feet not inches there. 
 
Adrienne Broaddus, stay warm. Thanks so much. 
 
FISHER: Thanks, Adrienne. 
 
SCIUTTO: All right, while lots of folks dealing with blizzard like conditions, parts of the south, it feel like summer. I mean the contrast is crazy.
 
FISHER: It's wild.
 
SCIUTTO: CNN Meteorologist Chad Myers now. 
 
Chad, I mean, two extremes. I mean even here in D.C. it's going to be in like the 60s, 70s today. What the heck is going on?
 
CHAD MYERS, AMS METEOROLOGIST: Breaking a record up there in D.C. All the coast cities could be very close to a record today or even approaching the entire record for any day for the entire month of any February out there. We call those monthly records. But look at this yesterday. From 11 below at Cut Bank to 96 in
 
 McAllen. That was at the exact same time. That's not morning low compared to afternoon high. That was right in the middle of the afternoon. So, over 100 and, what, 7 degrees difference. And today is going to be, again, a warm one in McAllen, cold in Minot, cold behind the snow. Record highs. Almost every little dot you see here would likely break a record high for today. 
 
Some of the records are extremely hard to break and others are not. The high today, 81 in Charlotte. That old record, 79, doesn't have a chance. 
 
Here's your snow across parts of the upper Midwest. The snow is moving away from Adrian, also moving away from Boston. Boston's problem is that when the sun sets tonight, the roads are going to be icy. Everything is going to refreezes tonight as temperatures go back down into the 20s, even though right now it's 33. 
 
The next storm system coming on shore in the Pacific. There will be a blizzard in LA County. Los Angeles County. Now, not really where all the people live up in the high elevations, it does get very high up there, Mount Baldy gets up well above 6,000 feet, I think. So this is the upper elevation snows. They are coming in. This is the next one to look forward to, 2 to 3 feet of good snow in many spots where the potential is up to six because of the contrast between the warm and the cold. 
 
Kristin. Jim. 
 
SCIUTTO: Wow.
 
FISHER: Almost 80 degrees here in D.C. Jim's very upset. He wants just one snow day this year. 
 
SCIUTTO: I should have worn shorts today.
 
MYERS: Yes. And flips (ph).
 
FISHER: Chad Myers, yes, thank you. 
 
SCIUTTO: Coming up next, Ukrainian cities are stepping up security as the one year mark of Russia's invasion looms. The former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, she'll join me live from Kyiv on the way forward. Is there an end in sight to this war?
 
Plus, tragic news out of Orlando. Three people are dead, including a nine-year-old girl and a television reporter who went there to cover a shooting. The latest on the investigation. 
 
FISHER: And, again, we're watching that courtroom in Walterboro, South Carolina, this morning as a source tells CNN that Alex Murdaugh will take the stand in his own defense today. We'll take you there live if and when it happens. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:16:57]
 
SCIUTTO: As we speak, officials in Ukraine are putting extra security measures in place. They're concerned that Russia will mark tomorrow's one-year anniversary of the invasion with even more attacks on Ukrainian cities. 
 
FISHER: CNN correspondent Melissa Bell joins us live in Kyiv. 
 
So, Melissa, what's the mood like there? How are Ukrainians planning to mark this - this day tomorrow? 
 
MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Kristin, really looking ahead very carefully to what they fear might be an opportunity for Russians to mount some kind of symbolic uptick in their efforts. Now, divided opinions from analysts on whether Moscow has the capabilities to do that, that is the fear and that is what Ukrainians are preparing for in regions around Kherson, in regions in the north around Kharkiv, civilians being told to stay home from work from today through to Saturday if they're concerned. Preparations being made about an possible increased attacks on those areas that have been so successfully taken back over the course of the last few months by Ukrainian forces in their counteroffensive. 
 
What we're hearing though this afternoon from Ukrainian officials is that - is that it is around that crucial city of Bakhmut that the situation remains the most tense with Russia having really increased the intensity of its offensive there, increasing the manpower, increasing the firepower, as they try to take a city that's become not really just as symbolic but as symbolic, rather, as it is important militarily as they try and push through to what Ukraine believes their objective is, which would be to take the whole of the Donbas region over the coming weeks. 
 
Ukraine determined not to do that, managing to hold Bakhmut for the time being and saying that they believe that Russia has also been leading more attacks across the northern border to try and keep as many Ukrainian troops as they can tied up to prevent them trying to make any progress anywhere along that front. That is the situation this afternoon. But it is really ahead to tomorrow's date that everyone looks slightly fearful about what might happen. But, again, a great deal of doubt about whether or not Moscow can achieve that objective of carrying out any symbolic strike at all. 
 
More western support as well. Today we've had the visit from the Spanish prime minister following hot off the heels of Joe Biden, of course, on Monday. And it is, therefore, more support, a tangible effort to show that unity behind Kyiv as we head into this anniversary, Jim and Kristin. And also that watchful vigilance really that we're seeing on the part of the Ukrainians. Also very much present in the mind of the western allies as we look ahead to what may happen tomorrow and in the coming days. 
 
SCIUTTO: Melissa Bell, in the Ukrainian capital, thanks so much.
 
SCIUTTO: Joining me now to speak about this is the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch. She's the author of the book "Lessons from the Edge: A Memoir."
 
Ambassador, thanks for taking the time this morning. 
 
MARIE YOVANOVITCH, : Thanks for having me on. 
 
SCIUTTO: Tomorrow marks one year since Russia invaded Ukraine. Is there any end in sight to this war in your view? 
 
YOVANOVITCH: Yes. Just to underline a point, it's one year of Russia's total war on Ukraine.
 <br>[09:20:02]
 
SCIUTTO: Yes.
 
YOVANOVITCH: But it's actually the ninth year marker for Russia's war on Ukraine. You'll recall that in 2014 they took Crimea and parts of the Donbas. So this has actually been going on for a very long time. 
 
And just to answer your question, I mean I think there is an end in site. You know, the Russians could pull out their troops tomorrow and that would end it. Ukrainians here -- that is probably not likely to happen. But Ukrainians here are very optimistic. Whether you talk to people in the government or whether you talk to people on the street, I mean they are resilient and they are optimistic and they are -- they are hoping that there will be a victory in the nearer term rather than the longer term. 
 
SCIUTTO: Yes.
 
YOVANOVITCH: But it's important, I think, that we be ready for the long haul and that Ukraine be ready for the long haul because Russia certainly is. 
 
SCIUTTO: Well, it's a good point about 2014. I was there. From the Ukrainian perspective, they've been going at this for more than a decade. 
 
YOVANOVITCH: Yes.
 
SCIUTTO: I just wonder, given the severity of Russian losses in personnel, in equipment, in economic costs, you've studied Russia for many years, does Putin have the strength, the support, the power to continue the war indefinitely? 
 
YOVANOVITCH: Yes. Well, I think the Russians, at some point over the last six months, made a decision to go to this war of attrition. And so they're just, you know, pushing bodies, basically, at this war, trying to, as your correspondent said, trying to draw off Ukrainian troops from other areas. And so the center of gravity is in Bakhmut right now. 
 
And I think, you know, the costs are -- they don't view the costs in the same way that we in the west do as others do. 
 
SCIUTTO: Yes. YOVANOVITCH: And so I think it is possible for Putin to keep on going. And he has successfully made this - you know, in the beginning, it was Putin's war. It was Putin's initiative. But now it has become a Russian war. I mean there is support in Russia for this war. And he does not appear to be paying a price for this aggression. 
 
SCIUTTO: That's a remarkable point. 
 
I want to give you an opportunity to speak to Americans who, a year into the more broad based invasion that Putin launched last February, to folks here who say, why do we need to be there for so long. It still has bipartisan support in the country, in Congress, but you see some saying it's a lot of money. It's taking so long. You now have the threat of China arming Russia. The expansion of this conflict here. Explain to folks watching at home why this fight is their fight. 
 
YOVANOVITCH: Yes. That is such an important question. And I really think that President Zelenskyy, as so often happens, said it best when he addressed Congress and said that, you know, this is -- our assistance to Ukraine is not a charity. Our assistance is an investment in American security, in global security. And I think that is absolutely right. Because Putin - I mean make no mistake, he wants to expand the Russian empire. He wants to, you know, put his mark on history by incorporating Ukraine into an enlarged Russian empire. 
 
But it is also about going further. I mean that has been what he has done over his 20 plus years in power. That's what he said he wants to do. I mean just on Tuesday, in his address to the Russian people, he talked - he talked about historically Russian lands, which is code not just for Ukraine but for further west. We need to believe him when he says things like this. And I think from an American perspective it is far better for us to help Ukraine as much as we can, as fast as we can, so that they are victorious in pushing Russia back from Ukrainian lands and that Russia understands that this is not the way to go in the international system so that we don't have to confront Russia at some later point at a time and a place that may not be to our advantage. 
 
SCIUTTO: As you know, U.S. officials here are warning that China is considering, at least, providing lethal assistance to Russia in its ongoing war against Ukraine. And they've begun to speak about what the consequences might be. We heard from the Treasury secretary today talking about economic consequences for China. 
 
What is your view how China views this war, even as difficult as it's been for Russia. Does it look to Ukraine an see an opportunity to distract the U.S. and the west from countering China in Asia? 
 
YOVANOVITCH: That's certainly a possibility. I think Russia is also -- I'm sorry, China is also learning certain lessons from what is happening between Russia and Ukraine. And I think we need to take that very much to heart because if Russia gets away with it in Ukraine, I think China will think, well, maybe there are possibilities for us in Taiwan or in other places. 
 <br>[09:25:02] So, we need to be - you know, we really need to stick to our policy and be firm. 
 
SCIUTTO: Well, Marie Yovanovitch, good to see you there in the Ukrainian capital a year since the invasion. Thanks so much for joining us this morning. 
 
YOVANOVITCH: Thank you. 
 
SCIUTTO: Well, be sure to tune in to CNN tonight, Fareed Zakaria, he will host top Biden national security officials Jake Sullivan and Samantha Power for a CNN town hall, "Russia's Invasion of Ukraine: One Year Later." That is at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time. 
 
FISHER: But any moment now, the Murdaugh murder trial is going to resume in South Carolina where Alex Murdaugh, you can see him right there, expected to take the stand in his own defense. We'll take you there live, next.
