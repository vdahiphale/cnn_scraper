UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is CNN Breaking News. 
 
JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN ANCHOR: Hello and welcome to our viewers from all around the world. I'm Julia Chatterley in New York. Let's get straight to our breaking news this hour. 
 
We are waiting for a news conference to begin any moment in New Orleans where authorities are investigating what they call an actual of terrorism. The FBI just releasing new information about the driver of a truck that plowed into revelers celebrating the New Year. They say he was a US citizen from Texas and had an ISIS flag in the truck as well as weapons and a potential explosive device. Ten people were killed in the attack. At least 35 others were injured. It happened on world famous Bourbon Street in the French Quarter a few hours after midnight. Police say the driver was quote, "hell-bent" on creating carnage. They say he shot and injured two officers after ramming the crowd. 
 
Police fired back killing him at the scene. Just listen to this. Emergency radio alert moments after the attack. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Communications to Engine 29 and all units heading towards Canal and Bourbon. We were multiply grown tourists. You're responding to a mass casualty incident. A vehicle ran through a crowd of people. There's multiple injurie. Multiple casualties. They need you at Canal and Bourbon. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE) 
 
CHATTERLEY: And Ryan Young has more. 
 
RYAN YOUNG, CNN U.S. CORRESPONDENT: It's been a really hard day to go through some of these witness accounts but also to search online. And of course there is video that we'll never be able to show folks that is online right now of what this attack looked like. You can see mangled bodies everywhere. And of course witnesses have talked about that. Now we're going to show you some video. It's blurred, but you can see the chaotic nature that is right there in front of us. And there were just people strewn everywhere and folks from balconies were looking down. Some folks couldn't get out because obviously they were trying to keep them safe. But you can hear people screaming and yelling for help. You can also see people who are not responsive. 
 
Pamela Brown did an interview about an hour and a half ago and it was just gut wrenching to listen to this one witness talk about what he saw. Take a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
 
JIMMY COTHRAN, WITNESS: I mean just the disfigurement and the bodies strong. Something you can't unsee, you'll never forget. Directly at our feet was definitely a mother twisted up, obviously deceased. One gentleman, crushed, had tire tracks across his back. Once they rolled him over, he had tire tracks on his front. He was completely crushed. Another girl, young, small girl, was dancing when were coming up the street and she was just completely flat. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE) 
 
YOUNG: Let's not forget two New Orleans police officers were shot in this as well. They are in stable condition. I was talking to an officer who was nearby the scene. They said there's never seen anything like this before, that this has totally shaken them to their core. And then when you just hear about all the bodies being lined up there. As the city works to clear this scene and also take all the evidence, you understand this is going to shake people for quite some time. So many people want to know why. But at the same time, you know, there's been families that are going to be talking about this that have been ripped apart forever. 
 
CHATTERLEY: Thanks to Ryan Young there. Okay, just to reiterate, we are awaiting that press conference for later details on that New Orleans attack. So the moment that begins, we will take you there. But for now, let's just get more details. 
 
CNN senior national security analyst Juliette Kayyem. And CNN Law enforcement contributor Steve Moore, who's also a retired supervisory special agent for the FBI, joins us now. 
 
Juliet, I'll come to you first. The FBI have named an attacker. We know he was a U.S. Citizen. We also know he was carrying an ISIS flag and explosives in that truck. Just explain to us how that shifts and refrains the investigation on what happened here. Oh, I think we just lost -- we just Juliet there. 
 
Steve, I'll pose that question to you. 
 
STEVE MOORE, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT CONTRIBUTOR: Well, it's what we're seeing is some pretty obvious evidence of an individual who was potentially radicalized. And I kind of see the indications that this was a lone wolf attack. Somebody who was individually radicalized and took it upon themselves to do something extreme to fight for their cause in any way, shape, or form. And that's kind of what ISIS and other similar organizations encourage. 
 <br>[14:05:29]
 
You know, we can't do everything. You've got to take it in your -- take it in your own hands. And if you really believe in this cause, then you need to kill someone. 
 
CHATTERLEY: Just explain, Steve, why you think that. Because obviously part of this investigation will be now trying to understand whether he was acting alone, whether he had accomplices to your point, at which point perhaps then if he was working alone, there was some degree of radicalization involved in there. Steve, just again, dig deeper for me and explain your thinking. 
 
MOORE: Sure, the ISIS flag is obviously an indication of the motivation the group he affiliates with, either officially or unofficially. But things that indicate that it was to me that it was likely a lone wolf is that there was no immediate confirmation or claim of responsibility from ISIS. The other thing that groups like ISIS do is they tend to go in with more than one person and attack not just the people initially, but come in and try to keep first responders from getting there. I know this guy did that, but it wasn't the same as two or three people coming at the same time. 
 
This was a single attack. While ISIS generally likes to do larger attacks and they tend to like to use explosives more. And I know he had them in the car, but this was not and effective -- 
 
CHATTERLEY: Steve, I'm just going to interrupt you here because the press conference is beginning. Hopefully, we learn more. Let's listen in. 
 
(BEGIN LIVE COVERAGE) 
 
ALETHEA DUNCAN, FBI SPECIAL AGENT: Partners are working diligently to investigate and find answers on behalf of the victims, the citizens and residents of Louisiana, and everyone visiting the city. I'm going to provide you some facts and information about what we do know. I know that all of you will have questions and we will try to provide some answers, but this is an ongoing investigation that's rapidly evolving. So there are some questions I'll be unable to answer at this time. 
 
The FBI is the lead investigative agency and we're investigating this as an attack of terrorism along with our partners. Today at approximately 3:15 a.m. Central Standard Time, an individual drove a pickup truck into a crowd on Bourbon Street in New Orleans, killing at least 10 individuals and injuring dozens more. After hitting the crowd, he exited the vehicle and fired upon local law enforcement. 
 
Law enforcement returned fire and the subject was pronounced deceased at the scene. Two law enforcement officers were injured and transported to local hospitals. The subject has been identified as 42- year-old, Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a U.S. born citizen from Texas. He was driving a Ford pickup truck which appears to be rented. And we are working to confirm how the subject came in possession of this vehicle. 
 
An ISIS flag was located on the trailer hitch of the vehicle. And the FBI is working to determine the subject's potential associations and affiliations with terrorist organizations. Weapons, and potential improvised explosive devices. IEDs were located in the subject's vehicle. Other potential IEDs were also located in the French Quarter. As of now, two IEDs have been found and rendered safe. The FBI special
 
 agent bomb technicians as well as our local law enforcement partners have been working to determine if any of these devices are viable and they will work to render those devices safe. The FBI, we are working with our partners to investigate this as an act of terrorism. We are aggressively running down all of the leads to identify the possible subject's associates. We are working to ensure that there is no further threat. 
 
We do not believe that Jabbar was solely responsible. We are aggressively running down every lead, including those of his known associates. That's why we need the public's help. We are asking if anybody has any interactions with Shamsud-Din Jabbar in the last 72 hours that you contact us. The FBI is asking the public's help. We're asking anyone who has information, video, or pictures to provide it to the FBI. 
 
We have set up a digital tip line as well as our 1-800 number, 1-800- CALL-FBI. Please provide us with any information that can assist us in this investigation. Once again, thank you for your patience and assistance. For an updated statement or information, please check the FBI's website and our social media accounts. I will now turn over to Mayor Cantrell. 
 <br>[14:10:14]
 
LATOYA CANTRELL, NEW ORLEANS MAYOR: Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, Agent Duncan, for your leadership and the full support of the FBI. First and foremost, I want to express my deepest condolences to the families and loved ones that were impacted by this tragedy on Bourbon Street and in the heart of the city of New Orleans. And I know that the entire New Orleans City Council agrees along right with me, no doubt about that. And our people and our families. My priority will continue to be to ensure that victims that remain on Bourbon Street now will be serviced and removed as soon as possible. But as stated, the FBI is in charge of this investigation and are doing everything necessary to make this happen. 
 
I also want to acknowledge hearing from President Biden, all of our federal partners, but most importantly, calling Governor Landry this morning responded with haste. And we do say thank you. And of course, a demonstration of a unified support is right here in this room. That's how we collectively responded to this tragedy in the city of New Orleans. 
 
The mission now is to facilitate, support, and coordinate safety procedures to keep our residents and our visitors safe. I've gone to the hospital along with Chief Kirkpatrick to visit, our police officers, and considering their injuries, they're doing well. 
 
As I mentioned, this investigation is ongoing and the FBI remains the lead in the investigation. It is an active crime scene as well. We are committed, no doubt, to uncovering all details surrounding this tragedy. And we are taking every necessary step to put even more safety procedures in place, especially given the nature of the investigation. I'm going to ask people to do not go around our secured area if there
 
 is no essential need to do so. It matters. And again, it is an active crime scene. I also want you all to know that the Greater New Orleans Foundation has set up a fund to assist victims and that information will be provided to you. Thank you, GNOF. 
 
Again, I want to thank this unified team. We're leaning in. We will be relentless and we will do everything that it takes to render real justice. This team will. I want to also just thank our citizens for your heartfelt prayers. New Orleans is a world-class city and I can say that I've heard from world leaders all this morning and up until now, in addition to my brother and sister mayors across this country. They're calling, they're responding, and they're standing with the city of New Orleans and what they always say and want me to reiterate, they understand the resilience of this community and we're strong in that regard. And I will say second to none. 
 
So with that, I'm going to turn it over to our governor and as I mentioned, who has not wavered any in leaning in providing the necessary support and standing right here with me. And I say thank you, Governor. And I know the first lady is standing with us as well. 
 
JEFF LANDY, LOUISIANA GOVERNOR: Thank you, Madam Mayor. Thank you. Again, I want to thank the mayor. Since about 3:45 this morning when she called me, we have all been working just around the clock to both secure the city and to solve this act. You know, again, I want to reiterate that our prayers go out with all of those who have been affected by this tragedy. I want to thank our law enforcement officers, I want to thank our medical personnel, I want to thank our first responders. And most importantly, I want to thank the two New Orleans police officers who not only laid their life on the line but were able to eliminate the threat this morning. 
 <br>[14:15:12]
 
Let me say we have made public safety a state priority from day one. And I think that if you look around me today, right now, and you look at the people who are standing around, that is their commitment as well. We intend to be transparent in assessing any defects that may have existed in the system so that we can address it. It's the only way to ensure that any mistakes that were made are corrected. Specifically, we have been trying and working very diligently to address security concerns in preparation for the Super Bowl since October. And it's interesting because -- or ironically, in preparation for the Super Bowl, I had intended to issue emergency declaration tomorrow so that we could bring all of our federal, state, and local agencies to bear in preparation for the Super Bowl and Mardi Gras. But because of the events today, I have amended that emergency declaration and issued it today. 
 
 So again, that declaration will allow our federal, state, and local partners to bring all of the resources necessary to get this city safe. In light of that executive order, I have also ordered the mobilization of a military police company. I have asked General Friloux to mobilize a military police company to assist both New Orleans Police and LSP and the FBI. It is important for our citizens and guests of this state to know that we are doing everything we can to secure their safety in this city. 
 
We want to make it clear, the superdome and the surrounding area is safe. But I've always said that the safety of this entire city is something that is always paramount to me. With that, I would like to turn it over to Jeff with the Super Bowl. 
 
JEFF HUNDLEY, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, ALLSTATE SUGAR BOWL: Good afternoon. Obviously, we wish weren't here for this reason today. The Super Bowl committee has a 90-year history of being a good corporate citizen for the city of New Orleans. And that's why this tragedy hurts us as much as anybody right now. So our condolences, thoughts and prayers go out to the victims and their families as we all work through this. 
 
Of course, anytime we have a major event in the city of New Orleans, public safety is paramount. And we have full faith and confidence in the governor and the mayor and all the assets, the federal, state, and local resources that they've applied to this event so that we can ultimately bring those responsible to justice and carry on with the major events that we have in front of us. 
 
Speaking of which, were scheduled this evening to have a CFP quarterfinal played in the Superdome at 7:45, we have been in consultation with ESPN, with the College Football Playoff, with the Southeastern Conference, with the University of Georgia, with Notre Dame, all parties and all agree that it's in the best interest of everybody in public safety that we postpone the game for 24 hours. Work is fast about to set up a safe and efficient and fun environment for tomorrow night. There will be more details on that in the coming hours. But for now that's the plan that we're going to move forward and play the game. 
 
And again, we reiterate our thanks to everyone up here for the important work they're doing. We live in the fun and games world with what we do. But we certainly recognize the importance of this and we're going to support it 100 percent so thank you. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'd like to bring up Senator Kennedy. 
 
JOHN NEELY KENNEDY, UNITED STATES SENATOR: I wish -- I wish I understood better why bad things happen to good people. If -- if I make it to heaven, I'm going to ask. 
 <br>[14:20:00]
 
For those people who don't believe in objective evil, all you have to do is look at what happened in our city early this morning. I am -- if this doesn't trigger the gag reflex of every American, every fair minded American, I'd be very surprised. I'm here because these are my people. I'm here because these are my people's friends. I'm here because there are a lot of Louisianans that are scared tonight. I don't want them to be there. 
 
There's a lot of information going around. Some of it is actually true, some of it isn't. The Federal Government is now in charge of this investigation. By that I mean, the White House, the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Justice. I have not talked to the FBI. Maybe they've talked to my staff, I don't know. 
 
I did talk to the Secretary of Homeland Security a little while ago. And I told him that with all the respect I could muster, that we expect to put the full force and resources of the Federal Government behind this investigation. Our state troopers, our local police departments, our sheriffs, we've got many sheriffs here today, have been terrific so far. The Federal Government is cooperating with them. I hope that will continue. Here's what I want to ask from the Federal Government. 
 
Catch these people. Catch these people and then tell the American people the truth. Now, I don't want you to tell us yet anything that's going to interfere with your investigation. And there are things that I've been told that I think are true that I'm not sharing with you today because it could interfere with their investigation. 
 
But after we get to the bottom of this, they need to tell the American people the truth and the people of New Orleans, the truth, and the people of America the truth. I think the Mayor and the Governor are very wise to postpone this ball game for 24 hours. There's just too much stuff we don't know and it's just not worth it. But I guess my final point is I will promise you this. I will, when it is appropriate and this investigation is complete, you will find out what happened and who was responsible or I will raise fresh hell. And I will chase those in the Federal Government who are responsible for telling us what happened like they stole Christmas. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you, Senator Kennedy. Congressman Carter. 
 
REP. TROY CARTER, (D) LOUISINA: Thank you, Governor. Thank you, Mayor. Thank you, Senator Kennedy. Thank you to all of our law enforcement agents for doing a yeoman's job, for stepping up at a time when we needed you most, for employing the resources of all of our partners. This is all hands-on deck from the White House all the way down. I've been in communication with the White House since early this morning, Secretary Mayorkas leaders in all of our federal, local and state agencies. The President has made it very clear that he intends to bring every resource to bear to not only tell the truth, but to provide the resources to bring these cowards to justice. 
 
I want to personally thank the men and women in uniform who put their lives on the line to protect our citizens and our visitors. To our mayor and our governor for acting expeditiously and bringing us all together, to our sheriffs from the surrounding areas who have been Johnny on the spot, recognizing that if it happens in New Orleans, it can happen anywhere. We don't have the luxury of being myopic. In this community, we work together. We don't point fingers. We don't blame. We go after the bad guys. 
 
Let it be clear that the full faith and credit of the United States and every agency therein is on the ground working. And for those who may have played a role in this horrific act of cowardice, we will find you. We will bring you to justice. New Orleans is a place that heralds its ability to protect its citizens, that heralds its ability to manage major events. Super Bowls, Sugar Bowls, Mardi Gras, Jazz Fest, Essence Festival, you name it. No one does it better than law enforcement in New Orleans and in the surrounding area. 
 <br>[14:25:18]
 
Kudos to those two officers who have been wounded. Our hearts go out to those who lost loved ones. Our hearts go out to those who are wounded and on the men in the hospital. Citizens, now is the time to stay calm, to be vigilant. This is not a time to come out to sightsee. Listen to your federal, local, state officials. Be vigilant. If you saw something, say something. If you know something, tell someone. There are tip lines, there's information available. Please, all hands- on deck. 
 
Rest assured that the decision that was made to postpone the game was not done lightly. It was done with one single thing in public safety. Making sure that the citizens and visitors of this great city, not only for this event but for every event you come to in Louisiana, that you will be safe. And we will use every resource possible. As the Governor has said, as the mayor has said and every law enforcement agent here has said, our energy, our commitment will be to make sure that you are safe now and for every event in the future. God bless you and let's stay strong. 
 
CANTRELL: Thank you, Congressman. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Attorney General. 
 
LIZ MURRILL, ATTORNEY GENERAL, LOUISIANA: I first want to extend my sincerest condolences to the families of the victims. Parents got a phone call last night, this morning, early this morning that no parent ever wants to receive. And as a parent and a parent of children who come to New Orleans and spend time here, I know that is just something that, you know, we cross -- we hold our breath sometimes until they're home safe and some people did not come home safe. And we also have some people who are fighting for their lives right now in the hospital. So I'd ask everyone to pray for them. They need our support and they need our prayers. This was a heinous act, a heinous, cowardly act, and we will find them and we will bring them to justice. 
 
My office will be providing both investigative and prosecutorial support to the City of New Orleans, to the District Attorney Jason Williams in New Orleans as I have done for months and we will continue to do that. We will provide the Governor with whatever support that he needs and the office of -- the Governor's Office of Homeland Security, whatever support that they need. I'll be here to help. I will be here to stand with the City of New Orleans. We will bring them to justice. Thank you. 
 
CANTRELL: Thank you. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you. 
 
CANTRELL: Thank you, Governor.
 
SUPERINTENDENT ANNE KIRKPATRICK, NEW ORLEANS POLICE DEPARTMENT: Thank you, Governor and Madam Mayor. For those who do not know me. My name is Ann Kirkpatrick. I'm the Chief of Police of New Orleans. My title, official title is superintendent but my role is as chief of police. 
 
You know, you've heard some of the details today and over the last 24 hours, we had approximately 400 officers in the French Quarter. And as we know, this is not just an act of terrorism. This is evil and when we face evil, we have a choice. We can run in fear, or we can indeed stand in strength. In a time of crisis, people are looking for leadership. You are looking at the leadership. And I promise you as the Chief of Police of this city, this city has been tried by fire before but fire purifies. Fire makes things stronger. 
 
We have a plan. We know what to do. We are going to get these people. There is a path forward. I'm very pleased that we will be back to having a wonderful game tomorrow night. New Orleans police have proven their ability to make the city safer. Just two years ago, we were the murder capital of America. Today, from that time two years ago, we have driven our murder rate more than 50 percent down. So we have a track record, but this is different because it's terrorism. 
 
Now, I want to thank all of our law enforcement partners. You're fabulous, and we appreciate the partnership. But last night, three of our officers engaged this terrorist who shot at them. Three of the officers returned fire. Those officers did not run in fear. I liked what the mayor said this morning. New Orleans police and all law enforcement is built. We are built for dealing with evil, with things that would cause us others to be in fear. But instead, our officers, and last night, NOPD particular, stood strong. They did not run. They did kill the terrorists. We have two officers indeed who received gunfire. They will be okay. We have personally gone to see them. But this is leadership for you. And I promise as the chief of police of this fantastic city that I will be strong and firm and fearless. Thank you. 
 
CANTRELL: Thank you, Chief. 
 
LANDRY: Thank you. In wrapping it up, I want to just close with a couple of things. I want to thank Senator Kennedy and Congressman Carter. I want to thank again all of our law enforcement officers out there. I want the families of the victims to know that I will be issuing an executive order that tomorrow when Notre Dame plays Georgia, every flag of every state building in this state is going to be at half max in remembrance of them but remembering something else. That fear in this state is a liar. And these folks right here are going to make sure that justice is served. 
 
And for the citizens out there that were saying, well, man, do I really want to go to the Sugar Bowl tomorrow? You could. I tell you one thing, your governor is going to be there. That is proof, believe you me, that facility in this city is safer today than it was yesterday. And we are in as we come to additional events in this city. I know in speaking with Senator Kennedy and Congressman Carter and FBI acting director and incoming administration that they are going to ensure that this city has the resources necessary to protect our citizens and our guests. And so with that, we'll take some questions. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: All right, if you could, we'll start over here with CBS Katie. We'll work our way across the room. If I miss you, just give me a holler. I may not see you. Go ahead, Katie. 
 
KATIE WEISS, CBS NEWS REPORTER: Thank you, sir. Katie Weiss with CBS News. I mean, I think this has been a really tough day for a lot of people, but at this point, we're hearing that the death toll according to some FBI sources, has gone up to 15. Is this true? 
 
LANDRY: Who wants to answer the question? 
 
KIRKPATRICK: Do you have A final note? We do not have a final number. We know that we have confirmed 10. But we did have people who had been transported who were in critical condition. And so I do not know that, but I can confirm 10. 
 
WEISS: And one quick follow-up question, if I may. We know that there have been some local records in Texas about misdemeanor background on this suspect. Any signs or warnings ahead of time about this person or their plans for what happened this morning? 
 
KIRKPATRICK: Because that is the investigation part I will give the FBI. 
 
DUNCAN: At this time, we cannot go into details about the subject's history. What I can tell you the person was an army veteran. We believe he was honorary discharged. But we're working through this process figuring out all this information. The goal with the FBI is providing you with the most accurate and complete information. So once that information is confirmed, we'll make sure we push that out. Thank you. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Arielle (ph). 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: At this time, do you know exactly as far as the victims, how many are from here in Louisiana versus out of state? And their ages maybe? 
 
DUNCAN: At this time I can't go into details about all the victims. We want to make sure that first that the family is notified appropriately before we put any information out there. So once the families are all notified, then we'll go ahead and release a statement to everyone. 
 
LANDRY: And I would ask the press when in relation to the victims and those that in hospital, if we could just refrain from worrying about them so their loved ones.</pre>
