THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:01:41]
 
BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: Hurricane Helene bearing down on Florida town orders -- towns ordering evacuations as forecasters worry that it could be the biggest storm to hit the U.S. in a year. We're just moments away from an update of this potential track. 
 
And a candid conversation with President Biden. He goes on The View explaining why he thinks he would have won the election, but still understands the calls for him to step aside. 
 
JIM ACOSTA, CNN HOST: And close call. Congress might be able to avoid a government shutdown before the election, but lawmakers will need to find a Christmas miracle to keep everything open into the New Year. We are following these major developing stories and many more, all coming in right here to CNN News Central.
 
KEILAR: We begin this hour with a major hurricane that is barreling towards the U.S. We're talking about Hurricane Helene, expected to make landfall on Florida's Gulf coast tomorrow night. Right now, mandatory evacuation orders are in effect in parts of 15 counties with much of the state set to be impacted. And we've already seen a glimpse of the storm's power as Cancun got a lashing by strong winds, heavy rain as the hurricane made its way into the gulf. 
 
We have meteorologist Elisa Raffa, who is in the CNN Extreme Weather Center monitoring everything. How are you tracking this thing? Where's it headed? 
 
ELISA RAFFA, METEOROLOGIST: I mean, it's still bringing some tropical storm force in hurricane force winds to Cancun and then even stretching as Far East there is Havana, Cuba, but it will head towards the Gulf coast as we go into tomorrow. Right now, it's a Category 1 hurricane with 80 miles per hour wind sitting 480 miles south and west there of Tampa Bay. 
 
But as it makes its track north, we are sitting in very warm, near record warm ocean temperatures. This has been the mantra in the story all year, rapid intensification. It already rapidly intensified yesterday. And we'll do it again because we're looking at water temperatures in the upper 80s, middle 80s, that is fuel for this storm. Gives it more moisture, gives it more punch. So we are looking at it intensifying possibly to a Category 3
 
 hurricane making landfalls somewhere on that big bend where you see that red. Those are hurricane warnings somewhere by Thursday night. But look at all the blue, those are tropical storm warnings, and in fact, for the entire peninsula of Florida because this storm will be incredibly wide. 
 
We have tropical storm watches in effect as far north as Atlanta where we could still find some pretty damaging wind gusts along with some incredibly heavy rain. When it comes to the storm surge, we have a very wide wind field with this, so that's going to take that ocean water and slosh it inland. So we're looking at 10 to 15 feet of storm surge in that big bend of Florida from Cedar Key. Some five to eight feet of storm surge possible in Tampa Bay. 
 
So again, a lot of ocean water pushing inland on the entire west coast. And it's because we have this massive wind field that's just going to take again all that ocean water and the damaging winds as well. We're looking at some widespread power outages, not just for Florida but for a lot of the southeast. Looking at these winds up to 110 miles per hour near the site of landfall in that big bend there in Florida. 
 
But look at how far north this intense wind stretch. Could be looking at wind speeds up to 73 miles per hour, again, as far north as Atlanta. So really taking a lot of this with it very far inland. When it comes to the rain, we are looking at a very large footprint of heavy rain. A lot of us across the southeast seeing four to eight inches of rain. 
 <br>[14:05:03]
 
But look at this area right here in the southern Appalachians, Northern Georgia. That tip there of north and South Carolina could be looking at some rain totals up to a foot in the heart of the mountains, so concerned about landslides there as well. We have two days of a high-risk of heavy rain. 
 
That is the highest level of warning for excessive flooding again today and tomorrow in that spot there in the southern Appalachians where we're worried about extensive heavy rain that could again lead to landslides. So this will be not just a Florida storm, but pushing far inland. Brianna?
 
KEILAR: Yeah, it's a very good point, Elisa. Travel is going to be impacted and people need to plan accordingly. Jim? 
 
ACOSTA: Yeah, it looks like a big storm. We'll be watching it, Brianna. Thank you. President Biden, in the meantime, making headlines today after sitting down with the cohosts of ABC's views, saying he's confident he would have beaten former President Trump in November, but at peace with his decision to exit the race. Let's go to M.J. Lee over at the White House. M.J., what more did the president have to say? 
 
M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Jim, you know, whether the White House is using this precise description or not, the President is clearly on his legacy tour. It's not clear that he would have sat down for a live interview on The View where he's still seeking a second term. 
 
And it is one of the many things that we are seeing him do in recent days to try to set the record straight, to burnish his legacy, and also put in a good word for his Vice President, Kamala Harris, who, of course, is the new Democratic nominee. It's been two months since the President dropped out. And he did say in this interview that he was at peace with that difficult decision. 
 
He also said that ultimately, age was a deciding factor. And when it comes to his Vice President seeking the presidency, he said that he believes that she has what it takes to defeat Donald Trump, and that the one piece of advice he would have for her is to stay true to herself. And he, again, interestingly noted that it wasn't because he thought that he was going to be defeated by Donald Trump that he decided to drop out of the race.
 
Take a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: And although the polling, they said Biden's polling was different. The fact of the matter is my polling was about, you know, we were always within range of being this guy. But what I did was, I think there were -- it makes sense. There are some folks who would like to see me step aside so they have a chance to move on. I get that. That's just human nature.
 
WOMAN #1: Mr. President, do you think (inaudible) you stayed in the race, would you have won? 
 
BIDEN: Yes. I was confident I would beat Trump. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
LEE: President Biden, of course, is in New York City to attend the United Nations General Assembly. We saw him yesterday giving his final sort of farewell speech of sorts to that body. And looming over this entire week, of course, has been the escalating tensions and hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah. 
 
And he did say in this interview on The View that he believes that an all-out war is possible, but that there is still a window to try to avoid that scenario. We, of course, have reported that U.S. officials are scrambling to see if that can be avoided.
 
But the other thing that we have noted, Jim, and we have reported is that U.S. officials here in the administration, they have all but paused, making an effort to try to get a ceasefire deal across the finish line, believing that there is currently no political will on either side, that is Israel or Hamas. So this is one way in which we are seeing the situation in Lebanon really complicating what is clearly one of the most important foreign policy legacy pieces for the President as he's staring down the final months of his presidency, Jim. 
 
ACOSTA: All right. M.J. Lee, a critical moment for the President. Thank you very much. Over to you, Brianna.
 
KEILAR: All right. Let's talk about this with CNN Senior Political Commentator and cohost of The View, Ana Navarro. All right. Anna, first I want to listen to how President Biden answered a question about the appearance of him being forced out of the race in his current relationship with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Here it is.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BIDEN: Our relationship is fine. Look, I never fully believed the assertions that somehow there was this overwhelming reluctance of my running again. I didn't sense that. And although the polling, they said the Biden's polling was different, the fact of the matter is my polling was about, you know, we were always within range of beating this guy. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KEILAR: I don't know, Anna, maybe the relationship isn't fine. I wonder what you made of his answer there. The part about Pelosi, but also the part about what he thought about if he'd stayed in. 
 
ANA NAVARRO, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, the part about Pelosi, look, I've known Joe Biden for a very long time, upwards of 25 years. And he really doesn't hold the grudge. And he's a good guy. He kind of lets things go. 
 <br>[14:10:01]
 
I think he's let this go. That doesn't mean the people around him have let it go or will ever let it go. That doesn't mean that it didn't hurt him. That doesn't mean that he liked the way it happened. But I don't think that Joe Biden is a guy that goes around with a chip on his shoulder and with grievances. You know, he's got way too much to do. I think he's still looking forward to the next several months that he has as president, and he's looking forward to the next chapter of his life. 
 
We talked about the Biden Center, the University of Delaware, what he's going to do at Penn State. So I think he's looking forward to playing some golf. He's only played 21 holes of golf, he told me this entire administration. So I think. I think he is -- I think he's okay with Nancy Pelosi. Doesn't mean that they've spoken, but I think he's okay with it. 
 
KEILAR: All right. Okay. So let's listen to how he talked about getting out of the race and how -- wait, what'd you say? 
 
NAVARRO: How's that for a political answer? 
 
KEILAR: Yup, I'm picking up what you're putting down. All right, let's listen to what he said about getting out of the race, how his age played a role. I thought this was really interesting. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BIDEN: There are some folks who would like to see me step aside so they have a chance to move on. I get that. That's just human nature. But that wasn't the reason that I stepped down. I stepped down because I started thinking about it. You know, it's hard to think -- I know you're only 30, but it's hard to think of -- it's hard for me to even say how old I am. No, I'm serious. I don't know (inaudible).
 
WOMAN #2: Why is that?
 
BIDEN: I give my word. It's like, holy God, that can't be right. That's just can't -- 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KEILAR: I feel that way about my birthday every year these days, Ana. But I wonder what you thought about him saying that. 
 
NAVARRO: I think he's being very honest and blunt about it. I mean, you know, he's self-deprecating. And Joe Biden has always used self- deprecating humor. But I think he's kind of talking the truth there, right? Like he's 81 years old. I don't think he feels 81. I don't think he sees of himself as 81. But he's 81. And he's, you know, had to come to terms with that and accept the reality. 
 
And, you know, Brianna, actually, I remember him telling me something very similar to that. He couldn't believe his age four years ago when he was running. Look, I think it happens quick, comes at you quick. One moment, we're 25, next minute we're 85.  It comes at you quick. And I think it's come at him quick. 
 
KEILAR: Yeah, I do believe that. You asked him about his legacy. Do you think this was a bit of an exit interview? 
 
NAVARRO: You know, I think it was. First, let me tell you that this was interview number 10 of Joe Biden on The View. This is a place that he's come to as a candidate, as a senator, as a vice president, and now as sitting president. You know, he actually was there. And one of the things he really wanted to talk about was the 30th anniversary of the Violence Against Women's Act. He considers it his greatest legislative accomplishment, something he's very proud of. 
 
And that has changed America for the better. That's what he was there to talk about. But I do think that he, you know, I do think that he wants to show himself, support Kamala Harris, show that he's at peace with this decision. And I think he's setting an example for passing the torch. 
 
I think he's setting an example for putting your country first. Like he has said now several times, he loved this job. He loves sitting behind the resolute desk and being president of the United States, but he loves his country more. And I think that's what he was there to tell us. And I also think part of what he wants to do as he's, you know, about to leave a 50-year career in public service is call to America's better angels, and remind us of the opportunities and possibilities of America when we are united. 
 
KEILAR: I don't want to -- he clearly feels comfortable that this is a friendly place. You see that in this conversation. Sometimes, those are the environments that actually can be tough for some of the answers. And one that I wondered what you thought about was Joy Behar asking Biden about Trump's very charged rhetoric about his political opponents, the blame that Trump places on Biden and Harris's rhetoric for these assassination attempts against him.
 
Biden, you know, he has spoken out against rhetoric in the past or said that there's no place for this political violence. 
 <br>[14:15:09]
 
He didn't condemn it in his answer. And I wonder if you think he just needs to say a little bit more when he's talking about these things in this environment. 
 
NAVARRO: You know, he has certainly condemned -- has condemned some of the things that Donald Trump has done and said. He talked about January 6th and just what a bizarre experience it was, what he was doing at the time. You know, I don't know that it's for Joe Biden at this point to take on Donald Trump. 
 
That's what Kamala Harris is doing and what Kamala Harris campaign is doing. And it's kind of like a weird answer, Brianna, because on the one hand, you know, you're condemning divisive political and hostile political rhetoric, but at the same time, you have to condemn your opponent, your former opponent, Donald Trump, who commits that. And, you know, it's kind of that fine line to walk. 
 
KEILAR: Yeah, we're seeing that be tricky for, I think, many people as they are trying to answer that kind of question. Ana, it was really interesting to watch. Really appreciate it. Thanks so much for coming on to talk with us about it. 
 
NAVARRO: Thank you, Brianna.
 
KEILAR: And you can catch Ana's new episode of the whole story with Anderson Cooper, The Latino Vote. That will be Sunday night at 08:00 p.m. Ana will be looking at why former President Trump appeals to so many Latino voters as she spends time in immigrant communities, including in her hometown, Miami, where Cuban Americans have historically largely supported Trump at the polls. 
 
And still ahead, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy sounding the nuclear alarm at the United Nations, saying that Vladimir Putin is planning to attack Ukraine's nuclear infrastructure. How his speech is being received and what could happen next. 
 
Plus, a new FAA report finds Boeing workers were pressure to prioritize speed over quality and did not get proper job training. It's nine months after a door plug blowout on that 737 Max. We'll be breaking down the details of that report. 
 
And public schools in California must now restrict students' use of cell phones. We're joined by one school principal on how it's going and if it's improving kids' learning. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ACOSTA: Ukrainian President Zelenskyy is warning of a potential nuclear disaster. Today, he gave a major address to the United Nations General Assembly saying he's concerned Russia is planning to attack his country's nuclear power plants and disconnect them from the energy grid. Zelenskyy also had this impassioned plea hoping to rally global support for Ukraine. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT: I want peace for my people, real peace and just peace. And I am asking for your support from all nations of the world. We do not divide the world. I ask the same of you, do not divide the world. Be United Nations. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ACOSTA: All right. Zelenskyy's address to world leaders comes just before he meets with President Biden to discuss what Zelenskyy calls his victory plan for the war. It's expected to include his request for permission to use long range missiles for airstrikes deep inside Russia. With us now is the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, William Taylor.
 
Bill, good to see you. I guess I want to talk about that long range missile issue in just a moment. But J.D. Vance, Donald Trump's vice presidential running mate, was asked earlier today on a call with reporters if Ukraine should cede land in exchange for ending the war. Vance said, quote, "everything is going to be on the table. 
 
Nothing is going to definitely be on the table." He says, "that's why you have a negotiation, especially with a guy who is as skilled as Donald Trump." Bill, I mean, you worked in this region. You know it so well. What would this involve, ceding land and some sort of peace deal with Putin? I mean, it sounds like that's what Putin wants. 
 
WILLIAM TAYLOR, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO UKRAINE: It's clearly what Putin wants.
 
ACOSTA: Yeah. 
 
TAYLOR: Putin has made it very clear, Jim, what he wants is to take back Ukraine, back into the soviet empire, back into the Russian empire. That's what he has said he is after. He says that there is no such thing as Ukraine, so he can just take it back. So that's what he wants. And President Zelenskyy is the President of a real nation, of a sovereign nation, has borders that everybody recognizes. 
 
And he is not going to give up on those borders. He has said, Jim, that there are ways to get that back, to get the Russians out. And part of that is militarily. and that has to do with these long range fires and other things we'll talk about. But it also has to do diplomatically. And diplomatically, he has said he's going to take -- he's never going to give up claim to those internationally recognized borders. 
 
ACOSTA: Because that could just open up a Pandora's Box, not just for Ukraine, but not for Europe. 
 
TAYLOR: All over the world. Exactly right.
 
ACOSTA: China, everything. 
 
TAYLOR: In Africa. Exactly right.
 
ACOSTA: Yeah. And Zelenskyy meets with Biden and Harris this week to lay out what he calls his victory plan. Part of that, I assume, involves the Biden administration, giving the green light to Zelenskyy to use these long range missiles. 
 <br>[14:25:04]
 
We hear this talked about. Why is that important? Why is that critical to all of this? 
 
TAYLOR: It's critical in order to disrupt the Russian ability to continue their attack. I mean, they are taking off from airfields. Now, they've moved some of their airplanes back away from these long range missiles. But they have ammo dumps that we've seen the Ukrainians go after successfully as well. This ability to shoot deep will disrupt the Russian's ability to attack Ukraine. 
 
ACOSTA: Do you think they should do it? Do you think the administration should do this? 
 
TAYLOR: I absolutely do. 
 
ACOSTA: Yeah. 
 
TAYLOR: My sense is they're close to that decision. They've been sending those signals for a couple of weeks now that they're looking at it very carefully. I think they're real close. 
 
ACOSTA: Well, and what was your response to what Zelenskyy was talking about at the United Nations today? I mean, he was almost issuing sort of a nuclear emergency. What did you take away from that? 
 
TAYLOR: I took away that he is sounding the alarm. He's bringing the attention of the world back to this fight that the Russians are doing. It's very serious if the Russians are going to attack a nuclear power plant. 
 
ACOSTA: You don't take this as bluster? 
 
TAYLOR: I don't take it as bluster on the part of Zelenskyy. No. I mean, I'm sure he has -- we know that the Russians have attacked all of the electricity, generation operations. And they haven't yet gone after the nuclear power plants. Zelenskyy is saying that could be next.
 
ACOSTA: And a new aid package and potential billions more are on the way before the end of the month. How critical is that money right now for the Ukrainians? 
 
TAYLOR: It's critical. Both the military weapons, ammunition is important. It needs to continue to come. But as critical is the funds for the government of Ukraine to keep going, to have first responders for hospitals, for doctors. That's important for the government to continue. 
 
ACOSTA: And one thing that we've seen in all of this is how brave and courageous the Ukrainians have been since all of this got started. It's just been (inaudible).
 
TAYLOR: (Inaudible) should track. They've been fighting now for 944 days, 944 days. That's a long time to be fighting the Russians.
 
ACOSTA: And still taking the fight to the Russians. 
 
TAYLOR: And still taking the fight to them. 
 
ACOSTA: All right. Ambassador William Taylor, as always, thank you so much. 
 
Still ahead, a damning report. Boeing factory workers say, they felt pressured to prioritize speed over quality when building the -- a planes that we fly in. The biggest revelations from that report coming up. 
 
Plus, some must see video how a dog was rescued after being snatched by a coyote. And you have to see who the dog's owners were. Stay tuned for that.
