VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Sportswear company. They are saying that they're already buying stuff for next fall just to try to avoid these tariffs. 
 
KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR: Yes.
 
YURKEVICH: So, you have a lot of companies already making preparations. We know that President-elect Trump could change his mind. The tariffs could be less. They could be more. But just the threat of that is going to have a significant impact for consumers. 
 
BOLDUAN: Well, here's the thing, though. Where there may be, I'll call it squishiness or vagaries around some of Donald Trump's policies during the campaign, there - this was clear as day what he was - he's been promising when it came to tariffs. I mean it was - for perspective it's like the level not seen since the depression, right? 
 
YURKEVICH: Right. And don't forget, in his first term, he put a ton of tariffs in place. So, you already have so much of corporate America -
 
BOLDUAN: And that's the - that's the backdrop against which the history that Walmart's talking about, right?
 
YURKEVICH: Yes. Right, they're already experiencing tariffs on so many of the products that they import already. And for the average American consumer, this is going to cost us $2,600 more each year just to keep up with the tariffs. That's not nothing for Americans who already feel like they're still struggling with the high cost of living. $2,600 is Christmas presents shopping for people who are buying for their whole entire family. Christmas dinner. So, it's going to make an impact. We'll just have to see how much.
 
BOLDUAN: And what Trump does with this promise. 
 
YURKEVICH: Who knows.
 
BOLDUAN: Thank you so much, Vanessa. 
 
A new hour of CNN NEWS CENTRAL starts now.
 
JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: We are standing by to see if the House Ethics Committee today releases its report into ex-Congressman Matt Gaetz, after we learned that overnight two women testified he paid them $10,000 for sex. 
 
Happening now, the defense about to present its case in the trial for the man accused of killing Georgia nursing student Laken Riley. Who they may call to the stand. 
 
And Thanksgiving is just around the corner. I know because I'm hosting a whole Thanksgiving special that morning. But aside from that, new data on how much all the food will cost. 
 
I'm John Berman, with Sara Sidner and Kate Bolduan. This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL.
 
SARA SIDNER, CNN ANCHOR: Happening now, a lot is about to go down on Capitol Hill. Really a flurry of high-stakes meetings with President- elect Donald Trump's embattled pick for attorney general, potentially now just hours away from the release of a potentially damaging ethics report. 
 
Today, the House Ethics Committee will meet to decide whether or not they will release their report into now former Congressman Matt Gaetz. A report we learned overnight now includes testimony from two women who say Gaetz paid them more than $10,000 for sex. 
 
All this as Gaetz soon holds meetings of his own with GOP senators on The Hill. This alongside incoming Vice President J.D. Vance. 
 
Let's bring in Alayna Treene. 
 
Alayna, a huge focus, of course, on Gaetz today. And there's also a lot of new laundry list of what you may call unconventional names that are dropping for post. 
 
What is the latest on this, as we are watching this pressure campaign from Gaetz himself and from J.D. Vance and from Donald Trump?
 
ALAYNA TREENE, CNN REPORTER: That's right. I'll quickly start with what's going on with Matt Gaetz, because there's a lot of pressure happening from Trump world to The Hill right now, particularly on the Republican senators who are going to be involved in his cabinet picks confirmation processes. 
 
And Donald Trump has made very clear in personal phone calls to many of these senators that he wants Gaetz to be confirmed, that he wants their support.
 
I find it fascinating - we were the ones who broke the news yesterday - that J.D. Vance is going to personally be sitting in on the meeting with Matt Gaetz, but also in some of these meetings with senators and Pete Hegseth, Donald Trump's pick for Department of Defense. I think, overall, there is no question that they are really trying to lobby these members to get behind Donald Trump. And Donald Trump has made clear that he is digging in. He has no plans to back away from his choice in Matt Gaetz, which, of course, remember, is the most important role for Donald Trump. Attorney general is the role that Donald Trump believed was the most important in his next administration. And that is why he is really 100 percent in on making sure Matt Gaetz gets through. 
 
But I do want to talk about these cabinet positions that we learned of overnight, because we are really seeing Donald Trump move on this at a pace that is pretty unheard of. We had not seen, you know, Barack Obama or Joe Biden move at such a pace. 
 
Now, we learned that Linda McMahon, and we were the first to report this as well, is going to be the Education secretary. There's a lot of interesting things when it comes to his choice in McMahon. One, she is the co-chair for his current transition process, but she was also very close with Donald Trump over the years. She served in his first term as the head of the Small Business Administration. She also was a former CEO of WWE, which she founded with her husband, Vince McMahon. 
 <br>[09:05:05]
 
And also she, in the years since, has been very loyal to Donald Trump. She was serving on the board of the America First Policy Institute, which was kind of called as a White House in waiting. Very unclear exactly whether or not she has the credentials for the Education Department. 
 
But really keep in mind that Donald Trump has talked about wanting to dismantle it over the entire campaign trail. So, there's going to be a lot of changes at the Education Department that she will be overseeing. 
 
Another big pick, of course, is Doctor Mehmet Oz to lead the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services. Another pretty unconventional choice with that.
 
Sara.
 
SIDNER: You got that right. Alayna Treene, thank you so much. Appreciate your reporting. 
 
Kate. 
 
BOLDUAN: Very clearly a lot happening with Trump's cabinet picks, especially when it comes to this one, Matt Gaetz.
 
Let's get over to Capitol Hill. That's where Lauren Fox is standing by. 
 
There's a lot more action that's going to be coming, Lauren. The House Ethics Committee set to meet today. Gaetz and J.D. Vance are making the rounds in the Senate today. What are you hearing from lawmakers? 
 
LAUREN FOX, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, actually I watched as Senator J.D. Vance came to Capitol Hill. In tow was Matt Gaetz, who he is going to be pushing for today to be Donald Trump's next attorney general. Joining them was Marco Rubio, a fellow Republican senator who has now been nominated to be the next secretary of state. The three of them looking really jovial as they came to Capitol Hill on the Senate side. And I will just let you know that these are a set of high stakes
 
 meetings today because there's a lot of questions that Republican senators have when it comes to whether or not they will be willing to vote for Matt Gaetz to be the next attorney general. We are told that they are going to have a slew of meetings, having conversations with senators. Obviously, the fact that two colleagues are up here today with Gaetz says a lot about potentially the relationships that those two men have in the Senate, the depth of those relationships, and the kind of argument that they may be able to make to their colleagues about why they think Gaetz should have this job.
 
Now, we also know that the House Ethics Committee, across the Capitol, is going to be meeting today, and we expect that they are going to have some discussions about how to proceed on this ethics report into Matt Gaetz. We do not know whether they will vote to release this report. We don't know if they will have a vote today to release this report. But just a really high stakes today - stakes day when it comes to the nomination of Matt Gaetz to be the next attorney general of the United States. 
 
Kate. 
 
BOLDUAN: Yes, a lot - a lot is going to be happening, and you're going to be chasing it all for us. 
 
Lauren, thank you very much.
 
John. 
 
BERMAN: All right. With us now is Congressman Sean Casten, a Democrat from Illinois.
 
Congressman, thanks so much for being with us. You have signed, actually written a letter that had about 100 people sign it to the Ethics Committee saying they should release this report on Matt Gaetz. Why did you send this letter?
 
REP. SEAN CASTEN (D-IL): Thank you. This letter could not be more important, and the issue couldn't be more important. We have the entire country in the world looking at the United States and saying, are you a country of laws? Are you a country of equal protection of the law? And they're asking those questions because the incoming president of the United States is a convicted felon. The incoming president of the United States is currently challenging almost $200 million in civil penalties, including one for an adjudicated rape.
 
We in Congress have an obligation to say we are a country of laws, and that has come to a crux in the question of, are we going to allow the attorney general, the enforcer of our laws in the country, to get a pass into the Senate without even acknowledging that he is currently under an Ethics investigation specifically for trafficking young women across state lines, allegedly, and statutory rape of a minor. These are -- these are really important questions.
 
The Ethics Committee has that report. They have taken witness testimony. And if we are a country of laws, we need to make that information public so that the Senate can carry out their advice and consent clause.
 
BERMAN: What will it tell you -- what will it tell you if the Ethics Committee decides not to release it?
 
CASTEN: It'll be a dark day. I have every confidence that the -- that the Democrats on the Ethics Committee are supported. As you know, the Ethics Committee is evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans. And the question that I think all of these picks are raising, Trump is basically daring the Republican Party, will you stand up for American values, if that means standing up to me, or will you fold like a Montgomery chair?
 
And the question before those members, particularly the Republican members of the Ethics Committee, is are you going to stand up in this moment?
 
BERMAN: Speaker Johnson says, hey, look, Gaetz is no longer in Congress, so we don't have to release this report. It's not the Ethics Committee's job to do so. What do you say to Speaker Johnson?
 <br>[09:10:01]
 
CASTEN: Look, Speaker Johnson's willingness to bow before Trump is well known. It's disappointing. But understand, there is a precedent for this. As recently as 2011, Congressman Massa, a Democrat, I would point out, from New York, was charged with sexual misconduct, was being investigated by the Ethics Committee, resigned in order to dodge that, and the Ethics Committee went ahead and completed their work. So this is not violating a precedent.
 
But largely, the precedent that's here, let's be very clear, is that someone charged with statutory rape and trafficking a minor across state lines has been nominated for Attorney General. I wish that precedent had not been set. But having set that precedent, we need to respond accordingly. And it is tragic that Speaker Johnson is unwilling to do so.
 
BERMAN: Matt Gaetz has not been charged with those things. In fact, the Justice Department --
 
CASTEN: I apologize, alleged affair.
 
BERMAN: Well, OK. Yeah. To be clear, the Justice Department did investigate and decided specifically not to charge in that case. There are allegations with the Ethics Committee was looking into. They have a report. I do understand the standards in Congress are different than the standards for the Justice Department.
 
You were bringing up Donald Trump's history and what you consider to be the rule of law. Wasn't that on the ballot? I mean, isn't that what the American people just decided to return to the White House?
 
CASTEN: Without question, that was all public information and the voters have made a decision. That does not make it right. You know, we have had any number of presidents in our past who have been on various shades of morality who have won elections. We have proceeded as a country because people fought to make -- to make what is right, also political and also morally -- that moral value has driven our country forward.
 
You know, our founders didn't think that women should vote. Our founders didn't think that African Americans should vote. The Emancipation Proclamation was an unconstitutional act. That does not make them wrong. The fact that after Abraham Lincoln, we brought in governments that rolled back Reconstruction does not make them right. History will judge us by whether we do the right thing in this moment, not whether or not we win elections.
 
BERMAN: All right, Congressman Sean Casten from Illinois, we do appreciate your time. Thank you so much for being with us.
 
CASTEN: Thank you.
 
SIDNER: It was one of the most infamous cases of the '90s. A young mother claimed she was carjacked with her two toddlers still inside the car. Then she confessed to drowning them in a lake. Right now that woman, Susan Smith, is making the case for her freedom after 30 years behind bars. 
 
And the new move by the city of Los Angeles to protect immigrants and LGBTQ youth before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. 
 
And Texas one step closer to adding Christian lessons to the curriculum for kids as young as kindergarten. Details on the key vote just hours away.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:17:41]
 
BOLDUAN: The case against Susan Smith captivated Americans 30 years ago as she was sentenced to life in prison for drowning her two young children, confessing eventually to driving into a South Carolina lake, killing her three-year-old and 14 month old. 
 
Now, any moment now, a parole hearing will begin to consider whether she should actually be released from prison. Her ex-husband is speaking out about that chance and hoping she stays behind bars.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DAVID SMITH, EX-HUSBAND OF SUSAN SMITH: A lot of people have said that she won't, and - and maybe she won't. But even knowing that there's the possibility, that there's a chance that she can get out, it scares me to death. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOLDUAN: CNN's Jean Casarez following this one for us. 
 
And, Jean, this hearing is about to get underway, specifically with her. This was a huge murder case in the '90s. What are the chances? What are you hearing about this? JEAN CASAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, I think people are shocked that she's even going before the parole board. But this was two life sentences that she received with the possibility of parole after 30 years. And 30 years is right now, today, in that courtroom before the parole board in South Carolina. 
 
You know, this case riveted the country because it was a young mother, so innocent, so naive looking. 
 
BOLDUAN: Yes.
 
CASAREZ: Two children were in her car. Her kids. Three-year-old Michael, three-month-old -- 14 months old Alex, and they were strapped to the car seats in the back of the car. And her story was that they were abducted. They were kidnaped. We would call it a carjacking. Now, with the children in the back seat. There was an artist rendering. It was a black man that she said kidnaped them. So, the country was focused for nine days -
 
BOLDUAN: Yes. Yes, that's right.
 
CASAREZ: To try to find out where the kids were. Were they alive? Who kidnaped them? 
 
But there was also a big investigation going on. And at one point it was revealed in headlines that they thought maybe she was lying. That it was a fraud. After nine days, she confessed. But you can't be convicted on a confession alone. So, it went to trial. 
 
Prosecutors said in their case that she was seeing someone else, a man, who had just broken up with her because he didn't want children in his life. And that was the motivation, according to prosecutors. She was convicted. 
 
But David Smith, her now ex-husband, is speaking out, and he is definitive and what he is scared of and what he believes in. 
 <br>[09:20:07]
 
Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DAVID SMITH, SUSAN SMITH'S EX-HUSBAND: That would be a total injustice if she was to get out.
 
It was just such a terrible thing that she did. And then her trying to get away with it for nine days, trying to lie and cover it up. I still think she - she should have got the death penalty. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CASAREZ: And this was a death penalty case, but the jury actually voted for life. 
 
You know, Kate, the parole board is going to look at any disciplinary action she had in prison. And I found this on the Department of Corrections of South Carolina.
 
BOLDUAN: Yes, like, isn't there stuff - there's stuff.
 
CASAREZ: Yes. Most recently August of this year she communicated with victims and/or witnesses of crime. Now, that is being reported out as saying it was a documentary producer that she was speaking with. But officially communication with victims or witnesses to the crime. She lost her privileges. 
 
And then there was a use of possible narcotics in 2015. There was unauthorized use of an inmate's pen, 2012. No attempted escapes at all. 
 
So, you look at these and you say, well, these are minor. But the parole board will look at them. This is not a perfect record. They will look at the crime. They will look at the heinous aspect of the crime. They will look at her cover up. They'll look at strapping the children in their car seats in the back seat so they couldn't escape. Even if they realized what was happening, the three year old wouldn't be able to take the 14 month old and get him out.
 
BOLDUAN: We'll hear today.
 
CASAREZ: So, it's going on right now. It has now started, we understand. 
 
BOLDUAN: OK. So, we will hear. 
 
CASAREZ: Yes.
 
BOLDUAN: Jean, thank you so much. 
 
CASAREZ: Thank you. 
 
BOLDUAN: Wow.
 
Sara.
 
SIDNER: All right, we have breaking news to share with you. The defense has just rested in the murder trial of the man accused of killing Georgia nursing student Laken Riley. The defendant, Jose Ibarra, faces murder charges, along with several other charges. 
 
CNN's Rafael Romo, let's get straight to him in Athens, Georgia.
 
Now, there is no jury in this case. So, this then goes to the judge. How soon might that happen?
 
RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It can be very, very soon, Sara, as early as this morning. And you just mentioned that the defense rested. And let me tell you, to be perfectly clear, after introducing only two witnesses, it's - it's an open question as to how much either one of those two witnesses provided to the case to strengthen the defense. And it's very possible that the family and many friends of Laken Riley, who have attended every day of court, will find out the fate of the man that stands accused of her murder. Jose Ibarra's defense team, Sara, has said that they only needed about
 
 half a day to present their testimony, and that's what actually happened. 
 
And let's remember, this is a bench trial. As you mentioned before, not a trial by jury, which means many of the normal procedures don't apply and won't delay the trial because it's ultimately the judge who will decide whether the defendant is guilty or not. Among the most compelling evidence presented here in court yesterday was a college security camera video showing Laken Riley's last run the morning of February 22nd, before she was murdered. The video also showed Jose Ibarra, the defendant, lurking near the crime scene. 
 
We also heard testimony about frantic texts and missed calls from Laken Riley's mother that the prosecution used to illustrate a timeline. And, in what's perhaps the most damning piece of evidence, a forensic expert testified how Ibarra's DNA was found under Riley's fingernails. 
 
We also heard from the medical examiner's official determination for a cause of death. 
 
Let's take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Dr. DiMarco, did you form an opinion as to the cause of death of Laken Riley? 
 
DR. MICHELLE DIMARCO, ASSOCIATE MEDICAL EXAMINER, GEORGIA BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION: I did. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What is that opinion? 
 
DIMARCO: Her cause of death is the combined effects of blunt force head trauma and asphyxia. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What is her manner of death? 
 
DIMARCO: Homicide.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ROMO: And so again, Sara, the defense has rested. They're in rebuttal right now. So, this may end very, very quickly. 
 
Now back to you. 
 
SIDNER: Yes. Ibarra waived his right to a jury trial. Now it is all up to the judge to make the decision here. 
 
Thank you so much, Rafael Romo. Appreciate it. John. 
 
BERMAN: All right, shoppers can expect cheap turkeys at the grocery stores this year for Thanksgiving, though the turkeys do prefer to be called fiscally responsible. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:29:12]
 
BOLDUAN: Dr. Oz, a cardiothoracic surgeon and famous TV doctor, is now Donald Trump's choice to run the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The agency, which is within HHS, oversees health insurance for more than 150 million Americans. I mean we're talking about health care for low-income Americans, older Americans, children, and other vulnerable populations. 
 
And Dr. Oz has a huge following. He hosted a talk show about health for more than a decade. He ran unsuccessfully for Senate in 2022, losing to now Senator John Fetterman, who said this about the Oz announcement.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEN. JOHN FETTERMAN (D-PA): I'm going to be very, very clear, if Dr. Oz agrees to protect and preserve Medicaid and Medicare, I'm absolutely going to vote for the dude. 
 <br>[09:30:00]
 
You know, that's the most important thing for me. Our politics are obviously different, and we do have a history, but I don't have any bitterness. I don't hold anything against him.
