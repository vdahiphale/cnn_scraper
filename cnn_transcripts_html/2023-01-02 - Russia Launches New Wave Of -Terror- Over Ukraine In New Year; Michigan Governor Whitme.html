MAGGIE HABERMAN, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST, SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES: But I think that basically, they just try to leave this as a problem that they don't have to deal with.
 
POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR:  Dodge the reporters -- geesh. Two years of running away from reporter questions if he doesn't want to answer them.
 
HABERMAN:  They've gotten pretty good at it.
 
DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR:  I know.
 
HABERMAN:  I think we will see more of that.
 
LEMON:  Can he -- is it possible for him to hide from reporters?
 
HABERMAN:  Santos?
 
LEMON:  Yes.
 
HABERMAN:  I think that's going to be the test over the next couple of days. 
 
ERROL LOUIS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, POLITICAL ANCHOR, SPECTRUM NEWS, HOST, "YOU DECIDE" PODCAST:  He won't talk to The New York Times, but he's talked to a whole lot of other people and it's probably how we found a lot of these --
 
HARLOW:  But I think when he's -- when he's seated, he's going to be walking in the halls --
 
HABERMAN:  Yes.
 
HARLOW:  -- and they're going to be --
 
HABERMAN:  I think it's going to be different when I think that -- when you get the crush of --
 
HARLOW:  Yes.
 
HABERMAN:  -- Hill reporters who are --
 
HARLOW:  Yes.
 
HABERMAN:  -- who are on you at that moment.
 
LEMON:  He's going to be --
 
HABERMAN:  And I think that's going to be different.
 
HARLOW:  Manu --
 
LEMON:  Yes, but how do you --
 
HARLOW:  Manu going after you with the mic.
 
LEMON:  -- how do you -- how do you make -- I mean --
 
HABERMAN:  This --
 
LEMON:  -- my name is Trent Wilson and I'm, you know, Jew-ish from -- I mean, how do you -- you just make it up. 
 
LOUIS:  He was --
 
LEMON:  I went to Harvard and I graduated top of my class.
 
LOUIS:  He's a bit of a --
 
LEMON:  What was it? It's like the Lovitz segment on "SNL." 
 
LOUIS:  Yes.
 
HABERMAN:  It's --
 
LEMON:  Jon Lovitz. Do you remember that?
 
HABERMAN:  It's like catch me if you can. I mean, there -- and there is a degree --
 
LEMON:  Yes.
 
HABERMAN:  -- to which part of the failure in catching this I think was that it was -- it's inconceivable to me that some -- a candidate like this exists. And I think it was probably --
 
LEMON:  Yes.
 
HABERMAN:  -- inconceivable to you. So I think we don't -- media outlets still do give candidates, to some extent, the benefit of the doubt. Nobody was thinking you know what? Everything here must be not true, so let's go -- let's go poke at it. So --
 
HARLOW:  Thank you very much.
 
HABERMAN:  Thanks, guys.
 
HARLOW:  Happy New Year, guys.
 
LEMON:  A fascinating conversation. But this one -- we'll be watching this saga play out to see what happens, especially tomorrow.
 
HARLOW:  Very closely. Oh, yes.
 
OK, up next, we're going to take you live to Kyiv, Ukraine where they forced -- they have been forced there -- look at that -- to dodge missile strikes while ringing in the new year.
 
LEMON:  And speaking of, Kaitlan's in Washington. Maybe Kaitlan will get an interview with George Santos, hopefully, because she will chase him down, right -- hopefully. 
 
And she also sat down with Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer ahead of her inauguration. What she is saying about her second term and the violent threats against her.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOV. GRETCHEN WHITMER, (D) MICHIGAN:  And they weren't planning to ransom me. They weren't going to keep me. They were planning to assassinate me. And the plot has been covered as a kidnapping plot.

HARLOW:  Welcome back to CNN THIS MORNING. Happy New Year.
 
Coming up for us, what we are learning about the suspect in the killing of those four Idaho college students and how investigators were able to track that suspect down.
 
Also, we'll take you live this morning to California where dangerous flooding has forced entire communities to evacuate. 
 
And we'll tell you about an embezzlement scheme inspired by a cult classic. A man is now facing serious charges for recreating the plot of "Office Space."
 
LEMON:  Wow.
 
Well, Ukraine's capital of Kyiv is on high alert this morning after the military intercepted and shot down at least 20 aerial targets overnight. Officials there say the targets from Russia are targeting critical infrastructure in the region, like power and water services.
 
Meanwhile, Kyiv's mayor joined a group of soldiers in Bakhmut on New Year's Eve in an effort to bring them hope and tradition going into 2023.
 
We turn now to CNN's Ben Wedeman live for us in Kyiv, Ukraine. Hello to you, Ben. The question is a campaign of terror has not slowed down despite Putin's claims of wanting to negotiate with Ukraine. What are you seeing there from the ground? BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, as you said, there are those 20 drones that were fired at Kyiv overnight. Some of them did damage to critical infrastructure. And so, the authorities here in Kyiv are calling upon people to limit as much as possible their use of electricity. 
 
That, in addition to over the New Year's weekend, more than 45 of these Iranian-made Shahed -- the 135 drones were fired. These are drones that explode upon impact. They are sometimes difficult to intercept for the air defenses.
 
Now, over the weekend, one person was killed in the New Year's Eve barrage that took place, and another person has died as a result of the wounds that he received during that barrage. 
 
So it does appear that the Russians -- I mean, basically, four out of the last five days have seen these barrages aimed at the Ukrainian capital. The air defenses are working but they are not able to take out all of these incoming drones that the Russians seem to have in fairly decent supply, although the Ukrainian officials are saying that according to their intelligence, the Russians are running out of missiles and drones to fire. But you wouldn't know it here in Kyiv -- Don.
 
LEMON:  All right. Ben Wedeman on the ground in Kyiv. Thank you very much, Ben. We appreciate that.
 
And straight ahead, we're going to show you an interview with Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer before her inauguration. Kaitlan sat down with her. What's at the top of her agenda as she starts her second term?
 
Plus, this.

SLATER VANCE, SON OF ANGELA BASSETT:  Wait, mom, dad. Did you -- did you read this? Michael B. Jordan dead at 35.
 
ANGELA BASSETT, ACTRESS, MOTHER OF SLATER VANCE:  Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.
 
COURTNEY VANCE, FATHER OF SLATER VANCE:  Stop. Are you kidding? 
 
BASSETT:  Uh-uh.
 
S. VANCE:  You're 35.
 
BASSETT:  Uh-uh.
 
C. VANCE:  You're playing.
 
BASSETT:  What? What? What? What?
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARLOW:  Well, after pranking his mother, Angela Bassett's son is now apologizing after taking part in this viral and disturbing TikTok trend. We'll tell you what's going on, ahead.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
G. WHITMER:  I am honored that you have put your trust in me to continue leading our beautiful state. I will be a governor for all Michiganders and I will work with anyone who wants to solve problems and get things done.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARLOW:  That was Michigan's Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer being sworn in yesterday for her second term just two -- just days, really, after those two men were sentenced on federal charges in the plot to kidnap and assassinate her.
 
Kaitlan Collins got to spend time with the governor at her home in Lansing, Michigan on Inauguration Day at the governor's mansion. Here is her reporting.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN ANCHOR (on camera):  So they've only ever known the governor's mansion?
 
G. WHITMER:  They've only ever known this beautiful place, yes.
 
COLLINS (voice-over):  Inauguration Day for Gov. Gretchen Whitmer starts with kibble.
 
COLLINS (on camera):  How are you feeling today?
 
G. WHITMER:  I'm good. I'm excited. I'm excited starting a second term. We've got a whole new Legislature, a whole new environment here and we can get some really good stuff done.
 
So this is my sister, Liz. 
 
LIZ GEREGHTY, WHITMER'S SISTER:  Hi.
 
COLLINS (voice-over):  It's 7:30 a.m. The governor's pumpkin oatmeal bake is on the kitchen counter and she's surrounded by her family.
 
Whitmer says she wasn't always confident this day would come.
 
G. WHITMER:  There was so much chaos, politically and in the environment, I didn't know if I would get an opportunity to serve for four more years. I never imagined I'd win by almost 11 points and come in with a whole new Legislature. 
 
COLLINS (voice-over):  Whitmer defeated her opponent decisively and with Democratic control of the State House and Senate for the first time in 40 years, is viewing her second term differently. [07:40:04]
 
COLLINS (on camera):  Do you feel, like, battle-tested?
 
G. WHITMER:  It's hard to rattle me now. I will say that. You know, we've had challenge after challenge. But yes, I do. And I'm more comfortable in my own skin.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Congratulations.
 
G. WHITMER:  Thank you.
 
COLLINS (voice-over):  Today starts her new term and a new mission. While that still includes fixing the damn roads, Whitmer is also leading the public charge on protecting abortion rights, in part because of her own daughters.
 
G. WHITMER:  For Michigan to be a place where they will make their lives, they better be able to make their own decisions about their bodies and their -- have full protections under the law. And that's why as a mom, so much of what I do is driven by my own situation. Having daughters, I think, is -- makes it sharper and more urgent than if I didn't have them.
 
COLLINS (voice-over):  Those daughters don't always love having the governor as mom.
 
SHERRY WHITMER, DAUGHTER OF GOV. WHITMER:  It's been a little weird, I'm not going to lie. But it's --
 
SYDNEY WHITMER, DAUGHTER OF GOV. WHITMER:  Everybody knows her now. 
 
SHERRY WHITMER:  Yes, yes. You were talking about how everybody sees her on the street. Like, on Tinder, is see pictures of people who like my mother. 
 
(Laughter)
 
G. WHITMER:  Oh, wow. That's weird.
 
(Crosstalk)
 
COLLINS (on camera):  And do you -- are you, like, that's my mom?
 
SHERRY WHITMER:  Oh, no, no, no. 
 
G. WHITMER:  No. She does not admit.
 
SHERRY WHITMER:  I swipe on -- swipe on.
 
COLLINS (voice-over):  As Whitmer's national profile has grown, so have the threats against her.
 
G. WHITMER:  Absolutely. I'd be lying if I told you it hasn't -- I'm unphased by it. COLLINS (voice-over):  Whitmer was sworn in just days after two men who led the plot to kidnap and possibly kill her were sentenced to prison.
 
G. WHITMER:  Nineteen and a half years for one of the organizers of the conspiracy to kidnap and kill me. That is a significant sentence. 
 
I think it's important to understand I'm an ordinary person. I've got an extraordinary job. I have served in extraordinary times. I'm a mom. I'm a daughter. I'm a -- I'm a -- an average person who is trying to serve my state.
 
COLLINS (voice-over):  Whitmer has chafed in how the matter has been described as a kidnapping plot instead of an assassination attempt.
 
G. WHITMER:  And they weren't planning to ransom me. They weren't going to keep me. They were planning to assassinate me. And the plot has been covered as a kidnapping plot. There was one person who showed up on -- you know, Supreme Court Justice's lawn and turned himself in. And it was covered as an assassination attempt. 
 
COLLINS (voice-over):  The whole ordeal made Whitmer question remaining in public service, and she was shocked when her opponent, Tudor Dixon, used it as a punchline on the campaign trail. 
 
TUDOR DIXON, (R) FORMER MICHIGAN GOVERNOR CANDIDATE:  Gretchen Whitmer sure is good at taking business hostage and holding it for ransom.
 
COLLINS (on camera):  What went through your mind when she said that?
 
G. WHITMER:  Just how craven and how there are some people who care more about winning an election than the health and safety of our democracy and our fellow Americans. 
 
COLLINS (voice-over):  As Whitmer takes her oath of office and begins her second term, it will also be her last due to term limits.
 
G. WHITMER:  I do think people can have some great takeaways from what we did and replicate it in other states. The best way that I can contribute to the national Democratic Party is to be able to be someone that they can point to and say this is what happens when you elect Democrats.
 
COLLINS (voice-over):  But the governor brushed off speculation that she'll seek a future White House bid.
 
G. WHITMER:  I'll be very honest with you, Kaitlan. I have not spent a whole lot of time thinking about that -- no.
 
COLLINS (on camera):  But you've spent some time thinking about it.
 
G. WHITMER:  Well, because people ask me. So, briefly.
 
COLLIN (voice-over):  So what's next in four years when she leaves the governor's mansion?
 
G. WHITMER:  I will stay engaged one way or another. I don't know if I'll ever run for anything again but I will be engaged. 
 
COLLINS (voice-over):  But as Whitmer, herself, noted, she's said that before.
 
G. WHITMER:  You know what? When I left the Legislature eight years ago, I never thought I would run for another office again. I know enough about myself to know if there is something that needs to be -- need to get done and I -- there's a role I can play, I will want to play it.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Do solemnly swear --
 
G. WHITMER:  I do solemnly swear --
 
COLLINS (voice-over):  For now, the focus remains on the job she's just been sworn in to do, governor of the state of Michigan.
 
G. WHITMER:  I do not have plans to run for anything other than to spend the next four years serving this state as governor with a majority-Democratic Legislature for the first time in a long time, and to get a lot of good stuff done here in Michigan.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HARLOW:  Two thoughts.
 
LEMON:  Yes.
 
HARLOW:  Great interview. What did she make? Pumpkin oat something on the kitchen counter. 
 
LEMON:  I don't know. It was something on the counter.
 
But I -- you know what I related to?
 
HARLOW:  What?
 
LEMON:  The dogs. It seems like that's all we do. Her, like, making, I think -- I don't know if that part as seven in the morning.
 
HARLOW:  You never -- you never see them in their own environment.
 
LEMON:  I thought it was great. I thought Kaitlan did a good job of personalizing her and showing her as a professional and also, as you said, just the sort of backstory of her life.
 
HARLOW:  Then end there with the perfect follow-up -- but you've spent some time thinking about running for president, right? Like, I'm Kaitlan Collins. You can't get that past me. It was great.
 <br>[07:50:01]
 
Kaitlan will be back here with us tomorrow. Actually, she'll be in Washington --
 
LEMON:  Yes. HARLOW:  -- with a lot of great interviews --
 
LEMON:  First day --
 
HARLOW:  -- for the first day.
 
LEMON:  -- of the 118th Congress.
 
HARLOW:  Yes. Here we go.
 
LEMON:  Here we go.
 
HARLOW:  Also ahead on CNN THIS MORNING, our interview with Gov. Whitmer's history-making pick for the Michigan Supreme Court, Justice Kyra Harris Bolden. She is the first Black woman --
 
LEMON:  Who did that interview?
 
HARLOW:  I don't know. I don't know. To sit on the state's highest court.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. KYRA HARRIS BOLDEN (D-MI), WHITMER'S APPOINTEE TO MICHIGAN SUPREME COURT:  In 2022, to have the first Black woman on the Michigan Supreme Court -- I don't say that with glee --
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Right.
 
BOLDEN:  -- you know, it's unacceptable. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
LEMON:  We are also going to take you live to Northern California. That's where historic flooding is leading to water rescues and evacuations.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
THE POINTER SISTERS, GIRL GROUP:  Singing "I'm So Excited)
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARLOW:  That song from the legendary Pointer Sisters -- their 1982 hit "I'm So Excited." 
 
Lead singer Anita Pointer was one of the founding members of the Grammy Award-winning R&amp;B group known for their huge '80' hits, like "Neutron Dance" and "Jump." 
 
The 74-year-old singer died New Year's Eve at her home in Los Angeles. She was surrounded, we have learned, by her family after a battle with cancer. The family released a statement saying, quote, "Heaven is a more loving beautiful place with Anita there."
 
LEMON:  Yes.
 
HARLOW:  What a voice.
 
LEMON:  Amazing. I've been -- after I found out, I went through the internet looking at all of their performances on variety shows, like the Sonny &amp; Cher show or the Cher show. It was just amazing to see them because they were so, so talented. 
 
Their interview with Joan Rivers on her talk show where she talked -- they started out as gospel singers, singing in the church.
 
HARLOW:  Yes?
 
LEMON:  Yes.
 
HARLOW:  What a life.
 
LEMON:  They were amazing, yes. Amazing, amazing, amazing.
 
HARLOW:  They will be missed.
 
LEMON:  So, we are thinking about the Pointers -- the entire family. 
 
And we're also talking about this. There is outrage across the internet over a viral TikTok trend that some say has gone too far. Kids pranking their parents by lying and telling them that celebrities have died.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Oh! Holy (bleep). Allison Janney dead at 63.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No! No!
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Who?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Oh my God. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  (Laughing).
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Oh! (Bleep)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Oh my God. George Clooney dead at 61.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Noooooo! No! Don't tell it to me like that.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (Crying).
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Y'all --
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  What?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Kris Jenner dead at 67.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Noooooo!
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Oh, come on.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  (Laughing).
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
Well, so you see it on your screen there -- there's Angela Bassett. The legendary, beautiful actress even fell victim over the weekend when her son told her that her "Black Panther" co-star Michael B. Jordan died.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
S. VANCE:  Wait, mom, dad. Did you -- did you read this? Michael B. Jordan dead at 35.
 
BASSETT:  Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.
 
C. VANCE:  Stop. Are you kidding? 
 
BASSETT:  Uh-uh.
 
S. VANCE:  You're 35.
 
BASSETT:  Uh-uh.
 
C. VANCE:  You're playing.
 
BASSETT:  What? What? What? What?
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
LEMON:  Oh, wow.
 
OK, so joining us now with more on this, CNN entertainment reporter Chloe Melas. Good morning to you.
 
CHLOE MELAS, CNN ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER:  Good morning. I know. Look --
 
HARLOW:  It's --
 
LEMON:  It's -- I saw this. It's not funny. 
 
HARLOW:  It's so weird and a bad omen.
 
MELAS:  Yes, it is. 
 
LEMON:  Angela Bassett is particularly upsetting because we know her --
 
MELAS:  Because of Chadwick Boseman --
 
LEMON:  Yes.
 
HARLOW:  Yes.
 
MELAS:  -- passing away.
 
LEMON:  Her other co-star -- yes.
 
MELAS:  So let me just break it down for you.
 
So, this trend on TikTok -- as we know, a lot of TikTok trends go incredibly bad. This is really dividing people, like you both said, because it is such a terrible thing to joke about. And celebrity deaths really can happen over the holidays, which is what makes it even more believable. Because we've lost some of the greatest, like Mike -- George Michael and others during the holiday season. 
 
And so, it's these young kids who are trying to get these reactions from their parents. 
 
And with Angela Bassett's son, Slater, who is 16 years old -- his joke went, obviously, incredibly badly and obviously really struck a nerve for his mother who, like we just said, lost Chadwick Boseman, her "Black Panther" co-star, a few years ago to cancer.
 
Now, her son, Slater, took to social media to post an apology. Here is a little bit of that. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
S. VANCE:  I apologize to Michael B. Jordan's entire family, his extended family, and him directly, as he is an idol of mine, and taking part in a trend in like this is completely disrespectful. And I hope this can be a teaching lesson to anyone else who uses social media as a tool and a source of entertainment to truly understand that your actions can have consequences that extend beyond you.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MELAS:  I want to point out that on TikTok, the hashtag #celebritydeathprank has almost 200 million views. But I also read on Newsweek this morning that it could be upwards of a billion views. So this doesn't seem to be slowing down. And many are wondering if TikTok should step in, should put disclaimers on these videos, and maybe tell kids that this is --
 
HARLOW:  That's a great question.
 
MELAS:  -- really not a good idea.
 
LEMON:  He's 16 and it's a good lesson for kids to realize that what happens on social media is --
 
HARLOW:  It has impact and consequences.
 
MELAS:  And, like, bad karma and, like --
 
HARLOW:  Yes.
 
MELAS:  -- bad energy to put out there. 
 
HARLOW:  But good for him for going out there and saying --
 
MELAS:  Yes.
 
HARLOW:  -- I was wrong and I'm sorry.
 
MELAS:  Yes.
 
HARLOW:  Jeremy Renner -- what happened? Is he going to be OK?
 
MELAS:  So he is in critical but stable condition. He -- there are not many details at this moment but he was involved in a snow plowing accident. Just -- you know, just himself. No other individuals involved.
 
We are tracking this. We've reached out to his team for comment. But we know that he is in critical condition right now. 
 
HARLOW:  Oh.
 
MELAS:  And we'll keep you guys posted on that. 
 
HARLOW:  Oh. Praying for him, for sure.
 
LEMON:  Yes.
 
HARLOW:  Thank you, Chloe, very much.
 
CNN THIS MORNING continues right now.
 
LEMON:  Good morning.
