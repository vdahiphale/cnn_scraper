ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Hello, and welcome to our viewers joining us from all around the world. I'm Rosemary Church. Just ahead here on CNN NEWSROOM. A CNN exclusive. Russians fighting against Russia in one Ukrainian town even killing soldiers from their own country to stop the Kremlin.
 
A sweeping new criminal code passed in Indonesia now anyone caught having sex outside of marriage could face jail time.
 
Plus, Hawaii's National Guard has just been activated as lava from the world's most active volcano threatens a major highway. 
 
ANNOUNCER: Live from CNN Center, this is CNN NEWSROOM with Rosemary Church.
 
CHURCH: Thanks for being with us. Well, Russia is blaming Ukraine for deadly drone strikes are two airfields deep inside Russian territory. And we've just learned about a third strike hitting an oil tanker in Russia's Kursk region. Surveillance video captured the early morning explosion at one base in the city of Engels. About 800 kilometers south east of Moscow, Ukraine is not commenting.
 
Another video shows the same blasts from another angle the port city is home to a strategic Russian bomber base. Russia claims it intercepted a drone at a second airfield, but three people were killed and several planes were damaged by falling debris. The strikes are significant because they mean Ukraine now has the ability to hit military targets deep inside Russian territory and in Crimea.
 
Meanwhile, Russia has launched another missile barrage cutting of water and electricity and cities across Ukraine. The capital Kyiv and the southern port city of Odesa are among the worst affected regions. Authorities report at least four people were killed. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy says maximum efforts are underway to stabilize the country's power grid. Ukraine's Air Force claims that intercepted more than 60 of the 70 Russian missiles launched on Monday.

VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translator): Every Russian missile shot down is concrete proof that terror can be defeated. But we still cannot give complete security to our sky. There were several hits. Unfortunately, there are victims.

CHURCH: One of the bloodiest battles of the war right now is for the city of Bakhmut in eastern Donetsk. The city has been the target of nearly constant Russian shelling since May. But Moscow's recent all- out assault has resulted in heavy losses for Russian forces. And Sam Kiley reports some of the fighters defending Bakhmut are Russian.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Cesar is Russian, he's taking a break at a monastery from fighting Russians in nearby Bakhmut. It's a relief from scenes like this backwards Ukrainian field hospital. He's been defending this Ukrainian town from Russia's most intense assault along an 800-mile front. Artillery duels and trench warfare have almost destroyed Bakhmut as Russia throws its army at a bid for victory after months of defeats to the north and south.
 
Defending Bakhmut against his Russian motherland is a religious imperative for Cesar. The fighting is very brutal now, he says. There are very few prisoners.
 
KILEY (on camera): When you see those Russians in your gun sites. What do you think and what do you feel?
 
I believe that these people who've broken the law of man and the law of God, I have no pity for them. I take them prisoner if I can, but most often, I just have to kill them.
 
KILEY: So, have you killed a lot of your countrymen?
 
A dozen and a half.
 
This is the remains of a Russian Orthodox monastery now for Vladimir Putin. The Orthodox Church is absolutely central to his vision of the Russian world. For some Russians, though, that's a world they don't want to live in. Indeed, they don't want it to survive.
 
KILEY (voice over): Ukraine's Orthodox church broke with Moscow three years ago. This is all that's left of a rebranded Ukrainian Orthodox St. George's monastery. After nine months of war.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Putin says that his defense traditional values, yes? (INAUDIBLE) old monastery.
 <br>[02:05:06]
 
KILEY: Vinnie (ph) has been fighting in Bakhmut for week against mercenaries from Russia's Wagner company, many of them convicted criminals.
 
It's obvious, he says. When private companies hire criminals and convicts imagine a man kills once and they put him in jail then he kills a second time, and he becomes a repeat offender under the law. Then he gets let out of jail and given a gun. That's not a person. That's a beast. 
 
After a form of Wagner deserter Yevgeny Nuzhin was murdered in a video that was praised by Wagner's boss Yevgeny Nuzhin, Vinnie is in no doubt how he would be treated if captured. 
 
It'll be the end 100 percent but it'll just be more painful.
 
The Russian legion does claim to be in the hundreds. And it says many more back home are trying to join Ukraine's army. Alongside their Ukrainian allies, the Russian legion is focused on the battle for Bakhmut. The aim of the war after is more ambitious.
 
He says, I'm doing my military and Christian duty. I defend the Ukrainian people. And when Ukraine is free, I will carry my soul to Russia to free it from tyranny.
 
Sam Kiley, CNN, Dolyna, Ukraine.

CHURCH: A Russian oligarch is warning the U.S. not to designate his private military contractor as a terrorist organization. Yevgeny Prigozhin founded the Wagner group which has been actively fighting for Russia in Ukraine as we just heard. He says the U.S. should let sleeping dogs lie or they could get a response that makes them tremble.
 
CNN reported last month the Biden administration is considering a terrorist label for the group, but no final decision has been made. The Kremlin says Moscow will not let the West dictate how much money it can make from its vital oil exports. That reaction after the E.U., G7 And Australia agreed to impose a price cap of $60.00 a barrel. It's an effort to deprive Russia of critical revenue amid the war in Ukraine.
 
CNN's Clare Sebastian has the latest now from London.
 
CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Moscow's next move is the major variable as the world watches to see how this oil price cap plays out. The cap is essentially a ban on countries accessing E.U. or G7 insurance or shipping services. If they pay over a certain amount for Russian oil. As it has done for months the Kremlin promised Monday it would not recognize the E.U. and G7 price cap on its oil exports. And it said it was preparing a response.
 
Now of course Russia does have a track record when it comes to cutting off its own fossil fuel exports to hurt Ukraine's allies. It's done so with some gas supplies to Europe. Oil is a much bigger revenue driver for Russia and more important than ever right now as sanctions eat into the rest of the economy. That is why the level of the cap was such a delicate balance because on the one hand, the whole point of this is to reduce the oil revenues funding Russia's war chest.
 
Russian euros crude has been trading at or close to or below the cap recently. So, for now, the impact should be limited but the cap will be regularly reviewed and could be set lower and future. Well, the reason for setting it at this level of $60.00 though is because the West does not want Russia, the world's second biggest oil producer to stop exporting oil to some customers and cut production.
 
That would lead to destabilizing price spikes when the world is already grappling with sky high inflation. Well, Russia is likely already looking as well for loopholes in the scheme. There are reports that has been amassing a shadow fleet of tankers, so it doesn't need to rely on Western companies. But along with an E.U. embargo on Russia and seaborne oil that also came into force Monday, this is still the biggest set of energy sanctions on Russia since the start of the nine- month-old war.
 
And one that has the potential at least, to hit Russia's biggest source of funding.
 
Clare Sebastian, CNN, London.
 
CHURCH: After months of anti-government protests in Iran claims by an Iranian official that the government is abolishing its morality police and reviewing its hijab law are being met with skepticism by activists and the international community. The U.S. going a step further saying there's nothing to suggest Iran is improving its treatment of women or ceasing a deadly crackdown on protesters.
 
And right now, in Iran, some businesses are reportedly staging a general strike, but Iranian state television says stores and markets are open. So, for more on this we want to bring in Salma Abdelaziz. She joins us live from London. Good morning to you, Salma. So, skepticism about suggestions. Iran's hijab law is under review and its morality police will be abolished and now these conflicting reports about businesses striking against the regime. What is going on here? 
 <br>[02:10:11]
 
SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Despite these reports of the morality police being shut down or abolished Iran's protesters making themselves known, making themselves hut trying to impact Iran's government economically by calling for this three-day strike. They're in the middle of it now. Today's the second day. They've called on businesses in dozens of cities to shut their doors in an effort to try to again make their voices heard.
 
But some shopkeepers, despite losing business say they are willing to make those sacrifices. Take a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): This is a legitimate demand and they should be heard. If society is divided, and they regularly attack each other and create issues every day. Not only will the situation not improve, but we will go backwards. When no one listens to the words of the people they are compelled to forcefully or violently speak out, or shout or create other issues.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ABDELAZIZ: I think there's been a great deal of backlash, Rosemary, to these headlines around the morality police, particularly from activist who point out first of all, the morality police have not been seen on the streets by many people on the ground in the recent months. But that doesn't mean the hijab law hasn't been enforced. In fact, activists say it's been enforced ever more brutally, just by other parts of Iran security apparatus.
 
You're about three months into this movement into these demonstrations that have rocked dozens of cities across Iran. Really shaking the government in Teheran. And activists say there is no signs of them slowing down despite this brutal crackdown that has according to rights group left hundreds of people killed, thousands in prisons. CNN investigation found instances of sexual assault and rape among those detained at the hands of the security forces.
 
So truly, a really brutal repression, really brutal tactics being used, but these demonstrators not backing down and their demands now much greater than just a review of the hijab law or the shutting down of the morality police. Some of these demonstrators now want to see this entire government really scrapped, re -- they want to see the overthrow of this Islamic system as a whole. Rosemary?
 
CHURCH: Right. Salma Abdelaziz, many thanks for bringing us up to date on that situation. 
 
Here's a preview of Tuesday's action of the FIFA World Cup. The final matches for the round of 16. First Group F, champions, Morocco face off against Spain and later Portugal take on Switzerland.
 
Croatia fans were ecstatic when their team won the penalty shootout three to one with Croatia's goalkeeper blocking three out of Japan's four penalty kicks. Meanwhile, the Japanese team and their fans were understandably disappointed. They beat former World Champions Germany and Spain during the group stage so they had high expectations heading into the match.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
YUKI WATANABE, JAPAN FAN: We were hoping that we're going to win and go to the best eight (INAUDIBLE) never been to like best eight, I think, so like -- so, honestly, we are sad. I'm sad, but like players didn't give up until the penalty.
 
CHURCH: Brazil's fans showed why they are second to none and celebrating football victories after their team route in South Korea four to one.
 
And for more on Monday's World Cup drama, Don Riddell has the highlights. DON RIDDELL, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR: The Brazilian football team arrived at this World Cup as the favorite to win it. And after Monday night's complete demolition of South Korea who would dispute their claim to a sixth world title. At one point it seemed as though the number of goals they were scoring might match the name of the stadium. 974.
 
Brazil was just magnificent and their fans are in no doubt that another trophy is imminent. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let's go, Brazil. Wooh.
 
RIDDELL: We knew this team was good but they were just irresistible and South Korea couldn't live with them. Returning from injury Neymar made the first golfer. Vinicius Junior scored after just seven minutes before Neymar himself outfox the goalie with a penalty six minutes later. Their next goal was a veritable work of art.
 
Richarlison was juggling the ball, the passing was incisive and he's finishing lethal. By now they were dancing and Korean heads were spinning when Vinicius Junior lifted the ball for Lucas Paqueta, it was four-nil. In the second half Korea seemed to know they were beaten but a stunning strike from Seung-Ho Paik at least gave them a consolation prize. 
 <br>[02:15:01]
 
Brazil having won the World Cup since the 2002 tournament in Korea and Japan and both these teams went out tonight. The Japanese lost a penalty shootout to the 2018 finalist Croatia, who now have the unenviable task of playing Brazil next in the quarterfinals.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think we're adding another star who has five (INAUDIBLE) 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Adding another star.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Amazing match. And now we are just so free and feel like we can really win. We have the best team in World Cup for sure.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's Brazilian football at its best. I love Neymar, I love Vinicius. All the Brazilian players are. It's just entertaining to watch. They're playing football to have fun and we love to see it.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)  
 
ROBERTSON: Only eight different countries from two continents have won the World Cup Trophy before and so far, four of them are into the quarterfinals and Spain could join them on Tuesday. A tournament of upsets is starting to look rather predictable. Back to you.
 
CHURCH: Thanks for that report. We'll just ahead here on CNN. Indonesians who have sex outside of marriage could soon be facing a year in jail. We will have a live report on the sweeping change to the Criminal Code passed by the country's lawmakers. Plus, China's ruling party pays tribute to a late leader who took over after the Tiananmen Square massacre and oversaw an economic boom. Back in just a moment.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHURCH: Welcome back, everyone.  To Beijing now and a state memorial service for the former president who laid the groundwork for China to become a superpower. 
 
Jiang Zemin has been honored at the Great Hall of the People. He became China's top leader after the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989 and ruled as president until 2003. Current President Xi Jinping praise Jiang's lofty spirit and called him a Great Proletarian Revolutionary. State media report Jiang died of leukemia and organ failure last week at age 96. Chinese leaders visited his body earlier at a military hospital before the cremation.
 
And Beijing Bureau Chief Steven Jiang is live in the Chinese capital. He joins us now. So, Steven, what does the passing of Jiang Zemin mean for most people in China and how is he being remembered?
 
STEVEN JIANG, CNN BEIJING BUREAU CHIEF: Yes, Rosemary. You know, know who can forget Jiang Zemin's inclination to burst into songs in multiple languages and reciting famous foreign leader speeches like the Gettysburg Address by Lincoln. And this kind of episodes has become synonymous with a bygone era under his leadership that was perceived to be freer and, you know, more open to the outside world which is in stark contrast to the current era under Xi Jinping who did pull out all the stops to send Jiang Zemin off with the highest honors.
 <br>[02:20:10]
 
You know, obviously you mentioned that eulogy he delivered in Beijing but even before that there were several ceremonies held in Jiang's honor after his death last week. And Xi attended both events in Beijing and even went to the airport to receive Jiang's casket and his family members from Shanghai. And there are some rare moments of public display of emotions on Xi's part including him embracing tightly, Jiang's eldest son appear to be consoling him at another point she was seeing a pulling up the blanket on Jiang's widow when they were all waiting outdoors in Beijing's bitter cold weather condition.
 
Those moments were notable because Chinese leaders are usually tightly scripted and very stoic in public. Remember, not long ago, back in October during the closing session of the party congress, another former top leader Hu Jintao was seen unceremoniously led out of the meeting room, and when that happened, all the leaders seated on the stage, none of them -- almost none of them showed any emotions.
 
And that episode obviously, became quite a -- quite notable -- quiet noted around the world and also international mystery about whose fate at -- Hu Jintao actually show up at one of these and memorial services, paying his final respects to Jiang as well and was also seen shaking hands with Jiang's widow. Obviously, all of these events are highly choreographed and the display of emotions and reactions may be genuine and spontaneous.
 
But the fact they actually ended in state media coverage does seem to be a message from the party to highlight its unity and its humanity. And that's, of course, all the more important after the recent wave of protests across the country with some demonstrators calling for the ouster of the party and Xi Jinping himself. And it's also worth noting that despite all the talk about Xi Jinping at this rating internal rivals within the party, including factions ones headed by hu and Jiang, at the end of the day, Jiang Zemin did play an instrumental role in putting him where he is right now as China's current top leader. Rosemary?
 
CHURCH: All right. Thanks to Steven Jiang. Appreciate it. After protests against the ruling communist zero-COVID policies testing measures continue to change in China. Beijing's two major airports will no longer require departing passengers to show a negative test to get to their terminal. Instead, travelers will scan their mobile health codes and have their body temperatures checked.
 
The move comes as multiple cities across China have either dropped or relaxed measures requiring COVID test to enter public spaces.
 
And still to come, rescue workers are digging for survivors after a landslide buried a bus full of passengers in Colombia.
 
Plus, the lava flow from Hawaii's Mauna Loa volcano is inching closer to a key highway. We'll have an update after the break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:25:36]
 
CHURCH: More than 30 people are dead after a massive landslide buried a bus in western Colombia. Now rescue workers are digging through the mud for survivors. Stefano Pozzebon has details now from Bogota.
 
STEFANO POZZEBON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The heavy rainfall that hit the road Colombian province of Risaralda on Sunday triggered in landslide over an interprovincial road that hit several vehicles, killing dozens of people according to Colombian authorities. The Colombian High Risk Management Unit said that over 70 rescue workers were still trying to secure the area as of Monday while at least the six people have been treated in hospital. And authorities vowed not to abandon those who have lost their loved ones.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ALFONSO PRADA GIL, COLOMBIA INTERIOR MINISTER (through translator): We will launch a comprehensive support plan for the relatives of the victims, psychological support, physical support, social support. Also, we are declaring a high alert across the entire nation due to this winter wave of rainfall.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) POZZEBON: The high alert means that rescue workers are on standby ready to be activated in case the rains cause more havoc in the upcoming days. While on Tuesday, the Colombian President Gustavo Petro will personally chair an emergency cabinet session to devote more resources to the damaged communities.
 
For CNN, this is Stefano Pozzebon, Bogota.
 
CHURCH: Thousands of people were evacuated after an Indonesian volcano erupted on Sunday, blanketing roads and homes in volcanic ash. So far, the volcano has not disrupted flights in the area and there are no reports of any deaths or injuries. But the Indonesian government is handing out masks to mitigate the risks of volcanic ash and neighboring Singapore is advising its citizens to defer non-essential travel to Indonesia.
 
And you're looking at live pictures now from Hawaii where the Mauna Loa volcano continues to spew red hot lava. The state's National Guard has been activated as the lava inches closer to a major highway. The U.S. Geological Survey says that although the advanced rate has slowed over the past several days, the lava flow remains active with a continuous supply from the fisher.
 
 So, let's bring in Ken Rubin, a professor of Volcanology at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. He joins us live from Honolulu. Thank you so much for being with us.
 
KEN RUBIN, PROFESSOR OF VOLCANOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII: Thank you for having me, Rosemary.
 
CHURCH: And now you have been watching these two volcanic eruptions on opposite sides of the planet. So, let's start with the one in Hawaii where about 20 National Guard service members have been activated as lava from the Mauna Loa volcano continues its advanced slowly toward the highway. What do you see as the major challenges and concerns there right now?
 
RUBIN: Primarily the concern with the eruption as it is current status is how long will it last? The eruption has stabilized only being fed by one primary event is producing a large lava flow that has reached relatively flat ground and is spreading as much as it's advancing much like pouring pancake batter into a frying pan. And so, at this stage, based on what we know from past eruptions at Mauna Loa, it's a question of how long will the eruption continue that will determine how big the lava flow gets and whether it will eventually interrupt infrastructure or even potentially flow down slope into more populated areas.
 
CHURCH: And how unpredictable and dangerous is lava flow like this, even if it is moving slowly?
 
RUBIN: Well, it's completely destructive to everything in its path. And, you know, I've seen images being shown on CNN and other networks recently of the Kilauea lava flow from 2018 that happened in Leilani estates. They completely buried homes there, they're unrecoverable. And so, it -- part of it depends on how thick the lava flow becomes right now. It's about 15 feet thick at the front of the law.
 
Little more like 30 feet thick or, you know, roughly 10 meters further up near the vent.
 <br>[02:30:05]
 
That isn't too terribly thick as it's continuing to spread out, but it would vary substantially cover anything that comes in its path. It's very hot.
 
When lava flows get into vegetated areas, they can cause explosions of methane gas, superheated water from the soil, can also cause small explosions. So, there are a lot of potential hazards. We don't see them on the horizon right now for this eruption based on where it currently is. But there are always a possibility if, as I see the eruption duration continues substantially longer.
 
ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN ANCHOR: And you and I spoke about this 24 hours ago and you were concerned about sightseers getting too close to the lava and the dangers involved with that. What is your message to those people?
 
RUBIN: Well, the, you know, the state and the county have established a system whereby people can bring their vehicle into the area, and they should basically stay with their vehicle. There are the hazards associated with hot lava, as well as volcanic gas and ash, but they're also the hazards associated with the area. This is a training and sort of firing range of the military that the lava flow is in the viewing area is encroaching upon.
 
And just in the last day, an unexploded hand grenade was found off the area of the roadway. So the, you know, state is ticketing people if they venture too far from the road, simply because not every square foot of the landscape has been checked for unexploded ordnance.
 
CHURCH: And meantime, on the other side of the world, nearly 2,000 people have been evacuated in the East Java province of Indonesia, after Mount Semeru erupted. How bigger concern is that volcano?
 
RUBIN: Mount Semeru is a classic stratovolcano. It has been continuously erupting since about 2010. So, this is a situation where people living in and around the volcano are aware of its activity. It's one of the situations that occurs here as in many countries is that people live very, very close to the volcano. And so, this puts them into the potential of a hazard zone.
 
The type of activity that's happening at Mount Semeru is quite different than Mauna Loa. And you can see it from the types of materials being emitted primarily volcanic ash, very, very fine particulates, something called pyroclastic flows, which are ground hugging clouds of ash that float on a sort of thin layer of superheated air. There has been a lava flow as well.
 
The lava flow is advancing relatively slowly, not like Mauna Loa. And the primary hazard here is ash inundation. The ash itself is also much finer in particle size than the type of particulate that comes from Mauna Loa. And so, it can be much greater of a respiratory hazard. It can also distribute much farther and wider from the volcanic vent. And so, people are rightly being recommended to wear dust protection over their face even if they are many, many tens of kilometers away from the volcano itself.
 
CHURCH: All right, Ken Rubin, thank you so much for joining us. Appreciate it.
 
RUBIN: Thank you for having me.
 
CHURCH: Well, along with the volcanoes in Hawaii and Indonesia, Italy's Mount Stromboli is also rumbling away. Seismologists say the volcanic island off the coast of Sicily erupted on Sunday spewing ash and lava and creating a small tsunami. Officials have raised the alert level and have warned residents to follow safety precautions.
 
And still to come, Buckingham Palace braces for a bombshell documentary as "Harry &amp; Meghan" is set to hit Netflix this week. The details next.

CHURCH: Indonesians could face one year in prison if found guilty of having sex outside of marriage. It's part of a sweeping change to the criminal code passed by Parliament just a short time ago. The law will also apply to foreigners visiting the country.
 
In addition, cohabitation before marriage is an offense that can result in jailtime as well. And blasphemy already outlawed now carries a possible five-year prison term. Protestors and rights groups warn the new laws will disproportionately hurt women, LGBTQ people and minority groups.
 
Andreas Harsono joins me now from Jakarta. He is a senior researcher for Human Rights Watch. Thank you so much for being with us.
 
ANDREAS HARSONO, SENIOR RESEARCHER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH: OK.
 
CHURCH: So Indonesia has banned sex outside of marriage, with parliament passing this sweeping new criminal code, how will it be enforced? And what impact will it likely have on women, particularly, and human rights and freedoms in general?
 
HARSONO: The problem of this kind of law is that it won't be enforced broadly. Because if it is to be enforced broadly, how many millions of people will be arrested? The problem with this kind of law is it provide an avenue for selective enforcement. It means that certain police officer might use it to extort some people. Some politician might use the law to jail, their enemies, their political opponents. So that is the problem, it will be selected for enforcement.
 
CHURCH: And Indonesia did try to pass a similar criminal code, didn't it, back in 2019. But that triggered nationwide protests. So the government backed off then. How likely is it that protesters will get out on the streets again, and what will likely happen if they do that?
 
HARSONO: We still don't know. There are smaller protests right now, in front of the parliament building. The thing is, frankly, speaking, many human rights organization, student association, LGBT groups, minorities groups, women's groups, they are kind of exhausted, because over the last few years, they try apparently fail to influence the writing of the criminal code.
 
Although, there are some safeguard being made to government, to some extent, also listen to the safeguard that this group offer, although this is far from enough. One of the worst things about this criminal code is the introduction of the so-called Living law. This is unwritten law that the authorities will enforce despite being unwritten at all.
 
The second is apostasy. This is the first time ever in this archipelago, where someone who say something about non-believing might be sent to prison for up to two years.
 
CHURCH: Why is this happening now at this time?
 
HARSONO: Well, we are seeing the rise of conservatism over the last two decades in Indonesia. We are seeing the introduction of more and more homophobic anti-LGBT regulation, rules against woman, mandatory hijab, for instance, rules against religious minorities, more than 700 over the last two decades. This code is being produced with that kind of background, with he background of the rise of conservatism in Indonesia.
 <br>[02:40:04]
 
CHURCH: And this criminal code, of course, will also include foreigners which could potentially impact the country's tourism industry particularly travel to popular destinations like the island of Bali. Is that not a concern for Indonesian authorities?
 
They argued that they have provide safeguards. One can be reported reckless if a parent or a child or a spouse reported that particular person, including a tourist to the police. But if it's still a problem, let's say you have a local partner, and then a parent or whoever related to the local partner reported you to the police, then it is going to be a legal problem.
 
CHURCH: What if someone has it in for another person, what do they have to do? I mean, if they reported someone who hadn't done this, how do authorities prove otherwise? What is the process there?
 
HARSONO: That is the problem. This is going to be a complicated legal enforcement in Indonesia. Again, this law will not be enforced broadly. These are only for selective enforcement. And like it or not, for many businesses, it means higher costs of the economy.
 
CHURCH: All right, Andreas Harsono, thank you so much for joining us and explaining the complexities of this. We do appreciate it.
 
Well, Netflix has announced it is releasing its much-anticipated Docuseries on the Duke and Duchess of Sussex this week. The first three episodes of the series called "Harry &amp; Meghan" will be released on Thursday with the next three to drop a week later. The couple has promised the program will present the full truth about the pressures they faced, and their ultimate decision to pull away from the royal family.

Well NASA's Orion spacecraft is one step closer to heading home. The space agency says the uncrewed Artemis 1 mission is nearing its final stages after successfully completing an engine burn on Monday. That set it on a path to return to Earth.
 
That maneuver brought the spacecraft 128 kilometers or about 80 miles from the lunar surface. And if all goes well, Orion will splashdown in the Pacific Ocean on Sunday. And Artemis 2 will repeat the mission in 2024, but this time with astronauts on board.
 
And thank you so much for joining us. I'm Rosemary Church. World Sport is coming up next. And I'll be back in about 15 minutes with more CNN Newsroom. Do stick around.
