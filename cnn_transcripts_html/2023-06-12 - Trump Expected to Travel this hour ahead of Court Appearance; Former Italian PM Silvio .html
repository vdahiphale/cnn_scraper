BECKY ANDERSON, CNN HOST, CONNECT THE WORLD: This hour one of the most influential figures in Italian politics and culture this century. Silvio 
 
 Berlusconi has died at the age of 86. This hour we'll be analyzing his complicated legacy both domestically and on the international stage.
 
First up, though, you're other headlines this hour Russian forces are on the defensive, according to Ukraine's military, two dozen battles taking 
 
 place right now across Donetsk and Luhansk because Ukraine looks to set up its long awaited counter offensive.
 
Well, this our Former U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to depart New Jersey to appear in federal court tomorrow in Miami where he will face 37 
 
 felony counts related to his handling of classified documents after he left office. And the party is kicking off in Manchester right now as fans 
 
 prepare to welcome home their European Champions Manchester City.
 
Welcome to what is our second hour of "Connect the World". Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has passed away at the age of 86. Self-
 
 described as the Jesus Christ of politics his legacy is complicated to say the least. On the international stage, he tried to play the role of 
 
 statesman happy to be friends with all and forced to try and steer Italy through what was a disastrous Euro crisis.
 
Well, tonight we ask, how do we assess Silvio Berlusconi's legacy in Italy and beyond? Let's kick this part of the show off with Barbie Nadeau who has 
 
 this reflection.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BARBIE NADEAU, CNN CONTRIBUTOR (voice over): The Jesus Christ of politics, the best political leader in Europe and the world. That is how Silvio 
 
 Berlusconi once described himself, and without a doubt he was a powerful political operator and businessman who sparked more than one scandal.
 
And despite a string of legal trouble and dubious friends, Berlusconi always managed to bounce back. He made his name as a business tycoon. He 
 
 owned the famous AC Milan football club for 31 years. At one point, he was the richest man in Italy.
 
SILVIO BERLUSCONI, ITALIAN PRIME MINISTER: I have always been adored by those who have worked with me.
 
NADEAU (voice over): First elected as Prime Minister in 1994 he was quickly removed when his coalition partners pulled out, but he was elected to the 
 
 top job twice more in 2001 and 2008, becoming Italy's longest serving Prime Minister since World War II. And voters brought him back to power in 2022 
 
 as a coalition partner with Giorgia Meloni and Matteo Salvini.
 
Charming and with a flippant sense of humor, Berlusconi's off the cuff remarks and missteps with protocol were often criticized. He welcomed the 
 
 newly elected U.S. President in 2008 by complimenting Barack Obama on his quote "suntan", a left German Chancellor Angela Merkel waiting during a 
 
 NATO summit.
 
And his close friendship with Vladimir Putin got him in hot water after he disclosed he had reestablished his friendship with the Russian President in 
 
 late 2022 after Putin sent him 20 bottles of Russian vodka for his birthday. He later blamed Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for 
 
 starting a war, putting him at odds with Meloni.
 
The Prime Minister often surrounded himself with beautiful women. Allegations of a relationship with an 18 year old aspiring model which he 
 
 strenuously denied triggered a painfully public divorce. And revelations about his so called "Bunga Bunga" parties landed him in court on charges of 
 
 abuse of power and having sex with an underage prostitute. Allegations he also denied.
 
BERLUSCONI: It is absurd to think that I have paid to have rapport with a woman.
 
NADEAU (voice over): Meanwhile, the Eurozone was going through a financial crisis. Italy was hit hard and the government's debt ballooned 120 percent 
 
 of the GDP in August 2011. The Italian Prime Minister promised to crack down on tax evasion and introduce other austerity measures but it was not 
 
 enough. Berlusconi lost his majority in parliament and was forced to resign as Prime Minister in November 2011.
 
In 2012, he was convicted of corporate tax fraud and banned from public office. Months later an Italian court found Berlusconi guilty on the 
 
 charges stemming from the "Bunga Bunga" parties an appeals court later overturned the conviction.
 <br>[11:05:00]
 
He was voted out of parliament in 2013. Two years later convicted of bribing a Senator a decade before but never served time since a statute of 
 
 limitations timed out in the same year. At the age of 82, Berlusconi managed another come back. He led his Forts Italia Party in the European 
 
 elections and won a seat in Parliament.
 
A month before he turned 86 he led his party back to power as the junior partner of the current ruling coalition. In the summer of 2020, a few weeks 
 
 away from turning 84-years-old, Berlusconi was struck by COVID-19 and was hospitalized for 12 days. He called that experience the most dangerous test 
 
 of my life and boasted to journalists that his viral load entity of the virus.
 
BERLUSCONI: Was the highest one amongst tens of thousands.
 
NADEAU (voice over): Few could match the one and only Silvio Berlusconi. And even though the "Teflon Don" as he was known was in and out of the 
 
 hospital in his later years, he always managed to look remarkably younger than years.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON: Well Barbie Nadeau joining me now live from Rome. And I know that you've interviewed Berlusconi in the past, what was your impression of him?
 
NADEAU: Well, you know, I interviewed him, this is for print. It was outside of the cameras in 2001 and again in 2006, for print articles, and 
 
 he was a different man off camera then he was on camera. He was smart. He wasn't this sort of clown. He wasn't the caricature that I think he very 
 
 much liked to have portrayed about himself.
 
And I always felt, you know, that he -- there was a little bit of that was kind of a cover to sort of be the entertainer after all, he wasn't 
 
 entertainers a cruise ship crew, you know, singer for a short period of time as well. But I think he was a smart man. He was well studied. He 
 
 understood things. He wasn't a great leader.
 
Everyone says, you know, he was a great politician, but not such a good leader. He didn't do the best for Italy that's obviously demonstrable, in 
 
 terms of the way the economy was going and things like that. But he's, you know, he's very much a part of the post war Italy and so many levels.
 
He had control of the television network that first private television networks. He introduced the American Sitcom, you know, Dallas and some of 
 
 these shows to the Italian audience. He made people want to be wealthy, you know, you he was a really a big part of Italian history and a part of 
 
 Italy, as it is today I think very much is reflected in who Berlusconi was during those years that he was a leader, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Barbie, thank you. Well, I want to take you through some of the international reaction to the death of Silvio Berlusconi we reported 
 
 earlier the European Parliament President describing him as a fighter who led the center right and was the protagonist of politics in Italy and in 
 
 Europe for generations.
 
The German government tweeting "We've learned today of the death of Former Italian Prime Minister Berlusconi, we express our condolences to the 
 
 Italian people and government". And Dutch Prime Minister Mark Ritchie for example of this tribute with the death of Silvio Berlusconi, Italy has last 
 
 strong personality was the first Italian prime minister I worked with, and I will remember him as a striking and passionate politician interesting 
 
 choice of words.
 
My next guest is a Senior Policy Fellow and the Head of the Rome Office for the European Council on Foreign Relations. Arturo Varvelli is an expert on 
 
 Italian Foreign Policy with insight on Berlusconi's lasting impact, particularly here in this region where I'm broadcasting to you from the 
 
 Gulf.
 
And so let's bring him in. He joins me from Skype tonight. We've heard some kind words from Italy's neighbors, Russia's President Vladimir Putin, 
 
 adding to the chorus calling Berlusconi, a wise and dear friend of Arturo and there's no doubt he will be remembered fondly by many. What do you 
 
 believe his lasting legacy will be? Let's start on the international stage.
 
ARTURO VARVELLI, SENIOR POLICY FELLOW, EUROPEAN COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS: Yes, in an era where rather traditional leaders still 
 
 predominate Berlusconi was one of the first world leaders to change the style of approach to foreign policy to build international relation based 
 
 on personal mutual trust.
 
Berlusconi bases his foreign policy on his capacity as a success businessman. He did this both with traditional allies, the Europeans, the 
 
 Americans, et cetera and by building particular friendship with regional and global power outside the Atlantic Alliance from Gaddafi to Erdogan to 
 
 Putin.
 <br>[11:10:00]
 
One of his greatest sauces for example, was the inclusion of Russia because we are talking about Putin. The rational inclusion of Russia in the G7 
 
 transforming it into the G8 because he worked a lot for this.
 
Berlusconi also worked to establish a sort of structure, a dialogue between the Atlantic Alliance and Russia. Those were different times the end of the 
 
 90s, the beginning of 20s, in which it was still believed that the full inclusion of Moscow in the western international system was possible.
 
In reality, this Italian policy has not negated much from the traditional Italian policy that of acting as a bridge between the West and the other 
 
 external actors, but he did it with his own style, sometimes unconventional, very informal a style that prevailed through how the West 
 
 if we think of Boris Johnson, Donald Trump, but also Sarkozy or Macron.
 
ANDERSON: Interestingly, I mean, I've been covering Silvio Berlusconi, as long as I can remember, and I, you know, it was a very sort of noisy voice 
 
 on the international stage of G7 member. You'd see him lining up with his other G7 members at these meetings in the sort of mid 2000s.
 
And this was, you know, a European politician who was plugging a sort of right wing populism, when that was, you know, friendly, less than 
 
 fashionable in Europe. What sort of impact do you think he had, on the broader Italian -- a broader European politics, which now, of course, very 
 
 much reflects in some parts, certainly, in some parts of the old sort of Eastern Europe, you know, very much reflects where some of Europe is now 
 
 at?
 
VARVELLI: Yes, sure. We can say that Berlusconi was perhaps the first populist leader in the Western world, but he also contributed to creating a 
 
 sort of new bipolar system in Italy, picking up on the legacy of a political party that Christian Democrats in Italy which had imploded 
 
 completely.
 
So now it will be necessary to understand who in Italy will take over his legacy? I think it will be Georgia Milan in the end, I think she has a 
 
 younger leader, very different teenager in history, also in her vision of politics.
 
But she is perhaps the only Italian leader whatever you like it or not, with the charisma necessary to keep the center right coalition together, 
 
 because this is very important for the current government.
 
And Berlusconi that could probably lead Maloney to look more towards the center of the political spectrum towards the popular indeed Europeans 
 
 Popular Party also in a view of the next European election next year so it's very important to understand his legacy on domestic but in Italian 
 
 politics but also in European politics. And I think that Georgia Maloney took over this space.
 
ANDERSON: And you're making a very good point. He had such an impact on modern Italian politics. His Fort Italian Party was once the countries most 
 
 powerful the anti-establishment Five Star Movement was originally born.
 
As a reaction to Berlusconi's politics is of course Italia now attempting to walk in the sort of far right, sort of a tightrope as it were, and your 
 
 analysis of where Gregory Maloney is now I think, is really important. The Euro crisis, what was the lasting legacy of the Berlusconi periods as far 
 
 as Italy's economy is concerned?
 
VARVELLI: Yes, sure. Berlusconi was enabling at the time around 2011 to governor Italy. And there is a strange case that is linked with the 
 
 relation between Italy and Libya because Berlusconi and Gaddafi are close friends in 2011.
 
And Berlusconi was unable to support Gaddafi when in 2011, Sarkozy and -- decide to attack Gaddafi and opted for regime change in Libya. Berlusconi 
 
 was at that moment, the 2011 too much discredit both at European level because the economy as you mentioned.
 
The Italian economy was in crisis and risk compromising the Eurozone. And he has also described it for the investigation of the Italian judiciary.
 <br>[11:15:00]
 
So I think that to the history for the history of the Berlusconi, for the Berlusconi history 2011 was a key point, a turning point of his success or 
 
 failure and yes, from this point --
 
ANDERSON: Arturo it's good to have you on sir. I'm going to just close this out at this point. So I don't want to bring up some pictures coming out of 
 
 the states for us at present, but it's really good to have you on your insight and analysis so important on the day that we are reporting the 
 
 death of Silvio Berlusconi aged 86.
 
Let me get you these live pictures coming out of the U.S.; Donald Trump's motorcade departing his club in Bedminster, New Jersey, the Former 
 
 President is headed to the airport bound for Miami. That is where he will huddle with his legal team ahead of what is an historic arraignment 
 
 tomorrow. But the Former President says even a conviction will not slow down his race for the White House, more on that after this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: Now let's get you to these live pictures once again of Former U.S. President Donald Trump on the Highway in his motorcade headed to the 
 
 airport in Newark, New Jersey. That is where he is expected to board a flight bound for Miami in Florida later this hour.
 
That is a day of course before he is set to appear in federal court Tuesday to face 37 criminal counts. Those charges related to his handling of 
 
 classified documents after he left office. Trump has said even if convicted, he won't leave the 2024 presidential race.
 
In fact, he has scheduled a fundraiser at his Bedminster, New Jersey Golf Club following Tuesday's arraignment. CNN's Senior Crime and Justice 
 
 Reporter Katelyn Polantz plans has the latest from Miami this arraignment it seems getting in the way of his intention to raise further funds for his 
 
 2024.
 
It is important to note that not only has he said that this won't get in the way of his run it is likely or conceivable that the case itself won't 
 
 get in the way of his run for office. Just bring us up to date with what exactly we know at this point?
 
KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE REPORTER: Well, Becky he certainly may want to take the opportunity to try and do political actions 
 
 and have political moments around these court appearances. And already Donald Trump has announced that he is going to do a speech, give a speech 
 
 Tomorrow night in New Jersey after he has these legal proceedings.
 <br>[11:20:00]
 
But over the next 24 hours or so, we do have quite a significant legal process for the former president. This is the moment where he will be 
 
 facing his charges for the first time; he will be entering an initial plea of not guilty. And then in court, he will get to hear exactly what's going 
 
 to be happening next in his case.
 
ANDERSON: Thank you. Donald Trump on his way to the airport bound as we understand it for Miami. Well, former Scottish First Minister Nicola 
 
 Sturgeon is declaring and I quote her here, "I am innocent of any wrongdoing".
 
She was arrested and then released without charge on Sunday in connection with the probing to hurt Scottish National Party's finances. Police are 
 
 investigating funds specifically earmarked for a second independence referendum campaign. Want to get you up to speed on some of the other 
 
 stories that are on our radar right now.
 
And Australian authorities have arrested the bus driver involved in a horrific crash that left at least 10 people dead. The 58 year old man faces 
 
 numerous charges including negligent driving. The boss was returning from a wedding on Sunday in New South Wales when it flipped on its side on a 
 
 roundabout the cause of the crash is still under investigation.
 
Well, three UK diving enthusiasts missing off the dramatic boat fire that you see here. They've died that's been confirmed by the tour operator. The 
 
 vessel caught fire in the Red Sea of Egypt on Sunday. 26 others were rescued including this man who jumped to safety. Early reports brain the 
 
 fire on an electrical short.
 
While Iraqi lawmakers have approved a record $153 billion budget covering three years, it's the largest in the country's history and is expected to 
 
 create more jobs in the public sector. But a Kurdish lawmaker says Iraq's budget deficit is also at a record high at $49 billion.
 
Well, that was the sing along, Man City singing along to the Oasis classic wonder wall after winning the Champions League final. The club is keeping 
 
 the party going with a hometown parade today. They will ride in an open top bus through the streets of Man City's center Manchester City center 
 
 celebrating with all three trophies from this year's historic travel season, the Premier League, the FA Cup and the Champions League.
 
CNN's Sport Senior Analyst Darren Lewis joins us from the epicenter of where those celebrations will be in Manchester where fans are beginning and 
 
 I can hear them are beginning to gather for that trophy parade. I can hear him, can you see him Darren?
 
DARREN LEWIS, CNN SPORT SENIOR ANALYST: I can indeed Becky, with every tram that arrives here, there are more and more city finds pouring into the city 
 
 center. There are roads coned off. You can probably hear that singer right there. A little bit of clearing of the throat I would say ahead of the main 
 
 event this evening.
 
It will begin at around about 7.30, it will start to my right down in -- Street, will be an open top bus parade. That will finish over here to my 
 
 left. I'll just pan around to my left behind those holdings over there the green holdings. You can see the pyrotechnics at the top the chaps who will 
 
 be getting ready to let those off as well.
 
And on the other side of that green holding, there is a big stage which has been constructed a giant mural celebrating the kings of Europe and rightly 
 
 so the winners of the Premier League for a fifth time in six seasons, another FA Cup for them.
 
And now the one they've craved ever since they brought Pep Guardiola to the club, the Champions League where a wonderful victory does for them. Finals 
 
 are not pretty Becky; they're there to be won. And that's exactly what city did in Istanbul on Saturday night.
 
ANDERSON: Yes, is no gala, the Oasis front man who of course is a massive Man City fan, I'm sure will be in amongst those fans. It was so wonderful 
 
 that the team will play I was thinking on the way back from Turkey of course.
 
What a result, they're just a second team to complete an English travel, the domestic cup and league with the European Cup. Other teams so in Spain 
 
 elsewhere have done similar. Can you describe to our audiences how this achievement ranks in the annals of footballing history?
 <br>[11:25:00]
 
LEWIS: It's a really important question because, as you say, other teams have completed the triple eight in total. I think what makes it interesting 
 
 for City and the reason why so many people feel it is such a meritorious achievement is because the Premier League with the economic power that it 
 
 has, and so many big clubs well finance is the most difficult in Europe to win.
 
And as far as Manchester City are concerned, they have overcome for example, a Chelsea ciders spent half a billion pounds this year. They've 
 
 overcome Arsenal who have recalibrated their sign to their under their young manager, Mikel Arteta, their American investors have been there for 
 
 quite some time.
 
And we're aiming to win only their first title in 20 years fell short in a year where they would otherwise have won had it not been for the brilliance 
 
 of our city. And of course, you've got the superpowers that are Manchester United and Liverpool.
 
So it's a really, really difficult league to win. But city have done it with outstanding management from Pep Guardiola. And they've gone on to beat 
 
 on the way to winning the Champions League, Real Madrid who've won it five times in the last nine years.
 
It's a fabulous achievement by city. Some fans may be willing to decry it and lots of fans will talk about the money, the financial investment. But 
 
 in terms of the football, Becky, there's a very significant reason why the party will start to continue, log into the night.
 
ANDERSON: Yes, absolutely. I mean, we're headlining this I think I was looking at the chyron button below you, it says that they will in a 
 
 thriller in Istanbul. I don't think we should necessarily describe it as a thriller. But they have had a thrilling season.
 
And let's hope they enjoy it with their fans half of Manchester, blue half of Manchester, getting ready to celebrate Man City's historic treble. Thank 
 
 you and there is a notable geopolitical takeaway from Man City's historic win. Take a look at this.
 
This picture is of the UAE President Mohammed bin Zayed along with his Vice President and Man City Club Owner, his Brother Mansour bin Zayed watching 
 
 the match in Istanbul with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. You could call this football diplomacy. The two countries of course had frosty 
 
 relations and until a reset about a year ago.
 
And there are other examples of regional leaders meeting a big matches that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the Qatari Amir Tamim bin Hamad 
 
 Al Thani at the World Cup in Doha last November, the Amir wearing a scarf with a Saudi flag.
 
Saudi Arabia was among the nations that participated in a year's long blockade of Qatar that was lifted in 2021. Right, we're going to take a 
 
 very short break, back after this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:30:00]
 
ANDERSON: Welcome back. You're watching "Connect the World" with me Becky Anderson. Time here in the UAE 7:30. These are live pictures at 11:30 a.m. 
 
 on the Eastern Seaboard. Right now former U.S. President Donald Trump on the way to the airport in Newark, New Jersey.
 
He is on his way to Florida for an appearance in federal court tomorrow where he will be arraigned on 37 felony charges related to his handling of 
 
 classified documents. Trump has denied any wrongdoing and over the weekend railed against the indictment, calling it a joke and a political hit job. 
 
 More on that, of course as we get it.
 
Well, Ukraine says its forces are gaining momentum and taking back territory following fierce fighting along the southern and eastern 
 
 frontlines. Kyiv claims its troops have recaptured a string of villages from the Russian military along the Donetsk Zaporizhzhia regional border.
 
Moscow, on the other hand, says its counter attack is underway in Zaporizhzhia. All this happening as evacuation efforts continuing has sown 
 
 nearly one week after the collapse of the crucial Nova Kakhovka dam.
 
Officials say water levels are receding in areas of the West Bank of the Dnipro River. And the team from the International Criminal Court has 
 
 visited the dam area for an investigation into the breach. So far, 14 people have died and more than 2700 have been rescued from flooded areas.
 
Well my next guest blames Russia for the dam collapse and has met with the EU's climate team calling for Europe to stand united against what he calls 
 
 Russia's Ecocide in Ukraine. He tweeted, "The environmental damage due to the blowing up of the dam or Russian Federation is immense and Trans 
 
 boundary".
 
At a meeting with nature conservation organizations, I asked to send their missions to Ukraine to help us elaborate a recovery plan. Ukraine's 
 
 Environment Minister Ruslan Strilets joins me now live from Kyiv. And we know that you certainly blame Russia for this dam collapse.
 
Currently there are investigations ongoing. What we do know is that the catastrophe that is the very dam collapse itself is wide ranging. Just 
 
 explain what the sort of you know, what the fallout and the impact has been from this collapse and how wide reaching is it?
 
RUSLAN STRILETS, UKRAINIAN ENVIRONMENT MINISTER: Good afternoon. The blowing up of Kakhovka dam is the largest catastrophe caused by the Russian 
 
 invaders seen the full scale invasion began in February last year. The Kakhovka dam is located on the Dnipro and Dnipro is the third largest river 
 
 in Europe. The dam held their largest water reservoir oil in Ukraine.
 
Due to the destruction of the dam by Russians, a giant wave washed away ever seen downstream. The Kakhovka reservoir has already lost 72 percent of 
 
 its water. This Russian act of terrorism has catastrophic consequences for the environment, not only in Ukraine, but also in the entire region. Russia 
 
 has wasted 18 cubic kilometers of fresh water. This amount of water is enough for the entire planet to consume for two days.
 
ANDERSON: Russia of course laying the blame on Ukraine for this breach, hang on sir. Have a listen to what the defense minister said earlier in the 
 
 wake of this attack.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SERGEI SHOIGU, RUSSIAN DEFENSE MINISTER: Aiming to prevent the offensive operations by the Russian army on this section of the frontline, the key 
 
 regime committed an act of sabotage or rather terrorist act. It led to the flooding of substantial territories and will have dire and long lasting 
 
 environmental consequences.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: As we await the full investigation and I know what your perspective is. You're very definitely blaming the Russians for this. What 
 
 has happened is that, you've said the Black Sea is turning into a garbage dump and animal cemetery.
 <br>[11:35:00]
 
Clearly the impact is awful and has long term consequences. Do you have a recovery plan in place at this point? What does that look like?
 
STRILETS: That fish and animals and oil spill of no less than 150 tones, sewage, waste chemical and field. And this is drifting down that Dnipro 
 
 River into the Black Sea, which washed the shores of six countries including Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Georgia.
 
The Black Sea is connected to the Mediterranean, which were Europe and the Middle East. Impact on climate change, we understand the impact on climate 
 
 change that over 50,000 hectares of Ukrainian forest have been flooded, at least half of them will die.
 
Massive forest fires and region on the -- Peninsula and the road leading this is completely fluid. Russia is nullifying decades of efforts for 
 
 leading climate scientists worldwide. We understand that potentially we lost about 20,000 wild animals lived in the flooded area.
 
And we understand that there is a lot of nests of birds from all over the world migration through Ukraine are drawing. Even endemic plants and 
 
 animals are dying on the water and this territory. Nine sites in the --
 
ANDERSON: Let me just, yes, that you you're describing a real disaster here both with regards the ecology, the conservation. You know, this land being 
 
 submerged creates such havoc. You are Ukraine's former minister. Sorry, you are Ukraine's environment minister.
 
I'm broadcasting this program from the UAE, you tweeted earlier that you welcomed your Emirati counterpart in Kyiv. You said you discuss the 
 
 upcoming COP28 summit due be held here, of course in Dubai later this year, as well as support in the postwar green carbon neutral recovery of Ukraine. 
 
 I just wonder for the benefit of this more regional audience, what kind of support has the UAE pledged or provided for your environmental postwar 
 
 recovery?
 
STRILETS: First of all, I would like to say that we connect with all; we're connected with all countries, with all ministers, with European 
 
 Commissioner -- . And we got a lot of support from countries and we got a lot of support from European Commission and other countries who now with 
 
 Ukraine.
 
For example, we have a huge support from Lithuania, which sent every week vehicles, cars, some units for our National Park. We always understand that 
 
 we need to get the support about scientific about our European integration process and -- as the issues.
 
So today is very important all support what we can get from our partners from our friends and this is really great support of Ukraine for today. And 
 
 I want to thank for all who support us at this very, very difficult time.
 
ANDERSON: Sir, it's good to have you on. Thank you very much indeed for joining us. We will continue to assess reporting that story and assess the 
 
 impact days to come. As we've been telling you former U.S. President Donald Trump is in his motorcade after leaving his golf club in Bedminster, New 
 
 Jersey.
 
He is headed for Newark airport and he and one of his top aides headed to court in Miami tomorrow, Tuesday on federal charges of mishandling 
 
 classified documents. And the details are beginning to emerge. Certainly we've seen those counts significant. Carlos Suarez is in Miami. And ahead 
 
 of Trump's arrival in court tomorrow, what's the security like there in Miami?
 
CARLOS SUAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well Becky, right now we are outside of the federal courthouse where the former president will make his appearance 
 
 tomorrow. And already we are starting to see a growing number of uniformed officers making sure that the perimeter is safe.
 <br>[11:40:00]
 
We're on the west side of the courthouse where all of this is set to take place. And earlier today, we saw the Federal Protective Service; they are 
 
 with the Homeland Security Department. They're the ones that are in charge of making sure that everyone inside of this courthouse is safe at all 
 
 times.
 
They put up some yellow tape closing up parts of the courthouse and they've also put up these barricades. All of it, in anticipation of the possibility 
 
 that we might see some Donald Trump's reporters show up here later today and well into tomorrow ahead of the former president, two o'clock, three 
 
 o'clock rather scheduled appearance before a federal judge here on those federal charges.
 
The city of Miami, the Miami Police Department, they're the ones that are in charge of law enforcement outside of the courthouse. They're expected to 
 
 detail some of the safety and security concerns that they have going into tomorrow.
 
We're told that officers with the Miami Police Department have all been told that they are to be on standby tomorrow, should they be needed to come 
 
 out to this location in downtown Miami. That said Becky; we are in a part of Miami that is already used to some significant security. This federal 
 
 courthouse here behind me is a brand new facility.
 
But the old one is just across the street. And right next to that is the U.S. Attorney's Office. And on that same block is the federal detention 
 
 center. And so law enforcement here in South Florida has a great deal of experience moving folks between all of these buildings.
 
But there is no doubt at this hour that we are starting to see a more high end law enforcement presence out here as we get ready for the former 
 
 president to make his way to Miami at some point tomorrow, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Yes. And quite the spectacle, of course, and perhaps understandably so this is a man who was the former president of the United 
 
 States standing as a presidential contender, or certainly hoping to for the Republican Party in 2024.
 
Just walk us through what we can expect going forward, Carlos, if you will, to the extent that you've got the detail. President Trump expected where 
 
 you are to present him tomorrow, Tuesday, what happens after this as far as his case is concerned?
 
SUAREZ: Well, we know he makes his appearance on Tuesday. And it's still unclear exactly how many journalists are going to be allowed up in the one 
 
 of the courtrooms over here at this federal courthouse, in my experience have been covered other federal cases in this very building.
 
Some journalists are allowed to bring in a cell phone and a laptop, though you need to have that cleared by a homeland security as well as the federal 
 
 courthouse officials here, we understand that this appearance in court will most likely be brief.
 
They're not going to get into the details that have been laid out in this indictment, the president is simply going to be told of the charges that he 
 
 is facing, and he will enter a plea. And then sometime after that we expect the former president to leave the federal courthouse and head back to New 
 
 Jersey.
 
One other part of the story is that unlike his appearance on state charges in New York City, this very well may play out without a whole lot of folks 
 
 seeing the former president, this building here in fact on if you can just show them here allows for folks to be brought in underground.
 
So it's conceivable that the former president and his motorcade will be brought in through this very location, it will no doubt be closed off to 
 
 much of the public. He will make his way inside where he will be with his attorneys. It is our understanding that he will be fingerprinted will most 
 
 likely have his photo taken, and then he'll have that court appearance.
 
You'll enter a not guilty plea. And then we've got to see exactly how fast this case will move in the federal court system here in South Florida. 
 
 Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Good stuff. Thank you, sir. Carlos Suarez is on the story for you. And those once again, we just explain to you what you are seeing here 
 
 at 11:44 on the Eastern Seaboard. That is Donald Trump's let's describe it as a motorcade showing those four or five black vehicles moving between his 
 
 golf club, Bedminster to Newark, New Jersey for a flight as we understand it to Miami, as we've just been explaining and reporting with Carlos.
 
That is where President, former President Donald Trump will appear in court tomorrow. Right, so oversupply and under demand for new projection for oil 
 
 prices may not bode well for big producers. CNN's Anna Stewart joins us with the details after this.

 <br>[11:45:00]
 
ANDERSON: To a mega merger in the banking industry, UBS says it has completed its takeover of Credit Suisse creating Switzerland's largest bank 
 
 by some degree. The merger was announced in March as an emergency rescue. Remember Credit Suisse was in danger of collapse after three of its 
 
 regional U.S. lenders failed; the new bank will have $5 trillion in assets.
 
UBS says it will take more than three years to fully absorb Credit Suisse and it is planning to cut jobs. Well, Goldman Sachs slashing its outlook 
 
 for oil prices by nearly 10 percent. Analysts lowered forecasts for Brent crude for December from $95 a barrel to 86. Let's have a look at where the 
 
 prices stand right now.
 
Well, Brent down at 71, spot nine. You got WTI crude at 67 spot 98. Analysts cite over supply from countries like Russia. Yes, you heard me 
 
 right, Russia and concerns over what is a fairly sluggish economy in China. It was a Chinese economy. Of course, it was expected sort of raw out of the 
 
 gate post COVID and that would have helped support these prices.
 
But we're not seeing that of lateness revision comes even though Saudi Arabia last week announced another production cut. Well, CNN's Anna Stewart 
 
 is here to explain it all. Let's just talk about what this report contains. What does it say?
 
ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER: Well, it was interesting that it is slashing the price forecast given as you mentioned a week ago, Saudi Arabia, the 
 
 biggest producer decided to make yet another cut. And actually we saw very little price movement as a result of that. So perhaps this shouldn't be 
 
 such a big surprise.
 
And in his report, they are citing the supply issues that you mentioned, for instance, an oversupply much more than expected from sanctioned 
 
 economies, including Russia, Iran and Venezuela. There's also the issue of strategic reserves being unleashed onto the market, particularly of course 
 
 from the U.S. that said they haven't refilled them.
 
So in many ways, longer term that might actually get prices back up again. And then on the demand side, Becky, you can look at a number of factors. 
 
 You mentioned China's economy. Goldman Sachs actually had a report out as well on the weekend on the back -- on the property sector.
 
ANDERSON: Right, I was just stopping Anna, because we've just seen that is Donald Trump's plane. We've just seen him get onto that flight. Just 
 
 importantly, and I'll bring Anna back. But just importantly, you know, got to point out this is Donald Trump on his way out of Newark, New Jersey on 
 
 his flight now on his way shortly to Miami. This comes ahead of a scheduled quarter appearance in Florida on Tuesday.
 <br>[11:50:00]
 
The Former U.S. President set to answer to 37 criminal charges related to his handling of classified documents. That is Donald Trump's team. They 
 
 have been there are just moments ago, Donald Trump himself climbing the steps to his plane.
 
And any goes that was moments ago and his team now also onboard, we will expect to see that flight depart relatively soon. And he will fly down to 
 
 Miami. And it'll be Tuesday when we see Donald Trump at that courthouse in Miami, and it's the beginning of an historic court event. Let's take a 
 
 short break, back after this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: Well, you know who that plane belongs to and if you don't, you can see his name on the side of it there. That is Donald Trump's aircraft, 
 
 he has boarded. His team has boarded on the tarmac in New York that flight expected to take off bound for Miami, where we will see Donald Trump in 
 
 court to hear the charges read against him 37 felony counts.
 
We will of course, continue to report and let's stick with CNN for more. Well, Novak Djokovic achieved a feat that could significantly shift the 
 
 conversation around who is the greatest tennis player of all time. The Serbian legend one is 23rd Grand Slam title yesterday overtaking Rafael as 
 
 the tennis player with the most grand slam wins in men's tennis history.
 
Djokovic and Nadal are the last of the generation of greats that has dominated the sport in men's tennis for over a decade. I spoke with 
 
 Djokovic about that rivalry when he was in Dubai a few months back. And he reminisced about how Nadal and the recently retired Roger Federer played a 
 
 role in his story on the court, have a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
NOVAK DJOKOVIC, 23-TIME GRAND SLAM WINNER: At the beginning of my professional career, when I was kind of breaking through, it was only about 
 
 an immense side about Federer and Nadal really about their rivalry and such you know, opposite style of tennis and the epic matches they played.
 
So it was kind of hard for me to get into the mix, you know, I had to really work and achieve some great things in order to be considered to be 
 
 in a conversation with the two of these guys. So it's really an honor to be part of the era with them.
 
And you know, at times I was really pissed off to be part of the era with them. But at the same time now when I reflect on everything that I've been 
 
 through with these guys, I'm grateful because they've made me the player that I am today.
 
They made me stronger both mentally, physically. My game was improved because of all these matches that we played against each other mostly 
 
 because of the matches that I lost to them, you know, some big matches.
 <br>[11:55:00]
 
So, you know, that made me wonder that made me suffer and really go deep into understanding with my team of how to make myself better on the court.

ANDERSON: Do not write this guy off. In today's parting shot, Egyptian football champions Al Ahly cement their title as Africa's most successful 
 
 club after winning the African Champions League this weekend. A one, one draw against Moroccan club Wydad on a home turf in Casablanca gave the 
 
 Egyptian team their 11th African Champions League.
 
The equalizer was a close one, as Al Ahly played Mohamed Abdelmonem scored with 13 minutes remaining. Sparking celebration across the stands for the 
 
 Egyptian champions who now have twice as many African Champions League trophies as their nearest rivals. That's it from us, more news on CNN after 
 
 this.
