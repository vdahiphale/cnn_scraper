KIM BRUNHUBER, CNN ANCHOR: Hello and welcome to all of you watching us here in the United States, Canada, and around the world. I'm Kim Brunhuber. This is CNN NEWSROOM.
 
Kamala Harris narrows the gap against Donald Trump as the presumptive Democratic nominee sharpens her campaign on the national and global stage. 
 
U.S. authorities arrest two high-profile drug cartel kingpins, but details on their capture are ahead. 
 
And the Olympics opening ceremony is just hours away. We're live in Paris for all the action. 
 
ANNOUNCER: Live from Atlanta, this is CNN NEWSROOM with Kim Brunhuber.
 
BRUNHUBER: We begin with the race for the White House as Kamala Harris' presidential campaign takes form. CNN has learned that former U.S. President Barack Obama is expected to endorse her soon. 
 
The high-profile support coincides with new polling that shows Harris narrowing the gap with Republican nominee Donald Trump. A senior administration official says the vice president is making moves to prove herself to the American people, moves that include a forceful address after her meeting with the Israeli prime minister on Thursday. Tackling a foreign policy issue solo, Harris made her stance on the war in Gaza clear to Netanyahu. Here she is. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: As I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu, it is time to get this deal done. Let's get the deal done so we can get a ceasefire to end the war. Let's bring the hostages home and let's provide much needed relief to the Palestinian people. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER: Meanwhile, amid racist and sexist attacks from right-wing figures, Harris is taking on Donald Trump with a new ad. Have a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRIS (voice-over): In this election, we each face a question. What kind of country do we want to live in? 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER: The Democratic candidate dropped her first presidential campaign advertisement using Beyonce's "Freedom" track, and now Harris says she's ready to debate Trump, even though his campaign hasn't committed to any future debates until the Democratic Party formally chooses its nominee. But Harris is signaling that it's game on. Here she is. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRIS: I have agreed to the previously agreed upon September 10th debate. He agreed to that previously. Now it appears he's backpedaling, but I'm ready. And I think the voters deserve to see the split screen that exists in this race on a debate stage. And so I'm ready. Let's go. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER: Now all this comes as a "New York Times" and Siena College poll indicates there's no clear leader in the presidential race among registered voters. Trump is polling at 48 percent, Harris at 46 percent, and the margin of error is just over 3 percent. 
 
The vice president is facing criticism from another woman who once fought tooth and nail against Donald Trump, former Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley tells CNN's Jake Tapper she isn't surprised President Joe Biden dropped out of the race. Here she is.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
NIKKI HALEY (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AND FORMER SOUTH CAROLINA GOVERNOR: There is an issue that we have in D.C. where people will go into office and they won't let go. And then their staffers and their family keep propping them up. And it's a problem for the American people. And so I never thought he would make it to the election. I always said a vote for Joe Biden is a vote for Kamala Harris. And I think that's what's playing out.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER: Other Republicans have attacked the vice president as a DEI candidate, which would suggest she got her job because of her gender or race. But Haley, who recently endorsed Trump, says there are better ways for Republicans to go after Harris. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HALEY: It's not helpful. Look, I mean, we're talking about a liberal senator who literally has not accomplished very much. And what she was given, she didn't do much with. You don't need to talk about what she looks like or what gender she is to talk about that. The American people are smarter than that. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER: Haley didn't offer any apology for her attacks against Trump, which included calling him unhinged and lacking moral clarity. But she dismissed that criticism as campaign rhetoric.
 
Now, Harris doesn't have much time to make one of her most important decisions yet, picking a running mate.
 
CNN's Jeff Zeleny takes a look at the top contenders. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
HARRIS: When we fight, we win.
 
JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): The first big solo decision of Kamala Harris's new campaign could be less than two weeks away. It's one of the most accelerated vice presidential searches in modern American history, with Harris racing to round out her ticket well before the Democratic convention opens in Chicago on August 19th. 
 <br>[03:04:57]
 
Top contenders hail from some of the biggest battlegrounds, like Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, a former astronaut and Navy pilot. Governor Roy Cooper of North Carolina, a former attorney general, elected six times statewide. And Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, another former attorney general, who was won statewide three times. 
 
Also on the list, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, a 2020 rival who now calls Michigan home. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a veteran and former teacher who served more than a decade in Congress. And Governor Andy Beshear of Kentucky, a rare Democrat elected in a deep-red state. 
 
The search is well underway, through private vetting and somewhat public auditions.
 
GOV. ROY COOPER (D-NC): This is the vice president's 15th trip to the most military and veteran-friendly state in the country. 
 
ZELENY (voice-over): Harris has a long relationship with Cooper, effusively praising him just last week in Fayetteville. 
 
HARRIS: My dear friend Roy Cooper. You know, Roy and I served together when I was attorney general of California, he was attorney general of North Carolina. I've known him for almost two decades, and he is an extraordinary leader. 
 
ZELENY (voice-over): But the vice president is not tipping her hand to any favorites among the contenders, all of whom rushed to endorse her after President Biden stepped aside.
 
GOV. JOSH SHAPIRO (D-PA): We've been friends for 20 years, she's an outstanding vice president. 
 
ZELENY (voice-over): Shapiro has drawn even more attention, considering Pennsylvania is at the heart of any winning White House bid, a point he downplays in choosing a running mate. 
 
SHAPIRO: That is a deeply personal decision that should be made free from any political pressure.
 
ZELENY (voice-over): Only Harris can say how geography, biography or other personal factors weigh on her decision. 
 
On Capitol Hill this week, Kelly was not eager to talk about any vice presidential shortlist. 
 
SEN. MARK KELLY (D-AZ): Again, this is not about me, this is about the future of this country.
 
ZELENY (voice-over): Buttigieg? Less so. 
 
PETE BUTTIGIEG, U.S. TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY: I think anybody would be flattered to be mentioned in that context. No matter what, I'm going to be doing everything in my power to make sure that she's our next president.
 
ZELENY (voice-over): For Harris, it's all part of her whirlwind, and a bookend moment. Four years after answering the call from Biden to be his running mate. 
 
JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: You ready to go to work? 
 
ZELENY (voice-over): She's getting ready to make a call of her own.
 
ZELENY: The vice president has set a goal of finding a running mate by August 7th, leaving less than two weeks to make that all-important choice. Now we do know that former Attorney General Eric Holder is leading this process. I'm told teams of lawyers are going through financial records, voting records, any public statements any of these candidates have made.
 
But the reality is this is a truncated process. It's also going to culminate in conversations between the vice president and potential candidates as well. Of course, she wants to get a feel for them in a way only that she can.
 
The reality to all of this is that she has relationships with each one of these candidates. She's been traveling around the country, of course, with them. So who she feels comfortable with and who's a governing partner, I'm told, will be her guiding light.
 
Jeff Zeleny, CNN, Washington. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
BRUNHUBER: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is scheduled to travel to Mar-a-Lago today to meet with Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee. Now this comes as Netanyahu is facing growing pressure to secure a deal for a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of the hostages.
 
The Israeli leader held talks with U.S. President Joe Biden at the White House on Thursday before the two met with families of hostages. Some family members said after the meeting that they haven't been this hopeful in months that a ceasefire deal could happen. 
 
All right, I want to go live to London now and CNN's Salma Abdelaziz. So Salma, the pressure growing on Netanyahu from President Biden, from Kamala Harris, who's been more outspoken even than the president, and from the hostages' families as well. 
 
SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Right. You have a Prime Minister Netanyahu who is wading straight into the drama that is American politics this week. He met yesterday, as you mentioned, with President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, of course, the presumptive Democratic nominee. Two very different meetings. You saw that meeting with President Biden, where Prime Minister Netanyahu seemed to be thanking him on the way out, saying, thank you for 50 years of support. Thank you for 50 years of friendship behind closed doors.
 
We understand that President Biden continued to put the pressure on getting that ceasefire deal done. Just to remind our viewers, we're talking about a six-week deal that's been on the table now for months. It's an effort led by U.S. negotiators, and the aim is that hostages would be traded for Palestinian prisoners and that a ceasefire on the ground would mean Israeli troops could potentially pull out of some areas. 
 
But throughout these negotiations, Prime Minister Netanyahu has been accused of dragging his feet, of prolonging the fighting to maintain political power. 
 
Some of the hostage families actually met with Prime Minister Netanyahu yesterday. They expressed hope and optimism that things are moving forward. I want you to take a listen to one of the fathers of those hostages. Take a listen.
 <br>[03:10:04]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JONATHAN DEKEL-CHEN, FATHER OF ISRAELI-AMERICAN HOSTAGE SAGUI DEKEL- CHEN: We got absolute commitment from the Biden administration and from Prime Minister Netanyahu that they understand the urgency of this moment now to waste no time and to complete this deal as it currently stands with as little change as humanly possible. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ABDELAZIZ: Now, Netanyahu will meet with Trump at Mar-a-Lago today. That will, of course, also be a significant meeting. Yet another figure who could potentially be president in just a matter of months' time. And if he was expecting, if Netanyahu was expecting a softer stance from Trump, it doesn't seem that that's what he's going to get. Trump yesterday made comments saying he needs to get this done in reference to the conflict in Gaza. So you are really looking at Prime Minister Netanyahu who arrived in
 
 the United States to ask for more help, more support for his war in Gaza, but is confronted by presidential candidates and a political establishment that is fed up and saying this is enough. We need to see this conflict end. Kim? 
 
BRUNHUBER: All right, I appreciate that, Salma Abdelaziz in London. 
 
Now, last hour, I spoke with Sanam Vakil, the Director for the Middle East and North Africa Program at Chatham House, and she outlined the challenges negotiators face in securing a Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal. Here she is.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SANAM VAKIL, DIRECTOR, MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA PROGRAM, CHATHAM HOUSE: The negotiators from the U.S., from Qatar, from Egypt have been working around the clock to try to secure that deal. But without that deal in hand, it's really hard to believe that it's possible. And for the time being, it does not yet look like Israel or Hamas is willing to make the compromises needed to get that ceasefire over the line.
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah. President Biden trying to push compromises. But it came up in a press conference whether President Biden's decision to withdraw from the race would impede his ability to either help secure a ceasefire and hostage deal for Gaza. The White House obviously says it won't. Do you think it will? 
 
VAKIL: Well, I think it could actually allow President Biden to work without pressure. He is not a lame duck. He has gravitas as a world leader and perhaps now unchained from the presidential cycle, he can speak more openly about why this is more important. 
 
Already, Vice President Kamala Harris has made it an issue. She's come out and been much more forthright and much more critical about the Israeli position and prioritized the loss of life, the need for humanitarian provision.
 
It looks like she's turning the page on Biden's approach and is very cognizant that this can become a very divisive electoral issue. And going into September, with schools going back and campus protests potentially coming back, she's conscious that she needs to take a more forthright position. 
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah, her separate meeting with Netanyahu was, of course, under the spotlight given the new context of her importance, as were her comments. I just want to play one here. Listen to this. 
 
HARRIS: What has happened in Gaza over the past nine months is devastating. The images of dead children and desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third, or fourth time. We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering. And I will not be silent. 
 
BRUNHUBER: So you spoke of a certain amount of daylight between Biden and Harris on this issue. How much is there, do you think, and what difference might it make for Israel in terms of an urgency to get a deal done now? 
 
VAKIL: Well, I think, actually, from Israel's perspective, getting a deal done immediately is certainly in its interest. Going into the fall, as this issue becomes much more heated and tied to the U.S. campaign, I think Vice President Kamala Harris might be more forthright and more critical of Israel's position and push Israel and perhaps condition Israel's access to military hardware in the United States to a change in tactic and posture. 
 
The conditions in Gaza are devastating. There is a humanitarian catastrophe, and we are looking away. It's been nine long, devastating months, and the war continues. 
 
BRUNHUBER: And could even continue longer because of her comments. According to "Haaretz", a senior Israeli diplomatic figure said of Kamala Harris's comments, it's to be hoped that the Vice President's comments at the press conference aren't interpreted by Hamas as meaning that there's daylight between the United States and Israel, which would make a deal less likely. 
 <br>[03:15:04]
 
So basically claiming there that, you know, her comments could actually delay a deal. Is that just spin? 
 
VAKIL: I think that is spin. I think that at the same time, the United States continues to demonstrate, and I think she will also, that there is a strong partnership based on values, history, trust between Israel and the U.S.

BRUNHUBER: U.S. authorities have arrested two alleged leaders of Mexico's Sinaloa drug cartel who have eluded law enforcement for decades, including the son of notorious drug lord, El Chapo, Joaquin Guzman Lopez was taken into custody in El Paso, Texas on Thursday, along with Ismael Zambada Garcia, who's known as El Mayo and thought to be the current Sinaloa leader.
 
Officials say El Mayo boarded a plane thinking he would be inspecting a property for sale in Mexico, but the plane went to the U.S., where he was met by the FBI. Both men are facing charges for allegedly running what the attorney general calls one of the most violent and powerful drug trafficking organizations in the world. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MERRICK GARLAND, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: Fentanyl is the deadliest drug threat our country has ever faced. The Justice Department will not rest until every single cartel leader, member, and associate responsible for poisoning our communities is held accountable. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) BRUNHUBER: The much-anticipated Olympic opening ceremony is just hours away. Thousands of athletes from all around the world are in France, and some have already, in fact, begun their competition. We'll have a live report from Paris. 
 
Plus, Typhoon Gaemi makes its way across southern China, bringing even more rain to a region already devastated by months of deadly downpours and floods. We'll have the latest just ahead. Stay with us.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BRUNHUBER: France's state railway company says several coordinated malicious acts, including arson, targeted high-speed train lines in France overnight, causing a large number of diversions and cancellations. Now, the disruptions come just hours before the Olympic torch relay concludes and the opening ceremony begins. The French minister of sports called it a coordinated sabotage and said travel will likely be disrupted through the weekend. 
 
And we're now just hours away from the historic opening ceremony of the Summer Olympics. Crews are still setting up for the big event, which will be the first time it won't be held inside a stadium, but instead on the famous River Seine, which weaves its way through Paris. But even before it all gets underway, the games have been rocked by the first allegations of cheating. 
 
CNN's Amanda Davis joins us now from Paris. So, Amanda, still a few hours till the opening ceremonies, and it's already off to a controversial start. A spy scandal involving Canadians, I have to admit, was not on my Olympic bingo card here. 
 
AMANDA DAVIS, CNN WORLD SPORT: No, I have to say, Kim, waking up on this long-awaited Friday morning here in Paris, it's been 100 years since Paris last hosted the Summer Olympic Games. This is not how the organizers wanted it to go.
 
As you rightly mentioned, these stories of these malicious attacks on the railway lines, we're seeing pictures emerging from Paris Montparnasse station with thousands of people stranded, the authorities saying, as you mentioned, these delays likely to impact the next couple of days here in Paris and across France. 
 
And this is an opening ceremony, particularly here in Paris, that they've said they wanted to bring in the people. And obviously, with 300,000 spectators expected to line the banks of the River Seine, we await to see what disruption that news this morning will have and will bring.
 
And then, of course, it is raining. This certainly wasn't on the agenda. The word from the sports ministry is that they will not let it affect what they hope to be a spectacular opening ceremony. They say we will just have to sing in the rain. One of the big questions is who will it be singing in the rain? I
 
 don't know whether you have seen Celine Dion recently. I haven't managed to set eyes on here in Paris, but lots of suggestions that she and Lady Gaga will be performing at this unique, never seen before Olympic opening ceremony with 100 boats carrying the 206 teams along this six-kilometer journey through the River Seine. There's going to be dances on the bridges. We know LeBron James, of course, is going to be carrying the U.S. flag alongside Coco Gauff. 
 
And the irony, really, of that phrase that I said, the talk about being this an opening ceremony that is going to bring the games to the people, the security levels around Paris over the last couple of days really have been unprecedented. We know there's always heightened security around an Olympic Games.
 
But this is the seventh Olympics that I've covered in person. I have never seen security like what we have had to deal with moving around Paris in the last couple of days. An estimated 40,000 security and police officials have been brought into the area to help keep everything safe and secure. That's, of course, the priority. 
 
And despite the negative stories that we are talking about this morning, there really is a desire, particularly in this first Olympic Games since the COVID pandemic and COVID restrictions, that things do go off smoothly without a hitch, even if the weather isn't playing its part.
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah, absolutely. All right. So it'd be fascinating to see Amanda Davis in Paris. Thank you so much. I Appreciate it. 
 <br>[03:24:58]
 
So just 20 years old, Coco Gauff is the reigning U.S. Open champion and the world number two player. Now the American tennis star is gearing up to make her Olympic debut in Paris. Plus, as we mentioned, she's going to be carrying the flag for Team USA along NBA icon LeBron James. And our Coy Wire caught up with her to ask how she's processing it all. Here she is. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
COY WIRE, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT: I'm sure she's very excited to be here at her first Olympics. It's a pretty special moment. I want you to walk me through this moment here. I think because you are so special, you have the honor of wearing this jacket during the opening ceremony and making a flag barrel with LeBron James. What's going through your mind at this point? 
 
COCO GAUFF, U.S. TENNIS PLAYER AND FLAG BEARER FOR TEAM USA: At this point, I just thought he, you know, Chris is like a brother to me and he always, you know, talks about how proud he is of me. And so I thought he was just doing a little bit too much talking. And then, yeah, once I got told that I was going to be flag bearer, obviously you could see by my reaction, I was just shocked and I didn't really know what to say. I think a lot of people were laughing at me saying, oh, because they really didn't know what to say. WIRE: Have you started the process yet that you will be repping your country alongside LeBron James? 
 
GAUFF: No, I like, I don't know when I'm going to meet him, but I'm like already like stressed about it, really. 
 
WIRE: So you've never met him before? 
 
GAUFF: No, no, I've never met him before. I'm excited to meet him and I'm excited to be flag bearer alongside him. There's no other athlete I think I would have chosen to do this with. 
 
WIRE: You talk about the racket has the potential to change the world. As divisive as times are right now with everything going on, what do you make of it all? And also what are your hopes for the game's potential ability to bring people together? That's what sports can do.
 
GAUFF: Yeah, I just hope that me being a person representing team USA and I think all of the, I don't want to speak on behalf of all Olympians on the team USA, but I feel like majority of them would agree that we all just want to promote positivity through our game and through our sport and through our competing. And I think that we all just want to show how passionate we are and share that passion with the supporters that we have and hopefully have a lot of success too. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER: And for more on the Olympic Games in Paris, we're joined now by CNN sports analyst Christine Brennan, who is live in Paris. So Christine, I just want to start with the news here, the disruptions that we've seen to the train system, acts that authorities say were sabotage. Just from what you've seen so far, what impact is that having and do we know who's behind it and what the motive might be? 
 
CHRISTINE BRENNAN, CNN SPORTS ANALYST AND SPORTS COLUMNIST, "USA TODAY": Kim, right now I think we're just trying to learn as much as we can and obviously have, of course, responsible reporting. But what it can mean is not only for potentially the movement of teams or athletes, we're trying to figure that out, of course, but also for fans.
 
And we know that there are thousands of fans who have come into Paris for this one event. As Amanda was saying, the first time in 100 years, Paris, the beautiful city hosting the Olympic Games. This has been discussed for years. This is the first non-COVID Olympics, even though we're still in COVID. But in terms of testing and masks, the first time since 2018 that the Olympics does not have to worry about all of that, the way we did in Tokyo and in Beijing for the Winter Olympics. 
 
And yet now, here I am standing in a light mist, the rain, of course, which could impact the Seine River opening ceremony to who knows to what degree.
 
And then also, can fans actually then get to their places with the way the train situation is. So an Olympics is unlike any other sporting event. A World Cup is in many different cities here. We are all focused on Paris. The world comes to Paris. The athletes come to Paris. All the fans.
 
And to hear about any disruption, of course, it can be a very difficult time. And we will, of course, continue to report on this in the hours ahead. 
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah, security, Christine, obviously a huge concern. Already we had that elevated terror threat. So just adding now these acts of sabotage. So how big is the security presence there? You know, you've covered your share of Olympics before. So is it sort of the same as previous events, or is it a different order of magnitude this time? 
 
BRENNAN: This is actually my 21st in a row going back to L.A. in 1984. I started in kindergarten, I think. Certainly, this is as beautiful and as noteworthy (inaudible) has hosted the Olympic Games. There have been some amazing ones. But the presence is extraordinary. 
 
At my hotel, which is right across the street from the main press center. So it is an important area of focus, certainly, of security. Really, for the last, I'd say, 48 hours, I have watched security guards in front of my hotel holding machine guns with their finger on the trigger. I don't know that I've ever seen that. Maybe Athens in 2004, which was the first summer Olympics after 9/11. But that's amazing. But it's also smart and it's necessary because of what a target in Olympic Games can be.
 
I was over by the Opera, the Intercontinental Hotel, yesterday and watched at least 20 officers come through with machine guns just walking down the street. I think what we interpreted it to be at that moment was a sign, a show of just the strength. And that would be an area where there are certainly many dignitaries. So yes, there's a presence. But Paris is still Paris. And I think that's an important thing to say. It's still this beautiful city. 
 
KIM BRUNHUBER, CNN ANCHOR: I know. I'm so jealous, I have to say. So listen, we spent all this time. We haven't actually talked sports here. So let's talk sports. For Team USA across the Olympics, what kind of games do you predict we'll see? How will the U.S. do and who will shine? 
 
BRENNAN: You know, I think the U.S. will do very well. Obviously, American athletes care incredibly about the Olympic Games and focus three years, in this case, from Tokyo in 2021 now to Paris. But because it's only three years as opposed to four, you'll see more familiar names.
 
I mean, it's just a little bit easier to make it again in three years. It's not easy by any means, Kim. But you'll see some of the carryover and certainly the two biggest names for the U.S. in terms of, you know, going into these games. Simone Biles, the gymnast, coming back after an incredible Olympics in Rio in 2016. 
 
Then the difficulties with mental health, the twisties, all the things we learned about. She was so honest and so forthcoming three years ago. She is back better than ever. I expect her to win several gold medals, lead the U.S. to the gymnastics team gold, and Simone herself to be able to come back and win the individual all-around. But lots of pressure on her as well. 
 
And then moving to the pool, Katie Ledecky, the great Katie Ledecky, in her fourth Olympic Games. She will be swimming tomorrow morning in the women's 400 freestyle. That is one she probably will not win. But she will, the longer the races go, Kim, the better Katie Ledecky does. And the 800 meters, the 1,500 meters, those are her babies. And she should win both of those gold medals and also win a medal with the U.S. women's 4x200 freestyle relay.
 
So Katie Ledecky is a veteran but still doing great. And here's the great thing about both of them. Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, they were born within three days of each other in March of 1997. What a week that was for American sports. 
 
BRUNHUBER: Absolutely. As you well know, every Olympic Games has its share of unique stories. I can't wait to see how these ones unfold. Christine Brennan, thanks again for coming on with us. I Appreciate it.
 
BRENNAN: My pleasure. Thank you. 
 
BRUNHUBER: All right, and we just want to give you a programming note for all of you on CNN International and CNN Max. You can tune in to our special one-hour program, "Aiming for Gold," this Friday at 7 in the evening Paris time. That's 1 p.m. Eastern in New York. And you can join CNN's Amanda Davis, Melissa Bell, and Coy Wire to share the excitement of the opening ceremony.
 
All right, still ahead. Russia and China stage a joint show of force by sending their bombers near Alaska. Why? The U.S. is concerned, even though it says the flight itself wasn't a threat. We'll explain coming up. Stay with us.

BRUNHUBER: Firefighters have been battling California's so-called Park Fire burning in Butte and Tehama counties. The blaze has grown to more than 120,000 acres, or 480 square kilometers, and is only 3 percent contained. A 42-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of starting the fire by pushing a burning car into a ditch. High winds and extreme temperatures have fueled the rapidly growing fire.
 
And two fires are devastating Canada's largest national park and are leaving areas of a town within it reduced to ash and ruins. Parts of Jasper National Park in Alberta are burning, and 25,000 residents and visitors have fled the town of the same name. Virginal Premier Daniel Smith estimated that up to half of the town's buildings may have been damaged or destroyed. It's hoped cooler weather and rain moving in over the next three days will slow down the frames. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has approved federal assistance for evacuation and firefighting. Typhoon Gaemi, is continuing its path through the southeastern China.
 
 It could bring up to 400 millimeters or 15 inches of rain to already soaked provinces. In the summer, marked by natural disasters, the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter is forced to come face-to-face with the deepening challenges posed by climate change. 
 
Our Marc Stewart brings us the latest from Beijing.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MARC STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Tropical storm Gaemi blasts China with another round of heavy rain, the latest blow in a summer of flooding. 
 
A frantic rescue in central China, an emergency worker clings on to this woman as she's hoisted into a boat. 
 
She points to her grandparents still trapped in the fast-moving floodwater.
 
Further south, another scene of desperation, as elderly people are carried to safety after a deadly flash flood hits their village. 
 
In another province, this is what's left of a water-ravaged bridge, submerging at least 25 cars, claiming more than a dozen lives. 
 
Scenes of devastation, like this water-covered home, as government scientists warn China is sensitive to climate change.
 
Recent disasters have cost the world's second-largest economy more than $10 billion in economic losses in the first half of the year. Over 32 million people have been impacted, according to government data.

STEWART: Even though this typhoon, now turned tropical storm, has been losing power as it moves its way through China, it still does not mean that every inch of rain isn't of concern. The ground is already saturated, so this extra rainfall certainly poses an additional threat.
 
Yet observers point out China is making progress when it comes to things such as flood warnings and infrastructure development. Yet they also point out, Kim, that a lot more work still needs to be done. 
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah, absolutely. All right. Marc Stewart, live in Beijing. Thanks so much.
 
Flexing the military muscle near Alaska in a clear message meant for Washington, still had Russia and China send their bombers into the Arctic and draw a quick response from the U.S. and Canadian fighter jets. Stay with us.

BRUNHUBER: White House says it's still concerned about collaboration between Russia and China after their joint show of force near Alaska. In a first, Chinese bombers joined Russian planes to conduct a patrol together before being intercepted by US and Canadian fighter jets. 
 
CNN's Natasha Bertrand has details from the Pentagon. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: The Russian and Chinese bombers were intercepted by U.S. and Canadian fighter jets off the coast of Alaska on Tuesday in what marked the first time that Russian and Chinese bombers have operated in this area.
 
And while the bombers did not necessarily come close to the United States or Canada, they stayed roughly 200 miles away from the coastline. It was still a concerning development, according to U.S. officials, because, of course, it showcases just how closely now the Russians and the Chinese are operating together. And the fact that the Chinese are now sending bombers, it appears, to this area, which is known as Alaska's air defense identification zone.
 <br>[03:45:09]
 
It is still technically international airspace, but any time a foreign entity enters that zone, the U.S. does respond by scrambling jets and intercepting those flights. And so while there was never any risk that was posed to the United States or Canada, according to a statement from NORAD, it is still important for US officials to be able to show the Chinese and the Russians that they are able to track them and monitor them in real time. 
 
And Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, he did speak to this. He said that it was not a surprise to the U.S. that this was occurring because the U.S. was able to monitor these bombers really the entire time that they were in the zone, that air defense identification zone, and even before that. But still, it obviously is a sign of just how closely the Russian and Chinese militaries are cooperating now.
 
And clearly, it was also meant as a sign and a show of strength by the Russian and Chinese militaries to convey to the U.S. that they are now working together in an area where the Chinese really have not been present before in the Arctic, near that air defense identification zone. So something that the U.S. is watching very closely here.

BRUNHUBER: The U.S. state with the country's largest homeless population has gotten the green light to dismantle encampments. California Governor Gavin Newsom, with the backing of a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision, issued the executive order on Thursday. He called on state officials to remove the homeless encampments in a humane and dignified manner. Advocates for the unhoused are critical of the move, saying the order will deprive thousands of vulnerable people who have nowhere else to go of their only means of shelter.

RANDI KAYE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): One of the best known political campaign songs of all time, "Tippecanoe and Tyler Too." The 1840 hit sang the praises of Whig Party candidates William Henry Harrison and his running mate, John Tyler. The song referenced the site of Harrison's 1811 battle between his Indiana militia and Native Americans. 
 
For years, candidates used folk songs and show tunes before that gave way to the popular music of today, all of it setting the tone for a campaign.

BRUNHUBER: A Virginia congresswoman has become the first U.S. lawmaker to use an A.I.-generated voice on the House floor. Jennifer Wexton has been battling supranuclear palsy, and the rare neurological disorder has robbed her of the ability to speak clearly.

Well, if you fly on Southwest Airlines, this could come as either good or bad news. The low fare carrier announced it's shifting to assigned seats for the first time in its 50-year history, allowing the airline to charge a premium for some seats on its planes. Southwest says the decision comes after listening to their customers, who said their number one reason for switching to a competitor was their unhappiness over the airline's trademark open seating policy.
