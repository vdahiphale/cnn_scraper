KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN ANCHOR: Hello there. I'm Kristie Lou Stout live from Hong Kong. Ahead on CNN Newsroom, stuck in limbo. The U.S. Supreme Court keeps controversial border restrictions in place, leaving countless migrants with nowhere to go.
 
Plus, reopening after zero-COVID how some countries are responding to China easing its travel rules. And Ukrainian civilians come under attack again after maternity ward is hit by Russian shells.
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the Biden administration's plan to lift Title 42, ruling that the Trump era border restriction will remain in place while legal challenges play out. Since March of 2020, that controversial policy has allowed border agents to turn away migrants in the name of COVID prevention. And 19 Republican led states have filed a lawsuit saying that unwinding Title 42 would result in a migration catastrophe. Although this is a blow to the Biden administration's plan, the White House says it will comply with the ruling.

JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: The court is not going to decide until June apparently, and in the meantime we have to enforce it, but I think it's overdue.

LU STOUT: Meanwhile, thousands of migrants at America's southern border remain in limbo, with many wondering when they'll be able to seek asylum. The Department of Homeland Security issued this statement, quote, the border is not open and we will continue to fully enforce our immigration laws, but we do so within the constraints of a decades old immigration system that everyone agrees is broken, unquote. Our CNN's Rosa Flores has more on how migrants are reacting to the decision.

ROSA FLORES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): One year old Brenda has no shoes. Her tiny feet bear on the cold pavement of an El Paso parking lot. 
 
FLORES (on camera): Are you going to sleep outside again? What are you going to do?
 
FLORES (voiceover): Her parents, Anthony Blanco and Glenda Mato, say they wrapped this rosary around her ankle for protection when they left Venezuela four months ago and say it has saved her life multiple times in the Darien Gap, a dangerous jungle between south and Central America.
 
FLORES (on camera): He says that the most dangerous part of the journey was through the Darien Gap. He and his daughter almost lost their lives three times. And they say that they saw adults who died. They saw children who died.
 
FLORES (voiceover): Brenda's most recent brush with death, they say crossing the Rio Grande into El Paso. 
 
FLORES (on camera): She says that she thought that her daughter was going to die overnight because it was so cold. They had just crossed the river. They were wet.
 
FLORES (voiceover): Desperate, Mato says she started knocking on doors, asking for help. 
 
FLORES (on camera): She says that she prayed to God that she hugged her daughter as tight as she could and tried to warm her with her own body heat as much as she could to try to save her daughter's life. 
 
FLORES (voiceover): The Blanco family is part of the growing number of migrants who are crossing into the U.S. during this latest surge.
 
This as the Supreme Court ruled that the Trump air pandemic public health role known as Title 42 remains in place while the legal challenges play out.
 
Migrants like them line the streets of El Paso near a Catholic church that turns into a shelter overnight. Many here have no money for transportation and some have no family in the United States.
 
FLORES (on camera): He says that they don't know anyone.
 
FLORES (voiceover): The Texas National Guard erected over 2 miles of fencing along the U.S. side of the Rio Grande in El Paso in the past week. The barrier is not deterring up to 1,600 migrants Border Patrol is encountering every day a federal law enforcement source says. Migrants like Selena Barrella (ph), a Venezuelan mother of two, has decided to wait in Sudas Juarez, Mexico, where she says shelters are at capacity, which means sleeping on the street. 
 
Officials there say they don't know how many migrants are waiting in their city for Title 42 to end. Advocates and officials in the three northern Mexican cities of the Juana, Renosa and Matamoros estimate nearly 22,000 migrants are waiting in shelters on the streets and in camps.
 
As for the Blancos, they credit the rosary with a tiny image of Our Lady of Guadalupe for saving them during their journey.
 <br>[01:05:00]
 
FLORES (on camera): Brenda's parents and other migrants here in El Paso are conducted confused about the implications of the Supreme Court ruling. They just don't know how it's going to impact them.
 
Now, I'm also in contact with advocates and officials on the Mexican side of the border, and their leadership is afraid of delivering the message to migrants because they're afraid of how they're going to react. I'm in contact with at least one migrant in one Mexican border city who says he just wants to cross over illegally into the United States. Now, a lot of the people that you see behind me, that's where they were before they crossed the border, some of them taking the risk of entering the country illegally. Rosa Flores, CNN, El Paso, Texas.

LU STOUT: Dylan Corbett joins us now from El Paso, Texas. He is the executive director of the Hope Border Institute. And thank you, sir, for joining us.
 
Let's first talk about Title 42. The Supreme Court has ruled that the border program to expel migrants must remain in place. So that does this mean for your work and what does this mean for migrants? 
 
DYLAN CORBETT, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, HOPE BORDER INSTITUTE: Yes, you know, it's a really difficult moment. This was sad news. Title 42 has been around for about three years, and during that time, we've had major restrictions on the ability of asylum seekers and migrants to access protection at the U.S.-Mexico border.
 
This is really a relic of the previous administration. The previous administration did everything it can to really deploy a politics of xenophobia, a politics of fear, and seal the border to vulnerable people. And that's precisely what Title 42 does. It put too many people's lives in danger. It's returned migrants back to situations and are really dangerous for them and has taken people's lives.
 
So today's decision is disheartening. It adds another layer of confusion to a really difficult situation at the border. But we'll continue to work to pick up the pieces. 
 
LU STOUT: Yes. So agencies like yours, as you say, you have no choice. You must pick up the pieces here. And you've been working overtime at Christmas, you know, during the holiday season to help a massive wave of migrants during also a historic winter freeze. You know, how's it going? How are you helping them? 
 
CORBETT: Yes, it's quite difficult right now because the situation of Title 42 is still in place. As we heard, the Supreme Court has decided that it will be several months before it gets a final hearing at the Supreme Court and we get a final decision, even though this administration has committed to rolling back the policy.
 
But effectively, what it means is that asylum seekers trying to get an access asylum and protection at the border could be turned away and are effectively be turned away - turning away, being turned away. And what that means is they're being sent to communities in northern Mexico that really don't have the social supports, the services that are necessary to take care of people who are navigating a really complex system of asylum from the other side of the border. People are there for weeks. People are there for months. I've known people who have been there for over a year. 
 
We're talking about families. We're talking about moms and dads with children and people who are bona fide asylum seekers. They're fleeing desperate situations of violence and persecution. We know the situation right now in Nicaragua, in Cuba, in Venezuela, the difficult circumstances in Central America, and people know the risks.
 
As you said, right now it's cold at the border. We've had several nights where we drop below zero. But these are people who are very conscious of the risks, conscious of the dangers, conscious of the fact that they might be put in danger by a policy like Title 42, but still make the risk, still make the journey, because they're looking for a shot at freedom. They're looking for a shot at safety. 
 
LU STOUT: Yes, they're making the journey to flee, as you pointed out, violence, persecution, poverty. They're seeking a new opportunity, and the pressure is building there at the border. You, other agencies, community groups there are working during a very critical time. Again, it's all taking place in the holidays. You know, has this moment turned out to be, in a way, a lesson about hope, about dignity, about humanity? 
 
CORBETT: I think so. Fundamentally, Title 42 is unsustainable. It puts really enormous pressures on individual border enforcement agents who are on the line and who have to return people under this policy. It puts huge pressures on border communities that are standing up to provide what they can on both sides of the border. And it puts enormous pressures, of course, on migrants themselves who have no other choice.
 
Many of these migrants, you know, I talked to a mom recently, and she told me that she couldn't go back because the situation back in her home country, her community was so bad that she really risked death if she was going back. So she couldn't go back to her home country, but she couldn't go north to the United States. So she was in an effective limbo.
 <br>[01:10:03]
 
And so that gives you a sense of how difficult the situation is here, and everyone's wrestling to pick up the pieces and do their part. We can do this. This is something that we know that we can do. Border communities have been receiving people for decades. The folks who are coming to the border now, they really represent the latest wave, the latest generation in a long history of people coming to the border and finding safety, finding protection, and having a chance to be integrated into our societies.
 
El Paso, here on the border, this is something we do every day. We come together despite the challenges. We're a community that, you know, we're a quarter of our population is foreign born. More than 80 percent of us have Mexican-American, Mexican heritage. And we're safe community, not in spite of migration, but because of it. 
 
LU STOUT: Yes.
 
CORBETT: And so this is work that's in our DNA. We know that migrants come, they enrich our community, and when welcome them with dignity, we're all better off for it. 
 
LU STOUT: Dylan Corbett, we thank you for your work. We thank you for joining us. 
 
CORBETT: Thank you. 
 
LU STOUT: As Beijing continues to peel away layers of COVID restrictions, other countries are taking precautions to make sure that incoming travelers aren't bringing the virus with them. All travelers from China will be tested for the virus upon entering Japan and India, and will have to quarantine if they test positive.
 
India has expanded the restriction beyond just mainland China, also requiring anyone coming from Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, or Thailand to undergo testing.
 
Italian officials are also testing every traveler from China who comes through the Milan Malpensa International Airport in the north. The change in China's restrictions also means that some Chinese citizens will finally be able to return home after years away due to the pandemic. Selina Wang has more. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)
 
SELINA WANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The world's harshest quarantine is no more. As COVID sweeps through China, the country is scrapping quarantines for inbound travelers from January 8 and promising to gradually restart outbound tourism. Since the start of the pandemic, China has severely limited who can go in and out of the country, drastically cutting the number of flights and forcing all incoming arrivals into government facilities.
 
I went through multiple quarantines in China this year, lasting as long as 21 days. There's no choice of where you go or what room you get. Once the doors closed, you can only open them for COVID tests and food pickups. Workers spray disinfectant in the hallways every few hours. Food delivery is not allowed, but breakfast, lunch, and dinner are part of quarantine fees. All of that is now soon going away. It's a huge relief for Chinese nationals living overseas, like this woman in New York City. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I really want to go back to my home immediately. And right now I'm very emotional. I'm always almost like in tears right now. 
 
WANG (on camera): When's the last time you went home to China? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Four years before. I lost several of my family
 
 members during the pandemic. I lost my beloved golden retriever. I feel like I missed everything. 
 
WANG: How is your family doing now in China/
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right now almost everyone got COVID and they are suffering. When my grandpa filmed me a video call, I cried so badly at that moment, I even don't know if I will get chance to see him. He just got COVID, and I hope he will be OK. 
 
WANG (voiceover): On Chinese social media, people have been sharing everything they've lost during three years of border controls while they were stuck out of their home country. One writes, I received the bad news of my father's unexpected death while I was in a quarantine hotel, but I couldn't go back to see him for the last time. Another writes, because of the pandemic, I didn't even know that my grandma passed away, and I heard it from my mother a month later.
 
This new change finally ends china's ban on nonessential travel for Chinese citizens. I feel like the pandemic is finally over. The travel plans I made three years ago may finally become a reality, she says. It's exciting news for potential travelers, but at home, the country is struggling to grapple with an explosion in COVID cases.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The hospital is just overwhelmed from top to bottom. There was no preparation. Like nobody knew. There was no stockpile of medications. 
 
WANG: This viral video in the southern city of Guangzhou shows a man kneeling on the ground at a female fever clinic, breaking down and begging the nurse to let him see the doctor after waiting for hours.
 <br>[01:15:06]
 
Fever and cold medicine are nearly impossible to get at drug stores across the country. Antivirals are also extremely hard to get. But in a major move, Beijing has announced it's going to start distributing Paxlovid to community health centers in the coming days. So there's chaos and confusion, but with zero-COVID in the past, finally, there's light at the end of the tunnel. Selina Wang, CNN, Beijing.

LU STOUT: You're watching CNN Newsroom. And still ahead, a Ukrainian maternity ward hit by Russian shelling as Ukrainian officials warned that Moscow may be planning large attacks around the new year. Plus, Southwest Airlines promises it is doing everything it can to get back on track. But, it could still take several days to get stranded passengers where they're going.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
LU STOUT: In Ukraine, Russian shelling hit a hospital maternity ward in the southern city of Kherson on Tuesday, that's according to an aide to the president of Ukraine, they say that doctors managed to complete a cesarean section just before the attack and, quote, miraculously, no one was injured.
 
A shelling also reportedly hit infrastructure in other parts of the Kherson region causing civilian casualties. Meanwhile, Ukraine's prime minister says power outages are decreasing as critical infrastructure repairs are streamlined. But the country's energy minister says the situation remains really difficult. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy says the country is preparing for the months ahead. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRANIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): We continue to prepare our security and defense forces for the next year. This must be a decisive year. We understand the risks that there are in the winter. We understand what we have to do in the spring, and hence we understand what results the security and defense sector has to achieve as a whole. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
LU STOUT: Ukraine's military reports heavy fighting in the country's east. President Zelenskyy has said the situation there is difficult and painful and that pain is being felt in Kyiv, where Ukrainians gathered to pay their respects to a fallen soldier killed on the front lines. Will Ripley reports. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)
 
WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): So many tears for yet another victim of Russia's war in Ukraine. Mourners in Kyiv paying their final respects to a fallen Ukrainian soldier, a husband, brother and son. He was reportedly killed near Bakhmut.
 
Intense fighting has the city almost unrecognizable. Debris litters the streets. Buildings are on fire. 
 <br>[01:20:00]
 
Our house is destroyed. There was a shop near a building, now it's not there anymore. 
 
In this besieged city across the country, millions are still living without power. Ukraine accuses Russia of persistently targeting Ukrainian energy facilities, giving engineers little time to repair the grid before the next strike comes. Ukraine's energy minister describes the situation across his country as really difficult.
 
Strikes have left Ukraine with a power deficit, unable to meet the basic energy needs of the country. Fears are growing among Ukrainian officials, Moscow could be planning large strikes around New Year's Day.
 
In this small village near Kherson, people are bracing for a bitterly cold winter, a winter without power, collecting firewood and other supplies to protect against plummeting temperatures. 
 
TETYANA KOVALIVA, KHERSON REGION RESIDENT (through translator): We will get through the winter because we fixed the chimney and now we can heat the house. We will get through it. We do not have any other option. Where would we go? 
 
RIPLEY: On top of all this, a war of words brewing between Moscow and Kiev. Russia's foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov issuing an ultimatum. Ukraine must bow to Russia's demands, including giving up occupied Ukrainian territories, or else the Russian army will take matters into its own hands.
 
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky  says that won't happen. He's vowing to retake all captured Ukrainian ground. Diplomatic negotiations seem just as gridlocked as the battlefield. Little sign of peace coming this holiday season in a conflict that continues to grind on. Will Ripley, CNN, Lviv, Ukraine.

LU STOUT: The Kremlin appears to be making good on threats to ban oil exports to countries that impose price caps on Russian oil and petroleum products. Russia says President Vladimir Putin signed a decree banning the exports on Tuesday. It's a move seen as largely symbolic on countries that implemented a $60 per barrel cap on Russian crude have largely already banned the import of Russian oil due to the invasion of Ukraine.
 
The price cap policy is aimed at Moscow's remaining oil buyers and companies that provide shipping, insurance and other services.
 
CNN's Fred Pleitgen has been covering Russia's invasion since even before it began, and not just from Ukraine. He's also reported from inside Russia and Belarus as the conflict nears its second calendar year he looks back on his experiences. A warning to our viewers this report contains disturbing images. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): We had a rare opportunity to get into Belarus, and this was a few days before the invasion for joint exercises between the Russian military and the Belarusian military. And we were filming this, we were filming the exercise. There was a lot of tanks, there were a lot of helicopters in this exercise. And then all of a sudden Lukashenko showed up, the Belarusian strongman, and I immediately confronted him. 
 
The United States has said that there would be severe consequences for Belarus if an attack on Ukraine were launched from Belarusian territory by yourself or the Russian army. Do you still support Russia in its course towards Ukraine? 
 
ALEXANDER LUKASHENKO, BELARUSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Do you still believe we're going to attack Ukraine from here, or have you already overcome this mental block? 
 
PLEITGEN: He kept ranting at me, and at some point he just went away and went into his helicopter and flew off. A few days later, the invasion then did begin. One of the things that really stood out to me was that were doing a live shot on our morning show. While I was doing that live shot, the Russians launched multiple rocket launching systems towards Ukraine. And you could see them in our live shot. You could hear them, obviously, in our live shot as well. 
 
There's more rockets that's being fired right now. If we look in the sky, we can see it there. 
 
If we pan up, there's another Salvo being fired right now. So you can see in this area the Russians firing artillery rockets towards Ukraine. At the same time, we've also seen them move in heavy, heavy armor through the road that I just pointed to before. We saw Howitzers going down that road just a couple of minutes ago. 
 
That was where you could really see that the war had started in full force. We have to keep in mind that this is really the time that full on war has come back to Europe, which is quite a scary thing but again, also, of course, a very important thing to document as well. 
 
PLEITGEN (voiceover): As Russian forces retreat from the area north of Kyiv in their wake, scenes of utter destruction, whole blocks of houses flattened. Ukrainian authorities saying they believe dead bodies are still lying underneath. But here, the dead also lay in the open.
 <br>[01:25:08]
 
Ukrainian national police showed us this mass grave in Bucha, saying they believed up to 150 civilians might be buried here, but no one knows the exact number. People killed while the Russian army occupied this town. 
 
PLEITGEN (on camera): We were going around Bucha, and obviously, we found the mass grave to be an awful site, but it really hadn't dawned on me how important all of this was going to be. And so we were driving around the area, there was no cell phone connection, so we couldn't really communicate with our guys at headquarters. And then we got back into the cell phone connection area, and I got an email that said, there are reports of a mass grave in Bucha. And I wrote facts. We just came back from that mass grave, and with that, it just became this gigantic international story.
 
And then the next couple of days, we went back to Bucha pretty much every day and into the surrounding areas as well. And it was really much worse than almost anything I've ever seen. Everywhere went, there were dead bodies. There's not many things, I think, in the world that have truly moved me and shaken me. 
 
I do remember that a couple of weeks later, after I got back home and I was talking about what had happened in Bucha, it was something that definitely I did feel very emotional at that point, just remembering the things that we saw and the things that we witnessed. It was definitely devastating to have witnessed all that, but at the same time, of course, very important to shine the light on it and to document all of that for the wider public. And another thing that really stood out in the reporting was also the way that the Russians dealt with their own troops. We also got the chance to go to Chernobyl. We were the first team to go to Chernobyl. 
 
PLEITGEN (voiceover): The Russians imprisoned the security staff inside the plant's own bomb shelter. The interior minister told us no natural light, no fresh air, no communications. 
 
PLEITGEN (on camera): So the Russians kept 169 Ukrainians prisoner here the entire time they held this place. And then when the Russians left, they looted and ransacked the place.
 
PLEITGEN (voiceover): And we went to the edge of the red forest, and we obviously didn't go into the actual contaminated area, but we went to the edge of the red forest, and we found a Russian meal ration there, one of those military meal rations. And we held the meter to it, and it maxed out. The meter itself maxed out. And it showed that the Russian forces that were there must have faced radioactive contamination simply because their superiors were so negligent or just didn't care about the safety of their own troops. That was definitely something that also stood out.
 
And then also, of course, the utter destruction. The scale of the destruction that we saw around the Kyiv area and all the way up to the north to the Belarusian border was insane. I mean, it was just -- there were some pretty tough battles that have been fought there.
 
Just to give you an idea about the scale of the destruction, you have houses like these that were completely destroyed. But if we look over here, you can see that even large residential buildings have been flattened. This entire building was flattened. It was connected with this one before, but now there's absolutely nothing left of it. 
 
Covering this story has been extremely dangerous. It's been extremely important to be in a lot of these places, and I think in many ways, it's been life changing for a lot of the reporters who were there. 
 
So we're taking cover here because we just had some incoming artillery fire. We're going to wait and hope that there's not any hits anywhere close to us. 
 
I think 2022 will be remembered as being the year that full on war has come back to Europe, something that many people thought would be impossible after the horrors of World War II. But unfortunately, it turns out that there are still some who believe that war is the answer.

LU STOUT: While stunning reporting by Fred Pleitgen throughout the year, now Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny says he is being injected with an unknown drug while being held in a high security prison. The prominent critic of Putin, he made the claim in a series of tweets on Monday. He says it's part of efforts to withhold medical information from him as he battles worsening back pain. Navalny says his lawyers managed to get a copy of his medical records after filing complaints, but he says the way that they were copied makes them largely unreadable.

And up next, there are new questions surrounding the treatment of an Iranian football star's family. 
 
And just ahead, a closer look at why Ali Daei's wife and daughter were forced off a commercial flight.

STOUT: You're watching CNN NEWSROOM, I'm Kristie Lu Stout live in Hong Kong. 
 
The White House is welcoming Taiwan's decision to extend its mandatory military service amid growing threats from China. The Biden administration says the move shows Taiwan's commitment to self defense and strengthen deterrence. 
 
Now President Tsai Ing-Wen said on Tuesday that quote, "Nobody wants war. But peace does not fall from the sky." She announced that starting in 2024, all eligible men must serve in the military for a full year instead of four months. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TSAI ING-WEN, TAIWAN PRESIDENT: We can only avoid a war by preparing for a war and we can only stop a war by being capable of fighting a war. 
 
Taiwan needs to strengthen our ability to defend ourselves so that we can better protect our national security and interests and garner more international support. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
STOUT: She went on to say that lengthening the military service period was a difficult decision but is necessary to safeguard Taiwan's democratic way of life. 
 
Iranian football legend Ali Daei says he is looking for answers as to why his wife and daughter were pulled off a flight that was originally bound for Dubai on Monday. Daei has been a vocal supporter of the ongoing anti government protests in Iran. 
 
CNN's Nada Bashir has the latest.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, he's one of Iran's most legendary soccer stars but he's also become a notable critic of the Iranian regime. Now Ali Daei says a Dubai-bound flight carrying his wife and daughter was re-routed and forced to land on Kish Island in the Persian Gulf where the pair were removed from the flight by authorities.
 
Now officials have yet to offer a direct explanation as to why the soccer star's family was removed but in a now retracted article, Iran's state-run news agency IRNA reported that Daei's wife and daughter were barred from traveling as they have not informed authorities of their decision to leave the country in advance despite being ordered to do so.
 
Meanwhile Iran's semi-official (INAUDIBLE) news agency said Daei's wife had been barred from leaving the country by a court order over her alleged participation in what they have described as riots. 
 
Now, the pair are not believed to have been arrested and in a interview with Iranian media, Daei says he is in the process of arranging for their return to Tehran.
 <br>[01:34:58]
 
BASHIR: But he also said that he was not aware of any travel restrictions placed on his wife or daughter. This of course, comes amid ongoing anti regime protests in the country which have been met by violence and repression by the regime's security forces. 
 
The footballing legend himself has been a vocal supporter of the protest movement writing in a post on Instagram in September that instead of repression, violence and arresting the Iranian people the regime should solve their problems. S
 
And in November, Daei said he had rejected an official invitation to the Qatar World Cup in a show of solidarity with Iranian protesters at home. 
 
But now there are fears that Daei and his family may become the latest in a string of notable Iranian figures who has faced repression at the hands of the regime for showing solidarity with protesters in Iran.

KAFANOV: Travelers on Southwest bearing the brunt of the post- Christmas cancellations. Many stranded until the New Year. 
 
MANDI ANGELO, SOUTHWEST PASSENGER: : The next flight that was offered was in January and they couldn't even get us home back to Pittsburgh. 
 
KAFANOV: Southwest CEO Bob Jordan warned of more tough days ahead according to a transcript of a company wide message CNN has obtained.
