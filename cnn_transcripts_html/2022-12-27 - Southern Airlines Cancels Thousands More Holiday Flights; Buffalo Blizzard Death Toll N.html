JESSICA SOKOLOWSKI, SOUTHWEST PASSENGER:  And we have to wait in a line that was four hours and we're still in line and nobody is giving us any direction on what line to get in. It's a total you know what show here.
 
KAFANOV:  And for those trying to call to rebook, well, good luck getting through.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Calling Southwest, calling the airlines, they're nowhere to be found. I actually got hung up on multiple times.
 
DAVID CANUT, SOUTHWEST PASSENGER:  The problem is that Southwest, they don't give any answer, they don't answer the phone.
 
JASON FRIEDE, SOUTHWEST PASSENGER:  There's no option to rebook anything online. Oh, I've also been on hold for 5 hours and 43 minutes.
 
KAFANOV:  Passenger Jason Friede, shows us the proof.

I don't know what is going on. There's no staff. It's okay if there is no staff but we just want them to be honest with us and I could just go home. But we can't go home because we don't know where luggage is. Is it here in Atlanta, is it in Chicago? We have no idea.
 
KAFANOV:  Some passengers choosing to look at the bright side.
 
JESSICA GRAY, FLIGHT CANCELED:  It was like super stressful. But, I mean, just happy I got to see my family for Christmas, and, hey, I'm off this week, so I'll be good.

WILD:  Nothing like ending your holiday like that. 
 
President Biden has now approved an emergency declaration for western New York and what was seen there was the worst blizzard in a generation. There were 49 deaths across the country as a result of this coast-to-coast storm and 27 of them were in Erie County, New York. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MARK POLONCARZ, COUNTY EXECUTIVE, ERIE CO., NEW YORK:  I am aware of additional bodies that have been recovered and are being brought to our temporary morgue. We've had so many bodies and various hospitals are full, and we're just having to go through and determine that if the individuals had died from a blizzard-related death, we unfortunately expect that many of them will. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WILD:  Buffalo now facing the daunting task of digging out from the 40-plus inches of snow that accumulated over the past week. 
 <br>[05:05:01]
 
CNN's Miguel Marquez has more from western New York. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MIGUEL MARQUEZ, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  An unprecedented storm, devastating and deadly, hitting western New York. 
 
GOV. KATHY HOCHUL (D), NEW YORK:  We now have what'll be talked about not just today but for generations, the blizzard of '22. 
 
MARQUEZ:  Parts of Buffalo pummeled with up to 43 inches of snow and hurricane-force winds. And the death toll of at least two dozen people in the area. 
 
SHERIFF JOHN GARCIA, ERIE COUNTY, NY:  There's going to be a lot of welfare checks. And unfortunately, I have a bad feeling about that. I think that that toll is going to go up. It's just gut-wrenching. 
 
MARQUEZ:  Erie County, New York, brought to a literal standstill with people trapped in their homes and cars. POLONCARZ:  This was the first time in Buffalo fire history that they
 
 could not respond to emergency calls because of how severe the conditions were. 
 
MARQUEZ:  County officials sending in specialized trucks to rescue the rescuers. 
 
GARCIA:  I couldn't see two feet in front of my vehicle. And we had to rescue deputies. We had -- so, we brought in snow mobiles, UTVs, ATVs. 
 
When fire rigs are getting stuck, the heavy equipment, you can imagine what happens to the public. 
 
MARQUEZ:  While most major highways have at least one lane clear for emergency traffic, many residential roads are still impassable with vehicles abandoned in the middle of the street. 
 
HOCHUL:  We have had snowplows, major snowplows and rescue vehicles. I saw them myself in ditches buried in snow. 
 
MARQUEZ:  Officials urging residents, stay home. 
 
HOCHUL:  Stay off the roads so we can continue to rescue people, get them safe, and make sure that the roads are clear so that we can reopen our community as soon as humanly possible. 
 
MARQUEZ:  Buffalo under a driving ban, but that hasn't stopped some from taking advantage of the situation. Police have made arrests for looting. Videos on social media shows looters at work, merchandise being carried out on foot. 
 
MAYOR BYRON BROWN, BUFFALO, NY:  People who are out looting when people are losing their lives in this harsh winter storm is just absolutely reprehensible. 
 
MARQUEZ:  All while thousands of homes and businesses are still without power. One family who lost their heat tried to make it to a hotel on Christmas. 
 
DANIELLE TISDALE, SPENT CHRISTMAS AT BUFFALO FIREHOUSE:  You couldn't see anything. You couldn't see a stoplight. You kind of just had to drive through the intersection praying basically. 
 
MARQUEZ:  Their prayers answered by airport firefighters who were able to rescue the Tisdales along with dozens of other trapped drivers. 
 
DEMETRICE TISDALE, SPENT CHRISTMAS AT BUFFALO FIREHOUSE:  Those guys were amazing at the fire house. They treated us with nothing but love and they welcomed us with open arms. 
 
MARQUEZ:  Miguel Marquez, CNN, Western New York. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
WILD:  Travel remains treacherous on the roads in the northeast and upper Midwest. But the conditions are expected to get a little bit better over the next few days. 
 
CNN meteorologist Chad Myers is live in the weather center. 
 
So, Chad, it's going to warm up. But here's what I worry about -- I worry about a warm-up during the day and dropping below freezing overnight, which is so dangerous. The ice with a little bit of water on top, that is just -- you can't even stand on that. 
 
CHAD MYERS, AMS METEOROLOGIST:  You stole my lead, Whitney. That was exactly where I was going with this. 
 
WILD:  I'm from Michigan. I've lived there. I've seen this movie too many times. 
 
MYERS:  Absolutely, it's the freeze-thaw, freeze-thaw thing. Even as I was driving in to work, we are only down to 1. Things are frozen up. Water on the roads, froze up. That's what's going to happen from the Deep South to the Northeast. You get sun, it melts the snow, a puddle on the ground. At night the sun sets and it freezes. 
 
Something else that was going on, too. When the sun hits your roof, the snow drips down. Well, the air is still 20, that drip turns into an icicle. If those icicles are two-stories high and long and big, they can also be dangerous.
 
Right now, New York is up to 99 inches of snow so far this winter. That's more than we should have for the entire season and in a top five for Decembers altogether. The big number that we had last week or a couple of weeks ago was in Thursday and the break before Thanksgiving. That counted as November. We're top 5 for December in Buffalo. 
 
It is still snowing in some spots although that will quickly end. Something else that's happening in this thaw? Pipes are breaking. Why? Not because it's 32 or lower, because it's 32 or higher. The snow here insulating the ground, you're not going to get to 32 or higher in Buffalo. 
 
But even in my apartment, there were waterlines breaking all day yesterday because the pipes were frozen, cracks were there, no water was coming out because the pipes were clogged with ice. 
 
Now that the ice is melting and those pipes -- pipes are leaking. So, get ready for that.
 
It's almost a filling meant of your imagination. Here comes the warmer air across the Great Lakes, across the Northeast, temperatures do warm in Buffalo, all the way into the 40s, 46 will be the high there. 
 
The next storm systems, two of them, coming into the Pacific Coast. If you have not gone to sleep yet out to the Pacific Northwest, here comes your rain. 
 <br>[05:10:03]
 
An awful lot of it in some spots, flash flood watches. Also we could see with the next two systems, Whitney, we could see 6
 
 feet of snow in the Sierra. Now, don't get me wrong, they need it but you don't need it that fast. 
 
WILD:  All right. The hits keep coming. Chad Myers, thank you. 
 
MYERS:  You're welcome.
 
WILD:  All right. Turning now to the border. The number of people seeking asylum by one estimate has never been higher. Researchers at Syracuse University find that there are nearly 1.6 million asylum applications pending in U.S. immigration courts. 
 
CNN has learned there are about 22,000 migrants in northern Mexico hoping to be let into the U.S. Officials think that number is going to get bigger if the Supreme Court lifts the temporary hold and title 42. That is the Trump area immigration policy used to keep migrants out as a pandemic control measure. The Biden administration has asked the court to keep Title 42 in place until at least today. 
 
New York Congressman-elect George Santos has admitted he stretched the truth on his resume. The Republican is it apologizing for the first time since "The New York Times" raised questions about his background. In a pair of interviews, Santos admits he never graduated from college and be never worked at Goldman Sachs or Citibank. 
 
(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)
 
CONGRESSMAN-ELECT GEORGE SANTOS:  I'm not a fraud. I'm not a criminal who defrauded the entire country and made up this fictional character and ran for Congress. I've been around a long time. 
 
I mean, a lot of people know me. They know who I am. They've done businesses for me. I'm not going to make excuses for this but a lot of people overstate their resumes or twist a little bit. I'm not saying I'm not guilty of that. 
 
(END AUDIO CLIP)
 
WILD:  Santos also says that he's going to go ahead and take the House seat. CNN has reached out to the House GOP leadership as well as the national Republican congressional committee. So, more on that. Stay tuned. 
 
Still ahead on EARLY START: New revelations about the press release the White House drafted but did not sent out in the wake of the 2020 election. 
 
Plus, Vladimir Putin says he's ready to talk about peace but will Ukraine listen? 
 
And the changing face of restaurants. Are people ever going to get their appetite back for eating out after the pandemic? More on that next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [05:15:24]
 
WILD:  Welcome back to EARLY START.
 
New details are coming to light in how and when Trump aides first learned of the January 6 attack on the Capitol. In a batch of transcripts newly released by the January 6 Committee, then Press Secretary Kaylee McEnany says she learned the extent of the siege while she was grabbing some lunch. 
 
CNN's Sara Murray brings us details from these highly anticipated interviews. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KAYLEIGH MCENANY, TRUMP WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Of the entire White House --  
 
SARA MURRAY, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Donald Trump's former White House press secretary - 
 
MCENANY:  The violence we saw yesterday at our nation's capitol was appalling. 
 
MURRAY:  Didn't realize the full extent of the violence at the Capitol until she settled in to eat a turkey sandwich for lunch on January 6th. Kayleigh McEnany telling the January 6th committee: I initially went back to my office to eat lunch but I eventually turned up the volume on Fox News. 
 
McEnany saying she was piecing together what was playing out at the Capitol, not merely sitting by as the attack unfolded. 
 
I in no way, shape or form would eat a turkey sandwich if I thought the Capitol Hill was being sieged. 
 
How White House officials learned of rioters storming the Capitol on January 6 just one of the details emerging as the House Select Committee releases new batches of transcripts from roughly a thousand witness interviews. 
 
REP. BENNIE THOMPSON (D-MS):  The Select Committee intends to make public the bulk of its non-sensitive records before the end of the year. 
 
MURRAY:  A separate transcript revealing how the White House crafted a press release in December 2020 calling for the firing of anyone who accepted the election results. Hours earlier, then-Attorney General Bill Barr had told the "Associated Press" there was no widespread voter fraud. 
 
According to the draft press release: Anybody that thinks there wasn't massive fraud in 2020 election should be fired. The press release was never sent and Barr resigned from the White House later that month. Since then, he hasn't held back in criticizing Trump's election lies. WILLIAM BARR, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL:  I was somewhat demoralized
 
 because I thought, boy, if he really believes this stuff he has, you know, lost contact with -- with -- he's become detached from reality. And I went into this and would, you know, tell him how crazy some of these allegations were. There was never -- there was never an indication of interest in what the actual facts were. 
 
MURRAY:  The trickle of transcript revelations coming after the committee recommended that the Justice Department bring criminal charges against former President Trump. 
 
REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD):  There was a conspiracy to defraud the United States, to exchange an honest to goodness presidential election for a counterfeit election. 
 
MURRAY:  Trump's legal team downplaying the committee's findings. 
 
TIM PARLATORE, TRUMP LAWYER:  The report itself is not of much value. You know, it's written by politicians for political purpose.
 
MURRAY:  And dismissing its criminal referrals, even as Trump faces scrutiny from a DOJ special counsel that is now investigating his attempts to overturn the 2020 election. 
 
PARLATORE:  The referral itself is pretty much worthless. The Department of Justice doesn't have to follow it. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
MURRAY (on camera):  Now, when it comes to the committee, they've released criminal referrals and their final report. But so far, they have only scratched the surface when it comes to releasing all that underlying evidence. They released fewer than 100 transcripts, and interviewed roughly 1,000 witnesses. So, we have many more days of transcript revelations ahead of us. 
 
Sara Murray, CNN, Washington. 
 
WILD:  Sara Murray, thank you. 
 
All right. Some quick headline from across the country now.
 
Fire officials in Cumberland County, Tennessee, believe for adults and two children died after a house fire Monday. Sheriff's office is investigating. They don't think any foul by happened here. Jackson, Mississippi, is struggling to get water pressure back after cold weather triggered breaks and water lines. The citywide boil water notice remains in place there. 
 
Arizona's Democratic Governor-elect Katie Hobbs and Maricopa County are asking a court to impose financial penalties on Republican Kari Lake after a judge ruled against Lake's efforts to overturn the election. Hobbs and the county want $25,000 basically as punishment. Hobbs is also seeking more than $600,000 in attorney fees.

ROMANS:  While also asking them to pump more oil. 
 
He did the same with Saudi Arabia during the controversial visit in July. But OPEC plus did the opposite, slashing production in October.

JEROME POWELL, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIR:  We continue to anticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate. 
 
ROMANS:  Some worried the Fed's higher rates will spark a recession. They're already shaking markets and raising credit mortgage payments. But, have they lowered consumer prices? There is no clear signal yet. One thing is for sure, the effects will continue to work their way through the economy into next year. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
WILD:  Yeah, it's that Fed story that might well be one of the biggest stories of 2023, too. So, we'll see. Christine Romans, thank you so much for that. 
 
Just ahead, Americans spending more money in the run up for the holidays. Big part of that was inflation.
