RIYAD MANSOUR, PERMANENT OBSERVER TO THE UN FOR PALESTINE: The number of killed are now in excess of 17,000 Palestinians and killed and injured around 65,000. A large number of them, 70 percent of them are women and children. This is something that is so disgusting and disgraceful to see this large number of children being killed. More than any other conflict since the creation of the United Nations.

BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Israa was born the day the truce went into effect, seemingly so long ago. She lives with her parents and brother in a makeshift shelter in Deir al Balah. 
 
It lacks the basics of life, for the cold, for the winter, says her mother, also named Israa.
 
This young family is part of the 1.9 million people, 85 percent of Gaza's population, that has been displaced, displaced but still in danger.
 
Smoke rises over Rafah where so many fled to. Wednesday afternoon, this house in the Rafah's refugee camp was bombed. Inevitably in such a crowded place, children were among the dead.
 
There's no safe place in Gaza, says Eyad Al Hobbi. Any place can be hit.
 
The Palestinian Health Ministry says more than 20 people were killed in the strike, including 17 members from the same extended family. 
 
They told them the south was safe. They came here, the safe place, and they were all killed, says Basam al Hobbi. Death now stalks every corner of this land.
 
In Khan Younis, the focus of Israel's current offensive, the hospital is overwhelmed with the injured, and yet more come.
 
The World Health Organization's Gaza envoy says they're doing what they can.
 
RICHARD PEERPERKORN, W.H.O. GAZA ENVOY: But the health infrastructure is on its knees. It's almost collapsing. That is what the reality is. It's almost collapsing.
 
WEDEMAN (voice-over): Collapse, chaos, destruction, and death, such as Gaza's lot. 
 
Ben Wedeman, CNN, Jerusalem.

Turning now to Albany, NY, where a man is accused of firing two shots outside of a synagogue. The state's governor says no one was injured at the Temple Israel on Thursday. The FBI's Albany office told local media that a 25-year-old man, Mufid Fawaz Alkhader, was arrested and charged in the incident. And Albanese police chief describes why this is being investigated as a possible hate crime.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did he say anything about the Jewish faith or about Israel, or about anything that would be like a hate crime? 
 
CHIEF ERIC HAWKINS, ALBANY, NEW YORK POLICE DEPARTMENT: We were told by responding officers that he made a comment free Palestine. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is that the reason the FBI is involved in this situation? 
 
HAWKINS: Yes, that is, that is part of the reason, yes. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So, is it being investigated as a hate crime? 
 
HAWKINS: Yes.

NOBILO: The second gentleman of the United States has issued a stark warning about the rise in anti-Jewish hate in the two months since the Hamas attack on Israel. Doug Emhoff, who made history as the nation's first Jewish spouse of the president or vice president, called on Americans to unequivocally condemn anti-Semitism. 
 
During the National Menorah lighting. Ceremony which marks the start of the Jewish holiday Hanukkah, he slammed the leaders of elite universities for their remarks at a congressional hearing about alleged incidents of anti-Semitism on their campuses. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DOUG EMHOFF, U.S. SECOND GENTLEMAN: Seeing the presidents of some of our most elite universities literally unable to denounce calling for the genocide of Jews as anti-Semitic. That lack of moral clarity is simply unacceptable. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NOBILO: And the President of the University of Pennsylvania is facing calls to resign over her comments during that congressional hearing on anti-Semitism earlier this week. CNN's Miguel Marquez explains. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
REP. ELISE STEFANIK (R-NY): Ms. Magill, at Penn, does calling for the genocide of Jews violate Penn's rules or code of conduct, yes, or no?
 
LIZ MAGILL, UPENN PRESIDENT: If the speech turns into conduct, it can be harassment, yes.
 
STEFANIK: I am asking specifically calling for the genocide of Jews. Does that constitute bullying or harassment?
 
MAGILL: If it is directed and severe or pervasive, it is harassment.
 
STEFANIK: So, the answer is, yes?
 <br>[04:35:00]
 
MAGILL: It is a context-dependent decision, Congresswoman.
 
STEFANIK: It's a context dependent decision? That's your testimony today, calling for the genocide of Jews is depending upon the context? That is not bullying or harassment? This is the easiest question to answer, yes, Ms. Magill.
 
MIGUEL MARQUEZ, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Presidents of three of the country's top schools, MIT, Harvard, and the University of Pennsylvania sharply questioned this week on Capitol Hill over antisemitic rhetoric on their campuses now facing massive backlash for not taking a hardline stance against calls for genocide.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: From the river to the sea.
 
PROTESTERS CHANTING: From the river to the sea. 
 
MAGILL: I have not heard calling for the genocide for Jews on our campus.
 
STEFANIK: But you've heard chants for intifada?
 
MAGILL: I've heard chants, which can be antisemitic depending on the context when calling for the elimination of the Jewish people.
 
MARQUEZ (voice-over): So far, no protesters held accountable.
 
REP. NATHANIEL MORAN (R-TX): Have any students been expelled or disciplined for bullying, harassment, or these actions that you're listing?
 
CLAUDINE GAY, HARVARD UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT: I can assure you we have robust student disciplinary processes and we use them.
 
MORAN: No, no, no, I'm not -- I didn't ask about -- I did not ask about your process, I asked if any students had been disciplined or removed from Harvard as a result of the bullying and the harassment that's taken place based on their antisemitic views.
 
MARQUEZ (voice-over): After the hearing, University of Pennsylvania President Liz Magill attempted to clarify her remarks, issuing a video statement.
 
MAGILL: When I was asked if the call for the genocide of Jewish people on our campus would violate our policies. In that moment, I was focused on our university's long-standing policies aligned with the U.S. Constitution, which say that speech alone is not punishable. I was not focused on, but I should have been.
 
MARQUEZ (voice-over): Harvard's President Claudine Gay issued a written statement after the House committee hearing, in part, saying: Calls for violence or genocide against the Jewish community or any religious or ethnic group are vile. They have no place at Harvard, and those who threaten our Jewish students will be held to account.
 
Pennsylvania's democratic governor said UPenn's Magill failed at the most basic level.
 
JOSH SHAPIRO, (D) PENNSYLVANIA GOVERNOR: It shouldn't be hard, and there should be no nuance to that. She needed to give a one-word answer, and she failed to meet that test.
 
MARQUEZ (voice-over): The White House making clear on calls for genocide, there is no room for nuance.
 
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Calls for genocide are unacceptable. It's vile, and it's counter to everything this country stands for. I can't believe I even have to say that. I can't believe I even have to say that.
 
MARQUEZ (voice-over): From the halls of Congress to presidential politics --
 
NIKKI HALEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It was disgusting to see what happened.
 
MARQUEZ (voice-over): Calls for all three university presidents to step aside, growing some business leaders, and the CEO of the Anti- Defamation League.
 
JONATHAN GREENBLATT, CEO, ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE: When I watch these presidents flail and feebly with legalese answers respond to a simple line of questioning, I've got to say, we've lost confidence in them.
 
MARQUEZ (voice-over): Some Jewish students and their supporters demanding action.
 
TALIA KHAN, MIT STUDENT: Jewish students do not believe that the MIT administration has done an adequate job to make students feel safe on campus.
 
JONATHAN FRIEDEN, HARVARD STUDENT: Do something. Protect Jewish people. Protect your students.
 
MARQUEZ (voice-over): Miguel Marquez, CNN, New York.

NOBILO: Las Vegas police say they're still trying to figure out the motive behind the mass shooting on a local university campus on Wednesday. Authorities said the alleged gunman had a list of people he was, quote, seeking on the University of Las Vegas campus. But the department says that none of the three faculty members who were killed were on that list. Police also explained what suspected shooter Anthony Polito was doing at a local post office prior to the shooting. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KEVIN MCMAHILL, SHERIFF, LAS VEGAS METROPOLITAN POLICE DEPARTMENT: Prior to the shooting, the suspect had earlier visited a Henderson post office and sent 22 letters to various university personnel across the country with no return address. The suspect had a list of people he was seeking on the university campus. As well as faculty from the Eastern Carolina University, we have contacted almost everyone on those lists to make sure that they are all right.

NOBILO: Sheriff McMahill says Polito was struck multiple times Thursday and collapsed at the scene where officers then arrested him. The 67-year-old was declared dead at the scene. 
 
Still to come for you on the program, former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson admits that his COVID pandemic rules were too complex. 
 <br>[04:40:00]
 
And many women in Indonesia say they're now on the losing end of the government's plans to become a global player in electric vehicles. That story and how they're fighting back is just ahead. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
NOBILO: Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is warning a physician that she should still face legal action if she proceeds with the court ordered abortion. A judge ruled Thursday that Kate Cox, who is now 20 weeks pregnant, can now legally terminate her pregnancy. She had sued the state, arguing that her fetus has a genetic disorder and could not survive long term outside the womb. And that continuing the pregnancy could threaten her life and future fertility. Paxton insists that Cox does not qualify for an exception to the state's strict abortion law, which bans the procedure at six weeks. He sent a threatening letter to three hospitals where Cox's doctor has privileges. 
 
A group of women and physicians have been fighting the state's medical exception law in a separate lawsuit. They say it's unclear language prevents doctors from performing abortions in serious cases. 
 
Former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has admitted that the rules set out by his government during the COVID-19 pandemic were too complex for both the police to enforce and for the public to understand. He was giving his second day of testimony on Thursday as part of a public inquiry into the UK's handling of the pandemic. Which is focused on whether or not the Prime Minister had full grasp of the medical information being presented to him, as well as the toxic culture and climate within Number 10 Downing Street. 
 
Now, as the world shifts towards green energy demand for electric vehicles is expected to surge along with the nickel pads that are used to make batteries for them. Indonesia is the world's largest producer of nickel, and it's positioning itself as a powerhouse in the EV industry. But the move comes at a cost for some Indonesian communities, particularly women.

This report from our Paula Hancocks is part of CNN's ongoing series on gender equality as equals. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The island of Sulawesi, home to rain forests and lakes, farms, and fishing communities. Rich in minerals, it's also home to a growing number of sprawling nickel mines. Nickel is found everywhere around us. Its growth fueled in part by the global race for cleaner energy sources and surging demand for electric vehicles. On Sulawesi, nearly a thousand miles from Jakarta, the global push to go green has come at a cost.
 
Masita used to be a pepper farmer here on the island's remote region of East Luwu. Her farm and those of her adult children were conceded in 2015 without notice to make way for the expansion of nickel mines, she says, and are now owned by P.T. Vale, one of Indonesia's largest nickel producers.
 
They have farmed the land for a decade. They never felt the need for official deeds until now. In Indonesia, it's not unusual for land owners to find their property has been taken by the government and sold to exploit its natural resources.
 
Many in her village lost their land, she says, and there was even compensation of a little more than $3,000 U.S. in return. As the breadwinners of the family, women farmers fear their lands will be conceded and dredged up to make way for more nickel mines and processing plants.
 
NURHASIYAH (through translated text): I can't afford to live if our plantation is taken by Vale.
 
HANCOCKS (voice-over): Nurhasiyah has been growing and selling pepper on this land all her life. She says representatives for PT Vale have started taking soil samples around the village, telling residents they purchased the land.
 
She, along with others in the village, have joined the group "Women Fighters of Loeha," an organization fighting for their right to the land.
 
Hasma, founder of the group, has brought women together to hear updates on their efforts. The group has staged protests against the mining company and sought support from the central government.
 
CNN reached out to P.T. Vale Indonesia and the Indonesian government regarding the claims made by residents but has yet to receive a response.
 
The company has in the past, denied accusations it has ceased land from indigenous people in East Luwu. Last year, it told Indonesian magazine "Tempo", P.T. Vale has never taken rights from other parties without their consent. It said it acquired the land as a result of an agreement with the Indonesian government. 
 
Hasma's group has sought help from WALHI, Indonesia's oldest environmental NGO, which has offices in Sulawesi.
 
MUHAMMAD AL AMIN, EXEC. DIRECTOR, WALHI SOUTH SULAWESI (through translated text): Women understand the importance of the environment and will be the main victims when the environment is damaged.
 
HANCOCKS (voice-over): CNN reached out to P.T. Vale, Indonesia, and the Indonesian government also regarding these claims, but has not received a response.
 
On its Web site, the global company says it recognizes this activities may cause significant environmental impacts and that it invests in ways to manage risks and minimize the socio-environmental impacts. President Joko Widodo -- or Jokowi -- has vowed to step up scrutiny of nickel mining, while at the same time racing ahead with its governments ambitious goal of producing 600,000 electric vehicles by 2030.
 
WALHI has pleaded for world leaders and foreign companies to be aware of the impacts of nickel mining.
 
AL AMIN (through translated text): Green Energy needs to be redefined. If "green energy" is obtained from activities that displace people's land, displace people's plantations, I don't think that's green energy. HANCOCKS (voice-over): Electric cars and batteries, part of global efforts to reach net zero emissions, could mean for them losing everything. In trying to save the future, these women's pasts are being destroyed.

As part of the three-year deal, Rahm will have an ownership stake in the new LIV Golf team -- that is according to ESPN, citing unnamed sources.

JON RAHM, GOLFER: I think the innovation and the vision of LIV Golf is would push me over to at least give it a chance and hear the pitch out and ultimately ended up being what I guess I wanted to hear, right. I believe on the growth of the game of golf. I've largely spoken about how Savvy improved the game of golf in Spain and I've always said how I would like to do the same thing over there. And if I can reach a bigger audience, it would be amazing. And I do believe this process will help me do that.

Well, in 2010 French cuisine was added to the UNESCO list of the World's Intangible Cultural Heritage, but it turns out that the land that gave the world croissants -- can't speak and forget -- as a sweet spot for an American classic. Krispy Kreme, known for its original glazed doughnuts, opened its first location in Paris on Wednesday. According to CNN affiliate BFM. The location plans to roll out more than 40,000 doughnuts a day. Krispy Kreme CEO said that the company wants to open 500 locations across France in the next five years. 
 
And it's not just Krispy Kreme that's expanding. McDonald's is, too. The burger chain is trying out a new concept called "CosMc's," which it hopes can compete with cafes like Starbucks. The spin-off features specialty coffee drinks, slushies and snacks, and so far, customers are loving it.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think it might be better than Starbucks and Duncan, or we're definitely going to be up there.

NOBILO: High praise indeed from that young gentleman. 
 
The name "CosMc's" comes from a McDonald's ad campaign in the 80s that featured an alien. The first shop is now outside Chicago is open.
