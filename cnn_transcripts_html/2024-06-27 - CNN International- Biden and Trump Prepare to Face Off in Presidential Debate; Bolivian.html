MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR: Hello and a warm welcome to our viewers joining us from around the world. I'm Max Foster. It is Thursday, June the 27th 9 a.m. here in London, 4 a.m. In Atlanta, where Joe Biden and Donald Trump will square off in the first 2024 presidential debate. The candidates will take the stage at CNN's World Headquarters this evening.
 
Unlike previous debates, there will be no live audience and the candidates microphones will be turned off when their speaking time expires. The economy immigration abortion and protecting democracy are amongst the key issues for voters. And we can expect plenty of focus on the candidates mental sharpness as well.
 
The latest CNN Poll of Polls shows no clear leader in the presidential race and both candidates have struggled with negative approval ratings. Mr. Biden's campaign says his debate focus will be on his economic record protecting democracy and abortion rights. CNN's MJ Lee has a look at one specific line of attack expected from Trump.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MJ LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: There is one separate category of incoming from Donald Trump that President Biden, we are told, is preparing for. And that is potential personal insults and attacks aimed not just at the president, but members of his family as well. A Biden adviser tells me that in debate prep sessions at Camp David, the president and his team have been preparing for the president to respond to those kinds of potential attacks thrown his way by the former president.
 
And while this adviser wouldn't elaborate, of course, still fresh for President Biden is the news from earlier this month that his son Hunter was convicted on three felony gun charges. This was a legal saga that was extremely painful for the entire Biden family. And, of course, what's incredible is that the president has already experienced his son Hunter being attacked by the former president on the debate stage. And that was back in 2020 when President Trump said that Hunter Biden had been dishonorably discharged from the military for cocaine use. To be clear, he had been administratively discharged, which is different. He also mocked Hunter Biden for not getting a job, he said, until his father had become vice president.
 
And the moment where President Biden defended Hunter Biden in in response ended up being a moment that aid said afterwards really resonated with American voters. There's a moment where the president at the time was able to really connect with different American families who have had experience with family members dealing with addiction issues. 
 
So all of this just goes to show the level to which the Biden team has really been trying to prepare the president for anything and everything that the former president might throw his way on Thursday night.

KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, former President Trump said the day before the debate at his Mar-a-Lago home with some of his closest senior advisers. His other aides and advisers were here in Atlanta getting ready to greet the former president. Now, one of the things I heard from a number of these advisers and allies close to Donald Trump was a change in posture when it came to the format of the debate for weeks.
 
They have been criticizing the format, particularly the fact that the mics would be muted and that there would be no live audience. Part of the complaint was that Donald Trump, they say, feeds off of the audience, that he gets his energy from the audience, that any kind of environment without that would harm him. 
 
However, what we've started to hear from these same allies is that they're actually hoping that this helps the former president stay on message. They have honed into him that the most important thing that he needs to do on Thursday is focus on three topics. One, the economy and inflation in particular. Two, immigration and three, crime.
 
The reason they are focusing on these three issues is because looking at recent polling, it shows that Donald Trump pulls ahead of President Joe Biden in these areas with voters. And they want him to continue to hammer that down. They are hoping that without a live audience, he won't go on those riffs and rants you see traditionally at his big rallies.
 
The other part of this is those muted mics. They had said that part of his strategy at one point was the fact that he was very aggressive going after Biden. Now, they are hoping that because the mics are muted, it seems like he is less aggressive, more on message.
 
One of the things Donald Trump himself seems to have done in the last several days is reflect on his own past performances. 
 <br>[04:05:02]
 
He did a very candid interview with Washington Examiner in which he said he was too aggressive in the debate in 2020 with Joe Biden. 
 
Now, of course, it is still unclear what version of Donald Trump is going to show up on Thursday. Perhaps the former president himself doesn't know. But one thing that is clear is that his senior advisors, allies, everyone in his orbit is stressing to him the gravity of this moment and how he needs to remain focused and on message.

FOSTER: The CNN U.S. presidential debate is tonight. You can watch it live at 9 p.m. Eastern in the U.S., 9 a.m. Friday in Hong Kong. That's 2 a.m. here in London. 
 
Now, an attempt to overthrow Bolivia's democratically elected government has been stopped. And the former army chief behind the failed coup d'etat was arrested in La Paz after a dramatic confrontation with a Bolivian president inside a government palace. President Luis Arce reportedly told Juan Jose Zuniga, I am your captain and I will not allow this insubordination.
 
Zuniga was later shown handcuffed on national TV before being forced into a police vehicle. This all comes a day after he was relieved of his duties. Earlier, armored vehicles were seen ramming the doors of the palace as armed troops surrounded government buildings.
 
Well, the soldiers withdrew after the newly appointed army chief ordered them back to their units. President Arce had called on the public to mobilize in defense of democracy. 
 
The attorney general's office is now vowing to impose the maximum punishment on the perpetrators of the attempted coup.
 
CNN's Stefano Pozzebon has a closer look now at how it all unfolded.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
STEFANO POZZEBON, CNN CONTRIBUTOR (voice-over): In the end, the attempted coup was defused in a matter of hours. But only after army units took control of the city center of La Paz and military vehicles quite literally rammed the doors of the presidential palace. But inside, they met a firm response from the sitting president.
 
Luis Arce telling rebel general Juan Jose Zuniga to stand down. 
 
It fills us with bravery and courage to keep on resisting any coup attempt because Bolivia deserves its democracy, which has been won in the streets and with blood, brothers and sisters. 
 
Zuniga, who had been the head of the Bolivian army since 2022, was detained shortly after and is now under criminal investigation.
 
It appears Zuniga decided to move against the state after his dismissal on Tuesday. He was fired for threatening former president Evo Morales from running for re-election. 
 
We are the armed wing of the people, the armed wing of the fatherland.
 
A warning sign of how Latin American militaries may have become more comfortable taking bolder actions.
 
GUSTAVO FLORES-MACIAS, PROFESSOR OF GOVERNMENT AND PUBLIC POLICY, CORNELL UNIVERSITY: The armed forces have gained more and more involvement. They have more of a say in public affairs. And frankly, this has emboldened the military in thinking that maybe, you know, civilians absolutely need them.
 
And it generates this sense among the population that civilians may be unable to solve policy problems, that they really need the militaries to step in.
 
POZZEBON: In the meantime, Arce had immediately appointed a new army chief. And by sunset, there were no more soldiers in the city center of La Paz. Only regular citizens on the street defending democracy.
 
Stefano Pozzebon, CNN, Bogota.

FOSTER: Protesters in Kenya are set to take to the streets once again for a One Million People March. It comes after more than a week of deadly protests over a controversial finance bill that made its way through parliament. Protesters torched government buildings and cars around Nairobi in response.
 
In a surprising turn of events on Wednesday, Kenyan President William Ruto withdrew the bill after vowing to protect the country from violence. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
WILLIAM RUTO, KENYAN PRESIDENT: I concede. And therefore, I will not sign the 2024 finance bill. And it shall subsequently be withdrawn. And I have agreed with these members that that becomes our collective position.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: Mr. Ruto says six people were killed in the protests. A Kenyan civil society organization reports a much higher number, saying at least 23 people lost their lives in the clashes. 
 
CNN's Victoria Rubadiri joins us from Nairobi. It seems a bit quieter today, at least.
 <br>[04:10:00] VICTORIA RUBADIRI, CNN REPORTER: It does, Max. We are just a few hundred meters away from where State House is. That is the point where protesters said they would come, at least to have their voices heard.
 
In the last hour or so, we've had to change our position because of the amount of roadblocks that have been put up by police. The presence is certainly increasing also in the central business district. Most roads within the capital are quiet, though. As we keep an eye on how things develop across the day.
 
FOSTER: OK, we've got some connection issues there, but OK, we've got it back. Victoria, just take us through the march today, what that's for and how it's going to play out, you know, with this background.
 
RUBADIRI: Right. Primarily, it's against the killings that we witnessed in the protests that happened before. Kenyans also protesting against issues of graft within government.
 
Yesterday, we heard the president talking about his fight to ramp up, you know, his initiatives against corruption within his government to also bring up austerity measures. But Kenyans aren't necessarily convinced. You also see quite a few of them asking for a recall of members of Parliament and going through that constitutional process. So many of them thinking about taking that route. 
 
But they are not a happy lot. And they've made that extremely clear over the last couple of days and hope to do so today as well.
 
FOSTER: And in terms of how the president has handled this, I mean, it was a it was a big climb down would have been very embarrassing for him. How's -- how do you think he's handled this? And how does he, you know, strengthen his position going forward?
 
Considering, you know, a lot of it was very personal this, wasn't it?
 
RUBADIRI: No, certainly it was very unexpected to get that withdrawal and step back from the president. Of course, they have to go back to the drawing board. Re-strategize to see how they will take conversations for it.
 
He said he's open to a national dialogue when it comes to this proposed bill, as well as many issues affecting the youth. But has not given a commitment in terms of when, how that will happen. But certainly it is a bruise to the president's image. And of course, that stern, resolute image he had has certainly been dented.
 
FOSTER: Yes, OK, Victoria in Nairobi. Thank you for that. 
 
Julian Assange's wife is asking for privacy now that her husband is home in Australia and a free man. The WikiLeaks founder agreed to a plea deal with U.S. prosecutors on a single espionage related charge. Journalist Alex Thomas has the details on that.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ALEX THOMAS, JOURNALIST: Julian Assange's opponents said he should not and would not be given a hero's welcome on his return to Australia. But there was a celebratory atmosphere when hundreds of his supporters turned up to this hotel near Canberra Airport to catch a glimpse of the WikiLeaks founder. In the end, Assange didn't speak to the media, but his lawyers and his wife did.
 
STELLA ASSANGE, JULIAN ASSANGE'S WIFE: He needs to recuperate. And this is a process. I ask you, please, to give us space, to give us privacy. To find our place, to let our family be a family before he can speak again at a time of his choosing.
 
THOMAS: It has been a whirlwind 48 hours for Assange since news broke that he had agreed a plea bargain with the U.S. Department of Justice, released from the high security Belmarsh prison in London to fly to a court hearing in Saipan, where a judge agreed to the deal of time already served and released him. 
 
Then another flight, more than six and a half hours to Australia's capital, landing after the country's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese had welcomed his release and into the arms of his wife, the first time he had ever spent time with her as a free man. 
 
Alex Thomas, Canberra, Australia.

FOSTER: For the second time in two years, a major abortion opinion from the U.S. Supreme Court has mistakenly been released before the official decision. A document related to a case about Idaho's strict abortion ban was briefly posted on the court's website on Wednesday. The unsigned opinion, reviewed by Bloomberg News, showed three conservative justices, John Roberts, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, sided with the court's three liberals to block Idaho from enforcing a ban which only allows abortions if a pregnant woman's life was at stake, but not her health.
 
It would be a win for the Biden administration if it stands. 
 <br>[04:15:00]
 
Two years ago, a draft of the high court's opinion overturning Roe versus Wade was also released prematurely, and it was essentially the same as the final opinion that was issued weeks later. 
 
NASA and SpaceX are planning for a day when the International Space Station actually retires. NASA has contracted SpaceX to build a vehicle to drag the massive lab out of Earth's orbit and guide it to a fiery plunge through the atmosphere. NASA says the contract is worth up to $843 million.
 
The International Space Station is roughly the size of an American football field and will be travelling more than 17,000 miles per hour. Its operational life is set to end in 2030. 
 
British voters are just days away from deciding whether Rishi Sunak and his Conservative Party will continue to lead the country. Details on that coming up. Plus, new allegations of manufacturing flaws at Boeing. And according
 
 to one whistleblower, they could lead to catastrophes on some passenger jets.
 
And later this hour, the original artwork that introduced the world to Harry Potter just conjured up a record price at auction.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: Tensions again flaring on Israel's northern border. Lebanon's state media reports that Israel launched two air-to-surface missiles on the southern city Nabatiyeh. At least 19 people were reported injured after a building was destroyed.
 
Israel Defense Forces didn't immediately respond to CNN's request for comment, but earlier Israel said firefighters responded to fires in two buildings in the northern part of the country that it says were the result of rocket fire from Lebanon. 
 
Meanwhile, to the south, in Gaza, the war continues. And a warning, the images you're about to see are disturbing.
 
Hospital officials say an Israeli airstrike in the northern part of the enclave killed at least eight Palestinians, including three children. This comes as the Israeli prime minister's office says the government is looking for Gaza civilians as well as countries in the region to run the territory after the war ends. But it did make clear that day would come only once Hamas is defeated.
 
Nada joins us. I mean, they're looking for leaders of this enclave, however it's governed in future.
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, that's right, although no details have been given as to who specifically they're looking into for the potential leadership of the territory after the war comes to an end. They have said that they are speaking to Palestinians in Gaza, or rather looking to Palestinians in Gaza as well as countries in the region. This is a slight shift from what we've heard in the past from the Israeli government, which has previously suggested that there would be a longstanding security presence by the Israeli military in Gaza.
 
That has been outrightly rejected on numerous occasions by both officials in Gaza from Hamas and also from the Palestinian Authority, both of whom want to see Palestinian autonomy in the Gaza Strip. 
 <br>[04:20:02]
 
But this is a slight shift. Of course, the focus there for the Israeli government is when this war comes to an end, so when, in their eyes, Hamas has been defeated. And again, on that front, we're also seeing a shift in the language being used by the Israeli government.
 
Previously, we've been hearing from the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying that Hamas needs to be defeated in its entirety. Now, according to a spokesperson from the Prime Minister's office, they have said that they don't mean that every single Hamas militant needs to be killed, that the focus now is on defeating Hamas in terms of its governance and military capabilities. 
 
And of course, we've heard from the U.S. saying that in its current assessment, it does not believe that Hamas has the military capabilities to carry out another attack, such as the attack we saw on October 7th. So, in the eyes of some, this is a goal that has essentially already been achieved in the destruction that we've seen over the last eight months. 
 
But of course, again, no clear details, no elaboration on what this sort of post-governance, post-war governance would look like in the Gaza Strip. We know that this is something that members of the international community are very much focused on.
 
And in fact, just in the last few days, Yoav Galant, the Israeli defense minister, met with the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Washington, D.C. And actually, part of those discussions were focused on what would happen in Gaza, what governance would look like in Gaza after the war. So, certainly, a real sense of pressure there on the Israeli government to come up with some sort of plan.
 
FOSTER: And take us through the Doctors Without Borders staff member who was killed in the debate about his background.
 
BASHIR: Well, Fadi Al-Wadiya was a physiotherapist, according to Doctors Without Borders. He had worked with the organization between 2018 and 2022 and returned to the organization when the war broke out to continue to provide care. 
 
Now, the Israeli military killed Al-Wadiya says that they were targeting what they've described as a terrorist. They believe he was a member of the Islamic Jihad movement, that he was a key figure in this movement. 
 
And this has been refuted by Doctors Without Borders, an international medical NGO. They have said in a statement that there was no proof of any wrongdoing on his part. They were given no indication of this by the Israeli military and that they have no indication that the Israeli military's claims are true. 
 
Now, this would be the sixth member of Doctors Without Borders to have been killed over the course of the war. We have seen humanitarian workers and medical workers, both from Palestinian and international organizations, killed over the course of this war. Now, Doctors Without Borders are calling for an independent investigation into this particular incident.
 
FOSTER: OK, Nada, thank you. 
 
Iranians heading to the polls on Friday to elect a new president who will succeed the country's late leader, Ebrahim Raisi, who was killed in a helicopter crash last month. Only six out of 80 candidates were approved to run for the post by the country's guardian council.
 
Five of them, hardliners, and all female candidates were excluded. CNN's Fred Pleitgen went to one of the frontrunner's rallies.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over):  A children's group warms up the crowd. But things really heat up when Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf enters the room, one of the leading conservatives in the presidential race. 
 
The first thing people expect is economic development, he says. There is no doubt that this development can happen through the path of elections. 
 
Qalibaf's supporters say they also want a hard line towards the U.S. and Israel. Under any condition, we will be supporting the oppressed and fighting our enemies, this man says. We are very determined. 
 
And he says Qalibaf is the one who supports the supreme leader and follows him. Whatever the supreme leader says, he puts into practice.
 
PLEITGEN: Five of the remaining candidates are considered conservative, but Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf is certainly considered to be one of the frontrunners, and he has vowed that if he becomes president, he will continue the hardline policies of Ebrahim Raisi, who was killed in that chopper crash a little over a month ago.
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over): After Iran's embassy compound in Syria was bombed in April, killing several Revolutionary Guard commanders, and Iran retaliated for the first time, launching drones and missiles from its own territory, Iran is now warning it will hit Israel again if its assets in the Middle East are targeted. 
 
Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, criticizing presidential candidates he thinks could seek ties with the U.S. Not naming names, but some believe he referred to Masoud Pezeshkian, the moderate left in the race. Pezeshkian has called for improving ties with nations in the region. A Pezeshkian campaign event in Tehran on Wednesday was canceled abruptly.
 
PLEITGEN: The Pezeshkian campaign says after a long process, they didn't receive the necessary permission to hold their rally inside a stadium. So now, as you can see, they're rallying outside on the street, screaming their vote for Pezeshkian.
 <br>[04:25:00]
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over): Disappointed supporters saying they still believe Pezeshkian has a chance to win. 
 
The wave of support has added to people's hope in elections, this man says, so we hope that those who are hesitant will come out and vote. 
 
And she says, in general, the change we need in politics is foreign policy, so it will result in improvements in people's economic situation.
 
As the campaigns come to an end, Iranians will go to the polls on Friday to elect a new president.
 
Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Tehran.

FOSTER: British voters go to the polls a week from today to decide if Rishi Sunak holds on to power, or if Labour Party leader Keir Starmer will be the next Prime Minister. 
 
Plus, we'll take you inside the CNN studio for a behind-the-scenes look at where Joe Biden and Donald Trump will face off later today.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: Welcome back to CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Max Foster. Here are some of today's top stories.
 
Joe Biden and Donald Trump meet face-to-face in just a few hours from now at CNN headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. The presidential candidates will debate for 90 minutes, standing at lecterns just eight feet apart with no live audience. 
 
A coup attempt was thwarted in Bolivia yesterday. Armed soldiers stormed the presidential palace to confront the democratically elected president. The attempted overthrow was orchestrated by the country's former army chief, who's now been taken into custody. 
 
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has called Kenya's president to thank him for taking steps to reduce the tensions in his country. This comes as protesters say they will go ahead with the One Million People March in Nairobi today. 
 
Now, a week from today, voters head to the polls in Britain's general election, and it looks like Labour leader Keir Starmer could become the next prime minister, as the Tories, led by current prime minister Rishi Sunak, continue to sink in the polls. Sunak and Starmer went head-to-head on Wednesday in their last debate before the July 4th election.
 
Starmer says his Labour Party is best suited to lead the country out of a cost-of-living crisis and soaring inflation. Sunak accused his rival of not being straightforward about his plans for taxation, women's rights and illegal migrants. Take a listen.
