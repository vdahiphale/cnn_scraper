JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: Police released new body camera video of the deadly shooting in a New Mexico neighborhood, a detailed look at how officers took down the teenage gunman who shot nine people in this shooting spree.
 
SARA SIDNER, CNN ANCHOR: Mystery in the Amazon what happened to four young children who might have survived a plane crash. New footprints found in the jungle are providing some hope this morning.
 
BERMAN: And there are major new developments that could impact the war in Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He's in Saudi Arabia right now. He then heads to the G7 Summit in Japan where he will be greeted by an announcement that he has been pleading for. President Biden just told the allies of the U.S. will support efforts to train Ukrainian pilots on F-16 fighter jets. Zelenskyy desperately wants those planes inside his country. We have team coverage beginning with CNN's Natasha Bertrand at the Pentagon. Natasha, tell us about this announcement the U.S. will support training on the F-16. What exactly does all this mean?
 
NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTER: Yes, John, this is a really significant announcement here from the administration. And it really marks a U-turn for President Biden, who just a few short months ago, had said that he did not believe that Ukraine needed F-16s at this time. Well, now he has told G7 leaders there in Japan, that the U.S. is prepared to join a coalition of countries to train Ukrainians on fourth generation fighter aircraft, which includes F-16s teams that will begin in the coming weeks this training will and is expected to take several months.
 
But this had really been up in the air about whether the U.S. would actually support this, a lot of European countries do have a supply of F-16s. And they have expressed a willingness and a desire to send them to Ukraine. Of course, Ukraine has been pleading for the Jets for several months. But it was not clear whether the U.S. would approve the transfer of those jets, which it has to do because of sensitive U.S. technology in them. We'll now not only are we told that the U.S. is prepared to allow the allies to export those jets, they are also prepared to join this coalition of trainers who will be instructing Ukrainian pilots on these jets in Europe in the coming months. This training importantly is not expected to actually happen in the United States. But it will happen in Europe. And it will happen in conjunction with some of these European allies who have been pushing for this kind of training and provision of jets to Ukraine, including the Netherlands and the U.K., John.
 
BERMAN: All right. The U.S. not providing the jets exactly but approving the transfer and most importantly buy-in on the training. That is a major development, Natasha Bertrand at the Pentagon. Thank you very much.
 
Let's go now to CNN's Marc Stewart who was with the president at the G7 Summit. Mark, I have to say this announcement about training on the F-16s, I think it clips in importance, the other things that have been going on there, but when Zelenskyy arrives he'll be greeted with this information and some other information he'll like.
 
MARC STEWART, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, the information that he will certainly like and had been hoping for was an agreement by the G7 leaders to really beef up sanctions against Russia it efforts to crush and destroy the funding component, at least of the Russian war machine.
 
So today a big announcement on sanctions and really we can divide it up into two different categories. First, things expect to see sanctions on manufacturing, things such as transportation, any kind of material effort, material item that has been crucial that has allowed Russia to thrive.
 <br>[11:05:03]
 
In addition the U.K. just today announced that it will prohibit Russian imports of diamonds. So that is going to be a big attack mode right there. And then expect to see sanctions on individuals, either people who hold leadership positions in Russia or perhaps who have wealth, who have been able to contribute to the funding of the Russia -- the Russian efforts in Ukraine.
 
One final note, John, when President Zelenskyy comes here, not only will he meet with members of the G7, but also other invited nations, India, Indonesia, Brazil, those are nations that also could impact the Russian war effort, particularly on an economic front. So expect to see some of that to come up in conversation as well.
 
BERMAN: So F-16 training, sanctions and big meetings with other important world leaders. This is indeed a big weekend for President Zelenskyy. Marc, terrific to see you in Japan. Appreciate it.
 
So as the president and these G7 leaders work on the sanctions on Russia, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, he is traveling thousands of miles for this personal pitch for support, his first drop in Saudi Arabia this morning, a remarkable journey from Kyiv. We had a map that shows just how far he's going. He meets with the Crown Prince in Saudi Arabia before going to the G7. CNN's Nic Robertson is following all this for us. And Nic, as we said, this is turning into a very fruitful journey for Zelenskyy.
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: It is. The meeting with the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, big. It was Salman's invitation. Salman himself wants to have a bigger role in regional politics and in particular diplomacy and helping bring peace to Ukraine. He said his foreign minister to Ukraine a few months ago, several 100 billions in humanitarian aid committed also.
 
There is heavy investment between -- from Saudi Arabia in Ukraine, there certainly was before the war. And Saudi sees itself as part of a solution maker, has been involved in getting prisoners released, particularly foreign prisoners. So this is something that's big for MBS. And for Zelenskyy, it really allows him to get under the skin in the Arab world in the Gulf states with Putin's narrative, which is quite often accepted there at face value, that Ukraine isn't really a country. It's really part of Russia, that Russia is actually being attacked by NATO that this is Western hegemony.
 
Putin's message sells pretty well on the Arab Street and places people believe it was Zelenskyy's ability now to speak to the Arab leaders and in particular, Mohammed bin Salman has huge value and disrupting Putin himself, more friends potentially, more help and support going forward. But I think what we're hearing from President Biden from G7 allies and partners that support Ukraine, particularly about the F-16.
 
This narrative has been going on for a little while it's been gaining momentum. The British a few months ago said they would train F-16 pilots. Couple of days ago, the Dutch and British Prime Minister said they would launch an initiative to help Ukraine source these F-16s and get pilots trained. But I think this reflects, perhaps President Biden shift reflects a real ground reality here, John. And the ground reality is something we've been seeing.
 
Every frontline commander we speak to hear talks about a lack of ammunition. And when you come into this, you think, hey, maybe this is just part of shaping the information message, we need more help. But after a period of time here, you begin to think maybe this is genuine. And I think there's a recognition that when the tanks were authorized for Ukraine, by the time they get to the tanks, this much talked about a big offensive here hasn't started that when the West says we'll give you tanks and when Ukraine can put them into action takes a lot of time.
 
And Russia gains advantage in that time. So the recognition that F-16s are actually need, Ukraine has said it needs them. But the reality is they do need them to win this fight now this summer against the Russian military. I think that message is beginning to sink in. Ukraine needs to win this summer and it needs all this equipment now. That is something that is my take away at this period of time. We've had closer frontlines here in Ukraine.
 
BERMAN: Yes, promises one thing, action, a completely different matter. Nic Robertson, great to have you there. You and your team please stay safe. Sara?
 
SIDNER: Police in Farmington, New Mexico release chilling body and doorbell camera video of the fatal shooting spree where nine people were shot and three killed in what seems to be a random attack. In one video you can see cars speeding away and hear the shots as the shooter releases a hail of gunfire. He can even be heard yelling, come kill me. We want to warn you, the video you're about to see is disturbing.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[11:10:05]
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Come kill me.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SIDNER: So you heard him there say come kill me. The neighborhood, he was walking around there with an AR-15 style weapon and wearing a bulletproof vest and shooting indiscriminately at cars going by. He fired at least 140 rounds killing three elderly women before police confronted and killed him. CNN's Josh Campbell is following this story for us. Josh, this is incredibly hard to watch video knowing what the outcome was. Give us a rundown of how this all went down.
 
JOSH CAMPBELL, CNN SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: No. That's right Sara. And you know the police chief here in Farmington describe this as a quote, assault on our community after this 18-year-old just opened fire indiscriminately in this neighborhood. Authorities in releasing this video walked us through the timeline. They said that 79-year-old Shirley Voita was driving through this neighborhood. The suspect shoots her she falls out of her vehicle. Two other elderly women are driving by, police say they tried to render aid. They are also fatally shot.
 
The suspect continues to getting out an AR-15 other weapons just shooting around this neighborhood. Authorities eventually formed what's called a contact team. They go to engage the shooter and take him down. I want to watch you -- let you watch part of that video. I'll warn you this is graphic. This is one of those officers bravely rushing toward the shooter. She herself has shot. Watch.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I am shot.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you OK? Are you hit? Were you hit?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: In my legs I think.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Where is tourniquet? Where is tourniquet?
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CAMPBELL: Now it's already said that over 140 rounds were shot during this rampage, the police chief have you listened to part of what he said yesterday, he essentially described this massacre as a warzone. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHIEF STEVE HEBBE, FARMINGTON POLICE: You know, there's a lot of shots being fired. But when you're actually hearing it, and it sounds, especially in that first one where he's still firing that AR-15, it sounds like you're watching Afghanistan or Iraq. You're watching sort of a combat. I was -- so I was not prepared really to see that and to hear the volume of shots.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CAMPBELL: Now Sara, authorities say they're still working to determine that motivation why this 18-year-old opened fire. But we do know and looking at this dramatic video, two officers in total were shot as a bravely tried to take down the shooter. And you know, Sara, we've been talking about, for example, coming up on the one year anniversary of the Uvalde massacre which was a colossal failure by law enforcement in Uvalde.
 
That certainly appears to be the aberration because you look at all these other incidents around the country. San Jose, California, Louisville, Nashville, Duncanville, Texas, Allen, Texas, Atlanta, I mean, all just to name a few. And now in New Mexico, we see time and again officers putting their own lives on the line trying to take down a shooter here. They did exactly that in New Mexico, two officers being wounded in the process. Sara?
 
SIDNER: Josh, my friend, the fact that you can rattle off all those places where we've seen these mass shootings, just like that just shows you how big the problem is in this country. Josh Campbell, thank you so much for doing that for us. John?
 <br>[11:13:26]
 
BERMAN: So New York, offering a new welcome center for migrants where they are checking in after arriving in Manhattan this morning. The armorer charged in the "Rust" movie shooting wants her charges against her dropped. But will she get the same treatment as Alec Baldwin? And police at the Vatican arrested a man after they say he rammed a vehicle through the gate.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BERMAN: The accused Pentagon leaker will appear in court later today in connection with classified intelligence that was shared online for months. Newly released memo show that Air Force leadership repeatedly warned Airman First Class Jack Teixeira about inappropriately accessed files. The 21-year-old even received a direct order to stop taking intelligence notes, stop taking notes about intelligence.
 
Teixeira has been charged under the Espionage Act with unauthorized retention and transmission of National Defense information and unauthorized removal of classified information and defense materials. He has not yet entered a formal plea.
 
Police at the Vatican have arrested a man who rammed a car through the gates there. Surveillance video shows the vehicle maneuvering around barriers inside the city. Officials say security guards shot at the car before the man got out and was arrested. That's according to Vatican news. A doctor says the driver was about 40 years old and was experiencing a mental health crisis.
 
A Hollywood icon is celebrated at the Cannes Film Festival. Legendary actor Harrison Ford was presented with an honorary Palme d'Or which is akin to a Lifetime Achievement Award. The actor, I can't believe I have to tell you this, but his list of films includes the "Indiana Jones" series and "Star Wars." He was visibly moved by the award.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRISON FORD, ACTOR: I'm very touched. I'm very moved by this. And I'm they say when you're about to die you see your life flash before your eyes and I just saw my life flash before my eyes.

 <br>[11:20:07]
 
BERMAN: He still got it. Sara?
 
SIDNER: Oh, he does.
 
All right, this morning asylum seekers who are arriving in New York are checking into a welcome center at a hotel in the coming days. By the way, the city is expecting to see 15 buses of migrants coming from the border. CNN's Polo Sandoval is joining us now from that new welcome center in New York. Polo, the mayor has already said that the city is overwhelmed. So what happens now?
 
POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: He's been saying that since last year, Sara. So any additional arrival, certainly adding more stress to a system that is already overwhelmed. And they continue to arrive at an increasing rate currently about 600 asylum seekers arriving in New York City per day, according to a source within the Eric Adams administration. That certainly much higher than what we're seeing just a couple of weeks ago, and the number was about 2 to 300.
 
Now the question and what's yet to be seen is whether or not that will continue in the coming days or weeks, given the sharp decrease in asylum seeker apprehensions down on the southern border. But here's the now and this is really the crux of the issue. New York City is receiving migrants at a faster rate than they're able to place them at the series of shelters that are set up throughout the city.
 
Hence, the facility that you see behind me, which is the hotel that is now currently the asylum seeker arrival center, it's going to serve two main purposes here. One of them is to be one of the preliminary stops, the primary stops, I should say, for those folks who arrive either by bus or by plane, this is where they can receive the orientation and be in touch with some of those non-profits that are working hand in hand for the last year with New York City.
 
And for a select few is particularly those with children, they can potentially shelter here in some of the well over 100 private rooms. The goal is to increase that number long term. But the other sense of urgency that I'm getting from sources within the city is they are calling on other elected officials throughout the boroughs, all of the New York City boroughs to offer up space to be able to accommodate future arrivals.
 
And this may potentially result in housing asylum seekers by the end of June in houses of worship. A city source saying that they are still on track to begin with that initiative where they could potentially house them in churches and in synagogues that choose to offer their facilities. So it just speaks to the ever evolving situation in New York City that regardless of what we see, well over 2,000 miles away from here on the U.S. southern border, whether those numbers are higher up. The reality is here. We've already seen well over 65,000 asylum seekers on the books, obviously many more that continue to find a place -- trying to find a place to stay and the city trying to keep up with the demand. Sara?
 
SIDNER: We are certainly see this across the United States and several cities have been impacted. Polo Sandoval, thank you so much for that report. John?
 <br>[11:22:52]
 
BERMAN: New concerns about the health of California Senator Dianne Feinstein after her office confirmed some serious complications following a shingle diagnosis this year. And the person in charge of the weapons during the fatal shooting on the "Rust" film set has filed a motion to get her case dismissed. What will it take to get those charges dropped?
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
SIDNER: Just in to CNN, another Republican has entered the race for president, South Carolina Republican Senator Tim Scott filed the paperwork to run according to the Federal Election Commission. He is the only black Republican in the Senate and had teased that announcement for next week. Scott launched his exploratory committee earlier this month. John?
 
BERMAN: Officially in.
 
This morning, California Senator Dianne Feinstein's office has confirmed that she suffered complications from a shingles diagnosis earlier this year, and that it did lead to encephalitis. Here now is CNN chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta. So, Sanjay, what exactly is encephalitis and what can come from that?
 
DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, so you know, a lot of people have heard the term meningitis, that's the inflammation of the meninges, or the outer layers of the brain. Encephalitis basically means that there's potential inflammation of the entire brain or at least several parts of the brain. And that typically comes about for a couple of different reasons either the body is sort of creating an inflammatory reaction itself, or it's in response to another pathogen, a virus. She had shingles, as you mentioned, likely this is sort of the -- one of the consequences of that. It can be challenging initially to figure out what's going on because people may have fever, headache, stiffness of the neck, things like that. It can be confused with other things. If they develop confusion, things that are seen more related specifically to the brain that sort of really gets doctors, you know, curious as to what is going on, and probably leads to a bunch of tests being done.
 
Even then the diagnosis can be a bit challenging, but like an MRI scan, and EEG to see if the electrical activity has been affected in the brain, and even a lumbar puncture, John, to see if there's any evidence of the virus or remnants of the virus that may have caused the encephalitis. It can be challenging, severe when people recover, it's usually the headache and the fever that goes away. But things like memory loss, those can be lingering symptoms for a long time.
 <br>[11:30:05]
 
BERMAN: I was just going to ask so sometimes the symptoms can linger for a long time even after recovery.</pre>
