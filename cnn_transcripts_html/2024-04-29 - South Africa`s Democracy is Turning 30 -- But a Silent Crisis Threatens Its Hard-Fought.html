COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: Hello, and welcome back. Hope you had a fantastic weekend. I`m Coy Wire. This is CNN 10, the best 10 minutes of news, and I 
 
 don`t say that in a solipsistic way. I say this is the best 10 minutes of news because of all of you. Thank you for making what we do simply the 
 
 best.
 
Let`s kick off today`s show with some news on South Africa. 30 years ago, an historic event took place in South Africa, the country`s first 
 
 democratic elections. This was a significant moment because it marked the end of apartheid, a system of racial segregation that ruled the country for 
 
 nearly 50 years.
 
Under apartheid, South Africa was dominated by the minority white population, leaving its majority black population struggling for basic 
 
 human rights.

CYRIL RAMAPHOSA, PRESIDENT OF SOUTH AFRICA: Apartheid was an ideology and a system aimed at controlling every aspect of people`s lives. It sought to 
 
 humiliate and to degrade black people.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WIRE: Now fast forward to today, and South Africa has seen remarkable progress. There`s a growing black middle class and its education system is 
 
 more accessible. But despite those advances, issues like inequality, crime and corruption still remain.
 
There`s a gap that continues to grow between the rich and the poor. Many people still struggle with basic needs like electricity and water, and some 
 
 black families are still fighting the long-term consequences of apartheid. 
 
As we reflect on South Africa`s democratic journey, CNN`s David McKenzie takes us to the Rainbow Nation as some experts warn that a silent crisis is 
 
 underway.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: When thousands of students were bravely marching down these streets, they were fighting for a 
 
 better future for South Africa. But decades later, here`s a staggering statistic. More than 80% of Grade 4s cannot read.
 
Has it gotten worse over the 18 years of you being at the school?
 
PRINCE MULWELA, TEACHER, MORRIS ISAACSON HIGH SCHOOL: Yes, it`s becoming worse and worse. 
 
MCKENZIE (voice-over): At Morris Isaacson High School, famous for its role in 76, teachers like Prince Mulwela say that jobs and education are given 
 
 to the politically connected, and corruption is rife. Primary students now come to his classes unprepared, he says. Corruption watchdogs call it a 
 
 silent crisis.
 
MULWELA: We are living in a world in South Africa where it`s all about politics. Everything is being politicized. So the education system is also 
 
 being politicized. So that is the reason why probably we are experiencing such problems.
 
ATLEGANG ALCOCK, STUDENT, MORRIS ISAACSON HIGH SCHOOL: I feel honored being in the school because then I get to learn about history.
 
MBALI MSIMA, STUDENT, MORRIS ISAACSON HIGH SCHOOL: Some put their lives in danger for a better future, for better education.
 
MCKENZIE (voice-over): I spoke to two leading students at Morris Isaacson. They are proud of their school, but acutely aware of the challenges that 
 
 lie ahead. 
 
(On camera): Is there enough opportunity for young people like yourselves in this country?
 
ALCOCK: Right now? 
 
MCKENZIE: Mm-hmm.
 
ALCOCK: No.
 
MSIMA: It`s going to be a struggle, yeah, and it is scary for us to be sitting at home and doing nothing.
 
ALCOCK: Especially when you know that you went to university for so long, and you have a degree, a qualification, but you`re still struggling to get 
 
 a job because of the unemployment rates.
 
MCKENZIE (voice-over): Those rates are some of the world`s highest. An uncertain future, despite the bitter struggles of the past.

WIRE: Pop quiz, hot shots. Mount Fuji is the tallest mountain in which country? United States, Japan, Mexico, Nepal.
 
Japan`s Mount Fuji was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2013. Hundreds of thousands of people travel to the mountain each year. 
 
Ah, Japan, a truly remarkable place to which tourists are flocking. When the nation reopened to visitors after the pandemic, this picturesque spot 
 
 in front of Mount Fuji became selfie central. Tourists routinely flocking to this convenience store to capture the quirky contrast between the 
 
 glowing neon lights and the serene mountain behind it. 
 
But now, locals are fed up. They`re putting up a giant mesh barrier to make one of the town`s most iconic photo spots disappear. This is part of a 
 
 larger problem of over-tourism in Japan after the country experienced a record number of visitors in March. This is requiring the Mount Fuji area 
 
 to put new policies in place, such as daily limits for hikers and mandatory fees.
 
Locals are concerned that the mountain could lose its prestigious status as a UNESCO Heritage Site due to overcrowding, erosion and the mess that 
 
 tourists leave behind. 
 
Last year, CNN`s Kristie Lu Stout traveled to Japan to learn more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Human traffic jams on sacred Mount Fuji.
 
VITO FUNG YIU TING, HIKER FROM HONG KONG: Very cold, just like a traffic jam.
 
STOUT (voice-over): An ambulance en route to an injured hiker, litter on the mountainside. It`s a side to Japan`s popular tourist site that`s not in 
 
 the guidebooks. But for Mount Fuji ranger Miho Sakurai, it`s just another day on the job.
 
MIHO SAKURAI, MOUNT FUJI RANGER (through translator): There are definitely too many people on Mount Fuji at the moment. The numbers are much higher 
 
 than before.
 
STOUT (voice-over): Famous for its snowcapped volcano, Mount Fuji has inspired artists and been a pilgrimage site for centuries. Less than two 
 
 hours away from Tokyo, Japan`s highest peak attracts visitors globally. And in 2013 it became a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Overtourism has become a 
 
 big problem.
 
This year, a post COVID tourism boom has brought thousands more hikers to Mount Fuji, according to a Yamanashi prefectural government official. The 
 
 environmental damage being done could cost Mount Fuji its heritage status, according to the local government.
 
MASATAKE IZUMI, YAMANASHI PREFECTURAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL (through translator): Fujisan is screaming out in pain. We can`t just wait for 
 
 improvement. We need to tackle overtourism now.
 
STOUT (voice-over): Volunteer take away tons of trash each year. Climbers are urged to donate $7 to help keep the mountain clean. But not everyone 
 
 pays up. And Sakurai says some behavior is even harder to control.
 
SAKURAI (through translator): People of all experience levels come here, including first timers. We want to prevent accidents, so we give them 
 
 advice.
 
STOUT (voice-over): The risk of altitude sickness and hypothermia has been increased by a trend called bullet climbing, where hikers begin their 
 
 ascent at night, pushing on until dawn, according to the Yamanashi tourism board.
 
According to the local government, they start their hike from a place called Fuji`s fifth station, where the number of climbers arriving here 
 
 from Tokyo has more than doubled between 2012 and 2019.
 
The local government also says it wants to shift from quantity to quality tourism. It says replacing the main road to Fuji with a light rail system 
 
 would be a more sustainable solution.
 
SAKURAI (through translator): I`d be devastated if Mount Fuji`s World Heritage status was taken away. I wanted to have that status forever. So 
 
 we`ll do our best to keep it that way.
 
STOUT (voice-over): But with no easy fix in sight, Sakurai will keep doing her bit to protect the mountain she loves.

WIRE: Has anyone ever just started ringing your doorbell over and over and over again? Not cool, right? Well, in today`s story getting a 10 out of 10, 
 
 it wasn`t someone ringing the bell. It was something. CNN`s Jeanne Moos has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JEANNE MOOS, CNN NATIONAL NEWS CORRESPONDENT: We don`t mean to knock the do-it-yourself woodpecker door knocker, or even Woody Woodpecker himself, 
 
 using a finger to ring the bell. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hi, neighbor. 
 
MOOS: But both pale next to the real thing, making the doorbell ding.
 
As far as we can tell, no one ever answered the door. The last woodpecker story I did featured a woman in North Carolina, ringing a doorbell to get 
 
 help removing a woodpecker tangled in her hair. 
 
This isn`t the first time a woodpecker has been spotted ringing a doorbell. This one in Tennessee caused such a crack, the owner posted on Facebook, 
 
 looking for suggestions for a woodpecker-proof doorbell. And a woodpecker that rings a doorbell is no dumbbell. 
 
Jeanne Moos, CNN, New York.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
WIRE: They`ll all be darned. Woody taking knock-knock jokes to a whole new level. Thanks for helping me ring in the week.
 
And thanks to the Mariners at Mariner Middle School in Milton, Delaware. Thanks for showing some love. 
 
And this shout-out goes to the Cougars at Cascade High School in Turner, Oregon. You rock. Rise up, y`all. Go on and make it an awesome day.
 
See you right back here tomorrow. Same time, same place. I`m Coy Wire, and we are CNN 10.
